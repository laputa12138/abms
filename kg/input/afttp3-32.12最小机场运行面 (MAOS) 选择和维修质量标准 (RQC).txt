INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. Background. A wing commander’s or designated mission commander’s 
number one priority after an attack may be to launch and recover mission aircraft. 
However, if the takeoff or landing (ToL) surface is damaged during the attack, 
repairs are likely required before launching and recovering aircraft. In most 
instances, repairing the entire airfield is not an option; it would take too long to 
meet the commander’s air tasking order (ATO). Initially, only repairing the 
minimum pavement necessary to launch and recover aircraft expedites the 
reopening of the airfield. 
 
1.1.1. Engineers, with close coordination from Airfield Management, must 
recommend the most appropriate airfield surfaces to repair—those that require the 
least repair time, including unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) mitigation, but 
still provide adequate launch or recovery (LoR) surfaces for mission aircraft. The 
ToL surface selected for repair is called the minimum operating strip (MOS). The 
MOS is the area where aircraft actually takeoff or land and its dimensions are 
determined by the installation Crisis Action Team (CAT). The MOS dimensions 
vary with aircraft type, operation, and weights, as well as environmental 
conditions. 
 
1.1.2. A suitable MOS cannot be selected without a full appreciation of the 
damage throughout the entire airfield. For example, if an ideal MOS is identified 
that involves minimum repair effort, finding acceptable access routes from aircraft 
parking areas to the MOS must also be considered. These combined surfaces 
(MOS, minimum taxiways, and minimum aircraft parking areas) are known as the 
minimum airfield operating surface (MAOS). 
 
1.2. Overview. This publication serves as a guide to select suitable MAOS 
candidates. It explains the MAOS selection process, to include concept of 
operations, team organization and resources, sequence of the selection steps, 
characteristics of a good MOS, and determining Repair Quality Criteria (RQC). 
An illustrated example of MOS selection is also presented. Note: RQC

calculations are only required for legacy repair methods (e.g., crushed stone with 
or without foreign object debris (FOD) cover). The new rapid airfield damage 
recovery (RADR) capping methods (e.g., rapid-setting concrete or asphalt) are 
considered semi-permanent repairs and repaired flush with the surrounding 
pavement.

CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS 
 
2.1. Sequence of Events. Before repairs begin, airfield damage must be assessed, 
reported, and plotted; a MAOS selected; and explosive hazards mitigated and 
removed. 
 
2.1.1. Damage Assessment. Airfield Damage Assessment Teams (ADATs), 
described in AFTTP 3-32.11, Airfield Damage Assessment after Attack, and/or 
remote sensors provide information about the type, size, and location of damage 
and explosive hazards on the airfield surfaces to MAOS selection personnel. The 
CAT provides additional information on operational requirements and expected 
operating conditions following the attack. 
 
2.1.1.1. Depending on the localized threat, some bases will be outfitted with 
remote sensors able to detect airfield damage and explosive hazards. The remote 
sensors expedite the assessment process and removes Airmen from the explosive 
hazard environment. 
 
2.1.1.2. Manual damage assessment is performed by ADATs at installations 
where remote sensors are not available. 
 
2.1.2. MAOS Selection. Using information provided by the CAT and manual 
assessment process with ADATs, the MAOS Selection Team’s goal is to identify 
potential MAOS candidates as soon as possible. Where remote sensors are 
utilized, the goal is to identify potential MAOS candidates within 30 minutes after 
damage assessment begins. Once the MAOS candidates are identified, the MAOS 
Selection Team briefs the MAOS candidates to the wing commander and/or 
designated mission commander. The commander selects the most desirable 
candidate to meet the ATO. 
 
2.1.3. Explosive Hazard Mitigation. Once the MAOS is selected, Explosive 
Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators begin mitigating explosive hazards by 
rendering safe and/or removing UXO impacting MAOS recovery (as described in 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024 
9 
 
AFTTP 3-32.5, Volume 6, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Unexploded 
Explosive Ordnance (UXO) Operations). 
 
2.1.4. MAOS Repair. As EOD mitigates explosive hazards from repair areas and 
provides minimum clear space, recovery teams begin pavement repairs, airfield 
marking and striping, airfield lighting and aircraft arresting system installation, 
and final sweeping of the MAOS. 
 
2.1.5. Airfield Restrictions and Closures. Civil Engineers coordinate with the 
Airfield Manager or designated representative through all phases of the repair 
process (i.e. pre-, ongoing, and post-) to ensure appropriate airfield restrictions 
and/or closures are imposed and applicable Notice to Air Mission (NOTAMs) 
issued. 
 
2.2. Minimum Airfield Operating Surface Selection Team. The MAOS 
Selection Team utilizes damage and explosive hazard data received from ADATs 
and/or remote sensors, and pertinent operational information received from the 
CAT (e.g., expected weather conditions, runway conditions, aircraft loads, 
minimum MOS width, lighting and arresting system requirements) to identify 
acceptable MAOS candidates. 
 
2.2.1. Deliverable. Airfield damage and explosive hazard data received from 
remote sensors or ADATs are entered into GeoExPT, or manually plotted on the 
MOS selection map when GeoExPT is unavailable. The back-up MAOS Selection 
Team, typically in the Civil Engineer Unit Control Center (CE-UCC), performs 
the same actions to ensure data is survivable if the primary Emergency Operations 
Center (EOC) is destroyed during subsequent attacks. GeoExPT generates three 
suggested MAOS candidates (verified by the selection team) or selected manually 
by the MAOS Selection Team when GeoExPT is not available and are presented 
to the wing commander and/or designated mission commander for final selection. 
 
2.2.2. Location. The EOC and CE-UCC each have a MAOS selection team 
assigned. Information regarding MAOS selection is promptly passed to the 
Alternate EOC and Alternate CE-UCC. This provides redundancy for damage 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024 
10 
 
recording, checks and balances on proposed MAOS candidates, and continuity of 
operations in the event the Primary EOC and/or Primary CE-UCC is damaged. 
 
2.2.3. Team Composition. The MAOS Selection Team composition depends upon 
the damage assessment method used. 
 
2.2.3.1. Manual Damage Assessment by ADATs. At a minimum, this MAOS 
Selection Team is composed of two engineering technicians (AFSC 3E5X1) and 
an augmentee (Table 2.1). The engineering technicians input data into GeoExPT 
or plots damage on the airfield map, select at least three MAOS candidates, and 
brief the wing commander and/or designated mission commander on the 
candidates. The augmentee receives data from the ADATs via radio and records 
the data on worksheets. 
 
2.2.3.1.1. An EOD representative (AFSC 3E8X1) in the EOC may support the 
MAOS Selection Team by receiving and recording EOD related data from the 
ADATs. They also provide technical expertise on explosive hazard standoff 
distances and estimate explosive hazard mitigation times.

2.2.3.1.2. Installations often support a variety of aircraft with different MAOS 
requirements which must be considered during MAOS selection. Therefore, 
coordinate MAOS candidates with an Airfield Management representative, who 
understands aircraft characteristics and airfield design criteria, prior to briefing 
the candidates to the wing commander and/or designated mission commander. 
 
2.2.3.2. Damage Assessment via Remote Sensors. This MAOS Selection Team 
includes an engineering (3E5X1) and EOD technician (3E8X1) for each ground 
control station receiving sensor data (Table 2.2). These individuals digitize and/or 
verify actual damage and explosive hazards identified on the video within 
GeoExPT. 
 
2.2.3.3. The goal is to identify three potential MAOS candidates within 30 
minutes after damage assessment begins. Once MAOS candidates are identified, 
the Engineering Technician (3E5X1) transfers the GeoExPT MAOS Selection 
Report from the Rapid Airfield Damage Assessment to a NIPR machine via 
digital video disk. The information is passed to the EOC and alternate CE-UCC. 
The MAOS Selection Team in the EOC briefs the MAOS candidates to the wing 
commander and/or designated mission commander. The commander selects the 
most desirable candidate to meet the ATO.

2.4. Minimum Airfield Operating Surface Characteristics. Simply stated, the 
goal of MAOS candidate selection is to locate the best available MOS that can be 
repaired in the least amount of time. A good MOS has many characteristics, the 
ranking of which will depend upon the situation at a particular installation. 
Consequently, the MAOS selection process must be flexible to identify the best 
option under a wide variety of circumstances. Generally, a good MAOS will allow 
rapid restoration of launch and recovery capability. Crater repair is a lengthy 
process; thus, it is important to initially repair no more damage than necessary. 
That is why it is imperative to wait for completion of airfield damage assessment 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024 
14 
 
before finalizing MAOS selection. The MAOS selection procedure is designed to 
choose a takeoff and landing area that is comparatively low in crater and spall 
damage. Repair time, therefore, is saved at the cost of initial delay caused by 
accurately identifying and plotting damage and selecting a MOS. Selecting a 
MAOS is a balance of identifying candidates with the least amount of damage, 
maximum utilization of existing markings, lighting, and aircraft arresting systems, 
and a high LoR rating. 
 
2.4.1. Resource Limitations. A RADR team’s capability may be hampered by 
resource shortages and equipment deficiencies. The MAOS selection team should 
consider any noticeable limitations when determining candidates. As damage 
reports are received, the selection team must make a conscious decision to monitor 
airfield damage repair equipment and materials status during the MOS selection 
process. Engineer personnel in the alternate EOC and CE-UCC should also 
monitor equipment and material status as a crosscheck for accuracy. As airfield 
damage assessment nears completion, a quick verification of equipment and 
material between all control centers should be accomplished to ensure the most 
current information is considered. 
 
2.4.2. Sortie Capability. Aircraft should be able to get to and from the MOS 
quickly. If a MAOS is selected without regard to sortie generation capability, 
aircraft operations could be restricted after MOS repair. The LoR status of an 
airfield measures sortie generation capability, independent of variables such as 
mission time, aircraft attrition, and origin of aircraft (aircraft may launch at one 
air base and be recovered at another). A few examples of how various restrictions 
can reduce LoR capabilities are shown in Table 2.4. For example, a MOS with 
two access taxiways that requires an aircraft to backtrack more than 2,000 feet 
will have an LoR capability of only 50 percent. Additional explanations of other 
common LoR restrictions are described below. 
 
2.4.2.1. LoR Status. The LoR status of a MOS is the total number of launches and 
recoveries the surface can handle per unit time compared to the number that could 
be handled by the same undamaged airfield. An LoR status of 100 percent simply 
means the MOS and its access route(s) are not restricting sortie capacity. Even if 
its LoR status is substantially less than 100 percent, it does not necessarily mean 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024 
15 
 
that the MOS is limiting sortie capability. Normal operations may not use the 
entire capability, and other factors in the base status after an attack may be even 
more limiting. 
 
2.4.2.2. MOS Location. A MOS may be located on the main runway parallel to 
the centerline, on a parallel taxiway, or even on an alternate LoR surface on or off 
base that has the proper structural capacity. The MOS location affects LoR status 
in various ways by limiting access and egress, by limiting air traffic control, or by 
restricting the flight approach of aircraft.

4.1 Purpose. Manual MAOS selection is used when GeoExPT is unavailable. 
 
4.2. Chart Description. Figure 4.1 is an example of charts used to determine the 
MOS requirement for a given aircraft and aircraft operation. The chart has four 
areas: 1) the location baseline shift area; 2) the environmental shift area; 3) the 
uncorrected RQC area; and 4) correction factor area as shown in Figure 4.1.

4.2.1. Location Base Line. The location baseline is the starting point for 
calculations. This area is used to determine the MOS requirement, as well as mark 
the repair patch locations when determining the RQC requirement. 
 
4.2.2. Environmental Shift. This area compensates for aircraft performance 
variations due to weather and runway conditions. These include the Density Ratio 
(DR) and the Runway Surface Condition (RSC). Note: Some charts may not have 
an RSC section. 
 
4.2.3. Uncorrected RQC. This area determines initial RQC for individual repairs. 
 
4.2.4. Correction Factor. This area provides RQC correction factors based on the 
repair location on the MOS and its proximity to other repairs. 
 
4.3. Assumptions. The following assumptions apply when performing the manual 
MAOS selection method. 
 
4.3.1. Users are familiar with the functions of damage assessment and MAOS 
selection, including reporting of airfield damage nomenclature. 
 
4.3.2. RQC represents the maximum allowable repair height, in inches, for all 
values except flush (F) and a flush repair followed by a flush repair (FF). 
 
4.3.3. Allowable sag depth is 2.0 inches for all RQC, except “F” and “FF.” 
 
4.3.4. Allowable repair slope is 5.0 percent for all RQC, except in a landing 
touchdown zone. Allowable repair slope is 3.4 percent in landing touchdown 
zones. 
 
4.3.5. Aircraft contact the entire length of each repair on the MOS. Lateral repair 
location does not affect RQC. 
 
4.3.6. All spalls are repaired to flush criteria. 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024

4.3.7. Aircraft operation lengths are defined as takeoff or landing distance in the 
aircraft performance manual. Since the MOS length may be specified by the CAT 
and the wing commander and/or the mission commander, it may be longer than 
the longest operation length. Any repair in a section of the MOS beyond the 
longest operation length has an RQC equal to flush “F.” 
 
4.3.8. Aircraft are maintained in accordance with relevant technical orders and 
service manuals. 
 
4.3.9. Relay the following caution to the CAT and Airfield Management for 
taxiway repairs: “All operations on taxiway repairs are limited to 5 knots. 
Taxiway repairs may have up to 6 inches of upheaval and up to 2 inches of sag. 
Braking in vicinity of repairs on taxiway surfaces must be avoided.” 
 
4.4. Step-by-Step Directions for Determining Minimum Operating Strip 
(MOS) Lengths. Table 4.1 provides a step-by-step checklist for determining 
MOS lengths. It is recommended the user follow these steps to ensure accuracy 
and quality of the process. Steps 1 and 2 may be performed during pre-attack 
actions to save time when selecting MAOS candidates after the attack. 
Information in the following paragraphs expound upon Table 4.1.

1.1.5 
Direction of operations (from MOS threshold or 
departure end) 
1.2 
Record the RQC chart number for each operation 
1.3 
Record highest expected temperature, pressure altitude, and 
lowest Density Ratio (DR) expected for that day. If DR is 
unavailable, use DR Chart (Figure 4.2 & Attachment 2) by 
drawing a vertical line from the temperature axis until 
intersecting with the pressure altitude and then draw a 
horizontal line to the DR axis.  
1.4 
If applicable, record condition or greatest expected depth of 
condition (i.e. average depth of water, slush, loose snow, 
packed snow, or ice on runway surface to nearest tenth of an 
inch). 
2 
Determine Operational Lengths (See Figure 4.4) 
2.1 
Draw a horizontal line, corresponding to the DR (0.97), across 
the DR section. 
2.2 
Draw horizontal line in condition-type section (Chart D2) 
corresponding to worst type of condition expected in that 
section of MOS in next 12 hours. 
2.3 
From the intersection of the DR line and the shaded section, 
draw a vertical line to the bottom of the RSC section. Follow 
guideline until line intersects with RSC. From this intersection, 
draw a vertical line downward to location baseline to determine 
operational length (4,400) and record on Worksheet 1. 
2.4 
If no RSC section (Chart D1), locate intersection of DR line 
with shaded section. From this point, draw a vertical line 
downward to location baseline to determine operational length 
(3,525) and record on Worksheet 1.

Define Repair Patches on the ToL Map 
3.1 
Draw lines, perpendicular to sides of MOS, at beginning and 
end of each crater on, or partially on, MOS. 
3.2

3.3 
If two shaded areas are within 25 feet of each other, shade area 
between them 
3.4 
From MOS threshold, number each shaded area as a patch 
4 
For each Operation, Determine Patch Locations, Lengths, and 
Spacing 
4.1 
Draw double lines, perpendicular to sides of MOS, marking 
operation threshold and operation length 
4.2 
For each patch within two sets of double lines, record operation 
number and patch number on Worksheet 2 (e.g., for Operations 
2 – Patch 3, enter “2/3”) 
4.3 
For each patch, measure distance from operation threshold to 
center of patch, record “Patch Location” on Worksheet 2. If 
distance is greater than operation length, record operation 
length. 
4.4 
Measure length of each patch and record on Worksheet 2. 
4.5 
For each patch, measure distance from center of patch to center 
of next patch (in operational direction) and record this distance 
as “Patch Spacing” on Worksheet 2. For last patch, record 
maximum spacing value from RQC chart. 
4.6 
Repeat step 4 for each operation using MOS. 
5 
Determine Uncorrected RQC and Correction Factor 
5.1 
Mark location of each patch on location baseline 
5.2 
Mark spacing and length for each patch on their respective axes 
5.3 
Draw a horizontal line, corresponding to the current DR, across 
the DR section. If there is an RSC section, draw a horizontal 
line, corresponding to current RSC, across that section. 
5.4 
For each patch, draw a vertical line from location baseline to 
intersect with current DR. Then follow guidelines to top of DR 
section. From this point, draw a vertical line to intersect with 
current RSC. Then follow guidelines to top of the section. 
From this point, draw a vertical line to top of DR section to top 
of RQC chart.

5.5 
For each patch, draw a horizontal line corresponding to spacing 
for that patch until line intersects with vertical line from step 
5.4. Determine uncorrected RQC from region of intersection 
and record on Worksheet 2. If intersection falls within a shaded 
region, a correction factor is not required. 
5.6 
For each patch, draw a horizontal line corresponding to length 
of that patch until line intersects with vertical line from step 
5.4. Determine correction factor from region of intersection and 
record on Worksheet 2.  
5.7 
Perform step 5 for each operation. 
6 
Determine RQC for Each Repair Patch 
6.1 
Add correction factor to uncorrected RQC and record on 
Worksheet 2. If result is a negative number, record an “F.” If 
uncorrected RQC for a repair is “FF,” record an “F” for both 
that patch and patch immediately following it. 
6.2 
Calculate RQC for each patch for each operation 
7 
Summarize RQC for Entire MOS

7.3 
Mark each patch number from MOS on both top and bottom of 
Worksheet 3. 
7.4 
For each operation and patch number, record RQC from 
Worksheet 2 onto Worksheet 3. For patches on MOS but not 
within length of any operation, record an “F.” 
7.5 
For each repair patch and each operation direction, record the 
lowest RQC in the summary lines on Worksheet 3 
7.6 
For each repair patch, record lower summary value in 
combined line on Worksheet 3 
7.7 
Transfer combined RQC to ToL map, and brief Base Civil 
Engineer and/or wing commander and/or mission commander.

procedures used during aircraft operations, select charts for all possible operations 
(charts may be found in Attachment 3). Note: If possible, perform this step 
during pre-attack actions to save time during actual MAOS selection. 
 
Note: Some aircraft models found in these RQC charts have been retired by the 
US, but ally nations may still fly them; therefore, the charts remain. If there is no 
chart for an aircraft or a particular aircraft operation, plan for a 10,000-ft by 150-
ft MOS unless the Senior Airfield Authority (SAA) provides specific MOS 
dimensions. Projects are scheduled to develop charts for new aircraft models not 
listed and will be added when available.

Figure 4.3. Worksheet 1 Example. 
 
 
4.4.2. Determining Operational Lengths. Once proper charts are selected, 
determine operation length for each combination of aircraft configuration and 
operation. The longest calculated length for aircraft operations to be performed is 
the minimum overall length of the MOS. Note: If there is no chart for an aircraft 
or a particular aircraft operation, plan for 10,000-feet by 150-feet MOS unless the 
(SAA) provides other MOS dimensions. 
 
4.4.2.1. RQC Charts with RSC. Figure 4.4. provides an example of determining 
operational lengths for F-16 landing operations with a DR = 0.97, Condition = 
DRY, and Condition Depth = 0.0. Note: See Table 4.1., Step 1.3, for instructions 
to determine DR when unavailable from the CAT. Note: For illustration purposes, 
landing operation with condition of WR (7,100) is also shown in Figure 4.4. 
 
4.4.2.1.1. Draw a horizontal line across the DR section corresponding to the DR 
recorded on Worksheet 1 (0.97). 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024 
30 
 
4.4.2.1.2. Draw a horizontal line across the RSC section corresponding to the 
condition recorded on Worksheet 1 (DRY). 
 
Figure 4.4. Determining Operational Lengths. 
 
 
4.4.2.1.3. From the intersection of the DR line with the shaded section, draw a 
vertical line down to the location baseline (4,400). 
 
4.4.2.1.4. If the RSC were Wet (WR) or Slush/Loose Snow/Packed Snow/Ice 
(SLR/LSR/PSR/IR), follow the horizontal DR line to the shaded area. Draw a 
vertical line up to the bottom of the RSC section and follow guidelines until the 
line intersects with current RSC. Stay between guidelines in proportion to starting 
location (e.g., WR/SLR/LSR = 7,100). 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024 
31 
 
4.4.2.1.5. Record length (4,400) in space provided on Worksheet 1 (Figure 4.5). 
 
4.4.2.1.6. Perform the above steps for each operation on Worksheet 1. 
 
4.4.2.2. RQC Charts without RSC. Operational length determination using charts 
with no RSC is simply accomplished by eliminating the shift in the RSC area. 
 
Figure 4.5. Operational Lengths Entered on Worksheet 1. 
 
 
4.4.2.2.1. Continuing with the example above, if the RSC were WR, the landing 
operation length would be 7,100 feet; this would require a MOS of at least that 
length. In this case, determine if the MOS length could be decreased by 
calculating the arrested landing operational length using RQC Chart D3 (Figure 
4.6), which does not have an RSC section. Note: Using arrested landing 
operational lengths may result in fewer pavement repairs but may also lower the 
MOS LoR capability (Table 2.3).

Figure 4.6. Determining Arrested Landing Operational Length. 
 
 
4.4.2.2.2. Draw a horizontal line across the DR section corresponding to the DR 
recorded on Worksheet 1 (0.97). 
4.4.2.2.3. There is no shaded area in the DR section; therefore, draw a vertical line 
from the far right side of the DR section down to the location baseline and record 
the value (2,034) on Worksheet 1 (Figure 4.5). 
 
4.4.2.2.4. Use Chart D1 (Figure 4.7) to determine takeoff operational length. 
Where DR line intersects shaded area, draw vertical line to location baseline since 
there is no RSC section and add results to Worksheet 1 (Figure 4.5).

4.4.3. Damage Plotting. Runway damage is plotted on a 1:1200 scale (1-inch 
equals 100 feet) ToL map as reported by the ADATs. The ToL map should utilize 
the same Pavement Reference Marking System (PRMS) as the grid overlay. The 
MOS selection team uses the ToL map (located in the EOC when possible) to 
select MOS candidates. Damage is initially plotted on the ToL map with estimated 
repair diameters (double the apparent diameter). Utilize the 1:4800 (1-inch equals 
400 feet) Crash Grid Map for all damage items not located on the runway. This 
map should utilize the Military Grid Reference System as the grid overlay. 
Following completion of runway repairs, RQC must be recalculated using the 
actual repair lengths. 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024 
34 
 
 
4.4.4. Initial MAOS Selection. Choose several potential launch and recovery 
strips with support areas (e.g., refueling area, munition loading area, arm/de-arm 
area, parking, maintenance). Consider all suitable pavement surfaces that can be 
used for ToL surfaces (e.g., parallel taxiways and access roads). Keep limiting 
factors and shortfalls in mind. Slide MOS template across the ToL map until a 
suitable MOS is found. Bracket ([ ]) the MOS ends and list using the MOS 
identifier as explained in paragraph 4.4.5.1. Continue this same procedure until 
two alternatives are located. Table 4.3 lists positive and negative MAOS 
attributes. 
 
4.4.5. Additional Factors. Other factors that may influence MAOS selection: 
 
4.4.5.1. In most cases a unidirectional MOS results in less stringent RQC values, 
which may permit greater latitude in repair quality.  
 
Table 4.3. Minimum Airfield Operating Surface (MAOS) Attributes. 
Positive 
Negative 
• 
Minimal number of craters 
• 
Damage unrepairable within 6.5 
hours 
•

Positive 
Negative 
• 
Close to material stockpiles 
• 
Damaged utility lines (e.g., water 
and fuel) 
• 
Longer and wider dimensions • 
Dense clusters of UXO 
 
4.4.5.2. In most situations landing operations require more pavement length than 
takeoff operations, especially in wet or icy conditions. If an aircraft arresting 
system is available, the landing length can be shortened with an accompanying 
decrease in the repair efforts. Ensure sufficient undamaged pavement exists before 
recommending an aircraft arresting system. 
 
4.4.5.3. There may be occasions, particularly with bidirectional operations, when 
moving an operational threshold could decrease the RQC value for a repair patch. 
Look for the takeoff or landing operation that drives the lowest RQC value for a 
particular patch and if moving the applicable threshold results in a less restrictive 
RQC value. Chances are the need for the repair patch will not be eliminated, but 
the degree of required quality will be lessened. 
 
4.4.5.4. After repairs are completed and accurate dimensions are obtained, it is 
critical to repeat the RQC process to ensure safe aircraft operations. 
 
4.4.6. Define Repair Patches on the ToL Map. 
 
4.4.6.1. After selection, determine MOS coordinates using the same method as 
locating damage and UXO as explained in AFTTP 3-32.11. For example, the 50-
feet by 5,000-feet MOS in Figure 4.8 is selected on 150-feet wide by 9,000-feet 
long runway. The MOS would be identified as: BM4000R50F9000R50W50 as 
explained in Table 4.4.

4.4.6.2. Draw lines perpendicular to the MOS edges at the beginning and end of 
each crater on (or partially on) the MOS (Figure 4.8). 
 
4.4.6.3. Shade areas on the MOS between the lines for each repair. If two or more 
shaded areas overlap, or are within 25 feet of each other, shade the area or areas 
between them. 
 
4.4.6.4. From the MOS operational threshold, number each shaded area as a repair 
patch. For operations on bidirectional MOSs, do not renumber patches when the 
operation direction changes. Once a patch is numbered, it should not be changed. 
 
4.4.7. Finding Repair Patch Location, Length, and Spacing. 
 
4.4.7.1. Once repair patches have been numbered, determine location, length, and 
spacing for each. Figure 4.8 shows examples of patch locations, lengths and 
spacing. Figure 4.9 provides an example of results recorded on Worksheet 2. 
 
4.4.7.2. Draw double lines on the ToL map perpendicular to the sides of the MOS 
to mark the operations threshold and operation length. 
 
4.4.7.3. For each patch within the two sets of double lines, record the operation 
number and patch number on Worksheet 2.

Figure 4.9. Worksheet 2 Example. 
 
 
4.4.7.4. Find the center of each repair patch. Measure the distance (in feet) from 
this point back to the operational threshold. If the distance is greater than the 
operation length, use the operation length. If the patch center is in front of the 
operation threshold, use zero. Record these repair locations in the “Patch 
Location” column of Worksheet 2. 
 
4.4.7.5. Measure each patch length parallel to the side of the MOS (in feet). 
Record the results in the “Patch Length” column of Worksheet 2. 
 
4.4.7.6. Measure, in the direction of operation, the distance (in feet) from the 
center of each patch to the center of the next patch. If there is not a “next” patch 
(i.e., the patch is the last one), use the maximum value on the spacing axis of the 
RQC chart. Record the results in the “Patch Spacing” column of Worksheet 2. 
 
4.4.7.7. Mark the repair patch locations, lengths, and spacing on applicable RQC 
charts. If the value for any length or spacing is greater than the maximum or less 
than the minimum shown on the RQC chart, mark the maximum or minimum.

4.4.8. Finding Repair Quality Criteria (RQC). Incorrect RQC calculations may 
result in aircraft damage, aircrew injury, and/or death of the aircrew. Uncertainty 
of any value (RQC, uncorrected RQC, or correction factor) shall be resolved by 
using the most conservative value (i.e., the lowest value). An intersection on a 
boundary line between two regions in the uncorrected RQC or correction factor 
areas must be treated as though it falls in the region with the lowest value. Figure 
4.10 illustrates the procedure to find RQC.

4.4.8.1. Finding Uncorrected RQC. 
 
4.4.8.1.1. Draw a horizontal line across the DR section corresponding to the DR 
recorded on Worksheet 1 (0.97). If there is an RSC section, draw a horizontal line 
across that section corresponding to the RSC recorded on Worksheet 1. 
 
4.4.8.1.2. Draw vertical lines from the patch locations (2,300) on the location 
baseline until they intersect with the current DR. 
 
4.4.8.1.3. From each intersection, follow the guidelines to the top of the DR 
section. Stay between the guidelines in proportion to the starting location. 
 
4.4.8.1.4. If applicable, from the top of the DR section, draw a vertical line until 
it intersects with the current RSC, then follow the guidelines to the top of that 
section. From this point, draw a vertical line to the top of the RQC chart. If there 
is no RSC section, draw a vertical line from the top of the DR section to the top 
of the RQC chart. 
 
4.4.8.1.5. Draw a horizontal line from each repair patch spacing on the vertical 
axis to the uncorrected RQC area. Continue each line until it intersects the vertical 
line for that patch. 
 
4.4.8.1.6. The intersections are in the various regions of the uncorrected RQC 
area. The number in each region indicates the uncorrected RQC for intersections 
in that region. Record the uncorrected RQC values (4) for each repair patch on 
Worksheet 2 (Figure 4.11). 
 
4.4.8.1.7. A value of “F” indicates a flush repair. A value of “FF” indicates a flush 
repair that must be followed by another flush repair. 
 
4.4.8.2. Finding Correction Factor. Correction factor is always negative or zero. 
 
4.4.8.2.1. If uncorrected RQC is in a region shaded with diagonal lines, corrected 
RQC equals the uncorrected RQC. All “F” and “FF” regions are shaded with 
diagonal lines. “FF” regions are crosshatched to contract with “F” regions.

Figure 4.11. Repair Quality Criteria Values Recorded on Worksheet 2. 
 
 
4.4.8.2.2. In the Corrected RQC area, draw a horizontal line from each patch 
length to intersect the appropriate vertical line. 
 
4.4.8.2.3. The intersections of these lines are in the various regions of the 
correction factor. The number in each region indicates the correction factor for 
intersections in that region. 
 
4.4.8.2.4. Record the correction factor(s) (-3) on Worksheet 2 (Figure 4.11). 
 
4.4.9. Calculating RQC. A patch with an uncorrected RQC of “F” or “FF” has 
an RQC of “F.” The patch following a patch with an uncorrected RQC of “FF” 
also has an RQC of “F.” 
 
4.4.9.1. Add the uncorrected RQC (4) and correction factor (-3). RQC (1) is 
always less than or equal to the uncorrected RQC. 
 
4.4.9.2. If the uncorrected RQC plus the correction factor results in a negative 
number, the RQC for that repair patch is “F.” 
4.4.9.3. Record the RQC values on Worksheet 2 (Figure 4.11) and in the spaced 
provided on Worksheet 3 (Figure 4.12). 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024

Note: Arrested landing from the departure end is not listed as an operation due to 
the fact that if a second arresting system was installed 1,250 feet from the 
departure end, patch 2 would fall within the “NO REPAIRS ALLOWED” section 
of the RQC chart. An arresting system could not be installed at midfield due to 
the fact that patch 1 would be within the “NO REPAIRS ALLOWED” section of 
the RQC chart. Therefore, in-flight emergency landings requiring arrestment 
would only be performed when landing from the threshold end. When landing in 
the opposite direction the SAA may authorize use of the departure end (threshold 
end in this scenario) aircraft arresting system for aircraft experiencing braking 
problems and for aborted take-offs. 
 
Note: RQC charts in Attachment 3 were developed prior to implementing 
RADR. If a repair is accomplished using the crushed stone and FOD cover 
method, repairs should not be within 550 feet of the approach side of the pendent 
and 50 feet on the departure side of the pendent. When using the RADR flush 
repair method, repairs should not be within 200 feet of either side of the pendent. 
 
4.4.9.4. Repeat instructions in paragraph 4.4.5 for every operation in the same 
direction. Patch numbering and patch spacing remain constant. 
 
4.4.9.5. If bi-directional operations are required, repeat the instructions for 
paragraph 4.4.5 for each operation in the opposite direction. Patch numbering 
and patch lengths remain constant. Remember the operational threshold is now at 
the departure end. 
 
4.4.10. RQC Summary. Summarize RQC for the entire MOS on Worksheet 3 
(Figure 4.12). 
 
4.4.10.1. List each operation from MOS threshold on the top half of Worksheet 3. 
 
4.4.10.2. List each operation from MOS departure end on the bottom half of 
Worksheet 3.

4.4.10.3. For each operation and patch number, record the RQC from Worksheet 
2 onto Worksheet 3. For patches that are on the MOS but are not within the length 
of any operation, record an “F”. 
 
4.5. Presenting Minimum Airfield Operating Surface Candidates to Wing 
Commander and/or Designated Mission Commander. It is recommended that 
the MAOS Selection Team brief the EOC staff for feedback before briefing the 
wing commander and/or designated mission commander. Provide the following 
information when briefing the wing commander and/or mission commander: 
 
4.5.1. Pros and cons of each candidate. 
 
4.5.2. Estimated time to complete repairs. 
 
4.5.3. Repair priority recommendations. 
 
4.5.4. Any actions concerning sortie generation to include RQC data. 
 
4.5.5. Monitor repair and update appropriate maps to indicate status and provide 
updates to the EOC to keep the wing commander and/or mission commander 
abreast of recovery progress. 
 
4.5.6. An example of presenting this data using a MOS map is presented in Figure 
4.13. The RQC values for both MOS threshold and departure end operations are 
shown along with the combined values for each repair patch. This summary 
permits a quick method of informing the CE-UCC of RQC requirements so they 
may rapidly forward them to repair crews.

Terms 
Airfield—An area prepared for the accommodation (including any buildings, 
installations, and equipment), landing, and takeoff of aircraft. 
Air Tasking Order (ATO)—A method used to task and disseminate to 
components, subordinate units, and command and control agencies projected 
sorties, capabilities and/or forces to targets and specific missions. Normally 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024

provides specific instructions to include call signs, targets, controlling agencies, 
etc., as well as general instructions. Source: JP 3-30. 
Airfield Damage Assessment—Locating, classifying, and measuring the 
damage (camouflet, crater, spall, and UXO) on the airfield operating surfaces. 
Airfield Damage Assessment Team (ADAT)—An airfield recovery team, 
typically located in or near the EOC and directed by Emergency Support 
Function-3, used to identify and locate airfield damage and UXO following an 
attack. Their initial efforts are normally targeted towards the airfield proper; but 
can also be employed elsewhere as deemed necessary. The ADAT usually 
consists of one engineering technician and two EOD technicians. A CE member 
trained as an EOD assistant may replace one of the EOD technicians when two 
are unavailable for ADAT. The ADAT should be equipped with an armored 
vehicle and communications enabling them to report their observations to the 
MAOS Selection Cell. The ADAT damage reports must be accurate as this 
information is used in MAOS selection. 
Apron/Ramp—A defined area on an airfield intended to accommodate aircraft 
for the purposes of loading or unloading passengers or cargo, refueling, parking, 
or maintenance. 
Camouflet—Craters with relatively small apparent diameters, but deep 
penetration and subsurface voids created by the munition puncturing through the 
pavement surface and exploding in the base material. Note:  Munitions that 
penetrate the surface but do not explode are also treated as a camouflets. 
Camouflet Field—A cluster of spalls within a defined area. 
Crater—The pit, depression, or cavity formed in the surface of the earth by an 
explosion. It may range from saucer-shaped to conical, depending largely on the 
depth of burst. 
Crater Field—A cluster of small craters (less than two feet apart) where their 
upheaval joins the neighboring crater within a defined area. 
Damage Assessment—1. The determination of the effects that attacks have on 
targets. 2. (DOD only) A determination of the effect of a compromise of 
classified information on national security. 3. (AF/CE) The process of 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024 
50 
 
identifying and locating damage and unexploded ordnance following an attack. 
Damage assessment activities generally are separated into two categories: 
airfield pavements and facility/utility. 
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—A temporary or permanent facility 
where the coordination of information and resources to support domestic 
incident management activities normally takes place. 
Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)—The detection, identification, on-site 
evaluation, rendering safe, recovery, and final disposal of unexploded explosive 
ordnance. It may also include explosive ordnance which has become hazardous 
by damage or deterioration. 
MAOS Selection—The process of plotting damage and UXO locations on an 
airbase runway map and using this information to select a portion of the 
damaged runway which can be repaired most quickly to support aircraft 
operations. 
Minimum Airfield Operating Surface (MAOS)—The combined requirement 
for airfield surfaces for both runway and access routes. For example, the MOS is 
part of the MAOS. 
Minimum Operating Strip (MOS)—1. A runway which meets the minimum 
requirements for operating assigned and/or allocated aircraft types on a 
particular airfield at maximum or combat gross weight. 2. The MOS is the 
smallest amount of area to be repaired to launch and recover aircraft after an 
attack. Selection of this MOS will depend upon mission requirements, taxi 
access, resources available, and estimated time to repair. For fighter aircraft, the 
typically accepted dimensions are 5,000 feet long by 50 feet wide. 
Personnel—Those individuals required in either a military or civilian capacity 
to accomplish the assigned mission. 
Procedures—Standard, detailed steps that prescribe how to perform specific 
tasks. 
Ramp—see “apron.” 
 
AFTTP3-32.12  3 MAY 2024 
51 
 
Runway—A defined rectangular area of an airfield, prepared for the landing 
and takeoff run of aircraft along its length. A runway is measured from the outer 
edge of the thresholds from one end of the runway to the others. The width of 
the runway is typically measured from the outer edge of the load-bearing 
pavement on one side to the outer edge of the load-bearing pavement on the 
other side. In some cases, the runway may be measured from the outside edge of 
the runway marking line on one side to the outside edge of the marking line on 
the other side and any remaining load bearing pavement is considered shoulder. 
Runway Surface Condition (RSC)—Identifies the condition of the runway 
surface when covered with slush, snow, ice or water. In regards to MOS 
selection, Airfield Management personnel estimate to the extent or depth to the 
nearest 1/10 of an inch of any precipitation on the MOS and report this 
measurement to the MOS Selection Team prior to MOS selection. 
Spall—Pavement damage that does not penetrate through the pavement surface 
to the underlying soil layers. A spall damage area could be up to 1.5 meters (5 
feet) in diameter. 
Spall Field—A cluster of spalls within a defined area. 
Taxiway—A specially-prepared or designated path on an airfield or heliport, 
other than apron areas, on which aircraft move under their own power to and 
from landing, takeoff, service, and parking areas. 
Techniques—Non-prescriptive ways or methods use to perform missions, 
functions, or tasks. 
Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO)—Explosive ordnance which has 
been primed, fused, armed, or otherwise prepared for action, and which has been 
fired, dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such a manner as to constitute a 
hazard to operations, installations, personnel, or material, and remains 
unexploded either by malfunction or design. =
