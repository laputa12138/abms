1.  PURPOSE.  This AFJQS identifies tasks and duty requirements for individuals performing 
duties with the Special Experience Identifier (SEI) 3CS (C-sUAS Operator).  It provides the 
minimum training requirements and standardizes on-the-job training (OJT) tasks necessary to 
successfully perform duties as a C-sUAS operator.  This AFJQS serves as a roadmap to plan and 
record all C-sUAS duty-position related training, and as a basis for developing a Master Training 
Plan (MTP) and Individual Training Plan (ITP).  This AFJQS must be utilized at all installations 
with C-sUAS equipment and may be supplemented to capture unique requirements not common 
across the Total Force.  This AFJQS will remain in effect until superseded or rescinded. 
 
2.  TASK QUALIFICATION.  Personnel will be qualified to the GO/NO GO standard on this 
AFJQS.  GO means the individual can perform the task without assistance utilizing appropriate 
instructions or other procedural guidance.  If required training listed in Part II of this AFJQS is 
provided through OJT, in-residence, distance learning (DL), or web-based courses, a supervisor/ 
trainer from that respective functional area and/or a supervisor/trainer assigned as the C-sUAS 
program manager or C-sUAS Training Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) will 
complete the trainer’s block to document training completion.  In order to be awarded the C-
sUAS operator SEI 3CS, individuals must be trained and certified on all requirements identified 
with a single asterisk “*” in the critical task column in Part II of the AFJQS.  Explanations for 
the various Part II Tabs of this AFJQS are as follows: 
 
a.  PART II – TAB ONE.  AFJQS C-SUAS INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT).  
Tasks under this tab are accomplished through completion of a Department of the Air Force 
(DAF) C-sUAS Formal Training Unit (FTU), or an approved Military Department, vendor, or 
unit C-sUAS IQT for a specific C-sUAS technology.  System-specific C-sUAS IQTs are 
categorized by the C-sUAS platform type (Command and Control (C2); Fixed-Site; 
Mobile/Mounted; Containerized/ Portable; Handheld/Dismounted; and Aerial).  The tasks in this 
tab only indicate the result of an individual’s successful completion of a C-sUAS IQT for a 
specific system.  For award of the C-sUAS operator SEI 3CS, individuals must successfully 
2 
 
complete a C-sUAS IQT listed in this tab.  Not all C-sUAS IQTs are SEI-awarding, refer to the 
Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) for the approved SEI-awarding C-sUAS 
IQTs.  Completion of a C-sUAS IQT identified in this tab is a prerequisite for the C-sUAS 
operator tasks in Part II – Tab 2 of this AFJQS.  
 
b.  PART II – TAB TWO.  AFJQS C-sUAS OPERATOR TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  
The tasks in this tab indicate C-sUAS operator tasks to be incorporated into a unit’s MTP and C-
sUAS mission qualification training (MQT)/C-sUAS Phase II training.  These tasks are required 
for standardization evaluation (Stan Eval) Phase II assessments for certification in the critical 
duty position of a C-sUAS operator.  Sections 1 through 10 of this tab of the AFJQS indicate the 
core C-sUAS operator tasks required regardless of the C-sUAS IQT completed.  Sections 11 
through 15 of this tab are the C-sUAS Operations/Battle Drills specific to the applicable C-sUAS 
platforms and C-sUAS IQT courses listed in Part II – Tab 1 of this AFJQS.  The C-sUAS tasks 
in this tab combined with the tasks identified in Part II – Tab 1 of this AFJQS are required for 
award of C-sUAS SEI 3CS.  Refer to the AFECD for the approved SEI-awarding C-sUAS IQT 
courses.  Completion of a C-sUAS IQT course identified in Part II – Tab 1 is a prerequisite for 
the C-sUAS operator tasks in this tab.   
 
3.  TRAINING DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINER/CERTIFIER IDENTIFICATION.  
Document training required by this AFJQS in accordance with DAFI 36-2670 and any 
automated learning management system (LMS) procedural guides.  For civilians, document 
civilian training on supervisor’s employee brief (or equivalent) in accordance with AFI 36-129, 
Civilian Personnel Management and Administration.  All trainers authorized to sign off tasks in 
Part II of this AFJQS will be identified in the identification block of this AFJQS.  In accordance 
with DAFI 36-2670, paragraph 4.6.2.2.2., core tasks in this AFJQS are defined as those tasks 
requiring third-party certification.  All tasks identified on this AFJQS require third-party 
certification for the trainee to be certified.  Certifiers will provide third-party certification and 
evaluation IAW DAFI 36-2670, paragraph 4.6.7.3.  If a military or civilian trainee is assigned an 
additional duty or task not included in an individual’s CFETP or this AFJQS, the supervisor will 
add the task(s) to the MTP and ITP. 
 
4.  ADDITIONAL DUTY or TASK.  If a C-sUAS operator is assigned an additional duty or task 
not listed in this AFJQS, the supervisor will develop an AF Form 797, Job Qualification 
Standard Continuation/Command JQS or equivalent.  The supervisor, trainer, or C-sUAS 
program manager will then develop an ITP for the individual to receive training and become 
duty position certified.  
 
5.  RECERTIFYING.  For tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, 
supervisors/trainers/certifiers will employ the evaluate-train-evaluate process to recertify 
personnel on tasks.  Recertification is not required unless there is a break in the AFJQS task for 
more than 366 consecutive calendar days. This does not negate the requirement for military and 
civilian members to undergo annual or otherwise required duty position evaluations, ensuring 
members are proficient on AFJQS tasks.

6.  This AFJQS has been coordinated with all applicable CFMs and MFMs.  The overall POC for 
this AFJQS is AFSFC/S3T AFSFC.S3T.Training@us.af.mil.
