This manual and Department of the Air Force (DAF) Manual (DAFMAN) 13-201, Airspace 
Management, implement Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 13-2, Air Traffic, Airfield, Airspace, 
and Range Management. This manual also implements Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 
1322.27, DoD Urban Training Facilities, and DoDI 3200.21, Sustaining Access to the Live 
Training Domain. This publication applies to Department of the Air Force civilian employees and 
uniformed members of the Regular Air Force, the Air Force Reserve, and the Air National Guard 
(ANG).  This publication does not apply to the United States Space Force (USSF).  It provides 
guidance for the planning, operations, management, safety, equipment, facilities, and security of 
Air Force ranges covered by this manual (see Attachment 2). Refer recommended changes and 
questions about this publication to the office of primary responsibility using the DAF Form 847, 
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route DAF Forms 847 from the field through the 
appropriate functional chain of command. See paragraph 1.4 for guidance on supplementing this 
manual.  The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified 
with a tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See DAFMAN  90-
161, Publishing Processes and Procedures, Table A10.1, for a description of the authorities 
associated with the tier numbers. Waivers to this manual are authorized and are processed in 
accordance with DAFMAN 90-161.  For compliance items not identified with a tier number, 
waiver authority is delegated to the Headquarters Air Force Operational Training Infrastructure 
Division (AF/A3TI).  Waivers for non-tiered and T-0 compliance items must be coordinated 
through the major command (MAJCOM) before they are submitted to AF/A3TI for action. T-0 
compliance items are those imposed by law, DoD policy, or an external organization (e.g., the 
2 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
FAA).  While AF/A3TI will take T-0 waiver requests for action, it is possible the waiver may not 
be granted. T-1, T-2, and T-3 waivers automatically expire 30 days after a change of command 
unless the new commander renews the waiver. At the unit level, the range operating authority 
should monitor implementation of this manual and review approved waivers anytime the 
circumstances that prompted the waiver or the impacts of the excepted activity change 
substantially. Submit waiver requests on the DAF Form 679, Department of the Air Force 
Publication  Compliance Item Waiver Request/Approval, through the chain of command to the 
appropriate tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the publication office of primary 
responsibility   for non-tiered compliance items (see paragraph 1.3 for additional information).  
Ensure all records generated as a result of processes prescribed in this publication adhere to Air 
Force Instruction (AFI) 33-322, Records Management and Information Governance Program, and 
are disposed in accordance with (IAW) the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, which is 
located in the Air Force Records Information Management System.  Compliance with the 
attachments is mandatory.  The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial 
product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Department 
of the Air Force. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This document has been substantially revised and requires a complete review. Tiering and 
compliance statements have been updated IAW Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the 
Air Force (SAF/AA) recommendations. Implementing language from DoDI 3200.21 has been 
incorporated. Additionally, responsibilities for the Air Force Installation and Mission Support 
Center (AFIMSC) and the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) have been added, and the 
requirement for individual comprehensive range plans has been eliminated.

INTRODUCTION 
1.1.  Purpose.  This manual provides guidance for commanders to operate assigned ranges safely, 
effectively, and efficiently to meet training and test requirements while minimizing potential 
effects on the environment and the surrounding communities. 
1.2.  Scope. 
1.2.1.  This manual applies to all Air Force-operated air and ground ranges listed in 
Attachment 2. These ranges are part of the Air Force’s Operational Training and Test 
Infrastructure.  Space-launch activities are not covered by this manual.  Small arms training 
ranges are addressed in AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms Program, and are not covered by this 
manual.  Stand-alone Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) ranges are covered under AFMAN 
32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program, and Defense Explosives Safety Regulation 
(DESR) 6055.09_ AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, and are not covered in this 
publication. Air Force-operated air and ground ranges outside of the United States will comply 
with the provisions of all applicable international agreements, this manual, Department of 
Defense Directive (DoDD) 4715.12, Environmental and Explosives Safety Management on 
Operational Ranges Outside the United States, DoDI 4715.22, Environmental Management 
Policy for Contingency Locations, AFI 32-7091, Environmental Management Outside  the

Force organizations conducting range activities, as defined in Title 10 of United States Code 
(U.S.C.) Section (§) 101(e) (2), at locations other than those listed in Attachment 2 must 
contact the publication office of primary responsibility (through the parent major command 
[MAJCOM]) for a coverage review unless one or more of the criteria listed in the following 
subparagraphs are met: (T-1) 
1.2.2.1.  The activity is specifically excluded in paragraph 1.2.1. 
1.2.2.2.  The activity is conducted at an operational range operated by another military 
service, federal agency, or a host nation, IAW the rules and procedures established by the  
organization operating the range. Note: While this manual only applies to Air Force-
operated ranges, ranges operated by non-Air Force entities that are located on Air Force 
real property (e.g., test sites located on an Air Force installation) shall comply with 
applicable                    portions of this manual via a host-tenant agreement to ensure safety 
and stewardship of Air Force property. IAW AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air 
Force Real Property, when the Air Force grants the right of exclusive or non-exclusive use 
of Air Force real property to a non-Federal agency a license is required; when granted to 
another  Federal agency a permit is required. 
1.2.2.3.  The activity requires airspace only (no land or water surface component), and is 
conducted IAW Air Force, Department of Defense (DoD), and Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) or applicable host nation airspace regulations. 
1.2.2.4.  The activity consists of training involving drop zones and/or landing zones, and is 
conducted in accordance with DAFMAN 13-217, Drop Zone, Landing Zone, and 
Helicopter Landing Zone Operations. 
6

Chapter 3 
COMPREHENSIVE RANGE PLANNING 
3.1.  Comprehensive Range Planning.  Comprehensive range planning is accomplished to 
ensure training and testing requirements are met. This process evaluates range requirements 
against current and projected capabilities to identify shortfalls and to guide sustainable range 
development to mitigate shortfalls. This manual and a hierarchy of plans provide the policy and 
guidance that documents the current sustainment and future range development. 
3.1.1.  Operational Test and Training Infrastructure Flight Plan. AF/A3TI drafts and publishes 
the Operational Test and Training Infrastructure Flight Plan. Since ranges are part of the Air 
Force’s operational training infrastructure, the Operational Test and Training Infrastructure 
Flight Plan provides the long-term strategic vision and direction for Air Force ranges. The plan 
establishes a vision of a realistic, integrated training environment that allows forces to train  
mission relevant employment schemes to achieve and sustain full-spectrum readiness. It also 
describes the long-term operational test and training infrastructure requirements to achieve the 
vision set forth in the 2015 Strategic Master Plan and Air Force Future Operating Concept. 
3.1.2.  Enterprise Range Plan.  AF/A3TI will produce a Range Capabilities Development Plan 
in coordination with the MAJCOMs. The plan should have a 10-year planning horizon and 
support achievement of the vision established in the Operational Training Infrastructure Flight 
Plan. 
3.1.2.1.  AF/A3TI will ensure the Range Capabilities Development Plan identifies the 
current mission of each  range and the range requirements. This includes detailing 
necessary test and training capabilities as well as specifying training requirements for 
assigned users. It should compare current and known future requirements against the 
current range capabilities to identify shortfalls and describe investment actions. 
3.1.2.2.  Range Capabilities Development Plan development provides an opportunity for 
all MAJCOM organizations and staff to provide input, coordinate actions within the 
command, and across MAJCOMs. 
3.1.2.3.  The Range Capabilities Development Plan shall take into consideration climate 
change-related risks and opportunities (e.g., sea level rise, shifts in precipitation, increases 
in droughts or floods, increases in severe weather events and temperature). Authoritative 
climate data will be obtained from the 14th Weather Squadron (https://climate.af.mil). 
3.1.3.  Air Force Training Requirements. Range training support requirements are based on the 
Mission Design Series (MDS), Designed Operational Capability statement missions, and 
training events of the assigned units. The Ready Aircrew Program (RAP), Major Weapon 
System Volume 1, training publications and syllabi normally provide the specific events that 
require range support. Attachments 3 and 4, “Range Supported Mission Design Series Training 
Events” and “Assigned Range Users and Training Events,” are a compilation of the applicable 
events, required range capability and infrastructure for each specific training event and are 
based on current practices. The MDS-specific figures in Attachment 4 list the units, equipped 
with that particular MDS, that normally utilize specific ranges and the various training events 
that they may conduct on those specific ranges.  A unit being listed in one or more of the figures 
in Attachment 4 does not imply priority for access to, or scheduling on, those specific ranges; 
24 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
nor does a unit not being listed in those figures imply that the unit does not have access to those 
specific ranges.  Access to a specific range should be coordinated between the unit leadership 
and the respective range operating authority.  As MDS, mission types or training events, and/or 
tactics, techniques, and procedures change to meet emerging threats and technologies, the 
MAJCOM Realistic Training Review Boards are instituted to maximize the quality of unit 
training and convene (usually annually) to update training events, frequency, and standards. 
3.1.3.1.  At a minimum, MAJCOMs shall biennially review applicable portions of the 
Combat Air Forces, Mobility Air Forces, and Special Operations Forces Realistic Training 
Review Board recommendations; range user assignments; the range-supported MDS 
events; and other applicable training requirements documents. Following the review, the 
MAJCOMs, through ACC as the lead MAJCOM, will provide AF/A3TI with inputs on 
recommended changes to Attachments 3 and 4. 
3.1.3.1.1.  The biennial review should ensure a specific range has been tasked to 
support each specific training event and that it has the required capability to do so. 
MAJCOMs must support shortfalls necessitating a change to assigned users, or 
capability and infrastructure investments based on the published data. 
3.1.3.1.2.  User-event assignments should consider geographic proximity as well as the 
scope and attributes required for the assigned event. Units will not be assigned to more 
than one range for the same training event. 
3.1.3.1.3.  When a MAJCOM does not have an adequate or close-proximity range to 
support one of its units, the MAJCOM will engage other range-owning MAJCOMs and 
services for support and assignment of their units. If the shortfall cannot be serviced, 
the proponent MAJCOM will submit a T/TSNS to AF/A3TI for resolution. 
3.1.3.1.4.  During the biennial review, MAJCOMs should review test and training 
requirements to determine the live and synthetic mix and if changes to range 
requirements are needed. This drives a continuous modernization process that meets 
test objectives, increases combat realism, aids tactics development, enhances day-to- 
day training, and moves toward a balanced and appropriate live and synthetic mix. 
3.1.3.2.  Non-Air Force Training Requirements at PTRs. Support of non-Air Force unit 
training events on Air Force ranges is often based on historical agreements and/or related 
to basing decisions. This support may establish additional range financial obligations and 
requirements and range operating authorities must document this with a written agreement 
as outlined in paragraph 4.2. (T-1) 
3.1.3.2.1.  The range operating authority, in coordination with the MAJCOM, will 
identify the specific events, training priority, and related range capabilities and 
infrastructure needed to support the training (T-2); and will determine if the range has 
the capacity to support the event(s) while continuing to meet its obligations to the 
assigned Air Force users. (T-2) 
3.1.3.2.2.  If additional operating hours, capabilities, equipment or infrastructure are 
necessary to support the training, the range operating authority will document those 
costs in the written agreement and coordinate for reimbursement as authorized IAW 
paragraph 4.2. (T-1) Ranges will not assume training that incurs additional costs to 
support users that have not been assigned to them in this manual, unless documented 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
25 
in a written agreement which has been approved by the range-operating MAJCOM and 
AF/A3TI. (T-1) 
3.1.3.3.  Training Priority at PTRs. Priority is normally determined by the range- operating 
Wing. The range-operating Wing and individual ranges should schedule effectively to 
adequately support each assigned user in the assigned event as well as non- Air Force users 
who have entered into a written agreement for support. Ranges are authorized to provide 
range access and training support on a space-available basis to non- assigned units, but 
those units should not normally have priority above assigned users. 
3.1.3.4.  Training-Support Requirements at MRTFB Ranges. IAW DoDD 3200.11, Major 
Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), the MRTFB may be used by DoD users and by 
users outside the Department such as United States Government Agencies, State and local 
governments, allied foreign governments, and commercial entities for training events. 
Users must clearly articulate training requirements to determine the level of support needed 
and the priority of the activity. 
3.1.3.5.  Training Priority at MRTFB Ranges. IAW DoDD 3200.11, scheduling of the 
MRTFB is based upon a priority system that gives equitable consideration to all DoD 
Components and accommodates DoD acquisition program priorities. The Test Resource 
Management Center implements the composition, sizing, and usage for the MRTFB. 
Priority for training operations on MRTFB ranges is coordinated at the local level through 
a robust scheduling and prioritization process that takes into account both test and training 
requirements needed to support all users. 
3.1.3.6.  Range Test-Support Requirements. Test requirements are based on the 
characteristics and attributes of the specific test and are governed by departmental and 
service-level directives and instructions. MAJCOMs, acquisition programs, SAF/AQ, and 
AF/TE collaboratively define the test requirements and the resources necessary to support 
them. 
3.1.4.  Test and Training Resource Programs. Test and training requirements are funded 
through a combination of institutional funds and reimbursements and/or customer fees at 
MRTFB ranges. Test and training resource funding is managed through Air Force and other 
DoD unique PEs. Execution is accomplished by various Air Force field activities. 
Headquarters Air Force Test and Evaluation Policy, Programs, and Resources Division 
(AF/TEP) provides test and evaluation resource oversight and guidance to the MRTFB ranges 
through the parent MAJCOM. AF/A3TI provides training resource oversight and guidance to 
MRTFB ranges and together with the ANG, Air Space and Ranges Division (NGB 
A2/3/6/10YR) to PTRs. 
3.1.4.1.  Aligning and Deconflicting Test and Training Requirements. Within the Air 
Force, the investments needed for test requirements may also be needed for training, and 
vice versa. Infrastructure investments at MRTFB ranges are planned and allocated through 
different processes, PEs and special access programs. It is imperative to avoid redundancy 
and gain synergy by closely aligning and deconflicting test and training requirements. 
3.1.4.1.1.  Training O&M. PE 27604 and PE 52634 fund PTR O&M, and are 
programmed by ACC and NGB A2/3/6/10YR (respectively) through the Air Force 
Operational Training and Readiness (OT&R) Panel.  Individual MAJCOMs execute 
26 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
funding in these PEs  for their assigned ranges. The program funds range contracts, 
certain range personnel and O&M of range capabilities. It also funds technical and 
service contracts to maintain operating hours and the basic infrastructure for scoring 
activities, threat and debrief systems, data link capabilities and other range services 
such as road maintenance and range clean up. 
3.1.4.1.2.  Nevada Test and Training Range and Utah Test and Training Range O&M. 
PE 27428 funds Nevada Test and Training Range and Utah Test and Training Range 
O&M, and is programmed by ACC through the Air Force Operational Training and 
Readiness (OT&R) Panel. ACC is also the executing agent for this program. The 
program funds range contracts, certain range personnel, and O&M of range 
capabilities, technical and service contracts to maintain operating hours and the basic 
infrastructure for scoring activities, telemetry, threat, and debrief systems, data link 
capabilities and other range services such as road maintenance and range clean up. 
3.1.4.1.3.  Foreign military use of air-to-air/air-to-ground training ranges/airspace must 
be coordinated with appropriate country offices within SAF/IA, AF/A3TI, Air Force 
Security Assistance Training, MAJCOM offices supporting the foreign partner 
(MAJCOM/IA for Foreign Military Sales, A4 for Acquisition and Cross-Service 
Agreements, etc.), and MAJCOM staff Range and Airspace Operations authorities.  As 
part of the coordination and approval process, MAJCOM offices supporting the foreign 
partner will coordinate with MAJCOM respective finance and Range and Airspace 
authorities (contract program managers) to determine the range/airspace usage fees 
which will include all direct and indirect costs to include, but not limited to:  range 
contracts, certain range personnel performing O&M of range capabilities, technical and 
service contracts to maintain operating hours and the basic infrastructure for 
targets/scoring activities, telemetry, threat and debrief systems, data link capabilities, 
and other range services such as range clean-up.  This level of coordination is done 
with the intent to satisfy the Arms Export Control Act provision of no cost to the U.S. 
government. 
3.1.4.2.  Improvements/Investments. 
3.1.4.2.1.  Test and Training Space. Test and training space attributes accommodate 
missions based on tactics, techniques, and procedures and event requirements. When 
range operating authorities/MAJCOMs project a unit readiness decline due to a 
deficiency or gap in range capabilities, MAJCOMs should first attempt to shift the unit 
assignment to a range with the required capability, or submit a T/TSNS to meet the 
shortfall. 
3.1.4.2.1.1.  Actions involving the fielding of new capabilities, changes in land use 
or the acquisition of new land or airspace typically generate long-term sustainment 
costs, environmental impacts, and public interest. Therefore, any action to 
establish, modify, or delete test/training space except those purely administrative 
in nature (i.e., changes that do not impact the capabilities or capacity of the range), 
must be reviewed by units, MAJCOMs, and Headquarters Air Force via the 
T/TSNS process detailed in AFI 13-201. (T-1) Examples of actions requiring a 
T/TSNS include:  acquiring new land or airspace; lowering the minimum altitude 
of a Military Operations Area; fielding a new capability with a recurring 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
27 
sustainment cost; moving or establishing a live munitions area. Equipment 
replacement governed by a program office does not require a T/TSNS. Actions that 
only impact ANG equipment purchased with National Guard and Reserve 
Equipment Account funds do not require a T/TSNS. 
3.1.4.2.1.1.1.  Requests from non-Air Force entities to move onto an Air Force 
range must be vetted through the Strategic Basing Process as defined in AFI 
10-503, Strategic Basing. Additionally, approved non-Air Force tenants 
desiring to increase their manpower by 35 or more positions must also receive 
approval from the Air Force Strategic Basing Process. 
3.1.4.2.1.1.2.  Range operating authorities and MAJCOMs must follow the 
guidelines and approval process established in DoDI 3200.18, Management and 
Operation of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), for any 
changes/closures to MRTFB ranges that affect the MRTFB capabilities or 
capacity. (T-0) 
3.1.4.2.1.1.3.  For proposals involving expansion of range boundaries, whether 
permanent or otherwise, range operating authorities and MAJCOMs must also 
coordinate the T/TSNS with the AFCEC Military Munitions Response Program 
office to identify conflicts and impacts related to current or projected Air Force 
Military Munitions Response Program projects. (T-1) 
3.1.4.2.1.2.  Airspace and Land Actions. 
3.1.4.2.1.2.1.  Airspace. When establishing a need for new airspace, proponents 
must ensure they comply with AFI 13-201 and applicable FAA Orders and 
Directives. (T-0) 
3.1.4.2.1.2.2.  Land Acquisition. Land acquisitions require lead times as long 
as 7 years. There are a variety of mechanisms for acquiring land. Examples 
include traditional buy/lease transactions, or withdrawal under the Federal Land 
Policy and Management Act (see also “Land Withdrawal” in terms section of 
Attachment 1). Once the T/TSNS is approved, AF/A3TI will work with the 
proponent and the Deputy Assistant Secretary, Installations (SAF/IEI) to pursue 
the correct mechanism. 
3.1.4.2.1.2.3.  Closing or Transferring Ranges. MRTFB ranges must follow 
Office of the Secretary of Defense processes before reducing or eliminating 
capability IAW DoDI 3200.18. (T-0) For PTRs and non-MRTFB ranges, when 
declared in excess to the range requirements by the range operating authority, 
the MAJCOM and AF/A3TI, the land will be surface cleared IAW Air Force 
standards. (T-1) The range operating authority will notify the supporting CE 
unit with real property responsibility of the excess status for subsequent action 
to determine a new use and accomplish required clearance for the new use. (T-
1) It is Air Force policy to clear to a level deemed safe for the proposed future 
land use and issue Certificates of Clearance for excess ranges or ranges 
converted to other uses but remaining on the installation property inventory. 
The supporting CE unit will ensure clearance IAW DoDI 3200.16 Operational 
Range Clearance (ORC), excess declaration IAW AFI 32-9004, Disposal of 
28 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
Real Property, and National Environmental Policy Act actions IAW 32 CFR 
Part 989. (T-0) Return, or partial return, of overseas ranges operated or 
maintained by United States personnel or forces to host nation control is 
conducted IAW DoDI 4165.69, Realignment of DoD Sites Overseas. (T-0) 
Airspace transfer is IAW AFI 13-201, and range operating authorities must 
ensure disposition of government-owned range equipment and facilities is IAW 
MAJCOM guidance. (T-2) 
3.1.4.2.2.  Range Equipment and Infrastructure. Range equipment and infrastructure 
provide instrumentation for numerous functions, including test and evaluation, 
readiness training, tactics development and evaluation, command and control, safety, 
and real-time flight monitoring. Ideally, these systems provide precise monitoring and 
reconstruction, and facilitate post-mission debriefing of range users for various mission 
sets (i.e., single or multiple aircraft, ground training, and test missions), to include 
reactions to air defense threats, live or simulated ordnance exchanges, and realistic 
simulations of the projected threat environment. The requirement for continuous 
modernization of these systems drives investments in this area. 
3.1.4.2.2.1.  Test Equipment and Infrastructure. The Test Investment Planning and 
Programming Process provides the venue for investing in test infrastructure. 
Headquarters AFMC/A3 manages the Air Force Test Investment Planning and 
Programming Process to identify test resource investments needed to support 
military systems testing. Those investments that have possible multi-service 
applicability may be referred to the Central Test and Evaluation Investment 
Program for funding. 
3.1.4.2.2.2.  Training Equipment and Infrastructure. When a range projects that 
equipment or infrastructure deficiencies will prohibit them from supporting an 
assigned training event or an emerging requirement, the range operating authority 
should coordinate with the MAJCOM to have the mission reassigned, arrange for 
O&M funding, or coordinate acquisition of the required equipment or infrastructure 
with the lead MAJCOM (ACC). AFSOC may seek funding that supports Special 
Operations Forces-unique training and has Special Operations Forces sustainment. 
In these cases, AFSOC will coordinate with the lead MAJCOM if it affects other 
Air Force range users. (T-1) All equipment or materials purchased for ANG range 
operations with state or National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account funds will 
remain with the State when and if the range real property is reassigned. (T-0) 
3.1.4.2.2.2.1.  The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center / Range Systems 
Division (AFLCMC/HBZ) and the Air Combat Command, Ranges Branch 
(ACC/A3AR) shall address improvement of existing CTS using feedback from 
equipment users, jointly establishing priorities for future efforts, developing 
solutions to reliability and maintainability problems, and providing                 
updates concerning on-going efforts. 
3.1.4.2.2.2.2.  Headquarters ACC is the lead agency for procurement and life-
cycle fleet management of instrumentation, threat systems, and test/training 
range engineering development supporting Combat Air Forces requirements. 
3.1.4.2.2.2.3.  The Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center will  
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
29 
coordinate on Combat Air Forces requirements that need operational test and 
evaluation input or may affect Operational Test and Evaluation as well as 
Developmental Test and Evaluation, and Expeditionary Force Experiments.  
The Air Force Joint Test Program Office will coordinate on directed Combat 
Air Forces requirements that need Joint Test and Evaluation IAW DAFI 99-
106, Joint Test and Evaluation Program. (T-1) 
3.1.4.2.2.2.4.  Headquarters ACC/A3A will develop and maintain an 
equipment inventory and configuration control system, as part of the Enterprise 
Range Plan. It should accurately inventory, track equipment, and document the 
configuration and threat lay-down plan of threat emitters and simulators used 
for training. 
3.1.4.2.2.2.5.  The reallocation of threat systems will be coordinated by 
Headquarters ACC/A3A with the affected MAJCOM(s) and AF/A3TI, with 
AF/A3 arbitrating any disputes. Note: This paragraph is not intended to apply 
to maintenance-related movements, such as transfers to/from depot. 
3.1.4.2.2.3.  Requests for Disposition of Equipment. Range operating authorities 
must obtain MAJCOM approval to deactivate, transfer or decommission any range 
Combat Training System. (T-2) All CTS deactivation/decommission and final 
disposition requests will be approved by the parent MAJCOM and Headquarters 
ACC with AF/A3TI arbitrating any disputes. This does not apply to Test and 
Evaluation equipment on MRTFB ranges which is managed IAW DoDI 3200.18. 
3.1.4.2.2.4.  Urban Training Facilities. Constructing or upgrading semi-permanent  
and permanent urban training facilities, as defined and covered in DoDI 1322.27, 
requires advance coordination. The parent MAJCOM will evaluate proposals. 
Proposals which are funded via Military Construction (MILCON) funding also 
require certification by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness 
(USD (P&R)). Range operating authorities shall submit proposal information (to 
include the items listed in Enclosure 3 of DoDI 1322.27) through the parent 
MAJCOM and ACC to AF/A3TI prior to initiating development or procurement of 
these capabilities. (T-0) AFSOC may submit proposals directly to AF/A3TI for 
projects that support Special Operations Forces-unique training and have Special 
Operations Forces sustainment. AF/A3TI will consult with Office of the Secretary 
of Defense, as appropriate, to identify evaluation and certification requirements for 
the proposal.

Chapter 4 
RANGE OPERATIONS AND SAFETY 
4.1.  Range Operations.  Range operating authorities will ensure that range operations are 
conducted IAW this manual, DoDD 4715.11, Environmental and Explosives Safety Management 
on Operational Ranges Within the United States, AFI 13-201, AFI 11-214, DESR 
6055.09_AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, Technical Order (TO) 1-1M-34, Aircrew 
Weapons Delivery Manual, TO 1-1M-34-1, Aircrew Weapons Delivery Manual (classified), 
aircraft specific weapons delivery TOs, aircraft specific AFI 11-2 Mission Design Series, and 
United States Air Force Weapons School instructional texts. For ranges outside of the United 
States, range operating authorities must also ensure operations are conducted IAW DoDD 4715.12, 
DoDI 4715.22, and AFI 32-7091, whichever apply. For operations involving ground weapons, 
range operators should consult AFI 36-2654 (as applicable); weapons system TOs; test-specific 
procedures, and/or specific SDZ profiles for the types of operations and weapons used. 
4.2.  Written Agreements.  AFI 25-201 details the required procedures for entering into written 
agreements. Range operating authorities should closely coordinate with the MAJCOM any time 
the range is agreeing to provide support to an unassigned range user and a written agreement is 
required. DoDD 3200.11 and DoDI 5000.89_DAFI 99-103 address the written agreements and 
documentation for  test support. Range operating authorities will ensure that all written agreements 
are maintained IAW AFI 33-322 and are disposed IAW the Air Force Records Disposition 
Schedule. (T-1) All agreements pertinent to their range should be readily available to range 
personnel and users. 
4.2.1.  Types of Written Agreements. 
4.2.1.1.  Support Agreement (DD Form 1144).  In accordance with AFI 25-201, range 
operating authorities must use the DD Form 1144, Support Agreement, to document 
recurring reimbursable support when the Air Force is the supplier. (T-0) The range 
operating authority, in coordination with the MAJCOM, shall complete an Inter-Service 
Support Agreement when providing training support to any other DoD component. 
Specifically, an Inter-Service Support Agreement is required when a non-Air Force user 
from another DoD Component requests more than 12 days of range use per calendar year. 
(T-1) 
4.2.1.1.1.  Ranges may entertain requests and discuss user requirements with any non- 
Air Force user, but the range operating authority will coordinate and receive approval 
from the MAJCOM prior to entering into any agreement for support of non-Air Force 
training events that require commitment of additional resources. (T-2) 
4.2.1.1.2.  Written support agreements are not required for occasional/limited use or 
during Air Force-sponsored exercises, deployments, evaluations, or inspections. 
4.2.1.2.  Memorandum of Understanding. A memorandum of understanding defines 
general areas of understanding between two or more parties, when reimbursement is not 
required. It neither includes commitment of resources nor binds a party to a specific action. 
Individual units normally author memorandums of understanding and coordinate them with 
the parent MAJCOM. Ensure memorandums of understanding involving other nations are 
reviewed by the MAJCOM Judge Advocate and the State Department Mission in the host 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
31 
country for legal implications. See DoDI 4000.19, Support Agreements, Section 4, for 
memorandum of understanding content and format requirements. 
4.2.1.3.  Memorandum of Agreement. Memorandums of agreement document the specific 
terms and responsibilities that two or more parties agree to in writing, especially those that 
involve reimbursement or financial obligations (but without the recurring   requirement 
which drives an AF Form 7600A).  It includes either a commitment of resources or binds 
a party to a specific action. Individual units normally author memorandums of agreement 
and coordinate them with the parent MAJCOM. Ensure memorandums of agreement 
involving other nations are reviewed by the MAJCOM Judge Advocate and Financial 
Management, and the State Department Mission in the host country for legal and financial 
implications. See DoDI 4000.19, Section 4, for memorandum of agreement content and 
format requirements. 
4.2.2.  Written Agreements for Test and Evaluation Activities. DoDI 5000.89_DAFI 99-103 
details the extensive documentation processes required for test and evaluation activities. 
MRTFB ranges may enter into written agreements via formal documentation and coordination 
at the range operating authority level. 
4.2.3.  Foreign User Training Support Agreements. Foreign users will submit written requests 
for range support through appropriate country offices within SAF/IA to AF/A3TI. AF/A3TI 
will coordinate with the appropriate MAJCOM to determine the level of support and to 
integrate the support requirement into the range mission. The MAJCOM will then task the 
range operating authority to develop the agreement resulting in a memorandum of 
understanding or memorandum of agreement between the range and appropriate foreign 
authority. These agreements may also include specific letters of agreement, a Host-Tenant 
Support Agreements, other support agreements detailed on an AF Form 7600A and/or Foreign 
Military Sales Letter of Offer and Acceptance. Each signatory ensures that these agreements 
meet the needs of the organization without compromising the mission and obligating the 
organization beyond its intent or authority and are consistent with any applicable international 
agreements with the host nation. Range operating authorities will coordinate the draft 
agreement with the MAJCOM Office of the Staff Judge Advocate. (T-1) If a conflict arises 
regarding one of these agreements, the range operating authority should resolve the issue at the 
appropriate level. 
4.3.  Joint Use of Ranges.  Joint use of ranges will be established by the appropriate written 
agreement(s), license, contract or other written test documentation between the range operating 
authority or test authority (in coordination with the MAJCOM) and the joint user IAW AFI 25-
201 or test instructions. (T-1) All written agreements should ensure the range operating authority 
can terminate user activities detrimental to the range’s natural, cultural, or physical infrastructure 
and obtain compensation or redress. 
4.3.1.  Use of Air Force Ranges for Non-Air Force Contract Air Support. PTRs can only be 
used by contract air support providers when it is in support of a DoD contract. MRTFB ranges 
may be used by contract air support providers when supporting a non-DoD contract (e.g., 
contracts supporting other United States Government Agencies, State, or local governments, 
allied foreign governments, or commercial entities). When use of an Air Force range by a 
contract air support provider in support of another service’s contract is requested, the other 
32 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
service’s Technical Airworthiness Authority must provide confirmation that an airworthiness 
assessment has been conducted and a flight release has been issued. 
4.3.1.1.  When another service requests use of an Air Force range for their contracted air 
support, the range parent MAJCOM must verify the aircraft status (civil aircraft operations 
or public aircraft operations) with the other service’s Technical Airworthiness Authority 
prior to allowing the contractor to operate on an Air Force range. Note:  An aircraft must 
be in public aircraft operations status in order to drop ordnance on a range and have an                   
approved WDZ footprint, WDZ surrogate footprint, or waiver. 
4.3.1.2.  If a Combatant Command has contracted air support for another service’s training 
(e.g., if USSOCOM contracts air support for Navy Seal training) and requests  use of an 
Air Force range, the range parent MAJCOM must verify the aircraft status (civil aircraft 
operations/public aircraft operations) with the supported service’s (the service that is 
receiving the training) Technical Airworthiness Authority prior to allowing the contractor 
to operate on an Air Force range. Combatant Commands do not have a Technical 
Airworthiness Authority; therefore, the service receiving the support must act as the 
Technical Airworthiness Authority. Note: For assistance with verifying airworthiness, 
contact the Air Force Technical Airworthiness Authority, AFLCMC/EN-EZZ, at 
USAF.Airworthiness.Office@us.af.mil.  For the Army, contact USARMY CCDC 
AVMC, and for the Navy contact USN NAWCAD. 
4.4.  Shared Use of Ranges. 
4.4.1.  Shared Use for Test and Training Activities. Range operating authorities will address 
user requirements and scheduling to develop a priority policy. (T-3) In many instances, a 
written agreement between the range scheduling office and assigned range users may be 
appropriate. 
4.4.1.1.  10 U.S.C. § 2681 authorizes the DoD to contract for the use of MRTFB resources 
by commercial entities. DoDD 3200.11 and DoDI 3200.18 provide guidance for these 
activities. Commercial activities on any range cannot compromise public safety, detract 
from mission accomplishment, nor impair range operations or scheduling in any way. 
Prioritization of MRTFB assets for commercial use is generally made available only on a 
non-interference basis. 
4.4.1.2.  PTRs are not designed or structured to accommodate test and evaluation activities 
as defined in DoDI 5000.89_DAFI 99-103. Should use of a PTR be necessary for test and 
evaluation activities, that cannot be accommodated by an MRTFB range, all applicable test 
and evaluation governing directives, instructions, safety and risk management procedures, 
necessary range enhancements, training, environmental impact analysis, additional 
personnel or upgrades required for the activity will be accomplished and complied with at 
the cost to the proponent. (T-1) Proponents must obtain approval from the range’s parent 
MAJCOM. (T-1) 
4.4.1.2.1.  Requests for performing test and evaluation activities on PTRs must be 
submitted to the parent MAJCOM and verify the following information: 
4.4.1.2.1.1.  That there are no scheduling impacts to the training mission of the 
range. 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
33 
4.4.1.2.1.2.  That there are no costs incurred by the range or the range O&M 
contractor, to include overtime. 
4.4.1.2.1.3.  That the test team(s) planned to use dedicated test facilities per DoDI 
5000.89_DAFI 99-103 but were deferred by the MRTFB due to capacity or other 
reasons. 
4.4.1.2.1.4.  That there are no planned permanent impacts to the range, i.e., the 
range will be returned to the same state as prior to the test. 
4.4.1.2.1.5.  That test activities are IAW the approved National Environmental 
Policy Act process developed for the range. 
4.4.1.2.1.6.  That the test team(s) is aware of the PTR’s capabilities (or lack of) and 
potential issues such as limited instrumentation, and that any associated impacts 
will not adversely affect the test. 
4.4.1.2.1.7.  That risk management is accomplished prior to conducting any portion 
of the test on the PTR. The tester must provide test-specific assessment to the range 
operating authority for consideration, and the range operating authority must 
determine whether the test activity can be safely conducted on their range. 
4.4.1.3.  IAW DoDD 3200.11, the MRTFB may be used by other DoD users, including 
DoD training users. 
4.4.2.  Shared Use for Activities other than Test and Training. Shared use of range land with 
non-DoD users is encouraged when it does not compromise public safety, detract from mission 
accomplishment, or impair range operations. IAW DESR 6055.09_AFMAN 91-201, 
Explosives Safety Standards, public access is prohibited in areas known or suspected to contain 
UXO or other munitions that have experienced abnormal environments. (T-0) Shared use is 
characterized as either concurrent or non-concurrent. 
4.4.2.1.  Concurrent Shared Use. Civil activities may occur concurrently with range 
operations provided human access is prohibited in the hazard area during operations. 
Agriculture, grazing and timber management are examples of activities that are conducive 
to concurrent shared use. 
4.4.2.1.1.  Grazing programs can be a complementary activity on Air Force ranges. 
Grazing programs are conducted IAW AFMAN 32-7003, Environmental 
Conservation. Grazing programs on Department of the Interior lands withdrawn for Air 
Force use are generally the responsibility of the Bureau of Land Management. IAW 
AFMAN 32-7003, the supporting CE unit must prepare an Integrated Natural 
Resources Management Plan that addresses all issues related to natural resources for 
all ranges. 
4.4.2.1.2.  Other Commercial Activities. Air Force ranges may also offer other 
commercial uses such as timber management, agricultural out-leasing, and mining. 
Again, many of these programs are generally the responsibility of the Bureau of Land 
Management. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management of the Department of Interior 
manages the oil and gas exploration on the outer continental shelf applicable to Air 
Force over-water ranges. For ranges located outside the United States, Combatant 
Command and in-theater Headquarters Air Force Component Command (e.g., USAFE-
34 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
AFAFRICA, PACAF, Air Forces Central Command), issuances may prohibit or 
restrict commercial uses. 
4.4.2.2.  Non-Concurrent Shared Use. Civil use of range land may be allowed within the 
hazard area (exclusive of areas known or suspected to contain UXO) IAW paragraph 
4.5.2 Recreation and education programs are often compatible because many ranges 
encompass large airspace, land, or water areas and may contain significant natural 
resources, wild areas, historical sites, or archaeological sites. As custodian of this public 
property, the Air Force has the responsibility to maintain it in the best manner possible 
consistent with the military mission. IAW AFI 32-7064, the supporting CE unit will ensure 
that range Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans address public access to natural 
resources. This plan is prepared in cooperation with the United States Fish and           
Wildlife Service and the state fish and game agency.   Additionally, the supporting CE unit 
will ensure that Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plans, IAW AFMAN 32-7003, 
address public restrictions to range areas containing, archaeological and cultural resources, 
including sacred sites. The range operating authority is the approval authority for all non-
concurrent shared use of range land. (T-2) 
4.4.2.3.  Enhanced Use Leases, out grants, leases, and easements. Normally Air Force 
ranges are not used for enhanced use leases, outgrants, leases, or easements, as they can 
encroach on or otherwise adversely impacts range activities and capabilities. However, if 
one of the real estate actions is deemed beneficial to the Air Force, the appropriate 
authority, as delegated by HAFMD 1-18, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force 
(Installations, Environment, and Energy), may enter into an agreement only after the 
installation commander, the range operating authority, the MAJCOM, and AF/A3TI              
coordinate on approval of the transaction. The range operating authority may deem an               
enhanced use lease compatible with range activity on a case-by-case basis, provided it does 
not adversely impact range capability (to include MRTFB capabilities).  Approval of 
enhanced use lease consideration should run from the range operating authority to the 
installation commander to the MAJCOM to AF/A3TI to SAF/IEI, in coordination with the 
Air Force Civil Engineering Center/Installations Directorate (AFCEC/CI). Range 
sustainment, repair, modernization, and other range facility investments shall be the 
primary objective for application of enhanced use lease proceeds derived from ranges. (T-
1) 
4.5.  Range Access.  MAJCOMs and range operating authorities will develop procedures for 
permitting and deconflicting ground party and non-military activities on the range. (T-1) Note: 
Where the terms “essential personnel,” and “mission essential personnel” are used below, 
reference the “Terms” section in Attachment 1 of this manual. 
4.5.1.  Warning Signs. In addition to the installation warning signs required by DAFI 31-101, 
Integrated Defense (CUI), range operating authorities will post safety warning signs (multi-
lingual where appropriate) on the range boundaries. (T-1) Refer to DAFMAN 91-203, Air 
Force Occupational Safety, Fire, and Health Standards, for sizing and general design criteria. 
Where practical, signs should include both text and pictograms/symbols describing the hazard. 
The type of sign (e.g., “Danger” or “Warning”) is selected based on the degree of hazard 
associated with range activities. Ranges conducting laser operations shall also post laser 
warning signs utilizing the signage guidance in Military Handbook 828C, Range Laser Safety. 
(T-1) For ranges located on another service’s/host nation’s property, and where another agency 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
35 
is responsible for range access, security and signage, the range operating authority may apply 
that service/nation’s rules, specified text, graphics, or procedures.  Range operating authorities 
will ensure signs required by this section are placed along the boundaries: (T-1) 
4.5.1.1.  Where crossed by roads, paths, trails, streams, streambeds, or railways. 
4.5.1.2.  At 200-meter intervals where roads, paths, trails, or railways parallel the range 
boundary within 500 meters. 
4.5.1.3.  At 1000-meter intervals in other readily accessible areas not included above. 
Note: Signs are not required in areas that are not readily accessible on foot or with wheeled 
vehicles (e.g., mountainous terrain, swamps, lakes). 
4.5.2.  Hazard Areas. The hazard area is a composite of all WDZs, SDZs, Laser SDZs, and 
Directed Energy WDZs for all authorized weapon delivery events and represents operational 
hazards as well as residual hazards following munitions deliveries. Hazard areas may be 
segmented based upon the targets, weapons, tactics, maintenance, or clearance being utilized 
or conducted at a given time. If hazard areas are segmented, range operating authorities will 
ensure segment borders are readily identifiable by ground personnel. (T-3) Access during 
operations into the hazard area is limited to mission essential personnel, unless specifically 
authorized by the range operating authority. During intentional detonations, personnel shall be 
afforded protection standards per DESR 6055.09_AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety 
Standards. The range operating authority shall ensure that personnel accessing a Laser SDZ or 
Directed Energy WDZ have received applicable laser/directed energy weapon safety training 
and wear the appropriate personal protective equipment. (T-2) Routine access to hazard areas 
not in use should be limited to essential personnel. Public access to hazard areas is prohibited 
until all ordnance employed  in the applicable portion of the hazard area is accounted for and 
appropriate remediation actions (i.e., decontamination and risk management assessment) have 
been conducted. Access to hazard areas is determined locally based on a risk management 
assessment IAW paragraph 4.18 On ranges where another agency controls hazard area access, 
the range operating authority will establish procedures to verify access control and inform that 
agency of potential hazards. (T-2) 
4.5.2.1.  Impact areas. The impact area is that area on a range immediately surrounding the 
target(s) or desired point(s) of impact approved for actual ordnance delivery. Public access 
to impact areas is prohibited at all times. Range operating authorities will ensure when 
range impact area(s) or specific desired points of impact are not in use that access is  limited 
to essential personnel. (T-1). Exception: Impact area access restrictions may not apply 
when range land use is governed the provisions of a real property permit (e.g., joint-land 
use permit). The impact area demarcation is determined locally using risk management 
assessment IAW paragraph 4.18 but should normally be no less than either (a) 500 feet 
from the center of a target or desired point of impact approved for live ordnance, or (b) 300 
feet from the center of a target or desired point of impact used solely for inert or practice 
ordnance. 
4.5.2.2.  WDZ. The WDZ encompasses the ground and airspace for lateral and vertical 
containment of a user-determined percentage of projectiles, fragments, debris, and 
components resulting from the firing, launching, and/or detonation of aviation delivered 
ordnance. This three-dimensional zone accounts for weapon accuracy, failures, ricochets, 
36 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
and broaches (resurfacing) of a specific weapon or munitions type delivered by a specific 
aircraft type under planned specific delivery release parameters. 
4.5.2.3.  SDZ. The SDZ encompasses the ground and airspace designated for vertical and 
lateral containment of a percentage of projectiles, fragments, debris, and components 
resulting from the firing, launching, or detonation of weapon systems to include explosives 
and demolitions. See the United States Army’s Range Manager’s Toolkit Software for 
specific SDZ information. 
4.5.2.4.  Laser SDZ and Directed Energy WDZ. Laser SDZs and Directed Energy WDZs 
encompass the ground area where laser radiation or directed energy levels may exceed 
Maximum Permissible Exposure levels thereby requiring controls. In addition, a Directed 
Energy WDZ may include proximity restrictions to the testing or employment of directed 
energy weapons with or in vicinity of conventional munitions to prevent inadvertent 
functioning or damage. Active Laser SDZs or Directed Energy WDZs become part of the 
hazard area while such equipment is in use. 
4.5.3.  Observation Posts. Notwithstanding paragraphs 4.5.2 and 4.11.5, observation posts 
within a hazard area may be used by Tactical Air Control Parties, Joint Terminal Attack 
Controllers (JTAC), or other briefed personnel involved in Close Air Support (CAS)/air-to- 
ground training, consistent with the following criteria: 
4.5.3.1.  Range operating authorities will conduct a risk assessment of the proposed 
observation post or maneuver area prior to approving their use. (T-1) 
4.5.3.2.  Mission Essential Personnel operating inside an active hazard area must remain 
outside the minimum safe distance for Ground Parties (Training Use Only: Live Fire) 
published in Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-2.6(I), JFIRE 
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for the Application of Firepower. (T-1) 
IAW AFI 11-214, if the planned operations or deliveries are inconsistent with the 
assumptions used to derive the minimum safe distance values, personnel must remain 
outside the WDZ. 
4.5.3.3.  Weapons danger zones (WDZ) are the required separation distance from the target 
for ground personnel.  Minimum Safe Distances (MSD) for the weapon or aircraft are to 
be used for quick reference checks and are not to be used to circumvent range restrictions 
derived from the WDZs.  Submit requests to the participating MAJCOM/A3, Service 
equivalent organization, and the range operating authority for review and approval.  
Personnel shall not be allowed inside the WDZ unless such approval is granted. (T-1) 
4.5.3.4.  While inside the hazard area, all personnel will wear protective gear IAW AFI 11-
214 and AFI 13-112V1, Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) Training Program. 
4.6.  Radio Frequency Spectrum Issues.  Range operating authorities will identify the radio 
frequency spectrum required for range operation and coordinate requirements with the appropriate 
Installation Spectrum Manager. (T-1) The range operating authority will ensure that a frequency 
assignment has been obtained by the user (or appropriate Spectrum Management Office supporting 
the user’s radio frequency requirements) prior to using any radio frequency emitting equipment. 
(T-1) 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
37 
4.6.1.  The range operating authority will ensure AFI 91-208, Hazards of Electromagnetic 
Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) Certification and Management, requirements are met. Seek 
assistance with Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance requirements from the 
supporting installation Weapons Safety Manager prior to the use or presence of ordnance 
containing electrically initiated devices during range operations. 
4.7.  Communications Requirements.  The range operating authority will submit all normal 
communication capability requirements to the supporting wing communications function. (T-2) 
Test-specific systems used on MRTFB ranges may be obtained by local acquisition methods. 
4.7.1.  Ranges providing Class A, B and C services will have reliable point-to-point 
communication with the parent or using base and manned sites on the range. (T-2) During 
Class A service, the range control tower will have redundant communication capability with 
the flank tower(s) and operations building(s). (T-2) All parties or individuals must maintain 
two-way voice contact with the main tower, range office, and/or parent base while in the hazard 
area. (T-1) Portable or mobile radios may be used for backup communication and to maintain 
contact with personnel in the hazard area. 
4.7.2.  Ranges providing Class A, B and C services will have ground-to-air radios to 
communicate with aircraft on the range. (T-2) Primary systems are normally ultra-high 
frequency radios, but very-high frequency, or frequency modulation radios are authorized at 
ranges where users are similarly equipped. Provision of dual, multi- band radios should be 
considered to maximize mission flexibility and safety monitoring capability. 
4.7.2.1.  When a range provides Class A service, the range control officer is responsible 
for all range operations and air/occupational safety, except in cases where weapons release 
clearance is delegated. The range control officer must maintain continuous radio 
communication with all aircraft and ground personnel on the range and have a backup, 
independent radio. (T-2) The range control officer must remain in either the main or flank 
tower (or another MAJCOM approved location) while providing Class A service. (T-2) 
4.7.2.2.  During Class B service, ranges must have the capability to communicate with the 
aircraft to provide scores. (T-2) 
4.7.2.3.  During Class A and B service, ranges will ensure all ultra-high frequency, very-
high frequency, frequency modulation and Land Mobile Radio voice frequencies being 
used on range are recorded at all times. (T-2) 
4.7.2.4.  The range control officer will ensure that all recorders are working properly. (T- 
3). The range control officer will ensure each recording contains the range name, date, and 
time. (T-3) The range operating authority or range operations officer will establish 
procedures to ensure recordings are maintained for a minimum of 7 days. (T-3)  In addition, 
the range control officer will keep and secure recordings containing records of any range 
incident until released by the investigating agency. (T-3) 
4.7.2.5.  All aircraft utilizing the range will monitor Guard frequency. (T-0) 
4.7.2.6.  Aircraft using ultra-high frequency, very-high frequency, or frequency 
modulation radios on the range will utilize range assigned ultra-high frequency, very-high 
frequency, or frequency modulation frequencies. (T-1) 
38 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
4.7.3.  Ranges providing Class D service where operations are monitored by a Range Training 
Officer should have ground-to-air radios to communicate with aircraft on the range and 
network connectivity to ground instrumentation receivers when live-monitoring of the mission 
is mandatory. 
4.7.4.  Communication Operations. Range personnel normally operate all communication 
equipment used on range. Communications personnel will be assigned as radio operators only 
when special conditions warrant (e.g., when sufficient range personnel are unavailable due to 
unplanned or unforeseen deployments). 
4.8.  Armament Safety Procedures.  For ranges capable of aircraft ordnance delivery, prior to 
first release when carrying expendable ordnance (live, inert, or practice), final switch configuration 
for weapon release is not accomplished until the aircraft is in such a position that any accidental 
release will be contained within the range. (T-1) MAJCOMs will develop specific guidance for 
armament system configurations for multiple passes. After completing final                weapons 
delivery, each flight member will perform a weapons system safety check. (T-1) Refer to AFI 11-
214, aircraft specific Air Force 11-2MDS series operating procedures, and individual range 
supplements for additional guidance. 
4.9.  Weapons Release Authority.  Acceptance of weapons release authority incurs sole 
responsibility for the safe release of ordnance. 
4.9.1.  Terminology Conventions. To prevent miscommunication, when authorizing weapons 
release personnel will only use the term "cleared." (T-1) Personnel will use the term "continue" 
in the manner described in Joint Publication 3-09.3, Close Air Support, to acknowledge 
requests or indicate approval to proceed with an attack profile or action without providing 
clearance to release any ordnance yet. (T-1) 
4.9.2.  On ranges providing Class A service, weapons release authority resides inherently with 
the range control officer. For each pass, the range control officer will authorize weapons                 
release with a “cleared hot” radio call unless release authority has been delegated. (T-1) The 
range control officer may delegate weapons release authority to a qualified flight lead, 
individual pilot, Forward Air Controller (Airborne), JTAC or other briefed person by issuing 
an “Authorized (flight lead, individual pilot, Forward Air Controller (Airborne), JTAC, etc.) 
Control” radio call. The range control officer will remain in either the main or flank tower (or  
another MAJCOM approved location), will retain overall range authority at all times and can 
withdraw release clearance or abort a release at any time. (T-2) 
4.9.3.  On ranges providing Class B and C service, weapons release authority follows a 
hierarchy from the JTAC, to the Forward Air Controller (Airborne), to the flight lead, to an 
individual pilot or other briefed person who may then delegate the authority as desired. 
4.10.  Simulated Weapons Release Authority.  Except during flight-lead or individual control, 
to emulate the clearance procedures contained in Joint Publication 3-09.3, the weapons release 
authority should issue a “continue dry” radio call to signify authority to simulate weapons release. 
4.11.  Weapons Employment and Airdrop Operations. 
4.11.1.  Personnel will not employ weapons outside approved DoD Special Use Airspace. (T-
0) Note: Research and Test and Evaluation activities do not require Special Use Airspace if 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
39 
conducted IAW DoDI 5000.89_DAFI 99-103, provided appropriate coordination and 
approvals are obtained from FAA/spectrum authorities as required. 
4.11.2.  Range operating authorities must ensure the land or sea underlying the hazard area or 
failure footprint used for actual weapon employment are protected by purchase, lease, or other 
means to ensure the safety of personnel, structures, and the public from expended weapons, 
laser and electromagnetic emissions, and target debris. (T-0) 
4.11.2.1.  For events where the weapons footprint falls outside the lateral confines of the 
established range boundaries, the range operating authority will notify the public and 
conduct a risk assessment and take actions to minimize the hazard to the public and non- 
DoD property. (T-1) 
4.11.2.2.  Range operating authorities at test ranges will ensure a Flight Termination 
System or other containment measures are applied to aerial test items (weapons, missiles, 
unmanned aerial systems, etc.) having the potential to exceed range boundaries and 
endanger public or DoD assets and personnel. (T-1) Range operating authorities will 
establish a method of determining the position of the item in relation to its footprint and 
the range boundary and assess the need for redundancy of position information, telemetry, 
and Flight Termination System signal transmission based on the potential hazard. (T-1) 
4.11.3.  WDZ Tool Methodology. The WDZ tool application methodology allows the range 
operating authority to identify possible target locations, modify allowable delivery ground 
tracks to eliminate or reduce hazards, identify the best location for range improvements, and 
design a new impact area or range. The methodology is based on WDZ footprints developed 
from a combination of actual weapon impact data and simulation results. A WDZ defines the 
minimum land required to employ a given munition safely, using a certain aircraft and delivery 
tactic, over a specific soil density and target type. Each WDZ footprint incorporates a 
probability distribution function, which provides the information necessary to perform a 
quantitative risk assessment and evaluate the relative risk of an identified hazard. 
4.11.3.1.  Except as noted below, range operating authorities will prohibit weapons 
employment unless an applicable SDZ/WDZ footprint, WDZ surrogate footprint or test 
footprint has been applied to the target for the specific delivery platform, weapon and 
employment parameters. (T-1) Range operating authorities may expedite analysis by 
grouping targets together or combining aircraft type, weapon type, and tactics, as 
appropriate. Test footprints are not authorized for training missions, nor are applicable 
training footprints, by themselves, sufficient for test missions, but training footprints may 
be used as part of the range operating authority’s overall risk assessment. 
4.11.3.1.1.  Where containment is software selectable, range operating authorities will 
apply WDZs and SDZs that provide the following containment of projectiles, 
fragments, debris, and components as a minimum: (T-1) 
4.11.3.1.1.1.  Surface fires: 99.9999% (Expressed as 1:1,000,000 escapement for 
SDZs). 
4.11.3.1.1.2.  Aviation-delivered gun ammunition: 99.999%. 
4.11.3.1.1.3.  All other aviation-delivered ordnance: 99.99%. 
40 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
4.11.3.1.2.  WDZ surrogate footprints may be used and do not require ACC/A3A                    
approval when: 
4.11.3.1.2.1.  Test events are conducted on MRTFB ranges or test sites. 
4.11.3.1.2.2.  AFMC-sponsored test events are conducted on a PTR and a test 
footprint or WDZ surrogate footprint has been approved by AFMC/SE, the range 
operating authority, and the range-owning MAJCOM. 
4.11.3.1.3.  WDZ surrogate footprints must be used and require ACC/A3A approval 
when: 
4.11.3.1.3.1.  Training operations involve specific delivery platforms, weapon and                         
employment parameter combinations, including foreign aircraft and weapons, that 
do not exist in the WDZ tool. 
4.11.3.1.3.2.  Test events are conducted on a PTR except as noted in 4.11.3.1.2.2. 
4.11.3.1.3.3.  Training operations involve specific delivery platforms, weapon and 
employment parameter combinations that are classified and cannot be generated in 
the WDZ tool (it is an unclassified system). 
4.11.3.1.4.  The use of WDZ surrogate footprints may be approved by completing the 
following actions: 
4.11.3.1.4.1.  The event-sponsoring MAJCOM requests a permanent WDZ 
footprint from ACC/A3A as the lead Air Force agent for procuring and modifying 
WDZ footprints as necessary. 
4.11.3.1.4.2.  Range operating authority performs a risk assessment using a WDZ 
surrogate footprint and 100% containment of projectiles, fragments, debris and 
components and submits it to the range-owning MAJCOM. 
4.11.3.1.4.3.  The range-owning MAJCOM reviews and provides concurrence with 
the range operating authority’s WDZ surrogate footprint and risk assessment to the 
event-sponsoring MAJCOM. 
4.11.3.1.4.3.1.  When use of a WDZ surrogate footprint is requested for 
contracted air support for another service or MAJCOM: 
4.11.3.1.4.3.1.1.  The service or MAJCOM requesting use of the surrogate 
footprint is responsible for performing a risk assessment and generating 
surrogate footprint(s) using 100% containment of projectiles, fragments, 
debris, and components and submitting them to the range-owning MAJCOM. 
4.11.3.1.4.3.1.2.  The range-owning MAJCOM must verify that the 
contractor meets airworthiness requirements IAW that Service’s Technical 
Airworthiness Authority and that the aircraft will be in public aircraft 
operations status (i.e., has an Interim Flight Clearance for the Navy or an 
Airworthiness Release for the Army). 
4.11.3.1.4.3.1.3.  Contact the Air Force Technical Airworthiness Authority, 
AFLCMC/EN-EZZ, 
at 
USAF.Airworthiness.Office@us.af.mil 
for

AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
41 
4.11.3.1.4.3.1.4.  The range-owning MAJCOM must include verification of 
airworthiness with the WDZ surrogate footprint request that is submitted to 
ACC/A3A. 
4.11.3.1.4.4.  The event-sponsoring MAJCOM submits WDZ surrogate footprint 
and risk assessment to ACC/A3A for approval. 
4.11.3.1.5.  For foreign countries using same type United States aircraft and United 
States weapons, range operating authorities may use a United States aircraft WDZ in 
their risk management assessment. Notify the MAJCOM and AF/A3TI of the use of 
this applicable WDZ prior to actual employment. Range operating authorities may also 
apply a larger buffer, for risk mitigation purposes, if the foreign country is not a routine 
participant and unfamiliar with the range and exercise/training scenario. 
4.11.3.1.6.  MRTFB and test range operating authorities are responsible for ensuring 
test footprints are developed and applied for test missions. If the application of test 
footprints would preclude the accomplishment of test objectives, the range operating 
authority, in conjunction with the DoDI 5000.89_DAFI 99-103-mandated safety 
review, may authorize the use of a risk management policy. The range operating 
authority will perform a risk assessment, which is validated by the safety review, to 
identify and minimize hazards consistent with test objectives (see DoDI 5000.89_DAFI 
99-103). (T-1) 
4.11.3.2.  Procuring WDZ Footprints. Headquarters ACC/A3A is the lead Air Force                     
agent for procuring and modifying WDZ footprints for Combat Air Forces requirements. 
MAJCOMs requiring unique or fast-track WDZ footprints will coordinate with ACC/A3A 
at least 6 months prior to the need date.  Foreign countries requiring WDZ support should 
be directed to SAF/IAPX. 
4.11.4.  Precautions with Expendable Munitions. Aircraft with free-falling and/or forward- 
firing ordnance will not over fly or point their aircraft or guns at manned sites with intent to 
expend or employ weapons. (T-1) Aircraft with moveable guns, such as helicopters and AC-
130  gunships, will not point their guns at any manned site. (T-1) Range operating authorities 
must ensure that facilities where the risk of damage is deemed unacceptable are not within any 
footprint. (T-1) 
4.11.5.  Weapons Employment near Manned Equipment, Facilities and Sites. 
4.11.5.1.  Training Operations. In general, manned equipment, facilities, and sites, such as 
range towers, simulated threat emitter systems, and observation posts, may be located 
within the hazard area during range operations, provided the associated personnel are 
designated Mission Essential, inert ordnance is used, and a risk assessment is conducted 
and approved by the range operating authority IAW paragraph 4.18 Also see paragraph 
4.5.3 for additional criteria associated with observation posts. 
4.11.5.2.  Test Operations. Range operating authorities must ensure the presence of 
manned equipment, facilities and sites are addressed in the risk assessment process 
described in paragraph 4.11.3.1.4. (T-1) Authorized test activities employing live 
munitions may locate personnel or equipment (e.g., telemetry or recording devices) within 
the hazard area only if essential for mission accomplishment, and only with documented 
risk management application and approval. Permanently locating or constructing non-
42 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
essential manned facilities within a hazard area with continuous exposure requires the 
application of AFMAN 91-201 processes and approval authorities following range 
operating authority coordination. 
4.11.6.  Improved Container Delivery System and Joint Precision Airdrop System Deliveries. 
4.11.6.1.  Range operating authorities will approve Improved Container Delivery System 
(ICDS) and Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) deliveries only if the Precision 
Airdrop System- Mission Planner derived footprints for success and chute failure overlay 
only government-owned, leased or otherwise controlled land with no non-mission essential 
personnel present and an Airdrop Damage Estimation acceptable to the range operating 
authority has been accomplished. (T-1) Additional ICDS and JPADS information and 
restrictions are published in DAFMAN 13-217. 
4.11.6.2.  If the load is projected to, or may transit non-restricted airspace during its fall 
(e.g., footprints are not wholly contained within restricted airspace), range operating 
authorities will also ensure the user complies with applicable rules contained in Title 14 
CFR Subpart B, Section 105.25, Information required, and notice of cancellation or 
postponement of jump (Federal Aviation Regulation 105.25). (T-0) 
4.11.6.3.  Equipment, facilities, and mission essential personnel are permitted within the 
success, chute failure and the guidance failure footprints if the range operating authority 
has conducted and approved a risk assessment IAW paragraph 4.18. 
4.11.6.4.  Because weather observations and dropsonde (an expendable, aircraft-launched 
weather measurement device) wind updates are used to revise footprint analyses up until 
the time of delivery, range operating authorities should ensure the user is aware of the range 
operating authority’s exclusion requirements and be provided with the location of 
airspace/range boundaries and any personnel or equipment the range operating authority 
cannot or chooses not to allow in the footprint as part of his/her risk analysis. 
4.12.  Jettison Areas.  Range operating authorities will ensure that all ranges with aerial delivery 
capability have an area within the hazard area designated for jettison of ordnance and stores. (T-
1) The location of jettison areas and jettison procedures are designed to minimize the hazard to the 
public, ground personnel and range structures as well as aircraft and aircrew. 
4.13.  Electronic Warfare Training Operations.  Electronic warfare training facilities provide a 
realistic electronic threat environment through the use of surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft 
artillery threat emitter simulators. These facilities provide electronic warfare support for composite 
force training, unit exercises, unit gunnery competitions, normal training missions, and higher 
Headquarters exercises or inspections. 
4.13.1.  Electronic Warfare Personnel Training. To provide a realistic threat environment, 
electronic warfare threat operators require a working knowledge of electronic warfare doctrine 
and employment concepts. 
4.13.1.1.  Training Programs. Management criteria, administrative practices, and training 
policies required to conduct a comprehensive electronic warfare training program include                  
academics and practical application in live and simulated environments. Electronic warfare 
threat operators should be familiar with applicable MAJCOM training events and  
requirements defined in Air Force 11-2MDSv1s and RAP Tasking Memos.

continually watch for hazardous conditions such as trespassers, fires, bird activity, etc. (T-
3) Range users will be notified immediately of any hazardous conditions on the range. (T-
3) If safety is in question, the range control officer or other appropriate authority will stop 
range operations until the situation is remedied. (T-3) 
4.17.4.6.  Performance during Critical Tasks. During the performance of critical situational 
tasks such as controlling or monitoring the movement of aircraft or ground parties using 
the range, personnel must not conduct unrelated activities which divert their attention, 
degrade situational awareness or prevent timely communication. (T-3) Such distracting 
prohibitions include composing and sending emails and text messages unrelated to the 
mission at hand, browsing web pages unrelated to the mission and making and receiving 
unofficial phone calls. 
4.18.  Risk Management.  Range operations are complex, and the risk management process 
requires a dedicated team representing multiple functional areas such as operations, CE (to include 
EOD), legal, public affairs, and safety. Utilize the risk management process prior to any change to 
range operations, boundaries, or procedures with the potential to increase flight, occupational or 
explosive safety risks. The risk management assessment examines type of ordnance authorized, 
employment tactics, weapons footprints, type of proposed joint or shared use, geographic features, 
frequency of EOD sweeps, etc. Coordinate assessments through the wing (or equivalent) POC for 
risk management matters. The AF Form 4437, Deliberate Risk Assessment Worksheet, and the 
ACC Form 167, ACC Risk Management (R M )Worksheet, are two tools that may be used to assist 
with documenting risk management assessments. 
4.19.  Night Operations. 
4.19.1.  Covert or blacked-out lighting operations will not be conducted during Class A service 
unless the range control officer is equipped with binocular, generation-III NVDs. (T- 2). NVDs 
will be tested, adjusted, and focused by the range control officer before use with (in  order of 
preference) the Hoffman ANV-20/20 Tester, a unit eye lane, or equivalent tester. (T- 2). Range 
control officers will perform NVD testing, adjustment and focusing procedures IAW 
appropriate TOs, manufacturer instructions or MAJCOM guidance. (T-2) 
4.19.2.  Range Lighting. 
4.19.2.1.  Class A Service Identification Lighting. Ranges providing Class A services that 
support night operations must have available a distinctive pattern of lights visible by 
aircrews, with and without NVDs, to ensure positive orientation and identification of the 
range and target area. (T-2) These lights should be readily identifiable but not so as to 
distract aircrews during weapons delivery or wash out target locations. Range operating 
authorities will ensure that no similar pattern of lights exists near the range that could be 
50 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
misidentified as targets or the impact area, but cultural lighting inside or outside the range 
boundary may serve as a portion of the distinctive pattern of lights. (T-2) 
4.19.2.2.  Class B Service Identification Lighting. Ranges providing Class B services that 
support night operations will have lighting as described above unless the range operating 
authority has determined that the lighting is not required based on a documented, risk 
management assessment (based on range size, remoteness, etc.) (T-2) 
4.19.2.3.  Target Lighting. Lighting for the specific purpose of illuminating the target is 
only required on ranges that support users accomplishing unaided visual deliveries. If 
required (or desired by other users), target lighting may be accomplished using 
incandescent lights, lanterns, or flares. Lights and lanterns should be NVD compatible or 
reduced in intensity to produce the minimum halo around each light when viewed through 
NVDs. Every effort should be made to prevent the target from appearing as a light with a 
halo to allow for positive target identification. 
4.19.2.4.  Range Facility Identification. 
4.19.2.4.1.  Range Tower and Routinely-Manned Facility Lighting. Lighting is 
required on all routinely-manned range facilities and range towers to facilitate positive 
identification by aircrew. (T-2) Proper management of tower lighting is important to 
maximize performance of NVDs used by range personnel. Tower lighting (interior and 
exterior) should be minimized to those necessary to conduct operations and all 
unnecessary lights should be extinguished or taped over. NVD compatible lighting is 
highly recommended. Consider moving tower, routinely-manned facilities and 
obstruction strobe lights to locations that can best support night operations. 
4.19.2.4.2.  Other Manned Locations. Other manned locations (such as observation 
posts, visitor locations, vehicles, etc.) will, as a minimum, mark their location by any 
means described in Joint Publication 3-09.3 for “friendly marking” that facilitates 
positive identification by aircrew. (T-0) 
4.19.3.  Infrared Radiation Pointers and/or Lasers. Range users will not use a single, steady 
infrared radiation point as the sole means of target identification. (T-1) If using an infrared 
radiation pointer to mark targets, range users must ensure either the target or friendly terminus 
of the pointer is positively verified by another means (snaking, friendly location marking, etc.). 
(T-1) When ground-based lasers/designators are used to designate targets, range users must 
ensure attack headings within ±10° of the laser designator to target line (safety zone) are 
prohibited and run-in headings are restricted to a 50° cone on either side of the safety zone. 
(T-1) Per AFI 48-139, personnel will not be exposed to laser radiation in excess of the 
Maximum Permissible Exposure levels as defined in American National Standards Institute 
Z136.1, Safe Use of Lasers, and avoid unnecessary exposures to laser radiation below the 
Maximum Permissible Exposure. (T-2) 
4.20.  Unmanned Aerial Systems/Remotely Piloted Aircraft.  Range operating authorities shall 
conduct a risk management assessment of Unmanned Aerial System/Remotely Piloted Aircraft 
operations and apply appropriate mitigation measures prior to employment on the range. (T-0) At 
a minimum consider: 
 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
51 
4.20.1.  Kinetic energy potential for lethality and property damage. 
4.20.2.  Flight paths to avoid endangering concentrations of DoD and civil assets/personnel. 
4.20.3.  System maturity and employment methodology. 
4.20.4.  Mid-air collision avoidance through see, sense and avoid, spotter, or chase aircraft. 
4.20.5.  Airspace and Air Traffic Control coordination. See FAA publications for flight 
requirements in the National Airspace System. 
4.20.6.  Robustness and redundancy of vehicle control or telemetry. 
4.20.7.  Containment measures such as a Flight Termination System, lost link software, or 
parachute.

Chapter 5 
RANGE MAINTENANCE AND CLEARANCE OPERATIONS 
5.1.  Range Clearance Guidelines.  Each MAJCOM/range operating authority is responsible for 
the clearance of operational ranges under its control IAW DoDI 3200.16, DoDI 4140.62, Material 
Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard  (MPPEH), DoDM 4140.72, Management of Material 
Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard, and Title 40 CFR, Parts 260-270. Furthermore, each 
MAJCOM/range operating authority must dispose of radioactive wastes IAW the Air Force 
Radioactive Recycling and Disposal Office and AFI 40-201. (T-0) 
5.1.1.  Funding and Scheduling Range Clearance. The range operating authority is responsible 
for funding and scheduling all Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard 
(MPPEH)/range clearance. The range operating authority should publish a readily accessible 
clearance schedule. The range operating authority or range operations officer may temporarily 
postpone range clearance on a case-by-case basis for severe weather or other unforeseen 
circumstances that warrant delays. 
5.1.2.  EOD Support for Range Clearance. Development of the annual range clearance plan 
will be a collaborative effort between the range operating authority and the supporting EOD 
unit (or MAJCOM) and be finalized at least 6 months prior to the first clearance activity. If 
there is no organic EOD capability, range operating authorities will establish a written 
agreement for range clearance support with the nearest Air Force EOD unit, if practicable; or 
if not with the nearest non-Air Force EOD unit via a memorandum of agreement and/or Inter-
Service Support Agreement. (T-2) Range operating authorities will attempt to synchronize 
clearances with EOD deployment cycles or periods of high EOD operations tempo. 
5.1.2.1.  When the requirement for range clearance support exceeds the capability of the 
associated EOD unit, shortfalls are managed within the EOD Information Management 
System Range Support Tasking Program. The supporting EOD unit (or MAJCOM) will 
enter Range Support Tasking requests into EOD Information Management System as 
required to meet clearance requirements. (T-2) 
5.1.2.2.  Range operating authorities will prepare a plan for range clearance operations that 
at a minimum considers the number of personnel involved, types of ordnance anticipated 
to be encountered and/or recovered, expected levels of contamination, and support 
requirements. (T-2) 
5.1.2.2.1.  The range operating authority will ensure the plan provides sufficient time 
to complete the planned and anticipated range clearance operations safely. (T-2) 
5.1.2.2.2.  Consider requesting an advanced echelon element from the supporting                  
EOD unit to conduct a GPS mapping survey of UXO-contaminated areas and debris- 
densities/distances around the targets at least 2 weeks prior to arrival of the main body 
for workload estimates and to finalize clearance planning. 
5.1.2.3.  Range operating authorities must finalize all range scheduling and EOD Render 
Safe Procedure support at least 45 days before the start of the clearance operation. (T-3) 
5.1.3.  To identify, safeguard, and dispose of UXO, range operating authorities will ensure             
the following are accomplished: 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
53 
5.1.3.1.  Safely clear UXO from ranges consistent with the stated mission of the range and 
for the continuing viability of the range. (T-1) Resolve all conflicts between explosive 
safety and other requirements with the objective of minimizing explosive hazards. Ensure 
controlled burning is not used to accomplish UXO clearance, but may be used to support 
UXO clearance if environmental and safety requirements are met. (T-1) 
5.1.3.2.  Promptly report any UXO or aircraft incident that falls outside of range or 
installation boundaries to proper authorities to protect personnel and property IAW AFI 
32-3001. (T-0) 
5.1.3.3.  Notify installation personnel and the public, as appropriate, if any range operation 
presents a potential explosive hazard off the range. (T-2) This includes informing the 
public of any mishap that could impact the local community and may require additional 
precautions and/or restrictions. For range operations that occur outside the United States, 
comply with DoDD 4715.12 and relevant Combatant Command and in-theater 
Headquarters Air Force Component Command issuances, if any. 
5.1.3.4.  On operational ranges, the procedures for evaluating and responding to explosives 
safety, human health, and environmental risks are IAW DESR 6055.09_AFMAN 91-201 
and Title 40 CFR Parts 260-270. 
5.1.3.5.  Maintain permanent records of: 
5.1.3.5.1.  All expenditures (types, quantities, locations, using organization, and 
estimated dud rates) per target of ammunition and explosives IAW DoDD 4715.11 and 
DoDD 4715.12. (T-0) 
5.1.3.5.2.  All mishaps attributed to UXO that occur on or off the range/installation 
IAW DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and Record 
Keeping. (T-0) 
5.1.3.5.3.  All EOD incidents and range clearance operations conducted on ranges. (T-
0) 
5.1.3.5.4.  All areas known or suspected to contain UXO using a geographic 
information system, range maps and/or installation master planning maps in 
compliance with the Spatial Data Standards for Facilities, Infrastructure, and 
Environment. Conduct historical research as necessary. (T-0) 
5.1.3.6.  Remove all munitions debris from targets awaiting disposal. (T-0) 
5.2.  Range Clearance Operations.  Range clearance includes the removal or disposal of all 
ordnance, inert ordnance debris, training projectile ammunition, and other range debris reasonably 
possible to detect (normally down to 4 inches in size).  Non-explosive debris should, at a minimum, 
be marked clear but is not required to be removed from targets by EOD personnel. 
5.2.1.  WARNING:  Ranges will not conduct maintenance and clearance operations when 
snow covers the ground. (T-1) However, if specifically authorized in the MAJCOM 
supplement, activities such as clearance, target removal, or target replacement may be 
performed during these periods. 
5.2.2.  Ordnance Removal and Disposal. EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel, as 
defined in the current version of the DoD Explosives Safety Board Technical Paper 18, 
54 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
Minimum Qualifications for Personnel Conducting Munitions and Explosives of Concern- 
Related Activities, will inspect munitions, munitions components, and targets for the presence 
of explosive hazards and mark inspected items that are “safe to move”. Only EOD Personnel 
will perform explosive operations to detonate/destroy UXO and energetic material. (T-1) With 
an approved waiver, UXO-Qualified Personnel may perform limited explosives operations to 
support specific range clearance objectives, limited to venting practice bombs or destroying 
spotting charges. UXO-Qualified Personnel contracted to perform target maintenance or 
manage the installations MPPEH Program on operational ranges, will mark all UXO or 
munitions that contain explosives and report the item and location to the appropriate agency to 
coordinate with the supporting EOD unit to schedule a disposal/render safe procedures. Special 
attention should be provided during target inspection to ensure UXO are not embedded or 
contained within voids. “Safe to move” may be indicated by any readily distinguishable means 
that is mutually agreeable to EOD and the range operating authority. 
5.2.3.  Personnel assisting in range clearances will only handle items that have been inspected 
and marked “safe to move” by EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel. (T-1)  Personnel 
assisting will be supervised by either EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel to ensure 
hazardous items are not inadvertently moved or removed. (T-1) 
5.2.4.  MPPEH Management. All munitions, munitions debris, and target debris removed from 
a range are considered MPPEH and are managed IAW explosive safety standards. Processing 
of MPPEH results in a classification of the material as either Material Documented as an 
Explosive Hazard (MDEH) or Material Documented as Safe (MDAS). Ranges must 
institutionalize chain of custody processes for MPPEH from collection to final disposition of 
the hazardous and safe material. (T-0) This is particularly necessary when two or more 
agencies (e.g., military and contracted) are involved in the MPPEH process. Refer to 
DAFMAN 21- 201, Munitions Management, for additional guidance on MPPEH management 
and disposition. 
5.2.4.1.  MPPEH processing (also known as “Range Residue Removal”) is normally 
accomplished by UXO-Qualified Contractors where demilitarization complements the 
inspection process to enable a more thorough examination. 
5.2.4.2.  Range operating authorities will ensure that MPPEH awaiting processing and 
inspection is in a properly sited residue holding area. (T-0) When non-EOD personnel 
handle and transport material marked “safe to move,” EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified 
Personnel will supervise handling and loading for consolidation at the residue holding area. 
(T-1) Only EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel will handle material after 
placement in the residue holding area. (T-1) Ranges may accumulate MPPEH until a cost-
effective processing quantity is reached but shall not delay processing in order to maximize 
the value of recyclable materials. (T-0) 
5.2.4.3.  EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel must double-inspect MPPEH IAW 
DoDI 4140.62 to identify and remove Material Documented as an Explosive Hazard before 
it can be declared Material Documented as Safe. (T-0) To prevent co-mingling, once 
Material Documented as an Explosive Hazard and Material Documented as Safe are 
identified and documented as such, EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel must 
segregate them from one another and from MPPEH awaiting inspection. (T-0) Segregation 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
55 
may be accomplished by any means that ensures physical separation and controlled access 
(e.g., bins, buildings, or fenced compounds under lock and key). 
5.2.4.4.  Disposal of Material Documented as Safe may be accomplished by any means 
consistent with DoDI 4140.62 and may be accomplished by the Defense Reutilization and 
Marketing Service under a memorandum of agreement or through direct commercial sales 
or contracts. Range operating authorities must ensure only properly inspected and 
documented Material Documented as Safe are released to the public. (T-0) For Material 
Documented as Safe at ranges located outside the United States, ensure compliance with 
DoDD 4715.12 and relevant Combatant Command and in-theater Headquarters Air Force 
Component Command issuances, if any. 
5.2.4.5.  MPPEH disposal should not be viewed as a funds generating activity. 
Management and disposal of MPPEH should consider safety first and ensure compliance 
with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Military Munitions Rule and (where 
applicable) hazardous waste management requirements. Additionally, IAW DoDI 4715.23, 
Integrated Recycling and Solid Waste Management, the following categories are excluded 
from being sold through a qualified recycling program: items that require demilitarization; 
ships, planes or weapons that require demilitarization or mutilation prior to sale; Munitions 
List items or Strategic List items. Range operating authorities must ensure the proceeds 
from their sale are NOT returned to a qualified recycling program. (T-0) 
5.3.  Range Clearance Types and Requirements.  On active ranges programmed for continued 
use, clear the surface of all UXO, MPPEH, and inert debris as described below. Ranges located 
outside the United States will comply with paragraphs 5.3.1- 5.3.4.4 to the extent allowed by 
applicable international agreements. When seeking Air Force Safety Center / Weapons Safety 
Division (AFSEC/SEW) concurrence for operations, review requirements in DESR 6055.09,   Vol. 
7. 
5.3.1.  The following general rules apply to all clearance activities: 
5.3.1.1.  Mechanized gathering procedures coordinated with the supporting EOD unit and 
approved by the Air Force Safety Center may be used to clear sub-scale practice munitions 
(e.g., BDU-33) as long as un-probed munitions are only handled by EOD Personnel or 
UXO-Qualified Personnel. 
5.3.1.2.  EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel will only perform subsurface UXO 
and subsurface MPPEH removal as required in current or former hazard areas as required 
for construction, cable burial, etc. (T-1) EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel will 
report subsurface MPPEH removal and range clearance separately. (T-1) 
5.3.1.3.  Range operating authorities will ensure that hazard areas used specifically for live 
munitions containing extremely hazardous fuzing (e.g., influence, random-delay) are 
identified as "Extremely Hazardous Contaminated hazard areas." (T-1) Range clearance 
requirements of “Extremely Hazardous Contaminated hazard areas” are based on an 
Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health risk assessment, and if warranted, range 
operating authorities must accomplish a waiver request IAW paragraph 1.3 and staff it 
through the appropriate Air Force Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health 
agencies (i.e., CE Environmental, Safety, and/or Bioenvironmental Engineering). (T-1) 
56 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
5.3.1.4.  Ranges adjacent to the land of another service that prohibits clearance activities 
are exempt from clearance requirements on those portions when the other service provides 
written acknowledgement of the ramifications. These areas will be considered “Extremely 
Hazardous Contaminated impact areas” and managed accordingly by the range operating 
authority. (T-1) 
5.3.1.5.  Range operating authorities will receive authorization from adjacent facilities 
prior to decontaminating/clearing adjacent impact areas. (T-1) Range operating authorities 
will document all access denials for clearance activities and report occurrences to the parent 
MAJCOM and AF/A3TI. (T-2) 
5.3.2.  Low-Angle Strafe Targets. If used for low-angle strafe by aircraft that fly past or over 
the target within 500 feet of the target (slant range), range operating authorities will ensure that 
the target is hand-policed daily when used and cleared after 15,000 scored rounds (or 12 use 
days for non-scored targets). (T-2) 
5.3.3.  Improved conventional munition targets (e.g., Cluster Bomb Unit grids) are normally 
cleared after accumulating a specific number of weapons. Range operating authorities will 
specify the maximum accumulation amount for improved conventional munition targets in the 
range supplement for approval by the MAJCOM with the concurrence of AF/A4C. (T-1)  After 
the maximum accumulation amount is achieved, EOD Personnel will clear improved 
conventional munition targets to the radius where the debris density factor is less than five 
items per acre or at least 500 feet from the target. (T-1) 
5.3.4.  Range Clearance Requirements. EOD Personnel will clear active ranges used for 
munitions expenditures IAW the minimum requirements defined in the following sub- 
paragraphs. (T-1) Conduct clearance more frequently or to a greater distance as required to 
maintain targets or realistic appearance, or where an uneven distribution of weapons results 
from restricted run-in headings. EOD Personnel will: 
5.3.4.1.  Clear target access roads and the area 50 feet on either side during clearance 
operations or target maintenance activities (only those roads noted on range maps and those 
used for sole access to targets/arrays). (T-1) Consider clearing to a greater side distance to 
accommodate anticipated vehicle traffic (e.g., towed load), vehicle characteristics (e.g., 
turn radius), and potential obstacles (e.g., road damage, UXO). 
5.3.4.2.  Semiannually or after 150 use days (whichever comes later), clear the area around 
each desired point of impact associated with a high-use target to a radius of 150 feet. Note: 
This criterion applies to individual desired points of impact (not multi-desired points of 
impact target arrays) that receive a high volume of munitions, where deferring clearance 
to the biennial interval would create a significant ricochet hazard or significantly increase 
the range clearance work effort due to the accumulation and/or density of UXO. (T-1) 
Range operating authorities may determine these high-use targets based on range-specific 
conditions, in consultation with the MAJCOM. 
5.3.4.3.  Biennially, no later than 2 years since last accomplished, clear the area around a 
target used for weapons expenditure as follows: (T-1) 
5.3.4.3.1.  Clear targets used for practice, inert, pyrotechnic, illumination or smoke 
munitions to either a) a radius of 300 feet, or b) the shorter radius where the debris 
density factor is less than five items per acre. 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
57 
5.3.4.3.2.  Clear targets used for high explosive munitions (including White 
Phosphorous) to either a) a radius of 500 feet, or b) the shorter radius where the debris 
density factor is less than five items per acre. 
5.3.4.4.  Decennially, no later than 10 years since last accomplished, clear the area around 
a target used for weapons expenditure to either a) a radius of 1,000 feet, or b) the shorter 
radius where the density of debris items is less than five per acre. (T-1) Range operating 
authorities may elect to clear all areas within 1,000 feet of targets every 10 years and may 
do so incrementally (e.g., 20% of the required area biennially for 10 years). 
5.4.  Range Maintenance and Clearance Safety. 
5.4.1.  WARNING:  Non-EOD Personnel will not move or attempt to move munitions or 
targets unless they have been marked “safe to move” by EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified 
Personnel. (T-0) This includes any object that appears to have been delivered on-range or had 
weapons fired against it. The sole exceptions are for training gun ammunition which has been 
expended on targets designated solely for that use, and expended Smokey Surface-to- Air 
Missile simulators. 
5.4.2.  Safety Training Requirements. 
5.4.2.1.  Range operating authorities will ensure all range personnel engaged in range 
maintenance and clearance operations receive occupational and explosive safety briefings                  
IAW Attachment 5. (T-1) 
5.4.2.2.  Range operating authorities will ensure EOD personnel receive orientation on 
ordnance expected to be encountered, range vehicle operation, and emergency procedures. 
(T-1) 
5.4.2.3.  The supporting EOD unit will ensure non-EOD personnel who are assisting in 
range clearance operations are briefed on explosive safety hazards IAW AFMAN 91-201,                  
the markings used for live, practice, and inert ordnance found in TO 11A-1-53, General 
Instruction for Ammunitions Color Coding, Identification of Empty and Inert Loaded 
Ammunition Items and Components, and Assignment of Version Numbers to Training and  
Dummy Ammunition Items, and the hazards they may encounter. (T-1) 
5.4.3.  In addition to communication requirements specified in paragraph 4.7, each working 
EOD team must have a signaling device for use in the event an uninformed flight crew attempts 
to use the range. (T-3) 
5.4.4.  Requiring activities shall incorporate Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
standards and/or Department of Defense Manual 4145.26, DoD Contractors’ Safety Manual 
for Ammunition and Explosives, into range support contracts, as applicable. (T-0) Requiring 
activities outside the United States may have additional, host nation requirements. Contact the 
servicing Safety Office for more information. 
5.5.  Range Operations during Range Maintenance and Clearance.  Unless further restricted 
by MAJCOM or local range supplements, adhere to the following restrictions during range 
maintenance and clearance operations. 
5.5.1.  Only simulated weapons deliveries, IAW applicable directives, and training-mode laser 
operations are authorized for the duration of range maintenance and range clearance closures 
with the following exceptions. When the range is divided as described below all maintenance 
58 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
and clearance activities must be complete before air-to-ground activities can resume on that 
portion. (T-2) Range operating authorities will ensure that all restrictions are clearly identified 
in the range schedule and reinforced with range Notices to Airmen. (T-2) 
5.5.1.1.  Class A Service Operations. Range maintenance and clearance operations can be 
conducted on one side of a dual Class A service range (except behind strafe targets) while 
the range control officer is controlling aircrew training missions on the other side of the 
range. 
5.5.1.2.  Class B and C Service Operations. Ranges providing Class B and C service are 
normally closed during maintenance and clearance operations, but if the range is of 
sufficient size the range operating authority may authorize continued operations on 
portions of the range (and adjacent ranges) with the approval of the ground party team 
chief. If approved, the range operating authority will brief aircrews concerning the location 
of ground personnel and emphasize the absolute need for positive target identification. (T-
2) 
5.5.2.  Over Flight Procedures. Aircraft must obtain concurrence and approval from the ground 
party and range control officer/range operations officer for overflight over areas or portions of 
ranges during maintenance and clearance operations in conjunction with the following 
restrictions. (T-1) This ensures the protection of ground personnel and prevents aircraft 
damage by fragments from explosives operations. For the purpose of this manual, the 
overflight restrictions define a minimum distance in any direction, i.e., a “safety bubble.” Strict 
adherence to the procedures outlined below is mandatory. 
5.5.2.1.  When range maintenance or clearance personnel are present on the range and 
explosives operations are not planned, aircraft will remain above 3,000 feet above ground 
level unless a lower altitude and distance is specifically approved by the ground party and 
range control officer/range operations officer. (T-1) 
5.5.2.2.  When explosives operations are planned, aircraft will remain at or above 10,000 
feet above ground level (accounts for potential rogue fragments IAW DESR 6055.09 
AFMAN 91-201, Paragraph V5.E3.2.7.4.2). (T-1) 
5.5.2.3.  Aircraft will not release chaff and flares over range maintenance and clearance 
operations. (T-1) 
5.5.2.4.  When no personnel are on the range aircraft operations may proceed with no 
additional altitude restrictions.

TEST AND TRAINING USE OF DEPLETED URANIUM (DU) 
6.1.  Policy and Procedures for Use of DU.  Test and training operations involving DU are IAW                   
this manual, AFI 40-201, and the applicable Air Force Radioactive Material Permit issued under 
the authority of Air Force Master Materials License by the Radioisotope Committee of the Air 
Force Medical Readiness Agency / Surgeon General Policy Branch (AFMRA/SG3PB). 
6.2.  Personnel Using or Handling DU will: 
6.2.1.  Comply with radiation safety procedures outlined in the license or permit authorizing 
the storage or use of DU, the referenced directives, local operating instructions or directives, 
and verbal instructions of their Radiation Safety Officer and supervisor. (T-0) 
6.2.2.  Halt any imminent danger situation immediately, place the operation in a safe 
configuration, and inform their Radiation Safety Officer or supervisor of unsafe or non- 
compliant radiological conditions and incidents or accidents involving DU. (T-0)

Chapter 7 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT 
7.1.  Environmental Compliance.  Air Force ranges will conduct their activities according to 
national environmental policy and will meet environmental compliance guidelines set forth in Air 
Force and DoD directive publications, including (but not limited to) DAFI 32-7001 and DoDI 
4715.06, Environmental Compliance at Installations Outside the United States.  The Air Force 
will comply with applicable Federal, State, and local  environmental laws, standards, and reporting 
requirements. For ranges outside the United States, Air Force activities will comply with 
environmental criteria specified in applicable international agreements, and DoDI 4715.05, 
Environmental Compliance at Installations Outside the U.S., and AFI 32-7091. 
7.1.1.  Military Munitions Rule. For ranges in the United States, the regulations governing 
cradle-to-grave management of hazardous waste are codified in Title 40 CFR Parts 260-270. 
The portion of those regulations that determines when military munitions become solid waste 
and provides standards for their management are codified in Title 40 CFR, Part 266, Subpart 
M, Military Munitions (40 CFR §§ 266.200 -- 266.206). MAJCOMs/range operating 
authorities will comply with DoDM 4715.26, DoD Military Munitions Rule (MR) 
Implementation Procedures, AFMAN 32-7002, Environmental Compliance and Pollution 
Prevention, and DAFMAN 21-201 to meet Environmental Protection Agency regulatory 
requirements on operational ranges (i.e., including both active and inactive ranges as defined 
by 40 CFR 266.201). (T-0) Range operating authorities must ensure the supporting CE 
unit/environmental planning function is involved in the process. (T-3) 
7.1.2.  MPPEH. MAJCOMs/range operating authorities will manage active and inactive ranges 
under their control to maintain long-term viability of DoD ranges while protecting human 
health and the environment and to minimize future clearance costs. (T-1) Ranges and                      
munitions should be designed to minimize potential explosive hazards and harmful 
environmental impacts and to promote resource recovery and recycling. Each MAJCOM/range 
operating authority will comply with DoDI 4140.62, DoDD 4715.11, and DoDD 4715.12.     
(T-0) 
7.1.3.  Environmental Remediation outside the United States. To address environmental 
contamination on Air Force-operated ranges located in foreign countries, follow AFI 32-7091 
to the extent that it does not conflict with the requirements of binding international agreements 
regarding use of ranges. 
7.2.  Integrated Natural and Cultural Resources Programs.  Air Force ranges will conserve 
natural and cultural resources pursuant to the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. § 670 et seq), Endangered 
Species Act (16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq), and the National Historic Preservation Act (54 U.S.C. § 
300101 et seq). 
7.2.1.  The management of range natural resources is governed by an approved Integrated 
Natural Resources Management Plan IAW AFMAN 32-7003. 
7.2.2.  The management of cultural resources present on ranges is governed by an approved 
Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan IAW AFMAN 32-7003. 
 
62 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
7.2.3.  Each Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan and Integrated Cultural Resources 
Management Plan is written to support the current and future known mission requirements 
identified in the Range Capabilities Development Plan and shall be amended as mission 
requirements change. 
7.3.  Mission Sustainment.  Range hazards must be identified and managed to ensure mission 
readiness, adequate natural infrastructure (air, land, and water) and frequency spectrum are 
available to test, train, and perform the Air Force’s varied missions at its ranges. These resources 
can be degraded or denied in some locations due to environmental issues or encroachment. 
Encroachment (defined in AFI 90-2001, Mission Sustainment) comes in many forms, but often 
results in diminished operations or significant workarounds, inconveniences, and additional costs. 
7.3.1.  The range operating authority’s Installation Mission Sustainment Team (IMST) will 
ensure the installation’s Mission Sustainment Risk Reports (MSSRs) document all hazards 
which adversely affect, or have the potential to affect, mission operations within ranges or 
associated airspace. (T-3) Internal factors include, but are not limited to, wetlands, threatened 
and endangered species, hazardous waste sites, military frequency spectrum competition, and 
UXO. External factors include, but are not limited to, incompatible land use zoning, frequency 
spectrum restrictions, physical obstructions and renewable energy projects, and local and 
regional environmental constraints. The range operating authority will work with the IMST to 
minimize external and internal encroachment impacts to the range through the Mission 
Sustainment Risk Management Process. (T-2) 
7.3.2.  Environmentally-Sensitive Buffer Areas.  Many range areas are bordered by 
environmentally-sensitive open space whose management is balanced to support both military 
training and natural ecosystems.  The Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration 
(REPI) program purchases development easements from willing land owners managed by 
private conservation groups to help ensure the continued viability of training lands by 
removing the potential for incompatible development.  These are often habitat areas for 
endangered species and may come with restrictions that affect training like avoiding nearby 
portions of the range during mating or migration seasons.  Coordination with the partner 
organization managing the REPI easements is recommended to ensure that covenants are 
respected by all parties. 
7.4.  Pollution Prevention.  Range operating authorities shall identify opportunities to optimize 
range processes or activities in terms of pollutant reduction, maximization of solid waste diversion, 
lower energy use, reduction in the use of natural resources, water conservation and improvements 
to health and safety IAW DAFI 32-7001. 
7.5.  Operational Range Assessment Program.  Ranges shall work with the supporting CE 
environmental office and AFCEC to conduct operational range assessments IAW DoDD 4715.11, 
DoDD 4715.12, DoDI 4715.14, and DAFPAM 32-7003, Operational Range Assessment Program 
Management. (T-0) 
7.6.  Environmental Restoration Program.  As necessary, range operating authorities will 
support environmental response actions (e.g., the identification and investigation of releases, 
removal actions or remedial actions) for a release or substantial threat of a release of hazardous 
substances, pollutants or contaminants on a range or migrating from a range to off-range areas in 
accordance with DAFI 32-7020.  The Military Munitions Response Program is an Environmental 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
63 
Restoration Program, and removal of buried munitions on an operational range is a Military 
Munitions Response Program function. 
7.7.  Programming Guidance.  AFCEC will identify environmental requirements eligible for 
funding in environmental PEs. (T-1) The range operating authorities shall identify environmental 
requirements when requested by AFCEC in conjunction with their servicing environmental office.  
(T-1) AFCEC and the servicing environmental office can assist in identifying projects eligible for 
environmental funding versus environmentally related operational requirements that may be 
funded with range O&M funds. AFCEC will program projects in accordance with DAFI 32-7001, 
DAFI 32-7020 or AFI 32-7091, as appropriate in the Automated Civil Engineers System or 
successor system. 
7.8.  Environmental Impact Analysis.  As required by 32 C.F.R. Part 989 and the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Air Force must analyze the potential impacts of its actions 
upon the environment prior to making decisions on range use and associated real property actions.  
Range operating authorities shall coordinate environmental impact analysis requirements through 
their supporting installation EIAP program manager.  EIAP for comprehensive range planning, 
and for land acquisition comprising more than 1,000 acres, should be coordinated with AFCEC/ 
CZN.  Comprehensive range planning and its associated EIAP should occur, at a minimum, every 
ten years to ensure environmental impact analysis remains current with range operations. 
64 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
Chapter 8 
TRACKING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
8.1.  Reporting Requirements.  Ranges will utilize CSE to track range use such as scheduled and 
actual mission information, supporting range equipment, munitions used, etc. (T-1) Note: This 
requirement may be waived for ranges that provide Class-T service and do not manage or use 
airspace. Range operating authorities must ensure classified information, if any, is maintained 
outside of CSE. (T-1) 
8.2.  Expended Munitions Tracking.  IAW DoDD 4715.11, and DoDD 4715.12, range operating   
authorities will maintain records of all expenditures (types, quantities, locations, using 
organization, and estimated dud rates) of ammunition and explosives for each target. (T-0) Range 
operating authorities and range personnel will record data in CSE when possible and by any other 
means when not. (T-1) Note: In addition to munitions employed by range users, this requirement 
also applies to munitions employed by the range operator in support of test or training activities 
(e.g., Smokey Surface-to-Air Missiles). 
8.3.  Range Clearance Report.  This report is a detailed report of clearance events and range 
operating authorities will ensure it precisely identifies the areas that have been cleared and includes 
the number of people and the amount of money and material used to accomplish the work. (T-0) 
When closing or transferring ranges, range operating authorities will ensure the range clearance 
report is attached to the Certificate of Clearance which becomes an official document certifying 
that all dangerous and explosive materials that are reasonably possible to detect have been 
removed. (T-0) 
8.4.  Defense Readiness Reporting System.  IAW AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and 
Execution, report range readiness in the Defense Readiness Reporting System. 
8.5.  Threat Systems and Equipment Inventory.  Based on the threat systems and equipment 
required for each range as outlined in Attachment 3, each range-owning MAJCOM shall produce 
and maintain an inventory of threat systems and equipment (types and quantities) each range 
possesses and an inventory of threat systems and equipment each range requires but does not 
possess. 
8.5.1.  Include Air CTS, threat, electronic attack, and feedback and scoring systems in the 
inventory. 
8.5.2.  Provide the inventory to ACC for inclusion in the Range Capabilities Development 
Plan.

Terms 
Air Combat Training Systems—A general term referring to aircraft instrumentation pods, 
ground receiving equipment, and interface/display equipment used for live monitoring, capture, 
and replay/debrief of training missions. 
Tethered Flight Instrumentation Range Systems—These systems provide Time Space Position 
Information and model weapons impact or flyout for aircrew kill notification using ground-based 
computers, towers, and communications relays and aircraft pods or internal avionics. These 
systems also provide real-time live monitor capability for Range Training Officer oversight. 
Rangeless/Untethered Flight Instrumentation Range Systems—These systems use autonomous 
pods, aircraft avionics or recording devices of participating aircraft to provide capabilities similar 
to a tethered system. Pod-to-pod or aircraft data links can relay kill predictions to participating 
aircraft for near-real time kill notification. Rangeless/untethered systems do not provide a real- 
time live monitor data feed to a Range Training Officer.

74 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
Electronic Warfare—Locations supporting electronic warfare training must be capable of 
providing a simulated electronic threat environment for aircrew combat training. Electronic 
warfare ranges are located on a range (usually a range capable of receiving surface fires and actual 
ordnance delivery). Electronic warfare sites typically provide electronic warfare simulation and 
feedback, but are not located on a range. An electronic warfare site can be established at any 
location with proper security. Typically, they are located under or near a military training route or 
Military Operations Area. 
Electronic Warfare Range—This term has traditionally taken on a narrow definition of referring 
only to those ranges with an electronic warfare capability that is associated with and located on a 
range capable of receiving surface fires and actual ordnance delivery. However, with the 
proliferation of electronic warfare capabilities across all Air Force ranges, the term is now 
generally understood to refer to any range with an electronic warfare capability. 
Electronic Warfare Site—An electronic warfare site is a specific type of electronic warfare 
training area which is not located within the boundaries of another range. Typically, the land 
required for an electronic warfare site is minimal and they do not support actual ordnance delivery. 
They can be located at any location with proper security and are usually located under or near a 
Military Training Route or Military Operations Area. In previous versions of this publication, this 
type of training area was referred to as an Electronic Scoring Site, despite the fact that many of 
these sites did not have scoring capability. 
Emitter/Simulator—Generic terms used to describe threat equipment operated at electronic 
warfare ranges and electronic warfare sites. However, the terms could refer to a variety of 
equipment such as, but not limited to, emitter only systems, emitter-receiver-processors, and 
replica type systems. 
Encroachment—Any action by any governmental or non-governmental entity or individual that 
does, or is likely to inhibit, curtail, or impede current or future military activities within the 
installation complex and/or mission footprint; or any military activity that is, or is likely to be 
incompatible with a community’s use of its resources. 
Environmental Impact Analysis Process—The formal Air Force process for implementing the 
National Environmental Policy Act and the Council on Environmental Quality’s National 
Environmental Policy Act Regulations, used to support Air Force decision making and assess 
environmental impacts resulting from a proposed action and its reasonable alternatives. 
Environmental Planning Function—At every level of command, the environmental planning 
function is a key participant responsible for the EIAP. At the request of the proponent, the 
environmental planning function manages the preparation of environmental documents and assists 
the proponent in obtaining review of environmental documents. 
Essential Personnel—Those personnel on a range, not required for ordnance employment, that 
participate and provide essential support for the range test, training or evaluation mission. 
Examples include maneuver elements, opposition forces, instructors, evaluators, range personnel 
conducting maintenance, etc. 
Explosive Ordnance Disposal—The detection, identification, on-site evaluation, rendering safe, 
recovery, and final disposal of unexploded explosive ordnance. It may also include explosive 
ordnance that has become hazardous by damage or deterioration. 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
75 
Explosive Ordnance Disposal Personnel/Technician—Military personnel who have graduated 
from the Naval School, EOD; are assigned to a military unit with a service-defined EOD mission; 
and meet service and assigned unit requirements to perform EOD duties. EOD Personnel have 
received specialized training to address explosive and chemical agent hazards during both 
peacetime and wartime. EOD Personnel are trained and equipped to perform render safe 
procedures on nuclear, biological, chemical, and conventional munitions, and on improvised 
explosive devices. 
Final Governing Standard—A comprehensive set of country-specific substantive environmental 
provisions. A Final Governing Standard requirement is typically a technical limitation on effluent 
or discharge, or a specific management practice. Examples include technical limits on air 
emissions and wastewater discharges, as well as recordkeeping and reporting requirements. 
Hazard Area—The composite area of all WDZs, SDZs, Laser SDZs, and Directed Energy WDZs 
for all authorized weapon delivery events. 
Impact Area—The area on a range immediately surrounding a target or designated mean point of 
impact that is approved for the actual delivery of ordnance. The impact area demarcation should 
normally be no less than a) 500 feet from the center of a target or desired point of impact approved 
for live ordnance, or b) 300 feet from the center of a target or desired point of impact used solely 
for inert or practice ordnance. 
Joint Terminal Attack Controller—An individual qualified IAW Joint Publication 3-09.3 to 
provide terminal control for the delivery of weapons by aircraft. 
Joint Use—With respect to ranges, Joint Use means other MAJCOMs or services may use, as long 
as they conduct operations IAW this manual, as supplemented. With respect to range airspace, it 
means the use by civil or other military aviation when it is not active. 
Land Withdrawal—The process used as a means to transfer administrative jurisdiction from one 
federal agency to another. A withdrawal creates a title encumbrance on the land restricting an 
agency's ability to manage its lands under multiple use management principles. The restrictions 
generally segregate the lands from some or all the public land laws and some or all of the mining 
and mineral leasing laws for a specific period of time (generally 20 years for post Federal Land 
Policy and Management Act withdrawals). The Secretary of Interior is authorized to make, modify, 
extend, or revoke withdrawals. 
Laser Surface Danger Zone—Designated region or ground area where laser radiation levels may 
exceed maximum permissible exposure levels, thereby, requiring control during laser operation. 
Lead Major Command—As defined in AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization, a lead 
MAJCOM consolidates responsibilities for a particular function in a single MAJCOM, supporting 
the entire Air Force as applicable. 
License—Nuclear Regulatory Commission written authorization delegating regulatory authority 
to receive, possess, use, or transfer Byproduct, Source, or Special Nuclear Material. The Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission has issued a master materials license to the Air Force 
Radioisotope Committee, which in turn issues radioactive material permits to Air 
Force units. 
Low-Angle Strafe Target—A target specifically designed for aircraft strafe events where only 
training projectile ammunition is authorized, i.e., strafe pit.

munitions (e.g., munitions containers and packaging material; munitions debris remaining after 
munitions use, demilitarization, or disposal; and range-related debris) or potentially contains a high 
enough concentration of explosives that the material presents an explosive hazard (e.g., equipment, 
drainage systems, holding tanks, piping, or ventilation ducts that were associated with munitions 
production, demilitarization, or disposal operations). Excluded from MPPEH are: (1) Military 
munitions and military munitions-related materials, including wholly inert components (e.g., fins, 
launch tubes, containers, packaging material), that are to be used or reused for their intended 
purpose and are within a DoD Component-established munitions management system, (2) Non-
munitions-related material (e.g., horseshoes, rebar, other solid objects) and munitions debris that 
are solid metal fragments that do not realistically present an explosive hazard, and (3) Other items

with the FAA.  Military Training Routes are used by DoD to conduct low altitude navigation and 
tactical training, in instrument and visual weather conditions, below an altitude of 10,000 feet 
Mean Sea Level and at airspeeds more than 250 Knots Indicated Airspeed. Routes are established 
as Instrument Flight Rules routes or Visual Flight Rules routes. The FAA has approval authority 
to implement Instrument Flight Rules routes and the appropriate MAJCOM approves Visual Flight 
Rules route implementation. Environmental documentation is required for implementation IAW 
32 CFR Part 989. Visual Flight Rules routes are processed through the FAA via the Air Force 
Representative. Military Training Routes are published in the flight information publication AP/1B 
and charted on FAA Sectionals and DoD Low Instrument Flight Rules charts. Air Force 
Representatives assign all route numbers. 
Mission Essential Personnel—Those personnel on a range directly required for the employment 
of ordnance (air/surface/electronic attack) in a test, training or evaluation mission. This may 
include JTACs, Tactical Air Control Parties, range control officers, scorers, and any other 
personnel identified as required by the range operating authority. 
Ordnance—Boosted Munitions (forward firing): Munitions such as the Air-to-Ground Missile-

small explosive charge or pyrotechnic that marks the point of impact with a small cloud of smoke 
or flash. For example, Bomb Dummy Unit-33 practice bombs contain a Mark 4 spotting charge, 
and Mark 82 practice bombs may contain 6.25 pounds of composition C-4 high explosive. British 
1,000-pound class practice bombs may contain 50 pounds of Torpex. These bombs normally use 
a fuze to initiate the high explosive fillers. 
Target Practice—Ball projectile gun ammunition that has no explosive in the projectile. 
Live Munitions—Munitions containing a fuze and a high-explosive or incendiary warhead 
designed to detonate either prior to, upon, or shortly after impact. They can be bombs, missiles, 
rockets, bullets, etc. 
Operational Range—A range that is under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of the Secretary 
of Defense and that is used for range activities; or although not currently being used for range 
activities that is still considered by the Secretary to be a range and has not been put to a new use

joint use by the ANG for weapons delivery operations. 
Inactive Range—For the purposes of this manual, an inactive range is an operational range that is 
still considered to be a range and has not been put to a new use that is incompatible with range 
activities. 
Range Clearance—Range clearance (previously known as “range residue clearance,” “range 
decontamination,” or “EOD clearance”) is the surface-removal or disposal of MPPEH from the 
targets and surrounding areas. MPPEH includes UXO, classified ordnance, inert ordnance debris, 
and any other range material fired on, or upon a military range. 
Range Clearance Report—A narrative statement about the removal and disposal of UXO and 
MPPEH on a specific range and serves as a factual record of the debris clearance. Also known as 
a “Report of Clearance,” it is not a “Certificate of Clearance” (defined above). 
Range Control Officer—The person with primary responsibility for matters of range safety 
during aircraft operations, aircraft emergencies, and ground weapons fire activities during active 
events of this nature occurring on the range. Weapons release clearance authority resides with the 
range control officer (except where the range control officer has specifically delegated                        
this authority to a qualified flight lead, individual pilot, Forward Air Controller, or other briefed 
person). 
Range Operating Authority—The wing commander, or designated commander responsible for 
operating and maintaining the range. For ANG-operated ranges, the range commander is 
designated as the range operating authority. The range operating authority may delegate the daily 
scheduling, management, and maintenance of the range to any appropriate subordinate unit. 
AFMAN13-212V1  14 MARCH 2023 
79 
Range Operations Officer—The person who supervises range management, planning, 
maintenance, and day-to-day operations. Specific responsibilities are designated by the range 
operating authority. 
Range Service Levels—Ranges provide different levels of service dependent upon several factors, 
such as hours of manned operation, scheduled test and training activities, utilization, etc. For 
example, a MRTFB range may provide both Class A and Class T service on different parts of the 
range or at different times; a PTR may provide Class A service during daylight hours and Class C 
service during nighttime hours. 
Class A Service—Class A service provides a manned, ground-scoring and/or electronic warfare 
capable range with a range control officer present on range and controlling surface activities and 
air-to-ground operations. 
Class B Service—Class B service provides a manned or unmanned, ground scoring and/or 
electronic warfare capable range where no range control officer is present on range for controlling 
surface activities and operations. Note: Class B service includes ranges where a remotely-sited 
range operations center monitors air and ground operations and provides scoring feedback. 
Class C Service—Class C service provides an unmanned range with no scoring, no electronic 
warfare services and no range control officer control of ground activities or operations. 
Class D Service—Class D service provides an instrumented range supporting operations 
monitored by a Range Training Officer.

underlying an air-to-air range used for actual weapon employment must be protected by adequate 
physical safeguards, legally sufficient real property acquisition documentation (e.g., fee interest 
purchase, lease) or other means to ensure the safety of personnel, structures, and the public from 
expended weapons, laser and electromagnetic emissions, and target debris. 
Range Training Officer—The person responsible for monitoring Air CTS, passing kill removal, 
and providing debriefs. The Range Training Officer will establish communication with aircraft 
entering the range. 
Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration—An OSD program to purchase 
development easements from willing land owners to help ensure the continued viability of training 
lands by removing the potential for incompatible development.  REPI is authorized under 10 
U.S.C. § 2684a.  REPI enhances military readiness by preventing, mitigating, or reducing 
restrictions on the timing, frequency, and type of training activities caused by encroachment.  REPI 
promotes compatible development and protects valuable habitat that supports unconstrained 
training, testing, and operations.

of projectiles, fragments, debris, and components resulting from the firing, launching, or 
detonation of weapon systems to include explosives and demolitions. 
Surface-to-Air Test and Training—Surface-to-Air test and training covers a wide range of 
mission requirements. Ranges that support, for example, endo-atmospheric and exo- atmospheric 
missile intercepts, aeronautical system testing, and ballistic missiles require a substantial amount 
of range space and a sophisticated range infrastructure. This infrastructure may include high 
fidelity simulators, visual simulators, end-game scoring capabilities, command and control 
systems, communication networks, data display/processing capabilities, instrumentation systems, 
flight termination systems, and flight hazard analysis/strike prediction capability. 
Surface-to-Surface Test and Training—Surface-to-Surface test and training covers a wide range 
of mission requirements, including survivability test, horizontal and vertical live-fire events, 
surface and subsurface tests in international waters, research and development, directed energy 
weapon, explosives operations, heavy weapons qualification, and EOD thermal treatment and 
disposal. Ranges that support Special Operations Forces and other ground test and training 
requirements may require substantial ground infrastructure, including shoot houses, urban villages, 
laser scoring, in-band imaging, complex communication and instrumentation, range surveillance 
radars and other facilities. 
Test Areas Control Officer—The person responsible for range operations and safety at a test site 
when no air-to-ground weapons release authority is needed. 
Test Sites—These sites are developed and used for specific developmental test and evaluation and 
operational test and evaluation requirements. They are considered ranges under this manual due to 
the scope, nature, and frequency of conducting many of the defined range activities. 
Unexploded Ordnance—As set forth at 10 U.S.C. § 101(e)(5), the term “UXO” means military 
munitions that— (A)have been primed, fuzed, armed, or otherwise prepared for action. (B)have

waters, contiguous zones, and ocean waters of which the natural resources are under the exclusive 
management authority of the United States. 
Urban Training Facility—Facilities constructed for the primary purpose of training in an urban 
environment. They include instrumentation, communications infrastructure, and the population 
needed to create a physical urban environment and capabilities to conduct training in that 
environment. Facilities can be composed of buildings, subterranean infrastructure, airfields, and 
representative building shells, bridges, tunnels, etc., that constitute target arrays for fixed and 
rotary wing aircraft. All urban training facilities will support live training, however, based on the
