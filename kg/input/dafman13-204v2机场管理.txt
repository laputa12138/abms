This Department of the Air Force Manual (DAFMAN) implements Air Force Policy Directive 
(AFPD) 13-2, Air Traffic Control, Airfield, Airspace and Range Management.  This publication 
applies to all civilian employees and uniformed members of the United States Space Force (USSF), 
Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air Force Reserve (AFR), and Air National Guard (ANG), and 
organizations (to include those at contracted locations) who operate or administer functions and 
facilities for Airfield Management (AM).  At joint, shared-use, and overseas airfields, this manual 
applies to the facilities controlled and used exclusively by the Department of the Air Force (DAF), 
as outlined in international agreements, real estate documents or other written agreements.  This 
manual outlines key duties, responsibilities, and position qualification requirements of AM 
personnel.  This manual also provides detailed guidance, procedures and programs for managing 
AM where the Air Force has functional oversight responsibility.  This manual may be 
supplemented at any level; however, all Major Command (MAJCOM) supplements to include 
interim changes to previously approved supplements must be routed to Air Force Flight Standards 
Agency, Airfield Operations Division (AFFSA/XA) for coordination prior to certification and 
approval.  References to MAJCOM within this publication refer to the MAJCOM Office of 
Primary Responsibility (OPR) for Airfield Operations.  Unit (wing or base) level supplements to 
this publication must be routed to the responsible MAJCOM OPR for Airfield Operations for 
coordination prior to certification and approval.  The authorities to waive wing, unit, delta, or 
garrison level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) 
number following the compliance statement. See DAFMAN 90-161, Publishing Processes and 
Procedures, Table A10.1 for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers.

DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval 
authority, or alternately, to the squadron commander for non-tiered compliance items or 
requirements.  Refer to Chapter 1 for additional waiver requirements to this manual.  Ensure all 
records generated as a result of processes prescribed in this publication adhere to Air Force 
Instruction 33-322, Records Management and Information Governance Program, and are disposed 
as outlined in the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, which is located in the Air Force 
Records Information Management System.  Refer recommended changes and questions about this 
publication to the office of primary responsibility using the DAF Form 847, Recommendation for 
Change of Publication; route DAF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional 
chain of command.  The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial 
product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the DAF. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  Major changes 
include the changing publication from an Air Force Manual (AFMAN) to DAFMAN; functionally 
realigned AM guidance, procedures, and programs into a single publication; complied with 
Secretary of the Air Force policy memorandums to improve clarity, reduce compliance statements, 
and ensure waiver approvals and authorities reside at the lowest acceptable level.

Chapter 1 
GENERAL 
1.1.  Overview.  This manual provides guidance for managing AM personnel, programs, facilities, 
and airfields Air Force-wide.  This manual is complemented by AFMAN 13-204, Volume 1, 
Management of Airfield Operations.  
1.2.  The Military and Civilian Aviation Integration Division.  The Military and Civilian 
Aviation Integration Division, Career Field Management is responsible for Air Force Specialty 
Codes (AFSCs) 13MX, Airfield Operations officer; 1C1X1, Air Traffic Control (ATC); 1C7X1, 
Airfield Management, and 1C8X3, Radar, Airfield and Weather Systems (RAWS).  Career Field 
Manager (CFM) duties will be executed referenced in AFMAN 36-2100, Military Utilization and 
Classification, DAFI 36-2670, Total Force Development, DAFMAN 36-2689, Training Program, 
and AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization.  This list is not exclusive. 
1.3.  Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA).  AFFSA is responsible for terminal area 
airfield operations (i.e., ATC, AM and RAWS) matters.  In this capacity, AFFSA executes 
responsibilities guided by Air Force Mission Directive (AFMD) 27, Air Force Flight Standards 
Agency (AFFSA), in keeping with policy guidance provided by the Air Staff.  For the purpose of 
addressing specific procedural, training, standardization, architecture and integration issues 
directly related to airfield operations, AFFSA may have cause to interact with the MAJCOMs, 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and other military services. 
1.4.  Operations at Contingency Locations.  Contingency is defined as a situation requiring 
military operations in response to natural disasters, terrorists, subversives, or as otherwise directed 
by appropriate authority to protect United States interests.  At contingency locations, outside the 
United States, the Senior Airfield Authority (SAA) may waive airfield operations procedures 
outlined in this manual to support tactical or combat operations.  This authority must not be 
exercised below the SAA level.  (T-1)  Prior to issuance of such a waiver, the following actions 
must be accomplished: 
1.4.1.  Conduct a risk management assessment with the rationale for the waiver and explain 
how (1)  complying with the requirement/compliance item impacts mission accomplishment, 
OR how (2) cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower) 
creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; OR how (3) expected cost of compliance 
outweighs the benefit; OR how (4) personnel cannot comply with the requirement due to a lack 
of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower).  Note: SAA waiver 
period must not exceed requested waiver period or 30 calendar days after the approving 
commander’s deployment length, whichever is shorter.  (T-1)  Because waivers are the 
expression of a specific commander’s risk acceptance, approved waivers automatically expire 
30 calendar days after a change in commander, unless the new commander renews the waiver. 
1.4.2.  Forward proposed waivers to the Air Force forces staff or equivalent for an operational 
review if time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA. 
1.4.3.  Refer to Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-4.13 Volume 2, 
Contingency Airfield Operations for additional information.  This AFTTP outlines how Air 
Force Forces open and operate a deployed or contingency airfield.  This AFTTP volume also 
6 
DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
contains planning considerations for AM, ATC, and deployable air traffic control and landing 
systems capabilities, procedures, forces, and equipment. 
1.5.  Airfields Operated Pursuant to Contract.  This manual applies to locations where 
Department of Defense (DoD) or Air Force access is pursuant to contract, to the extent specifically 
outlined in the contract statement of work (SOW) and/or performance work statement (PWS).  
Locations unable to comply with these criteria due to pre-existing SOWs/PWSs are exempt until 
such time that the current contract expires.  Locations that exclude this manual, must specifically 
state rationale for the exclusion in the SOW/PWS.  (T-2)  
1.6.  Overseas Locations.  Any host nation procedures, or procedures based on otherwise 
inapplicable international regulations that are being implemented to fulfill basing or similar 
agreements should be implemented consistent with this manual to the extent possible.  While 
agreed practices adopted for Air Force use in overseas areas take precedence, every effort should 
be made to conform to this manual. 
1.6.1.  MAJCOMs must identify any special procedures agreed with host nations in their 
supplement to this manual.  Refer conflicting procedures to Headquarters (HQ) AFFSA prior 
to implementation. 
1.6.2.  Airfield operations personnel augmenting a facility operated by another branch of the 
United States (U.S.) military will comply with their regulations and procedures as applicable.  
(T-0) 
1.7.  Waivers. 
1.7.1.  Units must use the DAF Form 679, Department of the Air Force Publication 
Compliance Item Waiver Request/Approval to process waivers to this manual.  (T-1)  
1.7.2.  Unit waiver requests must include the following: 
1.7.2.1.  A paragraph reference or text of the specific requirement for which the 
commander/director is requesting a waiver.  (T-1)  
1.7.2.2.  Rationale for the waiver.  (T-1) Explain which one of the following reasons apply 
and why: (1) How complying with the requirement/compliance item impacts mission 
accomplishment, (2) Cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance 
or manpower) creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; or (3) Expected cost of 
compliance outweighs the benefit; OR (4) personnel cannot comply with the requirement 
due to a lack of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower). 
1.7.2.3.  Time period or circumstance the waiver is needed.  (T-1)  Note: Tier 1, 2, and 3 
waivers may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver period or 90 
calendar after the approving commander’s tour length, whichever is shorter.  Because 
waivers are the expression of a specific commander’s risk acceptance, approved waivers 
automatically expire 90 calendar days after a change in commander unless the new 
commander renews the waiver. 
1.7.2.4.  Risk mitigation measures to be implemented, if necessary, by the requesting 
commander during the waiver period.  (T-1) 
1.7.2.5.  Impact if waiver is disapproved.  (T-1) 
DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
7 
1.7.3.  If deemed necessary, submit additional data (e.g., local operating procedure (LOP), 
airspace maps, traffic patterns, airfield diagrams) to substantiate the waiver request. 
1.7.4.  Units must provide an informational copy of all Tier 3 approved waivers to MAJCOM 
OPR for airfield operations.  (T-2)  
1.7.5.  Units will submit waivers to applicable FAA publications through their respective 
commander for coordination from the MAJCOM OPR for airfield operations, AFFSA/XA and 
the appropriate Air Force representative. (T-0)  The Air Force representative submits the 
request to FAA and notifies the requesting unit, MAJCOM OPR for airfield operations, and 
AFFSA/XA of the results. 
1.7.6.  The requestor’s unit commander must forward a copy of the approved waiver to the 
AFFSA/XA workflow at hqaffsa.xa@us.af.mil within 30 calendar days of approval for 
situational awareness and process improvement considerations.  (T-1)  
1.7.7.  Approved waivers become part of the approvers and requestor’s official records and are 
appropriately filed as guided by criteria in AFI 33-322.  (T-1)  
1.8.  Governing Directives.  Airfield operations services are governed by AFIs, AFMANs, 
DAFI’s, DAFMAN’s and, to the extent applicable, FAA orders, parts of the Code of Federal 
Regulations, and any host nation procedures which have been adopted for Air Force use, unless 
specifically exempted or waived.  Unit commanders may contact AFFSA through their respective 
MAJCOM OPR for assistance determining the applicability of directives. 
1.9.  Issuing New Air Force Airfield Operations Policy or Procedures.  New policies or 
procedures are sent out via message and posted on the AFFSA Airfield Operations SharePoint® 
website 
https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/affsa/SitePages/Airfield-Operations.aspx 
 
 
Airfield 
operations staff personnel are required to utilize the AFFSA Airfield Operations SharePoint® 
website to download and/or view messages. 
1.10.  Duty Titles.  Duty Titles are determined by the unit manpower document authorizations 
earned through the 32F Airfield Operations- Air Force Manpower Determinant. Failure to use 
authorizations as described and earned on the unit manpower document could result in the 
reduction of authorizations or removal of personnel (not applicable to ANG and AFR).  DoD 
civilian and contractor duty titles will be identified by guidance within AFMAN 13-204 V1.

Chapter 6 
AIRFIELD RESTRICTIONS AND CLOSURE PROCEDURES 
6.1.  Airfield Restrictions.  At Air Force bases, joint or shared use airfields, overseas bases, and 
associated airfields where the Air Force has senior airfield authority, the host Air Force AM 
personnel will, when appropriate impose the following operational airfield restrictions and 
closures below:  Note 1:  These procedures must be clearly defined in the AOI as appropriate.  
(T-1) Note 2: For ANG locations with shared-use/civilian airfields, where AM is operated by a 
civil airport authority coordinate with them as required.  At those locations where airfield 
restriction/closure procedures are not specified and/or delegated to AM by a LOA with the civil 
airport authority, AM still retains the authority to suspend airfield operations to all military traffic.  
Ensure the unit specific procedures are outlined in the AOI. 
6.1.1.  Close, suspend, and resume airfield, runway, or taxiway operations.  (T-2) 
6.1.2.  Temporarily suspend or close runway operations when any unsafe condition affects 
runway operations (e.g., FOD, severe bird/wildlife activity, snow and ice removal checks, 
arresting systems maintenance/configuration changes, airfield construction, and pavement 
repair).  (T-2) 
6.1.3.  Temporarily close an airfield to all traffic during hazardous weather such as tornadoes, 
hurricanes, or typhoons.  (T-2) 
6.1.4.  Limit operations to specific types of aircraft.  (T-2)  Note:  Airfield restrictions 
establishing limitations on the number or type of aircraft using an airfield will be coordinated 
with MAJCOM, host nation (as applicable), WG/CC, OG/CC, AOF/CC and CP.  (T-2) 
6.1.5.  Limit transient aircraft traffic to official business only and/or PPR.  (T-2)  Exception:  
Aircraft carrying a Distinguish Visitor Code 6 or higher or aircraft experiencing an emergency, 
aero medical evacuation or special air missions are also exempt from OBO restrictions, but are 
required to obtain a PPR number for tracking and notification.  Aircrew may use official 
business only/PPR facilities as an alternate for IFR flights when a landing at the intended 
destination becomes inadvisable. Note: ANG units will ensure that local procedures are 
developed for OBO or PPR restrictions and that they are included in the FLIPs.  (T-2) 
6.1.6.  Restrict airfield use due to classified operations when normal activity would 
compromise security.  (T-2) 
6.1.7.  Restrict airfield use when facilities and services are reduced or lack sufficient resources 
(e.g., for limited transient services, limited apron parking space, major construction, and 
reduced aircraft rescue and firefighting capability).  (T-2) 
6.1.8.  Prohibit low approaches, restricted low approaches, and practice landings when airfield 
activities (e.g., construction, snow and ice removal operations, and grass cutting activities) are 
in the vicinity of or on the runway.  (T-2)  Note:  Coordinate these types of restrictions with 
the OG/CC through the AOF/CC and notify Wing and tenant flying units.  (T-2) 
6.1.9.  Restrict use of an airfield during Night Vision Devices or blacked-out airfield operations 
to reduce the potential of normal activity compromising safety.  (T-2) 
6.2.  Procedures.  AM personnel must: 
52 
DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
6.2.1.  Notify appropriate agencies (e.g., ATC and CP).  (T-3)  Note: Airfields owned and 
operated by the ANG will report closures, other than published in FLIPs, and other restrictions 
to the ANG Command Center and issue the necessary NOTAM.  (T-3) 
6.2.2.  Provide an estimated time runway operations are expected to resume following the 
announcement of a suspension/closure.  (T-3) 
6.2.3.  Conduct a runway check and report the status prior to resuming normal operations.

Chapter 7 
PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING AND REPORTING RUNWAY SURFACE 
CONDITION  AND RUNWAY CONDITION READING 
7.1.  General. 
7.1.1.  The presence of contaminants such as water, snow, ice, or slush on airfield pavements 
causes hazardous conditions that may contribute to aircraft incidents and accidents.  Further, 
winter storm conditions usually cause flight delays and/or cancellations and, in severe storm 
conditions, airfield closures. Continual monitoring, assessing, and a proactive approach from 
AM and the snow/ice removal team are the best practices to prevent delays, mishaps, and other 
potential negative events resulting from contaminants on airfield pavements.  This chapter 
provides guidance and procedures for assessing airfield conditions. 
7.1.2.  When approved by MAJCOM/A3 (normally in a MAJCOM supplement), locations 
with an airfield that have little or no record of snow accumulation (based on the installation’s 
climatology record) are not required to maintain friction measuring equipment 
(Decelerometers and Continuous Friction Measuring Equipment).  However, AM personnel 
must still report the predominant RSC and indicate no RCR available.  (T-2) 
7.1.3.  Runways with historical drainage problems may require units to take more restrictive 
actions for reporting the RSC such as publishing restrictions or closures due to severe ponding, 
flooding and the potential for reduced braking action/hydroplaning. 
7.1.4.  RSC determination and reporting procedures may differ at joint or shared use airfields.  
Note:  The AFM must include these procedures in the AOI.  (T-3) 
7.1.5.  USAF AM personnel do not determine or report a Runway Condition Code (RwyCC) 
nor issue a FAA formatted field condition NOTAM (FICON) or ICAO global reporting format.  
Where applicable, units must ensure a NOTAM is published to advise civil and military pilots 
“RwyCC not reported”.  (T-0)  The NOTAM must remain active until a DoD FLIP change is 
submitted and published in the IFR Supplement.  (T-0) 
7.1.6.  Wet Runway.  When water is the only form of visible moisture on 25% or more of the 
runway surface area (whether in isolated areas or not), report the RSC as "wet runway" and no 
RCR.  (T-2)  Note: Reason for not reporting RCR value is that Air Force, FAA and National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration tests have proven RCR measurements are inconclusive 
and invalid where the only form of moisture affecting the runway is water. 
7.1.7.  Runway treated with chemicals.  When liquid chemical has been applied to airfield 
surfaces, RCR’s should still be conducted and reported until a reading equivalent to or better 
than a “wet concrete” condition is achieved as described in T.O. 33-1-23, Equipment and 
Procedures for Obtaining Runway Condition Readings, Table 3, or as outline in local OI. 
7.1.8.  Units must specify in the AOI when other agencies are delegated the responsibility to 
determine and report RSC Wet.  (T-3)  Regardless who determines the RSC Wet, the runway 
must be reported Wet as outlined in paragraph 7.2.3  (T-2) 
7.1.9.  Friction Measuring Equipment.  There are two basic types of friction measuring 
equipment available that can be used to obtain runway condition readings during winter 
54 
DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
operations.  They are the Decelerometers (DEC) and Continuous Friction Measuring 
Equipment (CFME).  
7.1.9.1.  Decelerometers.  There are two types of DEC available: electronic and 
mechanical. Electronic DEC automatically compute and record friction averages for each 
portion of the runway.  They also provide a printed record of the friction survey data. 
Mechanical DEC require the user to manually record test data.  They do not provide 
automatic friction averages.  The devices listed in Technical Order 33-1-23, Table 1 are 
considered approved DEC for AF use.  Electronic DEC are not stock listed.  Units are 
authorized to purchase them locally.  Use approved electronic DEC as guidance identifies 
within Technical Order 33-1-23.  Note: DEC should not be installed in vehicles equipped 
with full Antilock Braking Systems (ABS), because the ABS tends to distort the sensitivity 
of the DEC resulting in friction readings that are lower than actually exists.  This could 
result in the premature closing of runways.  Differences in ABS systems result in high 
variations in friction readings. 
7.1.9.2.  Continuous Friction Measuring Equipment.  CFME provide a continuous graphic 
record of the pavement surface friction characteristics with friction averages for each 
portion of the runway length.  They may be either self-contained or towed.  Note:  There 
are no minimum vehicle requirements for tow type CFME pull vehicles.  The pull vehicle 
may be ABS or non-ABS equipped.  All CFME which are approved by FAA will be 
considered approved for AF use.  See FAA’s advisory circular AC 150/5320-12C for a 
current list of approved devices.  Copies of FAA’s airports advisory circulars are available 
on 
the 
FAA 
website 
at 
http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index. 
The 
approved 
CFME are not stock listed.  Units are authorized to purchase them locally.  Approved 
CFME may be used in accordance with FAA and manufacturer’s guidelines. 
7.2.  RSC and RCR Procedures.  AM personnel will: 
7.2.1.  Use this chapter and Technical Order 33-1-23 to determine RSC and RCR when the 
airfield is open.  (T-2) 
7.2.1.1.  Use Air Force Technical Order Form 277, Results of Runway Braking Test, when 
reporting RCRs.  (T-3)  Note:  Electronic reporting data is acceptable when produced by 
an electronic DEC and or CFME. 
7.2.1.2.  Estimate and report RSC to the nearest 1/10 of an inch according to Technical 
Order 33-1-23.  (T-2)  Note:  Pilots determine braking action for slush and wet runways 
from aircraft technical order data. 
7.2.1.3.  DEC or CFME values are not reliable when water is the only containment on the 
runway or landing surface.  For the purpose of mission planning, aircraft departures and 
arrivals (i.e., takeoff and landing), it is not acceptable to use decelerometers or continuous 
friction measuring equipment to determine or report a runway condition reading when 
water is the only contaminant on the runway or landing surface. 
7.2.1.4.  Document RSC and RCR actions in the AF Form 3616 or suitable substitute.  
(T-3) 
7.2.2.  Conduct RSC and RCR checks.  (T-2) 
DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
55 
7.2.2.1.  RCR checks are required when the RSC is reported as “Wet Runway” or “Slush 
on Runway” and the possibility of freezing (40 F or lower) conditions exist.  (T-2) 
7.2.2.2.  Use FAA-approved friction measuring equipment to conduct RCR checks.  (T-2) 
7.2.2.3.  When the RCR is 12 or less, conduct RCR checks as frequently as normal flying 
operations allow and before each aircraft landing during low flying operations.  (T-3) 
7.2.2.4.  During rapidly changing conditions (e.g., increased snow fall, treatment of 
landing/taxiing surfaces, and temperature changes), conduct RSC and RCR checks more 
frequently to provide aircrews with the most timely and accurate information.  (T-3) 
7.2.2.5.  Conduct a physical check of the runway to determine RSC Dry.  (T-2) 
7.2.3.  Report RSC and RCR.  (T-1) 
7.2.3.1.  Wet Runway.  AM personnel will report the RSC as "Wet Runway" and no RCR 
when water is the only form of visible moisture on 25% or more of the runway surface area 
(whether in isolated areas or not).  (T-1)  Note:  AM personnel must also report the 
existence, location and depth of any standing water (ponding, water patches, and puddles) 
regardless of a Wet or Dry RSC.  (T-1) 
7.2.3.2.  Slush on Runway.  AM personnel must report RSC as "Slush on Runway” and no 
RCR when slush is on the runway and ice or snow is not present.  (T-2)  Do not test runway. 
7.2.3.3.  Ice or Snow on Runway. 
7.2.3.3.1.  For single-type surface runway, AM personnel must report the predominant 
RSC and the average RCR, when applicable, for the covered portions of the runway.  
(T-2) 
7.2.3.3.2.  When the runway surface consists of two pavement surfaces with 
significantly different friction characteristics, such as concrete and porous friction 
surfaces, AM personnel must report the predominant RSC and RCR for the runway 
touchdown zones and, if applicable, for the middle or roll-out portion of the runway.  
(T-1)  
7.2.3.3.3.  When using friction-measuring equipment, AM personnel must round down 
if the reading is not a whole number (e.g., Reading 11.2, indicate 11; for 11.8, indicate 
11).  (T-1)   
7.2.3.3.4.  When ice or snow is on the runway, AM personnel must report the RSC as 
one of the following:  Loose Snow on Runway (LSR), Packed Snow on Runway (PSR), 
or Ice on Runway (IR).  (T-1) 
7.2.3.4.  Water or Slush and Ice on Runway.  When water or slush is present on an ice 
covered runway, AM personnel must report the predominant RSC.  (T-2)  Report the RCR 
or use the value 12, whichever is lower.  (T-2) 
7.2.3.5.  Runway Partially Covered with Ice or Snow.  When the runway is partially 
covered with ice or snow, AM personnel must report: 
7.2.3.5.1.  One RSC for those parts of the runway that are completely covered.  (T-2)  
7.2.3.5.2.  An RSC for the rest of the runway.  (T-2) 
56 
DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
7.2.3.5.3.  An average RCR that is representative of those parts of the runway that are 
completely covered with snow or ice.  (T-2)  
7.2.3.6.  Other Information.  AM personnel must identify and report other information 
essential to safe aircraft operations in clear text following the RSC and RCR data.  (T-2)  
Examples include but are not limited to: 
7.2.3.6.1.  The extent or depth of any precipitation on the runway. 
7.2.3.6.2.  Location of precipitation on partially covered runways (e.g., touchdown 
area, rollout area). 
7.2.3.7.  AM personnel must report RSC and RCR data to ATC, radar approach control or 
ground control approach facility, weather, and CP.  (T-2)  AFM determines if additional 
agencies should receive notification. 
7.2.3.8.  AM personnel must send a NOTAM to report the surface condition (other than 
Dry) and/or friction reading for runway.  (T-2)  Send a NOTAM to report taxiway and 
ramp areas as required in Snow and Ice Control Plan.  (T-3) 
7.2.3.9.  AM personnel must send a NOTAM and notify control tower, radar approach 
control or ground control approach facility, maintenance operations control center, 
command post and transient alert when chemicals are being applied to airfield pavements 
(e.g., runway, taxiway, and apron).  (T-2) 
7.2.3.10.  AM personnel must send a Flight Advisory message and/or notify the Air Route 
Traffic Control Center as required to alert inbound aircraft of possible delays and/or poor 
braking action.  (T-3)  See AFMAN 11-213 and FAA Order JO 7110.10BB, Flight 
Services, for guidance.  (T-2)  Send RSC “Wet with chemical” NOTAM only when a “wet 
concrete” condition is achieved as referenced in paragraph 7.1.7.  (T-2)  AM personnel 
should work with Snow Control Center to determine when the chemical agent has dissolved 
enough to cancel NOTAM. 
7.2.3.11.  AM personnel should use remarks such as sanded, patchy Wet or patchy Dry in 
conjunction with RSC conditions (e.g., Loose Snow on Runway, Pack Snow on Runway, 
or Ice on Runway).  If possible, identify the location of the patchy conditions.

Operations Shift Lead/Supervisor.  There is a 5-Level QTP required for 5-Level 
upgrade and a 7-Level QTP required for 7-Level upgrade.  The PCGs and QTPs are 
available through AFFSA/XA SharePoint® website. PCGs and QTPs are developed by 
the 1C7X1 CFM, HQ AFFSA and MAJCOM Functional Managers to standardize AM 
duty position qualification training requirements. 
8.2.1.5.2.  The NAMT will use PCGs, QTPs, and associated publications, DAF Form 
623A, DAF Form 803, and DAF Form 797 or electronic training record format 
equivalent to plan, conduct, and certify qualification training.  (T-2)  Note:  Refer to 
PCG and QTP for documentation requirements, when to complete, and time limits. 
8.2.1.5.3.  The NAMT develops PCG lessons for local training items to be documented 
on the DAF Form 797 or electronic training record format equivalent.  When 
developing local items into PCG lessons, use the same format as the standardized AM 
PCGs (e.g., Airfield Manager PCG and AMSL/AMOS PCG).  (T-3)

74 
DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
Master Task Listing (MTL)—All work center/facility tasks and corresponding technical 
reference that supports qualification, upgrade, recurring, review, and specialized training. 
Master Training Plan (MTP)—Employs a strategy for ensuring the completion of all work center 
job requirements by using a MTL and provides milestones for task, Career Development Course 
completion, and prioritizes deployment/Unit Type Code (UTC), home station training tasks, 
upgrade, and qualification tasks. 
Military Airspace Management Course—This course is an advanced flight operation course, 
providing training for selected Department of Defense (DoD) personnel in the knowledge and 
skills needed to perform the duties of Military Airspace Managers.  The scope of training includes 
the National Airspace System including the Next Generation Air Transportation System 
(NEXGEN), structure of the FAA, Joint  DoD Responsibilities, categories of military airspace, 
services to military aircraft engaged in flight operations, military airspace charting, strategic 
guidance of airspace acquisition, development of military airspace proposals, environmental 
aspects of military flight operations, obtaining exercise airspace, planning for future airspace 
requirements, and international rules and procedures. 
Mishap—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage 
or injury and meets Class A, B, C, D or Class E event reporting criteria as identified by guidance 
in DAFI 91-204.  Damage or injury includes: damage to DoD property (excluding normal wear 
and tear or aging); occupational illness to DoD military or civilian personnel; injury to DoD 
military personnel on or off-duty; injury to on-duty DoD civilian personnel; damage to public or 
private property, or injury or illness to non-DoD personnel caused by Air Force operations. 
Objective—A statement that specifies what behavior is to be exhibited, the conditions under 
which behavior will be accomplished and the minimum standard of performance.  Objectives 
describe only the behaviors that directly lead to or specifically satisfy a job performance 
requirement.  An objective is a statement of instructional intent. 
On—the-Job Training (OJT)—Hands-on, over-the-shoulder training conducted to certify 
personnel in both upgrade and job qualification training. 
Overrun—Usually a non-stressed extension at each end of the runway.  The extension is not used 
as a landing area, except in instances where an aircraft emergency warrants its use. The extension 
is part of the controlled movement area, but do not used for spacing/separation between aircraft. 
Position Certification Guide (PCG)—PCGs are documents used to assist the trainer and 
supervisor in logically training airfield operations personnel in a specific duty position. 
Prior Permission Required (PPR)—The airfield is closed to transient aircraft unless approval 
for operation is obtained from the appropriate commander through AM.  PPR must be requested 
and approved before the flight departs to that airfield.  The purpose of PPR is to control volume 
and flow of traffic rather than to prohibit it.  Prior permission is required for all aircraft requiring 
transient alert service outside the published transient alert duty hours.  All aircraft carrying 
hazardous materials must adhere to guidance as outlined in Defense Transportation Regulations. 
Qualification Training Package (QTP)—An instructional package designed for use at the unit 
to qualify, or aid qualification, in a duty position or program, or on a piece of equipment. It may 
be printed, computer-based, or in other audiovisual media. 
DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
75 
Radar Approach Control (RAPCON)—A fixed, mobile, or transportable radar facility that 
provides approach control, arrival and RFC services using surveillance radar. 
Recurring Training—Training provided to periodically review selected current operational 
procedures and techniques. 
Runway Closure—Occurs when a condition requires restricting aircraft arrivals and departures 
for an extended period until corrected. (e.g., snow and ice removal operations, construction/repair 
activities, and aircraft mishaps).  
Runway Condition Reading (RCR)—A numerical decelerometer reading relayed by air traffic 
controllers at Air Force and certain civil bases for use by the pilot in determining runway braking 
action. These readings are routinely relayed only to Air Force and ANG Aircraft. 
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an 
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff 
of aircraft.  For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA. Runway 
incursions have the potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are 
several factors involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from 
failure to follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational 
awareness. These are further classified into three operational categories: 
(1)  Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of 
separation. 
(2)  Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions, 
AFIs and/or FARs. 
(3)  Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation (V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled movement 
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been 
authorized by Air Traffic Control. 
Runway Surface Condition (RSC)—Identifies the condition of the runway surface when covered 
with slush, snow, ice or water. 
Runway Suspension—Occurs when a short-term condition requires temporarily restricting 
aircraft arrivals and departures until corrected (e.g., in-flight/ground aircraft recovery operations, 
FOD removal, dispersal of severe bird/wildlife activity, snow and ice removal checks, aircraft 
arresting systems maintenance/configuration changes, airfield construction, pavement repair). 
Scheduled Air Carrier—An air carrier that holds a scheduled air carrier certificate and provides 
scheduled service year-round between two or more points. 
Senior Airfield Authority (SAA)—The SAA is an individual appointed by the component 
responsible for airfield operations at the direction of the joint force commander. The SAA is 
responsible for the control, operation, and maintenance of the airfield, to include deployable air 
traffic control and landing systems, the runways, associated taxiways, and parking ramps, as well 
as air, land, safety surfaces, and facilities of which proximity affects airfield operations. 
Shared Use—An airfield jointly used by civil and military flight activities that is located at a civil 
airport under control of civil authorities. 
Skill Level—The level of qualification within an awarded Air Force specialty, shown by the fourth 
digit of the Air Force Specialty Code. 
76 
DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
Specialty Experience Identifier (SEI)—A three-character code that identifies special experience 
training not otherwise identified in the personnel data system.  Specialty Experience Identifiers 
may permit rapid identification of individuals with special qualifications to meet peacetime 
assignments.  They provide a means for identifying critical manning requirements during wartime 
or contingency operations when little lead time is available for training personnel in specific 
technical skills.   
Specialty Training Standard (STS)—An Air Force publication that describes an Air Force 
specialty in terms of tasks and knowledge which an airman in that specialty may be expected to 
perform and identifies the training provided to achieve a 3-, 5-, or 7-skill level within an enlisted 
Air Force specialty.  It further serves as a contract between Air Education and Training Command 
and the functional user to show the overall training requirements for an Air Force specialty code 
that are taught in formal schools and correspondence schools. 
Stop Training—When a trainee is unable to accomplish knowledge based (including classroom 
instruction), simulator (including static scenarios), and On-the-Job Training (OJT) due to 
unforeseen events or inability to meet standards. 
Supervisor of Flying (SOF)—A rated officer authorized by the flying unit commander to monitor 
and supervise current flight operations. A Supervisor of Flying may perform duties from the 
control tower. 
Supplemental Training—Training for a portion of an Air Force Specialty without a change in 
AFSC.  Formal training on new equipment, methods and technology that is not suited for on-the- 
job training. 
Task—A unit of work activity or operation that forms a significant part of a duty.  A task usually 
has clear beginning and ending points and directly observable or otherwise measurable processes, 
frequently but not always resulting in a product that can be evaluated for quantity, quality or fitness 
in the work environment.  A task is performed for its own sake; that is, it is not dependent upon 
other tasks, although it may fall in a sequence with other tasks in a duty or job array. 
Training Status Code—A coding system used by base education and training personnel to 
identify, change, and manage airman qualification and skill level upgrade processes.  Refer to 
DAFMAN 36-2689, Attachment 2 for a listing of each training status code and definitions. 
Unauthorized Landing—A landing at an Air Force airfield by a civil aircraft without prior 
authority (approved DD Form 2401, Civil Aircraft Landing Permit and 24 hours prior notice). 
Wet Runway—When water is the only form of visible moisture on 25% or more of the runway 
surface area (whether in isolated areas or not).

2.6. Are all violations along the apron edges documented? 
(The required clearance from the apron boundary marking 
(double continuous 6-inch-wide yellow stripes with a 6-inch 
gap) to fixed or mobile obstacles is based on the most 
demanding aircraft that will use the apron. Compute this 
distance by multiplying 0.5 x the wingspan of the most 
demanding type of aircraft that will use the apron and add the 
appropriate wing tip clearance required by UFC 3-260-01, 
Table 6-1., item 5 or 6. Then subtract the distance from the 
taxilane centerline to the apron boundary marking to find the 
required clear distance. This distance is to be clear of all fixed 
and mobile obstacles except as specifically noted in UFC 3- 
260-01, Table 6-1. and Appendix B Section 13 for additional 
information.

6.1. Are wind cone fabrics in good condition? Note: Wind 
cone fabric must not be badly worn, rotted, faded, or soiled. 
 
 
 
6.2. Does the wind cone assembly swing freely at 360 
degrees? If the wind is not sufficient, swing the cone down to 
the servicing position and manually check for freedom of 
movement. 
 
 
 
6.3. Are wind cones illuminated? If so, are lights operable? 
 
 
 
6.4. Is the wind cone free of obscuring vegetation? 
 
 
 
6.5. Are wind cones sited in accordance with UFC 3-535-01?

7.1. Are all obstructions identified and documented? Note: 
Contact the Community Planner and TERPS for assistance in 
making this determination. 
 
 
 
7.2. Are all obstructions allowed (permissible deviations) or 
waived? Are they properly marked and lighted? 
 
 
 
Section 8. Arresting Systems. REFERENCE: AFMAN 32-1040, DAFMAN 32-1084, 
UFC 3-260-01, FC 3-260-18F or applicable ICAO, NATO or STANAG standards. 
8.1. Are unidirectional systems and nets located no closer than 
35 feet from the threshold of the runway? Note: Runway 
threshold markings begin 20 feet inboard of the full-strength 
pavement; therefore, do not install a unidirectional system 
within 55 feet of the threshold markings.) 
 
 
 
8.2. Are energy absorbers (except BAK-13 and ship anchor 
chains) located below grade or at least 275 feet from the 
centerline of the runway pavement? BAK-13 installations may 
be as close as 150 feet from runway edge if installed in a 
semipermanent configuration. BAK-12 systems require 290 
meters (950 feet), or 366 meters (1,200 feet) plus the length of 
the aircraft for unobstructed run out (See Flight Information 
Publication to determine local configuration). BAK-13 systems 
require 290 meters (950 feet) plus the length of the aircraft for 
unobstructed run out. Note: Runout from one system must not 
conflict with the cross-runway location of another system.) 
 
 
 
8.3. Are paved transitions and buried crushed stone ramps 
provided around the arresting system components located on 
the runway shoulders? Is the area over the fairlead tube 
finished to a grade of 1V: 30H or flatter? See AFMAN 32- 
1040 for additional information. 
 
 
 
8.4. Do the shelters used for above-grade systems comply with 
the requirements in AFMAN 32-1040 and UFC 3-260-01, 
Appendix B Section 13? 
 
 
 
8.5. Is the minimum effective pendant height greater than 1.5 
inches? If the effective pendant height is 1.75 inches or less 
has a repair action been initiated? If the effective pendent 
height is less than 1.5 inches, has an emergency repair been 
initiated? 
 
 
 
8.6. Do aircraft arresting systems meet location and siting 
requirements? 
 
 
 
 
 
DAFMAN13-204V2   20 SEPTEMBER 2024 
87 
8.7. Do arresting system cables have proper tension, doughnut 
spacing, and tie-downs? Are there any broken tie-downs? 
 
 
 
8.8. Is the pavements type the same in the critical area (the 
center 75 feet of pavement within 200 feet on either side of the 
cable)? Exception: This does not apply to installation of 
sacrificial polyethylene panels or to emergency systems located 
within the overrun. 
 
 
 
8.9. Is the pavement within 200 feet either side of the cable 
free of excessive paint build up that could cause a tail hook 
skip? 
 
 
 
Section 9. Other Hazards. REFERENCE: DAFI 91-202, DAFI 91-212, DAFI 31-101 or 
applicable ICAO, NATO or STANAG standards. 
9.1. Are all Bird/Wildlife hazards and habitat control identified 
and management control measures in place? 
 
 
 
9.2. Is the airfield a controlled area (security, fencing, and 
barricades) to prevent unauthorized access?

NOTES 
When allowable outages are exceeded, take the following actions: 
 
1. Document discrepancy accordingly and issue the appropriate NOTAM(s).  
 
2. Notify Airfield Lighting 
 
3. Turn-off affected lighting system.  Notify the AFM, AOF/CC, OSS/CC, and OG/CC (or equivalents) as 
necessary. 
 
a. The Installation Commander (Senior Airfield Authority if different than the Installation Commander at 
Joint Base locations) is the waiver authority for leaving the airfield lighting system on for a period not to 
exceed 24 hours. The respective MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for periods greater than 24 hours.  
NOTE 1:  Wavier authority may not be delegated.   
NOTE 2:  Waiver only extends to those flying units which fall under the MAJCOM/A3’s 
authority.  
NOTE 3: Civil aircraft operations are prohibited; flying units which do not fall under the 
purview of the Installation Commander and/or MAJCOM/A3 are prohibited; other DoD 
components are prohibited unless approved by their respective waiver authority. 
 
b. MAJCOMS are: ACC, AETC, AFDW, AFGSC, AFMC, AFRC, AFSOC, AFSPC, AMC, DIA, NGB, 
PACAF, and USAFE. Commander Air Force forces (COMAFFORs) in the grade of O-8 or higher in 
Combatant Commands (CCMDs) are considered MAJCOM commanders only for forces under their 
operational control to support the launch/recovery of aircraft assigned to their respective MAJCOM.  Civil 
aircraft operations are prohibited; other DoD components are prohibited unless approved by their 
respective waiver authority. 
 
4. Notify TERPs to determine impact to instrument procedures, send NOTAMs accordingly. 
 
5. NOTAMs pertaining to unlit obstructions/obstacles must contain specific attributes outlined in Federal 
Aviation Administration Order (FAAO) JO 7930.2, 5-2-3. OBSTACLES, Items 5- 10.
