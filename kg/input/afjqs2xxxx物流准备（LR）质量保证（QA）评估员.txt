1. PURPOSE. As directed by DAFI 20-112, Logistics Readiness Quality Assurance 
Program, this Air Force Job Qualification Standard identifies the minimum training 
requirements to become a qualified LR QA evaluator (both military and civilian).  This Air 
Force Job Qualification Standard will be available in Training Business Area (TBA) and 
must be used to develop the Master Training Plan (MTP) for the LR QA Section and the 
Individual Training Plans (ITP) for evaluators.  Specific applicability of this Air Force Job 
Qualification Standard to ANG personnel is addressed in DAFI 20-112.  This Air Force Job 
Qualification Standard will remain in effect until superseded or rescinded. 
 
2. TASK QUALIFICATION. Personnel will be qualified to the GO/NO GO standard on this 
Air Force Job Qualification Standard. GO means the individual can perform the task without 
assistance utilizing appropriate instructions or other procedural guidance.  If the required 
training listed under Part II, Task #1 is provided through web-based courses or trainers outside 
of TBA, a LR QA trainer will complete the trainer’s block to document training completion. 
Task 1.4 is meant to be tailored training on the USAF Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) 
instructed by the local Manpower Office.  This is not required to be full facilitator training but 
rather the basics of eight (8) step problem solving to include root cause analysis (4th step). 
 
3. EVALUATOR PROFICIENCY EVALUATIONS (EPEs).  After the LOG 143 course (Task 
1.1) is completed and on-the-job training on tasks 3.1 through 3.5 are accomplished, LR QA 
Evaluators must pass three EPEs (Task 3.6) conducted by a fully qualified QA evaluator within 
120 days of appointment (first EPE accomplished within 40 days).  If fully qualified QA 
evaluators do not reside within the LR activity, the QA Manager will work with the local the 
Maintenance Group QA section for assistance with the necessary training and evaluations.  
Each QA evaluator must pass the EPEs prior to performing unsupervised evaluations and 
inspections.  At a minimum, a qualified evaluator must ensure that the inspector can execute the 
proper steps to conduct an evaluation.

4. TRAINING DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINER/CERTIFIER IDENTIFICATION. 
Document training required by this Air Force Job Qualification Standard in accordance with 
DAFI 36-2670, Total Force Development and the TBA procedural guide available in the TBA 
application.  For civilians, document civilian training on Supervisor’s Employee Brief. All 
trainers and certifiers authorized to sign off tasks in Part II of this Air Force Job Qualification 
Standard will be identified in TBA. Per DAFI 36-2670, paragraph 4.6.2.2.2., core tasks in this 
particular Air Force Job Qualification Standard are defined as those tasks requiring third 
party certification.  If a military trainee is assigned an additional duty or task not included in 
an individual’s CFETP or this Air Force Job Qualification Standard, the supervisor will add 
the tasks to the MTP and ITP.  Specific CFETP tasks that an evaluator is authorized to 
evaluate will be identified in the evaluator’s ITP.  Specific QA training tasks for each Air 
Force Specialty Code (AFSC) may be added to the applicable CFETP by the individual 
Career Field Manager (CFM). 
 
5. This Air Force Job Qualification Standard has been coordinated with all applicable CFMs.  
Overall POC for this Air Force Job Qualification Standard is HAF/A4LR, DSN 693-5021,
