Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1.  Overview.  ICAM is the solution to build trust by aligning all participants to an agreed-upon 
set of policies, technical standards and best practices.  DoD chief information officer (CIO) 
manages ICAM programs with combatant commanders, services,  and agencies that the DAF 
supports and implements.  While identity management, credential management, and access 
management are closely interrelated, it is important to understand each individual ICAM facet.  
Identity management, access management, and credential management are supported and enabled 
by a foundation of governance and federation accepting the ICAM information from other entities 
across organizational boundaries.  Governance is what enables organizations to implement and 
manage effective ICAM policies and capabilities.  Federation is how organizations are able to 
accept ICAM information from other organizations, (e.g., services, agencies, mission partners) 
thereby enabling interoperability, because no one organization can operate in a bubble, as 
illustrated in Figure 1.1 from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ICAM 101 Briefing 
for Public Safety Officials. 
1.1.1.  Identity management allows an organization to construct a trusted digital identity based 
on an individual’s defining attributes.  It establishes identity using trusted evidence, creates an 
identity account, provisions the account with required attributes, updates identity account over 
the life cycle, and de-provisions and deletes identities. 
1.1.2.  Credential management allows an organization to associate a digital identity with 
authoritative proof of the claimed identity.  The life cycle establishes a sponsor need, registers 
subscribers in identity databases, issues and maintains credentials, and revokes those 
credentials, adding them to revocation lists. 
1.1.3.  Access management allows an organization to leverage trusted identities (person and 
non-person entities) and authoritative credentials to ensure only permitted individuals are 
granted access to protected resources. This is the set of practices and services for ensuring only 
those with proper permissions can interact with a given resource.  Access control policies at 
all levels govern access requirements.  Authentication verifies a claimed identity is genuine 
based on valid credentials.  Authorization is the decision to grant or deny access to a resource 
based on policy.

Figure 1.1.  Definition of Identity, Credential and Access Management. 
1.2.  Objective.  The objective of this publication is to explain how Airmen at all levels employ 
technologies and techniques to comply with DoD and AF ICAM policy when accessing Air Force 
information systems (ISs) in accordance with all relevant cybersecurity and data policies 
(SAF/CN). 
1.3.  Applicability.  This publication applies to all DAF information technology (IT) and devices 
used to process, store, display, transmit and protect DAF information and the authorized users of 
these resources. 
1.3.1.  DAF IT includes but is not limited to ISs (major applications and enclaves), platform 
information technology (PIT) and PIT systems, IT services (internal and external), standalone 
systems, and IT products (software, hardware, and applications), unless specifically exempted. 
Specific use cases exempted from public key infrastructure (PKI) and two-factor authentication 
are listed in the DoD CIO Memorandum, Interim Digital Authentication Guidelines for 
Unclassified and Secret Classified DoD Networks and Information Systems, and are authorized 
to use DoD approved usernames and passwords. These use cases include: 1) stand-alone 
networks and systems and kiosks;  2) closed restricted networks; 3) platform information 
technology (PIT); 4) lab and testing environments;  5) emergency, backup, and local logon 
accounts; and 6) tactical, deployed, or low bandwidth environments. 
1.3.2.  Compliance is mandatory for all military, mission partners, civilian, and contract 
employees who develop, acquire, deliver, use, operate, or manage DAF IT. 
1.3.3.  The DAF relies on two-factor authentication (2FA), a digital identity bound to a 
credential used for authentication to a relying party (RP).  Relying parties are system 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
7 
application owners that support one or multiple credentials, including PKI certificates, security 
assertion markup language, and other claims-based identifiers. 
1.3.4.  The DAF follows defined sensitivity levels to determine appropriate authentication 
methods, in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special 
Publication (SP) 800-63, Digital Identity Series, and DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8520.03, Identity 
Authentication for Information Systems. 
1.3.5.  More restrictive federal, DoD, or DAF guidance take precedence over this publication, 
(e.g., DoDI 8520.02, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Public Key (PK) Enabling, and 
DoDI 8520.03). 
1.3.6.  This publication and implementation guidance identified within is not applicable to 
special access programs or intelligence community (IC) ISs, to include sensitive 
compartmented information (SCI) ISs. Refer to the IC Directive (ICD) 503, Intelligence 
Community Information Technology Systems Security Risk Management, Certification and 
Accreditation, and AFI 16-701, Management, Administration and Oversight of Special Access 
Programs.

Chapter 3 
IDENTITY MANAGEMENT 
3.1.  Introduction.  Identity management is the combination of technical systems, policies, and 
processes to create, define, govern, and synchronize the ownership, utilization, and safeguarding 
of digital identities. The primary goal of identity management is to establish a trustworthy process 
of assigning attributes to a digital identity and to connect that identity to a person or NPE in 
accordance with NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines and DoD policies. 
3.1.1.  Identity Assurance Level (IAL) refers to the identity proofing process (see paragraph 
3.3). 
3.1.2.  Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) refers to the authentication process that 
addresses how an individual can securely authenticate to a CSP to access a digital service or 
set of digital services. 
3.1.3.  Federation Assurance Level refers to the strength of an assertion in a federated 
environment used to communicate authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to 
an RP. 
3.2.  Identity.  Identity is the set of attributes defining an individual within a given context or 
environment.  The identity associated with an individual or an NPE is used in establishing trust 
and gaining access to physical or logical cyber resources. 
3.2.1.  Types of Identities. 
3.2.1.1.  With regard to PEs, identities are verified via DMDC.  When the subscriber builds 
an identity from a trusted process, the identity meets IAL2.  When the subscriber 
accomplishes the face-to-face requirement, the identity meets IAL3, in accordance with 
NIST SP 800-63-3. 
3.2.1.2.  NPE identities are proofed by a system administrator through a documented local 
process approved by the ISO.  When the identity is built via automated method, the identity 
meets IAL 2.  When the administrator is actively involved in building the identity, the 
identity meets IAL 3, in accordance with NIST SP 800-63-3 and DoD  X.509 Certificate 
Policy. 
3.2.2.  The primary CSP for a DAF-affiliated person is the DMDC.  The DoD CAC, for those 
eligible, serves as the authoritative assertion of identity and is used as proof of DoD or DAF 
affiliation, in accordance with DoDI 1000.25, DoD Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) 
Program, and NIST SP 800-63-3. (T-0). Ineligible CAC individuals (e.g., retirees, dependents)  
affiliated with DoD or DAF will use the DMDC as the primary CSP. (T-0). 
3.2.2.1.  Mission partners, temporary employees, volunteers, and FNs that do not have the 
DMDC as a primary CSP will use an External Certification Authority (ECA) program to 
issue PKI credentials to prove their identity on the network, in accordance with DoDI 
8520.02 and Methods and Procedures Technical Order (MPTO) 00-33A-1300 (T-0). 
3.2.2.2.  For a list of all attributes, see MPTO 00-33D-2001, AFNET Enterprise Naming 
Conventions. 
16 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
3.2.2.3.  Systems shall adhere to DoD CIO memorandum, Interim Digital Authentication 
Guidelines for Unclassified and Secret-level DoD Networks and Information Systems, for 
specific use cases and exceptions. (T-0). Any system or organization that is unable to use 
DMDC or other DoD approved CSP shall contact ACC HQ CCC/CYX ICAM 
(acc.cyss.cyz.pki@us.af.mil) or AF PKI SPO (AFPKI.Helpdesk@us.af.mil) for further 
guidance. (T-3). 
3.2.3.  DoD personnel in Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)/Real-
time Automated Personnel Identification System RAPIDS) are bound to credentials (e.g., 
CACs, ALTs at IAL3 and AAL3) in accordance with AFI 36-3026V1, Identification Cards for 
Members of the Uniformed Services, Their Eligible Family Members, and Other Eligible 
Personnel, and AFI 36-3026V2, Common Access Card (CAC). All other populations and 
credentials shall target IAL3 and AAL3. (T-3). IAL1 and IAL2 and AAL1 and AAL2 bound 
credentials are allowed on a case-by-case basis. All non-DoD credentials and binding process 
requests must be coordinated with ACC HQ CCC ICAM and/or AF PKI SPO. (T-3). 
3.3.  Identity Proofing.  Identity proofing is the process of an identity being initially established. 
This includes both the assigning and documenting of unique attributes, and in the cybersecurity 
context, establishing an electronic identity or account bound to the subscriber’s and NPE-unique 
attributes, in accordance with AFI 36-3026V1 and AFI 36-3026V2 for DoD connected personnel 
and NIST SP 800-63-3.  Non-unique attributes may also be assigned or gathered at this time but 
are not part of the identity proofing.  The responsibility for assigning and documenting unique 
attributes may vary by subscriber or NPE type, but the correct binding of the identity attributes to 
the account is the ultimate responsibility of the ISO.  The ISO must ensure that procedures are 
established and followed to correctly bind attributes to accounts, in accordance with NIST SP 800-
63A, Digital Identity Guidelines, Enrollment and Identity Proofing Requirements. (T-0). 
3.4.  Attributes.  An attribute is any distinctive feature, characteristic, or property of an object that 
can be identified or isolated quantitatively or qualitatively by either human or automated means. 
AFDS provides authoritative identity and attribute management for DAF person entities through 
an end-to-end life-cycle process that includes generation, provision, maintenance, and termination 
of individual digital identity records. 
3.4.1.  Attributes are unique identifiers for individuals (e.g., Electronic Data Interchange 
Personal Identifier (EDIPI), Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (FASCN), email 
address, biometrics). Attributes for NPEs (e.g., UID, email address) are provided by its service 
provider. 
3.4.2.  Non-unique identifiers or attributes assigned, gathered, and managed can be used to 
further support authorization and access control decisions (e.g., Air Force Specialty Code, 
Office, base).

Chapter 4 
CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT 
4.1.  Introduction.  Credential management is the set of practices that an organization uses to 
issue, track, update, and revoke credentials for identities. A Personal Identity Verification (PIV) 
credential contains a picture, the issuing agency logo, and cryptographic key pairs used for 
authentication. Authentication to DAF ISs is performed through a DoD-approved method within 
DoD and in accordance with NIST standards. 
4.1.1.  Identity information must be used to ensure strong identification and authentication and 
eliminate anonymity. (T-0). DAF ISs will use only DoD-approved and DAF identity 
credentials to authenticate entities requesting access to or within DAF information 
environments. (T-0). All information in electronic format will be given an appropriate level of 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability reflecting the importance of information sharing and 
protection. (T-0). 
4.1.2.  DAF ISs connect to the DoD Information Network (DoDIN) subnetworks (e.g., 
NIPRNET, SIPRNET) in accordance with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 
(CJCSI) 6211.02D, Defense Information System Network (DISN) Responsibilities. (T-0). 
4.1.3.  An IS subscriber is an individual who has access to standalone systems, specialized or 
functional ISs, enterprise ISs, and/or mission systems. 
4.2.  Credentialing.  All network, system, or application accounts that use DoD-issued or 
approved PKI, multifactor authentication credentials, or Identity Federation Services (IFS) will be 
implemented as required by DoD policy. (T-0). DoD-issued medium-hardware assurance PKI 
credentials meet the criteria for IAL-3/AAL-3, in accordance with NIST SP 800-63-3.  Other 
credentials will be validated against NIST SP 800-63-3. (T-0). 
4.2.1.  Strength.  The strength of a credential is the measure of its ability to resist unauthorized 
use. The required strength a credential must have varies according to the classification of the 
system to be accessed (unclassified or classified), in accordance with NIST SP 800-63-3 and 
DoDI 8520.03. (T-0). 
4.2.2.  Assurance Levels specify the strength of the binding between the public key and the 
individual whose subject name is cited in the certificate, the mechanisms used to control the 
use of the private key, and the security provided by the PKI itself. 
4.2.2.1.  DoD PKI certificates are at the medium assurance level, as defined by NIST SP 
800-63. (T-0). This is a portable certificate and can be used on any computer with the
required utilities and drivers installed.
4.2.2.2.  Hardware-based certificates are stored on a Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Level 2 or higher cryptographic device (e.g. smart token, universal 
serial bus (USB) device). (T-0). 
4.2.3.  Composition.  Credentials contain one or more attributes, often in the form of PKI 
certificates, that when aggregated, represent the identity of a person or an NPE. (T-0). 
4.2.4.  Authenticators/Tokens. 
18 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
4.2.4.1.  PKI hardware tokens use asymmetric cryptography to identify and authenticate 
subscribers to systems and networks for the NIPRNET and SIPRNET. 
4.2.4.2.  An issued token remains the property of the U.S. Government, in accordance with 
AFI 36-3026V1. (T-0). All NIPRNET Tokens shall be returned to the Alternate TA, and 
SIPRNET tokens shall be returned to an LRA for accountability. CACs are returned to a 
RAPIDS location. (T-0). 
4.2.4.3.  Expired, unneeded, or found tokens shall be turned in to the nearest RAPIDS 
facility by the individual, Contracting Officer Representative (COR) for DoD contractors, 
or Trusted Associate Sponsorship System (TASS) Trusted Agent (TA). (T-0). 
4.3.  Credential Life Cycle. 
4.3.1.  Credential creation. User credentials will be created by the authorized issuing agency 
(e.g., DEERS, AF RA) based on specific use cases and access needs. (T-0). The credential 
binds the logical identity with a physical identity through use of registration. Depending on the 
IAL/AAL level, registration might require face-to-face verification of the individual’s identity 
using a government issued identification, such as the CAC, where a user presents this 
information to the VO at the DEERS/RAPIDS workstation. Finally, the credential is issued to 
the user. 
4.3.2.  Credential maintenance. Credential maintenance is required for the duration of the 
credential, until it is terminated. (T-0). Maintenance of the credential may include reissuance, 
updates to identity information, or replacement due to compromise. 
4.3.3.  Credential termination. Credential termination means revoking the credential so that it 
is no longer used for expressing the logical identity of the user.  Termination may be the result 
of the credential being lost, potential compromise, changes of employment status, or no longer 
a need by the individual. 
4.4.  Types of Tokens.  Various types of tokens are used for specific purposes to authenticate on 
the AFIN.  A hardware token is a portable, user-controlled, physical device used to generate, store, 
and protect cryptographic information.  They are used to perform encryption and provide 2FA 
access NIPRNET and SIPRNET, in accordance with DoDI 8520.02.  The CAC is the primary 
hardware token for authenticating individuals for access to NIPRNET assets and physical access 
to DoD facilities, in accordance with DoDI 8520.02, Department of Defense Manual (DoDM) 
1000.13V1, DoD Identification (ID) Cards: ID Card Life-Cycle, and AFI 31-101, Integrated 
Defense (ID). 
4.4.1.  Hardware Based PKI.  Tokens must meet FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for 
Cryptographic Modules, Level 2.(T-0). Compliance with the FIPS standards include anti-
tamper detection, evaluation to Protection Profile at Evaluated Assurance Level 2 or greater, 
and a secure distribution capability, in accordance with NIST SP 800-63B, Digital Identity 
Guidelines, Authentication and Lifecycle Management. (T-0). 
4.4.1.1.  The CAC, which meets FIPS 140-2 level 3, provides a cryptographic, certificate-
based login identity for NIPRNET that is valid until its expiration. 
4.4.1.2.  The SIPRNET hardware token, which meets FIPS 140-2 level 2, provides the 
trusted subscriber identification, authentication, and non-repudiation on SIPRNET, 
providing improved interoperability across the DoD through PKE applications. 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
19 
4.4.2.  Software-based PKI certificates must be FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliant. (T-0). The DoD 
PKI provides the ability for issuance of a software-based certificate.  Protection of this PKI 
certificate must be in an approved crypto module. (T-0). Software-based PKI certificates are: 
4.4.2.1.  Used by both Person and Non-Person Entities. (T-0). 
4.4.2.2.  For authentication, digital signature, and encryption. 
4.4.2.3.  Used by mobile devices when a hardware-based PKI is not feasible. 
4.4.3.  Other multifactor tokens may include one-time passwords, time-based one-time 
passwords, biometrics, behavioral analytics, fast identity online or “FIDO” claims, or other 
technical factors.  Approval of other multifactor tokens follow the process outlined in the DoD 
CIO memorandum, Interim Digital Authentication Guidelines for Unclassified and Secret 
Classified DoD Networks and Information Systems. 
4.5.  CAC token management.  DAF ISs and subscribers shall only rely on certificates issued by 
a DoD or AF PKI (e.g., LTMA, Internal Basic Assurance (IBA)) that are approved for use. (T-3). 
Relying parties will authenticate approved external PKI certificates using either a direct trust 
mechanism or using a cross-certification mechanism. (T-3). All external PKI certificates presented 
from an approved external PKI must be validated via either download of the PKI certificate 
revocation list associated with the external PKI or use of an online certificate status protocol 
(OCSP) query. (T-3). The DoD maintains a repository for posting CA certificates and policy object 
identifiers for approved external PKIs, in accordance with DoDI 8520.02. (T-3). 
4.5.1.  DAF must use TASS for requesting CACs for DoD PKI certificate eligible users. (T-
0). 
4.5.2.  TASS allows the following personnel to apply for a CAC or other government 
credential:  affiliated volunteers (requiring DoD Network access), DoD and uniformed service 
contractors, foreign affiliates, non-DoD civil service employees, non-Federal agency civilian 
associates, non-US non-appropriated fund employees, outside the Continental US hires, and 
other Federal agency contractors. 
4.5.3.  Government sponsors approve the applications for government credentials. 
4.5.3.1.  Government sponsors of DoD contractor personnel will contact their supporting 
TASS TA to request an application for an eligible contractor. (T-3). 
4.5.3.2.  The locally appointed TASS TA (e.g., organizational security manager) verifies 
contractor access against Visit Authorization Requests in the Joint Personnel Adjudication 
System, ensuring there is a valid contract in the TASS before approving the request for a 
CAC. 
4.5.4.  Unfunded contract options annotated in the contract as the period of performance are 
considered in the determination of the length of contract, (e.g., a contractor hired under DoD 
contract with a base year plus two option years shall be issued a CAC with a 3-year expiration). 
(T-3). The expiration date of the PKI certificates on the CAC shall match the expiration date 
on the card. (T-3). 
4.5.4.1.  DoD Contractors contact their unit TASS TA prior to making an appointment with 
their supporting Military Personnel Section to have their information entered or updated in 
DEERS. 
20 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
4.5.4.2.  If contract option years are not exercised, the COR notifies the TASS TA to revoke 
contractor access. 
4.5.5.  DoD PKI certificate eligible users include authorized DoD volunteers, state, local, or 
tribal government employees, or interns, as defined in DoDI 8520.02. 
4.5.6.  The TASS application replaced the Contractor Verification System (CVS) and was 
designed to replace the paper application process using DD Form 1172-2, Application for 
Identification Card/DEERS Enrollment, in accordance with DoDM 1000.13 and the Trusted 
Associate Sponsorship System (TASS) Overview Guide 
4.6.  SIPRNET token management  . DoD issues SIPRNET Tokens to uniformed services 
personnel, to include DAF, ANG, AFR. All recipients must be approved by the Office of the 
Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. (T-0). 
4.6.1.  SIPRNET account users are required to use SIPRNET tokens in accordance with 
Maintenance Tasking Order (MTO) 2018-283-001, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for 
Privileged User Accounts. 
4.6.2.  SIPRNET tokens are issued by designated LRA personnel. 
4.6.3.  SIPRNET tokens must be handled in accordance with CNSS-015-2016, National 
Security Systems Public Key Infrastructure Member Governing Body and SAF/CN Memo, 
Secure Internet Protocol Routed Network (SIPRNET) Token Guidance. (T-0). 
4.6.4.  Positive control includes maintaining visual contact when in use and retention or 
secured on the person when not in use. Only the assigned subscriber is authorized to use the 
SIPRNET token. (T-3). 
4.6.4.1.  Do not leave the SIPRNET token unattended in computer network resources. 
4.6.4.2.  Turn in expired, found, or no longer required SIPRNET tokens to the nearest LRA, 
or COR for DoD Contractors. Do not return the found SIPRNET token back to the 
individual. 
4.6.4.3.  If the SIPRNET token is lost or stolen, immediately report this information to the 
LRA to initiate the revocation process, in accordance with NSS PKI DoD RPS. (T-0). 
4.6.4.4.  Contact the supporting LRA to revoke SIPRNET token certificates when 
suspected loss of positive control or unauthorized use of the token or a certificate. (T-3). 
4.6.4.5.  Return any token determined to be temporarily out of the positive control of the 
assigned subscriber to the LRA. 
4.6.4.6.  Issuance of a new SIPRNET token is authorized after a dated and signed 
memorandum (wet or digital signature acceptable) on organizational letterhead by the 
requester’s commander authorizing the issuance is provided to the LRA. (T-3). 
4.6.4.7.  When out-processing for a permanent change of station (PCS), SIPRNET tokens 
must be returned to the LRA. (T-3). 
4.6.4.7.1.  Applies to all personnel with the exception of General Officers (GOs) and 
Senior Executive Service (SES) personnel. 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
21 
4.6.4.7.2.  GOs and SES personnel who PCS with tokens should notify the losing base 
LRA.  The losing base LRA then: 
4.6.4.7.2.1.  Changes the site code for the SIPRNET token in TMS. 
4.6.4.7.2.2.  Notifies the gaining base LRA of the transfer through a digitally signed 
email. 
4.6.4.7.3.  Base communications unit updates their section of the base out-processing 
checklist to ensure that all individuals have contacted their unit’s CSS to terminate their 
SIPRNET account and have turned in their SIPRNET token to the base LRA prior to 
signing off the individual’s Base Out-processing Checklist. (T-3). 
4.6.4.7.3.1.  Upon receipt, LRAs shall reformat the token and store it with other 
issuance card stock to be reissued. (T-3). 
4.6.4.7.3.2.  Contractors contact their unit’s CSS to terminate their SIPRNET 
account and turn in their SIPRNET tokens to the base LRA at the end of the contract 
period of performance. (T-3). 
4.6.4.8.  Any subscriber can retain his or her SIPRNET token during a move, while they 
reside on the same station or base. SIPRNET tokens are required to be turned in when 
leaving a station or base. 
4.6.4.9.  Exception or exemption validated circumstances, where a SIPRNET token cannot 
be used, refer to SIPRNET smart card logon below. 
4.7.  Virtual Smart Card (VSC). 
4.7.1.  VSC is a multi-factor technology that emulates the functionality of traditional X.509-
based smart cards. Smart card-based PIV cards cannot be readily used with most mobile 
devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets); however, VSCs use derived PIV Credentials (DPCs), 
which can be used instead to PIV-enable these devices and provide multifactor authentication 
for mobile device subscribers. 
4.7.2.  DPCs are only used on FIPS 140-2, level 2, trusted platform module 1.2 and greater. 
4.7.2.1.  A DPC is issued for which the corresponding private key is stored in a 
cryptographic module that is an alternative form factor to the PIV Card. (T-3).

Chapter 5 
ACCESS MANAGEMENT 
5.1.  Introduction.  Access management covers subscribers’ authentication and authorization to a 
relying party, providing verification and ensuring non-repudiation.  DAF authentication will align 
and comply with the Deputy Secretary of Defense DoD Cybersecurity Discipline Implementation 
Plan, DoD cybersecurity policies and privilege management initiatives, in accordance with DoDI 
8520.03 and NIST SP 800-63B. (T-0). 
5.1.1.  Subscriber. Subscribers are entities defined by their affiliation within the DoD. 
Common affiliations include: Uniformed Service Members, DoD Civilians, Contractor 
Employees, Foreign Nationals (FNs), NPEs, and Organizational Roles. 
5.1.1.1.  Entities (e.g., role, person, equipment) must possess an attribute to be bonded and 
allowed to be identified, verified, and authenticated for access. (T-0). System or device 
subscribers will use system or device authenticators containing a unique system or device 
identifier as the subject and are responsible for maintaining and managing access to the 
activation key, code, or token associated with the authenticator. (T-0). 
5.1.1.2.  Credential Responsibilities. Identities are critical to securing network traffic. 
Tokens are used to store credentials by definition. The subscriber must possess and control 
assigned tokens at all times. (T-0). 
5.1.1.2.1.  Once the token is activated and in-use, it must not be left unattended at any 
time. (T-0). All active tokens must be secured when not in use. (T-0). 
5.1.1.2.2.  After use, the token must be deactivated with a manual logoff in accordance 
with DoD X.509 Certificate Policy v10.6, Section 6.2.9. (T-0). 
5.1.2.  Relying Party (RP). An entity that relies upon the subscriber’s authenticator(s) and 
credentials, or a verifier’s assertion of a claimant’s identity, typically to process a transaction 
or grant access to information or a system. Examples of an RP include websites or applications 
where a subscriber must be authenticated using digital certificates before granting access. (T-
0). This includes the AF Portal where the AF Portal is the RP the subscriber is requesting 
access using the authentication certificate to validate his or her digital identity. In the case of 
network logon, the Domain Controller is the RP. 
5.1.2.1.  Devices can be both an RP and a subscriber when in a device-to-device 
communication session. 
5.1.2.2.  Applications like Outlook™ or Adobe™ also act as an RP when validating digital 
signatures of emails and forms to verify the digital certificate is valid in accordance with 
X.509 Certificate Policy. (T-0).
5.1.3.  Authentication is the process used to confirm a claimed identity, through the use of a 
valid credential during identity proofing in accordance with DoDI 8520.03, for unclassified 
systems. All DAF relying parties are required to authenticate using certificates by approved 
credentials in accordance with NIST SP 800-63-3 and DoDI 8500.01. (T-0). 
5.1.4.  Authorization is the enforcement of access policies to ensure that the correct individuals 
and entities are granted access to only the resources and information that they require and for 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
25 
which they possess the requisite permissions (or attributes). Authorization is often done 
directly through compliance with local policy governing the resource or indirectly through a 
separate authorization service, which is sometimes termed a “policy decision point.” Typically, 
decisions involve some type of lookup of the requester’s identity attribute data or use of local 
access control lists. Decisions may depend upon an individual’s role (e.g., system 
administrator, database administrator) or the permissions and attributes associated with a 
specific group.  Access to DAF ISs is a revocable privilege and is granted to individuals based 
on need to know and in accordance with CJCSI 6211.02D, CJCSI 6510.01F, Information 
Assurance (IA) and Support to Computer Network Defense (CND) and National Security 
Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Policy (NSTISSP) No. 200, National 
Policy on Controlled Access Protection. 
5.2.  Authentication.  The authentication of subscribers and the granting of logical and physical 
access is a combination of enterprise-wide and local functions (e.g., DEERS, global directory 
services, or DoD PKI services) in real-time whenever possible in accordance with DoDI 1000.25, 
DoD 5200.08-R, Physical Security Program, DoDI 5200.08, Security of DoD Installations and 
Resources and the DoD Physical Security Review Board (PSRB), DoDI 5200.46, DoD 
Investigative and Adjudicative Guidance for Issuing the Common Access Card (CAC), DoDI 
8500.01, and DoDI 8520.03. (T-3).  
5.2.1.  Factors. Authentication Factors fall within three categories, knowledge, possession, and 
inherence.  Multiple categories combined form the basis of a multi-factor authentication 
process. This process is to ensure a stronger, more secure method of authenticating an identity. 
5.2.1.1.  Knowledge is something known (e.g., username/password, PIN). 
5.2.1.2.  Possession is something physical a PE has (e.g., smart token). 
5.2.1.3.  Inherence is a biological trait an entity has (e.g., fingerprint). 
5.2.1.4.  Biometrics. A biometric identifier (e.g., a fingerprint, an iris scan, or a hand 
geometry template) registered in a DoD-approved authoritative source that is used as an 
enabler (e.g., as one factor of an approved multi-factor identity authentication process) 
enhances strength of the identity credentials. For additional information and management 
processes refer to DoD Directive (DoDD) 8521.01E, DoD Biometrics, DoDI 8520.03 and 
AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program unless otherwise specified by 
Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency. 
5.2.2.  Process. 
5.2.2.1.  PE Authentication. For person authentication, all subscribers will have an AAL-2 
or AAL-3 authenticator in accordance with NIST SP 800-63-3. (T-3). 
5.2.2.2.  NPE Authentication.  Authentication of NPEs is accomplished by securely-
installed DoD-approved PKI digital certificates whenever possible. Alternate certificates 
types must be approved by CISO. (T-0). 
5.3.  IS Access.  Requests for access to resources located on the AFIN are vetted through identity 
and authentication steps prior to receiving an authorization decision. Follow guidance in 
paragraph 4.2 to obtain a token prior to being granted access. (T-3). 
5.3.1.  Authorized access to DAF resources. 
26 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
5.3.1.1.  CAC eligible subscriber. Individuals eligible for CACs are identified in 
accordance with DoDM 1000.13. Individuals will be issued a separate CAC for each 
persona (e.g., DoD uniformed and civilian personnel and eligible contractors; DoD 
volunteers or interns; selected reserve personnel; executive department and agency 
personnel; ANG members; state or local or tribal government employees; foreign 
government and foreign organization personnel, and foreign contractors) in accordance 
with DoDI 8520.02, AFMAN 17-1303, Cybersecurity Workforce Improvement Program, 
DoDI 8520.03, CJCSI 6510.01F, and DoD 8570.01-M, IA Workforce Improvement 
Program. (T-0). 
5.3.1.1.1.  Dual-role personnel have more than one role or persona (e.g., civilian and 
reservist, contractor and ANG); the individual is required to have and use the 
appropriate CAC for each role. 
5.3.1.1.2.  System and application owners must make a decision if the information the 
individual is accessing is restricted by the persona expressed in the certificate. (T-3). 
Some applications must ensure that the correct persona is used to authenticate 
personnel with dual persona roles (e.g., Reservist persona for military related actions, 
or Contractor persona for contract related actions) (T-3). 
5.3.1.2.  Applications can use information in the credential provided (Federal Agency 
Personal Identifier in the User Principal Name of the PIV cert) or the application can 
establish an information exchange with a DoD approved identity provider. 
5.3.2.  Temporary and volunteer access. 
5.3.2.1.  Grant only unclassified IS access to temporary employees and volunteer personnel 
in support of their assigned duties in accordance with AFI 36-3026V2. 
5.3.2.2.  Individuals (including key spouses) authorized to be DoD temporary and/or 
volunteer must meet access requirements in accordance with AFI 36-3026V2. (T-3). 
5.3.3.  Mission Partners, (e.g., Five Eyes, allies, coalition partners) the ISO shall establish 
procedures for assigning or determining the unique attribute to use and for securely binding 
the attribute to the account. (T-3).  This attribute must be included on an authorized PKI 
credential or an authorized token in accordance with DoDI 8520.02, and MPTO 00-33A-1300, 
SIPRNET Releasable (SIPR REL) Enclave Implementation Core Service. (T-0).  
5.3.4.  Non-DoD individuals and organizations that support or are supported by DoD missions 
and operations. Mission partners include allies, coalition partners, host nations, international 
and multinational organizations, civilian government agencies and departments (Federal, State, 
local, and tribal), law enforcement agencies, non-governmental agencies and organizations 
(private volunteer organizations, commercial businesses, academic institutions, etc.), and other 
non-adversaries in accordance with DoDI 8520.02. 
5.3.5.  Foreign National (FN)/Local National (LN). 
5.3.5.1.  WCOs consult the Host or MAJCOM foreign disclosure officer and applicable 
ISSM before authorizing access by FN or LN subscribers to ISs processing, storing, or 
transmitting classified and controlled unclassified information (CUI), in accordance with 
AFMAN 17-1301, MPTO 00-33A-1301, Foreign National NIPRNET Access Core Service, 
MPTO 00-33A-1202, Air Force Network Account Management, MPTO 00-33D-2001, AFI

Unclassified Technical Data from Public Disclosure, DoDD 5230.11, Disclosure of
Classified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations,
and DoDD 5230.20, Visits and Assignments of Foreign Nationals. (T-0).
5.3.5.2.  Pursuant to applicable host-nation agreements, FN or LN privileged subscribers 
are certified to access the baseline computing environment. If privileged access is required 
to an IS, restrict FN or LN subscriber access to Information Assurance Technical I/II level 
positions and only under the immediate supervision of a United States (US) citizen. (T-3). 
Furthermore, document access in the IS security assessment package in accordance with 
AFMAN 17-1301. 
5.3.5.3.  Sanitize or configure classified ISs to restrict access by FNs or LNs to only 
classified information authorized for disclosure to the FNs or LNs government or coalition, 
as necessary to fulfill the terms of their assignments in accordance with applicable host 
MAJCOM foreign disclosure officer requirements. 
5.3.5.4.  FNs or LNs requiring system access must use PKI access methods in accordance 
with DoDI 8520.03 and CJCSI 6510.01F. (T-0). The application and data the FN or LN is 
accessing must be approved for release to the country of the FN/LN. (T-0). If a system 
cannot accept a PKI certificate, follow guidance for other approved two-factor 
authentication capabilities for establishing the identity of the FN and/or LN. 
5.3.5.5.  Non-US citizens, who are permanent legal residents, are required to meet the same 
requirements of any US citizen for access to the unclassified network or system. (T-0). 
5.4.  Authorization. 
5.4.1.  Authorized User. An authorized user is any appropriately cleared individual required to 
access a DoD IS to carry out or assist in a lawful and authorized governmental function. The 
DCSA Position Designation Tool may be used to determine the position sensitivity and 
corresponding investigative requirement in accordance with DoDI 1400.25V731, DoD 
Civilian Personnel Management System:  Suitability and Fitness Adjudication For Civilian 
Employees. Configure authorized user account creation and administration, consult Executive 
Order (EO) 13488, Granting Reciprocity on Excepted Service and Federal Contractor 
Employee Fitness and Reinvestigating Individuals in Positions of Public Trust, for 
investigation requirements. (T-0). 
5.4.2.  Non-Privileged. Also known as subscribers requiring basic access to unclassified and 
classified IS based on the assigned duties.  Non-privileged subscribers authenticate with an 
authenticator that meets the proper AAL/IAL combo, depending on the information being 
accessed. 
5.4.3.  Privileged. Authorized (and, therefore, trusted) to perform functions on an unclassified 
and classified IS based on the assigned duties and the Automated Information System position-
certified, in accordance with DoDM 5200.02_AFMAN16-1405, Air Force Personnel Security 
Program, DoD 8570.01-M, and AFMAN 17-1303.  Privileged subscribers are required to 
authenticate with a hardware-based PKI credential or via IFS method (see paragraph 4.2). (T-
3).  Privileged subscribers are separated into a tier system, in accordance with DoDD 5205.16, 
The DoD Insider Threat Program. 
28 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
5.4.3.1.  Tier 1 is the lowest level of privileged access and network rights. Includes 
subscribers who service and maintain single endpoint devices; cannot access or modify 
networks; can install software; can modify network settings; and enable or disable services 
on individual computers.  Tier 1 privileged subscribers include local-system administrators 
and client support team members. 
5.4.3.2.  Tier 2 includes subscribers who can access more than the local system but have 
restrictions and are generally responsible for upgrading, installing, or repairing systems. 
Tier 2 privileged subscribers include most AFNET administrators who have an 
administrator account and subscribers who have the responsibility to secure information 
systems. 
5.4.3.3.  Tier 3 includes individuals who have access rights across most areas of the 
infrastructure. Members of this group often have full administrative control of domains 
within the enterprise. Tier 3 privileged subscribers include domain administrators, 
enterprise administrators, and network administrators. 
5.4.4.  Required Documentation.  The DAF is moving toward an automated account 
provisioning process.  The process uses attributes managed by the enterprise attribute manager, 
and authorization is enforced through the service provider.  It remains the service provider’s 
or relying party’s responsibility for which attributes ensure proper authorization occurs. 
5.4.4.1.  When required by the ISO for IS access, in accordance with Title 10 United States 
Code Section 9013, AFI 33-332, and EO 9397, Numbering System for Federal Accounts 
Relating to Individual Persons, users of all authorized DAF information system devices (to 
include mobile computing devices) the CSS or ISSO will ensure: 
5.4.4.1.1.  Users sign the standardized AF Form 4394, Air Force User Agreement 
Statement-Notice and Consent Provision, prior to initial access. (T-3). 
5.4.4.1.2.  Users complete Cyber Awareness Challenge training prior to being granted 
access to an IS. (T-0).  Subscribers must re-accomplish Cyber Awareness Challenge 
training annually; organizations maintain compliance in accordance with DoD 
8570.01-M. (T-0). 
5.4.4.1.3.  Failure to complete annual Cyber Awareness Challenge training results in 
immediate suspension of access to unclassified and classified information systems. (T-
0).   Access can be restored upon satisfying the annual retraining requirement, in 
accordance with DoD 8570.01-M. (T-0). 
5.4.4.1.4.  If an individual violates the information system terms of use, commanders 
should consider suspending access pending re-accomplishment of Cyber Awareness 
Challenge training.  Violations identified by the AFNET Mission Assurance Center 
result in automatic account suspension.  Additional restrictions on reinstatements for 
classified information systems are determined locally and should follow the guidelines 
of DoD 8570.01-M. 
5.4.4.2.  DD Form 2875, System Authorization Access Request (SAAR), is completed and 
digitally signed by the user. The Government sponsor verifies the justification and need for 
access and digitally signs the form before routing to the Security Manager. The Security 
Manager performs a security clearance and background investigation verification and 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
29 
digitally signs the form before routing for account creation, in accordance with DoDM 
5200.02_AFMAN 16-1405 and AFMAN17-1301. 
5.4.4.2.1.  Original DD Forms 2875 for unprivileged AFNET accounts may be 
transferred when duty assignments change. The gaining unit may use local methods to 
update duty information in the Information Assurance Officer (IAO) Express tool and 
shared drive access requirements.  The losing unit ensures termination of shared drive 
access prior to user’s out-processing. (T-3). 
5.4.4.2.2.  Changes to privileged account access requirements require a new account 
access request. (T-3). 
5.4.4.2.2.1.  Re-accomplish the account request for AFNET-Secured Internet 
Protocol Network (SIPRNET) (AFNET-S) accounts when access requirements 
change (e.g., duty position, permanent change of station). (T-3). 
5.5.  Account Management. 
5.5.1.  Manage all subscriber accounts using applicable system configuration management 
guidance; follow Technical Orders (TOs) published by DAF (e.g., MPTO 00-33B-5006, 
MPTO 00-33A-1202 for AFNET accounts) and the applicable DoD Security Technical 
Implementation Guides (STIGs) (e.g., enclave, application security, operating system, 
database). (T-3). 
5.5.2.  Account Provisioning. Logically moving a new subscriber account from the placeholder 
Organizational Unit (OU) to the requested Base OU in the AFNET.  Enables the new account, 
and if the CSS requests, provides the account email. 
5.5.2.1.  Contact the Unit CSS to provision the new account. 
5.5.2.2.  CSS provisions account via IAO Express Tier Zero. 
5.5.3.  Password management. 
5.5.3.1.  Specific procedural information for password management is provided in DoD 
STIGs and PIN management requirements in accordance with DoD PKI RA/LRA CPS. 
5.5.3.2.  USCYBERCOM tasking order password requirements take precedence only if 
more restrictive than guidance in this publication. 
5.5.3.3.  Unauthorized sharing of passwords/PINs is a security incident, in accordance with 
CJCSI 6510.01F. 
5.5.3.4.  In the event of a compromised password/PIN, the ISO and the ISSM ensure 
procedures are in place to implement immediate password/PIN change activities. (T-3).  A 
compromised PKI PIN warrants probable compromise of the associated certificates. 
5.5.4.  Pin management. All NIPRNET and SIPRNET DoD ISs and Directory Service domains 
and domain-joined computers, per local security policy, are required to be configured for PIN 
caching, set to 10 minutes. (T-3). 
5.5.5.  Loss of Access.  Access to a DAF IS is a privilege, and continued access is contingent 
on personnel actions, changes in need to know, or operational necessity, in accordance with 
CJCSI 6510.01F. 
30 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
5.5.5.1.  Actions that threaten or damage DAF ISs can result in immediate suspension of 
access to unclassified and classified ISs. 
5.5.5.2.  If an individual’s clearance is suspended, denied, or revoked, immediately 
suspend access to classified information systems. (T-3).  Commanders review 
circumstances surrounding the suspension, denial, or revocation to determine if continued 
access to unclassified systems is warranted and if revocation of the hardware token is 
required.  Commanders may provide recommendations regarding user access to the ISO. 
5.5.6.  Subscriber account. Also known as user accounts, require basic access to unclassified 
and classified ISs based on the assigned duties.  A subscriber account is established for a single 
named individual based on his or her identity and access needs.  AFNET accounts are created 
through an automated method by AFDS based on information obtained by DMDC.  
Applications generate the accounts in an automated method when possible. (T-3). 
5.5.7.  Group Account. A special case account where more than one person can simultaneously 
access the same account using a DoD-approved PKI credential, in accordance with DoDI 
8520.02. Tier-1 ALT (NIPRNET) and VIP ALT (SIPRNET) are for Flag Officers or SES 
personnel only. The AO is the approving authority for group accounts, in accordance with 
CJCSI 6510.01F and DoDI 8520.02. The AO approval letter must be part of the system or 
enclave authorization package. (T-3). Approval authority for group accounts is identified in

5.5.7.1.  Executive staff support personnel use ALTs to log on to the executive’s network 
account to perform system testing, workstation configuration, read and answer routine 
email on behalf of the executive. 
5.5.7.2.  ALTs have unique identifiers that do not allow the staff support personnel to 
digitally impersonate the Executive. 
5.5.7.3.  Request a group account via email to ACC HQ CCC/CYZ ICAM at 
acc.cyss.cyz.pki@us.af.mil. 
5.5.8.  Role Account. A role account is used in control center or similar positions, assigned to 
the particular position, not to an individual, to fulfil the mission requirements. The mission 
continues, without interruption, during personnel changes (e.g., shift changes, swap-outs). A 
role account is issued to an individual authorized to fill a specific organizational role or 
function and does not contain the individual’s name.  Role certificates are the credentials which 
role account users use to authenticate. 
5.5.8.1.  One individual accesses the account at a time.  Identity control and monitoring is 
maintained by the individual in charge through assignment of individuals and tracked with 
a log.  The mission continues, without interruption, during personnel changes (e.g., shift 
changes, swap-outs). 
5.5.8.2.  Each person would access the organizational email mailbox for any email 
requirement (e.g., Air Operation Center stations, Command Center stations, information 
displays and Remotely Piloted Aircraft positions). 
5.5.8.3.  Request a role account via email to ACC HQ CCC/CYZ ICAM at 
acc.cyss.cyz.pki@us.af.mil.

5.5.9.  Administrative Account. An information system account which is used by a privileged 
subscriber to install and maintain an information system, providing effective information 
system utilization, adequate security parameters, and sound implementation of established 
cybersecurity policy and procedures.  AFNET accounts must always designate an 
administrative account using “.ad+Level Code” at the end of the account name in accordance 
with MPTO 00-33D-2001. (T-0). 
5.5.10.  Service Account. A service account is used in a system-to-system or application-to-
system process to provide “ownership” of a process or system service. Any account without 
interactive login that is for device-to-device; system-to-system; system-to-device; or system-
to application authentication is considered a service account. Service account passwords must 
be changed at a minimum every 60 days per AD STIG. (T-0). 
5.5.10.1.  All AFNET Enterprise Service/Application Accounts will follow MPTO 00-
33D-2001; all other Service/Application Accounts will have their own naming convention 
or follow MPTO 00-33D-2001. (T-3). 
5.5.10.2.  A service account belongs to the operating system or application instead of an 
administrator or end user (individual). Such an account is forbidden to be used for 
interactive login. (T-3).  All connectivity to other systems or applications should be 
blocked. (T-3). 
5.5.10.3.  Passwords shall be created that will restrict human interaction. (T-3). All external 
connectivity not defined in the service account approval must be logically blocked. (T-3). 
Each service account must be identified in the Enclave/System Assessment and 
Authorization  package. (T-3). Interactive logon is prohibited for any Directory Services 
Service Account; the use of smart tokens for logon is not possible. (T-3). 
5.5.10.4.  Service accounts are not just applicable to the Windows™ Server environment, 
but are also used in UNIX/Linux™, Mac OS™, CISCO™, IBM™, and others. Other 
related terms are “system account”, “system process owner”, “computer/machine account”, 
and “application account”. Each account is created to provide services which include, 
Active Directory™ Connector or Microsoft™ SQL Server Express; other Windows™ 
Services on Windows™ Servers; Oracle Database™ services; UNIX system™ services: 
UNIX Spooler account, process scheduler; etc. Service accounts can be a non-domain 
joined system to or from a domain joined system.

the change management process with Remedy change requests. 
5.5.11.  Organizational electronic mailbox. Disable DS objects that are associated with 
organizational mailboxes.  Note: Organizational mailboxes and organizational accounts are 
two different capabilities and are not related. 
5.5.11.1.  The organizational mailbox manager grants access from the actual organizational 
mailbox.  The organizational mailbox manager is the person whose name appears in DS as 
the manager.  Use IAO Express to add or change the organizational mailbox manager in 
DS/Exchange. 
5.5.11.2.  The sponsor appointed for the organizational mailbox manages the associated 
encryption certificate.  The sponsor is the person who requests, issues, and manages the

https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/usaf-pki/ReferenceDocs/  browse for CI-09-03-
002_Role-Based_Certificate_Request_Procedures_v1.3.0.pdf and open it; once the 
Standard Operating Procedure is open, go to Appendix A for the appointment letter 
template. The AF RA or LRA, as appropriate, will maintain a file of requirement validation 
documentation. (T-3). For organizational email mailboxes on PEDs, follow the appropriate 
DoD STIG. For additional guidance, consult the DoD PKI Registration Authority/Local 
Registration Authority Certification Practice Statement (RA/LRA CPS) which can be 
found under the Resources/Policy tab of the AF PKI System Program Office website at 
(https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/usaf-
pki/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/AF%20Public%20Key%20Infrastructure%2
0System%20Program%20Office.aspx). 
5.5.12.  System/Enclave ISSM is responsible for requesting the removal of any stale or not 
required accounts in accordance with CJCSI 6510.01F. (T-3). 
5.6.  Account Life Cycle.  The full life cycle of identity and access for a subscriber on a given 
system. 
5.6.1.  Creation. For subscriber accounts, AFDS enables discovery of new identities from 
DMDC, DAF Human resource systems and other authoritative sources. The identity may be 
augmented with data from additional authoritative sources and an account created in a 
subscriber management system. AFDS establishes new account upon CAC issue via a data 
driven process initiated by DMDC.  Group, Executive Support Staff, Role, Admin Service and 
Organizational mailbox accounts follow the established procedures and document 
requirements in the previous sections. These accounts are only activated once all documents 
are completed and signed by the user, sponsor and supervisor and sent to ACC HQ CCC/CYX 
ICAM for processing. 
5.6.2.  Maintenance. Unique attributes within a local context generally do not change over 
time, with minor exceptions such as name changes for both PEs and NPEs.  For PEs, non-
unique attributes may change occasionally or even frequently, (e.g., office symbols, phone 
numbers, rank, positions).  ISOs shall establish procedures for maintaining and updating any 
locally gathered or assigned attributes and also designates acceptable sources such as AFDS 
for externally managed PE attributes. (T-3).  AFDS obtains updated information from 
authoritative data sources and replicates that data to the AFNET for subscriber accounts.  If an 
individual identifies errors in the data, a help desk ticket is generated for resolution.  All other 
accounts require a help desk ticket for account maintenance. 
5.6.3.  Termination. For subscriber accounts, AFDS detects removal of identities from DMDC 
and initiates the decommissioning process of the digital identity of a PE.  This initiation may 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
33 
cascade to account removal in subscriber management systems.  Sponsors of all other account 
types should request account termination when the account is no longer required. 
5.7.  Access Control.  Access control is the resulting convergence of identity management, 
credential management, authentication, and authorization.  Access control represents enforcement 
of the authorization decision and is often referred to as the policy enforcement point.  Methods and 
mechanisms are used to restrict physical and logical access based on verified identity, valid 
credentials, and policies governing the accessibility of a given resource. Attributes required for 
access to a resource must be allocated to subscribers as part of the identity account provisioning 
process based on a policy of least privilege as well as need-to-know. (T-3). 
5.7.1.  Physical Access. DoD IS, DoD networks or DoD facilities shall authenticate all entities 
prior to granting access. (T-0). DAF installations and facilities shall utilize a DoD PIV 
credential (e.g., CAC) for personal identification and authentication to Physical Access Control 
Systems (PACS) in accordance with NIST SP 800-116, A Recommendation for the Use of PIV 
Credentials in Physical Access Control Systems (PACS). (T-0). 
5.7.1.1.  The identifier is the Cardholder Unique Identifier. 
5.7.1.2.  Any new DAF PACS procurements require the use of the DoD CAC (Contactless 
or Chip+PIN) exclusively in accordance with DTM 09-012, Interim Policy Guidance for 
DoD Physical Access Control. (T-0). 
5.7.2.  Logical Access. Access to an IT network, system, service, or application.  DoD IS or 
DoD networks hosting information not previously approved for public release shall 
authenticate all entities prior to granting access in accordance with DoDD 5230.09, Clearance 
of DoD Information for Public Release and DoDI 5230.29, Security and Policy Review of DoD 
Information for Public Release. (T-0). 
5.7.2.1.  For network authentication, enable all unclassified networks to use tokens, (AAL-
2 or AAL-3), DoD PKI certificate-based authentication, and set authorized subscriber 
accounts to require smart card logon by selecting, “Smart card is required for Interactive 
Logon,” in Windows™ AD environments. 
5.7.2.2.  Primary identifier for logical access shall be the EDIPI which can be represented 
in various ways such as the user principal name in the PIV certificate for active directory 
smart token logon or the distinguished name for authentication to non-windows systems. 
(T-3).  Other identifiers shall not be used without approval by the SAF/CN CTO or 
SAF/CNZ CISO in cases where the aforementioned methods are technically infeasible 
except for Systems specifically exempted from PKI and two-factor authentication, see 
paragraph 1.3.1. (T-3). 
5.7.3.  Role-Based Access Control or Attribute Based Access Control. Either are acceptable as 
long as the attributes come from an authorized source (e.g., AFDS, AFNET AD). 
5.7.3.1.  Method used within DoDIN for administering an Access Control List. It provides 
an authorization mechanism that links rights and privileges with subscriber roles, which 
correspond to job functions within the enterprise. 
5.7.3.1.1.  Roles are defined based on job functions, instead of individual member 
accounts and groups. 
34 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
5.7.3.1.2.  Permissions are defined based on job authority and responsibilities within a 
job function. 
5.7.3.1.3.  Operations on an object are invocated based on the permissions. 
5.7.3.1.4.  Object is concerned with the subscriber’s role and not the subscriber. 
5.7.3.2.  Targets different levels of a system or application to provide any degree of access 
control that is necessary. 
5.7.4.  Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). 
5.7.4.1.  Logical access control methodology where authorization is determined by 
evaluating attributes associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some 
cases, environmental conditions against policy, rules, or relationships that describe the 
allowable operations in accordance with NIST SP 800-162, Guide to Attribute Based 
Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations. 
5.7.4.2.  Enterprise ABAC allows applications and devices within the DoD to support 
current and emerging identity and access management requirements in a standards-based 
manner in accordance with NIST SP 800-162. 
5.7.4.3.  Enterprise ABAC allows organizations to meet the requirements of NIST SP 800-
63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines, while simultaneously providing the capability to grant
and deny access to resources based on current access policy, resource and subscriber
security attributes, and threat conditions in accordance with NIST SP 800-162.
5.8.  Accountability.  Components used for tracing (e.g., event monitoring, auditing, logging and 
reporting) an entities (PE/NPE) actions on a system, back to the unique entity will ensure non-
repudiation. (T-3). These components, while not an ICAM-specific capability, enable 
accountability across ICAM.

Chapter 6 
CERTIFICATE MANAGEMENT 
6.1.  Introduction  . The AF ensures its internal PKI CAs and the digital certificates they issue are 
trustworthy using the trust governance method.  It also ensures external roots and associated 
certificates can be trusted by AF relying parties.  The process of trusting a PKI involves the 
acceptance of its root (also known as a Trust Anchor) certificate and placing it in a trust store.  The 
enterprise certificate trust governance process exists to manage the baseline and provide a formal 
means to add and remove roots at the enterprise level.  AF ISs and subscribers shall only rely on 
certificates issued by a DoD and/or AF PKI that are approved for use. (T-3). Relying parties 
authenticate approved external PKI certificates using either a direct trust mechanism or cross-
certification mechanism. All external PKI certificates presented from an approved external PKI 
must be validated via either download of the PKI certificate revocation list associated with the 
external PKI or use of an on-line certificate status protocol query. (T-3). The DoD maintains a 
repository for posting CA certificates and policy object identifiers for approved external PKIs. 
6.2.  Identity credential strength determination  .  The ISO will determine the “Credential 
Strength” used to authenticate to the DoD IS by assessing the “Sensitivity Level” of the 
information contained in the DoD IS in accordance with DoDI 8500.01 and DoDI 8520.03. (T-0). 
6.3.  Type of certificates. 
6.3.1.  NPE.  Provide the capability to set up secure communications between relying parties 
and devices, prevent the connection of unauthorized devices to the Department's networks, and 
secure existing connections between network devices. 
6.3.1.1.  All private AF Web servers must be issued a DoD X.509 PKI Server certificate. 
(T-3).  6.3.1.2 A server certificate must be reissued when the fully qualified domain name 
for the server changes or after three years. (T-3). 
6.3.2.  DoD. These certificates are required for external facing AF server and domains and are 
issued by the AF RA. 
6.3.3.  DAF. These certificates are allowed for internal facing AF server (e.g., web servers, 
domain name servers), issued by the AF LTMA Sub-CA on NIPRNET. 
6.3.4.  Mobile code signing certificate. Code signing and mobile code certificates are specially 
formatted certificates used for digitally signing executable program code in any number of 
languages or formats. The code signing certificate binds the identity attributes of the owning 
organization and the hash of the executable code to the credential to provide assurance that the 
code has not been altered during distribution. 
6.3.4.1.  Code signing attribute authority (CSAA) is authorized to appoint individuals to 
receive and use code-signing certificates. 
6.3.4.2.  For the AF Developer’s Guide for Obtaining DoD Code Signing Certificates and 
additional guidance, go to the AF PKI website https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/usaf-
pki/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/Mobile%20Code%20and%20Code%20Signin
g%20Certificates.aspx. 
36 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
6.3.4.3.  The CSAA ensures that code-signing designations are kept to a minimum 
consistent with operational requirements. 
6.3.4.4.  The ISSM annotates compliance in the enclave or system authorization package. 
The code signing and/or mobile code certificates are approved for use by the AF AO. 
6.4.  Online certificate status protocol (OCSP).  Primary method used in the DoD to validate 
certificate revocation statuses.  The DoD’s Robust Certificate Validation Service provides this 
capability on both NIPRNET and SIPRNET enclaves. https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/usaf-
pki/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/Certificate%20Validation.aspx. 
6.5.  Certificate reissuance prior to expiration.  Certificate sponsors (owners) needing 
continued PKI services can request reissue of their certificates no earlier than 60 days prior to the 
certificate expiration date in order to prevent disruption in service, and to alleviate not having to 
process a certificate revocation. Reissuance is not allowed prior to 60 days before expiration 
without the current certificate being revoked first. (T-3). Reissue a server certificate when the fully 
qualified domain name for the server changes or after three years. 
6.6.  Certificate Revocation. 
6.6.1.  Certificate revocation is necessary to terminate a certificate’s use before its normal 
expiration date. Examples of reasons for revocations include private key compromise (e.g., 
lost or stolen token), loss of trust in a subscriber, changes in a subscriber’s legal name, or 
departure from the DoD.  Examples of reasons for NPE device certificate revocation are (e.g., 
changes to IP, loss of private key, compromise or, for Domain Controllers, a rebuild of the 
device). 
6.6.2.  The request must be submitted in a digitally signed email to the AF RA/\LRA/TA. (T-
3). 
6.6.2.1.  Revoke certificates suspected of key compromise within 24 hours or the next duty 
day (whichever is first) after notification. (T-3). 
6.6.2.2.  Enter the revoked certificates into a DoD CRL.  All applications (e.g., web sites) 
must check validity (e.g., the trust path, expiration, and revocation status) before granting 
access. (T-3). 
6.6.2.3.  CAs are responsible for indicating the revocation status of the certificates they 
issue. (T-3). Revocation status information is provided using the OCSP, CRLs, or some 
other mechanism in accordance with Internet X.509 PKI Certificate and CRL Profile,

6.8.3.  ISSMs ensure all devices are configured with an approved token reader or have AF AO-
approval to use software certificates in accordance with the DoD Commercial Mobile Device 
(CMD) Policy STIG. (T-0).
6.8.4.  Derived Credentials. 
6.8.4.1.  A Derived PIV Credential is an additional X.509 certificate, issued in accordance 
with the requirements specified in the NIST SP 800-157, Guidelines for Derived Personal 
Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials and DoD Interim Guidance on the Use of DoD 
Personal Identity Verification Derived PKI Credentials on Unclassified Commercial 
Mobile Devices. When the PIV authentication certificate on an applicant’s PIV Card, it 
serves as an additional common identity credential under Homeland Security Presidential 
Directive (HSPD) 12: Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees 
and Contractors and FIPS 201-2, and is used with mobile devices. 
6.8.4.2.  The PIV cardholder may request a derived PIV credential. 
6.8.4.3.  Derived credentials cannot be stored on workstations. (T-3). They must be deleted 
after issuance to the subscriber. (T-3). 
6.8.4.4.  In the event of device loss, theft or compromise, subscriber shall follow all current 
incident/loss processes and inform their LRA or TA to revoke all the derived credentials. 
(T-3). 
6.8.4.5.  Purebred. A key management interface for DoD PKI to distribute device and 
derived subscriber credentials over the air to CMD.  More information can be found at 
https://iase.disa.mil/pki-pke/Pages/purebred.aspx. 
6.8.4.5.1.  Securely issues approved CMD DoD PKI device certificates and allows 
DoD PKI subscribers to request and receive subscriber credentials onto their CMDs. 
6.8.4.5.2.  Purebred Agent. Purebred Agent performs the necessary steps to establish 
cryptographic keys that can be used to authenticate the device and encrypt 
configuration data for use by the device. 
6.8.5.  CMD. PKI credential storage and use on classified CMDs is not authorized. 
6.8.5.1.  The DoD Mobile Policy STIG prohibits the use of personally owned or contractor 
owned CMDs to access DoD information or connect to DoD networks. 
6.8.5.2.  Device management is governed by local organizations to meet mission 
requirements. 
6.8.5.3.  The use of software certificates on CMDs must be approved by the applicable AO 
and documented in the system Assessment and Authorization package in accordance with 
the DISA Mobile Policy Security Requirements Guide (SRG). (T-0). 
6.8.5.4.  For CMDs that are certified in accordance with the National Information 
Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Protection Profile Mobile Device Fundamentals V3.1, 
derived credentials are permitted to be stored in the CMD’s native keystore.  Consult the 
NIAP Product Compliant List at https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Product/ for a listing of

AIR FORCE DIRECTORY SERVICES 
7.1.  Air Force Directory Services (AFDS)  . Provides authoritative identity and attribute 
management for the DAF through an end-to-end life-cycle process that includes generation, 
provision, maintenance, and termination of individual digital identity records. AFDS harvests, 
standardizes, aggregates, and presents data attributes to organizations and customers through 
identity management products and services. AFDS serves as the DAF enterprise-level directory 
service and identity management attribute store. AFDS leverages multiple authoritative data 
sources to enable secure, accurate, and timely identity data attributes that reduce the need for 
redundant USAF directory services and security stores core capabilities. These core capabilities 
include: AF enterprise identity data directory (IDD), account provisioning and user self service, 
and Exchange contact information synchronization (ECIS). It also provides the Air Force Email 
for Career (E4C) capability in the form of "@us.af.mil" email addresses for all DAF subscribers. 
The program is the Authoritative Data Source for the E4C address and makes it available to other 
authoritative data sources, as requested. 
7.1.1.  Enterprise IDD (unclassified or classified):  Retrieves data from multiple, disparate 
USAF and DoD data sources to create a single consolidated digital identity record. 
7.1.1.1.  Provides a common repository known as authoritative attribute store of role-based 
identity data for warfighters that can be used by systems, applications, and devices. This 
simplifies the management of core identity data elements about warfighters within 
individual systems by giving systems access to near real-time data about their subscribers. 
This capability is designed to be used in strategic and tactical environments. 
7.1.1.2.  No other identity attribute source (local store) will be established in the DAF 
without coordinating with ACC HQ CCC/CYX ICAM, AFLCMC, and SAF/CN. (T-3). 
7.1.2.  Account provisioning and user self service (unclassified or classified):  Provides 
administrators and warfighters an automated business process to manage accounts across 
multiple systems based on authoritative identity records. 
7.1.2.1.  A single interface is provided to the warfighter to allow automated management 
of subscribers profiles associated with directory and non-directory enabled applications, 
including the creation, vetting, modification, updating, and disabling or deletion of 
accounts process triggered by changes in authoritative data source records. 
7.1.2.2.  User-Self Service capability gives warfighters the ability to verify or update 
personal attributes, request publication to the Global Address List publication, and select 
alternate delivery points for E4C email traffic.  User Self Service is found at:  
https://imp.afds.af.mil/default.aspx. 
7.1.2.3.  DAF users may use AFDS User Self Service to update and/or verify personal 
attributes. 
7.1.3.  ECIS. Conduct daily synchronization of email Global Address Lists daily for NIPRNET 
and SIPRNET environments.  This service includes a broader Lightweight Directory Access 
Protocol directory capability containing over 3.4 million contacts DoD-wide. 
40 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
7.1.3.1.  Supports geographically disparate exchange sites and is a key enabler for email 
communications for the warfighter. 
7.1.3.2.  Conducts daily synchronization of several million contacts across DoD, 
MAJCOMs, CCMDs, and DRUs. 
7.1.3.3.  DAF 
organizations 
will 
use 
AFDS 
Exchange 
Contact 
Information 
Synchronization service to populate all Global Address Lists. (T-3). 
7.1.4.  Requirements Process.  ACC HQ CCC/CYX ICAM serves as Lead Command Support 
and Requirement Lead (RL) for AFDS program. Primary duties include capturing, evaluating, 
validating, and prioritizing customer requirements.  To receive any of the identity management 
services offered by AFDS, review the AFDS requirements process and workflow at the AFDS 
Requirements website. 
7.1.4.1.  To help the customer shape the requirement for submission, visit AFDS Safe 
Download website https://epi.afds.af.mil/Onboarding webpage and review/download 
the pertinent documents. 
7.1.4.2.  AFDS Service Catalog. Describes the different services offered by AFDS. 
7.1.4.3.  Identity Management (IdM) Form 3215, Requirements Document. Requirement 
request form. 
7.1.4.4.  IdM 3215 Form Instructions. Helps requester properly fill out IdM 3215 Form. 
7.1.4.5.  AFDS External Data Dictionary. Describes data elements available in the AFDS 
IDD repository. 
7.1.5.  AFDS Interface Developers Guide.  Gives a high-level explanation of the process of 
connecting to the virtual directory and sending a query.  Provides necessary background 
information to incorporate the information provided in the virtual directory into an application.  
Gives a developer the necessary background information to connect to the AFDS web service 
and incorporate the information returned from the web service into an application. 
7.1.6.  ACC HQ CCC/CYX ICAM, AFDS requirements lead (RL). Receives properly 
completed requirements form from customer and determines if requirement is in scope and 
within current Lead Command direction.  If not in scope but in AFDS area of expertise, or has 
DAF Enterprise level impact, AFDS seeks approval from ACC A6I, AFDS Lead Command, 
to accept and work the requirement.  If RL requires external coordination on a requirement 
(Air Force Network Integration Center, 561/83 Network Operations Support Center, ANG 299 
Network Operations Security Squadron), RL notifies the requester that coordination is needed 
prior to AFDS Requirements Review Board acceptance. 
7.2.  Operational Use of Identity Attributes.  When performing actions that require the 
gathering, usage, or presentation of digital identity data, the system will use the associated 
attributes from the AFDS digital identity store. (T-3). Systems that require disconnected operations 
or other forms of limited connectivity situations may maintain a local copy of the associated 
attributes of the AFDS digital identity. These systems will not act as a secondary proxy or re-
deliver the AFDS identity data attributes to other systems. (T-3). First, the system must perform 
routine periodic updates of the identity record by pulling data from AFDS on a recurring basis of 
no less frequently that weekly. (T-3). Second, the system must use the real time data available 
from AFDS to the greatest extent possible, as dictated by mission needs. (T-3). DAF systems and 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
41 
organizations will use AFDS IDD (DAF attribute store) service to populate directories with DAF 
enterprise attributes. (T-3). 
7.2.1.  AFNET NIPRNET attribute binding. For NIPRNET subscriber accounts on AFNET, 
unique identity attribute binding for individual (non-administrative or non-group accounts) is 
the responsibility of AFDS on behalf of the AFNET. AFDS is responsible for obtaining the 
subscriber identity information directly from DMDC to ensure subscriber accounts are 
established with the subscriber’s matching identity attributes. The correct assignment of the 
identity attributes enables subscribers to use the PKI credentials on their CAC to authenticate 
to their network account. 
7.2.2.  Non-AFNET NIPRNET and SIPRNET attribute binding. These network accounts must 
be configured with a unique identifier for each subscriber. (T-0). SIPRNET accounts may use 
the EDIPI or FASCN with the addition of the Personnel Category Code as the unique identifier.  
Administrators of non-AFNET NIPRNET and SIPRNET accounts should use an automated 
tool, such as SIPRNET Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol, when possible to 
populate the account attributes directly from the CAC or SIPRNET token to avoid potential 
entry errors and unauthorized access.

AUDIT CHECKLIST 
9.1.  Auditing.  Auditing associate’s identity data with events for monitoring, saving activity to 
audit logs for automated and human review. This ensures that behaviors involving the access and 
utilization of resources comply with established guidance. It also provides for the capability to set 
thresholds for system alerts when activity falls outside accepted norms. Such activity can then be 
investigated to determine the nature of the behavior and apply the proper remediation. Monitoring 
data or their detected patterns can also be used to reconstruct activity profiles to facilitate 
performance and forensic investigations. The event data contained in audit logs, along with the 
logs themselves, must be protected from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion. (T-3). 
9.2.  Compliance Audits.  The purpose of a compliance audit is to verify that the audited party 
has in place a system to assure the quality of the services that it provides and that it complies with 
all the requirements of the Certificate Policy and its CPS. NIPRNET and SIPRNET RAs and LRAs 
will be audited annually. (T-3). 
9.2.1.  RAs/LRAs must attach a risk assessment to all audit submissions. (T-3). 
9.2.2.  All RAs and LRAs will be audited periodically in accordance with DoD RA/LRA CPS. 
(T-3). 
9.2.2.1.  RAs will audit the LRAs’ audit results and checklists annually. (T-3). 
9.2.2.2.  RAs will provide updates to the AF CISO every 6 months. (T-3). 
9.2.2.3.  DoD PKI PMO has the responsibility to audit the RAs. (T-3). 
9.2.3.  LRA self-assessment audit checklists are located on the AF PKI LRA Training website:  
https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/usaf-
pki/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/AF%20Public%20Key%20Infrastructure%20Sys
tem%20Program%20Office.aspx/html/lra_trg.cfm under the Help & Training/Local 
Registration Authority. 
9.2.3.1.  Items are arranged in four sections: General LRA responsibilities; physical 
controls; system administrator responsibilities and ISSO responsibilities. 
9.2.3.2.  A completed LRA self-assessment checklist signed by the LRA’s commander 
may serve as the LRAs annual or periodic audit requirement. 
9.2.4.  RAs/LRAs will maintain a file of requirement validation documentation for 
organizational account certificates, as appropriate. (T-3).

Terms 
Access—Ability to make use of any information system (IS) resource. (CNSSI 4009) 
Accountability—The principle that an individual is entrusted to safeguard and control equipment, 
keying material, and information and is answerable to proper authority for the loss or misuse of 
that equipment or information. The security goal that generates the requirement for actions of an 
entity to be traced uniquely to that entity. This supports non-repudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, 
intrusion detection and prevention, and after-action recovery and legal action. (CNSSI 4009) 
Accreditation—Formal declaration by an AO that an information system is approved to operate 
in a particular security mode at an acceptable level of risk, based on the implementation of an 
approved set of technical, managerial, and procedural safeguards. (CNSSI 4009) 
Alternate Logon Token (ALT)—A portable, user-controlled, physical device used to generate, 
store, and protect cryptographic information, and to perform cryptographic functions. (DoDI 
8520.02) 
Application—A software program hosted by an information system. (CNSSI 4009) 
Assurance—The grounds for confidence that the set of intended security controls in an 
information system are effective in their application. (CNSSI 4009) 
Asymmetric Cryptography—Also referred to as public-key cryptography, asymmetric 
cryptography incorporates two cryptographic keys to implement data security, a public key and a 
private key.  The public key is used for encryption and may be given to anyone, trusted or not. The 
private key is used for decryption and must be kept secret. (T-0). 
Audit—Independent review and examination of records and activities to assess the adequacy of 
system controls and ensure compliance with established policies and operational procedures. 
(CNSSI 4009) 
Audit Trail—A chronological record that reconstructs and examines the sequence of activities 
surrounding or leading to a specific operation, procedure, or event in a security relevant transaction 
from inception to final result. A record showing who has accessed an information technology (IT) 
system and what operations the user has performed during a given period. (CNSSI 4009) 
Authentication—Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to 
allowing access to resources in an information system. A security measure designed to protect a 
communications system against acceptance of fraudulent transmission or simulation by 
establishing the validity of a transmission, message, originator, or a means of verifying an 
individual's eligibility to receive specific categories of information (CNSSI 4009) 
Authorized User—User must: possess a valid U.S. security clearance commensurate with the 
classification level of system accessed, possess a mission need to know, and complete DoD IA 
training. (T-0). 
Authorizing Official (AO)—A senior (federal) official or executive with the authority to formally 
assume responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to 
organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational 
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. (CNSSI 4009) 
56 
DAFMAN17-1304  18 AUGUST 2021 
Availability—Timely, reliable access to data and information services for authorized users.  
(CNSSI 4009)
