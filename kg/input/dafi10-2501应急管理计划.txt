Chapter 1 
OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY 
1.1.  Purpose.  Establish cross-functional policy, standards, and actions to execute a systematic 
capabilities-based all-hazard/threat effects DAF EM Program. Primary policy objectives are to: 
1.1.1.  Specify and codify an interoperable DAF comprehensive EM planning framework and 
mission areas to protect personnel, key resources, facilities, infrastructure, and operational 
missions against all-hazard/threat effect categories of 1) natural, 2) technological, 3) human-
caused unintentional and 4) human-caused intentional terrorism and adversarial nation state 
attacks. 
1.1.2.  Set conditions to synchronize, integrate, and align related Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS), Joint and DAF doctrine; presidential directives; and DoD/DAF EM programs. 
1.1.2.1.  DELETED 
1.1.2.2.  DELETED 
1.1.3.  Support the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) operational imperatives to optimize 
information, generate resilient installations, and account for combat support maneuver aspects 
needed to protect forces from all-hazards/threat effects and continue mission operations. 
1.1.4.  Adopt the standardized language used throughout the national/international EM 
profession. Standardized language is that used to describe all-hazard/threat effects/impacts to 
enable holistic DAF EM Program risk management at all echelons. 
1.1.5.  Reinforce a continuous robust integrated risk management (IRM) policy to inform DAF 
EM programmatic capability investment strategies (by mission areas and common core 
capabilities) and increase the ability of senior DAF leaders to mitigate risk. 
1.1.6.  Facilitate internal installation cross-functional integration and external interoperability 
with local, state, federal, joint, and host nation (hereafter referred to as mission partners) as it 
relates to the National Incident Management System (NIMS) Type 3 or higher incidents 
requiring multi-agency and/or multijurisdictional interoperability. 
1.1.7.  The DAF EM program maintains DoD readiness and sustains mission assurance (MA) 
by established and maintaining a comprehensive, all-hazard EM program. Synchronize DAF 
EM Program activities in support of the DoD and DAF MA construct to address risk to DAF-
owned assets supporting strategic missions world-wide. 
1.2.  Situation.  Global all-hazard/threat effects to DAF personnel and operating locations (OL) 
will continue to create substantial risk to tactical, operational, and strategic DAF operational 
capabilities in support of Combatant Command (CCMD) missions. 
1.3.  Mission.  DAFPD 10-25 establishes primary and ancillary missions of the DAF EM Program. 
1.3.1.  Primary Mission. Prevent, protect, prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from 
all hazards/threats affecting DAF installations worldwide. 
1.3.2.  Ancillary Missions. Support homeland defense; provide support to civil and host nation 
authorities; antiterrorism (AT) programs; and the countering weapons of mass destruction 
(CWMD) enterprise. 
14 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
1.4.  Preparedness Goal.  The EM Program will build secure, trained, and resilient personnel and 
installations with integrated, interoperable, and adaptable common core capabilities. These 
capabilities will apply across the range of military operations to prevent, protect, prepare for, 
mitigate, respond to, and recover from physical hazard/threat effects that pose the greatest risk to 
lives, key resources, facilities, infrastructure, and operational missions. 
1.5.  Operational Environment Applicability.  The DAF EM Program structure and functioning 
will account for DAF warfighting operational contributions within the global operating model to 
1) defend the homeland; 2) strengthen alliances and partnerships with preparedness, response, and 
recovery efforts; and 3) support joint force blunt and surge operations. DAF EM Programs at all 
echelons will integrate common core capabilities to support crisis response, limited contingency 
operations, and major combat operations (MCO). 
1.6.  Program Policy and Guiding Principles. 
1.6.1.  Coordinates activities and operations that are scalable, flexible, adaptable, and 
consistent with Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-8, National Preparedness, Homeland 
Security Presidential Directive-5 (HSPD-5), Management of Domestic Incidents, to include 
the National Planning Framework/Mission Areas, the National Preparedness System, and the 
NIMS IAW DoDI 6055.17, DoD Emergency Management (EM) Program. 
1.6.2.  Provides a single integrated program across the DAF for installations, facilities, and 
activities and associated off-installation areas subject to DAF jurisdiction. 
1.6.3.  Does not replace existing, single-agency and/or single-hazard-set programs, plans, or 
capabilities, but rather integrates and synchronizes existing functional capabilities while 
coordinating the development of cross-functional common core capabilities for effective 
management of multi-agency and/or multi-jurisdictional emergencies regardless of cause. 
1.6.4.  Creates resilience through cross-functional capabilities that support the ability to adapt 
to changing conditions, withstand, and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies. 
1.6.5.  Propagates cross-functional interoperable information to and from mission partners 
along the DoD/DAF C2 continuum through the DAF Emergency Management Information 
System (EMIS) and associated IT and application platforms. 
1.6.6.  Maintains readiness and sustains MA by establishing and maintaining a comprehensive, 
all-hazards EM Program. 
1.6.7.  Prioritizes force survivability and mission continuation. 
1.6.8.  Aligns and adapts DAF EM Program structure and functioning with emergent DAF 
senior leader guidance and strategies regarding SecAF operational imperatives, effectiveness, 
and strategic focus areas. 
1.6.8.1.  Implements the Basing and Logistics Enterprise Strategy (BLES) for integrated 
Air Base (AB) C2 systems/information, integrated base defense (IBD), and integrated base 
response and recovery (IBRR) to address pacing challenges posed by nation state adversary 
threats. 
1.6.8.2.  Contributes to DAF organizational design for installation headquarters (HQ) to 
prepare for crisis before it occurs to prepare C2 combat forces for deployment. 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023

1.7.  Assumptions.  The following greatest hazard/threat effect assumptions will guide strategic, 
operational, and tactical DAF EM Program concepts; tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP); 
OT&E/exercise requirements; and shape overarching deliberate to adaptive planning and risk 
management activities. 
1.7.1.  Strategic. The functions of the DAF, as specified in DoD Directive (DoDD) 5100.01, 
Functions of the Department of Defense and Its Major Components, (e.g., global strike, 
precision attack, global mobility, space operations, C2, agile combat support [ACS], etc.) are 
interdependent and mutually susceptible to degrading all-hazard/threat effects. Authoritative 
and advanced DAF EM Program hazard/threat potential effects information guides DAF wide 
preparation of forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war. 
1.7.2.  Operational. All MAJCOMs, FLDCOMs, and Space Commands (e.g., Air Operations 
Centers/Space Operations Centers) and Air Force Forces (AFFOR)/Space Force Forces staffs 
supporting CCMDs are susceptible to degrading all-hazard/threat effects and cascading 
impacts. The DAF EM Program generates shared battle space awareness along the C2 
continuum (regarding realized effects) and enables DAF functions to deploy and employ in 
and through the global all-hazard/threat operational environment. 
1.7.3.  Tactical. No DAF installation, in the continental U.S. (CONUS) or outside the CONUS 
(OCONUS), and/or OL is a sanctuary from the greatest hazard/threat effects. No installation 
has sufficient resources and/or capabilities and/or capacity to prevent, protect, prepare for, 
mitigate, respond to, and recover from its own from the greatest hazards/threats. Reliance on 
mission partners and varying schemes of maneuver (i.e., avoidance, dispersal, return to 
operate, etc.) are essential and prioritized means to enable force survivability and mission 
continuation. Speed and timing of conflict continuum adversarial fires requires ability to 
quickly execute EM and CBRN passive defense capabilities to out-maneuver enemy fires 
effects. 
1.8.  Emergency Management (EM) Preparedness System.  Collectively, the DAF EM 
Program at all levels will execute an adaptive DAF EM preparedness system to build resiliency 
through interoperable whole-of-nation/partner nation/community common core capabilities while 
supporting DAF contributions to global operations. The system will consist of seven components 
summarized below, illustrated in Figure 1.1, and expanded on in subsequent chapters. 
16 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
Figure 1.1.  Emergency Management (EM) Preparedness System Components. 
 
1.8.1.  Installation Risk Management (IRM).  Installation IRM assessments will identify 
protected assets (lives, key response/recovery resources, facilities, infrastructure, and 
missions), ascertain hazards/threats of greatest concern, determine protected asset 
vulnerability, describe consequences, express relative risk, and stipulate locally determined 
measurable needed/targeted common core capabilities. Installations will posture IRM 
information as the basis for other component actions (i.e., evaluate and identify capability gaps 
between targeted and existing common core capabilities through EM exercises, conduct 
planning to close capability gaps, and posture resultant information for use within each 
planning framework/actionable mission area). 
1.8.2.  Planning Framework and Mission Areas.  The DAF EM Program will use the 
defined planning framework and mission areas identified in Table 1.1 as a cornerstone 
component at all levels. Note:  This policy clarifies and synchronizes varying terms in 
fundamental documents such as PPD-8, DoDI 6055.17, and DAFTTP 3-2.83, Multi-Service 
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Emergency Management. The planning framework 
and mission areas will: 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
17 
1.8.2.1.  Facilitate installation internal integration and mission partner interoperability 
through shared use of common terminology, standardized processes, and systematic 
methods. 
1.8.2.2.  Serve as the basis for structure, functioning, and information integration and 
interoperability with mission partners across the spectrum of preparedness, response, and 
recovery. 
1.8.2.3.  Serve as the means to adapt to changing conditions, withstand, and rapidly recover 
from disruption due to incidents/enemy attack. 
1.8.2.4.  Unify integrated systematic organizational action along an all-hazard/threat 
incident/attack event horizon regarding risk information propagation, future plans, 
logistics, force development, and current plans and operations. See Attachment 1 for 
definitions and role responsibilities of propagation, future plans, logistics, force 
development, and current plans and operations. 
Table 1.1.  Planning Framework and Mission Area Description. 
Mission Area 
Primary Description and Actionable Output 
Prevent1,2 
Avoid or stop a threatened or an actual act of terrorism. Conveys terrorist 
and/or nation state adversary threat capability and intent to and through 
mission areas. Monitors hazards/threats and flows information into 
subsequent mission areas for action. 
Protect1,3 
Protect lives, key resources, facilities, infrastructure, and operational 
missions prior to and/or during all-hazard/threat incidents/attacks (if not 
prevented or mitigated). Includes a menu of physical and passive defense 
protective measures for application along the hazard/threat incident/attack 
event horizon (i.e., evacuation, sheltering, dispersal, hardening, etc.). 
Mitigate4 
Decrease the impact, severity, or consequences (for specific identified 
hazard/threat vulnerabilities) to fix the cycle of damage, reconstruction, and 
repeated damage. Strives to reduce future risks/recovery cost and build more 
resilient DAF installations. 
Respond 
Save lives; stabilize the incident; protect property, resources, facilities, 
infrastructure, and the environment; meet basic human needs; and set the 
stage to recover and restore mission capability. 
Recover 
Stabilize and restore lifeline systems (i.e., water, electrical systems, cyber 
systems, communications, shelter, and transportation), meet the needs of 
individuals/the installation community, and prioritize near and long-term 
mission generation ability. 
Notes: 
1. Relates to Joint Force Protection (FP) Active/Passive Defense for adversarial nation state 
attacks. 
2. Executed primarily through implementation of DoDI O-2000.16, Volume 1, DoD 
Antiterrorism Program Implementation:  DoD Antiterrorism Standards. 
3. Capabilities for if/when mission partners cannot prevent or mitigate hazards/threats. 
4. Although mitigation activities occur during all incidents, associated core capability 
execution primarily occurs well before and after initial recovery actions are complete.

Notes: 
1. Crosscutting capabilities applicable to (and to integrate) all mission areas. 
2. The DAF EM Program consolidates community resilience within education/training and 
risk management/assessments within integrated risk management. 
3. Expanded to include both response and recovery mission areas. Additive DAF core 
capability regarding mission restoration (operational and support) within infrastructure 
systems. Inclusive of IBRR. 
1.8.4.  Capability Evaluation and Validation.  DAF EM Programs at all echelons will utilize 
EM exercises detailed in Chapter 5 as the primary means to evaluate common core capabilities 
and identify gaps between targeted and existing common core capabilities. Included is the use 
of select EM exercises to validate installation operational readiness via inspections. In this 
context, EM exercises will evaluate EM capabilities and validate readiness, when applicable 
for inspections governed by DAFI 90-302, The Inspection System of the Department of the Air 
Force. 
1.8.5.  Program Management Reviews (PMR).  DAF EM Programs at all echelons will 
utilize EM PMRs detailed in Chapter 4 to improve program administration, increase 
preparedness, and execute a holistic risk management capability across the DAF EM enterprise 
via comprehensive EM planning, resourcing, and related actions. 
1.8.6.  Capability Investment Strategy.  All DAF EM Program echelons will contribute to 
the overall advancement of functional area integration and interoperability by funding and 
maintaining common core capabilities and cross-cutting activities. Functional areas are still 
responsible for their own investment strategies, which produce functional capabilities unique 
to their domain and contribute to the advancement of EM common core capabilities. 
1.8.7.  Adaptation via Information Integration and Interoperability.  Through time-
phased agile software development and fielding, DAF EM Programs at all echelons will 
employ an enterprise IT EMIS within the installation common operating picture (COP) (e.g., 
C2 Incident Management and Emergency Response Application). 
1.8.7.1.  The installation COP is an intuitive and interactive EM platform which provides 
enhanced C2 capability to commanders at all echelons, Wing Operations Center (WOC), 
Emergency Operations Center (EOC), and control centers. The installation COP can be 
20 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
integrated within other functional communities (e.g., Command Posts (CP), Maintenance 
Operations Centers, Base Defense Operations Centers [BDOCs], Emergency 
Communications Centers [ECCs], etc.) for unified and synchronized EM preparedness, 
response, and recovery activities. 
1.8.7.2.  DAF EMIS will operationally optimize EM information in support of tactical, 
operational, and strategic decision advantage, the DAF advanced battle management 
system (ABMS) campaign plan, and the joint all domain command and control (JADC2) 
construct as detailed in Chapter 11.

Chapter 4 
PLANNING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT (IRM) 
4.1.  Purpose.  Specify installation deliberate EM planning and IRM concepts and policy to 1) 
support development of targeted whole-of-community common core capabilities needed for multi-
jurisdictional response/recovery and 2) posture authoritative risk information layers needed to 
execute the entirety of the DAF EM preparedness system described in paragraph 1.8. 
Section 4A—Strategic Planning and Risk Management Approach 
4.2.  Program Administration.  The DAF EM Program will document an ongoing method for 
program evaluation, maintenance, and revision. In coordination with the EM advisory committees, 
all EM risk management products, plans, procedures, and resource management products will be 
reviewed and updated at least annually. (T-0) 
4.3.  EM Program Execution Strategy.  The scope and depth of risk from catastrophic natural 
disasters and/or adversarial nation state CBRNE attacks will regulate installation planning and risk 
management activities to include related OT&E and exercise requirements. (T-0) 
4.3.1.  The DAF installation CBRNE Risk Index and FEMA National Risk Index will inform 
and shape advanced EM and CBRN defense capabilities for in-place forces and deployment to 
include ACE concepts. Requirements will align within the EM planning framework/mission 
areas and common core capabilities to support interoperability with mission partners. (T-1) 
4.3.2.  Installations will reference Table 4.1 and apply Tactical Emergency Management 
Program Execution Requirements (TEMPER) as a cornerstone DAF EM Program policy to 
holistically plan for and manage all-hazard/threat effects. (T-1) 
50 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
Table 4.1.  Installation Tactical Emergency Management Program Execution 
Requirements (TEMPER). 
 
4.4.  Risk Information Propagation.  AFIMSC will publish, develop, maintain, and sustain an 
installation adversarial nation-state CBRNE risk index. The CBRNE risk index will: 
4.4.1.  Serve as authoritative and foundational event function of risk information propagation 
to inform installation EM and CBRN defense future plans, logistics, force development, 
current plans, and operational response/recovery functions. (T-1) 
4.4.2.  Consolidate and translate adversarial nation-state CBRNE weapons/threats into a 
holistic level of risk and effects regarding lives, key resources, facilities, infrastructure, and 
operational missions (tactical to strategic) for all DAF installations/MOBs/FOSs. (T-1) 
4.4.3.  Generate a holistic DAF protected asset profile that will involve the identification and 
prioritization of installations and facilities, along with associated tenants, to maximize 
preparedness, resilience, and readiness with limited fiscal resources. (T-0) 
4.4.4.  Source and account for OLs within the Enduring Location Master List and the 
Contingency Location Master List. Lists are managed by the Office of the Under Secretary of 
Defense for Policy (OUSDP), refer to DoDI 3000.12, Management of U.S. Global Defense 
Posture (GDP), for more information. (T-0) 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
51 
4.4.5.  Support identification of installation passive defense, EM, force health protection 
OT&E, and deliberate planning assumptions requirements for specified installations as 
influenced by select CCMDs and associated Air Components/C-MAJCOMs. For context, 
deliberate planning assumptions will relate to estimates regarding casualties, level of 
damage/destruction, number of personnel requiring dispersal/relocation, CBRN contamination 
levels/hazard duration, etc. In addition, the risk index will inform additive planning and IEMP 
requirements for passive defense aspects such as dispersal, hardening, camouflage, 
concealment, and deception, COLPRO/shelters, and CBRN defense/response. (T-1) 
4.4.6.  Employ operational assessments and geospatial modeling and simulation to isolate and 
correlate layered kinetic, electromagnetic, and individual to layered CBRNE hazard/threat 
predictive enemy/red attack effects on lives, key resources, facilities, infrastructure, and 
operational mission generation assets. (T-1) Outputs of this activity will: 
4.4.6.1.  Directly support DAF advancement of overarching ACE, passive defense, EM, 
and force health protection CONOPS. (T-1) 
4.4.6.2.  Support EM and CBRN defense counter effects materiel/non-materiel solution 
requirement development. (T-1) 
4.4.6.3.  Provide hazard/threat effects for collective training/exercise events and 
inspections (e.g., a 3-day operational readiness exercise with X percent of population killed 
in action; Y percent of population wounded in action; Z percent of resources and 
infrastructure damaged; and impacts on operational missions to include cascading effects). 
(T-1) 
4.4.6.4.  Inform synchronization and prioritization of operational targeting for CWMD 
defeat/prevent/protect actions. (T-1) 
4.5.  Emergency Management (EM) Program Capabilities Based Planning.  EM planning at 
all echelons will facilitate integration and mission partner interoperability through the common 
core capabilities identified in Table 1.2 and detailed in Attachment 3 and Attachment 4. (T-0) 
4.5.1.  Installation commanders (through EMWG advisement) will implement risk 
management decisions to avoid, control, transfer, or accept risk. (T-0) Variations in assigned 
and/or resourcing of installation functional area assets/capabilities could result in a functional 
area not having the ability to execute/achieve an installation determined specified targeted core 
capability (e.g., resultant capability gap). Through PPD-8/national preparedness systematic 
design, the installation EMWG, in collaboration with mission partners, use common core 
capabilities as the basis to determine whole-of-community capability gaps and conduct 
planning to address risk (i.e., create functional and/or cross-functional MAAs with mission 
partners). 
4.5.2.  Functional areas are responsible for assessing, resourcing, and/or communicating gaps 
as informed through this policy and specific functional area policy/guidance. 
4.6.  Emergency Management (EM) Planning and Risk Management Cycle.  EM Programs at 
all echelons will collaborate and execute a continuous EM planning and IRM cycle (example 
illustrated in Figure 4.1). (T-1) Note:  Although the cycle generates critical information needed 
to develop portions of the IEMP 10-2, the primary purpose of the cycle is to continually build all-
hazard/threat awareness and advance whole-of-community/DAF common core capabilities.

administration through DoD/DAF EM Program advisory and governance committees and do 
not constitute inspection and continual evaluation activities defined by DAFI 90-302, that 
specifies continual evaluation pertains to functional communities and DAFI 10-2501 is a cross-
functional program. Installation and unit level PMRs will: 
4.7.1.1.  Apply a risk-based frequency cycle (presented in Table 4.3) as determined by the 
IOEM and approved by the EMWG. In this regard, the greater the risk from installation 
specific all-hazards/threats, the more TEMPER to the EMWG. (T-1) 
4.7.1.2.  Provide training and assistance to UEPC regarding specific requirements 
identified in the IEMP 10-2 and pertinent unit provided targeted common core capabilities 
(i.e., public information and warning, operational communications, situational assessment,

practices to fulfill cross-functional (i.e., 10-series) policy. (T-1) 
4.7.1.6.  Generate common hierarchical information regarding status of unit level and 
installation EM Programs across the DAF and culminate in an annual holistic AFIMSC 
I&MS EM Program SPR to guide and enable operational and strategic EMWG program 
adaptation via information. (T-1) 
4.7.2.  Operational Level. To facilitate installation and unit level PMRs and DAF EM via 
information, AFIMSC will establish, maintain, and facilitate methods for unit commanders 
and advisory committees to collect, consolidate, and generate common matrixed information 
to include gaps within Installation EM Preparedness System components of IRM, planning 
framework/mission areas, associated common core capabilities, evaluation/validation results, 
and other information (i.e., local AARs/lessons learned and status of EM training, exercises, 
plans, etc.). (T-1) 
4.7.3.  Strategic Level. AFIMSC will provide a I&MS EM Program SPR to the DAF EMWG 
annually. The SPR will: 
4.7.3.1.  Express the scope and depth of near-to-far term all-hazard/threat risk trends to 
installations (i.e., morphing terrorist/nation state threats/weapons effects, future severe 
weather/climate conditions, etc.). (T-1) 
4.7.3.2.  Indicate the status of IEMPs, training, exercises, and equipment. (T-1) 
4.7.3.3.  Present overarching global EM Program common core capability gaps aligned 
within mission areas. (T-1)

Section 4B—Installation Planning and Risk Management Execution Roles 
4.8.  Overview.  The IOEM, EMWG, EP2T, and UEPCs, will collaborate and prepare installations 
for hazards/threats of greatest concern. (T-1) Unit commanders should consider consolidating 
personnel within various roles to increase efficiency and contribution to installation resilience and 
preparedness. Note:  Although not a specific part of the installation EM planning and risk 
management construct, the Installation Plans office (e.g., XP) or OSS/OSX for AFRC host 
installations will support and assist the IOEM in the coordination and publishing of the IEMP 10-
2. (T-1) 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
55 
4.9.  Installation Office of Emergency Management (IOEM).  Under the leadership and 
guidance of the IEM, the IOEM will assist in management of the installation EM Program and 
facilitate cross-functional integration and mission partner interoperability through execution of the 
installation planning and IRM cycle indicated in Figure 4.1 (T-1) Military, civilians, and 
contractors assigned to the IOEM as emergency responders will not be tasked with additional 
duties (e.g., facility manager, security manager, snow removal augmentee, antiterrorism 
representative, etc.). (T-1) 
4.10.  Installation Emergency Management Working Group (EMWG).  As specified in 
paragraph 3.8, the EMWG will manage risk and prioritize protected asset categories (lives, 
facilities/resources, infrastructure, and missions) based on installation EP2T all-hazard/threat risk 
assessment results (and related outside agency risk assessments). (T-1) The EMWG senior level 
oversight will inform functional and cross-functional development of targeted/needed capabilities 
to protect assets and establish resourcing priorities to close identified capability gaps. 
4.11.  Unit Emergency Preparedness Coordinators (UEPC).  Primary UEPC will be a 
minimum of an E-5, GS-05 or equivalent, or contract support. (T-1) UEPCs will support the 
Installation EM Program as directed by the installation commander, unit commander, and IEM. 
Specific UEPC responsibilities are as follows: 
4.11.1.  Receive training IAW Chapter 5 and Attachment 5. 
4.11.2.  Create and maintain a unit EM continuity folder IAW the IOEM template, either hard 
copy or electronic, containing a copy of the unit’s quarterly EM Program report and semi-
annually for the ARC. (T-2)  
4.11.3.  Identify and prioritize the unit’s protected assets (e.g., lives, key resources, 
infrastructure, operational missions, etc.). (T-2) 
4.11.4.  Attend and participate in the EP2T. (T-2)  
4.11.5.  On behalf of the unit commander, develop unit SOPs, supporting checklists (or EAPs) 
to support the unit requirements for the IEMP 10-2. (T-2) 
4.11.6.  Ensure dissemination of EM Program training material throughout the unit to support 
the installation’s emergency preparedness awareness campaign. (T-2) 
4.11.7.  Ensure the unit participates in the Installation SIP program for unit facilities IAW the 
installation AHTA and IEMP 10-2. (T-2) 
4.11.8.  Obtain on- and off- base emergency response maps with crash grid overlay from the 
IOEM and provide to associated control center and response vehicles. 
4.12.  Inspector General (IG).  As depicted in Figure 4.1, the IG performs a pinnacle function 
within the installation planning and IRM cycle through evaluating mission area actionable outputs 
(defined in Table 1.1) and common core capabilities (identified in Table 1.2) during all-
hazard/threat installation wide EM exercises. In this regard, the IG provides evaluation reports and 
input to the Commander’s Inspection Management Board, EMWG, and the installation 
commander regarding the installation’s ability to prevent, protect, prepare for, mitigate, respond 
to, and recover from physical hazard/threat effects that pose the greatest risk to lives, key resources, 
infrastructure, and operational missions.

DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
Section 4C—Community Profile Process and Protected Assets 
4.13.  Concept.  The community profile process is an essential function that generates cornerstone 
information for the execution of the installation EM Program. The concept centers on identification 
and prioritization of protected assets and information layers for subsequent use while conducting 
IRM assessments, planning activities, and for use during response and recovery operations. The 
demographic analysis identifies and locates personnel, important facilities/resources, routine and 
critical infrastructure, and/or mission assets that require some type of protection (i.e., evacuation, 
sheltering, hardening, dispersal, etc.). 
4.14.  Overview.  The EMWG, through the EP2T, is primarily responsible for generating the 
community profile and identifying protected assets. The installation commander will review and 
approve the community profile and protected assets annually. All other units and tenants will 
support the EP2T and provide support as needed. (T-1) The IEM will facilitate generation of the 
community profile and a protected asset listing with direct support from the EP2T. (T-1) 
4.15.  Community Profile Requirements.  The community profile will identify population 
demographics, density, and distribution to include characteristics and locations regarding protected 
assets of 1) lives/personnel, 2) key facilities/resources, 3) infrastructure, and 4) primary operational 
mission assets. Included will be shared protected asset category focal points as presented in 
Attachment 2. (T-0) Note:  The term location is relative to the typical day-to-day fixed locality 
of protected assets. Planning teams should consider recruiting stations, reserve units, and other 
outposts that may be geographically separated as part of the community profile. 
4.15.1.  Accumulated data will consist of static and geospatial locality information regarding 
protected assets. Information generated will be included within the IEMP 10-2 and DAF EMIS 
(or other EOC COP IT applications employed). 
4.15.2.  Installations should take all community factors listed in Table 4.4 into planning 
consideration.

populations (UVP) identified in Attachment 2. (T-1) 
4.15.3.1.  The facility and infrastructure priority lists should account for response/recovery 
from natural/technological incidents when operational mission demands are low and when 
response/recovery from adversarial nation state CBRNE attacks during MCO sortie 
generation and/or weapons systems demands are high. 
4.15.3.2.  The intent of this policy is to preposition decision advantage by specifying 
priorities aligned within anticipated hazard/threat effect categories (natural, technological, 
and human-caused) and executed within actionable mission areas. 
4.15.3.3.  Protected asset priorities will serve as a means to apply limited resources with 
respect to reducing risk before an incident/attack to prevent, protect, prepare for, mitigate, 
respond to, and recover from all-hazard/threat effects to protected assets. In contrast, 
protected asset priorities will serve as a means to apply limited resources to effectively 
respond to incidents/attacks, save lives, and recover installations while balancing force 
survivability and mission continuation demands. 
4.15.4.  The community profile process will account for task critical assets located on and/or 
supported by the installation. (T-0) Note:  Compilation of the community profile and protected 
asset information is finalized after completion of IRM assessments. 
4.15.4.1.  Task critical assets (TCA) pertain to global, trans-regional, multi-domain, or 
multi-functional missions designated by the Secretary of Defense (SecDef) as vital to 
national security and critical to the execution of strategic priorities and plans. DoDD 
3020.40, Mission Assurance (MA), provides the basis for Defense Critical Infrastructure 
including TCAs and Defense Critical Assets. 
4.15.4.2.  The appointed Mission Assurance point of contact (MA POC) will have the 
primary role regarding identification of these assets. The MA POC, IEM, EP2T, and 
EMWG will collaborate and ensure MA related assets are accounted for within the 
planning and risk management process to include actionable mission area outcomes. 
Although much of the information concerning MA assets is classified, installations will 
follow appropriate operations security safeguards. 
4.15.4.3.  TCAs are contained within each protected asset category. Consider a MA 
protected asset special identifier to highlight and segregate these assets for planning and 
risk management activities to include focusing operational response and recovery missions 
on these assets. 
4.15.4.4.  Include DAF protection level resources that relate to MA. 
4.15.5.  The DAF EMIS, through spiral development, will contain functionality to account for 
the community profile process described with resultant ability to assign and determine 
protected asset vulnerability attributes for the full range of installation (and mission partner) 
identified natural, technological, human-caused terrorism/nation state hazard/threat effects.

4.16.  Output of Community Profile Information into Emergency Management (EM) 
Education, Training, and Exercises (ET&E). 
4.16.1.  The IOEM will incorporate local community profile protected assets and focal point 
information as a training course objective for senior leader orientation, base populace, CBRN 
defense, shelter management team (SMT)/mass care, and other courses as to provide localized 
and tailored information to improve situational awareness and enhance unit/individual 
protection of protected assets. 
4.16.2.  The installation IG and IOEM will use the local community profile and installation 
identified protected asset information to inform exercise related Master Scenario Events List 
(MSEL) inputs (e.g., inputs that target specific prioritized assets). 
Section 4D—Integrated Risk Management (IRM) 
4.17.  Concept.  Installations will identify hazards/threats that have the greatest potential to impact 
their jurisdiction, the likelihood of their occurrence, and the vulnerability of supported missions, 
assigned personnel, property, facilities, infrastructure, the environment, and the jurisdiction as a 
whole to these hazards/threats. (T-0) Once hazards/threats are identified, installations will identify 
consequences, establish target/needed common core capabilities, and evaluate postured 
capabilities. (T-1) In this context, installations will attempt to prevent the hazard/threat from 
impacting the installation and mitigate the potential effects of identified hazards/threats to reduce 
the resulting consequences of those hazards/threats. 
4.18.  Overview.  The EMWG, through the EP2T, is primarily responsible for conducting IRM 
activities with the technical direction and facilitative support of the IEM and IOEM. The 
installation commander will annually review, acknowledge assessment results, and establish 
overarching EM Program priorities. (T-0) All other units and tenants will support the EMWG and 
EP2T and provide support as needed. 
4.19.  Risk Assessment Requirements.  Risk assessments will provide the installation 
commander and the EMWG with the information and evaluation necessary to make risk decisions. 
4.19.1.  The IEMP 10-2 is a direct result of the installation commander and/or EMWG 
direction to develop cross-functional EM and functional area capabilities to respond to and 
recover from identified hazards/threats. As such, installations will complete the risk 
management process prior to the development of the IEMP 10-2. (T-0) A similar timeline 
exists for the development of the installation AT plan as detailed in DoDI 2000.16, Volume 1, 
with a notable exception the EM risk management process integrates all hazards/threats, vice 
solely terrorism, into the process. 
4.19.2.  Accumulated risk assessment data will be included within the IEMP 10-2 and DAF 
EMIS (or other EOC COP IT applications employed) to support responders and the EOC. 
4.19.3.  IRM activities and assessments detailed in Attachment 2 will: 
4.19.3.1.  Identify and prioritize assets that need protection. (T-1) 
4.19.3.2.  Identify the most likely/most dangerous all-hazards/threats for 1) natural, 2) 
technological, and 3) human-caused unintentional and 4) human-caused intentional. (T-1) 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
59 
4.19.3.3.  Identify vulnerability of protected assets regarding the hazards/threats of greatest 
concern. (T-1) 
4.19.3.4.  Identify potential consequences/effects that a recognized hazard may have on 
protected assets, the installation as a whole, or a specific function based on the current level 
of installation EM common core capabilities. (T-1) Note:  CONUS installations will 
reference to DHS Comprehensive Planning Guide (CPG) 201, National Threat and Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) to generate a metrics with a common 
language such as affected population, number of people requiring evacuation, or number 
of people requiring MCS to assist with whole-of-community interoperability. 
4.19.3.5.  Assess the installation’s current level of EM common core capabilities based 
upon integrated non-materiel and materiel readiness of the supporting functional areas. 
Installations will conduct this action through a combination EMWG analysis, EM exercise 
evaluation, and PMRs. (T-1) 
4.19.3.6.  Establish capability targets (i.e., capability needed) based on estimated 
impacts/effects to protected assets from the identified hazards/threats of greatest concern. 
(T-1) 
4.19.3.7.  Determine relative risk in terms of vulnerability, consequence, and the capability 
of the installation to manage the resulting emergencies. Includes the need to identify, 
monitor, and track gaps between needed capabilities (targeted capabilities) and current 
capabilities. (T-1) 
4.19.3.8.  Conduct planning and adjust plans to address capability gaps (i.e., 
establish/update MOU/MOA) or present alternative means to manage the identified risk to 
the EMWG (i.e., risk avoidance, control, transfer, or acceptance). (T-1) 
4.19.3.9.  Evaluate combined vulnerability, consequence, and installation capability to 
manage realized hazard/threat effects. Since all hazards/threats are not equal in terms of 
probability or severity, installations will establish relative risk factors in order for the 
EMWG and the Installation Commander to conduct risk management across the entire 
jurisdiction vice solely based upon vulnerability and/or consequence of a specific hazard 
to a specific mission. (T-1) 
4.19.3.10.  Reference DAFI 10-2503 and the CBRNE Risk Index to identify and account 
for human caused adversarial nation state enemy fires effects and associated additive 
OT&E and planning requirements/assumptions at OCONUS locations. (T-1) 
4.19.3.11.  Identify, through the annual installation EM Program management review, the 
installations level of risk regarding hazard/threat effect categories. (T-1) Note:  AFIMSC 
will consolidate this risk information and present it to the DAF EMWG during the annual 
operational and strategic SPR. 
4.19.3.12.  Use a holistic approach to assess each hazard/threat, to include criminal and 
terrorism hazards/threats, from the perspective of vulnerability, consequence, and the 
capability to prevent, protect, prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the 
hazard/threat. (T-1) 
 
 
60 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
4.19.3.13.  Account for risk management evolution as the installation identifies 
hazard/threat effects, develops and/or employs prevention/protection capabilities, 
completes mitigation actions, and matures common core capabilities to respond to and 
recover from identified hazards/threats. (T-1) 
4.19.4.  When classification requires, DAF installations will develop and maintain a 
SECRET-level AHTA utilizing the DTRA AHTA methodology (as specified in DoDI 
6055.17) to identify natural, technological, and human-caused threats/hazards (including 
terrorism and terrorist/adversarial use of WMD on DAF-led installations CONUS and 
OCONUS) to shape planning and preparedness activities/requirements. (T-0) 
4.20.  Related Resources.  IRM activities and assessments are complex activities that require use 
of valid and authoritative data. 
4.20.1.  Installations will reference DAFTTP 3-2.83, and the concepts contained within the 
DHS CPG 201 to assist with overall risk management and assessment activities as applicable. 
(T-0) 
4.20.2.  The installation EMWG and EP2T will use emerging validated and authoritative 
technology and threat sensing of publicly available information to help inform the criticality, 
hazard/threat, vulnerability, and capability assessments. (T-1) These tools will also provide 
commanders situational awareness in near-real time so that pre-defined hazards and threats can 
be detected and identified early enough to inform the decision-making process. 
4.20.3.  Installations within the CONUS will utilize the DHS National Risk Index and the 
associated natural disaster Resilience Analysis and Planning Tool to inform assessment, 
planning considerations, hazard mitigation (resilience) plans, and within the EOC to support 
response and recovery operations. (T-1) 
4.20.4.  Installations within the CONUS should utilize the DHS Homeland Infrastructure 
Foundation-Level Data to inform foundational level overarching geospatial data and 
assessment, planning considerations, hazard mitigation (resilience) plans, and within the EOC 
to support response and recovery operations. (T-2) 
4.20.5.  Installations will utilize the Installation Geospatial Information and Services Program 
(aka GeoBase) as the authoritative data source regarding the installation natural and built 
infrastructure for planning considerations, hazard mitigation (resilience) plans, and within the 
EOC to support response and recovery operations. (T-1) 
4.21.  Output of Integrated Risk Management (IRM) Information into Emergency 
Management (EM) Education, Training, and Exercises (ET&E). 
4.21.1.  The installation commander, through the IOEM, will incorporate risk assessment 
results as training course objectives for senior leader orientation briefings, base emergency 
preparedness orientation (BEPO), first and emergency responder training, CBRN defense, 
SMT, and other courses as determined locally. (T-1) The intent of this policy is to provide 
localized and tailored all-hazard/threat risk information to improve situational awareness and 
enhance unit/individual actions to respond to and recover from all-hazard/threat effects. The 
IOEM should provide geospatial visualization of information as illustrated in Figure 11.1. 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
61 
4.21.2.  The installation IG and IOEM, in partnership with WIT/DIT and installation Exercise 
Planners (XP) (where applicable), will use integrated risk information for exercise planning, 
scenario development, and inputs (e.g., induce simulated hazard/threat effects targeting 
identified vulnerabilities for protected assets and associated focal points). (T-1) 
Section 4E—Emergency Management (EM) Planning 
4.22.  Concept.  Generally, installation EM planning should concentrate planning efforts on 
NIMS Type 3 incidents defined in Table 7.1. Emergency planning is a continual process of (1) 
establishing the missions, requirements, and operational concepts for each EM mission area within 
a specific jurisdiction; (2) directing the development of identified EM capabilities within the 
jurisdiction, (3) synchronizing the actions of assigned functional areas with the established 
operational concept, and (4) determining the jurisdiction’s actions specific to each identified 
hazard/threat. 
4.23.  Overview.  The EMWG and the EP2T are responsible for executing the emergency 
planning process with the technical direction and facilitative support of the IEM and IOEM. (T-1) 
All other units/agencies will support the EMWG, EP2T, IEM, and IOEM to include tenant units. 
4.24.  Emergency Management (EM) Planning Requirements.  Information generated through 
EM planning activities will be incorporated in the IEMP IAW DoDI 6055.17. (T-0) 
4.24.1.  The EMWG, EP2T, and IEM will use the IEMP 10-2 planning tool (administered by 
AFCEC/CXR) to facilitate the development and maintenance of the IEMP for installations 
where the DAF is the lead. (T-3) 
4.24.2.  Information generated through EM planning activities will be incorporated into DAF 
EMIS (or other EOC COP IT applications employed). (T-2) 
4.24.3.  DELETED 
4.24.4.  Installations will address EM planning requirements within the IEMP as summarized 
in Table 4.5 and expanded on in Attachment 3. (T-0)

core capabilities (e.g., estimated casualties, key resources/facility damage/destruction, 
etc.). See Attachment 4. 
4.25.  Related Resources.  Installations will use the planning process described in CPG 101, 
Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans, and CPG 201, Threat and Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) and Stakeholder Preparedness Review (SPR) Guide, 
to facilitate compatibility and interoperability with external response and recovery partners. (T-0) 
Additional EM planning guidance is found in DAFTTP 3-2.83. 
4.26.  Output of Emergency Management (EM) Planning Results into Education, Training, 
and Exercises (ET&E). 
4.26.1.  The installation commander, through the IOEM, should incorporate local planning 
results into training course objectives for the senior leader orientation briefings, BEPO, CBRN 
defense, SME, and other courses as determined locally. 
4.26.2.  The installation IG, IOEM, WIT/DIT personnel, and installation XP (where 
applicable) will use planning results for exercise planning, scenario development, and inputs 
(e.g., induce simulated hazard/threat effects to stress test EM planed functions and common 
core capabilities such as operational communications, public warning and notification systems, 
evacuation routes, dispersal, and relocation, etc.). (T-1) 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023

Section 4F—Installation Emergency Management (EM) Plan Content 
4.27.  Concept.  The content of an IEMP 10-2 is focused on the development of EM common core 
capabilities within a jurisdiction and the coordination of such EM capability between supporting 
jurisdictions. The IEMP 10-2 cites its legal basis, states its mission, goals, objectives, and purpose, 
defines the plan development and maintenance processes, and acknowledges assumptions. 
4.28.  Overview. 
4.28.1.  The installation commander will be the approval authority for the IEMP 10-2. (T-1) 
4.28.2.  The IEM will coordinate plans, where appropriate, with other federal departments and 
agencies; state, tribal, and local governments; other DoD components; or host nation 
emergency response agencies and departments to identify and update responsible POCs, 
emergency protocols, and expectations in the event of an incident on or affecting a DoD 
installation IAW DoDI 6055.17, DoDIO-2000.16V1_AFI31-245-O, DoDI 6055.06, DoDI 
6200.03. (T-0) 
4.28.3.  Interagency coordination should include information sharing, pre-incident NIMS 
resource management typing, communications, incident management, and capabilities that 
may provide early warning of a potential hazard or threat. Note:  Reference Chapter 7 for 
more information on resource management. 
4.29.  Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) Requirements. 
4.29.1.  The IEMP 10-2 will address and contain EM plan requirements IAW DoDI 6055.17, 
paragraph 3.3. (T-0) 
4.29.2.  An IEMP 10-2 must provide a detailed operational concept for the prevention of, 
response to, and recovery from all identified hazards based upon a common EM and incident 
management construct. (T-0) 
4.29.3.  Hazard/Threat-specific response plans (e.g., CBRN defense and response plans, 
terrorism response plans, and severe weather plans) will be coordinated or integrated with the 
IEMP 10-2. (T-0) Consider adding classified annexes to cover incidents involving Special 
Access Programs (e.g., 5th generation aircraft). This integration is necessary to ensure that all 
existing hazard/threat-based planning efforts are consistent with the development and 
execution EM common core capabilities. 
4.29.4.  Planners will use the IRM process to focus the IEMP 10-2 properly and balance 
survivability and mission effectiveness before, during, and after an attack IAW this instruction 
and DAFI 10-2503. 
4.29.5.  Disease containment planning and procedures. The installation’s PHEO and MEM 
(PHEO-POC for ARC) will be responsible for the developing and maintaining the installation-
level disease containment planning efforts. (T-1) Note:  Reference guidance provided within 
the IEMP 10-2 Planning Tool. 
4.29.6.  The installation EMWG integrates disease containment planning and management 
functions. An EMWG sub-working group, the PHEM Working Group, can be used to assist 
with installation-level disease containment planning efforts. (T-1) 
64 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
4.29.7.  The Installation Surgeon General-appointed PHEM Incident Lead (PHEM-IL) will 
oversee the IEMP 10-2 disease annex in coordination with the EOC Director, during a public 
health emergency IAW DoDI 6200.03, AFI 10-2519, and the IEMP 10-2. (T-0) Note:  An 
appropriately trained fire representative will remain the IC for all incidents requiring a public 
health emergency response. 
4.29.8.  Units will create a supporting checklist for each line item in which they are identified 
as an OPR or office of collateral responsibility (OCR). (T-1) Note: UEPCs will submit 
supporting checklists to the IOEM annually, or when supporting checklists are updated. 
Section 4G—Tenant and Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) Emergency Action Plans 
(EAP) 
4.30.  Concept.  The primary focus of the tenant and GSUs EAP is to synchronize tenant 
organizations actions during an emergency with the operations of the installation to execute 
protective action recommendations for assigned personnel and support response and recovery 
operations. Under 29 CFR 1910.32–39, the tenant EAP applies to all visitors, guests, contractors, 
and normally assigned personnel as required by 29 CFR 1910.32–39, DoDI O-2000.16, and DoDI 
6055.17. (T-0) Note:  Installations that share resources under the same installation commander 
will be considered one installation for the purpose of the EM Program, at the discretion of the host 
installation commander. The host IOEM will provide tenants and GSUs with program oversight 
and support. 
4.31.  Overview. 
4.31.1.  Tenant and GSU commanders will ensure EAPs are reviewed/updated annually or 
within 60 days of change of command. (T-0) 
4.31.2.  The IOEM will centrally manage a repository of all signed tenant and GSU EAPs as 
part of the installation EM Program. (T-1) 
4.32.  Emergency Action Plan (EAP) Requirements. 
4.32.1.  Tenant and GSU EAPs will define how a specific command/unit residing within a 
specific jurisdiction (e.g., a DAF installation) will develop and employ required EM 
capabilities to support functions assigned and identified in the IEMP 10-2. (T-1) 
4.32.2.  EAPs will include, at a minimum, MWN procedures, evacuation, personnel 
accountability, SIP locations and requirements, primary and alternate UEPCs, and immediate 
emergency response actions. (T-0) 
4.33.  Department of Defense (DoD) Schools.  Schools and their associated population present a 
unique challenge to an EM Program. All DoD schools residing on DAF installations will develop, 
organize to, train to, and exercise to a school EAP. (T-0) This applies to schools residing on DAF 
installations that are administered by DoD, DoS, local, or private authorities or organizations. A 
recommended online resource for such planning is multi-hazard emergency planning for schools 
(IS–362A) available at https://training.fema.gov/is/crslist.aspx.

EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXERCISES 
(ET&E) 
5.1.  Purpose.  Specify DAF EM related force development methodology, audiences, 
required/recommended E&T, and related EM exercise requirements as a crosscutting common 
core capability to generate mission area capabilities specified in Table 1.2. Note:  Although CBRN 
Defense exercises fall under the DAF EM Program, Exercises pertaining to wartime/MCO in and 
through a CBRN environment during contingency operations OCONUS are provided in Chapter 
7 of DAFI 10-2503. The EM E&T and exercise capabilities will: 
5.1.1.  Transition DAF EM E&T and exercises to a capabilities-based construct aligned and 
synchronized with mission areas and common core capabilities. (T-1) 
5.1.2.  Provide EM related knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that produce the ability for 
installations to prevent, protect, prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from all-
hazard/threat effects. (T-1) 
5.1.3.  Complement and enhance functional KSAs towards collective action to achieve mission 
area outcomes through common core capabilities. (T-1) 
5.1.4.  Establish minimum EM E&T standards for effective management of multi-agency and 
multijurisdictional emergencies resulting from the spectrum of natural, technological, and 
human-caused incidents/attacks. (T-1) 
Section 5A—Emergency Management (EM) Education and Training (E&T) 
5.2.  Concept.  The tactical, operational, and strategic DAF EM Program construct 
positions/functions/teams specified in Table 3.1 constitute DAF EM Program E&T audiences. 
Personnel performing in these roles will obtain EM mission area and core capability related KSAs 
through completing various required and recommended courses (e.g., DoD/DAF functional 
community formal training, DAF specific EM courses, and/or DHS EM related courses). 
5.3.  Overview. 
5.3.1.  Individuals assigned to EM Program roles will complete the prescribed DAF EM E&T 
courses listed in Table 5.1 based on the course applicability listing in Attachment 5. (T-1) 
5.3.2.  Individuals filling various EM Program roles are encouraged to complete recommended 
DHS EM related E&T courses within the DHS National Preparedness Course Catalog. See 
Attachment 5 for additional DHS EM E&T audience opportunities to advance their KSAs 
regarding opportunities aligned with mission areas and common core capabilities. Note:   
Multiple distance learning courses are available (at no cost to individuals/units) to include 
mobile and resident courses. Functional communities and installations are responsible for 
scheduling and costs associated with mobile and resident courses. 
 
 
66 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
5.3.3.  As part of localized targeted EM E&T, the EMWG should consider specifying 
recommended DHS courses for EM Program audiences (based on local hazards/threats). The 
EMWG, through the IEM, should reference the CBRNE Risk Index, Natural Disaster Risk 
Index, the Resilience Analysis Planning Tool, the DHS National Preparedness Course Catalog, 
and other sources as applicable to determine if recommended courses should be required for 
personnel filling EM Program roles. The IEM will include local EM E&T requirements within 
the IEMP 10-2. 
5.3.4.  Functional CFMs are encouraged to evaluate recommended DHS EM E&T courses and 
establish courses as requirements within functional specific guidance and/or insert into the 
associated career field education and training plan (CFETP). 
5.3.5.  AFIMSC will, through DAF EM E&T course development efforts, address and 
prioritize crosscutting and response situational assessment capabilities into DAF specific 
courses (e.g., all-hazard/threat planning and IRM, EM exercises, public information and 
warning, operational coordination/NIMS, and situational assessment/EOCs). (T-1) 
5.3.6.  AFIMSC will conduct a DAF EM E&T gap analysis regarding existing DAF EM 
courses every two years. (T-1) AFIMSC will present findings to the DAF EMWG 
recommended DAF provided and/or DHS sourced required and recommended courses for 
DAF EM Program audiences identified in Table 3.1. (T-1) 
5.4.  Emergency Management (EM) Education and Training (E&T) Requirements. 
5.4.1.  Scheduling and Documentation. Installation and tenant unit deployment managers, unit 
training managers, or unit training schedulers will use the ARIS Unit Scheduler Module to 
schedule personnel for DAF EM E&T instructor led components or courses conducted by the 
IOEM. (T-1) 
5.4.1.1.  Unit schedulers must maintain a unit personnel roster to include adding and 
removing personnel upon moving from their organization (e.g., permanent change of 
station, permanent change of assignment, retirement/separation, etc.). Each unit is 
responsible for tracking completion and currency of their personnel. (T-1) 
5.4.1.2.  Deployment managers, unit training managers, or unit training schedulers will 
verify prerequisite(s) are completed prior to scheduling individuals for the instructor-led 
courses. (T-2) 
5.4.1.3.  Units must maintain documentation of DAF EM E&T course completion. (T-2) 
5.4.2.  Delivery Formats. DAF EM E&T courses are delivered using individual knowledge-
based objectives, localized, and performance-based objectives. 
5.4.2.1.  Unless otherwise specified, the individual knowledge-based component of 
courses is found online via the Air Force myLearning website (https://lms-
jets.cce.af.mil/moodle/). The online knowledge-based course component is an individual 
effort. 
5.4.2.2.  EM personnel will use traditional instructor-led classroom methods to deliver the 
localized and performance-based component of a course. (T-1) Presentations include 
localized mission and threat procedures and hands-on evaluation of a student’s ability to 
perform applicable tasks.

Section 5B—Emergency Management (EM) Exercises 
5.5.  Concept.  EM exercises provide installation commanders with a critical means to collectively 
evaluate installation functional EM mission area outputs and related crosscutting and common 
core capabilities. EM exercises also enhance external interoperability with other federal 
departments and agencies; state, tribal, and local governments; other service components; or host 
nation emergency response agencies and departments. 
5.6.  Overview. 
5.6.1.  The installation IG and IOEM, in partnership with WIT/DIT and installation XP (where 
applicable), will plan, execute, and conduct mission area and common core capability 
evaluation and validation for EM exercises IAW DAFI 10-2501 and DAFI 90-302. (T-1) 
5.6.2.  IAW DoDI 6055.17, to the maximum extent possible, installation EM exercise design, 
conduct, and evaluation must use the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program 
(HSEEP) that provides a set of fundamental principles for exercise programs, as well as a 
common approach to program management, design and development, conduct, evaluation, and 
improvement planning. (T-0) 
5.6.3.  Personnel that design, conduct, or evaluate EM functions and tasks are highly 
encouraged to complete HSEEP training - IS-120.c: An Introduction to Exercises (prerequisite) 
and IS-0146: HSEEP training. Note:  HSEEP training can be found through the National 
Preparedness Catalog at https://www.firstrespondertraining.gov/frts/npccatalog. 
5.6.4.  The IEM will provide advice and support to the wing/delta IGs and WIT/DIT personnel 
regarding overarching EM exercise planning, design, and evaluation as to identify gaps in 
crosscutting and mission area common core capabilities and present to the EMWG chair for 
corrective action (e.g., risk management decisions regarding resourcing, MAA adjustments, 
etc.). (T-1) 
5.6.5.  DELETED 
5.6.6.  Installation EP2T, the IEM, installation IGs, WIT/DIT personnel, and installation XP 
(where applicable) will reference paragraph 5.7 and paragraph 5.8 to include development 
of EM exercise common core capability evaluation objectives specified in Attachment 6. The 
planners and evaluators will account for and evaluate the applicable common core capability 
evaluation objectives specified in Attachment 6. (T-1) The IEM will provide desired learning 
objectives during exercise development which will inform and may be included in the MSEL 
for each exercise. 
5.7.  Installation Exercise Types.  The EM exercise types defined in Table 5.2 provide 
clarification and applicability to installation EM programs. 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023

Table 5.2.  Installation Exercise Types. 
Type 
Exercise Type Description 
Seminar 
Discussion-based exercise that presents overview of authorities, 
strategies, plans, policies, procedures, protocols, concepts, and ideas.  
Workshops 
Discussion-based exercise employed to develop and/or test strategy, 
policy, plans, or procedures.  
Tabletop 
Exercise (TTX) 
Discussion-based response to a scenario, intended to generate a 
dialogue to facilitate an understanding, identify strengths and areas for 
improvement, and/or change perceptions about plans, policies, or 
procedures. TTXs should identify where those plans need to be refined 
and identify resource management issues and capability gaps. Use of 
geospatial and computer-based modeling, simulation, and game 
environments to enhance discussions is highly encouraged.  
At a minimum, involve the ECC, IC, first and select emergency 
responders, EOC director, EOC section leads/SMEs, control centers, 
select WOC members, and Installation CP personnel. Includes scenario 
appropriate external mission partners (e.g., local first and emergency 
responders) to include specialized and support teams. 
Game 
Structured play designed to depict a situation to ensure participants 
make plausible decisions/actions; enhances training, team building, and 
capabilities.  
Drills 
Evaluates a single, specific function, or operation in a single unit or 
organization. Used to provide training, validate procedures, or practice 
and maintain current skills.  
Functional 
Exercise (FE) 
Evaluate individual capabilities, multiple functions, or interdependent 
groups of functions. FEs are typically focused on exercising plans, 
policies, procedures, and staff involved in management, direction, 
command, and control functions. Functional exercises feature tightly 
written MSELs so specific objectives can be met and the participation 
of supporting units would not be required. 
Full Scale 
Exercise (FSE) 
The type of exercise selected for evaluation. FSE events are projected 
through an exercise scenario with MSEL injects, that together with 
player action, drives activity at the operational level. FSEs are usually 
conducted in a real-time, stressful environment that is intended to 
mirror a real event. Personnel and resources are mobilized and 
deployed, and actions are performed as if a real event had occurred. 
The FSE simulates reality by presenting complex and realistic problems 
that require critical thinking, rapid problem solving, and effective 
responses by trained personnel. The result is an exercise that adds 
realism to the exercise scenario. The FSE, through EM exercise 
objectives, will test and evaluate installation EM mission areas and 
common core capabilities specified in Table 1.2 and Attachment 6. 
The primary means to advance whole-of-community EM mission areas 
and common core capabilities. At a minimum, involves the ECC, IC, 
First and select Emergency Responders. Includes activation of the 
70 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
EOC, control centers, and WOC to include participation by the CP and 
mission essential personnel in addition to the majority of base 
populace. Includes scenario appropriate external mission partners (e.g., 
local/host nation first and emergency responders, EOCs, and other 
mission partners) to include specialized and support teams.

6.1.  Purpose.  Deliver coordinated, prompt, reliable, and actionable information to the whole 
community using clear, consistent, accessible, and culturally and linguistically appropriate 
methods to effectively relay information regarding any threat or hazard and, as appropriate, the 
actions to take, actions being taken, and the assistance being made available. 
Section 6A—Emergency Public Information (EPI) 
6.2.  Concept.  Installation EM Programs support the development and dissemination of EPI to 
keep the protected populace informed before, during, and after an incident. 
6.3.  Overview. 
6.3.1.  Installation commander through their supporting public affairs office or equivalent will 
coordinate with the IEM to provide EPI. (T-1) 
6.3.2.  The CP will monitor rapid on-set all-hazard/threat incidents/attacks and ensure timely 
activation/execution of appropriate MWN. (T-0) 
6.3.3.  Public Affairs should provide the crisis communication planning and preparation IAW 
DAFI 35-101, Public Affairs Operations.  
6.4.  Emergency Public Information (EPI) Requirements. 
6.4.1.  Installation EPI will ensure accurate, reliable, and actionable information regarding all-
hazards/threats is available to Airmen, Guardians, DoD personnel, and the public. (T-0) 
6.4.2.  All means available should be used (e.g., including MWNS components, social media, 
television, commercial radio, media services, and similar systems) to communicate relevant, 
timely information with emergency response resources and stakeholders across the affected 
community, as appropriate. (T-1) Include all on and off-base agencies requiring support, to 
include swimming pools, golf courses, childcare centers, tenant units, etc. (T-1) 
6.4.3.  DELETED 
6.4.4.  Installations will include procedures for warning identified UVPs (e.g., personnel with 
disabilities including motor, sensory, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments). (T-1) Note:  
Due to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act constraints, the MEM should 
be the responsible person to identify affected populations of anyone with disabilities or 
requiring assistance. 
6.4.5.  Installations will develop procedures/systems to initiate alert notifications within two 
minutes of incident notification and verification and notify 100 percent of emergency essential 
(e.g., continuity of operations) to include first and emergency responder personnel within 10 
minutes of incident verification via the installation ECC, dispatch center, and/or the CP. (T-0) 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
75 
6.4.6.  The installation Public Affairs Officer (PAO) will coordinate with the IEM to develop 
written procedures for establishing, maintaining, and executing an EPI function. (T-1) 
Procedures for media management and communicating risk related to emergencies will be 
consistent with the Office of the Assistant SecDef, Public Affairs (OASD-PA) and the Office 
of the Chief of Public Affairs guidance, DAFI 35-101. 
6.4.7.  During catastrophic incidents, the installation PAO will include a central contact 
function (e.g., Joint Information Operations Center) for the media, pre-scripted information 
bulletins relevant to the installation’s identified hazards, a method to coordinate and clear 
information for release, the capability of communicating with special needs populations, and 
protective action guidelines and recommendations. (T-1) 
6.4.8.  Installations will use the standardized emergency preparedness awareness campaign 
training aids such as Emergency Notification Signals, Attack Warning Signals for CBRN 
Threat Areas, and Mission Oriented Protected Posture (MOPP). (T-2) These training aids are 
available through the IOEM. Installations should display these visual aids in common and high 
traffic areas. 
6.5.  Supporting Emergency Public Information (EPI) All-Hazard/Threat Advisory 
Sources.  Installations will identify and utilize valid and authoritative advisory source elements to 
generate EPI. At a minimum, use the following EPI elements. 
6.5.1.  Natural Hazard Warning Systems. These systems are addressed as part of the MWNS 
requirements in paragraph 6.8. 
6.5.2.  DoD Terrorist Threat-Level Classification System. Defense Intelligence Agency 
utilizes the threat-level classification system to identify the terrorist threat in a specified 
geographic area. Installation commanders should use this general threat-level as one basis for 
developing installation EPI regarding terrorism threats levels. Note:  Threat levels are 
estimates with no direct relationship to specific FP conditions (FPCON). 
6.5.3.  FPCONs. FPCONs are graduated categories of measures or actions that installation 
commanders will employ to protect personnel and assets from terrorism threats. Based upon 
factors such as anticipated changes in the threat, changes in the installation vulnerability, or 
guidance from HHQ, the installation commander may raise or lower FPCON levels. EM 
planning and procedures should be coordinated with applicable FPCON measures when 
applicable, such as with terrorism-specific guidance or actions. 
6.5.4.  Health Protection Conditions (HPCON). HPCONs are used during an all-hazards 
emergency to communicate specific, stratified health protection measures to the affected 
population. The determination to change the HPCON level is made by the installation 
commander consultation with the PHEO (PHEO-POC for ARC) and MTF commander and 
should be synchronized with the installation FPCON level and will be disseminated by the 
PAO. 
6.5.5.  Center for Disease Control. The PHEO and/or Public Health Officer (PHEO-POC for 
ARC) will monitor appropriate medical intelligence and surveillance, to include the Center for 
Disease Control website, to provide the PAO with current health information (e.g., health 
topics, traveler’s health, outbreaks, etc.). 
76 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
6.5.6.  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Emergency planning zones around each 
nuclear power plant within the U.S. in coordination with state and local EM agencies. 
Protective action guides, such as guides from the NRC, are available which describe the 
necessary local population actions in detail. See www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation.html for 
additional information. 
6.5.7.  Information Operations Conditions. Information operations conditions levels represent 
another hazard-specific threat-focused warning system, and resulting actions are the 
responsibility of the NRC. 
6.5.8.  DoS. International travel is often routine and part of daily life. Installation’s must be 
aware of travel advisors between countries and ensure the base populace is aware of any 
increased travel restrictions and/or regional threats. The DoS is the OPR for maintaining 
current 
information 
on 
international 
travel 
rules 
and 
warning. 
Reference 
https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html for additional information. 
Section 6B—Mass Warning and Notification (MWN) 
6.6.  Concept.  Installations utilize a MWNS (e.g., family of systems and processes approach) to 
maximize the ability to rapidly notify/warn personnel and provide elements of EPI. (T-1) 
6.7.  Overview.  The installation commander will ensure the installation has an MWNS capable 
of rapidly and effectively disseminating emergency information to warn all personnel according 
to timelines established in DoDI 6055.17. (T-0) 
6.8.  Mass Warning and Notification (MWN) Requirements.  Installations will develop MWN 
capabilities to rapidly warn and notify personnel in the event of an emergency/attack IAW DoDI 
6055.17; DoDI 2000.12, DoD Antiterrorism (AT) Program; DoDI 2000.16, Volume 1; NIMS; and 
National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 1600, Standard on Continuity, Emergency, and Crisis 
Management. (T-0)  
6.8.1.  Time Constraints. For rapid on-set hazards/threats, installations will develop MWN 
capabilities with the ability to disseminate warnings to the installation protected populace 
immediately, but no longer than two minutes after incident notification and command 
verification. Within 10 minutes after initiation, MWNS collectively, must reach a target 
audience of 90 percent or more of the protected population with specific protective action 
recommendations. (T-0) Reference DoDI 6055.17 for additional requirements. 
6.8.2.  Protective Action Recommendations. An effective warning will provide specific 
protective action recommendations. Protective action recommendations should be 
synchronized with prior IOEM provided E&T community awareness training or specify 
appropriate unique actions for the protected populace. 
6.8.3.  Warning Terminology. Effective warnings will use standard terminology and clearly 
communicate the immediacy, reliability, severity, and scope of the hazard and of the 
appropriate basic response. Installations in domestic locations will comply with DHS, FEMA, 
DoD Meteorology and Oceanography and/or the National Weather Service, the Emergency 
Alert System alerting terminology, methods, requirements, and capabilities. (T-1) 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023

6.10.5.  Supplement signals compatible with the local, national, host nation, or theater systems. 
Follow command and theater guidance when more than one system applies. (T-2) 
6.10.6.  Interior Building Notification Means. Use DoD-required individual building 
notification systems to disseminate EM information. Capabilities will be developed IAW UFC 
4-021-01, Design and Operations and Maintenance:  Mass Notification Systems. (T-0) New 
and renovated buildings will install a notification system to meet the DoD AT requirements in 
UFC 4-010-01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings. (T-0) Per UFC 4-010-
01, MWN capabilities are required in all new inhabited buildings since the FY04 construction 
program. MWN is required in existing primary gathering buildings and existing billeting when 
implementing a project exceeding the replacement cost threshold specified. (T-0) 
6.11.  Mass Warning and Notification System (MWNS) Preparedness, Readiness, and 
Evaluation. 
6.11.1.  Installations will test installation MWNS components IAW AFMAN 10-207, 
Command Posts, unless restricted by local or host nation ordinances. 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023

6.11.2.  Installations will develop, test, exercise, and evaluate an effective, timely, and multi-
modal warning coordination process to provide effective EPI and warning to the protected 
population, including tenant organizations. (T-2) 
6.11.3.  Installations should evaluate the ability of MWNS components to disseminate warning 
and ensure personnel can directly hear and/or see status changes. (T-2) 
6.11.4.  Installations will conduct warning coordination with their supporting military and 
civilian meteorology and/or weather service, geological survey (depending upon hazards), and 
other warning providers as a routine part of their duties on a no less than semiannual basis. 
(T-2) 
6.11.5.  CONUS locations will coordinate warning information with the designated authorities 
responsible for release of weather and non-weather emergency messages via the Integrated 
Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) to the greatest extent possible. (T-2) 
6.11.6.  CONUS locations will work with the city or county EM office to synchronize MWNS 
tests IAW DoDI 6055.17. (T-0) 
6.11.7.  CONUS installations will issue supplemental MWNS notifications in the event of a 
national emergency and an IPAWS is employed. (T-3) 
6.12.  Joint Information System (JIS) Requirements.  Installation, MAJCOM/FLDCOM, and 
HQ DAF PAOs (identified as Public Information Officers (PIO) via NIMS common terminology) 
will perform as key enablers for the DAF EM Program common core capability regarding EPI. 
(T-0) 
6.12.1.  Installation PAOs should be familiar with NIMS JIS concepts and be prepared to 
support and perform PAO related key functions identified in Table 6.3. 
Table 6.3.  Installation Public Affairs Officer (PAO) Key Function. 
Item 
Function 
1 
Identify timely and appropriate EPI elements and communicate to the public using the 
most effective means available. 
2 
Advise the IC/Unified Commander (UC), EOC director, and CP/WOC regarding 
public information matters relating to the management of the incident. 
3 
Monitor media and other sources of public information and transmit relevant 
information to the appropriate personnel at the incident, EOC, and/or multiagency 
coordination (MAC) group. 
4 
Handle inquiries from the media, the public, and elected officials; public information 
and warnings; rumor monitoring and response; media relations; and other functions 
needed to gather, verify, coordinate, disseminate accurate, accessible, and timely 
information to the installation populace. 
5 
Through collaboration with functional area SMEs (e.g., PHEO, Medical, Fire, 
Security Forces), gather information and inform the installation populace regarding 
public health, safety, and protection. 
6 
Verify accuracy of information released to the installation populace and public. 
7 
Provide support to and perform duties within the Joint Information Center (JIC). 
80 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
6.12.2.  Installation EM Programs must have procedures for integration with the JIS (or 
equivalent host nation concepts), including procedures to establish and maintain a JIC with 
partner agencies as the primary means of releasing EPI to the media. (T-0) 
6.12.3.  Information-Sharing Ground Rules. AFPD 33-3, Information Management, and DAFI 
35-101 implements DoDI 5400.14, Procedures for Joint Public Affairs Operations, by 
providing documentation for DAF interaction and participation with a JIC. Commanders will 
adhere to standard operations security, communications security, and guidelines for release of 
classified information, during incident responses. (T-0) 
6.12.4.  In coordination with local civil jurisdictions, installation commanders, through the 
installation PAO, will pre-identify a JIC site near the installation for establishment of a JIC. 
(T-0) 
6.12.5.  The preferable site for a JIC, to support joint and interagency staffing with local, state, 
federal, and other authorities, is outside the jurisdictional boundaries of the installation. 
Locating the JIC outside installation boundaries is necessary to preserve the adequate exchange 
of public information when and if the installation is closed to the public during an emergency. 
6.12.6.  At installations without full-time public affairs staffing, installation commanders will 
designate staff to provide this function and ensure appropriate training based upon guidance 
from HHQ. (T-0)

Chapter 7 
OPERATIONAL COMMAND AND COORDINATION 
7.1.  Purpose.  Execute and maintain DAF EM Program operational command and coordination 
capabilities to support unified and interoperable whole-of-nation to local and installation EM 
mission area execution through application and use of the NIMS. 
7.1.1.  Operational command and coordination relate to multi-jurisdictional collaboration for 
EM mission areas (prevent, protect, prepare, mitigate, respond, and recover) whereas 
DoD/DAF operational C2 pertains to the exercise of authority and direction by a properly 
designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission 
(e.g., joint and DAF doctrinal application of C2 for fires effects). 
7.1.2.  The requirements within this chapter are foundational towards information 
standardization to consolidate operational command and coordination into DAF EMIS. 
Section 7A—Overarching National Incident Management Construct 
7.2.  Concept Overview.  NIMS guides all domestic levels of government, nongovernmental 
organizations (NGO), and the private sector entities with the shared vocabulary, systems, and 
processes to work together to prevent, protect against, prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and 
recover from incidents. NIMS applies to all incidents, from traffic accidents, major disasters, to 
terrorist attacks. (T-0) Note:  NIMS principles relate to MCO and adversarial nation state CBRNE 
attack effects OCONUS; however, these threats are addressed primarily through joint/DAF 
doctrinal FP functions to include Joint METs/DAF METs and are outside the scope of NIMS. 
Reference DAFI 10-2503. 
7.3.  Overarching Operational Command and Coordination Requirements. 
7.3.1.  The DAF EM Program will utilize incident types, established within and through NIMS 
and the associated ICS, to relate incident size, scope, and/or complexity to resources needed. 
(T-0)

Example:  Minor Vehicle Accident and/or Injured Person 
Notes: 
1. All incident types have a certified and credentialed IC. Incident types are established by 
FEMA and U.S. Fire Administration as integral aspect to NIMS and ICS. 
2. Adversarial nation state CBRNE attacks at OCONUS locations relate to incident types; 
however, these attacks are addressed through joint/DAF doctrinal functions to include Joint 
METs/DAF METs and are outside the scope of NIMS incident types. Reference DAFI 10-
2503. 
7.3.2.  The tactical, operational, and strategic level DAF EM Program construct elements 
specified in Table 3.1 will plan for and use NIMS command and coordination structures to 
provide DSCA IAW DoDD 3025.18. (T-0) 
7.3.3.  Installation EM Programs will be consistent with NIMS (and the associated ICS) IAW 
HSPD-5, the Office of the Deputy SecDef Memorandum to implement NIMS, 29 November 
2005, and DHS NIMS doctrine (Third Edition). (T-0) Note:  For off-installation response and 
recovery operations, OCONUS installations follow the host nation SOFA. 
7.3.4.  Installations will develop a comprehensive, integrated EM Program to successfully 
manage Type 3-5 incidents through the coordinated application of organic and pre-coordinated 
external resources. (T-0) 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
83 
7.3.5.  Managing Type 1 and Type 2 incidents requires additional resources, capabilities, and 
expertise beyond those of a single DAF installation and are addressed through close 
interagency coordination with supporting local, state, federal, regional, or host nation 
governments and agencies across all levels of command. Note:  The term “consistent with 
NIMS” expresses that the DAF:  1) as a whole is primarily a warfighting force; 2) retains 
control of personnel regardless of mission, assignment, or function; and 3) DAF personnel are 
not provided under ICS as an independent resource to a civil jurisdiction, but rather as a strike 
team or task force resource under the leadership and authority of a DoD representative, whether 
a uniformed service member or DoD civilian. In this context, use of NIMS is focused on the 
installation/regional environment and not the DAF warfighting force as a whole. 
Section 7B—National Incident Management System (NIMS) Resource Management 
7.4.  Concept Overview.  Most jurisdictions do not own and maintain resources necessary to 
address all potential hazards/threats. Employment of NIMS resource management guidance 
enables military and civilian organizational elements to collaborate and coordinate and 
systematically identify and manage resources prior to, during, and after an incident. As such, this 
section presents DAF EM Program policy regarding use of NIMS resource management 
preparedness, resource management during an incident, and mutual aid. Note:  Reference NIMS 
for additional context. 
7.4.1.  EM Programs will use NIMS-based resource management concepts and processes to 
coordinate the identification, prioritization, and allocation of EM resources regarding multi-
jurisdictional response (specific NIMS resource elements are identified in Figure 7.1). (T-1) 
Reference DoDI 6055.17, for additional requirements. 
7.4.2.  DAF EMIS (or other EMIS applications employed) will include resource management 
processes and procedures consistent with NIMS resource management preparedness, resource 
management during an incident, and mutual aid information. (T-2) 
Figure 7.1.  National Incident Management System (NIMS) Resource Elements. 
 
7.5.  Resource Management Preparedness Requirements.  In support of homeland defense and 
as a key enabler of defense support to civil authorities, the DAF EM Program and domestic 
installations will utilize NIMS resource management preparedness processes. (T-1) 
7.5.1.  Based on local hazards/threats, installations will use resource management processes 
and procedures consistent with NIMS to pre-identify key resources needed for response and 
initial recovery as executed through ICS and EOC constructs. The process will accurately 
identify: (1) what and how much is needed, (2) where and when it is needed, and (3) who will 
be receiving or using the resource(s). (T-1) 
84 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
7.5.2.  Installations will implement local procedures to identify, locate, acquire, store, 
distribute, maintain, test, and account for emergency related services, personnel, teams, 
resources, materials, and facilities. (T-1) 
7.5.3.  Installations should develop an Installation Resource Inventory System or, preferably, 
utilize the FEMA Resource Inventory System (RIS). Note:  The FEMA RIS is a centralized, 
secure, and cloud hosted resource inventory solution to increase resource data sharing (view 
only) across organizations to support preparedness, planning, and response. 
7.5.3.1.  For key installation resource elements identified, installation inventory entries will 
be consistent with NIMS resource typing definitions (RTD) and national qualification 
system (NQS). (T-1) 
7.5.3.2.  Installations will establish procedures for functional areas to nominate and 
approve resources prior to uploading into the FEMA RIS or installation-developed resource 
inventory system. (T-1) Consider using the EMWG or EP2T as the approval authority. 
7.5.3.3.  Installation functional areas are responsible for entering resources available for 
deployment under NIMS/multi-jurisdictional response into inventory systems. 
7.5.3.4.  The resource data will be made available to the installation ECC/dispatch center 
and EOC. Functional areas are responsible for resource and financial aspects related to life 
cycle management of assigned resources and this responsibility will not be transferred to 
EM Programs. (T-1) 
7.5.3.5.  The EP2T, through the IOEM, will consolidate resource inventory entries and 
present to the EMWG on at least an annual basis to ensure senior leader visibility regarding 
resources postured in support of multi-jurisdictional response. (T-1) 
7.5.3.6.  Within the ICS, personnel assigned to the Logistics Section position(s) will be 
familiar with RTDs, the resource inventory system, and/or the FEMA RIS as to quickly 
translate local community requests for support/services and dispatch the resource. (T-1) 
7.5.4.  AFIMSC will provide NIMS resource management preparedness reachback-support 
and functional expertise to the IOEMs. (T-1) 
7.6.  Resource Typing Requirements.  Installations will identify and align key response and 
initial recovery resource elements with NIMS RTDs. (T-1) For context, a resource “Type” 
expresses the level of minimum capability to perform its function and relates to incident types 
defined in Table 7.1. A Type 1 resource represents a higher capability than Type 2, which 
represents a higher capability than Type 3 and so on. The level of capability depends on size, 
power, and capacity (for equipment) or experience and qualifications (for personnel and teams). 
7.6.1.  Installations should prioritize application of RTDs and NQS standards for first and 
emergency responders and applicable specialized response/recovery teams/assets that are 
widely used/deployable across jurisdictional boundaries through mutual aid/support 
agreements or contracts. Include considerations for unique installation mass care and 
transportation/evacuation core capability assets. The intent of this policy is to enable the 
installation ECC, IC, and/or the EOC and local mission partners to have a shared understanding 
of the capabilities and functions of each resource and can quickly and accurately share 
resources when necessary. 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
85 
7.6.2.  Generally, RTDs are applicable to teams, equipment, facilities, supplies, and personnel 
while NQS position qualifications are applicable to personnel. For instance, a HAZMAT 
response team and associated equipment has a RTD and the individual filling a position on the 
HAZMAT team has an applicable NQS position qualification. 
7.7.  Qualification, Certification, and Credentialing Requirements.  The intent of NQS is to 
ensure personnel representing various jurisdictional levels and functional disciplines possess a 
minimum common level of training, currency, experience, and physical and medical fitness to 
support the position they are tasked to fill as it relates to incident management and emergency 
responder capabilities. 
7.7.1.  Incident response personnel will maintain qualifications, certifications, and credentials 
consistent with NIMS and the NQS. (T-1) Incident response personnel deploying through 
mutual aid agreements will have the knowledge, experience, training, and capability to perform 
the duties of their assigned roles. (T-1) In addition, personnel deploying outside of existing 
support agreements under immediate response authority of DoDD 3025.18 (imminently 
serious conditions) are qualified, certified, and credentialed consistent with NIMS and the 
NQS. 
7.7.2.  First and emergency responder CFMs are encouraged to align AFSC CFETP to reflect 
NQS and related qualification and certification for the most likely ICS position the AFSC will 
fill during incident response. 
7.7.3.  Qualification procedures should specify the process through which personnel meet the 
minimum established criteria—training, experience, physical and medical fitness, and 
capability—to fill specific ICS positions. 
7.7.4.  Certification/Recertification procedures will include methodology to document an 
individual has met and continues to meet established criteria and is qualified for a specific 
position. (T-1) 
7.7.5.  Credentialing. Credentialing procedures will be aligned with existing installation access 
control policy that identifies personnel and authenticates and verifies their qualification for a 
particular position. (T-0) Credentialing should be done during the planning phase. 
7.7.6.  DELETED 
7.8.  Planning for Resources Requirements.  Resource planning will include identifying 
resource requirements based on the hazards/threats to, and vulnerabilities of, the installation and 
the overarching local community and include alternative strategies to obtain needed resources. 
(T-1) 
7.8.1.  Resource planning should consider resources necessary to support all mission areas and 
related common core capabilities available throughout the multi-jurisdictional area. 
7.8.2.  The IOEM will coordinate with local mission partners (e.g., LEPCs) to develop plans 
for identifying, managing, estimating, allocating, ordering, deploying, and demobilizing 
resources. (T-1) Resource planning between the installation and external stakeholders should 
clearly identify available capabilities and how they are shared. 
 
 
86 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
7.8.3.  Mission partner coordination activities should answer what to prepare for, the resources 
available to achieve shared common core capability targets, and resources that can be obtained 
and/or shared through mutual aid to be prepared to meet individual or multi-jurisdictional 
common core capability targets. 
7.8.4.  Resource management strategies to consider include stockpiling resources; establishing 
mutual aid agreements to obtain resources from neighboring jurisdictions; determining how 
and where to reassign existing resources from non-essential tasks; and/or developing contracts 
to acquire resources from vendors rapidly when needed. 
7.9.  Requirements for Resource Management During an Incident (RMDI).  During multi-
jurisdictional response, installations will use the NIMS RMDI processes that includes standard 
methods to identify, order, mobilize, and track resources as summarized in Table 7.2 (T-1) Note:  
In some cases, the identification and ordering process is compressed, such as when an IC identifies 
the specific resources necessary for a given task and orders those resources directly. However, in 
larger, more complex incidents (e.g., Type 3 and higher), the IC relies on the resource management 
process within EOCs to identify and meet resource needs. 
Table 7.2.  Resource Management During an Incident (RMDI) Process. 
Step & Action 
Remarks 
1 
Identify 
Requirements 
The IC, EOC, and supporting control centers should coordinate as early 
as possible, both in advance of and during incidents to identify 
resources needed in support of response and initial recovery. 
2 
Order and Acquire 
Incident and/or EOC personnel request resources based on incident 
priorities and objectives. When applicable, consider the resource 
demands of other incidents. The organization providing resources will 
consent to the request and communicate discrepancies between 
requested resources and those available for delivery. 
3 
Mobilize1 
Conduct incident specific deployment planning to include just-in-time 
training, incident site reporting instructions for teams/crews, 
designating assembly points, and delivery schedules. 
4 
Track and Report 
Prepare to receive and/or use resources and track resource location(s) to 
facilitate the safety and security of personnel, equipment, teams, and 
facilities through effective resource coordination and movement. 
5 
Demobilize 
Ensure orderly, safe, and efficient return of a resource to its original 
location and status; planning and logistics functions collaborate to plan 
how resources are rehabilitated, replenished, disposed of, and/or 
returned or restored to operational condition. 
6 
Reimburse and 
Restock 
Payment of expenses incurred by resource providers for specific 
activities. Reimbursement processes include mechanisms for collecting 
bills, validating costs against the scope of the work, and replacing or 
repairing damaged equipment. Reimbursement procedures are often 
specified in mutual aid and assistance agreements. 
Note:  Mobilizing fixed facility resources, such as hospitals, EOCs, and shelters involves 
activation rather than deployment. Plans and systems to monitor resource mobilization status 
should be flexible enough to adapt to both types of resources.

7.10.  Mutual Aid Requirements.  Installation commanders will develop resource management 
objectives and processes IAW DoDI 6055.17, DoDI 3020.52, DoDI 6200.03, and AFI 10-801. 
(T-0) 
7.10.1.  Installation commanders will develop and establish MAAs that address resources and 
partnership arrangements essential to the EM Program. (T-1) 
7.10.2.  The installation staff judge advocate will review all EM related MAAs for legal 
sufficiency and considerations. (T-1) 
7.10.3.  The EMWG should annually review all EM related MAAs IAW DoDI 4000.19, 
Support Agreements and AFI 25-201, Intra-Service, Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support 
Agreements Procedures. 
7.10.4.  For anticipated incident Type 4 and/or Type 5 response related resources, the unit 
commander that provides first and emergency responder capabilities/resources should develop 
and/or monitor effectiveness of existing MAAs on a reoccurring basis. 
7.10.5.  For anticipated incident Type 1, 2, or 3 response and initial recovery, the IEM, through 
the EMWG and the EP2T, should coordinate development and/or monitor effectiveness of 
existing MAAs on at least an annual basis. 
7.10.6.  Mutual aid should address participating entities’ liability, compensation, and 
procedures, and include topics presented in Table 7.3. 
Table 7.3.  Recommended Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA) Topics.

Section 7C—National Incident Management System (NIMS) Management Characteristics 
and the Incident Command System (ICS) 
7.11.  Concept Overview.  The command and coordination component of NIMS describes the 
systems, principles, and structures that provide a standard, national to local level framework for 
incident management. This section presents DAF EM Program policy regarding application of 
NIMS management characteristics and the ICS. The interconnected EOC organizational structure, 
MAC group, joint information system (JIS), and interconnectivity of tactical to strategic NIMS 
command and coordination structures are addressed in subsequent sections within this chapter. 
7.12.  National Incident Management System (NIMS) Management Characteristics.  All 
levels of EM Programs (installation to DAF) will account for NIMS management characteristics 
outlined in Table 7.4 and expanded upon in NIMS doctrine to include DoDI 6055.17. (T-1) 
Table 7.4.  Emergency Management (EM) Program Employment of the National Incident 
Management System (NIMS) Management Characteristics. 
Characteristics 
Remarks 
Common Terms 
Organizational functions with incident responsibilities are named and 
defined. Major resource descriptions are given common names and 
are typed to help avoid confusion and enhance interoperability. 
Incident support facilities/areas use common terminology. 
Modular 
Establishing and expanding ICS organizations on and off the incident 
site. 
Management by 
Objectives 
The IC or unified command (UC) establishes objectives that drive 
incident operations. 
Incident Action 
Planning 
The necessity for written plans depends on incident complexity, 
command decisions, and legal requirements. Formal IAPs are not 
always developed for the initial operational period of no-notice 
incidents. However, if an incident is likely to extend beyond one 
operational period, becomes more complex, or involves multiple 
jurisdictions and/or agencies, preparing a written. IAP becomes 
increasingly important to maintain unity of effort and effective, 
efficient, and safe operations. 
Span of Control 
The type of incident, nature of the task, hazards and safety factors, 
experience of the supervisor and subordinates, and communication 
access between the subordinates and the supervisor are all factors that 
influence manageable span of control. 
Incident Facilities and 
Locations 
Typical facilities, with common terminology, include the CP, 
incident base, staging areas, camps, mass casualty triage areas, 
points-of distribution, and emergency shelters. 
Comprehensive 
Resource 
Management 
Resources include personnel, equipment, teams, supplies, and 
facilities available or potentially available for assignment or 
allocation as described in Section 7B. 
Integrated 
Communications 
Incident level and in EOC communicate through the development 
and use of a common communications plan, interoperable 
communications processes, and systems that include voice and data 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
89 
links. 
Establishment and 
Transfer of 
Command1 
Clearly establish the command function at the beginning of an 
incident. The jurisdiction or organization with primary responsibility 
for the incident designates the individual at the scene responsible for 
establishing command and protocol for transferring command. 
UC 
UC manages the incident by jointly approved objectives. 
Chain of Command 
and Unity of 
Command 
Orderly line of authority within the ranks of the incident management 
organization. 
Accountability 
Effective accountability for resources during an incident is essential. 
Incident personnel should adhere to principles of accountability, 
including check-in/check-out, IAP, unity of command, personal 
responsibility, span of control, and resource tracking. 
Dispatch/Deployment 
Resources should deploy only when appropriate authorities request 
and dispatch them through established resource management systems. 
Information and 
Intelligence 
Management2 
The incident management organization establishes a process for 
gathering, analyzing, assessing, sharing, and managing incident-
related information and intelligence. 
Notes: 
1. This characteristic relates to ICS and not the DoD concepts of “command” and “unity of 
command” that have distinct legal meanings for military forces and operations. 
2. In NIMS, “intelligence” refers exclusively to threat-related information developed by law 
enforcement, medical surveillance, and other investigative organizations. 
7.13.  Incident Action Plan (IAP), Incident Command System (ICS) Forms, and Operational 
Period Requirements. 
7.13.1.  IAP. ICs, through the ICS staff, will generate an oral or written IAP plan containing 
general objectives reflecting the overall strategy for managing an incident. (T-1) The IC will 
determine if a written IAP is required based on incident type complexity as specified in Table 
7.1, except for HAZMAT incidents, which requires a written IAP. Note:  An incident involving 
a nuclear weapon/material in DoD custody requires additional requirements as specified in 
DoDD 3150.08 and DoDI 3150.10. 
7.13.1.1.  The IC will ensure IAPs provide a coherent means of communicating the overall 
incident objectives in the context of both operational and support activities. The IAP should 
include the identification of operational resources and assignments and may include 
attachments that provide additional direction. 
7.13.1.2.  An IAP will enable tactical operations to be achieved based upon established 
principles and reflect a time-based operational period. 
7.13.1.3.  IAPs will be developed IAW NIMS and applicable incident-specific guidance. 
Use of the supporting ICS forms is required. 
7.13.2.  ICS Forms. The IC and ICS staff will have access to and utilize standard ICS forms. 
While the format and content are flexible, the form number and purpose should remain intact 
to maintain consistency, facilitate immediate identification and interoperability, and simplify 
use. 
90 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
7.13.2.1.  ICS Forms will be integrated into the installation COP for the creation of the 
IAP. (T-1) Installations located OCONUS will utilize ICS Forms to the greatest extent 
possible. (T-3) Reference the NIMS ICS Forms Booklet, FEMA 502-2, for a complete 
listing of forms. 
7.13.2.2.  The EOC manager will send the General Message (ICS Form 213) or required 
form content to their respective MAJCOM/FLDCOM CFM and AFIMSC Detachment 
within 24-hours via ARIS. (T-1) 
7.13.2.3.  The IAP normally consists of the Incident Objectives (ICS Form 202), 
Organization Assignment List (ICS Form 203), an Assignment List (ICS Form 204) for 
each division/group on the incident, and a map of the incident area. Larger incidents 
necessitate additional supporting attachments, such as a separate Incident Radio 
Communications Plan (ICS Form 205), a Medical Plan (ICS Form 206), and a Meeting 
Schedule (ICS Form 230). Note:  Not all ICS forms are included in the IAP, some support 
the planning process or incident operations in other ways. 
7.13.3.  Operational Periods. The IC and ICS Staff should use professional judgement to 
determine the appropriate operation periods. The IC should consider a 12-hour operational 
period as an effective planning cycle for efficient response to technological hazards and 
terrorism incidents. Shorter or longer operational periods may be necessary for natural hazards 
and special events with specific time windows. ICs will use the operational period planning 
cycle defined in NIMS for complex multi-jurisdictional response incidents. 
7.14.  Incident Command System (ICS) On-Scene Requirements. 
7.14.1.  Installations will employ and use the ICS for on-scene incident management to include 
the UC concept, as needed, and as described in NIMS. (T-1) Installations in foreign countries 
should collaborate with host nation mission partners and apply NIMS ICS principles while 
accounting for host nation equivalent incident command concepts. 
7.14.2.  Installation application of ICS (incident command and UC constructs) will include five 
major functional areas, staffed as needed and determined by the IC or UC construct consisting 
of command, operations, planning, logistics, and finance/administration as illustrated in 
Figure 7.2. (T-1) 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
91 
Figure 7.2.  Example Incident Command System (ICS) Organization with a Single Incident 
Commander (IC). 
 
7.14.3.  IC and UC. The initial first responder will assume command. A formal transfer of 
command to the senior fire officer will occur for any incident involving two or more agencies. 
(T-0) The senior fire officer will assume and serve as the IC until the scene is rendered safe 
and recovery operations may begin. (T-0) The IC must be qualified, trained, and certified 
individual with experience in the given type of emergency. (T-0) 
7.14.3.1.  For sudden on-set incidents within installation jurisdictional boundaries and 
without jurisdictional or functional agency overlap, the senior DoD first responder to arrive 
on scene will be the IC (e.g., vehicle accident). (T-1) Incident command will be transferred 
to a more senior and/or qualified first responder as he or she arrives on-scene. (T-1) The 
EOC will document each succession of IC transfer. (T-1) 
7.14.3.2.  Assignment as the IC for a specific incident is based upon qualifications, 
experience, and certification in addition to successful completion of the required training 
specified in paragraph 5.4 and Attachment 5 at a minimum. Example IC assignment 
criteria for the installation IC are described below. 
7.14.3.2.1.  DELETED 
7.14.3.2.2.  For environmental oil and hazardous substance spill response, the initial IC 
is the senior fire officer certified as HAZMAT IC. Once the release is secured, the IC 
may transfer to the appropriate environmental SME. ICs must have completed required 
training prior to appointment as the IC. (T-0) 
 
 
92 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
7.14.3.2.3.  For law enforcement related incidents, such as active shooters, barricaded 
suspect, and hostage situations, the initial IC is the senior security forces official. A 
formal transfer of command will occur once a senior fire officer arrives on the scene 
who will assume command and serve as the IC. The senior security forces official will 
assume the role of the Operations Section Chief to focus on continued tactical actions 
to render the scene safe from hostilities. 
7.14.3.2.4.  For public works incidents, such as infrastructure failure not involving 
release of HAZMAT, trench collapse, or high energy shock risk, the IC may be the 
senior civil engineer/public works official. 
7.14.3.2.5.  For covert incidents or incidents with gradual or slow onset and no defined 
incident scene, the IC may be the installation commander or designated representative. 
7.14.3.2.6.  In incidents regarding broad biological terrorism or other public health 
emergencies, including disease outbreaks, the IC should support the installation 
PHEM-IL, or designated representative from medical commander. For incidents 
specifically impacting operations within a facility or work center (e.g., targeted threats), 
the initial IC is the senior fire officer certified as HAZMAT IC. Once the specific risk 
or hazard is mitigated, the IC may transfer to the appropriate designated SME. (T-0) 
7.14.3.2.7.  A DoD/DAF military or civilian member may serve as the IC at an incident 
off a military installation based on provisions within existing MAAs with that 
jurisdiction, if applicable, or through agreement at the scene by the respective 
jurisdiction’s senior authorities of the responding agencies. A major accident involving 
military assets, or an incident declared a National Defense Area by the appropriate 
authority will be established and managed by the closest responding DoD/DAF entity, 
as appropriate. (T-1) 
7.14.4.  Command Staff. The IC or UC will assign command staff as needed to support the 
command function. The command staff typically includes a PAO (identified as public 
information officer [PIO] via NIMS common terminology), a safety officer, and a liaison 
officer (LNO) who report directly to the IC or UC and have assistants as necessary. (T-0) The 
IC or UC may appoint additional advisors as needed. 
7.14.4.1.  PAO. The installation PAO will provide on-scene support to the IC or UC 
construct as needed. (T-1) The PAO interfaces with the public, media, and/or with other 
agencies with incident-related information needs. The PAO gathers, verifies, coordinates, 
and disseminates accessible, meaningful, and timely information on the incident for both 
internal and external audiences. 
7.14.4.2.  Safety Officer. The safety officer monitors incident operations and advises the 
IC or UC on matters relating to the health and safety of incident personnel. The safety 
officer should be a first and/or emergency responder with KSAs pertaining to incident 
operational aspects to include hazards/threats. 
7.14.4.3.  Liaison Officer. The LNO is the incident command’s POC for representatives of 
governmental agencies, jurisdictions, NGO, and private sector organizations that are not 
included in the UC. 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
93 
7.14.5.  General Staff. The IC or UC will assign general staff as needed to support incident 
response. The general staff will consist of the operations, planning, logistics, and 
finance/administration section chiefs. These individuals will be responsible for the functional 
aspects of the incident command structure. Note:  General staff functions default to the IC or 
UC until a section chief is assigned. 
7.14.5.1.  Operations Section. Key functions should include directing the management of 
tactical activities on the IC or UC’s behalf; developing and implementing strategies and 
tactics to achieve incident objectives; organizing the operations section to best meet the 
incident’s needs, maintaining a manageable span of control, and optimize the use of 
resources; and supporting IAP development for each operational period. 
7.14.5.2.  Planning Section. Key functions should include facilitating incident planning 
meetings; recording the status of resources and anticipated resource needs; collecting, 
organizing, displaying, and disseminating incident status information and analyzing the 
situation as it changes; planning for the orderly, safe, and efficient demobilization of 
incident resources; and collecting, recording, and safeguarding all incident documents. 
7.14.5.3.  Logistics Section. Key functions should include ordering, receiving, 
storing/housing, 
and 
processing 
incident-related 
resources; 
providing 
ground 
transportation during an incident, maintaining and supplying vehicles, keeping vehicle 
usage records, and developing incident traffic plans; setting up, maintaining, securing, and 
demobilizing incident facilities; determining food and water needs, including ordering 
food, providing cooking facilities, maintaining food service areas, and managing food 
security and safety (in cooperation with the safety officer); maintaining an incident 
Communications Plan and acquiring, setting up, issuing, maintaining, and accounting for 
communications and IT equipment; and providing medical services to incident personnel. 
7.14.5.4.  Finance/Administration Section. Key functions should include tracking costs, 
analyzing cost data, making estimates, and recommending cost savings measures; 
analyzing, reporting, and recording financial concerns resulting from property damage, 
responder injuries or fatalities at the incident; managing financial matters concerning leases 
and vendor contracts; managing administrative databases and spreadsheets for analysis and 
decision making; and recording time for incident personnel and leased equipment. 
7.14.5.5.  Intelligence/Investigation Function. The IC or UC should opt to reconfigure 
intelligence and investigations responsibilities to meet the needs of the incident to ensure 
that intelligence and investigative operations and activities are properly managed and 
coordinated. Key activities should include actions to prevent and/or deter potential 
unlawful activity, incidents, and/or attacks; collect, process, analyze, secure, and 
disseminate information, intelligence, and situational awareness with specific attention to 
WMD/CBRN threats; and identify, document, process, collect, create a chain of custody 
for, safeguard, examine and analyze, and store evidence or specimens. Note:  Particular 
attention should address the safety and security of all response personnel, by helping to 
prevent future attacks or escalated impacts; and determine the source or cause of an 
ongoing incident (e.g., disease outbreak, fire, complex coordinated attack, or cyber 
incident) to control its impact and/or help prevent the occurrence of similar incidents.

DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
7.14.6.  Types of ICS Support Facilities/Areas. The IC or UC will determine the need for and 
should establish facilities in and around the incident area to house or support incident 
management functions. (T-0) The IC or UC determines the kinds and locations of facilities 
based on incident needs with support from EOC(s) as summarized in Figure 7.3. Note:  The 
DAF EM Program will adopt these standardized terms/icons as a pivotal geospatial situational 
awareness capability regarding multi-jurisdictional response activities. 
Figure 7.3.  Types of Incident Command System (ICS) Facilities and Associated Functions. 
 
7.15.  Incident Complex – Multiple Incidents.  Installations will account for ICS procedures to 
form an incident complex over two or more individual incidents located in the same general area 
through a single IC or a UC. (T-0) When relevant authorities establish an incident complex over 
several incidents, those incidents will become branches or divisions within the incident complex 
operations section. 
7.16.  Area Command.  Installations will account for use of an area command to oversee multiple 
concurrent incidents or a very complex incident that requires the establishment of multiple ICS 
organizations as summarized in Figure 7.4. (T-0) Key responsibilities of the area command should 
include developing broad objectives for the affected area; coordinating development of incident 
objectives and strategies for each incident; allocating or reallocating resources as priorities change; 
and prioritizing needs for scarce resources. Note:  Multiple EOCs from various jurisdictions will 
likely need to coordinate the resource needs.

7.19.1.  Installations will implement a flexible EOC organizational design compatible with 
NIMS (T-0) Note:  The use of emergency support functions; finance, logistics, operations, and 
planning; or a hybrid system based on staff organization and functions is permitted (e.g., A-
Staff and USSF equivalent). For more information on A-Staff, reference AFDP 3-30, 
Command and Control¸ Appendix C:  The Air Forces (AFFOR) Staff. 
7.19.1.1.  The 
EOC 
construct 
should 
generate 
interoperability 
with 
incident 
response/recovery mission partners while simultaneously promoting interoperability 
installation C2 functions, Numbered Air Forces (NAF), MAJCOMs/FLDCOMs, 
Component HQs, joint partners, and coalition partners. 
7.19.1.2.  The EOC construct should increase synchronization for crisis and contested 
conditions via a “train as you fight” approach while preparing Airmen and Guardians for 
integration with joint battlespace partners to include streamlining decision-making and 
responsiveness.

commander, deputy, or CoS (if appointed) that coordinates, prioritizes, and promulgates 
installation direction for steady state and crisis action activities. 
7.19.2.  The installation EOC will be organized based on paragraph 7.19.1 and ensure: 
7.19.2.1.  The EOC will use the common NIMS/ICS terms for sections and branches to 
help enable interoperability for multi-jurisdictional response mission partners. (T-0) 
7.19.2.2.  The EOC construct will include application and assignment of flexible 
emergency support functions, SME branches (e.g., comptroller support branch, CBRN 
defense/cell support branch, security support branch, force support branch, logistics 
readiness branch, etc.), or staff organization based on incident needs. (T-1) 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
97 
7.19.2.3.  AFIMSC will account for the described EOC construct and adjust the IEMP 10-
2 planning tool, training course content, and other DAF EM Program execution support 
products. (T-1) 
7.19.2.4.  AFIMSC will implement cross functional EOC E&T requirements to include 
FEMA’s National Integration Center’s NIMS EOC Skillsets. This NQS enables the 
components of a qualification and certification system, defines a process for certifying the 
qualifications of incident personnel, describes how to stand up and implement a peer 
review process, and provides an introduction to the process of credentialing personnel. 
7.20.  Installation Emergency Operation Center (EOC) Formation Aspects.  The installation 
EOC will be task-organized from existing resources and tailored to the incident and the IC/UC 
needs to include operational mission requirements. (T-0) 
7.20.1.  The installation EOC director for each EOC shift will be predesignated, in writing, by 
the installation commander and will be responsible to the installation commander for all EOC 
operations. (T-1) 
7.20.2.  The installation EOC will be staffed by representatives from command directorates, 
assigned functional areas, and LNOs from appropriate tenant organizations, units, and local, 
state, federal, tribal, NGO/Faith Based Organizations, and private (or host nation) as 
determined by the EOC director and based on incident needs. (T-0) 
7.20.3.  The installation EOC staff will be trained, exercised, and evaluated as detailed in 
Chapter 5 and Attachment 5. Installation EOC teams will be typed through the resource 
typing system. (T-0) 
7.20.4.  Personnel assignments should be by EOC position title, squadron/unit/tenant 
affiliation, and individual names (vice only individual assigned to the “EOC”). Regardless of 
personnel assignment methodology, the EOC must include a chain of succession for both 
sustained operations and times when the primary individual is unavailable. (T-1) 
7.21.  Installation Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Staffing.  The installation EOC staff 
will consist of SMEs aligned within various sections prepared to execute timely and appropriate 
common core capabilities. (T-0) 
7.21.1.  EOC Director (and Management Staff). The EOC director, through coordination with 
all sections, should set EOC objectives and tasks, integrate stakeholders, work with senior 
officials to facilitate the development of policy direction for incident support, and ensure the 
dissemination of timely, accurate, and accessible information to the public. 
7.21.1.1.  The EOC management staff should include a PAO (e.g., PIO) and may include 
others such as a legal advisor and a safety officer depending on the size, scope, and 
complexity of the incident. 
7.21.1.2.  Based on incident support needs, the EOC director should determine the need for 
additional management staff positions, identify and appoint functional area 
personnel/SMEs to lead sections, and align functional SMEs to fill branch positions. 
7.21.1.3.  The EOC director should be responsible for timely and appropriate execution of 
all common core capabilities pertaining to the incident to include specific common core 
capabilities identified in Table 7.5. 
98 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
7.21.2.  EOC Staff. The EOC staff will focus on: 
7.21.2.1.  Financial, administrative, and cost analysis aspects of the incidents to include 
tracking expenditures, provision of resources, personnel accountability, and administrative 
support. 
7.21.2.2.  Situational awareness which includes the operability of the installation COP, 
collaboration internally with other EOC sections and external incident support (on-scene 
command, civilian EOCs, mission partners, host nation, etc.), provide warning and 
reporting regarding MCOs, provide communications capabilities and technology support. 
7.21.2.3.  Provide support to on-scene response personnel within their respective functions. 
Functional areas should coordinate to address resource needs, request for information, and 
request for support. 
7.21.2.4.  Monitor and account for cascading impacts to lifelines and coordinate with 
internal and external EOCs to stabilize lifelines (safety and security; food, water, shelter, 
health and medical; energy (power and fuel); communications; transportation; and 
HAZMAT response). 
7.21.2.5.  Determine damage to installation resources, facilities, and infrastructure. Provide 
the EOC director with a recommended prioritized listing of initial facility/infrastructure 
stabilization to address life safety issues and operational mission restoration. The EOC 
director should coordinate with the installation commander (or WOC) to approve the 
prioritization of initial stabilization/repair actions as to account for operational mission 
generation priorities. 
7.21.2.6.  Source, request/order, and track all resources. This includes supplies, equipment, 
and personnel acquired from departments and agencies represented in the EOC, other 
community organizations, mutual aid/EMAC sources, or nongovernmental partners, as 
well as items purchased or leased. This staff will coordinate closely with the finance and 
administration section to ensure accurate accounting of resource expenditures. 
7.21.2.7.  Execute timely and appropriate common core capabilities identified in Table 7.5. 
7.21.3.  Planning. Multiple functions/staffs within the EOC should be tasked to facilitate a 
standard planning process to achieve the EOC objectives and provide a range of current and 
future planning services to address current needs and anticipate and devise the means to deal 
with future needs. The staff should: 
7.21.3.1.  Assist in developing the shared goals of multiple jurisdictions and organizations 
involved in managing the incident and coordinate a standard planning process to achieve 
the objectives of the EOC leadership and foster unity of effort among all organizations 
represented in the center. 
7.21.3.2.  Work closely with personnel in the ICS Planning Section and/or other EOCs to 
collect, analyze, and disseminate incident and incident-related information, including

7.24.  Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Recall Requirements.  Installations will establish 
a continuous 24-hour/7-days a week/365-days per year designated EOC recall center, typically 
through the dispatch center/ECC or CP. (T-0) Nothing within the EM Program requires a 24-hour, 
continual watch within the installation EOC. The designated EOC recall center will establish 
effective procedures to receive and transmit recall of the EOC staff. (T-0) 
7.25.  Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Activation Levels.  Installation EOCs will employ 
a tiered activation concept consisting of three activation levels IAW NIMS. (T-1) The IC, EOC 
director, and/or installation commander will determine the level of activation for EOCs. (T-3) 
Though an immediate increase from activation level 3 (normal) directly to activation level 1 (full 
activation) may be warranted in sudden onset incidents, gradual and slow onset hazards will 
require the capability for transitional activation moving steadily up or down the scale. Installation 
EM Programs will adopt these activation levels for their installation EOCs and include the 
appropriate level of detail to support this concept within their IEMP 10-2. (T-1) Note:  These 
policy requirements and standards will provide the means to roll-up installation EOC activation 
status into overarching information systems in support of DAF wide EM situational awareness. 
7.25.1.  Activation Level 3 (Normal/ Steady-State). No emergency incident exists sufficient to 
warrant activation of the installation EOC. Activation level normal may include support of 
installation EMWG meetings, commander briefings, and threat working group or AT Working 
Group (ATWG) meetings. 
7.25.2.  Activation Level 2 (Enhanced Steady-State/Partial Activation). Certain EOC team 
members/organizations are activated to monitor a credible threat, risk, or hazard and/or to 
support the response to a new and potentially evolving incident, to include large-scale events. 
EOC members are simply notified of indications and warnings as to increase situational 
awareness. There is no EM Program requirement for a 24/7 watch officer during Activation 
level 2. Typical actions include reviewing and updating applicable SOPs, conducting 
operational checks, updating maps and Geographic Information System information, and 
updating resource availability information, additional planning, and coordination support, 
including some specialized assistance from members of the installation EOC team and/or threat 
working group. Typical causes for initiation and sustainment of Activation level 2 include 
bomb threats, biological threat warning, potential public health emergency, preliminary 
laboratory results indicative of a potential biological incident (terrorism or natural causes), 
special events, active hurricane warnings/watches posted 96-48 hours prior to landfall, and 
similar incidents. 
7.25.3.  Activation Level 1 (Full Activation). Potential or actual emergency condition(s) exist 
sufficient to warrant full activation of the installation EOC. Activation level 1 results in 24/7 
situational awareness with establishment of defined operational period and associated reports. 
The installation EOC team establishes all organizational sections, establishes communications, 
and initiates coordination with appropriate local, state, federal, tribal, other Service, and/or 
private (or host nation) counterparts, begins information management support, including 
establishment of a JIC, determines the current status of all response and recovery resources, 
and initiates resource management support for the IC. Typical causes for initiation and 
sustainment of Activation level 1 include any evacuation, incidents having limited/partial  
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
103 
impact on some or all of a population (for example, flooding, winter storms), landfall of 
tropical storms, expected landfall of hurricanes (within 24-36 hours), earthquake, tsunami 
warning, tornados, sudden onset terrorism incident, moderate- to large-scale HAZMAT 
spill/release involving mutual aid or environmental spill response, all nuclear-related incidents, 
confirmed biological incident (terrorism or natural causes), wide-scale power blackouts, and 
similar incidents. 
7.25.4.  Installation EOC Capability Requirements. Installation EOCs will have fundamental 
capabilities identified below. (T-0) The actual layout and brands/types of capabilities provided 
to each position, section, branch, or the EOC will depend on the installation and unit resources, 
budget available, and anticipated incident management workload. Note:  A virtual EOC 
capability is permitted as long as the EOC remains effective in supporting the IC and 
overseeing response and recovery efforts. 
7.25.5.  DELETED 
7.25.6.  DELETED 
7.25.7.  Emergency Communications. Installation EOCs will develop, maintain, and manage 
emergency communications and an associated emergency communications SOP for all multi-
agency and/or multi-jurisdictional emergencies. (T-1) 
7.25.7.1.  Emergency communication capabilities will provide the installation EOC team 
with the capability for timely and reliable communications with the CP, installation 
dispatch center, supporting JIC, supporting MTF, all supporting evacuation and mass care 
teams, and all other associated activities on the installation as well as pre-identified 
response and recovery partners in the local, state, federal, tribal, other Service, and/or 
private (or host nation) communities. (T-0) 
7.25.7.2.  Emergency communication capabilities will include all MWNS, to include cell 
phones, and procedures as well as addressing recording needs and capabilities at the 
installation dispatch center and the installation EOC, at a minimum. (T-0) 
7.25.7.3.  To the extent possible within the fiscal and resource constraints present at DAF 
installations, these emergency communications should be interoperable in terms of 
language (NIMS), procedures, and equipment. 
7.25.8.  Event Log. All installations will have the capability to maintain an event log to record 
and document significant events throughout an incident(s) life cycle when the EOC is 
activated/active. (T-2) At a minimum, EOC event logs will include actions/events related to 
the items in Table 7.8 (T-2) Note:  Event logs are an important aspect to AARs, and lessons 
learned and support to potential legal investigations and should be stored/saved for records.

(e.g., ECC, IC, control centers, EOC, CP) to include unclassified chat capabilities with local 
multi-jurisdictional EOC partners. (T-3) 
7.25.10.  Installation COP. Reference Chapter 11 for requirements. 
Section 7E—Additional National Incident Management System (NIMS) Command and 
Coordination Aspects 
7.26.  Concept Overview.  Domestic whole-of-community/nation multi-agency response and 
recovery for type 3 and higher incidents relies on the Multi-Agency Coordination System (MACS), 
JIS, and the overarching tactical, operational, and strategic NIMS command and coordination 
structure. This section aligns domestic DAF EM Program policy as a foundational aspect to 
generating interoperability with mission partners at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. 
Note:  Installations should account for equivalent host nation emergency response MACS, JIS, 
and command and coordination concepts. 
7.27.  Multiagency Coordination System (MACS) Requirements. 
7.27.1.  Installations will interface with domestic MAC groups (or host nation equivalents) and 
account for participation at central locations as needed for operational information-sharing and 
resource coordination in support of on-scene efforts as shown in Figure 7.5. (T-0) 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023

Figure 7.5.  Incident Expansion and Multiagency Coordination System (MACS) Roles. 
 
7.27.2.  Installation commanders and the EOC director will be prepared to and support the 
MACS concept and procedures established in NIMS for on and/or off-scene MAC group 
activities. (T-0) 
7.27.3.  During multi-agency response operations and the installation EOC is activated, the 
EOC director will collaborate with the IC LNOs and monitor other EOCs (local, state, federal, 
and host nation equivalents) regarding formation of MAC groups. (T-0) 
7.27.4.  The installation EOC director, will make recommendations to the installation 
commander regarding MAC group interface that involves governors, tribal leaders, mayors, 
city managers, and county commissioners, regarding incident management to include priorities 
and strategies for dealing with incident response and recovery when competition for resources 
is significant. (T-0) 
7.27.5.  At a minimum, the installation staff judge advocate, PAO, EOC director, and IEM 
should be prepared to support the installation commander regarding attendance/interface with 
MAC Groups (or perform in the absence of the installation commander).

DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
7.27.6.  The DAF C2 continuum as a whole (e.g., installation EOC, CP, MAJCOM 
AFFOR/FLDCOM SPACEFOR staff, AFSWC) will also monitor and support other MACS 
entities (or host nation equivalents) associated with the DoD/DAF EM Program regarding 
local, state, federal, tribal, DoD, other DoD services/components, and private (or host nation) 
operations centers, to include the National Operations Center, the FEMA regional response 
coordination centers, joint field office (when established), and state and local EOCs as dictated

PREVENT, PROTECT, AND MITIGATE MISSIONS 
8.1.  Purpose.  Specify DAF EM concepts and policy to integrate functional specific resources, 
information, programs, and related capabilities to generate whole-of-community/mission partner 
preparedness and interoperability aligned with DHS/DoD/DAF EM planning frameworks, mission 
areas, and common core capabilities. 
Section 8A—‘Prevent’ Activities and Common Core Capabilities 
8.2.  Concept.  Within the DAF, prevent activities are executed IAW DoDI O-2000.16. (T-0) The 
DAF EM Program will account for prevention activities, actionable mission area output, and 
common core capabilities to inform planning, public warning, and operational coordination as to 
generate interoperability with local, state, federal, and host nation mission partners. (T-0) Prevent 
activities will be designed to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. 
In this regard, prevention actions will protect lives, resources, facilities, infrastructure, and 
missions though coordinated intervention. 
8.3.  Overview. 
8.3.1.  AF/A4S is the primary OPR for the EM prevent mission area primarily through 
implementation of DoDI O-2000.16 and IBD. (T-0) 
8.3.2.  The installation Security Forces commander and AT program manager officer are 
responsible for coordination and execution of AT related prevention activities and related 
common core capabilities with the support of the EMWG, EP2T, and installation functional 
areas as needed. (T-1) 
8.4.  ‘Prevent’ Activities and Requirements. 
8.4.1.  AT and EM Program Integration. Key areas of concern regarding all-hazards/threat 
prevention activities should be identified through the planning and IRM processes identified

8.4.2.  Mission Area Intersection Between Prevent, Protect, and Respond. 
8.4.2.1.  Steady-state information regarding prevention activities and common core 
capabilities (e.g., intrusion detection, intelligence and information sharing, interdiction, 
and disruption, etc.) will be provided to the ECC, IEM, and CP with respect to 
preparedness/readiness to execute/modify crosscutting public information and warning, 
protection, and response related common core capabilities. (T-1) 
8.4.2.2.  During response and recovery operations, relevant information regarding 
prevention activities, threats, and common core capabilities will be provided to the 
installation/tactical DAF EM construct elements specified in Table 3.1. (T-1) 
8.4.2.3.  Prevention planning and execution activities will account for access and direction 
to external mutual aid responders while coordinating outbound and inbound movement of 
evacuation traffic and mass care resources. (T-1) 
8.5.  ‘Prevent’ Common Core Capabilities in Support of the Installation Emergency 
Management (EM) Program.  EM Programs at all echelons will plan for, coordinate, track, and 
evaluate the described prevent crosscutting and common core capabilities as it relates to internal 
integration and interoperability with local, state, federal, and host nation partners. (T-0) 
8.5.1.  IRM. Reference Chapter 4 for crosscutting prevention related IRM requirements. 
8.5.2.  Planning. The installation ATWG and the supporting MTF commander will describe 
prevention strategies that account for all-hazards/threats identified during the EM planning and 
IRM process described in Chapter 4. (T-0) Prevention plans such as the installation AT plan, 
Integrated Defense Plan, Information Assurance Plan, and associated medical response plans. 
Installations will posture prevention common core capabilities-based EM planning 
requirements described in Attachment 3, and standard core capability targets in Attachment 
4. (T-0) 
8.5.3.  E&T. Reference paragraph 5.4 for required E&T and Attachment 5 for recommended 
specific prevention core capability E&T opportunities. 
8.5.4.  Public Information and Warning. Reference Chapter 8 for crosscutting prevention 
execution requirements. 
8.5.5.  Information sharing is the ability to exchange intelligence, information, data, or 
knowledge among government or host nation partners, as appropriate and permitted by U.S. 
law and policy including any international agreements with host nation partners. Consistent 
with intelligence oversight governance, exploit timely and actionable information concerning 
physical and virtual threats to personnel, resources and assigned missions. 
8.5.6.  Interdiction and Disruption. Delay, divert, intercept, halt, apprehend, or secure threats 
and/or hazards to installation jurisdictions. 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023

8.5.7.  Screening, Search, and Detection. Identify, discover, or locate threats and/or hazards to 
installations through active and passive installation surveillance and search procedures. This 
may include the use of systematic examinations and assessments, bio surveillance, CBRNE 
and other sensor technologies, or physical investigation and intelligence. 
8.5.8.  Forensics and Attribution. Within domestic installations/jurisdictions, support local, 
state, and federal law enforcement forensic analysis and assist with attribution of terrorist acts. 
This includes the source tracing, the means and methods of terrorism, forensic analysis, as well 
as attribution before and after an attack in an effort to prevent initial or follow-on acts and/or 
swiftly develop counter-options. 
Section 8B—‘Protect’ Activities and Common Core Capabilities 
8.6.  Concept.  DAF EM Program activities and common core capabilities within the protect 
mission area apply continuously and will be implemented concurrently with prevent, protect, 
prepare, mitigate, respond, and recover mission areas based on all-hazard/threat situational 
awareness and assessment. (T-0) Note:  The intent of the policy in this section is to operationalize 
protection activities and common core capabilities along the incident/attack event horizon from 
steady-state to crisis with the ability to escalate appropriate protection capabilities to and through 
incident/attack response and recovery. Historically, the DAF EM Program employed a pre, trans, 
and post attack action model only when hazards/threats increased. This policy looks to transition 
from that model to a capabilities-based construct/model that continually prevents, protects, 
mitigates and then, responds to and recovers from all-hazards/threats. 
8.7.  Overview.  The installation commander, through advice of installation DAF EM Program 
construct specified in Table 3.1, is responsible for adequate planning and timely execution 
regarding protect common core capabilities. Installations should consider the emergent installation 
HQ construct (e.g., Lead Wing and A-staff) to assess the most appropriate organizational design 
to effectively administer the EM program on-behalf of the senior DAF commander. Example: the 
IEM reporting directly to the delegate overseeing the A-staff or USSF Equivalent. 
8.8.  ‘Protect’ Activities and Execution.  Installations will establish steady state protocols for 
monitoring all-hazards/threats and ensure appropriate timing to escalate and execute protection 
common core capabilities. (T-1) When the EOC is activated, the EOC director will coordinate, 
monitor, and advise on execution of protection common core capabilities to the WOC, installation 
CP, and installation commander. (T-1) 
8.9.  ‘Protect’ Common Core Capability Requirements.  DAF EM Programs at all echelons 
will identify, plan for, coordinate, posture, track, evaluate, and execute the following crosscutting 
and mission area common core capabilities to protect lives, resources, facilities, infrastructure, and 
missions. (T-0) Note:  The DAF EM Program applies multiple physical protective measures 
(PPM) to account for the spectrum of all-hazards/threats to DAF world-wide OLs. Reference EM 
protection planning requirements described in Attachment 3 and standard protection core 
capability targets in Attachment 4. 
8.9.1.  IRM. Reference Chapter 4 for crosscutting protection related IRM requirements. 
8.9.2.  Planning. Installations will posture protection common core capabilities based on the 
EM planning and risk management process described in Chapter 4, EM planning requirements 
described in Attachment 3, and standard core capability targets in Attachment 4. (T-0) 
110 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
8.9.3.  E&T. Reference Chapter 5 for required E&T and Attachment 5 for recommended 
specific prevention core capability E&T opportunities. 
8.9.4.  Public Information and Warning. Reference Chapter 8 for crosscutting protection 
execution requirements. 
8.9.5.  Access Control and Identify Verification. Execute physical, technological, and cyber 
measures to control admittance to critical locations and systems. Implement and maintain 
protocols to verify identity and authorize, grant, or deny physical and cyber access to specific 
locations, information, and networks. (T-0) Refer to DoDM 5200.08, Volume 3, Physical 
Security Program:  Access to DoD Installations. 
8.9.6.  Cybersecurity. Protect (and, if needed, restore) electronic communications systems, 
information, and services from damage, unauthorized use, and exploitation. Implement risk-
informed guidelines, regulations, and standards to ensure the security, reliability, integrity, and 
availability of critical information, records, and communications systems and services through 
collaborative cybersecurity initiatives and efforts. Implement and maintain procedures to 
detect malicious activity and to conduct technical and investigative-based countermeasures, 
mitigations, and operations against malicious actors to counter existing and emerging cyber-
based threats, consistent with established protocols. (T-1) Refer to AFI 17-130, Cybersecurity 
Program Management. 
8.9.7.  Critical Infrastructure Protection PPMs. Ensure critical infrastructure sectors and 
protection elements have and maintain risk assessment processes to identify and prioritize 
assets, systems, networks, and functions. Ensure operational activities and critical 
infrastructure sectors have and maintain appropriate threat, vulnerability, and consequence 
tools to identify and assess threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. (T-1) Refer to AFI 10-
2402. 
8.9.8.  ELD PPMs. Activate ELD as an announced emergency protocol procedure to rapidly 
enhance security of facilities and personnel from an active shooter incident (or other 
emergencies dictating lockdown). 
8.9.9.  SIP PPMs. Activate SIP as an announced emergency protocol procedure to generate a 
temporary protective position for personnel within structures or vehicles immediately before 
or after an incident/emergency. 
8.9.10.  Natural Disaster Shelters (NDS) PPMs. Activate and monitor installation NDSs prior 
to and/or after a natural disaster to protect personnel. Monitoring local capability and capacity 
and be prepared to provide reciprocal NDS capabilities. 
8.9.11.  MCS PPMs. Initiate MCS for installation personnel displaced due to any emergency. 
Be prepared to provide MCS for external populations (e.g., displaced populations from 
neighboring DoD installations, refugee evacuation operations, local to regional civilian 
populations, non-combatant evacuees, etc.). 
8.9.12.  Evacuation PPMs. Employ evacuation as an announced emergency protocol procedure 
to reduce the impact of identified hazards/threats on the protected populace by removing all or 
some of the population at risk to a safer location. 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
111 
8.9.13.  Installation Safe Haven (ISH) PPMs. Employ ISHs for a substantial portion of the 
population as needed and correlate MCS needs. This type of safe haven is designed to support 
government and/or non-government evacuees arriving from another DoD installation or 
civilian community (when directed by the SecDef) impacted by a natural or human caused 
disaster and who require temporary safe haven to temporarily stabilize the evacuee’s living 
conditions. Refer to DoDI 4540.05, DoD Transportation of U.S. Nuclear Weapons and 5 CFR 
550, Pay Administration. 
8.9.14.  Remote Safe Haven (RSH) PPMs. Employ RSHs for a substantial portion of the 
population needing relocation from the installation to a RSH (either civilian area and/or another 
DoD installation). Account for and correlate MCS needs. This type of safe haven is designed 
to support government evacuees departing from a DoD installation impacted by a natural or 
human caused disaster and who require temporary safe haven on another DoD installation or 
in a civilian community. Refer to DoDI 4540.05 and 5 CFR 550. 
8.9.15.  Public Health PPMs. Employ HPCONs in response to a public health emergency or 
incident of public health concern IAW AFI 10-2519. 
8.9.16.  Expedient Hardening PPMs. Activate expedient hardening as an announced protocol 
procedure to increase survivability of personnel and pre-identified key facilities, resources, and 
mission assets (i.e., aircraft) regarding natural disasters and human-caused incidents/attacks. 
8.9.17.  Dispersal and Relocation Execution Concept Options (DRECO) PPMs. Execute 
DRECOs as an announced protocol procedure with task-organized forces capable of executing 
options to increase survivability of personnel and key resources/mission assets (i.e., aircraft) 
regarding human-caused incidents/attacks. Note:  DRECOs differ from evacuation in that 
DRECOs focus on continued mission generation and survivability of the fighting/military force 
while evacuation pertains to the totality of the installation population more related to natural 
disasters and technological hazards/threats (e.g., combatants and non-combatants). 
8.9.18.  Supply Chain Resiliency. Use detection and monitoring capabilities to determine 
potential to actual status of critical supply chains and determine means to move supplies in and 
through geographical areas compromised by all-hazard/threat effects. Analyze key installation 
dependencies and interdependencies related to installation supply chain operations. Partake in 
installation IRM activities to identify, mitigate vulnerabilities of, and protect key assets, 
infrastructure, and support systems. Implement physical protections, countermeasures, and 
policies to secure and make resilient key installation supply chain nodes, methods of transport 
between nodes, and materials in transit. 
Section 8C—‘Mitigation’ Activities and Common Core Capabilities 
8.10.  Concept.  DAF EM Program mitigation activities and common core capabilities pertain 
actions necessary to reduce loss of life and property by lessening the impact of all-hazards/threats. 
Mitigation capabilities should include, but are not limited to, community-wide risk reduction 
projects; efforts to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure and key resource lifelines; risk 
reduction for specific vulnerabilities from natural, technological, and human-caused all-
hazard/threat effects and initiatives to reduce future risks after a disaster has occurred.

DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
8.11.  Overview. 
8.11.1.  The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) is responsible for mitigation planning and execution 
to include CE response and recovery (e.g., Contingency Response Plan) in support of the IEMP 
10-2, EAP, or equivalent. 
8.11.2.  The CE Community planner, and relevant stakeholders of installation plans focused 
on resilience, in coordination with the EP2T, IEM, and EMWG, should conduct mitigation 
planning activities and include them in the IEMP 10-2. 
8.12.  ‘Mitigate’ Activities and Requirements. 
8.12.1.  Building Codes. The BCE will review and account for whole-of-community public 
works projects, to include installation new building construction (MILCON) and 
refurbishment or repairs of existing facilities, support the construction standards established in 
references UFC 4–010–01 and UFC 4–021–01, and applicable DHS, FEMA, and Air Reserve 
Component (ARC) guidance. (T-0) 
8.12.2.  DELETED 
8.12.3.  Utility Coordination. The BCE should meet on an as-needed basis with owners of 
external utilities, such as power, communications, water, waste management, and 
sewer/wastewater companies, to identify mitigation efforts being taken by these utility owners, 
including a review of applicable mitigation plans, if permitted by these providers. A best 
practice for this process is the use of a pre-coordinated mitigation committee session focused 
on this issue. 
8.12.4.  Technological Hazards Coordination. The BCE and IEM will coordinate with owners 
of specific technological hazards, such as dams, levees, airfields, rail transportation, mass 
transit systems, ferry systems, (petrol) chemical facilities and related manufacturing, storage, 
or transportation systems, with the potential or historical impact to the DAF installation. (T-3) 
A best practice for this process is to coordinate these activities with the SMEs, DAF emergency 
managers, and local civil jurisdictions emergency managers as well as attend the LEPC 
meetings, where many of these agencies are represented. 
8.12.5.  Construction, Refurbishment, and Repair. The BCE will support the mitigation 
strategy for reducing the risk of facility and infrastructure damage due to flooding, severe 
weather, seismic events, and other identified hazard/threats. (T-2) Key areas of concern 
regarding mitigation activities should be identified through the processes identified in Chapter 
4. 
8.13.  ‘Mitigate’ Common Core Capability Requirements.  DAF EM Programs at all echelons

9.15.  Cascading Impacts and Community Lifelines.  The sprawling web of cascading 
consequences can be initiated by a single origin event that could start at a local level with gradual 
or fast past impacts to lifelines spreading across a region or national/international level. 
Community lifelines rely on multiple government entities, businesses, and infrastructure sectors 
to function. As a result, installation response operations to stabilize lifelines are unlikely to fit 
within a single jurisdiction, department, agency, infrastructure sector, or industry. In addition, 
because these sectors and the community lifelines they support are interdependent, failures in one 
will cascade across to others. 
9.15.1.  During emergency response operations, DAF EM Programs at all echelons will 
account for cascading impacts to lifelines as to lessen hazards/threats to public health and 
safety; security; and operational missions (safety and security; food, water, shelter; health and 
medical; energy [power and fuel]; communications; transportation; and HAZMAT). (T-0) 
Reference the DHS National Response Framework (NRF) for addition information pertaining 
to cascading impacts and a complete description of each community lifeline. 
9.15.2.  Installation IRM activities within the installation EOC will track and anticipate 
potential points of lifeline failures to include coordinated action to restore lifelines and/or 
otherwise reduce vulnerability due to degraded lifelines. (T-0) 
9.15.3.  DAF EMIS IT systems/applications supporting emergency response/recovery at all 
echelons will provide sufficient detail regarding lifeline status from a holistic local, state, 
regional, and national/international lens. (T-0) 
9.15.4.  EM exercises will evaluate the ability of installations to collectively track, restore, and 
otherwise reduce vulnerability due to degraded lifelines. (T-0) 
Section 9C—General First and Emergency Response Operations and Activities 
9.16.  Concept Overview.  Initial response to all-hazards/threats requires a systematic yet flexible 
approach. The IC and the collective of first and emergency responders should collaborate to ensure 
operational incident planning accounts for specific hazards/threats to responders and the public. 
9.17.  General Actions, Activities, and Operations.  The general actions presented in Table 9.2 
are provided to assist installation responders with understanding regarding the context and flow of 
initial to sustained response activities. Installations will account for and expand on these actions 
and activities. (T-0)

response capability, regardless of size, to a major accident involving any DoD resources. 
9.18.1.  The DAF IRB will respond unless directed otherwise by higher headquarters. (T-1) 
The IRB, through the EOC or IC, will coordinate directly with local officials until the asset 
owner, FEMA, or host nation officials arrive. Note:  Where there is more than one installation 
in a small geographical area, the affected commanders may negotiate a memorandum of 
agreement on incident response responsibilities. 
9.18.2.  The IRB may be tasked to perform rescue operations, accident site security, 
firefighting, initiation of EOD procedures, radiation monitoring, establishing C2 and 
communications, public affairs activities, and casualty management.

9.18.3.  For nuclear weapons incident/accidents outside of the RTF AOR, IRBs will provide 
initial response to control the scene until relieved by the responding RTF or higher authority. 
(T-0). The IRB may need to perform tasks provided in paragraph 9.18.2. 
Section 9D—Nuclear Weapon Incident/Accident Response 
9.19.  Concept Overview.  DoD NARP requires an IRF to establish security cordon and for EOD 
technicians to mitigate immediate effects of the incident and support weapon recovery and 
transportation process with the follow-on RTF. 
9.20.  Department of the Air Force (DAF) Response to United States (U.S.) Nuclear Weapon 
and Radiological Material Matters.  The DAF organizes, trains, and equips AFFOR to support 
necessary actions in response to a U.S. nuclear weapon incidents in the Air Force's custody or 
when directed by the SecDef IAW DoDD 3150.08. 
9.20.1.  DAF MAJCOMs (e.g., AFGSC, USAFE, etc.) tasked to support a CCMD RTF will 
establish a MAJCOM-level program that organizes, trains, equips, and sustains an RTF and

DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
Chapter 10 
RECOVER MISSION AND OPERATIONS 
10.1.  Purpose.  Specify DAF EM concepts and policy to integrate functional specific resources, 
information, programs, and related capabilities to recover and restore installation infrastructure, 
essential public services, social support systems, and operational mission capability. 
Section 10A—Installation Recovery Strategy 
10.2.  Concept.  Installation short term/initial recovery actions focus on restoration of lifeline 
systems to an acceptable standard and providing for basic human needs while balancing 
operational mission restoration needs. Once some stability is achieved, the installation begins 
longer-term recovery. Note:  Recovery efforts may quickly exhaust installation capabilities and 
require the capabilities of local, state, federal, other Service, and/or private (or host nation) EM, 
public works, environmental, and mass care-related agencies and departments. 
10.3.  Overview.  The installation EOC will establish initial recovery objectives to ensure 
sustained resource management and coordination efforts. (T-0) Long-term strategic objectives 
may be developed through the EOC if still activated, the RWG when activated/formed, or other 
means as determined locally as to transition from initial to long-term recovery activities. 
10.3.1.  The installation commander will establish RWG recovery priorities consistent with the 
installation’s supported missions. (T-0) 
10.3.2.  The BCE should be responsible for ensuring execution of initial and long-term 
recovery planning and operations. 
10.3.3.  The BCE should ensure continued and/or increased access to debris and trash removal 
services as well as restoration of sewage treatment and removal, water treatment and provision 
of water services to both recovery efforts and the community, and power generation and 
distribution to both recovery efforts and the community. 
10.3.4.  If circumstances warrant, medical personnel should issue health advisories IAW the 
circumstances surrounding the event. 
10.3.5.  Public affairs should be prepared to advise the general public, communicate risk, and 
provide information on measures being taken by the installation commander to address the 
situation and individual needs. 
10.3.6.  Recovery operations must be consistent with existing Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration regulations, DHS guidance and DAF Occupational Safety and Health 
standards. 
10.3.7.  Recovery efforts will ensure compliance with National Environmental Policy Act, 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, Emergency 
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and applicable Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) guidelines to include requirements within AFI 32-7001, Environmental 
Management. (T-0) 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
129 
10.3.8.  Special attention and planning must be focused on the fiscal and logistical impact of 
recovery efforts, especially those incidents requiring long-term displacement of the population, 
decontamination, restoration, and/or environmental remediation of affected areas. 
10.3.9.  Incident/Accident Site Control Transfer. Once an emergency is terminated and 
recovery starts, control of the site must be officially transferred from the IC to another 
individual or organization and assume command as the ROC. 
10.3.9.1.  The ROC will be appointed by the installation commander and must be a SME 
in the hazards or activities within the incident site. (T-2) For example, initiating actions to 
contain the hazard and clean up the site to restore the area to its condition before the 
incident. The person in charge of that work should have an environmental engineering 
background and be familiar with HAZMAT clean-up requirements. 
10.3.9.2.  The ROC must be a trained and qualified SME in the hazards or activities to be 
performed within the incident site. (T-2) 
10.3.9.3.  For aircraft and spacecraft incidents/accidents, the mishap site is controlled by 
the IC until officially transferred to the ROC. (T-1) Once the mishap site is determined to 
be safe, safety investigators should have unfettered access for the preservation of evidence 
and safety investigation. Recovery operations will not commence until safety board 
president deems that the evidence is no longer needed. 
10.4.  Recovery Focal Points.  During recovery operations, installations will account for and 
execute the recovery focal points identified in Table 10.1. (T-1) 
Table 10.1.  Minimum Recovery Focal Points. 
Recovery Focal Points 
Eliminate life-threatening conditions 
Provide for public health and safety 
Sustain and/or restore critical operations 
Provide suitable housing conditions 
Restore essential operations 
Building codes, permits, and inspections 
Restore essential services 
Provide and/or manage financial assistance 
to all sectors of the DAF community 
Provide EPI to the DAF community 
Resume normal economic and social activity 
within the DAF community 
Provide community planning and 
development 
Return personnel to normal work schedules 
and assignments 
10.5.  Recovery Priorities.  Consideration will be given to operational mission priorities and re-
establishment of the normal operating environment. To assist the installation commander with this 
process, Table 10.2 provides a time contingent priority list as it relates to catastrophic 
disasters/attacks (e.g., Type 1, 2, and 3 incidents). The IEMP 10-2 should contain a similar listing 
and the installation commander should modify priorities as local conditions warrant.

10.6.  Recovery Working Group (RWG) Organization.  The RWG will be a task-organized 
group focused on the evaluation, prioritization, and coordination of recovery requirements. (T-0) 
10.6.1.  The installation commander will establish an RWG early in the recovery phase of 
every emergency where recovery operations require coordination in the judgment of the 
installation commander. (T-0) 
10.6.2.  The installation commander will determine the appropriate composition, including 
additional membership, and the frequency and desired outputs of the RWG depending upon 
the incident type, magnitude, and impacts. (T-0) 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
131 
10.6.3.  The BCE should be the RWG chair with representation from other functional areas 
based on the scope and magnitude of recovery operations. Note:  In some instances, such as 
pandemic and/or biological warfare agent incidents/attacks, the senior medical representative 
could be the RWG chair or other functional area with appropriate knowledge, skills, and 
abilities/qualifications. 
10.6.4.  For long term recovery missions, the RWG should serve as an advisory subcommittee 
under the installation EMWG to provide coordination and oversight of the recovery process. 
10.6.5.  The RWG should be responsible for conducting recovery planning, developing 
reconstruction policies, establishing recovery and reconstruction priorities, identifying 
mitigation opportunities within the recovery process, developing policies for redevelopment, 
recommending modifications to building codes and permitting processes, and developing 
policies for temporary housing and associated long-term mass care operations. 
10.6.6.  For catastrophic disasters that displace a large portion of the installation population, 
installations should consider establishing an RWG Unmet Needs Committee (UNC). The 
purpose of the RWG-UNC should be to access and coordinate resources at the community 
level and consider community needs that are not being addressed or have been denied by other 
resources. If established, the RWG-UNC will be chaired by a FSS commander representative 
in coordination with the installation commander. (T-1) 
10.7.  Recovery Planning.  Recovery planning will be conducted at the installation level. (T-1) 
10.7.1.  Recovery planning will be conducted by the RWG with the technical direction of the 
BCE or designated chair. (T-1) 
10.7.2.  While the IEMP 10-2 facilitates response and initial recovery, the recovery plan will 
provide detailed, incident-specific process and procedures for successful long-term recovery 
based upon the recovery priorities identified in Table 10.2. (T-1) The goals of recovery 
planning should be to define a phased, measurable recovery program with a sequenced priority 
of work specific to the incident requirements. 
Section 10B—‘Recover’ Operational Requirements and Considerations 
10.8.  Concept Overview.  This section contains operational requirements and considerations 
regarding limited to catastrophic incident recovery operations. At a minimum, the installation 
RWG should monitor and account for the activities identified in this section. 
10.9.  Initial Damage Assessment and Detailed Surveys.  Damage assessment and impact 
analysis are essential to determining the magnitude, scope, scale, and extent of an emergency. 
10.9.1.  The BCE will establish (pre-incident/disaster), activate, and manage one or more 
damage assessment teams (e.g., Rapid Damage Assessment, Damage Assessment and 
Response, etc.). (T-1) 
10.9.2.  The damage assessment process should begin as soon as possible after an incident 
occurs (e.g., within the response phase) to assess the level of human suffering, infrastructure 
impacts, operational mission impacts, and continue throughout the recovery phase. 
132 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
10.9.3.  Damage assessment teams will consist of task-organized civil engineers, including one 
or more structural engineer and additional duty personnel as needed. (T-1) The team 
organization and composition will be identified in the IEMP 10-2. (T-1) 
10.9.4.  Damage assessment teams will conduct initial damage assessment and follow-on 
detailed damage survey reports encompassing structural evaluation. (T-1) Results will be geo-
tagged and incorporated into DAF EMIS IT systems/applications supporting the EM construct 
and C2 continuum as to enhance situation awareness at the tactical and operational levels (e.g., 
runway destruction, critical mission damage, etc.). (T-2) 
10.10.  Debris Management.  The debris management process should begin as soon as possible 
after an incident occurs to permit ground or air access to the incident site by designated personnel, 
remove life safety and environmental hazards, and mitigate further environmental contamination 
throughout the recovery phase. 
10.10.1.  Debris management provides initial clearance operations and the consolidation of 
debris at one or more sites (with the concurrence of environmental specialists). 
10.10.2.  The IEM will coordinate with the CE operations chief on the establishment, 
activation, and management of one or more debris management teams on the installation when 
requested by the installation EOC or activated as identified in the IEMP 10-2. (T-2) 
10.10.3.  The BCE will identify and create a storage site for asphalt and concrete debris that 
could be repurposed as aggregate for rapid airfield damage repair operations. (T-2) 
10.10.4.  The BCE will account for environmental considerations to include site planning and 
permitting for debris collection sites, guiding the separation of oil and hazardous substances, 
to include household hazardous and toxic waste, from the debris stream, identification of 
recycling and reuse options and opportunities, and guiding debris issues related to historic or 
protected structures. (T-2) Note:  Consider pre-staging debris management teams and 
equipment for specific hazards with delayed onset known to generate significant debris 
management requirements (e.g., tropical cyclones/hurricanes). 
10.11.  Emergency Public Information (EPI).  The installation PAO (in coordination with the 
RWG, IEM, and CP) will continue communication to displaced populations during recovery 
operations by providing pertinent information. (T-1) Consider a Town Hall venue with key 
leadership participation. 
10.12.  Public Safety.  Security Forces will maintain public safety during the recovery phase 
through access control, enforcing installation (or impacted site) reentry procedures, to include 
reentry permitting. (T-1) Include traffic control and safety measures to account for lack of public 
infrastructure, such as lighting and signals along transportation routes, and hazardous conditions, 
such as sinkholes and debris piles. 
10.13.  Public Health.  The Public Health office will monitor and coordinate public health 
considerations during recovery to include sanitary conditions for workers and residents, vector 
control, and public health issues resulting from lack of water treatment facilities, wastewater 
pumping and treatment, solid waste collection, and disposal. (T-0) 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
133 
10.14.  Occupational and Environmental Health Safety.  Occupational Safety, in coordination 
with Public Health and Bioenvironmental Engineering, will monitor and provide advice regarding 
protection from primary and secondary occupational health hazards for personnel conducting 
recovery operations. (T-1) The RWG and immediate supervisors of recovery personnel will 
account for and enforce occupational safety to include: 
10.14.1.  Heat and Cold Stress Management. All heat and cold stress management and 
monitoring will be conducted IAW applicable portions of DAFI 48-151, Thermal Stress 
Program. Note:  ICs should take into consideration the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health guidance and DAFI 48-151, Chapter 3, Table 3.1, Work/Rest Times & Fluid 
Replacement Guide, Technical Bulletin 507 (U.S. Army 2003) for work/rest cycles while 
conducting response and recovery operations. 
10.14.2.  Respiratory Protection. Recovery personnel will be equipped with appropriate 
respiratory protection as advised by BE. (T-0) 
10.14.3.  PPE. Recovery personnel dealing with incident debris, construction and demolition 
debris, and hazardous substances/waste, to include CBRNE contaminants, will be equipped 
with appropriate PPE. (T-0) Because of the difficulty in performing recovery operations in 
some levels of PPE, the RWG and/or supervisors must plan for work-rest rotation of recovery 
personnel and the need to request for additional resources required in sustaining recovery 
operations. 
10.15.  Fatality Management and Mortuary Affairs.  The FSS will lead fatality management 
and mortuary affairs activities, in coordination with medical and Personnel Support for 
Contingency Operations representatives. (T-1) All mortuary affairs operations will be conducted 
IAW DoDI 1300.29, Mortuary Affairs Program, and DAFI 34-160, Mortuary Affairs Program. 
(T-0) 
10.16.  Psychological Health.  The installation medical provider will provide for professional 
disaster mental health and conventional counseling services. (T-0) 
10.17.  Spiritual Health.  The installation chaplain will provide for religious and spiritual health 
and coordinate with local capabilities. (T-0) 
10.18.  Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Decontamination.  Decontamination of areas, 
facilities, and/or assets contaminated with toxic industrial/material due to disaster is a long-term, 
complex recovery operation and must address resource management, safety, long-term health 
issues, environmental concerns, and effect on mission accomplishment. The RWG will coordinate 
decontamination requirements to include activities carried out by the designated state, federal, or 
private provider under 40 CFR 300, National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution 
Contingency Plan, and applicable environmental laws. (T-0) Note:  Reference DAFI 10-2503 
regarding CBRNE decontamination requirements. 
10.19.  Environmental Remediation and Retrograde Operations.  The scope and duration of 
remediation and retrograde operations depends on the hazardous substances involved and consists 
of a complex set of long-term coordinated actions depending on the hazardous substances released 
due to peacetime disasters. 
134 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
10.19.1.  Remediation is normally performed by civilian environmental consultant firms under 
contract to the DAF and/or under the supervision of the EPA, depending on the nature of the 
incident. The BCE should coordinate remediation requirements in support of the RWG. 
10.19.2.  The RWG will account for redeployment of personnel and equipment into impacted 
areas as soon as objectives are accomplished or the need for response resources diminishes. 
(T-2) Pre-retrograde movement considerations include a review of the incident and identified 
and potential hazards to ensure that equipment and material to be moved are safe for 
unprotected contact by assigned personnel. 
10.20.  Evacuee and Housing Recovery.  The formal evacuation phase does not end until all 
personnel evacuated are relocated to their final location, which may be temporary housing, 
permanent housing, or even a geographically remote designated place under the Joint Travel 
Regulation (JTR). The BCE, through the housing office, is responsible for coordinating and 
planning for all housing issues during the recovery phase in support of the RWG with direct 
assistance from the FSS. 
Section 10C—‘Recover’ Common Core Capabilities 
10.21.  Concept Overview.  DAF EM Programs at all echelons will identify, plan for, coordinate, 
posture, track, evaluate, and execute the following crosscutting and mission area common core 
capabilities to recover installations from all-hazards/threats and execute DSCA. (T-0) Note:  Core 
capabilities are the bottom line and provide the means to roll-up capabilities from a holistic 
perspective to inform the DAF EM governance structure from tactical, operational, to strategic 
levels. 
10.22.  ‘Recover’ Common Core Capability Requirements. 
10.22.1.  IRM. Reference Chapter 4 for crosscutting response related IRM requirements. 
10.22.2.  Planning. Installations will posture recover common core capabilities based on the 
EM planning and risk management process described in Chapter 4, EM planning requirements 
described in Attachment 3, and standard core capability targets in Attachment 4. (T-0) 
10.22.3.  E&T. Reference paragraph 5.4 for required E&T and Attachment 5 for 
recommended specific recover core capability E&T opportunities.

Section 11B—Department of the Air Force (DAF) Emergency Management Information 
System (EMIS) Synopsis and Requirements 
11.4.  Concept Overview.  DAF EMIS will, through execution of EM mission areas and core 
capability information targets identified in Attachment 5, provide the ability to stack static and 
geospatially referenced layers of information as illustrated in Figure 11.1. (T-1) Installations use 
DAF EMIS to geo-tag the natural and built environment layers and assign static informational 
attributes to select geospatial points/areas (i.e., shelter capacity, radiological protection factor, 
points of contact, etc.). 
Figure 11.1.  Department of the Air Force (DAF) Emergency Management Information 
System (EMIS) Taxonomy. 
 
11.5.  Application Structure and Functionality Alignment.  DAF EMIS, as bundled in and 
through the installation COP, will provide distinct functionality through modules aligned with the 
standardized and systematic processes derived from PPD-8 (mission areas and common core 
capabilities), the NIMS, ICS, and policy expressed in this instruction to include DAFI 10-2503. 
(T-1) Note:  This requirement is critical to enable interoperability with a diverse mix of EM 
mission partners. In this context, the DAF EM Program will shape the structure and functioning 
of the installation COP to leverage the required DHS, DoD, and DAF EM preparedness and 
response processes/systems to achieve interoperability.

(EMIS) Support to United States Space Force (USSF) Garrisons.  IAW the USSF MD, DAF 
EMIS, in and through the installation COP, will be fielded at USSF garrisons/delta where the 
USAF is, through the AFMC, the base operational support provider. Note:  IAW PAD 20-01, 
AFMC is the EM capability force provider for USSF locations. 
Section 11C—Installation Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Common Operating Picture 
(COP) Requirements 
11.9.  Concept Overview.  The desired end state emergency response COP (i.e., DAF EMIS) is 
intended to provide standardized, near real-time situational awareness of response forces, an 
incident, or event at the tactical, operational, and strategic level that can be shared and exchanged 
across the DAF as well as with partner agencies. Note:  Installations that do not have a 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM-directed COP may procure other COP-like solutions to meet the minimum 
installation EM COP requirements and DAF installation EMIS standards until such time a COP is 
approved for DAF-wide fielding as long as it includes all capabilities required to comply with the 
core capability target areas IAW PPD-8 and the NIMS. (T-2) 
142 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
11.10.  Minimum Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Common Operating Picture (COP) 
Standards.  An installation EMIS may be a single system solution (e.g., WebEOC) or a suite of 
systems tools (e.g., C2IMERA) used together to achieve the minimum standards in Table 11.1. 
Note:  If installations choose to employ a suite of systems (e.g., C2IMERA) with multiple 
functional capabilities (e.g., maintenance and flying operations, facility and infrastructure status, 
AT status, etc.), the functional community is responsible for training, exercising, resourcing, and 
sustaining that system.

areas, common core capabilities, EM exercise evaluation results, and other information (i.e., local 
lessons learned reports and status of EM training, exercises, plans, etc.). Facilitate and develop the 
IEMP. 
Emergency Management (EM) Logistics Function—Ensure CBRN response equipment, 
equipment unit type codes, individual protective equipment and PPE are properly accounted for, 
maintained, and operational before, during, and after response operations. Identify EM and CBRN 
requirements and allowance standards to prepare/manage budget for PECs 27593F and 27574F.

consolidate and present interoperable EM and CBRN defense information to and from mission 
partners (local, state, federal, tribal, allied, and joint) through the EOC to the installation CP/Wing 
Operations Center and along the tactical, operational, and strategic C2 continuum. For CBRNE 
Risk Index 1 and 2 installations, the IOEM will establish and maintain a CBRN Control Center. 
Note:  Depending on severity of an incident/attack, the IOEM will support recovery operations as 
needed/directed. 
Emergency Management (EM) Operations Function—Perform as installation CBRN 
emergency responders to support CWMD deterrence, attribution, and response activities. 
Emergency Responders—Personnel performing prevention, response, and recovery tasks in 
support of first responders and first receivers while not physically located at the incident site. 
Includes related areas identified in the definition for “first responders.” 
Evacuation—(1) Removal of a patient by any of a variety of transport means from a theater of 
military operation, or between health services capabilities, for the purpose of preventing further 
illness or injury, providing additional care, or providing disposition of patients from the military 
health care system. (2) The clearance of personnel, animals, or materiel from a given locality. (3) 
The controlled process of collecting, classifying, and shipping unserviceable or abandoned 
materiel, U.S. or foreign, to appropriate reclamation, maintenance, technical intelligence, or 
disposal facilities. (4) The ordered or authorized departure of noncombatants from a specific area 
by DoS, DoD, or appropriate military commander. 
Facility—A real property entity consisting of one or more of the following:  a building, a structure, 
a utility system, pavement, and underlying land. 
First Receivers—Healthcare workers at a medical facility that may be engaged in 
decontamination and treatment of victims during an emergency incident occurring at a site other 
than the hospital. First receivers are a subset of first responders. 
First Responders—Personnel performing prevention, response, and recovery tasks at one or more 
incident scenes, including any area directly related to the incident site and therefore, under the 
authority of the incident or unified commander. 
Force Protection—The Air Force defines FP as the process of detecting threats and hazards to the 
Air Force and its mission, and applying measures to deter, pre-empt, negate, or mitigate them 
based on an acceptable level of risk and preventive measures taken to mitigate against DoD 
personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information. FP is a 
fundamental principle of all military operations as a way to ensure the survivability of a 
commander’s forces. A comparison of NATO, joint, and single Service definitions is instructive. 
NATO doctrine explains that “[t]he operational environment may have no discernable ‘front lines’ 
or ‘rear area’ and an adversary may be expected to target Allied vulnerabilities anywhere with a  
 
 
162 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
wide range of capabilities.” Consequently, NATO defines FP as “measures and means to minimize 
the vulnerability of personnel, facilities, materiel, operations, and activities from threats/hazards 
to preserve freedom of action and operational effectiveness thereby contributing to mission 
success. Reference NATO – Allied Tactical Publication 3.3.6., NATO Force Protection Doctrine 
for Air Operations. 
Hazard Assessment—DoD, command, or unit-level evaluation (assessment) to identify hazards 
and associated risk to person, property, and structures and to improve protection from natural or 
manmade disasters or hazards. Hazard assessments serve as one of the foundational components 
for effective EM activities including planning, resource management, capability development, 
public education, and training and exercises. 
Homeland—The physical region that includes the CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories, and 
surrounding territorial waters and airspace. 
Homeland Defense—The protection of U.S. sovereignty, territory, domestic population, and 
critical defense infrastructure against external threats and aggression or other threats as directed 
by the President. 
Homeland Security—A concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the U.S.; 
reduce America’s vulnerability to terrorism, major disasters, and other emergencies; and minimize 
the damage and recover from attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies that occur. 
Host Nation—A nation that receives the forces or supplies of allied nations, coalition partners, or 
NATO organizations to be located on, to operate in, or to transit through its territory. 
Hot Zone—An area that is considered to be dangerous, it generally entails special equipment to 
protect occupants, because there is high-risk exposure to contamination. 
Incident—An occurrence or event, natural or human caused, that requires an emergency response 
to protect life or property. Incidents for example, can include major disasters, emergencies, 
terrorist attacks, terrorist threats, wildland and urban fires, floods, HAZMAT spills, nuclear 
accidents, aircraft accidents, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, war-related 
disasters, public health and medical emergencies, and other occurrences requiring an emergency 
response. 
Incident Command Post—The field location where the primary incident management functions 
are performed. The Incident CP may be co-located with the incident base or other incident 
facilities. 
Incident Management Team or Emergency Response Team—is a group of professionals who 
are trained to prepare for, respond and recover from all-hazards and the full spectrum of emergency 
incidents such as a natural disaster or an interruption of business operations. This team is generally 
composed of specific members designated before an incident occurs, although under certain 
circumstances the team may be an ad hoc group of willing volunteers. 
Incident of Public Health Concern—An infectious disease (natural, accidental, or deliberate) 
likely to significantly impact the ability of the DoD to maintain MA or likely to result in significant 
increases in request for DoD assistance.

arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance risk cost with mission benefits 
as described in DoDIO-2000.16V1_AFI31-245-O. The end product of the risk management 
process is the identification of areas and assets that are vulnerable to the identified threat attack 
means. From the assessment of risk based upon the three critical components of risk management 
(threat assessment, criticality assessment, and vulnerability assessment), the commander 
determines which assets require the most protection and where future expenditures minimize risk 
of attack or lessen the severity of the outcome of an attack. 
Risk Management—A continual process or cycle where risks are identified, measured, and 
evaluated; countermeasures are designed, implemented, and monitored to see how they perform, 
with a continual feedback loop for decision-maker input to improve countermeasures and consider 
trade-offs between risk acceptance and risk avoidance.

A3.6.  Prevention Planning.  The installation FP Working Group will conduct prevention 
planning for terrorist threats and coordinate with the EMWG, the EP2T, and the IEM. (T-0) 
A3.6.1.  Prevention planning will specify appropriate courses of action in coordination with 
local, state, tribal, territorial, federal, host nation, and private sector entities to prevent an 
imminent terrorist attack. (T-0) 
A3.6.2.  Prevention plans will address criminal, terrorism, disease, and negligent human 
elements to the hazards identified during the risk management process. (T-0) 
A3.6.3.  The installation EMWG will develop and promulgate an installation prevention 
strategy, goals, plans, and procedures in coordination with the installation ATWG, information 
assurance staff, the MTF commander, and the F&ES fire chief. Examples of prevention 
strategies should include: 
A3.6.3.1.  Security Related:  AT program, Law Enforcement, physical security prevention 
activities include crime prevention, terrorism prevention, surveillance detection, counter-
surveillance, and community policing. (T-0) 
A3.6.3.2.  Medical Related:  MTF prevention activities such as vaccinations, 
immunizations, syndromic surveillance, vector control, and preventive health procedures 
including isolation, or quarantine as appropriate (i.e., Occupational and Environmental 
Health Site Assessments for OCONUS locations). (T-0) 
A3.6.3.3.  Fire Related:  F&ES prevention activities such as fire investigation and fire 
safety education. (T-0) 
A3.6.4.  For installations at greatest risk from nation state CBRNE hazards/threats, prevention 
planning will address limitations regarding active defense capabilities needed to 
prevent/defend against adversarial nation state fires effects. (T-0) The FP Working Group will 
pass/communicate the inability and/or gaps identified to prevent attacks to the EMWG and the 
IEM as to facilitate development of CBRN specific protection, mitigation, response, and 
recovery capabilities. (T-0) 
A3.7.  Mitigation Planning.  The installation EMWG and EP2T will conduct mitigation planning 
with the technical direction of the IEM and direct support from the appropriate CES representatives 
(i.e., CE operations and CE environmental community planners). (T-0) When applicable, include 
coordination with the installation ATWG and MA POC representatives. 
A3.7.1.  Mitigation planning will establish interim and long-term actions to increase resilience 
and reduce the physical and structural impacts of identified hazards/threats. (T-0) Included will 
be methods to prioritize and account for installation determined community profile and 
protected asset requirements/focal points. (T-0) 
178 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
A3.7.2.  Mitigation plans will describe the physical, IT, and non-materiel mitigation strategies 
associated with hazards/threats identified during the IRM process. (T-0) 
A3.7.3.  Mitigation plans will address interim and long-term actions to reduce impacts as it 
pertains to lives, key resources, facilities, infrastructure, and operational missions. (T-0) 
A3.7.4.  Mitigation plans will address interim and long-term actions to reduce cascading 
impacts to community lifelines as indicated in Figure A3.1. (T-0) Note:  Lifelines are core 
functions that enable the continuous operation of a community/installation and failure of these 
functions can have significant cascading consequences for the entire community. 
A3.7.4.1.  A lifeline enables the continuous operation of critical government and business 
functions and is essential to human health and safety or economic security—the most 
fundamental services in the community that, when stabilized, enable all other aspects of 
society to function. 
A3.7.4.2.  When lifelines are disrupted during an incident, decisive intervention is required 
to stabilize them. Consequently, accounting for lifelines in the planning process can inform 
representation on the planning team and the content of Emergency Operations Plans. 
Although developed to support response planning and operations, community lifelines are 
relevant across the entire preparedness cycle protecting lifelines, preventing, and 
mitigating potential impacts to them, and building back stronger during recovery. 
Figure A3.1.  Community Lifelines. 
 
A3.7.5.  Mitigation plans will consider mitigation opportunities during the recovery phase, 
when hazard awareness is high and funds may become available, for the redesign and/or 
relocation of facilities and infrastructure to include improving lifeline resiliency. (T-0) 
A3.7.6.  Information generated through mitigation planning will be incorporated in the IEMP 
10-2 IAW DoDI 6055.17. (T-0)

A3.8.  Protection and Operational Response Planning.  The installation EMWG and EP2T will 
conduct protection and operational response planning with the technical direction and facilitation 
of the IEM and direct support from identified functional planning lead representative(s). (T-0) 
Protection planning will establish the processes, methods, and specific actions needed to “respond” 
and “protect” lives, key resources, facilities, infrastructure, and operational missions at risk from 
identified all-hazards/threats prior to, during, or after an incident/attack. Commanders at all 
echelons will ensure personnel utilize the AFPAAS during protection operations. (T-0) Note:  
Lead functional representatives are primarily responsible for development of IEMP 10-2 content 
and installation specific TTPs. ANG installations will plan for planning factors listed in paragraphs 
A3.8.1-A3.8.14 while adhering to state policy. 
A3.8.1.  ELD. Plan for and employ ELD as an announced emergency protocol procedure to 
rapidly enhance security of facilities and personnel from an active shooter incident. (T-0)

air conditioning systems and exhaust fans, and procedures for closing and sealing 
windows and doors leading to the SIP location. (T-1) 
A3.8.2.2.6.  Consider an optional SIP kit consisting of towels or other barrier materials 
to place firmly against the bottom edge of doors or windows to reduce air flow, a light 
source, a first aid kit, and information on the relevant MWN signals and messages, 
preferred evacuation routes, and numbers for the dispatch center, installation EOC, and 
personnel accountability staff. SIP kits are not resourced by the EM Program and 
remain the sole responsibility of the facility owning unit, business, or residence owners. 
A3.8.3.  SHS. Plan for SHSs as an announced emergency protocol procedure to protect 
personnel based on local hazards/threats and availability of adequate pre-existing facilities 
designated as shelters capable of protecting the populace for specific hazards/threats. (T-1) 
A3.8.4.  NDS. Identify and plan for shelters capable of providing personnel protection (i.e., 
tornado, hurricane, etc.). (T-1) 
A3.8.4.1.  Functional Planning Leads:  IEM, UEPC, and unit facility managers/owners. 
A3.8.4.2.  Shelter procedures will: 
A3.8.4.2.1.  Identify capabilities, limitations, and occupancy capacity for all shelters. 
(T-1)

A3.8.4.2.3.  When activated, be task-organized and staffed with trained personnel from 
the unit owning the facility/shelter. (T-1) 
A3.8.4.2.4.  Identify shelter supplies and resources. (T-1) The facility owner/unit 
commander is responsible for funding and resourcing of shelter kits/supplies and 
resources. 
A3.8.4.2.5.  For shelters anticipated to house greater than 30 personnel for longer than 
24 days following a disaster, account for mass care operations (e.g., water, food, 
medical supplies, etc.). (T-1) 
A3.8.4.2.6.  Consider an optional emergency kit consisting of water, nonperishable 
food, first aid kit, filter masks, radio, etc. Emergency kits are not resourced by the EM 
program and remain the sole responsibility of the facility owning unit, business, or 
residence owners. 
A3.8.5.  Civilian Shelter Coordination. Plan for use of off installation civilian shelters as a part 
of the overall population protection strategy. (T-3) 
A3.8.5.1.  Functional Planning Leads:  IEM and EP2T. 
A3.8.5.2.  The IEM should coordinate with local civil jurisdictions to determine the 
availability of civilian shelters for:  (1) members of the DAF community residing in the 
civil jurisdiction on the local economy and (2) members of the DAF community residing 
on the installation. 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
181 
A3.8.5.3.  The IEM should account for civilian shelter availability within the IEMP 10-2 
and incorporate information into relevant EM E&T courses (i.e., Air Force EM Program 
Senior Leader Brief, BEPO, UEPC, etc.). 
A3.8.5.4.  Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring that personnel utilizing local 
civilian shelters understand their responsibility under personnel accountability procedures 
to check in and account for the location and status at predetermined intervals. 
A3.8.5.5.  In foreign locations OCONUS, local civilian shelters may not be available or 
adequate for the needs of members of the DAF community. The servicing legal office will 
assist with local authority coordination to ensure compliance with host nation support 
agreements. 
A3.8.6.  Evacuation. Evacuation management planning and operational response will be an 
announced emergency protocol procedure to reduce the impact of identified hazards/threats on 
the protected populace by removing all or some of the population at risk to a safer location. 
(T-1) Planning and operational response actions will facilitate the movement of the protected 
populace to safe locations during an emergency. (T-1) Safe locations can either be at an on-
base safe haven, a safe haven at an off-installation geographically remote location, or a civilian 
shelter off the installation. Note:  IAW DoDI 6055.17, DoDI 2000.16, Volume 1, DoDI 
3020.52, and NFPA 1600, evacuation, rather than the procurement and employment of 
protective equipment, is the primary means of addressing natural, technological, and certain 
human-caused hazards/threats faced by the majority of the protected populace. 
A3.8.6.1.  Functional Planning Leads:  IEM and Logistics Readiness. 
A3.8.6.2.  Evacuation Context and Applicability. Evacuation management is the 
organized, phased, and supervised withdrawal, dispersal, or removal of civilians from 
dangerous or potentially dangerous areas, and their reception and care in safe areas (DoDI 
6055.17). Consider planning for medical patients; noncombatants; clearance of personnel, 
animals, or material; and/or unserviceable/abandoned material. 
A3.8.6.3.  Evacuation Types. Installations will account for three primary types of 
evacuations when conducting evacuation planning. (T-1) 
A3.8.6.3.1.  Spontaneous. A spontaneous evacuation occurs when residents or citizens 
in the threatened areas observe an incident or receive unofficial word of an actual or 
perceived threat and, without receiving instructions to do so, elect to evacuate the area. 
A3.8.6.3.2.  Voluntary. A voluntary evacuation is a warning to persons within a 
designated area that a threat to life and property exists or is likely to exist in the 
immediate future. Individuals issued this type of warning or order are not required to 
evacuate; however, it would be to their advantage to do so. 
A3.8.6.3.2.1.  Installations will designate, in advance, mission-critical and mission-
essential personnel required/requested to remain on base for emergency response 
and recovery. (T-1) 
A3.8.6.3.2.2.  Release of DoD civilian personnel will be IAW established 
manpower and personnel procedures. (T-2) 
 
 
182 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
A3.8.6.3.3.  Mandatory. A mandatory or directed evacuation is a warning to persons 
within the designated area that an imminent threat to life and property exists and 
individuals must evacuate IAW the instructions of local officials. Installations will 
designate, in advance, mission-critical and mission-essential personnel exempt from 
mandatory evacuation for emergency response and initial recovery capabilities. (T-1) 
A3.8.6.4.  Evacuation Authority. The installation commander is the primary authority for 
ordering evacuations within the installation’s jurisdiction (mandatory and voluntary). (T-1) 
Note:  The IC will play a primary role based on incident hazards and make 
recommendations for immediate evacuation and/or or SIP actions. 
A3.8.6.4.1.  The installation commander may independently order the evacuation of all 
or a designated portion of the personnel within the installation’s jurisdiction without 
consultation with other mission commanders or command that manages the installation 
for the benefit of life safety. In such cases, the installation will inform HHQ as soon as 
the situation presents via non-secure or secure voice or data. 
A3.8.6.4.2.  IAW the JTR, the following additional evacuation authorities may apply: 
A3.8.6.4.2.1.  Foreign Locations OCONUS. The employing command or agency 
has authority to order the evacuation of assigned military and DoD civilian 
personnel. 
A3.8.6.4.2.1.1.  The DoS has no authority to order U.S. personnel to evacuate 
an installation but is responsible for advising U.S. citizens on potential or actual 
emergencies and assisting, when possible, with the evacuation of U.S. citizens 
should they choose to follow DoS advice. 
A3.8.6.4.2.1.2.  The SecDef, the SecAF, and CCMD retains authority to direct 
DoD personnel to evacuate an OCONUS (foreign) location, as required. 
A3.8.6.4.2.2.  Domestic Locations. The following officials are responsible for 
ordering an evacuation for military and DoD civilian personnel, as well as their 
supported family members: 
A3.8.6.4.2.2.1.  The SecDef or designated representative (for example, the 
Under SecDef for Personnel and Readiness). 
A3.8.6.4.2.2.2.  The SecAF, or the Secretary’s designated representative. 
A3.8.6.4.2.2.3.  The head of a DoD component or designated representative. 
A3.8.6.4.2.2.4.  The commander of a U.S. installation or designated 
representative. 
A3.8.6.4.2.2.5.  The commander, director, head, chief, or supervisor of an 
organization or office. 
A3.8.6.5.  Evacuation Orders. 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
183 
A3.8.6.5.1.  The order to evacuate an installation may pertain to all personnel who 
work, reside, and/or are visiting within the jurisdiction of the identified installation(s) 
(i.e., military, military family members, DoD civilian employees, DoD civilian 
employee family members, non-appropriated fund employees, contractors, and any 
other civilian or military personnel). 
A3.8.6.5.2.  An evacuation order may include or specifically exempt designated 
personnel depending on the nature of the emergency and current operations. 
A3.8.6.5.3.  If the circumstance and time permits, when the installation commander 
orders an evacuation, specify RSHs or designated location(s)/shelters to facilitate 
personnel accountability, allow effective provision of assistance for evacuees, and 
prevent excessive travel for per-diem reimbursement considerations. 
A3.8.6.5.4.  Evacuation Orders Involving a host nation. 
A3.8.6.5.4.1.  OCONUS within host nations, the applicability and enforcement of 
evacuation will be dependent upon applicable host nation agreements and the 
requirements of such contracts or agreements. The installation EMWG should 
consult with the applicable DoS and JAG representatives to resolve this issue prior 
to an actual event. Evacuation orders differ from noncombatant evacuation 
operations in the following areas: 
A3.8.6.5.4.1.1.  Evacuation orders may direct the movement of personnel from 
one or more domestic location to another domestic location. 
A3.8.6.5.4.1.2.  Evacuation orders may direct the movement of personnel from 
one location within an OCONUS geographic region to another location within 
the same OCONUS geographic region if the identified locations reside within 
the same host nation and if such movement is permitted by the applicable host 
nation agreements. 
A3.8.6.5.4.2.  OCONUS from a host nation to a Different Area. IAW JP 3-68, 
evacuation orders directing the movement of personnel (1) from a host nation to a 
U.S. state, territory, or possession, (2) from one host nation to another, or (3) from 
a host nation to another foreign country must be coordinated and approved by DoS 
through the supporting U.S. Embassy as well as the supported CCMD. 
A3.8.6.6.  Evacuee Collection Points. Installation commanders should consider pre-
designated evacuee collection points on and/or off the installation for the staging of 
personnel awaiting transportation for relocation to a remote safe haven or other areas. 
A3.8.6.6.1.  Installations will account for UVPs (i.e., disabled and special needs 
personnel, animal needs such as military working animals, detainee populations, 
schools, childcare centers, etc.) that are not capable of moving to designated evacuee 
collection points. (T-0) 
A3.8.6.6.2.  Collection point planning should account for appropriate support resources 
(i.e., personnel, transportation, signage, lighting, services, security, personnel 
accountability tools, and communications). 
A3.8.6.7.  Evacuation Route Management. Installations will designate primary and 
secondary evacuation routes for mass evacuation requirements. (T-0) 
184 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
A3.8.6.7.1.  Identify available transportation networks, capabilities, and limitations of 
each to include the carrying capacity. (T-0) 
A3.8.6.7.2.  For land-based proposed evacuation routes, determine likelihood of traffic 
bottlenecks caused either by traffic congestion, natural, technological, and/or human-
caused incidents/attacks that could negate the ability of the route to support evacuation 
(i.e., occurrence of rising flood waters/high winds). 
A3.8.6.7.3.  Evacuation routes should include pre-incident/attack posting of evacuation 
route markers and/or signs. 
A3.8.6.7.4.  Ensure evacuation routes can accommodate the number of evacuating 
personnel and that the route limits exposing evacuating personnel to additional hazards. 
A3.8.6.7.5.  Include methods and means to ensure the evacuation route free of 
contamination through predictive plume modeling. 
A3.8.6.8.  Evacuation Zones. Installations susceptible to mass evacuation (i.e., hurricane 
storm surge) should analyze traffic movements and establish evacuation zones to promote 
efficient evacuation. Evacuation (vulnerability) zones provide a foundation to model traffic 
movements from one geographic area to another. 
A3.8.6.9.  Evacuation Clearance Time. Installations should estimate and publish the time 
needed for evacuees to complete movement to safe havens and/or shelters within the IEMP. 
A3.8.6.10.  Evacuee Tracking and Accountability. Commanders at all echelons will ensure 
personnel utilize the AFPAAS during evacuation operations. Facilitate personnel 
accountability procedures IAW DoDI 3001.02, Personnel Accountability in Conjunction 
with Natural or Manmade Disasters. (T-0) 
A3.8.6.11.  Reentry Process. Installation commanders should plan for an orderly process 
for authorizing reentry by evacuees into one or more installation zones (or the entire 
installation). The installation commander will approve reentry by evacuees at the 
recommendation of the RWG for large-scale incidents. (T-1) For smaller scale incidents, 
the IC will approve reentry by evacuees. (T-1) 
A3.8.6.12.  Evacuation Reimbursement. Reference 5 CFR 550.

installation-determined number of personnel needing relocation from the installation to an 
RSH(s). (T-1) 
A3.8.9.1.  Functional Planning Leads:  IEM, CEO, LRS, and FSS. 
A3.8.9.2.  Installations should coordinate with one or more geographically distant DoD 
installations or, if necessary due to the geographic conditions, civil jurisdictions to establish

190 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
A3.8.14.3.  Implementation of DRECOs will consider operational mission output demands 
prior to, during, or after an incident/attack. (T-1) 
A3.8.14.4.  Installations will plan for and utilize standardized DRECO terminology to 
facilitate DAF wide EM Program ability to OT&E and exercise forces to increase force 
survivability and mission continuation through the following concepts. (T-1) 
A3.8.14.4.1.  Disperse then Return. Employ prior to a disaster/attack when there is 
ample warning/intelligence, permissive air/ground maneuver environment, and 
operational mission generation requirements are a lesser priority. Most personnel and 
unit identified key assets disperse to near-by pre-designated on or off installation sites 
and are prepared to immediately return and commence response/recovery actions to 
include operational mission generation as directed. Identify “ride-out teams” for 
mission essential personnel/functions needed for situational assessment. 
A3.8.14.4.2.  Stand and Sustain. Employ prior to, during, and after a disaster/attack 
when operational mission generation demands outweigh the anticipated effects of the 
incident/attack on personnel and key resources/assets. When a mostly non-permissive 
ground maneuver environment exists, dispersal of personnel and key resources will be 
limited to within the installation boundaries. Applicability of stand and sustain DRECO 
is limited for mass CBRNE attacks. 
A3.8.14.4.3.  Avoid and Endure. The applicability of avoid and endure DRECO is 
primarily applicable for adversarial nation CBRNE attacks. Employ prior to, during, 
and after a disaster/attack when operational mission generation demands outweigh the 
anticipated effects of the incident/attack on personnel and key resources/assets. 
Essential and non-essential personnel will continually maneuver between on and off 
the installation to geographically separated dispersal sites. 
A3.8.14.4.3.1.  Plan to address significant logistical and security issues involved 
with moving or prepositioning people, equipment, and consumables to support 
dispersal site operations and security. (T-1) 
A3.8.14.4.3.2.  Include CCA methods and procedures to ingress/egress potentially 
CBRN contaminated personnel/vehicles. (T-1) 
A3.8.14.4.3.3.  When possible, locate dispersal sites roughly six miles upwind of 
the installation to protect personnel from CBRNE hazards. 
A3.8.14.4.4.  Advance and Relocate. Employ following an attack(s) that reduce the 
installation’s mission generation capability to unacceptable levels and the ability to 
recover installation operational capability is not achievable. Plan for base denial to deny 
adversary use of remaining assets/equipment. Identify transportation means, routes, 
and RSHs for staging of personnel and ultimate re-insertion at other installations for 
continued operations. The applicability of advance and relocate DRECO is primarily 
applicable for mass CBRNE attacks. 
A3.8.14.5.  Installations will specify and prioritize DRECO use inducing factors for 
adversarial nation state enemy mass fires effects. (T-1) 
 
 
DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023

A3.8.14.5.1.  Identify, model, and develop an assumed sum of a singular enemy attack 
(w/ a solitary munition or numerous munitions over a relatively short period) and the 
likely level effects of damage, destruction, death, and/or potentially CBRN 
contamination plus a level of operational capability decrease. 
A3.8.14.5.2.  Identify, model, and develop an assumed sum of enemy sustained attacks 
over time and the likely cumulative effects of damage, destruction, death, and/or 
potentially CBRN contamination plus decrease in the level of operational capability. 
A3.8.14.6.  The IEM will ensure the EMWG is aware of anticipated enemy fires effects 
and related considerations to assist decision makers in advance for determining what 
DRECO to implement when. (T-1) 
A3.8.14.7.  The installation commander is the decision authority to implement DRECOs. 
(T-1) 
A3.9.  Recovery Planning.  The installation EMWG and EP2T will conduct recovery planning 
with the technical direction and facilitation of the IEM and direct support from the appropriate 
CES/CEO representatives. (T-0) 
A3.9.1.  The recovery strategy will provide the overarching guidance and priorities based on 
anticipated hazards/threats to include how recovery operations will be managed and the 
supporting capabilities needed for recovery operations. (T-0) 
A3.9.2.  Installations will plan for the formation of a RWG for post-incident actions. (T-0) 
A3.9.3.  While the IEMP 10-2 facilitates response and short-term recovery, the installation 
recovery plan will be developed following a major disaster/attack and provide the detailed, 
incident-specific process and procedures for successful long-term recovery. (T-1) 
A3.9.4.  Engineer led response and recovery planning and operations will be conducted IAW 
AFPAM 10-219, Volume 1, Contingency and Disaster Planning, AFPAM 10-219, Volume 2, 
Civil Engineer Response and Recovery Preparations, and AFPAM 10-219, Volume 3, Civil 
Engineer Contingency Response and Recovery Procedures.  
A3.10.  Emergency Management (EM) Planning Information Propagation for Response and 
Recovery.  Installations will identify and preposition static and geospatial locality information 
related to physical protection layers such as shelters, evacuation routes, safe havens, and dispersal 
sites/areas as described in Chapter 8.

DAFI10-2501  16 OCTOBER 2023 
Attachment 4 
INSTALLATION COMMON CORE CAPABILITY TARGET STANDARDS 
A4.1.  Purpose.  Identify and consolidate installation standardized core capability targets (aka 
DPFs) to support EM planning, installation capability development, resourcing, MAAs need 
determinations, exercise evaluation requirements, and overarching ability to posture EM related 
capabilities across the DAF. 
A4.2.  Context.  Core capability targets serve to inform internal functional areas and external 
mission partners regarding capability, capacity, and limitations as to enable others to account for 
cascading planning/resourcing requirements. For instance, if an installation only has the capacity 
to shelter 500 personnel following a disaster, then community mass care planners are triggered to 
make agreements/plans for additional capacity. Capability targets are also an integral part in the 
AHTA process and can be used to inform EM-related assessments. 
A4.3.  Application.  Installations, though the EMWG and EP2T, should use the tables in this 
attachment to tailor italicized/underlined core capability impact statements to include quantifying 
the statement (e.g., [#] [time]). Use of a range of quantification is encouraged as to communicate 
not only capability, but also capacity (e.g., provide sheltering for 500 to 750 displaced personnel). 
Installations will retain the installation determined timeframe and critical task portions of core 
capability statements. Note:  Core capability targets do not constitute a requirement for any 
functional area to procure, acquire, stock, or otherwise advance the functional area core capability, 
the targets represent what a unit can provide. 
A4.4.  Crosscutting Capability Targets.  Crosscutting capability targets identified in Table A4.1 
are necessary to the success of the other 29 common core capabilities. IRM targets risk information 
propagation in support of all core capabilities. Planning supports the EMWG to identify 
approaches to deliver each targeted core capability. EM ET&E are tailored to local hazards/threats 
and exercises serve to identify core capability gaps for EMWG actions to manage risk. Public 
information and warning provide clear, actionable, and accessible information to the protected 
populace before, during, and after incidents. Operational coordination, through NIMS and ICS 
constructs, ensures multi-jurisdictional mission partner actions are organized and effective.

A4.8.  ‘Response’ Capability Targets.  Response mission area target statements identified in 
Table A4.5 should encompass capabilities installations require to save lives, protect property and 
the environment, meet basic human needs immediately after an incident, and continue mission 
operations. 
A4.8.1.  Critical transportation operations include clearing debris from roads, airports, ports, 
and other transportation nodes to allow survivors to evacuate and response personnel to enter 
an affected area. After an incident, personnel deliver traditional and atypical mass search and 
rescue operations to save the greatest number of endangered lives in the shortest time possible. 
During mass fatality incidents, fatality management services provide remains recovery, victim 
identification, and bereavement counseling. On-scene security, protection, and law 
enforcement¸ occupational and environmental response/health and safety, and fire 
management and suppression efforts all work to protect responders, survivors, and the 
environment. Throughout the response, officials use Operational Communications and 
Situational Assessment to share information and make informed decisions. 
A4.8.2.  After an incident, public, private, and non-profit organizations provide MCS and 
public health, healthcare, and emergency medical services to address the basic needs of 
survivors. Logistics and supply chain management ensure that essential commodities, 
equipment, and services reach affected communities and assist owners and operators of 
infrastructure systems in restoring systems and services for the community while transitioning 
to the recovery phase. A number of these infrastructure systems are referred to as community 
lifelines. Lifelines provide indispensable services that enable continuous operation of critical 
functions and would risk human health and safety or national economic security if 
compromised or not promptly restored. The four infrastructure systems targets focus on major 
lifelines, such as electrical power, communications, water service, and wastewater service.

A4.9.  Recovery Capability Targets.  The recovery mission area has six common core 
capabilities that work together to repair and restore infrastructure and services needed to support 
the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of survivors and disaster areas identified in Table 
A4.6. The repair and restoration of infrastructure systems reestablishes essential community 
services and minimizes health and safety threats. In turn, re-establishing health and social services 
allows for the restoration of healthcare facilities and networks to promote the resilience, 
independence, health (including behavioral health), and well-being of the whole community. 
Implementing temporary and permanent housing solutions for displaced residents moves survivors 
out of emergency shelters and transitions them into long-term recovery. Experts work with the 
community to preserve, conserve, rehabilitate, and restore natural and cultural resources. In the 
long-term, communities lead economic recovery programs to return economic and business 
activities, including food and agriculture, to a healthy state.
