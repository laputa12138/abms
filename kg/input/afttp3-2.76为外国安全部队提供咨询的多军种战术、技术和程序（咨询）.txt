PREFACE 
1. Purpose
This multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) publication assists in 
advising foreign security forces (FSF). It serves as a reference to ensure coordinated 
multi-Service operations for planners and operators preparing for and conducting 
advisor team missions. This MTTP publication provides units and personnel advising 
FSF with viable tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) so they can successfully 
plan, train for, and carry out their mission. Material regarding advising is found in joint 
and Service doctrine regarding treatment of security cooperation, foreign internal 
defense, counterinsurgency, security force assistance, and unconventional warfare. 
This MTTP publication provides guidance that enhances the activities of some advisor 
functions and improves inter-Service coordination for this joint mission. 
2. Scope
This publication incorporates the positions of organizations within each Service that 
relate to preparing, controlling, and employing advisors with FSF. This MTTP 
publication incorporates TTP extracted from existing Service doctrine, publications, and 
directives, as well as joint and Service lessons-learned, subject matter expert input, and 
other identified best practices. It is designed for use by advisors at all levels, in any 
region or theater, and provides guidance for tactical forces on conducting advisor team 
planning and training.

Chapter I 
OVERVIEW 
“The job of training, advising and partnering with foreign military and security 
forces has moved from the periphery to become a critical skill set across the 
armed forces.” 
—Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, July 2012 
1. Introduction
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Advising Foreign Security 
Forces covers the principles associated with advisor duties for conventional and 
special operations forces (SOF), civilian expeditionary workforce, and contract 
personnel. This publication establishes a baseline foundation for understanding the 
specific tasks in which an advisor must be proficient when functioning as a foreign 
security forces (FSF) advisor. This publication describes techniques that blends 
science and art. Even though this publication focuses on the advisor team, the 
principles contained herein are relevant to the individual advisor as the building 
block of the team. 
This multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) addresses advisor 
considerations and skill sets from planning to mission follow-through. This first 
chapter explains the strategic picture that advisors support, the processes and 
authorities that drive advisor mission sets, the frameworks under which advisors 
operate, and the various roles that advisors are expected to fill. These overarching 
topics set the background for the daily decisions advisors make and the parameters 
within which they act. It is important to note that advisors can serve at the tactical, 
operational, and strategic levels—in all theaters, under all conditions, and in support 
of any type of mission or operation. 
This MTTP does not revise or supersede Service training doctrine or current 
advisor unit tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) and/or standard operating 
procedures (SOPs). Nor does it cover common occupational specialties or combat, 
survival, or Service-specific skills that may be critical to the advisor mission. 
2. The Strategic Picture
Advising is not a new mission for the US military. From Lieutenant General Claire 
Lee Chennault’s support to China with the Flying Tigers during World War II, through 
Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and hundreds of smaller efforts around the globe, 
United States (US) military advisors have been an important part of achieving US 
strategic goals. Current national policy encourages the employment of advisors early 
as a method of engagement to prevent crisis rather than as a response to it. 
Success or failure of the US security cooperation (SC) strategy often depends on 
the impact the US has on the FSF, so the FSF’s progress towards shared objectives 
becomes the measuring stick for advisors. The FSF include all personnel available 
within a national arsenal trained and employed for the purpose of security, whether 
2 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
they are civil or military, federal, state, provincial, or local. Examples of FSF are 
coast guards, fire departments, police, border patrols, customs and immigration, and 
active and reserve military. Security forces will vary, based on an individual country’s 
priorities, often having unique deployment, employment, equipping, and sustainment 
requirements. The condition of the FSF, in some cases, will require it to be built from 
scratch; in others, advisors may be able to transform existing FSF so they can best 
meet the needs of the partner nation (PN).  
Advisor Significance. Advisors need to understand their efforts are part of a larger 
program of US assistance to other nations, and, in many cases, the advisor is the 
critical link between the United States and its partners to produce capability and 
capacity. In fact, success at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels requires 
advisors to coordinate with related efforts in the PN or region.  
Note: This interorganizational coordination may include US Government departments 
and agencies; state, local, and tribal governments; international organizations; 
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); and the private sector. For additional 
information, see JP 3-08, Interorganizational Cooperation. 
The concepts of advisor significance and the progress of FSF are echoed in US 
strategic documents: 
The Interim National Strategic Security Guidance of 2021 states: “Ensuring 
our national security requires us to . . . lead and sustain a stable and open 
international system, underwritten by strong democratic alliances, partnerships, 
multilateral institutions, and rules.” It also states, “When we strengthen our 
alliances, we amplify our power and our ability to disrupt threats before they can 
reach our shores.” 
In light of revisionist powers’ predatory economic practices and political 
subversion in competition short of war, the 2018 National Defense Strategy 
states: “We will support U.S. interagency approaches and work by, with, and 
through our allies and partners to secure our interests and counteract this 
coercion.” 
It is these and other guiding documents that ensure military advisor teams and 
their interagency counterparts are all driving towards the same strategic goal line. 
Figure 1 depicts how this unified effort occurs. 
As indicated in figure 1, each combatant commander (CCDR) develops a 
campaign plan—nested within the Joint Strategic Campaign Plan (JSCP)—utilizing 
various theater SC activities (military engagement and development). These 
activities shape the environment relative to US defense interests, as well as the PN 
defense and development objectives, by building relationships, improving PN 
security forces, and gaining access within the region. Advisors will often do military 
engagement to gain access and build relationships, thus setting the stage for 
development.

Figure 1. Identifying Common Security Interests 
Note: For additional information on military engagement or the purposes of SC, see 
JP 3-20, Security Cooperation. 
The CCDR theater campaign plan details specified country plans that articulate 
the CCDR’s intent to apply time, money, and effort in a specific country. Likewise, 
with guidance from the Department of State (DOS) and US ambassadors (chiefs of 
mission [COMs]), US embassy country teams develop the integrated country 
strategy. The integrated country strategy is a three-year, US Government country 
plan that incorporates the unique circumstances and needs of the host nation, and 
then identifies the most significant US national interests in each country and 
describes the US Government’s plan to attain them. Combatant commands 
(CCMDs) use integrated country strategies to inform their country planning teams 
and help ensure Department of Defense (DOD) efforts are aligned with those of the 
specific US diplomatic mission. 
For a specific country, ambassadorial authority extends to all elements of the US 
mission and all official US Government activities and establishments within the PN. 
The only exception to the ambassador’s authority over US Government activities is 
the control of military elements under the direct command of a CCDR.

15 June 2023 
Together, CCMD and US embassy country plans account for US defense and 
diplomatic interests, as well as where those interests overlap with the host nation’s 
objectives (see figure 1). This three-way guidance overlap shapes the parameters of 
advisors’ missions and defines how they will conduct their assigned tasks. The 
strategic picture described in this section is important for advisors on the ground to 
know how their actions impact a wider set of plans and the process by which they 
obtain their legal authorities and funding. 
3. Conceptual Frameworks
This section looks at three frameworks that help advisors execute their missions. 
The frameworks are:  
The PN functions of an organization (governance, executive, generating, and 
operating [G-EGO]) model. 
The advisor planning framework (APF).  
The developmental activities of organize, train, equip, build, advise (OTEBA). 
These models, while still broad, set a more tangible context for the advisor’s daily 
decisions. 
The Functions of a PN Security Force: The G-EGO Model. Foreign security 
force organizations, regardless of type (e.g., military, police, etc.), must be able to 
perform common functions to be viable. See figure 2 for the G-EGO functions. US 
advising efforts can be directed towards supporting any or all of the functions 
performed by a PN security force. Commonly, mission objectives will drive an 
advisor team to focus on one aspect of the G-EGO construct, but problems in one 
function usually impact the others. Therefore, it is good practice to conduct a weekly 
evaluation of what the team has learned about the entire G-EGO construct, 
capturing any current or future problems in a situation report (SITREP). Connecting 
the dots will help refine mission orders and authorities for future missions with FSF.  
Governance Function. The FSF governance function provides the PN 
government the means to organize and set laws and policy to provide necessary 
resources to the FSF. Typical instruments within this function include general law 
and annual authorizations. 
Executive Function. The FSF executive function includes strategic direction 
that provides oversight, policy, and resources for the FSF generating and 
operating functions. 
Generating Function. The FSF generating function refers to the capability 
and capacity of the security force to carryout doctrine, organization, training, 
materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) 
processes, enabling operational formations at the strategic, operational, and 
tactical levels.

Figure 2. Common Functions of a Partner Nation Security Force 
Operating Function. The FSF operating function employs capabilities to 
achieve PN security objectives. This employment can be seen as the tactical, 
operational, and strategic use of security elements, but it also includes the 
planned direction of Ministry of Defense elements using processes similar to the 
strategic documents in the United States. 
Advisors can be employed to support FSF conducting one or more of these 
functions. Most FSF do not perform these functions in the same way as US 
forces, where the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Services perform 
the executive function; the Services perform the generating function; and the 
CCMDs and below perform the operating function. However, every successful 
security force performs these functions in some fashion. 
Large organizations such as a national defense force will create 
organizations with missions that perform a function for the entire force (similar to 
the way Training and Doctrine Command performs most of the generating 
function for the US Army). For each function, someone will ultimately be 
responsible for integrating all of the processes, subordinates will manage the 
individual processes, and their subordinates will carry out the work. An APF was 
developed to illustrate this hierarchy within the functions. 
Note: For additional information on G-EGO Core processes, see JP 3-20.

15 June 2023 
Advisor Planning Framework 
The APF provides a tool for advisors to understand how they are aligned 
within the executive, generating, and operating functions of FSF. Subsequently, 
this tool helps US organizations that are supporting advisor missions (e.g., 
Service headquarters) select and train/sustain advisors for on-going and future 
operations.  
The APF enables commanders and planners to match advisors based on 
their capabilities and experience to specific counterparts within the G-EGO 
functions of FSF. The APF provides the advisor category and position 
descriptions (characteristics and skill sets) associated with each category.  
Note: For more information on the APF, see JP 3-20. 
(a) Principal Advisors are aligned to FSF principals. FSF principals are
elected or appointed civilian or uniformed officials that have the authority to
direct a particular organization(s) and allocate resources to an organization(s)
as appropriate. They may or may not be experts in all the processes of their
function, but they must know how the processes are linked, what they
produce, and what resources the processes need. The authority of an FSF
principal pertains to the individual having the power to employ processes or
organizations to satisfy certain ends. They typically derive their power from
law or policy.
(b) Process Advisors are aligned to FSF process owners. FSF process
owners are appointed civilian or uniformed officials who are the primary
leaders of processes in each of the G-EGO functions. Process owners should
be experts in the performance of their process. Typically, FSF process
owners derive their authority from a principal. Process owners have the
primary responsibility for organizing, manning, training, equipping, and
employing a process to fulfill its primary purpose.
(c) Subject matter advisors are aligned to technical FSF subject matter
experts (SMEs). Technical SMEs are civilian or uniformed personnel who are
organized within a process in each of the G-EGO functions of FSF. System
FSF SMEs operate systems or perform tasks within their process. A system is
any process, weapon, vehicle, aircraft, or equipment that fulfills a particular
purpose. These FSF individuals operate in teams such as a squad, platoon,
or section and perform mission-essential/critical tasks.
Irrespective of the advisory function, advisors may have one or more 
counterparts. Each counterpart may fall under more than one category. For 
example, a brigade commander is a principal while commanding the brigade and 
must integrate command and control (C2), fires, maneuver, intelligence, 
information, logistics, and protection. At the same time, in the eyes of the division 
commander, the brigade commander could be a process owner for fires. 
In some cases, advisors may have sole responsibility to integrate other 
process and subject matter advisors as part of a broader advising effort. For 
example, an advisor team could include a principal advisor, process advisor, and 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
7 
several subject matter advisors that provide the necessary skills to assess and 
influence the development of a particular FSF counterpart(s). 
As figure 3 illustrates, G-EGO and APF work together to ensure depth and 
breadth in the advising mission. For example, the governance function has 
principals, process owners, and SME personnel in roles typically performed by the 
DOS or United States Agency for International Development (USAID) advisors to 
ensure the right capability is applied to the right PN need. For all other functions, 
DOD advisors may be the appropriate capability for principal, process, and subject 
matter advisors. 
Figure 3. The Advisor Planning Framework (Using the G-EGO Functions) 
Advisors should not fall into the trap of equating the mission of a partner 
organization as its sole function that the organization performs. Every organization 
must be organized, manned, trained, equipped, led, and resourced to perform its 
primary purpose. Ultimately, all FSF organizations need to be able to plan, execute, 
and assess tasks and missions. The G-EGO functions of FSF provide organizational 
and operational solutions for each type of FSF organization. See Chapter VII, 
Assessments, for FSF organizational, operational, and institutional assessments. 
Developmental Activities. The DOD has grouped the developmental activities 
(i.e., OTEBA) under the term security force assistance (SFA). SFA is defined as the 
DOD activities that support the development of the capacity and capability of FSF 
and their supporting institutions. While the DOD can organize, train, equip, and build 
as the situation requires, it much prefers to advise PN counterparts as they carry out 
those activities. The definitions of the OTEBA developmental tasks are: 
Organize. This includes all activities taken to create, improve, and integrate 
doctrinal principles, organizational structures, capability constructs, and 
8 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
personnel management. This may include doctrine development, unit or 
organization design, command and staff processes, and recruiting and staffing 
functions. 
Train. This includes all activities taken to create, improve, and integrate 
training, leadership development, and education at the individual, leader, 
collective, and staff levels. This may include task analysis, program of instruction 
development and execution, training event implementation, and leadership 
development activities. 
Equip. This includes all activities needed to integrate materiel and equipment 
solutions into the FSF. Equipping the FSF usually includes procurement, fielding, 
accountability, and maintenance through life cycle management of all major end 
items, as well as forecasting, procuring, and distributing all classes of supply. 
Equipping the FSF requires a holistic approach that includes not only fielding of 
new equipment, but also operational readiness processes, maintenance 
management, repair, and recapitalization, which is accomplished through foreign 
military sales. Advisors deployed to support FSF with foreign military sales 
operate under the authorities defined in Title 22, United States Code (USC), 
Foreign Relations and Intercourse. 
Build. This includes all activities taken to create, improve, and integrate 
facilities and supporting infrastructure. This may include working on bases and 
stations, lines of communication, ranges and training complexes, and 
administrative structures. 
Advise. This includes all activities taken to provide subject matter expertise, 
guidance, advice, and counsel to FSF while carrying out the missions assigned 
to the unit or organization. Advising may occur under combat or administrative 
conditions, at tactical through strategic levels, and in support of individuals or 
groups. Activities such as assessment, provision of materiel assistance, and 
liaison with US or coalition enabling capabilities may all be inherent in advising 
FSF. 
If DOD is organizing, training, equipping, or building, it is temporarily performing 
the generating activities, in part or in total, for the PN. DOD performs these same 
activities using the same processes (DOTMLPF) to develop its own forces. 
However, DOD does not advise its own forces. Based on DOD’s overall size, the 
long-standing performance of its generating function, and the requirement for senior 
leaders to develop their own subordinates through mentorship, advising is not 
inherent to all organizations in the force. It is for this reason that the art of advising 
FSF must be taught. 
Note: During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, units were told to train, advise, and assist. 
Later, during Operation INHERENT RESOLVE, the units were tasked to train and equip 
or advise and assist. This MTTP differentiates train and advise as two distinct tasks that 
share some common characteristics. This distinction will be developed further in this 
publication. 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76

In regards to development, it is important for an advisor to understand the 
difference between capability and capacity. The definitions are as follows: 
Capability. The ability to complete a task or execute a course of action 
under specified conditions and level of performance. That is, the ability of FSF 
or their supporting institutions to execute a given task under specified 
conditions. 
Capacity. The maximum extent (scale, scope, and duration: parameters) to 
which a task can be performed. Capacity can be viewed as the measurable 
aspects of a capability.  
Advisors should use the G-EGO, APF, and developmental activities frameworks 
described in Section 3 to ensure they are covering the range of partner needs with 
the right solutions and personnel. Advisors should periodically compare weekly 
activities with the frameworks to ensure they are not drifting off course. 
4. Force Suitability
When employing advisors, CCDRs assign advisors to FSF principals (e.g., chief 
of defense, commander), process owners (e.g., human resource management, 
doctrine, sustainment, etc.), and SME personnel (e.g., weapon system operator). 
These assignments are based on specific needs within one or more G-EGO 
functions of FSF and their supporting institutions. CCDRs may employ a 
combination of uniformed, civilian, or contractor personnel/teams to carry out 
advising within FSF. In some cases, a CCDR may align specific units to advise FSF 
operational formations such as SOF or the US Army security force assistance 
brigade (see figure 4).  
10 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
Figure 4. Partner Nation Mission Impact on Advisor Selection 
Based on a CCMD’s advisor utilization, supporting organizations such as Service 
headquarters then select and train personnel or teams to meet these requirements. 
Other organizations such as the Defense Security Cooperation Agency follow a 
similar process when selecting and training ministry of defense advisor personnel. 
Units such as SOF and conventional force units like the security force assistance 
brigade consider advising as a mission-essential task and are organized, trained, 
and equipped to advise FSF operational formations. 
Previous advisor experience is an enabler but not necessarily transferable 
beyond a given G-EGO function of FSF. For example, an advisor who has previous 
experience advising operational formations of FSF may not have the requisite 
knowledge and skills to advise within the executive or generating functions of FSF. 
However, in all cases, core advisor skills (e.g., teach, coach, advise) remain 
constant regardless of where an advisor is aligned within the G-EGO functions.  
Considerations for selecting the right person (or people) for an advisor position 
are not that simple. Commanders and planners should use caution when selecting 
an advisor solely on availability. Obviously, availability is a factor in selection, but, 
more importantly, the advisor must have experience in the subject to be advised, a 
willingness to do the job, and some training on advising. 
Most US military personnel are well trained to function in their specialty in an 
operational unit, but considerably fewer have experience with organizations that 
predominately perform a generating (DOTMLPF) or executive (policy) function. 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
11 
Selecting by rank and military skill identifier does not guarantee a match; one must 
consider past assignments as well. Even for operational units, there is some overlap 
and trade-off based on the counterpart’s role and mission. Figure 4 depicts how the 
selection of advisors may change for the same FSF unit based on the mission the 
unit is performing.  
5. Common Roles
The roles of an advisor team are defined by the authority under which that team 
deploys. Advisors deployed under the authorities of Title 10, USC, Armed Forces, 
will have different restrictions than personnel deploying under one of the authorities 
of Title 22, USC. The request for forces (RFF) will specify the authority with an 
events list detailing the assigned mission per each authority. A judge advocate may 
be helpful in understanding the parameters of an advising team’s RFF. 
In practice, advisors commonly serve multiple roles. Figure 5 identifies the most 
common roles associated with being a US advisor. Advisors must be aware of 
mission creep and avoid exceeding the limitations of their assigned mission, which 
are defined by the allocation of operational authorities and permissions. For 
example, conducting tasks such as logistical support may actually exceed the 
defined mission as specified in the RFF and the event list. Thus, it is important for 
advisors to maintain a clear focus within their mission parameters.

15 June 2023 
Figure 5. Common Advisor Roles 
Advisors are often assigned to perform all four roles noted below with little 
consideration for the added demands on the advisor team (see appendix A for an 
example of an advisor team checklist). A brief description is provided in the following 
paragraphs to differentiate the functions of the common roles. 
Advising Role. The primary advising role can be broken down into three 
developmental tasks: teach, coach, and advise. Sometimes, advisors mistakenly 
believe they only need to provide sound advice. This might be true when they are 
working with a highly capable and well-developed counterpart. Normally, the 
advisor must rapidly transition between the developmental tasks of teach, coach, 
and advise. The definitions for each follow.  
Note: Personnel assigned with just the Train task are only responsible for instructing 
and coaching and are deliberately precluded from providing advice. Personnel assigned 
the Advise task have the latitude to teach and coach where necessary in addition to 
providing advice. Personnel tasked with Train and Advise should expect to conduct 
formal training such as instructing a course and providing advice to help the partner use 
their skills to solve real world problems. The Services do not title their personnel 
performing these tasks in a standard way. The Services use various methods such as 
the qualification level of the personnel, unit designation, or the mission’s assigned task. 
This can cause confusion such as when a certified advisor is sent on a Train mission. 
(a) Teaching means to provide training, education, or both to FSF to develop
skills or knowledge necessary to execute a particular task. Training is
instructing personnel to enhance their capability to perform specific military
functions and tasks, or exercising one or more military units to enhance their
combat readiness.
Teaching conveys concepts and knowledge that can be applied over a
broad range of situations.
The advisor must be ready to teach and coach skills, concepts, and
knowledge.
A teacher is responsible for ensuring that individuals and organizations
are capable of conducting a task or series of tasks through education and
training, under clearly defined, observable, and measurable activities or
actions accomplished in either an individual or collective setting.
A teacher is also responsible for evaluating and assessing the learned
skills and developing courses of action (COAs) to slow down, reinforce, or
move forward based on FSF performance.
(b) Coaching is helping a counterpart attain and sustain maximum potential
by practicing those skills or building on previous instruction. The distinctive
feature is the recipient assumes more responsibility for success than when
being taught, while the advisor gives assistance as required. Coaches help
the unit to understand what is holding back performance and develop training
plans to improve and maintain skills. Teaching would be training to standard,
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
13 
while coaching would be pushing the student beyond the standard and toward 
maximizing individual and unit potential. Even highly performing organizations 
will employ coaches in order to reach or maintain their maximum potential. 
(c) Advising means to provide the advisor’s counterparts with expert
opinions, advice, or counsel to assist them in decision-making based on
applying knowledge through a mutually developed bond of trust to solve real
world problems. The distinctive feature is the recipient is responsible for
making the decision and for its consequences, while the advisor provides only
advice. Confusion exists regarding the difference between trainers and
advisors. Unfortunately, when these two terms are used as position titles,
their duties are blurred, and they are often used as synonyms. However, the
tasks of training and advising are distinct, and the chain of command’s failure
to clearly define positions and responsibilities can result in operating beyond
the team’s authority. The distinction is trainers focus on teaching and
coaching, whereas advisors teach, coach, and advise (see the previous note
for differences with regard to Service definitions of these responsibilities). US
forces are familiar with training. US training is conducted by instructors and
unit leaders. The advisor can perform as a trainer when only teaching and
coaching are permitted by mission authorities. The trainer’s responsibility
ends with the completion of the training. From that point on, FSF leaders are
responsible for improving and maintaining skills and proficiency. Additionally,
during employment, the leader is expected to make all the decisions. When
working with FSF, the training task equates to teaching and coaching to
improve skills, whereas the advising task supports the FSF’s leaders in
making decisions by providing sound advice. FSF leaders are responsible for
training their own unit and leading it as it operates. Trainers and advisors both
must have the ability to communicate with their counterparts, but it is the
advisor who is directly tied to helping the FSF achieve specific mission
objectives. Chapter III discusses specific skills needed for advisor proficiency.
Capability Support to FSF. In a support role, advisors or advisor teams may 
be expected to provide actual capabilities to the FSF. This will require additional 
personnel with specific expertise and equipment to accomplish the mission. 
Depending upon available resources and priorities, only a portion of the FSF 
support needs are likely to be met. Rarely are resources available to meet all the 
support needs, so advisors must develop a plan to identify, prioritize, and 
maximize available resources and mitigate shortfalls. To ensure legality and 
sustainability, the advisor must have the answer to seven critical questions prior 
to entertaining the FSFs’ requests for support. They are: 
(a) What does the RFF or deployment order state?
(b) Has authorization been given (by law, executive order, or some other
competent authority) to take contemplated action, and has it been funded?
(c) Do policies, rules of engagement (ROE), etc. authorize action to be
taken?
14 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
(d) What legal and other limitations are in place for accomplishing the
mission or assigned task?
(e) Does the FSF really need specific material or capability to accomplish the
mission, and what would be the impact if not sourced?
(f) Is there any way the FSF could procure or acquire this resource or
capability using their own systems, processes, or methods?
(g) Are there mechanisms in place for the FSF to sustain this system or
capability over the long term?
Liaison Officer (LNO). It is a normal practice, especially in the case of 
multinational operations, for units that are working in close coordination to 
exchange LNOs. However, if advisors are assigned to that unit, the advisor team 
is often required to facilitate communication between themselves and other 
elements to ensure a mutually shared understanding and unity of purpose and 
action. Liaison is the most commonly employed technique for establishing and 
maintaining close, continuous, physical communication between supporting and 
supported units of action such as an advisor team. LNOs must be able to 
understand, interpret, and convey their commander’s vision, intent, mission, 
concept of operations, guidance, and the FSF daily operations cycle. See 
appropriate Service doctrine for more information on LNOs. 
Advisors may be required to serve in various organizations from PN ministries to 
the squad level. When deployed supporting FSF, advisors will normally be 
operational control to a CCDR and may be further delegated to a Service component 
(such as the Army Service component command); advisors will normally be tactical 
control to their Service component. The actual command relationship is specified in 
the RFF. 
6. Overview Conclusion
This chapter has served as a broad overview of topics that apply to the advisor and 
those leaders employing advisors at a variety of levels ranging from strategic to tactical. 
The discussions included the processes and authorities that drive advisor mission sets, 
the frameworks within which advisors operate, and the various advisor roles. These 
topics set the foundation for the remainder of this advising MTTP, where advisor 
planning, attributes, applications, methodology, and functions will be discussed. We 
now take a look at the unique planning considerations of advisor missions.

Chapter II 
ADVISOR PREDEPLOYMENT PLANNING AND PREPARATION 
CONSIDERATIONS 
“Plans are nothing, planning is everything.” 
—Dwight D. Eisenhower 
1. Introduction
This chapter will highlight the points of emphasis in planning that are unique to 
advising missions. However, it is not a full lesson on planning that covers topics 
found in various other doctrine sources.  
Advising missions have unique planning considerations because, whereas 
conventional deployments are accompanied by a sufficient complement of enabler 
and staff support to do mission analysis, advisor missions—based on location, 
nature, and the small number of personnel typically assigned to advisor units—tend 
to require that the advisor teams conduct the majority of the data collection 
and analysis independently. The purpose of this chapter is to alert advisors to the 
nuances of those planning aspects and better prepare them for meaningful problem 
framing and mission planning. 
2. Collection and Consolidation of Planning Data
Sources and Methods of Data Collection. 
Plan to Plan. Before diving into planning, team leadership should map out the 
planning process to ensure that preparation activities follow a logical flow, and 
the team gets the most out of each one. This plan will include determining how, 
when, and with whom the team will communicate internally and externally; how 
data will be marked and retained; and what the best sequencing and timing is for 
video teleconferences versus on-the-ground site visits. 
(a) Table 1 provides a tool for team leadership to choose the best means for
communicating during predeployment activities. Leadership should ensure
the appropriate level of operations security is considered prior to
implementing any means of communication.

(b) Data collection and assessments of the mission and FSF begin
immediately upon receiving the mission. One of the principal determinants of
how to approach this data collection is whether the mission is episodic or
persistent. Persistent engagements provide a great opportunity to transition
advisor teams while minimizing the loss in momentum of the overall mission.
In this case, advisors will want to take advantage of the US counterpart the
team has on the ground to answer questions, verify assessments, share best
practices, and maintain updated awareness all the way through the team’s
arrival. In the case of an episodic engagement, the team does not have a
counterpart with which to discuss the mission and environment, and finding a
Service member with any direct knowledge of the mission may be difficult. It
is in these instances that the margin for error in making good use of the
touchpoints and visits the team has with the FSF and the country team is
significantly reduced.
(c) When considering how a team’s collection efforts will be captured,
advisors must have a mechanism to consolidate and organize the data so all
personnel involved can track and account for mission data, when needed, to
facilitate preparation activities. Technology today allows advisors to share
information more rapidly with all participants to ensure a clear understanding
of the mission and, most importantly, the what, when, where, why, and how
they should participate.
(d) Once the mission is received, the team needs to establish its task
organization, ensuring all leader and staff roles, as well as warfighting
functions, are covered by the team. This will also allow the team to interact
with the higher headquarters staff and establish a point of contact (POC) for
each pertinent functional area. The team should also establish its mission
folder that manages planning products and supports, at a minimum, the
following:
Utilizing a web-based system that is accessible with the appropriate
encryption devices while traveling or conducting the mission.
1.
Folders organized by staff functions.
2.
Base documents such as the deployment order, mission
letters, ROE, country team requirements, and terms of reference
are collected as the guiding documents for the mission.

Displaying POCs with contact information.
Creating hyperlinks to key web sites that support planning and

3.

4.

Accessing standardized formats, checklists, and SOPs; providing
examples to ensure data submitted is in accordance with guidance/intent.
Accessing other recommended reading materials.
Providing a request for information/tasking format and file for team to
submit internally/externally.
Identifying Country Team Requirements. Country teams have various entry 
requirements that the team must identify early. These may include special visa 
requirements; visit requests through the US embassy; survival, evasion, 
resistance, and escape instruction; and travel coordination measures. The 
Service component command (SCC) should be able to provide a list of 
requirements for the PN and assist the team in completing the requirements. 
However, it is the team’s responsibility to plan the time necessary for training and 
the administration of these requirements. 
Task Organization and Force Mix Selection. The RFF and its associated 
events list detail the force structure needed as envisioned by the CCDR to 
successfully accomplish the mission. Prior to final RFF and event list publication, 
the advisor-providing force and the SCC within the combatant command (e.g., 
US Naval Forces, Central Command) should discuss and define the force 
structure needed to accomplish the advising mission. This is the providing unit’s 
opportunity to establish the size (capacity) and kind (capability) of force required 
to achieve mission objectives. Wargaming the various advising activities on the 
events list against the RFF force structure will illuminate the capacity and 
capability gaps in the mission. The final RFF and event list specifies the force 
structure allowed for the advising mission.  
Legal Considerations. Law and policy govern the actions of US forces in all 
military operations. For US forces to conduct operations, a legal basis must exist. 
This legal basis profoundly influences many aspects of the operation and can 
constrain the advisor team’s ability to do certain things. These constraints must 
18 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
be considered in the very early phases of planning. The following paragraphs 
provide a summary of key laws and policies that bear upon US military 
operations in support of advising.  
Note: This summary does not replace a consultation with the unit’s supporting staff 
judge advocate. 
(a) Legal Authority for Security Force Assistance or Security Cooperation
Activities. Programs under Title 22, USC, authorize security assistance,
developmental assistance, and other forms of aid. Title 10, USC, authorizes
certain types of military-to-military contacts, exchanges, exercises, and limited
forms of humanitarian and civic action coordinated with the US ambassador
to the PN. Under these legal codes, cooperation and assistance are limited
and do not include direct involvement in operations.
(b) International Law and Treaties. Advisors must understand and abide by
all applicable laws and treaties. The staff judge advocate should be contacted
for more information.
(c) Planners must identify necessary authorities (including status-of-forces
agreement [SOFA], technical agreements, or other legal arrangements),
requirements for interaction and liaison, and the option for predeployment of
key enablers.
(d) In addition to the planning imperatives, other factors should be
considered to achieve the best outcome, such as respect of the law,
transparency, and the full incorporation of security forces into the legal
framework of justice and the rule of law. These additional factors emphasize
the importance of incorporating nonmilitary actors, as a part of a
comprehensive approach, into the planning process for the overall benefit of
the campaign.
(e) When planning partnered operations, a number of factors must be
incorporated into the advisor planning process. One of the key factors is the
legal aspect, either based on CCDR directives and orders, international
agreements (e.g., North Atlantic Treaty Organization-to-partner nation
agreements), existing laws (e.g., the law of war), or along national caveats
and restrictions. All may restrict or influence the forces conducting FSF in
areas such as:
Use of force
Intelligence sharing
Balance of operations security, force protection, and synchronization
Targeting
Handling of opponents or hostile actors
Provision of medical support to host nation security forces (including
medical evacuation)

(f) Medical rules of eligibility should be utilized within legal and ethical
constraints, as well as PN capabilities and objectives, to ensure that the
advisor’s mission is accomplished in the best and most sustainable possible
way.
(g) Advisors must know the rule of law and comply so that they do not have a
negative impact on the mission and all that has been gained by potentially
being “the ugly American.” This is tied directly to knowing, understanding, and
embracing PN narratives and culture.
Risk. Risks to force and mission are familiar to every trainee that has served in 
the US military. For advisors, these risks are still present, but political risk now 
becomes a more tangible concern. US advisors tend to have more visibility and 
interact with local nationals of greater prominence than line units, so the effects of a 
miscalculation in these interactions has a much greater impact. To illuminate the 
various risk factors, advisors probe with a series of questions such as: 
Risk to Mission 
Has the predeployment site survey (PDSS) confirmed the level of leader
and unit proficiency in core tasks or competencies?
Is there a risk in trying to achieve the team’s goal in the allotted time?
Is there risk to the relationship if we hold back and do not achieve the
next set of target objectives?
Is there risk in making FSF take on more of an ownership role?
Risk to Force 
What criminal or terrorist elements exist in the country, what are their
means of violence, and what are their patterns?
How can the team identify threat actors and their connectors?
What is the history on US advisor interaction with threat actors?
Political Risk 
How are US forces and citizens perceived in the country and what
triggers may exist for conflict between the team and the population?
What are the indicators of increased tension?
What third country actors are operating in the PN? How?
Mitigating risk does not solely pertain to training when FSF members are 
involved. It also includes what advisors do when no one is looking to prevent a 
breakdown in rapport and to continue the mission. These questions aid advisors in 
identifying friendly vulnerabilities and critical threats to their operation. This ensures 
that during planning, commanders have the information from the advisor’s 
perspective to assess risk as an element of operational design. The commander’s 
responsibility is to only approve the plan with an acceptable level of risk across all 
elements of the advisor mission.

3. Assessment
To inform decision making, joint forces carrying out SFA developmental activities 
(recall OTEBA tasks from Chapter I) use the operational assessment, which starts 
with the planning initiation step of the joint planning process (JPP). The operational 
assessment activities of monitor, evaluate, recommend, and direct inform and are 
informed by SFA planning, execution, and assessment at the strategic, operational, 
and tactical levels. CCMDs, SCCs, and theater special operations commands 
(TSOCs) use the operational assessment to strengthen and reinforce DOD 
assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (AM&E) policy and guidelines. For more 
information on each operational assessment activity, see Chapter VII, Assessments. 
Advisors can use the results of a CCMD and SCC operational assessment to 
inform their predeployment planning and preparation such as devising their own 
assessment plan.  
During execution, advisors can update their assessment plan in concert with 
their counterparts to monitor (observe and analyze), evaluate (judge), make 
recommendations, and, when appropriate, advise their counterpart to direct 
changes to FSF measures of performance (MOPs) and measures of 
effectiveness (MOEs).  
Assessment Plan. Determining effectiveness is a complex issue for the 
advisor. However, it plays a critical role in (1) linking advisor tasks to the desired 
end state and (2) understanding the effects advisor engagements have with the 
PN (see the callout below from JP 5-0, Joint Planning). Effectiveness applies to 
both internal and external factors.  
Internal effectiveness looks at the 
advisors themselves and how well their 
actions and engagement with the PN 
progress team, FSF, and strategic 
objectives.  
External effectiveness looks at the PN 
and seeks to determine how well they 
implement and execute implied, specified, 
essential, and critical tasks, objectives, and 
standards through interaction, instruction, 
coaching, and advising by the advisor team. 
Indicators can be utilized when trying to 
determine internal or external effectiveness. 
JP 5-0 describes indicators as a specific 
piece of information that infers the condition, 
state, or existence of something and 
provides a reliable means to ascertain 
performance or effectiveness. Indicators 
should be relevant, observable/collectable, responsive, and resourced. 
Effectiveness is defined as the degree 
to which something is successful in 
producing a desired result. It refers to 
the level of quality with which a task or 
process is carried out that ultimately 
leads to overall performance or 
completion that can be attained and 
measured. 
Efficiency is defined as the ability to 
accomplish something with the fewest 
resources (least amount of wasted time, 
money, effort, etc.).  
The relationship between effectiveness 
and efficiency is that effectiveness is a 
measure of ’goodness’ of output, while 
efficiency is a measure of the resources 
required to achieve the output. Thus, 
effectiveness of the system refers to the 
quality of outputs from the system.

The indicators the advisor needs to be most familiar with are the MOPs and 
MOEs. These will be utilized differently depending on the environment and event 
type. MOPs and MOEs are also not constrained to the internal and external factors 
described here, but are utilized to understand the operational environment (OE) 
during the monitoring phase of AM&E. They are also invaluable in informing 
operational assessments at the tactical and operational levels, and functional 
evaluation at the strategic level.  
MOPs are indicators used to assess partner actions tied to measuring task 
accomplishment. MOPs commonly reside in task execution matrices and confirm or 
deny proper task performance. MOPs help answer the question: “Are we doing 
things right?” “Was the action taken?” or “Was the task completed to standard?” 
(Source JP 5-0). 
MOEs are indicators used to help measure a current system with change 
indicated by comparing multiple observations over time to gauge the achievement of 
objectives and attainment of end states. MOEs help answer the question, “Are we 
doing the right things to create the effects or changes in the conditions of the OE 
that we desire?” (Source JP 5-0). 
MOEs/MOPs during Training. Advisor training operations are generally 
well-suited for clearly defined tasks, conditions, and standards that can be 
deliberately planned for and assessed. Advisors should ensure that operations are 
planned with appropriate MOEs and MOPs to report the completion of training for a 
specific student audience.  
MOEs/MOPs during Advising. Advising tasks present a unique challenge when 
determining MOEs or MOPs. A deep understanding of the OE is required to predict 
and validate the causal relationship between an advisor’s presence and advice 
versus the intended tactical or operational effects. 
Developing these measures is an art. Different types of assessments require 
different measures, which can lead decision makers, commanders, and advisors at 
different levels to different conclusions. Commanders may favor MOPs because they 
are more easily measured and yield empirical answers and pay inadequate attention 
to MOEs. The following guidelines can help substantiate the assessment data from 
where they are derived. (For more information, see the Operations and Planning 
Annex of JP 3-0, Joint Campaigns and Operations.) 
Measures should be relevant and necessary. 
Measures should represent a scale, not a goal or objective. 
The data satisfying a measure should be observable or at least inferable. 
Measures should be clear and concise. 
The entire plan or strategy should be measured, even if multiple measures 
need to be used. 
Recommending or Directing Action. Advisors must continually monitor and 
evaluate—these are considered critical activities. However, an assessment is 
22 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
incomplete without any recommendation or direct action taken. Regardless of the 
planning process, assessments can diagnose problems, but unless the assessment 
results in suggested adjustments, its use to the team is limited. Based on the 
evaluation of progress, the team brainstorms likely improvements to the plan and 
makes preliminary judgments about the relative merit of identified changes. Team 
members identify those changes possessing sufficient merit and provide them as 
recommendations to the team leader or higher headquarters, or make necessary 
adjustments within their delegated authority. 
Assessments are ongoing. It is important to note that assessments on the 
environment and the FSF begin the moment the mission is received. To gain 
situational awareness most efficiently, advisors must exploit every touchpoint to 
obtain the best information as stated throughout this chapter.  
Prior to a mission, these touchpoints include the existing information on a 
mission (the assessments and after action reviews [AARs] of previous teams), 
SITREPs from ongoing missions, the team’s PDSS, direct liaison authority with the 
deployed team and specific others, and the team advanced echelon party. The 
team’s information gathering should include verifying existing assessments, which 
can be a heavy task if the mission is episodic and the FSF has not partnered with 
advisors recently.  
Critical to the assessment process is developing an assessment plan. Advisors 
and supporting staffs integrate and develop an assessment plan within their planning 
process. As the advisor team and staff begin mission analysis, they must also 
determine how to measure forward progress in meeting the intended end state. 
Teams and staffs develop assessment plans when appropriate.  
Effective assessment incorporates both measurable (observation-based) and 
subjective (judgment-based) indicators. A balanced assessment relies upon both 
human judgment (subjective), which requires critical thinking, and direct observation 
and mathematical accuracy (objective), as observables alone can be misleading. 
The following paragraphs discuss some considerations for approaching 
assessments. 
Assessment Considerations. 
Step 1: Gather Tools and Assessment Data. Planning begins with receipt of 
the mission. The receipt of the mission alerts the staffs to begin updating the 
running estimates and gathering the tools necessary for mission analysis and 
continued planning. 
Step 2: Understand Current and Desired Conditions. Fundamentally, 
assessment is about measuring progress toward the desired end state. To do 
this, commanders and staffs compare current conditions in the area of operation 
(AO) against desired conditions. 
Step 3: Develop an Assessment Framework. All plans and orders have a 
general logic. This logic links tasks to subordinate units to the achievement of 
objectives, and the achievement of objectives to attainment of the operation’s 
end state. An assessment framework incorporates the logic of the plan and uses 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
23 
MOEs, MOPs, and indicators as tools to determine accurate and objective 
assessments of proficiency and progress toward attaining desired end state 
conditions. 
Step 4: Develop the Collection Plan. Each indicator represents an 
information requirement. In some situations, staffs feed these information 
requirements into the information-collection synchronization process. Then, staffs 
task information-collection assets to collect on these information requirements. In 
other situations, reports in the unit SOPs may suffice. If not, the unit may develop 
a new report. The assessment plan identifies the source for each indicator as 
well as the staff member who collects that information. 
Step 5: Assign Responsibilities for Analyzing and Generating 
Recommendations. In addition to assigning responsibility for collection, 
commanders assign staff members to analyze assessment data and develop 
recommendations. 
Step 6: Identify Feedback Mechanisms. A formal assessment with 
meaningful recommendations that is not presented to the appropriate decision 
maker wastes time and energy. The assessment plan identifies the who, what, 
when, where, why, and how within the assessment presentation.

Once the designated assessment team develops the assessment plan in support 
of the commander’s intent, it assists the team leader in applying the assessment 
process of monitor, evaluate, recommend, and direct continuously throughout the 
preparation and execution phases. 
4. In Review
Leading the process of preparing for an advising mission comes down to effective 
leadership. Advisor team leaders must set the tone for team members to 
comprehend the OE, effectively collaborate with various entities, and measure the 
progress of the FSF and the broader mission partners to ensure the right application 
of advising with the right timing throughout the mission. Leaders on the team should 
remember that while preparing their team to be great partners for FSF, they should 
not forget to sharpen their “shoot, move, communicate, medicate, and survive” skills. 
This chapter explored the points of emphasis that are important for advisors to 
keep in mind as they plan and prepare for their missions. Highlighting these portions 
of mission analysis helps advisors better focus the resources and time of their teams 
in order to ensure the most important information is developed first.  
Country team requirements, legal considerations, risk, and assessments were 
also reviewed during this discussion on planning. Each is important for advisors in 
understanding their left and right limits and evaluating their plans. It is within this 
context that advisors will apply the principles and skills that appear in the next 
chapter.

Chapter III 
ADVISOR PRINCIPLES AND SKILLS 
“Win and keep the confidence of your leader. Strengthen his prestige at your 
expense before others when you can. Never refuse or quash schemes he may 
put forward; but ensure they are put forward in the first instance, privately, to you. 
Always approve them, and after praise modify them sensibly, causing the 
suggestions to come from him, until they are in accord with your own opinion. 
When you attain this point, hold him to it, keep a tight grip of his ideas, and push 
them forward as firmly as possible, but secretly, so no one but [him] (and he not 
too clearly) is aware of your pressure.” 
—T.E. Lawrence, August 1917 
Advisors in El Salvador 
SOF Advisor Teams were tasked at the end of the El Salvadorian conflict to 
assist in the reconstruction phase by building schools in various key districts that 
were ravaged by war. One team was tasked at the last minute and deployed on 
short notice to the most contested area. The team was given a blueprint, a fund, 
a timeline, and a link-up plan with US personnel at the arrival airfield. From there, 
the team was authorized to send only two personnel as their advanced echelon, 
and it was this two-man team which set the conditions to accomplish the mission. 
Because the team had been to El Salvador on a prior mission, it had a clear 
understanding of the culture, history, and tensions within the operational 
environment. The FSF that the team fell in on was now a military unit that was a 
mix of both former Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and El 
Salvadorian soldiers who—up to this point—had fought each other and now were 
in the same military unit tasked to support the advisor team while building a 
school. This was also the same area where the only US SOF Soldier was killed 
during an attack on a nearby fort. 
Through critical and creative thinking, and hitting the ground running on day one, 
the advisors multi-tasked and worked into the night to set up their team house 
and construct the rebar outline to pour the school’s foundation. The team was 
prepared the next day for opening ceremony. In spite of short notice, and 
because of the team’s understanding of the operational environment, as well as 
knowing and embracing the language and culture, the team was able to defuse 
any issues between the FSF’s El Salvadorian and FMLN elements rapidly 
through team building, rapport, and treating all as equals, and thus finished the 
school on time in accordance with set constraints. 
It is important to note the team’s efforts outside of the mission to build trust, 
credibility, and rapport with the FSF and local population: throughout the mission, 
the team on its own initiative would go into town and assist the locals with food 
procurement, purchasing construction materials from multiple vendors, providing 
food and ice cream for the orphanage, and repairing a roof for an elderly woman 
26

all in front of the FMLN headquarters in the center of town which earned 
acceptance and recognition from the FMLN leadership. 
By clearly understanding the operational environment prior to the mission and 
embracing the situation, the advisor team was easily able to navigate political 
risk, risk to mission, and risk to force. The team overcame all situations that could 
have been catastrophic to the success of the mission and the country’s overall 
ability to recover. 
—Command Sergeant Major (Ret.) Frank Browski, March, 2021 
1. Principles of Advising
This chapter includes the behaviors and mindsets that advisors must express every day 
to achieve the kind of success that Command Sergeant Major (Ret.) Browski’s team 
achieved in El Salvador. The principles in subparagraphs a through j come from a 
collection of experiences and lessons learned by advisors. Table 3 is an example of 
advisor imperatives complemented by those principles. 
Examples of Advisor Imperatives 
Understand the operational environment. 
Operate with and through others. 
Consider long-term effects. 
Develop cross-cultural communication 
and negotiation skills. 
Support legitimacy and credibility. 
Ensure unity of effort and purpose. 
Manage information. 
Balance security and synchronization. 
Demonstrate effective leadership. 
Achieve total force integration. 
Understand the rule of law. 
Advisor Support of the FSF. Advisors only succeed by supporting the success of 
their FSF counterpart. Advisors aim to develop FSF that the local population sees as 
responsible and capable of securing their safety. This legitimacy with the local 
population is the cornerstone of stability. Advisors, at all levels, must focus on 
building FSF legitimacy from the populace as they consider the impact of operations 
on local perception. 
Empathy Leads to Understanding. A US advisor described his tour with an Iraqi 
infantry battalion as a “year-long course in human empathy.” Empathy can be 
defined as identifying with and understanding another’s situation, feelings, 
perspectives, and motives.  
Cross-cultural empathy is tough to accomplish and harder to explain, but 
understanding it and overcoming one’s own cultural biases are keys to the 
success of an advisor mission.  
Understanding other human beings and their motivations allows for the 
development of honest relationships, which is a critical factor of success. In most 
cultures, the way to begin understanding another person’s feelings and 
experiences is by understanding the other’s narrative.  
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
27 
The narrative is a collective group’s identity as an interpretation of ancient 
history and recent collective experiences. Delving into the narrative and 
understanding the context and how it affects people are the beginnings of 
empathy. 
Success is Built Upon Personal Relationships. Empathy is not enough. To 
change attitudes or values, advisors must establish a relationship with those whom 
they are tasked to advise. No amount of resources or firepower can compensate for 
a lack of relationship between an advisor and the FSF counterpart. The relationship 
must be honest, genuine, and heartfelt. Mutual respect, trust, and understanding are 
the keys to success. Both parties rely on each other for mission accomplishment and 
survival. The relationship is likely to be tested on numerous occasions, but a solid 
relationship built on mutual trust can survive and promote mission success. 
Furthermore, advisors must learn to pick their battles. Painstakingly built 
camaraderie and rapport can vanish in an instant if one does not prioritize and 
define the boundaries in the FSF relationship. 
Advisors Must Not Lose Their Identity. Living with FSF allows for the 
development of true bonds, empathy, and trust. However, once advisors have 
formed a hard-earned relationship with their counterparts, they must remember they 
are not part of the FSF unit.  
Advisors Never Win; Nor Should They. One of the hardest things for US leaders 
to understand is what success looks like. Progress may occur at a very slow pace 
and may not be tracked on a day-to-day basis. The advisor may achieve a tactical 
objective, but not success. Success is achieved by the FSF habitually meeting the 
objective. Conversely, failure belongs to the advisor. In a more immediate sense, 
advisors likely never please their own Service with regard to the forces they are 
advising, and they never fully satisfy the demands of the FSF unit. Advisors are 
figuratively, and literally, caught in the middle. Advising is the art of striving to make 
a positive situation for all parties.  
Only an FSF plan will succeed, and it will only succeed if it is their plan. 
Advisors Are Not Commanders. Advisors are responsible for the C2 of their own 
small team of US advisors, but they do not command or lead the FSF. Advisors 
provide expert advice and access for the FSF to US or coalition assets. 
Living With Shades of Gray. Advisors should understand all situations will not be 
black and white. They are caught between two cultures, systems, and narratives. 
They must live in the proverbial gray area while maintaining legal, moral, and ethical 
standards. It is likely that advisors will find themselves isolated with great autonomy 
and no supervision. Advisors will have to grow mentally to be comfortable in this 
environment. They will lose sleep at night and question their actions and those of the 
FSF. Under these conditions, they will face moral, ethical, and legal dilemmas on a 
daily basis. An honest self-assessment should be encouraged. Thus, the advisor 
mission calls for leaders of enormous character, moral courage, and sharp intellect. 
Talent is Everything, but Understand Rank. Military forces around the world 
approach rank and prestige in different ways. In some cultures, rank equals 
28 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
experience, nobility, education, or familial ties. Often many militaries have rewarded 
loyalty with promotions, resulting in rank-heavy armies. What is common among all 
militaries, however, is the recognition of talent. The FSF paradox occurs when 
recognized talent takes a back seat to rank. While advisors likely will advise 
counterparts more senior in rank, they must foster relationships and build talent. 
Make Do. Advisors will never have everything they need to succeed; however, 
their creativity makes up the difference between success and failure. 
2. Individual Advisor Skills
“We are still using the age-old approach to our newly acquired problem, and 
professional competence and military know-how are considered as the 
dominating factors in selecting advisors. From a strictly military viewpoint, this is 
a correct determination. 
“On the other hand, empathy on the part of advisors has seldom been formally 
encouraged as a need-to-have personality factor. Advisors who possess both 
empathy and knowledge are rare, indeed, but possessing military knowledge 
alone is not sufficient.” 
—Major Irving C. Hudlin, “Advising the Advisor”, Military Review, 
November 1965 
Advisors need to possess a variety of individual skills to properly perform their 
assigned mission. Initially, advisors should be selected based on subject matter 
expertise. Tactical proficiency, however, does not equate to proficiency as an 
advisor. Modern-day military advisors must be able to teach and advise the FSF. To 
do this, advisors must be knowledgeable and proficient in TTP and have the skills to 
impart knowledge effectively. Beyond this, they have to operate effectively within 
cultural settings that can be very different in behavior and language from their own. 
Some advisors may be required to provide occasional direct support to the FSF 
within their specialty and legal authorities. Advisors should be proficient in basic 
combat, advisor, and situation-specific skills. Figure 6 illustrates these subsets of 
individual skills. 
Figure 6. Individual Advisor Skills 
SME Skills. SME skills are defined as those skills learned through 
experience, education, or training. Selecting someone who does not have the 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
29 
correct subject matter expertise does not automatically result in mission failure, 
but it puts that individual at a severe disadvantage. 
Combat Skills. Common skills (e.g., land navigation or radio operation), 
warrior skills (e.g., weapons proficiency or call for fire procedures), and survival 
skills (e.g., combat lifesaving) are often required by advisors. Combat skills 
should be refreshed during predeployment training, especially when deploying on 
a mission that involves training FSF on combat skills. These skills may be critical 
to an advisor due to the isolated and independent nature of the mission. 
Advisor Skills. Advisor-specific skills fall into two subcategories: 
(a) Enabling Skills. These include understanding human nature,
communicating across cultures, building rapport, influencing, and negotiating.
Successfully employing enabling skills sets the conditions for advisors to
move forward with their mission.
(b) Developing Skills. These are the main advisor tasks of advising,
coaching, and teaching. Advisors use these skills to develop the capabilities
of the FSF.
Situation-specific Skills. These skills are determined based on the OE and 
the specific mission, and include cultural and regional understanding and 
language. 
SME and combat skills are covered in depth throughout Service doctrine and will 
not be expanded upon in this MTTP publication. Care must be taken to understand 
the releasability of US doctrine; advisors should check the distribution statements of 
all doctrine before sharing with FSF. 
3. Understanding Human Behavior
Behavior is driven by three principal factors: basic needs, culture, and 
personality. Understanding how these factors interact allows the advisor self-
awareness, as well as a better awareness of what shapes the behavior of FSF. 
Although advisors cannot change the basic needs of people, the culture of the 
region, or the personality of their counterpart, these principal factors combine to 
create the counterpart’s beliefs, values, and attitudes, which advisors may be able to 
change (see Figure 7, Human Behavior). It is also important to understand that 
counterparts’ personalities and experiences may have caused them to develop 
beliefs, values, and attitudes that are different from the regional culture. 
While human behavior varies around the world in relation to time and culture, 
certain aspects are believed to be constant over long periods of time and across 
very different cultural contexts. Basic needs, the elements that make up a culture, 
and the individuality of people must be taken into consideration wherever the advisor 
is assigned. 
30 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
Figure 7. Human Behavior 
Basic Needs. Despite obvious differences in culture and language, people share 
basic needs. People generally respond to fear and motivation for similar reasons. 
Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory, which expresses common motivating 
factors among all people, supports the concept that people are similar. This theory 
emphasizes humans have certain needs that are unchanging and innate. These 
needs are the same in all cultures and are physical and mental. They are hierarchal, 
meaning some needs are more basic or more powerful than others; and as these 
needs are satisfied, higher needs emerge. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs presents 
human needs as a pyramid with the basic needs at the bottom of the pyramid (see 
figure 8). The basic needs of an individual must be met first and are essential for life 
and health. The higher needs only become important when the lower needs have 
been satisfied. Once an individual has moved upwards to the next level, the needs in 
the lower level will no longer be prioritized. However, if a lower set of needs is no 
longer being met, the individual temporarily reprioritizes those needs by focusing 
attention on the unfulfilled ones. The needs are described as follows. 
Physiological Needs. Physiological needs of the person take precedence. 
These consist mainly of eating, drinking, sleeping, and shelter. Physiological 
needs can control thoughts and behaviors, and cause people to feel sickness, 
pain, and discomfort.

Figure 8. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs 
Safety Needs. When physiological needs are met, the need for safety 
emerges. These include personal and family security, security from violence, 
security against unemployment, health and well-being, and safety against 
accidents and illness. 
Social Needs, Love, and Belonging. After physiological and safety needs are 
fulfilled, the third level of human needs is social. This psychological aspect 
involves emotionally based relationships in general, such as friendship, intimacy, 
and having a supportive and communicative family. Humans need to feel a sense 
of belonging and acceptance. These may come from large social groups (e.g., 
clubs, work, religious groups, professional organizations, sports teams, or gangs) 
or small social connections (e.g., family members, intimate partners, mentors, 
close colleagues, or confidants). People need to love and be loved by others. In 
the absence of these elements, many people become susceptible to loneliness, 
social anxiety, and depression. This need for belonging can often overcome the 
physiological and security needs, depending on the strength of the peer pressure 
(e.g., an anorexic person ignores the need to eat and the security of health for a 
feeling of belonging). 
Esteem Needs. All humans need to have self-esteem, self-respect, and 
respect for others. People have a need for recognition in activities that give a 
sense of contribution. Imbalances at this level can result in low self-esteem. 
People with low esteem often seek respect from others. However, many people 
with low self-esteem are not able to improve their view of themselves simply by 
32 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
receiving fame, respect, and glory externally, but must first accept themselves 
internally. 
Self-actualization. Self-actualization falls into the psychological requirements 
level on Maslow’s pyramid. This is the instinctual need of humans to make the 
most of their abilities and strive to be the best they can. They embrace the facts 
and realities of the world (including themselves) rather than deny or avoid them. 
They are spontaneous in their ideas and actions. These people are creative. 
They are interested in solving problems; this often includes the problems of 
others. Solving problems is often a key focus in their lives. They feel closeness to 
other people and, generally, appreciate life. They have a system of morality fully 
internalized and independent of external authority. They have discernment and 
are able to view all things in an objective manner. In short, self-actualization is 
reaching one’s fullest potential. The advisor wants to identify members of the 
FSF that have achieved self-actualization, because they are powerful influencers 
within the organization. 
Culture. Culture reflects the beliefs, values, attitudes, traditions, customs, and 
norms of a society or group and is addressed as a situation-specific skill. Multiple 
layers of culture affect the counterpart simultaneously, each with their own set of 
norms that may conflict with one another. (Male military personnel may shave while 
their civilian counterparts may not.) While cultures change over time, the advisor has 
to consider how the existing culture shapes the counterparts decisions. Chapter V is 
devoted to the further discussion of culture. 
Personality. While Maslow’s theory shows a commonality among all people, no 
two people are exactly alike. Often people within groups are thought to act and think 
alike under similar circumstances, but this is a false impression. Two biological 
brothers could be raised in the same house under the same conditions and have 
completely opposite personalities. If advisors can identify a few critical aspects of the 
personality of the people with whom they deal, they may be more effective in 
selecting techniques to advise them. At the least, it may help explain the activities of 
individuals when they act differently than their needs or culture would indicate.  
Application. Understanding the needs, culture, and personality of an individual is 
key to building rapport. Building rapport is central to advisor mission 
accomplishment. Advisors must understand themselves through the lenses of the 
previously discussed concepts to identify cultural and personal biases. Conversely, 
with that understanding, advisors must also determine the key personality attributes 
of their counterpart that can be used to influence. The following are five factors 
advisors should assess by speaking with and observing the people with whom they 
come in contact. 
Extroversion Versus Introversion. People with a preference for extroversion 
draw energy from action: they tend to act, then reflect, then act further. If they are 
inactive, their level of energy and motivation tends to decline. Conversely, those 
whose preference is introversion become less energized as they act: they prefer 
to reflect, then act, then reflect again. Extroversion is marked by pronounced 
engagement with the external world. Extroverts enjoy being with people, are full 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
33 
of energy, and often experience positive emotions. They tend to be enthusiastic, 
action-oriented individuals who are likely to say “Yes!” or “Let’s go!” to 
opportunities for excitement. In groups, they like to talk, assert themselves, and 
draw attention to themselves. Introverted people prefer time to reflect to rebuild 
energy. Someone with a clear extroversion preference is not necessarily a party 
animal or a show-off, any more than someone clearly preferring introversion is 
necessarily shy, retiring, and unsociable.  
An introverted person meeting another introverted person may begin a 
conversation with recognition of a shared interest and continue with a rapid 
exchange of data and theories. Introverts lack the social exuberance, energy, 
and activity levels of extroverts. They tend to be quiet, low-key, deliberate, and 
less dependent on the social world. The introvert simply needs less stimulation 
than an extrovert and more time alone. Samples of extroversion-introversion 
questions follow. 
(a) Does the individual like being the center of attention?
(b) Does the individual enjoy meeting (interacting) with lots of people?
(c) Does the individual feel comfortable around people?
(d) Does the individual start most conversations?
(e) Does the individual talk to a lot of different people in a relaxed setting?
(f)
Is the individual quiet around strangers?
(g) Does the individual try to avoid drawing attention to self?
(h) Is the individual reserved when talking?
(i)
Does the individual have little to say?
Sensing Versus Conceptualizing. Sensing versus conceptualizing refers to
how people gather information: sensing (i.e., touch, taste, sight, smell, sound) or 
conceptualizing (i.e., thought or reflection). Sensing versus conceptualizing 
describes a dimension of personality that distinguishes imaginative, creative 
thinking people from the more concrete thinking people. It describes how new 
information is understood and interpreted.  
Individuals with a preference for sensing prefer to trust information in the 
present that is tangible and concrete: information that can be understood by the 
five senses. They tend to distrust hunches that seem to come out of nowhere. 
They prefer to look for detail and facts. For them, the meaning is in the data. 
They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the complex, ambiguous, 
and subtle. Sensing people tend to prefer familiarity over novelty; they are 
conservative and resistant to change.  
On the other hand, those with a preference for conceptualizing tend to trust 
more in abstract or theoretical information. They tend to trust those flashes of 
insight that seem to come from the unconscious mind. The meaning is in how the 
data relates to the wide context or pattern. They tend to hold abstract and 
individualistic beliefs, although their actions may be conforming.  
34 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76

Samples of sensing-conceptualizing questions follow. 
(a) Is the individual full of ideas?
(b) Is the individual quick to understand things?
(c) Does the individual speak with a rich vocabulary?
(d) Does the individual spend time reflecting on things?
(e) Is the individual disinterested in abstract ideas?
(f) Does the individual have difficulty understanding abstract ideas?
Logic Versus Values. Logic versus values refers to value-based or logic-
based decision-making. People making decisions based on either process strive 
to make rational choices based on the data they receive. Those with a 
preference for values reach decisions by empathizing with the stakeholders in a 
situation and weighing it to achieve harmony, consensus, and fit, considering the 
needs of the people involved and unverifiable rules.  
Those with a preference for logic decide things from a detached standpoint 
by measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, and 
consistent, and matching it to a set of verifiable rules. People with a logical 
preference do not necessarily “think better” than their value-based counterparts; 
the opposite preference is considered an equally rational way of coming to 
decisions.  
Similarly, those with a value-based preference are not necessarily more 
emotional than their logic-based peers. Leaving no man behind would be 
considered a values decision rather than a logical decision. It is not logical to lose 
living personnel to recover dead ones. It makes perfect sense based on values.  
Samples of logic-values questions follow. 
(a) Is the individual interested in people?
(b) Does the individual empathize with others?
(c) Is the individual soft hearted?
(d) Does the individual make people feel at ease?
(e) Does the individual take time out for others?
(f)
Is the individual disinterested in other people’s problems?
(g) Does the individual feel little concern for others?
(h) Does the individual insult people?
Contemplative Versus Impulsive. Contemplative versus impulsive concerns
the way impulses are controlled and directed. Impulses are not inherently bad; 
occasionally, time constraints require an immediate decision and acting on the 
first impulse.  
Contemplative individuals tend to avoid trouble and achieve high levels of 
success through purposeful planning and persistence. They are regarded by 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
35 
others as reliable. They can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics. 
Conversely, impulsive people may be criticized for unreliability and failure to 
remain focused. They are praised for their ability to make quick decisions or 
adapt to new situations.  
Samples of contemplative-impulsive questions follow. 
(a) Is the individual always prepared?
(b) Does the individual work to exacting standards?
(c) Does the individual follow a schedule?
(d) Does the individual get chores done right away?
(e) Does the individual like order?
(f) Does the individual pay attention to details?
(g) Does the individual leave belongings lying around?
(h) Does the individual shirk duties?
Consistent Versus Unpredictable. Consistent versus unpredictable refers to
the tendency to follow a set pattern. Those who are highly unpredictable are 
often emotionally reactive. They respond emotionally to events that would not 
usually affect most people, and their reactions tend to be more intense than 
normal. They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening and 
minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. Their negative emotional reactions tend 
to persist for unusually long periods of time, which means they exhibit frequent 
and significant mood swings. These problems in emotional regulation can 
diminish the ability to think clearly, make decisions, and cope effectively with 
stress.  
Conversely, individuals who are consistent are often less easily upset and 
are less emotionally reactive. Samples of consistent-unpredictable questions 
follow. 
(a) Is the individual easily disturbed?
(b) Does the individual change moods a lot?
(c) Is the individual easily irritated?
(d) Is the individual stressed out easily?
(e) Does the individual get upset easily?
(f)
Does the individual worry about things?
(g) Is the individual relaxed most of the time?
(h) Does the individual follow a set pattern?
(i)
Does the individual react the same to similar circumstances?

Implications. The main point is to acknowledge that people from the same 
culture or social group may act differently, but still base their behavior on a 
predictable form or pattern.  
Cultures tend to favor specific personality traits. Advisors need to be aware 
of the personality traits of the cultures in the area in which they are operating, 
and use the factors introduced in this section to evaluate interactions and choose 
wise responses.  
4. Establishing Rapport
This section looks at rapport, its role in advisor missions, possible ways to 
develop adequate rapport to accomplish the mission, and other interpersonal skills 
supporting the advisor’s mission.  
Establishing rapport is the desired method for effective advising. Genuine rapport 
is developed slowly, but can be ruined in an instant by any act that destroys trust.  
Components of Rapport. Rapport is comprised of the following three components: 
Understanding. Understanding is the first component of rapport. It begins 
prior to deployment and may include cultural studies, language training, and FSF 
equipment and doctrine familiarization. Once in country, advisors should continue 
to broaden their understanding by observing and asking questions. 
Respect. Respect is the next component of rapport. It is a reciprocal 
commodity. The FSF counterpart should grow to respect who the advisors are 
(character), what they know, and how they perform. The advisor should look for 
things they respect in their counterpart. The counterpart may not fit the mold of 
US or other nations’ personnel with whom the advisor has previously interacted. 
The counterpart may not have formal training or education, or may even be 
illiterate. The counterpart’s standards may not be the same as the advisor’s. For 
example, a counterpart may have egregious characteristics like corruption, a 
poor attitude toward the profession, or even a lack of basic warrior values, such 
as timeliness.  
(a) Outward displays by advisors should always be respectful. Remaining
respectful is paramount to maintaining a professional and personal rapport,
including when suggesting necessary corrective actions on the part of the
FSF.
(b) Start with the basics and expand over time. There may be additional
factors affecting the counterpart’s willingness and motivation. For example,
counterparts may be placing self, and possibly family, in mortal danger by
accepting their job. They may be proven, fearless warriors, even if they did
not have formal training. In short, there may be traits deserving of respect
even before the relationship matures.
(c) Mutual respect grows through shared experiences, hardships, and
dangers. Advisors should live, eat, and, if authorized, fight with their
counterparts.
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
37 
Trust. Trust is the third critical component of the rapport-building process. 
Trust grows over time and is based on understanding and respect. Building trust 
needs to begin on day one, but it will not mature until later in the relationship. 
There also remains the possibility the advisor’s counterpart may not prove worthy 
of complete trust. In this instance, the advisor may need to constantly mitigate 
the counterpart’s shortcomings. Advisors should begin by showing they are 
reliable by doing everything they say they will do. Trust develops as the FSF and 
their advisors perform their functions. Examples of actions that assist in growing 
trust are the following. 
(a) Advisors should be where they are supposed to be and on time.
(b) Advisors should start out with confidence-building missions. Early
success builds self-confidence and trust.
(c) Advisors should not promise any support that cannot be delivered.
Since all the components of rapport are reciprocal, advisors have to be willing 
and able to share things about their lives, such as culture, language, and 
experiences. It is important to remember rapport building requires the advisor to 
establish a personal level of understanding with the counterpart to be effective. 
Be a positive example. FSF respect advisors who demonstrate the right way 
to do a task, rather than just talk about how to do a task. The following areas also 
contribute to building rapport. 
(a) Maintaining enthusiasm and a positive attitude.
(b) Developing language skills and the ability to use an interpreter.
(c) Respecting a counterpart’s rank, age, status, and experience.
(d) Developing negotiation skills.
(e) Improving interpersonal skills.
(f)
Being confident, competent, and capable.
(g) Never expecting or demanding counterparts do something the advisor is
unable or unwilling to do.
(h) Demonstrating the task to standard.
(i)
Learning the counterparts’ names and spending time with them on both
their compound, and one’s own, at meals and during holidays.
(j)
Preparing, mentally, to interact with counterparts at all times.
(k) Avoiding the creation of a US enclave; an advisor assignment requires
constant interaction to achieve the desired results.
(l)
Frequently assessing the counterpart’s perceptions.
(m) Avoiding the impression of favoring one group.
(n) Recognizing threats to discipline (e.g., the FSF trying to circumvent their
own leadership by going to an advisor with a complaint or problem).
38 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
(o) Enforcing the unit’s chain of command even if the advisor, discretely,
influences the decision process and outcomes.
Rapport Considerations. 
(a) Language. Advisors should make every effort to learn to communicate
effectively in their FSF counterpart’s language. Generally, advisors that can
converse directly with their counterparts are more effective than those who
cannot. If language proficiency is not an option, advisors should learn to
work with an interpreter. It is essential to learn enough of the language for
basic communications, like greetings. It helps to have enough of an
understanding to catch the basic direction of conversations, even those
between the interpreter and the counterpart. Advisors should attempt to
improve their language proficiency over time because this is usually a well-
received gesture of respect.
(b) Nonverbal Communication. Nonverbal communication comprises 90
percent of communication. Body language, tone of voice, and gestures are
more powerful than verbal language. Tone of voice may send messages that
conflict with the content of the spoken message. Subtle movements of the
body may indicate a person understands the message being conveyed.
Likewise, conflicting messages may be sent by unintentional body language
or gestures.
(c) Local Customs. Respecting local customs goes a long way in building
effective rapport. In every culture, refusing invitations without a reasonable
excuse is seen as a slight. This is extreme in some cultures. The advisor
must be prepared to accept many forms of unfamiliar hospitality. Eating local
food, unless there is a documented health threat, should be encouraged.
Participating in cultural ceremonies also helps build rapport. At some point,
however, there is a level of activity where it is necessary to draw the line.
The advisor must be prepared to be able to deal tactfully with—and report as
necessary—issues that are not aligned under US law (or issues that present
an appearance of a violation of laws), military regulations, policy, and ethics.
Advisors must consult with their chain of command and servicing staff judge
advocate in such situations.
(d) Uniform and Grooming Standards. Advisors should adhere to their
Services’ grooming and uniform standards. At times this may be modified in
accordance with mission requirements and higher headquarters policy. This
establishes a level of expectation with respect to other standards, such as
training and maintenance.
(e) Expertise. Expertise is based on one’s knowledge and experience. The
advisor has to repeatedly demonstrate expertise by making sound
judgments. Bad advice can destroy credibility. If credibility is lost, the advisor
will fail to build rapport.
(f) Going Native. The term going native defines the line where advisors
experience the loss of one’s identity and blur the line between US objectives
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
39 
and PN objectives. Advisors should not cross that line to truly understand the 
PN and its challenges. In the military, it is appropriate to assume enough of 
the customs common to the AO to be effective. Advisors who are close to 
their counterparts can often provide their higher headquarters with valuable 
insights into how things look from a grass-roots level. However, once the 
advisor begins to pursue the agenda of the FSF to the detriment of the US or 
coalition campaign plan, that individual has, effectively, stepped over the 
line. 
(g) Political Discussions. Advisors should avoid initiating lectures about
political philosophy. The FSF should know about the current situation in their
country and may have preconceived notions about the United States. When
the topic of politics does arise, advisors should be ready to discuss US
history, difficulties in establishing peaceful democracies, minority rights, and
positive aspects of the US system. Advisors should reinforce the
counterparts’ national pride and get them talking about their national
traditions and history.
5. Influence
Understanding human behavior and building rapport allow the advisor to 
influence the counterpart. In general, influence can be assessed as one’s ability to 
shape the desired outcome. The following paragraphs discuss the two major 
methods of influencing. See figure 9. 
Compliance-focused influence is based, primarily, on the advisor’s authority. 
Compliance is appropriate for short-term, immediate requirements and for 
situations where little risk can be tolerated. If something needs to be done with 
little time for delay, compliance may be an acceptable approach. On the other 
hand, compliance-focused influence is not particularly effective when the 
advisor’s aim is to create initiative and high esteem within the FSF unit. The 
effects only last as long as the advisor is able to affect the FSF unit’s behavior. 
(a) Incentives and Disincentives. Incentives and disincentives refer to the
advisor’s ability to give things or take things away to change behavior.
Behavior can be modified or changed by changing the consequences of the
current behavior or by introducing new consequences (incentives or
disincentives) a subject receives for engaging in a behavior.
(b) Encouraging a Behavior. Encouraging a behavior involves increasing
positive consequences and decreasing negative consequences. Introducing
or emphasizing desirable or pleasant things in the environment when a
person engages in the desired behavior, or removing unpleasant things when
a person engages in the desired behavior, are ways of encouraging a
behavior.
(c) Discouraging a Behavior. Discouraging a behavior involves devaluing or
reducing the positive consequences and increasing negative consequences a
subject receives. Removing something desirable or pleasant that reinforces a
40 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
behavior, or introducing something unpleasant into the environment are ways 
of discouraging a behavior. 
Figure 9. How Advisors Influence 
Commitment-focused influence changes attitudes, values, and beliefs, and 
produces longer lasting and broader effects. Whereas compliance only changes 
short-term behavior, commitment reaches deeper and, subsequently, generates 
long-term behavioral change. For example, when an advisor builds a sense of 
responsibility among counterparts, the individual will likely demonstrate more 
initiative, personal involvement, and creativity. Commitment grows from an 
individual’s desire to gain a sense of control and develop self-worth by 
contributing to the organization. Depending on the objective of the influence, 
advisors can strengthen commitment by reinforcing their counterpart’s 
identification with the nation (loyalty), the Service (professionalism), the unit or 
organization (selfless service), the leadership in a unit (respect), and to the 
mission (duty). Long-term success hinges on the advisor’s ability to develop 
commitment. 
The art of influencing requires knowing what techniques to use based on the 
situation. No single technique works in every situation. Positive reinforcement in the 
form of incentives (e.g., supplies or time off) and internal rewards (e.g., praise and 
recognition) can produce positive outcomes. Disincentives (e.g., withholding support, 
scorn) can be used when there is an immediate need to discontinue dangerous 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
41 
COAs. Disincentives also can send a clear message to others in the unit about 
expectations and the consequences of violating those expectations. By using these 
techniques, an advisor can shape the social norms of a unit. One caution, however, 
is disincentives should be used sparingly and only in extreme cases because they 
can lead to resentment.  
Doctor Robert Cialdini, author of Influence: the Psychology of Persuasion, 
identified six influencing principles relevant to virtually any culture and group. 
Understanding and applying these basic principles can increase an advisor’s 
effectiveness in persuading a group or individual. 
Principle of Scarcity. People value more what they can have less of. They 
typically associate greater value with things that are rare, dwindling in availability, 
or difficult to acquire. 
Principle of Authority. People are easily persuaded by individuals perceived 
to be legitimate authorities or experts. They defer to experts who provide 
shortcuts to decisions requiring specialized information. 
Principle of Social Proof. People often look to the behavior of those around 
them for direction about what choices to make. This action is heightened when 
those around them are similar in terms of age, education, social standing, and 
experience. 
Principle of Liking. People prefer to say yes to and comply with the requests 
of those they like and who they feel like them. 
Principle of Reciprocity. If someone grants favors, gifts, or concessions, an 
overpowering need to repay the favor immediately blooms within the recipient of 
the favor, gift, or concession. This human trait transcends all cultures and races. 
Principle of Consistency. The desire to be consistent with one’s own 
commitments in the form of prior actions, beliefs, values, and statements has a 
very strong pull and is a central motivator of behavior. The drive to look for and 
be consistent with one’s own commitments is a highly potent weapon of social 
influence. People do not like to be inconsistent and tend to align their actions with 
their prior commitments.  
Advisor Influence Example 
We graduated our first group of new instructors in several months, increasing the 
number of Iraqi instructor pilots in the Fighter Training Wing by 150%. For the 
previous months, Iraqi instructors had only flown (on average) four sorties each 
per month. We needed to get them to increase the workload for two reasons. 
One, our student population was increasing and we had no additional influx of 
US instructors. Two, the focus on transition to Iraqi control and leadership had 
intensified, and we needed to begin positioning the Iraqis to take our place. With 
the graduation of the new instructors, the time was ripe to push towards 
transition. 
We sat down with the Iraqi leadership and spoke with them about allowing the 
Iraqis to take a larger ownership role in the wing by increasing their sortie 
42 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
production rates. Their duty schedule, which was limited by the amount of 
monthly leave each pilot took, seemed to be the critical impediment to their 
ownership of various programs in the wing. We suggested they modify their duty 
schedule to be present three weeks out of the month. The Iraqi wing commander 
explained that he wished he could, but his pilots would feel he was being too 
hard on them, and he needed to get guidance from his commander to that effect. 
That way, his pilots wouldn’t be mad at him, and would realize there was a 
common Iraqi Air Force duty standard. He told me he had even asked his 
commander to issue an order to codify the work schedule. 
What I didn’t realize was he was trying to politely tell me he didn’t support an 
increased work schedule. He had sent no such request to his commander. By 
telling me he couldn’t make the decision—his commander needed to issue an 
order to that effect—he was telling me no. Not realizing that, I pushed ahead with 
the proposal to change the vacation schedule, sending it up through the advisor 
staff, and mentioning it to the Iraqi Air Force commander the next time we sat 
down together to chat. It caused a huge rift. The Iraqi wing commander became 
extremely frustrated and was present even less at work. When he was there, he 
began acting in a very hostile manner towards the advisors, and me in particular. 
It was obvious our efforts—my plans—were not achieving the desired results. 
Instead, they were harming the relationship between the Iraqi leadership and the 
advisor team. 
So we changed our vector. Rather than push for a different work or vacation 
schedule, I stopped asking them about their work schedule or even when they 
would be present for duty. Instead we began to post sortie counts prominently in 
the operations room. It was also about this time our new instructor pilots began 
flying in earnest. Every day, we would post the top fliers for the month, and a bar 
graph of how many sorties were being flown. We showed the sorties for the Iraqi 
and US pilots. Within the Iraqi ranks, the younger pilots quickly jumped ahead in 
the sortie counts. All of a sudden, the senior Iraqi pilots began making 
themselves available to fly. It was a pride issue—the older pilots did not want to 
be out performed by the younger pilots. Sortie rates per pilot more than tripled by 
the end of the month. Every day, the Iraqi pilots would look at the sortie count, 
and then look at the scheduling board to ensure they were up to fly the next day. 
Some pilots began to take considerably less vacation time. 
The key, it turned out, was finding the correct leverage point. The older pilots 
were not interested in true ownership over the processes, and they certainly did 
not want to give up time with their families. So offering them ownership as an 
incentive to spend more time away from their families was not an effective form 
of persuasion. But personal pride—being on top of the sortie count list—now, that 
was important to them. This month, one of the younger pilots has announced he 
will not take vacation the entire month, because he wants to maximize his 
sorties. He wants to build experience so he can be better qualified to teach his 
students. So in the end, we’re achieving success by letting them be motivated by 
the same thing that motivates us as advisors—leadership by example. Only in 
this case, the example is being set by their newest pilots. And that is a great 
success for us.

6. How to Influence/Change Behavior
Figure 10 depicts a cycle of influence.
Step 1: Determine a Goal. Advisors influence others to achieve a purpose. To be 
successful at exerting influence, advisors have an end goal in mind. Sometimes the 
goal is very specific. Many goals are less distinct and measurable, but are still valid 
and meaningful. Goals should be written down and addressed in mission statements 
and internal assessments. 
Figure 10. How to Influence 
Step 2: Determine Who to Influence. The advisor needs to develop a mental list 
of those who need to be influenced. Getting an FSF unit to do what the advisor 
wants may be as simple as influencing the commander, but the advisor may have to 
influence the unit members as well as the leader’s commander. The advisor should 
consider as many variations as practical. Advisors should look for any conditions or 
circumstances in the immediate environment that significantly affect the individual or 
the group’s emotions, beliefs, or behavior. Individual or group characteristics the 
advisor might consider include: 
Gender. 
Religion. 
Age. 
Socioeconomic status. 
44 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
Ethnicity. 
Political affiliation. 
Level of education (very important in determining how to assess and 
persuade people). 
Occupation. 
Recent events. 
Geography (beliefs and values can vary widely from region to region). 
Step 3: Determine Motives. Motives are the reasons behind the decisions people 
make. Motives come from an inner desire to meet a need or want. Advisors use the 
knowledge of what motivates others to influence them. Knowing one’s counterpart, 
and others who may be influenced, gives advisors insight into affecting their 
behavior. The desire to fulfill, alleviate, or eliminate a need or want provides the 
motivation to change behavior. 
Identify Basic Motives. Basic motives involve physiological needs such as 
food, water, and safety (i.e., security and shelter). When people feel hunger, they 
are motivated to eat. When people feel pain, they are motivated to reduce the 
source of the pain. Such basic motives are extremely powerful in driving behavior 
and overwhelm psychological needs and wants. 
Identify Social Motives. Social motives are derived from access to other 
tangibles (e.g., money, goods, education, infrastructure, and health care) or more 
complex psychological motives, such as status. For example, people learn to 
want money because it can be exchanged for food and other desired goods. 
Power and control, achievement, reassurance, escape or avoidance, justice or 
revenge, and acceptance or affiliation are all types of learned social motives. 
Examples include: 
(a) Wanting better educational opportunities for their children.
(b) Wanting better paying jobs.
(c) Wanting their interests represented by the government.
(d) Wanting revenge for perceived wrongs.
(e) Wanting self-rule.
Prioritize Motives as Critical, Short-term, and Long-term. Advisors prioritize
motives by immediacy of the need or want and delay in satisfaction. Critical 
motives are immediate needs. Short-term motives are those currently being 
satisfied or for which active efforts are being made to satisfy them in the near 
future. Long-term motives are those desired, but not immediately important, and 
satisfaction may be delayed until some point in the future. 
Step 4: Determine Individual’s and Group’s Beliefs, Values, and Attitudes. 
45 
Beliefs are information thought to be true. The advisor must ascertain what 
individual beliefs are considered true by the FSF. Religious and cultural beliefs 
can hold deeper meaning and significance than intellectual beliefs.  
Values are a prioritization of what one believes. Values can be ethical and 
moral, doctrinal and ideological, social, aesthetic, or economic. The advisor must 
ascertain what is valued. (What is considered important?) 
Attitudes reflect whether one likes or dislikes something. Likes and dislikes 
can often be traced to a person’s beliefs and values. This includes things loved 
or hated, and those causing frustrations and fears. They provoke an emotional 
response that can be used to increase the effectiveness of an argument or act. 
For example, frustrations occur when a want is not met. By examining what is 
causing frustration, the advisor may find another motive that needs to be 
addressed. The following are questions the advisor may ask to determine what 
causes a particular attitude. 
(a) What is loved?
(b) What is hated?
(c) What causes anger?
(d) What is feared?
(e) What is considered shameful or embarrassing?
(f)
What causes dissatisfaction and what are the group’s or individual’s
complaints?
(g) What are the group’s or individual’s frustrations? (What do they want that
they cannot get?)
Although difficult to derive, beliefs, values, and attitudes can prove to be very 
effective in persuasion. 
Step 5: Compare an Individual’s Beliefs, Values, and Attitudes with the 
Predominant Cultural Beliefs, Values, and Attitudes. The predominant cultural 
beliefs, values, attitudes, traditions, and norms may be very different from the group 
the advisor is trying to influence. This difference in behavior is directly related to the 
host’s predominant culture.  
Step 6: Determine Openness. Openness is the likelihood an individual or group 
will be open to persuasion. Determining openness aids in prioritizing efforts. If 
openness is moderate to high, an advisor may not need to focus as much effort as 
would be necessary if the openness were low. Openness is determined by 
assessing the strength of the underlying motivation source and the FSF perception 
of the desired, corresponding behavior. The strength of the motivation depends on 
the perceived risk and perceived reward, while the perception of the behavior is 
linked directly to how consistent the behavior is with the individual’s or group’s 
values and beliefs. 
Risks and rewards can be social, emotional, financial, and physical. Risks 
may include the threat of physical harm, financial loss, or disapproval of peers. 
15 June 2023

46 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
Rewards may include financial gain, political power, approval of peers, or 
increased self-esteem. Risks and rewards can be immediate or long-term. 
Immediate risks and rewards are stronger than long-term risks and rewards. For 
example, very few people are willing to walk a tightrope (immediate risk), but 
many people smoke (long-term risk). The higher the perceived rewards and the 
lower the perceived risks, the more likely the behavior will occur. 
(a) Perceived Risk. What are the negative consequences expected by the
individual who engages in the desired behavior?
(b) Perceived Reward. What is the positive consequence anticipated by the
individual who engages in the desired behavior?
Advisors should determine how consistent the desired behavior is with the 
values and beliefs of the individual. Generally, behavior is consistent with values 
and norms relative to moral, ethical, religious, political, or cultural beliefs. 
Behavior inconsistent or incongruent with values and beliefs decreases over 
time. Alternately, if behavior continues to be incongruent with values and beliefs, 
individuals are likely to adjust their behavior before modifying their values and 
beliefs. Thus, the likelihood of a desired behavior change is based on the 
connection with an individual’s values and beliefs. 
A lower openness does not mean the person cannot be influenced, but more 
effort and analysis will be required to effectively influence behavior. The lower the 
susceptibility, the higher the effort required to adjust conditions for a behavior 
change to occur. 
Step 7: Determine Methods. Motives, personal characteristics, and environmental 
conditions determine which influence method or combination of methods is 
appropriate. When a situation is urgent and great risk is involved, eliciting 
counterpart compliance may be necessary. Advisors typically pursue a longer-term 
focus and use influence to build strong commitment.  
When influencing their counterparts, advisors should consider the following. 
(a) Objectives for using influence should be in line with the advisor’s values,
ethics, laws, and code of conduct.
(b) Compliance (seeking influence) focuses on meeting and accounting for
specific task demands.
(c) Commitment (encouraging influence) emphasizes empowerment and
long-lasting change.
Advisors can use various methods that focus on compliance or commitment 
(see table 4 for method examples). Advisors will want to employ several methods 
simultaneously to rapidly change behavior while providing knowledge and 
experience to change beliefs, values, and attitudes. 
(a) Professional Relationship. This method begins with the advisor’s
credentials. After the first meeting, the advisor immediately needs to establish
and maintain credibility by providing good advice. If the counterpart is not
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
47 
making a professional or personal connection with the advisor, the advisor 
must depend on the quality of the advice to win over the FSF counterpart. 
With time, a consistent approach can gain commitment effectively from FSF 
counterparts. It works best with a personal friendship, but it also works where 
personal friendships cannot be established.

(b) Personal Friendship. This method is used when the advisor has
established a strong rapport with the counterpart. This works when the foreign
counterpart actually likes the advisor. The advisor has to have a high level of
trust in the counterpart as well. This method allows the advisor to assess the
counterpart’s attitudes and beliefs in a way not possible in any other method.
However, it is not always possible to achieve and has a great risk of the
advisor internalizing and adopting the counterpart’s problems.
(c) Collaboration. This method occurs when the advisor cooperates in
providing assistance or resources to carry out the FSF counterpart’s plan.
This works when counterparts are at a level where they can develop their own
plans or are determined to do things their way. The advisor should become
involved in the counterpart’s process to help shape how the FSF operate. For
example, the advisor could offer to proofread an order before a major
planning effort to ensure the operation has collaboration with joint,
interagency, or multinational agencies.
(d) Participation. This method occurs when the advisor asks the FSF
counterpart to take part in planning. Active participation leads to an increased
48 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
sense of worth and recognition. It provides value to the effort and builds 
commitment. An invitation to get involved in problem solving or objective 
planning is critical when the advisor tries to institutionalize a vision for long-
term change. By involving key FSF leaders at all levels during the planning 
phases, the advisor ensures counterparts share in the vision. Later, these 
FSF leaders will be able to pursue critical intermediate and long-term 
objectives, even after the advisor has moved on. 
(e) Rational Persuasion. This method requires the advisor to provide
evidence, logical arguments, or explanations showing how a request is
relevant to the goal. This is often the first approach to gaining commitment
from counterparts and is likely to be effective if the advisor is recognized as
an expert with an established rapport. Advisors who try to change beliefs and
values often draw upon their own experience to give reasons that work,
based on their expertise.
(f) Inspiration. This method occurs when the advisor arouses strong emotions
to build conviction. The advisor is working to amplify existing beliefs and
values as well as change attitudes. An advisor may stress to the counterpart
that, without help, the safety of the team may be at risk. By appropriately
stressing the results of stronger commitment, an advisor can inspire followers
to surpass minimal standards and reach a higher level of performance.
(g) Authority. This method occurs when advisors refer to sources of authority
(e.g., legal, religious, tradition, or position) to establish the basis for a request.
In the military, certain jobs must be done, regardless of circumstances, when
subordinate leaders receive legitimate orders from higher headquarters. A
reference to one’s position suggests to those who are being influenced there
is the potential for official action if the request is not completed. The following
are types of authority appeals.
Legal. This is an appeal to laws or regulations, or to people in superior
positions in the social hierarchy (e.g., the Uniform Code of Military Justice,
noncommissioned officers [NCOs] and officers, police officers, parents, or
government officials). The group or individual must recognize the authority
for the appeal to work.
Religious. This is an appeal to a belief-teaching institution, a sacred text,
or an individual revered or worshiped (e.g., the Roman Catholic Church,
the Qur’an, the Dalai Lama, or a local Imam).
Tradition. This is an appeal to time-honored customs familiar to the
group or individual or behaviors repeated continually without question
(e.g., people eat turkey on Thanksgiving as a time honored practice).
Position. This is an appeal from someone of authority (e.g., chairman of
the board, leader of a military unit, family patriarch or matriarch, or boss or
foreman). The appeal is useful where the counterpart’s superior has
issued an order who has the power to enforce it. The advisor has to be
fully aware of what direction was given by the counterpart’s superior.
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
49 
(h) Exchange. This is an influence method advisors use when they make an
offer to provide a desired item or action in trade for compliance with a
request. The exchange technique requires the advisor to control certain
resources or rewards valued by those being influenced.
(i) Apprising. This method happens when the advisor explains why a request
benefits a counterpart, such as giving greater work satisfaction or performing
a task a certain way to save time. In contrast to the exchange technique, the
benefits are out of the control of the advisor. An advisor may use the
apprising method to inform a new unit commander of the information gain that
is obtainable by building rapport with the local population.
Influence methods outline the general efforts an advisor can make to change 
behavior. If the advisor has time for long-term change, the focus will be on 
commitment. If the advisor has infrequent interaction with the person, the focus, 
probably, will be on compliance to get the desired behavior. Once a method is 
selected, the advisor needs to assess the counterpart’s motives and personality, 
and the environment to determine the proper influence techniques to persuade 
the counterpart to change behavior. 
Step 8: Determine Techniques. The influence techniques that follow can be 
selected and implemented along with the previously mentioned methods to answer 
basic needs including social, psychological, or growth. They also can be used to 
emphasize fears, likes, or dislikes depending on environmental conditions (e.g., 
traditions or demographics). These techniques can emphasize positives or negatives 
(incentives or disincentives) and can be applied with little or large amounts of 
pressure. 
Inevitability. This technique most often relies on the emotion of fear, 
particularly the fear of death, injury, or some other type of harm. For example, if a 
person does not surrender, he will die; or if a person does not pay his taxes, he 
will go to jail. It also can be an appeal to logic. Both require proof the promised 
outcome will occur. Therefore, it is crucial that credibility is gained and 
maintained. 
In Group-Out Group. This technique seeks to divide a group or separate two 
groups. It creates an enemy of one group, and encourages the other group to 
rebel or discriminate against them. This appeal frequently points out major 
differences between groups or factions within a group. 
Bandwagon. This technique plays upon the group’s need to belong or 
conform to group standards. The two main types of bandwagon appeal are an 
appeal to companionship and an appeal to conformity. Peer pressure is an 
example of a conformity type of bandwagon appeal. 
Nostalgia. This technique refers to how things were done in the past. The 
appeal can be used to encourage or discourage a particular behavior. In a 
positive light, it refers to the “good old days” and encourages the group to behave 
in a manner reminiscent of those times. In the negative, it points out how bad 
things were in the past and why a change in behavior avoids a return to misery. 
50 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
Self-interest. This technique plays directly to the wants and desires of the 
individuals. The appeal can play upon the group’s vulnerability for acquisition, 
success, or status. A self-interest appeal can be presented as a gain or loss. An 
appeal to loss exploits the group not wishing to engage in an advisor-
recommended and desired behavior by highlighting that the current behavior will 
not satisfy the group’s need. An appeal to gain would inform the group that, to 
satisfy a want, the group must engage in a desired behavior. 
Glittering Generalities. This technique uses intense, emotionally appealing 
words to muster strong feelings of the listener. These words are so closely 
associated with highly valued concepts and beliefs, the appeals are convincing 
without being supported by fact or reason. The appeals are directed toward such 
emotions as love of country or home and desire for peace, freedom, glory, or 
honor. 
Transference. This technique projects positive or negative qualities of a 
person, entity, object, or value to another. It is generally used to transfer blame 
from one party in a conflict to another. 
Least of Evils. This technique acknowledges the COA being taken is possibly 
undesirable, but emphasizes any other COA would result in a worse outcome. 
Name-calling. This technique seeks to arouse prejudices in an audience by 
labeling the object of the propaganda as something the group fears, loathes, or 
finds undesirable. 
Plain Folks or Common Man. This technique attempts to convince the group 
the position noted in the argument is actually the same as their own. It is 
designed to win the confidence of the audience by communicating in the usual 
manner and style of the audience. Communicators use ordinary language, 
mannerisms, and clothes (via face-to-face or other audiovisual communications) 
when they attempt to identify their point of view with the average person. 
Testimonials. This technique uses quotations cited to support or reject a 
policy, action, program, or personality. The reputation or role of the individual 
giving the statement is used to foster belief in a statement or plan. There can be 
different types of testimonial authority. Official testimonials use endorsements of 
approved people in authority or well known in a particular field. Personal sources 
of testimonials may include hostile leaders, fellow Service members, opposing 
leaders, famous scholars, writers, popular heroes, and other personalities. 
Insinuation. This technique creates or increases suspicions of ideas, 
groups, or individuals as a means to divide the adversary. One hints, suggests, 
or implies, but lets the group draw its own conclusions. 
Presenting the Other Side. This technique involves some people in a group 
believing neither of the opposing persons is entirely virtuous. To them, messages 
that express concepts solely in terms of right and wrong may not be credible. 
Agreement with minor aspects of the enemy’s point of view may overcome 
cynicism. This also shows that the presenter has researched both sides and has 
determined the better approach.

51 
Simplification. This technique reduces facts to either right, wrong, good, or 
evil. It provides simple solutions for complex problems and offers simplified 
interpretations of events, ideas, concepts, or personalities. 
Compare and Contrast. This technique compares two or more ideas, 
issues, or choices and explains the differences between them. It is effective if the 
group has a conflict that must be resolved. 
Compare for Similarities. This technique compares two or more ideas, 
issues, or objects to try and find a common understanding. It tries to show the 
desired behavior or attitude is similar to one already accepted by the group. 
Illustrations and Narratives. This technique uses an illustration, which 
provides a detailed example of the idea being presented to make abstract or 
general ideas easier to comprehend. When a story is used, it is called a 
narrative. 
Specific Instances. This technique lists examples to help prove a point. 
Statistics. This technique uses statistics that have a certain authority, but 
the statistics must be clear enough to maintain relevance for the group. In most 
cases, it is best to keep the statistical evidence simple and easily absorbable by 
the group. 
Explanations. This technique is used when a term or idea is unfamiliar. 
Gifts. This technique involves giving something tangible before requesting 
compliance. The idea is the target will feel the need to reciprocate later. For 
example, one could say: “Accept this well and cistern as a gift to the people of 
your town from the partner forces… to demonstrate our good will and hope for 
mutual cooperation in the future.” 
Debt. This technique calls in past favors. For example, one could say: 
“Coalition forces have done a lot for your town: the new school, the well in the 
center of town… These insurgents are endangering all we have worked for 
together. We need your help in stopping these groups by reporting any 
information you and your people may discover.” 
Aversive Stimulation. This technique is used when continuous punishment 
and the cessation of punishment is contingent upon compliance.  
Moral Appeal. This technique entails finding moral common ground and 
using the moral commitments of a person to obtain compliance.  
Positive and Negative Self-feeling. This technique entails making a person 
feel either positive or negative about themselves as a method of persuasion.  
Positive and Negative Esteem of Others. This technique entails making a 
person feel emotional about others’ thoughts of them.  
Fear. This technique entails using fear techniques to make the listener 
comply with suggestions.

Step 9: Apply Techniques. During this step, the techniques discussed in Step 8 
are applied. Below are some identified barriers to successfully applying these 
methods. 
While communicating with one’s counterpart, the advisor will possibly 
encounter the two following barriers. 
(a) Indifference.
What value are you to me?
I do not care; what’s in it for me?
(b) Concerns of the advisee or counterpart.
Misunderstanding (believes something that is not factual).
Skepticism (does not believe or trust the advisor).
Drawback (the counterpart’s demand and concern is impossible or
beyond the advisor’s capability to solve).
The following lists the above barriers and immediate actions for overcoming 
them. 
(a) Indifference.
Probe for opportunities and effects.
Create awareness of needs.
Support the needs.
Close.
(b) Misunderstanding.
Acknowledge the concern.
Probe.
Offer relevant proof.
Check for acceptance.
(c) Skepticism.
Acknowledge the concern.
Probe.
Offer relevant proof.
Check for acceptance.
(d) Drawback.
Step back, draw attention to the bigger picture.
Readdress needs.
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
53 
Check for acceptance.
The following is the process used above for gaining understanding and 
obtaining an agreement that overcome barriers.  
(a) Open. Open the discussion to determine if it is indifference or one of the
concerns of the counterpart that is creating the barrier.
(b) Probe. Probe for opportunities and effects. Determine the root cause of
the barrier.
Circumstances. Determine if one time or local circumstances are the root
cause or are the circumstances for substantial.
Needs. Determine the needs of the person causing the barrier.
(c) Support needs. Support the needs of the person or the circumstance that
removes the barriers.
(d) Close. Make an agreement on that talking point or barrier and repeat the
process on the next perceived barrier.
(e) Continue until an agreement is reached, or take immediate action on
indifference or concerns. Repeat as necessary.
Step 10: Check MOEs and Look for Unintended Consequences. The advisor 
should be able to easily assess the effectiveness of actions by assessing the related 
MOEs. However, with every action there may be unintended consequences, or the 
activity may not be preparing the counterparts for more complicated tasks later. 
Using soccer as a team building effort could work well as the sides learn to work with 
each other, unless it causes the unit to split into two ethnic or political factions. 
Note: All the approaches mentioned are designed to help the advisor achieve a goal, 
but just knowing the counterpart wants something is not enough. The advisor will have a 
limited supply of resources available to commit for changes or behavior modification. 
Since advisors can only bend so much on rules and regulations; eventually, they must 
resort to negotiations. 
7. Negotiation
Overview. Negotiation can be a challenging and complex process; yet, people 
negotiate on many levels every day. Negotiation is not always about the FSF 
counterpart or people encountered while deployed. In fact, most people apply 
negotiation skills to interactions within their own organizations and personal lives.  
Negotiation contexts are always changing depending on the AO, social 
situation, and environment. It is important to keep an open mind in approaching 
any engagement, meeting, or negotiation. Remember, both parties are at the 
table because they both want something.  
This section on negotiations is presented from a Western perspective. Many 
of these techniques are useful universally. Advisors should refer to the section on 
culture (Chapter IV, Section 1) to see what adaptations need to be considered 
before using them. Modern negotiation techniques emphasize the integrative 
54 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
approach (win/win), and discount the distributive (win or lose) and other 
approaches. Each major approach to negotiating (integrative or distributive) has 
advantages and disadvantages. In planning for each negotiation, advisors should 
consider the desired outcome (both sides), the situation, and the cultures. This 
helps determine the initial negotiating approach. Although all situations are 
different, learning, practicing, and improving the skills outlined in this section 
assist the Service member in accomplishing key tasks in today’s OE. Advisors 
should adjust or change the approach based on changing circumstances and 
new information. 
In planning for any meeting or negotiation, advisors must understand what is 
needed and wanted, the ROE, and the commander’s guidance. US goals and 
objectives drive an advisor’s negotiations. The “how” should be negotiated to 
achieve those goals and objectives, not what goals and objectives to achieve.  
Advisors should understand that although some of their attempts to influence 
counterparts will be unsuccessful, the goal of negotiation is compromise.  
Factors Impacting Negotiations. The following paragraphs discuss the four 
factors impacting negotiations. 
Time. Some cultures and individuals see time in a micro-view. It is all about 
here and now. Other cultures and individuals see time in a macro-view. 
Individuals see themselves on the entire timeline of their lives, making temporary 
circumstances seem less substantial, and the present moment is a point bridging 
the past with the future. For example, a deadline-driven person may strive for a 
decision in minutes or hours, whereas an FSF member may think in terms of 
months or years to reach a decision. 
Environment. Some cultures believe the impact on the environment is directly 
attributable to a person, and every accident is preventable. Other cultures believe 
the environment impacts the person. Accidents just happen, and no one can do 
anything about it. One side may be quite ready to commit to something in the 
future “knowing” nothing stands in the way, while the other side may be reluctant 
to talk in certainties of the future “knowing” factors beyond their control may 
prevent them from fulfilling their commitments. 
Self. In some cultures, when a person makes a mistake, blame can be 
isolated to that person. In other cultures, the individual is seen as an element of 
the group, so a mistake is made not by the individual, but rather the whole group. 
Thus, in negotiations, one might accept a personal slight to accomplish a goal; 
but the counterpart, representing the group, cannot allow shame to fall on the 
group. 
Nonverbal Communication. Since advisors often have to work through 
interpreters, nonverbal communication is very important. Some cultures respect 
people who mean what they say and maintain their composure. Other cultures 
respect the eloquence in which something is said or the emotion used to convey 
it. Where words may be translated improperly, the advisor or the counterpart can 
hear tone and sense emotion.

55 
Negotiation Roles. When entering a negotiation, it is important to know the 
advisor’s role. The following paragraphs discuss the three major roles associated 
with negotiation. Each role has its own techniques and functions. 
Negotiator. The negotiator is the most common advisor role. A negotiation is 
the process by which parties exchange commitments or promises to resolve 
disagreements and reach settlements. The advisor needs to prepare for each 
negotiation or will be at a significant disadvantage during the negotiation session. 
To prepare for a negotiation session, the advisor should consider the following. 
(a) Examine the options.
What is the advisor trying to accomplish?
How important is it to the advisor?
How important is it to the counterpart?
How much leverage does the advisor have?
Who is in the position of power?
What if the advisor and counterpart cannot agree?
(b) Discover the counterparts’ motivations. What are their underlying needs?
(c) List all the scenarios that could satisfy mutual needs. Features should be
added to these scenarios that increase the opportunity for all parties to be
satisfied. Advisors should list and prioritize the interests that support one’s
own positions. This helps determine the “why” influencing the “what” (position,
solution, and demand). Also, advisors should list the other party’s interests
that influence their potential positions. At the negotiation, the information
sharing process (discussing each other’s interests) is the basis for the follow-
on brainstorming session to develop potential solutions that could be
developed separately because neither party has complete information before
the meeting.
(d) Use the integrative process, which seeks to generate a solution better
than any single party could generate, as the primary option. It is a process
that supports a long-term relationship and can build trust between partners
who have successfully solved a problem while making mutual concessions. At
times, simple compromises can facilitate the negotiation and help create a
“win/win” outcome. Achieving consensus, not total agreement or satisfaction,
is key. A consensus means all parties are at least minimally satisfied.
Negotiators should strive to maximize the benefits (positive) to each party
while minimizing the cost (negatives). This is the hallmark of a skilled
negotiator as it creates an agreement with an increased chance of being
effectively executed while, simultaneously, preserving the relationship.
(e) The negotiator represents one side and has a vested interest in the
outcome of the negotiation.

If the FSF ask the advisor to negotiate for them, they expect the advisor
to have their best interests in mind. The coalition may try to use the
advisor to push their agenda and influence, rather than negotiate.
It is best to avoid conflict of interest situations. The advisor could lose
the trust of the counterpart by blindly pushing the coalition’s agenda.
If the FSF counterpart desires to take action that is not legally
acceptable, the advisor probably will not be able to use the commitment
techniques discussed earlier in Chapter 6. The advisor probably needs to
use some form of compliant technique.
If the FSF counterpart is not violating any laws, the advisor should focus
on commitment techniques. Success will not be achieved quickly. Table 5
is an example of an interest-based negotiation worksheet.

Mediator. An advisor may fill the position of mediator. In Western culture, a 
mediator is defined as one who is not known to either party, has an impartial 
stance in any outcome of the mediation, and has no decision-making authority. In 
many other cultures, a mediator is a known and respected person who 
sometimes has a stake in the outcome and, at times, has decision-making 
authority. Before embarking on the role of mediator, advisors need to understand 
the cultural expectations and adjust as needed. As a minimum, the advisor must 
be seen as an honest broker, able to understand all aspects of the argument, 
and guide the disputing parties to their own solution with a minimum of direction. 
Table 6 outlines some potential mediator roles.

Share only information with one party that is permitted to be shared by
the other party.
Arrange for interaction.
Clarify the situation.
Supply missing information.
Transmit messages between parties.
Ensure all interests are discussed.
(b) Formulator Tactics. The formulator should:
Be available to meet with both parties as they desire or as needed.
Share only information with one party that is permitted to be shared by
the other party.
Control the pace, formality, and physical environment of the meetings.
Highlight common interests.
Help parties save face.
Keep the process focused on the issues.
Make substitutive proposals.
Suggest concessions the parties could make.
Arbitrator. The FSF may try to put the advisor in the position of arbitrator. 
Arbitration is the process by which disputing parties submit their differences to be 
judged by an impartial source selected by mutual consent or statutory provision. 
The advisor is in trouble when FSF want the advisor to make a decision between 
two FSF positions. If a positive solution for both parties can be found, the advisor 
improves rapport with both parties, but when a solution is not positive for both 
parties, the advisor may alienate one or both parties. If the FSF constantly seek 
60 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
decisions from the advisor, the advisor should reassess the level of involvement 
to avoid the arbitrator role. 
Distributive and Integrative Negotiating. US culture leads the advisor to 
believe every situation has a win/win solution, and the counterpart also wants to 
achieve a win/win outcome. Some cultures do not believe win/win is optimal and 
prefer a win/lose philosophy. Distributive and integrative negotiating are discussed 
as follows. 
Distributive. The distributive process uses negotiation meetings to present a 
position, protect information from disclosure, or discredit another party. The 
objective is victory for one’s own position and defeat for the other party’s inputs.  
(a) It is known as “win/lose” or “fixed-pie approach.” There are usually a fixed
number of available resources. One party usually feels it won; the other feels
it lost.
(b) Conflict is viewed as inevitable; negotiation is guided by competition
rather than collaboration.
(c) Deception and distrust may be perceived with this approach. Information
is seen as powerful.
(d) The dominant concern, usually, is maximizing one’s own interests.
Integrative. The integrative process uses negotiating meetings to share
ideas, interests, and information, but not preconceived positions. The discovery 
process then fosters the development of potential solutions none of the parties 
could have likely developed on their own due to incomplete information. From the 
potential solutions, parties agree on selection criteria to determine which option 
provides an agreeable solution. The objective is consensus and satisfaction, not 
victory. The following are insights about integrative negotiation. 
(a) It is known as the “win/win” or “expanding-the-pie” approach. Both parties
feel they have gained something. Interest-based negotiation is an example of
integrative negotiation covered later in this chapter.
(b) Conflict is not viewed as inevitable; mutual gains exist. Trust-building is
initiated to develop a cooperative environment.
(c) An understanding of needs allows resources to be divided and both sides
can win.
(d) Through collaboration, valued resources become known to both parties,
and interests from both sides are satisfied.
(e) Negotiations focus on the interests or the “why.” For example, one may
say, “We need better security.” The personal relationship is crucial; mutual
long-term gain is often the goal.
Distributive and integrative negotiating strategies are different in their 
approaches and desired outcomes. However, after selecting the initial strategy, 
the advisor should consider what triggers might occur that would motivate the 
advisor to switch approaches to reach a desired outcome. When considering a 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
61 
change in approach, advisors should think about the new set of pros and cons. 
Successful negotiations can involve a mix of both strategies. 
Interest-based Negotiation. 
Interest-based negotiation is an integrative approach focusing on 
relationships. Because long-term relationships are increasingly important, 
especially in SC with FSF, achieving US and PN objectives, the following 
paragraphs delve into interest-based negotiations closely and include a 
negotiation planning sheet (see table 7). Essential components of interest-based 
negotiation are the following. 
(a) Separate the people from the problem; focus on issues not personalities.
(b) Focus on the interests not the position.
(c) Discover the reasons or “whys” behind stated positions.
(d) Brainstorm for mutual gains.
(e) Discover all the ways parties can work together to reach an agreement.
(f) Use objective criteria to measure fairness or reasonableness of the
agreement.
During talks, there may be a tendency for advisors to forget they are dealing 
with other human beings. The emotional aspect can range from helpful to 
disastrous. If there is a working relationship built on trust, advising is a little 
easier. If there is a tenuous or nonexistent relationship, it can be more difficult to 
separate the people from the problem. Consider the following. 
(a) Perceptions. Advisors should place themselves in the counterparts’ shoes
(gain empathy). Also, be mindful of one’s own and each other’s fears.
(b) Emotions.
Acknowledge one’s own emotions and, if appropriate, validate the other
party’s emotions.
Allow time to process, discuss, and vent.
REMEMBER, it is not about the advisor; it is about the situation.
Emotions are expressed differently across cultures.
(c) Communication:
Practice active listening skills.
Try not to interrupt.
Be aware of the counterpart’s body language.
Use two important tools: observing and asking questions.
(d) If advisors have difficulty separating emotions from the issue, they should
breathe (when in doubt, breathe and count to ten). The advisor should
consider silence or request a break.

15 June 2023 
Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. The advisor should explore 
ways to improve the best alternative to a negotiated agreement. The following 
describe the best alternative to a negotiated agreement. 
(a) It is determined before the implementation or meeting phase.
(b) It is what options are or will be available if no agreement is reached or the
meeting does not occur.
(c) It is critical to have a thorough understanding of potential second- and
third-order effects for any alternative. What are the consequences? What is
the impact on current and future relationships?
Zone of Possible Agreement. The zone of possible agreement is the range 
between the reservation point (referred to as bottom line—the least the advisor 
will accept) and the aspiration point (the ideal outcome), and often is used to 
gauge fairness. Limiting offers to those within this range can hinder the 
negotiating parties in realizing the possibilities for mutual gains. 
Negotiation Styles. Negotiation styles are critical components of negotiation and 
conflict resolution. Five styles are discussed below. Advisors should consider the 
key uses and consequences of over- and underuse of each style with regard to the 
needs of the situation. Although advisors may choose a style at a particular moment, 
they are not locked into it. As situations shift, so must the advisors’ approaches. A 
single negotiation may cover multiple topics that require the employment of different 
negotiation styles, depending on the topic and situational atmospherics. This is 
especially important in the military context where, potentially, dangerous situations 
may arise that require the use of a competitive style. These styles are neither correct 
nor incorrect, but rather a series of tools to help achieve the military objectives. 
Competing or Insisting. This is a power-oriented mode that pushes the 
advisor’s position and wins. 
(a) Key Uses. Executing quick action, making unpopular decisions, and using
in emergency situations.
(b) Consequences of Overuse. Lack of feedback, reduced learning, and low
empowerment.
(c) Consequences of Underuse. Lowered level of influence, indecisiveness,
slow action, and withheld contributions.
Collaborating or Cooperating. This is a relationship-oriented mode that seeks 
“win/win” solutions. 
(a) Key Uses. Integrating solutions, learning, merging perspectives, gaining
commitment, building trust, and improving relationships.
(b) Consequences of Overuse. Diffusion of responsibility, others may take
advantage, work overload, and it is time intensive.
(c) Consequences of Underuse. Quick-fix solutions, lack of commitment by
other team members, and loss of innovation.
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
63 
Compromising or Settling. This is a relationship-oriented mode that loses 
some to win others. 
(a) Key Uses. Equally powerful parties and commitment to opposing views;
issues of moderate importance.
(b) Consequences of Overuse. Loss of long-term goals and lack of trust
create a cynical environment; lacking strength of character or ineffective.
(c) Consequences of Underuse. Difficulty making concessions, difficulty
getting out of destructive arguments, or failure to get the fair share.
Avoiding or Evading. This is a delay-oriented mode that does not pursue 
either parties’ issues. 
(a) Key Uses. Issues of low importance reduce tensions and strengthen the
best alternative to a negotiated agreement; success is redefined by creating
more options.
(b) Consequences of Overuse. Low level of input; decision-making by default
allows issues to fester.
(c) Consequences of Underuse. Possible increased level of hostility and hurt
feelings.
Accommodating or Complying. This is a goodwill-oriented mode that gives in 
to foster goodwill. 
(a) Key Uses. Issues of low importance create goodwill by showing the
advisor is reasonable; performance development and peacekeeping.
(b) Consequences of Overuse. Ideas get little attention, influence is
restricted, contributions are lost, and great challenges emerge.
(c) Consequences of Underuse. Lack of rapport, low morale, and inability to
yield.
Confrontation Preference and Expected Outcomes. Negotiators have one of 
three preferences for confrontation: avoidance, collaboration, or competition. Those 
who prefer avoidance consider accommodation as a viable means to resolve an 
issue. A negotiator who prefers collaboration considers compromise as the preferred 
outcome. A competitive negotiator wants to win. Intentionally losing in a negotiation 
to avoid confrontation seems counterintuitive; however, it tends to protect the current 
relationship. Collaboration requires a mutual respect of the existing relationship, 
while competition is, generally, indifferent. For example, consider the situation where 
Friend A wants to go fishing, and Friend B wants to go to a baseball game. If 
inclined toward avoidance, Friend A would value the friendship, give in, and go to 
the game. However, if inclined toward collaboration, Friend A might suggest taking a 
radio on the fishing trip to listen to the game. If inclined toward competition, Friend A 
would go fishing with or without Friend B. It would be fairly easy to take advantage of 
a negotiator who prefers to avoid confrontation. At the same time, expecting to be 
able to compromise with a highly competitive negotiator may become a point of 
frustration. For the competitor, winning may be more important than the deal itself.

Negotiation Focus. Determining whether the negotiation is a “win/win” situation 
is not as simple as which side gained the most tangible material from the 
negotiation. Every negotiation will vary on which factor is most important. Just as a 
car dealer may accept less profit on individual services, the dealer gains overall if 
the customer returns because the customer trusts the dealer. 
Negotiation Team Organization. Typically, formal negotiations are conducted by 
three to five member teams with each team member fulfilling a specific function for 
the process. The actual size and make-up of the team will be determined through 
mission analysis. Table 8 provides an explanation of the various roles and examples 
of the duties and responsibilities of each.

Coordinated Advising Efforts. In many instances, an advisor team will manage 
multiple negotiation teams that are employed simultaneously. The advisor team 
leader should develop a team engagement strategy that will guide the inputs and be 
affected by the outcomes of individual team negotiations. Each negotiation team 
should develop an engagement strategy as a guide to influence desired outcomes 
from an individual meeting or negotiation that are nested within the team 
engagement strategy. It is important that the inputs and outcomes of individual 
negotiation teams are captured and managed at the advisor-team level to manage 
the larger team engagement strategy. There is an art to controlling, influencing, and 
managing multiple negotiation teams to reach a single desired end state. It requires 
persistent information sharing and management, constant wargaming of injects and 
consequences of projected outcomes, and flexibility.  
8. Advising Role
General. Every advisor is required to be proficient in the developing skills: 
teaching, coaching, and advising. The advisor will make an initial assessment of the 
FSF unit’s proficiency to determine the appropriate developing skill to use. Figure 11 
68 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76
15 June 2023 
illustrates the appropriate level of advice that corresponds to the FSF unit’s 
capabilities. 
Figure 11. Appropriate Advising Skill 
Teach, Coach, or Advise. Advisor teams have limited positional power and 
depend upon personal influence to affect positive FSF efforts via teaching, coaching, 
or advising. Advisor team members often work with people of higher rank or grade 
than themselves. Advisors should remain cognizant of the FSF unit’s experience and 
capabilities to carefully choose opportunities for injecting knowledge. FSF units are, 
normally, agreeable to advisor teams who teach unobtrusively. Advisors who are 
subtle in their approach to teaching, coaching, and advising are highly valued by 
FSF units. Advisors who make FSF personnel feel they are teaching themselves are 
often the most effective. 
Teaching. Teaching includes training and education. Methods of teaching 
can include classroom lectures, seminars, exercises, or simulations. 
Coaching. Coaching refers to guiding people through a set of tasks to 
enhance capabilities already present. Those being coached may not realize their 
potential. The coach helps them understand their current level of performance 
and instructs them on how to reach the next level of knowledge and skill. 
Coaching requires identifying short- and long-term goals and devising plans to 
achieve them. The coach discusses strengths and weaknesses with the leader 
being coached to sustain improvement. Coaches: 
(a) Focus goals.
(b) Clarify the leader’s self-awareness.
(c) Uncover potential.
(d) Eliminate developmental barriers.

69 
(e) Develop action plans and commitment.
(f) Follow up.
Advising. Advisors have experience in their advising areas but are not
required to have similar backgrounds. 
(a) Advisors provide expert opinion, advice, and counsel by focusing on
personal (i.e., interpersonal and communication skills) and professional
development (i.e., technical and tactical knowledge) to develop mutual trust
and respect.
(b) Advisor relationships are not based on superior to subordinate
relationships.
(c) Figure 12 shows how teaching, coaching, and advising align with
corresponding FSF tasks of learning, practicing, and executing. As the FSF
master one skill, the advisor can move on to other skills and initiate the
process again for new skills. If they require additional teaching or coaching,
the advisor can focus them on one part of the cycle. Eventually, the teaching
and coaching should decrease and the majority of the advisor’s time will be
spent as an advisor providing an expert second opinion.

(d) Every advisor has to be a trainer, but not all trainers can perform the
more demanding task of advising. Training occurs in a controlled environment
with the trainer frequently following a fixed program of instruction to improve
unit skills, whereas advising often requires the advisor to develop a training
program and then coach or advise the unit under actual circumstances where
the outcomes are real. The advisor works to improve the performance of the
unit in real time. To be effective, personnel selected as advisors need to have
the requisite experience to be considered an SME and the interpersonal skills
required to influence effectively.
9. Collective Advisor Skills
Collective Skills. Once the advisor team is formed, team members must practice 
their unit combat and survival skills tasks and organize to cover normal functions 
associated with any team, including member duties and responsibilities. As with 
individual advisor skills, some collective skills are refined prior to deployment, and 
others are learned in country. See figure 13 for collective advisor skills and tasks. 
Figure 13. Collective Advisor Skills and Tasks 
Training FSF. 
Training Concept. Training varies according to the FSF requirements, force 
composition, and US and foreign agreements. Advisor teams may need to use a 
“train the trainer” concept to prepare the FSF to be self-sufficient and capable of 
sustaining skills. Initially, US personnel may find themselves conducting all 
instruction through interpreters.  
(a) Advisors must prepare to be the primary instructors.
(b) Advisors should use the building block or crawl, walk, run approaches for
developing FSF capabilities. However, the level (e.g., walk) of the building
block is determined after assessing the FSF. The key is to develop effective
procedures FSF leaders accept and maintain.

ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
71 
(c) Advisors should encourage FSF to develop standards that can be
measured individually and collectively. This will require negotiation and, in
some cases, approval from higher echelons of FSF command structures.
(d) Advisors should quickly establish capable FSF personnel as primary
instructors. This builds rapport, credibility, and friendship.
(e) Advisors use training to build FSF leader credibility. Advisors train the
leaders and let them lead. They coach and assist the leaders in training their
personnel.
Methods of Instruction. Advisors preplan quality, thoughtful training with 
notes that guide discussions and ensure that the FSF meets all learning 
objectives. However, advisors should be rehearsed and know their material so 
that they do not depend on their notes. 
(a) Advisors should use hands-on training. It is the best method of
instruction. FSF officers should be involved in all training events where their
troops participate. Hands-on training involves:
Demonstration.
Step-by-step walkthroughs.
Practice.
Tests.
(b) Advisors should not rely on lecture as a method of training. Since some
FSF may be illiterate, advisors cannot rely solely on using written media.
(c) Advisors should reinforce bottom-up planning and top-down guidance.
This takes time, but the FSF will be receptive to this methodology once they
see it can contribute to successful missions. Advisors should encourage
problem solving at the lowest level.
(d) Advisors should take advantage of technology-independent, low-cost
solutions, such as sand tables or table-top exercises. They should consider
sustainable solutions using material and resources readily available to the
FSF.
(e) If available, advisors can use simulation, but exercise caution when
designing programs around expensive simulation systems.
(f) Advisors reinforce the FSF chain of command. Advisors help them solve
their problems; they do not solve their problems for them.
Common Pitfalls. 
(a) Some members of the FSF may try to use the advisor as a scapegoat
when tough or unpopular decisions have to be made.
(b) The FSF take on some of the personality of their advisors. If the advisors
are overly aggressive, overly confident, or falsely motivated, the FSF may be
the same.
72 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
(c) If members of the FSF try to influence their advisors with excuses or even
threats to get leave and passes, advisors should refer these incidents to the
FSF leadership. Advisors should encourage, if necessary, the FSF leaders to
establish an equitable pass and leave policy that supports both readiness and
wellness.
(d) In many parts of the world, directly confronting someone is considered
improper and results in FSF leaders being unwilling to confront individuals
about performance. Advisors need to be aware of how the FSF provides
feedback and encourage FSF leaders to adopt a command climate that
permits open dialogue, appropriate with cultural considerations, that leads to
improved FSF effectiveness.
(e) The FSF leadership may attempt to get advisors involved in simple
organizational problems they should handle. Advisors need to be careful to
avoid being seen as decision makers because it undermines a unit’s morale
and cohesiveness.
(f) Tribal, ethnic, economic, caste, racial, or religious discrimination may be
common within the AO. The advisor should, carefully, consider mixing diverse
groups in an attempt to get them to work together. One method to overcome
ethnic bias, for example, is by promoting teamwork and basing rewards on
merit. Advisors should encourage friendly competition between units to build
cohesiveness and teamwork. Tribes may have deep-seated animosity that
goes back generations and cannot be overcome by friendly competition and
familiarity. Apply these techniques with humility, not hubris.
(g) The advisors’ perception of corruption or nepotism may be quite different
from the local society’s perception. Family, friends, and affiliated tribe
members may receive favored status for appointments, jobs, and other
rewards. Advisors must learn the locally-acceptable practices and work to
change those that inhibit developing professional, cohesive units. Strong
leadership, training, and performance-based awards are factors that
contribute to managing these problems.
(h) Some leaders will be reluctant to delegate authority. They may feel
threatened by anyone around them who is competent or possesses
leadership abilities. They may view such people as threats to their position
and attempt to get rid of their perceived competitors. Advisors need to show,
through example, how powerful leaders can maximize the abilities of their
subordinates.
10. Chapter Conclusion
This chapter covered the skill sets that advisors at all levels must present to meet with 
success. These skill sets included advising principles, self-awareness, influence 
techniques and procedures, negotiation techniques, and a deeper look at the roles that 
advisors play. These skill sets should be kept in mind through the next chapter, as 
advisors will employ them in varied cultures.

Chapter IV 
CULTURE AND THE ADVISOR 
1. Culture
Culture is the way a society sees and thinks about the world. It includes the 
traditions, ideals, and customs of a nation, tribe, region, state, or other group of 
people. 
Culture is: 
A system of shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts 
members of a society use to cope with the world and one another. 
Learned through a process called enculturation and deeply embedded and 
regarded as normal or natural. 
Patterned, meaning people in a society live and think in ways forming 
definite, repeating patterns. 
Adaptive and responsive to environmental changes; changeable through 
social interactions between people and groups. 
Subjective, meaning advisors should have no presumptions regarding what 
an external society considers right and wrong or good and bad. 
Internalized, in the sense that it is habitual, taken for granted, and perceived 
as natural by people within the society. 
The unpredictable nature and location of military operations require a set of 
universal and transferrable culture concepts and skills that personnel can employ 
wherever they go. There is a need for advisors to learn “how to learn” about culture, 
to observe cultural differences, and how to interact appropriately and effectively no 
matter where they find themselves in the world. As such, cross-cultural competence 
emerged as a key outcome of culture training and education. A commonly used 
working definition of cross-cultural competence is the ability to quickly and 
accurately comprehend, and then act effectively and appropriately in, a culturally 
complex environment to create the desired outcome—without necessarily having 
exposure to a particular group, region, or language. 
The advisor must be aware of the cultural and historical aspects which influence 
behavior. Advisor team members must understand the motivations underlying 
personal interaction and practice patience when dealing with their counterparts. 
Instead of asserting their separateness and privacy as independent individuals, 
other cultures tend to interact as members of a group (i.e., family, clan, village, 
neighborhood, and tribe). Group norms guide individual behavior, and some cultures 
display a high need for social approval. 
Cultural understanding is not derived from demographic information provided to 
the military through country briefs prior to deployment. It is gained from studying and 
understanding people’s religion, history, customs, and social and political structures. 
74 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
To be fully versed, it is necessary to live among the people to understand the 
subtleties of their culture. 
2. Awareness
Cultural awareness reduces friction and allows high-quality communications 
based in a relationship capable of negotiating substantive issues. 
Cultural awareness allows better prediction and tracking of second- and third-
order effects, helping to avoid unforeseen or unintended consequences. 
Acquiring a basic understanding of local history and culture allows advisors to 
recognize and effectively counter an adversary’s propaganda based upon a 
misrepresentation of history. 
Cultural understanding improves negotiations, operational planning, and 
decision-making. 
3. Understanding Another Culture
Effective advising depends on an understanding of a foreign culture. Understanding 
another culture improves the ability to convey ideas, concepts, and purposes without 
causing counterproductive consequences. Judging the norms and traditions of another 
culture solely through the lens of one’s own culture and experience can impede the 
ability to understand why others think and act as they do, and could jeopardize the 
mission.  
Note: Advisors must avoid a rigid view that their culture is right and others are wrong. 
4. Cultural Dimensions of the Operational Environment
Values, beliefs, behaviors, and norms are parts of a culture. They include a 
people’s history and religion, their use of body language and personal space, power 
distance between superiors and subordinates, time orientation, individualism, 
formality, perceptions, use of reason, and belief in cause and effect versus fate. 
Values, beliefs, behaviors, and norms provide the framework for people to deal 
with others within their own society as well as societies around the world. Without 
this framework, every day would be a new challenge, forcing people to relearn the 
rules for interacting with others. A common set of rules (formal and informal) 
provides expectations for a given situation. Observing others, objectively and 
thoroughly, helps create strategies for dealing with them and enables better 
interaction. 
Advisors should try to understand the local differences in values and beliefs 
within the context in which they are observed. They should look for patterns and 
behaviors that do not fit the “normal” activities in an AO. The following paragraphs 
give examples of how the US Army and US Marine Corps categorize the elements 
that shape values, beliefs, behaviors, and norms. 
While not doctrinal, the Army uses society, environment, authority, religion and 
beliefs, communication, and history (SEARCH) to provide a framework that 
organizes the basic dimensions of culture into a map that can be as simple or as 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
75 
complex as needed. Advisors should use SEARCH as a memory aid to examine any 
culture. Each element of SEARCH is addressed in the following paragraphs. 
Society. Family and kinship, tribal/lineage/clan ties, sex and gender roles, 
health, learning, aesthetics, and recreation. 
Environment. Weather, geography, natural resources, production, 
distribution, consumption, and technology. 
Authority. Politics, patron-client relationships, religion, corruption, and military 
aspects. 
Religion and Beliefs. Ideology, codes of conduct, sacred books and stories, 
cultural assumptions, time, and space perceptions. 
Communication. Language, media, body language, and gestures. 
History. Knowledge, previous events, myth, and folk tales. 
The Marine Corps uses several frameworks to organize culture. One framework 
is the five dimensions of operational culture. Similar to SEARCH, these dimensions 
are physical environment, economic, social structure, political structure, and beliefs 
and symbols. Table 9 explains the five dimensions of operational culture. 
The Five Dimensions of Operational Culture 
Ecological 
Model 
Dimension 1: Physical Environment 
The way the cultural group determines the use of the physical environment. 
Who has access to important physical resources (e.g., water, land, food, etc.) 
and how do they view these resources (e.g., land is owned or free to 
everyone)? 
Dimension 2: Economic 
The way the people in a culture obtain, produce, and distribute physical and 
symbolic goods (e.g., food, clothing, cars). 
Social 
Structure 
Model 
Dimension 3: Social Structure 
How people organize their political, economic, and social relationships, and 
the way this organization influences the distribution of positions, roles, status, 
and power within cultural groups. 
Dimension 4: Political Structure 
The political structures of a cultural group and the unique forms of leadership 
within such structures (e.g., bands, councils, hereditary chiefdoms, tribal 
structures, and electoral political systems). The distinction between formal, 
ideal political structures versus actual power structures. 
Symbolic 
Model 
Dimension 5: Beliefs and Symbols 
The cultural beliefs that influence a person’s world view, and the rituals, 
symbols and practices associated with a particular belief system. These also 
include the role of local belief systems and religions controlling and affecting 
behavior.

5. United States and Military Culture
It is important to understand US and military culture to achieve a realistic 
awareness of how foreigners view US citizens and how actions influence others. 
Advisors must learn to adjust their behavior with respect to foreign traditions. US 
culture may be unusual to people who are unfamiliar with it. Understanding a foreign 
culture allows for better anticipation of foreign perceptions and associated reactions, 
allowing for modification of behavior to create desired results. 
Other societies may view US traditions differently. US citizens, generally, value 
open and direct communication, while other cultures, particularly those in the Middle 
East, view these traits as abrupt and rude behavior. US culture tends towards 
individualism and encourages competition, innovation, and materialism. Collective 
societies may view these features as selfish preoccupations and aggressiveness. 
Common attributes of US society include the following: 
The “American dream” (i.e., anyone can achieve anything by working hard 
enough). 
The conglomerate of US culture is a unique mixture of many cultures. 
The US concept of exceptionalism (i.e., our Nation is the best in the world). 
Egalitarianism (i.e., everyone is created equal and special favors are looked 
down on). 
Get back up on the horse; failure is an opportunity to improve. 
Low context culture (i.e., truth is fact-based and explicit [“yes means yes”]). 
Monochromic society (i.e., time is linear and punctuality is valued). 
Capitalism rules (i.e., competition is expected and condoned; strive to win). 
6. Principles of Culture
Several important principles from the concept of culture follow. 
Culture is learned. People are not born with a particular culture. It is learned 
first in the family and then by other experiences over the life of the individual. 
Culture is adaptive. The customs a group develops are based largely on a 
particular environment as opposed to attitudes which may change quickly. 
Values, however, are the slowest to change because they are directly related to 
beliefs. 
Culture is in a constant state of change. Most cultural change occurs quite 
slowly over a period of years, in a series of small accommodations to new 
circumstances. Globalization, in particular the use of social media, has allowed 
for rapid and varied cultural changes. Rapid cultural change often creates tension 
(or even violence) as people attempt to reconcile their beliefs and values with the 
new conditions. 
As a body of learned behaviors common to a given society, culture acts like a 
template, shaping behavior and consciousness within a society from one generation 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
77 
to the next. Most of what we observe as the explicit forms of culture including 
clothing, gestures, and food, are only the surface-level manifestations. In other 
words, these are the most visible, but the least important elements of culture. 
When comparing cultures, there is a tendency to focus on how cultures are 
different from each other. However, cultures are also similar because they are 
designed to resolve common human problems. Advisors must be familiar with their 
own culture to find common experiences they can use to convey their message. 
While focusing on differences will help an advisor avoid areas where common bonds 
are difficult, the similarities will help an advisor find and use those points of similar 
understanding. In Western culture, pride is often based on individual achievement. In 
other cultures, pride is more based on group harmony. In group-level pride 
situations, the advisor should emphasize how FSF actions would bring credit and 
harmony to the group. 
7. Cultural Training
Training cultural awareness is difficult, but necessary because it asks advisors to 
understand another culture from the viewpoint of a person belonging to that culture. 
The functional components of cultural training include: 
Language. 
Religion. 
Traditions. 
Food. 
Ethnicity and social distinction. 
Social organizations. 
Human behavior. 
Values, beliefs, and norms. 
Gender-specific considerations. 
The general methodology for culture training should be to introduce culture as a 
concept and then apply it to understand one’s own culture, learn ways to 
communicate cross-culturally, and to develop a basic understanding of the specific 
FSF culture. This includes a knowledge of those items which may appear unusual to 
the advisor. See table 10 for a list of training recommendations.

Cultural Training Recommendations 
Training Outline 
Cultural Indoctrination 
Comparison of cultural values and social structures (e.g., 
United States compared to those of the area of operations). 
Local customs and traditions (e.g., greetings, etiquette, 
good or proper behavior). 
Geopolitical history (classical through contemporary eras 
and the orientation of each faction or party). 
The role of religion in daily life. 
Cultural Awareness 
How to gain acceptance and trust. 
How to maintain a neutral perspective (e.g., avoiding 
stereotyping and being aware of bias). 
How to gain cooperation during investigations and 
information gathering sessions. 
How to avoid embarrassing or potentially dangerous 
situations. 
How to recognize and mitigate culture shock. 
Resources 
Guest speakers from the country of interest (e.g., 
nongovernmental staff, foreign students, recent immigrants, 
or selected refugees). 
Others who have worked in or studied the mission area 
(e.g., special operations personnel, diplomats, and 
scholars, credible news sources). 
Format 
Combination of briefings, small group discussions, and 
question and answer periods. 
Handouts to augment, not replace, speakers. 
Visual media, specifically, slides and videos of the mission 
area. 
8. Culture Shock
Culture shock is the anxiety experienced by people in a completely new 
environment, or who do not know what is appropriate or inappropriate.  
The four general stages in the culture shock process are enthusiasm, withdrawal, 
reemergence, and achievement. See figure 14 to view the process and effects of 
culture shock. 
Common examples of culture shock: 
Treatment of animals (public slaughter of animals for celebration, etc.). 
Public punishments or executions. 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
79 
Open prayer in the workplace. 
Physical contact and personal hygiene. 
Operational skills and safety standards. 
Public restrooms. 
Food and drink. 
Treatment of troops, children, and genders. 
Figure 14. Stages of Culture Shock 
Culture shock is a normal part of the advisor’s adjustment process. To cope with 
culture shock, advisors should be patient, maintain contact (with team members and 
new culture), and accept the new culture as different. Advisors should be prepared 
to accept things in the local culture that seem culturally wrong. They should try to 
learn at least a little bit of the local language while attempting to reduce stress. 
The advisor team must understand the effects culture shock will have on 
them. Culture shock comes from: 
(a) Living and working for a period of time in a different environment.
(b) Having values team members hold as absolute brought into question
because of cultural differences.
(c) Being constantly put into situations where advisor team members are
expected to function with maximum proficiency, but where the rules have not
been adequately explained.

15 June 2023 
Generally, the feeling of culture shock sets in after the first two weeks of 
arriving in a new place. Culture shock occurs because the mind and body have to 
go through a period of psychological and physiological adjustment when 
individuals move from a familiar environment to an unfamiliar one. 
The “spoken” rules of a culture (such as favored foods) may not be simple or 
pleasant to adopt. The “unspoken” rules are even more difficult to understand or 
adopt. Creative advisors will be able to extract basic information on why similar 
acts are performed differently. Also, FSF may have culture-based expectations 
that are unfamiliar to the advisors. These situations occur everywhere during the 
first few months in a new country. 
Some of the differences between life at home and life in a new place are 
obvious. Other differences that are not as obvious include the following. 
(a) How people make decisions.
(b) How people spend their leisure time.
(c) How people resolve conflicts.
(d) How people express feelings and emotions, meanings of gestures, facial
expressions, and other body language.
Common reactions to culture shock include the following. 
(a) Irritability, even anger, directed toward one’s own group or organization.
(b) Feeling isolated or alone.
(c) Tiring easily.
(d) Changes in normal sleep patterns (e.g., too much sleep, insomnia).
(e) Suffering minor but persistent body pains, especially in the head, neck,
back, and stomach.
(f) Hostility and contempt directed towards local people.
(g) Withdrawal (e.g., spending excessive amounts of time reading or listening
to music or avoiding contact with host or partner nationals).
Ways to fight culture shock include the following. 
(a) Become familiar with the language used in the new area. It is one of the
most important advantages for the advisor. An ability to communicate in the
new culture, even at a very basic level, goes a long way toward shortening
the period of adjustment.
(b) Seek those with previous experience in the area.
(c) Develop a portable hobby.
(d) Be patient; the process of adaptation to new situations takes time.
(e) Learn to be constructive. If an unfavorable encounter occurs, advisors
should learn from it and not get in that position again.

ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
81 
(f) Do not try too hard; patiently adjust.
(g) Learn to regularly exercise. This helps combat stress in a constructive
manner. Advisors could swim, run, or do whatever is appropriate in the area.
(h) Relax and meditate. These techniques have proven to be very positive for
people who are passing through periods of stress.
(i) Maintain contact with teammates and pay attention to relationships with
them. This increases a feeling of belonging and reduces feelings of loneliness
and alienation. Teammates can serve as support in difficult times.
(j) Maintain contact with the new culture.
(k) Accept the new culture. Advisors should focus on getting through the
transition. They should try to think of one thing each day that’s interesting or
likeable about the new environment.
(l) Establish simple goals and continuously evaluate progress. Advisors
should find ways to live with things that are not 100 percent satisfactory.
(m) Maintain confidence in self, the organization, and own abilities.
(n) Look for help when feeling stressed. Uncertainties and confusion will
continue to present themselves. Advisors should imagine how a local resident
might react to living in the United States. They should observe how people in
the new environment act in situations that are confusing. Advisors should try
to understand what they believe and why they behave as they do.
(o) Avoid judging things as either right or wrong; regard them as merely
different.
(p) Remember the methods that were successful in reducing stress in difficult
situations in the past and apply those methods to the present circumstances.
(q) Try to see the humor in confusing or frustrating situations; laughter is
often the best medicine.
(r) Accept the challenge of learning to live and function in a new cultural
setting. Advisors should believe in one’s on ability to learn the skills to make a
satisfactory transition.
(s) Gradually try to apply some of the learned skills.
(t) Recognize the advantages of having lived in two different cultures.
Meeting people with different cultural backgrounds can enrich one’s life.
Advisors should share time with many different people. They should avoid
having only US friends, but maintain strong personal ties to the United States.
They can think about ways to help local residents learn what US citizens
believe and how they act.
(u) Acknowledge even slight progress in adjusting to the new culture.
Advisors should recognize, like many who have adjusted to difficult and alien
environments, anyone can make a successful adjustment to the new culture.

Family and Kinship. In many societies, every action or decision is made within the 
context of family and kinship. In most societies, inheritance (transfer of property) and 
succession (transfer of social position) take place within kin groups. Inheritance and 
succession occur through either the father’s line to the son’s or the mother’s line to 
the daughter’s and may differ even between neighboring tribes. In some cultures, 
earned wealth and social status mean nothing compared to one’s position within the 
family. Clans and tribes war against others for many generations in response to 
84 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76

grievances going back thousands of years. Arranged marriages settle disputes, unite 
powerbases, and consolidate wealth. 
Sex and Gender. Every culture distinguishes between men and women, although 
different societies attach their own social meanings to them. Gender often 
determines social relations involving power, individuals, group identities, and 
meaning and value. 
Sustenance and Health. Societies have different methods of transforming natural 
resources into food. Sustenance encompasses what and how we eat; how we 
prepare food; and when, where, and with whom we eat. Food getting, or a 
subsistence strategy, is an essential part of human culture and serves as a basis for 
cultural differences. Sustenance influences residential patterns, family life and 
kinship systems, methods of exchange, and structures of power and prestige. 
Theories of disease and healing practices are part of all cultures, and medical 
systems serve as an adaptive response to disease and illness. 
Language and Communication. Language is crucial to establishing social 
relationships. By translating experience into language, humans gain knowledge that 
can be communicated to new members of a group or society. People use language 
to teach culture.  
Learning and Knowledge. Human beings depend on the social, not biological, 
transmission of knowledge for survival. Teaching children the skills and knowledge 
they need to function as adults in society is practiced in every culture, although 
societies vary in their teaching approaches. Human social organization and group 
living provide the basic context for growth and learning (e.g., what children learn 
from their parents). Learning is not always at the conscious, formal level. In Western 
societies, the long period of human childhood dependency provides cultural learning. 
Religion and Spirituality. Religion may be defined as a set of beliefs concerning 
the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe. It often involves belief in a god or 
gods, usually involves devotional and ritual observances, and often contains a moral 
code governing the conduct of human affairs. For the purpose of this publication, 
religion is a system cultures use to provide meaning, unity, peace of mind, and 
control over events in society. It often helps preserve social order. By defining an 
individual’s place in society and the cosmos, religion provides people a sense of 
personal identity and belonging. Spirituality is a broader term than religion. It also 
refers to philosophical or psychological core commitments and values that, similarly, 
provide a sense of identity, meaning, and purpose. 
Political and Social Relations. Political organization is the patterned way of 
applying power in a group to regulate behavior, and exists in all societies. Different 
cultures have diverse approaches to social interactions and include various social 
groups that may interact differently. The authority to make decisions that affect 
public interest is a part of social relations and is linked to kinship, economics, and 
religion. People may become leaders because of their positions as heads of families, 
their lineages, or clans, or based on claims of divine right to rule. In some societies, 
the coordination and regulation of behavior are in the hands of religious 
practitioners.

Economics and Resources. The economics and resources domain refers to ways 
in which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed in a society. 
They reflect choices people make regarding their livelihood. Notably, economics and 
resources are equally influenced by tradition, technology, and the environment. 
Time and Space. The perception of time differs among cultures. A culture with a 
highly linear orientation toward time, like North America, sees it as a limited 
commodity to be used efficiently towards problem-solving or coming to agreement. 
Nonlinear cultures have a longer view of time. Consequently, there may be less 
pressure to accomplish things quickly. Additionally, the concept of personal space or 
distance and their significance often varies between cultures. 
History and Myth. History is the study of the past. It is a component of human 
knowledge, in general, along with cultural and scientific knowledge. While myth is 
often associated with fiction and the supernatural, it also embodies popular ideas 
about the natural world and historical events in a particular culture. It implies that a 
group or society telling a myth believes it is true. In societies throughout the world, 
mythical truths become customs that are passed on through the generations. Myth 
and history are interrelated. 
Aesthetics and Recreation. In every society, people express themselves in ways 
that surpass the need for physical survival. Every culture has its own forms of 
creative expression, guided by aesthetic principles of imagination, beauty, skill, and 
style. These expressions are in art, music, sport, clothing, rest, and leisure. 
Technology and Material. Societies use technology to transform the material 
environment. Technology includes the raw materials, tools, knowledge, and 
procedures needed to produce and manufacture material goods in a basic agrarian 
or a complex industrial society. Cultural values determine technology development 
and use. Values and patterns in this domain have a significant impact on the 
environment. Two of the most important sources of environmental impact are 
consumer desires and the energy needs of industrial nations. 
10. Advisors and Cultural Relations
Setting the Example. Setting the example for the advisor’s counterpart must be 
an ongoing effort to avoid the appearance of a “do as I say, not as I do” attitude. In 
setting the example, the advisor should make every effort to explain to the 
counterpart that what is being done is the most effective action for the situation. This 
is particularly true when the behavior (or purpose) is not readily understood by the 
counterpart. In following this guidance, the advisor may also reinforce perceived 
competence. 
Compromise. When seeking a compromise with the FSF counterpart, the advisor 
may create a situation in which the counterpart has a personal interest in successful 
execution. In some cultures, seeking a compromise may be desirable to allow the 
counterpart to save face. In certain situations, the counterpart may have a better 
solution to the problem at hand because of practical experience. 
Advisors must recognize when they seek a compromise in certain cultures, 
their perceived competence may suffer. This may be mitigated somewhat by 
86 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
approaching the compromise as two professionals (the advisor and the 
counterpart) reaching a mutual conclusion.  
Note: There are two areas of concern that must never be compromised for the sake of 
maintaining rapport: force protection and human rights. See appendix E for additional 
force protection considerations. 
Advisors must prevent their counterpart (or their counterpart’s subordinates) 
from working the advisor team into the FSF chain of command. Advisors provide 
recommendations, not orders, to their counterparts. Only the counterpart should 
issue orders to the FSF subordinates. 
Family. The concept of family is heavily steeped in religious and cultural norms. 
The family is one of the most influential elements of social institutions. It is the 
starting point for developing all other forms of social organization. Families teach 
individuals what is demanded of them in society and it is where people learn to 
transcend themselves. A person’s first experience with power and authority occurs 
with the family. 
Gender, Age, and Race. Gender, age, and race have the potential to seriously 
affect the mission. One example is the status of females in society. In some 
countries, cultural prohibitions may render a female interpreter ineffective under 
certain circumstances. Another example would be the Balkans, where the ethnic 
divisions may limit the effectiveness of an interpreter from outside the target 
audience’s group. Since traditions, values, and biases vary in each country, state, 
and tribe, it is important to check with the in-country assets or area studies for 
specific taboos or favorable characteristics. 
Religion. Because religion is an integral part of culture, advisors should use 
careful mission preparation and analysis to examine the religions and religious 
groups in the AO for a given mission. Most people practice a religion, and many take 
it very seriously. Religious beliefs, leaders, and institutions are central to the 
worldview of many societies. The impact of religion on the local population must be 
considered when planning any operation. 
Language. 
Communication is the foundational skill of cross-cultural competence and a 
most necessary skill for military advisors. It is important for advisors to be aware 
that linguistic competence and communication competence are not the same 
thing. Whereas it is one thing to be able to speak a language (linguistic 
competence), it is quite another to be able to use a language appropriately and 
effectively in context (communication competence).  
Language is one, but not the only, component of communication 
competence. Misunderstandings can result from different interpretations 
associated with paralanguage and nonverbal communication. (Paralanguage is 
vocal features that accompany speech and contribute to communication but are 
not, generally, considered to be part of the language system as vocal quality 
loudness and tempo.)  
87 
The greater the proficiency in the local language, the quicker an advisor can 
effectively communicate. Reaching a communication level that permits the 
advisor or liaison to understand nuances and inferred or implied messages vastly 
enhances the probability of mission accomplishment. However, this can take 
months or years of training and exposure. As a minimum, the successful advisor 
studies common phrases used in the AO. While proficiently using an interpreter 
can be substituted for language ability, interpreter usage always diminishes the 
capability to effectively and confidently communicate. Language proficiency and 
properly using interpreters require significant training.  
FSF Subculture. Advisors should not assume all military or security force 
subcultures mirror that of the United States. The FSF’s chain of command will be 
unique within each country and may differ from the United States. Leaders in 
positions of authority and command may have gained their positions through 
nepotism, political appointment, or corruption. Their culture may not allow 
subordinates the ability to influence decisions. Dress and appearance may not be 
held to Western standards, and might tempt the advisor to perceive them as 
unprofessional. 
Developing Rapport. Setting the example, being open to compromise, and 
recognizing the importance of family, religion, and language can contribute to 
developing good rapport with the advisors’ FSF counterparts. Advisors succeed or 
fail based on the rapport they develop with their FSF counterpart. This rapport can 
add to the success of advising amid the differences in culture, personal experience, 
and language. When thinking about rapport between an advisor and an FSF 
counterpart, advisors should focus on developing mutual understanding, respect, 
and trust. The advisor should seek to understand first, then be understood. By 
placing the FSF counterpart first, the advisor is paving the road for respect and trust. 
Understanding. Advisors should broaden their knowledge of the AO by studying 
its history, politics, language, society, and culture. Interpreters can offer valuable 
insight into local culture. However, their insight may be biased, general, or very 
narrow. For initial research, the Central Intelligence Agency World Fact Book is a 
consolidated reference source for geographical, political, and other societal 
information.  
Respect. Advisors should maintain integrity, look for admirable qualities and areas 
of interest to respect in counterparts, and show a sincere interest in them. 
Trust. An advisor-counterpart relationship will eventually develop into strong trust 
when built on shared understanding and respect. Advisors should understand what 
comprises a promise in the local culture. They should show reliability and follow 
through on commitments. Advisors must not give the impression of a promise for 
anything they might not be able to deliver. 
Personal Issues. FSF counterparts may want to speak with advisors about 
personal issues. Here are some guidelines for dealing with personal questions. 
Be careful when talking about religion, regardless of personal beliefs. 
Be careful regarding talk about women to prevent shaming the counterpart.

15 June 2023 
Be careful if asked about sex, drugs, or alcohol. Be aware of the roles of 
these topics in their culture before answering. This may be a test. 
Chain of Command Communications. 
FSF. Effective communication is essential for an advisor-counterpart 
relationship. Advisors should stress using proper channels at all echelons. 
Advisors must keep the FSF unit’s leaders informed of advice the team has given 
to FSF subordinates. FSF officers should be encouraged to pass information up, 
down, and across the chain of command and staff channels. While encouraging 
open and honest communication with the FSF chain of command and staff 
channels, the advisor must keep in mind the affects that culture and command 
climate play on how honest and open the FSF communication channels are.  
US Advising Chains of Command. There will likely be an advising chain of 
command as well as staff and functional area channels. US personnel in the 
advising chain of command and acting as the relevant staff or functional area 
POCs should be kept informed of advice the team has offered to their 
counterparts. Advisors must be trusted and empowered by the chain of 
command to make communication decisions without fear of retribution. The 
unique nature of the advising team dictates that they have liberal direct liaison 
authorities. These authorities do not relieve the advising team of the 
responsibility to keep their chain of command and relevant staff informed if they 
have coordinated with higher headquarters. 
Technical Control (TECHCON) 
TECHCON is an Australian doctrine term, but has been applied with success in 
Afghanistan and with the International Security Assistance Force. The advisor 
network can utilize a communication structure defined as TECHCON. TECHCON 
is the provision of specialist and technical advice by designated authorities for 
the management and operation of forces to influence FSF systems. If the FSF 
are unable to solve a problem, advisors can seek assistance from any other 
advisors along the functional process—from the lowest tactical level up to the 
government level. This TECHCON communication network is not a chain of 
command, rather it is a pathway to vertically integrate FSF systems. The 
advisor’s TECHCON channels are designed to resolve FSF issues that arise 
during operations. There are numerous instances where advisors cannot resolve 
FSF process issues because of the many cross-functional interactions and the 
problem requiring operational/strategic-level command influence. Past efforts to 
overcome these obstacles resulted in stagnation and frustration due to attempts 
by advisors to resolve issues at only one level of command. Using TECHCON 
allows issues to be tackled by multiple advisors at multiple levels simultaneously. 
SOURCE: Resolute Support Security Force Assistance Guide 3.1, 
1 July 2014 
Note: TECHCON is not a command relationship like operational control or 
administrative control. It is a way of interpreting the team of teams that are all aiming at 
achieving a bigger set of objectives. Understanding the efforts of the teams to the left

and right in other agencies and communicating with them will help coordinate the efforts 
of the whole. 
Customs and Courtesies. Observe local customs and courtesies. Advisors should 
seek to understand the counterpart’s customs and social structure on which they are 
built (e.g., local tribal dynamics). Counterparts senior in grade should be treated 
accordingly. If warranted by the FSF customs, and in keeping with the local force 
protection posture, advisors should salute senior-ranking personnel. Advisors should 
refer to such individuals by their rank (as customs permit) and show them respect 
and deference. Although FSF officers may have no command authority over the 
advisor, effectiveness is greatly enhanced when the advisor displays respect for the 
counterpart and the FSF chain of command. 
Social Dynamics. People throughout the world have developed various methods 
of social organization based on varying and fluid or fixed and rigid social identities. 
Often, social organization and social identity are overlapping constructs which are 
occasionally in conflict with one another. If advisors look at their own lives, they can 
see various layers of social identity and organization similarly in conflict with one 
another. At the core of any culture is the structure of the society. Societal structures 
can range from nationalistic to tribal. The most common social structure advisors will 
encounter in the developing world will be tribalism. Tribalism is a normal cultural 
component in a large portion of the world. Common themes in tribal cultures are 
pride, revenge, hospitality, honor, brotherhood, and warrior ethos. 
Understanding Tribalism. Many US forces do not understand tribalism. The 
following are several benefits to individuals in a tribal society. 
(a) Tribes serve as social safety nets in countries lacking strong centralized
governments.
(b) Tribes provide a sense of belonging and community.
(c) Tribes spread responsibility and risk away from individuals.
(d) Tribes are designed to prevent warfare and chaos. Individual tribal debts
of blood and honor serve as a surrogate to warfare.
(e) Individuals are viewed mostly as how they serve the tribe.
Tribal Dynamics.
(a) Advisors should seek to understand the specific tribal dynamics within the
FSF they are advising and the local populace. They should not ask a tribe
member to do something contrary to the wishes of the tribe (e.g., go arrest a
relative). Advisors must appeal to the tribal sense of honor and warrior ethos
to influence tribe members. Figure 15 illustrates the loyalties found in tribal
culture and is representative of most tribal societies.

Figure 15. Tribal Society 
(b) While tribalism exists in many forms, it is, generally, characterized by
familial bonds strengthened through intermarriage and the possession of a
common tribal origination. Tribes develop norms and rules that structure
behavior towards members of the tribe and toward other tribes. Generally,
these rules regard the welfare of the tribe over the welfare of the individual.
These rules focus on structuring the competition for resources, spouses, and
power as well as establishing forms of social welfare. At times, these rules
may come into conflict with other means of social organization, such as
national or religious laws.
Tribal Structures. Ethnic, religious, and civic nationalism are relatively new 
forms of social organization, and their identities often conflict with tribal norms 
and rules. Dealing with tribalism is a vital and difficult task when establishing, 
building, and strengthening national governments. Even within a theater, the 
nature and challenges presented by different tribal structures will vary 
geographically and across tribes.  
Traditions and Rules. 
(a) Tribal rules and traditions provide challenges and opportunities for the
advisor. A thorough knowledge of tribal governance and traditions is required
to tailor actions across the political, military, economic, social, information,
and infrastructure (PMESII) spectrum. Rules and traditions are often
comprehensive and regulate political action (e.g., ties to the government and
other tribes), economic behavior (e.g., smuggling, farming, toll-taking), and
social behavior (e.g., roles of men, women, children, marriage and divorce,
sexuality, and drug use).
(b) Tribal rules may provide means to tie tribes that resist authority into
evolving government structures. Conversely, some tribal structures are
extremely egalitarian with little or no sanction placed on a head of household
who refuses to observe a given tribal rule or tradition. Rules and traditions will
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
91 
vary across tribes and may even vary within the same tribe. Also, long 
periods of conflict and noncontiguous geographic arrangements may weaken 
the role of tribal law. A detailed understanding of tribal rules and traditions 
must be gained through interaction with tribal elders and determination of the 
extent to which these rules are followed. 
Identity. Tribal identity can be fluid or fixed. It may be subordinate or superior 
to other identities (e.g., religious identity, national identity, ethnic identity, or 
familial identity). Identity may vary across the tribe. Tribal identity may be 
enmeshed with ethnic or religious identity or may be separate and cut across 
ethnic and religious lines. Often, tribal identity is stronger in rural and weaker in 
urban areas. Geographic dispersion into noncontiguous enclaves can weaken 
tribal identity, especially in areas where different tribal organizations are 
commingled. Often, tribal identity is compartmentalized into ethnic or supratribal 
identity and subtribal identity (and into smaller categories or branches). Tribe 
members, often, will consider themselves first as members of the closest, 
smallest group. For example, they are branch “w” of subtribe “x” as opposed to a 
member of subtribe “x” from tribe “y,” or a member of tribe “y” from ethnic group 
“z.” The smaller the tribal affiliation (i.e., a branch of a subtribe), the stronger the 
identity will be. Different subtribes within the same tribe may compete over 
resources and power. A strong sense of tribal identity among members of the 
FSF can result in conflicts within or among developing national forces and 
prevent effective units from evolving unless there is intervention by advisors.  
Boundaries. The geographic extent, distribution, and contiguousness of a 
tribe are vital to understanding the implications of a particular tribe within the 
advisor’s AO. Generally, the larger the geographic area of a tribe and the more 
contiguous its tribal boundaries, the more power tribal leaders will have over the 
actions of their tribe. Additionally, small, but contiguous enclaves of different 
tribal groups may create a highly unstable environment. Often, administrative 
boundaries, including district, province, and national boundaries, will not align 
with tribal boundaries. This is particularly true in countries where colonial powers 
arbitrarily drew boundaries without consideration of tribal demarcation lines. 
Tribal Ties. To deal with issues arising from tribes, governors or sub-
governors, and the FSF from adjoining administrative areas need to work jointly 
with tribal leaders to develop solutions for tribally based problems. This may 
include working with leaders across national borders. Geographically dispersed 
tribes that exist in small enclaves across wide swaths of land will, generally, have 
weaker tribal governance structures, increasing the importance of local tribal 
leaders. Tribal ties are often maintained across geographical space through 
intermarriage and visits. Dispersion is used to maintain trading routes and 
economic activities, such as smuggling. These tribal ties may allow insurgents to 
operate in one area while exploiting administrative and military boundaries in 
another area. To deny safe haven, the FSF require detailed understanding and 
coordination by military and civilian leaders to prevent exploitation.

15 June 2023 
Access to Patronage. In most tribal constructs, tribal leadership is expected 
to provide patronage to tribe members in the form of wealth, jobs, and goods. 
Ineffective tribal leaders will bankrupt themselves on these provisions, setting the 
stage for others to step in. However, conflict situations, illicit trade, and 
government corruption can result in upsetting the normal economy, fluctuating 
balance of patronage goods available. Understanding the means of obtaining 
and distributing patronage is vital. Advisors must understand how their 
counterpart uses patronage to navigate the informal and formal systems in a 
collectivist culture (e.g., centralized social and economic control).  
Tribal Leadership. Leadership in tribal systems varies across tribes. It is vital 
to understand who the leaders are and the nature of their tribal leadership. Some 
are based on kinship to the leader passed from brother to brother or father to 
son. In other cases, religious connections may result in leadership positions 
within the tribe. In times of conflict, traditional leadership may become 
destabilized and military capability (e.g., the ability to provide security) can result 
in new leaders arising outside traditional nobility or religious families. Intratribal 
conflict is often the result of conflicting claims on leadership, particularly based 
on postconflict rivalries between tribal elders. Conflicting claims on tribal 
leadership can result in significant unrest, and leaders may turn to either the 
government or its opposition to gain support for their claims. Advisors must 
understand the leadership dynamics of a tribe to ensure they are dealing with the 
underlying causes of unrest in a particular area and not simply fueling an ongoing 
intratribal rivalry. In addition, areas where leadership remains relatively stable 
and unchallenged present opportunities to gain tribal support through close 
collaboration with tribal leaders.

Chapter V 
WORKING WITH FOREIGN SECURITY FORCES’ PARTNER 
ORGANIZATIONS 
1. Advisor Team Challenges
This chapter provides a method to help an advisor team establish credibility with 
US coalition units and other organizations or agencies sharing their AO. While many 
organizational leaders understand the value of the advisor team, they may have 
difficultly integrating these organizations with FSF units and the advisor team. 
Advisor team leaders should prepare their teams for an initial worst-case scenario 
when it comes to coordinating operations or other activities with these units. Items to 
consider:  
Advisors may not have conducted predeployment training with the units in 
the advisor’s AO. 
US or coalition units may be unaware of the advising team’s specialized 
predeployment training and capabilities. 
Other units may not be familiar with the FSF leaders, capabilities, or 
limitations in the AO. One selling point to the partnering organization is the 
advising team can offer a deep understanding of the FSF, including personalities, 
culture, and human networks. 
NGOs may have biases or restrictions against working with US military 
organizations like the advisor’s team.  
Third-country militaries operating unilaterally will present similar challenges 
as those mentioned in the previous paragraphs. Advisor teams should always 
seek guidance and, possibly, the authority to coordinate with third-country 
militaries. 
Regardless of the origin or type of organization, FSF units may be wary and 
untrusting of the advisor’s team. This may stem from bias, past experiences, or 
lack of information. 
There will be wariness and mistrust based on crucial unknown qualities. 
2. Organizational Perspectives and Developing Unity of Effort
The key to working with other organizations is understanding their perspectives, 
roles, and relationships. Nonmilitary organizations do not operate within military or 
governmental hierarchies. Military policies, processes, and procedures are different 
from those of civilian organizations and may present significant challenges to 
interorganizational coordination. Some organizations have policies directly opposed 
to those of the US Government, particularly the US military. Although they may not 
be hostile towards the United States or its goals, they do not cooperate to maintain a 
perception of neutrality. 
It is important to remember the following points about another organization’s 
perspective. 
94 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
Core Values and Authorities. Like the military, each agency or organization 
has specific core values and authorities that provide the scope of their 
operations. 
Focus. Each organization has individual organizational perspectives and 
agendas that do not always coincide with military goals. 
Policies and Procedures. Other organizations often have different, and 
sometimes conflicting, policies, procedures, and decision-making techniques. 
Structure. The military relies on structured, hierarchical decision-making 
processes; detailed planning; and standardized TTP. Civilian organizational 
structure is more horizontal. It may employ similar principles but not with the 
same degree of structural process. 
Decision-making. Decision-making processes may be more ad hoc, 
collaborative, and collegial. Field coordinators may not have the authority to 
speak for the parent organization, which makes decision-making at lower levels 
impossible. 
Reduction of Uncertainty. Crisis action planning, generally, is not a core or 
defining mission for other organizations. Crises divert attention, resources, and 
personnel from other priorities. Different agency perspectives, capabilities, and 
interests may conflict with how to execute missions and carry out policies in a 
crisis. 
Mutually Supportive Interests. Cooperation among US military, international 
organizations, NGOs, and the private sector is based on perceived mutually-
supportive interests, rather than a formalized agreement. 
Long-term and Short-term Objectives. Other organizations and the US 
military’s view of long-term and short-term is different. A year or two may be 
viewed as long-term at the tactical level. Whereas organizations involved in 
nation building (e.g., USAID) develop 5-year, short-term plans and 30-year, long-
term plans. 
To avoid unnecessary conflict, advisors must identify common understandings, 
opportunities for cooperation, and a unifying goal. Finding a common goal becomes 
more difficult as the number of organizations increases and should not concede the 
authority, roles, or core competencies of individual agencies. Conducting 
interagency and interorganizational coordination: 
Promotes unity of effort. 
Deconflicts activities. 
Provides a common understanding. 
Facilitates cooperation in areas of common interest. 
Avoids unintended negative consequences when working in the same space.

3. Coordination, Collaboration, and Liaison
Coordination. Civilian agencies tend to operate via coordination and 
communication structures, rather than C2 structures. Although there is no command 
relationship between military and civilian organizations, clearly defined relationships 
may foster harmony and reduce friction. 
Collaboration. Effective operations require close coordination, cooperation, and 
information across military, interagency, and nongovernmental entities. The most 
common technique for promoting collaboration is forming a civil-military operations 
center (see JP 3-57, Civil Military Operations, or FM 3-57, Civil Affairs Operations). 
Liaison. Direct, early liaison is a valuable source of accurate, timely information, 
especially where involvement by civilian agencies and organizations may precede 
military forces and present opportunities to enhance force effectiveness significantly. 
An additional benefit is an opportunity to build working relationships based on trust 
and open communications among all organizations. Ongoing liaison and an 
exchange of liaison personnel with engaged organizations are equally important. 
4. Tips for Interaction
Recognize all US Government agencies, departments, international 
organizations, NGOs, and private-sector groups in the AO. See appendix F for a 
discussion on other stakeholders. 
If applicable, meet with other US Government agencies, NGOs, or international 
organization representatives early to understand their roles and responsibilities, 
policies, procedures, and goals. Ensure they understand the military’s mission, 
goals, and objectives. 
Understand how they conduct planning and vice versa. Consider creating an 
integrated planning team or other temporary entity to address how military activities 
may be synchronized to complement their work. 
Form a unifying goal with a desired end state. Spend time on clarifying and 
restating the goals to be achieved. 
Support their objectives by tying short-term projects with long-term goals, without 
compromising the military mission. 
Accept that they may not be able to allocate resources to achieve short-term 
results. Using resources of other US Government agencies is governed by law (e.g., 
the Economy Act), policy, and regulation. Advisors should involve the staff judge 
advocate and comptroller to ensure compliance. Since advisor teams do not deploy 
with a staff judge advocate or comptroller, this requires reachback to the advisor’s 
home station. 
Continuously exchange information (within security restrictions) to avoid 
confusion over objectives, differences in procedures, resource limitations, and 
shortfalls or overlaps of authorities. Exchange LNOs, if acceptable to the other 
organization.

Never drop in on an international organization or NGO. Arrange meetings 
deliberately. Give them the option of meeting inside or outside military installations to 
maintain their appearance of neutrality. 
Do not refer to NGOs or international organizations as force multipliers, partners, 
or any term that may compromise their neutrality. 
Do not interfere with their work with the civilian population, to include elements 
deemed as unfriendly. 
Be understanding if another organization, even within the US Government, 
decides not to participate in a project or program. 
Respect views on bearing arms within NGO or international organization sites. 
Use bridging agencies (e.g., the USAID Office of Civilian-Military Cooperation or 
United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator) to coordinate with other organizations 
(e.g., Doctors without Borders). 
Ensure all organizations, sharing responsibility for the job, receive appropriate 
recognition. This recognition strengthens the bonds of interdependence and 
encourages each stakeholder to participate in the process by validating and 
reinforcing roles and responsibilities. 
5. Other Guidelines
The following are guidelines for nonmilitary organizations when working with the 
military. These examples are published by the United States Institute for Peace 
(USIP) and are typical practices by nonmilitary organizations. 
Do not wear military styled clothing. This does not preclude protective gear 
(e.g., helmets, protective vests, etc.). 
Travel in military vehicles should be limited to the practical extent. 
Avoid collocating in facilities used by the military. 
Use the organization’s own logos on clothing, vehicles, and buildings. 
Prearrange visits to military installations and sites. 
 Minimize activities at military bases, except for liaison arrangements. 
Request military protection for humanitarian assistance convoys, to take 
advantage of logistic support, or for evacuation (e.g., medical or from a hostile 
environment) only as a last resort.

The Ugly American, by Eugene Burdick and William Lederer. A novel that 
highlights US cultural tendencies towards hubris and offending the populace of a 
host nation. This is a common read within the DOS, which will not only help advisors 
gain self-awareness, but give them common ground with advisors of other agencies.

7. Initial Employment Activities
When the advisor’s team arrives in theater, the advisor will have to make three 
initial assessments during the relief in place (RIP) or transfer of authority (TOA) 
period. These cover:  
The effectiveness of the advisor team being replaced. 
The US and coalition unit operating in the AO. 
The FSF unit. 
The first and most important assessment the advisor must make is of the 
outgoing team to determine if the advisors were successful during their tour. If they 
have good relationships with both the FSF unit and the US unit, the SOPs may be 
valuable and the incoming advisor can continue the established relationships. If the 
incoming team determines the outgoing team was ineffective, then it can begin 
making lists of things to fix and relationships to build.  
8. Remove Misunderstanding and Mistrust
“I was escorting my Iraqi battalion commander, a colonel, around a newly 
established US patrol base located near one of his checkpoints. A US Specialist 
(E-4) approached my Iraqi battalion commander, grabbed his shoulder, spun him 
around, and said ‘dude, let me see your pistol!’ After apologizing for the US 
Soldier’s breach of military customs and courtesies, I spent the rest of the day 
explaining to the Iraqi commander why our Army, after 4 years, couldn’t tell an 
Iraqi private from a colonel.” 
—Operation IRAQI FREEDOM Battalion Military 
Transition Team Leader 
Advisor team members should receive specialized training in the culture and 
language of the FSF. At the end of the RIP or TOA process, the advisor will have 
interacted with the FSF and generated a unique comfort level with them because of 
familiarity.  
Through these interactions, the advisor will learn cultural lessons and nuances 
that help mitigate the team making any cultural missteps. However, 
misunderstandings are going to happen, and it is in those times that advisors will 
need to lean on the capital they have built in terms of rapport and respectful patterns 
of behavior to remove misunderstandings and avoid them turning into mistrust. The 
most effective way to capitalize on this information is to share it abundantly with all 
members of the advisor team.

9. Support Operations
FSF logistics are important while building capabilities. An advisor may end up in a 
situation where the PN’s functioning support system precludes the advisor becoming 
involved in supporting the FSF. Conversely, it is possible that at some point during 
the tour, an advisor will request every class of supply while supporting the FSF unit. 
While trying to get the unit to be self-sufficient, the advisor must keep them 
functioning within their national maintenance and supply systems—keeping the 
logistics solutions sustainable for the FSF in the long-term.  
There are times the advisor will provide logistical support to the FSF unit simply 
to maintain a relationship with the FSF commander. This is a cultural reality. FSF 
leaders may attempt to get as much material support as possible, far beyond what 
they reasonably need, simply because it is there for the taking. This is a common 
situation where the advisor must identify what the FSF unit truly needs versus what 
they want. Do not assume this is a product of greed as much as it is a display of 
status. The more stuff one has, the more powerful and the better officer one is. The 
advisor team provides the reality check to the process: an evaluation on whether the 
support is more of a benefit as a way of filling a short-term capacity gap or more of a 
crutch that conditions the FSF to rely on advisor logistics, rather than addressing its 
own sustainment shortcomings. The advisor must understand the FSF processes 
and improve them as necessary within the context and culture of the FSF’s OE. 
Logistical support represents one of the best leverage tools the advisor has to 
motivate the FSF unit. It is a bargaining chip, and the FSF commander can use it to 
get what the unit wants by trading concessions for things the advisor wants. An 
example would be an FSF commander who wants all the accessories to make 
vehicles look more like US vehicles. The advisor may be able to fill these repair 
parts requests if the commander establishes and enforces a vehicle maintenance 
program to improve the fleet’s operational readiness rate. Also, keep in mind, this 
type of bartering is common in many parts of the world. By driving hard bargains, the 
advisor may gain respect from FSF officers. If the advisor liberally gives away goods 
and services to the FSF unit, unit personnel may think the advisor is weak, and not 
have respect for and may take advantage of the advisor.  
Advisors can never accept logistical support from the FSF unit they are advising. 
This would give the FSF commander leverage over the advisor team and, thus, 
degrade the advisors’ status and ability to complete the mission. Advisors must have 
access to their own food, electricity generator, fuel, and maintenance support. FSF 
commanders may try to get support items they want by depriving the advisors in 
their compound of desired items (e.g., fuel). By not running their generators during 
the summer months for “lack of fuel,” the FSF commander could deprive the 
advisors of electricity needed to run their computers. This would force the advisors 
to request a fuel resupply the team may not need. If the advisors refuse to accept 
this type of leverage, unnecessary support requests will decrease and the FSF is 
forced to use their supply system.

10. Building FSF Confidence
Advisor team leaders should remember that they are building the confidence of 
the FSF in addition to the tangible measures of the FSF unit (e.g., troop strength, 
combat vehicles, and weapons). This confidence can be established and maintained 
by tactical success. 
If the FSF fail, the local populace may begin to lose confidence in the 
government’s ability to protect them. A string of relatively minor adversary victories 
can cause a widespread loss of FSF morale and influence public opinion in a way 
that wins criminal elements favor. In short, the FSF must be prepared for operations 
so they have every possible advantage. As their competence and confidence grow, 
these forces can assume complex assignments.  
The general concept is for the advisor team to partner with the FSF unit in 
training or operations as the team’s authorities allow. The extent to which the 
advisors take lead, mentor, and observe FSF preparation and execution activities 
depends on evaluations of the FSF and the progress of previous advisor teams. For 
newly formed or low-performing FSF, the advisor team will take the lead and show 
the basic steps of FSF operations. Over time, the FSF unit will feel confident enough 
to take over operations as the lead force with an end state of trained, manned, and 
equipped FSF conducting independent operations. The oversight and integration of 
FSF and advisors will naturally extend beyond the operations themselves, to include: 
Including FSF commanders in debriefing higher headquarters. 
Mentioning FSF to press organizations. 
Distributing military means recovered from tactical operations (e.g., weapons, 
ammunition, vehicles, and equipment). This may be a useful source of spare 
parts for FSF equipment. US forces must ensure their conduct, as well as that of 
FSF with which they operate, does not include pillaging—the taking of private or 
public movable property, including enemy military equipment, for private or 
personal use, where that use is not justified by military necessity. Through 
general orders or similar directives, the CCDR or other competent authority may 
authorize retaining enemy or belligerent military equipment for reasons other 
than military necessity (e.g., war souvenirs). The wrongful retention of 
unauthorized war souvenirs (trophies) or taking private property is punishable 
under Article 108a, Captured or Abandoned Property, and Article 121, Larceny 
and Wrongful Appropriation, of Title 10 USC, Chapter 47, Uniform Code of 
Military Justice. Unlawful firearms importation into the US carries an additional 
penalty.  
Allowing FSF units to take possession of and process any detainees or 
evidence.

Chapter VI 
OBSERVATIONS AND INSIGHTS FROM FORMER ADVISORS 
Note: This chapter appears after the chapters on advisor skills, culture, and working 
with FSF to summarize those lessons in the form of TTP from advisors that have gone 
before. The style is different and the entire chapter is intended not as a set of rules to 
live by, but to present some of the nuances that advisors have stumbled through in the 
past. The TTP are for awareness and may or may not fit the context of the advising 
mission. 
1. Recommended Practices for Working with Counterparts by Former Advisors
Note: Some of the recommendations in this section fit only to missions where advisors 
have the authority to accompany their partner forces on combat operations. 
Practice Cultural Awareness. Advisors need to become well acquainted with the 
culture of the people with whom they will work. Cultural awareness yields situational 
awareness and leads to increased force protection for the advisor and the advisor 
team. Learn enough of the language for simple conversation. Know the basics and 
use them from the first meeting (e.g., hello, please, thank you, yes, no, and 
goodbye). Language demonstrates a willingness to understand and be competent in 
the PN’s culture. During an advisor mission, the relationship continues to evolve 
both when working and socializing; advisors must not overlook the opportunities to 
better understand their partners through informal settings. Try to employ fables and 
short stories relevant to the local culture to teach a lesson. Ask questions to illustrate 
a point. Be aware that some US and coalition practices may not be appropriate in 
the counterparts’ culture. Off-handed remarks made in unguarded moments or a 
casual comment can cause problems later on. Avoid sarcastic or condescending 
comments. Such remarks are often misunderstood. In addition, tone of voice or body 
language can change the way information is understood, thereby negating its 
positive intent. Advisors should strive to ensure all their actions and verbal 
communications can be fully understood. Read all available literature (e.g., country 
handbooks) on the local culture but expect cultural shifts to occur more rapidly than 
described in the literature. Remember, the things that do not concern the advisor 
should be left alone. People in developing areas are often inclined to be 
superstitious and secretive and will guard their beliefs and secrets with their lives. 
Respect ranks and positions of counterparts. Accept local nationals and respect 
them as individuals; treat them with dignity. When associating with PN officers and 
local officials, dignify their positions. They often outrank the advisor in their society 
and station. Always demonstrate respect towards counterparts. 
 Be patient. Be flexible and exercise tempered patience. Explain the benefits of 
an action. Get them to accept it as their idea. After the advisor plants an idea, let the 
counterpart modify it and take full credit for it. The advisor’s mission is to enable and 
advise. Consider unit limitations and adjust within the FSF organizational framework. 
Keep an open mind and attempt to operate within the cultural pattern, as closely as 
possible. Humor and laughter are wonderful tools for building rapport, if used in 
102 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
culturally correct ways. The best approaches should include local cultural influences 
and practices to encourage FSF ownership and understanding. Use caution when 
using Western cultural measurements for honesty and morals. In many cultures, 
expect counterparts to be long on promises and short on deliveries. 
Develop ideas and solutions with the FSF counterparts. Be willing to ask for the 
counterparts’ advice. Often, the FSF’s solutions are preferable, in the long run, to 
“US solutions,” which may only solve short-term issues. In many cases, FSF will be 
experienced in areas of concern, like cultural issues or local customs and courtesies. 
Skillfully present recommendations that explain the advantages to the FSF 
counterpart. During advising, however, the advisor must stay within the boundaries 
of US and coalition intent while using influence to ensure the FSF counterpart 
retains ownership of the outcome. The advisor’s approach must be based on facts, 
logical reasoning, and sincere attempts to do what is best for the FSF and US and 
coalition forces. Advisors must always be cognizant of presenting a negative view of 
a particular subject (e.g., do not humiliate an FSF commander). If possible, avoid 
making recommendations requiring an immediate decision. For example, expect 
subjects involving religious holidays and operations to take several meetings to gain 
initial decision-making progress. Counterparts must be allowed to exercise their 
prerogatives and not appear to be overly dependent on US and coalition influence. 
Make corrections diplomatically. Praise success and build unit pride. Look for 
things the counterpart is doing well and praise the counterpart on successes. After 
this, the counterpart will be more willing to hear criticism and engage in problem 
solving sessions designed to improve unit effectiveness. Be willing to compromise. 
Never convey the impression that everything the counterpart does is all wrong. 
Instead, an advisor must be prepared to explain the pros and cons of a decision in 
tactical and technical terms easily understood by their counterparts. The advisor 
must provide reasonable alternatives supported by local culture and sound tactics. 
Advisors should never be reluctant to help the counterpart improve, but any 
corrections must be couched with tact. An unwillingness to provide appropriate 
advice may leave the impression the advisor lacks either knowledge or concern. 
Appropriate and timely corrections can engender respect and save the counterpart 
from making costly mistakes. Give advice at appropriate times in appropriate places; 
however, do not harass or berate the FSF counterparts or any local leader. This is 
especially critical when the FSF counterparts are in the presence of subordinates 
since it may degrade their authority.  
Assist and enable, do not command. During planning, stay in the background as 
much as possible. The advisor should act as a catalyst. Never attempt to command 
the counterparts’ organization. Advisors must ensure that they never become part of 
the FSF chain of command and are not considered to be a decision-maker. Refrain 
from coercion or threats (even psychological) as methods to shape the counterpart’s 
decisions. Develop ideas and solutions with the FSF counterparts that are clear, 
simple, measurable, and sustainable after US advisors depart the area. They must 
study the counterparts’ personality and background and make every effort to build 
and maintain friendly relationships based upon professional respect. 
15 June 2023

103 
Remain a broker of honesty and do not align within a certain social or cultural 
standing.  
Keep counterparts informed. The advisor is a bridge in the communications 
network. The advisor needs to ensure that information flows in both directions (i.e., 
US and PN forces). As a corollary, the advisor maintains a continuity book with a 
series of lessons learned and AARs for a RIP or TOA plan on how to work with 
counterparts from day one.  
Be prepared to act as a liaison to multinational units. Liaison is NOT the advisor’s 
primary function, but is a task one must accept, to some degree (e.g., when dealing 
with civil affairs units). Advisors may have to represent their counterparts or defend 
the counterparts’ position in disputes with US agencies. However, this support 
should be based on sound judgment and not blind loyalty. 
Be ready to advise on equipment maintenance. However, refrain from using status 
reports as the most important metric of an FSF unit. The reports are difficult and time 
consuming, and the logistics and maintenance systems may not adhere to FSF 
frameworks. 
 Know small unit tactics and unit security procedures (e.g., base defense). Teach 
hand and arm signals (e.g., universal and quiet language) for actions in combat 
patrolling. Integrate indigenous forces into battle drills, (i.e., teach them what to 
expect from a professional force). During execution, do not get so far ahead of the 
counterpart that the counterpart is lost. Be proficient in all combat skills. Mastery of 
these skills helps establish the advisors’ identity as a professional warfighter. 
Additional subject matter expertise and combat experience help enhance the 
advisors’ position when the FSF counterparts are experienced combat veterans. 
Stay with the unit. When able, advisors should not live separately. Eat their food 
and live in their conditions. Advisors should live as close as possible to those with 
whom they work, but not “go native,” which is a colloquial term in the advising 
community for losing one’s identity and blurring the line between US objectives and 
PN objectives. Advisors are ambassadors for their country and will be evaluated 
accordingly. Be willing to participate actively in local military, athletic, and social 
functions. If unable to accept a social invitation, decline with regrets expressed in 
accordance with the local custom, and invite counterparts to appropriate social 
functions. Ensure partners are active participants as much as possible. Develop a 
sense of identity with the counterparts’ unit or geographic area by spending the 
maximum time at the scene of activity. Advising FSF is a 24-hours a day, 7-days a 
week job. 
Be aware of operations in the area to prevent friendly fire incidents. Advisors act 
as a safety to ensure deconfliction of the AO on behalf of the FSF unit, in addition to 
providing access to coalition effects. These include, for example, quick-reaction 
forces, medical and casualty evacuation for casualties, unmanned aircraft 
surveillance, aviation assets, and combat camera. 
Be objective in reports on unit and leader proficiency. Nothing will be gained from 
glossing over problems. Advisors should report gross corruption or incompetence 
104 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
and guard the confidence partners placed in them. Do not divulge intimate secrets. 
Insist on observing human rights standards. Report violations through the chain of 
command. 
Maintain military bearing and a professional manner, and model good leadership. 
Advisors should be themselves and not pretend. People can recognize a phony. 
Never forget to use the old adage “under-promise and over-deliver” as a valid tactic 
when it comes to promises. Advisors should only make promises they can deliver 
within the limits of their authority. Advisors who oversell themselves may arouse 
suspicion or create false expectations that cannot be met. Advisors should 
demonstrate initiative and inventiveness and encourage this in their counterparts. 
They should encourage counterparts to consider orders they receive and ask for 
clarification or permission to deviate when the need seems obvious. Social networks 
and political structures may cause counterparts to present false understanding and 
compliance in order to avoid reprisal from their commanders. Counterparts also may 
be reluctant to accept ideas or recommendations from subordinate leaders. This 
may occur even if the subordinate has valid ideas. The counterpart can be 
encouraged to accept requests or suggestions from subordinates by highlighting that 
the net gain to unit effectiveness is a reflection of the FSF’s leadership. 
Train security units to standard and fight alongside them, if allowed by mission 
parameters. Encourage continuous training and improvement. Help develop SOPs. 
The amount of advising during combat is small. The advisor does most of the 
advising while preparing for combat. The advisor bases advice on personal 
observations or those of fellow advisors during past operations. Capitalize on the 
strengths of the team to achieve maximum training effectiveness. Never present too 
many subjects at once or unnecessarily prolong a discussion of one subject. Permit 
the FSF counterparts time to take action to correct any deficiencies prior to 
reassessing that area. However, do make sure a subject is discussed until the 
counterpart understands it. Advisors must be prepared to deal with slow or minimal 
progress. Use confidence missions to validate training and gauge progress. 
Suggestions should be within the counterparts’ authority and capability. Advisors 
should take care not to strain their relationship with their counterparts by asking 
them to do the impossible. Encourage frequent inspections of all kinds. Advisors 
may need to help their FSF counterparts understand how frequent inspections help 
them determine the actual condition of their units. However, advisors should verify 
information provided by FSF unit counterparts to ensure assessments are accurate. 
Look ahead. Anticipate the next issue. Take nothing for granted and be prepared 
for surprises. 
2. Advisor Team Activities and Planning Considerations
Battle Rhythm. Advisors should balance their team’s daily schedule, without 
being predictable, and ensure team operations security by developing a battle 
rhythm known only by themselves. The battle rhythm should be flexible with few 
details to accommodate combat operations, FSF training, and team administrative 
requirements. To prevent being predictable, teams should change their battle rhythm 
every 30 days. Events to consider for a team’s battle rhythm are shown in table 12. 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76

Battle Rhythm Events 
• Team battle update briefs.
• Team patrol debriefs.
• Coalition security meetings.
• Precombat inspections.
• Counterpart time.
• Foreign security forces (FSF) battle
update briefs.
• Team maintenance.
• Mission preparation.
• Officer and noncommissioned officer
professional development.
• Training preparation.
• After action reports for FSF.
• FSF maintenance.
• Rehearsals.
• Team physical training.
• Local governance meetings.
Down Time. The rigors of living, working, and fighting alongside FSF counterparts 
will fatigue advisors over time. Advisor teams are small by design and over-worked 
by nature, so the team leader should invest in the mental well-being of the team 
members. It is highly recommended to have a day of no scheduled activity in the 
battle rhythm. Including this day on the team’s schedule will enforce compliance and 
allow the team to unwind and take care of personal needs. 
Interagency Considerations. As external assistance to the local government 
increases, other personnel may be introduced into the area. The FSF advisor can 
expect to find representatives from US governmental or NGOs, international 
organizations, third country nationals, private corporations, and local national 
voluntary organizations involved in tasks such as medical care and agricultural 
development. Assistance brings positive benefits to the FSF, but effective 
coordination may be required by the advisor to ensure all activities are coordinated, 
for maximum impact. The advisor, having the authority, should ensure interagency 
agreements are established as soon as possible. In the absence of such authority, 
the advisor should actively encourage the development of such agreements. The 
advisor can expect to find certain technical agencies and services are extensions of 
local national ministries. These activities and efforts should be integrated into the 
overall plan. This requires the advisor to maintain close coordination with any US 
representative who has responsibility for advising these agencies. 
3. Training FSF
Training/Operations Cycle. 
As part of understanding their environment, advisors should be empathetic to 
the ongoing duties that the FSF are performing outside of the training cycle. 
Many of the countries with which the US partners are battling cartels, 
insurgencies, or other internal stability threats, so it is incumbent upon the 
advisors to work with the FSF leadership to achieve balance among combat, 
training, maintenance, and rest. One solution would be to help FSF develop and 
implement a training and operational cycle akin to a US model, but modified to 
function within FSF terms. 
106 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
FSF “Fight-Train-Leave-Fight” Training Cycle. Using an Army battalion-sized 
model as an example, based on four rifle companies and one headquarters and 
service company, it is possible to develop a training and operational cycle 
balancing all four requirements. One COA would be to establish a 20-day cycle 
with company rotations occurring every 5 days. Calling it a “Fight-Train-Leave-
Fight” rotation, the battalion could implement a system much like a green-amber-
red training and operational cycle. The fight or “green” companies would be 
manned 100 percent and would execute continuous operations for 10 days. 
Another company, the train or “amber” company, would execute command 
maintenance on all its assigned equipment and execute individual task training 
(e.g., first aid, marksmanship, and communication skills) for 5 days. The 
remaining leave or “red” company would be 100 percent on leave for 5 days. The 
headquarters and service company could still rotate FSF home and have 
25 percent of the support personnel and staff gone at any given time. The 
specialty platoons also would rotate through training and maintenance along with 
the rifle companies. If needed, this same model can be used at the platoon level.

Task-oriented Training. Based on the FSF agreed upon mission-essential task 
list, a plan for all individual, collective, and leadership training can be developed and 
approved for use by the FSF. The training the advisor team provides comes from 
relevant doctrine and individual advisor experience. The mission-essential task list is 
standard among the companies and provides assessment criteria. 
Leadership Training. Most of what counterparts learn about leadership is through 
observing the advisor team. Leadership training should be modeled on the principle 
of leadership through example. It is the advisor’s job to reinforce desired values in 
the counterpart’s attitude. The effect of this mindset is the creation of a learning 
organization with professional leaders who are competent and confident. How 
advisors train them on these basic values and effects is the art of advising. Part of 
that art relies on the advisor and advisor team to demonstrate these values and 
effects through their actions. Some suggestions include: 
Allowing the FSF to observe the advisor team as it conducts precombat 
checks and inspections, operation orders, maintenance, and debriefs. 
Training at one level and evaluating two levels down (e.g., a successful 
battalion has lethal platoons).

Teaching the art of command presence and staff ownership by routinely 
taking the higher leadership on subordinate unit missions. 
Coaching the FSF counterpart to conduct thorough unit debriefs after every 
mission or training evolution. 
Coaching the FSF counterpart to start a NCO development program run by 
senior FSF NCOs. 
Advisor’s Approach to FSF Training. 
On-the-job Training. Advisors are equipped to train functional areas and 
systems development within an FSF unit. Unfortunately, defeating the enemy 
requires more than the joint planning process and a solid supply system. 
Coalition forces should assist if the advisor team is unable to provide on-the-job 
training in certain areas. The advisor team can schedule these combined 
operations and use them to train the entire FSF unit structure. In addition to 
training the FSF while conducting the operation, the advisor also can train the 
FSF staff and FSF logistics units to track and support the events. 
Integrate and Synchronize Training. A good advisor team will integrate and 
synchronize individual, staff, unit, and leader training into FSF operational 
requirements. A great advisor team also teaches the FSF how to integrate and 
synchronize training opportunities into their schedule. The following tips for 
success can be useful in adding perspective when developing a training plan with 
the FSF. 
(a) Be the Expert. Advisors should ensure the team understands and can
execute to the standard, which the advisor is expecting the FSF to perform.
The FSF will model the advisor’s actions.
(b) Understand foreign disclosure requirements. Much of what can be taught
or given to the FSF is limited by foreign disclosure laws. For example,
teaching mortar employment may be authorized; however, giving them the
lesson plans and protractors may be restricted due to foreign disclosure laws.
Advisors must remember that the technology present in training equipment
and any disclosure of the capabilities of US equipment must comply with
foreign disclosure laws.
(c) Incorporate their experience level into the training plan. The FSF may
have differing TTP they have found effective. The advisor should be open-
minded enough to consider their TTP for the desired training effect.
(d) Maintain emotional control. An even temperament, with a robust sense of
humor, is more effective than losing one’s temper. Normal US reasons for
anger and impatience seldom translate to other cultures.
(e) Be cognizant of insider threats. Advisors are coaching and training the
enemy if the FSF have been infiltrated by enemy forces.
(f) Become immersed in their environment. Advisors should live, eat, train,
and fight with FSF. They should learn some of their language. The confidence
108 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
built by doing this is greater than having the occasional cup of tea with them. 
FSF will listen to those they respect. 
(g) Learn their doctrine. Advisors are there to reinforce FSF systems and
doctrine, not to replicate one’s own. Advisors should learn FSF doctrine and
operate and train within it. They should understand that the FSF counterpart
may use centralized command, for example.
(h) Learn their weapons, weapon systems, and equipment. Advisors must be
able to coach FSF on effective employment of their weapons, weapon
systems, and equipment.
(i) Train their trainers. Advisors should teach and coach through FSF
leadership. This establishes legitimacy for the FSF’s right to lead and
effectively enables the secondary objective of training more FSF over time.
(j) Be present. The advisor team must have a presence at training events
and during operations. The FSF become proficient at tasks the advisor team
reinforces.
(k) Do not become their supply system. The advisor team must train them to
use their system or coach them to develop one.
4. Advising in Combat
Command Relationships (Advisors are not Commanders). 
Advisors contribute to developing and improving FSF capabilities by 
providing advice and guidance within US command policy. The US or coalition 
chain of command should be used to obtain and disseminate guidance and 
assistance. The advisor is responsible for ensuring the intent of the US or 
coalition chain of command is received and understood by the FSF.  
Advisors should recognize differences in leadership styles employed by their 
FSF counterparts, which may differ from the standards expected of US and 
coalition units, yet be effective for their force. Recognition of the differences will 
help advisors avoid being perceived as leading the FSF. 
The advisor provides recommendations to the FSF, not orders. Only the 
counterpart should issue orders. The FSF counterpart is the advisor’s peer, not 
the boss; neither is the advisor the counterpart’s boss. Much of the success of an 
advisor is based on the personal and professional relationship the advisor has 
with the FSF counterpart. Advisor duty is leadership by example. The FSF 
counterpart watches what the advisor does more than listens to what is said.  
FSF Planning Process and Considerations. An advisor must understand what 
planning process is used by the FSF.  
Intelligence. 
There may be coalition organizations in the AO that can assist with 
intelligence requirements, but the advisor may still lack intelligence about the AO, 
FSF, and the civilian personalities who dwell in the AO. What may be missing is 
an adequate intelligence fusion cell to consolidate the intelligence picture. See 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
109 
appendix K for examples of engagement worksheets for possible use by 
advisors. 
The advisor should collaborate and share information among units in the AO. 
There is too much information at stake not to take advantage of the capability. If 
creative, then the results gained will be surprising. 
The advisor should be familiar with area studies, area assessments, and 
AARs. The Joint After-Action Reporting System database and the Joint Lessons 
Learned Information System are useful tools for reviewing AARs. Pertinent 
documents should be compared to detect trends or changes. These systems 
also provide examples of how documents may be completed. If a relationship is 
built over the years, the advisor could evaluate the following, if requested by the 
FSF. 
(a) FSF intelligence staff section (G-2 or S-2), and its SOPs and
effectiveness.
(b) FSF unit chain of command and communication channels.
(c) Intelligence projects initiated or proposed by predecessors.
(d) Advisor communication channels.
(e) Other available intelligence reference material from other intelligence
agencies.
Advisors may be called upon to provide guidance and assistance in 
operations security activities. When acting in such roles, advisors should attempt 
to answer the following questions: 
(a) Is intelligence disseminated on a need-to-know basis?
(b) Are security precautions observed?
(c) Is access to sensitive areas positively controlled?
(d) Are cryptographic systems available and used in transmitting classified
information?
(e) Do personnel follow proper communications procedures?
(f) Are personnel with access to classified information properly cleared? How
thorough or effective is the investigation process?
(g) Are security inspections of installations conducted at regular and irregular
intervals?
(h) Is periodic security training conducted?
(i) What means of communication are employed and do they jeopardize the
security of informants?
The advisor should never assume technology will be the sole savior of the 
advisor team in combat. Routinely, the enemy is proving to be adept at 
overcoming technological advancements and changing TTP. The best way to 
110 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
survive as a team, and train the FSF to survive, is through intelligence 
preparation of the operational environment (IPOE). It is better to avoid or mitigate 
kill zones with combat power than trust improvised explosive device defeat 
mechanisms on assigned vehicles to do the work. Outthinking the enemy is the 
best way to defeat them. The following are crucial questions to ask regarding the 
enemy.  
(a) Who is the team fighting?
Terrorists, insurgents, or a militia?
Identify their zones (i.e., attack, support, kill, reconnaissance, sanctuary).
Identify their existing trends.
(b) What can the enemy do to the advisor team?
Use improvised explosive devices, complex ambushes, reconnaissance,
demonstrations.
How will the enemy use the locals?
What times of day or night will they be active, and where?
(c) What can friendly forces do to the enemy?
How can the advisor team and FSF mitigate enemy actions?
What joint effects are available to the FSF?
What coalition forces can assist, and how?
What deception can the advisor use; where and how?
(d) How will the enemy react to the advisor’s plan?
Throughout the mission, what are anticipated enemy reactions to the
FSF and advisor team?
How does the advisor counter them?
Once the advisor team understands and applies the basics of IPOE, the FSF 
should be trained to do the same. Many FSF may lack a basic understanding of 
how to analyze their OE despite being in the same culture and sharing a 
common language. Also, the FSF may not live in the same operating area. Often, 
their deference for rumors drives conclusions regarding enemy activity. The 
advisor team should be aware of rumors because they may create unproductive 
combat operations. The advisor should train FSF to analyze their area correctly 
and focus their understanding on intelligence and combat information. 
Note: Observations in (7) and (8) are only conducted under an intelligence cooperation 
agreement. 
Advisors should establish relationships with the various “special units” within 
the operational environment. Most will not contact the advisor or offer assistance 
without a request. These organizations may include cross-functional teams of the 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
111 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, other US law-enforcement personnel, and many 
US intelligence agencies. Many of these special coalition intelligence or law 
enforcement task forces will share information with the advisor team if asked for 
assistance. Reciprocal information sharing helps keep their interest in helping the 
advisor team. 
(a) The advisor should train the FSF concerning enemy infiltration, weapons
smuggling, or other criminal activities.
(b) Information from the FSF is valuable and can be used by the advisor
team to assist in building packets and case files supporting US and FSF
objectives. In exchange for the information, FSF could receive reciprocal
information regarding targets, intelligence, and human factors. For example,
these may include sectarian infiltration routes and ethnic cleansing areas of
focus. These types of information help the advisor understand enemy
locations and kill zones, and determine how the enemy is trying to target the
advisor, advisor team, and FSF.
When directed, advisors plan and conduct intelligence training. The advisor 
should assist their FSF counterpart in developing a local intelligence collection 
program, training intelligence personnel in their specialties, and effectively using 
trained intelligence personnel. Advisors may accomplish these aims by: 
(a) Assisting in establishing an operations center to coordinate intelligence
efforts.
(b) Maintaining liaison with police and intelligence agencies responsible for
countersubversion.
(c) Providing intelligence support and force protection information to US
personnel working at other levels.
(d) Establishing secure and reliable communications channels.
(e) Preparing daily reports on intelligence-related activities.
(f) Assisting in developing effective procedures for collecting and
disseminating intelligence.
(g) Assisting in establishing an adequate security program to safe-guard
against subversion, espionage, and sabotage.
(h) Assisting in developing and achieving intelligence training quotas for
selected, qualified personnel.
General Observations. 
Advisors should prepare and maintain a list of essential elements of 
information, priority intelligence requirements, friendly force intelligence 
requirements, and opposition indicators, if appropriate. Advisors should 
determine if: 
(a) Trained subversive opposition leaders have been discovered.
(b) Evidence exists of an underground opposition organization.
112 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
(c) Efforts exist to create or increase civil disturbance and dissension.
(d) An opposition psychological campaign is ongoing against existing or
proposed government policies and programs.
(e) Attempts are being made to provoke the government into harsh measures
(such as curfews).
(f) Assassinations and kidnappings of local political leaders, doctors, or
schoolteachers are taking place.
(g) Adversarial actions are occurring.
(h) An appreciable decline exists in school attendance.
Human Rights and Misconduct. The advisor must stress the consequences
of mistreating suspects, detainees, or prisoners taken into custody. These 
persons must be treated in accordance with Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. 
This means advisors or FSF provide care for the sick and wounded as well as 
protect prisoners and detainees from all types of abuse or harm. Murder, 
mutilation, and torture are forbidden as is humiliation or degrading treatment. 
Sentences and executions may not be carried out unless judgment has been 
pronounced by a regularly constituted court. US Service members must never be 
active participants in conducting any such punishment and must strongly 
discourage any such activity. They must explain to their counterparts they are 
obliged to report any atrocities, of which they have knowledge, under the Leahy 
Laws, which could result in termination of US assistance. 
The advisor’s task is not to teach FSF the JPP and IPOE or institute battalion 
systems to operate effectively in garrison. It is to advise and train them on how to 
be effective in combat. The advisor team’s combat missions must be deliberately 
planned and executed in a multinational, sometimes joint, fashion with the FSF. 
The advisor should understand and respect the difficulty of the mission. The 
benefits received through aggressive prosecution of duties will directly reflect in 
the FSF units being advised. The better this is done, the faster the advisor and 
team will achieve success. 
5. Introduction to FSF Logistics
Although advising the FSF logistical counterpart may be the primary mission, 
taking care of the team’s logistical needs can seem like a full-time job. Advisor 
teams can teach, coach, and advise their counterparts in all aspects of logistics. This 
includes accounting for property; maintaining property books; requesting, storing, 
and distributing all classes of supplies; and performing unit-level maintenance or 
establishing a maintenance program if one is not already in place. In addition, 
advisors may have to request contracts to improve their FSF AO through PN 
construction companies. The advisor’s mission may require assisting the SC officer 
by teaching FSF how to use equipment obtained through the foreign military sales 
program, although this training is usually provided or sold as part of the foreign 
military sales program or Section 1206/2282 Train and Equip program. Additionally, 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
113 
advisors keep their higher logistics advisors informed of any logistical function the 
FSF counterpart is performing through their logistical system. 
Understanding FSF Logistics. The FSF counterpart is likely to have shortfalls 
in logistics capabilities and may ask advisors to fulfill shortages. It is critical that 
advisors develop good working relationships with their FSF counterparts, but 
realize, if they are unsure about a logistics issue, say “no” and develop a 
successful outcome later. It is difficult for advisors to recover from a loss of 
credibility caused by the inability to fulfill promises to their counterparts. 
Typical Problems. FSF lack the logistical capability required to sustain their 
equipment. This problem is complex and can include the following. 
(a) They may have underfunded logistical systems or are subject to
corruption from the point of issue to point of delivery.
(b) They may lack adequate infrastructure systems and processes that could
hamper logistical planning.
(c) Many officers and NCOs do not have plans developed that address future
sustainment demands. The lack of understanding or emphasis on logistics
leads to a lack of inventory, poor planning, and an unworkable system of
resupply.
Logistical Advising. The logistics officer serves as the primary logistical 
advisor to the FSF logistics officer by coaching, teaching, and advising the FSF 
counterpart regarding the classes of supply. Additionally, the advisor may be 
expected to request contracts for the FSF. 
(a) Property Accountability and Property Book. It is important, during the RIP
or TOA process with the outgoing team, advisors ask the outgoing advisor if
there is an equipment inventory of what has been issued to the FSF up to the
RIP or TOA date. The list will serve as the base document for tracking how
much equipment, by major end item, has been issued to the FSF unit via the
PN government. During the advisors’ tour, they will add major end items
issued to keep track of the percentage of fill per item. This will help advisors
provide accurate information to higher headquarters regarding the amount of
major end items issued to the FSF unit. See table 14 for an example of
accounting for property.

(b) Tracking FSF Equipment. Tracking how much property the FSF unit has
issued to their subordinate units by major end item is as important as property
accountability. Build a good working relationship with the FSF counterpart to
determine the FSF commander’s written authorization for major end item
distribution. The FSF counterpart may already have a working property book
the advisor can use to compare numbers to ensure a somewhat accurate
document. The advisor will most likely have to work through interpreters to
translate both documents, if the counterpart is unable to read or speak
English. See table 15 for an example of a property book.

Request, Store, and Distribute all Classes of Supply. 
Advisors should understand the SOP or methods used in requesting supplies 
within their FSF’s logistical system. Advisors can ask FSF logistical personnel 
what forms they use, their forecasting requirements, and where to send requests. 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
115 
In addition, the advisor will need to ask the advisor team’s logistics chain of 
command what the procedures are for requesting oversight and tracking. 
Once supplies have arrived at the FSF base, the FSF counterpart is advised 
on inventory and storing controls to ensure the safety and security of the 
supplies. 
After supplies have been inventoried and secured, the advisor and FSF 
counterpart will assess all subordinate units for supply shortfalls. Ideally, the 
advisor wants the counterpart to decide that the best way to distribute the 
supplies is by filling the units with the most shortages. However, the advisor may 
have to help the counterpart identify the best way to distribute the supplies. The 
FSF logistical officer does not have the final say in the distribution. The logistical 
officer will take the suggestion to the unit commander for the final distribution 
decision. The advisor should be aware that unit commanders may use property 
and supplies as a form of superiority. The commander who wishes to reward a 
subordinate commander might give that commander more property or supplies 
than others. In addition, a unit commander may show power by waiting for 
subordinate commanders to ask for supplies or property. 
Unit-level Maintenance for the FSF. 
The advisor’s FSF counterparts may emphasize performing preventive 
maintenance and preventive maintenance checks and services (PMCS) on their 
equipment. One reason for this is that they may not have spare parts or 
lubricants within their system. The FSF counterparts should be asked, through 
the advisor logistics channels, if there is a maintenance contract or are repair 
parts or lubricants available for FSF use. 
The advisor may be amazed at the level of maintenance the FSF 
counterparts are able to perform. Out of necessity, FSF units with inadequate 
supply systems are often very skillful at cannibalization. They do whatever it 
takes to keep their vehicles mission capable. However, they may not understand 
the importance of performing PMCS to avert problems.  
There are few PMCS manuals in foreign languages for the FSF counterparts 
to use to perform the correct preventive maintenance. In addition, the advisor’s 
counterpart may have many different vehicles in the motor pool with no owner’s 
manuals, organic, trained mechanics, or spare parts.  
Contracting. 
In case the advisor needs to build, purchase, or service something beyond 
the limits or authorities of the advisor team, a request for proposal or a request 
for a quotation should be submitted to the higher headquarters that provide 
contracting support to the team. For example, if armor is needed on the FSF 
vehicles to increase survivability, a contract is required to purchase the armor 
and install it. Another example may be to purchase air conditioner units and 
installation services for the advisor’s FSF offices or a detainee area. A contract 
must be awarded to purchase and install these units.

The logistics advisor starts the contracting process, but the final approving 
authority may reside at the general officer level. All contracts must be fully vetted 
to ensure they remain within the funding authority by which the contracts will be 
executed. To complete the contracting process, The advisor should reach back 
to the home station or a supporting contracting office in country to guide the 
team.

Chapter VII 
ASSESSMENTS 
1. General
SC activities conducted with FSF and their supporting institutions range from the 
visible—training, equipping, and exercising together—to those less obvious, such as 
holding bilateral talks, workshops, and conferences and providing education. It is 
often challenging to determine if these and other activities such as advising have 
contributed to the achievement of US objectives and, if so, by how much or in what 
ways.  
As discussed in Chapter II, the operation assessment process is used by 
CCMDs, SCCs, joint task forces, and TSOCs to inform SC activity decision-making 
at the appropriate levels. The operation assessment process starts with the planning 
initiation step and continues through each step of the JPP. The operation 
assessment process activities of monitor, evaluate, recommend, and direct inform 
and are informed by decision-making that occurs at the strategic, operational, and 
tactical levels.  
Note: The JPP is a recognized and proven problem-solving approach, which advances 
decision-making at all levels. Advisors can use the process at any time for any issue, 
and results from each step can inform other steps. 
Advisors can use the JPP and participate in the operation assessment process to 
inform their decision-making related to advising their FSF counterpart as well as 
informing other stakeholders (e.g., CCDR, chief of mission, etc.) in the OE. Doing so 
helps to achieve unity of effort as well as creates a common operational picture for 
making estimates of developmental progress in FSF and their supporting institutions. 
The operation assessment process strengthens and reinforces DOD AM&E 
policy and guidelines. From both the perspective of joint planning and AM&E 
guidelines, assessment involves analyzing the context, conditions, capabilities, and 
requirements of a PN to inform follow-on or in-progress SC activities and the 
programs that enable those activities. 
Note: For more information on assessments, see JP 5-0, JP 3-20, and DODI 5132.14, 
Assessment, Monitoring, and Evaluation Policy for the Security Cooperation Enterprise.

15 June 2023 
When considering their role, advisors should recognize that different 
headquarters will likely have different areas of focus for the assessment of SC 
activities. While all advisors are sensors for both MOPs and MOEs, these examples 
shed light on some general tendencies at tactical and operational levels: 
Tactical-level. The assessment at the tactical-level focuses more on task 
accomplishment and performance management, and whether assigned or 
implied tasks are performed to standard using MOPs. MOPs answer the 
questions “was the task completed?” and “was it completed to standard?” (e.g., 
delivery of equipment, construction of contingency bases, construction of a 
school, or seizure of an objective to specified standards) to assist the unit in 
improving future performance. These assessments include any SFA 
developmental activity (e.g., OTEBA) that occurs within the G-EGO functions of 
FSF and any action taken by an FSF counterpart within these functions. Advisor 
assessments inform and are informed by assessments at the operational level. 
Operational-level. CCMDs, SCCs, joint task forces, and TSOCs focus on 
whether SC activities are creating the necessary effects and achieving objectives 
using MOEs. MOEs orient on whether they are making progress towards mission 
accomplishment (e.g., gaining support within a population or effecting a decrease 
in enemy activity), which answers whether they are “doing the right things.” 
Similarly, advisors aligned to principals within FSF can expect to advise their 
counterparts on identifying and using MOEs as well as harmonizing (coordination 
and synchronization) of these MOEs with a CCMD or SCC.  
The advisor plays a direct role in using the operation assessment process to 
support all aspects of DOD AM&E policy and guidelines. The remainder of this 
chapter will depict the principles within an operation assessment and how these 
fundamentals inform decision-making at the appropriate levels. With input from an 
advisor, CCDRs use their operation assessment process to inform the Secretary of 
Defense prioritization and resourcing decisions such as US investments in advisor 
missions and whether the activity is yielding the intended return. 
In the context of security cooperation: 
Operation assessment process. 
1. A continuous process that measures the overall effectiveness
of employing capabilities during military operations to achieve stated 
objectives. 
2. Determination of the progress toward accomplishing a task,
creating a condition, or achieving an objective. (JP 5-0) 
In accordance with AM&E policy and guidelines, assessment is the 
systematic analysis to provide an understanding of the context, 
conditions, partner capabilities, and requirements to inform security 
cooperation planning and implementation. (DODI 5132.14).

2. Assessment
Assessments inform decision-making at the appropriate levels by helping to 
establish information about the conditions within a PN that are relevant to planning a 
successful advising engagement. Assessments serve at least two critical functions 
by informing the design (e.g., a CCDR’s plan) of advising activities and providing 
baseline information to enable accurate measurement of progress of SC activities 
and programs that enable them. Initial assessments should precede all advising 
activities in order to measure the progress of three fundamental and interrelated 
considerations:  
The level of progress towards building a security relationship. 
FSF capability and capacity. 
US access within the PN, including anticipated freedom of action that results 
from the relationship between the United States and PN. 
Advisors must develop an understanding of FSF capability, capacity, and 
conditions that affect development to effectively conduct operations and meet US 
and PN objectives. Assessments identify gaps in FSF capabilities so solutions can 
be developed. Considerations include an overarching assessment of FSF 
requirements, existing capabilities, capacity, and constraints, as well as 
environmental considerations across the PMESII spectrum. Also included are the 
desires of the PN and US defense objectives. Each situation differs depending upon 
the level of conflict in the PN, the existing capability and capacity of the FSF, and the 
desires of the PN. 
The assessment must start with an understanding of the OE, allowing follow-on 
planning efforts to support strategy development, encourage unity of effort, focus 
resources, and anticipate partner needs. The desired end states account for US 
strategic goals, priorities of the FSF or the PN government, and regional factors and 
concerns.  
In total, initial and follow-on assessments describe FSF willingness and ability to 
implement and sustain assistance; improve institutional capacity; build capabilities in 
the context of country or other relevant objectives; and identify requirements, gaps, 
and potential risks. The following section discusses the FSF assessment.  
Note: Determining how well FSF perform a specific task or achieve an objective 
depends on the conditions with which they must deal. For example, if an infantry 
battalion is succeeding in defeating the enemy when coming into direct contact, it does 
not need to improve marksmanship to make all battalion personnel a sniper. If the 
enemy changes tactics and begins engaging at longer ranges, the unit may then have 
to improve its marksmanship capabilities. 
3. FSF Assessment
As discussed earlier, advisors play a crucial role in supporting the operation 
assessment process activities of monitor, evaluate, recommend, and direct. When 
assessing FSF and their supporting institutions, CCMDs, SCCs, joint task forces, 
120 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
and TSOCs use the FSF Assessment Model (Logical Order of Assessment). See 
figure 16.  
Figure 16. FSF Assessment Model (Logical Order of Assessment) 
The FSF Assessment Model consists of four interdependent assessments—
organizational, operational, environmental, and institutional—conducted in the order 
listed. Advisors can expect to support these assessments as well as use them to 
inform their planning as it relates to their specific counterparts. 
The FSF assessment is continuous, collaborative, and simultaneous in nature. It 
may appear these assessments are separate and distinct but they are not—they are 
interdependent and reinforcing to inform decision-making at the appropriate levels. 
Organizational Assessment. This assessment should evaluate to what extent 
(scale, scope, duration parameters) an FSF core process/entity is organized, 
manned, trained, equipped, led, and resourced based on its assigned 
role/mission. To determine the organizational structure of the FSF, advisors will 
need to understand what the organization is designed to do. The organizational 
assessment should answer these questions: What are the FSF’s roles? What is 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
121 
the FSF mission (FSF mission analysis)? What are the FSF’s developmental 
goals and objectives?  
Operational Assessment. This assessment reveals strengths and 
weaknesses in an FSF core process/organization as it attempts to fulfill its 
directed role or purpose. This assessment follows a common operations process 
to determine how well the FSF can plan, execute, and assess their assigned 
missions or roles. This assessment requires that a core process(es)/organization 
demonstrate in an actual operation, exercise, or simulated environment, the 
FSF’s ability to plan, execute, and assess activities that accomplish directed 
missions or objectives.  
(a) A clear understanding of the FSF operational or institutional mission
serves as the starting point to base the operational assessment. The
operational assessment reveals strengths and gaps in the FSF’s ability to
perform their missions, roles, or functions, and it measures how well the FSF
can conduct their missions. It is not only a snapshot of FSF warfighting
capabilities, but also of the FSF operating concept and how those functions
work to support each other.
(b) Assessments of FSF operational standards, capabilities, and gaps must
include root cause analysis. For example, a unit that did not properly conduct
a cordon and search may have failed because it lost communication with part
of the cordon force, or it may have gone to the wrong location. The lack of
communication could be because of old and worn-out equipment, poor
equipment maintenance, insufficient training, poor leadership, lack of an SOP,
or a number of other causes. The wrong location could be caused by
incomplete intelligence, poor navigation skills, or navigational equipment
failure. In both cases, operational assessments need to identify and address
the root cause of why the unit did not perform to standard.
(c) Operational assessments also identify FSF strengths to build on and help
focus resources during future operations and engagements. In total,
operational assessments are a critical piece of the advisor team handover
process as discussed in appendix C.
(d) When evaluating the FSF assess component of the FSF operational
assessment, advisors can use the operational assessment activities of
monitor, evaluate, recommend, and direct to gauge the extent to which their
counterparts use assessments to inform their planning and execution.
Environmental Assessment. This assessment considers current conditions in 
the environment and their effects on a specific FSF organization. The 
environmental assessment should validate the suitability of an FSF 
organization’s directed missions. This also may reveal the requirement to 
develop additional capabilities or capacities in the FSF beyond those normally 
associated with a similar type of security force. The environmental assessment 
answers the following question, What are the effects of PMESII on the FSF? 
Advisors working with higher headquarters staff and other SME (e.g., civil affairs) 
122 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
analyze each PMESII variable using areas, structures, capabilities, 
organizations, people, and events to determine the following: 
To what extent a variable(s) impacts FSF capability development or the
ability of the FSF to accomplish its mission?
What are the threats?
Are there any geographical considerations?
(a) The environmental analysis must consider an understanding of current
conditions that affect specific FSF units and their core processes. Operational
variables such as PMESII positively or negatively influence development. For
example, if a commander is perceived to be corrupt, the commander’s unit
may be denied resources, which would hamper unit development.
Conversely, units with a strong political or social connection may receive
priority for new equipment. PMESII is only one of many frameworks that can
be utilized to collect environmental data, so it is important to identify the
environmental drivers or inhibitors of success in achieving mission objectives,
even if they fall outside of a doctrinal template.
(b) Environmental assessments are critical in understanding the operational
environment, beginning in the planning process, as noted in chapter 2.
Note. Advisors will need to work with their higher headquarters staff and other SMEs to 
conduct the environmental assessment.  
Institutional Assessment. This assessment seeks to evaluate institutional 
capability and capacity and determine how the FSF resolves gaps in one or more 
G-EGO functions. This assessment examines the outputs of each FSF G-EGO
function and provides consideration for potential implications to US-provided
OTEBA and funding activities. The institutional assessment evaluates FSF
capabilities by examining the G-EGO framework holistically. An FSF capability is
enabled by one or more legal, policy, or DOTMLPF solutions. To close existing
capability gaps found in the institutional assessment, advisors aligned to the
Service headquarters (air, land, maritime, cyberspace, space) equivalents of FSF
will lean on DOTMLPF core process recommendations. Whereas advisors
aligned to a ministry will lean on policy process recommendations that may
impact specific DOTMLPF processes or operational matters (e.g., C2,
intelligence, fires, sustainment, etc.). Within DOD, this is collectively viewed as a
DOTMLPF approach, which advisors can logically apply within and across FSF.
However, core processes within the governance function of FSF, which establish
legal authorities and national policy, routinely impact DOTMLPF and operational
matters within FSF and its supporting institutions. Advisors aligned to principals
and process owners within the executive function of FSF will often collaborate
with US interagency advisors to inform the development of a PN’s parliament or
national security-like council. The institutional assessment will typically be
formally conducted and maintained at the CCMD, SCC, or TSOC level, but
advisors will likely be asked to monitor (observe and analyze) information and
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
123 
make recommendations pertinent to the FSF as an institution using the elements 
of each G-EGO function.  
4. Operation Assessment Process Activities
Monitor 
Monitoring not only focuses on joint forces carrying out SC activities, CCDRs 
expect advisors, in concert with their counterparts, to monitor the activities of the 
FSF to inform decision-making at the appropriate levels.  
Monitoring speaks to the long stare (over multiple advisor rotations) at how 
partner forces and mission accomplishment are evolving. It enables planners and 
advisors to understand changes in the operational environment based on 
advising activities, and it further informs a commander’s intent, guidance for 
planning, prioritization, and execution. The FSF Assessment Model describe 
earlier provides a tool for advisors to monitor the activities of the FSF. Monitoring 
focuses on tasks carried out by FSF, normally using MOPs and MOEs, which 
informs and is informed by assessments at the strategic, operational, and tactical 
levels within the joint force and the FSF.  
Note: The extent (scale, scope, and duration parameters) to which a core process 
effectively performs (MOP) its stated role and the expected results (MOE) it is able to 
achieve is a measure of its overall capability. CCDRs and PN senior leaders may set 
parameters (targets) at higher levels, which may impact the capacity of the core process 
to perform at a certain level (MOP) or its ability to achieve higher results (MOE). 
Task monitoring focuses on “are we/they doing things right,” while evaluation 
focuses on “are we/they efficiently and effectively doing the right things” to create 
the effects to achieve objectives. Task monitoring includes tracking whether 
tasks are completed as planned, whether tasks are completed according to the 
planned timeline, whether costs are as projected, and other indicators used to 
For clarity: 
A. Factors that affect capability and capacity include, but are not
limited to, the extent to which FSF or their supporting
institutions are organized, employed, manned, equipped,
trained, led, and resourced.
B. In some instances, FSF may have military department
equivalents that carryout similar core processes of the
executive function that establish policy for DOTMLPF and
administrative processes for its service headquarters as well
as respective operational formations (air, land, maritime,
cyberspace, and space).
C. As part of the institutional assessment, advisors will need to
make estimates of other US developmental activities (OTEBA)
that are occurring within FSF whether these activities are
supplanting FSF MOP or MOE.
124 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
determine whether planned activities are being executed successfully; it informs 
leaders and decision-makers at all levels. 
Generally, indicators that suggest the MOE of an advisor equates to how well 
the counterpart performs a task (MOP) as well as the results the counterpart 
achieves (MOE). 
Evaluate 
Evaluation is primarily a commander’s business but may be conducted at any 
level and involves systematic collection and analysis of information and evidence 
about the characteristics and outcomes of an ongoing or completed SC activity 
such as advising, its design, implementation, and results.  
Evaluations determine an advisor mission’s relevance, efficiency, 
sustainability, and impact with respect to mission accomplishment as a basis for 
improving effectiveness and to inform decision-makers regarding future plans, 
programs, and activities. Evaluation, distinct from initial or follow-on assessment 
and monitoring, focuses on documenting the achievement of objectives, the 
attainment of end states, and in some cases the value of continuing advising 
activities. Evaluations at the strategic level depend on operation evaluations, 
which are critical in explaining why certain efforts succeed or fail. 
Monitoring. Observing and analyzing indicators of performance or 
effectiveness, as well as the conditions in the operational 
environment that affect those indicators. 
*DOD AM&E guidelines distinguish between monitoring SC outputs
(typically via MOPs focused on the US Government's activities) and
monitoring SC outcomes (via MOE and/or MOP of FSF). Examples
include:
A. Output monitoring. Monitoring specific advisor deliverables,
such as advisor-provided verbal, written, or demonstrative
methods of delivering advice (MOP), to document progress
(e.g., the number of times, when, and for what purpose the
advisor used a common planning process with a counterpart
to inform shared decision-making). This includes the quantity,
quality, and timeliness.
B. Outcome monitoring. Monitoring the results (MOE) of advisor
actions to gauge success (e.g., did the counterpart apply the
steps of the planning process correctly—MOP? Did the
counterpart use the results of the common planning process to
direct (via a plan) the actions of subordinates and assess
these actions to adjust FSF planning and decision-making—
MOE?).
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
125 
Evaluations are typically administered by teams from a CCMD, SCC, or 
TSOC headquarters, but advisors play a role in providing objective assessments 
and collecting focused data/feedback on behalf of the evaluation team. At the 
tactical and operational level, advisors normally contribute to the evaluation 
process through assessments. Continual assessments depict changes in the 
operational environment and track progress, effects, and end state or objective 
achievement status, making them a primary tool for evaluation teams. All key 
participants in a particular activity or operation should be committed to seeing the 
mission objectively and involved in the development of the operation assessment 
process or monitoring plan, collection of relevant data, and reporting. 
Recommend 
Results from evaluation enable commanders and advisors to integrate 
relevant information to inform decision-making at the appropriate levels, which 
includes advisors making recommendations to their counterparts. 
Advisor recommendations are important for informing decision-making at the 
strategic, operational, and tactical levels, but may also be appropriate for 
informing interorganizational stakeholders, such as DOS or specific counterparts 
within FSF. For example, based upon monitoring and the evaluation of an FSF 
training exercise, advisors may recommend to their counterparts ways to resolve 
or mitigate training shortfalls or inform other advisors as to potential institutional 
issues that impact the FSF organization. 
Direct 
At the operational level, this assessment activity is inherent to a CCDR’s 
authority to organize and employ joint forces as deemed necessary to 
accomplish assigned tasks and missions.  
Based on monitoring and evaluation results, advisors aligned to FSF 
commanders may advise an FSF commander how to direct certain actions or 
modify plans.   
Note: To inform SC planning and execution across the DOD, commanders capture and 
integrate their observations and recommendations into systems of record such as the 
Joint Lessons Learned Information System. These systems provide a mechanism to 
record and make available information to strengthen analysis and learning across DOD’s 
SC enterprise. 
5. Assessment Conclusion
This chapter provided a brief overview of the operation assessment process 
activities of monitor, evaluate, recommend, and direct. This chapter highlighted how 
the advisor has a direct role in assessment. It introduced the FSF Assessment 
Model with four interdependent assessments—organizational, operational, 
environmental, and institutional. Advisors use these assessments to develop an 
understanding of FSF capability and capacity as well as apply the model when 
making estimates of progress using indicators that suggest MOP and MOE.

ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
Furthermore, the chapter discussed how monitoring activities span several 
advisor rotations in order to observe how partner forces and mission 
accomplishment are evolving. Specifically, it presented ways to think about input and 
output monitoring as it relates to advisors and their counterparts. The chapter 
explored how evaluations determine an advisor mission’s relevance, efficiency, 
sustainability, and impact with respect to mission accomplishment. 
Ultimately, the operation assessment process begins immediately upon the 
receipt of mission (e.g., planning initiation of the JPP) and occurs continuously 
throughout the mission. Supporting the operation assessment process are the 
follow-through and coordinating actions to the mission. The chapter emphasizes that 
advisors must iteratively update their assessments, because thoughtful, honest, and 
accurate advisor estimates are critical. Advisor estimates (judgement) make the 
difference between building on the hard work that advisors have done and 
stagnating progress towards accomplishing mutual US and PN objectives

ADVISOR TEAM CHECKLIST 
1. Recommended Advisor Tasks
The recommended tasks required to accomplish advisor missions are deploy the team, 
provide command and control (C2), advise foreign security forces (FSF), and protect, 
sustain, and redeploy the team. Table 16 is an example of an advisor task list. 
Example Advisor Task Checklist 
Task 1—Deploy the Team 
1.1-Build an effective team. 
1.1.1—Select team members based on subject matter expert (SME) skills, advisor

Table 16. Example Advisor Task Checklist (Cont’d) 
2.2—Coordinate and deconflict with higher, supporting, and adjacent units 
(coalition and FSF). 
2.2.1—Identify higher, supporting, and adjacent units. 
2.2.2—Establish rapport and communication with higher, supporting, and adjacent 
units. 
2.2.3—Advise and influence higher, supporting, and adjacent units on the advisor 
mission and requirements. 
2.2.4—Execute reporting procedures and requirements. 
2.2.5—Conduct an assessment across the FSF capabilities and identify capacity 
gaps or institutional shortfalls for future resources and higher unit regional 
understanding. 
2.3—Identify and establish rapport with key personnel in the area of operations 
(AO). 
2.3.1—Identify key FSF personnel. 
2.3.2—Establish rapport with key FSF personnel. 
2.3.3—Identify key local civilian, religious, and governance leaders. 
2.3.4—Establish rapport with key local civilian, religious, and governance leaders. 
Task 3—Advise FSF 
3.1—Effectively communicate in an advising environment. The ability for an 
advisor to communicate with a counterpart is critical to the success of the advisor 
mission. Interpreters are often relied upon to bridge the communication gap, but they 
are not always available or dependable for providing an accurate representation of a 
translated conversation based on language skill or experience working with the 
military. Thus, language training for the advisor team is an important aspect of the 
train-up to facilitate mission success.

Table 16. Example Advisor Task Checklist (Cont’d) 
3.1.1—Effectively communicate without an interpreter. 
3.1.1.1—Exchange common greetings in the language used in the AO. 
3.1.1.2—Identify and employ nonverbal communications common in the AO. 
3.1.1.3—Understand verbal and nonverbal threat indicators common in the AO. 
3.1.2—Effectively communicate through an interpreter. 
3.1.2.1—Understand the language and security capabilities of the interpreter. 
3.1.2.2—Evaluate the trustworthiness of the interpreter. 
3.1.2.3—Understand the background, cultural, and gender biases of the 
interpreter. 
3.1.2.4—Plan and prepare an interpreter for a communications event. 
3.1.2.5—Conduct a meeting or event through the interpreter. 
3.1.2.6—Prepare to work with a nonvetted or unfamiliar interpreter. 
3.1.2.7—Understand the regional perceptions of the interpreter based on 
background, culture, or gender biases to manage employment of the interpreter. 
3.1.2.8—Plan a negotiation with the interpreter and mediate a conflict with FSF or 
key local civilian, religious, and governance leaders. 
3.2—Gain and use influence to progress advisor mission objectives. An advisor 
must be able to influence the counterpart to act in ways that may be different from 
past experience and cultural norms. Without the ability to influence the counterpart’s 
actions, the advisor mission may fail. Affinity between the advisor and counterpart 
must exist for true influence to occur. A successful advisor will put an influence 
strategy in motion resulting in a voluntary, long-lasting change in the counterpart’s 
actions despite the absence of formal authority. Successful influence is gained 
through a combination of rapport building techniques used to demonstrate value, 
credibility, and trust. This can only be achieved when each individual perceives the 
other as competent, mature, responsible, and compatible (working toward a common 
goal). If the advisor can convey a committed attitude to the FSF counterpart, a long-
lasting, effective advisor relationship will exist. 
3.2.1—Demonstrate the professional ability of one’s own military occupation and 
function on the advisor team. 
3.2.2—Demonstrate to the FSF counterpart that the advisor provides value. 
3.2.3.1—Demonstrate SME advisor knowledge. 
3.2.3.2—Demonstrate access to the advisor team and coalition support or 
effects. 
3.2.3—Determine and employ the proper influence techniques.

3.2.4.2—Prepare the FSF counterpart to conduct negotiations with local leaders. 
3.2.4.3—Prepare the FSF counterpart to conduct negotiations with coalition 
forces. 
3.2.5—Effectively advise higher, supporting, and adjacent units or coalition forces. 
3.2.5.1—Build rapport with higher, supporting, and adjacent units or coalition 
forces. 
3.2.5.2—Educate higher, supporting, and adjacent units or coalition forces on the 
capabilities and limitations of the FSF counterpart and unit. 
3.2.5.3—Influence higher, supporting, and adjacent units or coalition forces to 
progress advisor mission objectives. 
3.3—Advise FSF unit mission-essential task list, mission objective, or 
assigned tasks. Advisors must teach, coach, and advise FSF to develop their 
professional skills. Teaching means to provide instruction and education to FSF to 
develop skills and knowledge necessary to do a particular task or mission. Coaching 
means to assist a counterpart in reaching the next level of knowledge or skill by 
practicing those skills and building on previous teaching. The goal is for the FSF to 
assume more responsibility for success while the advisor gives assistance as 
required. Advising means to provide counterparts with counsel to assist them in 
making a decision based on applying knowledge. The distinctive feature is the 
recipient is responsible for making the decision while the advisor only provides 
counsel.

3.3.4.1—Determine FSF leader development needs and education. 
3.3.4.2—Conduct an assessment of the FSF organization to determine 
capabilities, capacity, or institutional gaps. 
3.4—Understand and operate within operational limitations from higher 
headquarters. Every unit, team, or individual working with FSF must receive 
guidance on what operational constraints may exist. The advisor will almost always 
possess more detailed information than the FSF require or need to possess. The 
advisor should always receive a detailed briefing from the appropriate intelligence 
office prior to departing on any advisor mission. Likewise, the advisor may have 
many assets that may be provided to FSF counterparts. The advisor must be aware 
of all the assets and under what conditions they may be provided to the FSF 
counterpart. In addition, the advisor must not only verify the training tasks for the 
FSF, but must also evaluate the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) that apply 
to those tasks. 
3.4.1—Determine when to provide or withhold information from a counterpart. 
3.4.1.1—Understand and ensure all information is cleared for foreign disclosure 
through a foreign disclosure officer (FDO). 
3.4.2—Determine when to provide or withhold assets from a counterpart. 
3.4.2.1—Ensure funds are properly used and approved through an appropriate 
funding source.

3.4.3.1—Understand and ensure all TTP are cleared for foreign disclosure 
through an FDO. 
3.5—Operate with cross-cultural competence. The advisor must be able to 
anticipate the actions of the counterpart, understand those actions within the cultural 
context, and influence those actions to achieve an acceptable outcome. The advisor 
will not always be able to influence outcomes, but must determine an acceptable 
level and influence adherence to that level. The advisor must also inform and 
educate own chain of command on any deviations from advisor and unit acceptable 
norms and convey the cultural context of the counterpart’s actions. 
3.5.1—Understand the local ethical model and employ acceptable solutions within it. 
3.5.1.1—Educate the chain of command on deviances from US-accepted cultural 
behavior. 
Task 4—Protect the Team 
4.1—Plan for a quick response force (QRF). The advisor deploys through the full 
range of operations or environments where adversarial threats can expand from 
nonexistent to a daily, persistent threat to the advisor team and FSF. With the goal of 
developing the FSF for self-sustainability, the advisor must advise the FSF to 
prepare and conduct organic partner nation (PN) QRF support. Based on the 
advisor’s situation, QRF support may be available in country or out of country and be 
comprised of US and coalition forces or PN forces. Additionally, the advisor should 
assist the FSF with developing a QRF plan with organic FSF assets from the PN 
structure, whether it is Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior, police, paramilitary, or 
local security forces.  
4.1.1—Plan QRF for the advisor team based on local and regional threats. 
4.1.2—Advise the FSF leadership on planning for a QRF.

mitigate threats to the team and FSF. A force protection posture should be 
implemented based on the threat to the advisor team and adjusted as new threats 
emerge or the situation improves. The advisor team should have a way to rapidly 
communicate the posture among other team members. The plan should include 
advisor team and FSF team protection. Advise the FSF leadership on proper

ADVISOR PREDEPLOYMENT SITE SURVEY (PDSS) 
This appendix provides an example of considerations for conducting a site survey. Site 
surveys are critical parts of the pre-mission planning and coordination process for 
persistent and episodic deployments.  
1. PDSS Checklist
Preparation. Prior to deploying, the team leader and selected members of the 
advisor team may have an opportunity to visit the area of operations (AO). Ideally, 
the PDSS is scheduled 180–270 days prior to beginning the mission and is an 
extremely useful tool to help the new advisor team understand the operational 
environment. A PDSS checklist can help answer many questions regarding foreign 
security forces (FSF) in the area and shortcomings or opportunities to focus advisor 
efforts for the incoming team. If available, incoming teams should consider 
conducting video teleconferences or gaining access to web portals containing 
current information. 
Every advisor team will have differing missions, AOs, units, and personalities 
with which they will engage. The environment, relationships, FSF level of 
autonomy, and level of stability within the AO help define their mission.  
Prior to departure for the PDSS, the incoming team leader should assemble 
the request for information list based on input from the team. The checklist in 
table 17 provides a basic outline. Team members involved in developing the 
PDSS may use the checklist as a guide when preparing their PDSS plan. 
However, it is important for the incoming advisor team to remain flexible and 
keep an open mind with respect to training and operating with their assigned 
FSF.  
Site Survey Checklist. The site survey checklist helps answer questions identified 
by the team during its preparation for deployment. The checklist can be modified to 
aid the site survey team in acquiring information for planning before deployment. 
2. Site Survey Team Mission
The mission of the site survey team is to report on the current FSF mission, enemy, 
terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil 
considerations conditions. It also clarifies in-country command and control (C2) systems 
and logistics relationships for the follow-on unit’s mission execution and coordinates the 
in-country reception of the main body. If possible, the PDSS should be conducted by 
members of the actual advisor team in conjunction with the partner force.

3. Site Survey Team Procedures
Before departure, the site survey team conducts predeployment activities. Unit 
standard operating procedures should be used when conducting predeployment 
activities; however, the following lists suggested activities: 
Obtaining required travel documents (i.e., visas and passports) through the 
unit’s personnel staff and a copy of the country clearance messages sent by the 
United States (US) embassy, if required, through the unit’s operations staff and 
the country briefing through the appropriate intelligence office.  
Ensuring site survey team members’ medical and immunization records are 
current. 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
139 
Determining financial management support (e.g., the location of supporting 
finance unit funding). 
Confirming all agencies concerned with the site survey have been briefed on 
the team’s itinerary and are available for coordination. 
Receiving and updating the threat briefing and reviewing the rules of 
engagement (ROE) and status-of-forces agreement (SOFA). 
Conducting a mission analysis and backbrief in accordance with unit 
standard operating procedures. The team tailors its mission analysis and 
backbrief to the site survey mission. 
Assess deployment location to identify environmental threats and hazards in 
order to obtain appropriate equipment (mosquito nets, treated uniforms, iodine 
tablets, additional canteens) to mitigate risk to the team. 
Upon arrival in the AO, the team processes through customs, notifies the security 
cooperation (SC) officer of its arrival and status, and requests an updated threat 
briefing. The survey team must be ready to brief the mission and program of 
instruction to the SC officer for approval or modification. 
The survey team commander and operations staff confirm the team’s command 
relationship (COMREL) with the next higher, in-country, US commander. The team 
commander also briefs that commander, if requested, on the planned execution of 
the survey and the required preparations for the main body. 
The survey team commander obtains any additional guidance from the country 
team. At a minimum, the commander meets with the SC officer to confirm the ROE, 
evasion and recovery support, and any limitations on the relationships with FSF 
counterparts. The survey team commander discusses the following topics with the 
SC officer. 
Training objectives. 
Initial terms of reference. (This is captured in a formal document that includes 
the initial, agreed upon training objectives and support requirements for the 
advisor and the FSF.) 
Terms of reference (a final, signed agreement). 
The political situation. 
Social customs. 
Guidelines for official and personal associations with foreign personnel. 
Currency control. 
Procedures for obtaining intelligence support from the next higher operational 
control commander. 
Administrative support. 
Legal status in relation to the foreign country (i.e., SOFA).

Procedures for obtaining logistics from the next higher, in-country, US 
commander. 
If the Leahy Amendment Vetting of Foreign Forces has been completed. 
If country clearance requirements are met. 
If foreign disclosure requirements will be met. 
The team commander confirms communications and reporting procedures 
between the country team or the next higher, in-country, US commander, the survey 
team, and the follow-on advisor units still in mission preparation. The team 
commander, also, must verify the availability of communications equipment needed 
to support the mission. 
The team commander confirms procedures for obtaining logistics based on the 
team’s mission orders and COMREL. Support may be from the next higher, in-
country, US commander depending on COMREL or other logistical sources. The 
team commander identifies a point of contact (POC) at the country team crisis 
management element or at the emergency operations center of the US military staff. 
The POC then informs the team of necessary actions during increased threats or 
emergencies requiring evacuation of US personnel from the AO. The team 
commander also coordinates procedures to obtain intelligence support from the 
country team, the next higher, in-country, US commander, or other US agencies. 
The survey team establishes direct working relationships with its next higher, in-
country headquarters, the country team, or the out-of-country support element. The 
survey team: 
Identifies the supporting element’s location. 
Contacts the supporting element to determine any limitations on support. The 
team should know the expected reaction time between the initiation of the 
support request and its fulfillment. 
Requests support for the in-country reception of the main body in accordance 
with the requirements in the survey team operation orders. 
Confirms or establishes communications procedures among the supporting 
element, survey team, and follow-on advisor team. They identify alternate and 
emergency communications procedures for C2, logistics, and medical or casualty 
evacuation. 
Determines the established communications support requesting procedures 
for the follow-on advisor team. 
The survey team establishes procedures to promote interagency cooperation and 
synchronize operations. The team: 
Identifies the location of appropriate FSF and international or US agencies. 
Contacts the appropriate agencies to establish initial coordination. 
Exchanges information and intelligence.

follow-on advisor mission. 
The survey team commander establishes a direct working relationship and rapport 
with the FSF commander. The survey team: 
Briefs the FSF commander on the advisor team survey mission and the 
restrictions and limitations imposed on the advisor team by the higher US 
commander. 
Assures the FSF commander the commander’s assistance is required to 
develop the tentative objectives for training and advisor assistance. 
Deduces or solicits the FSF commander’s estimate of the unit’s capabilities, 
required training, and advisor assistance, including material requirements. The 
team discusses training (i.e., plans, current status, units available, facilities, and 
any additional requirements). 
The survey team obtains the FSF commander’s approval of the plan in 
accordance with the partner nation’s (PN’s) security force development plan and 
requests a linkup with their counterparts under the mutual supervision of the FSF 
commander and survey team commander. 
The team does not make any promises (or statements that could be construed as 
promises) to the FSF commander about commitments to provide assistance or fulfill 
material requirements. In particular, the survey team does not: 
Make any comment to the host government concerning US Government 
resources of any kind. 
Provide any kind of independent assessment or confirmation of the external 
threat as perceived by the FSF. 
Provide advice on tactics, doctrine, basing, combat planning, or operations. 
The survey team analyzes the FSF unit’s status to determine its requirements for 
advisor assistance. The team: 
Collects enough information to confirm the validity of current intelligence and 
selects tentative training and advisor assistance courses of action (COAs). 
Prepares written estimates for advisor assistance COAs prioritized in order of 
desirability. 
Analyzes the FSF location and its effects on the populace. 
Collects and analyzes all information affecting force protection. 
Determines FSF existing logistics and maintenance support shortfalls and 
capabilities. 
Determines the compatibility of recommended US equipment with equipment 
in the FSF inventory.

The survey team helps the FSF unit prepare facilities (i.e., training, security, and 
administration) for the execution of the mission. The survey team inspects the 
facilities the FSF unit has designated for its use during the mission. The team 
identifies any deficiencies that will prevent execution of the advisor assistance 
COAs. After the inspection, the survey team commander recommends to the FSF 
commander the most desirable COAs to correct any deficiencies found. The survey 
team commander: 
Ensures the FSF commander understands the desired COAs are tentative 
(contingent on the US commander’s decision). 
Ensures the higher, in-country, US commander and country team are 
informed of significant findings in the survey of the FSF unit. 
Provides recommended COAs to the follow-on advisor team after obtaining 
input from the FSF commander. 
The survey team ensures its security at all times according to the latest threat 
assessment. The team: 
Fortifies its position (i.e., quarters, communications, medical spaces, and 
command), using available means, keeping in mind the requirement to maintain 
low visibility. 
Establishes and maintains an internal alert plan. 
Organizes and maintains an internal guard system with at least one member 
who is awake and knows the location of all team members. The guard is ready to 
react to emergencies by following the alert plan and starting defensive actions 
according to established ROE and evasion and recovery procedures. 
Maintains communication with all team members outside the immediate area 
occupied by the team’s main body. 
Before departing from the AO, the survey team visits all appropriate US and FSF 
staff agencies and identifies any unresolved problem areas (see table 17).

ADVISOR TEAM HANDOVER 
“Believe it or not, you will not resolve the insurgency on your watch. Your tour will 
end, and your successors will need your corporate knowledge. Start handover 
folders, in every platoon and specialist squad, from day one. Ideally, you would 
have inherited these from your predecessors, but if not, you must start them.” 
—Lieutenant Colonel David Kilcullen, Ph.D., Australian Army, 
“Twenty-Eight Articles: Fundamentals of Company-Level 
Counterinsurgency” 2006 
1. Advisor Team Relief in Place or Transfer of Authority
In support of a persistent advisor engagement, transition of forces and transfer of 
authority (TOA) are required. Every advisor unit follows a theater-approved relief in 
place (RIP) or TOA checklist managed by the outgoing advisor team leader. The 
incoming team should maximize opportunities to learn from those who are leaving. 
They should observe the outgoing team and learn how its relationships work with its 
foreign security forces (FSF) counterpart. The incoming team should ask lots of 
questions, but not question methods until after completing an assessment.  
The operational environment is often diverse, dynamic, and volatile. In addition, 
every area of operation is different and requires an analysis based on political, 
military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, and time 
aspects defining the area. Understanding these aspects explains how the FSF unit 
operates, defines its motivations and perceptions, and determines its effectiveness. 
The following are questions for consideration by the incoming advisor team. These 
are particularly useful if the advisor is assigned a new FSF unit and does not have 
an opportunity to hold a RIP or TOA. 
Political. What is the dominant political party in the area? Is the government 
effective at influencing the people? Do the people support the government? Is 
there a shadow government in place and is it the source of power? Is there an 
effective neighborhood action council? When and where does it meet? Is the 
neighborhood action council’s process infiltrated by militia or insurgent 
sympathies? 
Military. What FSF authorities operate in the area? Do the advisor’s FSF 
have jurisdiction? What is the division of labor between civil and military units in 
the area of operations (AO)? What is the infiltration factor by insurgents or militia 
in the team’s assigned FSF and others in the area? What are the insurgent’s 
lines of communications and support? What threats exist and how will they fight 
the FSF unit? What coalition units operate in the AO and what can be expected 
from them? 
Economic. What is the poverty level of the AO? What is the primary source of 
income? What criminal activities exploit the AO (e.g., racketeering, prostitution, 
extortion, illegal fuel sales, bomb making, etc.)? What job opportunities exist to 
employ the young and disenfranchised? What role do the FSF have regarding 
144 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
corruption within the economic arena in the AO? What corruption is best left 
alone in the interest of mission accomplishment? 
Social. Is there a tribal network in the AO? Who runs the families and tribes? 
Does the presence of women and children in the streets indicate stability or 
merely the perception of it? Is there a dominant religious or ethnic group, and, if 
so, where does it get its support? What is the ethnic breakdown by neighborhood 
or village? Where do the sectarian dividing lines exist? 
Information. Are there any local media in the area? How do people receive 
their news? How might deception be used against the advisor’s team? What is 
the enemy using to influence information in the area? What are the FSF doing to 
promote a positive perception of security? What are FSF or partner units doing to 
detract from promoting a positive perception of security? 
Infrastructure. What is the current sewage, water, electric, and trash pick-up 
assessment in the AO? What projects must be supported by the FSF? What 
projects require external support? What defines the AO: urban or agrarian (what 
affect does the physical geography have on an insurgency)? What are the road 
conditions? Are there political offices, sensitive sites, or other restricted areas? 
Physical Environment. How do geographical considerations affect the FSF? 
How does terrain benefit or compartmentalize the FSF? How do rivers and other 
water sources affect the population? How do weather or other environmental 
considerations impact the situation? 
Time. Is there a sense of urgency from the people within the AO? How do 
they view time? What are the FSF’s time constraints? 
Departing Team Legacy. The FSF counterparts will speak of the old team as 
if they were long lost brothers after their departure. Honor this relationship. 
Whether they thought the predecessors were competent or incompetent, they 
usually speak highly of them. The advisor should not speak ill of the 
predecessors, regardless of opinion, as this will not endear the advisor to the 
counterparts. 
2. Mission Handover Procedures
Timeline. Table 18 is a sample timeline (checklist) that lists the tasks an advisor 
team performs for mission handover. During long-term advisor operations, the 
commander may elect to replace an advisor team using a mission handover. Mission 
handover is the process of passing an ongoing mission from one unit to another with 
no discernible loss of continuity. On occasion, advisors may be going into a country 
where there has been a gap since the last advisor team was in country (episodic 
engagement). Advisors should look to the combatant command, the theater Service 
component, the theater special operations command, the senior defense official, or 
any other in-country, US defense entities to complete as much of a hand off as 
possible. Table 18 is based on a 179-day requirement and involves two advisor 
teams.

Following planning and preparation, 
the advisor team (less advance party) 
deploys to the area of operations (AO). 
The advisor team deploys with all 
personnel and equipment required to 
perform the assigned mission. If this is 
a first deployment to the AO, the 
advisor team deploys a site survey 
team (advisor team members) to 
coordinate all training with the foreign 
security forces (FSF) unit and the 
United States embassy. If there is an 
advisor team in country, the incoming 
advisor team deploys an advance 
party to coordinate with the deployed 
advisor team and counterparts. 
Area assessment begins as soon as 
the advisor team members arrive in 
country. The advisor team sends the 
information it gathers from the area 
assessment to the incoming team. See 
appendix H for an example of an area 
assessment. 
As soon as the advisor team arrives, it 
establishes communications links with 
the higher, in-country command and 
control element. The advisor team also 
establishes a communications link with 
the advisor commander who has 
authority to order the handover. This 
link becomes the information and 
intelligence link between the in-country 
and incoming advisor teams. It is 
maintained and monitored in 
accordance with prescribed 
communications schedules. 
FSF training begins as soon as the 
advisor team is settled.

Procedures. 
The overall authority for the handover and assumption of command lies with 
the commander ordering the change. The authority for determining the handover 
process lies with the incoming commander, since this commander will assume 
responsibility for the mission. This changeover process may affect the conditions 
under which the mission continues. 
The outgoing commander advises the incoming commander on the tentative 
handover process and mission assumption directly or through a liaison. If this 
handover conflicts with the mission statement or the incoming commander’s 
desires, and the conflict cannot be resolved with the authority established for the 
incoming commander, the commander ordering the relief resolves the issue.

149 
As a rule, the commander ordering the change does not automatically place 
the outgoing advisor team under the incoming advisor team during the 
changeover process.  
Considerations. The incoming and outgoing advisor team commanders must 
consider the following seven factors. 
Mission. The incoming advisor team commander must make a detailed study 
of the advisor mission statement and understand the present and implied mission 
tasks. The mission also may require a unit with additional skill sets, such as 
specific weapons employment or water operations. Knowing the mission, the 
commander’s intent, the commander’s critical information requirements (CCIRs), 
and the information requirements will help the incoming advisor team 
commander understand the mission. The incoming advisor team must become 
familiar with all ongoing and upcoming information requirements and CCIRs. 
After an in-depth study of the operational area, the incoming advisor team 
commander should complete the handover in a manner allowing for continued, 
uninterrupted mission accomplishment. The changeover must not allow the 
enemy to gain any operational advantages. 
Operational Area. The in-country advisor team provides continuous 
intelligence updates to the advisor commander (e.g., priority intelligence 
requirement, information requirements, or relevant operational, strategic, and 
tactical information). The incoming advisor team must become familiar with all 
ongoing and upcoming mission priority intelligence requirements, information 
requirements, and CCIRs. 
Enemy Forces. The incoming advisor team commander must have the latest 
intelligence on all enemy forces affecting the mission. This information can be 
obtained through the unit intelligence officer and include data on criminal- or 
terrorist-related incidents over the past several months. In addition to the normal 
intelligence provided to the incoming advisor team commander on a regular 
basis, the situation calls for a meeting with an intelligence liaison from the 
outgoing team commander.  
Friendly Forces. For the incoming advisor team, learning about the friendly 
forces is as important as knowing the enemy situation. The team must be familiar 
with the command and control structure for daily operations. It must know all blue 
(joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational) units and green 
(nongovernmental, private, and charitable) organizations in the AO and be aware 
of the purpose and capabilities of its mission support base. If possible, the 
incoming advisor team members should receive biographical data on their FSF 
counterparts including photographs. This data allows advisor team members to 
familiarize themselves with their counterparts before deployment. 
FSF. The incoming advisor team plans and prepares for a quick and friction-
free transition in counterpart relations. However, potential or anticipated friction 
between the FSF unit and the incoming advisor team may cause the relief to take 
place more slowly than desired. Therefore, the incoming and outgoing advisor 
teams need a period of overlap to allow for in-country, face-to-face contact with 
150 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
their counterparts before the mission handover. Continued execution of the 
mission must be achieved within the capabilities of the advisor teams, the FSF 
unit, and the available supporting assets. The best case is, if US combat support 
units are to be relieved, the relief should occur after the relief of the advisor 
teams they support. 
Civilian Populace. The incoming advisor team must do an in-depth area 
study giving close attention to local problems. Popular support for US activities 
taking place within the AO may directly influence changes in the mission 
statement. The outgoing advisor team must provide all critical information and 
describe, in detail, the completed civic action projects and those still underway. 
The incoming advisor team must understand the functioning of the local 
government and the status of any international civilian or government agencies 
involved in or influencing the situation in its AO. 
Time. The depth and dispersion of units and the number of operations 
conducted determine the time required to exchange advisor teams. There must 
be an overlap period to allow the incoming advisor team to become familiar with 
the AO and to establish rapport between the team personnel and their FSF 
counterparts. However, the handover operation must take place as quickly as 
possible. The longer the operation takes, the more vulnerable the advisor team in 
the AO becomes as a target for the enemy or terrorists. A quickly executed relief 
reduces the time available for the enemy to strike before the incoming advisor 
team has time to consolidate its position. The advisor team commander should 
not sacrifice continued, uninterrupted execution of ongoing operations for speed. 
The incoming advisor team needs to have enough time to observe training 
techniques and procedures and conduct debriefings on lessons learned. 
An effective RIP/TOA is a critical part of keeping a mission moving toward its end 
state as units begin and finish their rotations. It is in the interests of mission success 
and both the outgoing and incoming units to achieve an effective RIP/TOA, but a 
number of human barriers hinders the process. These barriers and techniques for 
overcoming them are enumerated below: 
Hubris and ego drive some outgoing units to want to protect the 
recognition they will receive for their work and incoming units to downplay 
the previous unit’s accomplishments. Advisors must commit to the mindset 
that working their way out of a job by achieving FSF that have sustainable 
capacity and capability is the ultimate measure of success. Overcoming the 
barrier of hubris establishes mutual respect, honors the hard work of previous US 
advisors, and keeps each unit oriented on the proper focal point: mission 
success. 
(a) For outgoing units, this means advisors continue to own the mission after
departure by genuinely trying to make the next unit better than their own. If
advisors failed to meet their own expectations, they should have the humility
to identify what kept them from achieving more and offer recommendation on
how to overcome those barriers if it could be done again.

151 
(b) For incoming units, this means advisors recognize the limitations of their
situational awareness and make use of the outgoing unit’s tacit knowledge to
help evaluate and war-game ideas on how to proceed.
Force capacity limits and administrative procedures can prevent having 
two people in the same position even for a short time. Units should take 
advantage of technology to elongate the handover process as much as possible. 
They should treat the mission like a movie, not a snapshot, by observing it unfold 
through situation reports and discussions prior to the incoming team’s arrival. 
Outgoing personnel should make every possible effort to identify and contact 
their replacements. Incoming personnel should contact sitting advisors as soon 
as possible after being notified. Once established, the collective RIP discussion 
should be ongoing to and through TOA. 
Determining how to best allow successive teams to “stand on the 
shoulders of giants.” This barrier recognizes the limited human capacity to 
absorb an entire deployment’s worth of data. The question for the outgoing team 
becomes “what is the most important information to convey to the new team and 
how is it best delivered so that they can stand on our shoulders and reach 
higher?” 
Humans are iterative learners. Units should build an RIP plan that 
intentionally covers the same priority information multiple times. The incoming 
unit will make new connections with each iteration, and these connections will 
allow them to create new solutions that they can ask the outgoing team to war-
game. Even if the teams determine that the new solution is not feasible, 
uncovering the “why” through this process will leave the new team with a deeper 
understanding of the problem set and the environment. 
The relationship should persist, but often does not. The crossover 
point—where the incoming unit’s knowledge base is more relevant and complete 
with respect to the current environment than the outgoing unit’s—is somewhere 
beyond the TOA. Therefore, it is helpful for the outgoing unit to write and discuss 
a three-month plan as if it were going to be extended on the mission, given its 
tacit knowledge. Likewise, any changes to that plan by the incoming unit can be 
shared with the outgoing unit after its departure to determine if there is any 
history or cultural nuance that the new team is missing. 
Advisor teams should coordinate a virtual meeting with the team in country. 
During this meeting, the controlling headquarters should be involved and provide the 
command’s perspective of the mission. The current advisors should discuss what 
they are currently doing and where the mission should be when the incoming team 
arrives. If possible, it would be good to add key members from the last previous 
team to return from the mission to get a full appreciation of the mission.

FORCE PROTECTION 
Advisors operating in small teams in remote locations have always found themselves in 
challenging environments where individual advisor security was questionable due to a 
lack of understanding their counterparts and their motives. Attacks on advisors by 
individuals have brought to light the challenges of securing themselves while advising 
their counterparts and maintaining an air of mutual trust. 
1. The Advisor’s Threat Environment
Advisors operate in conditions anywhere on the competition continuum. They 
must deal with local criminal activity, directed terrorist threats, and open combat. 
Their rules of engagement will differ for each and every mission. In many 
environments, advisors may not be armed, while in others, they may have access to 
quick reaction forces and indirect fire or close air support. Additionally, advisors must 
maintain control of their equipment and be careful not to disclose information to 
unapproved sources. In this section, we will explore some of the attributes that make 
the advisor’s threat environment unique. 
Declared Theaters of Active Armed Conflict (DTAACs). A DTAAC 
environment is generally semipermissible or nonpermissible. The threats are clear 
and present, and advisor teams will typically travel to and from engagements, as 
well as conduct meetings/training in a combat posture. Carrying weapons, wearing 
body armor, and establishing external and internal security is often normal in this 
setting. In this environment, the security of the advisor team is often rooted in the 
relationship and trust it has built with its partners, so the team must tune its 
awareness to what is normal in the environment and with foreign security forces 
(FSF) behavior to identify abnormalities and anticipate threats. 
Outside of Declared Theaters of Active Armed Conflict (ODTAACs). An 
ODTAAC environment is generally permissible or semipermissible. Advisor teams 
might stay in a partner nation (PN) hotel or eat in local restaurants rather than stay in 
a hardened defense like those found in a DTAAC. The threats tend to be less visible, 
more insidious, and less familiar to the average advisor, and the advisor team will 
likely not be carrying weapons when not training with FSF. In an ODTAAC 
environment, it is easy to be lulled into a false sense of security and overlook the 
many threat vectors at play, from simple crime to kidnapping and terrorism to great 
power competitors. In this environment, advisor teams must be hyper-vigilant of 
patterns and abnormalities in the environment, as well as news trends that might 
change the local reception of US Service members. Teams will want to move in 
buddy teams or groups even for routine travel or tasks, and incorporate a member of 
the FSF in those groups to benefit from their local knowledge. In the sections that 
follow, additional TTP should be considered while maintaining a smart force 
protection posture.

Force Protection. An overarching security program developed to protect 
uniformed advisors, civilian employees, facilities, information, and equipment in all 
locations and situations across the competition continuum.  
Guardian Angel. An individual designated to perform duties similar to those of a 
personal security detachment by conducting passive surveillance during all 
engagements with PN forces and representatives, including the local populace. The 
guardian angel’s activities should not jeopardize the trust and confidence of the PN 
force. 
At Risk. Uniformed advisors, Department of Defense (DOD) civilians, and DOD 
contractors operating worldwide are at risk because of the value that they represent 
to threat actors of all kinds. 
Key Leader Engagement. An engagement between individuals to clarify 
information requirements, exchange information, or gain a decision. 
Personal Motivation. Perpetrators act on their own accord; motivated by personal 
dispute, combat stress, extremist ideology, mental illness, and cultural insensitivity of 
international forces.  
Co-option. Perpetrators who are recruited or coerced by the opposition. The 
opposition uses physical intimidation, financial incentives, ideological appeal, and 
family ties. 
Infiltration. The opposition enlists in the PN security force with the intent of 
collecting intelligence or conducting high-profile attacks against coalition or PN 
forces. 
Impersonation. The opposition uses PN security force uniforms to gain access to 
coalition or PN security force facilities to conduct an attack.  
Evasion. The process whereby isolated personnel avoid capture with the goal of 
successfully returning to areas under friendly control. 
Evasion Plan of Action. A course of action developed prior to executing a combat 
mission that is intended to improve a potential isolated person’s chances of 
successful evasion and recovery by providing the recovery forces with an additional 
source of information that can increase the predictability of the evader’s action and 
movement.  
Isolated Personnel. United States military, DOD civilians, and contractor 
personnel (and others designated by the President or Secretary of Defense) who are 
separated from their unit (as an individual or a group) while participating in a United 
States sponsored military activity or mission, and are, or may be, in a situation 
where they must survive, evade, resist, or escape. 
Isolated Personnel Guidance. A series of classified, country-specific products 
developed to provide information to enhance survivability in the event of isolation or 
captivity. Isolated personnel guidance incorporates information found in other 
references and are designed to be used with intelligence assessments, culture 
briefs, country studies, and other products.

Isolated Personnel Report (also referred to as an ISOPREP). A DOD form 
containing information designed to facilitate the identification and authentication of 
an isolated person by a recovery force. 
Personnel Recovery. The sum of military, diplomatic, and civil efforts to prepare 
for and execute the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel. 
Recovery. Personnel recovery actions taken to physically gain custody of isolated 
personnel and return that person to friendly control.  
Irregular Threat. A diverse and dynamic combination of regular forces, irregular 
forces, and criminal elements unified to achieve mutually benefitting effects. In the 
context of growing great power competition, irregular threats are becoming harder to 
identify. In some cases, they are merely a collection on team activities such that 
TTP, patterns, or objectives can be passed to the host nation of the threat—or such 
that the team can be threatened or extorted for anything embarrassing or anything 
that can be twisted to seem embarrassing. In other cases, these threats can be used 
to sabotage or subvert the advising mission, like in the case of threat financing. 
Threat financing can present itself in a variety of ways, but it is typically a 
clandestine activity, so it is difficult to determine whether the source of what the team 
is experiencing is rooted in malicious intent or a coincidence. For instance, FSF may 
have massive absences or tardiness during training events, which disrupts mission 
accomplishment for the team; the FSF behavior could be tied to foreign financing 
that did not show up during Leahy vetting. There may be subversion of training 
because a foreign entity is paying to create a major accident or traffic jam along the 
route to training each day, or they are paying members of the FSF to disrupt or slow 
down mission progress while also collecting and passing information on the team. In 
some cases, threat financing does not affect the advising mission, but advisors may 
see indicators that would be of value to the US embassy that a foreign entity is 
attempting to gain greater influence over the PN by purchasing things like a majority 
of the shipping ports or tourist infrastructure. With these examples of threat financing 
in mind, we will briefly discuss what the advisor’s role is in identifying and reporting 
threat financing. 
Note: Leahy vetting is the implementation of US law through the process in which 
prospective aid recipients are searched for evidence of past commission of gross 
human rights violation.    
A mapping of the fiscal operational environment (OE) is something that 
should be included in a team’s country study. The first team working on a 
particular mission should consider requesting special operations forces support 
or tapping into finance or comptroller expertise to get an initial baseline of the 
fiscal OE. This support may come in the form of collocating with the team 
(depending on force cap limitations) or reachback support. 
During mission preparation, advisors should receive a sensitization brief from 
the combatant command or theater special operations command on activity in 
the PN by strategic competitors. These briefings are important to understand the 
competitors’ activities and objectives within the PN and where there are holes in 
156 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
the US understanding of the threat picture. Advisors often have unique 
placement in and around a PN, so maintaining continual situational awareness 
can lead to reports that provide valuable information to the agencies that analyze 
the OE. 
3. Force Protection Concepts, Personnel Selection, and Training
Force protection can be critical to an advisor and the advisor team’s success. 
Advisors must strive to maintain situational awareness and understand all current, 
external, and internal threats in their assigned area of operations. Advisors should 
know what looks normal. Understanding the culture, history, local languages, and 
values can be an advisor’s greatest asset. Isolated personnel guidance is a country-
specific product to enhance the advisors’ understanding of the impact of these 
factors. 
While advisors focus on building their counterparts’ capability and capacity, it is 
critical the advisors operate in secure environments. In wartime, this can be difficult, 
if not impossible, to achieve.  
Remember, the rapport advisors develop with their counterparts can strengthen 
their counterparts’ desire to protect them and their team. It is important for advisors 
working with PN military forces and police to build rapport and trust. In some 
cultures, advisor teams are considered the guest of the PN security force and any 
harm to advisors can reflect negatively on the host.  
Interpreters can be crucial to rapport building with FSF and can aid in picking up 
on side-bar conversations and interpreting nonverbal cues of potential threats.  
Rapport can be the advisors’ first line of defense. Advisors should keep their 
counterparts close by learning everything they can about them. They should learn 
their problems and develop solutions. 
For advisor teams with a dedicated security force, early selection and training of 
those individuals are important. The individuals selected must demonstrate sound 
tactical judgment as well as tactical patience, and should be prepared to respond 
immediately to threats. 
For advisor teams without a security force, the advisor team should have each 
individual trained to perform force protection roles as part of additional duties. When 
performing force protection duties, it is critical that force protection duties be their 
only focus and that no additional advising duties be performed. 
Where appropriate, teams should develop several levels of defensive preparation 
and overwatch to ensure self-protection. 
A unit standard operating procedure should cover preparation and mindset at the 
individual, buddy team, section, and overall unit levels and provide for reachback 
support. Advisors should rehearse buddy team and section-level drills and individual 
precombat inspections regularly.  
Knowledge of PNs is the first level of security. Knowing what is “normal” and 
recognizing the “absence of normal” are the best ways to spot indicators of an 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
157 
insider threat. Actions to take vary. They may be immediate actions in self-defense 
or the advisor may decide to start quietly by building a PN target packet.  
Periodically, the team should hold an internal debrief or after action review of 
changes in partner behavior and rapport.  
In addition to spotting indicators of immediate and future threats, team members 
should always know their closest rally point; who is overwatching them; the primary, 
alternate, contingency, and emergency plans; standing linkup procedures; local 
danger areas; and the lost advisor drill in accordance with their evasion plan of 
action. Evasion plans of action are described in JP 3-50, Personnel Recovery.  
Individual preparation and mindset are the next layers of security. All team 
members should carry (on their person) items to navigate, signal, sustain, and 
protect themselves for a short period. Most important, advisors need to be “escape-
minded.” Advisors must have a comprehensive knowledge of their issued 
communication devices and how to secure them, and a working knowledge of 
survival equipment and techniques and aids (e.g., personal locater beacons, evasion 
charts, blood chits, pointee-talkees). Advisors must remain knowledgeable of their 
evasion plan of action and isolated personnel report, and be mentally and physically 
prepared to survive and evade (perhaps over an extended period) until recovered or 
upon reaching friendly forces. 
The first level of overwatch is the buddy team. Advisors should develop a habit of 
keeping an interval between team members, covering each other’s flank (360°), and 
covering entryways and avenues of approach. Team members should maintain 
situational awareness for each other and be ready to shoot first. 
The security force is the second level of overwatch. Leaders will have to enforce 
using buddy teams during mundane activities (such as key leader engagements), 
during physical training, or in the tactical operations center. They ensure teams are 
able to support each other as much as possible (mutual support), even if it is only as 
an immediate reaction team. Where appropriate, leaders develop standard operating 
procedures to ensure someone has a loaded weapon any time the advisor or team 
is working with local nationals. The weapon may have to be concealed. Leaders plan 
for the worst-case scenario and rehearse for active shooter, isolated Service 
member, and lost individual situations. 
The final level of overwatch should be reachback support to higher headquarters 
and continental United States intelligence support. Advisor teams should constantly 
spot and assess potential threats and vet them with organizations having more time 
and assets. Additionally, the teams should consider using biometric and other 
technical identification equipment and have a plan for where to send information 
gathered using it. 
Advisors should make sure to complete their current antiterrorism training and 
any other theater force protection requirements prior to deploying.

POST-MISSION DEBRIEFING PROCEDURES 
1. General
The advisor team commander conducts a debriefing providing an overview of the 
mission, military geography, political parties, military forces, insurgents, foreign 
security forces (FSF), underground, targets, health and sanitation practices of the 
populace, and evasion and recovery.  
Redeployment is not the end of the mission. Upon arrival at the redeployment 
location, the advisor team undergoes an extensive debriefing. The supported unit 
intelligence section organizes and conducts the debriefing subject to the unit’s 
standard operating procedures. (See table 19.) 
The intelligence section coordinates with higher level intelligence organizations to 
take part in the advisor team debriefing. All deployed personnel must be available for 
the debriefing. 
After the debriefing, the advisor team leader, with the assistance of other 
members of the team, prepares two documents: an after action review (AAR) and a 
report of lessons learned. Depending on the nature of the mission, these documents 
may need to be classified. 
2. AAR
The AAR states the who, what, when, where, and how of the operation. It is a 
permanent record of the team’s major activities from isolation to debriefing. As such, it is 
an extremely important template by which past missions may be compared and future 
missions planned. Normally, the AAR is submitted through command channels to the 
higher commander no later than 48 hours after an advisor team has been debriefed. 
The intelligence and operations officers at each echelon keep copies of the advisor 
team’s AARs.  
3. Lessons Learned
Shortly after completing the AAR, or simultaneously with its submission, the advisor 
team leader submits a report of lessons learned. This is the team leader’s reflection on 
the most recent operation and recommendation for the future. One preparation method 
is to organize the lessons according to the seven joint warfighting functions: command 
and control, movement and maneuver, information, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and 
protection. The debrief addresses what worked or did not work during the operation, 
why it did or did not work, and what changes or substitutions are needed for existing 
tactics, techniques, and procedures for the unit. Though the specific format will be 
provided by the component headquarters the team is serving, table 19 gives an 
example of a post-mission debrief. 
Note: Useful AARs are built throughout the mission, rather than waiting until the end to 
recall all of the impressions the team had throughout. A best practice is to revisit the 
AAR framework and any points of interest the US embassy and component 
headquarters had, then recording relevant ideas in a weekly situation report (SITREP).

OTHER STAKEHOLDERS 
1. United States Embassy
The Department of State is represented overseas by United States (US) 
embassies. In the embassies, the chief of mission (COM) is an ambassador who 
serves as the personal representative of the President and the Secretary of State. 
As principal officer in the embassy, the COM oversees all US Government programs 
and interactions within the partner nation (PN) and is charged with the operations 
and security of the mission and all its employees. The COM has full responsibility for 
the direction, coordination, and supervision of all Department of Defense (DOD) 
personnel on official duty in country, regardless of their employment categories or 
location, except those under command of a combatant commander (CCDR) or on 
the staff of an international organization. The COM chairs the embassy’s country 
team, which meets on a weekly basis to discuss and coordinate all activities within 
the mission. 
The deputy chief of mission (DCM) serves as the chief of staff of the embassy 
and manages the daily operations of the embassy staff. In matters that cross agency 
lines within the country team, the DCM coordinates and facilitates decisions or 
makes recommendations to the COM. In the temporary absence of the ambassador, 
or during an interim period between ambassadors, the DCM assumes the title of 
chargé d’ affaires. While the COM focuses attention outward toward the PN, the 
DCMs focuses internally, ensuring the country team is working smoothly in support 
of the COM’s objectives. 
The Country Team. The COM at each US embassy heads the team of US 
Government personnel, collectively known as the “country team.” The country team 
is the principal means by which a diplomatic mission comes together as a 
cooperative, coordinated, and well-informed staff. A country team’s organization is 
dependent on embassy size and the nature of US interests in a country, with some 
including more than 40 agencies. See figure 17 for an example of US embassy 
organization. 
The political officer, or sometimes the political-military officer, is located 
within the embassy’s political section and deals with domestic politics, human 
rights, external relations, international organizations, political and military issues, 
labor, and narcotics. Additionally, the political office is the section that is primarily 
responsible for human rights vetting for potential international military education 
and training provided by the US.  
The regional security officer (also referred to as RSO) has overall 
responsibility for security, antiterrorism, and force protection for all personnel 
under the authority of the COM and is responsible for the embassy’s emergency 
action plan. The regional security officer also supervises the Marine security 
guard detachment, where assigned. 
170 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
The economic section can provide valuable information on the host country’s 
economy, budget, and its ability to support military purchases, and deals with 
trade, import/export issues, environment, science and technological issues, 
agriculture, energy, and communications. In many embassies, the transition to a 
single political-economics unit is occurring. 
The consular operations section issues immigrant and nonimmigrant visas 
and provides US citizen services such as citizenship determination, replacing lost 
or stolen passports, and assistance with federal benefits, arrests, deaths, and 
notary services.  
The public affairs section coordinates media, cultural, and educational 
programs; its leader acts as the primary spokesperson for the mission. All 
significant military events should be coordinated with the embassy public affairs 
section. 
The management section includes the human resources, financial 
management, information management, health services, community liaison, 
facility management, and general services operations subunits. In addition, it 
addresses issues of reciprocity with the host government, interagency 
administrative support, and community-wide benefits (such as post allowances). 
Figure 17. US Embassy Organization 
The senior defense official (SDO) is the COM’s principal military advisor, the 
senior DOD military officer assigned to a US diplomatic mission, and serves as 
defense attaché (DATT) to the PN and the chief of security cooperation at that US 
embassy. As such, the SDO/DATT acts as the in-country focal point for planning, 
coordinating, supporting, and executing US defense issues and activities in the host 
nation. This includes security cooperation (SC) programs under the oversight of the 
15 June 2023 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
171 
CCDR. The SDO/DATT is the single point of contact for all DOD matters involving 
the US mission or DOD elements assigned to, or working from, the US mission. All 
DOD elements under COM authority are under the coordinating authority of the 
SDO/DATT, except for the Marine security guard detachment. The SDO/DATT 
operates under the authority of the COM, and is the key figure within the US mission 
for establishing and fostering a SC relationship with the host nation. 
Security cooperation organizations (SCOs) are all DOD elements located in a 
foreign country (as part of the US embassy or consulate) responsible for carrying 
out SC and security assistance management functions. They include military 
assistance advisory groups, military missions and groups, offices of defense and 
military cooperation, liaison groups, and DATT personnel designated to perform 
SC or security assistance functions. SCOs in PNs play a key role in planning, 
coordinating, and executing security assistance and other SC programs, 
especially those that involve providing education or training. Specifically, SCOs 
are responsible for managing the host nation military’s requests, sales, and 
deliveries of US defense equipment, training, and services. 
For security force assistance, the SCO (with country team approval) will 
coordinate with the PN and the executing unit once direct liaison authorized is 
granted from the Service component. It also coordinates for logistical support on 
the ground. 
Other US Government Agencies. Advisors should be aware of other 
governmental organizations that may have advisor teams in country that are working 
certain aspects of developing the security force. For example, the Department of 
Justice may have teams that are conducting rule of law training or advising. These 
entities should be able to be reached through coordination with the SDO and the 
country team. 
2. Combatant Commands
CCDRs are assigned a geographic area of responsibility (AOR) and are 
responsible for the missions in their AOR, unless otherwise directed. CCDRs are 
responsible for aligning military activities with diplomatic activities in their AOR with 
the COM and the country team. The CCDR plans and implements military strategies, 
operations, and interorganizational coordination. CCDR planning is contained in 
theater campaign plans (TCPs). Depending on the preferences of the CCDR, the 
TCP can be divided into regional campaign plans and subdivided into country-
specific SC sections/country plans. 
Theater campaign planning should incorporate country planning and the CCDR’s 
country plans, or in some cases, regional plans. Also, they should align with the 
COM’s goals because TCP activities and resource investments occur at the country 
level. Individual country plans should add details regarding routine SC activities that 
would include advising activities. 
CCDRs are responsible for the missions in their AOR, which include planning, 
conducting, and assessing SC activities. CCDRs also delineate specific command 
172 
ATP 3-07.10/MCRP 3-03D.1/NTTP 3-07.5/AFTTP 3-2.76 
15 June 2023 
authorities and relationships necessary for security force assistance missions or 
other regional training missions, or delegate this to a Service component command. 
3. Service Component Commands
Combatant commands have a Service component command (SCC) from each of 
the Services. The SCCs provide Service-specific support and activity proposals as 
well as assist the CCDR with Service-specific forces, equipment, and resources. 
They also prepare supporting plans to the CCDR’s TCP.  
The Service components are responsible for developing the Service-specific 
proposals that meet the vision in the program of activities and milestones of the 
country plans. They must ensure the appropriate authorities are in place to support 
the mission. The SCCs will develop a concept sheet for an advising mission, liaise 
with the country team and unit sourced to complete the mission, assist with 
predeployment training, and complete vetting of planned content. Planners must 
ensure that authorization has been granted by the combatant command or SCC 
prior to coordinating directly with subordinate command structures or US embassy 
personnel.  
4. Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs)
TSOCs are subordinate unified commands established by United States Special 
Operations Command (USSOCOM) to plan, coordinate, conduct, and support joint 
special operations within an AOR. These commands and special operations forces 
(SOF) are under the combatant command (command authority) of USSOCOM, and 
under the operational control of the CCDRs. The CCDRs’ operational control of SOF is 
exercised through the TSOCs when operating within their AORs. TSOCs coordinate 
SOF integration and Service component support of SOF for foreign internal defense, 
security force assistance, counterinsurgency, unconventional warfare, foreign 
humanitarian assistance, and other special operations core activities in all campaigns 
and operations. TSOCs support SOF conducting security force assistance activities and 
other SC activities in support of the CCDRs’ TCPs.
