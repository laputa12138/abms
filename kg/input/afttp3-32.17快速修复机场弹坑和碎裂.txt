Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Overview. Crater repair is part of the larger process of Rapid Airfield 
Damage Recovery (RADR), see Figure 1.1. This includes planning for attack, 
surviving the attack, assessing the damage, mitigating hazards, warehouse 
operations and crater repair. 
 
Figure 1.1. RADR Process. 
 
 
1.1.1. The crater repair process is based on an assembly line concept where the 
assembly line moves from crater to crater. Each step in the crater repair process 
has a dedicated crew that performs the same repair step at each crater, one crater 
after another until the step has been completed on all craters in the identified repair 
zone. The six steps of the crater repair process are:  
 
1- Debris Removal 
2- Upheaval Marking 
10                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
3- Pavement Cutting 
4- Pavement Breaking & Excavation 
5- Backfilling 
6- Capping 
 
1.1.2. The predominant expected crater size results in an 8.5-foot by 8.5-foot by 
24-inch-deep repair. Repairs are based on 18-inch-thick concrete runway surfaces 
with no reinforcing steel, or asphalt surfaces of any thickness. Under ideal condi-
tions, a crater repair team can complete 18 small craters or two large craters in 6.5 
hours. 
 
1.1.3. Figure 1.2. identifies repair processes and time to complete each process 
and Table 1.1. and Table 1.2. provide completion times per crater. Repair times 
listed include travel between repairs and setup time, but do not include airfield 
damage assessment, unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) mitigation, convoy 
to the repair area, CBRN threat, extreme weather variances, equipment variances, 
team proficiencies, or personnel/equipment attrition.

Note:  Timelines in Table 1.1. and Table 1.2. are projected under ideal repair 
conditions. Actual repair times may differ, depending on site condition, crater 
size, or equipment malfunction.

1.2. Command and Control. Rapid Airfield Crater and Spall Repair has four 
levels of command: (1) Rapid Airfield Damage Recovery (RADR) Officer in 
Charge (OIC), (2) Crater Repair Chief, (3) Crater Repair Team Lead, and (4) Crew 
Leads, see Figure 1.2. for org chart. 
 
 
12                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
Figure 1.3. RADR Command and Control Overview. 
 
 
 
1.2.1. Rapid Airfield Damage Recovery (RADR) Officer in Charge (OIC). The 
RADR OIC assists the Crater Repair Chief by addressing unresolved problems. 
The OIC does so by requesting support from the Logistics Chief or Support Chief 
and their RADR teams (e.g., Warehouse Teams, Foreign Object Debris [FOD] 
Removal Team, and Aircraft Arresting System Team) or through the Civil Engi-
neer (CE) Unit Control Center (UCC) Commander when support is required from 
sources outside of CE (e.g., vehicle maintenance, fuels). The RADR OIC works 
closely with Operations Management personnel (3E6X1) to track personnel, ve-
hicles, and materials and ensure resupply actions happen in a timely manner to 
support future requirements. 
 
1.2.2. Crater Repair Chief. The Crater Repair Chief actively manages multiple 
crater repair teams. The Chief’s primary responsibility is ensuring the crater repair 
teams are progressing in a timely manner and addressing disruptions such as 
equipment breakdowns, material shortages, and personnel problems. The Chief 
communicates with the Logistics Chief and Support Chief when support is re-
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           13 
 
quired from, or needed by, logistics and support teams. He or she has direct com-
munications with the Warehouse Team Leads supporting the Crater Repair 
Teams. The Crater Chief contacts the RADR OIC when support may be needed 
from external organizations (e.g., fuels and vehicle maintenance). Also, the Crater 
Chief informs the RADR OIC when crews have completed their primary task and 
are available to assist elsewhere. 
 
1.2.3. Crater Repair Team Leads. Team leads manage multiple crater repair crews. 
As with the Crater Repair Chief, team leads manage repair crews and monitor 
operations for impediments that may prevent crews from completing their tasks 
on schedule. When a crew experiences problems, the Lead assists with addressing 
the obstacles and reports delays to the Crater Repair Chief. 
 
1.2.4. Crew Leads. Crew Leads manage their crew to ensure all necessary equip-
ment, vehicles, and materials are available to complete their tasks within repair 
timelines. The seven crater repair crews are: 
 
1- Debris Removal 
2- Upheaval Marking 
3- Pavement Cutting 
4- Pavement Breaking and Excavation 
5- Backfilling 
6- Capping 
7- Spall Repair 
 
1.3. General Safety Considerations. In standard and nonstandard construction 
practices, there are multiple known risk factors in performing RADR duties. It is 
vital to protect workers from hazards such as high-pressure subsystems and com-
ponents, harmful solvents and adhesives, and silica dust. The risks and safety fac-
tors involved with materials and operations should be identified prior and briefed 
to all personnel that could be involved. A key responsibility of supervisors is to 
ensure personnel have and wear the necessary personal protective equipment 
(PPE) and individual protective equipment for the working environment. Unsafe 
field operations while conducting RADR could cause long and short-term inju-
ries, health issues, disable equipment, and negatively affect the mission. 
14                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
 
1.3.1. Published Guidance. Review applicable safety standards and technical man-
uals for additional safety requirements before performing RADR operations. 
Guidance can be found in the following subparagraphs. Compliance with tech-
nical order warnings and cautions is essential. 
 
1.3.2. DAFMAN 91-203, Air Force Occupational Safety, Fire, and Health Stand-
ards, lists PPE for selected CE activities. Although technical orders (T.O.) and 
other job-related publications address proper wear and use of PPE and individual 
protective equipment, workers ultimately have the responsibility to properly use, 
inspect, and care for protective equipment assigned.  
 
1.3.3. Consult AFI 48-137, Respiratory Protection Program for training docu-
mentation procedures and inhalation guidance. Refer to 29 CFR 1910.133, Eye 
and Face Protection, and AFI 48-127, Occupational Noise and Hearing Conser-
vation Program, for additional guidance and information. For end users consult 
29 CFR 1910.134, Respiratory Protection. 
 
1.3.4. Handlers and users of any polymeric repair material should ensure a Safety 
Data Sheet (SDS) from the manufacturer always accompanies the material. Be-
fore use, review and follow the SDS guidance for personal protective equipment 
and other safety precautions. 
 
1.3.5. In accordance with AFMRA/SG3PB Policy Memo dated 30 Sept. 2020, 
“Commanders have the discretion to elect the use of the Joint Service General 
Purpose Mask (JSGPM) M50 series protective mask as approved by Air Force 
Bioenvironmental Engineer or a National Institute of Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH) certified respirator for “Training events Only”. PPE is identified 
in Table 1.3. 
 
1.4. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Supervisors should coordinate with 
the Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight and the Wing Safety office on the PPE 
needed to perform RADR operations. Brief safety procedures and appropriate 
PPE before operations and verify that all PPE has been approved for the work to 
be performed. See Table 1.3. for a list of PPE for typical RADR operations. Note: 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           15 
 
Breathing crystalline silica dust is a serious health hazard. Those performing du-
ties where they may be exposed to silica dust should wear appropriate PPE (in-
cluding respiratory and eye protection) according to Commander’s guidance.

RESOURCES 
2.1. Crater Repair Team Manning. No personnel UTCs are exclusively dedi-
cated to RADR. Teams are manned from CE beddown or base operating support 
force Unit Type Codes (UTCs). Table 2.1. identifies manning requirements for 
the Crater Repair Team by crew (AFTTP 3-32.10, Introduction to Rapid Airfield 
Damage Recovery, provides complete airfield recovery manning requirements for 
various RADR capabilities).

Note*: Two individuals from the Upheaval Marking Crew transfer to the Backfill 
or Capping Crew after completing marking tasks, but they are not counted twice 
and not dual tasked. This will typically mean that these individuals will go to 
whichever process requires the volumetric mixer e.g., if the operation is a rapid 
set concrete repair, they would be on the Capping Crew and if the operation is an 
asphalt repair, they would be on the Backfill Crew. 
 
2.2. Crater and Spall Repair UTCs. Crater and spall repair UTCs equip one 
Crater Repair Team with tools, equipment, material, and vehicles required to com-
plete eighteen 8.5-ft x 8.5-ft repairs or two 30-ft x 30-ft repairs, and up to 200

spalls (24 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep). These UTCs are scalable and 
modular to provide larger capabilities. The four crater and spall repair UTCs are: 
• 
4FWCR:  Crater Repair Vehicles and Equipment 
• 
4FWCM:  Concrete Cap Repair Materials 
• 
4FWAE:  Asphalt Cap Repair Materials 
• 
4FWSR:  Spall Repair Equipment and Materials 
 
2.2.1. Crater Repair Vehicles and Equipment (4FWCR). This UTC provides crater 
repair vehicles with associated work-tool attachments, equipment, and tools as 
identified in Table 2.2. The UTC is tasked three times for a medium-, five times 
for a large-, and seven times for a very large-capability.

2.2.2. Crater Repair Material (4FWCM and 4FWAE). There are two crater repair 
materials UTCs: 4FWCM provides repair materials for repairs with concrete caps 
and is managed by warehouse operations; 4FWAE provides repair materials for 
repairs with Asphalt Caps and materials are split to be managed by warehouse 
operations (flowable-fill backfill material) and the asphalt batch plant (asphalt 
material). Table 2.3. lists the repair material quantities.

Note:  Rapid-Set repair material provided in UTC 4FWCM is provided by a sole 
source vendor with proprietary rights to the design. Curing time of a locally 
sourced rapid-setting concrete mix most likely will not meet the required cure 
time. In addition, the volumetric mixer in UTC 4FWCR is designed specifically 
to mix rapid-set or flowable-fill materials in 4FWCM. Therefore, using locally 
acquired rapid-setting concrete materials in the volumetric mixer may not provide 
the proper water to repair material mixture. 
 
2.2.2.1. Flowable-fill and rapid set repair materials contain concentrated amounts 
of crystalline silica. Over exposure to crystalline silica may cause chronic silico-
sis, a serious and incurable respiratory disease. The following is a rule-of-thumb 
regarding silica: if dust containing silica is visible in the air, it is almost always 
over the permissible limit. 
 
2.2.2.2. In accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
Standard 29 CFR 1910.134, individuals in RADR positions (e.g., excavation spot-
ters, volumetric mixer loading helpers, helpers slashing flowable-fill sacks, Spall 
Repair Crew) exposed to respirable crystalline silica (i.e., airborne dust from the 
repair material) must wear a suitable National Institute of Occupation Safety and 
Health (NIOSH)-certified respirator. Operators of vehicles with air conditioning 
do not require respirators if the air conditioning is on and windows are shut. 
 
2.2.2.3. NIOSH recommends using N95, R95, or P95 respirators to minimize in-
halation of silica dust. Find NIOSH-certified N95 filtering face-piece respirators 
(GM 8210) in Drawer #1 of the RADR Tool Trailer. In addition, suitable dust 
goggles must be worn. 
 
2.2.3. Spall Repair Equipment and Materials (4FWSR). This UTC provides equip-
ment and materials necessary to repair up to 200 spalls. Attachment 2 lists the 
UTC’s equipment and materials.

POST ATTACK ACTIONS 
 
3.1. Actions. Once released under ALARM BLACK or YELLOW and directed 
by the CE UCC, depending on installation plans, perform the following actions to 
prepare for airfield recovery processes. Note:  Long-lead, pre-threat, and pre-at-
tack actions are listed in AFTTP 3-32.10, Introduction to Rapid Airfield Damage 
Recovery. 
 
3.1.1. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) distributes the selected Minimum 
Airfield Operating Surface (MAOS) coordinates to the Rapid Airfield Damage 
Recovery Officer in Charge (RADR OIC) in the Civil Engineer-Unit Control Cen-
ter (CE-UCC). The OIC, with assistance from the Crater Repair Chief, verifies 
convoy routes and assigns repair zones to crater repair teams.  
 
3.1.2. The RADR OIC and Crater Repair Chief receive Geospatial Expeditionary 
Planning Tool (GeoExPT) reports identifying repair zones and damage to repair 
within the repair zones. They then determine type of repairs that will be performed 
in each repair zone and order of repairs. Note:  A repair zone is a grouping of 
damage assigned to a single repair team, performing a single repair method (e.g., 
for a medium capability, two teams may be assigned concrete caps and the third 
assigned as asphalt caps). Craters are typically within 100 feet of each other, with 
18 small or 2 large craters per repair zone. Craters greater than 100 feet apart begin 
to introduce travel time inefficiencies. 
 
3.1.3. Upon direction from the UCC/RADR OIC, teams receive the RADR brief-
ing from the OIC. The briefing can be provided to the Team Leads only or, if 
practical, to the entire RADR work force. The briefing provides MAOS infor-
mation such as minimum operating strip (MOS) coordinates, taxiways to repair, 
ramp areas to repair, repair zone coordinates, and the type of repairs to be per-
formed, see Attachment 3 for recommended briefing template. GeoExPT reports 
by repair zone are passed to each Crater Repair Team Lead. Note:  While not in 
the briefing template, remind personnel that several repair materials (flowable fill, 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           21 
 
rapid set cement concrete, citric acid, spall repair material, etc.) are involved in 
the crater and spall repair processes that may cause potential negative health ef-
fects. Stress the use of proper personal protective equipment and administering 
first aid measures, as described in the respective Material Safety Data Sheets, 
should any chemicals get in eyes, on skin, ingested, or inhaled. 
 
3.1.4. Either after the RADR briefing or during the briefing if only team leads are 
briefed, teams prepare vehicles for the convoy by splitting the Foreign Object De-
bris (FOD) Removal vehicles at the front of the convoy to escort teams to their 
repair zones (FOD removal procedures can be found in Chapter 9). Crater Repair 
Team debris removal vehicles may assist the FOD Removal Team with clearing 
routes to the airfield. Position the remaining vehicles in order of crater repair tasks 
(e.g., debris removal, upheaval marking, pavement cutting, pavement breaking 
and excavation, backfill, and capping). The remaining Support Teams (e.g., Air-
field Lighting, Airfield Marking and Striping, Aircraft Arresting Systems) are typ-
ically postured behind the Crater Repair Crews. Warehouse and Asphalt Batch 
Plant vehicles proceed to their designated operating locations. Once the convoy 
has been postured, teams await the order to mobilize to the airfield. 
 
3.1.5. Material Shortage assessment. Warehouse Leads determine if on-hand re-
pair material quantities are sufficient to complete required repairs and report find-
ings to the Logistics Chief. 
 
3.1.5.1. The initial material requirements are generated from damage inputs pro-
cessed through GeoExPT. The Upheaval Marking Crew reports dimensions of 
surveyed repair patches to the supporting Logistics Chief (located in the CE UCC) 
for comparison to initial GeoExPT estimates to verify sufficient stocks of repair 
material are available. After excavation, the spotter reports actual repair volume 
(width x length x depth) to the supporting Logistic Chief to determine if sufficient 
repair material is on hand; material procurement, production, substitution, and de-
livery must be adjusted accordingly when different than the initial GeoExPT esti-
mates. 
 
3.1.5.1.1. When it is known repair material will run short, there are repair devia-
tions to help overcome shortages; however, these deviations come at a cost. 
22                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
 
3.1.5.1.2. Deviating from procedures described in the following chapters results 
in repairs failing with fewer aircraft passes. This requires the runway to be closed 
more often to repair the repairs, which may impact the air tasking order (ATO). 
 
3.1.5.1.3. Any repair deviations should be approved through the CE-UCC and 
reserved, to the greatest extent possible, for repairs furthest from the MOS cen-
terline, at the end of a unidirectional MOS, and in the middle of a bi-directional 
MOS. 
 
3.1.5.1.4. All repairs within aircraft landing gear paths should be accomplished 
IAW prescribed procedures in Chapters 4 and 5. 
 
3.1.5.1.5. Besides reducing the repair dimensions to the greatest extent possible 
while still ensuring all upheaval is removed, the following repair deviations may 
help overcome repair material shortages. 
 
3.1.5.2. Flowable Fill Backfill Material Shortages. The following repair devia-
tions may help extend flowable fill repair material. Recommend they be per-
formed in the order as listed if materials are available. 
 
3.1.5.2.1. Backfilling under a concrete cap: 
 
• 
Reduce repair excavation depth from 24 inches to 20 inches and backfill 
with 10 inches of flowable-fill. 
• 
Partially backfill with two compacted 3-inch lifts (6-inch for large crater) 
of crushed stone in the bottom of the repair and finish backfill with 8 
inches of flowable-fill. 
• 
Completely replace flowable-fill backfill with crushed stone. 
 
3.1.5.2.2. Backfilling under an asphalt cap: 
 
• 
Reduce repair excavation depth from 24 inches to 18 inches and backfill 
with 8 inches of flowable-fill. 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           23 
 
• 
Partially backfill with two compacted 3-inch lifts (6-inch for large cra-
ters) of crushed stone in the bottom part of the repair and finish backfill 
with 8 inches of flowable-fill.  
• 
Replace flowable-fill backfill with crushed stone. 
 
3.1.5.3. Rapid Set Capping Material Shortages. The following repair deviations 
may help extend rapid set repair material. Recommend they be performed in the 
order as listed if materials are available. 
 
• 
Increase backfill thickness from 14 inches to 18 inches and cap the repair 
with 6 inches of rapid-set. 
• 
Use wet placed flowable-fill backfill method and cap repair with asphalt. 
• 
Fill entire repair with flowable-fill. 
 
3.1.5.4. Asphalt Capping Material Shortages. The following repair deviations may 
help extend asphalt repair material. Recommend they be performed in the order 
as listed if materials are available. 
 
• 
Reclaim asphalt from suitable asphalt pavements on the installation such 
as parking lots, runway/taxiway shoulders, roads, etc. 
• 
Use dry placement flowable-fill backfill method and cap repair with 
rapid-set concrete as described in Chapter 4. 
 
3.1.6. Once sufficient numbers of explosive hazards have been mitigated and por-
tions of the repair zones opened for repair, the RADR teams are directed to pro-
ceed to the airfield. The FOD Removal Team leads the convoy followed by the 
Upheaval Marking Crew assigned to the first repair zone encountered. 
 
3.2. Mobilizing Repair Force. The EOC informs the UCC of selected MAOS 
details and directs commencement of RADR operations. The UCC, in turn, directs 
the RADR teams. Since the RADR OIC is normally in the UCC during the MAOS 
selection phase and can observe damage plotting, he/she should be fully aware of 
the overall RADR recovery picture. With this knowledge, the RADR OIC and 
RADR Chiefs determine the best repair methods based on time, available re-
sources, and damage locations. Then, the volumetric mixer hoppers are loaded 
24                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
with the appropriate repair materials. After routes are cleared of debris and UXO, 
vehicles are moved from dispersal sites to a staging area in preparation for con-
voying to the repair sites. The Crater Chief then takes on-scene control of the 
RADR operation by briefing designated travel routes of vehicles, equipment, and 
personnel from dispersal sites; assigning tasks to the various Crater Repair Teams; 
and coordinating the efforts of the support teams (see Attachment 4 for recom-
mended convoy brief). A last check of equipment is made, and the UCC is notified 
that the RADR teams are ready to proceed. If the team can follow the same routes 
to the MOS as the ADATs used previously, most apparent UXO hazards on such 
routes will have already been identified and the potential for incurring unidenti-
fied blockages of preplanned routes due to damage and/or UXO should be notice-
ably reduced. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           25 
 
Chapter 4 
 
SMALL CRATER REPAIR PROCESS 
 
4.1. General Information. The small repair process is performed on repairs with 
dimensions 11 feet or less. Note:  See Chapter 5 for large crater repair procedures 
(repairs with at least one dimension greater than 11 feet). Task completion times 
are based on 8.5-foot square repairs 24 inches deep. The 8.5-foot square repair is 
a baseline and actual repair times will be +/- depending on crater size and depth. 
Performance data is being collected that will assist in more accurately determine 
expected repair times and will be published at a later date. 
 
4.2. Arrival at the Repair Zone. The assigned Crater Repair Team stops short of 
the first repair zone while the remainder of the convoy continues to subsequent 
repair zones. 
 
4.2.1. The Upheaval Marking Crew places a traffic cone on each corner of the 
repair zone’s leading edge. The Excavation, Backfill, and Capping Crews dis-
mount and conduct a post-attack reconnaissance sweep starting at the leading edge 
of the repair zone and proceed to the trailing edge where a traffic cone is placed 
on each corner of the repair zone’s trailing edge. Team members report remaining 
hazards (e.g., UXO, damaged utility lines, electrical circuits) to the Crater Repair 
Team Lead. 
 
4.2.2. If UXO mitigation is not complete within the repair zone, the post-attack 
reconnaissance sweep members stop short of the UXO Mitigation Team to ensure 
at least 250 feet of stand-off distance and place traffic cones at that location. If 
UXO mitigation is complete when the Debris Removal Crew has cleared debris 
from all craters between the leading and trailing set of cones, they dismount and 
complete the PAR sweep to the repair zone’s trailing edge and place trailing cones 
on the corners of the repair zone’s trailing edge. However, if UXO mitigation is 
still not complete within the repair zone, stop short of the UXO Mitigation Team 
to ensure at least 250 feet of stand-off distance and place traffic cones at that lo-
cation. Team members report any hazards to the Crater Repair Team Lead. 
 
26                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
4.3. Debris Removal. The two crew members clear debris from the repair zone. 
Debris removal begins immediately after the PAR sweep has proceeded at least 
250 feet beyond the first crater to be repaired. The goal is to remove debris around 
each crater within 1.5 minutes. Resources required for debris removal are listed 
in Table 4.1.

Note:  One Operators (usually 3E5) is identified as the Crew Lead 
 
4.3.1. Step 1. The crew works together to clear debris at least 15 feet from around 
each crater the first time through the repair zone. 
 
4.3.2. Step 2. Return to the first crater in the repair zone to push the previously 
cleared debris to at least 30-feet from the edge of the minimum operating strip 
(MOS) closest to the damage. Pile heights should not exceed 36 inches. 
 
4.3.3. Step 3. When the Excavation Crew begins on the first crater, debris removal 
operators begin pushing debris excavated from the crater to at least 30-feet from 
the edge of the MOS. The debris removal operators follow the Excavation Crew 
to each crater to remove excavated debris throughout the repair zone. 
 
4.3.4. Step 4. After excavated debris has been removed, operators continue to 
clear debris throughout the repair zone. 
 
4.3.5. Step 5. After the Capping Crew has capped the repair and achieved initial 
set, the Compact Track Loader (CTL) operator thoroughly cleans around the 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           27 
 
edges of each repair (CTL with buckets and/or brooms). Pay attention to slurry 
buildup at edges of the repair. Note:  If pavement breaking advances two or more 
craters beyond the excavation process, either the loader or CTL (depending on the 
crater size) begins removing broken pavement from the craters already hammered 
ahead of the excavator to accelerate the excavation process. Note:  If performing 
a crushed stone repair, the foreign object debris (FOD) cover construction/unfold-
ing area and temporary stockpile areas must also be cleared after debris has been 
cleared from around each crater. The FOD cover area should be approximately 
100 feet and the fill material stockpile a minimum of 30 feet from the crater. 
 
4.3.6. Step 6: Once all excavated debris has been removed, the Crater Repair 
Team Lead informs the Crater Chief that Debris Removal Crew has finished their 
primary task. If not needed elsewhere, the loader operator begins loading any 
available warehouse dump trucks with debris to be removed from the airfield and 
the CTL supports other crater repair activities as needed (e.g., cleaning spilled 
backfill and capping materials). If necessary, the work tool attachment may be 
changed to support other activities. 
 
4.4. Upheaval Determination and Marking. Upheaved pavement (Figure 4.1.) 
is not always easily visible; therefore, upheaval determination is accomplished 
through crater profile measurements (CPM) to ensure all damaged pavement is 
identified and removed. Unremoved upheaval will most likely fail under traffic 
and create FOD hazards. Conversely, removing more pavement than necessary 
increases repair times and uses more repair material than necessary, possibly de-
pleting repair material before all repairs are complete. Resources for upheaval 
determination are listed in Table 4.2. 
 
 
28                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023

Note:  It is imperative repair teams know the airfield’s pavement construction 
prior to an attack. This knowledge of the construction is used to make upheaval 
adjustment in order to avoid the load transfer dowel bars when possible. Adjust-
ments resulting in larger repairs require more repair materials; however, avoiding 
dowel bars results in faster repairs. The Crater Repair Team Lead determines 
whether to increase repair sizes to avoid dowels and when craters in proximity 
will be combined into a single repair. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           29 
 
Note:  The Logistics Chief continually compares quantities of on-hand repair ma-
terial to actual repair dimensions to project repair material shortages. As actual 
repair dimensions are determined by the Warehouse Leads and reported to the 
Crater Repair Team, the Crater Repair Team Leads may reduce repair dimensions 
where possible to avoid material shortages. The Logistics Chief may direct mate-
rial from a warehouse(s) with excess material to a warehouse(s) experiencing 
shortages. If material shortages cannot be avoided, employ methods to extend or 
use substitute material such as crushed stone as described in the backfill process 
(paragraph 4.7.). Equipment operators and Crater Profile Measurement Crew 
members work in close proximity. They must exercise extreme caution during 
upheaval measurement or serious injury or death to personnel could result. 
 
4.4.1. Use the following procedures when apparent crater size is less than 20 feet 
in diameter. Work from the crater centerline (oriented parallel to aircraft traffic) 
outward in one direction and then in the opposite direction. 
 
4.4.1.1. Step 1. Place profile measurement stanchions at least six paces from the 
crater lip on opposite sides of crater. Ensure the stanchions are placed on sound 
pavement (no upheaval), aligned along approximate crater centerline and parallel 
to aircraft traffic (Figure 4.2.). Remove debris from under stanchion feet and level 
aluminum sighting planes on top of each stanchion by centering bubble in level. 
 
4.4.1.2. Step 2. Place rod between stanchions with single target up. The Engineer-
ing technician stands approximately 2 paces behind stanchion and sights rod’s 
single target along upper edge of both stanchion sighting planes. 
 
4.4.1.3. Step 3. While keeping plumb, move sight rod every foot to measure up-
heaval along the line-of-sight between stanchions (Figure 4.2.). Start measure-
ments on obvious upheaval, moving away from the crater and toward stanchion.

Note:  In high winds, stanchions may overturn. Place heavy objects (e.g., sand-
bags) on stanchion feet. 
 
4.4.1.4. Step 4. When reaching the upheaval starting point (i.e., when the single 
triangular target drops below the line-of-sight across the top of the two stanchion 
rectangular sighting planes), clean the pavement and mark a spot 1 foot farther 
out from the rod with a lumber crayon from the tool trailer (Figure 4.3.). 
 
4.4.1.5. Step 5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 along same line-of-sight on opposite side 
of crater. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           31 
 
4.4.1.6. Step 6. Position both stanchions approximately 3 to 4 feet left or right of 
original line-of-sight and repeat Steps 2 through 5 (Figure 4.3.). Continue this 
procedure until far edge of crater upheaval on side selected has been reached.  
 
4.4.1.7. Step 7. Repeat step 6 on opposite half of crater until all upheaval has been 
identified.

Note:  If the triangle is more than two inches below the line-of-sight across the 
top of the two stanchions, there is a sunken slab, and the measurement continues 
until the triangle rises (this observation is indicative of a sloughing base material 
or could be caused by a camouflet). 
 
4.4.1.8. Step 8. Using push broom, sweep area clean between upheaval marks. 
Rather than marking the upheaval in the shape of the crater, square pavement cut 
lines by using outermost extents of the upheaval markings as shown in Figure 
4.3. Markings are placed parallel to the adjacent concrete slab joint (Figure 4.4.) 
or parallel and perpendicular to the path of traffic in asphalt (Figure 4.5.). Mark-
ing only the corners of the repair, in both directions, may be sufficient when using 
the pavement cutting alignment aids discussed in paragraphs 4.6.3.1. and 4.6.3.2.

with 1 and continuing in sequence up to 18 as each crater’s cut lines are marked.

4.4.2. The relative repair location drives five marking variations: 1 – crater cen-
tered on slab (Figure 4.6.), 2 – crater centered between two slabs on a joint 
(Figure 4.7.), 3 – slab close to a joint (Figure 4.8.), 4 – slabs with load transfer 
devices (Figure 4.9., Figure 4.10., and Figure 4.11.), and 5 – craters in close 
proximity (Figure 4.12.).

Note:  When cut lines are greater than 12 inches from the joint and repair material 
quantity is limited, use a walk-behind saw to cut the line across dowels and use 
the CTL and wheel saws to perform remaining cuts. Place cones at craters con-
taining dowels to notify the walk-behind saw operators that dowels are present.

Note:  If cut line is less than 12 inches from the joint, move cut line to the joint 
and use the walk-behind saw to cut across the dowels; use the CTL and wheel 
saws to perform remaining cuts. After marking cut lines measure length and width 
of cut lines and report results to the supporting Warehouse Lead. Place cones at 
craters containing dowels to notify the walk-behind saw operators that dowels are 
present. The joints are reestablished during the capping process.

Figure 4.12. Multiple Craters in Close Proximity. 
 
 
Note:  If distance between craters in close proximity prevents cutting with CTL 
and saw attachment, use walk-behind saw to cut two closest parallel sides of cra-
ters. When walk-behind saw cannot safely fit between two craters, create a single 
large repair. 
 
4.4.3. Once all upheaval has been determined and marked within the repair zone, 
the Crater Repair Team Lead informs the Crater Chief that Upheaval Marking 
Crew has finished their primary task. 
 
4.5. Pavement Cutting. Pavement cutting is the most critical step in the repair 
process regarding time. Proper pavement cutting creates efficiencies in the exca-
vation and capping processes. Removing more pavement than necessary may in-
crease time to complete the repair and may enlarge repairs to the extent to exhaust 
repair materials. Table 4.3. lists pavement-cutting resources.

4.5.1. Saw Attachment Descriptions. The CTL saw attachments come in 45-inch 
(SW345) and 60-inch (SW360) diameter blades. The 45-inch blade has a maxi-
mum cutting depth of 17 inches and the 60-inch blade cuts to a depth of 23 inches; 
the kerf of each blade is 3 inches wide. If pavement thickness is 17 inches or less, 
it is recommended to use the 45-inch blade for ease of operation. The wheel saw 
blade may be shifted side-to-side for alignment purposes. If the blade is shifted to 
either side to the extent that debris from the sawing process is in line with the CTL 
tracks, the spotter must remove the debris with a shovel before the CTL tracks 
reach the debris. 
 
Note:  If CTL is not fully enclosed and air-conditioned, the CLT operator is ex-
posed to silica dust and must wear a respirator found in drawer #1 in the RADR 
Tool Trailer. 
 
4.5.3. Process. The cutting speed of the wheel saw attachment in 18-inch-thick 
Portland Cement Concrete is approximately one foot per minute (time may be 
affected by concrete strength, aggregate hardness, or pavement thickness). Ac-
cordingly, the goal is to complete the pavement cutting process on an 8.5-ft x 8.5-
ft crater within 22 minutes in ideal conditions. The six-member crew is evenly 
divided into two sub crews (A and B) composed of two CTL operators and one 
spotter. The two sub crews work on separate craters simultaneously, finishing two 
repairs within 22 minutes, resulting in an overall average pavement cutting time 
of 11 minutes per repair (Figure 4.13.). The pavement cutting sub-crews start 
with CTLs facing each other on parallel sides of a marked repair. The pavement 
cutting steps are as follows: 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           39 
 
 
Figure 4.13. Pavement Cutting Process. 
 
 
4.5.3.1. Step 1:  The spotter positions the ground-target stand 16 inches beyond 
the end of the cut line when using the 45-inch blade, or 14 inches for the 60-inch 
blade, with flat end of the base towards the cut (Figure 4.14.). These measure-
ments result in an approximate 4-inch overcut when the front of the saw shroud 
contacts the ground-target. 
 
Figure 4.14. Pavement Cutting Alignment Aids. 
 
40                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
 
Note:  The alignment guides attached to the top of the saw attachment are 
mounted using magnetic bases and may move during sawing operations. Periodi-
cally, ensure the alignment aids have not moved, and if so, realign them to ensure 
a straight line is cut. If alignment aids continually move and become unaligned, 
use alternate methods to securely attach them to the saw attachments. 
 
Note:  It is imperative overcuts be kept to approximately four inches, anything 
less potentially adds time to break pavement from the repair corners. Conversely, 
overcuts longer than four inches add precious time to the cutting process, consume 
large quantities of rapid-set material to repair the overcuts, have the potential to 
cause FOD after repairing the overcut, and reduce the number of repairs that can 
be sawed before the conical cutting bits require replacement. 
 
4.5.3.2. Step 2:  The CTL operator aligns the alignment guides, connected to the 
top of the saw attachment, with the ground-target stand (Figure 4.14.) and lowers 
the cutting blade so it is level and approximately one inch above the pavement. 
 
Note:  The pavement cutting spotter is exposed to silica dust and must wear a 
respirator, found in drawer #1 in the RADR Tool Trailer, and suitable dust gog-
gles. 
 
4.5.3.3. Step 3:  The spotter guides the CTL operator to position the cutting wheel 
above the cut line to where an overcut of approximately four inches will occur. 
This best-practice is accomplished for the 45-inch wheel saw by aligning a mark 
placed 12 inches (14 inches for the 60-inch wheel saw) from the rear plate of the 
shroud with the start of the pavement cut line. The blade will travel slightly rear-
ward when lowering and should provide the four to five inch overcut at the start 
of each cut line. 
 
4.5.3.4. Step 4:  Set the cutting depth at the minimum position (the blade between 
6 and 8 inches below the skids). Lower the saw close to the ground so the full skid 
length is parallel to the ground surface. Do not try to lower the skids to the ground 
at this stage. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           41 
 
4.5.3.5. Step 5:  At low idle, activate the control for the drum rotation and contin-
uous flow. Gradually increase the engine speed to high idle. 
 
4.5.3.6. Step 6:  Slowly adjust the depth setting of the wheel saw to full depth. 
When full cutting depth is reached, move forward at a SLOW speed. Increase the 
forward speed until an optimum working speed is reached. The wheel may stall if 
traveling too fast. 
 
Note:  Keep the shroud in contact with the pavement while cutting. Failure to do 
so could cause debris (e.g., chunks of concrete) to be discharged from underneath 
the shroud causing injury to personnel. In addition, if the shroud is kept raised 
above the surface, any object unintentionally entering the shroud (e.g., shovel) 
may be launched by the rotating saw blade, which may cause injury to personnel. 
 
4.5.3.7. Step 7:  The operators cut in opposite directions on parallel cut lines 
(Figure 4.15.). On smaller craters the operator may need to side shift the cutting 
wheel towards the repair to create the necessary clearance for two CTLs to cut 
simultaneously. Spotters remove cutting debris that piles in front of the shrouds 
and CTL tracks.

Figure 4.15. Cutting Parallel Lines Simultaneously. 
 
 
Note:  The spotter must remove debris from the CTL’s shroud and track path. If 
the shroud and/or tracks of the CTL travel over debris the blade will rise and de-
crease the cutting depth and may cause a curved cut, which may cause the blade 
to bind. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           43 
 
4.5.3.8. Step 8:  The CTL operators stop the cutting process when the saw shroud 
contacts the alignment aids, which results in an overcut of approximately 4 inches. 
 
4.5.3.9. Step 9:  The CTL operators then reposition on the two remaining cut lines 
and make cuts in the same manner as described above. 
 
4.5.3.10. Step 10:  Upon completion of the final cuts, the CTL operators move 
(leapfrog) past the other pavement cutting crew to the next crater and wait to be 
lined up by the spotter as described above. 
 
4.5.3.11. Step 11:  After cuts are complete, the spotter measures the length and 
width of the repair and reports the measurements to the Crater Repair Team Lead 
who then reports the measurements to the Warehouse Lead (see AFTTP 3-32.18, 
Rapid Airfield Damage Repair-Warehouse Operations for information on RADR 
Warehouse Teams). 
 
4.5.3.12. Step 12:  This process continues until all craters (up to 18 feet) have been 
cut in the team’s repair zone. 
 
4.5.3.13. Step 13:  The Crater Repair Team Lead informs the Crater Chief when 
the Pavement Cutting Crew has finished its primary tasks so its members may be 
loaned to other crews/teams as necessary. 
 
4.5.3.14. If an edge is damaged during the cutting process, cut out additional dam-
age when greater than 24-inches or more than half the length of the slab. Other-
wise, complete the repair and treat the additional damage as a spall. 
 
4.5.3.15. When available, the Spall Repair Team should repair any overcuts. The 
capping material is removed from the overcut(s) and then repaired in the same 
manner as spalls described in Chapter 7. 
 
4.5.3.16. Spotters inspect the saw bits and saw wearing shoes after each side of a 
repair is cut to determine if the bits and/or shoes need replacing. If the CTL oper-
ators experience a decrease in cutting times, or if the blade begins to spark exces-
sively during the cutting process, the most likely cause is worn saw bits. At this 
44                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
point the spotter inspects the bits and, if necessary, directs the CTL operator to 
exchange the saw attachment with a spare from the attachment trailer. If saw at-
tachment replacement bits are needed, designated individuals should replace saw 
blade bits. Wing mobile vehicle maintenance personnel may assist as available. 
 
4.5.3.17. When cut lines fall within areas containing load transfer devices (i.e., 
dowels), use the walk-behind saw (Figure 4.16.) to cut the dowels. Task one 
member of the Spall Repair Crew to operate saw and, through the Crater Chief to 
the Logistics Chief, request one Warehouse dump truck operator to tow a water 
source for the saw. Walk-behind saw cutting speed will be significantly reduced 
when cutting through high strength concrete and alignment dowels.  
 
Note: Longitudinal joints on Runways and taxi ways usually contain dowels. The 
last three transverse joints on taxiways and aprons usually contain dowels.

4.6.2. Pavement Breaking. Pavement breaking (Figure 4.17.) can begin as soon 
as pavement cutting is complete on the first repair. The goal is to complete pave-
ment breaking within 10 minutes per crater. Note:  If the repair will have an as-
phalt cap, the Crater Repair Team Lead informs the Warehouse 1 Lead that pave-
ment breaking is about to commence. The Warehouse 1 Lead directs the support-
ing batch plant to begin batching operations to ensure asphalt is ready and avail-
able on the airfield when needed.

Figure 4.17. Excavator Performing Pavement Breaking. 
 
 
4.6.2.1. Step 1:  Break pavement into pieces suitable for buckets on excavating 
equipment. Note:  Depending on the length of the saw overcuts, the slab may not 
be free floating, and special attention should be paid to breaking the corners. 
 
4.6.2.2. Step 2:  When pavement has been suitably broken, the operator moves to 
the next available crater location to begin pavement breaking. Before moving to 
the next crater, use the breaker to remove at least two large pieces of debris out of 
the crater to ensure the excavator bucket can reach down in the crater to remove 
debris. Note:  When the operator excavating the repair is not keeping up, use the 
breaker attachment to flip-out as much of the broken material as possible until the 
operator excavating the repairs catches up.

4.6.2.3. Step 3:  Crater Repair Team Lead informs the Crater Chief when pave-
ment breaking has been completed on all repairs so personnel/vehicles may be 
loaned to other crews as necessary. 
 
4.6.3. Excavation. As soon as the pavement breaking is complete on the first re-
pair, the excavation team begins excavating the repair. The goal is to excavate 
each repair within 11 minutes. To aid the excavation process, lines are marked 24 
inches up the sides of the bucket when the bucket is sitting flat on the ground. The 
lines provide a visual reference for the spotter to guide the excavator operator 
(Figure 4.18.). The excavation sub-crew begins at the first crater where pavement 
breaking has been completed. Note:  The excavator spotter is exposed to silica 
dust and must wear a respirator found in drawer #1 in the RADR Tool Trailer. 
 
Figure 4.18. Excavator Bucket with 24-inch Reference Marks. 
 
 
4.6.3.1. Step 1:  Excavate repair with spotter guidance filling the bucket as much 
as possible to prevent delays in excavation. Attempt to make repair walls as ver-
tical as possible with bucket. Be careful not to damage pavement edges, especially 
asphalt surfaces. Note:  If base materials are sloughing to the point the adjacent 
slab is undercut, additional pavement may need to be removed. 
 
4.6.3.2. Step 2:  Place removed debris adjacent to the crater where it can be re-
moved by the debris removal crew.

4.6.3.3. Step 3:  Excavation is complete when reaching 24 inches (+/- 2 inches) in 
depth (even with the line on the bucket). The operator then proceeds to the next 
crater ready for excavation. 
 
4.6.3.4. Step 4:  The spotter cleans corners and vertical faces as necessary and 
levels the bottom of the excavation with a shovel. The spotter measures the di-
mensions of the excavation, including depth of the repair, and reports the meas-
urement to the Warehouse Lead. Finally, the spotter marks the backfill depth on 
the walls of the excavated repair with marking spray paint obtained during pre-
attack action and moves to the next crater. Note:  Proper backfill depth for a con-
crete cap is 10 inches below the surrounding pavement and 4 inches below the 
surrounding pavement for an asphalt cap. 
 
4.6.3.5. Step 5:  The Crater Repair Team Lead informs the Crater Chief when 
personnel have finished their tasks and may be loaned to other crews as necessary. 
 
4.7. Backfill. The RADR backfill process utilizes a flowable-fill product in place 
of traditional crushed stone. The flowable-fill is a medium strength, high viscos-
ity, excavatable, rapid-setting, cementitious backfill material. The material is 
packaged in 3,000-pound (approximately 1 cubic yard [CY]) super sacks and used 
beneath rapid-setting concrete or asphalt. Note:  Warehouse Leads report material 
quantities, usage, and shortages to the Logistics Chief to determine if materiel 
should be shared between warehouses or modify repair methods to extend flowa-
ble-fill usage. 
 
4.7.1. Backfill under Rapid-Set Concrete Cap. When the repair is capped with 
rapid-setting concrete, flowable-fill is placed using the dry placement technique 
commonly known as “slash and splash”. A 3,000-pound super sack of flowable-
fill is suspended over the excavated area, the bag is “slashed” releasing the mate-
rial into the repair and manually hand spread/leveled, then “splashed” with 50 
gallons of water before adding the next super sack. The goal to complete the “slash 
and splash” backfill method is no more than 11 minutes per crater. Table 4.5. 
identifies resources required for the backfill process under a rapid-set concrete 
cap.

4.7.1.1. The supporting warehouse determines and delivers the required repair 
material to the repair zone (see AFTTP 3-32.18). The warehouse telehandler op-
erator at the repair zone unloads super sacks from warehouse trailers at a location 
identified by the Crater Repair Team Lead. If the next loaded trailer has not ar-
rived at the repair zone by the time the previous trailer is unloaded, the warehouse 
telehandler operator may assist the repair team by placing the appropriate number 
of super sacks, identified by the Crater Repair Team Lead, diagonally from a re-
pair corner approximately 15 feet away (Figure 4.19.). This leaves room for pave-
ment cutting, breaking, and excavating processes if not already complete. Align 
super sack handles so the backfill crew telehandler forks can slide through both 
sacks without readjusting position. Figure 4.20. displays expected consumption 
of flowable-fill when used under a rapid-set concrete cap (14 inches of flowable-
fill). The table assumes the excavation depth is 2 feet (all dimensions are in feet).

4.7.1.2. Step 1:  Position the water truck at the repair area so it is out of the way 
of any repair operations. Connect a 1.5-inch by 50-foot hose with flow meter to 
the water truck (utilizing the flow meter ensures the proper amount of water is 
added for each super sack of material). Note:  Recommend water truck driver 
operate the water pump and monitor the flow meter to know when to stop adding 
water to the repair. Note:  If a flow meter is not available, time how long it takes 
for the water truck to fill a 55-gallon drum (from 4FWSR UTC). Add water at the 
same rate per super sack. 
 
4.7.1.3. Step 2:  The telehandler is guided to lift super sacks by the spotter. The 
operator lifts the super sack(s) (10K telehandlers are capable of lifting two bags 
simultaneously, but only empty one sack at a time) from near side of the repair 
and suspends it just inside the repair edge to allow the spotter to “slash” the super

sack on the two sides parallel to the forks to help spread the material (Figure 
4.21.). Remove any sack remnants that may fall into the repair. Note:  Individuals 
slashing the flowable-fill bags, and anyone in close vicinity to the airborne dust, 
must wear a respirator from Drawer #1 in the RADR Tool Trailer, and eye pro-
tection.

4.7.1.4. Step 3:  When the super sack is slashed, the spotter directs the forklift 
operator to repeatedly boom in and out to provide an even placement of material. 
Spotters assist with spreading and leveling the material. 
 
4.7.1.5. Step 4:  While the first super sack is emptied, the water truck operator 
dispenses (splashes) 50 gallons of water in the repair as the super sack is being 
emptied (Figure 4.22.). Spray water into the flowable-fill in a manner to fully 
hydrate the flowable-fill while it is being added. Use the spray from the hose to 
level the backfill as much as possible to reduce the amount of manual effort re-
quired to level the backfill. Allow water to percolate through the dry material layer 
until little surface water is apparent. 
 
Figure 4.22. Adding Water to Flowable-Fill. 
 
 
4.7.1.6. Step 5:  Once the proper amount of water has been added, the spotters 
immediately level the surface of the backfill with rakes/shovels.

4.7.1.7. Step 6:  Repeat this process as each super sack is added until reaching the 
backfill mark (Figure 4.23.) made by the excavation team (10 inches from the 
surrounding pavement surface). 
 
Figure 4.23. Backfill Complete. 
 
 
Note:  As each sack is emptied, the spotter pushes the empty bag to the rear of the 
forks. The forklift operator places empty bags in a designated trash collection area 
on the way to retrieving super sacks for the next repair. 
 
Note:  Each super sack will raise the level of fill in an 8.5’ x 8.5’ repair by ap-
proximately 5 inches. If the repair does not require a full super sack of material 
before reaching the proper backfill height, slash the bag at approximately one 
quarter from the top of the sack to control the amount of material dispensed. If 
more material is still required, slash the sack again halfway down. When the back-
fill, material reaches its proper height, adjust the water being added according to 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           55 
 
the estimated amount of material added from the partial sack (e.g., only add 25 
gallons if only half of a sack was used). Use remaining super sack material in the 
next repair. 
 
4.7.1.8. Step 7:  Crater Repair Team Lead informs the Crater Chief when person-
nel have finished their primary tasks so that they may be loaned to other crews as 
necessary. 
 
4.7.2. Backfill under Asphalt Cap. The process for backfilling beneath an asphalt 
cap is accomplished with a wet placement technique utilizing the volumetric 
mixer (Figure 4.24.). The goal to complete the wet placed backfill method is ex-
pected to be no more than 14 minutes per repair. The process uses 70 gallons of 
water per flowable-fill super sack. Table 4.6. identifies the Volumetric Mixer 
Crew resources required for backfilling a repair capped with asphalt.

when used under an asphalt cap (20 inches of flowable-fill). The table assumes 
the excavation depth is 2 feet (all dimensions are in feet). 
 
4.7.2.1.1. Step 1:  Position the water truck and volumetric mixer (pulled by dump 
truck w/water skid) at repair area without interfering with repair operations. Note:  
Stop dump truck and volumetric mixer parallel to the MOS centerline to prevent 
the need to back the volumetric mixer and/or clog traffic lanes.

Note:  The warehouse telehandler operator at the repair zone unloads super sacks 
from warehouse trailers and places them in a designated location identified by the 
Crater Repair Team Lead. If the next loaded trailer has not arrived at the repair 
zone by the time the previous trailer is unloaded, the warehouse telehandler oper-
ator may assist the telehandler that loads the volumetric mixer by placing the ap-
propriate number of super sacks, identified by the Crater Repair Team Lead, near 
the volumetric mixer.  
 
Note:  Some super sacks are lined with foil. To prevent foil liners from tearing 
and dropping into the mixer, gently lower sack straight down onto the mixer’s bag 
breakers to make a small cut in the sack. Raise the sack straight up until sack is 
clear of the spike and shake the sack (with the forklift controls) until sack is emp-
tied. Remove any pieces of foil liner that may fall into the mixer.

4.7.2.1.3. Step 3:  Crater Repair Team Lead informs the Crater Chief when per-
sonnel have finished their tasks so they may assist others as necessary. Note:  The 
volumetric mixer requires periodic cleaning during operation. Failure to perform 
periodic cleaning will result in operational failure. The volumetric mixer has an 
onboard pressure washing system. Citric acid may be added to the washout tank 
in case of mixer malfunction. For example, if the water pump malfunctions there 
will be dry material to remove from the auger. Adding citric acid to the water in 
the washout tank will allow more time for cleanup when using water from the 
washout tank to remove the dry material. 
 
4.8. Capping Repair. Capping is accomplished with either asphalt or rapid-set 
concrete. Capping material should match the in-situ material, but when material

is short, mix-matching capping material and in situ material is allowable (e.g., 
rapid-set concrete may be used to cap a repair on an asphalt surface and vice-
versa; however, life of the repairs may be diminished). Capping begins once the 
backfill material (using the “slash and splash” method) achieves an initial set of 
15 minutes when capping with concrete and 30 minutes when capping with as-
phalt (wet flowable-fill placement). Ensure no water sheen is on the backfill sur-
face and it has set enough to support foot traffic (leaves no footprints). 
 
4.8.1. Rapid-Set Concrete Cap. A rapid-set concrete cap is placed using the volu-
metric mixer and a rapid-setting concrete mix. The rapid-setting concrete is pack-
aged in 3,000-pound (approximately 1 CY) super sacks. The water to rapid-set 
material ratio is approximately 50 gallons of water to one (1) super sack. The 
rapid-setting concrete material has an initial set time of 45 minutes (at which time 
will support a 2.5-ton vehicle) and a fully operational cure time of two hours. 
Table 4.7. identifies resources required to place a rapid-set concrete cap.

4.8.1.1. Before placing rapid-setting concrete, the flowable-fill backfill “slash and 
splash” method requires 15 minutes to achieve initial set. The goal to place the 
rapid-set concrete is expected to be no more than 11 minutes per repair (Figure 
4.27.). Figure 4.28. shows the expected consumption of rapid-set when placing a 
10-inch thick cap. The table assumes the excavation depth is two feet (all dimen-
sions are in feet).  
 
Note:  Stop dump truck and volumetric mixer parallel to the MOS centerline to 
prevent the need to back the volumetric mixer and/or clog traffic lanes.  
 
Note:  After positioning the volumetric mixer, the helper and water truck opera-
tors keep the mixer stocked with dry material, water, and admixtures.  
 
Note:  Individuals on the mixer catwalk assisting with loading the volumetric 
mixer, and anyone in close vicinity to the airborne dust, must wear a respirator 
from Drawer #1 in the RADR Tool Trailer, and eye protection.  
 
Note:  Some super sacks are lined with foil. To prevent foil liners from tearing 
and dropping into the mixer, gently lower sack straight down onto the mixer’s bag 
breakers to make a small cut in the sack. Raise the sack straight up until sack is 
clear of the spike and shake the sack (with the forklift controls) until sack is emp-
tied. Remove any pieces of foil liner that may fall into the mixer.

4.8.1.2. Step 1:  Position the water truck and dump truck/volumetric mixer at a 
convenient location near the repair area, but not in the way of repair activities.  
 
Note:  The warehouse telehandler operator at the repair zone unloads super sacks 
from warehouse trailers and places them in a designated location identified by the 
Crater Repair Team Lead. If the next loaded trailer has not arrived at the repair 
zone by the time the previous trailer is unloaded, the warehouse telehandler oper-
ator may assist the repair team by placing the appropriate number of super sacks, 
identified by the Crater Repair Team Lead, near the volumetric mixer. 
 
4.8.1.3. Step 2:  The mixer operator ensures controls are set to rapid-set concrete 
and required admixtures are on-board (see paragraph 7.2.1. for suggested admix-
ture dosage). The mixer operator directs placement of the rapid-set by swinging

the mixer chute and by having the dump truck operator pull forward or backward 
as needed. The mix has a very high slump (very fluid) compared to the typical 
four or five slump used for most slabs. The mix consistency will appear to be 
similar to a slurry, but not quite as fluid as the wet flowable fill mix (Figure 4.26.). 
 
Note:  The volumetric mixer requires periodic cleaning. Failure to periodically 
clean the mixer will result in operational failure. Citric acid may be added to the 
washout tank in case of mixer malfunction. For example, if the water pump mal-
functions there will be dry material to remove from the auger. Adding citric acid 
to the water in the washout tank allows more time for cleanup when using water 
from the washout tank to remove the dry material. Cleaning details are provided 
in the operator’s manual. 
Note:  If temperature is 75°F or above, retardant admixture is required to extend 
material working time (see Table 7.1.). Mix citric acid with a small amount of 
water until it becomes a slurry before adding to the mix water tanks. 
 
Note:  The quality of material placed in overcuts is very important. Ensure over-
cuts are filled while the cap is placed. A strong FOD potential exists if slurry fills 
overcuts before being packed with rapid-set. 
 
Note:  When a repair crosses a runway crown, a joint must be established at the 
peak of the crown to achieve the proper slope on each side of the crown. 
 
Note:  Perform steps in Attachment 4 if rapid-set concrete sets-up on the auger 
and requires emergency swap out (wear proper personal protective equipment and 
be aware of pinch points around locking pins/plates near mixing well). 
 
4.8.1.4. Step 3:  The volumetric mixer/dump truck, water truck, and telehandler 
forklift move to the next crater as soon as the repair is filled with capping material. 
 
4.8.1.5. Step 4:  Three remaining personnel finish the crater with the power screed 
(Figure 4.29.). Ensure screed does not ride on excess material at the repair edges.

Figure 4.29. Finishing Cap with Power Screed. 
 
 
Note:  Do not perform wet finishing, as described in the CTS Rapid Set specifi-
cation sheet, during rapid crater repair. Small unfinished areas after screeding may 
be expeditiously touched up by hand. 
 
4.8.1.6. Step 5:  The Debris Removal Crew thoroughly cleans around repairs after 
the initial set (CTL with buckets and/or brooms). Pay particular attention to slurry 
buildup at edges of the repair. 
 
4.8.1.7. Step 6:  Perform Repair Quality Criteria checks by conducting line-of-
sight profile measurements as described in T.O. 35E2-5-1, Crushed-Stone Crater 
Repair and Line-Of-Sight Profile Measurement for Rapid Runway Repair, and 
report results up the chain to the Civil Engineer Unit Control Center (CE-UCC). 
In addition to taking measurements in the center of the repair, also take measure-
ments at the joints. 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           65 
 
 
4.8.1.8. Step 7:  Crater Repair Team Lead records completion time of each cap. 
 
Note:  A rapid-set concrete repair has an initial set time of 45 minutes in fair 
weather (i.e., ambient temperature above 45ºF and not raining) and is capable of 
supporting a 2.5-ton vehicle for paint striping and FOD removal operations. As 
the caps reach the initial set time, the Crater Repair Team Lead directs one of the 
team members to move the repair zone marking cones. This signals the Striping 
Crew and FOD Removal Team the work area is open for striping and sweeping. 
Full cure time for aircraft traffic is two (2) hours. 
 
Note:  Pavement must be dry before pavement striping begins. 
 
4.8.1.9. Step 8:  Crater Repair Team Lead informs the Crater Chief when person-
nel have finished their tasks so they may be loaned to other crews as necessary. 
 
4.8.2. Asphalt Cap. The asphalt cap is placed at a compacted thickness of four (4) 
inches with asphalt produced by the asphalt recyclers. The wet placed flowable-
fill backfill method requires 30 minutes to achieve initial set before the asphalt is 
placed. The goal to place asphalt is expected to be no more than 11 minutes and 
30 seconds, with an additional 11 minutes and 30 seconds for compaction. Table 
4.8. identifies resources required for the asphalt cap. Table 4.9. shows the ex-
pected consumption rate of asphalt when placing a 4-inch-thick cap. The table 
assumes the excavation depth is two feet (all dimensions are in feet).

Note:  As soon as the first repair has been backfilled, the Crater Repair Team 
Lead requests the Warehouse 1 Lead to send the first load of asphalt. At this time 
the warehouse dispatches a loaded dump truck to the supported repair team’s lo-
cation. The Crater Repair Team Lead communicates with the Warehouse 1 Lead 
to schedule future asphalt deliveries.

4.8.2.1. Step 1:  When asphalt arrives at the repair location, a helper checks the 
asphalt temperature with the temperature gun located in drawer 3 of the compo-
nent trailer, to ensure it is 280°F or greater as required for break-down rolling. If 
below 280°F return the load for reprocessing and call for another load. The driver 
should be directed where to dump asphalt by the Crater Repair Team Lead. 
 
4.8.2.2. Step 2:  The front-end loader operator places the proper amount of asphalt 
in the repair under the direction of a spotter (Figure 4.30.). The loader operator 
then screeds the un-compacted material leaving approximately 1.5-inch, ± 0.25-
inch of asphalt above surrounding pavement. 
 
Figure 4.30. Loader Screeding Asphalt Cap. 
 
 
Note:  The front-end loader screeds the crater cap as long as the wheels of the 
loader are not placed on the un-compacted asphalt. If the repair is too wide for the 
loader, the asphalt is placed and rough leveled with the front-end loader and fin-
ished with a CTL and bucket and/or by hand with lutes.

4.8.2.3. Step 3:  During placement and screeding of the asphalt, helpers assist with 
placing, cleaning, and preparing edges using lutes and/or square shovels. 
 
4.8.2.4. Step 4:  The cap is rolled with the steel-wheel roller parallel to the crown 
of the runway, assisted by a spotter who monitors asphalt temperature and cleans 
the edges. Conduct rolling as follows: 
 
a. 
0.5 pass (longitudinal with crown of runway) with steel-wheel roller, no 
vibration (asphalt temperature should be 280°F or greater). 
 
b. 2.5 passes (longitudinal with crown of runway) with steel-wheel roller, 
vibration on (asphalt temperature should be 150°F or greater). 
 
c. 
2 passes (longitudinal with crown of runway) with pneumatic roller. 
 
d. 3 passes with steel-wheel roller, no vibration. 
 
e. 
Between passes, the helper trims any excess asphalt from edges with a 
square head shovel. This process is repeated until all caps are complete. 
 
Note:  A pass is equal to traveling across the repair and then returning to the 
original starting position. Perform each pass across entire width of the repair by 
overlapping the previous pass by approximately 12 inches until the entire repair 
cap has received the pass. 
 
Note:  If check cracking is noted in the mat or if there is evidence of chipping of 
concrete edges, grooves, or joints, turn off vibration and add an additional half 
pass for step “a” and decrease step “b” to 2 passes. 
 
Note:  The asphalt cap should be no hotter than 150°F before receiving vehicle 
traffic (2.5-ton vehicle for FOD removal or striping), and no hotter than 125°F (or 
no hotter than the surrounding pavement when it is 125°F or hotter) before receiv-
ing aircraft traffic. The average time for asphalt to cool to 150°F is two (2) hours, 
but times vary depending on environmental conditions. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           69 
 
Note:  Experiments have shown smaller asphalt repairs (8.5-foot square to 12-
foot square) do not necessarily require the pneumatic roller passes to achieve sat-
isfactory asphalt density. If time is an issue, the pneumatic roller passes may be 
skipped. 
 
4.8.2.5. Step 5:  Thoroughly clean around edges of repair to remove excess asphalt 
and debris. 
 
4.8.2.6. Step 6:  The natural cooling process takes approximately 2 hours to bring 
asphalt temperature to 150°F (depending on environmental conditions). To reduce 
cooling time, the water truck operator may flood the last 5 repairs with water. The 
repairs are repeatedly flooded whenever the asphalt begins to develop dry areas. 
The water truck operator should flood a repair briefly and move to the next repair 
alternating between repairs as required. The repairs are ready for vehicle traffic 
when asphalt temperature reaches 150°F, or less. At this time the water truck op-
erator removes the cones identifying the repair zone, which signals the Striping 
Crew and FOD Team the work area is open. The repair is ready to receive aircraft 
traffic when the asphalt temperature falls to 125°F, or is no hotter than the sur-
rounding pavement when it is 125°F or hotter. 
 
Note:  The pavement must be dry before pavement striping begins. 
 
4.8.2.7. Step 7:  Perform RQC checks as described in T.O. 35E2-5-1, Crushed-
Stone Crater Repair and Line-Of-Sight Profile Measurement for Rapid Runway 
Repair, and report results up the chain to the CE-UCC. 
 
4.8.2.8. The Crater Repair Team Lead informs the Crater Chief when personnel 
have finished their tasks so they may be loaned to other crews as necessary.

Chapter 5 
 
LARGE REPAIR PROCESS 
 
5.1. Introduction. When any transverse side (perpendicular to the centerline) of 
a repair is longer than 11-feet, the large repair process described in this chapter is 
used. These procedures are predicated on tools and equipment in the Rapid Air-
field Damage Repair (RADR) tool trailer (Table A2.2.). Paving lane widths 
should not exceed 11 feet to keep the repair manageable when using rapid-setting 
concrete, and because the screed in the tool trailer is only 12 feet long. Identify 
extent of upheaval as described in T.O. 35E2-5-1, Crushed-Stone Crater Repair 
and Line-Of-Sight Profile Measurement for Rapid Runway Repair, for craters 
with an apparent size of 20 feet in diameter or larger. The debris removal and 
upheaval marking processes are performed in the same manner as the small repair; 
the modifications to the remaining processes (e.g., pavement cutting, excavation, 
backfill, and capping) are explained below. After debris is removed and upheaval 
marked, perform the following processes. 
 
Note:  Be familiar with small crater repair processes as described in Chapter 4 
before beginning large crater repair. 
 
Note:  Large repair processes may result in some crater repair team members be-
ing idle for long periods of time. In these instances, the team lead should direct 
those individuals to assist with other tasks. 
 
5.2. Pavement Cutting. The pavement cutting process is modified when the re-
pair is large enough to safely use four Compact Track Loaders (CTL) simultane-
ously to cut pavement around a single large repair (approximately 15-ft x 15-ft or 
larger). In other words, each CTL cuts one of the four repair sides simultaneously 
(Figure 5.1.). 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           71 
 
 
Figure 5.1. Pavement Cutting Four Sides of Large Repair Simultaneously. 
 
 
5.3. Breaking and Excavation. There are two modifications when excavating a 
large repair: (1) Breaking and excavating may take place simultaneously when the 
repair is approximately 10-ft x 10-ft or larger. (2) Depth of excavation depends 
on the depth of disturbed subgrade material. The spotter informs the excavator 
operator when proper depth has been reached. Figure 5.2. shows pavement break-
ing and excavating taking place simultaneously; the Debris Removal Crew (CTL 
and loader) is clearing excavated material away from the repair.

5.4. Backfill. Backfill may be accomplished with flowable-fill and/or crushed 
stone material. 
 
5.4.1. Flowable Fill. The Backfill Crew may add one individual (forklift operator) 
when repairs are 15-ft x 15-ft or larger for a total of six members (Table 5.1.). If 
one of the RADR warehouses is located on semi-improved surfaces, its warehouse 
forklift may be transferred to the repair team, or when a capping team is not plac-
ing an asphalt cap its loader may be used with a fork attachment.

5.4.1.1. Step 1:  Using a telehandler (an additional forklift when the repair is 15-
ft by 15-ft or larger), dispense dry flowable fill using the “slash and splash” 
method, as described in paragraph 7.1.2.1.2. directly into the excavation in 4-to-
6-inch lifts (Figure 5.3.). Extend and retract the boom to help evenly spread ma-
terial throughout the repair.

Figure 5.3. Dry Flowable Fill Placement. 
 
 
5.4.1.2. Step 2:  Two helpers (or three when repair is 15-ft x 15-ft or larger) use 
hand tools to evenly spread/level backfill material as it is placed in the repair. 
 
5.4.1.3. Step 3:  The water truck operator adds 50 gallons of water per sack as the 
sacks are emptied and allows it to percolate through the dry material layer until 
little surface water is apparent (Figure 5.4.). The stream of water may be directed 
to assist with distributing repair material within the repair. 
 
5.4.1.4. Step 4:  Repeat process until backfill is 10 inches below parent slab. 
 
5.4.2. Crushed Stone. See Table 5.2. for crushed stone backfill resources. One 
Operator compacts the crushed stone backfill. In addition, the backfill crew may 
use a loader, operated by the other helper, to assist with leveling the crushed stone 
backfill.

Note:  When using the CTL’s roller attachment for compacting crushed stone, 
lifts should be no thicker than 3 inches. Lifts may be 4 to 6 inches if an excavator 
with a compactor plate attachment is used. 
 
5.4.2.1. If flowable fill material is close to being exhausted, crushed stone may be 
used to extend the flowable fill by using three to six inches of crushed stone in the 
bottom of the repair and the remaining eight to 11 inches backfilled with flowable 
fill or use the remaining flowable fill to backfill repairs in the aircraft’s wheel path 
and crushed stone to backfill repairs under the wings. If all flowable fill is ex-
hausted before completing all repairs, use crushed stone to backfill the entire 14 
inches in accordance with T.O. 35E2-5-1, Crushed-Stone Crater Repair and Line-
Of-Sight Profile Measurement for Rapid Runway Repair, and the following guid-
ance. 
 
5.4.2.2. Step 1:  After the repair has been excavated, The Backfill Crew helpers 
assist with leveling the subgrade (soil) using rakes and shovels. If the repair is 15-
ft x 15-ft or larger, a loader or CTL may be required to assist with leveling the 
subgrade material. 
 
5.4.2.3. Step 2:  Geotextile fabric (stored in tool trailer) is placed in the bottom of 
the repair to separate the underlying soil from the crushed stone backfill (Figure 
5.5.). If one sheet does not cover the entire excavated area, use two sheets, and 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           75 
 
overlap the first sheet by one foot. Remove excess fabric or fold over into the 
repair. 
 
Figure 5.4. Placing Geotextile Fabric. 
 
 
5.4.2.4. Step 3:  Warehouse dump trucks begin dumping crushed stone into the 
excavation. When the repair is 15-ft x 15-ft or larger, dump trucks distribute ma-
terial around the repair as much as possible by dumping a partial load in one lo-
cation, lowering the bed, and then moving to another location to dump more ma-
terial until the proper lift thickness is obtained for compaction. 
 
5.4.2.5. Step 4:  The Backfill Crew helpers assist with leveling the backfill to the 
appropriate lift thickness using rakes and shovels. If the repair is 15-ft x 15-ft or 
larger, a loader or CTL may be required to assist with leveling the backfill mate-
rial. 
 
5.4.2.6. Step 5:  Once the backfill lift is somewhat level and of the proper thick-
ness for the compaction method, begin compaction with either a CTL with roller 
attachment (Figure 5.6.) or excavator with plate compactor attachment (Figure 
5.7.). A helper uses the walk-behind plate compactor (Figure 5.7.) from the tool 
trailer to compact the subgrade around the walls and corners of the excavation.

Make several passes with compactor until no loose pockets of material are appar-
ent. Continue placing and compacting material in 3-inch lifts until reaching 10 
inches below parent slab (Figure 5.9.).

5.5.1.1. Due to the nature of rapid-setting concrete, two helpers install plastic con-
crete forms to divide the repair into manageable sections before the concrete be-
gins to setup. Repairs should be divided similar to those illustrated in Figure 5.9. 
when the only screed available is the 12-ft screed from the RADR Tool Trailer. 
Regardless of screed length, the largest dimension of a formed section should be 
no greater than 15 feet to prevent the rapid-set concrete from prematurely curing 
before finishing the placement of concrete. In addition, a 15-ft x 15-ft repair or 
smaller should reach its goal of 3,000 passes. 
 
Figure 5.9. Dividing Large Repairs for Multiple Pours with 12-ft Screed. 
 
 
Note:  When a repair crosses a runway crown, a joint must be established at the 
peak of the crown to achieve the proper slope on each side of the crown. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           81 
 
Note:  Begin placing concrete on low end of each paving lane. 
 
5.5.1.2. Place concrete in either all shaded or all unshaded sections in Figure 5.9. 
first. After curing enough to walk on without leaving footprints, remove forms 
and place concrete in the remaining sections (the sections of the opposite shading 
convention). 
 
5.5.1.3. Step 1:  Once the excavation is complete (before backfilling begins) help-
ers begin cutting the plastic concrete forms to proper length using a reciprocating 
saw (Figure 5.10.). Use stacking accessory (Figure 5.11.) to stack two 4-inch-tall 
forms. 
 
Note:  An 8-inch-tall form is desired for the 10-inch concrete cap to prevent the 
form from protruding above the surrounding parent slab if the backfill was placed 
too high. 
 
5.5.1.4. Step 2:  Place stacked forms on top of the backfill after the 15-minute 
initial set of flowable-fill. Hammer form pins (Figure 5.12.) through stacking 
pockets.

5.5.1.6. Step 4:  If temperature is 75°F or higher, add citric acid, in anhydrous 
powder form, to the volumetric mixer’s mix water tanks as identified in Table 
84                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
7.1. to increase the working time of the Rapid Set concrete. See paragraph 7.2. 
for citric acid mixing. 
 
Note:  Mix citric acid with a small amount of water until it becomes a slurry 
before adding to the mix water tanks. 
 
5.5.1.7. Step 5:  Forms may need to be reused; therefore, spray release agent on 
form faces and bottom grooves on backside of the forms. Release agent can be 
found in the RADR tool trailer. 
 
Note:  Stop dump truck and volumetric mixer parallel to the minimum operating 
strip (MOS) centerline to prevent the need to back the volumetric mixer and/or 
clog traffic lanes. 
 
5.5.1.8. Step 6:  Fill the first formed section with Rapid Set concrete (Figure 
5.14.). Finish the rapid-setting concrete cap with a screed bar and hand tools 
(Figure 5.15.). Only minimal finishing of the repair using hand tools is required.

Note:  Do not perform wet finishing, as described in the CTS Rapid Set specifi-
cation sheet, during rapid crater repair. Small, unfinished areas after screeding 
may be expeditiously touched up by hand. 
 
5.5.1.9. Step 7:  Fill the quadrant diagonally across from the quadrant just placed 
(labeled “Fill this quadrant next” in Figure 5.15.) and minimally finish with 
screed and hand tools. 
 
5.5.1.10. Step 8:  Once the first two quadrants have cured enough to walk on 
without leaving footprints, remove plastic forms and attach expansion board ma-
terial to the side of concrete slabs to create a joint between all four of the slabs. 
 
5.5.1.11. Step 9:  Fill the remaining two quadrants with Rapid Set concrete and 
minimally finish with hand tools. 
 
Note:  Individuals on the mixer catwalk assisting with loading the volumetric 
mixer, and anyone in close vicinity to the airborne dust, should wear a respirator 
from Drawer #1 in the RADR Tool Trailer, and eye protection. 
 
Note:  Perform steps in Attachment 4 if rapid-set concrete sets-up on the auger 
and requires emergency swap out (wear proper personal protective equipment and 
be aware of pinch points around locking pins/plates near mixing well).

Chapter 7 
 
CRATER REPAIR IN EXTREME CONDITIONS 
 
7.1. Rainy or Humid Conditions. 
 
7.1.1. Rapid-Set Concrete Cap Repair. Perform the rapid-set concrete repair from 
debris removal through the excavation process in the same manner as described 
in Chapters 4 and 5. 
 
Note:  Lumber crayons (in place of paint or other marking media) in the RADR 
trailer should be used when marking upheaval to prevent the marks from being 
washed away by the wet conditions. 
 
7.1.1.1. Backfill. Attempt to remove as much water as possible from the repair 
before backfilling. This can be accomplished during the excavation process by 
scooping as much water out of the repair with the excavator bucket and then re-
moving as much of the remaining water with the water pump from the RADR 
Tool Trailer. If the bottom of the repair still has standing water, or the soil is 
saturated, place just enough dry flowable-fill in the bottom of the repair to soak 
up the remaining moisture. Then, backfill the repair in the same manner as de-
scribed in paragraph 4.7. After the repair has been backfilled to the proper depth 
(i.e., 10 inches below the surrounding pavement) perform the water mitigation 
procedures. 
 
7.1.1.2. Water Mitigation Procedures. Once each repair has been backfilled to 
proper height, the Spall Repair Crew employs the Inclement Weather Kit compo-
nents (Table A2.3.) to keep water out of each repair during the 15 minute backfill 
cure time (after all repairs have been capped, the Spall Repair Crew begins spall 
repair process with help from other repair crews). Figure 7.1. illustrates compo-
nent of water mitigation to include optional urethane spill dikes that may be used 
to robust the configuration. 
 
Note:  Place cone under the center of the tarp to prevent water pooling on the tarp. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           89 
 
Note:  Use dry sand in the chalk-box to place the sand berm. When dry sand is 
not available use alternate methods (e.g., water hose, pigs, urethane spill dikes). 
 
Figure 7.1. Water Mitigation Kit Components Employed. 
 
 
7.1.1.3. Capping the Repair. The volumetric mixer must be loaded under cover 
and then covered during transport to prevent rain from entering the hopper. Travel 
time from the covered area to the airfield will most likely require the spare volu-
metric mixer to be put into a rotational delivery of capping material along with 
the primary mixer to reduce time between deliveries. Perform the following steps 
to cap the repair in wet weather: 
 
7.1.1.3.1. Step 1:  While under cover, load the volumetric mixers with 6 super-
sacks of rapid-set material and cover the hoppers with the onboard tarps or alumi-
num covers. Secure the tarps so they do not blow off during transport. 
 
90                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
7.1.1.3.2. Step 2:  When the first volumetric mixer arrives at the first repair (and 
after the 15 minutes backfill material cure time has elapsed), use blowers from the 
RADR Tool Trailer to remove water from the tarp and then remove the tarp by 
folding the tarp from the low side of the repair towards the high side without dis-
turbing the sand berm and water hose. 
 
7.1.1.3.3. Step 3:  Use blowers to blow any water from the repair before placing 
capping material. Fuel cans may be obtained from the RADR Tool Trailer to store 
fuel for the blowers. Two-cycle oil should be acquired during pre-attack actions. 
 
7.1.1.3.4. Step 4:  Start the volumetric mixer and begin placing capping material 
in the repair as described in Chapter 4. When material has been exhausted, the 
volumetric mixer is returned to the covered area to be reloaded with repair mate-
rial. The second loaded volumetric mixer should be at the repair site when the first 
volumetric mixer departs to the covered area for replenishment. Continue placing 
capping material from the second volumetric mixer for the remaining repairs and 
repeat this process until all repairs have been capped. 
 
7.1.1.3.5. Step 5:  After using the screed on the cap, cover the repair with the tarp 
throughout the 45-minute initial cap cure time. 
 
7.1.1.3.6. Step 6:  Repeat the process for the remaining repairs and remove the 
tarps from each repair after the initial 45-minute cure time. 
 
Note:  Perform steps in Attachment 4 if rapid-set concrete sets-up on the auger 
and requires emergency swap out (wear proper personal protective equipment and 
be aware of pinch points around locking pins/plates near mixing well). 
 
7.1.2. Asphalt Cap Repair. Wet-weather conditions may have a negative impact 
when placing a hot-mix asphalt (HMA) cap. Water mitigation measures must be 
employed to keep as much water as possible off the repair after backfilling is 
complete. In addition, HMA storage and transport methods must be altered to pre-
vent the HMA cooling below minimum placement temperatures. Repair proce-
dures are the same as during fair-weather conditions until the repair has been ex-
cavated; however, lumber crayons (in place of paint or other marking media) in 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           91 
 
the RADR trailer must be used when marking upheaval to prevent the marks from 
being washed away by the wet conditions. Perform the following procedures 
when an HMA cap is placed in wet weather. 
 
7.1.2.1. Backfill. Attempt to remove as much water as possible from the repair 
before backfilling. This can be accomplished during the excavation process by 
scooping as much water out of the repair with the excavator bucket and then re-
moving as much of the remaining water with the water pump from the RADR 
Tool Trailer. If the bottom of the repair still has standing water, or the soil is 
saturated, place just enough dry flowable-fill in the bottom of the repair to soak 
up the remaining moisture. Two options exist to place backfill in wet weather: 
volumetric mixers with covers installed, or the “slash and splash” method as de-
scribed in the fair-weather backfill procedures under a rapid-set concrete cap. 
 
7.1.2.1.1. Volumetric Mixer Backfill Method. Fill hoppers under cover and then 
extend the on-board cover over hoppers before leaving overhead cover. Load mix-
ers on a rotational basis using the spare volumetric mixer per team.  Then, follow 
procedures described in Chapter 4. After backfilling the repair, immediately 
begin water mitigation procedures described in paragraph 7.1.1.2. 
 
7.1.2.1.2. “Slash and Splash” Backfill Method. This is a stop-gap measure only to 
be used during wet weather; repairs will not be of the same quality and are not 
likely to last as long as when using the volumetric mixer during backfill. Follow 
procedures described in paragraph 4.7.1. when using this method. The only de-
viation is to backfill the repair until backfill reaches 4 inches below parent slab 
surface. When complete, immediately begin water mitigation procedures de-
scribed in paragraph 7.1.1.2. 
 
7.1.2.2. Capping the Repair. 
 
7.1.2.2.1. Step 1:  After the 30-minute initial backfill cure time, use blowers from 
the RADR Tool Trailer to remove water from the tarp and then remove the tarp 
by folding the tarp from the low side of the repair towards the high side without 
disturbing the sand berm and water hose. Ensure there is enough room between 
92                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
the edge of the repair and the folded back tarp to allow a frontend loader to travel 
between the repair and tarp. 
 
7.1.2.2.2. Step 2:  Use blowers to blow any water from the repair before placing 
HMA capping material. 
 
7.1.2.2.3. Step 3:  Dump trucks with bed covers should be at the repair ready to 
dump HMA as the repair’s water mitigation tarp is being removed. Before dump-
ing, the spotter checks the HMA temperature with a digital infrared thermometer 
to verify it is 280°F or hotter as required for break down rolling. If the HMA is 
equal to or greater than the minimum required temperature, carefully dump the 
proper amount of HMA directly into the repair. Use blowers to divert water from 
the repair during the placement of the HMA. 
 
7.1.2.2.4. Step 4:  The front-end loader should be prepositioned on opposite sides 
of the repair as HMA is dumped into the repair. After the dump truck has finished 
dumping HMA and moved out of the way, the front-end loader evenly spreads the 
HMA across the entire repair until the cap is approximately 1.5 inches, ±0.25 
inches, higher than the runway surface. 
 
Note:  Adjust overfill height if the cap thickness is not exactly 4 inches deep. 
 
7.1.2.2.5. Step 5:  During asphalt placement and spreading, helpers assist with 
placing, cleaning, and preparing the edges using lutes and/or square shovels. 
 
7.1.2.2.6. Step 6:  When repair is overfilled to the appropriate height, the mat is 
ready for rolling; place the tarp over the cap and conduct rolling as follows: 
 
a. 
0.5 pass (parallel to center line) with steel-wheel roller, no vibration 
 
b. 2.5 passes (parallel to center line) with steel-wheel roller, vibration on 
 
c. 
2 passes (parallel to center line) with pneumatic roller 
 
d. 1 pass with steel-wheel roller, no vibration 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           93 
 
 
e. 
Remove tarp and complete 2 passes (longitudinal with crown of runway) 
with steel-wheel roller, no vibration 
 
Note:  If check cracking is noted in the mat or if there is evidence of chipping of 
concrete edges, grooves, or joints, turn off vibration and add an additional half 
pass for step “a” and decrease step “b” to 2 passes. 
 
Note:  It is necessary for the asphalt cap to be 150°F or less before receiving initial 
vehicle traffic (2.5-ton vehicle for FOD prevention or paint striping), and 125°F 
or less before receiving aircraft traffic. 
 
7.1.2.2.7. Step 7:  The natural cooling process takes approximately 2 hours to 
reduce asphalt temperature to 150°F (depending on environmental conditions). 
Rain will help reduce cooling time; however, if rain is very light or intermittent, 
the water truck operator will flood repairs with water. Repairs are flooded as as-
phalt begins to develop a dry area. The operator should flood a repair briefly and 
move to the next repair alternating between repairs as required. When repairs 
reach 150°F the water truck operator removes cones identifying the repair zone, 
signaling to the Striping Crew and FOD Team that the work area is open. 
 
7.2. Heat Above 74°F. In warmer climates, an additive with the ability to extend 
set time of rapid setting concrete is required. If rapid setting concrete sets too 
quickly, the concrete could cause malfunction of the volumetric mixer or not al-
low sufficient finish time for the crater repair. This same additive is not required 
for flowable fill but can be used to slow flowable fill set time in case of an emer-
gency. The additive used for slowing set time is citric acid (anhydrous) in powder 
form. The material is typically purchased in 50 lb. bags and stored in 50 lb. buck-
ets inside RADR material containers for both flowable fill and rapid setting con-
crete. 
 
7.2.1. The manufacturer’s recommendations and field experience were used to 
develop the recommended dosage rate for citric acid (Table 7.1.) when placing 
rapid setting concrete at various temperatures. The citric acid should be added to 
an empty five-gallon bucket along with one to two gallons of water and stirred 
94                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
briefly before adding to the volumetric mixer water tanks. In emergency situa-
tions, where rapid setting concrete or flowable fill is beginning to setup (particu-
larly on the auger), it is recommended that 2 to 3 pounds of citric acid be mixed 
with one to two gallons of water and applied to the setting up repair material. This 
action will slow the set time to help aid in the cleanup process.

7.2.2. To reduce logistics of measuring citric acid during repairs, citric acid is 
packaged as shown in Figure 7.2. Fifty pounds of citric acid are stored in six-
gallon buckets with screw-on lids. A plastic scoop that holds approximately one 
pound of citric acid is stored inside the bucket so the citric acid can be measured 
easily before adding to the mix water tanks. Instructions are displayed on the out-
side of the bucket as a quick reference.

7.2.3. In hot climates, draw water early in the morning and if not used immedi-
ately, place water vessel under cover to shield from the sun. If necessary, ice may 
be added to the water to cool below 70°F. 
 
7.3. Cold Weather Below 50°F. In colder climates, an additive with the ability 
to reduce set time of rapid setting concrete may be required. If the rapid setting 
concrete sets too slowly, the concrete may not cure within the 2-hour requirement 
to support aircraft traffic. Use aluminum sulfate additive to meet the curing time. 
This additive is not in the crater repair UTC and must be sourced, purchased, and 
stocked in locations where climates fall below 50°F. 
 
7.3.1. The aluminum sulfate in powder form should be added to approximately 5 
gallons of water to form slurry before being added to the volumetric mixer water 
tanks. 
 
7.3.2. Table 7.2. displays the recommended dosage rates for aluminum sulfate per 
super sack of dry concrete material based on the ambient temperature. If the am-
bient temperature is between the temperatures listed, the lower temperature should 
be used to maintain conservatism. The RADR rapid setting concrete mix is not 
recommended for use below 15˚F.

7.4. Nighttime Operations. Six light carts are included with each 4FWCR UTC. 
Four are designated for lighting the airfield repair zone and should be towed to 
the airfield if repairs are expected to be performed during darkness. The remaining 
two are designated for warehouse and batch plant operations. 
7.5. Camouflet Repair. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams should in-
vestigate and mitigate any UXO within the camouflet. Afterwards, pavement will 
be cut just beyond the void to ensure a sound base exists under the edge of the 
parent pavement and the camouflet will then be repaired as a crater.

RAPID SPALL REPAIR 
 
8.1. Introduction. Aircraft cannot land or takeoff until spalls have been repaired. 
Spall repair must be completed within the same 6.5 hours as crater repair, Emer-
gency Airfield Lighting System (EALS) installation, aircraft arresting system 
(AAS) installation, and Minimum Airfield Operating Surface (MAOS) marking 
and striping. Spalls are defined as pavement damage that does not penetrate the 
full pavement thickness to the underlying soil layers, is not larger than five feet in 
diameter, or no upheaval in surrounding pavements (Figure 8.1.). Thousands of 
spalls will be expected after an attack, possibly hundreds will require repair. 
 
Figure 8.1. Spall and Crater Profiles. 
 
 
8.2. Resources. Table 8.1. identifies the Expeditious Spall Repair resources 
(UTC 4FWSR) and required crew personnel. The smallest operational capability 
fielded is a Medium Capability, which has 3 spall crews (9 personnel). Large Ca-
pabilities have 15 spall repair personnel and the Very Large Capability have 21 
spall repair personnel. Therefore, teams have the flexibility to configure their 
crews to best meet their situation. 
 
Note:  Small capabilities are located at Air Force Civil Engineer Center sponsored 
training sites.

8.2.1. Crew Size Recommendations. The scope of spall damage will most likely 
govern crew size. Experimentation has shown a 4-person spall repair crew is the 
optimal crew size for spall repair operations. However, there are instances when 
a 3-person and/or 5-person crew may be more appropriate; fatigue plays a large 
roll when determining crew sizes. 
 
Note:  Crew performance may differ from the following examples due to person-
nel experience, personnel skills, equipment condition, etc. 
 
8.2.1.1. Through testing it has been determined a 3-person crew can repair an av-
erage of 40 spalls per hour. Therefore, it appears this crew can repair up to 260 
spalls within the 6.5-hour recovery time if they had enough repair material; how-
ever, this would only be the case in ideal conditions without factoring in personnel 
fatigue and cure time. 
 
8.2.1.2. Factoring in fatigue, environmental conditions (e.g., extreme heat), and 
threat conditions requiring personal protective gear (e.g., battle rattle, chemical 
ensembles, etc.), it is a given the crews’ production rate will decrease over time. 
In addition, cure time for the last spall repair before aircraft trafficking is 2-hours. 
Table 8.2. shows testing results for production rates of three spall repair crew 
sizes over a 4.5-hour period. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           99

8.2.1.3. As mentioned earlier, a Medium Capability has 9 spall repair personnel. 
This provides the flexibility of having multiple crew sizes to meet the scope of 
damage. The Crater Repair Chief may choose to have three 3-person crews; two 
4-person crews; one 4-person crew and one 5-person crew; one 3-person crew and 
one 4-person crew; one 3-person crew and one 5-person crew; or only one of ei-
ther of the three crews. If the spall repair personnel are left over after selecting 
crew sizes, the extra people may be used for resupplying the spall repair crews 
(see paragraph 8.4.). 
 
8.2.1.4. The Crater Repair Chief has even more flexibility with Large (15 spall 
repair personnel) and Very Large Capabilities (21 spall repair personnel). The 
possible crew sizes and numbers increase exponentially. Table 8.3. provides a 
simplified example of determining numbers of spall repair crews related to work-
load. For example: if there were 450 spalls and the installation had a Medium 
Capability, assemble one 4-person crew and one 5-person crew.

8.2.2. Equipment and Tools. The 4FWSR UTC inventory, for a 3-person crew, is 
found in Table A2.4. A Medium Repair Capability has three UTCs with equip-
ment and tools for 9 persons, a Large Repair Capability has enough equipment 
and tools for 15 persons, and a Very Large Capability supports 21 persons. 
 
8.2.3. Vehicle Configuration Recommendations. Ideally, the vehicle configura-
tion should be capable of carrying all consumables and equipment necessary to 
complete repairs for assigned spall field(s) without having to restock. However, 
spall repair vehicles used for airfield recovery will be shop and/or Basic Expedi-
tionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) vehicles and there is no way of knowing what 
vehicles will be available. When work is expected during darkness, ensure wobble 
lights, head-mounted lamps, and trouble-lights are loaded on vehicles. Whatever 
configuration is used, the vehicle load and towing capacities should not be ex-
ceeded. Recommended vehicle configurations follow: 
 
8.2.3.1. Six-Pack Pickup with Utility Trailer. This is the preferred vehicle config-
uration (Figure 8.2.). The trailer eliminates the need to unload mixing mate-
rial/equipment at each stop; thereby, increasing speed of repairs and lessening 
fatigue of crew members. Without the trailer, this vehicle does not have enough 
capacity or cargo space to be useful for the spall repair mission. The trailer pro-
vides load capacity to complete large numbers of repairs without continuously 
restocking consumables (i.e., water and repair material). The truck must have an 
appropriate hitch for the trailer connection. Figure 8.3. provides stocking recom-
mendation for the truck and trailer.

Figure 8.3. Recommended Pickup and Trailer Stocking Configuration. 
 
 
8.2.3.2. 1-Ton Stake-bed Truck. Other than the six-pack, the 1-ton stake-bed truck 
(Figure 8.4.) is the most likely vehicle available to perform expeditious spall re-
pair after an attack. Its advantage is twice the load capacity of the six-pack (when 
there is no utility trailer available). However, its load capacity is still limited and 
must be restocked often with consumables. A 1.5- or 2-ton stake-bed truck is pref-
erable to reduce the need of restocking. If available, an electric lift-gate would 
104                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
ease the process by keeping the lift-gate 12 to 18-inches above the pavement sur-
face and use it as the mixing station surface. This eliminates the need to unload 
and load the mixing buckets, cups, and mixer at every stop. Removing the side 
rails may improve access to cargo. See Figure 8.5. for the recommended load 
configuration for the equipment and materials.

8.2.4. Repair Material. The spall repair UTC materials are on the Approved Spall 
Repair Products List found on the Tri-Service Transportation website at 
https://transportation.erdc.dren.mil/cacsites/TriService/pavement_repair.aspx. 
The kit contains enough material to repair approximately 200 spalls with an aver-
age size of 24-inches in diameter and 6-inches deep. When replenishing the kit, 
ensure only items on the approved list are ordered. Follow manufacturers’ instruc-
tions for mixing and placing material. Some approved material is self-leveling 
after mixing while some require finishing with a steel trowel or magnesium float. 
Mixing repair material is best performed by adding the material to water rather 
than adding water to the material. When possible, add proper amount of water to 
an empty five-gallon bucket and then add repair material to better achieve thor-
ough mixing. 
 
Note:  Individuals mixing repair material should wear a respirator from drawer 
#1 of the RADR Tool Trailer. 
 
8.2.5. Water Supply Set Up. Arrange water supply assets as shown in Figure 8.6. 
Use item 7 when a power-port is available inside the cab; otherwise, use item 8 to 
connect the pump to the vehicle battery. The on-demand pump starts and stops 
automatically as the spray nozzle is opened and closed.

8.3. Repair Process. After vehicles/trailers have been loaded, perform expedi-
tious spall repairs as follows: 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           107 
 
 
8.3.1. Identify Repair Zone. The repair zone is the area of a spall field where re-
pairs occur each time the vehicle stops. The recommended repair zone is 50-ft 
wide by 25-ft long (Figure 8.7.). If the minimum operating strip (MOS) is wider 
than 50 feet, consider making additional passes with the same crew or additional 
crews. 
 
Figure 8.7. Repair Zone. 
 
 
8.3.1.1. When using one crew for a full width runway, first repair spalls down the 
center of the MOS at the width of the aircraft wheel path so they cure within the 
established deadline. Then, while going in the opposite direction, repair spalls 
down one side of the runway. Finally, reverse direction and complete the spalls 
on the opposite/final side of the runway. Otherwise, three crews may work to 
cover the full MOS width simultaneously. 
 
8.3.1.2. Mark spall fields with white cones (located within the spall repair kit) to 
prevent vehicle traffic over repairs while curing. Repairs may be trafficked by 
vehicles after 45 minutes of curing time and aircraft after 2 hours of curing time. 
 
8.3.1.3. Damage penetrating the full pavement depth must be repaired by the 
crater repair crews. Notify Crater Repair Team Lead of the damage and mark the 
108                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
damage within spall fields by laying a white cone on its side to notify the crater 
repair team. 
 
8.3.2. Concrete Spall Repairs. Spall repairs during airfield recovery will be expe-
ditious temporary repairs. Table 8.4 lists the steps, personnel that perform each 
step, and time associated with each step. Consider rotating responsibilities at each 
repair zone to limit fatigue to any one individual. Adjust responsibilities when 
increasing crew size. 
 
Note:  When time permits after initial recovery, repairs will be re-accomplished 
with permanent repairs IAW AFTTP 3-32.16, Sustaining Airfield Pavement at 
Contingency Locations. 
 
Table 8.4. Three-Person Crew Process at Each Repair Zone. 
 
 
8.3.2.1. Repair Preparation. To help ensure a suitable bond, the spall must be 
cleaned and standing water removed before placing repair material in the spall.

8.3.2.1.1. If upheaval is apparent, or damage has penetrated completely through 
the pavement to underlying soil structures (Figure 8.8.), mark the spall with a 
white cone on its side, inform the Crater Repair Team Lead of the situation and 
move on to the next repair. 
 
Note:  When upheaval is apparent, it must be removed either manually with a 
jackhammer, saw, or compact track loader with a planer attachment (all available 
on the ADR work-tool attachment trailer).

or shop vacuum completely removes large chunks of debris, dust, and standing 
water from the spall. Keep the one-foot clean space around the spall. If loose 
pieces of debris cannot be removed by hand, remove them with a pickaxe, pry bar, 
sledgehammer, or impact hammer/breaker. Figure 8.8. shows a properly prepped 
spall ready for repair. 
110                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
 
8.3.2.2. Repair Material Preparation. A third crew member estimates amount of 
spall repair materials required to perform repairs in the repair zone and unloads 
this amount from the truck and places buckets at the mixing station. 
 
Note:  One bucket on average can repair a 16-inch diameter spall, two inches 
deep. 
 
8.3.2.2.1. The repair material consolidates during storage; therefore, tumble the 
buckets end-over-end six to eight times in order to break apart the solid chunks of 
condensed dry mix into smaller, more manageable pieces when dry mixing with 
the power mixer. 
 
Note:  This step may be conducted during pre-attack actions to save time during 
recovery. 
 
8.3.2.2.2. By this time the first member should be finished clearing debris from 
the spalls. He/she removes bucket lids and fills two 5-gallon buckets with water 
from the water tank and places them at the mixing location. 
 
Note:  The water buckets require constant filling for mixing as well as for cleaning 
the mixer paddles and floats/trowels to prevent repair material buildup. 
 
Note:  Individuals mixing repair material should wear a respirator from drawer 
#1 of the RADR Tool Trailer. 
 
8.3.2.2.3. Plug the power mixer (Figure 8.9.) into the generator and plunge the 
paddles into the dry mix with a continuous and rapid rotation of the mixer head 
until all material is disturbed and has a “fluffy” appearance (approximately 30 
seconds). 
 
Note:  This step may be conducted during pre-attack actions to save time during 
recovery.

8.3.2.2.4. Once material has been thoroughly dry-mixed and spalls within the re-
pair zone have been prepared (i.e., debris, dust, and water removed) slowly add 
the manufacturers recommended amount of water to the repair material bucket 
while mixing (Figure 8.10.). Mix material until all dry spots have disappeared 
and a consistency of pancake batter is achieved (approximately 1.5 to 2 minutes). 
 
Note:  Rinse paddles in water bucket after mixing each bucket.

Figure 8.10. Adding Water While Mixing Repair Material. 
 
 
Note:  All rapid-setting concretes react differently in various environmental/ cli-
matic conditions. Therefore, the mixer operator must pay particular attention to 
how quickly the material appears to be setting up. The mixer operator determines 
how long each mix will be mixed and when the mix is considered unsuitable for 
repairs and should be discarded. 
 
Note:  When temperatures are greater than 90° Fahrenheit the material is likely to 
start setting either before mixing is complete, while carrying the material to the 
spall, and/or while filling the spall. Conversely, when temperatures are less than 
40° Fahrenheit, or where humidity is excessive, the same mix may not set for 
hours. Admixtures (retarders/accelerators) are utilized to mitigate these condi-
tions (Figure 8.11.). 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           113 
 
Figure 8.11. Retardant Admixture. 
 
 
8.3.2.3. Placing Repair Material. Once a uniform wet-mix has been achieved, the 
member finished cleaning the spalls now quickly carries and places wet mixed 
material in the clean spalls. 
 
8.3.2.3.1. Depending upon the type of repair material and environmental condi-
tions, it may readily flow (Figure 8.12.) into all exposed voids/cracks until reach-
ing the surrounding pavement surface, or may require floating and/or troweling 
(Figure 8.13.) to ensure material fills all exposed voids/cracks and to achieve a 
smooth and flush finish. Avoid feathering material beyond perimeter of the repair; 
material on the parent surface may become a FOD potential. 
 
Note:  When troweling is required, do not spend excessive time attempting to 
achieve a perfectly smooth and flush surface.

Figure 8.12. Self-Leveling Mix. 
 
 
Figure 8.13. Mix Requiring Floating/Troweling. 
 
 
8.3.2.3.2. Slightly overfill the repair, not greater than 0.25-inch (Figure 8.14.), to 
compensate for settlement during hydration. 
 
Note:  A magnesium float or steel trowel should be readily available in the event 
of overspill or when the material sets up too quickly leaving a rough surface tex-
ture that may cause aircraft tire damage if not smoothed (Figure 8.15.). Excess 
material must quickly be removed before it sets and placed back in the bucket to 
prevent a FOD potential.

8.3.2.4. Transport to Next Repair Zone. Once repairs in the repair zone have been 
accomplished, all tools, materials, and trash are placed in the transport vehicle and 
the team moves to the next 25-foot by 50-foot repair zone (Figure 8.7.). 
 
8.4. Asphalt Spall Repairs. Perform expeditious asphalt spall repairs in the same 
manner as described for expeditious concrete spall repairs in paragraph 8.3.2. 
These repairs are not likely to last 100 passes; therefore, they must be constantly 
monitored and repaired immediately when signs of failure appear. Replace the 
expeditious repairs with a permanent repair as soon as repair crews are granted 
time on the MOS. 
 
8.4.1. If upheaval is apparent, place a white cone on its side on the spall, inform 
the Crater Repair Team Lead of the situation and move to the next repair. Crater 
Repair Team personnel repair these spalls after all craters in the repair zone have 
been repaired during crater repair cure time. 
 
8.4.2. The Crater Repair Team should attempt to roll the asphalt upheaval if it 
appears it can be rolled into place. If unable to roll the upheaval back in place, 
remove upheaval with a jackhammer, saw, or compact track loader with a planer 
attachment (all-available on the RADR tool trailer). After airfield recovery, re-
place the repair with an asphalt patch when time permits. 
 
8.5. Restocking Vehicle(s) with Consumables. Vehicle configuration will deter-
mine how often consumables (i.e., water and repair material) are restocked. When 
comparing Figure 8.3. and Figure 8.5. it is readily apparent more consumables 
can be loaded on the truck and utility trailer configuration; therefore, this config-
uration does not require restocking as often as the 1-ton vehicle configuration. 
Likewise, 1.5- and 2-ton cargo trucks require less restocking than the 1-ton truck. 
 
Note:  The more spall repair crews there are, the more personnel will be required 
to help keep the crews supplied with consumables. Therefore, any spall repair 
personnel not tasked may help the warehouse keep the crews stocked. 
 
8.5.1. Using the spall baseline (24-inch diameter by 6-inch deep), the amount of 
repair material and water (about 1 gallon of water per bucket) the vehicle can 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           117 
 
carry, and the number of spalls a crew can repair per-hour, it can be estimated 
how often each vehicle configuration must be restocked before resources are de-
pleted. See Table 8.5. for restocking requirements.

8.5.1.1. Six-Pack Truck and Utility Trailer Configuration. A significant advantage 
with this configuration is 110 gallons (approximately 8-lbs per gal) of water can 
be stocked on the trailer along with tools and equipment and the half-ton truck’s 
cargo capacity can be reserved for buckets of repair material, which equates to 20 
buckets (approximately 50-lbs per bucket). This configuration can repair approx-
imately 20 spalls before repair material runs out and approximately 110 spalls 
before the water runs out. According to Table 8.2., it takes approximately 30 
minutes for a 3-person crew to repair 20 spalls. Therefore, the warehouse team 
must restock the truck with repair material every 30 minutes and the water must 
be restocked every 2 hours and 40 minutes with a water truck from the backfill or 
capping crew. Restocking intervals are adjusted as fatigue affects production 
rates. 
 
8.5.1.2. 1-Ton Stake Bed Truck. A significant disadvantage with this configura-
tion is the load capacity of the truck limits the water load to only 55 gallons and 
the repair material to 15 buckets. Unfortunately, this is the most common vehicle 
available for spall repair. This configuration requires restocking repair material 
approximately every 20 minutes and refilling the water tank approximately every 
80 minutes initially. 
 
8.5.1.3. 1.5-Ton Stake Bed Truck. This vehicle increases the time between re-
stocking requirements compared to the 1-ton truck. Two 55-gallon water tanks 
118                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
can be loaded on this truck along with 36 buckets of repair material. This config-
uration requires restocking repair material approximately every 60 minutes and 
the water tank refilled approximately every 160 minutes initially. 
 
8.5.1.4. 2-Ton Stake Bed Truck. This vehicle may be loaded with 110 gallons of 
water and 56 buckets of repair material. This configuration provides the greatest 
intervals between restocking. Water must be restocked every 160 minutes and 
repair material is restocked every 80 minutes. 
 
8.6. Spall Repair in Rain. A roll of plastic sheeting is included in the Spall Repair 
UTC. Load this roll on the vehicle when loading equipment and material. During 
pre-attack actions, fill several buckets with sand to use for damming around re-
pairs to keep rain from flowing in repairs. Load buckets of sand on the vehicle 
when rain is expected during repair operations. 
 
8.6.1. Follow procedures from paragraphs 8.3.2.1 thru 8.3.2.4 above. 
 
8.6.2. If pavement is sloped towards repairs causing water intrusion, use sand to 
dam around the high side of the repairs to keep water out. 
 
8.6.3. With a wet-mixed bucket of repair material ready, vacuum or blow standing 
water out of the spall and immediately pour repair material in the spall. 
 
8.6.4. As material is placed in the spall, cut a piece of plastic large enough to 
overlap the surrounding parent pavement by at least four inches. Immediately af-
ter repair material is placed, cover the repair with plastic and anchor plastic sheet 
edges with debris to resist wind from blowing plastic off the repair. 
 
Note:  This action slows repair set time. 
 
8.6.5. Once all spalls have been repaired, return to original starting point and re-
move plastic covers from repairs and place plastic in an empty bucket to be dis-
carded later.

spall repair is complete to receive their next assignment.

FOREIGN OBJECT DEBRIS REMOVAL 
 
9.1. Overview. This team provides the capability to remove large and small debris 
from the convoy routes, crater repair areas, perform initial and simultaneous 
sweeping operations on the airfield and around the crater repair areas, and perform 
final sweeping operations before aircraft trafficking can begin. One foreign object 
debris (FOD) Removal Team supports all Rapid Airfield Damage Recovery 
(RADR) capabilities (i.e., small, medium, large, and very large). For example, if 
the installation has a Medium RADR Capability, only one FOD Removal Team 
is postured to support the three repair teams. It may be augmented with debris 
removal equipment and compact track loaders (CTL) from the crater repair teams 
with broom attachments. See Figure 9.1. for recommended order of operations 
after clearing the convoy routes and material delivery paths on the runway. 
 
Figure 9.1. Recommended Order of Operations. 
 
 
Note:  The following debris removal data was collected during a RADR exercise 
at Kadena AB and may be useful for planning purposes: 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           121 
 
• 
Time to remove and broom 3’ x 10’ x 100’ debris berm from side of 
runway:  55 minutes 
 
• 
Time to remove 1” minus debris, no higher than 3’, from a 75’ x 300’ 
area:  1.5 hours 
 
• 
Time to sweep and vacuum 75’ x 300’:  1.75 hours 
 
9.2. Runway Cleanliness Standards. The peacetime standard of cleanliness for 
runways and taxiways requires that they be kept free of any debris that could cause 
damage to aircraft. In wartime, the runway surfaces will be extensively covered 
with debris after an attack; no equipment available can rapidly clear the surface 
to peacetime standards. In any case, the risk to aircraft being launched from a 
“dirty” runway is much less than if during an attack aircraft were caught sitting 
on the ramp waiting for sweeping operations to be completed. 
 
9.2.1. Different standards of cleanliness can be achieved by using various combi-
nations of equipment in the RADR equipment sets. Tests have shown that very 
little benefit is achieved by making more equipment coverages than the following 
recommendations: 
 
9.2.1.1. The cleanest surface is achieved by making one fast (4 to 5 mph) sweep 
of the area with a grader, followed by two coverages with a vacuum sweeper trav-
eling at 3.5 to 4 mph. 
 
9.2.1.2. Achieve a clean surface by conducting one fast (4 to 5 mph) grader cov-
erage followed by one coverage with a kick-broom traveling approximately 5.5 
mph. These speeds are effective only if debris is mostly dry. If debris is wet and 
sticky, a broom cannot produce a good clean surface. 
 
9.2.1.3. A slow (2 to 3 mph) grader coverage followed by a second, faster (3 to 5 
mph) coverage will leave a “dirty” surface, because more large stones are left on 
it. 
 
122                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
9.2.1.4. The “dirtiest” surface, but fastest operation, is left by conducting one 
“fast” (4 to 5 mph) coverage with a grader only. 
 
9.3. Resources. Table 9.1. identifies the resources required for the FOD removal 
process. 
 
9.3.1. Vehicles. Vehicles for the FOD Removal Team are provided by UTC 
4FWFD, usually during airfield recovery operations at main operating bases 
(MOB) when time is of the essence. See Table 9.1. for a complete list of the FOD 
Removal Vehicle Set. 
 
9.3.2. Personnel. Personnel on the FOD Removal Team are sourced from perma-
nently assigned personnel at a MOB and/or beddown forces at a contingency lo-
cation. When forces are sourced specifically for FOD removal duties task two 
Pavements/Construction Teams (4FPAS).

Note: The Lead’s primary vehicle is the grader; if the dozer is required to re-
move damaged aircraft from the Minimum Airfield Operating Surface 
(MAOS), the lead will haul the dozer to the airfield with the tractor-trailer first 
and then return to retrieve the grader. 
 
9.4. Process. Sweep all areas to be trafficked by aircraft even if debris appears 
minimal. It is essential to remove as much shrapnel as possible since even small 
pieces of sharp metal can damage tires. The following steps are recommended in 
the FOD removal process. 
 
9.4.1. Step 1:  The FOD Team leads the convoy to the runway. Upon arrival, the 
FOD Removal Team should split into two crews (augmented by one loader from 
each crater repair team) and each crew clears a 25 feet wide convoy/material haul 
lane down the entire minimum operating strip (MOS) (Figure 9.2.). The Rapid 
Airfield Damage Recovery Officer in Charge (RADR OIC)/Crater Chief should 
direct which side of the minimum operating strip (MOS) the haul lane will be 
cleared. Debris will be moved to the opposite side. 
 
124                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
Figure 9.2. FOD Team Clearing Haul/Material Lane. 
 
 
9.4.2. Step 2: After clearing the haul lane, the FOD Removal Team clears the 
threshold and departure ends. After the ends of the runway have been cleared, the 
crater repair team loaders return to their respective teams. 
 
9.4.3. Step 3: Make a single coverage about 15 feet wide with the grader 1,400 
feet down the centerline of what will be the overruns of the MOS to provide open 
access for approach lighting placement. 
 
9.4.4. Step 4: Clear a path about 15 feet wide from the MOS to the Precision 
Approach Path Indicator installation location. 
 
9.4.5. Step 5: Clear a path about 25 feet wide from the MOS to the aircraft arrest-
ing system (AAS) installation locations. 
 
9.4.6. Step 6: Clear parking aprons and taxiways. A better standard of sweeping 
is required on parking aprons and uphill sections of the taxiway where the aircraft 
needs to use more power and is therefore likely to ingest more debris. Use a kick 
broom sweeper or second grader coverage at these locations. 
 
9.4.7. Step 7: Clear the MOS as follows: 
 
9.4.7.1. Clear the first 300 feet (the most critical area) with a vacuum sweeper. 
 
9.4.7.2. Clear the next 800 feet with a vacuum sweeper, if possible. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           125 
 
9.4.7.3. Clear remainder of MOS with kick broom sweeper or by two passes with 
the grader. 
 
9.4.8. As time and vehicles permit, remove as much FOD as possible from all 
airfield pavements to be used for launch and recovery purposes. Sweeper support 
will be in high demand and plan to make frequent trips to the MOS for FOD clean 
up—aircraft activity and winds will continually blow additional debris across the 
airstrip. Once airfield pavement debris clearance is under control, you can expect 
demands from wing leadership to clean base thoroughfares leading to the flight-
line from maintenance facilities, munitions storage areas, and petroleum oil and 
lubricant storage sites. 
 
Note:  The FOD Removal Team will most likely operate as a distributed team to 
adequately support all recovery teams. As such, it is critical for the Command and 
Control (C2) element to be kept informed of clearing operations and upcoming 
requirements. The FOD Removal Team departs the MAOS after the Airfield Man-
agement Team has accepted the MAOS for operations.

UTC—Unit Type Code 
UXO—unexploded explosive ordnance 
 
Terms 
 
Airfield—An area prepared for the accommodation (including any buildings, in-
stallations, and equipment), landing, and takeoff of aircraft. 
Air Tasking Order (ATO)—A method used to task and disseminate to compo-
nents, subordinate units, and command and control agencies projected sorties, ca-
pabilities and/or forces to targets and specific missions. Normally provides spe-
cific instructions to include call signs, targets, controlling agencies, etc., as well 
as general instructions.  
Airfield Damage Assessment—Locating, classifying, and measuring the damage 
(camouflet, crater, spall, and UXO) on the airfield operating surfaces.  
Alarm Black—An alert condition signifying the attack is over, but chemical 
agent contamination is possible. Personnel are cleared to leave shelters but must 
wear chemical protective ensembles. 
Alarm Yellow—An alert condition generally established when an attack is ex-
pected within 30 minutes or less. This allows forces to take protective actions. 
Apron—A defined area on an airfield intended to accommodate aircraft for the 
purposes of loading or unloading passengers or cargo, refueling, parking, or 
maintenance. 
Contingency—A situation requiring military operations in response to natural 
disasters, terrorists, subversives, or as otherwise directed by appropriate authority 
to protect US interests. 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           129 
 
Camouflet—Craters with relatively small apparent diameters, but deep penetra-
tion and subsurface voids created by the munition puncturing through the pave-
ment surface and exploding in the underlying material. Note:  Munitions that pen-
etrate the surface but do not explode are also treated as a camouflets. 
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a 
properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accom-
plishment of the mission. C2 functions are performed through an arrangement of 
personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a 
commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and oper-
ations in the accomplishment of the mission. 
Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disas-
ters, terrorists, subversives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncer-
tainty of the situation, contingencies require plans, rapid response and special pro-
cedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel, installations, and equip-
ment. 
Crater—The pit, depression, or cavity formed in the surface of the earth by an 
explosion. It may range from saucer-shaped to conical, depending largely on the 
depth of burst. 
Crater Field—A cluster of small craters (less than two feet apart) where their 
upheaval joins the neighboring crater within a defined area. 
Damage Assessment—The process of identifying and locating damage and un-
exploded ordnance following an attack. Damage assessment activities generally 
are separated into two categories: airfield pavements and facility/utility. 
Debris—Material ejected from the crater including broken pavement and soil. 
Debris is some-times usable as backfill material particularly for large crater repair, 
but for small crater or spall repair it is generally not advisable. 
Dispersal—Relocation of forces for the purpose of increasing survivability. 
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—A temporary or permanent facility 
where the coordination of information and resources to support domestic incident 
management activities normally takes place. 
130                                                             AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023 
 
Explosive Ordnance—All munitions containing explosives, nuclear fission or 
fusion materials, and biological and chemical agents. 
Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)—The detection, identification, on-site 
evaluation, rendering safe, recovery, and final disposal of unexploded explosive 
ordnance. It may also include explosive ordnance which has become hazardous 
by damage or deterioration. 
MAOS Selection—The process of plotting damage and UXO locations on an air-
base runway map and using this information to select a portion of the damaged 
runway which can be repaired most quickly to support aircraft operations. 
Minimum Airfield Operating Surface (MAOS)—The combined requirement 
for airfield surfaces for both runway, access routes and aircraft parking areas. The 
MOS is part of the MAOS. 
Minimum Operating Strip (MOS)—1. A runway which meets the minimum 
requirements for operating assigned and/or allocated aircraft types on a particular 
airfield at maximum or combat gross weight. 2. The MOS is the smallest area to 
be repaired to launch and/or recover aircraft after an attack. Selection depends 
upon mission requirements, taxi access, resources available, and estimated time 
to repair. For fighter aircraft, the typically accepted dimensions are 5,000 feet long 
by 50 feet wide. 
Ordnance—Explosives, chemicals, pyrotechnics, and similar stores, e.g., bombs, 
guns and ammunition, flares, smoke, or napalm. 
Pavement Upheaval—The vertical displacement of the airfield pavement around 
the edge of an explosion-produced crater. The pavement upheaval is within the 
crater damage diameter but is outside the apparent crater diameter. In other words, 
it is that part of the pavement out of “flush” tolerance which is elevated above the 
adjacent undamaged surface. 
Recovery—The development, coordination, and execution of service- and site-
restoration plans for impacted communities and the reconstitution of government 
operations and services through individual, private-sector, nongovernmental, and 
public assistance programs that: identify needs and define resources; implement 
additional measures for community restoration; incorporate mitigation measures 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           131 
 
and techniques, as feasible; evaluate the incident to identify lessons learned; and 
develop initiatives to mitigate the effects of future incidents. 
Response—Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. 
Response includes immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and meet 
basic human needs. Response also includes the execution of emergency opera-
tions plans and of incident mitigation activities designed to limit the loss of life, 
personal injury, property damage, and other unfavorable outcomes. 
Runway—A defined rectangular area of an airfield, prepared for the landing and 
takeoff of aircraft along its length. A runway is measured from the outer edge of 
the thresholds from one end of the runway to the others. The width of the runway 
is typically measured from the outer edge of the load-bearing pavement on one 
side to the outer edge of the load-bearing pavement on the other side. In some 
cases, the runway may be measured from the outside edge of the runway marking 
line on one side to the outside edge of the marking line on the other side and any 
remaining load bearing pavement is considered shoulder. 
Safety Data Sheet—Safety Data Sheets includes information such as the proper-
ties of each chemical; the physical, health, and environmental health hazards; pro-
tective measures; and safety precautions for handling, storing, and transporting 
the chemical. 
Spall—Pavement damage that does not penetrate through the pavement surface 
to the underlying soil layers. A spall damage area could be up to 1.5 meters (5 
feet) in diameter. 
Spall Field—A cluster of spalls within a defined area. 
Taxiway—A specially-prepared or designated path on an airfield or heliport, 
other than apron areas, on which aircraft move under their own power to and from 
landing, takeoff, service, and parking areas. 
Threat—An indication of possible violence, harm, or danger. 
Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO)—Explosive ordnance which has been 
primed, fused, armed, or otherwise prepared for action, and which has been fired, 
dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard

to operations, installations, personnel, or material, and remains unexploded either 
by malfunction or design.

EMERGENCY AUGER SWAP OUT PROCEDURES 
 
A4.1. ProAll Mixer: 
 
• 
Swap-out is performed by a 3-man team:  Member 1, Member 2, and 
Member 3. 
 
• 
Member 1 removes tie-down straps and lifting clamps (fork pockets) 
from spare auger (Figure A4.1) stored on a single pivoting tube. 
 
Figure A4.1. Spare Auger Tie-Down Straps and Lifting Clamps. 
 
 
• 
Members 2 and 3 lower auger chute to a horizontal position and discon-
nect hydraulic lines and electrical connectors from the hydraulic control 
system (Figure A4.2). 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           147

Figure A4.13. Retaining Wedges and Arm Studs. 
 
 
• 
Carefully maneuver the mixer away from the unit and set it in a safe 
location where it can be stored without damage until it is worked on or 
stowed back on the trailer. 
 
• 
Remove the lifting strap from the mixer assembly and install it on the 
spare mixer located on the front right side of unit. Carefully place the 
forklift in the proper position to lift the spare mixer off the frame (Figure 
AFTTP 3-32.17  10 OCTOBER 2023                                                           157

Remove the right-side hanger ear from the mix auger. 
 
• 
Slide the left hanger ear onto the pin and install the flat washer and the 
cotter pin (Figure A4.11). 
 
• 
Align the three pin holes in the right hanger ear and slide the ear over the 
mixer pins and hanger pin at the same time. It may be necessary to wiggle 
the discharge end or the mixer assembly to assist the hanger ear going 
onto the pins. 
 
• 
Once the ear is in place, install the flat washer, cotter pin, and the three 
wedges (Figure A4.13). 
 
• 
Raise the mixer assembly with the forklift so the mixer is at 10 degrees. 
Extend the hoist cylinder, align the mounting holes, and install the pin 
(Figure A4.17). Use the hoist lever to make adjusts to slide the pin in.
