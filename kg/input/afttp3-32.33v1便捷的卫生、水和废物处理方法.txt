INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. Overview. This AFTTP addresses field expedient construction or repair 
methods for sanitation and hygiene facilities, wastewater, and solid waste systems 
when time and materials are limited, or when conventional methods are 
impractical to employ. It does not address the installation of standard contingency 
hygiene, water, and waste systems such as Basic Expeditionary Airfield 
Resources (BEAR). For the purpose of this document, expedient is "a means 
devised or employed in a time and place where prompt action is essential." 
Expedient engineering does not preclude using normal engineer practices where 
time and materials are available. This publication contains illustrations of basic 
material applications and proven construction methods during field applications. 
Any data and definitions presented are general in nature and serve as field guides. 
Note: The information in this publication does not supersede any legal 
requirements (domestic US law for operations in the US and for operations 
outside the US: US law with extraterritorial application, applicable international 
agreement requirement, or combatant command directive) that specify how things 
must be done. See Attachment 1 for a glossary of references and supporting 
information. 
 
1.2. Environmental Considerations. The United States Air Force (USAF) is 
committed to maintaining environmental quality to ensure long-term access to the 
air, land, and water needed to protect United States interests abroad. Although a 
high level of environmental quality can be difficult to achieve during contingency 
operations overseas, the health and safety of personnel are critical in any military 
operation. Safe food and water, and a means of properly disposing of waste is 
essential. The intention of environmental goals during contingencies is to 
minimize risks to human health and safety, and prevent unnecessary damage to 
the environment while maximizing the natural resources available to support 
readiness and operational effectiveness. Further information on how to integrate 
environmentally responsible practices during contingency operations can be 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
10 
 
 
found in Air Force Handbook (AFH) 10-222V4, Environmental Considerations 
for Overseas Contingency Operations. 
 
1.3. General Safety Practices. The first rules for any situation requiring CE 
expedient applications are to be flexible and remain safe. Always keep safety in 
mind when using nonstandard construction methods and materials. Unsafe field 
operations could cause injuries, disable equipment, and negatively affect the 
mission. Never compromise safety when employing expedient methods described 
in this publication. 
 
1.3.1. Construction and repair work involves activities that can injure workers in 
many different ways. Working from high elevations, flammable fuels, high 
voltages, dangerous chemicals, and rotating, cutting, and crushing equipment 
associated with CE operations are significant hazards. Be vigilant; adhere to 
technical data warnings and cautions, and wear protective clothing and equipment 
IAW safety information and standards. 
 
1.3.2. Crew leaders should know the capabilities and limitations of assigned 
personnel and monitor all work efforts accordingly. In addition, ensure activities 
are coordinated with all involved. For example, debris removal around facilities 
can be a dangerous task and vibrations from heavy equipment can cause a building 
to collapse on recovery workers. Worksite personnel should not only be cognizant 
of this hazard, they should also be able to recognize other potential safety hazards 
associated with the job. 
 
1.3.3. A key responsibility of supervisors is to ensure personnel have and wear 
the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) and individual protective 
equipment (IPE) for the working environment. Typical items such as lumber, 
masonry materials, and sheet metal can cause cuts and injuries. Even a small cut 
can develop into a serious injury if the wound becomes infected. When working 
in a contaminated environment, be sure to wear the appropriate IPE for the hazard 
present. In addition, wash contaminated clothing and take a shower as soon as 
possible after working in a contaminated environment. Additionally, it is 
important to protect workers from hazards such as high-pressure subsystems and 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
11 
 
 
components, harmful solvents and adhesives, and infectious black and gray water 
products from wastewater systems. Note: As used in this publication, black water 
refers to latrine wastewater containing human waste. Gray water refers to 
wastewater from non-latrine sources such as showers, laundries, kitchen 
operations, and handwashing devices. 
 
1.3.3.1. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-203, Air Force Consolidated 
Occupational Safety Instruction, lists PPE for selected CE activities. Although 
technical orders (T.O.) and other job-related publications address proper wear and 
use of PPE and IPE (for CBRN defense), workers have the ultimate responsibility 
to properly use, inspect, and care for protective equipment assigned to them. 
 
1.3.3.2. Workers should adhere to AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices, when 
lethal voltages are involved. PPE that provides appropriate arc flash protection is 
required for all personnel working on or near exposed energized electrical 
equipment operating at 50 volts or more. See Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-
560-01, Electrical Safety, O&M, and NFPA 70, National Electric Code, to 
identify tasks that require Arc Flash PPE. 
 
1.3.4. Every job or operation has its own particular safety hazards and everyone 
involved should follow proper safety procedures to prevent injury or illness. This 
is especially critical during force beddown at austere locations and base recovery 
activities. Exposure to construction, heavy equipment, power production 
equipment, fuel systems, mechanical systems, and water or wastewater systems 
create an assortment of job related hazards—remain vigilant to stay safe.

FIELD EXPEDIENT HYGIENE AND SANITATION 
 
2.1. Overview. Maintaining health of the force is a central concern during 
beddown operations and contingency deployments in austere locations. Key 
requirements include providing sanitation facilities for disposal of human waste 
and basic personal hygiene. Generally, prepackaged deployable facilities (i.e., 
BEAR assets) support deployed forces when inadequate or no sanitary systems 
are present. However, improvised or field expedient methods may be necessary 
to provide crude, temporary amenities until these deployable, prepackaged 
facilities arrive. This chapter presents basic concepts for creating expedient, 
rudimentary sanitation facilities to support initial sanitation and hygiene 
requirements. These concepts can be expanded to support additional personnel 
through duplication, but are not considered long-term solutions. Facilities 
addressed in this chapter include field expedient latrines, urinals, hand-washing 
stations, and shower-shave stations. These concepts should help personnel 
accomplish minimum requirements to support temporary hygiene and sanitation 
needs until assets become available. 
 
2.2. Human Waste Disposal Policy. AF policy directs human waste be disposed 
of with good sanitary practices. Proper human waste disposal is essential to 
maintaining good health and requires command emphasis at all levels. At the 
installation level, base engineers are responsible for constructing, maintaining, 
and operating fixed sewage systems for human waste disposal. However, during 
deployments to contingency bases and austere locations, engineer provide support 
to build temporary, field expedient hygiene and sanitation devices to facilitate 
human waste disposal. DODI 4715.19, Use of Open-Air Burn Pits in Contingency 
Operations, DODI 4715.22, Environmental Management Policy for Contingency 
Locations, AFH 10-222V4, Environmental Considerations for Overseas 
Contingency Operations, AFPAM 10-219V5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning, 
and AFH 10-222V1, Civil Engineer Bare Base Development, has additional 
information relating to waste disposal requirements and procedures at 
contingency locations.

2.3. Latrines. The type of latrine selected for a given situation depends on several 
factors such as the number of personnel, deployment duration, and geological and 
climatic conditions. Medical public health specialists can assist in determining the 
right type, number, size, and location of latrines. Usually, latrine location is a 
compromise between separation requirements from dining facilities and water 
sources, and convenience for personnel. Multiple latrine sites will be necessary 
for larger contingency locations. Regardless of the type, number, size, and 
location of latrines, sanitation and maintenance is critical to prevent disease 
transmission to and from personnel. Below are four types of latrines typically used 
in austere contingency locations, however, the primary focus of this section will 
be the construction of improvised field-expedient latrines. Note: Local, state, 
federal, and host-nation regulations or laws may prohibit burying human waste.  
Consult theater waste management guidance and check with your local public 
health or preventive medicine specialists for requirements.

Improvised field-expedient latrines 
 
2.3.1. Basic Field Latrine Procedures. Initially, beddown forces may use 
improvised and expedient latrines at austere locations. Most are basic versions of 
either pit or aboveground drum-type latrines (Table 2.1). These basic latrines are 
for temporary use until engineers are able to erect suitable facilities or rehabilitate 
an existing sanitary sewer system. The following general rules apply to field 
expedient latrines: 
 
2.3.1.1. Location and Set-up. To protect food and water from contamination, 
locate latrines at least 100 yards from the dining facility and 100 feet from the 
nearest ground water source. You should not dig latrines to the groundwater table 
or anywhere they may drain into a water source. The groundwater table can be 
determined from information given by local inhabitants or by excavating to the 
groundwater table. Latrines are usually located at least 100 feet from the end of 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
14 
 
 
billeting areas but within a reasonable distance for easy access. Place a canvas or 
brush screen around each latrine or enclose within a tent. If possible, heat the 
shelter in cold climates and light latrines at night if the military situation permits. 
If the situation prohibits lighting, tie pieces of cord or tape to trees or stakes as 
guides to the latrines. Note: Latrines should get daily maintenance. Assign 
specific personnel responsibility for properly the maintaining latrines.

2.3.1.2. Drainage and Fly Control. Dig a drainage ditch adjacent to latrine 
facilities to prevent water from pooling around or flowing into the latrine. To 
control flies and other disease-transmitting insects, spray the shelter with a 
residual pesticide twice a week. Note: Do not spray pit contents. Comply with 
manufacturer’s directions when applying and using insecticides. 
 
2.3.1.3. Hand-Washing Device. Install a simple hand-washing device outside each 
latrine. The device should be easy to operate and have a constant supply of water. 
Emphasize the importance of using hand-washing devices. Hands contaminated 
with fecal material are a common means of disease transmission. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
15 
 
 
2.3.1.4. Latrine Closing Procedures. Close latrine pits when they fill to within 1 
foot of the surface or they are abandoned. Remove the latrine box and close as 
follows: 
• 
Fill pit to the surface with successive, 3-inch layers of earth and pack 
each layer down 
• 
Place a l-foot mound of dirt over the length of the pit to prevent fly pupa 
from escaping the closed latrine 
• 
Install a rectangular sign on top of the mound to indicate the type of pit 
and the date closed; include the unit designation in non-operational areas. 
 
2.3.2. Pit Latrines. All versions of the pit latrine involve digging a pit in the 
ground. The latrine should be located where the groundwater table is deep enough 
to prevent groundwater contamination or water standing in the latrine pit. Its use 
is limited to areas that are free of impervious rock formations near the surface. 
The following paragraphs address cross tree, straddle tree, and deep pit latrines. 
 
2.3.2.1. Cross Tree Latrine. The cross tree latrine (Figure 2.1) is a basic, 
improvised latrine that will usually serve the needs of 6 to 8 personnel. Situate the 
latrine downwind from the beddown area, but not so far from shelters as to 
encourage individuals to break sanitary discipline. In areas where it is difficult to 
dig a pit, ration boxes or similar material should collect waste. Improvise a 
windbreak using boughs, tarpaulins, ponchos, or a snow wall to provide both 
privacy and protect the latrine from wind. 
 
2.3.2.2. Straddle Trench Latrine. The most common type of latrine for 
temporary use (one to three days) is the straddle trench latrine. Commonly, the 
procedure is to dig the straddle trench latrine 1 foot wide, 2 1/2 feet deep, and 4 
feet long (Figure 2.2). In this configuration, each trench will accommodate two 
people at the same time. Remove earth and pile it at the end of the trench so that 
each individual can properly cover his excreta and toilet paper. Provide straddle 
trenches to serve at least 4 percent of the male population and 6 percent of the 
female population. For example, a unit of 100 men and 100 women needs at least 
four latrines for men and six for women. Place trenches at least 2 feet apart. There

are no seats with this type of latrine; however, placing boards along both sides of 
the trench provides better footing. Place toilet paper on a suitable holder and 
protect it from weather with a tin can or other covering.

2.3.2.3. Deep Pit Latrine. Normally, use of deep pit latrines are for longer periods 
and often in built-up areas. As shown in Figure 2.3, use the deep pit latrine with 
a latrine box. Although two-seat latrine boxes are sometimes used, the standard 
latrine box has four seats and is 8 feet long and 2-1/2 feet wide at the base. Cover 
holes with fly-proof, self-closing lids. Fly proof cracks with strips of wood or tin. 
Place a metal deflector (e.g. a flattened can) inside the front of the box to prevent 
urine from soaking into the wood. 
 
Figure 2.3. Four-Seat Deep Pit Latrine. 
 
 
 
2.3.2.3.1. Dig the pit about 2 feet wide and 7-1/2 feet long. This gives the latrine 
box 3 inches of support on all sides. The pit depth depends on the latrine’s period 
of use. As a rough guide, allow 1 foot of depth for each week of estimated use, 
plus 1 foot for the dirt cover when closed. Rock or high groundwater levels often 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
18 
 
 
limit the depth of the pit, but the pit should be no deeper than 6 feet. For some 
soils, support bracing may help to prevent the sides from collapsing; use planking 
or similar material. Pack earth tightly around bottom edges of the box to seal 
openings where flies might enter. Note: If the ground is too hard for digging or 
the water table is too high, consider using a pail latrine or a burnout latrine in 
place of the deep pit latrine. See each alternative for additional information. 
 
2.3.2.3.2. To prevent flies from breeding and to reduce odors, keep the latrine box 
clean, seat lids closed, and cracks sealed. Maintain a good fly control program in 
the area. Applying lime or burning pit contents does not effectively control flies 
or odor. Scrub the box and latrine seats daily with soap and water daily. 
 
2.3.2.3.3. Create a portable version of the deep pit latrine by building the latrine 
box inside a portable structure that offers limited privacy and protection from the 
elements. If prepackaged deployable sanitation assets experience delays, this 
more substantial portable latrine may serve large groups better than some of the 
other expedient options discussed in this chapter. Although portable latrines vary 
in design and construction, most use the same basic principles of mobility, 
adequate ventilation, proper sanitation, and reasonable privacy. Once the pit 
reaches capacity, simply relocate the latrine to another spot (usually in the same 
vicinity), then fill and close the old pit as discussed in paragraph 2.3.1.4. 
 
2.3.3. Bored Hole Latrine. A bored hole latrine consists of a hole that is about 
18 inches in diameter and 15 to 20 feet deep (Figure 2.4). The actual diameter is 
not critical, so make it as large as available augers permit. Remove both ends of a 
metal drum and sink it into the ground to serve as a box. Make a fly-proof seat 
cover with a self-closing lid to fit the top of the drum. If a drum is not available, 
construct a fly-proof, 18-inch high wooden box. A bored hole latrine is better 
suited for small units.

19 
 
 
Figure 2.4. Bored Hole Latrine. 
 
 
 
2.3.4. Expedient Latrines in High Groundwater Areas. Below are descriptions 
of expedient latrines normally used when the groundwater table is high and where 
groundwater contamination or standing water is probable in the latrine pit. These 
latrines may also be ideal when an impermeable rock formation is close to the 
surface, preventing adequate dispersal of liquids. 
 
2.3.4.1. Mound Latrine. A dirt mound makes it possible to build a deep-pit 
latrine without the pit extending into water or rock. Construct a mound of earth 
that is at least 6 feet wide and 12 feet long. It should be able to support a 4-hole 
latrine box. The mound should be high enough to meet the pit's depth requirement. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
20 
 
 
Allow 1-foot from the base of the pit to the water or rock level. Break up or plow 
the area where latrine will be located to aid in seepage of liquids from the pit. If 
timber is available, build a crib of desired height to enclose the pit and support the 
latrine box. Build the mound and compact it in successive l-foot layers to the top 
of the crib as shown in Figure 2.5. Roughen the surface of each layer before 
adding the next. If timber for a crib is unavailable, construct the mound to the 
desired height in l-foot layers, as described and dig the pit into the mound. If 
necessary, brace the walls with wood, sandbags, or other material to prevent them 
from collapsing. Fly proof and enclose a mound latrine as described in paragraph 
2.3.2.3. Note: The size of the mound base depends on the type of soil in the area. 
Make the mound larger if the slope is steep. In addition, it may be necessary to 
build steps up a steep slope.

2.3.4.2. Burn Out Latrine. Often, burn out latrines (Figure 2.6) are the preferred 
method for improvised latrines. These latrines are particularly suitable for jungle 
areas with high groundwater tables and in desert regions where an impervious 
rock layer is a short distance under the sand. Ensure the latrine location is 
downwind of the base camp. A unit of 100 men and 100 women will need at least 
eight men's latrines and eight women's latrines. As shown in Figure 2.7, 
consolidating burn out latrines within a multiple-station latrine facility with floors, 
cover, and partial walls provides semi-privacy and ease of maintenance. 
 
Figure 2.6. Burn Out Latrine Details. 
 
 
 
2.3.4.2.1. The simplest method to create a basic burn out latrine is to place a 55-
gallon drum in the ground and leave enough of the drum above the ground for a 
comfortable sitting height. Then place a wooden seat with a fly-proof, self-closing 
lid on top of the drum. However, for easier handling, cut the drum in half, making 
two latrines of less capacity. Weld handles to the sides of the drum. The handles 
will allow two people to carry the drums to a suitable location to burn the contents. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
22 
 
 
If possible, have two sets of drums so while one set is in use, the other set is being 
burned out. Encourage male personnel to urinate in a urine disposal facility (see 
paragraph 2.4) rather than a burn out latrine because more fuel is required to 
clean a latrine with a liquid content. 
 
Figure 2.7. Multiple-Station Burn Out Latrines. 
 
 
 
2.3.4.2.2. Burn the contents of each drum daily by adding sufficient fuel to 
incinerate the fecal matter. Do not use highly volatile fuel because of its explosive 
nature. A mixture of 1 quart of gasoline to 5 quarts of diesel oil is effective; 
nevertheless, use it with caution. Burn the contents again if they do not become 
dry and odorless in one effort. Bury the residual ash once the burning process is 
complete. 
 
2.3.4.3. Pail Latrine. Similar to burn out latrines, consider use of pail latrine 
facilities when conditions are such that a pit latrine is not feasible (e.g., populated 
areas, rocky soil, marshes). Construct a standard latrine box according to 
paragraph 2.3.2.3. Add a floor and place a pail under each seat. Place hinged 
doors on the rear of the box (see Figure 2.8) to facilitate removal of pails when 
emptying. If the box is located within an enclosure, position the box to form a part 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
23 
 
 
of the outer wall and ensure the rear of the box opens directly to the outside of the 
building. The box should be fly proof, and seats and rear doors should be self-
closing. Construct the floor of the box with an impervious material (concrete if 
possible) and allow sufficient slope toward the rear to allow washing water to 
drain quickly. Clean pails at least once daily and bury, burn, or dispose of the 
contents by another sanitary method. Plastic liners for the pails reduce the risk of 
accidental spillage. Tie the filled bags at the top before disposal.

2.3.5. Alternate Latrine Options. A lack of resources in austere locations could 
make it difficult to build the aforementioned latrines. In such situations, the 
makeshift and personal toilets described below may serve as a temporary solution. 
 
2.3.5.1. Makeshift Toilet. During an emergency or during field activities where 
digging a hole is not an option, personnel can make an expedient toilet using a 
common water bucket. Simply line a bucket with a garbage bag and make a toilet 
seat out of two boards placed parallel to each other across the bucket. After each 
use, pour a disinfectant such as bleach (1 part liquid chlorine bleach to 10 parts 
water) into the garbage bag to help avoid infection and stop the spread of disease. 
Cover the bucket tightly when it is not in use. Bury the garbage and human waste 
in a pit two to three feet deep and at least 50 feet downhill or away from any well, 
spring, or water supply. 
 
2.3.5.2. Personal Toilets. During short deployments or special operations in 
remote and austere locations, personnel may have personal or portable toilets 
similar to those listed in (Table 2.2. When in the field, and away from other 
facilities, use these personal disposal devices if they are available; if not available, 
an option may be to dig individual cat holes (Figure 2.9). In any case, personnel 
should try to dispose of the waste immediately.

2.4. Urinals. In permanent and semi-permanent camps, urine disposal facilities 
usually connect to the sewer system. However, in a field environment, separate 
devices for urine disposal may be necessary. Collocate urinal facilities in or near 
the male latrines to minimize soiling latrine seats. At least one urine disposal 
facility is required for each male latrine or per 100 personnel. The following 
paragraphs describe examples of the more common urine disposal expedient field 
devices and their applicable maintenance procedures. 
 
2.4.1. Urine Soakage Pit. One of the best expedient devices for urine disposal is 
a urine soakage pit. Begin by digging a pit 4 feet square and 4 feet deep, fill it 
with an aggregate material and lay a border along each edge so that each side of 
the soakage pit's surface is 5 feet long. Ideally, the border should be 6 inches wide, 
4 inches deep, and composed of small stones. An optional feature is ventilating 
shafts as shown in Figure 2.10. Finish the facility by adding either a pipe or a 
trough urinal as described in the following paragraphs. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
26 
 
 
Figure 2.10. Urine Soakage Pit. 
 
 
 
2.4.1.1. Pipe Urinal. Pipe urinals should be at least 1 inch in diameter and 
installed at an angle near each corner of the pit or, if needed, on the sides halfway 
between the corners (Figure 2.11). The pipes should extend at least 8 inches 
below the surface of the pit. Place a funnel made of tarpaper, sheet metal, or 
similar material in the top of each pipe. The upper rim of the funnel should extend 
about 30 inches above the pit’s surface. Place a suitable screen in the funnel to 
prevent foreign objects from clogging the pipe. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
27 
 
 
Figure 2.11. Pipe Urinal. 
 
 
 
2.4.1.2. Trough Urinal. If materials are available, another option is to build a 
trough urinal as shown in Figure 2.12. The trough is U- or V-shaped and made of 
sheet metal or wood. If constructed of wood, line the trough with heavy tarpaper. 
Cut the trough legs slightly shorter on the end nearest the pit so the urine flows 
into the soakage pit. Illustrated in Figure 2.13 is a variation of the expedient urinal 
trough. When building this type of trough, the four troughs should be no more 
than 4 1/2 feet long when used with the soakage pit addressed in paragraph 2.4.1. 
Each trough should slope slightly toward one corner where a pipe carries the urine 
to the soakage pit.

29 
 
 
2.4.2. Urinoil. The urinoil is an expedient urine disposal system appropriate for 
longer deployments. In its simplest form, the urinoil is a 55-gallon drum 
containing oil and sitting on top of a recessed soakage pit (Figure 2.14). 
Vegetable oil is preferred, but waste petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) may be 
used. The urinoil operational method is as follows: 
 
Figure 2.14. Basic Urinoil Details. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
30 
 
 
2.4.2.1. Urine voided through the screen immediately sinks through the oil to the 
bottom of the drum. The action of the urinal is somewhat like that of a barometer. 
Adding more urine results in the oil level rising in the 3-inch pipe. This continues 
until it reaches the 1 1/2-inch notch on the overflow pipe in the center of the drum. 
Atmospheric pressure and the weight of the oil cause the urine to overflow until 
reestablishing equilibrium in the drum. The oil also acts as an effective seal 
against odors and flies. 
 
2.4.2.2. To initiate the operation of the urinoil, place the prepared drum in position 
on the soakage pit and tamp the ground around the drum to the level shown in the 
drawing. Next, pour at least one foot of water into the drum. Finally, add oil (about 
32 gallons) until the oil reaches the point indicated in the graphic. The urinoil will 
remain functional as long as the soakage pit will accept urine. 
 
2.4.3. Maintenance of Urine Disposal Facilities. Daily inspections are required 
on urine disposal facilities. Easily lift the screen with attached hooks to remove 
debris. Table 2.3 lists additional steps for maintenance of urinals and soakage 
pits.  
 
Table 2.3. Urinal Facilities Maintenance. 
 
Urinal/Soakage Pit Maintenance 
Step 1 
For proper operation and sanitary purposes, individuals should 
urinate in the trough or the pipe (whichever is available), not 
directly on the pit's surface. 
Step 2 
Wash funnels and troughs with soap and water daily. 
Step 3 
Replace funnels when necessary.  
Step 4 
Prevent oil or grease from getting into the pit to prevent clogging. 
Oil leeching through the pit may also contaminate the groundwater.  
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
31 
 
 
Step 5 
If the latrine is located some distance from sleeping areas, place a 
large can or pail at a convenient location for use as a urinal at night. 
Empty the can into the trough, pipe, or soakage trench every 
morning, and wash the pail with soap and water before reusing it. 
Step 6 
When a urine soakage pit is abandoned or becomes clogged, spray it 
with insecticide. Mound it over with an l-foot covering of 
compacted earth and place a rectangular sign on the mound 
indicating the type of pit and date of closure. 
 
2.5. Expedient Wash and Shower Stations. Just as field expedient latrines, field 
expedient wash and shower stations are crude but functional devices used when 
other more appropriate and desirable facilities are not accessible. Showers and 
hand washing stations are generally located in areas convenient for base residents. 
Typically, engineer personnel are responsible for the construction and upkeep of 
these devices to include disposal of the resulting wastewater. While it is preferable 
to dispose of wastewater into a base sanitary sewer system or expedient 
wastewater system, during the initial stages of an austere beddown operation, 
drainage pits and drainage trenches may be the only options to dispose of 
generated wastewater. See Chapter 4 for temporary and expedient sanitary sewer 
systems and wastewater disposal measures. 
 
2.5.1. Hand-Washing Stations. When manufactured field washstands are not 
available, create expedient or improvised hand-washing stations to enhance 
sanitation. Simple hand-washing devices should be available outside field latrine 
locations and dining facilities. These devices should be easy to operate and have 
a constant supply of water. Construct a soakage pit under each device to prevent 
water from pooling around the hand-washing station. As previously mentioned, 
emphasize the importance of using hand-washing devices to prevent disease 
transmission. Shown in Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16 are examples of expedient 
and improvised hand-washing stations

33 
 
 
2.5.2. Improvised Showers. For obvious sanitary reasons, bathing facilities 
should be available during field activities. Showers have many advantages over 
bathtubs; specifically, they use significantly less water and provide for better 
sanitation. When the field situation permits construction of improvised shower 
devices, locate shower stations in areas convenient for assigned personnel. Ensure 
showering devices have a soakage pit under them to prevent water from pooling. 
For privacy, add a curtain or screen around the shower station. Figure 2.17 and 
Figure 2.18 provide examples of crude, rudimentary shower stations.

2.6. Shave Stations. While it may be difficult maintaining AF appearance 
standards under field conditions, daily shaving and a beardless face is especially 
important when wearing a protective mask under chemical or biological warfare 
conditions. It is difficult to obtain an airtight mask seal with even stubble on the 
face. When field conditions permit, consider constructing improvised shave 
stations similar to that illustrated in Figure 2.19 to support base residents. 
Discarded wastewater should pass through a grease trap before entering the 
soakage pit or trench to prevent clogging. See Chapter 4 for more information on 
grease traps.

DEVELOPING FIELD WATER SOURCES 
 
3.1. Overview. One of CE’s fundamental missions is to develop and maintain an 
adequate supply of safe drinking water for the base population. The need for 
potable water usually receives increased emphasis during force beddown 
operations at austere locations or in the aftermath of a disaster if water supplies 
become limited or unavailable. Typically, engineers know where suitable water 
sources are located before deploying; however, they confirm those sources upon 
arrival at the deployed location. Water sources may need further cultivation or 
development before testing and approved for consumption. Regardless, all field 
water sources should be treated and/or disinfected, then approved by appropriate 
medical representatives. This chapter focuses on expedient development of field 
water sources. Find related information in AFMAN 48-138_IP, Sanitary Control 
and Surveillance of Field Water Supplies, AFH 10-222V4, and UFC 3-230-03, 
Water Treatment. 
 
3.2. Water Source Selection. Generally, engineers use geographic data, survey 
reports, maps, available drawings, aerial photographs, and other assets to help 
determine available raw water sources. The engineers should consider factors 
such as whether the water is fresh, brackish, or salt water; comes from a well, 
river, lake, or ocean; its temperature; and distance from point of use. Water may 
be scarce in some locations and require extraordinary efforts to provide the 
necessary quantity and quality of water. In an arid environment, it is particularly 
important to determine availability of all potential water sources. If sufficient 
water sources are not readily available in the immediate area, shipping water from 
other areas may be required to support the immediate mission until making other 
arrangements. The water source at contingency locations may be a commercial 
supplier, ground water source, or a surface water source. Most military 
installations that do not get water from a municipality often use small potable 
water systems with a groundwater source and limited or specialized treatment 
systems. Table 3.1 lists non-municipal potable and non-potable water sourcing 
options for selected beddown facilities.

3.2.1. Basic Considerations. Water source selection involves a review of 
alternative sources and their respective characteristics. Review both surface water 
sources and existing wells in the area. Consider water quality and quantity of the 
source. Additionally, by reviewing data covering a significant period, you can 
sufficiently assess seasonal and long-term variability. When choosing a water 
source, consider the basic factors below and those listed in Table 3.2. 
 
• 
Safe yield 
• 
Water quality 
• 
Collection requirements (intake structure, wells, etc.) 
• 
Treatment requirements (incl. cost and feasibility of residue disposal) 
• 
Transmission and distribution requirements

3.2.2. Environmental Factors. Pre-deployment planners estimate drinking water 
requirements based on location, climate, and anticipated level, duration, and 
frequency of operational activities. The location and climate conditions usually 
determine availability of water sources and water quantity needed for basic 
subsistence. Table 3.3 lists advantages and disadvantages associated with 
supplying and using water in the world’s four major climatic regions.

3.2.3. Vulnerabilities. The least vulnerable water source is probably ground 
water below the surface. Most likely, natural disasters or hostile attacks would not 
destroy this water source. However, damage could occur to the well and pumping 
systems that give access to the source (e.g., wells becoming partially filled with 
debris, well walls and pumping facilities damaged or destroyed). Similarly, 
damage to a commercial water supply during hostilities or disaster could result in 
reducing or eliminating the base water supply. Various situations can also affect 
surface water sources (e.g. water-borne debris associated with a flood or hurricane 
might block water inlets to the system; nuclear, biological, chemical contaminants 
used during an enemy attack could make the source unusable; conventional enemy 
munitions may diminish, divert, or stop access to a river or lake). 
 
3.2.4. Other Considerations. At austere contingency locations, any plan to use 
local water sources should include an evaluation of overall availability and impact 
of base camp usage on the local population. Drainage and wastewater planning 
should include methods to prevent contamination of agricultural areas and water 
supplies. Planning should also include water conservation measures and 
wastewater treatment methods.

3.3. Water Source Development. Water source development includes actions to 
increase water quantity, quality, or availability for treatment and distribution. 
Avoid elaborate developments and actions to make a temporary source permanent 
unless a survey has concluded a source requiring less work is not available. After 
identifying water sources further develop and maintain these sources using the 
following processes: 
 
• 
Developing water points by creating ponds and lakes across streams, 
deepening and reinforcing existing water collection areas 
• 
Providing drainage to prevent contamination of water sources from 
storm runoff 
• 
Constructing physical protection structures for water sources 
• 
Constructing and improving roads from water points and well sites to the 
main supply routes 
• 
Building, maintaining, repairing semi-permanent and permanent water 
utilities at existing installations 
• 
Repairing and constructing water storage and distribution systems 
 
3.4. Surface Water Resources. Excluding extreme environments, surface water 
from rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds are the most accessible inland water 
sources. These sources are easily developed and readily accessible to water 
purification assets. In regions such as tropical islands with abundant rainfall and 
rapid surface runoff, rainwater is the primary source for inhabitants; however, 
water availability may not be sufficient to supply the needs of both the civilian 
population and the military. Rainwater may be sufficient for small units or limited 
operations, but should not be a consideration if reliable sources are available. 
 
3.4.1. Rivers, Streams, and Lakes. In addition to being easily accessible, rivers, 
streams, and lakes are usually capable of supplying adequate quantities of water. 
However, urban and agricultural runoff, industrial waste discharges, landfill 
leachates, septic tank effluents, or raw and treated sewage outfalls can 
contaminate surface water. When drawing from these surface water sources, avoid 
areas of likely contamination. If a small stream is the best option, increase its 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
43 
 
 
capacity to meet requirements by constructing small dams or reservoirs. See 
examples illustrated in Figure 3.1 through Figure 3.3. 
 
Figure 3.1. Improvised Dam for Impounding a Small Stream.

Figure 3.2. Improvised Small Dam (Side Profile). 
 
 
 
3.4.2. Surface Water Intakes. After confining natural water resources in a 
reservoir, use pumps or gravity pipelines to deliver it to the point of usage. Intakes 
provide a means of obtaining water from its source. Screen and carefully position 
intakes to avoid areas of likely contamination. Water at the intake point should be 
as clear and deep as possible. Install screens on all intakes regardless of water 
appearance. Screens keep fish and debris out of the water system. If muck or silt 
is prevalent on the bottom of the water source, a floating type intake is best. On 
the other hand, if the bottom is a bed of sand or gravel, surface intake with a screen 
may be equally effective and easier to use.

3.4.2.1. Floatable Intakes. While manufactured float buoys are part of the 
contingency water system, expedient floats made of logs, lumber, sealed cans, or 
empty fuel drums can support the intake strainer in deep water when other assets 
are not available. They are especially useful in large streams where the quality of 
water varies across its width or where water is not deep enough near the banks to 
cover the intake strainer. An adequate depth of water can cover the intake point 
by anchoring or stationing the float at the deep part of the stream. Secure the intake 
hose to the top of the float, allowing enough slack for movement of the float. If 
support lines secure the float to the banks, alter the position of the float to 
correspond to changes in depth by manipulating the lines. The chief advantage of 
a float intake is easy adjustments of the screen. Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
46 
 
 
illustrate two improvised intake floats. Note: Real world experience indicates 
placing the strainer on the suction hose of a floating intake at least 12 inches below 
the water level reduces the likelihood of clogging the strainer with floating debris, 
or the loss of prime from air entering the suction line. 
 
3.4.2.2. Rock and Stake Supported Intakes. If the stream is not too swift and the 
water is deep enough, an expedient intake may be prepared by placing the intake 
strainer on a rock. This will prevent clogging of the strainer by the streambed and 
provide enough water above to prevent sucking air into the intake pipe. If the 
water source is a small stream or shallow lake, secure the intake pipe to a post or 
pile as shown in Figure 3.6.

3.4.2.3. Pit Supported Intakes. When a stream is so shallow that at least 12 inches 
of water does not cover the intake screen, dig a pit and lay the screen on a rock or 
board placed at the bottom of the pit. Line those pits dug in streams with clay or 
silt bottoms with gravel to prevent dirt from entering the purification equipment 
(Figure 3.7). Surround the screen with gravel to prevent collapse of the sides of 
the pit and shields the screen from damage by large floating objects. The gravel 
also acts as a coarse strainer for the water. Enclosing the intake screen in a bucket 
or other container as shown in Figure 3.8 may also provide satisfactory results. 
 
3.4.2.4. Using Galleries with Intakes. Improve the water quality from muddy 
streams by digging intake galleries along the bank. Dig a trench along the bank 
deep enough so water from the stream percolates into it to intercept ground water 
flowing toward the stream. Fill the trench with gravel to prevent the sides from 
collapsing. Place the intake strainer in the gravel below the water line as shown 
in Figure 3.9. Although building a gallery requires some effort, this method 
reduces the chemicals needed to coagulate the water, decreases the need to 
frequently backwash the filter, and produces a higher quality water. 
 
3.4.2.5. Drive Points. Many times, it is advantageous to utilize shallow ground 
water sources or percolated waters adjacent to turbid surface water. Make well 
points in 2-inch diameter, 54-inch lengths. Place a drive cap over the thread and 
drive the well point into the ground with a sledge. Add successive sections of pipe, 
each 5 feet long, and drive into the ground until the screen is well within the water 
bearing media. Connect several well points in parallel to supply sufficient water 
to the raw water pump. Remember, when developing drive point sources, most 
small pumps only have about 15 feet of practical suction lift. In such situations, 
pumping water from well points deeper than a maximum of 20 feet is 
mechanically impractical. 
 
3.4.2.6. Self-Jetting Wellpoints. Self-jetting wellpoints uses forced water to jet the 
wellpoint into the sand, fluidizing the sand and allowing the wellpoint to sink 
easily into the sand. A water source is required to jet the wellpoint. See TO 40W4-
20-1, 1500, Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit, Subordinate Work Package 
(SWP) 007 01 for specific instructions on jetting wellpoints.

3.4.3. Springs and Seeps. A spring is water that naturally emerges at the surface 
with a distinctive current; the emerging water is a seep if there is no current. Most 
springs and seeps consist of water that has slowly gravitated from nearby higher 
ground. The water's underground course depends on the permeability and 
structure of the material it passes through. A spring with a temperature higher than 
the yearly average of a given region is termed a thermal spring and indicates a 
source of heat other than the surface climate. In gravity springs and seeps, 
subsurface water flows by gravity, not by hydrostatic pressure, from a high point 
of intake to a lower point of issue. Water table springs and seeps are normally 
around the margin of depressions, along the slope of valleys, and at the foot of 
alluvial fans. Contact springs appear along slopes, at almost any elevation 
depending on the position of the rock formations. Springs yielding 20 gallons per 
minute or more of water can be a source of field water supply if properly 
developed. A common method of development is to enlarge the outlet of the 
spring and reduce loss of water by damming it and conducting it to storage. To 
reduce possible pollution, clear the springs of all debris, undergrowth, topsoil, 
loose rocks, and sand. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
51 
 
 
3.4.3.1. Water Collection. Collect water that flows from rocks and accumulates in 
depressions or from seepage areas of water-bearing material in boxes or basins of 
wood, tile, or concrete. Place the collecting box (or spring box) below ground 
level so only the top is slightly above the surface and be large enough to capture 
most of the flow. Be sure to cover the box tightly to prevent contamination and 
lessen evaporation. Design the inlet to exclude surface drainage and prevent 
pollution. This may require fencing off the area and providing proper drainage. 
Figure 3.10 shows a spring inlet protected in this manner. The screen on the 
overflow pipe prevents insects and small animals from entering the spring. 
 
Figure 3.10. Collecting Box. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
52 
 
 
3.4.3.2. Dealing with Steep Slopes. Collect the flow of spring water from a steep 
slope of loose earth by constructing deep, narrow ditches leading from the spring 
to the collecting point, or by constructing pipeline tunnels from the spring to the 
collecting point. Large diameter pipe is desirable for this purpose. Trap the water 
from the pipeline tunnels by constructing a dam at the point of collection. 
 
3.4.3.3. Excavating. Digging is often better and more economical to develop a 
spring than blasting. Using explosives in spring development is usually not the 
ideal method, however, any use of explosives should proceed with great caution 
to prevent dislocating rocks or shifting sand and gravel in such a way as to stop 
the existing flow or divert the flow to another location. 
 
3.5. Ground Water Resources. A subsurface or ground water resource exists 
below Earth’s surface. Any water that collects or flows underground filling the 
porous spaces in the soil, sediment, and rocks is ground water. The water table is 
the upper surface of ground water. The water table is not a level surface, but it is 
irregular and reflects the surface features, rising high under the hills and falling 
back low under flat areas. Ground water can range from a few inches or feet below 
the ground’s surface (shallow ground water) to hundreds or thousands of feet deep 
in confined aquifers (Artesian water). 
 
3.5.1. Shallow Ground Water. Typically, shallow ground water is reachable by 
excavation with traditional hand tools (e.g. shovels, picks) or digging equipment. 
From the top of the water table, shallow ground water reside in near-surface, 
unconfined aquifers and often yield less quantity and lower quality water than 
deeper, confined aquifers. Although easier to access, lower quantities may render 
shallow water resources inadequate to sustain medium and large populations. 
Additionally, shallow ground water can require more extensive purification 
measures due to potential contamination from surface pollutants. 
 
3.5.2. Artesian Water. When water is confined below layers of relatively 
impermeable rock (under pressure), an artesian condition is said to exist. 
Specifically, there is a permeable aquifer with impervious layers above and below 
it to confine water. There should also be an intake area so water can enter the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
53 
 
 
aquifer and a structural dip has to exist to produce hydrostatic pressure in the 
water at lower areas of the aquifer. Whenever a natural outlet occurs in an artesian 
aquifer, it forms an artesian spring. While most springs may appear as pools of 
water, some springs may result when natural or human forces cut underground 
layers of soil and rock exposing flowing water. Drilling a well into an artesian 
aquifer creates an artesian well.  Figure 3.11 illustrates an artesian condition and 
artesian well. 
 
Figure 3.11. Artesian Condition and Well.

54 
 
 
3.6. Water Wells. Typically, engineers use wells to tap into ground water 
resources when surface water quantities are insufficient. Generally, there are five 
well classifications, according to their method of construction. They include dug, 
bored, driven, jetted, and drilled methods (Table 3.4). 
 
Table 3.4. Water Well Excavation Methods. 
 
Method 
Description 
Dug 
A dug well is one in which the excavation is made by the use of 
picks, shovels, spades, or digging equipment, such as sand buckets 
or clamshell buckets. 
Bored 
A bored well is one in which the excavation is made by the use of 
hand or power augers. 
Driven 
Construct a driven well by driving a pointed screen, referred to as 
a drive point, into the ground. Attach casings or lengths of pipe to 
the drive point as it is being driven into the ground. 
Jetted 
A jetted well is one in which the excavation is made by use of a 
high velocity jet of water. Steam is used for jetting instead of 
water in some regions of the Arctic. 
Drilled 
Excavate drilled wells by using either percussion or rotary drills. 
The excavated material is brought to the surface by means of a 
boiler, sand pump, suction bucket, hollow drill tool, or hydraulic 
pressure. 
 
3.6.1. Shallow Wells. Although not considered practical for sustaining a 
contingency airbase, shallow wells may be the only option available to fulfill 
needs for a small supply of potable water. Figure 3.12 shows a basic shallow well 
configuration with a manual pump. Personnel can dig rudimentary wells by hand 
and lined with stone, wooden timber, metal pipe or other materials available at the 
site. Hand dug wells should be large enough for access and shored to prevent cave-
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
55 
 
 
in during construction. Water retrieval is usually accomplished by bucket or hand 
pump. Obviously, low volume shallow wells are grossly inadequate when it 
comes to meeting the water needs of medium or large populations. To satisfy large 
potable water requirements, consider using BEAR assets to reach nearby surface 
water sources, or construct deep wells to obtain higher volumes of water. 
Additional information on well development and expedient excavation of shallow 
wells is in AFMAN 32-1072, Water-Well Drilling Operations. 
 
Figure 3.12. Basic Shallow Well Configuration with Manual Pump. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
56 
 
 
3.6.2. Artesian Wells. Drilling is usually associated with artesian or deep-well 
excavations. Specific RED HORSE units are equipped and trained to accomplish 
well-drilling tasks. If an artesian well has enough pressure to bring water above 
ground, it is a flowing artesian well; if water rises only to an intermediate level it 
is a non-flowing artesian well (Figure 3.13). Although some artesian wells can 
produce significant volumes of potable water, most only provide limited amounts. 
If a discovered well is satisfactory, simply install a wellhead and move the water 
to storage facilities. 
 
Figure 3.13. Aquifers and Wells. 
 
 
 
3.7. Expedient Water Storage. During initial force beddown operations, items 
such as portable water tanks, onion bladders, and improvised methods are options 
for expedient water storage. The examples shown in Figure 3.14 and Figure 3.15 
are simple, field-expedient water storage concepts that can be implemented using 
local resources when no other assets are available. Flexible bladders, water 
distribution trucks and trailers, and even sandbag or earthen berms lined with 
plastic sheeting are other possible alternatives worth considering. Regardless of 
storage methods used, ensure they are large enough to meet daily peak demands. 
To prevent potential sabotage by clandestine groups, storage facilities should be 
located well within the secure area of the base.

3.8. Water Treatment. Treat water sources according to established procedures 
and standards to ensure they are potable before use. The degree of treatment 
provided to the water supply will usually depend upon its source. For example, 
ground water is normally free of contaminants such as silt and microorganisms 
and treatment is normally minor. Surface water may require extensive treatment. 
Regardless, test all water to determine treatment required and ensure it is potable 
after treatment. Assume water from untested sources is contaminated, and 
requires disinfection before drinking.  
 
3.8.1. Field water treatment processes include straining; chemical addition; 
coagulation; sedimentation; various kinds of filtration including multimedia, 
cartridge, microfiltration, and ultrafiltration; reverse osmosis (RO); carbon 
adsorption; and ion exchange. Currently, most water purification systems in U.S. 
military service use RO membranes to provide the ultimate barrier to chemical, 
microbial, organic, and radiological contaminants. The AF primarily uses the 
1500 ROWPU and chlorination for field water treatment. Review T.O. 40W4-20-
1, 1500 Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), for information on 
water purification procedures. 
 
3.8.2 When cut off from supply lines and military-approved water is not available, 
select the clearest and cleanest water with the least odor available, and treat the 
water by boiling or using iodine tablets, Chlor-Floc dry calcium hypochlorite, 
household bleach (sodium hypochlorite solution), or the Marine Corps-approved 
individual water purification system (IWPS). Consult AFMAN 48-138 for details 
on the use of these and other field water treatment guidelines. 
 
3.9. Summary. For austere location beddowns, drinking water is at the forefront 
of operational planning. Installation commanders take measures to ensure water 
sources are developed and potable water is readily available. It is a fundamental 
requirement for CE to develop field water sources and produce potable water 
whenever needed. The methods presented in this chapter are expedient options to 
provide this capability. For additional information on developing and treating raw 
water sources, consult the references listed in Table 3.5.

EXPEDIENT SEWAGE AND WASTEWATER DISPOSAL 
 
4.1. Overview. Generally, CE establishes a temporary sanitary sewer system 
where none exists or when expeditious repairs to existing systems is not feasible. 
Expedient sewage and wastewater disposal methods are potential options at 
austere contingency locations until prepackaged systems become available. In 
some situations, expedient systems such as septic tanks, ponds, and lagoons may 
be required for extended periods. This chapter addresses expedient sewage and 
wastewater disposal methods, including site evaluations and employment of 
septic tanks and absorption fields, seepage pits, sewage lagoons, evaporation 
beds, kitchen soakage pits and trenches, and grease traps. Some disposal methods 
such as grease traps and septic tanks may suffice as temporary replacement 
measures for damaged or missing components on a short-term basis. Additional 
information is available in AFH 10-222V4, UFC 3-240-02, Domestic Wastewater 
Treatment, UFC 3-230-03, and EPA 625/1-80-012, Onsite Wastewater Treatment 
and Disposal Systems, at http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/septic/technical.cfm. 
 
4.2. Site Evaluations. Engineers usually accomplished a thorough site survey 
before installing an expedient or temporary sewage or wastewater disposal 
system. The survey includes evaluating the proposed site’s land area, terrain, and 
soil conditions for suitability; noting the location of existing utilities, wells, storm 
sewers, future use areas, and other important features. Typically, engineers 
address some of these survey elements during preliminary site studies, 
geotechnical investigation, or topographic survey of the area. Therefore, be sure 
to review any previously accomplished site surveys that may be available. Also, 
examine historical geological conditions, including year-round data for 
environmental extremes and drainage or flooding issues. 
 
4.2.1. Terrain. Perform a visual examination of the terrain in and around the 
potential site. Be sure to examine landscape position for surface and subsurface 
drainage patterns. Hilltops and side slopes will probably have good surface and 
subsurface drainage, while depressions and foot slopes will likely have poor 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
62 
 
 
drainage. If slopes appear to limit planned treatment systems, survey the area to 
determine slope measurement, likely effects, and potential options. 
  
4.2.2. Soil Conditions. Review pertinent soil data from published sources and 
examine soil characteristics for the potential absorption area. Evaluate the soil’s 
texture, structure, color, density, and hydraulic conductivity. Excavate tests shafts 
and test pits to investigate soils in situ. Also, use these excavations to determine 
the depth to groundwater, and thickness of topsoil. In some situations, the 
examination of road cuts or foundation excavations will provide useful 
information. 
 
4.2.2.1. It is common to excavate test shafts with hand tools (e.g., shovel, posthole 
digger, or solid auger with an extension handle), while backhoes are often use to 
excavate test pits. An experienced soils tester can do a satisfactory job using a test 
shaft excavated with a hand auger or probe; however, observation and evaluation 
of soil characteristics is better from larger test pits dug by a backhoe or other 
excavating equipment. The best approach may be to use both test shafts and test 
pits. However, be aware that test pits used within the absorption area can settle 
after the treatment system has been installed, disrupting the distribution network. 
Therefore, use backhoes to excavate test pits at the perimeter of the expected soil 
absorption area where settling will be less disruptive. Hand augers can make 
multiple test shafts within the absorption area with little to no disruption. In both 
cases, excavations help describe soils in the area. Be sure to excavate deep enough 
to assure sufficient thickness of unsaturated soil exists below the absorption area. 
If a detailed analysis of the soil structure is necessary, the sidewall of test pits 
should be carefully examined using a pick or similar tool to expose the soil’s 
natural cleavages and planes of weakness. 
 
4.2.2.2. Soil texture is an important physical property of soil because of its close 
relationship to pore size, distribution, and continuity. Soil structure has a 
significant influence on soil’s acceptance and transmission of water. Soil structure 
refers to the aggregation of soil particles into clusters of particles separated by 
surfaces of weaknesses. These surfaces of weakness often result in voids or cracks 
in soil, which can greatly modify the influence of soil texture on water movement. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
63 
 
 
Well-structured soils with large voids between clusters will transmit water more 
rapidly than structureless soils of the same texture. Table 4.1 lists the textural 
properties of mineral soils. Table 4.2 is a listing of various grades and 
characteristics of soil structure. 
 
Table 4.1. Textural Properties of Mineral Soils. 
 
Soil 
Type 
Texture and Appearance 
Dry Soil 
Moist Soil 
Sand 
Loose, single grains, that feels 
gritty. Squeezed in the hand, the 
soil mass falls apart when the 
pressure is released. 
Squeezed in the hand, it forms a 
cast that crumbles when touched. 
Does not form a ribbon between 
thumb and forefinger. 
Sandy 
Loam 
Aggregates easily crushed; very 
faint velvety feeling initially but 
with continued rubbing the gritty 
feeling of sand soon dominates. 
Forms a cast that bears careful 
handling without breaking. Does 
not form a ribbon between thumb 
and forefinger. 
Loam Aggregates are crushed under 
moderate pressure; clods can be 
quite firm. When pulverized, 
loam has velvety feel that 
becomes gritty with continued 
rubbing. Casts bear careful 
handling. 
Cast can be handled quite freely 
without breaking. Very slight 
tendency to ribbon between 
thumb and forefinger. Rubbed 
surface is rough. 
Silt 
Loam 
Aggregates are firm but may be 
crushed under moderate pressure. 
Clods are firm to hard. Smooth, 
flour-like feel dominates when 
soil is pulverized. 
Cast can be freely handled 
without breaking. Slight 
tendency to ribbon between 
thumb and forefinger. Rubbed 
surface has a broken or rippled 
appearance.

64 
 
 
Clay 
Loam 
Very firm aggregates and hard 
clods that strongly resist crushing 
by hand. When pulverized, the 
soil takes on a somewhat gritty 
feeling due to the harshness of 
the very small aggregates, which 
persist. 
Cast can bear much handling 
without breaking. Pinched 
between the thumb and 
forefinger, it forms a ribbon 
whose surface tends to feel 
slightly gritty when dampened 
and rubbed. Soil is plastic, sticky 
and puddles easily. 
Clay 
Aggregates are hard; clods are 
extremely hard and strongly 
resist crushing by hand. When 
pulverized, it has a grit-like 
texture due to the harshness of 
numerous, very small aggregates, 
which persist. 
Casts can bear considerable 
handling without breaking. 
Forms a flexible ribbon between 
thumb and forefinger and retains 
its plasticity when elongated. 
Rubbed surface has a very 
smooth, satin feeling. Sticky 
when wet and easily puddled. 
 
Table 4.2. Grades of Soil Structure. 
 
Grade 
Characteristics 
Structureless No observable aggregation. 
Weak 
Poorly formed and difficult to see; will not retain shape on 
handling. 
Moderate 
Evident but not distinct in undisturbed soil, moderately 
durable on handling. 
Strong 
Visually distinct in undisturbed soil, durable on handling. 
 
4.2.2.3. The color and color patterns in soil are good indicators of its drainage 
characteristics. Soil properties, location in landscape, and climate influence water 
movement in soil. These factors cause some soils to be saturated or seasonally 
saturated, affecting their ability to absorb and treat wastewater. Interpretation of 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
65 
 
 
soil color aids in identifying these conditions. Soil density is another important 
characteristic. Soil bulk density relates to porosity and the movement of water. 
High bulk density indicates low porosity and restricted water flow. Detect relative 
bulk densities of different soil horizons by pushing a knife or other instrument 
into each horizon. If one horizon offers considerably more resistance to 
penetration than the others, its bulk density is probably higher. However, in some 
situations, cementing agents between soil grains or soil clusters may be the cause 
of resistance to penetration. 
 
4.2.2.4. In addition to field evaluations, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) offers substantial data 
and resources on global soil conditions. Attachment 2 provides the link to the 
NRCS website along with links to engineer reachback and other useful sites. 
 
4.2.3. Percolation Tests. If subsurface investigation indicates soil may be suitable 
for a planned subsurface absorption treatment system, conduct percolation tests 
to estimate the percolation rates (liquid absorption) of the soil; determine the 
acceptability of the site; and serve as the basis of design for liquid absorption. 
Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2 illustrate how to construct floating and fixed indicator 
percometers, respectively. Perform a minimum of three percolation tests within 
the planned area of the absorption field. Position tests uniformly throughout the 
absorption field. If soil conditions are highly variable, more tests may be required. 
Perform tests as indicated in the following paragraphs. For additional information 
on percolation test procedures, consult EPA 625/1-80-012. 
 
4.2.3.1. Preparation of Test Hole. Dig or bore 6- to 9-inch diameter test holes to 
the proposed depths of absorption system or most limiting soil horizon. To expose 
a natural soil surface, scratch sides of the hole with a sharp pointed instrument 
and remove the loose material from the bottom of the hole. Place two inches of 
coarse sand or fine gravel in the hole to protect the bottom from scouring action 
when adding water.

4.2.3.2. Presoak the Soil. Carefully fill the hole with at least 12 inches of clear 
water; maintain this depth for at least 4 hours and preferably overnight. In most 
soils, it will be necessary to augment the water as time progresses. A funnel with 
an attached hose or similar device may prevent water from washing down the 
sides of the hole. For accurate results, it is important the soil soak for a sufficient 
period to allow it to swell. Note: In sandy soils with little or no clay, soaking is 
not necessary. If, after filling the hole twice with 12 inches of water, the water 
seeps completely away in less than ten minutes, the percolation test can proceed. 
 
4.2.3.3. Measurement of Percolation Rate. Except for sandy soils, perform 
percolation rate measurements between 15 and 30 hours after the soaking period 
began. Remove any soil that sloughed into the hole during the soaking period and 
adjust the water level to 6 inches above the gravel (or 8 inches above the bottom 
of the hole). Do not allow the water level to rise more than 6 inches above the 
gravel. Immediately after adjustment, measure the water level from a fixed 
reference point to the nearest 1/16 inch at 30-minute intervals. Continue testing 
until two successive water level drops do not vary more than 1/16 inch. Make at 
least three measurements. After each measurement, adjust the water level to 6 
inches. Use the last water level drop to calculate the percolation rate. In sandy 
soils or soils where the first 6 inches of water added after the soaking period seeps 
away in less than 30 minutes, measure water level at 10-minute intervals for a 1-
hour period. Use the last water level drop to calculate percolation rate. 
 
4.2.3.4. Calculation of the Percolation Rate. Calculate the percolation rate for each 
test hole by dividing the time interval between measurements by the magnitude 
of the last water level drop. For example, if the last measured drop in water level 
after 30 minutes was 11/16 inch, calculate the percolation rate as shown below. 
Be sure to record and track the percolation test data (Figure 4.3). 
 
Last measured water drop: 11/16 in. drop in 30 min. = 30 min. / 11/16 in. 
Convert 11/16 in. to decimal (Numerator / Denominator) (11 ÷ 16) = 0.6875 in. 
Calculated rate/min: 30 min/in. / 0.6875 in. or (30 ÷ 0.6875) = 43.63 
Percolation rate:  ≈ 44 min/in.

4.2.3.5. Although hydraulic conductivity of specific soils is consistent, the actual 
soil percolation test can produce widely varying results. Data in EPA 625/1-80-
012 indicates percolation tests conducted in the same soils can vary by 90 percent 
or more. Attribute this large variability to the procedures used, soil moisture 
conditions at the time of the test, and individuals performing the test. Despite these 
shortcomings, the percolation test results can be useful, especially when combined 
with soil excavation data. Use the test to rank the relative hydraulic conductivity 
of the soil. Table 4.3 lists estimated percolation rates for various soil textures.

4.3. Expedient Septic System. This system is a temporary, simple, and relatively 
economical means to treat and dispose of domestic wastewater for initial arriving 
forces or small unit deployments. It can provide sewage treatment and wastewater 
disposal at austere contingency locations. If soil conditions permit, use subsurface 
absorption after septic tank treatment. As illustrated in Figure 4.4, the basic 
configuration consists of a septic tank and absorption field (sometimes referred to 
as a leach field or drain field). However, if land, terrain features, and soil 
conditions are not favorable, use a seepage pit, sand filter system, or other disposal 
method in lieu of an absorption field. The expedient septic system is frequently 
the preferred wastewater treatment and disposal method because of its moderately 
low maintenance, configuration flexibility, and comparatively small real estate 
requirement. Consult EPA 625/1-80-012 and AFH 10-222V4 for more data on 
wastewater treatment procedures.

Figure 4.4. Basic Low-Flow Septic System. 
 
 
 
4.3.1. Septic Tanks. Most low-flow septic system designs are basic. Septic tanks 
usually have one or two compartments. Single-compartment tanks give an 
acceptable performance. However, multi-compartment tanks perform somewhat 
better than single-compartment tanks of the same total capacity. The multi-
compartment tanks provide better protection against solids carrying over into 
discharge pipes during periods of surges or upset due to rapid digestion. 
 
4.3.1.1. The material used for septic tank construction vary (e.g., concrete, 
fiberglass, polyethylene); however, the most commonly used material is concrete. 
The walls usually have a thickness of 3 to 4 inches. Plastic and fiberglass tanks 
are lightweight, easily transported, and resistant to corrosion and decay. They also 
minimize the chance of damage during installation. 
 
4.3.1.2. Septic tank design should ensure removal of almost all settleable solids. 
To accomplish this, the tank must provide: 
 
• 
Liquid volume sufficient for a 24-hour fluid retention time at maximum 
sludge depth and scum accumulation 
• 
Inlet and outlet devices that prevent the discharge of sludge or scum in 
the effluent 
• 
Sufficient sludge storage space to prevent the discharge of sludge or 
scum in effluent 
• 
Venting to allow accumulated methane and hydrogen sulfide gases to 
escape 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
72 
 
 
4.3.1.3. The design of septic tank inlet should dissipate energy of incoming water 
and minimize turbulence. The inlet should preferably be a sanitary tee or have a 
baffle to prevent solids from blocking the inlet pipe. The position of septic tank 
outlet pipe is lower than the inlet pipe to help prevent sewage from backing up 
into the sewer line. As illustrated in Figure 4.5, septic tank outlets can be a tee or 
have baffles and other special structures installed. Gas deflection baffles and 
wedges prevent gas-disturbed sludge from entering the rising leg of the outlet. 
 
Figure 4.5. Septic Tank Outlet Structures. 
 
 
 
4.3.1.4. Septic tank settling and digestion functions are effective in treating up to 
300 population equivalents of waste (a population equivalent is approximately 
100 to 120 gallons [380 to 450L] per capita per day of domestic strength 
wastewater). However, septic tanks should only be used for population 
equivalents up to 25 (3,000 gal.), unless septic tanks are the most economical 
solution for larger populations. Minimum tank size is usually 500 gallons (1,900-
L). The length-to-width ratio should be between 2:1 and 3:1, and the liquid depth 
should be between 4 and 6 feet (see Figure 4.6). The septic tank size should 
provide required detention (below the operating liquid level) for the designed 
daily flow plus an additional 25 percent capacity for sludge storage. Refer to UFC 
3-240-02 when determining wastewater design flows. When effluent is disposed 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
73 
 
 
of in subsurface absorption fields or leaching pits, 24 hours detention time based 
on average flows is required; reduction to 18 hours permitted if secondary 
treatment provided, such as a subsurface sand filter or an oxidation pond. Open 
sand filter treatment can further reduce detention time to 10 to 12 hours. See 
additional treatment methods later in this section. 
 
4.3.1.5. The function of a septic tank is relatively simple. Wastewater flows into 
the septic tank through the sewer distribution or inlet pipe. Heavier solids in the 
wastewater settle to the bottom of the tank forming a sludge layer. Lighter solids 
(including grease and oils) float to the surface forming a scum layer. This leaves 
a clarified wastewater layer in the middle of the tank. The clarified liquid 
discharges through the tank’s outlet pipe to an absorption field or other treatment 
and disposal system. Note: Facility users should not discharge grease and non-
biodegradable products into septic systems because they can clog system 
components. 
 
4.3.1.6. Over time, natural processes decompose some of the sludge and scum in 
septic tanks. However, personnel will eventually need to pump the accumulated 
solids from the tank. If garbage grinders are used, the grinders will increase the 
settleable and floatable solids in the wastewater and the accumulation of solids in 
the septic tank. Studies indicate the increase in sludge and scum accumulation 
rates are approximately 37 percent when using garbage grinders. The increase in 
accumulation will require more frequent pumping or a larger tank to keep the 
pumping frequency down. A common expedient response is to add 250 gallons to 
the tank size when using garbage grinders, although this volume is arbitrary. It is 
generally a good idea to avoid the use of garbage grinders with septic tank 
systems.

4.3.1.7. When installing septic tanks, the most important requirement is to place 
tanks on a level grade and at a depth that provides adequate gravity flow from the 
facility and matches the invert elevation of the facility’s sewer. Place tanks on 
undisturbed soil so that settling does not occur. If the excavation is too deep, 
backfill to the proper elevation with sand to provide an adequate bedding for the 
tank. If tank position does not remain level, the inlet and outlet structures will not 
function properly and tank performance will be impaired. Be sure to seal the tank 
for water tightness after installation with two coats of bituminous coating. Also, 
seal around the inlet and outlet pipes with a bonding compound that will adhere 
both to concrete and the inlet and outlet pipes. Other considerations include: 
 
• 
Use cast iron inlet/outlet structures in tanks used in disturbed soil areas 
where tank settling may occur 
• 
Use flotation collars in areas with high groundwater potential 
• 
Place tank so the manhole is slightly below grade to prevent accidental 
entry 
• 
Place tank in an area with easy access to alleviate pump-out problems 
• 
Repair any damage to watertight coating during installation; test the 
tank for water tightness after installation by filling it with water 
• 
During installation in areas with large rocks, take care to prevent undue 
localized stresses on the tank 
• 
Baffles, tees, and elbows should be made of durable and corrosion-
proof materials; fiberglass or acid-resistant concrete baffle materials are 
most suitable; vitrified clay tile, plastic, and cast iron are best for tees 
and elbows 
 
4.3.1.8. It is probably a good idea to place manholes over the inlet and outlet to 
allow personnel to access and inspect the septic tank, and permit cleaning behind 
the baffles or tees. The manhole cover should extend above the actual septic tank 
to a height not more than 6 inches below the finished grade. The actual cover can 
extend to the ground surface if a proper seal prevents escape of odors and 
accidental tank entry. Because the tank is below ground, soil removal from over 
the access cover is necessary before tank-cleaning operations. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
76 
 
 
4.3.1.9. Normally, septic tanks are the first component of an onsite treatment 
system, followed by additional treatment or disposal units. In most instances, 
septic tank effluent is discharged to a soil absorption system (trench, bed, or 
leaching well) where wastewater percolates down through the soil. In areas where 
soils are not suitable for percolation, septic tank effluent may discharge to 
evapotranspiration (ET) beds for treatment and disposal, or to sand filters or 
lagoons for further treatment. 
 
4.3.2. Absorption Fields. In subsurface soil absorption systems, the pretreatment 
unit (i.e., septic tank) should remove nearly all settleable solids and floatable 
grease and scum so a reasonably clear liquid discharges into the soil absorption 
field. Absorption fields (i.e., drain field or leach field) distribute effluent from the 
septic tank and normally consist of several perforated distribution pipes laid in 
trenches or beds filled with rock. The distribution box (usually a reinforced 
concrete structure) distributes the septic tank effluent evenly throughout the 
absorption field via distribution pipes. The absorption field treats the wastewater 
by allowing it to slowly trickle from the pipes out into the gravel and down 
through the soil. The gravel and soil act as biological filters. This section 
addresses absorption fields in the form of trenches or beds. Absorption trenches 
and beds are excavations of relatively large areas; see Table 4.4 and consult EPA 
625/1-80-012 to review site criteria for these systems. 
 
4.3.2.1. Absorption Trenches. Absorption trenches are usually shallow, level 
excavations, typically 1 to 5 feet deep and 1 to 3 feet wide (Figure 4.7). Fill trench 
bottoms with a minimum of 6 inches of 3/4 to 2-1/2-inch rock or gravel. Lay the 
perforated distribution pipe on top of this rock; carefully place more rock over the 
pipe network, and then use a semipermeable membrane or barrier over the rock 
layer to prevent backfill from clogging the drainage zone (Figure 4.8). 
Distribution pipes may be spaced as close as 2 feet if the rock beneath is deep, the 
subsoil porous, and distance to bedrock greater than 4 feet. Generally, distribution 
pipelines are 3 to 6 feet apart laterally and are no longer than 100 feet.

Soil: 
  Texture 
 
Soils with sandy or loamy textures are best. Gravelly

soils with open pores and slowly permeable clay soils are less 
desired.

Strong granular, blocky or prismatic structures are desirable. 
Platy or unstructured massive soils should be avoided. 
Color 
Bright uniform colors indicate well-drained, well-aerated 
soils. Dull, gray, or mottled soils indicate continuous or 
seasonal saturation and are unsuitable. 
Layering 
Soils exhibiting layers with distinct textural or structural 
changes should be carefully evaluated to ensure water 
movement will not be severely restricted. 
Unsaturated 
Depth 
2 to 4 feet of unsaturated soil should exist between the bottom 
of the system and the seasonally high water table or bedrock. 
Percolation

4.3.2.2. Absorption Beds. Absorption beds differ from trenches in that they are 
wider than 3 feet and may contain more than one line of distribution piping 
(Figure 4.9). Absorption beds can be as wide as needed, based on the total area 
needed for absorption. 
 
Figure 4.9. Absorption Bed. 
 
 
 
4.3.3. Seepage Pits. Although absorption fields are generally preferred, site 
characteristics and cost considerations may encourage the use of a seepage pit 
(aka leaching well or leaching tank). Specifically, seepage pits may be advisable 
when the land area is too limited for trench or bed systems, and either the 
groundwater level is deep at all times or the upper 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) of the 
soil profile is underlain by a more permeable unsaturated soil material of great 
depth. Generally, seepage pits are an option for septic tank effluent disposal where 
subsoil is porous. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
80 
 
 
4.3.3.1. Illustrated in Figure 4.10 is a two-seepage pit layout fed through open 
joint lines coming from a distribution box. Wastewater enters the chamber where 
it is stored until it seeps out through the chamber wall and infiltrates the sidewall 
of the excavation. The bottom of the seepage pit should be at least 4 feet above 
seasonal high water table. Maintaining sufficient separation between the bottom 
of the seepage pit and the high water table is an important consideration for 
protection of groundwater quality. Pit construction using masonry blocks or stone 
with lateral openings and gravel outside prevents sand from entering the pit. 
However, other material (i.e., stones, bricks, tiles) may also be used. Figure 4.11 
shows a small seepage pit made using a stone wall.

81 
 
 
Figure 4.11. Small Seepage Pit (Stone Wall). 
 
 
 
4.3.3.2. Siting criteria for seepage pits are similar to those for trench and bed 
systems summarized in Table 4.4. Reserve an additional area at the site for 
installing more pits should it become necessary. Because the excavation sidewall 
is the main infiltrative surface for seepage pits, run percolation tests in each soil 
layer encountered in pit excavation to determine overall percolation rate. A 
weighted average of the percolation test results (sum of thickness times 
percolation rate of each layer divided by the total thickness) is used. Generally, 
exclude soils with percolation rates slower than 30 min/in. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
82 
 
 
4.3.3.3. Seepage pits may be any diameter or depth provided they are structurally 
sound. Pit construction is possible without seriously damaging the soil. Typically, 
seepage pits are 6 to 12 feet in diameter and 10 to 20 feet deep, but engineers have 
constructed pits 18 inches in diameter and 40 feet deep. If more than one seepage 
pit is required, space pits at intervals 2 to 3 times the diameter of the pit from 
sidewall to sidewall. Figure 4.12 illustrates a typical seepage pit plan and basic 
construction details. 
 
Figure 4.12. Seepage Pit Plan Construction Details. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
83 
 
 
4.3.3.4. Dig pits with conventional excavating equipment or with power augers. 
Ensure soils are not too wet before starting construction. If powered bucket augers 
are used, widen pits to a larger diameter than the bucket to minimize compaction 
and smearing of the soil. Use power screw augers in granular soils because 
smearing of the sidewall is difficult to prevent with such equipment. 
 
4.3.3.5. To maximize wastewater storage, porous walled chambers without 
bottoms are typically used. Common options include precast concrete seepage 
chambers, chambers made of clay, or concrete brick blocks or rings. Rings must 
have notches to provide for seepage. Lay bricks or blocks without mortar and with 
staggered open joints. If laying hollow block on its side, maintain a 4-inch wall 
thickness. Large-diameter perforated pipe standing on end are options for small 
diameter pits. Place 6 to 12 inches of clean gravel or 3/4 to 2-l/2 inch crushed rock 
at the bottom of the excavation prior to placement or construction of the chamber. 
This provides a firm foundation for the chamber and prevents removal of bottom 
soil if the pit requires pumping. Construct the chamber 1 to 2 feet smaller in 
diameter than the excavation. Fill the annular space left between the wall of the 
chamber and the excavation with clean gravel or crushed rock to the top of the 
chamber. 
 
4.3.3.6. Place covers of suitable strength over the chamber and extend at least 12 
inches beyond the excavation to support the soil cover and any anticipated loads. 
Use a manhole to provide access to large pits for inspection purposes. If a manhole 
is used, cover it with 6 to 12 inches of soil. An inspection pipe can extend to 
ground surface. Use a noncorrosive, watertight cap with the inspection pipe. A 
well-designed and constructed seepage pit requires no routine maintenance, 
although a failure occasionally occurs. Pumping and resting is the only reasonable 
rehabilitation technique available. 
 
4.3.4. Intermittent Sand Filters. With some soil conditions, an absorption field 
or seepage pit may not be a viable option. If soil tests indicate percolation rates 
are very high, intermittent sand filters (ISF) may be more appropriate. ISFs are 
well suited to onsite wastewater treatment and disposal. The process is highly 
efficient and usually requires minimal operation and maintenance support. The 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
84 
 
 
basic components of an ISF system are a primary treatment unit (septic tank or 
other sedimentation system), distribution network, and a sand filter (Figure 4.13). 
Other components may include a dosing tank, pump and controls (or siphon), and 
a disinfection tank. ISFs normally treat effluents from septic tanks and potentially 
followed by disinfection prior to reuse or disposal to land or surface waters. 
 
4.3.4.1. ISFs may be single-pass, bottomless, or recirculating sand filters (RSF). 
Although mostly buried partially or completely in the ground, ISFs built above 
the ground (open filter) is an option to avoid bedrock or a high water table. The 
ISF treatment method provides secondary treatment in three ways; filtration, 
chemical sorption, and assimilation (see Table 4.5). Treatment begins by applying 
wastewater intermittently to the surface of the bed through distribution pipes or 
troughs. Wastewater filters through the granular medium where it collects in the 
underdrain and then discharged. This technique is one of the oldest known 
treatment methods and if designed, constructed, and operated properly, it 
produces high quality effluent. 
 
4.3.4.2. Typically, ISF treatment beds consist of granular materials and underlain 
by graded gravel and collecting pipe. Although sand is commonly the medium 
used as the granular material, anthracite, garnet, ilmenite sand, mineral tailings, 
bottom ash, etc., are also options. The granular material used should be durable 
and insoluble in water. Any clay, loam, limestone, or organic material may 
increase the initial absorption capacity of the sand, but may lead to serious 
clogging conditions as the filter ages. 
 
4.3.4.3. Early ISF designs had filter bed depths between 4 to 10 feet. However, 
later studies indicated most of the wastewater purification occurred within the top 
9 to 12 inches of the bed. Additional bed depth did not improve wastewater 
purification to any significant degree. Today, media depths generally range 
between 24 to 42 inches. Shallow filter beds helps save time and resources during 
construction. Conversely, deeper beds tend to produce a more constant effluent 
quality, less affected by rainfall or snowmelt, and permit the removal of more 
media before replacement becomes necessary.

4.3.4.4. Buried ISF. Illustrated in Figure 4.14 is a typical profile of a subsurface 
sand filter. Build the filter in the ground with a natural topsoil cover in excess of 
10 inches over the crown of the distribution pipes. The filter should be carefully 
constructed after excavation and granular fill settled by flooding. Construct 
distribution and underdrain lines of an acceptable material with a minimum 
diameter of 4 inches. If tile pipes are used, the tile is normally laid with open joint 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018

sections spaced between 1/4- to 1/2-inches apart. If continuous pipeline is used, 
conventional perforated pipe provides adequate distribution and collection of 
wastewater within the filter. Surround the distribution and underdrain lines with 
at least 8 inches of washed durable gravel or crushed stone. For distribution lines, 
the gravel or stone is usually smaller than 2-1/2-inch, but larger than 3/4-inch; the 
size range of the gravel or stone for the underdrain is between 1-1/2 to 1/4-inch. 
Slopes of underdrain pipe range from 0.5 to 1%. Table 4.6 summarizes the design 
criteria for buried ISFs.

4.3.4.5. Free Access ISF. The free access ISF has open or free access to the surface 
of the filter. Built often within the natural soil, constructing it completely above 
the ground surface is an option. As illustrated in Figure 4.15, free access ISFs are 
usually surrounded by sidewalls, often of masonry construction, to prevent earth 
from washing into the filters and to confine the flow of wastewater. 
 
Figure 4.15. Free Access ISF (Profile). 
 
 
 
4.3.4.5.1. If necessary, cover filters to protect against severe weather conditions, 
and to avoid encroachment of weeds and animals. The cover also serves to reduce 
odor conditions. Build covers with treated wooden planks, galvanized metal, or 
other suitable material. Screens or hardware cloth (metal mesh material) mounted 
on wooden frames may also serve to protect filter surfaces. Insulate the covers 
where weather conditions dictate. Be sure to allow a space of 12-24 inches 
between the cover and sand surface.

4.3.4.5.2. The media characteristics of free access ISFs are similar to buried 
filters. The design of the pipeline distribution system directs effluent onto splash 
plates located at the center or corners of the sand surface (Figure 4.16). However, 
troughs or spray nozzles sometimes distribute effluent onto the sand surface. Filter 
maintenance usually involves resting the clogged filter; therefore most free access 
ISF systems have dual filters. Table 4.7 lists other design measures and criteria.

4.3.4.6. Recirculating ISF. The recirculating ISF is a free access ISF with a 
recirculation (dosing) tank between the pretreatment unit (e.g., septic tank) and 
the filter (Figure 4.17). The recirculation tank incorporates a pump to recycle 
sand filtered effluent and septic tank overflow. The pump pushes the wastewater 
mixture to the filter surface. Normally submersible and rated for 1/3 horsepower, 
the pump should be sized to empty the recirculation tank in less than 20 minutes. 
The strength and material of recirculating tanks is comparable to septic tanks. Its 
size is normally 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the septic tank (or a volume equivalent to at 
least on day’s volume of raw wastewater flow). The tank should be easily 
accessible to accomplish maintenance of the recirculation pump, valves, timers, 
etc. Table 4.8 lists additional design measures and criteria.

4.3.5. Lagoons. Lagoons are a cost-effective method of wastewater treatment. 
Sometimes referred to as ponds, lagoons can treat a variety of wastewaters, from 
domestic wastewater to complex industrial waters. Mostly used in smaller 
communities for domestic wastewater treatment, lagoons are well suited for 
remote wastewater treatment at locations where land is readily available and 
skilled labor is limited. When used at contingency bases, lagoons should meet 
combatant command (CCMD) design, construction, and use requirements. 
Lagoons are classified by the dominant type of biological reaction that occurs 
(i.e., aerobic, anaerobic, facultative, aerated), duration and frequency of 
discharge, extent of treatment ahead of the pond, or their arrangement (if more 
than one is used). Use lagoons alone or in combination with other treatment 
methods and systems. A lagoon system may have several cells with varying 
degrees of organic loading and biological reactions. Liquid disposal occurs by 
percolation and evaporation or by separate infiltration bed. The pH levels may 
require adjustment to help control odors. While lagoons vary in size, depth, 
construction, and operation, all treatment and storage lagoons should have at least 
two feet of freeboard. Figure 4.18 illustrates alternative flow patterns for lagoon 
systems with different cells and stages of treatment. Table 4.9 lists the advantages 
and disadvantages of using lagoons. Although lagoon types and classifications 
vary, common design considerations include the following: 
 
• 
Sewage waste volume 
• 
Site location 
• 
Distance to dwelling, etc. 
• 
Depth to groundwater or bedrock 
• 
Distance to surface water 
• 
Depth of liquid, surface area 
• 
Climate 
• 
Aquifer characteristics 
• 
Monitoring wells 
• 
Solids removal and disposal

Lagoons 
Advantages 
Disadvantages 
Low cost 
Simple operation

Possible vector problem 
Soil clogging may stop percolation 
Effluent may require additional treatment 
 
4.3.5.1. Aerobic. Generally, aerobic lagoon systems treat effluent from other 
processes. Aerobic lagoon systems maintain dissolved oxygen throughout their 
entire depth and are mostly limited to warm sunny climates. Sometimes referred 
to as shallow oxidation ponds because of their narrow depth (usually 12 to 18 
inches) and oxygenated biological activity. The chief advantage of the high-rate 
aerobic pond is that it produces a stable effluent with low land and energy 
requirements and short detention times (between 5 to 20 days). However, 
operation is somewhat more complex than for a facultative pond. In addition, 
unless provided an algae removal step, the effluent will contain high-suspended 
solids. Short detention times also mean very little coliform die-off will result. 
Because of their shallow depths, paving or covering the bottom of the ponds is 
required to prevent weed growth. 
 
4.3.5.2. Anaerobic. Anaerobic lagoons have no aerobic zone because they receive 
such a heavy organic loading; fermentation occurs in the absence of oxygen. 
Anaerobic systems typically treat strong industrial and agricultural wastes. In 
most situations, follow-on treatment is required. This type of lagoon system may 
pretreat industrial waste if waste is a significant contributor to domestic systems. 
They are usually 8 to 16 feet deep and have detention times of 20 to 50 days. An 
important disadvantage of anaerobic ponds is the production of odorous 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
96 
 
 
compounds. Sodium nitrate combats these odors, but is expensive and in some 
cases has not proven effective. Another common approach is to recirculate water 
from a downstream facultative or aerobic pond to maintain a thin aerobic layer at 
the surface of the anaerobic pond; this prevents transfer of odors to the air. Crusts 
have also proven effective, either naturally formed, as with grease, or formed from 
Styrofoam balls. A further disadvantage of the anaerobic pond is that the effluent 
usually requires additional treatment prior to discharge. Anaerobic lagoons do not 
have wide application for treatment of domestic wastewaters. 
 
4.3.5.3. Facultative. This is the most common type of lagoon system. It is the 
easiest to operate and maintain, but requires a large land area. Facultative ponds 
are used to treat raw domestic wastewater and primary or secondary effluent. In 
industrial applications, they provide additional stabilization following aerated or 
anaerobic ponds. Facultative ponds generally have both aerobic and anaerobic 
layers. Anaerobic fermentation occurs in the lower layer and aerobic stabilization 
occurs in the upper layer. A pond may be aerobic through the entire depth if it is 
lightly loaded. Facultative ponds are usually 4 to 8 feet deep and have long 
detention times ranging from 25 to 180 days. 
 
4.3.5.4. Aerated. Oxygen supply to aerated lagoon systems is through mechanical 
or diffused air aeration. Aerated ponds treat domestic or industrial wastewater and 
may evolve from overloaded facultative ponds by adding an aerator to increase 
oxygenation. For industrial wastes, aerated ponds are sometimes a pretreatment 
step before discharge to a domestic sewerage system. Aerated ponds are generally 
6 to 20 feet deep with detention times of 7 to 20 days. Aeration provides oxygen 
transfer for biological reactions and keeps solids partially or completely 
suspended, depending on level of mixing. The suspended solids are removed by 
settling (solid-liquid separation) before effluent is discharged. Settling is an 
integral part of the aerated lagoon system process and accomplished using a 
settling basin or a dormant/resting portion of the aerated cell. Aerated lagoon cells 
should operate either in series or in parallel flow patterns. Figure 4.19 displays 
two aerated cells and two additional treatment stages (settling, evaporation, or 
percolation).

Figure 4.19. Lagoon System with Several Cells. 
 
 
 
4.3.6. Evaporation Systems. Evaporation is an alternative wastewater disposal 
method if site conditions or contamination concerns preclude wastewater 
treatment and disposal using subsurface disposal or discharge to surface waters is 
not permitted or feasible. Evaporation systems, normally used in arid and semiarid 
locations, use the natural energy of the sun, wind, and temperature to dispose of 
wastewater to the atmosphere. Designs should ensure the net evaporation potential 
equals or exceeds the total water input to the system (wastewater volumes plus 
precipitation). Since water input correlates to the size and number of facilities 
needed, land availability is an important consideration for system designers. 
While some evaporation system designs combine evaporation with soil absorption 
(i.e., evaporation lagoons and evapotranspiration/absorption beds) or surface 
water discharge, total retention evaporation ponds and ET beds utilize liners to 
prevent groundwater and surface water contamination. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
98 
 
 
4.3.6.1. Total retention ponds. As illustrated in Figure 4.20, lined retention ponds 
return water to the hydrologic cycle by evaporation only and concentrates 
remaining pollution for subsequent disposal. Consider monthly evaporation and 
precipitation rates when properly sizing the system. Total retention ponds usually 
require large land areas, and these areas are not productive once they have been 
committed to this type of system. The land should be naturally flat or be shaped 
to provide ponds that are uniform in depth, and have large surface areas. 
 
Figure 4.20. Total Retention Pond. 
 
 
 
4.3.6.2. ET beds. ET beds are designed to use both evaporation and vegetation 
transpiration to return water to the hydrologic cycle. ET disposal normally 
consists of a sand bed with an impermeable liner and wastewater distribution 
piping (Figure 4.21). Plant vegetation in the surface of the sand bed for vegetation 
transpiration. Wastewater entering the bed is normally pretreated to remove 
settleable and floatable solids. An ET bed functions by raising the wastewater to 
the upper portion of the bed by capillary action in the sand, and then evaporating 
it to the atmosphere. In addition, the vegetation transports water from the root 
zone to the leaves for transpiration.

Figure 4.21. ET Bed (Cross Section). 
 
 
 
4.3.6.3. Evapotranspiration/absorption (ETA) beds. The ETA method is a 
modification of the ET bed. It disposes of wastewater into the atmosphere and to 
the groundwater. By omitting the impervious liner, a portion of the wastewater 
seeps into the soil. This method is not appropriate in areas where wastewater 
percolation might contaminate groundwater supplies, such as areas with shallow 
or creviced bedrock, or high water tables. 
 
4.3.6.3.1. As with ET beds, a favorable climate and planted vegetation improves 
the efficiency. While various factors can influence specific design characteristics, 
ETA design is very similar to the ET beds (see Figure 4.21). Table 4.10 lists 
some desirable construction features for both ETA and ET bed. 
 
4.3.6.3.2. When constructing ETA beds, be sure to follow accepted construction 
procedures and practices for subsurface disposal systems.

Table 4.10. Construction Design Features for ET and ETA Beds. 
 
ET and ETA Construction Features. 
1. 
Synthetic liners should have a thickness of at least 10 mil; it 
may be preferable to use a double thickness of liner material 
so that the seams can be staggered if seams are unavoidable. 
2. 
Synthetic liners should be cushioned on both sides with layers 
of sand at least 2 inches thick to prevent puncturing during 
construction. 
3. 
Surface runoff from adjacent areas should be diverted around 
the system by berms or drainage swales. 
4. 
Crushed stone or gravel placed around the distribution pipes 
should be 3/4 to 2-l/2 inches. 
5. 
Filter cloth or equivalent should be used on top of the rock or 
gravel to prevent sand from settling into aggregate and 
reducing the void capacity. 
6. 
Care should be exercised in assembling the 4-inch perforated 
distribution pipes to prevent pipe glues and solvents from 
contacting the synthetic liner. 
7. 
The bed surface should be sloped for positive drainage. 
8. 
Relatively porous topsoil, such as loamy sand or sandy loam, 
should be used if required to support vegetation to prevent 
erosion, or to make the appearance more acceptable. 
9. 
The bed should be located in conformance with local 
codes/command requirements.

4.4. Kitchen Soakage Pits and Trenches. Beddown locations may require 
soakage pits or soakage trenches to dispose of wastewater from kitchens and 
dining facilities (DFAC) for short periods until a more suitable means of disposal 
is available. Climate and soil conditions usually determine the effectiveness of 
these devices. Normally, pits and trenches disposes small volumes of wastewater, 
but with proper design and operation, they can be effective for larger volumes. 
Pretreatment using grease traps is necessary to remove grease, particulate, and 
organic material to prevent prematurely clogging the soakage pit. 
 
4.4.1. Soakage Pit. Construct a kitchen soakage pits in the same manner as the 
urine soakage pit addressed in paragraph 2.4.1, and will normally dispose of 
liquid kitchen waste for 200 persons. A grease trap replaces pipes or troughs used 
in the urine soakage pit. If deployment is lasting (e.g., last for several weeks) make 
two kitchen soakage pits and alternate their usage on a daily basis; a rest period 
helps to prevent clogging. Ensure clogged soakage pits are properly closed. To 
close a kitchen pit, backfill and compact with soil 1 foot above the grade and mark 
the pit with a rectangular sign indicating the type of pit and date of closure. 
 
4.4.2. Soakage Trench. Use a kitchen soakage trench when the groundwater level 
or a rock formation precludes digging a soakage pit. The soakage trench has a 2 
feet square and l foot deep pit (Figure 4.22). The pit has a trench radiating 
outward from each side for a distance of 6 or more feet. Dig trenches 1-foot wide, 
varying depth from 1 foot at the center to 1-1/2 feet at the outer ends. Fill the pit 
and trenches with material similar to that used in the soakage pit. Build two units 
for every 200 persons fed and alternate their usage daily. Use a grease trap with 
the soakage trench, and close it in the same manner as a soakage pit described in 
the previous paragraph.

4.5. Graywater Evaporations Beds. The evaporation bed is a field expedient 
method to dispose of small flows of graywater. They are suited for hot and dry 
climates and locations where clay soil prevents use of standard soakage pits. 
Although simple to build, they can be labor intensive to maintain. Normally, 
evaporation beds measure 8 by 10 feet (Figure 4.23). Construct beds to allow 3 
square feet per person per day for kitchen waste and 2 square feet per person per 
day for wash and bath waste. Space beds to allow waste distribution to any one 
bed. Scrape topsoil to the edges, forming a small dike around the bed. Spade earth 
in the bed to a depth of 10 to 15 inches. Rake it into a series of rows with the 
ridges approximately 6 inches above the depression. Form rows either lengthwise 
or crosswise, depending on which allows for best water distribution. If land is 
limited, configure beds in three tiers (Figure 4.24).

AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
104 
 
 
4.5.1. During the day, flood one bed with liquid waste to the top of the ridges. 
This is equivalent to an average depth of 3 inches over the bed. Allow liquid waste 
to evaporate and percolate. After three or four days, the bed is usually sufficiently 
dry for re-spading and reforming. Flood other beds on successive days and follow 
the same sequence of events. 
 
4.5.2. Give careful attention to proper rotation, maintenance, and dosage. It is 
essential that kitchen wastewater run through an efficient grease trap (see 
paragraph 4.6) before flowing to an evaporation bed. If used properly, 
evaporation beds create no insect hazard and only a slight odor. Other waste 
disposal methods are possible if they are more adaptable to the particular situation. 
 
4.6. Wastewater Collection Pit Box. During initial stages of beddown 
operations, certain facilities may generate wastewater requiring temporary 
collection until disposed of properly. While this situation is uncommon, a pit box 
offers an expedient, temporary means to collect wastewater should the need arise. 
A 1,000-gallon pit box should be adequate for facilities producing relatively small 
quantities of wastewater. Facilities producing larger amounts of wastewater may 
require a 2,000-gallon pit box. Table 4.11 and Table 4.12 list building materials 
and Figure 4.25 provides construction details for pit boxes. Empty collection pits 
using wastewater disposal trailers and trucks.

4.7. Grease Traps. Sometimes referred to as grease interceptors, grease traps 
separate and hold grease from wastewater for later removal and disposal. 
Whenever grease-laden wastewater is to be disposed of into a wastewater septic 
system, install a grease trap before the septic tank or separate drain field. DFACs 
create a significant amount of grease-laden wastewater; use grease traps when 
discarding wastewater from DFACs into soakage pits and trenches. In addition to 
wastewater volume, grease and food particles present a complicating factor for 
wastewater treatment and disposal. The grease trap removes grease from 
wastewater to prevent clogging the soil and stopping absorption in the drain fields. 
The grease trap should be large enough to prevent the addition of hot, greasy water 
from heating the cool water already in the trap. Otherwise, grease will pass 
through the trap instead of congealing and rising to the top of the water. 
Furthermore, poorly maintained grease traps causes grease to interfere with the 
performance of both the collection and treatment system. To assure effectiveness, 
clean grease traps frequently and burn or bury removed material if permitted by 
regulations and CCMD guidelines. The following paragraphs address 
construction details for various field-expedient grease traps used with contingency 
wastewater treatment and disposal systems. 
 
4.7.1. In-line Grease Traps. Similar to septic tanks, the most effective in-line 
grease traps are usually located outside, in an underground tank with ground-level 
access. Usually, permanent systems are watertight concrete tanks with inlet and 
outlet piping. However, as illustrated in Figure 4.26 and Figure 4.27, wood and 
55-gallon drums are optional methods for constructing in-line field expedient or 
improvised grease traps.

4.7.2. Barrel-Filter Grease Trap. Construct the barrel-filter grease trap from a 
30- to 55-gallon barrel or drum (Figure 4.28). Remove the barrel top and bore a 
number of large holes into the bottom. Place 8 inches of gravel or small stones in 
the bottom of the barrel and cover them with 12 to 18 inches of wood ashes or 
sand. Next, fasten a piece of burlap to the top of the barrel to serve as a coarse 
strainer. Place the trap directly over the soakage pit or on a platform with a trough 
leading to the pit. Be sure to empty the trap every two days. Wash the trap, remove 
and bury the ashes or sand, and refill the trap with fresh ashes or sand. Also, wash 
the burlap strainer every day or replace it. Figure 4.29 depicts two additional 
versions of expedient barrel-type grease traps.

4.7.3. Baffle Grease Trap. Construct a baffle grease trap from a 55-gallon drum 
or box (Figure 4.30). Divide the trap vertically into unequal chambers with a 
wooden baffle. This baffle should extend to within 1 inch from the bottom. Waste 
pours through a strainer into the large chamber, then passes under the baffle and 
flows into the small chamber. The large chamber should have a removable lid and 
strainer. The strainer may be a box with openings in the bottom. Fill the strainer 
with straw or burlap to remove coarser solids. Clean the strainer frequently by 
scrubbing it with soap and water to prevent clogging. Insert a 1-inch pipe 3 to 6 
inches below the top of the smaller chamber to carry liquid from the trap to the 
soakage pit. Clean the trap frequently to ensure proper operation. Remove the

grease, drain the trap, and remove the sediment from the bottom. Burn or bury the 
grease, sediment, and strained material.

4.8. Summary. This chapter presented expedient options for sewage and 
wastewater disposal during contingencies. While not applicable in every situation, 
some methods and techniques may be useful as interim measures until 
prepackaged contingency materials, equipment and supplies arrive; existing 
systems repaired; or engineers build a more sustainable, wastewater treatment 
system. For additional information on sewage and wastewater disposal techniques 
and procedures, consult references listed in Table 4.13.

SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL 
 
5.1. General Information. Properly disposing of solid waste (SW) can be 
challenging at austere beddown locations. A large volume of SW is generated 
during force beddown. Materials such as wood pallets and crates; scrap building 
materials; cardboard boxes; food waste and packaging; and many other paper, 
wood, plastic, and metal remnants are part of the waste stream. This waste can 
create excellent breeding grounds for rodents and insects if not properly managed 
and disposed of expeditiously. Not only does overall health and environmental 
protection necessitate proper waste disposal, the safety risks to personnel from 
inadequate or improper waste disposal is very high. For contingency locations, 
DODI 4715.19, DODI 4715.22, and CCMD directives and guidance apply. 
Additionally, the Solid Waste Management Plan (SWMP) for each contingency 
operation provides detailed SW management procedures. Local disposal options 
usually depend on the capabilities and services available at each location. Table 
5.1 lists typical methods of non-hazardous SW disposal for contingency bases 
relative to their planned construction and period of use.  
 
5.2. Overview. Incinerators, landfills, and contracted services are often top 
choices for disposal of large volumes of SW at contingency bases. Sometimes, 
recycling and composting augment other disposal methods. This chapter provides 
common SW disposal methods for contingency bases, followed by expedient and 
improvised procedures to dispose of small quantities of non-hazardous SW for 
short periods. When consistent with the SWMP, engineers may find the 
improvised procedures useful as interim disposal measures, especially when 
alternative disposal options are not available. For additional information on SW 
disposal, consult the references addressed in paragraph 5.5.

5.3. SW Disposal Methods. Regardless of the planned methods of SW disposal 
(e.g., sanitary landfill, incineration, recycling, composting) at contingency 
locations, the operation requires additional personnel and resources to setup, 
operate, and maintain. When developing SW disposal methods, bioenvironmental 
engineers and units generating the waste should be major players. Plan to build 
collection points throughout the encampment and especially at locations 
convenient to major waste producers. Units should carry their own trash to pick-
up points. Encourage units to minimize the amount of garbage they generate and 
reduce volume by flattening boxes and cans. Set up a collection schedule and 
assign trash collection and disposal duties. Ensure SW disposal methods adhere 
to CCMD guidance. While CE has responsibility for the base SW disposal 
program, contractors often dispose of base-generated SW. Table 5.2 lists typical 
contracted SW services managed by the Air Force Contract Augmentation 
Program (AFCAP).

5.3.1. Landfills. Typically, deployed forces use landfills to dispose of non-
hazardous SW and/or ash created by incinerators and burn pits. When properly 
designed, landfills accommodate the population over the anticipated life span of 
the contingency. Since there is no “best method” for all contingency bases, design 
landfills according to prescribed methods in the SWMP. The specific design of 
the landfill usually depends on site conditions and the amount and types of SW 
processed. Various landfill design information is available in UFC 3-240-10A, 
Sanitary Landfills. 
 
5.3.1.1. Two basic landfilling methods are the trench and area methods; other 
approaches are usually modifications to these two methods. 
 
5.3.1.1.1. The trench method involves dumping into a trench and covering it with 
material from the trench excavation (Figure 5.1). Generally, engineers may select 
the trench method when ground water is low, soil is more than 6 feet deep, and 
the land is flat or gently rolling. Landfill trenches should be perpendicular to the 
prevailing winds; deep enough to contain the long-term waste stream expected, 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
116 
 
 
and covered daily with not less than 6 inches of earthfill with a final cover of 30 
inches.  
 
Figure 5.1. Typical Trench Landfill Layout and Operation. 
 
 
 
5.3.1.1.2. The area landfill method (Figure 5.2) places waste in a large open 
excavation. Workers, spread, compact, and then cover the waste with suitable 
material. The area method is an option on most topography and has the potential 
to dispose of large quantities of SW. A combination of the two methods may be 
used.

Figure 5.2. Typical Area Landfill Layout and Operation. 
 
 
 
5.3.1.1.3. The building block common to both the trench and area methods is the 
cell. At the end of each working day, or more frequently, create the cell according 
to the steps below and as illustrated in Figure 5.3. The compacted waste and soil 
cover constitute a cell. A series of adjoining cells all of the same height makes up 
a lift. For large SW disposal operations, the completed landfill may consist of one 
or more lifts.

• 
Cover the SW completely with a thin, continuous layer of soil 
•

5.3.1.2. Landfills have advantages over most other methods of refuse disposal 
processes: they do not require large operating crews; they can receive all 
categories of solid wastes, except hazardous waste (HW); they can accommodate 
large fluctuations in the daily accumulation of refuse without additional personnel 
or equipment; and they provide reasonable control of vectors. Most landfills can 
accommodate a wide variety of SW types; nearly all rubbish, garbage, trash, 
ashes, solid organic waste, and miscellaneous solids may be disposed of safely. 
However, sanitary landfills constructed with stringent requirements offer better 
protection against pollution. Most domestic-type solid waste can be disposed of 
without presorting or in combination with SW reduction techniques (e.g., 
incineration, baling, compacting, shredding). Certain waste products are not 
appropriate for landfills including hazardous waste, toxic substances, liquids, 
untreated infectious waste, and volatile, explosive, or flammable wastes. When 
filled or no longer required, close and mark landfills following procedures in the 
SWMP. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
119 
 
 
5.3.1.3. Depending on the size of the installation, multiple landfill sites may be 
necessary, all of which require approval of the CCDR responsible for the area 
where the landfill is located. Depending on the circumstances, coordination with 
the host nation (HN) may be a consideration. Construct, operate, and close 
landfills IAW procedures in the SWMP. 
 
5.3.1.4. Base planners follow CCMD guidance for integrating environmental 
considerations into the development of SW disposal processes. Planning for 
landfill operations should include the following considerations: 
 
5.3.1.4.1. Locate the landfill downwind from the base (or at least downwind from 
housing, medical, and dining facilities), and in a controlled area where personnel 
using the site are not subject to enemy attack and local civilians will not have 
access. It should also be away from runways (bird hazard), floodplains, wetlands, 
aquifers, seismic zones, and unstable areas. Note: If off-site landfills are used, 
temporary holding facilities at the base will be required. 
 
5.3.1.4.2. If HN contractors are dumping at the site, coordinate with the supported 
unit for security considerations. 
 
5.3.1.4.3. Provide recommendations to the base camp residents on items to avoid 
placing in the landfill, including liquid or hazardous waste. 
 
5.3.1.4.4. Plan for daily and final landfill soil cover materials with proper 
compaction for control of vectors, water infiltration, gas migration, and erosion, 
as well as support for vegetation, vehicular traffic, and fire resistance. 
 
5.3.1.4.5. If necessary, due to the depth of the groundwater level and the slope of 
the land, plan for a liner and leachate collection system (Figure 5.4), and 
monitoring during the life of the landfill and post-closure for contamination that 
may migrate into other areas off-site. 
 
5.3.1.4.6. Provide proper drainage control around the landfill and address any 
additional environmental requirements (for example, explosive gas control). 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
120 
 
 
5.3.1.4.7. Develop record keeping requirements for the closure plan. Ensure each 
closed SW landfill is marked “Solid Waste Landfill” and “CLOSED (date).” 
 
Figure 5.4. Liner Placement during Landfill Construction. 
 
 
 
5.3.2. Incinerators. In the absence of HN support, thermal destruction 
(incineration) is the most common and preferred method of SW disposal for US 
forces at contingency bases. Incinerators reduce SW to a relatively small, non-
combustible residue using controlled combustion; the residue can then be further 
processed or disposed of (often in landfills). Over the years, incinerator 
technology has significantly improved, including clean burning innovations, 
efficient waste-to-energy production (steam, hot water, or electricity), and 
advanced pollution control equipment. The technology uses extremely high 
temperatures, and primary and secondary combustion processes to destroy toxic 
materials. Not only do high-efficiency SW incinerators reduce the burden on the 
environment and prevent exposure of base personnel to hazardous emissions 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
121 
 
 
(smoke, gases, and particulates), they can also ease the strain on the entire supply 
chain. Because of the wide variety of incinerators, engineering personnel should 
be aware of CCMD requirements for SW disposal, including medical and 
explosives waste, and live ammunition. 
 
5.3.2.1. Packaged, modular, and field-erected incinerators are available in various 
models and sizes and are capable of satisfying the SW disposal needs for most 
bases—large and small (Figure 5.5). Other incinerator designs are especially for 
medical waste or explosive waste. Medical incinerators should be the standard 
incinerator for medical waste because of their optimum design to withstand high 
temperatures. For explosives or explosives-contaminated waste, use only 
incinerators designed for that type of material. Likewise, use specially designed 
ammunition incinerators, like that shown in Figure 5.6, for destroying live 
ammunition.

122 
 
 
Figure 5.6. Ammunition Incinerator at Expeditionary Airfield. 
 
 
 
5.3.2.2. Generally, field-erected and modular incinerator plants provide for 
receiving, weighing, unloading, storing, charging, combustion, emission control, 
and removal and handling of residues. However, smaller packaged incinerators 
without all the accommodations of larger systems can usually be set up relatively 
quickly. As with other SW disposal methods, consider how waste for incinerators 
will be collected, transported, stored, etc. Collect non-combustibles and waste 
prohibited from incineration by the SWMP separately; do not deliver this waste 
to the incinerators. Carefully sort SW to remove ammunition, glass, batteries, 
metals, and most wood products. 
 
5.3.2.3. Other than the incinerator itself, the main operating area for SW 
incinerator facilities is the tipping floor. The tipping floor is the receiving pad 
where incoming trucks unload, dump, or “tip” the incoming SW on the floor. 
Additionally, it is where further SW sorting and storing occurs before feeding into 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
123 
 
 
incinerators. Ideally, the floor should be a finished and sealed, reinforced concrete 
slab designed to handle heavy loads. It should be large enough to accommodate 
anticipated SW sorting and storage requirements. The floor should be capable of 
enduring heavy abuse from constant dumping of SW; spills; and material handling 
equipment (MHE), such as frontend loaders, operating, sorting, and moving waste 
around the floor. Note: Frontend loaders that service incinerators should be large 
enough to deliver an adequate amount of waste to the feed hoppers, but have a 
bucket narrow enough to access the feed hopper opening on the incinerator. 
 
5.3.2.4. Safety during incinerator operations and maintenance is always a primary 
concern. Incinerator work crews should be vigilant when using or working around 
heavy equipment. Inattentiveness during the collection and processing of SW 
around incinerator facilities can easily lead to personnel injury or equipment 
damage. Further, operate and maintain MHE according to manufacturers’ 
recommendations. Keep MHE assets clean to prevent the propagation or attraction 
of vectors and the creation of nuisances around the incinerator facility. Because 
incinerators operate at extremely high temperatures, exercise caution to avoid 
injury. Make sure personnel have the appropriate PPE. Standard equipment 
includes eye and face protection (face shields or safety goggles), heavy gloves, 
safety shoes, hard hats, and respirators. Safety belts may be required for fall 
protection when working on elevated platforms. Maintain good housekeeping and 
ensure appropriate warning signs and instrumentation are posted in appropriate 
areas. Incinerator safety equipment and devices should be attached and 
functioning properly (e.g., fire suppression and firefighting equipment such as 
sprinkler systems, fire hoses, and extinguishers; safety valves; ladders; guardrails; 
toe boards; screens; lighting; and first aid kits). Good lighting is crucial during 
night operations and periods of reduced visibility. 
 
5.3.3. Burn Pits. Open-air burn pits may be an option as an interim measure to 
dispose of SW at contingency locations during initial establishment and stand-up 
operations. DOD policy imposes restrictions on the use of burn pits (see 
Attachment 1 for DOD definition of burn pits). Readers should consult DODI 
4715.19 for specific requirements. When consistent with DODI 4715.19, DODI 
4715.22, and CCMD guidance, open-air burn pits are optional for short periods to 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
124 
 
 
dispose of SW during contingency operations if no other feasible method of 
disposal is available. For longer term, use incinerators, engineered landfills, or 
other accepted SW management practices, when permitted and practical. When 
open-air burn pits are used, SW plans should include provisions to transition to a 
more acceptable means of disposal. This becomes particularly important as bases 
mature and populations surge. Waste disposal activities that do not meet the 
definition of open-air burn pits should strive to meet the intent of DODI 4715.19. 
Follow CCMD engineering and medical guidance to maximize protection of 
human health and safety at those locations where covered waste is burned because 
no alternative is feasible or the facility does not meet the definition of an open-air 
burn pit. 
 
5.3.3.1. Though burn pits reduce the overall waste volume and may be an effective 
means of disposing of certain waste streams, they can present some health and 
quality-of-life issues. They must be operated IAW the CCMD SWMP and in a 
manner that prevents or minimizes risks to human health and safety of DOD 
personnel and, where possible, harm to the environment. For short periods, burn 
pits are a potential solution for smaller camps that do not have contracted support 
or any other feasible means of SW disposal. Mobile incinerators and mobile 
waste-to-energy systems are much better than burn pits, provided they are 
modular, mobile, and simple enough for service members to use and maintain. 
 
5.3.3.2. Open-air burn pits should be located so that prevailing winds carry smoke 
away from base camps, including housing, medical facilities, DFACs, and other 
troop concentrations. Monitor the content entering the burn pit to prevent the 
disposal of hazardous waste/hazardous materials (HW/HM) and other restricted 
waste products. Keep live ammunition and batteries out of SW burn pits. When 
constructing the pit, determine the size by the amount of solid waste that needs 
burning. Place a soil or earthen berm (usually 15’-20’ high) around the burn pit 
for safety. Determine the height of the berm based on factors at the beddown 
location. Factors such as groundwater table, pit design (above or below ground, 
loading ramps), maintenance equipment, personnel safety, etc., may affect the 
required height of the berm. Although berms for burn pits are similar to other 
expedient berms, other design and construction features may be incorporated. For 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
125 
 
 
example, added dirt ramps allow access by dozers and compactors to perform 
routine maintenance on the pit, and additional fencing around berms to contain 
blowing trash and prevent unwanted entry. Figure 5.7 is one example of a burn 
pit that uses a soil berm. See other AFTTP 3-32.33 series publications for specific 
berm construction procedures.

126 
 
 
5.3.4. Air Curtain Destructors. Often used for vegetative waste, air curtain 
destructors (ACD) may be an alternate method of SW disposal that produces 
lower smoke emissions than open-air burn pits. An ACD, also called a “burn box” 
is a type of incineration device that introduces a controlled velocity of air across 
the upper portion of a combustion chamber in which the waste is loaded. The 
curtain of air created in this process traps unburned particles under the curtain in 
the high temperature zone where temperatures can reach 2000º F. Increased 
combustion time and turbulence of air curtain burning results in a re-burn and 
more complete combustion of the loaded waste. Generally, there are two types of 
ACDs, the self-contained firebox system and the trench burner system. 
 
5.3.4.1. The self-contained ACD is a skid-mounted system that requires no setup 
or teardown (Figure 5.8). However, it is very heavy (small units weigh over 
20,000 lbs.) and difficult to transport over soft soil. It incorporates the engine, fuel 
tank, blower system, and combustion chamber. The combustion chamber is a 
refractory walled firebox that aids combustion by retaining and reflecting the high 
temperatures within the firebox. 
 
Figure 5.8. Self-Contained ACD. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
127 
 
 
5.3.4.2. Contemporary trench burners are usually trailer-mounted systems with a 
motor, blower, and manifold (Figure 5.9). They are mobilize quickly and towed 
easily behind a truck. These trench burners require excavation of an earthen pit or 
trench to function as a combustion chamber or firebox. Open pit and trench burner 
units are the least efficient and less desirable ACD because of the resultant air 
pollutants and high fuel demand. 
 
Figure 5.9. Trench Burner ACD. 
 
 
 
5.3.5. Recycling. Units must comply with CCMD policy, if any, on recycling. 
Consult with the designated lead Service or CCMD environmental management 
POC for guidance on recycling policy and options available at the contingency 
location. Recycling and reuse reduces SW disposal requirements. Logistics 
readiness personnel can help determine the best recycling option based on the 
waste stream and available recycling capabilities, including HN recycling 
services. In most overseas deployment locations, shipping recyclable materials 
back to the United States is cost prohibitive, whereas participating in the local 
community-recycling program may be feasible. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
128 
 
 
5.3.6. Composting. Composting is a form of organic waste treatment that reduces 
SW disposal requirements. It is an engineered process to promote the biochemical 
decaying of organic material. Compost product is useful in a variety of ways, 
including erosion control, improved soil properties, or application to agricultural, 
forest, or reclaimed mined lands. The suitability of composting as a waste disposal 
method depends upon the amount of organic waste generated, susceptibility to 
vectors, available land and labor, and duration of occupancy. Composting is 
typically the preferred method to remove DFAC waste, paper, and cardboard from 
the SW stream.  
 
5.3.6.1. During initial base beddown at austere locations, composting may be 
impractical unless the HN or local municipality has an operational composting 
program and can provide composting services. As the base matures, composting 
options may become available, such as the covered and aerated composting 
system shown in Figure 5.10.  
 
Figure 5.10. Covered Forced Air Composting System. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
129 
 
 
5.3.6.2. This system uses forced air, semipermeable covers, and computer control 
and monitoring technology to accelerate natural composting processes. This type 
of unit is mobile, efficient, and allows composting to occur within the confines of 
a small base camp because the system reduces odors and vector attraction. It 
increases composting efficiency by using cardboard and paper waste generated by 
the base population to balance the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in the heap. This 
balance is critical to the successful composting of food waste. The covered and 
aerated composting system is one of various composting methods that range in 
complexity in terms of labor and equipment requirements. Review CCMD 
guidance to determine permitted composting methods. 
 
5.4. Improvised SW Disposal. During the initial days of beddown at bases in 
austere locations, it is unlikely a fully organized SW collection and disposal 
operation will be in place. Even if contract SW services are used, it could take 
several weeks to achieve full service. Furthermore, interruption of such services 
is likely during periods of increased security, particularly after an attack against 
the installation. At all contingency locations (initial, temporary, and semi-
permanent), backup expedient and improvised SW disposal plans should be 
available in case of interruption to regular or conventional methods. Airmen 
should perform basic SW disposal duties to maintain health of the force. Ensure 
CCMD guidance permits any improvised SW disposal methods used. Two 
common improvised SW disposal methods are garbage burial pits, garbage 
trenches, and barrel incinerators. 
 
5.4.1. Garbage Burial Pits and Trenches. Garbage burial pits and trenches are 
interim or temporary measures to handle small quantities of SW during initial base 
beddown. For short-term operations, bury garbage in small pits. A 4 feet square 
and 4 feet deep pit can handle one day's garbage for 100 personnel (Figure 5.11). 
Fill these pits no closer than 1 foot below ground surface, spray with insecticide, 
and mound over with compacted earth to 1 foot above ground level. Mark each 
pit with a rectangular sign on top of the mound indicating the type of pit and date 
closed. When larger pits are used, cover the garbage daily. Insecticide is not 
required if 2 feet of compacted soil are used for cover. For enduring operations, 
bury garbage in a continuous trench or combine with other solid waste in a 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
130 
 
 
sanitary landfill. The trench size depends upon the size of force supported and 
their length of stay. Using this method, dirt excavated while extending the trench 
covers and mounds the garbage already deposited. When using burial pits and 
trenches, closely monitor “self-help” garbage burial operations to prevent 
uncontrolled refuse disposal, which can lead to serious fire and sanitation hazards. 
Also, establish a stringent pest control program to alleviate danger of disease 
spread. 
 
Figure 5.11. Garbage Burial Pit. 
 
 
 
5.4.2. Barrel Incinerators. Improvised barrel incinerators, typically constructed 
from 55-gallon drums, handle relatively small amounts of garbage (Figure 5.12). 
Before modifying the drum, remove toxic, flammable, or combustible contents. 
Like other improvised SW disposal methods, use barrel incinerators in 
temporary/emergency situations only if allowed by SWMP. Conduct burn 
operations where prevailing winds carry smoke away from troop locations and 
living areas. Do not incinerate HW; explosions or toxic gases may result in 
personnel or equipment damage.

5.5. Summary. During initial bare-base development, expedient SW disposal 
methods (e.g., burial pits, burn barrels, burn pits) may be required until enduring 
methods and processes are established. Whenever contract disposal is unavailable, 
engineers should implement methods to manage SW disposal consistent with 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33 V1, 26 October 2018 
132 
 
 
theater SWMP. If external disposal sites are out of service or inaccessible, identify 
internal locations. Garbage, refuse and debris can either be buried, burned, or a 
combination of both. It is important to consider all available methods of solid 
waste disposal, including incinerators, landfills, open-air burn pits, composting, 
and recycling facilities. When evaluating options, recognize that the operation of 
open-air burn pits involve severe restrictions. Use open-air burn pits as a short-
term solution during contingency operations and operate them in a manner that 
prevents or minimizes risk to humans and the environment. Consult DODI 
4715.19 for specific requirements and restrictions on use of burn pits. For 
additional information on SW disposal tactics, techniques, and procedures, 
consult references listed in Table 5.3.
