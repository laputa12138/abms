SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This publication substantially revises the combined Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-1202, Army 
Regulation (AR) 70-43, and Operational Naval Instruction (OPNAVINST) 3913.1A (dated 1 
April 1998).  It incorporates revisions to the original management and funding policy as stated in 
the 2002 DepSecDef Memorandum.  Additionally, it provides further guidance on SERB 
processes and membership.  This publication adds the responsibility for STP management as it 
applies to DoD auxiliary payload rideshare opportunities, and for STP to execute non-SERB 
reimbursable missions as requested.  It aligns with Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-12, 
Space, updates action agencies, and responsibilities, and adopts three DoD forms.  This 
publication does not apply to the Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard (ANG), or Civil Air 
Patrol.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
1.1.  General.  OSD establishes overarching policy and assigns responsibilities and 
authorities for Space Test Program (STP) planning, programming, and acquisition within the 
DoD.  As of the date of this publication, OSD has established the United States Air Force as 
Executive Agent (EA) for Space.  The AF has designated SAF/AQS as the EA for the STP.  
Similarly, the AF has designated Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) responsibility for 
space launch.  AFSPC provides policy and guidance for space launch operations conducted 
on both the Eastern and Western Ranges to include; roles and responsibilities, operational 
requirements, and launch scheduling and forecasting procedures. 
1.2.  STP Authority.  The STP has been designated as the “front door” for all DoD auxiliary 
payloads (APLs) on DoD, civil and commercial launches, and for all non-DoD APLs seeking 
launch opportunities on DoD missions.  The STP is the primary provider of mission design, 
spacecraft (SC) acquisition, integration, launch, and on-orbit operations for the DoD’s Space 
research and development (R&D) community.  Offices assigned responsibilities within the 
STP will guide potential sponsors and R&D Principal Investigators (PIs) in preparing and 
submitting spaceflight requests, and define the relationship among sponsors, PIs, and STP 
managers.  Additionally, STP is the single manager for all DoD payloads on the Space 
Shuttle, the International Space Station (ISS), future manned and unmanned National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launch vehicles (LV), and all auxiliary 
payloads (APL) on Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) rideshare opportunities.  STP may 
assist DoD APLs in securing rideshare opportunities on non-DoD flights. 
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010

1.3.  Space Experiments Review Board (SERB).  The multi-service Space Experiments 
Review Board (SERB) provides a formalized means to evaluate DoD sponsored payloads 
and experiments for consideration for subsidized spaceflight (fully or partially) through STP 
dedicated funding.  This process includes; prioritization of R&D proposed experiments based 
primarily on DoD utility, and providing programmatic guidance to the STP for developing 
and managing proposed missions. 
2.  APPLICABILITY 
2.1.  This instruction applies to all DoD organizations that the STP supports, DoD 
organizations supporting the STP, and the STP Management Office (hereafter referred to as 
the STP Office).  Federal agencies outside the DoD requesting support from the STP Office 
must abide by this instruction.  DoD or other Federal agencies receiving support from the 
STP Office may issue directives for STP procedures within their organizations; however 
those directives must not be less restrictive than this instruction.  In cases of conflict, this 
instruction will have precedence.

program offices understand and acknowledge the contributions of the flight experiment 
as it improves the state of technology required to develop tomorrow’s operational 
systems or the understanding of the space environment. 
4.  MISSION PHASES (PROCESSES, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES) 
4.1.  General.  The overall process for obtaining either subsidized or reimbursable space 
flight services for a DoD space experiment is detailed in this section.  Experiments can fall 
into several categories or types dependent upon the support needed from STP.  An 
experiment may be brought to STP in a variety of forms.  It may be an instrument requiring 
integration to a SC or may be a complete SV.   A variety of support may be desired to 
include launch, flight operations, data recovery, interactions with ground- or space-based 
assets, or other activities.  STP will evaluate the specific experiment requirements and where 
feasible design a mission that best accomplishes its scientific objectives. 
4.1.1.  Launch resources may be manned or unmanned.  Unmanned launches can be 
human-rated but are usually ELVs and can include sounding rockets and balloons.  
NASA executes human spaceflight.  The STP Office serves as the primary DoD program 
supporting human spaceflight payload integration and operations and, as such, acts as the 
single manager for all DoD payloads on the Space Shuttle, ISS, and other human-rated 
spaceflights. 
4.1.2.  From an LV payload standpoint, an experiment can be the Primary SV or an 
Auxiliary Payload.  APLs shall not adversely impact the primary SV. 
4.1.3.  STP missions may be categorized by the method of funding.  If subsidized support 
from STP is required for accomplishing the objectives of a space experiment, the 
experiment must go through the SERB process. 
4.1.3.1.  SERB missions may be partially or completely subsidized through STP 
funds with the exception of the experiment development.   In addition to subsidizing 
the cost of the mission, STP may be able to provide launch opportunities on dedicated 
launch vehicles provided to the program in accordance with the “DepSecDef STP 
Management and Funding Policy” goal of launching a Small Launch Vehicle-Class 
mission every two years and a Medium Launch Vehicle-Class mission every four 
years. 
4.1.3.2.  Reimbursable missions are fully funded by the payload sponsor and STP 
services may be negotiated directly with the STP Office.  STP estimates for sponsor 
funding should fully account for any additional SDTW overhead costs, including 
additional manpower resources or facility upgrades if required. 
4.2.  Flight Requests.  Customers can request STP support via two methods:  through the 
SERB or by agreement with STP for reimbursable services.  Any Service, DoD Agency, or 
DoD Organization may propose experiments requesting STP support.  Note:  These 
  8  
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010 
organizations should establish internal procedures for reviewing and approving SERB 
proposals prior to sending them to the DoD SERB. 
4.2.1.  DoD SERB.  The SERB process provides an equal opportunity for all DoD space 
R&D experiments to be considered for subsidized spaceflight.  The review process 
ensures military relevance, reduces experiment duplication, and promotes cooperation 
among PIs. 
4.2.1.1.  Website.  A website (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/) has been established that 
contains SERB data to include guidance, previous results/history, forms, sample 
briefs and instructions, ranking criteria, and associated links.  Electronic copies of the 
DD Form 1721 Space Test Program Flight Request, DD Form 1721-1 Space Test 
Program Flight Request (Executive Summary), and DD Form 1721-2 Space Test 
Program After Action Report can be downloaded from the site.  Hereafter, this site 
will be referred to as the SERB Website. 
4.2.1.2.  SERB Meetings.  The SERB meets yearly to review all requests for 
subsidized spaceflight, to create an experiment priority list, and to hear status reports 
from the STP Office on the progress of manifesting and flying SERB experiments.  
Approximately six months after this annual meeting, the SERB may meet for a mid-
year review (outlined later).  The SERB is organized and chaired by STP EA. 
4.2.1.3.  SERB Members.  All members of the SERB are voting members. 
4.2.1.3.1.  The members (number of members per organization is in parenthesis) 
are the OSD (2), U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM (1)), Army (3), Air 
Force (3), Navy (3), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA 
(1)), the Missile Defense Agency (MDA (1)), National Reconnaissance Office 
(NRO (1)), and NASA (1). 
4.2.1.3.2.  Recommendation for members to be added or removed will be 
proposed in a formal request to STP EA. 
4.2.1.4.  Funding to Support SERB Experiments. 
4.2.1.4.1.  The STP Office, within its annual budget, may fund for the integration, 
launch, and orbital support of SERB approved experiments.  The STP Office will 
follow the guidelines set out within STP’s Program Management Directive 
(PMD) and in the President’s Budget Documentation to define restrictions or 
funding limitations.  Note:  The STP Office will not fund experiment 
development.  This typically excludes costs of designing, fabricating, 
documenting and testing any experiment or set of experiments. 
4.2.1.4.2.  The STP Office will support all SERB approved experiments within its 
resource limitations.  When feasible, the STP Office will identify and arrange for 
SERB experiment spaceflight opportunities based on cost-sharing agreements 
documented in the SFPs and Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).  In the case of 
these arrangements, the participating Sponsors must pay the STP Office in a 
timely manner or risk having their experiment removed from the mission. 
4.2.1.5.  SERB Requests.  To begin the process that may lead to STP spaceflight, the 
PI must present an experiment to the SERB along with a spaceflight request.  This 
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010 
  9  
includes new experiments, experiments not currently approved for STP spaceflight, or 
an experiment currently manifested but requesting additional flights not previously 
approved.  Specifically, any experiment seeking spaceflight that is not manifested on 
an STP launch must be briefed at each and every SERB until it is manifested.  For an 
experiment to be considered for STP subsidized support, it must have: 
4.2.1.5.1.  A DoD Sponsor. 
4.2.1.5.2.  Potential military benefit either as a DoD or Federal Agency research, 
development, test, and evaluation activity. 
4.2.1.5.3.  A need for spaceflight to meet experiment objectives. 
4.2.1.5.4.  Funding to support experiment development, fabrication, and unique 
orbit operations (if necessary), and data analysis. 
4.2.1.5.5.  Submitted DD Forms 1721 and 1721-1, through the appropriate 
channels, to the appropriate STP EA Division.  Electronic copies of the forms can 
be obtained at the SERB Website. 
4.2.1.6.  SERB Approval.  At the end of the annual SERB meeting, the board 
develops a prioritized list based on criteria provided by STP EA (criteria can be found 
at the SERB Website).  Military relevance will be the primary consideration in 
determining experiment priority.  Military relevance can mean that an experiment is a 
direct test of a new military system or component, an investigation into the potential 
to enhance an existing military system or field a new system, or even an investigation 
of space phenomena that affects or might affect military activities.  The SERB 
forwards its recommended prioritized list of experiments to STP EA for final 
approval.  STP EA publishes the list and forwards it to the STP Office to serve as 
guidance for spaceflight until a subsequent list is published.  Once STP receives the 
SERB approved list, the Mission Design process begins. 
4.2.1.7.  Mid-Cycle SERB Review.  Approximately six months after annual SERB 
meeting, a Mid-Cycle SERB review may be convened.  The purpose of the review is 
to bring the SERB members up to date on the status and financial health of the 
experiments on the SERB list, and the progress the STP Office has made at 
manifesting and flying SERB experiments. 
4.2.1.7.1.  On a case-by-case basis, a PI may brief an experiment, at the Mid-
Cycle SERB if he can demonstrate an immediate need for STP support prior to 
the next annual SERB.  Acceptable examples of immediate need include: (a) 
flight opportunity would be missed if the experiment did not get on the list 
immediately or (b) there is a time-critical military need for the experiment. 
4.2.1.7.2.  The SERB may vote to add a new unranked experiment to the bottom 
of the SERB list.  For this new experiment, the SERB will consider only the 
experiment’s military relevance and quality, as a service ranking will not be 
available. 
4.2.1.8.  Changing an Experiment’s Scope.  Once an experiment has been presented 
to the DoD SERB and ranked, it must not significantly change its scope and 
objectives. 
  10  
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010 
4.2.1.8.1.  Sponsors or PIs may send minor updates directly to the STP Office 
with an information copy to STP EA. 
4.2.1.8.2.  If the Sponsors or PIs need to significantly change the scope or 
objectives of an experiment, or if the support requested from STP changes, then 
the Sponsor must update both DD Forms 1721 and 1721-1, send the forms 
through their departmental approval authority, and re-brief the experiment to the 
SERB for approval. 
4.2.1.9.  Experiment Retention Due to Flight Failure or Termination.  If a SERB-
ranked experiment was included on an approved SFP and that mission is terminated 
prior to flight or is unsuccessful in providing the experiment an opportunity to collect 
its data in flight, the experiment will be placed at the bottom of the current SERB 
priority list until the next DoD SERB meeting.  The Sponsor must then brief the 
SERB to be considered for retention on the SERB list and future flight opportunities. 
4.2.1.10.  Additions to the SERB Approved List.  Experiments may be added to the 
SERB approved list by STP EA resulting from the Mid-Cycle SERB or on rare 
occasions, out of cycle.  To be added to the list, the experiment must have a 
Sponsor’s written endorsement, approved DD Forms 1721 and 1721-1, and specific 
justification for adding the experiment prior to the next annual SERB meeting.  
Experiments will be added to the bottom of the approved list without a ranking. 
4.2.2.  Reimbursable Flight Requests (Non-SERB).   The STP Office is authorized to 
support non-SERB government customers.  STP will work with non-SERB customers as 
appropriate to identify collaborative opportunities to fly the reimbursable experiment 
with SERB experiments. 
4.2.2.1.  Request.  Customers choosing not to compete for subsidized spaceflight 
through the SERB process can contact the STP Office directly with their spaceflight 
request.  The STP Office will provide the customer with a cost Reimbursable Flight 
Request form (similar to the DD Form 1721) identifying the basic information 
required to evaluate flight opportunities.  Upon completion and submittal of this 
information to the STP Office, the STP Office will generate a preliminary 
identification of flight options. 
4.2.2.2.  Funding.  Once an initial identification of potential flight opportunities has 
been provided to the customer at no charge, the customer will be responsible for 
funding STP for all additional costs incurred to explore, manifest, and execute the 
non-SERB mission. 
4.3.  Mission Design and Manifest. 
4.3.1.  Ground Rules. An APL must not induce unreasonable cost, schedule, or 
performance risk to the primary payload or its mission.  This requires coordination with 
and approval from the operational community, such as AFSPC/A3 for AFSPC primary 
missions. 
4.3.1.1.  The primary payload will determine mission profile, flight trajectory, and 
authority to determine deployment sequence for the primary payload in relation to the 
APLs. 
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010 
  11  
4.3.1.2.  A violation of the flight opportunity constraints as defined in the manifest 
package is grounds for de-manifesting. 
4.3.2.  General.   Missions are selected based on flight opportunities, available funds, and 
payload priorities. 
4.3.2.1.  The STP Office develops missions around key experiments from the 
approved SERB list, reimbursable payloads, and guidance from STP EA.  Missions 
will be formalized in a SFP Package.  To establish a mission, additional data will be 
gathered and used to conduct studies.  The studies will lead to selection of STP 
missions.  A mission may be developed for a single-experiment payload or for 
multiple payloads based on what best serves DoD R&D goals. All factors are 
weighed in selecting the optimal mission.  This process will ultimately lead to the 
selection of a flight configuration. 
4.3.2.2.  Funding Commitment.  A funding commitment in the form of a letter or 
memorandum (not the Cost Reimbursable Agreement) is required of every PI and 
Sponsor (SERB and non-SERB) to verify the realism of the experiment.  STP will not 
manifest SERB experiments without certification of support by the Sponsor.  
Furthermore, STP can de-manifest an experiment if it becomes evident the Sponsor 
does not have the funds needed to build and deliver the experiment (either as 
approved by the SERB or in the MOA between STP and a non-SERB customer).  The 
STP EA will enforce reimbursement to STP by the Sponsor for any sunk/closure 
costs directly resulting from that Sponsor’s inability to deliver a payload which 
negatively impacts the execution of the mission on which it was previously 
manifested. 
4.3.3.  Mission Designator.  The STP Office will establish a unique mission designator 
that permanently identifies all STP-approved missions. 
4.3.4.  Mission Director (MD).  MD appointment and responsibilities will be IAW 
established AFSPC procedures for AFSPC missions.  For STP dedicated missions, 
AFPEO/SP will assign or delegate appointment of “STP MD” to STP Director or 
SDTW/CC. 
4.3.5.  Mission Studies.  The STP Office gathers and compiles all flight request 
information from customers to serve as basis for planning and mission design.  The STP 
Office will perform systems performance and cost analyses, and design studies to identify 
compatible experiments for a mission and to quickly identify suitable experiment 
complements for flight opportunities that may arise.  The STP Office will work with the 
PIs to determine trade space in the experiment’s requirements that might allow an 
experiment to be more readily manifested.  Experiments will be grouped into compatible 
“bundles” or conceptual missions.  In order to support these efforts, additional 
information beyond the DD Forms 1721 and 1721-1 or Reimbursable Flight Request will 
be requested as required. 
4.3.5.1.  Unmanned Flights.  PIs complete and return an Experiment Requirements 
Document (ERD).  An example of an ERD can be found on the SERB website. 
4.3.5.2.  Manned Flights.  PIs complete and return a Payload Requirements Document 
(PRD) for experiments flown on human spaceflight missions.  This differs from a 
  12  
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010 
Payload Requirement Document (PLRD) which is included in the SFP Package for 
experiments flown on Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV). 
4.3.6.  Flight Assignment.  With the completion of the requirements documents, mission 
studies, and evaluations, the STP Office will oversee payload flight assignments 
(manifesting), including as required, designation of Primary SVs and APLs, LV 
selections and procurements, SC and support equipment procurements, payload 
integration, launch scheduling and services, flight operations preparation and orbital 
support, and data handling. 
4.3.6.1.  Launch scheduling and forecasting will be performed IAW established 
AFPSC procedures. 
4.3.6.2.  Because of fiscal constraints, flight assignment priorities will generally be 
given to the least expensive flight opportunity that will accomplish the majority of the 
experiment objectives. 
4.3.6.3.  STP will not be constrained to make flight assignments in strict adherence to 
the SERB rankings.  Rather, all factors (funding, flight opportunities, priority, etc.) 
will be considered to design missions in the best interests of DoD.  In some instances, 
this may result in a mission consisting of several lower ranked experiments rather 
than one or two high ranked experiments.  Reimbursable mission activities will 
normally be scheduled on a non-interference flight assignment basis unless the STP 
Executive Agent determines that prioritizing the reimbursable payload above/along 
with the SERB-ranked payloads substantially benefits STP or DoD overall. 
4.3.7.  Auxiliary Payloads.  STP is responsible for managing all unused capability for 
APLs on AFSPC missions.  In this capacity, it will collect, screen, and propose manifest 
options to AFSPC leadership for approval of potential risk and operational impacts.  In 
addition, STP may assist DoD APLs in securing rideshare opportunities on non-AFSPC 
missions.  To support this, the STP Office will: 
4.3.7.1.  Evaluate all user requests (SERB and non-SERB) for APL launch 
opportunities.  To aid in this effort, the Launch and Range Systems Wing will provide 
STP data of excess capability that may be available for secondary APLs on all EELV 
missions.  The primary SV SPOs will provide STP with data of excess SC or SV 
capability available to host piggyback APLs. 
4.3.7.2.  Resolve conflicts for requested services, perform feasibility assessments, and 
propose a preliminary STP APL manifest. 
4.3.7.3.  Request technical and programmatic approval via the STP Director and the 
appropriate Primary SV and LV SPOs, as required. 
4.3.7.4.  Evaluate funding, identify the risks and impacts to the primary mission, and 
coordinate via the STP Director with the SMC Commander for APL mission risk 
approval. 
4.3.7.5.  Request via the STP Director final STP APL manifest approval from 
Headquarters AFSPC Director of Air, Space and Information Operations 
(AFSPC/A3) to launch an APL on a specified mission. 
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010

4.3.8.  SFP Package.  The SFP package provides guidance for conducting the mission and 
authority to expend STP resources.   It will contain the SFP, MOA, and other 
requirements related documents per STP User’s Guide. 
4.3.8.1.  SFP Package development. The STP Office prepares SFP Packages in 
accordance with its budget and ensures that mission plans, costs, schedule, and risks 
are defined and understood, and that STP resources are used in a cost-effective 
manner consistent with the interests of the DoD. 
4.3.8.2.  Multiple Flights and Re-flights.  At STP’s discretion, an SFP can encompass 
multiple flights.  If experiment Sponsors would like to re-fly an experiment 
previously flown, the re-flight will be handled as a new experiment, and the Sponsors 
will be required to make a new spaceflight request. 
4.3.8.3.  Implementation.  The STP Office will implement the SFP Package and may 
begin as soon as it is approved. 
4.3.9.  Reimbursement for Experiment Changes.  The Sponsor must reimburse the STP 
Office for cost increases resulting from modified experiment requirements, damage to 
support hardware, or delays caused by the experiment.  It is incumbent on the PI to 
inform the STP Office of changes so that an agreement between the STP Office and the 
Sponsor/PI can be negotiated.  The STP Office shall not be liable for damage to, or loss 
of, experiment hardware due to accident or other events beyond its control. 
4.3.9.1.  Reimbursement for Experiment Withdrawal.  The Sponsor must reimburse 
the STP Office for the cost of withdrawing from an approved SFP.  The 
reimbursement requirements should be documented in the MOAs.  The 
reimbursement must cover the costs of mission termination or experiment de-
manifesting as deemed appropriate by the STP Office.  De-manifesting could mean 
replacing the withdrawn experiment with another experiment or mass simulator. 
4.3.9.1.1.  The withdrawing Sponsor must send a letter of intent to withdraw to 
the STP Executive Agent (cc: to the STP Office), signed at the appropriate staff 
level that can make funding decisions on behalf of the Service, Organization, or 
Agency component. 
4.4.  SC Development, Test, and Integration. 
4.4.1.  General.  STP Office can use internal contracts or contracts of other agencies to 
acquire hardware (including advanced hardware for future spaceflight and payload 
support), SC and payload integration services, LVs, and mission data handling services, 
including ephemeris and SC health data.  STP may utilize or support development of new 
lift capabilities or SC when this capability or support proves cost-effective. 
4.4.2.  Services.  Management services provided by the STP Office to the PI will include: 
4.4.2.1.  Program management and systems engineering to ensure information is 
provided to all organizations involved in the program. 
4.4.2.2.  Risk management, including flight safety management for an individual 
mission or among multiple mission elements or SC. 
  14  
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010 
4.4.2.3.  Planning and management of the integration and test of the experiment with 
the SC or launch system. 
4.4.2.4.  Coordinating among Sponsors, PIs, SC, and LV managers. 
4.4.2.5.  Documentation that identifies a standard set of hardware, capabilities, and 
services for manned and unmanned missions. 
4.4.3.  Interface Control 
4.4.3.1.  Payload Integration Meetings.  The STP Office organizes meetings to ensure 
that crucial activities such as design, fabrication, testing, spaceflight qualification, 
safety, and integration of the payload are proceeding on schedule.  STP provides 
assistance by helping resolve problems, guiding the resolution of compromises 
among experiment requirements, and getting timely and detailed information from all 
of the participants who must cooperate to make a spaceflight successful.  PIs are 
expected to support the STP contractor's design reviews.  The STP Office will 
support the experiment contractor's design reviews as required. 
4.4.3.2.  Interface Design Freeze.  While the STP Office aims to accommodate 
experiment changes that offer better performance, it must establish an interface 
design freeze date that all agencies contributing to the spaceflight must recognize.  
Agencies that cannot meet an interface design freeze date (according to the Interface 
Control Document (ICD)) must pay any additional costs caused by the delay or SC 
design changes. 
4.5.  Launch. 
4.5.1.  The STP Office manages SV-to-LV integration for launches on which STP has 
provided the LV.  Responsibilities for integration on launches not owned by STP will be 
specified in the MOAs between the STP Office and those organizations carrying STP 
payloads.  The PI will support the experiment at the launch site as required during pre- 
and post-flight operations.  The STP Office normally provides: 
4.5.2.  Risk management, to include minimizing risk to the experiment by managing 
launch interfaces and launch-related risks, and providing flight safety management 
among mission elements (e.g.; multiple SC deployed from a single LV) and with resident 
space objects (RSOs). 
4.5.3.  Support services and equipment on the LV. 
4.5.4.  Pre-launch system checkout. 
4.5.5.  Payload test and storage facilities at the launch site. 
4.5.6.  Launch services. 
4.6.  On-Orbit Support. 
4.6.1.  The responsibility for orbital support is specified in the associated MOAs found in 
the SFP Package. 
4.6.1.1.  SERB Experiments.  The STP Office may support on-orbit operations for 
SERB payloads for up to one year.  Standard one-year operations includes normal on-
orbit checkout and activation of the SC and experiment (up to 30 days after launch), 
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010 
  15  
followed by collection of a full year of seasonal data, if required.    On a case-by-case 
basis, SERB experiments that require on-orbit operations beyond one year may have 
support extended by approval of the STP Director.  Extended operations agreements 
should be documented in a new or amended MOA.  The experiment Sponsor will 
provide status updates to the STP Office during extended operations.  Should a third 
party request extended on-orbit operations of a particular experiment, this 
arrangement will be documented in a new MOA between the STP Office and the 
requesting organization.  The requesting organization will be wholly responsible for 
the costs of the extended support.  The STP Director will serve as the satellite control 
authority (SCA) for all complete SC STP sponsors for flight through the first year of 
operations consistent with STP funding.  The STP Director may delegate all or part of 
SCA authority on a case-by-case basis as necessary to ensure safe operations. 
4.6.1.2.  Reimbursable Experiments.  On-orbit support for reimbursable (non-SERB) 
customers will be tailored to the needs of the customer. 
4.6.2.  When the STP Office procures or arranges orbital support for SERB payloads, it 
also: 
4.6.2.1.  Provides risk management to include minimizing risk to the experiment 
through conservative flight planning and scheduling, maximizing on-orbit 
opportunities for the PI to perform experiment operations, and providing flight safety 
and orbital safety management among mission elements (e.g., multiple SC deployed 
from an LV) and with RSOs. 
4.6.2.2.  Trains flight crews and flight controllers for manned missions (e.g. Shuttle 
and ISS payloads) as required. 
4.6.2.3.  Provides experimental data, ephemeris, and appropriate SC data to the 
experiment PI or Sponsor for up to one year (or other approved period) of operation. 
4.6.3.  The STP Office may arrange for orbital operations support for SERB experiments 
and reimbursable STP missions via a variety of methods including utilization of SMC 
SDTW ground segment resources, commercial providers, or development of new 
capabilities.  The method will be selected based upon its ability to achieve mission 
objectives and provide best value to the DoD. 
4.6.4.  The Sponsor or PI: 
4.6.4.1.  Supports STP and the operations team in initialization, checkout, flight 
controller and flight crew training as applicable, routine operations, and anomaly 
resolution involving their experiment. 
4.6.4.2.  Reduces, analyzes, interprets, and disseminates data. 
4.6.4.3.  Provides funds for orbital operations beyond 1 year if extended operations 
are desired. In accordance with paragraph 3.7.1.1 
4.7.  Post-Launch and Post-Flight. 
4.7.1.  Post Launch Assessment.  The STP Office, Sponsors, and PIs meet after each 
launch to exchange data and experience, offer recommendations, and document lessons 
learned. 
  16  
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010 
4.7.2.  .After Action Reports. 
4.7.2.1.  SERB payloads.  After a spaceflight, Sponsors and PIs must document 
results by sending DD Form 17212 (or a similar results-orientated report) to the STP 
Office within six months of the completion of the one-year STP mission.  For shorter 
missions such as one-week Shuttle missions, the report is due six months after 
receiving mission data.  As a courtesy, PIs will also provide copies of all papers and 
reports associated with the experiment to STP for retention in the STP Library.  The 
1721-2 can be obtained on the SERB Website. 
4.7.2.2.  Reimbursable payloads.  Not required, but are encouraged. 
4.7.3.  Data Exchange Meetings.  Data Exchange Meetings are held periodically to 
update STP, SAF, and the DoD community on the results of SERB experiments.  When 
convenient, STP Data Exchange meetings will be held in conjunction with a major 
professional aerospace conference.  This allows STP to disseminate information about 
their programs, and PIs can publish their work in a recognized professional proceeding. 
5.  PROGRAMMATIC 
5.1.  Management Reports. 
5.1.1.  The STP Office must prepare the following reports to inform STP EA of STP 
activities: 
5.1.1.1.  Program Status Reports.  The STP Office prepares STP status reports as 
required by the Program Management Directive (PMD) 
5.1.1.2.  Launch Activity.  The STP office notifies STP EA immediately of any 
change in SERB STP mission launch dates and provides launch reports to STP EA, as 
the PMD requires. 
5.1.1.3.  Funding Status.  The STP Office provides reports to STP EA on funding 
status for all SERB STP missions as changes occur per the PMD. 
5.2.  History File.  The STP Office is directed to maintain an STP Library that includes 
copies of all approved DD Forms 1721, 17211 and 1721-2, list of experiments flown, launch 
history, costs, and pictures.  The STP Office will maintain any other information needed to 
properly provide a historical file for the STP program. 
5.3.  Security.  STP is an unclassified program and does not publish an overall security 
guide.  However, STP works with appropriate classified payload offices and their respective 
security guides when dealing with classified data or payloads. 
5.4.  Safety.  Sponsors and PIs must consult applicable DoD, AF, AFSPC, and NASA safety 
regulations early in the experiment design phase with help from the STP Office.  Sponsors 
and PIs must provide the technical documentation required to confirm that the experiment 
meets safety criteria. 
5.5.  Radio Frequency License. 
5.5.1.  For SERB missions which STP acquires the SC, the STP Office arranges for radio 
frequency licensing for the entire system, including the SC, experiments, and ground 
sites.  The PIs support this effort by providing necessary information in a timely manner. 
AFI10-1202  15 NOVEMBER 2010 
  17  
5.5.2.  When the SERB experiment consists of a complete SC requesting only launch or 
operations support from STP, the experiment Sponsor must arrange for radio frequency 
licensing.  This is still true even if STP arranges with the Sponsor to manifest another 
experiment onboard the SC as a piggyback. 
5.5.3.  When the SERB experiment is a piggyback on a non-STP host SV then the 
organization responsible for the host SV arranges for the frequency license for the SV.  If 
the piggyback SERB experiment uses a communications link separate from the SV then 
the PI must arrange for the frequency license for their experiment. 
5.5.4.  For non-SERB payloads, the Sponsor/customer is responsible for all radio 
frequency allocation coordination and approval. 
5.6.  Information Release.  SMC, Office of Public Affairs (SMC/PA) provides the policies 
and procedures for releasing public information about STP launches.  PIs, Sponsors, support 
program offices, and LV offices must comply with applicable MOAs for release of all 
information associated with an STP program.  MOAs will comply with all appropriate 
operational security and freedom of information act requirements.
