Preface
PURPOSE: The purpose of the is publication is to provide tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTP) to effectively employ air mobility liaison officers in support of joint air mobility operations. 
SCOPE: This publication:
• Provides considerations for AMLO mission planning, preparation, and execution in support
of aligned units.
• Provides TTP for AMLO support to joint forcible entry, landing zone, drop zone, defense
support to civil authorities, and evacuation operations.
• Pertains to all certified AMLO personnel and personnel serving in air mobility liaison roles
in both garrison and deployed environments.
APPLICATION: This publication applies to the operating forces of the regular Air Force, Air
Force Reserve, and Air National Guard. TTP publications are not directive. Air Force Instruction
(AFI) 33-360, Publications and Forms Management states, “Complying with publications in this
category is expected, but not mandatory.” The tactics, techniques, and procedures in this docu-
ment are still authoritative; deviations require sound judgment and careful consideration. The
applicable AFI will take precedence in cases where this publication and AFIs conflict. In accor-
dance with DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, the following joint publication
definitions apply:
Tactics—The employment and ordered arrangement of forces in relation to each other.
Techniques—Non-prescriptive ways or methods used to perform missions, functions, or tasks. 
Procedures—Standard, detailed steps that prescribe how to perform specific tasks.

CHAPTER 1
CH1 OVERVIEW
OVERVIEW
1.1 Introduction. The United States (US) Air Force’s ability to provide and project rapid global
mobility supporting the full spectrum of military operations is a vital instrument of national power.
This Air Force tactics, techniques, and procedures (AFTTP) provides the foundation for air
mobility liaison officer (AMLO) operations directly supporting the US Air Force, Air Mobility
Command (AMC), and all joint/coalition users of the air mobility system. The AMLO operates as
a high demand, low-density asset supporting the six basic warfighting functions: command and
control, intelligence, fires, movement and maneuver, protection, and sustainment. Refer to Joint
Publication (JP) 3-0, Joint Operations.
1.2 Doctrine. The foundational doctrine associated with the AMLO mission is based in full
spectrum air mobility employment. The AMLO typically operates alone or in a small team under
mission command-type orders. Mission command is defined in Army Doctrine Publication (ADP)
6-0, Mission Command as the exercise of authority and direction by the commander using mission
orders to enable disciplined initiative within the commander’s intent to empower agile and
adaptive leaders. The definition of mission command from an Army doctrine publication is
indicative of the joint environment the AMLO operates in, and requires awareness of all
applicable joint/Service doctrine to remain relevant during performance of duties.
1.3 Organizations. The AMLO force aligns with organizations containing a wide range of
missions and command relationships. This construct is evident through examination of in-garrison
versus deployed operations. The AMLO force will exercise direct liaison authorized
(DIRLAUTH) with all entities in the air mobility system to ensure mission accomplishment. This
includes but is not limited to: US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM); Air Force
Transportation Component (AFTRANS), also referred to as AMC; all numbered Air Forces, air
operations centers, and associated internal divisions globally; air mobility operation wings, air
ground operation wings, and contingency response forces (CRF); theater deployment distribution
operations centers; air mobility wing operation centers (WOC); mobility tactics offices
worldwide. See Chapter 2, In-Garrison Responsibilities and Chapter 3, Deployed
Responsibilities for more information.
1.4 Mission. The AMLO mission spans strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war as
determined by ground force commander (GFC) intent and level of alignment (corps/division or
below). This mission set is designed to cover the full spectrum of military operations while
meeting the mission essential tasks of the AMLO force: user education, air mobility coordination,
and landing/drop zone operations.
1.4.1 Strategic. The strategic level responsibilities of the AMLO primarily relate to the plans
directorates (e.g., G-5, J-5, A-5) of both garrison and deployed staffs. The AMLO battle
rhythm should include regular touch-points with their parent transregional combatant
commander (USTRANSCOM) in order to stay abreast of policies and procedures that impact
air mobility users. The AMLO facilitates the coordination of the AMC/A3 and supported
unit’s air transportation plan (ATP). When signed, the ATP formulates key facts and
assumptions for operation plan (OPLAN) and crisis action planning (CAP) event execution for
all combatant commands. ATPs list transported elements, required transportation methods,
discuss feasibility of operations, and establish hierarchies of support required for full
1-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
mobilization. See Chapter 4, Strategic Operations and Chapter 5, Operational Planning for
more information.
1.4.2 Operational. Operational level responsibilities flow from strategic plans into more
detailed operational analysis. This is normally accomplished in the CAP process employing
joint planning process (JPP), military decision-making process (MDMP), or Marine Corps
planning process (MCPP). Here the AMLO actively integrates to ensure air mobility
holistically supports the GFC’s intent. The resultant course of action (COA) should meet
desired criteria of suitable, feasible, and distinguishable—being fully supportable by air
mobility. Successful accomplishment means a clear visualization of phase zero through five
operations coming to fruition in the resultant time-phased force and deployment list (TPFDL).
1.4.3 Tactical. Tactical level responsibilities include guiding the aligned unit through the
forward deployment process, assisting where necessary to enable follow on air mobility
intratheater requirements in the deployed area of operations (AO), and posturing at an
operational seam to maintain awareness of possible issues throughout the forward area. The
AMLO is uniquely trained to support drop zone (DZ) and landing zone (LZ) operations, either
directly or as a force multiplier by training others in accordance with Air Force Instruction
(AFI) 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations.

CHAPTER 2
CH2 IN-GARRISON RESPONSIBILITIES
IN-GARRISON RESPONSIBILITIES
2.1 Overview. This chapter describes an AMLO’s mission essential tasks while in-garrison.
AMLOs integrate with command and control, advise on air mobility capabilities and limitations,
and perform and enable landing and drop zone operations. AMLOs serve as an embedded focal
point for airlift mission planning, capable of understanding both AMC and aligned unit mobility
requirements. Being an active part of staff meetings, operation syncs, planning conferences, and
exercises help an AMLO successfully integrate with the supported unit.
2.2 Operating Location. The operating location (OL) chief AMLO is responsible for the daily
operations. Responsibilities include both administrative and operational coordination with higher
headquarters (HHQ). In garrison and deployed, AMC/A3 retains operational control (OPCON) of
all AMC assigned AMLOs. AMLOs are granted DIRLAUTH with functional and geographic air
operations centers, joint deployment, and distribution operations center (JDDOC), commanders
and other agencies, to facilitate information flow and support their assigned OL.
2.3 Integration. To integrate with the supported unit command and control, AMLOs should
network, attend meetings, and establish working space within the appropriate organizations.
2.3.1 Work Location. AMLOs should physically collocate with the G-3, G-4, and if possible
the chief of staff. An OL with multiple AMLOs can assign one to each office and with the
remaining AMLOs rotating between the G-3 and G-4 sections of division/corps staff.
2.3.2 Networking. An AMLO should develop a face-to-face battle rhythm in order to
understand the sustainment and air mobility issues affecting their aligned unit. In order to
effectively support the aligned unit, AMLOs require a clear understanding of the operational
or exercise scheme of maneuver; thus, regular interaction with the G-3/S-3 is crucial. AMLOs
should coordinate with many different offices and be physically available to the staff (i.e.,
walk-abouts). AMLOs should integrate with the following offices as applicable:
2.3.2.1 US Army. Division and corps level staffs are referred to as “G staffs” (e.g., G-3,
G-4) while the brigade and below staffs utilize “S” (e.g., S-3, S-4). AMLOs should focus
efforts at higher echelons but also understand lower echelon needs during major exercises
and deployments. Below are recommended interactions and should be tailored to the needs
and manning of the OL.
2.3.2.1.1 Commanders. Army division and corps commanders are commanding
general (CG), deputy CG of maneuver (DCGM), and deputy CG of sustainment
(DCGS). An AMLO should meet with the commander(s) regularly to understand and
confirm commander’s intent. Command level engagements can guide overall training
event requests by the unit for the next one to two years.
2.3.2.1.2 Chief of Staff (COS). AMLOs may work with the COS on a regular basis in
order to further the CG’s goals/intent.
2.3.2.1.3 G-3 (Operations). The G-3 integrates the entire staff toward operational
objectives. AMLOs coordinate closely with the G-3 in order to support local training,
deployments, and exercises.
2-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
2.3.2.1.4 G-3 (Air). The division air shop often handles current air movement
logistics, especially during initial deployment. It is the primary focal point for army
rotary wing aviation support. Some locations noted this office as their closest contact.
2.3.2.1.5 G-3 Emergency Deployment Readiness Exercise (EDRE). Units may have a
specific EDRE point of contact who coordinates local exercises.
2.3.2.1.6 G-4 (Logistics). Tie in with the corps transportation officer (CTO), division
transportation officer (DTO), and mobility warrant to understand supported unit’s
sustainment requirements.
2.3.2.1.7 G-4 DTO. The DTO is a staff officer normally assigned in the G-4
sustainment cell of the division headquarters (HQ) responsible for the movement of
units and maneuver elements in coordination with the division G-3. Additionally, the
DTO is a staff planner that advises the commander and coordinates transportation
support with the division G-3 and G-4. Refer to Army Techniques Publication (ATP)
4-16, Movement Control.
2.3.2.1.8 G-4 Mobility Warrant. The mobility warrant works for the DTO and is an
expert in Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES), time-phased force
and deployment data (TPFDD), and Integrated Computerized Deployment System
(ICODES). Battalions and companies have unit movement officers (UMO) who
coordinate movements at lower echelons. Coordination with the mobility warrant
provides a valuable connection and point of entry into other related offices.
2.3.2.1.9 G-5 (Plans). The future plans office provides the AMLO the ability to
understand and integrate with future requirements and notify USTRANSCOM and
AMC/A3 of large movements or exercises.
2.3.2.1.10 G-6 (Communications). Computer network, email, and radio support are
required to integrate into the OL. AMC coordinates sister Service support agreements
to ensure AMLOs obtain basic communication support from the aligned unit to include
access to unclassified and classified networks and secure cryptological keys.
2.3.2.1.11 Most OLs may have a primary port (e.g., installation transportation office,
aerial port, arrival/departure airfield control group [A/DACG]) to handle the majority
of unit air movement. AMLOs should establish and maintain a close working
relationship with airfield personnel to assist with smooth movement of assigned OL
units.
2.3.2.1.12 Sustainment Brigade. The sustainment brigade (BDE) plans movements,
loads aircraft, and provide in-transit visibility (ITV) of movements. Sustainment BDE
might want to be involved with local exercises. AMLOs may coordinate with the BDE
commander, XO, S-3, S-4, movement control team (MCT), or movement control
battalion (MCB). Refer to ATP 4-93, Sustainment Brigade for more information.
2.3.2.1.13 Range Control. At most OLs, range control functions as the primary point
of contact (POC) for landing and drop zone operations. Many require range specific
certifications and have unique scheduling requirements. It is essential for the AMLO to
understand range control’s specific processes and interface between range, fire
response, squadron tacticians, and aircrews.
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
2-3
2.3.2.1.14 Fire Department. Contact range control or the local fire department to
understand the local coordination and reimbursement for the airfields in your area.
2.3.2.1.15 Airfield Manager. If assigned, coordinate with the airfield manager for
parking, fuel, loading, security, and other logistics as needed.
2.3.2.2 US Marine Corps. AMLOs are assigned at the Marine expeditionary force (MEF)
and United States Marine Corps Forces, Special Operations Command (MARSOC) level.
Differences from Army organizations include:
2.3.2.2.1 II MEF operates an organic aerial port of embarkation (APOE) and conducts
joint inspection (JI) on their equipment.
2.3.2.2.2 I MEF and III MEF have Air Force APOEs that serve as their primary
APOE.
2.3.2.2.3 G-3 Air at the MEF level normally works Marine Air Wing training and
deployments. AMLO support may include tanker support to Coronets.
2.3.2.2.4 G-3 EDRE does not exist.
2.3.2.2.5 G-4 DTO does not exist.
2.3.2.2.6 G-4 Strategic Mobility Office (SMO). The SMO is where most Marine
Corps AMLOs have their desk. The SMO manages deployment and redeployment for
real-world tasking and exercises. The ATP staffing will normally originate out of the
G-4 SMO office. If a MEF stands up a MEF deployment and distribution operations
center (DDOC), it is formed out of the G-4 SMO with augmentation.
2.3.2.2.7 G-4 SMO Air. Office in charge of strategic air and all air not handled by the
distribution officer. Typically led by chief warrant officer.
2.3.2.2.8 G-4 Distribution. The Marine Corps differentiates embark and distribution.
Embark handles deployment and redeployment. Distribution handles sustainment
requirements. Distribution normally handles channel air requirements to include the
personnel channels used for small numbers of deployers out of Norfolk, Virginia;
Baltimore, Maryland; or Seattle, Washington.
2.3.2.3 Air Operations Center (AOC). Below are the 618 AOC directorates. See Figure
2.1, 618 AOC Directorates. Offices for AMLO coordination are bolded below, but not in
bold italics (i.e., XOOO, XOPC, XOPF, XOGX, XOBC, XOCM, XOCG, XOCR).
2.3.2.3.1 Strategy Division (SRD). SRD is the future operations cell for 618 AOC and
coordinates with USTRANSCOM future operations. SRD monitors requirements for
future exercises and operations (sand charts).
2.3.2.3.2 Current Operations (XOO). Plans and monitors organic airlift, commercial
airlift, and air refueling missions. XOO is the focal point for tanker/airlift special
access required programs.

Table 2.3, Drop Zone Operations In-Garrison.
Table 2.3 Drop Zone Operations In-Garrison
2.7 Mission Study. AMLOs should be well versed in the missions and operations of the
supported units.
2.7.1 Operation Plan. AMLOs should be familiar with OPLANs of the supported unit and
how the plans pertain to airlift. In the case of contingency, the OL AMLO may be the critical
link between the supported unit, AMC/A3, and theater airlift assets. Additionally, AMLOs
may be able to provide critical feedback before an emergency. Check with the intelligence or
plans directorate (i.e., G-2/S-2, G-5/S-5) to get read in on these plans.
2.7.2 Air Transportation Plan. ATPs are established at the AMC/A5, Army Corps, and
MEF level. These ATPs establish the framework for AMC/A3 to support a contingency
deployment of the supported units. The AMLO should liaise between AMC/A3, supported
unit, and agency staffs.
2.8 AMLO Support. AMLOs should coordinate with the aligned unit for deployable gear to
ensure uniformity. It is possible to get an initial issue of Army training equipment through the
central issue facility (CIF). If deployment orders are received promptly, it is possible to receive
Army deployment issue from request for information (RFI). US Air Force specific gear is
distributed by the supporting administrative control unit.
• Coordinate for landing zone (LZ) surveys and input into zone availability report (ZAR)/Talon
Point.
• Identify suitable LZ locations.
• Conduct LZ feasibility analysis.
• Coordinate LZ surface repair and control procedures.
• Coordinate airspace management procedures.
• Coordinate and/or establish LZ support (e.g., security; crash, fire, and rescue [CFR]; materials
handling equipment [MHE]/transportation).
• Perform landing zone safety officer (LZSO) functions.
• Train others to perform LZSO functions.
• Identify suitable drop zone (DZ) locations.
• Conduct DZ survey.
• Set up DZ.
• Perform drop zone control officer (DZCO) functions.
• Train others to perform DZCO functions.
• Maintain secure-capable radio/visual connectivity with aircraft.
• Maintain secure-capable connectivity with command and control (C2) agencies.

AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
2.8.1 USAF Expeditionary Center (EC). For most AMC assigned AMLOs, administrative
control (ADCON) is assigned to the USAF EC. The EC is responsible to resource and provide
ready, trained AMC AMLOs through the 621st Mobility Support Operations Squadron
(MSOS), residing under the 621st Contingency Response Wing (CRW) and the 621st Air
Mobility Advisory Group (AMAG).
2.8.2 Air Support Operations Group/Air Support Operations Squadron. For USAFE
and Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) assigned AMLOs, ADCON is assigned to the air support
operations group (ASOG)/air support operations squadron (ASOS), and operational support
squadron (OSS) to which the AMLO is assigned. The ASOG, ASOS, and OSS is responsible
to organize, train, and equip USAFE and PACAF AMLOs. Many AMC OLs have a collocated
ASOS available to provide training, logistical, or administrative support.
2.8.3 Air Force Weather Detachment. Many OLs have collocated Air Force weather
squadrons available to provide AMLO training, logistical, and administrative support.
2.8.4 Host Installation. The servicing base is usually the nearest (or most convenient) Air
Force base that provides standard Air Force finance, medical, training, and equipment support.
2.8.5 18th Air Force (AF). For AMC assigned AMLOs not assigned to the EC, ADCON is
assigned to the 18 AF. The 18 AF is then responsible to resource and provide ready, trained
AMC AMLOs through the 34th Combat Training Squadron (CTS) residing under the 19th
Airlift Wing (AW) and the 19th Operations Group (OG).
2.8.6 AMC/A3. AMC/A3 is assigned lead MAJCOM functional area manager
responsibilities for AMLOs. AMC/A3 is responsible to provide oversight, doctrine, policy,
and guidance; and to organize, train, and equip AMLOs, validate requirements; and task
AMLOs.
2.9 Combat Mission Readiness. AMLOs should reference the applicable local training plan and
combat mission readiness requirements in order to understand the operating environment and
identify the OL POCs for coordination.

CHAPTER 3
CH3 DEPLOYED RESPONSIBILITIES
DEPLOYED RESPONSIBILITIES
3.1 Overview. Deployed AMLO mission essential tasks remain the same as in garrison.
Deployed operations lend themselves to unique command and control structures and additional
responsibilities. 
3.2 Integration. AMLOs may deploy in support of their aligned unit or simply on behalf of
AMC/A3 in response to a tasking for general AMLO support. In either case, USTRANSCOM and
AMC retain operational control of deployed AMLOs in almost all circumstances. AMLOs
continue to integrate and network with staffs while exercising DIRLAUTH. 
3.2.1 Work Location. Integration with supported units is dependent on the mission and C2
structure of the particular AOR. Collocation with a ground forces element is standard. If the
AMLO is not collocated with decision making organizations under the joint/coalition forces
land component commander (CFLCC), it may be difficult to affect future operational
planning. AMLOs should work to identify the leadership in charge of air logistical operations.
Once identified, the AMLO can add value by injecting air operational knowledge into
operational level planning.
3.2.2 Networking. AMLOs should integrate with the following organizations:
3.2.2.1 Service Component Staffs. The Army forces (ARFOR) is the Army component
and senior Army headquarters of all Army forces assigned or attached to a combatant
command, subordinate joint force command, joint functional command, or multinational
command. The ARFOR G-4 works to implement and prioritize most of the logistics
requests from deployed combat units and understands overall CFLCC intent. The G-4 is
where many potential prioritization and logistics problems can be identified and fixed at a
macro level. Refer to Field Manual (FM) 3-94, Theater Army, Corps, and Division
Operations.
3.2.2.2 AMC/A3. AMC/A3 is charged with executing the commander, Air Mobility
Command warfighting mission and lead MAJCOM responsibilities for AMLOs, both in
garrison and while deployed. AMC/A3 provides general officer level guidance for AMLO
operations in garrison and when forward deployed. AMC/A3 staff performs organize,
train, and equip responsibilities; provides operational and tactical level guidance on
AMLO roles and responsibilities; serves as the primary touch point for most joint
operational planning and coordination issues outside of current execution; tasking
authority for operational and tactical AMLO missions.
3.2.2.3 Functional Component Staffs (J-3/J-4/J-5). AMLOs should interact with these
offices daily to develop relationships and share information.
3.2.2.4 Joint Task Force (JTF) Staff. AMLOs integrate with all JTF staff echelons. It is
important to introduce AMLO capabilities. For example, JTF staffs are often unaware of
AMLOs DIRLAUTH with USTRANSCOM, director of mobility forces (DIRMOBFOR),
and AMC/A3. Refer to JP 4-0, Joint Logistics and JP 4-09, Distribution Operations.
3.2.2.4.1 J-3. Engage with the J-3 and be the face to air mobility during current
operations.
3-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
3.2.2.4.2 J-4. Work with the J-4 and assist with planning, logistics, and air mobility
within the respective AOR.
3.2.2.4.3 Division or Corps Transportation Officer (DTO/CTO). The DTO performs
similar roles as in garrison. See paragraph 2.3.2.1.7. The deployed DTO will plug
into the theater sustainment entities.
3.2.2.4.4 J-5. Plan with the J-5 for future operations and the capabilities of air mobility
assets including airfield openings, closings, and expansion along with the threat
assessments that will occur during these changes. Refer to JP 4-0 and JP 4-09.
3.2.2.4.5 Theater Sustainment Command (TSC). The TSC is focused on strategic and
operational sustainment management for a specific theater. The TSC and its
subordinate units are assigned to an Army Service component command (ASCC)
supporting a geographic combatant commander (GCC). The TSC is a fixed
headquarters organization comprised of a command group, staff, and special troops
battalion. It can deploy an expeditionary sustainment command (ESC) when the TSC
determines that a forward command is required. Refer to ATP 4-94, Theater
Sustainment Command for more information.
3.2.2.4.6 Expeditionary Sustainment Command (ESC). The ESC is one level below
the TSC and is placed closer to the fight. The role of the ESC is to deploy to an AO and
provide mission command capabilities when multiple sustainment brigades are
employed or when the TSC determines that a forward command is required. The ESC
may be employed directly under the mission command of the corps, ARFOR, or JTF as
designated by an appropriate order. The forward deployment of the ESC facilitates
agile and responsive support by placing the ESC in relative proximity of the supported
force and its operational environment. Refer to ATP 4-94 for more information. See
Figure 3.1, Movement Control Relationships in the Theater Distribution Network.
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
3-3
Figure 3.1 Movement Control Relationships in the Theater Distribution Network
3.2.2.5 Sustainment Brigade. The sustainment brigade is a flexible, tailorable
organization. All sustainment brigade headquarters are identical in organizational structure
and capabilities. The core competency of the sustainment brigade is mission command of
logistics operations, providing command and staff supervision of life support activities,
and distribution management to include movement control as an integral component of the
theater distribution network. The sustainment brigade will not normally provide mission
command for a MCB. The operational environment may dictate this command relationship
if, for example, the sustainment brigade is the senior Army sustainment headquarters for
that operational area (OA) as was the case in the early stages of Operation ENDURING
FREEDOM. Sustainment brigades will not normally provide mission command for MCTs,
but as mentioned previously with the MCB, the operational environment will determine
the command relationships. A sustainment brigade, with an attached transportation theater
opening element, could provide mission command of MCTs during early entry operations
until an MCB arrives or if the number of MCTs (fewer than 4) for the operation does not
require an MCB. Refer to ATP 4-16 and ATP 4-93.
3.2.2.6 Movement Control Battalions (MCB). The TSC/ESC manages intratheater
movements through its subordinate MCBs. There may be multiple regional MCBs under
each TSC/ESC. See Figure 3.2, Movement Control Battalions in the Movement Request
Process. Refer to JP 4-09 and ATP 4-16 for more information.

3.2.2.8 Deployment and Distribution Operations Center (DDOC). GCCs can create a
DDOC (e.g., CDDOC = Central Command DDOC) and incorporate its capabilities into
their staff functions. The theater DDOC develops deployment and distribution plans;
integrates multinational and/or interagency deployment and distribution; and coordinates
and synchronizes supply, transportation, and related distribution activities. The DDOC
synchronizes the strategic to operational movement of forces and sustainment into theater
by providing advance notice to GCC air and surface theater movement control elements. In
concert with GCC priorities, and on behalf of the GCC, the DDOC coordinates
common-user and theater distribution operations above the tactical level. See Figure 3.4,
DDOC and JDDOC. USTRANSCOM houses the trans-regional, global DDOC at Scott
Air Force Base and it is commonly referred to as simply “DDOC.” Refer to JP 4-09.

3.2.2.9 Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR). The DIRMOBFOR functions as
coordinating authority for air mobility with all commands and agencies, both internal and
external to the JTF. The DIRMOBFOR exercises coordinating authority among theater
AOC (or theater joint air operations center [JAOC], if established), 618 AOC, and the
JMC/DDOC, for air mobility issues. An essential role for the DIRMOBFOR is serving as
the principal interface between the JAOC, the theater’s logistics directorate of a joint staff
(J-4), and the JMC/DDOC to ensure appropriate prioritization of air mobility tasks. Refer
to JP 3-17, Air Mobility Operations.
3.2.2.10 Joint Air Operations Center (JAOC). The JAOC is the air planning and execution
focal point for the JTF (or other subordinate command).
3.2.2.11 Air Mobility Division (AMD). Centralized planning, direction, and coordination
of air mobility operations occur in the air mobility division of the AOC. AMLOs may
work with multiple AOCs in one theater. Refer to JP 3-17.
3.2.2.12 United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). The fusion cell/floor
is the primary location for AMLOs to integrate into USTRANSCOM. The 618
AOC/XOPC/verifications office is located on the USTRANSCOM floor. The verification
shop receives initial load plans from the units, check them for correctness, and verifies the
load plans match JOPES and TPFDD. If there is a consistent problem with load plans from
a single unit, the unit AMLO can help solve the problem through face to face contact or
synchronization with AMC contingency load planning teams.

3.2.3 Intratheater Travel. The ability to quickly move throughout the AOR enables the
AMLO to see various components of the air mobility deployed structure and in turn build
credibility during the planning process. An AMLO can provide ground truth to planners.
Traveling to different airfields enhances scope of understanding for the air mobility processes
and in-turn can provide problem solving options to each unit supported.
3.2.3.1 Air Force Fixed-Wing. AMLOs should obtain a mission essential personnel
(MEP) letter from each AOC or air expeditionary group (AEG) prior to arriving in the
AOR. This MEP letter ensures access to US Air Force flights without having to be
manifested as a passenger. Currently, the AMLO functional area manager (FAM) will
arrange this MEP through AMC (at Scott AFB) and the DIRMOBFOR in theater. All MEP
personnel are considered part of the aircrew and will not be removed unless the aircraft
commander deems it necessary. Consider the following when using the MEP process:
• Immature theaters may only have unpredictable contingency flight options.
• Mature theaters will allow for channel mission MEP flights. 
• Ensure Single Mobility System (SMS) and Global Decision Support System II
(GDSS2) account are current.
3.2.3.2 Marine Corps Fixed-Wing. Most Marine Corps flights are shown on SMS/GDSS2
because they are on the ATO. Flights fly to limited locations due the small amount of
aircraft available.
3.2.3.3 US Army Rotary. The Army uses air mission requests (AMR) to request rotary
wing lift. Travel is arranged through the supported G-3/S-3. This is the best option for
austere locations or short distance travel (e.g., FOBs) due to most Marine Corps air is in
direct support of Marine Corps forces and not a theater asset. When traveling via Army
rotary, request travel at least 72 hours prior with an AMR. In most cases, AMLOs are
considered space available (Space-A) inside of 72 hours. AMLOs should know the
processes and personnel responsible for the AMR process because they can secure flights
quicker if the roles and capabilities of an AMLO are understood.
3.2.3.4 DOS/Civilian Flights. In many cases, flying via non-military means is the only
way to get to a destination. The DOS might have a flight system established to move
between forward operating bases (FOB) and outlying airfields. These flights likely require
a funding source from the headquarters supported. Commercial flights may need to be
booked for the same reasons and may require Defense Transportation System (DTS)
authorizations.
3.2.4 Ground. Some locations may only be accessible via convoy. Ground movements are
typically scheduled through either the S-4, or more likely, the local sustainment
brigade/command. Before traveling via convoy, notify leadership of travel objectives,
intentions, and what size force (e.g., squad, platoon) is providing security for the convoy.
Additional considerations are presence of a route clearance team, close air support (CAS),
expected timelines of visited locations, and a means of providing updates throughout the
operation.
3.3 Advise on Air Mobility Capabilities and Limitations. Deployed staff battle rhythms
include working groups and boards. Attending meetings throughout the logistics chain will
3-8
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
expand your situational awareness. The J-4 uses a series of boards, offices, and centers to
prioritize and accomplish tasks. The primary organizations involved in the distribution
management functions are the DDOC, joint logistics operations center (JLOC), theater-joint
transportation board (T-JTB), joint transportation board (JTB), and other management boards, as
required. Other beneficial meetings to participate in are G-3/S-3 synchronization and G-4/DTO
meetings. If participating in G-3 meetings, the AMLO will have the added benefit of being better
aligned with the CFLCC, aligned unit chief of staff, and/or the deputy commanding generals of
both sustainment and maneuver.
3.3.1 Senior Airfield Authority (SAA). In order to facilitate C2 at a joint use airfield, the
joint force commander (JFC) designates a SAA for safe airfield operations. The SAA controls
the airfield access and coordinates for airfield security with the base commander, base cluster
commander, or the joint security coordinator for the area, if a base commander has not been
designated. Refer to JP 3-17.
3.3.2 Tower Operations. Air traffic control via a tower will vary between each airfield. In
many contingency operations, there may not be a tower and all air operations will be
controlled with a vehicle or on a high spot near the airfield. As an AMLO, it is important to
visit each tower and understand the workload. Towers may be manned by host nation (HN)
personnel, military operators, or contractors. Each towered airfield will operate differently and
can provide a unique challenge to aircrew.
3.3.3 Airfield Lighting. Not every airfield will be built with airfield lighting that meets
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards. Many contingency airfields are
LZs utilizing a variation of AFI 13-217 airfield marking patterns (AMP). Fixed lighting with
dedicated power is difficult and costly to install. Other options include solar airfield lighting or
portable overt/covert lights. Solar lighting tends to be slightly dimmer than direct powered
lighting, but it can be placed anywhere on airfield. These solar lights can be set to
automatically turn on at night or via a radio frequency (RF) signal.
3.3.4 AMC Airfield Assessment Teams. Air Force forces (AFFOR) A-4 has designated
teams to visit airfields and provide assessments on longevity of suitability of runway.
3.3.4.1 AMC Form 174. The AMC Form 174, Airfield Survey is a detailed assessment
report of the airfield. It usually contains pictures and engineering diagrams with detailed
measurements of all surfaces (e.g., runways, taxiways, ramps). Results of these
assessments are documented in the Giant Report.
3.3.5 Terminal En-Route Procedures Specialist (TERPS). AMLOs 
may 
need 
to
coordinate with HN and/or AMC TERPS offices in order to solve issues.
3.4 Landing Zone and Drop Zone Operations. Security forces may be required in contingency
environments. If in mountainous terrain, AMLOs may need AMC/A3X/AFFOR TERPS
assistance. AMLOs should review the ACO for specific airspace information. See Chapter 9,
Landing Zone Operations and Chapter 10, Drop Zone Operations.

CHAPTER 4
CH4 STRATEGIC OPERATIONS
STRATEGIC OPERATIONS
4.1 Overview. The strategic level of warfare typically centers on the nation’s highest level of
civilian and military leaders (e.g., President of the United States [POTUS], Secretary of Defense
[SecDef], combatant commander [CCDR]). The majority of AMLOs operate at the periphery of
strategic operations. AMLOs retain relationships with combatant commands through DIRLAUTH
and leveraging USTRANSCOM LNOs. For example, AMLOs assigned at a corps, MEF, or
division level may be required to assist with the development and coordination of OPLANs, Joint
Chiefs of Staff directed exercises, and AMC/A5 ATP supporting the strategic mobility enterprise.
AMLOs permanently reside at the component command level or its equivalent and in deployed
environments align with the JTF headquarters in some capacity. AMLOs can have strategic level
impact by evaluating, identifying, and communicating any risks to the nation’s global air mobility
system.
4.2 Air Transportation Plan. The ATP is equivalent to a Department of Defense (DOD)
Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) System, Level-2 type Base Plan. This enables the
smooth and timely execution of a sister-Service unit’s deployment from garrison locations.
Essentially, the ATP establishes a framework for how AMC will execute a large-scale force
movement from a specific APOE. Signed by the AMC commander and supported Service
commander, the ATP and respective annexes assists AFTRANS personnel by setting expectations,
minimizing surprises, and reducing operational risks and deployment timelines during a dynamic
situation. Although the supported commander additionally signs the ATP to validate key
assumptions, planning factors, and limitations, the ATP is not contractual or directive but rather
serves solely as an AMC planning tool.
4.2.1 Organization and Structure. The ATP consists of two parts: (1) base plan, (2)
individual annexes. Base plans align with the corps and MEF levels (e.g., XVIII Airborne
Corps, III MEF). Each plan includes an annex for each subordinate unit. For example, XVIII
Airborne Corps’ base plan includes one annex for Fort Bragg, North Carolina and another one
for Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Each base plan contains information applicable to all
subordinate units while each annex contains information peculiar to a specific APOE (e.g.,
tailored airlift and augmentation matrices). To facilitate joint understanding, both the base
plans and annexes are structured using the five-paragraph joint operation plan format:
situation, mission, execution, administration and logistics, and command and control.
4.2.2 AMLO Responsibilities. The primary point of contact for all ATPs resides in the AMC
staff and development is a staff-to-staff function between AMC and the supported unit. The
AMLO role in ATP development is to facilitate the overall coordination and provide any
missing information as required during the process. AMC/A5F is the office of primary
responsibility for ATP development, coordination, and review.
4.3 AMLO Support to Component Commands. AMLOs currently support the following
component command level organizations: Eighth Army, joint special operations command
(JSOC), MARSOC, US Army Africa (USARAF), US Army Europe (USAREUR), and US Army
North (ARNORTH). At this level AMLOs focus on the nexus between strategy and operational art
shaped by each theater’s operational environment. AMLOs navigate multiple higher headquarter,
and non-military staffs to provide innovative solutions for the given requirements. For example:
4-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
• Eighth Army AMLO provides support in the context of a seemingly tenuous armistice.
• ARNORTH AMLO provides support while integrating in the defense support of civil
authorities (DSCA) process.
• USARAF AMLO provides assistance for a 53-country AOR, facing the tyranny of distance
with an underdeveloped logistical system, and an overabundance of political rivalries and
violent extremist organizations.
4.4 Global Air Mobility System Assessments. It is incumbent for every AMLO to continuously
evaluate the global air mobility system’s operations, specifically looking for and communicating
to leadership as soon as possible any unknown risks that may have unintended consequences. JP
3-0 observes that tactical actions can cause both intended and unintended strategic consequences,
particularly in today’s environment of pervasive and immediate global communications and
networked threats. An AMLO can better detect and evaluate these risks by seeking to understand
the current strategic environment and the national strategic direction.
4.5 Resources. The following abbreviated list of documents provide a brief synopsis of the
nation’s current strategic direction and guidance as well as USTRANSCOM plans to meet GCC
theater campaign plan requirements. Comprehension of these strategic documents provides an
AMLO with a better understanding of where the supported unit fits into the national context and
enables the AMLO to identify small friction points in the global mobility system that may have a
larger strategic impact.
• National Security Strategy.
• National Defense Strategy.
• National Military Strategy.
• Joint Strategic Intelligence Assessment.
• USTRANSCOM Campaign Plan for Global Distribution.
• Applicable GCC Theater Campaign Plan.
• Applicable GCC Theater Distribution Plan.
4.6 Points of Contact.
4.6.1 Applicable Theater USTRANSCOM LNO. USTRANSCOM maintains a network of
civilian and military liaisons aligned with theater combatant commands. These individuals
represent another layer of networking available to every AMLO.
4.6.2 A-5 and Strategy Directorates. The plans and strategy directorates create rapid global
mobility support plans for major contingencies, identifying required airlift, air refueling,
aeromedical evacuation, and global air mobility support system (GAMSS) forces required to
support OPLANs, CONPLANs, and contingency plans.
4.6.3 618 AOC Strategy Directorate. The SRD enables the 618 AOC effective and timely
situational awareness and understanding of supported commander’s intents, objectives, and
desired effects to inform the planning, tasking, execution, and assessment of the AFTRANS
delivery of air mobility requirements.

CHAPTER 5
CH5 OPERATIONAL PLANNING
OPERATIONAL PLANNING
5.1 Overview. The operational level of warfare links the tactical employment of forces to
national strategic objectives. The focus at this level is on the planning and execution of operations
using operational art: the cognitive approach by commanders and staffs—supported by their skill,
knowledge, and experience—to plan and execute (when required) strategies, campaigns, and
operations to organize and employ military capabilities by integrating ends, ways, and available
means. JFCs and component commanders use operational art to determine how, when, where, and
for what purpose military forces will be employed, to influence the adversary’s disposition before
combat, to deter adversaries from supporting enemy activities, and to assure our partner nations
achieve operational and strategic objectives. Many factors affect relationships among leaders at
these levels. Service and functional component commanders of a joint force do not plan the
actions of their forces in a vacuum; they and their staffs collaborate with the operational-level JFC
to plan the joint operation. This collaboration facilitates the components’ planning and execution.
Likewise, the operational-level JFC and staff typically collaborate with the CCDR to frame theater
strategic objectives, as well as tasks the CCDR will eventually assign to the subordinate joint
force. Refer to JP 3-0 for more information.
5.2 AMLO Responsibilities. Operational planning is an AMLO core task. AMLOs serve as the
Air Force bridge to Army and Marine Corps staffs, to provide detailed advice for all air mobility
logistics efforts. AMLO knowledge and command relationships are critical to enabling unified
actions at the operational level of warfare. These relationships are vital to ensure efficiencies and
proactively solve problems. An AMLO should be engaged in operational planning teams (OPT) as
early as possible. See Chapter 2, In-Garrison Responsibilities and Chapter 3, Deployed
Responsibilities for potential coordinating organizations.
5.3 Mission Planning Methodologies. The DOD contains multiple planning methods that exist
at the joint force level as well as within each individual Service. An AMLO needs to have a basic
awareness of the following processes to be an effective partner: the JPP, the Army MDMP, the
USMC MCPP, and the USAF mission, environment, enemy, effects, capabilities - plan, phasing,
contracts, and contingencies (ME3C-[PC]2) process. See Figure 5.1, Joint Planning Example and
Table 5.1, Planning Example.
5.3.1 Joint Planning Process (JPP). Joint planning is conducted through a disciplined
process by policies and procedures established in the JOPES and the JPP displayed in Figure
5.1. In addition to facilitating contingency planning, these processes have additional
procedures for crisis action planning and for time-sensitive development of operation orders
when a forcible entry operation requirement occurs with little or no warning. Refer to JP 5-0,
Joint Planning for more information.
5-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
Figure 5.1 Joint Planning Example
5.3.2 Army Design Methodology. The Army design methodology applies critical and
creative thinking to understand, visualize, and describe unfamiliar problems and approaches to
solving them. Army design methodology is an iterative process of understanding and problem
framing utilizing elements of operational art to conceive and construct an operational
approach to solve identified problems. Commanders and their staffs use Army design
methodology to assist them with the conceptual aspects of planning. It results in an improved
understanding of the operational environment, a problem statement, an initial commander’s
intent, and an operational approach that serves as the link between conceptual and detailed
planning. Based on its outcome, commanders issue planning guidance, to include an
operational approach, to guide more detailed planning using the MDMP. Refer to ADP 5-0,
Operations Process for more information.
5.3.3 Military Decision Making Process (MDMP). MDMP is a single, established, and
proven analytical process that relies on doctrine, especially the terms and symbols found in
Army Doctrine Publication (ADP) 1-02, Terms and Military Symbols. The MDMP helps the
commander and his or her staff examine a battlefield situation and reach logical decisions. The
full MDMP is a detailed, deliberate, sequential, and time-consuming process used when
adequate planning time and sufficient staff support are available. This methodology is not used
at the company level (or equivalent) and below since they are not afforded a large enough
staff. Figure 5.2, Military Decision Making Process outlines the 7-steps of MDMP. AMLOs
should be familiar with each step when working at the battalion level and above. Refer to ADP
5-0 for more detail.

5.3.4 Marine Corps Planning Process (MCPP). The Marine Corps planning process is a
six-step process comprised of problem framing, COA development, COA war gaming, COA
comparison and decision, orders development, and transition. The Marine Corps often
operates in a joint environment, where the MCPP is the vehicle through which commanders
and their staffs (in the operation forces) provide input to the joint planning process. Refer to
Marine Corps Warfighting Publication (MCWP) 5-10, Marine Corps Planning Process. See
Figure 5.3, Marine Corps Planning Process.

5.3.4.1 ME3C-(PC)2. This is a methodology developed for air-centric mission planning
cells (MPC) and incorporates theater AOC planning processes. The goal is to create a
successful MPC through the effective employment of airpower in support of commander’s
intent. MPCs should use this process to determine and communicate mission objectives to
fully support this intent. Commander’s intent in can be found in the air operations directive
(AOD), ATO, or other JFACC directives, like fragmentary orders (FRAGORD). AMLOs
should become familiar with the ME3C-(PC)2 process found in AFTTP 3-1, General
Planning, Chapter 3.2 and the AOC air mobility structure and planning processes found in
AFTTP 3-3, AOC, Chapter 7.

Table 5.1 Planning Example
Evaluation of Potential Effects: Bagram Airfield
Situation:
In 2017, United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) was expanding its footprint to include 
additional forward operating bases (FOB). As part of this expansion, there was a need to move 
persistent threat detection systems (PTDS) to an austere landing zone. The air mobility liaison 
officer (AMLO) was able to get involved in the operational planning team (OPT) early and 
liaised with USFOR-A J-4 staff, joint engineers, contracting, load planners, mobility team, air 
mobility division (AMD), United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) Deployment 
Distribution Operations Center (CDDOC), theatre direct delivery (TDD), and the 816th 
Expeditionary Airlift Squadron (EAS).
Action:
In the planning phase, the AMLO worked to minimize airlift sorties required and use ground 
transportation to the highest extent possible. There were certain sensitive items unable to travel 
by ground that were requested to move by C-17s. The AMLO discovered certain loads could fit 
on C-130s which reduced the sortie count for C-17s and reduced overall mission time. The 
AMLO also assessed the LZ capability and passed that information to the 816 EAS tactics, 
AMD, and AMC/A3.
During execution, the AMLO tracked mission allocation from CDDOC, mission schedule from 
GDSS, and then met aircrews on the ramp during upload to complete the communication loop 
between all parties. 
Reported Outcome:
AMLOs worked an issue in the planning phase, spanning the operational level down to the 
tactical level. Early and widespread involvement led to success in the commanding general’s 
number one movement priority.

CHAPTER 6
CH6 TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
6.1 Introduction. This chapter provides tactical planning considerations to match supported unit
needs with mobility air forces (MAF) capabilities. For details on LZ/DZ planning and execution,
see Chapter 9, Landing Zone Operations and Chapter 10, Drop Zone Operations. See Table 6.1,
AMLOs Adapt to Tactical Situation.
Table 6.1 AMLOs Adapt to Tactical Situation
6.2 Tactical Transportation. There are four primary tactical sources of transportation: ground
convoy, rotary-wing lift, airdrop, and fixed-wing airland. The tactical situation, geographic
considerations, and the mode’s capacity are the leading factors driving the transportation source
selection.
6.2.1 Ground Convoy. Ground convoy is the land component’s preferred mode of tactical
transportation.
6.2.1.1 Advantages of ground convoy: 
1. Land component can directly task to meet their needs. 
2. Ability to directly deliver personnel and supplies to the final destination. 
3. Aggregate lift capacity typically greater than the available airlift capability (e.g., 
one load handling system [LHS] truck and trailer can move a C-130H equivalent of 
bulk cargo and a heavy expandable mobility tactical truck [HEMTT] and a C-17 both 
move only one M1 series tank at a time). 
Situation:
In 2016-2017, Combined Joint Task Force-Operation INHERENT RESOLVE (CJTF-OIR) 
featured a small US force supporting a very large local partner force. The complex web of 
dynamic geopolitical constraints impacted airlift, and AMLOs were key to success. By 
understanding the user’s requirements and the limitations of both ground transportation and 
airlift, AMLOs continually communicated limiting factors that impacted airlift at both the 
operational and tactical level. Logistical support, primarily through airlift, was instrumental to 
sustaining operations simultaneously in Iraq and Syria. 
Action:
In one instance, Class V storage capabilities at multiple locations in the area of responsibility 
(AOR) restricted movement of ammunition. The ammunition storage problem varied across the 
theater with some restrictions being political as some countries would not allow Class V, and 
some being physical at locations where the ammunition supply point (ASP) could not meet net 
explosive weight (NEW) safety restrictions. AMLOs had to learn the basics of the ammunition 
storage problem set, apply those restrictions to airlift, and find ways to mitigate the problem.
Reported Outcome:
The solution ranged from assessing airfields in more politically viable countries, and working 
with the 1st Theater Sustainment Command (TSC) to determine suitability for ammunition 
storage, to working with aligned units to prioritize ammunition for airlift.
6-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
4. Bad weather does not affect ground movement as drastically as it can affect air 
movement.
6.2.1.2 Disadvantages of ground convoy: 
1. Tactical threat along the ground line of communication (GLOC) (e.g., road 
networks/terrain dictate the GLOC go through urban or channelized areas that are 
vulnerable to attack).
2. Increased use of improvised explosive devices (IED).
3. GLOC can be severed by man-made obstacles like mine fields, or natural obstacles 
like rivers or mountain ranges.
4. Distance—long GLOCs are not only hard to secure but take a great deal of time to 
transit.
5. Routes severed by destroying a bridge or collapsing a mountain pass or tunnel. It is 
important to help the ground unit devise air contingency plans to deliver needed 
supplies in case the GLOC is severed.
6.2.1.3 GLOCs provide the aligned unit a less expensive and easy to source organic
solution to move requirements. AMLOs should understand the capabilities and limiting
factors associated with the GLOC and how those factors drive airlift requirements.
6.2.2 Rotary-Wing. Rotary-wing is typically the land component’s second choice for tactical
mobility. Often the land component owns or has rotary-wing assets available in direct support.
The rotary option is easier to request than fixed-wing assets, and provides a means of direct
delivery in most situations. Rotary-wing, like fixed-wing also mitigates many of the threats
faced by ground transportation.
6.2.2.1 Rotary-wing limitations: 
1. Less lift and all-weather capability, speed, and range than fixed-wing air.
2. More susceptible to small arms and man-portable air defense system (MANPADS) 
than fixed-wing; but due to its ability to fly much lower than fixed-wing, it can use 
terrain masking/map of the earth to defeat many radar threats.
3. When flying at very low threat avoidance altitudes sling loading is not possible and 
lift capability reduced.
6.2.3 Airdrop. The purpose of airdrop is to deploy personnel or equipment in support of
combat operations while minimizing exposure time in a hostile environment. Airdrop can
deliver supplies, equipment, and personnel directly to the user’s location and may present an
all-weather option when airland is not feasible.
6.2.3.1 Efficiency. When the threat permits, airland operations are more efficient and
normally preferable to airdrop operations. Airdrop operations require complex planning
and cargo preparation, reduces the total amount of cargo delivered, and increases the risk
of cargo being damaged. Proper employment depends on accurate DZ and point of impact
(PI) location (high precision coordinates), weather, and intelligence data to include
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
6-3
imagery, threat system capabilities, command, control, and communications (C3), and
target predictions.
6.2.3.2 Planning Considerations. Refer to AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone
Operations for DZ size, selection, marking, and delivery parameters. See Chapter 10 for
more detailed information about airdrop planning and execution. Aligned user
considerations:
• Approved DZ survey.
• Once airdrop is approved, user DIRLAUTH with planners is initiated.
• Communications.
• Recovery of cargo.
• Threat assessment and mitigation.
6.2.4 Airland. Airland is the preferred method of air transportation and provides more
capacity in both quantity and capability of loads. See Chapter 9 for more detailed information
about airland planning and execution. Refer to AFI 13-217 and Engineering Technical Letter
(ETL) 09-6,C-130 and C-17 Contingency and Training Airfield Dimensional Criteria.
6.2.4.1 Airland Advantages.
• Ensure unit integrity (troops and equipment remain together).
• Maximize cargo capacity (cubic and tonnage).
• Enable a back-haul capability including AE.
• Increase load survivability.
• Less potential for injury to personnel.
• Does not require additional aerial delivery resources (e.g., chutes).
• Employment preparation time line may be reduced as airdrop rigging is not required.
6.2.4.2 Airland Disadvantages.
• Suitable landing surface must be available and surveyed.
• Requires a secure LZ able to handle air flow.
• Crash, fire, and rescue (CFR) assets may be required.
• Require more time to achieve initial mass at the objective area. Often increases
closure of objective area and exposure of airlift assets.
• May require materials handling equipment (MHE).
• High operations tempo and recurring operations require air traffic control (ATC) for
traffic deconfliction and airspace coordination.
• Exposes aircraft to ground threats.
6.2.4.3 Airland Aligned User Considerations. For additional considerations, refer to
AFTTP 3-3.C-130J, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals—C-130J, paragraph 6.2.2, Airfield
Analysis and AFTTP 3-3.C-17, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals—C-17, paragraph 3.3,
Ground Operations Planning Factors.
• Airfield opening requirements.
6-4
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
• Air Transportation Test Loading Activity (ATTLA) certification.
• Hazardous cargo diplomatic clearance.
6.3 Airspace Planning. It is important to understand the existing airspace structure to include
routes and restricted operating zones (ROZ) and deconflict impact to airlift operations. It is
important to parallel plan with theater fires cells, G-3/S-3 Air, joint air-ground integration center
(JAGIC), and theater airspace cells to ensure airlift routing and DZ/LZ ROZs are safe and do not
hamper combat operations. Although the combined air operations center (CAOC) and airlift
tactics cells do most of this planning, they are not with the user and need AMLO network
information to ensure the airlift mission and ground combat mission are synchronized and
coordinated. In near peer, force on force situations, the situation can be dynamic and complex
requiring deconfliction and coordination to be delegated down to lower levels. The AMLO is the
best available expert to deconflict airlift airspace needs making it critical for the AMLO to meet
and integrate with the local airspace manager.
6.4 User Coordination. The AMLO is a critical link between the supported ground force and
supporting air forces. User coordination is not confined to tactical execution checklists but should
also include obtaining a shared understanding of the operational factors.
6.4.1 5-Ws. In addition to LZ/DZ coordination and airflow for tactical execution, AMLOs
should consider the use of the 5-W (who, what, when, where, why) framework. While
mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available-time available and civil
considerations (METT-TC) can frame the operational environment, the use of 5-Ws with the
how can promote a recap of the mission and tactical user coordination. Sister Services
typically use this format to frame the operational considerations.
6.4.2 Fires. User coordination should also include an understanding of operational fires and
airspace planning. User coordination challenges include deciphering an organization versus a
capability. AMLO fires coordination should be conducted with joint terminal attack controller
(JTAC) qualified personnel for the area where kinetic and non-kinetic effects occur and
airspace coordination is required. On-call airdrop is the most notable example where the
AMLO should be familiar with how the ground force commander’s effects will be impacted
by fires deconfliction. See Figure 6.1, Ground Party Capabilities.

CHAPTER 7
CH7 MISSION PLANNING
MISSION PLANNING
7.1 Introduction. This chapter provides planning guidance and considerations from initial
mission tasking to after-action reporting.
7.2 Application. Mission preparation requires an intelligent application of sound planning
concepts obtained from doctrine, lessons learned, operational evaluations, joint training exercises,
and threat analysis. AMLOs should integrate with mission MPCs, OPTs, aligned unit staffs, and
JTF headquarters when planning a mission. Involve all required functional leads from the outset,
including supported unit, contingency response forces, supported combatant command planners,
and the AFFOR staff. Sharing critical information will help clarify specified and implied tasks,
assess mission risks, and COA development. The AMLO should articulate their roles and
responsibilities to all commanders and staffs.
7.3 Mission Variables. After receipt of a tasking, AMLOs should narrow focus to six mission
analysis variables of METT-TC. Mission variables are those aspects of the operational
environment that directly affect a mission and may be used for mission analysis. By using
METT-TC, AMLOs can combine operational information with tactical expertise to generate a
comprehensive analysis of the prescribed mission.
7.3.1 Mission. A tasking will be assigned by higher headquarters in any of the mission-type
order format. Understand the 5-Ws.
7.3.2 Enemy. Relevant information regarding the enemy may include composition, size, type,
enemy tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and previous order of battle. Consider the
worst-case and most-likely threats. Coordinate with applicable threat working groups (TWG)
who should assess current threats using intelligence preparation of the operational
environment (IPOE) methodology. Identify those risk factors that may affect operations and
design risk mitigation strategies to limit the negative impact on planned operations. Integration
with attached staff can enhance situational awareness in the operational environment through
update briefs and other G-2 or command and control messages.
7.3.3 Troops and Support Available. Know enemy and friendly unit strengths and
weakness. Check the status of equipment. Request available theater assets to support the unit,
Mission Readiness
In September 2017, 18th Air Force (AF) [now Air Mobility Command (AMC)/A3] gave vocal 
orders (VOCO) to the 621st Contingency Response Wing (CRW) via AMC/A3CM, directing the 
tasking of four AMLOs in support of Hurricane Maria. The task required all four AMLOs to 
depart four separate locations in continental United States (CONUS) within 12 hours in support 
of the 601st Air Mobility Division (AMD) and 618 AOC. The AMLOs departed commercial 
airports without clear guidance on specified and implied tasks due to the uncertainty of 
post-hurricane logistical network. The AMLOs departed with the capability to perform landing 
zone (LZ) and drop zone (DZ) operations, should the need arise, even though formal tasking did 
not occur until days later (via fragmentary order [FRAGORD]). This scenario highlights the 
need for AMLOs to plan for the worst case scenario and be able to fulfill all three-primary 
mission essential tasks at a moment’s notice.
7-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
to include HN or coalition (if available). Understand mobility friction points for resupply and
sustainment for the AOR and determine appropriate and reasonable COAs to mitigate threats
and risks.
7.3.4 Terrain and Weather. Terrain and weather are natural conditions that profoundly
influence operations; home field advantage is a huge benefit. These factors can pose a
particular risk to aviation and air mobility assets. The airspace in the AOR must also be
carefully understood in how it relates to the terrain as well as potential weather scenarios so
that mitigating COAs can be developed.
7.3.5 Time Available. Typically, time available for detailed analysis and assessment is
shorter at the tactical level during contingency scenarios. Have key equipment checked and
ready for immediate action, and understand local procedures and transportation to preclude
any delays.
7.3.6 Civil Considerations. Civil considerations are the influence of man-made
infrastructure, civilian institutions, politics, and attitudes and activities of the civilian leaders,
populations, and organizations within an area of operations on the conduct of military
operations.
7.4 Mission. An AMLO are tasked from multiple sources via multiple methods. Thorough
understanding of who is initiating the mission, priority, and the expected requirements, tasks, and
end state are paramount to the success of the operation. Prioritization is critical to effective
employment of the AMLO.
7.4.1 Mission Orders. Planners should clearly understand the command authority as
identified in the planning directives such as a WARNORD or standing execute order
(EXORD). See Table 7.1, Mission Orders.
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
7-3
Table 7.1 Mission Orders
7.4.2 Mission Tasking. Mission taskings are typically formalized with FRAGORDs to the
standing OPORD. However, due to the expeditionary nature of the AMLO, expect VOCO
taskings when time is limited. For a specific contingency, a deployment order or operation
order provides specific guidance, typically including a description of the situation,
commander’s intent, purpose of military operations, objectives, anticipated mission or tasks,
pertinent constraints and restraints, and forces available to the commander for planning and
strategic lift allocations.
7.4.3 Mission Analysis.
7.4.3.1 Desired End State. Planners can compare the current conditions of the operational
environment with the desired end state to help visualize an approach to solving the
problem. Start by identifying necessary end state conditions and termination criteria early
in planning to help the mission planning cell devise an operational approach with lines of
effort. See Chapter 5, Operational Planning.
7.4.3.2 Desired Effects. AMLOs should focus on how air mobility will help achieve the
desired effects in support of objectives. Ensure commanders understand indirect effects, or
unplanned results, because they can often be unintended and undesired. Examples include:
use of airdrop versus airland; balancing effectiveness versus efficiency of the airlift
system; TPFDD plan versus actual MOG capabilities.

7.4.3.3 Tasks. Confirm with HHQ staff the essential, specified, and implied tasks early in
the mission analysis process to eliminate extraneous planning when developing initial
mission planning products.
• Essential tasks are executed by the AMLO and/or mobility forces to achieve the
desired end state.
• Specified tasks are assigned to a subordinate via WARNORD, OPORD, or other
planning directive. These are tasks the AMLO should accomplish during execution of
the operation. One or more specified tasks often become essential tasks as the mission
progresses.
• Implied tasks are additional tasks that the AMLO should complete to accomplish the
specified and essential tasks. Thorough knowledge of the mission will make it easier
for the AMLO to identify implied tasks.
7.4.3.4 Capabilities. The AMLO baseline capability set can be summarized by their
mission essential task:
• Integrate with Command and Control—Facilitate timely flow of critical information
between the air mobility C2 network and the AMLO’s aligned unit under austere and
hostile environments anywhere on the globe at any time.
• Optimize Aligned Unit Use of the Air Mobility System—Enhance the aligned unit’s
operation from planning through execution by advising and educating the unit on how
to optimize air mobility to achieve unit objectives.
• Conduct Landing and Drop Operations—Train drop zone controllers, accomplish
drop zone surveys, control airdrops, provide landing zone safety officer (LZSO)
services, train LZSOs, and perform airfield operations assessments under austere and
hostile environments anywhere on the globe at any time.
7.4.3.5 Operational Limitations. Consider the following AMLO limitations:
• Single Individual or Small Team Concept—Due to the small number of AMLOs
worldwide, a single AMLO will usually have a large area of responsibility. This can
lead to support challenges depending on the operational situation. A broad mission-set
across the high-demand air mobility domain, coupled with the limited availability of
AMLOs, may require a triage prioritization of mission demands and requirements in
order to maximize effects.
• Limited Force Protection—While an AMLO is trained to provide personal defense
for themselves, they are unable to provide airfield/drop zone security by themselves.
Organic force protection must be provided to secure an airfield/drop zone.
• Sustained Operations—AMLOs are not typically equipped to be self-sufficient for
long periods of time and will require aligned unit support. External resupply of
equipment/supplies will become necessary if sustained operations are expected.
7.5 Enemy. Unit intelligence should use IPOE methodology to analyze the threat throughout
mission analysis.
7.5.1 Intelligence. Integrate with host unit intelligence sections to stay abreast of the threat
environment in the AOR. Important factors to consider for any operation include the enemy’s
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
7-5
most dangerous (EMDCOA) and most likely course of action (EMLCOA). The AMC/TWG is
a foundational resource for operations involving missions commanded and controlled by the
618 AOC. AMC assets assigned to or controlled through the theater air operations center, also
referred to as “chopped”, operate under separate theater guidance. As the eyes and ears of the
AMC/A3, AMLOs provide pertinent and unfiltered information to AMC, the DIRMOBFOR,
AMD tactics division, and anywhere the information can be leveraged.
7.5.2 Risk. Risk should be thoroughly analyzed and approved at the appropriate level. The
fundamental goal of risk management is to enhance mission effectiveness at all levels while
preserving assets and safeguarding the health and welfare of all personnel. Beyond reducing
loss, risk management also provides a logical process to identify/exploit opportunities that
provide the greatest return on investment of time, dollars, and personnel.
7.5.2.1 Acceptable Level of Risk (ALR). ALR includes ground ALR for AMLO
employment as well as ALR for supporting mobility forces. The decision to accept risk
will be determined by a combination of higher headquarters, the supporting/supported
unit, and the user directly assuming the risk. When determining the ALR, all pertinent
factors should be considered to include: currency, proficiency, experience, physical
conditioning, available equipment, operation complexity, weather, terrain, and hostile
force strength.
7.5.2.2 ALR for Mobility Operations. Contact AMC/A3D for questions regarding risk
acceptance guidance for missions under 618 AOC control to include AMLO employment
in contingency operations. The theater DIRMOBFOR will assist with setting ALR for
theater mobility forces chopped to the AOR to be included in the theater special
instructions (SPINS). The AMC enduring SPINS include detailed descriptions of threat
levels and mitigating factors required to manage risk to MAF. Ground ALR for AMLO
and contingency response forces will require AMC inputs as well. AMLOs should
articulate mobility ALR to supported ground force commanders. If ALR for mobility
forces does not enable support to the ground force commander’s scheme of maneuver, the
AMLO should inject immediately to set expectations.
7.5.2.3 Risk Management (RM). RM is a decision-making process to systematically
evaluate possible COA, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best COA for any
given situation. RM enables commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and
individuals to maximize capabilities while limiting risks through application of a simple,
systematic process appropriate for all personnel and functions in both on- and off-duty
situations. Appropriate use of RM increases an organization’s and individual’s ability to
safely and effectively accomplish their mission/activity while preserving lives and
precious resources. AMLOs should use appropriate RM prior to engaging in activities or
operations tasked by HHQs or unit. Refer to AFI 90-802, Risk Management.
7.6 Troops and Support. Perhaps the most important aspect of mission analysis is determining
the combat potential of the force. Leaders know the status of unit morale, experience and training,
and the strengths and weaknesses of subordinate leaders. A self-assessment includes knowing the
strength and status of their equipment.
7.6.1 Unit Type Code (UTC). Current AMLO UTCs enable the individual to tailor their
equipment required directly to the mission tasked. This allows the AMLO to limit the potential
7-6
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
for extraneous equipment that would otherwise make inter/intratheater travel difficult. The
separate UTC system is provides flexibility to AMLOs operating alone or in a very small
group. UTCs include:
• 7E1AL—Consists of an AMLO and equipment to communicate in austere and field
environments.
• 7E1TC—Consists of equipment to extend the ground-air communications capabilities.
• 7E1DL—Consists of equipment required to operate a landing zone and drop zone.
• 7E1LC—Consists of equipment for over the horizon voice/data communication.
7.6.2 Force Protection. Security may be provided by local police forces, security forces,
sister-Service/coalition forces, HN forces, or CRF personnel. Reference the AMC airfield
threat matrix to determine if the mission requires help from augmenting units.
7.7 Time. AMLOs should be prepared for global contingencies at any time. For this reason,
AMLOs should maintain the highest level of currency/ proficiency per OPCON authority standing
guidance. From an operational planning perspective, the planning timeline will invariably
influence air mobility options for the supported unit. Understand theater air planning processes as
well as intertheater options (618 AOC) and timelines as it pertains to the joint operation.
7.8 Terrain and Weather. Each operating location presents its own unique challenges and
requires detailed planning. Keep in mind operations can be executed from semi-prepared runway
operations to a large international commercial air hub.
7.8.1 Existing Airfield Survey or Landing Zone (LZ). A review of the airfield suitability
and restrictions report (ASRR) or the landing zone survey is essential. The ASRR and Giant
Reports are available on the GDSS2. The ASRR contains basic information on runway size,
weight bearing capacity (WBC), and restrictions. In some instances, the ASRR information
may not be available or the information may be outdated. In this case, the information must be
obtained from 618 AOC or another valid source. If valid WBC data is not available, load
classification number (LCN), pavement classification number (PCN) or California bearing
ratio (CBR) may be used to calculate suitability and maximum gross weight allowable.
Airfield managers may waive WBC. Remember, the same considerations need to be applied to
all taxiways and parking ramps that the aircraft intends to use during ground operations.
Existing landing zone surveys can be found on the zone availability report (ZAR) at
https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10358/default.aspx. AMC is transitioning to TalonPoint, a
web-based portal that will provide a way to not only store all types of surveys but also
complete and sign surveys. AMLOs should have access to this database.
NOTE: AFI 13-217 governs landing and drop zone operations.
NOTE: One suitability item often overlooked is the availability of aircraft rescue equipment and
personnel. For ARFF requirements, refer to Air Mobility Command Instruction (AMCI) 11-208,
Mobility Air Forces Management and Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 32-2004, Aircraft Fire
Protection for Exercises and Contingency Response Operations.
7.8.2 Existing Drop Zone Survey (DZ). Existing drop zone surveys can be found on the
ZAR, TalonPoint portal, or regional tactics office databases (e.g., United States Air Forces in
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
7-7
Europe [USAFE] ZAR). Theater drop zones may only exist with entities such as AMD
Tactics.
7.8.3 No Survey. If no survey exists, a survey should be completed by a combat controller, air
mobility liaison officer, or other trained personnel on an AF Form 3823, V2, Drop Zone
Survey. Completed surveys can be forwarded to HQ AMC/A3DT (DSN 779-3148/1765) for
inclusion in the ZAR or other database.
7.8.4 Charts, Maps, and Imagery. Chart selection should provide the best possible detail
and accuracy to meet requirements. It is highly recommended to print charts during mission
planning for quick reference en route and during initial setup when data connectivity
bandwidth may be limited.
7.8.5 Weather Analysis. A detailed weather analysis is critical to mission planning. All
available resources should be used to best determine the weather conditions expected during
mission execution. Set an appropriate battle rhythm to manage heat/cold-related fatigue and
stress. When using non-DOD sources, keep operations security (OPSEC) in mind. Other
meteorological information may be obtained from HN capability study. If the MPC does not
have dedicated weather support, the list below shows weather agency-provided services and
products available for mission analysis.
7.8.5.1 Observations and Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF). A TAF request includes
the ICAO identifier, pilot reports, surface observations and TAFs are reported in
alphanumeric format. The website www.aviationweather.gov is the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site for domestic aviation weather.
7.8.5.2 Weather Agencies. If a weather forecaster is not available at the operating
location, the Air Force weather agencies’ geographic area of responsibility can be found in
Section C of the Flight Information Handbook can provide operational weather squadron
(OWS) products and services. Additionally, the Air Force Weather Agency provides an
interactive grid analysis and display system.
7.8.5.3 Space Weather. Space weather is observed and forecast solar activity impacting
high frequency (HF) and ultrahigh frequency (UHF) communications and applications.
7.9 Civil Considerations and HN Relations. Based on information from higher headquarters
and known planning factors, the MPC should identify civil considerations that affect their mission.
Most of the time, deployed AMLOs are surrounded by noncombatants. These noncombatants may
include United States Government (USG) officials, residents of the AO, local officials,
international governmental organizations (IGO), and nongovernmental organizations (NGO).
Dependent upon the mission, AMLOs may be working hand-in-hand with HN counterparts. Even
if AMLOs are not working directly with HN representatives, a poor HN perception of US military
abroad could create unnecessary obstacles toward mission accomplishment. Depending upon the
tasked mission and operating environment (e.g., permissive, uncertain, hostile), HN
considerations require continuous attention from the MPC during mission analysis.
7.10 After-Action Reports/Review (AAR). A review of previous after action reports should be
included in mission analysis to complete a thorough performance review of past events. After
mission execution, an after action review is an excellent tool for enabling Airmen to discover what
happened, why it happened, how to sustain strengths, and how to improve on weaknesses.
7-8
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
AMLOs are required by AFI 13-106, Air Mobility Liaison Officers (AMLO) to provide after action
reports to OPCON authority and AMC. Supported unit AARs should be reviewed and analyzed
for strengths and weaknesses as well, in order to find opportunities for the AMLO mission to be
advanced. The Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) database is the DOD system of
record for lessons learned and is a robust resource for after action reports. As a technique, mission
analysis is a good time to begin gathering after-action reporting inputs to capture lessons learned.
7.11 RFIs to Tasking Authority. Submitting an RFI is the normal procedure for filling
information gaps not available through the use of organic intelligence and planning assets. If
available, AMLO mission planners should identify an RFI recorder to consolidate all RFIs
required for thorough mission analysis. The RFI process can greatly enhance situational
awareness of the AO by tapping into all staffs through the AMLO’s expressed DIRLAUTH on
behalf of the OPCON authority. Units may have an RFI collection database, depending on their
capability. RFIs should be submitted in a timely manner to enable thorough mission analysis.
7.12 Mission Analysis Brief. The purpose of this brief is to provide the commander, director of
operations, or OL chief, depending on delegation of authority, with the results of the MPC analysis
of the mission, offer a forum to present identified issues, and provide an opportunity for the
approving authority to synthesize mission analysis with the initial visualization of the mission.
The commander (or as appropriate) approves or disapproves the MPC’s recommended COA and
provides additional guidance if required. The mission analysis briefing may be the only time
leadership is available and the only opportunity to ensure that all members have a common
reference point for the mission. Refer to JP 5-0.
7.13 Rehearsal of Concept (ROC) Drill. A successful transition from planning to execution
requires those charged with executing the order to fully understand the plan. An excellent method
for accomplishing this is to conduct a ROC drill. A rehearsal is a session in which the planning
staff or unit practices expected actions to improve performance during execution. Rehearsals
allow leaders to practice synchronizing operations at times and places critical to mission
accomplishment. During a rehearsal, all participants rehearse their roles in the operation to ensure
they understand how their actions support the overall operation and note any additional
coordination required. After a rehearsal, all participants should have a clear understanding of the
mission and know their responsibilities and priorities during execution. Refer to ADP 5-0.
7.13.1 Conducting Rehearsals. The extent of rehearsals depends on available time. In cases
of short-notice requirements, rehearsals may not be possible during mission analysis. If this is
the case, leadership should strive to conduct a ROC drill at the deployed location prior to the
beginning of operations. Rehearsals can be robust and include all members of a unit and/or
supported unit (time permitting), or they can be table-topped with leadership and functional
group representatives. After the ROC drill, the commander or designated representative
should lead a hot wash. The intent of the meeting is to review lessons learned and make any
required modifications to the existing plan. Refer to ADP 5-0.

CHAPTER 8
CH8 FORCIBLE ENTRY OPERATIONS
FORCIBLE ENTRY OPERATIONS
8.1 Introduction. Forcible entry operations (FEO) are designed to create a logistical foothold in
denied or hostile environments and will continue to increase in importance as the military pursues
a more agile combat force structure. FEO options may take place in the air, land, or sea domains.
AMLOs play a critical role in airborne operations but should be familiar with their aligned units’
FEO responsibilities in all domains and be prepared to assist in planning and execution of forcible
entry operations. The inherently joint nature of FEOs drives a robust requirement for air mobility
assets and capabilities.
8.2 Defined. Joint forcible entry operations seize and hold lodgments against armed opposition.
A lodgment is a designated area in a hostile or potentially hostile operational area (e.g., an airhead,
a beachhead, or combination thereof) that affords continuous landing of troops and materiel while
providing maneuver space for subsequent operations. The lodgment and the means to seize a
lodgment will depend upon the objectives of the operation or campaign. In most operations,
forcible entry secures the lodgment as a base for subsequent operations. It often has facilities and
infrastructure that may be used to receive large follow-on forces and logistics. In some operations,
seizure of the lodgment may be the primary objective, and its retention lasts only until the mission
is complete, at which time the assaulting forces withdraw. Forcible entry operations are inherently
risky and always joint. Forcible entry demands careful planning and thorough preparation;
synchronized, violent, and rapid execution; and leader initiative at every level to deal with friction,
chance, and opportunity. Refer to JP 3-18, Joint Forcible Entry Operations.
8.3 Units. AMLOs are aligned with airborne, special operations, and Marine Corps units with
FEO missions. While virtually all aligned Marine Corps and Army maneuver units have air assault
capabilities, airborne units are the most likely to engage in FEOs. Airborne FEOs may be
accomplished via direct delivery from home station or launched from an intermediate staging base
(ISB) and are always conditions-based.
8.4 Planning. During FEO planning, AMLOs are considered air mobility experts and should be
familiar with mode-specific contingency air operations and their aligned unit’s mission
requirements to include priority of support and schemes of sustainment. AMLOs should be
familiar with any applicable OPLANs, CONPLANs, orders, and mission-related materials. If
there are any knowledge gaps or deficiencies AMLOs should work to mitigate them through
coordination with subject matter experts (SME), self-study, and augmentation. The most
important aspect of FEO planning is to provide timely, accurate, and useful information to joint
partners.
8.4.1 Air Mobility Representation. AMLOs are often the only air mobility representatives
in joint forcible entry (JFE) planning events. Due to the nature of joint planning it is incumbent
on the AMLO to identify and integrate with other air planners such as air liaison officers
(ALO), tactical air control party (TACP), combat air force (CAF) planners, special operations
forces (SOF) air planners, intel, sister-Service air planners, contingency response (CR)
personnel, and mobility weapons officers (WO). Integrating mobility expertise with other
air-centric specialties allows presentation of a cohesive, holistic air picture and directly drives
deconfliction capability during execution. AMLOs should be involved in planning at the
8-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
strategic, operational, and tactical levels to ensure proper support of air mobility assets to the
FEO.
8.4.2 Planning Considerations. While impossible to anticipate all possible planning
challenges, AMLOs are authorized and encouraged to reach out to relevant SMEs to provide
information and guidance in execution of their duties.
8.4.2.1 Threat to the Force. During airborne JFE planning, AMLOs should consider the
threat to aircraft. Information pertaining to air threats can be found in JP 3-01, Countering
Air and Missile Threats and the airframe specific AFTTP 3-1 series manuals. AMLOs
should be familiar with the concept of ALR. In order to provide accurate planning
assumptions for FEO, AMLOs should consider all available threat data and provide
feasibility assessments in terms of ALR. If possible AMLOs should coordinate with the
JFACC or USTRANSCOM to determine the theater ALR for mobility aircraft. The
primary Air Force SMEs for ALR are MWS weapons officers.
• 29th Weapons Squadron, C-130, Little Rock AFB, AR.
• 57th Weapons Squadron, C-17, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA.
• 509th Weapons Squadron, KC-135, Fairchild AFB, WA.
8.4.2.2 Aircraft Requirements. AFPAM 10-1403, Air Mobility Planning Factors provides
adequate information on mobility aircraft capabilities to estimate total number of aircraft
required for a FEO. AMLOs should develop an in-depth understanding of their aligned
users’ airdrop and/or strategic lift requirements via strategic and operational level plan
study. Engaging with the DTO in the Army or G-4/SMO for a MEF is crucial to ensuring
proper aircraft allocation. Outsized vehicles and equipment (e.g., artillery pieces) are
common JFE items that may require C-17 support to airdrop.
8.4.2.3 Fixed Installation Satellite Antenna (FISA). FISA is a hardware modification to an
aircraft that enables airborne use of Army en route mission command. FISA capabilities
allow ground force commanders to maintain real-time communications and battlefield
awareness while airborne. FISA is an aircraft modification that is currently unique to the
C-17. FISA requirements should be identified to AMC/A3 and the supporting AOC as
early as possible to ensure that FISA modified tails are assigned to the mission. FISA
hardware is fixed and can’t be transferred between aircraft.
8.4.2.4 Infrastructure Requirements. ISB operations add an additional layer of complexity
to FEOs. ISB locations may be dictated by air or ground force requirements. In the event
ISB operations are planned, AMLOs need to ensure all critical requirements for mission
accomplishment can be met. If possible AMLOs should be included in all predeployment
site surveys (PDSS), logistics meetings, and OPT meetings involving the ISB. AMLOs
should inspect ISB locations physically to confirm the accuracy of reference and planning
materials. See Table 8.1, Common ISB Requirements.
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
8-3
Table 8.1 Common ISB Requirements
8.5 Execution. FEOs are dynamic, chaotic, and high-stress events. The needs of the aligned user
should be the priority when determining physical placement of the AMLO during the execution
phase. AMLOs may be integrated at any and all levels of support during execution (i.e., insertion
with an airborne command post [ACP] or being embedded at the theater air AOC as a
communications node to the ground force). AMLOs should be provided discretion to reposition as
necessary when a change in conditions dictate.
8.5.1 Airborne Insertions. AMLOs assigned to designated airborne units may carry a “J”
code and be qualified to conduct airborne operations. These AMLOs may be expected to
perform airborne operations with their aligned units. In the event of an airborne FEO, the
AMLO would normally jump with the command element of the airborne force independent of
force echelon.
8.5.2 Communications. AMLOs embedded at strategic or operational command locations
during execution of FEOs should focus on facilitating communication between Air Force and
joint units. When possible, AMLOs should ensure access to critical communication systems
utilized by their aligned unit. Access to systems from field locations such as TRANSVERSE,
command post of the future (CPOF), and messenger Internet Relay Chat (MiRC), employed
by an AOC, have proven invaluable in the past. In addition accurate, current contact
information for key personnel in the aligned unit are indispensable in ensuring rapid
coordination between air and ground command elements.
8.6 Expanding the Lodgment. This phase of FEO is the most fluid for the AMLO. Expanding
the lodgment normally encompasses a simultaneous building of logistics capabilities at the
lodgment and expanding a security zone around the lodgment in accordance with mission
requirements. AMLO requirements will vary depending on location, threat, user force makeup,
and mission objectives.
8.6.1 Lodgment Operations. AMLOs embedded at the tactical level should be prepared to
conduct follow-on tactical operations. Surveying austere DZ, controlling DZs, augmenting LZ
operations, and instructing ground users on DZ operations fall within the scope of mission
essential tasks. The other primary task of AMLOs located at the lodgment is assisting in
preparation for reception of follow-on forces. Coordination with CR forces, AFFOR staff,

theater AOC, and aligned users’ joint operations center (JOC) are critical to ensuring an
expedient, organized flow of personnel and supplies into the lodgment.
8.6.2 Other Operational Locations. AMLOs not embedded at the lodgment should
determine the best location to assist their aligned user following the FEO. There are
advantages and disadvantages to posturing at an ISB, AOC, JOC, or other locations. Priority
should be given to the request of the aligned user but it is incumbent on the AMLO to provide
a recommendation based on their own experience and knowledge. Access to communication
systems and command elements is paramount and should not be sacrificed for the sake of
convenience. AMLOs should be in the best location to gather information, inform, and
coordinate at all times.
8.7 Transition. The final phase of FEOs is the transition or termination phase. AMLOs should be
focused on assisting in the transition of airfield control to CR or follow-on forces during this
phase. Refer to AFTTP 3-2.68, Multi-service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Airfield
Opening and AFTTP 3-4.4, Contingency Airfield Operations for guidance on opening and
transferring airfield control.

CHAPTER 9
CH9 LANDING ZONE OPERATIONS
LANDING ZONE OPERATIONS
9.1 Introduction. This chapter outlines how to: (1) plan and prepare for an LZ operation; (2)
assess and setup an LZ; and (3) provides considerations for operating an LZ.
9.2 Coordination. Pre-mission coordination and communication is essential to prevent mission
failure and minimize changes prior to opening the LZ. The AMLO coordinates with the user to
confirm the communication plan, training/operation to be conducted, number of aircraft,
equipment and passengers being on/offloaded, and potential contingencies during the operation.
AMLOs should obtain a copy of the LZ survey and begin coordination with the agency/SAA that
owns the LZ to determine procedures for gaining access, conducting an LZ assessment, opening
the LZ, conducting operations and closing the LZ. If operating an LZ for training purposes,
contact with range control may be needed to obtain a communication method which complies with
local requirements. In a combat environment, AMLOs should understand all theater air control
system (TACS) and Army air-ground system (AAGS) players to include ground and air-based
command and control nodes (e.g., control and reporting center [CRC], airborne warning and
control system [AWACS], ROZ owners).
9.2.1 Zone Availability Report (ZAR) or Talon Point. The ZAR is a comprehensive listing
of drop zones and landing zones available for use by the DOD. The information in the ZAR
does not replace the need for a completed survey prior to conducting LZ operations.
Completed DZ/LZ surveys will be forwarded to AMC/A3DT (DSN 779-3148/1765) for
inclusion in the ZAR. Completed surveys are available for military (.mil) users on the ZAR.
All USAFE and many SOF fields are on Talon Point or SIPRNET Talon Point. The links for
these can be found on the ZAR website at: https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10358/default.aspx.
NOTE: Major commands (MAJCOM) and contingency AOCs may maintain their own ZAR
database (if desired). This does not alleviate them from the responsibility to provide these surveys
to AMC/A3DT for inclusion in the worldwide ZAR database, unless classification requirements
dictate otherwise.
9.2.2 Airlift Mission Commander Responsibilities. The airlift mission commander selects
the air tactics and designs the flow of air movement to comply with the delivery requirements.
AMLOs should coordinate closely with the airlift mission commander (referred to as the
AMC), ground force commander, and the personnel responsible for controlling the LZ (e.g.,
combat control teams [CCT], AMLO, LZSO, CRF).
9.2.3 Mission Planning. Pre-mission planning is a critical component of operating a landing
zone (LZ). See Table 9.1, LZ Pre-Mission Checklist and Table 9.2, LZ Pre-Mission
Checklist-Coordination.

Table 9.3 LZSO Responsibilities
9.4 Equipment. The AMLO is a rapidly deployable, flexible, and agile asset. AMLOs deploy
with a light, lean equipment footprint in order to preserve mobility options (e.g., rotary
wing/ground transport to LZ). Certain items are required for LZ operations and others will prove
invaluable to ensuring safe and efficient operations. The following is a list of equipment most
often required for LZ operations and can be tailored to individual missions. See Table 9.4, LZ
Recommended Equipment List.
Table 9.4 LZ Recommended Equipment List
1. Landing zone safety officer (LZSO) serves as the officer in charge (OIC) and is responsible 
for certifying the airfield meets the safety standards for aircraft operations per the LZSO 
inspection checklist. Coordinates with the security element to ensure security is established and 
maintained.
2. LZSO should inspect the landing zone (LZ) when workload allows but should be done after 
4 passes. This inspection should be completed with semi-prepared airfield condition index 
(SPACI) criteria. In the event the strip is determined unsafe for landing, the LZSO notifies the 
ground user’s tactical operations center (TOC) and if able passes the information to the inbound 
aircraft.
3. All landing zones / airfield operations will have a minimum of one LZSO present at all times. 
Recommend two-man policy to ease workload and allow for increased vigilance during critical 
operations.
4. Prior to departing the forward operating base (FOB) staging area, ensure the security element 
is briefed on the mission, timeline, security measures, and airfield clearing procedures.
5. While not responsible for the airspace nor certified to grant landing and takeoff clearance, 
advisory calls, workload permitting, are highly encouraged.

9.5 Setting up the LZ. Expedient airfields are those surfaced with dirt, membrane, landing mat,
or any combination of these. The criteria in Technical Manual (TM) 3-34.48-2, Theater of
Operations: Roads, Airfields, and Heliports - Airfield and Heliport Design outlines construction
criteria of airfields for aircraft operating under normal conditions and procedures. Combat control
personnel are trained to perform tactical LZ surveys or assessments in support of airlift operations.
They determine LZ suitability by using general criteria in AFJPAM 32-8013, VII and the specific
tactical LZ criteria contained in MAJCOM supplements to this publication. Table 9.5, Minimum

of an LZ for cargo throughput. While takeoff and landing data is contingent on many factors, the
minimum LZ size for significant C-17 infiltration/exfiltration operations is closer to 4000-5000
feet of usable surface. See Table 9.5 for common aircraft. Refer to AFI 13-217.
Table 9.5 Minimum Runway Dimensions for Common Aircraft
9.5.1 LZ Areas. Potential LZ areas fall into two basic categories: prepared, and
semi-prepared (unpaved). Prepared areas may include existing airfields, roads, highways, or
other paved surfaces. Semi-prepared surfaces are natural areas such as deserts, dry lakebeds,
and flat valley floors. These surfaces offer the ability to construct short airstrips for a limited
use and may or may not have an aggregate surface.
9.5.1.1 Contingency response airfield assessment teams include personnel qualified to
conduct surveys of prepared and semi-prepared LZs.
9.5.1.2 Combat control personnel are trained and equipped with a full suite of surveying
equipment to satisfactorily assess obstructions, penetrations, and approach zone
clearances. They are trained and have equipment used to check weight-bearing capability
of LZs for both semi-prepared and prepared surfaces.
9.5.1.3 AMLOs do not have the training to survey a new airfield. AMLOs can and should
advise commanders on the feasibility and best location for an LZ in order to most
effectively use mobility assets.
9.5.2 LZ Marking Equipment. LZs are normally marked with marker panels (KVAMPs,
VS-17, VS-18) secured to upright supports for day operations and omni-directional visible

lighting systems with a minimum output rating of 15 candela, and strobe lights if required, for
night operations. Virtually any type overt or covert lighting or marking system is acceptable, if
all participating units are briefed, and concur with its use. Special tactics units may also use
specialized lighting systems.
9.6 Assessment. The purpose of the LZ assessment is to ensure the safety of the aircrews and to
verify the AF Form 3822, Version 1, Landing Zone Survey or tactical survey obtained from the
ZAR database or regional AOC. The physical assessment primarily addresses distress types and
severity throughout the LZ. The method for rating the condition of semi-prepared airfields has
four steps:
1. Divide the airfield into features and sections.
2. Inspect the airfield and identify the distresses.
3. Calculate the rating for each section.
4. Use the ratings to determine if the airfield is safe (see Table 9.6, SPACI Conditions).
9.6.1 Semi-Prepared Airfield Condition Index (SPACI). SPACI is a process to objectively
calculate the overall condition of the LZ using the distresses found on the LZ. By identifying
the severity of each distressed condition and inputting the values into the SPACI index, an
overall LZ condition can be determined. The calculation is scale that ranges from 0 to 100.
Refer to the AMLO Playbook or the ETL 97-9, Criteria and Guidance for C-17Contingency
and Training Operations on Semi-Prepared Airfields for specifics on how to conduct. See
Table 9.6.
Table 9.6 SPACI Conditions
9.6.2 Distress Types. It is imperative to evaluate multiple different airfield distress types
prior to and during airfield use. There are seven possible problems or distresses. In each
250-foot section, there may be no distresses or as many as seven distresses. If there is trouble
identifying the type of distress make a reasonable guess. The system is flexible enough to give
an accurate rating. While crews generally are concerned with maximum allowable gross load
(AGL) and rolling friction factor (RFF), the distress factors should be continually assessed to
determine overall airfield condition (RED, AMBER, or GREEN). Multiple passes and
180-degree turns on the runway will likely cause damage or rutting of the runway surface. The
seven distresses are:
• Potholes (major).
• Loose aggregate coverage and size.
• Ruts (major).
• Dust.
 Red
Dangerous and must be repaired; high-risk operations.
Amber
Needs monitoring and should be repaired if possible; medium-risk 
operations.
Green
Operational for low-risk operations.
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019

• Rolling resistant material (major).
• Jet blast erosion.
• Stabilized layer failure.
NOTE: Unless otherwise stated, the distress severity measurements for contingency and training
operations are the same.
NOTE: Potholes, ruts, and rolling resistant material are considered major distresses. Depending
upon actual distress location, any of these distress types categorized as RED may cause overall
airfield condition to be RED. Training sites must meet green criteria, contingency sites must meet
amber criteria.
9.6.2.1 Potholes. Potholes are bowl-shaped depressions in the airfield surface. Once
potholes have begun to form, the runway will continue to disintegrate because of loosening
surface material or weak spots in the underlying soils. If potholes have hard, abrupt,
vertical sides, refer to stabilized layer failure criteria. Measure the depth of the biggest
potholes and determine their severity level. In areas of high pothole density, observe
aircraft reaction. The location and number of potholes can be critical to aircraft
performance. See Figure 9.1, Potholes.
NOTE: An abrupt vertical change of more than 2 inches could cause the nose gear to collapse and
should be repaired before the airfield can be used.
Figure 9.1 Potholes
9.6.2.2 Loose Aggregate. Loose aggregate consists of small stones 1/4 inch or larger that
have separated from the soil binder. In large enough quantities and sizes, it becomes

dangerous. Rocks over 4 inches in diameter must be removed from the airfield before any
operations. If material crushes underfoot, it is not considered loose aggregate. Rocks 3/4
inch to 1 inch in size create engine FOD potential, as well as probable damage to
undercarriage antennae. Larger aggregate provides tire cutting potential as well as greater
potential for undercarriage FOD damage. Recommend surface coarse gradation with
maximum 1/2 inch aggregate size be used on LZs. AMC operations on gravel LZs have
been discontinued except in emergencies. Use Table 9.7, Aggregate Coverage Guide to
estimate the area of the section that is covered by loose aggregate and check the
appropriate box in the severity table. Use Table 9.8, Aggregate Size Guide to measure
average size aggregate with a measuring stick and check the appropriate box in the
severity table.
Table 9.7 Aggregate Coverage Guide
Table 9.8 Aggregate Size Guide
9.6.2.3 Ruts. Ruts are surface depressions in the wheel paths that run parallel to the
centerline. They result from repeated aircraft passes and become more severe with time.
Lay a straightedge across the ruts with both ends resting on the solid runway surface with
loose (rolling resistant material) removed. Measure the average depth of the three deepest
ruts on each side, from the bottom of the straightedge to the solid ground in the bottom of
the rut. Use the higher average (left or right) depth for that location. Rut width does not
affect severity. See Figure 9.2, Rut Depth, and Table 9.9, Rut Severity.

9.6.2.4 Rolling Resistance Material (RRM). RRM is any type of loose or unbound
material that separates from the solid base and lies on top of the surface and in the ruts. In
sufficient quantities, it increases the rolling resistance, and therefore increases the amount
of runway required for C-17 takeoffs. It is more prevalent in dry soils and is a byproduct of
severe rutting.
9.6.2.4.1 Stick a ruler into the RRM until you hit solid ground and read the number on
the ruler at the top of the RRM to the nearest 1/4 inch.
9.6.2.4.2 Take a minimum of seven measurements in each gear path and average those
measurements. Determine average RRM depth by averaging the measurements in the
touchdown area, in the primary braking area, at the point of rotation, and the last 500
feet of runway. Use Table 9.10, Rolling Resistance Material, below to determine
rolling resistance material.

9.6.2.5 Dust. The natural material on unsurfaced airfields and the multiple passes of the
aircraft cause fine materials to separate from the soil binder, become airborne and become
a significant problem for personnel, trailing aircraft, and the environment. Have a vehicle
drive at 60 miles per hour down the runway. Watch the dust cloud and check the
appropriate box on the table. For example, if you cannot see the vehicle, check Red. Use

Measure the depth of the erosion and check the appropriate box on the inspection sheet.

9.6.2.7 Stabilized Layer Failure. If the runway surface material is mixed with a stabilizing
agent, the resulting mix is called a stabilized layer. A failure occurs when areas of that
layer begin to crack and delaminate. The cracks get closer together and interconnect until
the surface resembles an alligator skin; this is called alligator cracking. Use Table 9.13,
Stabilized Layer Failure and Figure 9.4, Stabilized Layer Failure.
NOTE: An abrupt vertical change of more than 2 inches could cause the nose gear to collapse.
The runway surface must be repaired before the airfield can be used. Place a straightedge across
the failed area and measure the depth.

9.6.3 Rolling Friction Factor (RFF). The RFF measurement directly impacts takeoff data
for C17 aircraft. The rolling friction factor is important when the unsurfaced airfield is soft
enough to produce appreciable loose till. The aircraft must plow through this loose till and this
produces a requirement for slightly longer takeoff distances. Use the same value obtained
during the RRM assessment and enter it into the table below. Pass the RFF value to the crew
during their mission planning phase but no later than takeoff as they must have this value
before they land at the LZ. See Table 9.14, Rolling Friction Factor.

9.6.4 Runway Condition Rating (RCR). The runway condition rating is important to the
aircrew as a planning tool in determining takeoff and landing distance values. The primary

ETL 97-9. Also known as a skid test, this procedure directly measures the skid distance of a
ground vehicle and correlating that to RCR.
9.6.5 Soil Strength. The strength of the in-place subgrade or controlling layer will determine
allowable number of passes of the design aircraft at the planned AGL. AGL is directly related
to the airfield CBR; however, semi prepared fields comprise multiple layers with varying
thickness and CBR values. The strength of the subgrade and construction materials can be
determined in terms of the CBR by using a dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) and entering the
data obtained in the pavement-transportation computer aided structural engineering (PCASE)
software. The DCP is the preferred method of obtaining CBR field data. It will penetrate layers
having CBR strengths in excess of 100 and will measure soil strengths less than 1. It is a
powerful, relatively compact, sturdy device that produces consistent results. The procedure for
conducting site evaluations is provided in ETL 97-9, Appendix C.
9.6.5.1 LZSOs are responsible for verifying the existing CBR does not significantly differ
from the LZ survey (within 7-days for C-17 operations; not required for C-130s).
NOTE: The DCP/CBR analysis determines the weakest layer (controlling layer) in order to
determine an appropriate AGL/pass count ratio that meets mission requirements. For example,
assessing an LZ that is suitable for only 10 passes of a C-17 at 450,000 pounds may not be relevant
to the mission if planned gross weights do not approach 450,000 pounds. For this reason, conduct
the analysis in conjunction with the user and mobility mission planners to provide a range of
AGL/passes to meet commander’s intent.
9.6.5.2 For C17 crews this assessment for semi prepared ALZs, other than matted
surfaces, are completed by within 1-week of the first landing or following any
environmental change (e.g., rain) to the surface. This verifies that the LZ meets C-17
requirements and is comparable to the LZ properties annotated on the approved survey.
9.6.6 Field Layout. Various systems are used during daytime operations to provide visual
cues to pilots about the location and dimensions of the LZ runway. The type of marker panels
selected depends on the mission requirements and anticipated duration of LZ use. For
AMLOs, the primary method of setting up the LZ is by using VS-17 marker panels and/or the
light kit, though lights are not required if night operations are not anticipated. Using the
Defense Advanced Global Positioning System Receiver (DAGR) or other approved GPS unit,
enter the coordinates for the LZ boundaries from the AF Form 3822. From the threshold
coordinates, the 500 foot box may be measured using a measuring wheel or by using the GPS.
9.6.7 Installation of Panels and Lights. LZ runways intended for short-term or temporary
use should be marked with one of the arrangements of AMP defined in AFI 13-217. AMP-2
and AMP-3 are the two most commonly used configurations. AMP-4 does not require any
marker panels or lights and is only used for appropriate special operations. See Figure 9.5,
AMP-1 Day and Night Markings and Figure 9.6, AMP-3 Day and Night Markings.

9.7 Range Control. Range control personnel may require specific training and briefings to
operate within the range. Coordination with range control should be accomplished prior to the day
of operations to identify potential conflicts with communications, gain access to the LZ, conduct
runway assessments and DCPs, and open the LZ.
9.7.1 Administration. Each operating location is different, but generally the LZSO will often
be required to check in with a range control entity to gain access to the LZ, collect vehicle
passes, go over local area information and hazards, and sign out a radio. Ensure that the radio
works before departing range control.
9.7.2 Opening the LZ. Prior coordination with range control provides an estimate of the
amount of time required to check in, conduct radio checks, travel to the LZ, assess the LZ,
setup the LZ markings, establish entry control points, and open the LZ.
9.7.3 Firefighting. Ensure ARFF is coordinated in accordance with AMCI 11-208 and
updated as the schedule changes.
9.8 Operational Considerations. Upon arriving at the LZ, conduct an assessment if it was not
accomplished previously. Identify locations that provide an optimal vantage point to observe
aircraft as they approach, land, conduct ground operations, and depart. The location should
provide optimal visibility while remaining clear of potential FOD. Ideally, it should also aid in
limiting access to the LZ by unauthorized personnel or vehicles. Coordinate communications with
proper TACS-AAGS entities and airspace authorities.

9.8.1 Markings. Setup the LZ using panels in accordance with AFI 13-217 and ensure they
are staked down securely. The desired marking pattern should have been precoordinated with
the user.
9.8.2 Communications. After the LZ markings have been installed, conduct radio checks,
open the LZ with range control, prepare landing logs, and prepare to receive aircraft.
9.8.3 Field Checks. Periodically conduct field checks to ensure the LZ has not deteriorated
past the usable level. Any time the aircraft or user will not be using the runway for a brief
amount of time (long enough to drive the length of the LZ), it may be necessary to conduct a
field check.
9.8.4 Issues. As an LZSO you may have to react to potential issues that create safety
conflicts. Monitor aircraft for potential traffic conflicts, landing gear status, and landing
conflicts. Monitor the LZ for potential incursions from animals, unauthorized personnel, and
vehicles during operations. Do not hesitate to address conflicts or direct a go-around.
9.8.5 Coordinating Airspace. The LZ may be in a restricted area or require activation of
special airspace. This may be done by the user, but should be verified with range control
and/or theater AOC.
9.9 Checklists. For LZ operation checklists, see Attachment 3, AMLO Field Guide.

CHAPTER 10
CH10 DROP ZONE OPERATIONS
DROP ZONE OPERATIONS
10.1 Introduction. Airland operations are more efficient than, and normally preferable to,
airdrop operations; however, airdrop may be the optimal delivery method for a number of reasons
to include lack of suitable landing surface, obstructed landing surface, or threat. Airdrop
operations require complex planning, increased aircrew training requirements, and increased
aircrew workload during execution. Proper employment requires accurate markings via
high-precision coordinates, weather, and intelligence data to include imagery, threat system
capabilities, and C3. The techniques in this chapter are not all encompassing.
10.2 Airdrop Advantages.
• Maximizes initial mass of personnel and/or equipment at objective area.
• Suitable landing surface not required.
• Allows delivery to remote areas and dynamic locations. May enable an element of surprise.
• Minimizes the size of the objective area.
• Requires minimal, if any, ground support or MHE.
• Often results in minimum closure of objective area and minimum exposure of airlift assets.
10.3 Airdrop Disadvantages.
• Increased monetary cost and time for aerial delivery resources (e.g., chutes, rigging, and
airdrop inspections).
• Does not maximize cargo capacity.
• Does not allow back-haul.
• Reduced unit integrity (e.g., troops and equipment may be separated).
• Increased potential for injury to personnel and damage to equipment.
• Sensitive equipment may not survive airdrop.
10.4 Drop Zone Surveys. USAF aircrews require a DZ survey for training airdrop missions
involving US personnel and/or equipment. Completing the DZ survey process involves both a
physical inspection of the DZ, and documenting the information on AF Form 3823. Surveys may
be accomplished by the unit whose equipment or personnel are being airdropped. For exercises
and joint training operations, users must ensure the survey is completed and meets the appropriate
criteria for operational and safety standards. If requesting special tactics combat controllers to
conduct the survey the user should identify this requirement during the initial planning conference
but no later than the mid-planning conference. The user must conduct a physical inspection of the
DZ prior to use to identify and evaluate potential hazards to airdropped personnel/equipment,
man-made or natural structures, and ground personnel. The nearest group tactics office will
perform the safety-of-flight review to ensure there are no obstructions prohibiting over-flight. If
the survey was conducted using any other method than GPS-derived coordinates, provide the
safety-of-flight reviewer with the raw coordinate data and the method of conversion. If a DZ
survey is done on an existing surveyed DZ to meet new run-in axis requirements for a particular
mission, only a safety-of-flight review is required.
10-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
10.4.1 Host Nation DZ Surveys. When dropping HN military jumpers and/or equipment on
a HN surveyed DZ, the mission can be performed using only a safety-of-flight review of the
HN survey. Users remain responsible for ground operational and safety criteria. However,
when US personnel and equipment are airdropped, HN surveys will not be used in lieu of a
survey completed by US forces.
10.4.2 Safety-of-Flight Review. A safety-of-flight review is completed by the nearest Air
Force wing/group tactics office on all DZ surveys. During contingency operations, the safety
of flight review may be accomplished by the tactics office in the AMD/AOC. The purpose of
a safety-of-flight review is to ensure an aircraft can safely ingress and egress the DZ. A
safety-of-flight review includes an in-depth chart study of the terrain features along the route
of flight from the insertion point to a distance beyond the trailing edge as determined by the
mission planner. Refer to AFI 13-217 for more guidance.
10.4.3 Zone Assessment Registry (ZAR). When creating a new DZ survey check the ZAR
for the most current DZ survey forms and remarks template. Ensure the surveyed zone fits the
minimum DZ size for the anticipated airdrop application. As a best practice make the surveyed
DZ as large as reasonably possible so that it can be used for future airdrop applications that
might require larger DZ sizes. This will also decrease the risk of off-DZ drops during training.
DZ surveys become obsolete 5 years after the date of MAJCOM approval (block 4E on AF
Form 3822) and must be resurveyed prior to use. Surveys will also be re-accomplished when
the user and/or airlift provider determines changes in the ground or air aspects of the DZ data
require a new survey.
10.5 Drop Zone Types.
10.5.1 Rectangular. One of the most common DZ used for training. Rectangular DZs are
defined by a length and a width and will have a specified run-in heading. It is very common to
have multiple PI locations listed on the DZ survey for different drop types.
10.5.2 Circular DZ. The size of the DZ is governed by mission requirements and usable
terrain. The PI of a circular DZ is normally at the DZ center to allow for multiple run-in
headings. For specific missions, the PI location may be adjusted to allow for sequential heavy
equipment (HE) or mass container delivery system (CDS) on circular DZs. However, this
limits the run-in heading to only one direction. In all cases, the minimum DZ dimensions for
the type and number of loads being dropped must completely fit into the surveyed circular DZ.
10.5.3 Tactical DZ. Tactical DZs are primarily used during exercises or contingencies. They
provide the supported forces commander with a means to rapidly respond to user requests
through the rapid survey/approval process. Tactical DZs are normally restricted to missions
supporting actual resupply and personnel infiltration airdrops (versus proficiency jumps
and/or standard airdrop training bundles [SATB]). Tactical DZ surveys are done in an
abbreviated manner, but still require a physical survey of the DZ by special tactics (ST)
combat controllers, AMLO, or the supported force to ensure DZ suitability. A safety-of-flight
review is also required.
10.5.4 Area DZ. An area DZ consists of a start point (point A), an endpoint (point B), and a
prearranged flight path (line-of-flight) over a series of acceptable drop sites between these
points. The distance between points A and B generally should not exceed 15 nautical miles
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
10-3
and changes in ground elevation within 1/2 nautical mile of centerline should not exceed 300
feet. The reception committee may receive the drop at any location between point A and point
B within 1/2 nautical mile of center-line. Once the prebriefed signal or electronic navigational
aids (NAVAID) has been identified and located, the drop may be accomplished.
10.5.5 Random Approach DZ. A random approach DZ is a variation of a previously
surveyed DZ and of sufficient size to permit multiple run-in headings. Any axis of approach
may be used as long as the resulting DZ meets the minimum criteria for the load/personnel
being airdropped and remains within the boundaries of the original surveyed DZ. In all cases,
perform a safety-of-flight review prior to use.
10.5.6 Special Purpose DZ. Special purpose DZs are only approved for use by Air Force
special tactics, combat rescue officers, pararescue, and rescue squadron (RQS) assigned or
supporting SERE specialists. Training jumps should closely duplicate conditions that could be
encountered during operational missions, to include rough terrain, open sea, and unfamiliar or
unimproved areas. Care will be taken to ensure that all conditions, especially safety-related are
identified to the jumpmaster (JM) and jumpers.
10.5.6.1 Coordination for Use. The operations group commander, or designated
representative, will coordinate with agencies exercising control over sites selected for use
and will publish directives describing necessary operating instructions including hazards
and restrictions. Guidelines for selection and use are listed below:
10.5.6.1.1 Open Field DZ. Caution will be exercised with respect to terrain and
obstacles (e.g., runways, lights, high tension lines, rocky terrain) that could be
hazardous to jumpers. Hazards must not be located within 100 meters of the center of
the DZ except when conducting runway assault operations and demonstration jumps.
10.5.6.1.2 Tree Jump DZ. The criteria for selecting open field jumps apply as well to
tree jump areas; in addition, they will be selected to be relatively free of stumps and
dead falls. Certain trees have hazardous features such as excessive height, sloping
branches, or no branches, and should be taken into account when selecting the DZ.
Complete tree jump equipment will be worn when conducting intentional tree jumps.
10.5.6.1.3 Mission DZs. The operations group commander, or designated
representative, will periodically select unimproved and unfamiliar jump areas for the
purpose of conducting operational mission training. Areas selected must meet the
above criteria however; shrub brush, thickets, small trees, and tundra areas are not
considered hazardous to jumpers. Tree stumps that would be considered hazardous will
not be located closer than 50 meters from the center of the target. Risk management
must be exercised by the JM when conducting operational mission training and an
extensive evaluation should be performed prior to deployment.
10.5.6.1.4 Water DZs. Hazardous obstacles such as buoys, channel markers, piers, and
shoreline will be at least 400 meters from the center of the target area.
10.5.7 Military Free Fall (MFF) DZ. This includes operations utilizing MC-4, MC-5, SOV
3HH, or approved equivalent parachutes deployed in free fall or by static line. The JM will
determine the minimum size DZ based on the number of personnel to be dropped, jumper
proficiency, and the prevailing winds.
10-4
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
10.6 Minimum DZ Size. In training, use AFI 13-217 to determine minimum DZ size. In
contingencies, the supported force determines minimum DZ size, but airdrop damage estimation
(ADE) calculations aid decision makers in risk analysis. Confirm all coordinates, elevations, and
run-in data during mission planning. DZ survey magnetic axis accuracy degrades as surveys age.
Consider deriving magnetic course with portable flight planning software tools (which use true
course) and convert variation to magnetic course. When calculating minimum DZ size ensure you
are referencing the current AFI 13-217.
10.6.1 Step 1. Determine the required minimum distance from the start (leading edge) of the
drop zone to the PI. This is found in AFI 13-217, Chapter 2, Table 2.2, Standard Point of
Impact Placement. This distance is dependent on type of drop, aircraft, and day or night. If any
of these variables change you must determine if the DZ size is still valid.
10.6.2 Step 2. Use AFI 13-217, Chapter 2, Table 2.1, Standard Drop Zone Size Criteria to
determine the minimum length and width required. To determine this you will need to know
the drop type, drop aircraft, and drop altitude at a minimum. It is critical to reference the many
notes found on this table that add required size to the DZ. For example a DZ might be wide
enough for a single ship C-130, but width increases by 100 yards for a day formation. This is
because the wingman offsets just outside of lead’s wake turbulence during drops increasing
their lateral error from the desired computer air release point (CARP).
10.6.3 Step 3. For circular DZs you must use Option 1 or 2 to ensure the calculated minimum
rectangular DZ fits within the boundaries of the surveyed circular DZ. See Figure 10.1,
Circular Drop Zone Computation.
Figure 10.1 Circular Drop Zone Computation

10.6.4 Actual Size. For actual operations drop zone size will be determined by the supported
force’s commander and will vary on the level of acceptable risk. Mobility tactics shops can run
probability simulations to determine probability ellipses for where the airdrop load will land.
These can be overlaid on drop zone imagery to help commanders make an assessment to the
level of risk they are willing to assume. If a non-movable asset is in too high a probability
ellipse airdrop planners can change drop altitude, run-in heading, chute type, or PI placement
to change the probability ellipses.
10.7 Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE). The ADE methodology steps are designed so that it can
be used in a deliberate manner where time is not a factor or in situations where time is critical. The
ADE methodology is not an exact science. The supporting technical data and processes are
derived from empirical data, probability, and historical observations. All of the sources contain
some degree of inherent error and uncertainty. The ADE methodology does not predict actual
mission outcome. Environmental factors, parachute reliability, and navigation system accuracy
are primary factors for ADE output differing from actual employment. Though the ADE
methodology generates estimated values, neither mission planners or commanders should be
under the impression these values in any way constitute flawless data or ground truth. ADE
methodology is merely an estimate to assist a commander in the decision making process by
relying on informed data and sound judgment. For more information reference the ADE Tactics
Bulletin maintained at AMC/A3D, AFTTP 3-3.C-17, and AFTTP 3-3.C-130.
10.8 Types of Air Drops.
10.8.1 Container Delivery System (CDS). CDS airdrops are designed to airdrop single or
double A-22 type containers. CDS drops are gravity-assisted airdrops used to deliver bundles
with a suspended weight up to 2,200 pounds. These loads are cushioned with
energy-absorbing material (honeycomb) and may be suspended by a number of different
parachutes. Each container can be rigged and airdropped one at a time or in pairs for multiple
deliveries or all from both sides on a single pass. Static takeoffs, abrupt turns, fuel purging,
evasive maneuvers, and turbulence can cause the honeycomb to compress on one side,
possibly causing the bundle to malfunction as it exits. CDS falls into two general categories:
low-velocity (LV) and high-velocity (HV). The low and high refers to the rate of fall.
Generally, LV parachutes result in less damage to bundles and greater recovery rates than HV.
However, LV parachutes are more affected by wind than their HV counterparts. Through 2008,
HV recovery rates in Afghanistan were on average 10 percent less than LV. Single A-22 type
containers may be rigged for LV or HV airdrops. Double A-22 type containers are normally
rigged for low-velocity airdrops only. See Figure 10.2, Rigged CDS Containers.
10-6
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
Figure 10.2 Rigged CDS Containers
10.8.1.1 High-velocity Container Delivery System (HVCDS). The 12-, 22-, and 26-foot
ring slot and low-cost aerial delivery system-high velocity (LCADS-HV) are the primary
parachutes used for HVCDS airdrops. Loads normally consist of indestructible supplies
that can withstand the high-velocity impact. These chutes are designed to minimize
oscillation of the load and retard the rate of fall which then ensures an acceptable landing
shock. High velocity parachutes are generally more accurate than low velocity due to less
time of fall and less susceptibility to wind drift.
10.8.1.2 Low-Velocity Container Delivery System. The G-12E, G-13, G-14, and low-cost
aerial delivery system-low velocity (LCADS-LV) are the primary parachutes used for low
velocity CDS airdrops. Ballistic data is located in AFI 11-231, Computed Air Release
Point Procedures. Due to their relative low rate of fall, low velocity parachutes are better
for load survivability and airdrop of fragile and sensitive items (e.g., ammunition).
Because they have a longer time of fall, they are more affected by wind and generally less
accurate.
10.8.2 Low-Cost/Low-Altitude (LCLA). Aerial delivery system consisting of low-weight
airdrop bundles deployed from the aircraft ramp and door at very low altitudes, enabling
circular error (CE) accuracy within 100 meters. This airdrop is appropriate for employment
within or near a FOB or close to troops. While similar to CDS, a LCLA airdrop is unique and
has the following differences:
• Chute types range from disposable polypropylene parachutes to condemned personnel
parachutes.
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
10-7
• The bundles are located on the ramp (either through drift-back or initial position) and
manually cut by the LM at GL.
• The flaps remain at 50 percent during the drop.
• Sight angle is currently the preferred method to determine GL.
10.8.2.1 All LCLA parachutes are one-time-use expendable items. MAJCOMs may
permit subordinate organizations to reuse 24-foot and 35-foot cargo parachutes for training
purposes only. T-10 personnel parachutes that have exceeded their useful life for personnel
can be repurposed for LCLA use, further reducing costs. See Figure 10.3, LCLA
Employed by C-130H during Operation Christmas Drops.
Figure 10.3 LCLA Employed by C-130H during Operation Christmas Drops
10.8.3 Personnel Airdrop. These airdrops consist of jumpers exiting from the paratroop
doors or the aft cargo ramp and door (tailgate) using static line procedures. The user and airlift
commanders and mission planners coordinate the airdrop altitude and surface wind
limitations. Refer to AFI 13-217 and governing regulations for specific drop altitude
considerations. Combat drops can be conducted at lower altitudes, as determined jointly by
airborne and airlift commanders, to minimize jumper vulnerability (time under canopy).
10.8.3.1 Aircrew Coordination. During personnel airdrop training confirm with the
aircrew the number of personnel that left the aircraft after each pass, compare this to the
number of chutes seen in the air. This is critical during high altitude low opening
(HALO)/high altitude high opening (HAHO) personnel jumps where it is nearly
impossible to see individuals leaving the aircraft until their chute deploys. If the number of
10-8
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
chutes observed does not match the number of jumpers dropped immediately pause drop
training until personnel are accounted for or discrepancy is resolved.
10.8.4 Heavy Equipment. HE airdrops are low-velocity airdrops designed to deliver
ready-to-use equipment and supplies to forces in the field. Loads consist of vehicles,
equipment, or supplies rigged for airdrop, normally on Type V platforms. Platforms are
extracted singularly or sequentially by extraction parachutes after which the load descends
under cargo parachutes. See Figure 10.4, C-130H Dropping Heavy Equipment.
Figure 10.4 C-130H Dropping Heavy Equipment
10.8.5 Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB). For training purposes aircrew can drop
15-pound bags of sand attached to a pilot chute to simulate heavy equipment, CDS, personnel,
or LCLA. Aircrew will fly the aircraft in accordance with the drop simulated and will either
drop on the SATB CARP or for sight angle training drop on the drop type simulated CARP. If
not dropping on the SATB CARP, the aircrew will adjust the drop score to the difference
between the SATB CARP and the simulated air drop CARP. The aircrew are still required to
keep the SATB on the DZ.
10.8.6 Door Bundle Airdrops. Door bundles are A-7A or A-21 containers weighing up to
500-pounds rigged with T-10B or G-14 parachutes. Door bundles can be dropped from the
paratroop doors or from the ramp and door, may be dropped separately or in conjunction with
personnel and are limited to one bundle per exit door used. When dropped with personnel, the
bundle is the first object to exit the aircraft. Door bundles may be dropped at 300 to 400 feet
AGL, depending on the type of chute being used or at an altitude consistent with personnel if
dropped in combination with troopers.
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
10-9
10.8.7 Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC). This item is employed in a variety of
missions including unconventional warfare, special warfare, and amphibious operations. The
CRRC is an inflated Zodiac Mark III rubber raiding craft rigged on a 75 inch by 144 inch (i.e.,
75”x144”) combat expendable platform (CEP). The system uses a G-12E cargo parachute
deployed by a 15-foot deployment parachute. The boat has an accompanying load capacity of
up to 1,170 pounds of equipment (e.g., weapons, scuba gear). On a single pass, 2 CRRCs and
up to 18 parachutists or 1 CRRC and up to 19 parachutists may be dropped.
10.8.8 Combination Airdrop. Combination airdrops are those during which parachutists exit
from the aircraft ramp after equipment extraction or gravity release (e.g., CDS, CRRC,
container ramp bundle).
10.8.8.1 Combination drops are restricted to single-ship or the last aircraft of an
equipment formation. When tailgating parachutists, the drop altitude is determined by the
item requiring the highest drop altitude per AFI 11-231.
10.8.9 Free-Fall and Parabundle Drop. Free-fall drop is the delivery of certain non-fragile
items of supply without parachutes. While not regularly practiced, airdrop of supplies without
parachutes is possible. These operations include, but are not limited to, disaster relief,
humanitarian aid, and contingency operations where response time is critical and
parachute/rigging facilities are not available. Loads are normally rigged with available
materials to ensure maximum survivability. Examples of free-fall loads include clothing, hay,
food, and medical supplies. Aircrews will normally conduct free-fall drops at low altitude
(approximately 300 feet AGL) using CDS procedures. Mission planners must ensure safety of
both the aircrews and ground personnel when selecting drop sites. Conduct free-fall drops in
an area free of obstacles. Drops in sandy or damp terrain may improve load survivability.
10.8.10 Joint Precision Aerial Delivery System (JPADS). JPAD bundles/platforms are
GPS-guided loads that use wind dropsondes before the cargo drop to get a more accurate
in-flight CARP. JPADS are usually dropped from high altitudes. JPADS requires additional
mission support equipment (MSE) installed on the aircraft to function. The UHF dropsonde
receive system (UHF-DRS) connects to the aircraft UHF antenna and communicates
dropsonde information to the MPS. The GPS-retransmit subsystem (GPS-RTS) connects to
the aircraft GPS system and broadcasts a GPS signal throughout the cargo compartment.
Coordinate with maintenance to ensure equipment is installed and operational on applicable
aircraft.
10.8.10.1 Improved Container Delivery System (I-CDS). I-CDS is an unguided
conventional A-22 or LCADS CDS bundle, which uses MPS software to combine
weather-model forecast data and dropsonde data to create an improved CARP. Use
requires UHF-DRS, GPS-RTS, MPS, and dropsonde hardware.
10.8.10.2 Dropsondes. Dropsondes do not have a minimum DZ size and are deliberately
manually released from the aircraft. During contingency operations, dropsondes may be
released anywhere in the vicinity of the objective area and do not have to land on the DZ.
If not dropping on a surveyed DZ, the aircrew must coordinate with the air mobility
division tactics personnel to ensure the sonde will not cause injury to personnel or damage
to facilities. During training operations, dropsonde release should be incorporated into the
10-10
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
collateral damage assessment to ensure that the sonde will land on the DZ or within a
restricted area.
10.8.10.3 JPADS/I-CDS Collateral Damage Assessments. Collateral damage assessments
(CDA) are required for all JPADS (guided systems) and I-CDS airdrop operations. CDAs
are a necessary safety measure to mitigate as much damage risk as possible to aircraft,
people, buildings, and equipment on the DZ and surrounding areas. The CDA must be
accomplished for areas surrounding the DZ out to the furthest potential failure footprint
points created by the precision airdrop system-mission planner (PADS-MP) with a valid
Air Force Weather Agency wind file. The CDA must include a review of:
• 63 percent I-CDS success ellipse.
• Load malfunctions (fouled chute, broken guide lines, separated chute) that prevent
I-CDS loads from falling according to published ballistic data.
• Loss of GPS link on a guided load (3 to 1 glide ratio from drop altitude).
• Load malfunction (e.g., fouled chute, broken guide lines) that prevents guided loads
from navigating to the DZ.
10.8.10.3.1 During contingency operations, the surveying or controlling unit, the user,
and the JFC designated agency must accomplish a CDA. The user/supported force
ultimately accepts responsibility for all damage to structures, persons, and equipment
as a result of the airdrop.
10.9 Surface Wind Limits for Airdrops. See Table 10.1, Surface Wind Limits for
CDS/Equipment Airdrops and Table 10.2, Surface Wind Limits for Personnel Airdrops.

10.10.2 G-12E Parachute. The G-12E is a 64-foot parachute and is the Army’s principal
parachute for CDS airdrops. Under normal conditions, the chutes are fully deployed 370 feet
below the aircraft.
10.10.3 G-13 and G-14 Parachutes. The G-13 and G-14 are respectively 24 feet and 34 feet

10.10.6.1 T-10 Parachute. The T-10 is a 35-foot parabolic chute. Under normal conditions,
it is fully deployed 180 feet below the aircraft. Airborne and airlift commanders jointly
determine the minimum drop altitude during combat operations.
10.10.6.2 T-11 Parachute. The T-11 is a 28.6-foot square chute. 500 feet AGL is the
typical drop altitude. Airborne and airlift commanders jointly determine the minimum
drop altitude during combat operations.
10.10.6.3 MC1-1 Parachute. The MC1-1 is a 35-foot, 11-inch modified T-10. Although its
design allows increased maneuverability, it has disadvantages when compared to the T-10.
Due to twisting and entanglement prior to gaining control, the MC1-1 has experienced
numerous midair collisions; consequently, paratroopers require a higher degree of
experience. Under normal conditions, it is fully deployed 180 feet below the aircraft.
Airborne and airlift commanders jointly determine the minimum drop altitude during
combat operations.
10.11 Roles and Responsibilities. DZ size and selection are the shared responsibility of the
supporting force commander and the supported force commander. The supported force is
responsible for DZ establishment, operation, safety, and for the elimination or acceptance of
ground hazards associated with the DZ. The use of standard DZ are essential to safe operations.
They are required for Air Force unilateral aircrew training, and recommended for allied/joint
training airdrops. The supported force will take responsibility for injury of personnel and damage
to equipment that could result from using a DZ that does not meet the standard DZ size criteria.
The airlift mission commander is normally responsible for airdrop accuracy and safety-of-flight
for all aircrew directed airdrops at drop zones meeting the above size criteria. The supported force
is normally responsible for airdrop accuracy when using ground marking release system (GMRS),
verbally initiated release system (VIRS), or jumpmaster directed release (JMDR) procedures. The
JM is responsible for airdrop accuracy when using JMDR procedures.
10.11.1 Drop Zone Controller (DZC) Responsibilities.
10.11.1.1 The DZC represents the appropriate commander as provided in the mission
directive. The DZC ensures that adequate medical and evacuation coverage is available
prior to personnel airdrops. The DZC observes and evaluates:
• All factors that may adversely affect the safety of the operation and ensures
transmission of weather information when required.
• Condition of the DZ prior to the airdrop.
• Placement of personnel and equipment on the DZ. Only designated vehicles and
personnel will remain on the DZ. Recovery and medical personnel and equipment must
be positioned so that constant contact is maintained with the DZC. During joint
operations, the DZC and the drop zone safety officer (DZSO) are responsible for their
respective equipment and personnel.
NOTE: For actual equipment or personnel airdrops, if the ceiling is less than 600 feet, direct all
personnel and equipment off the DZ to ensure safety.
• The operation of other aircraft that could endanger the drop aircraft, equipment load,
or parachutists.
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
10-15
• The DZC should have immediate access to ground-to-air communications
equipment or sufficient signaling aids to operate the DZ. Ground-to-air
communication is required for instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) airdrops.
• The DZC ensures non-DZC personnel are aware of the “NO DROP” signal in order
to prevent an inadvertent signal to the aircraft.
10.11.1.2 Unsafe Conditions. In the event conditions are unsafe for airdrop operations, the
DZC ensures that:
• “NO DROP” signals are displayed on the DZ.
• “NO DROP” or drop cancellation information is transmitted to the aircraft.
• A drop is canceled when advised by the DZSO. During a joint mission, the DZSO is
responsible for evaluating the winds and surface conditions for an airdrop operation.
When only Air Force personnel are involved, it is the responsibility of the DZC to
cancel the airdrop when conditions are unsafe.
• Ensures necessary reports to include AF Form 4304, Drop Zone/Landing Zone
Control Log are properly filled out and submitted to the appropriate agencies.
10.11.2 Drop Zone Safety Officer (DZSO). During training operations, the airdropped force
furnishes the DZSO, who in turn is responsible for the following functions:
NOTE: DZC/DZSO duties may be combined during unilateral US Air Force operations.
• Ensuring adequate medical coverage is available at the DZ prior to any personnel drops.
The supported unit normally provides medical coverage for itself and Air Force
parachutists during joint operations.
• Clearing the DZ of all personnel and equipment not required for control.
• Determining when surface conditions (e.g., winds, vehicles) on the DZ are hazardous to
airborne operations, making the decision to proceed with, suspend or cancel airdrops, and
informing the DZC not later than two minutes prior to the drop. Airdrops are not
suspended or canceled based solely on aircraft alignment with the DZ.
• Coordinating all “NO DROP” actions with the DZC.
• Ensures the conditions of the DZ will not affect operations or recovery of air items.
• Ensures the DZ meets operational and safety criteria for the type airdrop operations
being conducted.
10.12 Drop Zone Safety. The DZC establishes the control point location taking into account
pertinent factors such as an unobstructed line of sight, winds, positive control of the DZ,
surrounding airspace, and security requirements. Safety factors must always be considered when
choosing a control point location. During actual IMC, HVCDS, or HAARS, locate the control
point off the DZ. The control point for multi-ship HE and all CDS equipment airdrops will be
offset a minimum of 300 yards HE and 200 yards (CDS) from the intended PI. It is recommended
when dropping actuals that you leave any vehicles on the drop zone running in case they have to
be moved. Keep personnel on the DZ together at the control point to make sure they are aware of
the drop. For personnel drops keep moving vehicles off the DZ until the personnel are on the
ground. It is very difficult for vehicle drivers to see objects in the air above them.

AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
10.13 Mishap Planning and Reporting.
10.13.1 Airdrop Malfunction. The failure of an airdrop item or component of an airdrop
system to function as it was intended or designed, whether the equipment failed because of
human error or emergency procedures were used.
10.13.2 Airdrop Incident. Any procedure that prevented the successful completion of any
planned airdrop planned airdrop operation.
10.13.3 Documentation. In the event of an airdrop malfunction or incident inform the
aircrew via a radio transmission and give a brief description of what you saw from the ground.
Make a written statement of the conditions at the time of drop and what you saw. Keep any
photos or videos you have of the incident. Do not alter the load or rigging until a qualified
malfunction officer can investigate. If this is not possible document the rigging and chute to
the best of your abilities before removing from the DZ. Turn over all information you have
collected to the group tactics office as soon as possible. You might be asked to participate in a
bad bomb board, normally conducted the next day. Once there is an off DZ drop, malfunction,
or incident during training, aircrew will stop dropping until an investigation has cleared the
aircrew and the aircraft to fly.
10.14 Drop Zone Markings. A marked DZ is defined as a DZ that has a PI or release point
marked with a precoordinated visual or electronic signal. Standard DZs may be marked with
raised angle markers (RAM), VS-17 marker panels, visible lighting systems, and light beacons.
Virtually any type of lighting or visual marking system is acceptable if all participating units are
briefed and concur. Night markings or visual acquisition aids may include a light gun, flares, fire
pots, railroad fuses, flashlights, chemlights, and infrared (IR) lighting systems. Electronic
NAVAID markings (e.g., ZM, SST-181, Tactical Aid to Navigation [TACAN]) may be used for
either day or night operations and placed as directed by mission requirements. Ground parties and
aircrews must coordinate and brief “NO DROP” markings for all types of DZs.
10.14.1 Day Operations. During day operations, the PI will be marked with a RAM or block
letter. If authentication is required, a block letter will be used instead of the RAM. Authorized
letters for PI markings are A, C, J, R, and S. The block letters H and O are authorized for
circular DZs. The block letters should be aligned with the surveyed DZ axis or with the aircraft
line-of-flight, if different from the survey. The minimum size for block letters is 35 feet by 35
feet (11 meters by 11 meters) and consists of at least nine marker panels.
10.14.2 Night Operations. During night operations, the PI will be marked with a block letter.
The apex of the block letter will be located on the PI. The minimum size for block letters is 35
feet by 35 feet (11 meters by 11 meters) and consists of at least nine-white lights, with a
recommended minimum output rating of 15 candela. When flanker lights are used, they will
be white and located 250 meters left and right abeam the PI, unless precluded by obstacles or
obstructions. If 250 meters is not used, the aircrew will be briefed. A trailing edge beacon may
be used during actual personnel airdrops. When used, the amber trailing edge beacon will be
placed along the surveyed DZ centerline 1,000 meters from the PI, or at the DZ trailing edge,
whichever is closer to the PI. During pre-mission coordination for personnel drops, aircrews
will identify to the DZC their trailing edge beacon requirements. For all airdrops, the DZ
identification must be coordinated and briefed to the ground party and aircrews.

10.15 Ground Marking Release System (GMRS). When controlling an airdrop, the DZC can
mark a point on the ground with a visual signal to designate the computed release point (RP) to the
aircrew. This signal may be a four marker “L,” six marker “T,” or seven marker “H” and is placed
abeam, 100 meters (110 yards) left of the desired release point. The drop is executed when the
aircraft is directly abeam and 100 meters (110 yards) right of this marker on the prebriefed
inbound heading. A prebriefed code signal or beacon may be collocated with the markers to aid in
DZ identification. See Figure 10.6, GMRS Setup Diagram.
Figure 10.6 GMRS Setup Diagram
10.15.1 Determine Release Point. Once the PI has been determined, calculate the forward
throw distance and wind drift effect to determine the release point.
10.15.2 Wind Drift. Wind drift is defined as the lateral movement of a parachute through the
air caused by the wind. The distance of the wind drift is measured on a direct line from the
parachute’s fully deployed opening point to its actual point of impact on the ground. This drift
is calculated using the formula: D = KAV, where D = drift in yards, K = the load drift constant,
A = drop altitude in hundreds of feet (e.g., 1,000 feet = 10), and V = wind velocity in knots.
See Table 10.4, K-Factors.

10.15.3 Forward Throw. Forward throw distance is the distance along the aircraft flight path
traveled by a parachutist or cargo container after exiting the aircraft, until the parachute fully
opens and the load is descending vertically. See Table 10.5, Forward Throw.
Table 10.5 Forward Throw
10.16 Verbal Initiated Release System. CCT, pararescue, and battlefield weather personnel use
this procedure when normal drop procedures are not tactically feasible. The ground party
determines the desired release point, gives verbal steering guidance to the pilot to align the aircraft
over that point, and then initiates the release. Instructions transmitted to the aircraft must be
concise.

10.16.1 Align Aircraft. Transmit “TURN LEFT” or “TURN RIGHT” to align aircraft on
desired inbound heading.
10.16.2 Aircraft on Course. Transmit “STOP TURN” after alignment instructions when
aircraft is on course.
10.16.3 Release Point Preparation. Transmit “STANDBY” to the aircraft approximately 5
seconds prior to the release point.
10.16.4 Release Point. Transmit “EXECUTE, EXECUTE, EXECUTE” when the aircraft
reaches the release point. Upon hearing the first “EXECUTE” the navigator/pilot not flying
calls “GREEN LIGHT.”
10.17 ADHOC Markings. The tactical situation may dictate the use of nonstandard DZ
markings. When nonstandard markings or identification procedures are used, it is imperative that
all appropriate participants be thoroughly briefed.
10.17.1 Unmarked DZ. This type of DZ is not authenticated with any type of visual or
electronic marking. Unmarked DZs are normally used for contingency operations and may not
have a DZ party present. Air Force special tactics personnel, combat rescue officers,
pararescue, RQS assigned or supporting SERE specialists, and USSOCOM assigned forces
are authorized to drop on unmarked DZs. During training missions, a DZC party must be on
site for safety.
10.18 Ground to Air Communications. Coordinate with the aircrew and/or tactics mission
planners for a primary, secondary, and, in some cases, tertiary communications plan. Some aircraft
may be tactical data link capable; coordinate applicable message types and information exchange
that will aid airdrop execution. The complexity of the communications plan will depend on the
theater and mission importance. Aircrews and DZ ground parties need to have a clear and
common understanding of designated no-drop signals. To facilitate communication, aircrews must
know when they will have LOS communications with the DZ party. An analysis can be run on
Falcon View with digital terrain elevation data (DTED) to estimate when the DZ party will have
LOS communication with the aircraft based on the route of flight and planned altitude. Depending
on threats, terrain, and ingress altitude to the objective area, LOS, and radio transmission power
communications may occur very late on the run-in.
10.18.1 Communications Out/Limited Emissions Operations. Communications out
operations should be thoroughly briefed and understood by the aircrew and ground parties.
During day drops colored smoke or mirror flashes can be used as authorization to drop or no
drop. The removal of the block letter or scattering of the panels can be used as a no-drop
signal, and leaving these intact clearance to drop. For nighttime operations an IR strobe
blinking in a predetermined sequence or a buzz-saw/wagon wheel could be used. An IR laser
is very visible under night vision goggles (NVG) and can be shown straight up to give
clearance. Communication out operations increases risk resulting from aircrew
misinterpreting a ground signal and decreased accuracy without updated surface winds.
10.18.2 NVG Considerations. If using colored lights to for drop zone signals remember that
crews will have to look under their NVGs to discern color. If the light output is not strong
enough crews might not be able to discern color. Avoid shining high output visible lights at
aircrew operating on NVGs.
10-20
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
10.19 Threat Considerations. Both aircraft and the DZ ground party should take actions to
minimize the amount of exposure they are in the enemy weapon engagement zone (WEZ).
Coordination is essential to ensure both understand the tactical limitations and implications of
every aspect of the operation, and what aspects have the most priority. For example, time on target
is not as important as accuracy. As a general rule, place priority on first-pass success and create a
plan to cover as many contingencies as possible to ensure success.

CHAPTER 11
CH11 DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES
DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES
11.1 Introduction. Effective use of air mobility capabilities are critical during DOD response to
a disaster in the United States or its territories. AMLOs play an important role in supporting
response efforts and should understand how DSCA is conducted. This chapter provides an
overview of the DSCA legal authorities, associated command structures, levels of response to a
disaster, DOD roles, and planning considerations for AMLOs supporting DSCA operations. Refer
to JP 3-28, Defense Support of Civil Authorities for more information on DSCA.
11.2 Defined. Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil
Authorities (DSCA) defines DSCA as support provided by US federal military forces, DOD
civilians, DOD contract personnel, DOD component assets, and National Guard forces (when the
SecDef, in coordination with the governors of the affected states, elects and requests to use those
forces in Title 32 status) in response to requests for assistance from civil authorities for domestic
emergencies, law enforcement support, and other domestic activities, or from qualifying entities
for special events. Also known as civil support.
11.3 National Guard. National Guard units, under the control of their respective state governors,
have traditionally been the primary military responders to domestic natural disasters and other
such emergencies. Federal forces are generally called upon only after state resources are
exhausted or overwhelmed, or a specific capability is otherwise unavailable and federal assistance
has been requested by the governor.
AMLOs Supporting Hurricane Maria Relief Efforts
Situation:
Hurricane Maria struck the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico (VIPR) on 20 September 2017 as 
a Category IV storm with wind speeds of approximately 150 miles per hour. Local and 
commonwealth authorities were immediately overwhelmed and lacked the necessary resources 
for effective response to the severe flooding and damage to the islands. This resulted in a 
massive federal government response aimed at saving lives and property.
Action:
In anticipation of deployment of forces into the area via air assets, AMLOs deployed to the 
region to provide eyes on the ground for the director of mobility forces (DIRMOBFOR), 
conduct initial airfield assessments, and coordinate for receiving aircraft. AMLOs performed six 
airfield assessments, coordinated with local authorities to reopen airfields, advised deployed 
leadership on air mobility matters, and planned Title 10 force redeployments in what Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identified as the largest air mission in their history.
Reported Outcome:
Three AMLOs deployed within 24 hours of the storm hitting the islands. All told, six AMLOs 
deployed to VIPR and provided support in one form or another while additional AMLOs 
supported operations from their respective operating locations. AMLOs were on the ground in 
VIPR from the beginning of the deployment phase and through the redeployment of Title 10 
forces.
11-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
11.4 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Under the direction of the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), FEMA is the primary agency (PA) in the federal
response to natural disasters. DOD resources, in coordination with FEMA, may be requested to
augment local, state, and federal capabilities in assisting with a state led response.
11.5 Authorities Governing DSCA. The authorities for provision of DSCA are found in legal
statute, DOD policy, and crisis action orders. The authorities for DOD components to conduct
DSCA operations are found in DODD 3025.18 and CJCS EXORD.
11.6 Legal Authority. Because of the unique nature of DSCA, AMLOs should be familiar with
the legal authority issues associated with this mission.
11.6.1 The Constitution. In the context of this publication, the United States includes the 50
states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam,
American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Under the 10th
Amendment of the Constitution, each state/territory of the United States has the primary
responsibility to prepare for and respond to disasters and emergencies occurring within its
borders. The Constitution establishes the sovereignty of the states over many aspects of
government. Additionally, and of particular importance to domestic operations, are the
authorities granted by Congress to the states. Article 1, Section 8, Clause 16 of the
Constitution, the Militia Act of 1903, and the National Defense Act of 1916 are the basis for the
distinction between National Guard forces and Active Component Title 10 forces. State
governors retain authority over their respective National Guard forces. The authority over and
control of DOD Title 10 forces are at the discretion of the POTUS as the Commander-in-Chief
(CINC).
11.6.1.1 In response to DSCA, expectations of DOD capabilities should be effectively
managed and communicated. The goal is efficient execution of relief operations and
successful synchronization of military and civil capabilities after a disaster when local and
state level infrastructure may be overwhelmed.
11.6.2 The Stafford Act. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act (the Stafford Act) authorizes the President, at the request of the affected State’s Governor,
to issue major disaster or emergency declarations in response to catastrophes that overwhelm
state and local governments.
11.6.3 The Economy Act. The Economy Act permits federal agencies to provide resources
and services to other federal agencies on a reimbursable basis.
11.6.4 Restricting the Use of DOD—Posse Comitatus Act (PCA). The Posse Comitatus
Act prohibits federal, state, and local authorities from using Title 10 forces for any direct civil
law enforcement activities unless a Constitutional or Act of Congress exception applies. PCA
does not prohibit federal forces from assisting state and local organizations with humanitarian
disaster relief.
11.6.4.1 Because PCA is often misunderstood, it is important for commanders of
organizations in a Title 10 role operating in a DSCA environment be familiar with the act
and be able to explain it to civil authorities. PCA does not apply to National Guard in State
Active Duty or Title 32 status; however, it does apply to National Guard in a Title 10
status.
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
11-3
11.7 Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is a Presidential cabinet organization
with the responsibility of security of the homeland, including response to national disasters at the
federal level. Both FEMA and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) are part of DHS.
11.7.1 Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 (HSPD -5). HSPD-5: Management of
Domestic Incidents (2003) required the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and
administer a National Incident Management System (NIMS) and a National Response Plan.
The National Response Plan was replaced by the National Response Framework (NRF) in
2008. The directive requires all federal departments and agencies to adopt NIMS and use it in
individual domestic incident management programs and activities, as well as in support of
state, local, or tribal entities. It also provides detail on the authorities of various government
officials within the national incident management system.
11.7.2 Homeland Security Presidential Directive-8 (HSPD-8). HSPD-8: 
National
Preparedness (2003), a companion directive to HSPD-5, establishes policies to strengthen
preparedness of the United States in order to prevent and respond to threatened or actual
domestic terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. The directive requires a
national domestic, all-hazards preparedness goal, with established mechanisms for improved
delivery of federal preparedness assistance to state and local governments. It also outlines
actions to strengthen preparedness capabilities of federal, state, and local entities.
11.8 Incident Management Processes. The NRF and NIMS are designed to improve the
Nation’s incident management capabilities and overall efficiency in response to domestic
incidents. Given the complexity and extent of local, state, and federal participation in domestic
incident management, there are numerous national-level operational plans and agreements that
detail roles and responsibilities of participants. Together, the NRF and the NIMS integrate the
various capabilities into a cohesive and coordinated framework for domestic incident
management.
11.9 National Response Framework (NRF). The NRF is designed to reduce vulnerability to
natural and man-made hazards, minimize damage, and assist in recovery. It is an all discipline,
all-hazards plan that establishes a single framework for management of domestic incidents. It also
provides the structure and mechanisms for coordination of federal support to local, tribal, and state
incident managers.
11.9.1 Purpose. The NRF is intended to ensure that government executives, leaders of private
sector and NGOs, and emergency management practitioners across the Nation understand
domestic incident response roles, responsibilities, and relationships in order to respond more
effectively. Additionally, the NRF describes special circumstances in which the federal
government exercises a larger role, including incidents where federal interests are involved
and catastrophic incidents where a state would require significant support. It uses the
foundation provided by the Homeland Security Act, HSPD-5, and the Stafford Act to provide a
comprehensive, all-hazards approach to domestic incident management.
11.9.2 Principles of Operation. The overarching objective of response activities centers
upon saving lives, protecting property, and the protecting environment. Five-key principles of
operations within the NRF define response actions in support of the Nation’s response
mission. Taken together, these five-principles of operation constitute the national response
doctrine characterized by:
11-4
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
• Engaged partnerships.
• Tiered response.
• Scalable, flexible, and adaptable operational capabilities.
• Unity of effort through unified command.
• Readiness to act.
11.10 National Incident Management System (NIMS). The NIMS provides doctrine, concepts,
principles, terminology, and organizational processes that establish a template for incident
management. Using this template enables local, tribal, state, and federal governments, as well as
private sector, NGOs, and the DOD to work with unity of effort in disaster relief operations.
11.10.1 Coordination. Incidents typically begin and end locally and are managed on a daily
basis at the lowest possible geographical, organizational, and jurisdictional level. However,
there are instances in which successful incident management operations depend on the
involvement of multiple jurisdictions, levels of government, functional agencies, and/or
emergency responder disciplines. These instances require effective and efficient coordination
across this broad spectrum of organizations and activities.
11.10.2 Incident Management. Incident management refers to how incidents are managed
across homeland security activities, including prevention, protection, response, mitigation,
and recovery. The NIMS framework forms the basis for interoperability and compatibility that
enables a diverse set of public and private organizations to conduct well-integrated and
effective emergency management.
11.10.3 Components. The NIMS incident management structure has three components:
• Incident command system (ICS).
• Interagency coordination systems.
• Public information systems.
11.10.4 Authority. NIMS distinguishes between command authority and coordination
authority. Command authority is vested in the incident commander (IC) for a single incident or
an area commander for multiple incidents or jurisdictions. Coordination authority is vested in
various coordinating officers who have the authority to make decisions within their respective
jurisdictions.
11.11 Incident Command System (ICS). An understanding of the command system used in
federal responses to disasters within the United States will aid AMLOs supporting a DSCA
response. Most incidents are managed locally and are typically handled by local
communications/dispatch centers and emergency management/response personnel within a single
jurisdiction. In other instances, incidents begin with a single response within a single jurisdiction
and rapidly expand to multidisciplinary, multijurisdictional levels requiring significant additional
resources and operational support. ICS is a widely applicable management system designed to
enable effective, efficient incident management. ICS addresses incident command in terms of
single incident command, area command, and unified command. It provides a flexible core
mechanism for coordinated and collaborative incident management. When a single incident
covers a large geographical area, multiple local emergency management and incident response
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
11-5
agencies may be required. Effective cross-jurisdictional coordination using processes and systems
is critical in this situation.
11.11.1 Single Incident Command. The IC, usually an official of local police, fire or other
municipal service, has the direct tactical and operational responsibility for conducting all
incident management activities. The IC is specifically responsible for ensuring incident safety,
providing information services regarding the incident and establishing and maintaining liaison
with other agencies participating in the incident. He or she also has overall responsibility for
managing the incident by defining objectives, planning strategies, and implementing tactics.
To discharge these responsibilities, the IC may appoint one or more deputies from either the
same or the different agencies. A command staff and a general staff generally support the IC.
11.11.2 The Incident Command Post (ICP). The ICP is intended to provide a modular and
standardized on-scene emergency management organization to support the IC. Regardless of
how large, complex, or multijurisdictional the incident becomes, there is only one ICP per
incident.
11.11.3 Area Command. An area command is intended to oversee multiple single incidents,
either geographically dispersed or located in near proximity. Area commands are most
effective for multiple incidents (e.g., two hazardous materials [HAZMAT] spills or several
wildland fires) that will most likely be competing for the same resources and capabilities.
When incidents are of different types or do not have similar resource or capabilities
requirements, they will generally be handled as separate incidents.
11.11.4 Unified Command. A unified command (UC) is intended to allow multiple agencies
to work together efficiently without affecting the authority, accountability, or responsibility of
individual agencies. In a UC, agencies work together at a single ICP location to establish a
common set of objectives and strategies and develop a single incident action plan (IAP).
Agency ICs exercise authority over the personnel of their respective agencies and represent
their function or subject matter in the ICP organization.
11.12 Joint Field Office (JFO). AMLOs should understand the functions within the JFO as
many of the agencies they will coordinate with are located there. The JFO is an interagency
coordination center established to provide a central location for the coordination of local, tribal,
state, federal, nongovernmental, and private sector organizations with responsibilities for incident
response. The JFO does not manage operations; rather, it provides support to on-scene efforts and
conducts broad support operations. A coordinating officer and staff will assist each political level
of jurisdiction (i.e., state, federal, defense) in a typical incident. See Figure 11.1, Joint Field
Office Structure.
11-6
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
Figure 11.1 Joint Field Office Structure
11.12.1 Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO). The FCO is appointed to manage federal
response support activities for Stafford Act disasters and emergencies. The FCO also plays a
significant role in managing the financial aspects of DSCA.
11.12.2 State Coordinating Officer (SCO). The SCO is appointed by the governor to
coordinate state response and recovery operations with the federal government.
11.12.3 Defense Coordinating Officer (DCO). The DCO is the Title 10 officer who serves
as the DOD point of contact at the JFO.
11.12.4 Joint Information Centers (JIC). JICs are facilities established to coordinate all
public information activities related to incidents. They are often co-located with local, state, or
federal emergency operations centers (EOC). JICs provide a location where the organizations
participating in incident management can work together to ensure that timely, accurate,
understandable, and consistent information is disseminated to the public. The JIC has
representatives from each organization involved in management of an incident. ICs and
interagency coordinating entities are responsible for establishing and overseeing JICs,
including processes for coordinating and clearing public communications.
11.13 DHS Emergency Management Organizations.
11.13.1 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA was established in
1979 by executive order as an independent agency and became part of the DHS in 2003.
FEMA serves as the executive agent of DHS for emergency management and is responsible
for responding to, planning for, recovering from, and mitigating against disasters. FEMA is

organized into ten regions. Each region serves as the focal point for organizing and
coordinating state and federal emergency management for incidents within the region. There is
one DCO assigned to each FEMA region. See Figure 11.2, FEMA Regions.
Figure 11.2 FEMA Regions
11.13.2 Coordination. Each of FEMA’s regional offices maintains a regional response
coordination center (RRCC) that expands to become an interagency facility in anticipation of
a serious incident in the region or immediately following an incident. RRCCs coordinate
federal regional response efforts and maintain connectivity with state EOCs and other state
offices and agencies.
11.13.3 United States Coast Guard. The USCG is one of the five armed services, as
prescribed in Title 14, USC, Section 1, Establishment of the Coast Guard that states, “The
Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the
armed forces of the United States at all times.”
11.13.3.1 Placed under the DHS on February 25, 2003, the USCG executes a variety of
missions, including search and rescue (SAR), maritime law enforcement, and defense
readiness.
11.13.3.2 The USCG has trained a number of JFO support teams to assist FEMA during
an incident. USCG JFO teams perform the dual responsibilities of representing USCG
interests during an incident while providing support to the overall federal response.
11.14 Emergency Support Functions (ESF). ESFs are used by the federal government and
many states as the primary mechanism to organize and provide assistance. ESFs are organized into
11-8
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
fifteen functional areas. They may be selectively activated for both Stafford Act and non-Stafford
Act incidents and are assigned to support headquarters, regional, and field activities. See Figure
11.3, Federally Recognized ESFs.
11.14.1 Coordinator. The ESF coordinator or PA is the federal agency with significant
authorities, roles, resources, or capabilities for a particular function within an ESF. The
coordinator has ongoing responsibilities throughout the preparedness, response, and recovery
phases of incident management. The ESF PA serves as a federal executive agent under the
FCO (or Federal Resource Coordinator for non-Stafford Act incidents) to accomplish the ESF
mission.
Figure 11.3 Federally Recognized ESFs
11.15 Incident Response Process. The typical incident response begins with first responders at
the local level. If the response proceeds to the federal level, including a Presidential major disaster
or emergency declaration, DOD forces may be deployed to support civilian efforts.
11.16 Local/First Tier Response. Local response is the first tier in the incident management
process, and it is local responders who will make the determination for expanding response. First
responders are local emergency and public works personnel who respond to an incident. From this
group, generally the most experienced responder will take command as the IC. They will remain
as the IC until voluntarily giving up command or replaced by a more qualified individual.
11.17 County and Regional/Second and Third Tier Response. If first responders are unable to
contain an incident, they may ask for assistance from the county emergency managers located at
the EOC. The EOC, if activated, maintains a current operating picture and communications
capability with internal and external resources. Thus, the EOC is able to leverage assets from
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
11-9
throughout the county to respond to the incident. The EOC can also support resource management
decision making when the incident exceeds existing resources and a request for additional
assistance is required. However, the county or regional emergency manager, city mayor, or county
executive must validate all such requests.
11.18 Tribal Governments. The United States recognizes the right of Native American tribes to
self-govern. Tribal governments are responsible for coordinating resources to address actual or
potential incidents. When local resources are not adequate, tribal leaders seek assistance from the
state or federal government. The tribe can elect to deal directly with the federal government.
Although a state governor must request a Presidential declaration under the Stafford Act on behalf
of a tribe, federal departments or agencies can work directly with the tribe within the existing
authorities and resources.
11.19 State/Fourth Tier Response. Every state maintains an EOC activated as needed to support
local EOCs and provide multi-agency coordination. When local jurisdictions cannot contain an
incident, the governor can declare a state of emergency and invoke the state’s emergency plan to
augment individual and public resources as required. Under the Stafford Act, states are also
responsible for requesting federal emergency assistance for community governments within their
jurisdiction.
11.19.1 State Coordinating Officer. The SCO plays a critical role in managing state
response and recovery operation. As an incident escalates, the SCO will work with the Federal
coordinating officer (FCO) to formulate state requirements, including those that are beyond
state capability.
11.19.2 Resource Request. Should requirements exceed state response capabilities, the
governor can use Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) agreements to
request resources from other states. If requested resources are unavailable or requirements
exceed capabilities, the governor may request federal assistance. When an event causes
damage, or is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant federal disaster assistance and
such assistance is requested, the President may issue a major disaster or emergency
declaration. If either declaration is issued, assistance is then made available under the Stafford
Act.
11.20 DOD Response. DOD provides support when requested by civil authorities and approved
by the SecDef. There are a few specific exceptions when DOD resources may be provided without
SecDef approval. These are immediate response authority (IRA), mutual aid agreements, or in
accordance with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) DSCA EXORD. Except for
immediate response and emergency authority discussed below, DOD provides DSCA when
requested by civil authorities and approved by the SecDef.
11.20.1 IRA. DOD response at the municipal, county, or tribal level is provided under IRA. If
requested by appropriate authority, under imminently serious conditions and if time does not
permit approval from higher authority, any commander can provide resources under their
control, and subject to any supplemental direction from higher headquarters, to save lives,
prevent human suffering, and mitigate great property damage. The civil authority’s request for
IRA should be directed to the installation commander or other appropriate DoD official
responsible for the installation.
11-10
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
11.20.1.1 Initiation. A request for assistance from civil authority (e.g., tribal authority,
mayor, chief of police, fire chief, sheriff, chief of emergency management) is required to
initiate the IRA. This request may initially be made verbally; however, for mission
assignment (MA) tracking and funding purposes, a follow-up in writing is desired.
11.20.1.2 Execution. The DSCA EXORD directs commanders to notify Service
headquarters of IRA operations. Time for notification is Service-specific; the Army and
Navy direct notification take place within 2 hours. Title 10 commanders should also notify
the DCO for their FEMA region. The DCO may be able to assist in obtaining
reimbursement for support provided by local and state officials, as well as reimbursement
under the Stafford Act or Economy Act. Of note, IRA does not permit actions that would
subject civilians to the use of military power that is regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive,
or compulsory.
11.20.1.3 Application. DOD immediate response authority does not apply to National
Guard forces in state active duty (SAD) status. National Guard forces in SAD receive their
authority to conduct immediate response from state law.
11.20.2 Mutual Aid Agreement. Mutual aid agreements authorized under Department of
Defense Instruction (DODI) 6055.06, DOD Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES) Program
are limited to emergency fire, medical, hazardous materials, and rescue services. Emergency
services are often provided on a reimbursable basis by fire and emergency services (F&ES)
personnel and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel who are collocated in the
installation fire department. In the absence of an agreement, the same four types of assistance
may be provided when the commander deems such assistance is in the best interest of the
United States and under immediate response authority of DODD 3025.18.
11.20.3 DSCA EXORD. The CJCS DSCA EXORD sets the framework for resources and
authorities provided to the supported combatant commander to conduct DSCA operations for
actual or potential domestic incidents within the combatant commander’s area of
responsibility. The authorities granted by the EXORD are specified in four distinct categories
of authorization:
• Assigned forces.
• Preidentified resources.
• Resources for internal use.
• Large-scale response categories.
11.21 State Military Response. The National Guard is the first line of military response to most
incidents. When the governor of a state mobilizes the National Guard, the forces are typically in
SAD status under command and control of the governor. SAD forces conduct all missions in
accordance with the needs of the state and within the guidelines of state laws and statutes.
11.21.1 Reimbursement. A governor may request reimbursement from the federal
government to resource pay and costs associated with state call-up of the National Guard to
support an emergency. This money may be provided by the primary federal agency providing
support, such as FEMA. The governor may also request federal funding from the SecDef
under Title 32 USC. Regardless of the funding source, either state or federal, National Guard
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
11-11
forces remain under command of their respective governor so long as they remain in Title 32
status.
11.21.2 Joint Force Headquarters-State. Each state has a joint force headquarters
(JFHQ-State) that provides command and control of all Army and Air National Guard forces
and state militia. The JFHQ-State serves as the focal point for all National Guard domestic
operations within each state. When National Guard forces conduct domestic operations
support in Title 32 or SAD, JFHQ-States have the capability to serve as operational
headquarters.
11.21.3 Joint Task Force-State. Each JFHQ-State may stand up one or more JTFs in support
of internal and external missions and taskers. JTFs may be established in parallel with a Title
10 JTF or in a dual status command integrating Title 10 and National Guard forces.
11.21.4 State Defense Forces. In addition to the National Guard, 24 states authorize a state
defense force as allowed by Title 32, United States Code (USC), Section 109, Maintenance of
Other Troops. These forces may be used to augment the state National Guard and other civil
authorities in an emergency. State defense forces are strictly state entities and are not part of
DOD. These voluntary forces are typically trained in specialized fields such as law,
administration, military police, communication, aviation support, SAR, logistics, medicine, or
transportation. State defense force members are authorized to wear the military uniform
assigned by the adjutant general (TAG) of the state. They are subject to the state’s military
code and during an emergency, receive pay according to state law.
11.22 Emergency Management Assistance Compact. The EMAC is administered by the
National Emergency Management Association located in Lexington, Kentucky. It is a
non-binding, collaborative arrangement among its members to provide a legal framework for
states to assist one another in managing a disaster or an emergency that has been declared by the
governor of the impacted state. All states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the
Virgin Islands are members of EMAC. During actual or potential widespread disasters that affect
multiple states, EMACs may become exhausted more quickly, requiring a more urgent request for
federal response.
11.22.1 Supplemental Agreements. Supplemental agreements are executed between states
when an event occurs. These agreements provide the specific details as to the type of support
each assisting state will provide and the amount of reimbursement the impacted state will pay
to each assisting state. When National Guard forces are needed, National Guard personnel sent
by one state to another state are in a SAD status unless Title 32 status is approved by the
SecDef. EMAC does not allow the use of armed National Guard forces from one state to
perform civil disturbance or other law enforcement operations in another state. If this type of
support is required, it must be approved between states in a separate mutual aid agreement.
11.23 Federal Response. Following a natural disaster, the POTUS may sign a Stafford Act
declaration directing federal resources (funding, agencies, and personnel) to provide assistance to
a state. The declaration may be requested prior to predicted incidents such as a hurricane, or after
acute incidents such as an earthquake.
11-12
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
11.23.1 Title 32. Title 32 forces are assets under the direction of the state governor. However,
they may be sourced to support federal requirements under the Stafford Act and Economy Act,
when approved by the SecDef.
11.23.2 Presidential Disaster Declaration (Civil Authority). The steps for a Presidential
disaster declaration are as follows:
Step 1: FEMA/federal and state representatives complete a preliminary damage
assessment (PDA).
• Documents the impact of the event and estimates initial damage.
• Establishes a foundation for the governor to request assistance.
• Provides background for FEMA’s analysis of the request.
Step 2: The governor requests assistance. The governor’s request, by law, must:
• State that the governor has taken appropriate action and directed execution of the
State Emergency Operations Plan.
• Certify that the incident is of such severity and magnitude that state and local
resources are inadequate.
• Include a damage estimate.
• Describe the state and local resources committed to response and recovery.
• Describe the requested assistance and agree to cost-sharing provisions.
Step 3: FEMA reviews the request and makes a recommendation.
• Governor’s request addressed to the POTUS through FEMA regional administrator.
• FEMA regional office completed analysis of request and recommendation.
• FEMA headquarters review of request to ensure compliance with Stafford Act
requirements.
• FEMA administrator recommendation of a course of action to the POTUS.
Step 4: The POTUS makes a major disaster or emergency declaration, if warranted.
• POTUS decides whether to declare that major disaster or emergency exists.
• If declaration is issued, assistance is made available under the Stafford Act.
• FCO is designated to oversee disaster operations.
11.24 Natural Disaster Response (Federal Military). DOD will normally respond to a natural
disaster when local and state resources have been exhausted or the incident/situation is projected
to overwhelm local, tribal, or state capability and/or resources. DOD response to an incident may
come through a variety of authorizations, including IRA, mutual aid agreement, or
SecDef/designee’s approval of a request for assistance (RFA) under the Stafford Act or the
Economy Act.
11.24.1 Command and Control. Title 10 forces are federal assets under the command of the
President. Title 10 forces include the Active Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and the
Reserves of each, as well as National Guard units ordered to federal active duty by the POTUS
or Service Secretary.
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
11-13
11.24.1.1 Regional Planning Agents. Combatant commands serve as DOD’s regional
planning agents. The Service components of combatant commands may serve as the
JFACC, joint force land component commander (JFLCC), or joint force maritime
component commander (JFMCC) in a DSCA environment.
11.24.2 United States Northern Command. In the United States Northern Command
(USNORTHCOM) AOR, the DCO is under command and control of United States Army
North (USARNORTH)/JFLCC. The initial JFC staff may consist of the DCO, defense
coordinating element (DCE), allocated Service emergency preparedness liaison officers
(EPLO), and a USARNORTH augmentation team.
11.24.2.1 To facilitate emergency responses, 1st Air Force (Air Force North
[AFNORTH]) typically acts as USNORTHCOM’s JFACC.
11.24.2.2 United States Fleet Forces (USFF) Command is designated as the naval
component commander for the USNORTHCOM. Additionally, the commander, USFF is
normally designated as the JFMCC to the USNORTHCOM.
11.24.3 United States Pacific Command. Joint Task Force-Homeland Defense (JTF-HD) is
the DOD’s executive agent for United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) to synchronize
incident management in support of civilian authorities within the joint operations area (JOA)
that encompasses Hawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and
American Samoa.
11.24.4 Defense Coordinating Officer. The DCO, a Title 10 active duty officer, is assigned
to each FEMA region and may work at the RRCC, at the FEMA regional office, or may
predeploy to an incident command site. A DCO will generally be involved in DOD’s response
to DSCA and may become the JFC with command and control of Title 10 forces. If federal
military forces deploy, the DCO will normally deploy to the JFO location. The DCO
coordinates DOD support to the PA. AMLOs should make contact with the DCO and the DCE
early in a DSCA operation as there will be opportunities for mutual assistance. Figure 11.4,
Typical DCE Organization shows the typical DCO organization structure.
11.24.4.1 Specific responsibilities of the DCO (subject to modification based on the
situation) include:
• Subject matter expertise for all state and federal emergency response plans.
• Coordinating with FEMA staff, state emergency responders, TAGs, and JFHQ-State
staff.
• Coordinating with the FCO and PAs for ESFs.
• Assigning military liaisons as appropriate.
• Coordinating with all military installations regarding BSI operations.
11.24.5 Defense Coordinating Element. The DCO has a DCE of ten permanent core staff
and military liaison officers to facilitate coordination and support to activated ESFs. See
Figure 11.4 and Figure 11.5, Augmented DCE Organization. DCO/DCE responsibilities
include:
• Representing DOD in the disaster area.
11-14
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
• Providing liaison to state, local, and other federal agencies.
• Reviewing/recommending validation of RFAs/MAs.
• Recommending the best military resource for the mission.
• Providing support of deployed DOD forces.

provide situational awareness on emergence mobility requirements for a DSCA operation.
EPLOs are Service reservists performing duties under DODI 3025.16, Defense Emergency
Preparedness Liaison Officer (EPLO) Programs. When sourced and allocated via the global
force management process, EPLOs are under OPCON of the Service component commander,
allocated to commander USNORTHCOM or commander USPACOM, and tactical control
(TACON) to the DCO. Responsibilities of EPLOs include the following:
• Establish initial communication and coordination links between DOD and civil
authorities at the regional, state, and local levels.
• Assist DOD forces in establishing connections with appropriate local civil authorities.
• Conduct pre-emergency coordination with military and civilian leaders within their
region or state.
• Maintain effective communication between the DOD components and other state and/or
federal governmental agencies.
• Promote mutual understanding among various organizations tasked with providing
support in civil emergency situations.
• Coordinate and establish relationships between the National Guard and DOD federal
forces.
• Represents DOD federal forces in coordinating with civil authorities at the state and
regional level.

11.24.6.1 Regional Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officer (REPLO). REPLOs are Title
10 Service Reserve personnel assigned to the FEMA regions.
11.24.6.2 State Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officer (SEPLO). SEPLOs are Title 10
Reserve personnel who perform duty in the state EOC. As subject matter experts in their
states, they serve as DOD liaisons for DSCA to state and federal agencies and maintain
situational awareness within the state. On a daily basis, they build relationships to facilitate
mission accomplishment.
11.24.7 Request for Assistance (RFA)/Mission Assignment (MA) Process. Title 10 forces
cannot support DSCA operations until an MA is approved. Understanding how MAs work will
provide AMLOs situational awareness for potential force moves. FEMA coordinates the
federal response to a disaster and will issue an RFA/MA to other federal agencies. RFAs/MAs
can also be initiated by states and/or agencies through the Executive Directorate at the
Pentagon.
11.24.7.1 DSCA requests originating at the JFO are coordinated with and processed
through the DCO. The DCO coordinates with state emergency managers, the state
National Guard, and FEMA to assist in the preparation and review of suitability for DOD
to perform an RFA/MA. The DCO then forwards suitable RFAs/MAs to USNORTHCOM
or USPACOM for validation. The combatant commander may approve the RFA/MA using
assigned forces or with the authorities provided in the CJCS Standing DSCA EXORD. If
the RFA/MA cannot be satisfied by the combatant command, it can be submitted to the
joint director of military support (JDOMS) for staffing through the request for forces
(RFF) process and SecDef approval.
11.24.7.2 Once the SecDef approves the MA and signs an EXORD or deployment order
(DEPORD), the JDOMS passes the order to force providers for sourcing. On order, the
DCO may be called upon to execute OPCON or TACON of Title 10 forces designated to
support the incident if the incident has not escalated to the point where additional
command structure is necessary for sourcing and tasking.
11.24.7.3 Prescripted Mission Assignment (PSMA). PSMAs are developed to facilitate
rapid response and standardize MA’s. MAs and their associated estimated costs serve as a
general guideline. If needed, PSMAs can be revised to fit requests.
11.24.7.4 Mission Assignment Tasking Order (MATO). MATOs are generally used to
provide specifics for a broad statement of work (e.g., delivery sites for water). MATOs
prevent the issuance of multiple MAs for the same statement of work. A task order will be
prepared to direct specific activities within the scope of a mission assignment. Task orders
may include personnel, resource movement, and locations for delivery and duty stations.
They are the tactical equivalent of the FRAGORD where follow on orders/instructions are
issued from an original base order (previously existing document that directs an overall
action).
11.24.8 Title 10 Joint Task Force. Based on the complexity and type of incident and the
anticipated level of DOD resources involved, DOD may elect to designate a JTF to command
all Title 10 military forces in support of the incident. Close coordination between federal
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
11-17
military other DOD entities such as the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and
National Guard forces is critical. USNORTHCOM’s standing joint task forces are:
• JTF-Alaska—Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska.
• JTF-Civil Support—Fort Monroe, Virginia.
• JTF-North—Biggs Army Airfield, Fort Bliss, Texas.
11.24.9 Title 10 Military Forces. Military units in a Title 10 status are under federal
command and control and are usually OPCON to USNORTHCOM/USPACOM. Upon arrival,
units are TACON to the JTF or JFC. Once deployed, they receive MAs from the JTF
commander or JFC. AMLOs fall under Title 10 forces.
11.24.10 Dual Status Command. Dual status command allows a designated National Guard
or federal military officer to command military personnel serving in a SAD, Title 32, or Title
10 status. Approval of a dual status commander requires the consent of the governor and
approval of the POTUS. The dual status commander receives orders from both the federal
chain-of-command (i.e., POTUS) and the state chain-of-command (i.e., governor). Dual status
is most frequently used during national special security events (NSSE). See Figure 11.6, Dual
Status Command.
Figure 11.6 Dual Status Command
11.24.11 Release from Mission Assignment and Redeployment. As the incident recovery
process begins, military assets will be released once MAs are completed. This decision is
made in coordination with the DCO/JFC for Title 10 units, or JFHQ-State/JTF-State for Title
32 units.

11.24.12 Other Entities Operating in a DSCA Environment. Any of the following
agencies may also be operating in the DSCA area of responsibility.
11.24.12.1 United States Army Corps of Engineers. The USACE has authority for flood
control and coastal emergencies under its Title 33 role and is the PA supporting ESF 3,
Public Works and Engineering, as seen in Figure 11.3. USACE is responsible for
providing infrastructure protection and emergency repair support to assist in needs related
to reconnaissance and emergency clearance of debris from damaged areas (route
clearance).
11.24.12.2 Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The DLA is the largest logistics support
agency of DOD. DLA provides worldwide logistics support to the military Services, as
well as several civilian agencies and foreign countries.
11.24.12.3 National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. The National Geospatial Intelligence
Agency is the support agency of DOD in the areas of imagery, intelligence, and geospatial
information. The USG relies on this agency for coherent management of the disciplines of
imagery and mapping.
11.24.12.4 Civil Air Patrol (CAP). When CAP is tasked by the USAF, in an Air Force
auxiliary (AFAUX) role, can perform reconnaissance, emergency services, homeland
security, and disaster relief missions.
11.24.12.5 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO). NGOs are officially designated as
support elements to national response capabilities. The American Red Cross (ARC) is a
supporting agency to mass care functions of ESF 6, Mass Care, Emergency Assistance,
Housing, and Human Services as seen in Figure 11.3. While it does not direct other NGOs,
ARC takes the lead in integrating efforts of national NGOs that provide mass care services
during response operations.
11.24.12.6 National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster. National Voluntary
Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) is a consortium of approximately 50 national
organizations and 55 state and territory equivalents. Through NVOAD, organizations
share knowledge and resources to help disaster survivors and their communities. NVOAD
typically sends representatives to the DHS/FEMA National Response Coordination Center
(NRCC) to represent the voluntary organizations and assist in response coordination.
11.25 DSCA Planning Considerations. AMLOs can use the joint planning process (JPP) as
outlined in JP 5-0 and this publication as a guide for preparing for operating in a DSCA
environment. AMLOs should expect rapid mobilization when supporting a DSCA operation.
Disaster can happen unexpectedly, leaving responding forces little time to plan and prepare. While
every response to a disaster is unique, below are some basic considerations for AMLOs deploying
to support a DSCA operation.
11.25.1 Predeployment.
11.25.1.1 Plan for austere living conditions. AMLOs may deploy in disaster-stricken areas
where there may not be electrical power, running water, or available food.
11.25.1.2 Plan for poor communications. Phone lines and cell phone towers may be
unusable. An iridium satellite phone, portable radios, and solar chargers should be part of
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
11-19
the AMLO’s deployment gear for DSCA events. Have a plan to check in with your chain
of command on a prescheduled basis. Likewise, a DAGR or other authorized stand-alone
GPS is highly recommended since cell phones may not provide accurate map or location
information when cell phone towers are inoperable.
11.25.1.3 Expect to work both in the field and on a joint staff. Early in a DSCA operation
the status and capabilities of an airfield are important pieces of information that
responding forces need so that they can plan force flow into the operating area. An AMLO
may be the first person to an airfield who can provide that information. Likewise, AMLOs
will advise and assist joint staff leadership in charge of Title 10 forces regarding air
mobility matters.
11.25.1.4 Make contact with DIRMOBFOR for the operation. Normally for DSCA events
a Deputy DIRMOBFOR is designated to augment USAFNORTH, and that person is who
AMLOs will work with on a regular basis.
11.25.1.5 If not specified what equipment to bring when tasked to support a DSCA
operation, AMLOs should contact AMC/A3 and/or DIRMOBFOR for guidance prior to
deploying. Each DSCA event will be unique and may require different equipment
depending on the nature of the situation. Consider whether to bring LZ/DZ kits, light kits,
DCP, iridium phones, GPS.
11.25.2 After Arrival. :
11.25.2.1 If required, assess airfields and provide updates to DIRMOBFOR. There may
be additional agencies attempting to assess airfields after a disaster. If so, coordinate to
synchronize those efforts.
11.25.2.2 Make contact with applicable SAA/airfield management.
11.25.2.3 Make contact with FEMA air operations representatives. FEMA is in charge of
what deploys into a relief operation, and it will be invaluable to synchronize air mobility
efforts with them.
11.25.2.4 Make contact with sister Service LNOs. Expect LNOs from each branch of the
service to be involved in a DSCA event.
11.25.2.5 Make contact with state and other Title 32 air mobility planners. Understanding
their current and future operations may allow you to identify potential shortfalls that would
Equipment Considerations from Hurricane Maria
AMLO tasked to support Hurricane Maria operations in September 2017 were given the 
following tasks in their vocal orders (VOCO) to deploy: “Report to 601st Air Mobility Division 
(AMD), embed with AFNORTH joint air component coordination elements (JACCE) in Saint 
Croix, Saint Thomas, and Puerto Rico; keep AMC/A3 informed, and provide eyes-on for 
director of mobility forces (DIRMOBFOR).”
Anticipating a requirement for landing zone (LZ) operations and lack of island communications, 
AMLOs departed with LZ kits, light kits, and iridium phones. LZ and light kits were not needed, 
but they were prepared for that possibility.
11-20
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
require Title 10 air mobility assets. Likewise, synchronizing air operations with them will
provide situational awareness to joint leadership.
11.25.2.6 Request access to force flow information. Expect Title 10 force flow data to be
distributed by NORTHCOM service component JOPES personnel (e.g. ARNORTH/A-3
JOPES). Also, NORTHCOM-Northern Command Deployment and Distribution
Operations Cell (NDDOC) will have FEMA mission schedules. And you will need to link
in with appropriate state or other Title 32 representatives to get their force flow
information.
11.25.2.7 Become familiar with agencies and their POCs within the JFO. There may be
opportunities for mutual assistance between agencies we normally would not work with.
11.25.2.8 Make contact with redeployment planning teams and plan to be part of their
efforts.
11.25.2.9 Be prepared to be involved in planning for aeromedical evacuation, general
population evacuation, and airspace coordination for rotary-wing SAR.
Hurricane Harvey
Title 10 air mobility support for Hurricane Harvey response in August 2017 was primarily for 
aeromedical evacuation. Title 32 Air National Guard (ANG) units handled a sizable evacuation 
of civilians from around the Houston area. AMLOs should be ready to assist Title 10 forces if 
given that task.

many of the planning considerations listed above can be used in preparing for an AMLO
deployment to support those operations.
Support to SOUTHCOM for Hurricane Maria
In addition to the six AMLOs who deployed to support Hurricane Maria relief efforts in Puerto 
Rico and the US Virgin Islands, another AMLO deployed to support efforts at other Caribbean 
islands in the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) AOR. His preparation for 
the deployment and tasks he accomplished while deployed were very similar to what the VIPR 
AMLOs did with the only discernible differences being the agencies he worked with.

CHAPTER 12
CH12 EVACUATIONS
EVACUATIONS
12.1 Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO). As used by the DOS, a NEO is an ordered
departure from a threatened area abroad. The NEO is carried out with the assistance of the DOD,
as opposed to ordered departures that do not require DOD assistance, but are carried out using
commercial or chartered transportation. The DOS may declare a NEO based on the nature of the
threat or the lack of availability of alternative forms of transportation. For further information
refer to JP 3-68, Noncombatant Evacuation Operations.
12.2 Noncombatants. Noncombatants are (1) US citizens who may be ordered to evacuate by
competent authority, and who are civilian employees of all agencies of the US government and
their dependents, excepting dependents who are residents in the country concerned of their own
volition; military personnel of the Armed Forces of the US specifically designated for evacuation
as noncombatants; and dependents of members of the Armed Forces of the US; (2) US citizens
and non-US citizens who may be authorized or assisted to evacuate by competent authority, and
who are civilian employees of US government agencies and their dependents who are residents in
the country concerned of their own volition, but express the willingness to be evacuated; private
US citizens and their dependents; military personnel of the Armed Forces of the US and their
dependents; and designated personnel, including dependents of persons ordered to evacuate, as
prescribed by the DOS.
NOTE: Private US citizens cannot be ordered to evacuate.
12.3 Department of State. DOS possesses several levers to execute evacuations, dependent on
the situation.
12.3.1 Authorized Departure. A voluntary departure of command-sponsored military
dependents, nonessential DOD civilian employees and their families, families of essential
DOD civilian employees, and DOD dependents schools staff and faculty to an announced safe
haven encouraged and authorized at government expense, with return also at government
expense. These government authorized expenses do not apply to local US citizens who do not
have service agreements for return transportation to the US at government expense.
12.3.2 Ordered Departure. A mandatory departure of some or all categories of personnel
and dependents (such as military dependents, nonessential DOD civilian employees and their
families, families of essential DOD civilian employees, and DOD dependents schools staff
and faculty) to designated safe havens directed by DOS, with implementation of the theater
evacuation plan. Historically, DOS accomplishes most ordered evacuations using commercial
transportation (scheduled or chartered), without the use of military personnel or assistance.
However, DOS may request a DOD-assisted NEO (e.g., using DOD organic or chartered
transportation assets) based on the nature of the threat, or the lack of availability of alternative
forms of transportation.
12.4 Operational Environments. There are three environments in a NEO: permissive, uncertain,
and hostile. To successfully complete the evacuation, it is necessary to understand these
operational environment considerations: political, military, economic, social, information, and
infrastructure (PMESII). Alternative mission plans should be developed for permissive, uncertain,
and hostile environments.
12-2
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
12.4.1 Permissive. In a permissive environment, there is no apparent physical threat to
evacuees; the political environment is stable. The host government is either in support of, or
will not oppose, the orderly departure of evacuees. If military assistance is required, it is
generally limited to support and security functions, such as additional transportation assets or
military police for security functions. This type of operating environment often occurs in
connection with serious natural or man-made disasters. An example of this type of
environment occurred in 1991 with Operation FIERY VIGIL. Following the Mount Pinatubo
eruption in the Philippines, military personnel and their dependents were evacuated from
Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Station. While not popular with the local
population, this evacuation was unopposed and took place in a permissive environment.
12.4.2 Uncertain. In an uncertain environment, the degree of danger is not known. The host
government may or may not be in control, but cannot ensure the safety of US citizens. Possible
opposition may come from the HN government, an opposition force, outside force, or all three.
Due to the uncertainty, the military commander may elect to reinforce the evacuation force
with additional security. An example of this type of environment occurred in 1991 with
Operation EASTERN EXIT. US citizens were evacuated from Somalia because the civil war
had escalated to the point of the Somali government collapsing and no longer being able to
guarantee their safety. Military dependents departed Turkey in 2016 due to an uncertain
political and military environment.
12.4.3 Hostile. In a hostile environment the host government, or other forces, are expected to
oppose evacuation and US military assistance. Forced entry by the US military, into the AO,
may be required to secure some evacuees; follow-on combat operations may be required. In
this environment, the focus may shift from evacuation to retrograde combat operations.
Because all commanders must be prepared to deal with large numbers of displaced civilians
and noncombatants, the presence of civil affairs assets is critical. An example of this type of
environment occurred in 1975 with the evacuation of the US Embassy in Saigon, Vietnam.
12.5 Operational Planning. AMLOs should participate in planning at the operational level. This
is especially important for AMLOs stationed overseas. Preparation for NEO is critical and
requires consideration of all phases of the evacuation operation. AMLOs can assist planning teams
in determining airlift requirements and capabilities and can also provide unique solutions to
difficult problems. AMLOs stationed overseas should be familiar with the installation/theater
NEO plan and make every effort to participate in NEO exercises. In addition, every AMLO should
be familiar with locations already identified as safe havens.
12.6 Exercise Support. Overseas commands routinely exercise NEO scenarios and AMLOs
should engage at every level of exercise planning and execution. Exercises range from staff-only
tabletop exercises (TTX), to an actual flight of volunteer noncombatant evacuees (NCE) from the
HN to a temporary safe haven. For example, United States Forces, Korea (USFK) annually
conducts FOCUSED PASSAGE to ensure NEO readiness of eligible personnel living in South
Korea.
12.7 Air Support Coordinator (ASC). The primary point of contact for AMLOs supporting
NEO operations is the air support coordinator. The AMLO could serve as the ASC during the
initial phases of a NEO. The ASC is part of the evacuation site party. The evacuation site party
identifies, and where possible, establishes the assembly areas, evacuation sites, and the evacuation
AFTTP 3-4.13V1, 1 March 2019
12-3
control center (ECC) site. When the evacuation force enters the country and the evacuation
commences, the evacuation site party becomes the operations center and/or section of the ECC.
12.7.1 ASC Responsibilities. The ASC is responsible for all aspects of aircraft, passengers,
cargo movement, aircraft support, aircraft configuration and capabilities, MOG determination,
airfield operations (e.g., parking, fuel, upload/download of cargo/passengers/forces), LZ and
DZ operations, crew rest cycles, and mission planning. AMLOs will be a critical link to the
ASC during the initial stages of NEO.
12.7.2 AMLO Responsibilities.
• Coordinate with the DIRMOBFOR, if applicable.
• Maintain direct lines of communication with applicable AOCs (especially the AMD)
and track inbound strategic airlift (STRATLIFT).
• Provide real-time reports of the situation for mission planning, crew situational
awareness, and risk assessment.
• Brief mobility aircraft (e.g., C-5, C-17, C-130, KC-10, KC-135) capabilities to NEO
mission planners.
• Assist in coordination and or provide guidance of aircraft support, such as sequence,
parking deconfliction, fuel, MHE, and configuration.
• Assist/coordinate/complete drop zone surveys.
• Provide assessments for landing zone and coordinate for surveys if one is needed.
• NEO during combat situations will require additional security planning, prioritization of
passengers, and considerations for 24 hour operations.
12.8 Support Intermediate Staging Base (ISB) Operations. The ISB is a temporary location
used to stage forces prior to HN insertion. The ISB may be located in another country, close to
where the evacuation is taking place, or may be any ship under US control. ISB operations may
include force sequencing, which is the phased introduction of forces into and out of the
operational area.
12.8.1 AMLO Responsibilities. Once ISBs are identified, AMLOs should assist the JFC
and/or ASC in determining ISB operational requirements. AMLOs should:
• Assist with suitability and capacity of the airfield and or port.
• Assist with LZ survey required.
• Assessment of facilities to store cargo or hold passengers.
• Contingency response force requirements.
• Aircraft maintenance facilities and refuel capabilities.
12.9 NEO Tracking System (NTS). The NTS is an automated data processing package designed
to assist JFCs in maintaining visibility and accountability of noncombatant evacuees as they
proceed through the evacuation pipeline. The NTS uses the paradigm of assigning a barcode to a
package and then tracking the package through to its delivery. NTS provides accountability of
evacuees by enabling operators to maintain a database of information (via bar code) for each
evacuee (to include pets) as they enter, proceed through, and finally exit the evacuation process at
a reception site or other exit point. With trained operators in a permissive environment, the NTS
12-4

(with five-registration stations) can process approximately 5,000 evacuees in approximately 50
hours. This estimate assumes the registration stations are operated continuously and around the
clock. See Figure 12.1, NEO Tracking System.

ATT2 DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION SYSTEMS
DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION SYSTEMS
A2.1 Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES). JOPES is the DOD’s
primary system for translating policy decisions into operational plans. JOPES feeds information
directly into the Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution System (DCAPES).
A2.1.1 Automated Data Processing (ADP). JOPES ADP helps planners build the force list
during force planning. Force planning begins when the combatant commander identifies the
major apportioned forces needed to support his concept of operations, and continues with the
identification of combat support and combat service support force requirements. Initially, for
gross planning estimates, notional (generic) units may be designated. As the process
continues, actual units must be identified.
A2.2 Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES). DCAPES
is the Air Force’s war planning system and provides an Air Force feed to JOPES ADP. The
objective of DCAPES is to enable improved and streamlined operations planning and execution
processes which include associated policy and procedures, along with organizational and
technology improvements. DCAPES provides standard data files, formats, application programs,
and management procedures that are Air Force unique and joint guidance compliant and used
primarily for force planning, sourcing equipment and personnel requirements, transportation
feasibility estimation, civil engineering support, and medical planning.
• DCAPES and JOPES share common business rules and ADP procedures and policies to
plan and execute joint military operations.
• Air Force planners at all levels will use DCAPES to support the combatant commander’s

A2.3 Logistics Module (LOGMOD). LOGMOD is a logistics-planning program that receives
and maintains the cargo and personnel details for UTCs and taskings. It maintains detailed cargo
records as well as personnel records (levy file positions and the personnel to fill them) and
provides a command and control capability through the LOGMOD schedule.
A2.3.1 Modules. LOGMOD is composed of two program modules, MAJCOM and base
level. The MAJCOM module contains three subsystems: logistics force packaging
(LOGFOR), logistics planning (LOGPLAN), and logistics feasibility analysis capability
(LOGFAC) system.
A2.3.2 LOGFOR. The LOGFOR subsystem provides the capability to create and maintain
the standard database of logistics supplies and equipment for each UTC in the Air Force. This
database is called the logistics detail (LOGDET).
A2.3.3 LOGPLAN. The LOGPLAN subsystem provides the capability to tailor or customize
the plan unique UTC database of equipment and supplies for each USAF operation or
contingency plan.
