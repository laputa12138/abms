CH1 INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION
Chaplain Corps Team,
On behalf of our Readiness Next initiative, this Contingency Religious Support Operations (CRSO)
Readiness Guide is intended to be a useful resource for you, our Total Force Chaplain Corps, as you
strive to take care of our Airmen, Guardians, and their families more than anyone thinks possible.
Our hope and desire is that this will be a relevant tool that you can use before, during, and following
a contingency operation, mobilization, crisis scenario, and/or deployment (in-place or apart from
home station). That said, we understand and affirm the reality summarized in the statement, “Culture
eats strategy for breakfast.” Therefore, while the information shared in the following guide
represents over two years of a working group’s efforts to collect data, subject matter expert feedback,
and boots on the ground wisdom, no amount of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) or strategy
can replace the culture of readiness we, as a Chaplain Corps, strive to embody. As we pivot away
from an air expeditionary force (AEF), deployment-focused posture to an always ready, Air Force
Force Generation Model (AFFORGEN), I believe we are making significant progress in our culture
and the following information is simply meant to inform and empower that shift. See Figure 1.1,
AFFORGEN Model.
Some of the information in the following pages represents updates from the 2008 Chaplain Corps
Deployment Guide; other guidance has been collected and created from across our community of
interest—from both Chaplains and Religious Affairs Airmen—and has been reviewed and validated
by senior religious support teams (RST) and Air Force line officers. You will notice that this guide is
largely shaped around the AFFORGEN model of employment and uses more joint language/
references than previous versions. Even with all these inputs and updates, we recognize that our
dynamic, near-peer operating environment is constantly shifting, and any guidance put to print can
quickly become obsolete. This is why I made the decision to place this CRSO Readiness Guide under
the domain of the United States Air Force (USAF) Expeditionary Center’s (EC) A9X TTP office,
which requires it to be updated and revalidated every 24 months. What this means for you, the end
user, is that if there is information missing, outdated, or incorrect in your view, we expect you to
share that feedback up your Chaplain Corps chain of command so that we can update the guide
accordingly and maintain its relevancy to your work and ministry. In that sense, this is a living
document that is both adaptable and accountable to our Total Force Chaplain Corps community.
The CRSO Readiness Guide does not replace any Air Force instruction (AFI), policy, and/or current
training requirements. Those remain in place and authoritative. This tool is simply intended to serve
as practical guidance, advice, and/or food for thought as you take care of our Total Force, their
families, and yourselves, more than anyone thinks possible.
V/r,

PREPARE
2.1. Prepare. Training towards peak readiness. Single mission and multi mission training events
and capstone certification exercises are conducted during this phase.
2.1.1. Individual Readiness and Training Requirements.
2.1.1.1. Family Care Plan. Required for service members who are: single parents;
dual-military couples with dependents; married with custody or joint custody of a child
whose non-custodial biological or adoptive parent is not the current spouse of the service
member; or who otherwise bear sole responsibility for the care of children under the age of
19; or for others unable to care for themselves in the absence of the military member. All
other Air Force members with dependent family members should have family care
arrangements that reasonably cover situations that require service members to be separated
from their families even if a formal Family Care Plan is not required. Refer to AF Form
357, Family Care Certification. For guidance, refer to Department of Defense Instruction
(DODI) 1342.19_AFI 36-2908, Family Care Plans.
2.1.1.2. Considerations. Consider long and short-term items when developing a family
care plan (e.g., providers and care provision details). See Table 2.1, Family Care Plan
Action Items.
Table 2.1. Family Care Plan Action Items
2.1.2. Individual Requirements. Individual requirements include mandatory items,
readiness training, deployment tasking requirements, other readiness items as required, and
Service member and designated caregiver should work together on the Family Care Plan to ensure it
includes all necessary information, such as:
• Child care guidance: expectations and schedules for child care, school, and extracurricular
activities.
• Medical care information: medications, allergies, and doctor’s appointments.
• Parenting responsibilities and challenges: guidance on food preferences, restrictions, bedtime,
discipline, religious observances and activities, social and leisure activities, safety precautions,
allowances and spending, and other issues.
• Contact information: phone numbers, emails, and addresses for friends and relatives, health
care and other service providers and military/community resources.
• Important documents: updated copies of wills, life insurance policies, birth certificates, and
beneficiary information; special power of attorney and/or agent letter of authorization as needed.
• Military identification cards: make sure each family member (10 or older) is registered in the
Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) and have current identification
cards.
• Finances: information on how family finances will be managed.
• Alternative caregiver: name and contact information of an alternate caregiver.
• Discussion: this plan should be communicated with child/children (if they are old enough).
Discuss religious/spiritual care.

Chapter 5
CH5 RESET
RESET
5.1. Reset Phase. This phase consists of two components—reintegration and reconstitution. The
primary focus is on resiliency. This phase includes basic unit training, upgrade training,
modernization, and/or depot maintenance.
5.1.1. Reintegration. Transition service members back into union with the larger whole (e.g.,
relationships, organizations, society).
5.1.2. Reconstitution. Rebuilding the member/group back to its original state and bringing
them into union with the internal self, (e.g., restoring one’s mind, body, soul, and spirit).
5.2. Planning the Reset Phase. Planning is crucial for this phase. A strategy should be designed
prior to redeployment that targets: (1) the unit as a whole; (2) unit members individually; and (3)
oneself. Purposeful attention must be given to reintegration and reconstitution for all three.
5.3. Reintegration.
5.3.1. Reintegration and Single Airmen. Points to consider for planning:
• Communication can ease the transition with family, friends, and roommates.
• It is not unusual for relationships to change following a deployment.
• Patience is required because reintegration can be challenging. Recognize and adapt to
change.
• Talk to someone about choices—do not make major decisions until settled in, especially
in regard to finances and relationships.
5.3.1.1. Questions to consider for planning:
• What kind of spiritual reset is needed?
• How have personal beliefs, virtues, and/or values been challenged by deployment
experiences?
• How are they in need of refreshing or reassessment?
• Have personal living arrangements changed?
• What has changed in personal relationships?
• What personal responses are needed to those changes?
• Are there relationships that need to be rebuilt purposefully?
• What personal support network is in place?
• Who can be spoken with specifically for help with reintegration?
• What is the financial plan regarding extra money made during deployment?
5.3.2. Reintegration with Spouses/Significant Others. Points to consider for planning:
• Communication can ease the transition with family and friends.
• A partner who remained home during a deployment is likely to have become more
independent in one’s absence. This is not unusual because people must often take on new
roles and responsibilities and may develop new expectations about the way things ought
to be in such circumstances. Simply said—the house rules may have changed.
 
 
5-2
AFTTP 3-4.52, 9 August 2023
 
• Changes may be noticed, not only in self, but also in one’s partner. Be flexible and open
to these changes.
• It is not unusual for one and/or one’s partner to experience mixed emotions after the
deployed member returns home.
• It is not unusual for a spouse/significant other that remained home to want help with
family maintenance. Consider how to provide help and how this might strengthen personal
reintegration. Be cautious with initiating any changes.
• Communication is crucial through the reintegration process. Communicate openly,
honestly and frequently. Avoid criticizing a partner; instead, approach each other as equals.
• Do not expect old problems to go away during a partners absence. Work together for
solutions, not who is to blame.
• Reestablishing intimacy may take time. Understand that sex and intimacy are two
different things. It is normal to go slow and take time to reconnect emotionally. Consider
how to best demonstrate patience with partner (or oneself).
5.3.2.1. Questions to consider for planning:
• What kind of spiritual reset is needed as a couple or individually?
• How have personal beliefs, virtues, and/or values been challenged by deployment
experiences? How are they in need of refreshing or reassessment? 
• What is the best way to discuss these challenges with one’s partner?
• What personal plans have been discussed with one’s partner for reset time (e.g., rest
and recuperation, vacation, family visits)?
• What would one’s partner say the best ways are for helping with home maintenance
(e.g., chores, help with the children, family routines)?
• If there are unresolved issues with one’s partner, how will they be addressed
together?
• What discussions have occurred about each partner’s expectations for sex and
intimacy?
• What is the financial plan for extra money made during deployment?
5.3.3. Reintegration and Parenting. Points to consider for planning:
• Be realistic. Be flexible. Be patient.
• Consider how one’s family will benefit most from member’s unique parenting role and
discipline during reintegration. Think about areas where going slowly and easing the
transition will be optimal for all family members.
• Be mindful of demands because of feelings of guilt.
• Use knowledge-based resources on child development. The Military and Family
Readiness Center (M&FRC) and other helping agencies have great resources.
• Spend one-on-one time with each child.
• Be generous with personal time and energy.
• Communicate.
 
AFTTP 3-4.52, 9 August 2023
5-3
 
 
• Changes can be difficult for children. They may feel out of control, so let them have
input.
• Expect that the member and spouse/significant other to be tired and desiring a break
from parenting duties. Discuss these issues openly and honestly.
• Children respond to reunion and reintegration in different ways. Emotions and responses
can vary from being ecstatic to being angry.
• Sometimes it can be helpful to be open about the deployment experience with children.
Be open to their questions and be willing to share, if appropriate.
5.3.3.1. Questions to consider for planning:
• What is the child’s personality and/or temperament? Is it different from the parents?
• How will personal reconnection be made with the children?
• What life issues have occurred with the children while away?
• How will the various emotional responses of the children be navigated?
• What has been discussed about the way discipline was handled by a partner/
children’s caregiver(s) during deployment? How will discipline be handled going
forward?
• Has time away changed one’s parenting approach? Has it changed a spouse/
significant other/caregiver’s approach?
5.3.4. Reintegration and the Work Environment. Points to consider for planning:
• Establish/reestablish good rapport with coworkers to foster optimal teamwork.
• Discuss work center changes with coworkers to optimize reintegration.
• Talk with colleagues, supervisors, and peers to better understand the rationale of changes
made.
• It is likely coworkers picked up additional responsibilities in member’s absence.
Because of this, do not be surprised if there is some resentment. Consider the best way to
re-assume personal responsibilities and show appreciation for coworker’s mission
contribution efforts.
• Be present, here and now—deployment was another time and place.
• Staff turnover—returning member and newcomers will have to get to know each other.
• Mixed emotions are normal. Recognize that heightened emotions may impact responses
to customers/coworkers, and may cause overreactions to minor issues.
• Communicate needs with leadership. Be open about emotions and resiliency, and work
with them to formulate a plan for reintegration.
5.3.4.1. Questions to consider for planning:
• What is the plan for returning to the work center and/or assigned units?
• How has the work center changed? How will returning member fit into the mission?
• Have responsibilities/requirements changed? How will returning member get caught
up to speed?
 
 
5-4
AFTTP 3-4.52, 9 August 2023
 
• How is the relationship with leadership/supervisor? How will they be engaged upon
return?
5.3.5. Reintegration and Community. Points to consider for planning:
• Plan time to purposefully reconnect with friends or engage in new social connections.
• Understand that others might not understand or have shared experiences.
• Understand that things may not pick up where they left off.
• Reconnect with community groups previously involved with (e.g., church, social clubs).
• Communicate experiences/feelings with others.
• It is okay to be open, honest, and vulnerable with trusted people.
5.3.5.1. Questions to consider for planning:
• What social networks were in place prior to deployment? Is there a plan to
re-establish those relationships?
• What community group roles (e.g., leadership or volunteer positions) did the
member participate in? Have those changed? How will one reintegrate into those?
• What expectations do social groups/friends have of the returning member?
5.4. Reconstitution.
5.4.1. Reconstitution and Self-Reflection. Points to consider for planning:
• Understand that people often undergo change because of their deployment experiences.
• Conduct a self-evaluation.
• Consider what is needed to be holistically healthy (i.e., physical, mental, social, and
spiritual).
• Give time to establish new norms; seek to establish healthy and edifying norms.
5.4.1.1. Questions to consider for planning:
• Have new hobbies or interests been developed? What avenues are available to
continue pursing them?
• What has changed with oneself? What (if anything) needs to change upon return?
• What is the plan to fortify one’s holistic health? How will physical, mental, and
spiritual fitness be purposefully strengthened?
• Are the needs for meaning, purpose, and values be connected with? What gaps
should be addressed?
5.4.2. Reconstitution and Stress. Points to consider for planning:
• Set aside time for self-care activities.
• Discuss stressors with loved ones, friends, or a professional (e.g., clergy, mental health).
• Develop or renew outside interests.
• Allow for space and time.
• Establish realistic expectations.
• Engage in positive thinking.

• Seek help.
• Establish new routines.
5.4.2.1. Questions to consider for planning:
• Where does spiritually fit? How have experiences informed or challenged one’s
beliefs, virtues, and/or values.
• What does life stress look like? What does it look like when becoming too stressed,
overburdened, or burnt out?
• What mechanisms are in place to manage stress (e.g., exercise, hobbies, prayer)?
How have these been tended to?
• Who can stress(ors) be discussed with? Who can help navigate the issues faced?
• Is there a healthy meal routine? Is there a healthy sleep routine?
5.4.3. Reconstitution and Helping Resources. Points to consider for planning:

• Moral injury.
• Holistic health: physical, mental, spiritual, social, and cognitive.
• Compassion fatigue.
• Sexual assault/harassment.
• Bullying/harassment.
5.4.3.1. Questions to consider for planning:
• What professional resources are available? Examples include: Chaplain, mental
health, medical, military and family life consultant (MFLC), M&FRC, sexual assault
prevention and response (SAPR), equal opportunity (EO), and the inspector general
(IG)?
• Are there any current issues that might warrant professional help? Who can one
speak with to resolve those issues?
• Have any traumatic events been experienced that need to be discussed?
• Has anything been witnessed/done that goes against personally held moral beliefs?
What has the impact been?
• What professional resources are available to help develop a physical fitness plan
(e.g., health and wellness center [HAWC], strength and conditioning coach)?
• If one is a Chaplain Corps member, who will be sought for spiritual counsel?
5.4.4. Reconstitution and Home-Station Requirements. Points to consider for planning:
• Complete all required post-deployment and processing checklists.
• Return issued equipment and/or supplies as required.
• Ensure all training is current (e.g., computer-based training [CBT], career field
education and training plan [CFETP]).
• Ensure individual medical readiness (IMR) requirements are met.
5.4.4.1. Questions to consider for planning:

CH6 CONTINGENCY AND EXPEDITIONARY OPERATIONS
CONTINGENCY AND EXPEDITIONARY OPERATIONS
“Consideration for operations ‘after the bang’”
6.1. HC Command and Control. Identify primary and alternate operational locations for RSTs
during contingencies. Always maintain and update personnel accountability. Develop a primary
and alternate communications plan (e.g., secure and non-secure phones, apps, computers, e-mail,
radios, runners). Communicate critical information up and down the chain-know the chain of
command (particularly in a joint environment). Refer to Joint Publication (JP) 5-0, Joint Planning.
6.1.1. Control Considerations. Administrative control (ADCON), tactical control
(TACON), operational control (OPCON) considerations in a joint environment.
6.1.1.1. Ensure the taking tasking agency has authority to do so (i.e., Does the
person/office fall within commander’s chain of command?).
6.1.1.2. Rank does not necessarily equal authority.
6.1.1.3. Maintain critical contact information document with locations for key and
essential personnel (for comm out).
6.1.1.4. Monitor chapel team’s ops tempo.
6.2. Noncombat and Peace Operations.
6.2.1. Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO). Refer to JP 3-68, Noncombatant
Evacuation Operations.
6.2.1.1. HC’s mission is to DOD personnel and their families.
6.2.1.2. Understand HC rules of engagement (ROE) regarding care for noncombatants.
Seek guidance from senior RST, judge advocate general (JAG), and commander before
offering or providing care.
6.2.1.3. Assess environment and confirm a Chaplain liaison role is appropriate with chain
of command. Refer to JG 1-05 III-6.2 (1).
6.2.2. Homeland Operations. Refer to JP 3-27, Homeland Defense.
6.2.2.1. Homeland Defense.
6.2.2.1.1. United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), United States
Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), and the North American Aerospace
Defense Command (NORAD), all have missions to ensure defense of the homeland.
6.2.2.1.1.1. Know the joint and coalition partners.
6.2.2.1.2. Reserve components primarily lead homeland defense operations.
6.2.2.1.2.1. Be mindful of the status (i.e., part-time or full-time) of assigned HC
personnel if Guard or Reserve.
6.2.2.2. Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). DOD assets support DSCA events,
which are led by civilian authorities (e.g., state, tribal, county). The DOD provides
support, it is not the lead. Refer to JP 3-28, Defense Support of Civil Authorities.
 
 
6-2
AFTTP 3-4.52, 9 August 2023
 
6.2.2.2.1. RSTs deploy during DSCA operations for the purpose of providing religious
support to authorized DOD personnel.
6.2.2.2.1.1. The Establishment Clause of the US Constitution and current DOD
legal guidance generally prohibit Chaplains from providing religious support to the
civilian population (other than in specific emergency situations).
6.2.2.2.1.2. RSTs will not normally provide religious support to persons
unaffiliated with DOD, absent explicit and unambiguous tasking from proper
authority.
6.2.2.2.2. Understand that National Guard Chaplain Corps members (Army and Air)
may be operating under different authority sets than Title 10. They may operate
differently.
6.2.2.2.3. Under Title 10, United States Code (USC), Armed Forces, HC may serve
civilians only if the four-pronged test is met. Refer to JG 1-05 III-5.1.2 (6).
6.2.2.2.3.1. The support must be individually and personally requested in an
emergency situation, where the need is immediate, unusual, and unplanned.
6.2.2.2.3.2. The requested support must be incapable of being reasonably rendered
by civilian clergy.
6.2.2.2.3.3. The support must be actually incidental—it incurs no additional
financial burden to the US Government and does not significantly detract from the
primary role of the RST.
6.2.2.2.3.4. The need must be acute. Acute needs are those which are of short
duration, prone to rapid deterioration, and in need of urgent and immediate care.
The necessary provision of last rites is the clearest but not the only example of such
needs.
6.2.2.3. Defense chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear response force (DCRF).
6.2.2.3.1. HC Should be embedded and properly trained, if assigned at time of
conflict, learn ROEs, ensuring understanding of zones where HC can and cannot
operate.
6.2.3. Community Relations. RSTs should be involved, but Chaplains should always be the
clear lead by virtue of specialized training.
6.2.3.1. May, at commander direction, act as religious leader liaison to provide key leader
engagement.
6.2.3.2. Do nothing that would jeopardize Chaplain’s non-combatant status—Chaplains
are not an intelligence officers/sources or negotiators.
6.2.3.2.1. Ensure the RA Airman’s combatant status does not jeopardize the
non-combatant status of the Chaplain during community relations operations.
6.2.3.3. Involvement in community relations may mitigate friction and improve relations
with civil components—but always work with the chain of command.

• Ensure compliance with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)
requirements.
• Know and react to alert signals.
6.4. Combat Stress and the Chaplain Corps.
6.4.1. Combat Stress. See Table 6.2, Tips for Dealing with Combat Stress.
6.4.1.1. Be aware that RSTs can face dual exposure to traumatic stress by exposure to
trauma and response to traumatized personnel.
6.4.1.2. The senior RST in the contingency environment is responsible to monitor the
chapel team’s wellbeing.
 
AFTTP 3-4.52, 9 August 2023
6-5
 
 
6.4.1.3. All team members are responsible for monitoring their own wellbeing and
communicate through the chain of command one’s need to process inputs that may impact
their ministry effectiveness for a specific period of time (i.e., HC Cares).
6.4.1.3.1. This may include formal mental health encounters or informal processing of
unique stressors with chapel peers or supervisors.
6.4.1.3.2. Subordinates should remember that their supervisors may not receive
privileged communication.
6.4.1.3.3. Maintain a positive mindset and spiritual fitness practices.
6.4.1.3.4. Practice self-care.
Table 6.2. Tips for Dealing with Combat Stress

• RSTs should be readily accessible.
• Practice active listening.
• Take concerns seriously.
• Provide a healthy and safe counseling environment where feelings and hurt can be
expressed.
• Bring normality to physical, emotional, social, and spiritual reactions to stressful
circumstances.
• Provide spiritual care (as appropriate).
6.5. Medical Operations. Could be in traditional or field hospital settings.
6.5.1. Medical Triage. Refer to AFTTP 3-42.32, Installation Medical All Hazards Response
(IMAHR). See Figure 6.1, Priorities.
• Immediate (Red)—treatable life-threatening conditions.

6.5.1.1.1.1. Note ministry performed on the back and sign it legibly.
• Build holistic health—even amid combat stress to the best of one’s ability (e.g., physical,
mental, spiritual, emotional, social, cognitive).
• Know one’s limits.
• Take appropriate time off based on mission requirements. Find a healthy battle rhythm that
meets mission demands but also maintains stamina to the end of the contingency and beyond.
• Maintain positivity and fortify spiritual practices.
• Practice what is encouraged—verbally process trauma and challenges.
 
 
6-6
AFTTP 3-4.52, 9 August 2023
 
Figure 6.1. Priorities
6.6. Prisoner of War (POW)/Detainee Operations. Refer to JP 3-63. Chaplains do not
generally provide direct religious support to detainees. Should a commander determine a
requirement, communication is privileged, to the extent provided by evidentiary privilege rules
and appropriate military department policies. RSTs must communicate so that a commander is
advised on well-being and humane treatment.
6.7. Personnel Recovery (PR). Refer to JP 3-50, Personnel Recovery.
6.7.0.1. Know and understand the role of the Chaplain in the reintegration of isolated
personnel (IP). Chaplains are the only member of the RST referenced in JP 3-50 for PR
and can be invited to participate in the reintegration phases 2 and 3 (detailed below).
6.7.0.2. Identify RSTs who has PR296 training (at a minimum) and familiarization with
the process, ROEs, and others. The reintegration phases are a carefully planned and
choreographed process that requires all possible participants to know their roles/lanes and
to stay within it.
6.7.0.3. Phases of Reintegration. Refer to JP 3-50, Section E.21.2.7.
6.7.0.3.1. Phase 1—The focus is on immediate medical triage and stabilization,
initiation of survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (SERE) psychologist support and
decompression, and collection of time-sensitive information.
6.7.0.3.2. Phase 2—Will be conducted at the theater designated facility where the
focus is decompression, structured debriefings, and necessary medical care.
Chaplain Priority

Minimal (green) – provide spiritual 
care as able. Follow-up if needed.
Expectant (black) – provide spiritual 
care immediately/without delay."
Immediate (red) – treatable 
life-threatening conditions.
  
Delayed (yellow) – treatment delayed 
without jeopardy to recovery.
Minimal (green) – minor medical

Expectant (black) – expected to die.
 
AFTTP 3-4.52, 9 August 2023
6-7
 
 
6.7.0.3.2.1. Chaplains provide and facilitate religious support to isolated
personnel. Religious support can be beneficial to the immediate spiritual, mental,
and psychological welfare of recovered/isolated personnel and contribute to their
successful long-term reintegration. In order to safeguard confidentiality, Chaplains
will not, at any time, participate in or conduct debriefings related to SERE or
intelligence.
6.7.0.3.3. Phase 3—Final phase of reintegration after the phase 2 team chief transfers
the reintegration mission to the phase III reintegration team chief of the appropriate
Service.
6.7.0.4. The RST can provide religious support/spiritual care of the IP throughout and
after the phases of reintegration.
6.8. Mortuary Affairs. Refer to DAFI 34-160, Mortuary Affairs Program, paragraph 2.25;
DODI 1300.29, Mortuary Affairs Program; and Department of the Air Force Handbook (DAFH)
34-102, Guide to Services Contingency Planning: Mortuary Affairs Search and Recovery for
search and recovery (SAR) involving human remains.
• Understand the difference between search and rescue and search and recovery.
• Search and rescue operations presume that the living may still be found.
• Search and recovery operations presume that the likelihood of survival/life is low.
• Before a crisis or casualty event occurs, integrate with the SAR and mortuary affairs
processes (if possible).
• Chaplain Corps credibility is enhanced when RSTs provide competent assistance in tactical
operations.
• Be aware, in a MASCAL event, the force support squadron (FSS) commander may pull
personnel from FSS and augmentees from other career fields to handle remains, with only
just-in-time training.
• Not all personnel involved are trained for mortuary work. Be cognizant of ministry
needs and opportunities of those tasked to assist (e.g., photographer, bio-environmental,
fire department, geospatial shop, security forces, safety).
• Do not assume trained and/or experienced personnel are unaffected by SAR-related
experiences.
• Take opportunities to both learn from and mentor mortuary personnel.
• Be mindful of the effects of exposure (i.e., sights, smells).
• Be aware of cultural and religious concerns relating to the handling of human remains.
• Maintain an openness to talk about experiences with the SAR and mortuary teams.
• Practice not only self-care, but display concern, and/or provide care as needed for other
personnel (to include RST partner). Ensure others are practicing self-care.
6.9. Ramp Ceremonies/Dignified Transfer. Ramp ceremonies and human remains movements
differ slightly at various locations. However, the key intent is to appropriately mark the loss of
fallen members. Honor is shown for the dead (regardless of the manner/cause of death) and
comfort and care is given to the living.
 
 
6-8
AFTTP 3-4.52, 9 August 2023
 
6.9.1. Role of the Chaplain. In ramp ceremonies and movements involving human remains,
the Chaplain serves as a reminder of the dignity of the fallen. Chaplains offer comfort and
counsel for the grieving and advise leaders and participants with the goal of ensuring
appropriate respect and honor for the fallen, throughout the process.
6.9.2. Sample Layout. See Figure 6.2, Sample Dignified Transfer Layout (Dover AFB).
Figure 6.2. Sample Dignified Transfer Layout (Dover AFB)
6.10. MASCAL Events. Address mass care concept, family assistance, local and remote safe
havens, use of civilian shelters, mass feeding, and bulk distribution. Refer to DAFI 10-2501,
Emergency Management Program for additional information.
6.10.1. Casualty Collection Point Actions.
6.10.1.1. Provide spiritual care as needed while being careful not to interfere with medical
procedures. If in doubt, ask a medical professional.
6.10.2. Prayers of Comfort. Provide prayers for the dying and those in need. See Chapter 7,
Quick Reference for specific denominational prayers. 
6.10.3. Memorial Service Considerations.
6.10.3.1. If requested by next of kin (NOK), Chaplains will provide support.
6.10.3.2. Civilian clergy may be a substitute.
6.10.3.3. See Chapter 7 for specific, faith-based considerations.
6.11. Incident Crisis Response.

Section II—Christianity
7.5. Roman Catholicism—Key Beliefs and Practices. Roman Catholic Sacraments are
ordinarily performed by Priests, Deacons, and other Church leaders, such as Bishops.
7.5.1. Religious Text. The Bible is the written Word of God, entrusted to the Church, which is
solely competent to interpret it authentically.
7.5.1.1. A Roman Catholic Bible includes books in the Old Testament that most Protestant
Bibles do not include in their canon. Collectively, these books are called the Apocrypha or
the Deutero-Canonicals.
7.5.2. Key Teachings/Practices. Roman Catholics believe in one God Who exists in
three-coeternal Persons—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
7.5.2.1. God the Father sent God the Son, later named Jesus, to earth to be born like us, to
teach us, and ultimately to die for our sins. After rising from the dead on Easter Sunday,
Jesus returned to Heaven and He and the Father sent the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles to
spread the faith. The Father and the Son continue to send the Holy Spirit upon us every day
through the seven sacraments.
7.5.2.2. Roman Catholics engage in daily/weekly prayer, reading of God’s Word,
confession, Mass, and receiving of the Eucharist (the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ).
7.6. Roman Catholicism—Essential Prayers.
7.6.1. Emergency Baptism. If a dying person wishes to be baptized when no priest or
Chaplain is available, any Christian may administer baptism. Pour water on the forehead three
times saying his/her name and these words: “I Baptize you in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.”
7.6.2. Prayers for the Dying. In the event no Roman Catholic Priest or Chaplain is available,
anyone may repeat with an individual/group the following when praying:
7.6.2.1. The Act of Contrition. “O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended You,
and I detest all my sins, because of Your just punishments, but most of all because they
offended You, my God, who art all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with
the help of Your grace, to sin no more, to do penance, and to avoid the near occasion of sin.
Amen.”
7.6.2.2. The Lord’s Prayer. “Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy
kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.”
7.6.2.3. The Hail Mary. “Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.”
7.6.2.4. The Glory Be. “Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as
it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.”
 
AFTTP 3-4.52, 9 August 2023
7-3
 
 
7.6.3. Death. In the event of death, the following prayer may be said. “Eternal rest grant unto
(him/her), O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon (him/her). May (his/her) soul and all the
souls of the faithful departed through the Mercy of God rest in peace. Amen.”
7.7. Roman Catholicism—Requirements After Death. Even after death, the body is to be
respected since it once housed the soul, and will do so again at the end of time, when God raises
up, from the dust and ashes, our bodily remains and recreates our bodies after the pattern of Jesus’
risen body.
7.7.1. Cremation. Cremation is allowed but the remains must be honored just as much as
non-cremated remains. Roman Catholics would never scatter someone’s ashes or store them in
an urn at home; they must be interred in blessed ground where they await the resurrection.
Burials at sea are allowed when preservation of the body would not be possible.

7.9. Eastern Orthodox—Key Beliefs and Practices. Orthodox churches continue the practices
of the Eastern Christian churches. They are often named after countries, cities, or the languages
used in their faith practice (e.g., Russian, Greek, Antiochian).

7.9.2.1. Believe in one-Triune God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
7.9.2.2. Created in the image of God (good), marred by sin, acquire the likeness of God
(holiness) in this life through personal spiritual effort and the grace of the Holy Spirit.
7.9.2.3. Become holy and enjoy perfect communion with God by acquiring the Gift of the
Holy Spirit.
7.9.2.4. Believe in the resurrection of the body and the soul.
7.9.3. Religious Leaders. Church leaders include: Patriarch, Bishop, Priest, Deacon, Father,
and Pastor.
7.10. Eastern Orthodox—Essential Prayers.
7.10.1. Emergency Baptism. If a dying Orthodox Christian wishes to be baptized when no
priest or Chaplain is available, any Christian may administer baptism. Pour water on the
forehead three times saying his/her name and these words: “I baptize you in the name of the

God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal: have mercy on us. Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy
Immortal: have mercy on us. Glory to the Father, and to the son, and to the Holy Spirit:
now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. All-Holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord,
cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our transgressions. Holy One, visit and heal our
infirmities for thy name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: now and ever, and unto ages of
ages. Amen.”
7.10.2.2. Psalm 51. “Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your loving-kindness;
according to the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. Wash me
thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my
transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Against You, You only, have I sinned, and
done this evil in Your sight—that You may be found just when You speak, and blameless
when You judge. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived
me. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part You will make me
to know wisdom. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be
whiter than snow. Make me hear joy and gladness that the bones You have broken may
rejoice. Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean
heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me away from Your
presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your
salvation, and uphold me by Your generous Spirit. Then I will teach transgressors Your
ways, and sinners shall be converted to You. Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O
God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness. O
Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise. For You do not desire
sacrifice, or else I would give it; You do not delight in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God
are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart—these, O God, You will not despise. Do
good in Your good pleasure to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem. Then You shall be
pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering;
then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.”
7.10.2.3. The Nicene Creed. “I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven
and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, the Only-begotten, Begotten of the Father before all ages, Light of Light; True God of
True God; Begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were
made; who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of
the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man; and was crucified also for us under
Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried. And the third day He rose again, according
to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and
He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, whose Kingdom will have
no end. And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the
Father; Who together with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified; Who spoke
by the prophets. And I believe in one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge
one baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead; and the life of
the world to come. Amen.”

place of brightness, in a place of refreshment, in a place of repose, where all sickness, sorrow
and sighing have fled away. Pardon every sin which (he/she) has committed, whether by word,
deed, or thought, for Thou art a good God and the Lover of mankind: because there is no
person who lives and does not sin. Thou alone art without sin. Thy righteousness is an
everlasting righteousness, and Thy law is truth. For Thou art the Resurrection, and the Life,
and Repose of Thy servant (Name), who has fallen asleep, O Christ our God, and unto Thee do

7-6
AFTTP 3-4.52, 9 August 2023
 
these words, “I Baptize You in the Name of The Father, and The Son, and The Holy Spirit.
Amen.”
7.14.1.1. Report the individuals name and important details to a Chaplain as soon as
possible.
7.14.2. Comfort Prayers and Scriptures.
7.14.2.1. Psalms 23:1-6 (King James Version [KJV]). 1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall
not want. 2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still
waters. 3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s
sake. 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 5 Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 6
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.
7.14.2.2. The Lord’s Prayer—Matthew 6:9-13. “Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed
be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the
glory, forever and ever. Amen.”
7.14.2.3. The Apostles’ Creed. “I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven
and earth, and in Jesus Christ his only son our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy
Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was
buried; He descended into hell. On the third day He rose from the dead. He ascended into
heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come
to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Christian church, and
communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life
everlasting. Amen.”
7.14.2.4. Baptism Scripture—John 3:5-7 and 16. 5Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you,
no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.” 6Flesh
gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. 7You should not be surprised at my
saying, “You must be born again.” 8The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its
sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone
born of the Spirit. 16“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”
7.14.2.5. Communion Scripture—1 Corinthians 11:23-26. 23For I received from the Lord
what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took
bread, 24and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body which is for
you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 25In the same way also he took the cup, after supper,
saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in
remembrance of me.” 26For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim
the Lord’s death until he comes.
7.14.3. Prayer for Near Death. Almighty God, look on this your servant, lying in great
weakness, and comfort (him/her) with the promise of life everlasting given in the resurrection
of your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”

7.14.4. Funeral Prayer. For as much as it has pleased Almighty God to take out of this world
the soul of (name), we therefore commit (his/her) body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to
ashes, dust to dust, looking for that blessed hope when the Lord Himself shall descend from
heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead
in Christ shall rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord, wherefore
comfort one another with these words. Amen.”
7.14.5. Alternate Funeral Prayer. Almighty God, we remember this day before you your
faithful servant (Name); and we pray that, having opened to (him/her) the gates of eternal life,
you will receive (him/her) more and more into joyful service, that, with all who have faithfully
served you in the past, (he/she) may share in the eternal victory of Jesus Christ our Lord; who
lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen.”
7.14.6. Committal for a Temporary Burial. When the body is deposited temporarily in a
vault, “For as much as it has pleased Almighty God to remove from the world the soul of our
(brother/sister), we lay (his/her) body here to rest awhile, then to be buried in the ground, then
shall the dust return to dust as it was, but the spirit returns to God who gave it. Amen.”

spent together. And invoke their protective light to guide me. I light a candle to bless this day,
with the splendor of fire, the freedom of the wind, the stability of earth, and the depth of the
sea. Sun and Moon, grant us birth, Give us life, death, and rest. For we shall meet again once
our souls leave this world. Guide me through the night, And through the sun-lit days. Merry
part and merry meet. In soul and heart, Blessed be.”

path-The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked
[Your] anger or of those who are astray.”
7.37.2.4. Say second “Takbeer (‘Allahu Akbar’).” One can either choose to raise their
hands again up to their earlobes or leave them as is. Both are permissible.
7.37.2.5. Recite Darood on Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) as one does at the end of the
prayer, “O Allah, let Your Peace come upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as
you have brought peace to Ibrahim and his family. Truly, You are Praiseworthy and
Glorious. Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you have blessed
Ibrahim and his family. Truly, You are Praiseworthy and Glorious.”
7.37.2.6. Say third “Takbeer (‘Allahu Akbar’).” One can either choose to raise their hands
again up to their earlobes or leave them as is. Both are permissible.
7.37.2.7. Make supplication (du’a) for the deceased. There are a number of recommended
supplications from the Prophet (pbuh). Following is one of the most popular, “O Allah,
forgive our living and our dead, those present and those absent, our young and our old,
our males and our females. O Allah, whom among us You keep alive, then let such a life be
upon Islam, and whom among us You take unto Yourself, then let such a death be upon
faith. O Allah, do not deprive us of his reward and do not let us stray after him.”
7.37.2.8. Say fourth “Takbeer (‘Allahu Akbar’)” and pause for a little while. One can
either choose to raise their hands again up to their earlobes or leave them as is. Both are
permissible. Some scholars say to recite general supplications for oneself, family, friends,
and all Muslims during this period.
7.37.2.9. Then end by saying one Tasleem to the right (‘Assalaamu ’alaykum wa
rahmat-Allaah’). Doing it on both sides as in regular prayer is also acceptable.
7.38. Islam—The Burial Process. Burial is to occur within 24 hours. Therefore, there is some
urgency in ensuring that the Cause of Death Certificate be available as soon as possible. The
deceased must be buried, not cremated. There is usually no need for embalming.

7.41. Judaism—Essential Prayers.
7.41.1. Prayers for the Dying.
7.41.1.1. The Shema. “Hear O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is One.” Deuteronomy
6:4.
7.41.1.2. Psalm 91. “Whoever sits in the refuge of the Most High, he shall dwell in the
shade of the Almighty. I say of the Lord, my refuge and my stronghold, my God in whom I
trust. For He will deliver you from the ensnaring trap, from destructive plague. With His
pinion will He cover you, and under His wings shall you find refuge; His truth shall be
your shield and armor. You shall not fear the terror of night, nor of the arrow that flies by
day, nor the plague that stalks in the darkness, nor the destroyer that ravages at noon. A
thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, but to you it shall not
approach. Look but clearly and you shall see the retribution against the wicked. Because
You, Lord are my trust, you set the Most High as your dwelling. No harm shall befall you,
nor disease come near your tent. He will charge his angels for you, to protect you in all
your ways. On their palms they will carry you, lest you injure your foot against a stone.
You shall tread on the lion and the viper, you shall tread on the young lion and viper, you
shall trample the young lion and serpent. Because he yearned for Me I will deliver him; I
will be his refuge, for having known My Name. He will call upon Me and I will answer, I
will be with him in distress; I will rescue him and give him honor. With length of days I will
satisfy him, and reveal to him My salvation. With length of days I will satisfy him, and
reveal to him My salvation.”
7.41.1.3. Confession for the Critically Ill. “If God forbid I will die, may my death be an
atonement for all of my sins. I give thanks to You, Lord my God and the God of my
ancestors, in Whose hands is my recovery and my death, for all the life and the necessities
of life that You have provided for me. May it be Your will that You grant me a full recovery,
and if Heaven forfend I will die, may my death be an atonement for all my sins, iniquities,
and transgressions that I have perpetrated before You. Place my portion in the Garden of

Eden and allow me to merit the world to come, that is reserved for the righteous. God,
please heal me. I believe with complete faith in the True Lord God, Whose Name is Truth,
and in the thirteen basic principles. I forgive everyone and ask that everyone forgive me.
Into Your hand I commit my spirit. You have redeemed me, Lord, God of truth. Hear, O
Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One. Blessed is the Name of His glorious Kingdom
forever and ever (3 times). The Lord, he is God (7 times).” If possible, the last words
recited by or in the presence of the dying person should be the Shema.
7.41.1.4. “The Lord is King; the Lord shall reign forever and ever. Blessed be his name,
whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever. The Lord, he is God! Hear, O Israel: The Lord
our God, the Lord is One!”
7.41.2. Death. In the event of death, the following prayer may be said, “The Lord has given,
and the Lord has taken away. Blessed is the Name of the Lord from now and forever. The Rock,
perfect is God’s work, for all God’s paths are just; God of faith without iniquity, righteous and
fair is God.”
7.42. Judaism—Requirements After Death. For a proper Jewish burial, the body is cleansed,
ritually washed, and dressed in special linen or muslin white shrouds with no jewelry. Men
perform the ritual for males and women do so for females. Embalming, autopsies, and
cremation are strictly forbidden. A man is to be buried in his prayer shawl. Tradition requires
that the person be buried in a plain, modest casket which can disintegrate, so no metal caskets.
Traditionally, Jews are buried as quick as possible, no later than 24-hours of death. Ideally,
Jews should be buried in a specifically Jewish cemetery, or at the very least, a Jewish section
of a general cemetery.

CH8 PRIVELAGED COMMUNICATIONS
PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION
8.1. Definitions and Guidance. Privileged and confidential communications are often
considered synonymous. Generally, a confidential communication is also privileged.
8.1.1. Differences.
• Privileged Communication—refers to information that is not admissible in a court or
legal action.
• Confidential Communication—a more general concept, referring information that is
protected both in and out of the legal context; may become privileged if the person who
made the communication is facing court-martial charges.
8.1.2. Privilege. Privilege does not extend between Chaplain Corps personnel and their
supervisors when discussing their personal and professional issues.
8.1.3. Prohibited Capacity. Commanders will not task Chaplain Corps members to serve in
a capacity that may compromise privileged communication.
8.1.4. Detainees/Enemy Prisoners of War. Refer to JP 3-31, Joint Land Operations.
8.1.4.1. Detainees have no privilege of direct support from military Chaplains.
8.1.4.2. Military Chaplains do not generally provide direct religious support to detainees.
8.1.4.3. Should the joint force commander determine a requirement to provide direct
military Chaplain support to detainees, the absolute privilege of communication shall be
maintained in any direct interaction with detainees.
8.1.4.4. Support to detainees shall reflect a respect for their cultural and religious beliefs.
8.2. Key Takeaways. The privilege of confidentiality belongs to the individual counselee, not the
religious support personnel. Under no circumstances may a Chaplain or RA Airmen disclose
privileged communication without the individual counselee’s consent. Refer to AFI 52-101,
Chapter 5 and MCM, Part 3, MRE, Section V, Privileges, Rule 503.
8.2.1. Unauthorized Disclosure. Unauthorized disclosure of privileged communication is a
violation of Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Article 92, Failure to obey order or
regulation and/or UCMJ, Article 133, Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.
NOTE: If there is any question as to whether a communication is confidential and/or privileged,
contact the servicing legal office for advice.

CH9 GENEVA CONVENTIONS
GENEVA CONVENTIONS
9.1. Chaplains. Refer to AFI 52-104, paragraphs 3.1.1. to 3.1.3. and International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC), Commentary on the First Geneva Convention: Convention (I) for the
Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field.
9.1.1. Noncombatant Status. Chaplains are noncombatants and will not be placed in any
duty status that compromises their status as noncombatants. In accordance with the
Department of Defense Law of War Manual, Chaplains serve exclusively in a humanitarian
capacity and must refrain from acts harmful to the enemy.
9.1.1.1. Chaplains do not bear arms. Chaplains do not transport or carry weapons and/or
ammunition under any circumstance. Chaplains must also avoid engaging in other
traditional combatant activities (e.g., assisting in combat operations, conveying military
intelligence, directing response to hostile fire).
9.1.1.2. Although Geneva Conventions do not explicitly prohibit military Chaplains from
bearing self-defensive weapons (i.e., Chaplains from other nation’s militaries are allowed
to), the DOD restricts all US military Chaplains from doing so.
9.1.2. Self Defense. Chaplains maintain an inherent right to self-defense.
9.1.3. Retained Personnel. Chaplains are considered retained personnel as outlined in
Article 28:
“Personnel designated in Articles 24 and 26 who fall into the hands of the adverse Party,
shall be retained only in so far as the state of health, the spiritual needs and the number of
prisoners of war require.
Personnel thus retained shall not be deemed prisoners of war. Nevertheless they shall at
least benefit by all the provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of
Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949. Within the framework of the military laws and
regulations of the Detaining Power, and under the authority of its competent service, they
shall continue to carry out, in accordance with their professional ethics, their medical and
spiritual duties on behalf of prisoners of war, preferably those of the armed forces to which
they themselves belong.”
9.2. RA Airmen. Refer to AFI 52-104, paragraph 3.1.4. and JP 3-83.
9.2.1. Combatant Status. As combatants, RA Airmen provide force protection and security
measures for the RST. If required in line remarks for a specific deployed duty location, Airmen
will carry the M4 rifle and an M9/M18 pistol as their primary weapon and qualify at their
home station. RA Airmen will refrain from conduct or activities that would compromise the
integrity of the RST and non-combatant status of the Chaplain.

CH10 CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR
10.1. Definitions and Guidance.
10.1.1. Conscientious Objector Defined. A member who holds a firm, fixed, and sincere
objection to participation in war in any form or the bearing of arms, by reason of religious
training and/or belief. For further guidance refer to DODI 1300.06, Conscientious Objectors,
paragraph 3.1.
10.1.1.1. A member who, by reason of conscientious objection, sincerely objects to
participation as a combatant in war of any form, but whose convictions are such as to

noncombatant service. Refer to DODI 1300.06, paragraph 3.3. for further guidance.
10.1.1.2. The applicant for conscientious objector status bears the burden of establishing
conscientious objection as grounds for separation or assignment to noncombatant training
and service.
10.2. Key Takeaways. See Table 10.1, Chapter 10 References for further details on
conscientious objectors.
Table 10.1. Chapter 10 References
10.2.1. Process. Understand the entire process and the Chaplain’s roles and responsibilities
before beginning the process.
10.2.2. Authority. The Chaplain is not the deciding authority on who is/is not a conscientious
objector. The Chaplain advises the chain of command as they make a determination.
10.2.3. Determination. Chaplains are to exercise great care in determining the sincerity of
the applicant’s beliefs.
10.2.4. Coordination.
• Wing/installation/senior ranking Chaplain.
• Staff judge advocate (SJA).
• Military personnel flight (MPF).
• Major command/field command.
• Understand the entire process and the Chaplain’s roles and responsibilities before you
start the process.
