PREFACE 
1. Purpose
This multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) publication establishes 
communications tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for tactical command and 
control (TAC C2) to manage air operations and to control airspace and aircraft. It also 
establishes TTP for force packaging and direct air support coordination, air-to-air (A/A) 
communication, A/A intercept, threat A/A warning, threat surface-to-air warning, and air-
to-surface communication. 
2. Scope
This publication provides MTTP for the control and coordination of air operations in TAC 
C2 managed joint operations area (JOAs) or battle management areas (BMA). 
3. Applicability
a. This MTTP publication applies to all TAC C2 airspace control elements and
warfighters that conduct air operations in JOAs or BMAs managed by the joint force
commander (JFC) and overseen by the airspace control authority in accordance with
the JFC signed airspace control plan (ACP) and airspace control order (ACO).
Operational planners and exercise planners can use this publication to inform the
ACP, ACO, the special instructions, the area air defense plan, and rules of
engagement.
b. This publication addresses an avenue for the Services to tap into the intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance constellation. It provides TTP to leverage current
intelligence from platforms like RQ-4; RC-135; U-2; unmanned aircraft systems
(UASs); space; and cyberspace by contacting the TAC C2. The TAC C2 may be
manned by the United States (US) Air Force, Navy, or Marine Corps. TAC C2 would
provide the current, consolidated battlespace picture.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
ACC 
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Air Control Communication 
(ACC) establishes tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) to describe the format for 
direct coordinating communication. Air assets can use these TTP to coordinate force 
packaging and air-to-air (A/A) and air-to-surface (A/S) missions with tactical command 
and control (TAC C2) agencies. TAC C2 agencies can use these TTP to control 
airspace that air assets use to accomplish A/A and A/S missions. 
Chapter I Overview 
Chapter I gives an overview of airspace control and describes TAC C2. A list of 
assumptions are provided for the warfighter to understand appropriate times to apply 
these TTP. 
Chapter II Tactical Administration Communication 
Chapter II defines tactical administration. It describes procedures for network 
transmissions, check-in, WORDS, HAVE QUICK, inflight reports, returning force 
accountability, and procedural control. 
Chapter III Force Packaging and Direct Air Support Coordination 
Chapter III describes TTP for roll calls, LOWDOWN, mission timing changes, 
CHATTERMARK procedures, battlespace handover procedures, and weapons/fuel 
status communication contracts. 
Chapter IV Air-to-air Communication Fundamentals 
Chapter IV provides the fundamental ways fighters and TAC C2 agencies communicate 
about air entities. This lexicon and format for communication are critical for executing 
A/A intercepts. 
Chapter V Air-to-air Intercept Communication 
Chapter V establishes a communication format for A/A employment and air intercept 
control. It governs communication fundamentals, format, and integration between 
fighters and controllers, independent of mission design series (MDS) or type, model, 
and/or series (T/M/S). This chapter is the baseline for all A/A communication in training 
and combat. Service-specific differences are annotated. 
Chapter VI Air-to-surface Communication 
Chapter VI describes aircraft as any air assets executing an A/S mission under TAC C2. 
This chapter establishes a communication format for A/S employment. It governs 
communication fundamentals, format, and integration between aircraft and controllers, 
independent of MDS or T/M/S.

Chapter I 
OVERVIEW 
1. Airspace Control
a. Airspace control is the exercise of delegated authority over designated airspace
and users through control procedures and coordination measures to maximize
operational effectiveness (Joint Publication (JP) 3-52, Joint Airspace Control).
b. The joint force air component commander (JFACC) establishes battle
management areas (BMAs) to support effective, decentralized execution and
distributed control of air operations and delegated airspace control authority and
area air defense commander (AADC) responsibilities.
c. There are two methods of airspace control: positive and procedural.
(1) Positive Control. A method of airspace control that relies on positive
identification, tracking, and direction of aircraft within an airspace, conducted with
electronic means by an agency having the authority and responsibility therein (JP
3-52). Positive control requires sensors to locate and identify airspace users in
real time and provide communications to maintain continuous contact with the
user.
(2) Procedural Control. A method of airspace control which relies on a
combination of previously agreed upon and promulgated orders and procedures
(JP 3-52). Examples include:
(a) Air defense identification (ID) procedures and aircraft ID maneuvers.
(b) Voice and/or digital communications between aircraft and airspace control
elements.
(c) Airspace control measures, such as low-level transit routes, minimum-risk
routes, coordinating altitude, restricted operations zones, and high-density
airspace control zones.
(d) Fire support coordination measures, such as restrictive fire and no-fire
areas.
d. At the tactical level, airspace control is provided by the interaction between
airspace users and airspace control elements (JP 3-52). These may include, but are
not limited to:
(1) A control and reporting center (CRC).
(2) A tactical air operations center (TAOC).
(3) An E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS).
(4) A Navy tactical air control center (Navy TACC).
(5) An E-2 Hawkeye.
(6) A direct air support center (DASC).
(7) An air support operations center (ASOC).
2 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
(8) A battle control center (BCC).
(9) Air defense airspace management.
(10) A brigade aviation element.
(11) Agile control and integration team (ACIT).
(12) Integrated sensing and effects team (ISET).
(13) Other military and civil air traffic control entities.
2. Tactical Command and Control (TAC C2)
a. TAC C2. TAC C2 are airspace control elements under tactical control of the
JFACC, joint force maritime component commander, or composite warfare
commander (CWC) and use positive and/or procedural control methods to control
airspace and manage air operations. Not all airspace control elements are
considered TAC C2.
b. TAC C2 should:
(1) Enable the flow of forces to and from an objective area.
(2) Provide threat warning information and maintain situational awareness (SA)
to the primary objective.
(3) Maintain SA of supporting asset status, threat information, and target area
information.
(4) Maintain air asset deconfliction to and from a working area.
c. The following are some of the TAC C2 capable entities by Service.
(1) Army. None.
(2) Marine Corps. TAOC, DASC, and early warning and control.
(3) Navy. E-2 Hawkeye, Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruisers; Arleigh
Burke-class guided missile destroyers; Nimitz/Ford-class aircraft carriers,
nuclear; amphibious assault ships (general purpose); Wasp-class amphibious
assault ships (multi-purpose); and the San Antonio-class amphibious transport
docks.
(4) Air Force. AWACS, CRC, BCC, ASOC, ACIT, and ISET.
3. Assumptions
a. The functional/Service components will adhere to the joint force commander’s
(JFC’s) guidance provided through the rules of engagement (ROE), airspace control
plan, airspace control order (ACO), area air defense plan, special instructions
(SPINS), and operations task link (OPTASKLINK).
b. The AADC establishes the policy for ID authority, with JFC approval, and
promulgates it via the area air defense plan, SPINS, and/or an OPTASKLINK
supplement. Execution of the ID policy is normally delegated to the tactical level, but
care should be taken that the tactical commander is capable of performing the ID
function.

c. Component commanders have outlined commit, ID, and engagement authority to
battle managers through the area air defense plan, SPINS, ROE, and/or
OPTASKLINK.
d. When executing as a standalone entity, the carrier strike group’s CWC concept
will independently fulfill the roles in paragraphs a.–c. The officer in tactical command
may delegate authority to the CWC. Guidance outlined by the CWC will be
implemented by the following principle warfare commanders:
(1) Air and missile warfare commander.
(2) Surface warfare commander.
(3) Antisubmarine warfare commander.
(4) Strike warfare commander.
(5) Information operations warfare commander.
Note: During peacetime operations, the surface warfare commander and antisubmarine 
warfare commanders are often combined into a single warfare commander, the sea 
combat commander. 
e. The ASOC, DASC, or ACIT is the airspace control element for airspace control
within their assigned BMAs. These two BMAs are normally short of the fire support
coordination line and below a coordinating altitude. These BMAs are commonly
referred to as division assigned airspace or Marine air-ground task force assigned
airspace, respectively.

Chapter II 
TACTICAL ADMINISTRATION (TACADMIN) COMMUNICATION 
Note: Information transmitted via a network (NET) (e.g., FRIENDLY, GROUP, or 
THREAT) and examples of NET transmissions are shown in all capital letters. 
1. TACADMIN
a. TACADMIN consists of all processes and procedures that occur in the TAC C2
JOA or BMA. It relates to:
(1) Interflight and intraflight procedures.
(2) Airborne mission preparation that directly supports executing the tactical
mission objective.
(3) Examples include weapon arming, sensor management, personnel recovery
package marshalling, and tactical communication checks.
b. TACADMIN does not refer to processes and procedures that coordinate air
assets outside the managed JOA or BMA. Examples are:
(1) Navigating in civil airspace under civilian air traffic control.
(2) Operating aircraft in the terminal area under military tower or local area air
traffic control.
(3) Controlling air traffic to facilitate arrival to or departure from an operating
base.
(4) An example of an exception to 1.b. is an aircraft launched under scramble
orders (e.g., an alert status) but operating in civil airspace.
2. Communication Priorities
The prioritized and efficient flow of communication is vital to complex, contested air 
operations. Table 1 specifies the priority for air communication. 
Table 1.  Communication Priorities 
1 
Flight safety and aircraft emergencies. 
2 
KILL verification (in a training environment: range training 
officer (RTO) communications). 
3 
DEFENDING, SPIKE, and THREAT calls. 
4 
Requests for controller and fighter targeting situational 
awareness (i.e., DECLARE, BOGEY DOPE) or response 
to electromagnetic attack (EA) (e.g., STROBE). 
5 
PICTURE or fill-ins. 
6 
Tactical administration (e.g., WORDS update).

3. Directive, Informative, Interrogative, Relay Transmissions
A call sign is associated with every radio transmission. Refer to Chapter IV for additional 
transmission guidance (i.e., pronunciation and formatting). 
a. Directive Transmissions. Aircrew and TAC C2 will use the call sign of the entity
being directed.
Directive Transmission 
Directed by HORNET 1: “HORNET 2, TARGET NORTH GROUP.” 
b. Interrogative Transmissions. Calls that are requests for a response will use the
“[entity speaking to], [speaking entity]” format.
Interrogative Transmission 
Interrogative from EAGLE 11: “MIKE, EAGLE 11, DECLARE ADDITIONAL 
GROUP.” 
c. Informative Transmissions. Calls that provide information that does not require a
response. Informative calls will use [speaking entity] format.
Informative Transmission 
Informative from EAGLE 11: “EAGLE 11, FUEL YELLOW.” 
Informative PICTURE Transmission 
Informative from MAGIC: “MAGIC, PICTURE CLEAN.” 
d. Relaying a Call.
(1) The communication format is “[entity speaking to], relay, [call sign of entity
call being relayed].”
(2) Do not include the relaying entity’s call sign.
Relay Transmission 
From HOG 1 relayed by SNAKE 11 to MIKE: “MIKE, RELAY HOG 1. STRIKE 
PACKAGE MILLER TIME.” 
Note: SNAKE 11’s call sign is omitted from the transmission. 
4. Check-in Procedure
a. Check-in.
(1) The purpose of check-in is for aircrew and TAC C2 airspace control elements
to establish contact, allow the airspace element to establish accountability of the
airborne asset, and to pass critical information to the aircrew before handoff to a
final mission controller.
(a) TAC C2 will verify position and identity of the aircraft.
(b) TAC C2 will route the aircrew to their mission area.
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
7 
(c) The aircrew will gain updated information for the mission area (i.e.,
WORDS, situation update code (also referred to as SUC)).
(d) The aircrew can check anti-jam and secure communication systems.
(2) The aircrew should establish communication with TAC C2 on a dedicated
check-in NET. Dedicated NETs support TACADMIN without interfering with
employment.
(3) Once all tactical information has been relayed to the check-in aircraft, TAC
C2 will switch the aircrew to the final controller tactical NET.
Note: When checking in with the final controller, the on-coming aircraft is assumed to be 
TACADMIN complete. 
(4) For continuous operations (e.g., lane handoff), TAC C2 should consider
passing big-picture information before pushing air assets to the tactical NET.
(5) Check-in should accomplish the items in table 2 before and after mission
execution.

performing as briefed, in accordance with the air tasking order (ATO) or air plan.
(a) Use an abbreviated aircraft check when aircraft are on a published ATO
or air plan.
(b) Check in with the aircrew’s mission number, AS FRAGGED, and request
an ALPHA CHECK from the assigned BULLSEYE. The ALPHA CHECK
provides aircrew a position system check.

Aircraft: “MISER, HORNET 1, MISSION NUMBER 5-1-1-1, CHECKING IN AS 
FRAGGED, REQUEST ALPHA CHECK DEPOT.” 
TAC C2: “HORNET 1, MISER, CONTACT, ALPHA CHECK DEPOT 2-7-0/30.” 
(2) Aircrew must check in “with exceptions” if there are deviations.
(a) Communicate pertinent exceptions to the current mission.
(b) The following deviations should always be communicated by aircrew and
controllers at check-in:
• Number of aircraft (e.g., a three-ship flight when four-ships are
anticipated).
• Ordnance. WEAPONS YELLOW or RED or changes to the tasked
loadout.
• PLAYTIME. FUEL YELLOW or RED.
• Capabilities (e.g., TIMBER SOUR, JACKAL SOUR, GADGET
BENT).
• Other pertinent mission-specific exceptions (identify them during
mission planning).
(c) The following is an example of a check-in with exceptions.

Aircraft: “HORNET 1.” 
(3) The full aircraft check-in format will include mission number, aircraft number
and type, position and altitude, ordnance, PLAYTIME, capabilities, and abort
code.
(4) Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) should check in with TAC C2 via tactical
chat using the same format.
Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Check-in Example 
<#UAS_OPS Chat Room> 
MUSTANG 01: KINGPIN, CHECKING IN AS FRAGGED. 
5. Unable to Make Contact on the Primary Check-in NET
a. The aircrew and TAC C2 should refer to the CHATTERMARK procedures.
b. If still unable to complete the check-in, contact the final controller and, at a
minimum, receive an ALPHA CHECK and WORDS update.
6. Link 16 Fidelity Checks
a. Fidelity checks will begin as soon as aircraft have operational systems, and the
checks will be completed routinely and prior to entering the JOA or BMA.
b. Three attempts will be made to conduct Link 16 fidelity checks. If unsuccessful
after the third attempt, the affected asset will report TIMBER SOUR.
7. Link 16 ID Procedures
a. If an ID difference exists on a link track, coordination will be accomplished on the
track supervision net to verify the correct ID as in the following example.
Track ID Coordination 
MOJO: “BARNYARD, MOJO, TRACK 0-1-2-3-3 HOSTILE, TAG FLANKER” 
BARNYARD: “BARNYARD, TRACK 0-1-2-3-3 HOSTILE, FLANKER.”

8. JACKAL SOUR
Fighters should communicate JACKAL SOUR to controllers during check-in or during 
the mission when they are not receiving accurate surveillance information. 
a. If fighters are JACKAL SOUR, the controller should ensure correlation is met
prior to targeting.
b. If correlation is in question, fighters may request the controller DECLARE a group
or request BOGEY DOPE, bearing, range, altitude, and aspect (BRAA) to a GROUP
prior to weapons employment.
9. WORDS Procedures
a. WORDS is a directive call or interrogative request regarding further information or
directives pertinent to a mission or operating area. WORDS are designated by ATO
day, numbered sequentially, and established and deleted individually. For example,
WORDS AA01 (pronounced ALPHA ALPHA ZERO-ONE) would represent the first
WORDS generated on ATO day “AA.”
(1) WORDS are generated by the TAC C2 agency outlined in the SPINS.
(2) The first WORDS for a new ATO day should incorporate pertinent information
from the previous day.
(3) WORDS are limited in scope to each operating area.
b. Examples of WORDS information include, but are not limited to:
(1) Changes to the package.
(2) NET changes (e.g., a new tactical mission NET).
(3) Timing changes.
(4) Threat updates (e.g., a new active threat axis or sector).
(5) Change to threat warning condition or weapons control status.
(6) Weather affecting execution.
(7) Combat search and rescue events.
c. TAC C2 will relay WORDS to all assets in the operating area, the joint air
operations center (JAOC), Navy TACC, and/or appropriate CWC.
(1) New WORDS will be relayed by TAC C2.
(2) TAC C2 will use digital means (e.g., J28.2), to the maximum extent possible,
when passing WORDS to air assets.
d. Aircraft that check in with TAC C2, should consider adding the current WORDS
they have at the check-in call (i.e., “CHECKING IN WITH WORDS BRAVO ALPHA
0-1”).

WORDS Change 
TAC C2: “HORNET 1, GAMBLER, WORDS BRAVO ALPHA 0-2 NOW 
CURRENT.” 
Aircraft: “GAMBLER, HORNET 1 WITH WORDS BRAVO ALPHA 0-1.” 
TAC C2: “HORNET 1, GAMBLER WORDS BRAVO ALPHA 0-2 TO FOLLOW. 
NEW THREAT AXIS 3-1-0, THREAT WARNING CONDITION RED, WEAPONS 
CONTROL STATUS TIGHT.” 
e. In the previous example, HORNET 1 had WORDS BA01.
(1) TAC C2 only had to relay WORDS BA02.
(2) If the aircrew had checked in without WORDS, TAC C2 would have relayed
all information in WORDS BA01 and BA02.
f. When there are multiple command and control (C2) agencies in an operating
area, WORDS are generated by the assigned TAC C2 agency based on the tactical
situation and inputs from other agencies or units.
10. HAVE QUICK II/Secure Anti-Jam Tactical Ultrahigh Frequency Radio Network
(SATURN) Procedures
a. Successful HAVE QUICK II/SATURN requires a synchronized time-of-day (TOD)
signal, MICKEY, between all communicators. The following is a prioritized list of
TOD sources.
(1) Secure Global Positioning System.
(2) Auto-TOD from an operating location.
(3) Aircrew manual MICKEY (e.g., FA-18 section lead pass to DASH 2).
(4) TAC C2 auto TOD.
(5) TAC C2 manual MICKEY.
Manual MICKEY 
Aircraft: “STRIKE, DOOM 1, REQUEST MICKEY.” 
TAC C2: “DOOM 1, MICKEY IN FIVE.” 
b. Once the aircrew has received a tone, have them attempt a prebriefed HAVE
QUICK II/SATURN NET with instructions on a return frequency if it fails.
HAVE QUICK II Check 
Aircraft: “DOOM 1, GOOD MICKEY.” 
TAC C2: “DOOM 1, STRIKE, PUSH ACTIVE TAD 57 POGO.” 
Note: E-3 AWACS manual MICKEY is single tone only. Expect a multiple tone MICKEY 
from other TAC C2 agencies.

11. Inflight Report (INFLTREP)
This report expedites information flow to tactical and operational C2. It can assist in 
force management, WORDS generation, and intelligence gathering. It can aid in bomb 
hit assessments that inform retasking assets (e.g., reattack). 
a. Theater SPINS or local guidance will outline INFLTREP procedures.
b. INFLTREPs should be passed to TAC C2 upon checking out from a JOA, BMA,
or before returning to base.
c. Reports should be passed on the check-in/get-well frequency, a dedicated
frequency, or via a J28.2.
d. Fighters should strive to pass as much information as possible.
e. READ BACKS for fighter INFLTREP. Theater or exercise guidance should
specify the required read back. In the absence of direction, controllers should use
the following formats for digital or voice fighter INFLTREPs, as depicted in table 6:
(1) For J28.2 only, controllers will respond with a J28.2, “GOOD ZAP
(CALLSIGN MISSION NUMBER), LINE 3 DETAILS…”
(2) For voice, controllers will respond, “COPY (CALLSIGN MISSION NUMBER),
LINE 3 DETAILS.”

TAC C2 check-in controller should attempt to ensure the following for returning forces. 
a. Verify aircraft are SQUAWKING appropriate modes and codes prior to friendly
missile engagement zone (MEZ) entry.
b. Obtain mission results and flight statuses via Link 16 or voice and pass the
inflight report to the JAOC or CWC.
c. Execute Wounded Bird, battle damage, or hung ordnance notification procedures
in accordance with theater directives.
(1) FORCE TELL the track until directed by higher headquarters.
(2) Obtain call sign, status, and track number of the aircraft.
(3) Monitor and track the aircraft until it is out of radar coverage or until it is under
recovery base approach control to ensure a safe return.
(4) Prepare to coordinate combat search and rescue operations.
d. Pass information on HOME PLATE weather and operational status (e.g., runway
closures or recovery procedures).
13. Establishing Procedural Control
Procedural Control. TAC C2 may have positive contact on aircraft flying in the JOA or 
BMA, but use procedural control methods to deconflict air and ground battlespace 
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
17 
requirements. Some TAC C2 agencies should specify at check-in when procedural 
control is used based on system capabilities, crew tasking, and the battlespace 
situation. TAC C2 can establish hold points, control points, and initial points that are 
new or previously unknown. Methods include using common grid reference system, 
Global Area Reference System, common reference point, latitude/longitude, military grid 
reference system (MGRS), or as defined in theater SPINS. Weather, threats, and terrain 
are considerations for finding the bottom altitude of a stack. When TAC C2 moves from 
positive to procedural control, the aircrew should be advised, to the maximum extent 
practical: 
a. Transmit, “NEGATIVE CONTACT”, when an aircraft checks in.
b. TAC C2 may use, “PROCEDURAL CONTROL IN EFFECT”, when the current
operating area standard is positive control.
c. If the operating area standard is procedural control, then TAC C2 does not need
to state, “PROCEDURAL CONTROL IN EFFECT.“
Procedural Control 
“GRIM 11, VULTURE, NEGATIVE CONTACT, PROCEDURAL CONTROL IN 
EFFECT.”

Chapter III 
FORCE PACKAGING AND DIRECT AIR SUPPORT COORDINATION 
Missions that involve a mission commander (MC) require extensive coordination to 
execute. The MC and TAC C2 should establish a plan to receive the LOWDOWN, 
obtain force package accountability before and after mission execution, establish 
backup communication plans, and establish air communication contracts. This section, 
and the following chapters, establish baseline tactics, techniques, and procedures for 
these items. 
1. Force Package Accountability and Roll Call
The MC should ensure the required minimum forces are ready. Two techniques are a 
TAC C2-provided update or a roll call. 
a. TAC C2 Update. TAC C2 should maintain a tally of players that have checked in.
At a predetermined time, TAC C2 provides the MC with the current players.
C2 Update 
“DARKSTAR, PACKAGE BRAVO WHISKEY, MINUS LION 01, MIN FORCES 
MET”. 
b. Roll Call. Roll call is initiated by the TAC C2 or MC, at a predetermined time.
Once initiated, each aircraft, flight lead (FL), or team lead (TL) (as determined by the
MC) will respond with call sign in a predetermined sequence. As a technique, this
sequence can follow the call sign order on a coordination card.
FL Roll Call Example 
Package BRAVO WHISKEY FLs: EAGLE, VIPER, BONES, GROWL, MOJO. 
MC: “PACKAGE BRAVO WHISKEY, ROLL CALL.” 
FLs Respond in Sequence: “EAGLE”, “VIPER WITH EXCEPTIONS”, “BONES”, 
“GROWL”, “MOJO”. 
MC: “VIPER GO WITH EXCEPTIONS.” 
VIPER: “VIPER MINUS 2.” 
If a flight does not respond to the roll call, the MC can query TAC C2. 
TL Roll Call Example 
Package BRAVO WHISKEY TLs: Escort, Strike, Airlift, TAC C2. 
MC: “PACKAGE BRAVO WHISKEY, ROLL CALL.” 
TLs Respond in Sequence: “ESCORT WITH EXCEPTIONS”, “STRIKE”, 
“AIRLIFT”, “TAC C2.” 
MC: “ESCORT GO WITH EXCEPTIONS.”

c. Times to consider initiating a roll call.
(1) Post LOWDOWN.
(2) When there are updated WORDS.
(3) When forces completed their mission and are returning.
(4) When there is a suspected or known loss of an air asset.
(5) When there is a timing change to the mission.
(6) When the weather plan changes.
(7) When there is key mission enabler fallout.
(8) Post CHATTERMARK on a new NET.
(9) Escort commander/lane commander change when new commander was not
previously established or provided with information airborne.
2. LOWDOWN
LOWDOWN is a request for the tactical electromagnetic support picture or 
ground/surface picture in an area of interest. TAC C2 should correlate all factor 
ground/surface systems using the BULLSEYE format. 
Note: When communicating with United States (US) Army or US Marine Corps rotary-
wing and UAS, pass surface threat information in MGRS, if known. Attempt to provide at 
least a six-digit grid. 
a. LOWDOWN is passed at a briefed time (e.g., 5 minutes prior to mission
execution) and is immediately followed by a roll call.
b. Format for LOWDOWN is:
(1) Core information.
(2) PICTURE format, if assessed ground picture (or leading edge) meets
PICTURE criteria and “MEZ PICTURE” or “LOWDOWN PICTURE” is requested.
If long-range air defense (LRAD) surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems are a
factor and not included in the PICTURE, communicate as core information.
c. An aircrew may request LOWDOWN but should do so in accordance with
communication priorities (allow 30 to 60 seconds for TAC C2 to compile
LOWDOWN).
d. For aircraft not in the tactical NET during the initial LOWDOWN, it is passed upon
initial check-in as part of the WORDS.
e. LOWDOWN may not be required for each mission set, such as when fighters are
conducting a defensive counterair mission in a permissive environment.
f. LOWDOWN is passed digitally, via Link 16 and tactical chat, or verbally. The
LOWDOWN will include changes to the briefed order of battle, such as newly
detected systems, systems that have moved a tactically significant distance, or
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
21 
systems that are assessed to be DOWN. The following may be included in a 
LOWDOWN: 
(1) LRAD or “strategic” SAM systems ACTIVE or AWAKE.
(2) Medium-range air defense (MRAD) systems ACTIVE or AWAKE.
(3) Short-range air defense (SHORAD) or “tactical” SAMs ACTIVE or AWAKE
within the last hour (e.g., antiaircraft artillery or naval tactical SAM).
(4) MOVERS/ROTATORS meeting briefed reporting criteria.
(5) Additional entities, events, or areas of interest applicable to the mission.
Note: Specific systems or ranges used to prioritize LOWDOWN communications should 
be determined during mission planning. 
LOWDOWN Example 
“GOLIATH, LOWDOWN. SA TWENTY AWAKE BULLSEYE 0-9-0/10, HQ-9 
ACTIVE BULLSEYE 0-8-5/13, FIFTEEN ACTIVE BULLSEYE 0-7-5/14, 
ROTATOR BULLSEYE 2-6-0/11. HOSTILE CONVOY BULLSEYE 2-7-0/10 
TRACK EAST.” 
g. For tactical SAMs and MOVERS, the order of dissemination is:
(1) Closest MEZ to friendly forces.
(2) Closest MEZ to friendly axis of attack or ingress routes.
(3) Most lethal.
3. Timing Changes
a. ROLEX. Timeline adjustment in minutes; always referenced from original
preplanned mission execution time.
(1) ROLEX is used to adjust the mission timing.
(2) PLUS is assumed.
(3) If a time on target (TOT) window extension is required to adhere to the
ROLEX, TAC C2 agencies should request approval and pass it to the affected
flights.
(4) ROLEX is made in 5-minute increments and is not additive.
ROLEX Example 
Original package WHISKEY ALPHA mission start time: 1500Z. 
“COWBOY, PACKAGE WHISKEY ALPHA, ROLEX 10.” 
New mission start time: 1510Z. 
“COWBOY, PACKAGE WHISKEY ALPHA, ROLEX 15.” 
New mission start time: 1515Z. 
b. SLIP. SLIP is time delay to individual flight or element event. SLIP is not additive.
22 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8
09 OCT 2024
SLIP Example 
Original TOT: 1500Z. 
“HARDROCK, HOSS 1, SLIP TOT 6 MINUTES.” 
New TOT: 1506Z. 
“HARDROCK, HOSS 1, SLIP TOT 9 MINUTES.” 
New TOT: 1509Z. 
c. For changes to training vulnerability times, MCs and TAC C2 should use plain
language to avoid confusion.
New Vul Time Example 
“HARDROCK, NEW VUL TIME 1600Z.” 
Note: A change to vul time will include all participants, including white and red forces. 
4. CHATTERMARK Procedures
a. CHATTERMARK procedures are established to transition from primary to
alternate tactical NETs.
b. The CHATTERMARK plan should:
(1) Provide alternate NETs, which reside in different frequency bands.
(2) Prioritize secure, frequency-hopping forms of radio communication. Tailor
them based on threat communication jamming capabilities.
(3) Establish a “get well” NET, such as the TAC C2 check-in NET. If the aircrew
are unsure of the current tactical NET, they can switch to the “get well” NET to
receive direction from TAC C2.
(4) Outline the criteria and authority for executing a CHATTERMARK. This
resides with MC or a designated TL. Degradation on the primary tactical NET due
to communications jamming or system limitations for the aircrew or controller
(e.g., UNABLE HAVE QUICK) are the most common reasons to
CHATTERMARK.
c. Request a CHATTERMARK via a “Request POGO [NET name in color and
number]” (e.g., INDIGO 03).
d. If a CHATTERMARK is directed, all assets will switch to the planned alternate
NET, in accordance with the CHATTERMARK plan, and await a roll call.
(1) TAC C2 or MC will repeat CHATTERMARK three times on the primary
tactical NET prior to switching to the alternate tactical NET and publish a digital
message.
(2) If able, TAC C2 will simulcast on the old, affected NET and the new NET.
(3) TAC C2 simulcast will continue until force accountability is confirmed on the
new NET.
(4) Force accountability on new NET.

23 
(a) Per the mission plan, FLs or TLs should communicate their call sign on
the new NET. TAC C2 should only acknowledge if communication time allows
in accordance with communication priorities.
(b) TAC C2 should note accountability as players check in. TAC C2 will
accomplish a ROLL CALL if needed.
(c) TAC C2 should communicate “NET SWEET” on the new NET once all
players have checked in.
CHATTERMARK Example 
Primary NET degradation is noted by TAC C2. 
Transmitting on the Old NET: 
MISER (TAC C2): “CHATTERMARK, CHATTERMARK, CHATTERMARK.” 
Transmitting on New NET: 
FLs: “EAGLE.” “RAPTOR.” “HORNET.” “GROWLER.” 
MISER: “NET SWEET.” 
5. Lane Handover Procedures
Note: Refer to other mission-specific publications for positive handoff of mission 
command roles (e.g., strike coordination and reconnaissance or close air support). 
a. A positive handoff is required by the off-going and on-coming lane commander
and should occur in the following sequence.
(1) MOVE FORWARD. On-coming aircraft may enter the operating area (e.g.,
defensive counterair lane). This does not transition lane commander authority.
MOVE FORWARD 
Off-going Lane Commander: “HORNET 1, MOVE FORWARD.” 
On-coming Lane Commander: “HORNET 1.” 
(2) COMMIT. When directed by the lane commander, this call transitions
communication priority to the committing aircraft.
(3) Lane Commander Transition. The off-going lane commander will get positive
communication lane handoff to the on-coming lane commander.
Lane Handoff 
Off-going Lane Commander: “HORNET 1, YOU HAVE THE LANE.” 
On-coming Lane Commander: “HORNET 1, HAS THE LANE.” 
b. The off-going aircraft will pass critical mission information to TAC C2 in
accordance with theater INFLTREP procedures.
(1) TAC C2 will use this information to update WORDS or LOWDOWN.
(2) TAC C2 should pass big-picture information to the on-coming lane
commander before pushing assets to the tactical frequency.

Example 
“TULSA, TWELVE GROUPS, LEADING EDGE FOUR GROUP WALL 
TARGETED BY RAPTOR. RAPTOR FUEL YELLOW, EAGLE WEAPONS RED.” 
c. TAC C2 will relay critical information affecting off-going aircraft return-to-base
procedures. Pass information on weather and airfield issues (e.g., runway closures).
6. Fuel/Weapons Statuses
a. Unless otherwise briefed, YELLOW and RED are defined as:
(1) YELLOW: Aircraft is at a weapon and/or fuel status that is approaching a
level insufficient to continue execution of the mission.
(2) RED: Aircraft is at weapon and/or fuel state that is insufficient to continue
execution of the mission.
b. Aircraft must relay when they are YELLOW to TAC C2.
c. Aircraft are assumed GREEN unless otherwise reported.
Note: A specific loadout or fuel state should be determined during mission planning 
(e.g., 1 radar missile/10 minutes fuel remaining). 
d. TAC C2 is responsible to coordinate on-station relief prior to the aircraft
communicating RED on the primary NET.
FUEL/WEAPONS State Example 
Fighter that is FUEL red and WEAPONS green will report: 
“RAMBO 01, FUEL RED, WEAPONS GREEN.”

Chapter IV 
AIR-TO-AIR COMMUNICATION FUNDAMENTALS 
Note: For this publication, controller is a general term used to define the individual 
providing tactical control of an intercept or mission. The term “fighter” is used throughout 
this chapter. Fighter information applies to any aircraft capable of employing air-to-air 
(A/A) ordnance. Controller and fighter are used independent of platform or Service. 
1. COMMUNICATION FUNDAMENTALS
a. A GROUP is the way TAC C2 and aircraft describe other air assets, and is used
to describe unknown or enemy aircraft.
b. The PICTURE establishes a common tactical air image and describes the spatial
relationship of GROUPs.
2. GROUP
a. A GROUP is any number of air CONTACTs within 3 nm in azimuth and range of
each other.
(1) CONTACT is an individual radar return within a GROUP.
(2) SINGLE CONTACT is the assumed STRENGTH for all GROUPs. More
CONTACTs are specified (e.g., SINGLE GROUP TWO CONTACTs).
Note: The controlling platform’s capabilities and limitations will determine if controllers 
communicate the number of CONTACTs in a GROUP. If unable to determine the 
number of CONTACTs, but assessed to be three or more, controllers will only use the 
fill-in, HEAVY. 
b. GROUPs are distinguished by either a unique name or unique position.
(1) There are four unique naming conventions used:
(a) Cardinal Relationship (e.g., NORTH GROUP, SOUTH GROUP).
(b) Range Relationship. Relationship relative to a specific aircraft perspective
(e.g., LEAD GROUP, TRAIL GROUP).
(c) Combined Cardinal and Range Relationship (e.g., NORTH LEAD
GROUP).
(d) Descriptive Name (e.g., SINGLE GROUP, ADDITIONAL GROUP, POP-
UP GROUP).
(2) Unique Position Reference. GROUPs can be distinguished using unique
position names such as BULLSEYE, BRAA, or geographic reference (GEOREF).
c. UNTARGETED.
(1) If a GROUP has not been targeted inside the briefed targeting range, then
the controller should use the term UNTARGETED. UNTARGETED will follow
GROUP name/label to describe the priority GROUPS that are a risk to the
mission or force (e.g., an enemy approaching the mission fail line).
26 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
UNTARGETED Example 
“DRAGNET, NORTH GROUP UNTARGETED, BULLSEYE 2-7-0/15, TWENTY 
THOUSAND, TRACK WEST, HOSTILE.” 
Note: US Navy assets will issue directive targeting to fighters who are inside the 
targeting range if the controller assesses targeting has not been issued or is not sound. 
(2) Tactics selection per the fighter’s targeting plan will determine the
applicability of UNTARGETED.
(3) If a fighter calls TARGETED or acknowledges directive targeting, contracts
for UNTARGETED and THREAT calls are cancelled.
(4) Controllers could use UNTARGETED or issue directive targeting to the
appropriate GROUP if inside targeting range and targeting is assessed to be
unsound.
3. Core Information Format
Controllers and air assets will use the core information format to communicate 
GROUPs: 
a. Total number of GROUPs.
b. GROUP location (i.e., BULLSEYE, BRAA, or GEOREF).
c. Altitude (rounded to the nearest thousands of feet).
d. Track direction or specific aspect (e.g., cardinal/sub-cardinal or
HOT/FLANK/BEAM/DRAG).
e. Declaration.
f. Fill-ins (as appropriate).
4. GROUP Location
a. BULLSEYE (primary method to communicate the GROUP location).
(1) BULLSEYE is an established reference point from which the position of an
object can be referred to by bearing (magnetic) and range (nm).
(2) BULLSEYE information is rounded to the nearest degree and nm.
(a) For example, BULLSEYE 225/30 means 30 nm on a magnetic bearing of
225 degrees from the BULLSEYE location.
(b) It is communicated “two-two-five thirty.”
(c) If an aircraft is within 5 nm of BULLSEYE, the GROUP may be described
as AT BULLSEYE.
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
27 
GROUP AT BULLSEYE Example 
“EAGLE 11, LEAD GROUP, AT BULLSEYE, THIRTY-NINE THOUSAND, 
TRACK NORTH, HOSTILE.” 
(3) Use the code name for BULLSEYE when directed by SPINS.
BULLSEYE Code Name Example 
BULLSEYE Code Name: ROCK. 
“MIKE, SOUTH GROUP, ROCK 2-5-5/29, THIRTY-NINE THOUSAND, CAP 
(combat air patrol), HOSTILE.” 
(4) BULLSEYE will not be truncated to “bull” to avoid it being misinterpreted as
“BRAA.”
b. BRAA.
(1) BRAA information for bearing and range are rounded to the nearest degree
and nm.
(2) BRAA calls provide target bearing, range, altitude, and aspect relative to the
specified FRIENDLY aircraft. For example, BRAA 225/10 means 10 nm on a
magnetic bearing of 225 degrees from the FRIENDLY aircraft. It is communicated
“two-two-five ten.”
(3) Controllers should use the BRAA format if the information being
communicated pertains only to one specific aircraft or if responding directly to the
following fighter requests: BRAA, BOGEY DOPE, and SNAPLOCK.
(4) Controllers will also use the BRAA format when providing a THREAT call to
an aircraft.
THREAT Call Example 
“EAGLE 11, LEAD GROUP, THREAT BRAA 2-7-0/55, THIRTY-NINE 
THOUSAND, FLANK NORTHEAST, HOSTILE.” 
c. GEOREF Point.
(1) A GEOREF can be used to provide the approximate location of a GROUP. A
GROUP within 5 nm of a designated GEOREF may be referred to as “At” that
point, as with “AT BULLSEYE.”
(2) Examples of GEOREFs may be a prominent natural feature, such as a
mountain peak, or a prominent manmade structure, such as an airfield.
GEOREF Example 
Prominent Enemy Airfield Code Name: DEPOT. 
“EAGLE 11, LEAD GROUP, AT DEPOT, THIRTY-NINE THOUSAND, CAP, 
HOSTILE.” 
(3) Controllers may voice HITS when correlated sensor returns are not sufficient
to fulfill the ID matrix or create a link track but corroborate with known enemy
tactics or procedures. Controllers will voice GEOREFs or BULLSEYE and altitude
if known.
28 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
HITS Example 
Prominent Enemy Airfield Code Name: SEATTLE. 
“FOCUS, HITS SEATTLE ELEVEN THOUSAND.” 
5. GROUP Altitude
a. Fighters and controllers will round altitudes to the nearest thousand feet indicated
on their system.
b. Controllers will not use LOW or HIGH in place of the altitude and will use
“ALTITUDE UNKNOWN” if the controlling platform is capable of determining altitude,
but a solution is not available. Controllers may voice “LAST” after the altitude if the
controlling platforms sensors have lost altitude data on a track, but the controller has
reported or offboard data for a last known altitude, up to 30 seconds after report.
LAST Altitude Example 
Fighter: “FOCUS, DECLARE NORTH GROUP.” 
Controller: “FOCUS, NORTH GROUP BULLSEYE 2-7-5/44, TWENTY 
THOUSAND LAST, TRACK EAST, HOSTILE.” 
c. Controllers will omit altitude from the communication format if the controlling
platform is not capable of generating an altitude.
d. Altitude STACKS.
(1) Altitude separation in a GROUP greater than or equal to 10,000 feet are
voiced as a STACK stating the higher altitude first, then the lower altitude.
Altitude Stack Example 
“EAGLE 11, NORTH GROUP BRAA 3-0-0/32, STACK THIRTY-TWO 
THOUSAND, EIGHT THOUSAND, HOT, HOSTILE, TWO CONTACTS, 
FLANKER.” 
(2) If the STACK has two or more altitude separations of 10,000 feet within the
group, then controllers may voice the number of CONTACTs
HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW or at specific altitudes as fill-in information. One contact at
each altitude is assumed. If multiple, the controller will voice all contacts.
HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW Altitude Stack Example 
“HARDROCK, NORTH GROUP UTAH 3-0-0/12, STACK THIRTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND, TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND, TRACK WEST, HOSTILE, HEAVY, 
THREE CONTACTS, TWO HIGH, ONE LOW.” 
Specific Altitude Example 
“BARNYARD, ADDITIONAL GROUP PEAK 2-0-0/12, STACK THIRTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND, TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND, TEN THOUSAND, TRACK WEST, 
HOSTILE, HEAVY, THREE CONTACTS.”

29 
6. Track Direction and Specific Aspect
a. Track direction will always be used to communicate a GROUP via BULLSEYE
and communicated with the cardinal or sub-cardinal direction (e.g., TRACK SOUTH,
TRACK NORTHEAST).
b. PICTURE Exception.
(1) If all GROUPs in a traditional PICTURE, LEADING EDGE, or PACKAGE are
tracking the same direction, controllers should use the term TRACK with the
cardinal direction following the PICTURE label.
GROUPs TRACK the Same Direction Example 
“MIKE, TWO GROUPS RANGE THIRTY, TRACK EAST. LEAD GROUP ROCK 
1-4-5/60, THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND, HOSTILE. TRAIL GROUP TWENTY
THOUSAND, HOSTILE.”
(2) If amplifying the PICTURE with TRACK direction, controllers should not
provide a track direction for every GROUP in the picture.
c. Specific aspects, as depicted in figure 1, are used when correlating a group to a
specific fighter and will be used when communicating with the BRAA format.
(1) Specific aspects (i.e., HOT, FLANK, BEAM, and DRAG) are determined by
the GROUP target aspect (TA) or aspect angle (also referred to as AA) to the
fighter.
(2) FLANK, BEAM, and DRAG are accompanied with a cardinal/sub-cardinal
direction (e.g., DRAG EAST).

09 OCT 2024 
Note: If the controller assesses GROUPs in a combat air patrol (CAP), “CAP” may be 
communicated in place of TRACK direction or a specific aspect. 
d. MANEUVER Description (TRACK Direction or Specific Aspects).
e. Controllers may use “maneuver hot” to communicate groups/contacts that have
maneuvered toward the fight axis.
f. When controllers assess GROUP maneuvers during the PICTURE call and are
unable to determine the TRACK direction or aspect, controllers may use
MANEUVER instead of the TRACK direction.
GROUP Maneuvers Example 
“TANGO, TWO GROUPS RANGE TWENTY-FIVE OPENING. LEAD GROUP 
BULLSEYE 2-6-5/18, THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND, MANEUVER, HOSTILE. 
TRAIL GROUP, THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND, TRACK NORTH, HOSTILE.” 
7. Declaration
a. A declaration is required to communicate a GROUP via BULLSEYE or BRAA.
b. Voice declaration is BOGEY, FRIENDLY, NEUTRAL, BANDIT, or HOSTILE.
c. Link ID may be acceptable as a means of declaration if defined by SPINS and
ROE.
8. Fill-in Information
a. Fill-ins increase descriptive details about a GROUP.
b. Fill-ins are prioritized as follows:
(1) HEAVY and Number of CONTACTs.
(a) A GROUP is HEAVY if it is known to contain three or more CONTACTs.
(b) Provide the number of CONTACTs in a GROUP, if it is determined.
(c) Fighters will use STRENGTH and controllers will use the term
CONTACTs to distinguish who is providing the STRENGTH assessment.
CONTACTs Example 
Controller: “CLUBHOUSE, WEST GROUP HEAVY FOUR CONTACTS.” 
STRENGTH Example 
Fighter: “EAGLE 12, EAST GROUP HEAVY STRENGTH THREE.” 
(2) Platform/Type. Controllers will provide an aircraft platform (e.g., fighter or
bomber), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) type designator (e.g.,
FULCRUM or FLANKER), or as mission planned with PICTUREs and requests
for SA to that GROUP.
(3) HIGH. Contact is greater than 40,000 feet mean sea level. HIGH can be used
as a fill-in.
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
31 
(4) FAST or VERY FAST. These definitions are provided as references.
(a) FAST. Target speed of 660–900 knots ground speed or 1.1–1.5 mach.
(b) VERY FAST. Target speed greater than 900 knots or 1.5 mach.
Fill-ins Example 
“DRAGNET, NORTH GROUP, BULLSEYE 2-7-0/15, FORTY-TWO THOUSAND, 
TRACK WEST, HOSTILE, HIGH, VERY FAST.” 
(5) TARGETED BY, LEANING ON, THREAT TO.
(a) TARGETED BY provides SA that a GROUP is already TARGETED.
TARGETED BY Example 
Fighter: “MIKE, EAGLE 11, DECLARE NORTH GROUP.” 
Controller: “EAGLE 11, NORTH GROUP, BULLSEYE 2-8-5/35, TWENTY 
THOUSAND, TRACK EAST, HOSTILE, TARGETED BY HORNET 2.” 
(b) Targeting responsibility is cancelled when the fighters communicate any
of the following: DROP(ING) (GROUP name), BLOW(ING) THROUGH,
SPITTER, or executes an OUT. The group should be treated as
UNTARGETED if no fighter subsequently targets.
(c) LEANING ON aids in assessing which aircraft a THREAT is possibly
targeting.
• Making an accurate LEANING ON assessment is increasingly difficult
with improved THREAT capabilities. For example, a FLANK or BEAM
THREAT could be employing ordnance while LEANING ON another
fighter.
• LEANING ON assessments are generally reserved for when fighters
are in COLD operations but may be used in other situations, such as
non-cooperative targeting.
LEANING ON Example 
“DARKLORD, SINGLE GROUP ROCK 2-5-6/49, THIRTY-NINE THOUSAND, 
TRACK EAST, HOSTILE, FLANKER, LEANING ON EAGLE 1.” 
(d) THREAT TO may be used when fighters are in COLD operations and a
fighter does not meet the minimum recommit range or as an additional fill-in
to a traditional THREAT call.
THREAT TO Example 
“MIKE, TWO GROUPS AZIMUTH TWENTY-FIVE. NORTH GROUP, ROCK 
2-8-5/35, THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND, TRACK EAST, HOSTILE, THREAT TO
HORNET 1. SOUTH GROUP THIRTY THOUSAND, TRACK EAST, HOSTILE.”
(6) IMPACT (PLUS time of flight).

ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
(a) Controllers will add the IMPACT time to any FRIENDLY surface-to-air
(S/A) fires when operating in a joint engagement zone or fighter engagement
zone.
IMPACT Example 1 
“GAMBLER, BIG STICK AWAY TRAIL GROUP, IMPACT ONE PLUS FIFTEEN.” 
(b) The IMPACT time is used to aid follow-on fighter targeting, decision
making, and ensure fires deconfliction.
(c) IMPACT time can be used as a PICTURE fill-in as well.
IMPACT Example 2 
“GAMBLER, TRAIL GROUP ROCK 1-8-0/85, THIRTY THOUSAND, TRACK 
NORTH, HOSTILE, IMPACT ONE PLUS FIFTEEN.” 
c. Inner GROUP Formations.
(1) When describing an inner GROUP formation, controllers and fighters will use
the terms described in figure 2, Inner GROUP Formations.
(2) Controllers and fighters should only name the inner GROUP formation when
this call will enhance fighter targeting or SA approaching the merge.
(3) Inner GROUP formations should be used inside expected radar resolution
ranges.
(4) In cruise missile defense (CMD), inner COVEY formations should be voiced
to the maximum extent possible.

9. PICTURE
a. PICTURE is a request to provide information pertinent to the mission in a
BULLSEYE format, unless briefed otherwise.
b. The PICTURE establishes a common tactical air image and describes the spatial
relationship of GROUPs.
Note: FRIENDLY, NEUTRAL, STRANGERs, and nonparticipating GROUPs will not be 
included in the PICTURE or total number of GROUPs identified as part of the tactical 
picture. If FRIENDLY, NEUTRAL, STRANGERs, or nonparticipating GROUPs are a 
factor, they are addressed in a separate transmission. 
Figure 2. Inner-GROUP Formations 
c. Standardized intercept contracts are executed based on the PICTURE.
d. PICTURE Format.
(1) There are five ways to communicate the PICTURE. They are:
(a) Core information.
(b) Traditional labels.
(c) LEADING EDGE communication.
(d) WAVEs.
(e) PACKAGEs.
(2) Within a PICTURE, each GROUP will have an established name that is
retained until:

09 OCT 2024 
(a) A NEW PICTURE is called.
(b) The GROUP is reduced by attrition.
(c) The GROUP is no longer a factor to the operating area.
10. Core Information Concerning a PICTURE
a. Core information concerning a picture is primarily used to:
(1) Pre-COMMIT.
(2) If the PICTURE does not meet a traditional or LEADING EDGE label.
b. The PICTURE call will include the total number of GROUPs and is anchored in
accordance with anchoring priorities as explained in paragraph 12.
c. FOUR GROUPs or More.
(1) The call will include the total number of GROUPs.
(2) Communicate only the three highest priority GROUPs.
FOUR GROUPs or More Example 
“DARKSTAR, TEN GROUPS. GROUP BULLSEYE 0-2-0/25, TWENTY-SEVEN 
THOUSAND, TRACK EAST, HOSTILE, HEAVY, THREE CONTACTS. GROUP 
BULLSEYE 2-7-0/25, FIFTEEN THOUSAND, TRACK WEST, HOSTILE. GROUP 
BULLSEYE 2-9-0/35, TEN THOUSAND, TRACK WEST, HOSTILE.” 
11. Special Mission Aircraft (SMA) PICTURE
SMA are enemy aircraft that generally operate in a supporting role such as 
electromagnetic warfare or C2. Similar to a LOWDOWN, a SMA PICTURE will include 
any SMA relevant to the current mission. Once a SMA PICTURE is given, those aircraft 
can be excluded from any subsequent tactical pictures. 
a. The SMA picture should be given after fighter check-in, prior to the initial picture,
as depicted in figure 3.
b. When naming SMA for a SMA PICTURE there are two methods:
(1) If SMA positioning matches a traditional label, the associated names for that
label will be used (e.g., NORTH SMA, MIDDLE SMA, SOUTH SMA).
(2) If SMA positioning does not match a traditional label, the SMA can be
numbered (e.g., 1st SMA, 2nd SMA, 3rd SMA).
c. When anchoring each individual SMA, the following format will be used:
(1) Name.
(2) Location from BULLSEYE.
(3) Altitude.
(4) Declaration.
(5) Platform.
(6) Track number.

tactically significant.
e. If the SMA PICTURE is passed via secure communications, NATO designators
can be used. If the SMA PICTURE is passed via non-secure communications,
applicable code words should be used.

12. Anchoring a PICTURE
An anchor is a BULLSEYE used to establish the PICTURE and aid in fighter targeting. 
a. Geographic boundaries and the targeting game plan will dictate the maximum
GROUPs that are anchored (e.g., dual-lane defensive counterair with a fighter
engagement zone that has a defined azimuth boundary). Anchoring is prioritized
based on risk to force and risk to mission.
b. Anchoring priorities can shift from risk to force (e.g., fighters) to risk to mission.
For example, an enemy striker approaches a mission fail line and puts the mission at
risk. In this case, the enemy striker may be the anchoring priority.
c. When risk to force is a higher priority than risk to mission, controllers will anchor
GROUPs referring to the following priorities:
(1) The threat that is closest to fighters.
(2) The most capable threat (based on combat identification, declaration, aircraft
type, flight profile).
(3) Highest GROUPs.
(4) The largest GROUP STRENGTH.
d. GROUPs will be anchored with BULLSEYE if the GROUPs are outside 10 nm in
azimuth. With multiple GROUPs in azimuth, unless utilizing directive targeting, only
anchor the outermost GROUPs.

13. Traditional Labels for a PICTURE
a. Controllers should use traditional labels and GROUP names with the following
criteria:
(1) COMMIT criteria has been met.
(2) Threat formation is discernible, matches a traditional label, and labeling a
PICTURE will build SA and aid fighter targeting.
Figure 5. Pre-COMMIT Core Information 
(3) If a traditional label does not apply based on the threat presentation,
controllers should use LEADING EDGE communication.
b. The standard labels used are: SINGLE GROUP, RANGE, AZIMUTH, VIC,
CHAMPAGNE, WALL, LADDER, and BOX.
Note: FRIENDLY, NEUTRAL, STRANGERs, and nonparticipating GROUPs will not be 
included in the PICTURE or total number of GROUPs identified as part of the tactical 
picture. If FRIENDLY, NEUTRAL, STRANGERs, or nonparticipating GROUPs are a 
factor, they are addressed in a separate transmission. 
14. Amplifying a Traditional Label for a PICTURE
a. Amplifying remarks follow the dimensions of the traditional PICTURE.
OPENING/CLOSING, TRACK, WEIGHTED, and ECHELON are the most common
amplifying remarks.

b. PICTURE amplification order will be:
(1) OPENING/CLOSING.
(2) WEIGHTED.
(3) ECHELON.
(4) TRACK direction.
c. OPENING or CLOSING.
(1) OPENING or CLOSING can be applied when the distance between GROUPs
is increasing or decreasing and may impact the fighter intercept.
(2) OPENING or CLOSING is placed following the PICTURE label and
dimensions but in front of other amplifying remarks, such as ECHELON and
TRACK, as depicted in figures 6 and 7.

THOUSAND, HOSTILE, TWO CONTACTS, SOUTH TRAIL GROUP TWELVE 
THOUSAND, BOGEY SPADES.” 
d. WEIGHTED. This is an amplifying remark that describes traditional labels with
THREE GROUPs or more.
(1) The PICTURE is WEIGHTED if one or more GROUPs are offset (i.e., the
distance between GROUPs are not equidistant).
(a) Divide the azimuth into thirds.
(b) If the out-of-position GROUP is outside the middle third, it is WEIGHTED.
(c) In a WEIGHTED WALL PICTURE, communicate a separation distance
from the highest priority, anchored GROUP to the next closest GROUP.
(d) If the picture is a weighted VIC and the lead group is outside of the trail
groups, use weighted if the lead group is less than or equal to 5 nm laterally
when measured perpendicular to the threat axis and not opening. Otherwise,
consider using a wall label with an echelon component.
(e) If the picture is a weighted CHAMPAGNE and the trail group is outside of
the lead groups, use weighted if the trail group is less than or equal to 5 nm

Otherwise, consider using a wall label with an echelon component, as 
depicted in figure 8.

Figure 9. Three GROUP Wall WEIGHTED 
e. ECHELON.
(1) ECHELON is used to amplify a traditional label when GROUPs in the
traditional label are not directly in AZIMUTH or RANGE with one another.
(2) ECHELON should not be used if the depth component between GROUPs is
less than or equal to 5 nm.
(3) ECHELON is accompanied by a cardinal or sub-cardinal direction and is
stated following the PICTURE label and dimensions. The threat axis will
determine the direction of the ECHELON.
(a) If the distance between GROUPs is wider than it is deep, the PICTURE is
called AZIMUTH. If the separation is deeper than it is wide, the PICTURE is
called RANGE.
(b) Controllers can create a line 45 degrees from the GROUP closest to the
fighters, in the direction of the offset GROUP.
(c) If the offset GROUP is forward of the 45-degree line, the PICTURE is an
AZIMUTH. If the GROUP is aft of the 45-degree line, the PICTURE is a
RANGE, as depicted in figures 10, 11, 12, and 13. The distance between
GROUPs will be passed as SEPARATION.

a. The label SINGLE GROUP will only be used when one known
BOGEY/BANDIT/HOSTILE GROUP is detected in an operating area. The label is
SINGLE GROUP and all information is passed as core information.
SINGLE GROUP Example 
“CHALICE, SINGLE GROUP BULLSEYE 3-6-0/20, TWENTY THOUSAND, 
TRACK WEST, BOGEY SPADES.” 
b. TWO GROUPs are labeled AZIMUTH or RANGE.
(1) AZIMUTH. When the distance from the GROUPs relative to the fighters are
approximately the same. GROUPs in AZIMUTH are named using cardinal
directions, as depicted in figure 17.

a. General. The five traditional PICTURE labels for three or more GROUPs are:
WALL, CHAMPAGNE, VIC, BOX, and LADDER. Controllers will use 5 nm of depth
to determine the tactical relationship between GROUPs. WALL is the label used if
depth is equal to or less than 5 nm or CLOSING inside of 5 nm. CHAMPAGNE or
VIC is the label used if the depth is greater than 5 nm or OPENING outside 5 nm.

b. WALL. THREE GROUPs or more separated in AZIMUTH.
(1) WIDE. The term WIDE, prefaced with distance in nm, is used to describe the
dimension of a WALL.
(2) THREE GROUPS.
(a) The outer GROUP names are the cardinal direction relative to the defined
THREAT axis. For example, EAST GROUP and WEST GROUP.
(b) The inner GROUP is named MIDDLE GROUP, as depicted in figure 19.
(c) In a WEIGHTED WALL PICTURE, a separation distance will be
communicated from the priority, anchored GROUP to the next closest
GROUP.
Figure 19. Three GROUP WALL 
(3) Five GROUPs or Less.
(a) The outer GROUP names are the cardinal direction relative to the defined
THREAT axis. For example, EAST GROUP and WEST GROUP.
(b) The inner GROUPs are named MIDDLE GROUPs.
(c) A cardinal direction is added to multiple MIDDLE GROUPs so each has a
unique GROUP name. For example, NORTH MIDDLE GROUP, MIDDLE
GROUP, and SOUTH MIDDLE GROUP, as depicted in figure 20.

17. A LEADING EDGE PICTURE
a. The LEADING EDGE is defined based on which GROUPs the fighters expect to
employ on an intercept.
Note: this depth is mission design series (MDS) and type, model, and/or series (T/M/S) 
specific and must be discussed in mission planning. 
b. LEADING-EDGE communication is applied:
(1) When all GROUPs in an operating area do not fit a traditional label.
(2) To minimize the radio transmission when communicating complicated
PICTURES.
(3) To facilitate rapid targeting of priority GROUPs.
c. If LEADING EDGE communication is not appropriate, fighters and controllers can
relay the PICTURE using core information.
d. The following is the LEADING EDGE communication format.
(1) The controller should communicate the total number of GROUPs prior to
communicating LEADING EDGE.
(2) A traditional PICTURE label will follow LEADING EDGE.
(3) The controller should label the PICTURE based on which GROUPs are
expected to be targeted in the upcoming fighter attack (e.g., fighter recommit).
e. Follow-on GROUPs will be communicated using WAVE communication. WAVES
are coordinated tactics between threat formations operating with defense-in-depth.
Waves are differentiated from packages by their depth component.
(1) The closest GROUP(s) behind the LEADING EDGE will be labeled as the
SECOND WAVE.
(2) WAVES will be numbered numerically (i.e., SECOND WAVE, THIRD WAVE,
etc.).
(3) The SECOND WAVE and any subsequent WAVES will also be given
traditional labels, as depicted in figure 26.

ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
(5) The separation to the SECOND WAVE will be the shortest distance between
the LEADING EDGE and the SECOND WAVE, along the threat axis.
(6) When using WAVE communication, the controller should only provide
information that is tactically relevant to facilitate targeting and flow decisions for
the fighters on the current attack based on communication time available.
(7) Controllers should strive to communicate WAVES maneuvering with
“REFORMING,” “RECOMMITTING,” and “PASSING” communication if
applicable.
WAVES PASSING Example 
“FOCUS SECOND WAVE PASSING FIRST WAVE.” 
18. PACKAGE PICTURE Labeling
a. Define bounding limits in mission planning. Some considerations should include:
(1) Bounding limits can be determined based on geographic separation. For
example, if executing multi-lane, defensive counterair and the controller is
operating in one lane, the controller does not discuss GROUPs in the other lane.
(2) Elements operating outside the predetermined bounding range are not
considered operating in a common formation.
PACKAGE Example 
“GOLIATH, TWO PACKAGES AZIMUTH SIXTY, NORTH PACKAGE BULLSEYE 
0-3-0/45, SOUTH PACKAGE BULLSEYE 1-1-0/55.”
b. Within each PACKAGE, there may be a PICTURE that can be labeled.
PACKAGE with a PICTURE Example 
“CHALICE, NORTH PACKAGE, TWO GROUPS RANGE TEN, TRACK WEST. 
LEAD GROUP BULLSEYE 0-4-5/35, TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND, HOSTILE, 
TWO CONTACTS. TRAIL GROUP FIFTEEN THOUSAND, HOSTILE, TWO 
CONTACTS.” 
c. The GROUP name and PACKAGE name are used when referring to GROUPs, if
multiple PACKAGES are being TARGETED.
PACKAGE TARGET Example 
“VIPER 2, TARGET LEAD GROUP NORTH PACKAGE.” 
d. If bounding limits are defined by a known geographic boundary, controllers may
use GEOREF to describe the relationship between PACKAGES.
LANE with Truncated PICTURE Example 
“GOLIATH, NORTH LANE THREE GROUP CHAMPAGNE.” 
19. NEW PICTURE
a. Controllers should maintain original labels unless a new label and names will fix
or better facilitate targeting. If time compressed when combining a range call and a
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
57 
picture, controllers will truncate fill-ins and respond comparatively after targeting 
calls. 
b. Controllers may make an abbreviated NEW PICTURE call inside the targeting
range if it facilitates fighter targeting. Situations where this may apply include, but
are not limited to:
(1) Electromagnetic attack (EA).
(2) Adversary maneuvers.
(3) Newly detected GROUPs.
Abbreviated PICTURE Example 
“BARNYARD, NEW PICTURE, TEN GROUPS, LEADING EDGE THREE 
GROUP CHAMPAGNE.” 
c. If fighters request a PICTURE inside the targeting range (e.g., fighters clear a
merge) controllers should use PICTURE labeling criteria unless the nearest GROUP
meets THREAT criteria.
d. Fighters executing COLD operations will request a PICTURE.
e. The term NEW PICTURE will be used when fighters are HOT.
20. ADDITIONAL, POP-UP, and THREAT GROUPs
a. ADDITIONAL GROUP.
(1) ADDITIONAL GROUP is applied to a GROUP that is newly detected outside
the targeting range or does not fit a traditional label.
(2) An ADDITIONAL GROUP is anchored using BULLSEYE in accordance with
the defined anchoring priorities.
ADDITIONAL GROUP Example 
Controller: “MISER, TWO GROUPS AZIMUTH TWENTY. NORTH GROUP 
BULLSEYE 3-6-0/20, THIRTY-TWO THOUSAND, TRACK WEST, HOSTILE. 
SOUTH GROUP AT BULLSEYE, EIGHT THOUSAND, TRACK EAST, 
HOSTILE.” 
Fighter: “EAGLE 1, ADDITIONAL GROUP BULLSEYE 0-9-0/7, FIVE 
THOUSAND, TRACK WEST, HOSTILE FLANKER.” 
(3) If an ADDITIONAL GROUP is part of the LEADING EDGE and the fighters
are outside the targeting range, the controller should re-label it as a NEW
PICTURE and include the ADDITIONAL GROUP as part of the NEW PICTURE.
(4) If there are multiple ADDITIONAL GROUPs, each ADDITIONAL GROUP is
prefaced with a cardinal direction and/or number (e.g., NORTH ADDITIONAL
GROUP, FIRST ADDITIONAL GROUP).
b. POP-UP GROUP.
(1) If a previously undetected or unreported GROUP appears inside the targeting
range and outside the THREAT range, it is named a POP-UP GROUP.
58 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
(2) A POP-UP GROUP is anchored using BULLSEYE in accordance with the
defined anchoring priorities.
(3) If there are multiple POP-UP GROUPs, each POP-UP GROUP is prefaced
with a cardinal direction and/or number (e.g., WEST POP-UP GROUP, FIRST
POP-UP GROUP).
POP-UP GROUP Example 
Controller: “DARKSTAR, FIRST POP-UP GROUP BULLSEYE 2-7-0/15, FIVE 
THOUSAND, TRACK WEST, BOGEY SPADES. SECOND POP-UP GROUP 
BULLSEYE 3-0-0/20, TEN THOUSAND, TRACK NORTHWEST, BOGEY 
SPADES.” 
c. THREAT GROUP.
(1) If an undetected or unreported GROUP meets briefed THREAT criteria, it is
named a THREAT GROUP. Controllers should use the BRAA format when
issuing a THREAT call to the closest aircraft.
THREAT GROUP Example 
Controller: “RAMBO 2, THREAT GROUP BRAA 2-7-0/13, ONE THOUSAND, 
HOT, HOSTILE.” 
(2) If there are multiple THREAT GROUPS, each THREAT GROUP is prefaced
with a cardinal direction and/or number (e.g., EAST THREAT GROUP, FIRST
THREAT GROUP).

Chapter V 
AIR-TO-AIR INTERCEPT COMMUNICATION 
1. Overview
This chapter establishes a communication format for A/A employment and air intercept 
control. It governs communication fundamentals, format, and integration between 
fighters and controllers, independent of MDS or T/M/S. This chapter is the baseline for 
all A/A communication in training and combat. Service-specific differences are 
annotated. Refer to the following weapons schools for Service-specific tactics and 
employment considerations: 
a. United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE), Fort Novosel,
Alabama.
b. Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1), Marine Corps
Air Station, Yuma, Arizona.
c. Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC), N7 (TOPGUN),
Fallon Naval Air Station, Nevada.
d. United States Air Force Weapons School (USAFWS), Nellis Air Force Base,
Nevada.
Note: For this publication, controller is a general term used to define the individual 
providing tactical control of an intercept or mission. The term fighter is the example used 
throughout this chapter, but this information applies to any aircraft capable of employing 
A/A ordnance. Controller and fighter are used independent of platform or Service. 
2. Communication Cadence by Intercept Phase
a. The A/A communication cadence establishes the flow of information during
different phases of a mission. It ensures fighters receive priority information
transmitted by the controller.
(1) Communication priorities shift between controllers and fighters during
different phases of an intercept.
(2) Priorities shift based on what asset has the most SA to communicate time-
sensitive information.
b. Table 8 outlines the A/A intercept phases and the communication priorities.

3. COMMIT/TARGET Beyond Visual Range
a. COMMIT Criteria.
(1) During mission planning, COMMIT criteria is determined based on the overall
mission objective.
(2) COMMIT criteria considerations are:
(a) Range based (e.g., predetermined range from fighters or a defended
asset).
(b) Location based (e.g., enemy assets affecting a strike route).
(c) Threat based (e.g., only COMMIT against certain aircraft types).
(d) Weapon employment based (e.g., allow fighters to employ at their first
available employment range).
b. COMMIT Authority.
(1) COMMIT authority is derived from the combatant commander and can be
delegated to the MC, TL, FL, or controller based on the theater
SPINS/OPTASKLINK.
(2) If only the MC, TL, or FL retain the COMMIT authority:
(a) The entity with delegated COMMIT authority will COMMIT once COMMIT
criteria has been achieved.
(b) Any entity (e.g., controller) that does not have delegated COMMIT
authority can recommend the COMMIT.
Fighter Authority COMMIT Example 
Controller: “TANGO, TEN GROUPS, GROUP ROCK 2-5-0/45, THIRTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND, TRACK EAST, HOSTILE, RECOMMEND RAPTOR COMMIT.” 
Fighter: “RAPTOR COMMIT.” 
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
61 
(3) If only the controller retains COMMIT authority:
(a) The controller should direct the COMMIT once COMMIT criteria has been
met.
(b) The MC or TL may only recommend COMMIT.
Controller Authority COMMIT Example 
Fighter: “RAPTOR 1, RECOMMEND COMMIT.” 
Controller: “TANGO, TEN GROUPS, GROUP ROCK 2-5-0/45, THIRTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND, TRACK EAST, HOSTILE, RAPTOR COMMIT.” 
Fighter: “RAPTOR 1.” 
(4) Two-way communication between the fighters and controller is required when
a COMMIT is recommended or directed.
(5) If a COMMIT is directed by the fighter, the controller will transition from pre-
COMMIT communication standards to tactical control and traditional label or
LEADING EDGE PICTURE communication.
Fighter COMMIT Example 
Fighter: “RAPTOR COMMIT.” 
Controller: “TANGO, TEN GROUPS, LEADING EDGE TWO GROUPS AZIMUTH 
FORTY, TRACK EAST. NORTH GROUP ROCK 3-0-0/15, THIRTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND, HOSTILE. SOUTH GROUP ROCK 2-3-0/20, THIRTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND, HOSTILE. FOLLOW-ON GROUP TWENTY-FIVE.” 
4. Tactical (TAC) Range Call
a. Fighters should prebrief the “TAC RANGE” call with controllers.
b. A 60-nm separation from the closest fighter to the closest GROUP is a default.
c. The first to recognize the appropriate separation will make the “TAC RANGE” call
using the closest fighter call sign and the closest GROUP name.
TAC Range Example 
“EAGLE 11, NORTH GROUP TAC RANGE.” 
5. TARGETED
a. Fighters will communicate targeting using the minimum words required while
enabling C2 to verify targeting. A fighter that has called “TARGETED” indicates that
fighter is maintaining awareness of and responsibility for the specified group.
b. With data link between fighters and C2, the only communications required may
be TARGETED and the group label. Without a data link, the targeted call must
include location information, preferably BULLSEYE. Without C2, fighters should use
minimum communications while enabling the FL to verify targeting.

Data link not enabled to C2: “SATAN 2 TARGETED WEST GROUP BULLSEYE 
2-7-0/15.”
c. Fighters may include more information if they desire to update or re-emphasize
information provided by C2 (e.g., more contacts detected, altitude changes,
expected changes to flow or targeting that the FL has not yet communicated). If
including more information, fighters will use the format described in core information
format.
Core Information Format Example 
“RAMBO 2, TARGETED WEST GROUP BULLSEYE 2-7-0/15, TWENTY 
THOUSAND, HOT, HOSTILE, STRENGTH TWO.” 
d. Fighters may combine targeting with shot communication by voicing “FOX” (with
a sort, as appropriate) after “TARGETED.”
TARGETING Examples 
“RAMBO 2, TARGETED, FOX 3 TWO-SHIP WEST GROUP BULLSEYE 
2-7-0/15, TWENTY THOUSAND.”
“RAMBO 2, TARGETED, FOX 3 SORTED EASTERN, WEST GROUP 
BULLSEYE 2-7-0/15, TWENTY THOUSAND, STRENGTH THREE.” 
e. Quality Control (QC) TARGETING. Controllers will respond to targeting calls with
QC comparative communication if fighter targeted communication does not correlate
to known group, match briefed shot doctrine, or to correct fighter misperception. QC
targeting communication updates or corrects core information and fill-ins. If all
information provided by the fighter correlates to information available to the
controller, no response is provided.
QC TARGETING Example 1 
Fighter: “RAMBO 2, TARGETING NORTH GROUP BULLSEYE 2-6-0/20, 
TWENTY THOUSAND.” 
Controller: “VENOM, NORTH GROUP HEAVY, THREE CONTACTS.” 
QC TARGETING Example 2 
Fighter: “RAMBO 4, TARGETED SOUTH GROUP BULLSEYE 2-2-0/15, THIRTY 
THOUSAND.” 
Controller: “RAMBO 4 TARGETED SOUTH MIDDLE GROUP. SOUTH GROUP 
BULLSEYE 2-3-0/18, TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND, HOSTILE, TWO 
CONTACTS.” 
Note: Not all controller platforms can correlate a J12.6 and shot line. Query the 
controlling platform during mission planning to evaluate this contract.

63 
f. C2 contracts for the UNTARGETED fill-in and THREAT calls are canceled if a
fighter calls “TARGETED” on their targeting responsibility with:
(1) A correlated bullseye; or,
(2) A GROUP name and a J12.6 with lock/shot-line that is correlated to or
displayed within 3 nm of the surveillance track. Shots against GROUPS other
than the primary targeting responsibility with no “TARGETED” call do not cancel
C2 contracts.
6. SHOOT
This is directive communication by fighters for missile employment against a specific
GROUP or CONTACT when fighters are targeting another GROUP. This does not
imply BANZAI flow to the GROUP or CONTACT and does not invoke fighter
targeting responsibility.
SHOOT Example 
Fighter: “BOLT 4, SHOOT SOUTHERN SOUTH LEAD GROUP.” 
7. DECLARE
a. A DECLARE call is an interrogative call (i.e., request for information) made by
either the fighters or controller.
b. Use the following communication format when declaring off of BULLSEYE.
(1) Call sign of asset maintaining custody to the GROUP.
(2) The requesting asset’s call sign.
(3) “DECLARE BULLSEYE.”
(4) Position of the group in the BULLSEYE format.
(5) Altitude.
(6) Track direction (only required to discriminate).
DECLARE Request Example 1 
“DARKSTAR, VIPER 1, DECLARE BULLSEYE 2-3-0/12, TWELVE 
THOUSAND.” 
c. When a declaration request is made after the tactical picture has been labeled,
the GROUP name can be used instead of the BULLSEYE location.
DECLARE Request Example 2 
“CHALICE, HORNET 1, DECLARE EAST GROUP.” 
d. DECLARE Response.
(1) Controllers will always respond to a DECLARE request with BULLSEYE,
altitude, track direction, declaration, and fill-ins.
(2) DECLARE responses may include: BOGEY, FRIENDLY, NEUTRAL,
BANDIT, HOSTILE, FURBALL, UNABLE, CLEAN, or VANISHED.
64 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
DECLARE Response Example 
“CHALICE, EAST GROUP BULLSEYE 2-7-3/27, TWENTY-TWO THOUSAND, 
TRACK EAST, BOGEY SPADES.” 
8. HOSTILE Declaration During Shot Communication
a. If a fighter determines a GROUP HOSTILE, and ROE has been met, the fighter
may employ weapons against that GROUP.
b. Fighters should communicate GROUP BULLSEYE, altitude, and HOSTILE in the
shot transmission so other fighters and the controller can correlate to each other.
Fighter Declaration/Shot Communication Example 
“RAPTOR 1, FOX 3 LEAD GROUP BULLSEYE 1-2-5/27, TWENTY-NINE 
THOUSAND, HOSTILE.” 
c. Track direction is included only if it enhances SA.
9. CLEAN
Fighters will call CLEAN if they have no sensor information on a GROUP of interest.
If a fighter calls CLEAN on their targeting responsibility, controllers will provide a full
positional update or respond with CLEAN, FADED, or VANISHED.
CLEAN Example 
“MIKE, EAGLE 11 CLEAN NORTH GROUP.” 
“MIKE, NORTH GROUP BULLSEYE 2-9-0/35, THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND, 
TRACK EAST, HOSTILE.” 
10. GROUP Maneuvers
a. Controllers and fighters are responsible to communicate GROUP maneuvers.
The three components to each maneuver are:
(1) Recognizing the maneuver.
(2) Communicating the relationship of the maneuver.
(3) Updating GROUP names to aid in fighter targeting, as well as GROUP
altitude to include fighter targeting, stacks, change in +/- 5 thousand feet, or a
change in fighter sanitization areas.
b. GROUPs maneuver into ARMs. ARMs maneuver into CONTACTs.
(1) Once a maneuver is recognized, it is communicated using the term
MANEUVER.
(2) If a maneuver direction can be determined, the controller or fighter will update
the maneuver using: own CALL SIGN, GROUP name, and type of maneuver
(e.g., BEAM NORTH or DRAG EAST).
GROUP Maneuver Example 1 
“DARKSTAR, LEAD GROUP BEAM NORTH.” 
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
65 
(3) If a specific aspect is not applicable to all fighters, controllers and fighters
should use the TRACK DIRECTION to describe the maneuver.
GROUP Maneuver Example 2 
“DARKSTAR, LEAD GROUP TRACK NORTH.” 
Note: Maneuvers can drive a NEW PICTURE if it is outside targeting range or during 
COLD operations. 
c. AZIMUTH, RANGE, and SPREAD Maneuvers.
(1) Communicate “MANEUVER SPREAD” if a GROUP maneuvers and all
CONTACTs remain FLANK/HOT. The intent is to communicate that all
CONTACTs are remaining HOT, as depicted in figure 28.
(2) Communicate “MANEUVER RANGE” if a GROUP maneuvers and one
CONTACT remains FLANK/HOT, and at least one CONTACT maneuvers
BEAM/DRAG. The intent is to communicate that at least one CONTACT in the
GROUP is remaining HOT, as depicted in figure 29.
(3) Communicate, “MANEUVER AZIMUTH,” if all CONTACTs BEAM/DRAG with
no CONTACTs remaining FLANK/HOT. The intent is to communicate that no
CONTACTs are remaining HOT, as depicted in figure 30.
(4) Communicate “MANEUVER RANGE AND AZIMUTH” if three or more
CONTACTs maneuver in RANGE and AZIMUTH simultaneously while at least
one CONTACT(S) remains FLANK/HOT, as depicted in figure 31.
(5) Communicate, “MANEUVER AZIMUTH AND RANGE”, if three or more
CONTACTs maneuver in AZIMUTH and RANGE, simultaneously, while the
CONTACT(S) BEAM/DRAG with no CONTACTs remaining FLANK/HOT, as
depicted in figure 32.

(6) As a technique, if a GROUP with three or more CONTACTs maneuvers to a
traditional label (e.g., VIC, WALL, or CHAMPAGNE), controllers may
communicate a NEW PICTURE to simplify targeting.
d. Changing GROUP names relative to targeting range. Fighter timelines will vary
based on MDS and T/M/S and threat capabilities. Prior to any mission, controllers
and fighters should ensure they are referring to the same timeline. If controllers and
fighters are not able to brief each other, the following concepts and timeline
considerations are used as defaults.
(1) Targeting Range. Targeting range refers to the first-time targeting is issued
for any fighter in the element or the term TARGETED is communicated on the
control NET.
(2) Outside Targeting Range. If maneuvers occur outside the targeting range,
controllers may issue a NEW PICTURE.
(3) Inside Targeting Range. If maneuvers occur inside the targeting range,
controllers can choose to:
(a) Update each CONTACT with a new name.
(b) Use UNTARGETED for the highest factor GROUP, ARM, or CONTACT
not being TARGETED.
(c) Issue targeting per the fighters’ targeting game plan.
(d) If it will enhance fighter SA and targeting, controllers (as a technique) may
provide an abbreviated NEW PICTURE.

69 
(4) If multiple GROUPs maneuver outside GROUP criteria, fighters and
controllers should use the new name (e.g., ARM or CONTACT) and the previous
GROUP name (e.g., LEAD GROUP or NORTH GROUP).
ARM Examples 
Multiple NORTH ARMS: “DARKSTAR, NORTH ARM LEAD GROUP TRACK 
NORTH.” 
Single NORTH ARM: “DARKSTAR, NORTH ARM TRACK NORTH.” 
e. When GROUPs maneuver and their positional relationships affect targeting or
flow, use PASSING, CROSSING, or JOINED.
(1) PASSING. PASSING is two or more named GROUPs with a RANGE
relationship maneuver to opposite sides in a RANGE relationship. It is an
informative call using the GROUP names from the original PICTURE, as depicted
in figure 33.
Figure 33. PASSING 
(2) CROSSING. CROSSING is two GROUPs with an AZIMUTH relationship
maneuver to opposite sides in an AZIMUTH relationship. CROSSING is an
informative call using the GROUP names from the original PICTURE, as depicted
in figure 34.

Figure 34. CROSSING 
(3) JOINED. JOINED occurs when two or more named GROUPs maneuver to
meet and maintain GROUP criteria. The new GROUP label should make sense
based on the tactical situation (e.g., based on the new targeting plan), as
depicted in figure 35.
Figure 35. JOINED 
11. BOGEY DOPE/BRAA Request
a. BOGEY DOPE is a request for information relative to ownship position on an
indicated GROUP or closest GROUP (if not indicated) to build/enhance fighter SA.
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
71 
b. If fighters are CLEAN to a GROUP and desire a GROUP location relative to
ownship, they should request a BRAA/BOGEY DOPE to the GROUP.
BRAA Request Example 
“MIKE, EAGLE 11 BRAA NORTH GROUP.” 
“EAGLE 11, NORTH GROUP BRAA 2-1-0/28, THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND, 
HOT, HOSTILE.” 
BOGEY DOPE Request Example 
“MIKE, EAGLE 11 BOGEY DOPE NORTH GROUP.” 
“EAGLE 11, NORTH GROUP BRAA 2-1-0/28, THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND, 
HOT, HOSTILE.” 
c. Controllers will respond using the BRAA format and add appropriate fill-ins.
BOGEY DOPE Example 
“WARRIOR, EAGLE 1 BOGEY DOPE.” 
“EAGLE 1, FIRST ADDITIONAL GROUP BRAA 1-2-0/38, THIRTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND, HOT, HOSTILE.” 
d. BOGEY DOPE does not imply fighter targeting.
12. Electromagnetic Attack (EA)
a. STROBE. Controllers will respond to STROBE calls with range, altitude, aspect
(HOT assumed), declaration, and GROUP name (if applicable) to the closest
GROUP along that line of bearing.
STROBE Example 
Fighter: “RAMBO 1, STROBE 3-6-0” or “RAMBO 1, STROBE LEAD GROUP.” 
Controller: “RAMBO 1, STROBE RANGE THIRTY-SEVEN, TWENTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND, HOSTILE, LEAD GROUP.” 
b. MUSIC.
(1) MUSIC is an informative call that fighters are experiencing radar
electromagnetic deceptive jamming from a GROUP.
(2) Controllers will respond to MUSIC calls by anchoring the GROUP off
BULLSEYE and providing the altitude, track direction, declaration, and fill-ins.
MUSIC Example 
Fighter: “HEAT 1, MUSIC EAST GROUP.” 
Controller: “BARNYARD, EAST GROUP, BULLSEYE 2-1-0/15, TWENTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND, TRACK EAST, HOSTILE, TWO CONTACTS LINE ABREAST 
THREE.” 
Note: If controllers cannot correlate STROBE +/- 30 degrees to a GROUP, they should 
respond with CLEAN. This indicates the contact may be below the controller sensor 
coverage or may be a ground-based jammer. 
72 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
c. METALLICA.
(1) This is an informative call to communicate EA is preventing fighter
employment on a specific GROUP.
(2) Controllers are not required to respond to METALLICA.
(3) METALLICA does not alleviate fighter targeting responsibility for a GROUP.
METALLICA Example 
Fighter: “PYTHON 2, METALLICA LEAD GROUP.” 
13. SPIKE
a. Fighters call SPIKED with a bearing or cardinal/sub-cardinal direction.
(1) The controller should correlate the SPIKE ±30 degrees of the bearing to a
detected GROUP.
(2) If multiple GROUPs correlate, controller should voice the highest priority
GROUP.
(3) Respond with the range, altitude, aspect (HOT assumed), declaration,
GROUP name (if applicable), and fill-ins.
SPIKED Example 1 
Fighter: “EAGLE 1, SPIKED 2-7-0.” 
Controller: “EAGLE 1, SPIKE RANGE 17, THIRTY THOUSAND, HOSTILE EAST 
GROUP, TWO CONTACTS.” 
b. If a controller cannot correlate any GROUP along the aircraft’s SPIKE bearing or
cardinal direction, controllers will respond with CLEAN and the bearing of the SPIKE.
SPIKED Example 2 
Fighter: “EAGLE 1, SPIKED 2-7-0.” 
Controller: “EAGLE 1, WARRIOR CLEAN 2-7-0.” 
14. ENGAGE/MERGE
a. Controllers should refer to fighters as MERGED when the resolution capabilities
of the controller systems become limiting factors or when fighters are within 3–5 nm
of a GROUP, or if a fighter calls ANCHORED (GROUP name) or STANDBY
(GROUP name).
b. Controllers should talk to a MERGED fighter for:
(1) Fighter requests.
(2) THREAT calls.
(3) TRESPASS calls.
(4) STRENGTH disparity (e.g., comparative communication).
(5) Update fighter flow direction to follow on GROUPs (if required).
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
73 
c. ANCHORED or STANDBY calls should include the BULLSEYE location, if the
GROUP does not have a name.
ANCHORED Example 
Fighter: “RAPTOR 1, STANDBY SOUTH GROUP” or “RAPTOR 1, ANCHORED 
BULLSEYE 1-7-0/50.” 
d. SEPARATION.
(1) SEPARATION is a fighter request or C2 enhancing call to provide the
distance (nm) between two GROUPs or WAVEs.
(a) It is used when a fighter is ANCHORED.
(b) SEPARATION request implies it is from the current ANCHORED GROUP
to the requested GROUP, if not specified.
(2) In the SEPARATION response, controllers should use their call sign followed
by the follow-on GROUP or WAVE’s SEPARATION, altitude, and fill-ins.
(3) Controllers may use RANGE SEPARATION or AZIMUTH SEPARATION, if
the tactical relationship between GROUPs changed and the controller did not
have the ability to make a NEW PICTURE call.
15. COLD Operations
a. Fighters should communicate COLD operations with either “FLOW COLD” or
FLOW with a COLD heading.
FLOW Example 
“EAGLE, FLOW COLD.” or “EAGLE, FLOW 0-9-0.” 
b. Communication priorities are as follows:
(1) SPIKES (from unexpected bearing).
(2) RANGE BACK calls.
(a) RANGE BACK is an informative or interrogative call to communicate the
distance (nm) from the closest friendly aircraft to the closest GROUP, ARM,
or CONTACT measured parallel to the fight axis.
(b) Controllers will voice “RANGE BACK” during COLD operations or “launch
and leave” operations once fighters are established COLD.
(c) Controllers will maintain PICTURE labels to the maximum extent to
facilitate fighter targeting.
(3) FADED or POP-UP GROUPs inside of launch and decide targeting depth.
(4) DELOUSE or directive targeting.
(5) PICTURE.
(6) Fighter targeting game plan.
74 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
COLD Operations Example 
Fighter: “DICE FLOW 1-9-0.” 
Controller: “DICE 4, FOCUS, RANGE BACK THIRTY-FIVE ADDITIONAL 
GROUP.” 
Fighter requested RANGE BACK Example 
Fighter: “FOCUS, DEMON 1 SAY RANGE BACK.” 
Controller: “DEMON 2 RANGE BACK SEVENTEEN GROUP BULLSEYE 0-5-
0/20, THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND, TRACK SOUTHWEST, HOSTILE.” 
16. Fighters in Depth
a. Applies when elements are executing an “OUT” and subsequent “IN” or “HOT;”
all communications will comply with the briefed priorities and occur on the primary
frequency.
b. Continue to update the PICTURE with fighters operating in depth, while meeting
the priorities listed below:
(1) Controllers should maintain the original labels unless a new label and names
will fix or better facilitate targeting.
(2) If time is compressed when combining a range call and a PICTURE,
controllers will truncate fill-ins and respond comparatively after targeting calls.
(3) Communication priorities are as follows:
(a) Any SPIKE responses.
(b) PICTURE or BOGEY DOPE to the “IN” or “HOT” element.
(c) Assist in gaining mutual support (as required).
17. THREAT Call
a. If a fighter will pierce the THREAT range to an UNTARGETED GROUP, a
THREAT call is made using the GROUP name, bearing or cardinal/sub-cardinal
direction, range, altitude, and aspect, followed by declaration and fill-ins.
b. The THREAT call is completed no later than threat range.
c. THREAT criteria is defined during mission planning and relayed during the brief
or check-in with the controller.
(1) Controllers should use 35 nm, independent of aspect, as a default THREAT
criteria.
THREAT Example 
Controller: “HEAT 31, ADDITIONAL GROUP THREAT, BRAA 1-2-5/35, THIRTY-
FIVE THOUSAND, HOT, HOSTILE.” 
(2) If the exact fighter location is not known, or the THREAT pertains to multiple
fighters, THREAT information may be provided using BULLSEYE.
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
75 
(a) BULLSEYE will immediately follow the word THREAT.
(b) If a fighter receives a THREAT BULLSEYE call, the fighter should
respond with own call sign.
Note: When communicating with US Army or US Marine Corps rotary-wing aircraft and 
UAS, pass surface threat information in MGRS. Attempt to provide at least a six-digit 
grid. 
THREAT with BULLSEYE Example 
Controller: “COBRA 1, CHALICE, NORTH GROUP THREAT, BULLSEYE 
2-9-5/26, TWENTY THOUSAND, TRACK WEST, HOSTILE.”
(3) When a THREAT is within 5 nm of FRIENDLY fighters, controllers may
provide THREAT information using the cardinal direction, range, altitude, track
direction, and declaration.
THREAT within 5 nm Example 
Controller: “BOLT 1, THREAT NORTH THREE, TEN THOUSAND, TRACK 
SOUTH, HOSTILE.” 
(4) If a fighter calls TARGETED or acknowledges directive targeting, contracts
for UNTARGETED and THREAT calls are cancelled.
d. Cross-court THREAT.
(1) A cross-court THREAT is a GROUP that is TARGETED by one fighter but
meets THREAT criteria to another.
(2) For example, when operating outside a visual formation, the controller may
give a THREAT call to a GROUP that is TARGETED by another fighter within the
element.
(a) Fighters may use the term HEADS UP to other flights or elements when
TARGETED GROUPs maneuver and appear to meet THREAT criteria to the
other flight or element.
(b) Controllers may add TARGETED BY as fill-in information in the THREAT
call, if applicable, as depicted in figure 36.

09 OCT 2024 
Figure 36. Cross-court THREAT Call 
e. Stern weapon engagement zone (WEZ) threat. Threat stern WEZ ranges vary
greatly between enemy missiles and should be specified for each threat platform in
scenario based on current intelligence community assessments. During COLD
operations, fighters in depth, or situations of detached mutual support when a
friendly element indicates a COLD flow (via EXIT, OUT, ABORT, COLD, or FLOW)
in relation to the enemy, the controller will use threat ranges determined during
mission planning.
18. FADED or VANISHED
a. FADED.
(1) If a previously tracked GROUP is not updated by on- or off-board sensors for
30 seconds, a controller will report the GROUP as FADED, as depicted in figure
37.
(2) If a status of the FADED GROUP/CONTACT(S) is requested or if a
“PICTURE/NEW PICTURE” call is made within 1 minute of the fade, controllers
will reference the last sensor return with BULLSEYE position and number of
contacts.  If the contact was continuously tracked by a fighter after the controller
lost contact on the group, the last fighter location will be used in the
“FADED…LAST KNOWN” call. Otherwise, controllers will respond with “CLEAN”
and “[number of] CONTACTs FADED.”

THOUSAND, HOSTILE…SINGLE CONTACT FADED LAST KNOWN 
BULLSEYE 2-8-0/45, TRACK EAST, BEAR.” 
PICTURE Single Contact Fade from Multiple Contact Group 
“VENOM, NORTH GROUP NOW SINGLE CONTACT ONLY. ONE CONTACT 
FADED BULLSEYE 2-7-0/30, TRACK EAST.” 
(3) In response to a PICTURE request, controllers will report “1,” “2,” or “multiple”
contacts FADED, as appropriate.
Figure 37. FADED 
FADED Example 
Fighter: “BARNYARD, PYTHON 1, PICTURE” (requested more than 1 min after 
fade). 
Controller: “BARNYARD, SINGLE GROUP AT BULLSEYE, THIRTY 
THOUSAND, HOSTILE, BARNYARD TWO CONTACTS FADED.” 
Note: Controllers should not anchor a group previously FADED if the elapsed time from 
when the group FADED exceeds 1 minute due to system limitations and degradations in 
sensor SA. 
78 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
(4) Fighters will maintain MONITOR responsibility for the GROUP that has been
voiced “FADED” by controllers, if the fighters can maintain correlation.
Note: FADED will not be used to describe FRIENDLY aircraft. Controllers will use 
NEGATIVE CONTACT to report a lack of sensor data on FRIENDLY aircraft. 
b. NEGATIVE CONTACT. If a friendly aircraft is within a known TAC C2 sensor
blind zone or “NEGATIVE CONTACT” was previously voiced by TAC C2 to a call
sign, any pilot requesting range information (e.g., SPIKE, STROBE, BOGEY DOPE,
etc.) will preface their request with ownship’s BULLSEYE.
NEGATIVE CONTACT EXAMPLE 
Fighter: “BARNYARD, HOSS 01, BOGEY DOPE SOUTH GROUP.” 
Controller: “HOSS 01, BARNYARD, NEGATIVE CONTACT.” 
c. VANISHED. VANISHED is a special case of FADED. If a previously tracked
GROUP is not updated by on- or off-board sensors, a controller will report the
GROUP as VANISHED, if it meets the following criteria:
(1) It is not in a known blind zone (terrain masking or Doppler blind zone).
(2) It is correlated to a shot, by FRIENDLY forces, that meet parameters for
successful termination, as depicted in figure 38.
Figure 38. VANISHED 
Note: In training, when GROUPs are called DEAD by a range training officer (RTO) or a 
GROUP acknowledges a KILL call/KILL removes, controllers will use VANISHED in 
response to DECLARE/STATUS requests and updated PICTURES to prevent 
erroneous targeting. 
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
79 
The RTO should respond to requests on dead aircraft with DEADMAN. If a GROUP has 
alive and dead CONTACTs, update the number of CONTACTs in the GROUP counting 
only those that are alive. 
19. SNAPLOCK
If fighters gain sensor SA to a group inside the THREAT range with BEAM or hotter 
aspect, fighters should make a SNAPLOCK call. 
a. During the SNAPLOCK call, BRAA and aspect are implied due to the reduced
timeline to identify and attrite the threat.
b. The controller should respond to a SNAPLOCK call with the GROUP name,
BRAA, declaration, and fill-ins.
c. If the GROUP was not previously detected, it is named THREAT GROUP.
SNAPLOCK Example 
“FREEDOM 31, SNAPLOCK 1-2-5/10, EIGHT THOUSAND.” 
“FREEDOM 31, THREAT GROUP BRAA 1-2-5/10, EIGHT THOUSAND, HOT, 
HOSTILE, TWO CONTACTS.” 
20. LEAKER
a. A LEAKER is an airborne threat that has passed through a defensive layer.
b. LEAKER can be communicated by fighters or controllers.
c. The entity making the LEAKER call should use own call sign.
LEAKER Example 
VIPER 1: “VIPER 1, LEAKER BULLSEYE 3-0-5/65, FIVE THOUSAND, TRACK 
SOUTH, HOSTILE TWO CONTACTS.” 
21. LANE CROSSERS and LANE RIDERS
a. A LANE CROSSER is a GROUP that maneuvers into different areas of targeting
responsibility.
b. A LANE RIDER is a GROUP that maintains a track direction on or near the line
that divides different areas of targeting responsibility.
c. During mission planning, fighters and controllers should identify whether a LANE
CROSSER/LANE RIDER is TARGETED via integrated fires or, organically, by the
fighters in the lane.
(1) There is increased communication required between the controllers of both
targeting lanes to facilitate fighter targeting or integrated fires.
(2) The controller should use the fill-ins LANE CROSSER/LANE RIDER and
TARGETED BY to describe who is targeting the GROUP.
(3) TARGETED BY fill-ins can be added during the PICTURE call or as a
descriptive update.

LANE RIDER Example 
Example 1, Controller (as a descriptive update): “BLACKOUT, NORTH GROUP 
LANE RIDER TARGETED BY HORNET.” 
Example 2, Controller: “BLACKOUT, NORTH GROUP LANE RIDER TARGETED 
BY NORTH LANE.” 
(4) Fighters in the lanes can direct targeting a LANE CROSSER/LANE RIDER or
the controller or fighters can delegate this targeting authority to the controller.
(5) When operating in a multiple lane construct, the controller should incorporate
LANE CROSSERS and LANE RIDERS in the PICTURE call, as depicted in figure
39.
(6) Controllers in the adjacent lanes may include the same GROUP into their
PICTURE call. Controllers are responsible to coordinate targeting to avoid double
targeting.
Figure 39. LANE RIDER 
22. CMD PICTURE
a. When referring to positively identified cruise missiles, the terms “GROUP” and
“CONTACT” will be replaced with “COVEY” and “QUAIL,” respectively. Use of
“ARM” will remain the same. PICTURE priorities will be briefed in mission planning
and may change based on mission parameters.
b. Inter-covey formation will always be included as core information.
c. If a traditional label does not apply based on the threat presentation, then
controllers should use LEADING EDGE communication with the following changes:
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
81 
(1) The controller should communicate the total number of COVEYs prior to
communicating the LEADING EDGE. The LEADING EDGE comprises all
COVEYs within the mission planned targeting depth.
(2) LEADING EDGE data will include the number of COVEYs, the azimuth and
depth, the geographical relationship mirroring inter-GROUP labels if able, weight,
and the total number of QUAIL, followed by core data to the priority COVEY.
CMD Example 
“BARNYARD, TWO COVEYS RANGE FIFTEEN. LEAD COVEY BULLSEYE 0-3-
2/32, FIVE THOUSAND, HOSTILE, HEAVY, FOUR QUAIL, LINE ABREAST 
FIVE. TRAIL COVEY FOUR THOUSAND, HOSTILE, TWO QUAIL, SWEPT 
NORTHWEST.” 
“BARNYARD, EIGHT COVEYS. TWO WAVES, LEADING EDGE SIX COVEYS, 
TWELVE DEEP, FIFTEEN WIDE, WEDGE, WEIGHTED NORTH. LEAD COVEY 
BULLSEYE 3-3-2/32, FOUR THOUSAND, HOSTILE, SECOND WAVE 
TWENTY.” 
d. A 35-nm separation from the closest fighter to the closest COVEY is the default
tactical range call.
e. CLOSE CONTROL. If a fighter requests CLOSE CONTROL, C2 will direct
vectors to put the fighter on a HOT aspect to the COVEY specified in the request or
the closest COVEY if no COVEY was requested. C2 will provide the COVEY’s
location using the BOGEY DOPE format following the initial vectors. C2 will provide
only bearing and range after subsequent vectors. C2 will transition to tactical control
at the TARGETED call or at the GO TACTICAL call.
CLOSE CONTROL Example 
Fighter: “RAMBO 4, REQUEST CLOSE CONTROL NORTH COVEY.” 
Controller: “RAMBO 4, REFERENCE 0-4-4. NORTH COVEY BRAA 3-1-7/17, 
FOUR THOUSAND FLANK EAST, HOSTILE.” 
Controller: “RAMBO 4, HARD LEFT, REFERENCE 2-8-0. NORTH COVEY 
BRAA 2-8-0/15.” 
Fighter: “RAMBO 4, TARGETED NORTH COVEY, FOUR THOUSAND.”

Chapter VI 
AIR-TO-SURFACE COMMUNICATION 
1. Overview
This chapter establishes a communication format for air-to-surface (A/S) employment. It 
governs communication fundamentals, format, and integration between aircraft and 
controllers, independent of MDS or T/M/S. For interflight communication, refer to the 
appropriate MDS- or T/M/S-specific manual. Refer to the following weapons schools for 
Service-specific tactics and employment considerations: 
a. USAACE, Fort Novosel, Alabama.
b. MAWTS-1, Marine Corps Air Station, Yuma, Arizona.
c. NAWDC, N7 (TOPGUN), Fallon Naval Air Station, Nevada.
d. USAFWS, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.
Note: For this publication, controller is a general term used to define the individual 
providing tactical control of an intercept or mission. The term aircraft is a general term 
for air assets executing an A/S mission. Controller and aircraft are used independent of 
platform or Service. 
2. A/S Tasking Serialization
A/S taskings are passed from controllers to aircraft. During a high operation tempo, 
multiple A/S taskings may be passed. Therefore, it is advantageous to use serialization. 
Serialization is a system for assigning unique codes to simplify communication. It can 
use letters, numbers, or symbols to identify a large set of information. Serialization is 
applied to each task in the order of creation and does not imply priority or confidence. 
a. Plan for the mission to include the A/S tasking serialization technique.
b. The labeling convention should use the ATO day and two-digit numeric
sequencing. For example:
(1) AA01 is the first task of ATO day AA.
(2) This designator should precede the tasking message.
(3) Digital messages should end with “EOM” meaning “end of message.” This
indicates receipt of all digital message data (e.g., “[aircraft call sign] AA01
[tasking message text] EOM”).
3. A/S Tasking Format
A/S taskings can be passed as full or partial digital or voice. 
a. Taskings should pass the minimum information required to accomplish the
mission safely and efficiently.
b. Taskings should include the following information, when applicable.
(1) Call sign of the tasked asset.
84 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
(2) Task type (e.g., TARGET, INVESTIGATE, or SMACK). See table 5 for data
link mission assignments (page 11).
(3) Link 16 track number and target description.
(4) Desired point of impact (DPI) in the requested format or formatted in
accordance with the SPINS (e.g., MGRS or latitude (DDMM.MMM), longitude
(DDDMM.MMM), elevation (mean sea level or height above ellipsoid)).
(5) Target location error (TLE) or categories (CATs) 1–6. This segment may be
repeated for targets with more than one DPI.
(6) Quantity (Q), number (N), and application [per (P) or total (T)] for each DPI.
Per (P) is used with multiple DPI target sets and total (T) is used if only one DPI
is shown.
(7) Remarks. These can include mission priority, additional target description for
INVESTIGATE or TARGET tasks, and coordinating data for other missions
assigned to the package (i.e., BULLSEYE for escort).
c. Taskings may be passed in the description, location, elevation,
remarks/restrictions (DLER) format, as depicted in table 9.
Table 9.  Description, Location, Elevation, 
Remarks/Restrictions (DLER) Attack Briefing Format 
Information 
Description 
Description 
May include target type, size, description, and 
other amplifying data. 
Location 
Format must be compatible with the receiving 
asset system. Options include Global Area 
Reference System, latitude and longitude, talk-
ons, and BULLSEYE. 
Elevation 
Given in feet mean sea level. 
Remarks/Restrictions 
Include deconfliction measures, ordnance, 
final attack heading, and time on target (TOT) 
windows, as required. List restrictions. 
4. Full Digital Taskings (J28.2 and J12.0 Tasking Against J3.X Track)
a. If a response is desired, controllers should start the tasking process by
communicating CHECK DATA.
b. J28.2 is the assumed data source unless the controller specifies another.
Full Digital Tasking Example 
Controller: “BONE 1, STRIKESTAR, CHECK DATA, ALPHA ALPHA 0-1.” 
J28.2 message: BE01//AA01//TGT//160/10//JS010//TANKS//CAT4//EOM 
Aircraft: “STRIKESTAR, BONE 1, GOOD DATA, ALPHA ALPHA 0-1.” 
Controller: “BONE 1, COMEBACK WITH ETA, TOT, AND BDA.” 
09 OCT 2024 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
85 
c. Controllers should use all available J-series messages, even if the tasked asset is
TIMBER SOUR or not Link 16 capable. This serves to increase force package SA on
the operating area taskings.
5. Full Voice Taskings
Full Voice Tasking Example 
Controller: “HORNET 1, SABRE, TARGET TASKING TO FOLLOW. TARGET 
SET IS THREE VEHICLE CONVOY EASTBOUND, QUADRANT ONE IN THE 
VICINITY OF MAIN SUPPLY ROUTE EVERGREEN/ASR ATLANTIC 
INTERSECTION, 11S QR 123 456, ELEVATION 150 FEET MSL, REMAIN IN 
QUADRANT ONE.” 
Aircraft: “HORNET 1, COPIES 11S QR 123 456, 150 FEET, THREE VEHICLE 
CONVOY EASTBOUND, REMAIN IN QUADRANT ONE.” 
Controller: “HORNET 1, READBACK CORRECT. CONFIRMED ENEMY TANKS 
IN THE OPEN. COME BACK WITH ETA, TOT, AND BDA.” 
6. Partial Digital Taskings (Voice and J12.0 Tasking Against J3.X Track)
a. For taskings with a J3.3 or J3.5 message only, use a modified voice format.
Partial Digital Tasking Example 
Controller: “HOSS 1, SABRE, TASK ALPHA ALPHA 0-1. TARGET BULLSEYE 
1-6-0/10, TRACK NUMBER JS010, CAT IV. CALL READY REMARKS.”
Aircraft: “HOSS 1, CAPTURED JS010. READY REMARKS ALPHA ALPHA 0-1.”
Controller: “HOSS 1, CONFIRMED ENEMY TANKS IN THE OPEN, COME 
BACK WITH ETA, TOT, AND BDA.” 
b. If a tasked asset is HOLLOW for the J3.3 or J3.5 message, pass full voice
tasking.
7. Read Backs
Theater or exercise guidance should specify the required read back. In the absence of 
direction, the following read-back formats for full and partial digital and voice are listed 
from least restrictive and least radio time to the most restrictive and most radio time. 
a. WILCO digital response to J12.0.
b. Voice response with task type and location (e.g., BULLSEYE, J3.5 track number,
or coordinates).
c. Voice response with task type, coordinates, elevation, and remarks.
8. Ground/Surface Threat Picture Communication
a. Common Tactical Ground Picture. The signals intelligence (SIGINT) ID authority
is responsible for maintaining accuracy of the common tactical ground picture based
on emitter or ROTATOR information as well as resolving any emitter ID ambiguities.
(1) Radar type at locations should be primary (e.g., SCRUM HALF,
TOMBSTONE) for strike aircraft.
86 
ATP 3-52.4/MCRP 3-20F.10/NTTP 6-02.9/AFTTP 3-2.8 
09 OCT 2024 
(2) Refer to SAM systems by their number only (e.g., SIX or ROLAND) to
preserve brevity on the tactical NET.
(3) Voice full SAM system name only if required to eliminate ambiguity (e.g., “S-
A-(number)” or “H-Q-(number)”).
(4) System status terminology may include but is not limited to the following:
(a) AWAKE. This describes land or surface activity detected via
communications intelligence.
(b) ACTIVE. This means the emitter is radiating (derived from electronic
intelligence).
(c) OCCUPIED. This means ground equipment at tasked target location.
(d) VACANT. This means ground equipment is not present at specific or
tasked target location.
Note: Assume all threat emitters only remain ACTIVE/AWAKE for short periods and, 
therefore, only report DOWN (previously active, but no longer emitting) or ASLEEP in 
response to a status request or to eliminate ambiguity. 
(e)
REPORTED. Use this if a threat emitter is derived from an off-board
source.
(5) COLOR and TAG.
(a) COLOR calls will have the requesting agency’s call sign, COLOR
system/subsystem type, frequency, and location (if known), and fill-ins.
(b) Transmit a J14.0 with every COLOR call.
(c) Respond to a COLOR call with TAG. Use comparative communication for
TAG responses, providing the mission information or tactical report
(TACREP) for the emitter, if appropriate.
COLOR and TAG Example 
Known Frequency (freq): “CHALICE, COLOR MIPPLE FREQ 10 thousand 300 
MEGAHERTZ, BULLSEYE 1-2-3/30” (CHALICE FORCE TELL associated 
J14.0). 
Unknown Freq: “CHALICE, COLOR BULLSEYE 1-2-3/30.” 
Response: “AGENT, TAG TOMBSTONE BULLSEYE 1-2-3/30.” 
(6) TACREP.
(a) Transmit TACREPs on voice product networks (VPNs) indicating the
collection of tactical intelligence.
(b) Assign TACREPs an alphanumeric designator indicating the type of
activity and serialization.
(c) Use the phrase “UPDATE TACREP” to provide updated or amplifying
information on an existing TACREP.
(d) Ensure alphanumeric designators are in accordance with table 10.

b. Situation Report (SITREP). Pass SIGINT, imagery intelligence, and moving target
indication information on surface emitters on VPN.
(1) The SITREP is passed 5 minutes prior to the package LOWDOWN unless
mission planning directs otherwise.
(2) Emitters are passed using system type (e.g., BIG BIRD, LOW BLOW),
BULLSEYE location, and operating frequency in the following priority:
(a) Air activity and location, in absence of an air PICTURE (e.g., controller
system is degraded).
(b) ACTIVE/AWAKE LRAD SAMs that were not a part of the briefed enemy
order of battle.
(c) ACTIVE/AWAKE MRAD SAMs that were not a part of the briefed enemy
order of battle.
(d) Any ACTIVE/AWAKE (or within the last hour) SHORAD/tactical SAMs.
(e) Early warning or ground control intercept radars.
Note: The order of dissemination for ACTIVE/AWAKE SAMs is as follows: closest MEZ 
to friendly forces, closest MEZ to friendly axis of attack or ingress routes, and most 
lethal.

SITREP Example 
“AGENT, SU-27 AIRBORNE TONOPAH. [SYSTEM NAME] ACTIVE BULLSEYE 
1-2-1/20, FREQ [X-X-X-X-X], TRACK NUMBER 0-6-0-2-3. [SYSTEM NAME]
AWAKE BULLSEYE 1-3-5/40, TRACK NUMBER 0-6-0-0-4. AWAKE BULLSEYE
1-2-5/35, TRACK NUMBER 0-6-0-3-7. TALL KING ACTIVE BULLSEYE 0-9-0/6
FREQ [X-X-X-X-X].”
c. Combat Advisory Broadcast (CAB). Active S/A threat emitters are passed on the
tactical NET using prebriefed labels or the BULLSEYE format.
(1) CAB is an addition to the threat picture.
(2) C2 agencies will relay CAB information received from VPN to the appropriate
NETs.
CAB Example 
CAB from BANDSAW on primary NET: “BANDSAW, TWO ACTIVE BULLSEYE 
0-3-5/8” or “BANDSAW, NORTH TWO ACTIVE.”
d. Imminent Threat Warning (ITW). ITW is a S/A threat warning to a friendly asset.
(1) An ITW is passed when a friendly aircraft is within 5 nm of the maximum
recommended intercept range of any ACTIVE, AWAKE, launching, or firing
threat.
(2) An ITW is prefaced with the aircraft call sign or the BULLSEYE position of the
friendly aircraft and uses prebriefed labels or the BULLSEYE format for the threat
description.
Note: When communicating with US Army or US Marine Corps rotary-wing aircraft and 
UASs, pass surface threat information in MGRS, if known. Attempt to provide at least a 
six-digit grid. 
(3) No ITW is required if an aircraft has reported MUD, DEFENDING, or SINGER
to the specified threat, or the pre-planned mission directs asset into active WEZ.
(4) ITW procedures are coordinated for low-observable assets during mission
planning.
ITW Example 
“EAGLE 1, AGENT, LOW BLOW ACTIVE BULLSEYE 0-1-5/9.” 
e. TRESPASS. Aircraft, controllers, and agencies will voice TRESPASS when an
aircraft is within a not-previously-known SAM MEZ (e.g., a POP-UP SAM) or any
non-suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) team aircraft crosses inside the
maximum recommended intercept range of any known SAM. The voicing entity will
direct a SNAP heading 180 degrees away from the SAM and voice the SAM’s
bullseye, being directive then descriptive.
TRESPASS Example 
“RAMBO 2, SNAP 1-7-0, TRESPASS FIFTEEN BULLSEYE 3-2-0/32.”

9. Threat Reaction Communication
a. Targeted aircraft should communicate S/A threat reactions on mission tactical
NETs:
(1) If it enables, or aircraft requires, reactive SEAD.
(2) To enhance the common tactical picture for other mission or package assets.
b. These transmissions should be in either a low- or high-fidelity format. Minimum
accuracy to consider a threat “high fidelity” is a 5 nm, semi-major ellipse, or as
mission planned.
Low-Fidelity Format 
Call sign, radar warning receiver indication, bearing, DEFENDING with cardinal 
direction, ownship BULLSEYE. 
Low-Fidelity Example 
“HORNET 1, SINGER ELEVEN, BEARING 3-6-0, DEFENDING WEST, 
BULLSEYE 
3-4-5/30.”
High Fidelity Format 
Call sign, radar warning receiver indication, S/A threat BULLSEYE/LOCATION, 
DEFENDING with cardinal direction. 
High Fidelity Example 
“BOLT 1, SINGER ELEVEN, BULLSEYE 3-6-0/32, DEFENDING WEST.” 
10. SEAD Contracts
a. SEAD aircraft should provide one of four responses to a DEFENDING call:
(1) HARM INBOUND. High-speed antiradiation missile (HARM) already
employed.
(2) MAGNUM. Launch of FRIENDLY antiradiation missile (ARM).
(3) EMPTY. No emitters of interest detected.
(4) ARIZONA. No ARM ordnance remaining.
(5) CANYON. Use electromagnetic jamming on radar frequency indicated or in
accordance with previous orders or information call for execution EA list or EA
against designated group.
b. SNIPER and SLAPSHOT Communication.
(1) SNIPER.
(a) This is a directive call from the SEAD package/FL.
(b) It indicates a specific aircraft/element should employ an ARM against a
range-known S/A threat.

SNIPER Example 
Directive Call: “STORM, SNIPER ELEVEN BULLSEYE 3-6-0/32.” 
Response: “STORM 2, MAGNUM ELEVEN BULLSEYE 3-6-0/32.” 
(2) SLAPSHOT.
(a) This is a directive call indicating an aircraft or element should immediately
employ the best available ARM on the specified threat bearing.
(b) SLAPSHOT assumes the S/A threat range is unknown.
SLAPSHOT Example 
Directive Call: “STORM, SLAPSHOT FIFTEEN BEARING 3-1-7.” 
Response: “STORM 2, HARM INBOUND.” 
(3) SEAD players respond with HARM INBOUND, MAGNUM, EMPTY, or
ARIZONA.
c. EA Communication. Aircraft should direct or communicate EA using the following
terminology:
EA Examples 
Directing EA: “BOLT 1, JAM ELEVEN, BULLSEYE 3-6-0/32.” 
Informative EA: “BOLT 1, CANYON ELEVEN, BULLSEYE 3-6-0/32.” 
Ceasing EA: “BOLT 1, CLAM ELEVEN, BULLSEYE 3-6-0/32.” 
11. Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess (F2T2EA) Contracts
a. Find. The MC is responsible to hold or delegate authority for aircraft or element
search contracts.
Find Example 
MC: “BOLT, WORK SIX BULLSEYE 3-6-0/34.” 
Aircraft: “BOLT 1, WORKING SIX BULLSEYE 3-6-0/34.” 
MC: “HOSS, MAP FIFTEEN BULLSEYE 3-1-7/17.” 
Aircraft: “HOSS 3, MAPPING FIFTEEN BULLSEYE 3-1-7/17.” 
MC: “CONAN, INVESTIGATE TRACK NUMBER 1-2-3-4-5.” 
Aircraft: “CONAN.” 
b. Fix.
(1) Locate the threat and pass TLE or ellipse (semi-major) quality with the FIXED
call.
(2) Use the following terms to delineate fix quality:
(a) Low Accuracy. Inside 1 nm.
Low Accuracy Example 
“BOLT 1, SIX FIXED BULLSEYE 3-6-0/32, LOW ACCURACY.” 
(b) High Accuracy. Inside 1,000 feet.

91 
High Accuracy Example 
“AGENT 6, FIXED BULLSEYE 3-6-0/32, HIGH ACCURACY, TRACK NUMBER 
0-3-0-0-7.”
(c) TARGETABLE. CAT II low is assumed.
• Any other TLE is added as a fill-in.
• Controllers should populate a J3.5 over individual J12.6s once they
are called TARGETABLE.
• Controllers should report “HOLLOW [BULLSEYE]” if they do not hold
the J12.6.
Targetable Examples 
“HOSS 3, FIXED SCRUM HALF BULLSEYE 3-1-7/17, TARGETABLE.” 
“AGENT, SCRUM HALF BULLSEYE 3-1-7/17, TARGETABLE, TRACK 
NUMBER 1-6-1-7-3.” 
c. TRACK.
(1) TRACKING is necessary for custody of a threat, SAM, high-value target, or
other surface entity.
(2) The MC or TL can direct an asset to TRACK, SCAN, or MONITOR an area or
object.
(a) TRACK. This is a directive call assigning responsibility to maintain
sensors or a visual on a defined object or area to an asset.
(b) MONITOR.
• Maintain sensor awareness on a specified GROUP or object. It
implies tactically significant changes are communicated.
• For maritime operations, it means maintain contact or targeting
information on a maritime surface contact.
(c) SCAN. Search the indicated sector and report any CONTACTs.
(3) Assets can respond with OCCUPIED, TALLY, TRACKING, CAPTURED, or
MONITORING, if able to TRACK.
TALLY Example 
MC: “HOSS, TRACK THREE VEHICLE CONVOY BULLSEYE 3-0-0/45, 
MOVING WEST, TRACK NUMBER 3-4-3-4-5.” 
Aircraft: “HOSS 1, TALLY.” 
CAPTURED Example 
MC: “SABRE, TRACK T-72 COLUMN BULLSEYE 0-5-0/55, MOVING NORTH.” 
Aircraft: “SABRE, CAPTURED, TRACK NUMBER 2-2-2-2-2.”

MONITORING Example 
MC: “WEASEL 51, MONITOR ELEVEN, TRACK NUMBER 1-1-1-1-1.” 
Aircraft: “WEASEL 51, MONITORING ELEVEN, BULLSEYE 3-1-6/60.” 
(4) Assets can respond with NO JOY if they have not found the object.
d. TARGET and Attack Plan.
(1) The purpose of the ATTACK plan is to:
(a) Establish a SORT, especially across multiple formations.
(b) To establish weapon pairings.
(c) Reference locations (e.g., predetermined points, anchor references with
distance, or BULLSEYE).
(d) Time and deconfliction prior to PUSHING as a force package.
(2) This plan should also delineate responsibilities.
Note: The plan can be communicated via Link 16, and each player needs only to 
acknowledge GOOD DATA. 
Attack Game Plan Example 
In the following example, RAMBO is the MC and escort TL, HORNET is the strike 
TL, BOLT is a strike FL, and PYTHON is the SEAD TL. 
RAMBO (MC): “HORNET, BOLT, PYTHON, STANDBY GAME PLAN.” 
FLs: “HORNET.” “BOLT.” “PYTHON.” 
RAMBO: “HORNET, TARGET AND SCAN ALPHA ALPHA 0-1, TWO VEHICLE 
CONVOY BULLSEYE 2-7-5/69, MOVING SOUTH, BEST. PUSH AT 
21:17 FROM RED OSCAR.” 
“BOLT, COVER ALPHA ALPHA 0-1.” 
“RAMBO ESCORT AND PYTHON SEAD PER BRIEF.” 
FLs: “HORNET.” “BOLT.” “PYTHON.” 
e. Engage.
(1) The aircraft executing the attack will call PUSHING at the push, with a TOT,
once all players have acknowledged the plan.
(2) Aircraft should call releases with time of flight and IMPACT, when able. If an
aircraft has additional support requirements for the A/S weapon, provide this as a
fill-in (e.g., LASING or SCANNING).
PUSHING Example 
“HORNET, CAPTURED ALPHA ALPHA 0-1. PUSHING TOT 21:21:15.” 
“HORNET 1, ONE WEAPON AWAY ALPHA ALPHA 0-1, 45 SECONDS, 
LASING.” 
“HORNET 1, SPLASH ALPHA ALPHA 0-1.”

f. Assess.
(1) SCAN can be used to direct the weapon effects assessment.
(a) SCAN means to search the indicated sector and report any CONTACTs.
(b) Once the target or object has been acquired and is being tracked with an
onboard sensor or visually, respond with CAPTURED or TALLY.
(c) If unable to find the target or object, relay VACANT, EMPTY, or NO JOY.
(2) To describe the weapon results, use successful or unsuccessful.
(a) SUCCESSFUL. Desired weapon effects were generated.  SUCCESSFUL
can be used to complete the F2T2EA chain.
• DROPPING is an informative call from a tasked aircraft that the
aircrew is no longer TARGETING/TARGETED to a tasking.
Weapons Effects Generated (DROPPING) Example 
HORNET: “HORNET, SPLASH ALPHA ALPHA 0-1 SUCCESSFUL. DROPPING 
ALPHA ALPHA 0-1.” 
• DROP is a directive call to remove a ground target from the tactical
ground picture.
Weapons Effects Generated (DROP) Example 
HORNET: “HORNET, SPLASH ALPHA ALPHA 0-1 SUCCESSFUL.” 
HORNET: “DARKSTAR, DROP ALPHA ALPHA 0-1, T-N 5-2-3-4-2.” 
(b) FUMBLE. Desired weapon effects were not generated.
• Informative fill-ins can assist when relaying UNSUCCESSFUL.
• “FUMBLE CLEAN” (i.e., no visible battle damage) indicates the target
sustained no damage or no weapon impact was noted.
• “FUMBLE HIT” indicates weapon impact was noted within a lethal
distance, but the effects were not generated.
Weapons Effects Not Generated Example 
HORNET: “HORNET, SPLASH ALPHA ALPHA 0-1, FUMBLE HIT.” 
(3) Reattack.
(a) Plan reattack options during mission planning, if an asset is capable of a
real-time hit assessment.
(b) To facilitate rapid reattack, consider using SCAN with COVER.
• COVER. This is a directive call to be ready for reattack or reengage,
if weapons effects are not generated.
• HOUNDDOG. This call is in response to COVER, indicating the
directed aircraft is in a position to employ weapons.
