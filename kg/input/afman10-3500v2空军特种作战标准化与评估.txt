Chapter 1 
 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
 
1.1. Overview. This manual establishes the Stan/Eval program for all AFSPECWAR Airmen. It 
establishes requirements for evaluations and outlines grading criteria. This instruction also 
provides specific and amplifying guidance to AFMAN 11-202V2 when AFSPECWAR operators 
function as aircrew. 
 
1.1.1. The purpose of the AFSPECWAR Stan/Eval program is to provide commanders with 
a tool to ensure members possess the knowledge and skills consistent with the requirements 
of their assigned duties and the ability to manage the risks of AFSPECWAR operations, thus 
functioning as an effective operator within their skill level and qualifications. 
 
1.1.2. The AFSPECWAR Stan/Eval program provides commanders with the means to 
document individual member qualifications, feedback on the effectiveness of unit training 
programs and mission execution and ensure a quality control function with clearly defined 
roles and responsibilities that are objective and effective. 
 
1.1.3. This program supports the AF’s on-the-job training (OJT) program under DAFMAN 
36-2689, Training Program, with an evaluation model successfully employed by the aircrew 
enterprise under AFMAN 11-202V2 with modifications to fit the air/ground integration 
evaluation requirements for AFSPECWAR. 
 
1.2. Objectives. 
 
1.2.1. Provide a system to assess and document members’ capability to accomplish assigned 
AFSPECWAR duties. 
 
1.2.2. Develop and ensure standardization of operational procedures for weapon system 
employment via recommendations of improvements to training programs, lesson plans, 
standard operating procedures, and directives based on performance and evaluation results. 
1.2.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate operational, training, and administrative 
directives. 
 
1.2.4. Evaluate and revise operational directives, procedures, and techniques as required. 
 
1.2.5. Recognize and analyze trends and recommend/initiate changes to training programs 
and directives. 
 
1.2.6. Provide procedures, standards, and programmatic guidance across AFSPECWAR. 
 
1.2.7. Ensure continuity and mission capability by establishing inter-command standards. 
 
1.3. Key Terms and Definitions. For the purposes of this manual: 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
 
7 
 
1.3.1. AFSPECWAR Operator. The term AFSPECWAR operator is restricted to members 
who hold a 1ZXXX or 19ZXX AFSC, not the overarching AFSPECWAR enterprise. 
 
1.3.2. Operations Group (OG). OG is used as a generic term that includes Air Support 
Operations Groups, Rescue Groups, Special Operations Groups, Special Tactics Groups, and 
the Special Warfare Training Group. 
 
1.3.3. Unit. The term unit includes levels of organization under higher headquarters (HHQ) 
required to establish a Stan/Eval function. Most units are composed of an OG and 
AFSPECWAR squadrons or detachments. Where there is no parent Group, 
squadrons/detachments assume duties listed for Groups. 
 
1.3.4. Formal Training Units (FTUs). FTUs are the Guardian Angel (GA) FTU (68th Rescue 
Squadron), the Special Tactics Training Squadron, and the TACP FTU (6th Combat 
Training Squadron, Detachment 2). 
 
1.3.5. Tactical Enlisted Leader. A Tactical Enlisted Leader is an enlisted AFSPECWAR 
operator who has completed the Tactical Enlisted Leader upgrade in accordance with the 
respective AFS Career Field Education and Training Plan, FTU syllabus, or HHQ Tactical 
Enlisted Leader Qualification Training Package. 
 
1.3.6. Certification. Certification is the procedure used to document competency in a 
particular task following the completion of a Syllabus of Instruction or training course. It is 
documented on a DAF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training (OJT) Record Continuation Sheet; 
or DAF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS. Certification is 
not interchangeable with qualification, which requires documentation on an AF Form 1035, 
AFSPECWAR Evaluation Form. 
 
1.3.7. Qualification. Qualification/Qualified is a designation arising from graduating an 
approved course or a successful evaluation, documented on an AF Form 1035, that allows a 
member to perform specified duties.

MAJCOM. (T-2) 
 
4.5. SPOT Evaluation. An evaluation of a specific task or group of tasks from Table A4.1, Table 
A7.1, or AFSC specific Career Field Education and Training Plan. 
 
4.5.1. Purpose. SPOT evaluations are used to evaluate individual skills or qualifications (e.g., 
Technical Rescue/Rigger Operations, AFSPECWAR INSTR, Alternate Insertion Extraction 
Master, etc.). A SPOT evaluation may be used to initially qualify a Tactical Enlisted Leader 
upon Qualification Training Package completion. Provided all MSN evaluation criteria in Table 
A4.1 are met, and a Qualification Level 1 (Q1) grade is given, the SPOT evaluation can be dual 
credited as an MSN evaluation, restarting the 24-month evaluation window. To document dual 
credit, select “SPOT” and “MSN” in part II of AF Form 1035. Should the member fail the 
SPOT evaluation it will not affect Combat Mission Ready status, and they will remain current in 
their previously held position.  
 
4.5.2. Execution. A SPOT evaluation may be conducted at any time. 
 
4.5.2.1. SPOT evaluations may be No-Notice (N/N). However, personnel receiving an 
N/N SPOT evaluation must be notified that they are being evaluated prior to the start of 
the evaluated task(s) or event(s). (T-2) 
 
4.5.2.2. Areas found to be substandard will be documented utilizing guidance in 
Chapter 5. (T-3) Additional training in the substandard task(s) will be given and an RQ 
SPOT evaluation is required to re-qualify/certify the member on the failed task(s). (T-3) 
 
4.5.2.3. Any task requiring an evaluation, other than CB, MSN, and INSTR, will be 
documented as a SPOT evaluation. 
 
4.6. Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes are used, when applicable, to further describe 
the evaluations listed in this chapter: 
 
4.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, except SPOT, (e.g., INIT CB, INIT 
MSN, INIT INSTR). 
 
4.6.1.1. INIT CB Evaluation. INIT CB evaluations will be accomplished utilizing 
guidance in AFMAN 10-3500V1 upon completion of Initial Qualification Training 
(IQT), arrival at the first operational duty station, and additional requirements utilizing 
guidance in MAJCOM approved lesson plans or syllabus of instructions. (T-2) 
 
4.6.1.2. INIT MSN Evaluation. To be mission qualified a member must accomplish all 
22 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
Mission Qualification Training (MQT) line items specified by that AFSC’s Career Field 
Manager and pass an Initial Mission Evaluation. (T-2) Required MQT line items are 
located on the AFSPECWAR/GA SharePoint. 
 
4.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of qualification 
due to one or more of the following reasons: 
 
4.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The RQ evaluation will be in 
accordance with the guidance for that periodic evaluation. (T-2) 
 
4.6.2.2. In the event of a failed evaluation (including commander-directed downgrades) 
administer the RQ evaluation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4.8. 
 
4.6.2.3. In the event a member was decertified or disqualified for cause for substandard 
performance in their AFSPECWAR duties and responsibilities or was discretionary 
decertified or disqualified due to actions unrelated to the performance of their 
AFSPECWAR duties, utilizing guidance in paragraph 4.11. 
 
4.6.2.4. The RQ prefix does not apply if it is the evaluation following a failed INIT 
evaluation. 
 
4.6.3. No-Notice (N/N). 
 
4.6.3.1. N/N evaluations provide commanders with a sampling of operator performance 
in situations where the standard rehearsal or review period is not required prior to the 
event. 
 
4.6.3.2. Examinee is notified of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal 
preparation for the mission. The beginning of normal preparation will be determined by 
the evaluator. The intent is to prevent advanced preparation for the mission or task. 
However, the examinee must be notified of the N/N evaluation prior to initiation of the 
evaluated task. Note: Informing the examinee after the fact is not allowed. (T-2) 
 
4.6.4. Simulator (SIM). Used when the evaluation is conducted in a simulator or suitable 
virtual training device approved by the MAJCOM. 
 
4.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation (e.g., 
N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of an evaluation and the 
purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the evaluation) will be explained 
on the AF Form 1035 utilizing guidance in Attachment 3, Part VII. (T-2) 
 
4.7. Evaluation Criteria and Grading. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and 
document overall performance. Individual scores are recorded for CB exams and areas/subareas 
are graded for all other evaluations. An overall qualification is determined from the compilation 
of the individual scores or areas/subareas graded (i.e., qualified/unqualified). 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
 
23 
 
4.7.1. Area/Subarea Grades. The required tasks tables in Attachment 4 establish areas and 
subareas to be evaluated during MSN or SPOT evaluations to include the appropriate 
grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas/subareas will have either a two-level or three-
level grading system. (T-3) 
 
4.7.1.1. Qualified (Q). The desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a 
satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed duties within the 
prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission. 
 
4.7.1.2. Qualified with Comments (Q-). Indicates the examinee is qualified to perform 
the assigned area/subarea tasks but requires debriefing or additional training as 
determined by the evaluator. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the 
prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize safety. (T-2) The Q- grade is not used in two-
level grading. 
 
4.7.1.3. Unqualified (U). Indicates a breach of discipline, performance outside allowable 
parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected 
mission accomplishment or compromised mission safety. An examinee receiving an 
area/subarea grade of U requires additional training and an overall grade of Q3. (T-2) 
 
4.7.2. Evaluation Task Types. Essential and required task grading areas have been established 
for all evaluations.  
 
4.7.2.1. Essential Areas. Essential areas are defined as those essential core areas, which 
if not performed to the “Q” level, could adversely affect the qualification of a member 
and result in loss of life or damage to property (e.g., safety). Grade all essential areas as 
either (Q) or (U). 
 
4.7.2.2. Required Areas. Required areas are defined as those tasks necessary to observe in 
order to ensure an AFSPECWAR operator’s MSN evaluation meets minimum AFSC 
requirements. Required areas can be graded (Q), (Q-), or (U). 
 
4.7.3. Qualification Grades. Overall evaluation performance is graded as follows: 
 
4.7.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q1). The examinee demonstrated desired performance 
and knowledge of procedures, equipment, and directives within tolerances specified in 
the criteria. The evaluator assigns this qualification level when no discrepancies were 
noted, but may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if: 
 
4.7.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any graded area/subarea. 
 
4.7.3.1.2. In the judgment of the evaluator, none of the Q- grades precluded 
awarding of a Q1. 
 
4.7.3.1.3. No remedial actions required additional training, only debriefed 
discrepancies. 
24 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
 
4.7.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q2). The examinee demonstrated the ability to perform 
duties safely, but there were one or more graded area(s)/subarea(s) where additional 
training may be assigned. The evaluator assigns this qualification level if: 
 
4.7.3.2.1. In the judgment of the evaluator, a Q2 may be given if there is 
justification based on Q- performance in one or several graded areas/subareas 
regardless of additional training requirements. 
 
4.7.3.2.2. Any area is graded Q- and requires additional training. 
 
4.7.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q3). The examinee demonstrated an unacceptable level 
of safety, performance, or knowledge and is considered a failed evaluation. The 
evaluator assigns this qualification level if: 
 
4.7.3.3.1. In the judgment of the evaluator, a Q3 may be given if there is 
justification based on Q- performance in one or several non-critical graded 
areas/subareas. 
 
4.7.3.3.2. Any area graded U requires a qualification level of Q3. 
 
4.7.4. Grading Instructions. 
 
4.7.4.1. Evaluations will not be terminated or negated to avoid an unsatisfactory grade. 
(T-2) 
 
4.7.4.2. Once an evaluation has begun, the evaluator documents the final results 
utilizing guidance in Attachment 3. All areas/subareas performed will be graded. (T-3) 
 
4.7.4.3. The evaluator will compare examinee performance for each required area 
accomplished during the evaluation with the evaluation criteria provided in each of the 
corresponding sections and assign an appropriate grade. (T-2) Derive the overall 
evaluation grade from the area grades based on observed events and tasks utilizing 
guidance in this manual. 
 
4.7.4.4. Evaluator judgment is exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and 
when specific situations are not covered. 
 
4.7.4.5. Evaluator judgment will be the determining factor in assigning the overall 
grade. (T-3) 
 
4.7.4.6. Verbal Evaluation of subareas. 
 
4.7.4.6.1. For INIT and RQ evaluations, all required items must be performed by 
actual demonstration. (T-3) 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
 
25 
 
4.7.4.6.2. For periodic evaluations, when it is impossible or impractical to evaluate 
a required area, the evaluator may elect to evaluate the area(s) by an alternate 
method (procedural trainer or verbal exam). Document why the required area(s) 
were not evaluated as part of the evaluation and the alternate method of evaluation 
used in the remarks section of the AF Form 1035. If additional room is needed, 
continue comments on DAF Form 623A. 
 
4.7.4.6.3. The unit Chief of Stan/Eval decides if the evaluation is complete. 
 
4.7.5. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy 
and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing the discrepancy 
and/or assignment of additional training. 
 
4.7.5.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the 
evaluation when the evaluator provides instruction concerning the discrepancy and 
determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to 
remedy the discrepancy. 
 
4.7.5.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by an evaluator to remedy 
deficiencies identified during an evaluation. 
 
4.7.5.2.1. Document assignment and completion of additional training on the 
affected AF Form 1035. If additional space is required, use DAF Form 623A. 
 
4.7.5.2.2. May include self-study, ground instruction, simulation, or live scenario. 
To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate attainment of 
satisfactory knowledge or proficiency. (T-3) 
 
4.7.5.2.3. Evaluated members additional training must include demonstration of 
satisfactory knowledge or proficiency to an evaluator, supervisor, or instructor (as 
stipulated in the additional training description) to qualify as completed. (T-1) The 
evaluator will indicate the allotted time to complete the additional training. 
 
4.7.5.2.4. If an operator receives a U in a specific area that originally required an 
event/task certification from the unit commander, the evaluator must recommend 
that the commander decertify the operator on that specific event/task along with 
corrective retraining and recertification action. (T-3) 
 
4.7.5.2.5. If an operator exceeds the allotted time or fails satisfactory completion of 
additional training, the commander reviews the situation and directs appropriate 
action. Document the circumstances with a memorandum for record (MFR) to be 
included with the AF Form 1035 utilizing guidance in Attachment 3. 
 
4.8. Evaluation Failures and Restrictions. 
 
4.8.1. The member will have 60 days to re-accomplish the evaluation (or two regularly 
26 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
scheduled drills, whichever is longer, for Air Reserve Components). (T-3) The member will 
be placed on supervised status for the specific task that caused the failure, documented on 
the AF Form 1035. (T-3) 
 
4.8.2. Restrictions. As deemed necessary in the judgment of the evaluator, additional 
restrictions may be imposed on the examinee until the successful completion of assigned 
additional training and/or a requalification evaluation. Restrictions address the specific tasks 
and/or operation that require supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions. 
 
4.8.3. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be 
placed on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor, trainer, or designated 
supervisor) required to provide oversight is determined by the commander. (T-3) The 
member will not perform the specified task(s) without supervision until Part V of the 
affected AF Form 1035 is signed by the  certifying official. (T-2) 
 
4.8.4. If a CB or MSN evaluation is failed, the member will be placed in no train or non-
combat mission ready status utilizing guidance in AFMAN 10-3500V1 and will not perform 
any instruction or evaluation until a successful RQ evaluation is accomplished. (T-2) The 
member will be placed on supervised status for the specific task or tasks that caused the 
failure as well as any other areas deemed necessary by the evaluator. (T-2) 
 
4.8.5. If a member receives two Q3 ratings in a row on the same evaluation type, they will be 
placed in a supervised status for all AFSPECWAR training events listed in Table A2.1 and 
Table A2.2 of AFMAN 10-3500V1, and their status will meet a review board utilizing 
guidance in paragraph 8.5. (T-2) 
 
4.9. Evaluation Timing. 
 
4.9.1. Expiration Date. Periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 24th month from 
the previous CB or MSN evaluation (e.g., an MSN evaluation completed on 9 October 2020 
expires on 31 October 2022). (T-2) Shorter frequencies to standardize core evaluations 
within the unit’s readiness and training cycle are encouraged. 
 
4.9.2. If an operator fails to complete a periodic evaluation within the required 24-month 
window, they will lose the qualification covered by the evaluation and regress to no train or 
non-combat mission ready status utilizing guidance in AFMAN 10-3500V1, Attachment 2. 
(T-2) 
 
4.9.3. Unit commanders may extend an evaluation expiration date up to three months. 
 
4.9.4. MAJCOM/A3s, delegable no lower than wing commander, may extend an evaluation 
expiration date up to six months. Provide notification to AF/A3S when extensions are 
approved. 
 
4.9.5. AF/A3S may authorize blanket or group extensions to evaluation expiration dates on 
an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or subordinate levels will be 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
 
27 
 
submitted in accordance with standard waiver procedures. Note: For blanket aircrew waivers 
see AFMAN 11-202V2; for JTAC waivers see AFMAN 10-3505V2, USSOCOM M 350-5, 
or AFSOCI 13-50. 
 
4.10. Evaluation Ratios (Evaluator: Examinee). 
 
4.10.1. MSN Evaluations. 
 
4.10.1.1. Non-leadership AFS evaluations will not exceed a 1:3 ratio. Evaluators must 
ensure that they can effectively monitor all aspects of the examinees’ performance 
throughout the entire scenario. (T-1) 
 
4.10.1.2. Leadership evaluations (enlisted and 19Z) require a dedicated evaluator and 
will not exceed a 1:1 ratio. 
 
4.10.1.3. Multiple evaluations are authorized within the same event. However, 
evaluators will not exceed the number of examinees directed by the most restrictive 
administered evaluation ratio. (T-3) 
 
4.10.2. SPOT evaluation ratios are determined by the evaluator, ensuring that they do not 
exceed the evaluator’s ability to effectively monitor all aspects of the examinees’ 
performance of the task. 
 
4.10.3. INSTR evaluations require a dedicated evaluator and will not exceed a 1:1 ratio. 
 
4.11. Decertification and Disqualification. Any AFSPECWAR operator may be subject to 
decertification/disqualification for cause for substandard performance in their AFSPECWAR 
duties and responsibilities or discretionary decertification/disqualification that is unrelated to the 
performance of their AFSPECWAR duties. 
 
4.11.1. Decertification/Disqualification for cause (with prejudice) is used for observed 
substandard performance as an AFSPECWAR operator regardless of whether observed 
actions were part of an evaluation. Document decertification/disqualification on an MFR 
signed by the observing AFSPECWAR evaluator and the unit commander and place in the 
member’s evaluation folder.  
 
4.11.2. Discretionary decertification/disqualification (without prejudice) is an administrative 
action that is not based upon performance as an AFSPECWAR operator. Discretionary 
decertification/disqualification is warranted when Uniform Code of Military Justice action is 
initiated, or any condition applies that prohibits personnel from performing AFSPECWAR 
duties utilizing guidance in AFMAN 10-3500V1. The individual AFSPECWAR operator’s 
commander has the discretion to decertify/disqualify or not.  
 
4.12. Commander-Directed Downgrade. 
 
4.12.1. The operator’s unit commander (or the commander of the unit to which the operator 
28 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
is attached) or any commander in the chain of command above that unit commander, may 
direct a commander-directed downgrade. 
 
4.12.2. A commander-directed downgrade may be a downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific 
area/subarea without disqualifying an individual. 
 
4.12.3. A commander-directed downgrade may direct a downgrade anywhere from removing 
a qualification (e.g., instructor) to completely disqualifying an operator. 
 
4.12.4. Downgrades may be directed without administering an evaluation using the 
following guidance: 
 
4.12.4.1. Examples of mission employment include breach of discipline, safety, etc. 
Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an evaluator during an evaluation but 
may be recommended by an evaluator from any AFS.  
 
4.12.4.2. For non-employment-related cases, do not use these downgrades as a 
substitution for, or in lieu of, administrative, or judicial actions (e.g., Letter of 
Counseling, Article 15). (Consult with the supporting Staff Judge Advocate office for 
legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences directly affect the 
commander’s confidence in the operator’s ability to safely execute their assigned duties 
(e.g., lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the operator’s tactical 
decision-making abilities). 
 
4.12.4.3. For downgrades that either disqualify or decertify an operator, the affected 
operator will cease acting in the qualification(s)/certifications(s) from which they have 
been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade. (T-3) 
 
4.12.5. Commander-Directed downgrades will be documented utilizing guidance in 
Attachment 3. 
 
4.13. Cross-unit Evaluations. When administering cross-unit evaluations (including cross 
MAJCOM) AFSPECWAR evaluators will: 
 
4.13.1. Receive prior concurrence from both the evaluators and examinees commander. (T-
2) Exception: Evaluations administered in accordance with formal training course syllabi 
(including periodic evaluations) do not require concurrence when the syllabus evaluation 
requirements completely cover all owning MAJCOM periodic evaluation requirements. 
 
4.13.2. Adhere to any unique evaluation criteria of the examinee’s unit/MAJCOM. (T-2) 
 
4.13.3. Upon completion of the evaluation, the examinee’s commander will endorse the AF 
Form 1035 and forward a copy to the first Stan/Eval function with oversight of both 
evaluator and examinee and to both affected MAJCOM Stan/Evals for cross MAJCOM 
evaluations. (T-2)

Chapter 5 
 
AFSPECWAR EXAM PROGRAM 
 
5.1. Purpose. The AFSPECWAR exam program measures an operator’s knowledge or ability to 
locate information of normal/emergency procedures required during the performance of their 
individual AFS duties as well as planning, infiltration, actions on, and exfiltration duties through 
the administration of written or computer-based exams. The program can be expanded to provide 
additional exams on advanced skills. 
 
5.2. Question Sources. 
 
5.2.1. Evaluators will draw exam questions from an MQF. (T-2) 
 
5.2.1.1. Evaluators will ensure closed book MQF questions consist of knowledge items 
considered essential for the performance of core AFS duties (e.g., parachuting 
emergency procedures, anaphylaxis protocols, danger close procedures, minimum 
helicopter landing zone dimensions) and include detailed references (references may be 
omitted when the question is placed on an exam). (T-1) Examination databases should 
contain at least twice the number of questions required for each examination (e.g., if a 
50-question examination is generated, there must be at least 100 questions in the 
examination database). 
 
5.2.1.2. Open book MQF questions are designed to test the operator’s ability to quickly 
locate information pertinent to their duties but not required or discouraged from 
committing to memory and include detailed references (references should be omitted or 
limited to publication number/title when the question is placed on an exam). 
 
5.2.2. The lead MAJCOMs’ AFSPECWAR Stan/Eval component is the OPR for 
development and maintenance of the MQF(s) for their weapon system(s). Lead MAJCOMs 
will review MQFs annually and ensure they are available for distribution and use. (T-1) 
MAJCOMs utilizing the MQFs will assist the lead MAJCOM with the annual review, 
update, and distribution of closed book, open book, and upgrade MQFs. (T-2) 
 
5.2.2.1. MAJCOMs are only required to maintain open book MQFs if they have 
operators with an open book testing requirement. 
 
5.2.2.2. Cross command coordination is strongly encouraged. 
 
5.2.2.3. The lead MAJCOM for Guardian Angel will ensure the approved PJ, CRO, and 
SERE MQF(s) questions include topics covering airmanship, duties on-board the 
aircraft, safety, and equipment procedures for general flight to meet Chapter 7 
requirements.  
 
5.2.2.4. Air Force Special Operations Command will ensure approved MQF(s) 
questions align with special operations forces baseline interoperability standards, as 
30 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
established by USSOCOM manuals or directives.  
 
5.2.2.5. Units may suggest MQF edits to accommodate local testing procedures, 
administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems or operational procedures; 
however, subject matter will not be changed. All change requests will be routed to their 
respective OGV, or equivalent level for approval. If the change is applicable to other 
units, OGV will forward the edits to the OPR through Stan/Eval channels.  
 
5.2.2.6. Units submit recommended MQF questions for inclusion in the next MQF re-
write through Stan/Eval channels to the OPR for approval and inclusion. 
 
5.3. Exam Study. 
 
5.3.1. MQFs will be certified current by the respective AFS MAJCOM Stan/Eval 
representative or MAJCOM Functional Managers and maintained on the MAJCOM 
publications electronic library. (T-2) 
 
5.3.2. When questions are added or updated, they will be highlighted as such until the next 
MQF review.  
 
5.4. Exam Management. When randomized electronic testing is not available, the test-
administering organization will maintain two versions (i.e., A & B) of each AFS exam and re-
write these non-random exams annually. (T-3) 
 
5.5. Retention of Exam Records. The Stan/Eval function will retain graded exam answer sheets 
or computer records until the AF Form 1035 is completed and placed in the evaluation section of 
the OJT records. (T-2) Retain failed exams until a passing exam is accomplished or a review 
board is completed. 
 
5.6. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all examinations, 
answer sheets in any stage of completion, and associated computer-based media. (T-2)

DOCUMENTATION 
 
6.1. Scope. Administration of the evaluation program requires accurate documentation. Note: 
This chapter does not apply to JTAC training and evaluation folders prescribed by AFMAN 10-
3505V2 or USSOCOM M 350-5. 
 
6.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through graduating an 
approved course or successful evaluations and documented on an AF Form 1035. Certifications 
are attained through methods other than evaluation and documented utilizing guidance in 
AFMAN 10-3500V1. 
 
6.3. Procedures. Each AFSPECWAR member will maintain an evaluation documentation 
section within their OJT records. (T-1) 
 
6.3.1. All evaluations will be documented on an AF Form 1035 and the assigned/attached 
CCV office will maintain the source document in paper or electronic format. (T-1) If 
maintained in electronic format, Stan/Eval Offices must employ a backup method. (T-1) 
Examples include stand-alone electronic systems, separate servers or paper copies and 
should be specified in a unit operation instruction. Note: A member’s OJT records are not 
considered an appropriate backup method and are a separate requirement.  
 
6.3.2. Units define local procedures for evaluation section storage, but storage procedures 
must ensure Stan/Eval accessibility. (T-2) 
 
6.3.3. A signed source document (e.g., AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training 
Accomplishment Report, or AF Form 1035) is submitted to Squadron Aviation Resource 
Management and maintained in the Air Resource Tool Enterprise Mission Information System 
(ARTEMIS) database creating a tracking record of each CB and MSN evaluation’s 
completion date. Note: Units without ARTEMIS access use the appropriate system of record. 
 
6.4. Contents of the Evaluation Section. AF Forms 1035 will be in chronological order with the 
most recent on top. Maintain all AF Forms 1035 for the entire duration of the member’s service 
effective with the publication of this manual. (T-1) Note: Any AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew 
Qualification; AF Form 8A, Certificate of Universal Aircrew Qualification; and DAF Form 803, 
Report of Task Evaluations; are retained as historical documents. Place AF Forms 8, AF Forms 
8A, and DAF Forms 803 in chronological order behind all AF Forms 1035. 
 
6.4.1. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions, or unusual circumstances to potentially be 
included in an AF Form 1035 are filed on top of the affected AF Form 1035.  
 
6.4.2. Once the circumstance, waiver, or extension has reached its conclusion, incorporate the 
information contained in the MFR onto the applicable AF Form 1035 under Remarks. 
 
6.5. Review of the Evaluation Section. 
32 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
 
6.5.1. The evaluation section will be reviewed by a Stan/Eval functional office, normally in 
the organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for duty. (T-2) 
 
6.5.2. HHQ personnel on active flying, jump, or dive status will have their evaluation section 
reviewed by the Stan/Eval function at the unit of attachment. (T-2) 
 
6.5.3. Outdated certification letters, medical recommendations and miscellaneous 
documentation identified during reviews will be returned to the member for disposal. 
 
6.6. Initial Review. Prior to a newly assigned or attached member’s first training event, unit 
CCV will  review the evaluation section and document the review on an DAF Form 623A. (T-2) 
 
6.6.1. At a minimum, the review will identify: 
 
6.6.1.1. Major discrepancies in documentation or evaluations performed in previous 
organizations not already annotated by previous reviews. (T-2) 
 
6.6.1.2. Qualifications and verification of parity with the unit’s currency tracking system 
of record. (T-2) 
 
6.6.2. CCV will place the completed DAF Form 623A chronologically in line with the AF 
Forms 1035. (T-1) 
 
6.6.3. From then on, the reviewing organization is only responsible for subsequent 
documentation placed in the evaluation section. 
 
6.7. Posting Review. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 1035 before they are 
placed in the evaluation section to ensure accuracy and completeness. (T-3) 
 
6.7.1. This review will confirm that the qualification/certification as documented is correct, 
all required evaluation events were accomplished, and that the AF Form 1035 is signed by 
the evaluator  and examinee. (T-3) Note: Q2 and Q3 evaluations will require commanders, or 
designated signatory, review, and signature. (T-3) 
 
6.7.2. Upon completion of review and correction of any identified deficiencies, the reviewer 
signs the AF Form 1035. (T-3) 
 
6.7.3. The Stan/Eval function will retain copies of all reviewed AF Forms 1035, either 
electronically or in paper format for each member. (T-2) 
 
6.8. Evaluation Section Discrepancies. Discrepancies include those on the AF Form 1035 and 
any MAJCOM-directed documentation. 
 
6.8.1. Major Discrepancies Disposition. Major discrepancies are those that affect the 
qualification of the affected member. They will be documented by the Stan/Eval function on 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
 
33 
 
a permanent MFR filed in the evaluation section immediately above the affected AF Form 
1035. (T-1) An MFR created to document late evaluations, OG/CC waivers, etc. is removed 
from the evaluation section once the information is incorporated onto the completed, 
affected AF Form 1035 under Remarks. 
 
6.8.2. Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are those that do not affect the 
qualification of the affected member and are corrected utilizing guidance in paragraph 6.9. 
If a minor discrepancy cannot be corrected on the affected form, they are documented by the 
Stan/Eval function on a DAF Form 623A and placed on top of the affected form. (T-2) 
Typos, formatting and misspellings that do not affect the overall clarity of the document are 
not considered minor discrepancies. 
 
6.9. Corrections. As the AF Form 1035 is a source document, only minor discrepancies may be 
corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alterations of the original document. The 
original evaluator must initial the correction. (T-3) When the original evaluator is not available, 
OGV members are authorized to correct minor discrepancies (OGV Chief for minor 
discrepancies in OGV member’s records). 
 
6.10. Transfer of the Evaluation Section. If the operator has a hard copy evaluation section, 
they hand-carry the records to the gaining organization. If any evaluation section information is 
maintained electronically, transfer by secured electronic transmission to the gaining unit. 
 
6.10.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization mails the hard copy 
evaluation section to the gaining unit via registered mail. 
 
6.10.2. When mailing an evaluation section or any of its contents, retain a copy (paper or 
electronic) until the gaining organization has confirmed receipt. 
 
6.11. Disposition of the Evaluation Section. 
 
6.11.1. Dispose of the evaluation section according to the Air Force Records Disposition 
Schedule. 
 
6.11.2. Outdated certification letters, medical recommendations, and miscellaneous 
documentation identified during reviews are returned to the member for disposal. 
 
6.12. AF Form 1035. See Attachment 3 for form guidance. 
 
6.13. Expiration Date of Qualification. Expiration dates will be tracked by the squadron 
aviation resource management office in ARTEMIS, Patriot Excalibur, or other MAJCOM-
authorized electronic means. (T-2)

UNIVERSAL QUALIFICATION OF AFSPECWAR AIRCREW 
 
7.1. General. 
 
7.1.1. Universal qualification is an AFMAN 11-202V2 designation that allows 
AFSPECWAR aircrew (as defined in the Air Force Enlisted and Officer Classification 
Directories) to attain/maintain qualification in multiple aircraft. 
 
7.1.2. Utilizing guidance in AFMAN 11-202V2, upon achieving universal qualification, 
AFSPECWAR aircrew are qualified in all USAF aircraft. 
 
7.2. Evaluations. 
 
7.2.1. Utilizing guidance in AFMAN 11-202V2, AFSPECWAR aircrew initial and periodic 
Universal Qualification evaluation consists of a closed book exam. 
 
7.2.1.1. The closed book exams will be developed and maintained utilizing guidance in 
Chapter 5 and contain a minimum of 20 general knowledge questions from the 
Guardian Angel lead MAJCOM-developed AFS specific MQF.  
 
7.2.1.2. Any evaluator may administer the closed book exam. Electronic delivery is 
preferred. 
 
7.2.1.3. The minimum passing score is 85%. An operator’s failure to pass the requisite 
evaluation will result in loss of universal qualification.  
 
7.2.2. CB evaluations based on the Guardian Angel lead MAJCOM-developed MQFs are 
dual credited as the AFSPECWAR aircrew closed book evaluation. 
 
7.3. Documentation. Utilizing guidance in AFMAN 11-202V2 and paragraph 6.3.3 of this 
manual, AFSPECWAR aircrew will document successful requisite exam completion on an AF 
Form 1035. The Stan/Eval function of the unit to which universal qualified aircrew are 
assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARTEMIS information is logged appropriately. (T-1) 
 
7.4. Aviation Qualification Codes. Utilizing guidance in DAFI 11-412, Aircrew Management; 
the following aircrew qualification code (first characters) are assigned to AFSPECWAR aircrew 
AFSs when: 
 
7.4.1. “F”: Upon successful completion of the requirement in paragraph 7.2, AFMAN 10-
3500V1 initial qualification training (IQT), and local unit in-processing requirements, 
operators will be considered a basic qualified AFSPECWAR aircrew. (T-2) Note: This 
qualification qualifies AFSPECWAR aircrew to fly without an instructor, provided that the 
operator is trained/certified to perform all tasks included in the training profile. For example, 
a team performing helicopter  operations to accomplish a Fast Rope Master evaluation. In 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
 
35 
 
this instance, the evaluator may fly on lead with the examinee, while a basic qualified 
AFSPECWAR aircrew member flies on the trail aircraft without an instructor, provided that 
no new tasks or training are introduced on the trail aircraft during the flight. 
 
7.4.2. “M”: Upon successful completion of the requirement in paragraph 7.4.1 and 
AFMAN 10-3500V1 MQT, operators will be considered a mission qualified AFSPECWAR 
aircrew. (T-2) 
 
7.4.3. “I”: Upon successful completion of the requirement in paragraph 4.4 and paragraph 
7.4.2, operators will be considered an instructor qualified AFSPECWAR aircrew. (T-2) 
 
7.4.4. “E”: Upon successful completion of the requirement in paragraph 4.2 and 
paragraph 7.4.3, operators will be considered an Evaluator Certified AFSPECWAR 
aircrew. (T-2) 
 
7.4.5. “U”: Upon a failed requisite closed book, lapsed exam currency, or other complete 
disqualification, operators will be considered an Unqualified AFSPECWAR aircrew. (T-2) 
 
7.4.6. Should an AFSPECWAR aircrew member be downgraded or have a certification 
removed, their Aircrew Qualification Code (first character) will revert to the highest level 
that they remain qualified.  (T-2)

ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS 
 
8.1. Information Files. Units will establish and maintain ease of access and use for operators to a 
physical or electronic library consisting of publications directed by their MAJCOMs utilizing 
guidance in paragraph 2.5.10, information files utilizing guidance in paragraph 2.7.9, and 
current read files. (T-2) 
 
8.1.1. Documents in the information files will be made available for deployments via either 
electronic or hardcopy means.  
 
8.1.2. Use the AF Form 50, Flight Crew Information File, to generate information file 
messages in which pertinent information is published to units (see paragraph 8.3). 
MAJCOMs may tailor the form to reflect weapon system information as necessary. 
 
8.1.3. Required Volumes. If units choose hardcopy format and the contents of any volume 
exceeds the capacity of its binder, use an additional binder, and identify the first and 
subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB). Label binders on the spine 
indicating volume and title. 
 
8.1.3.1. Volume I: Current Read File. Consists of a minimum of two parts to include an 
index (Part A) and current read files (Parts B and C). MAJCOMs may add additional 
components to Volume I as appropriate. 
 
8.1.3.1.1. Part A is a table of contents listing all material contained in information 
files volumes I through V. 
 
8.1.3.1.2. Part B is the current read file of FCIF messages. Messages contain 
information temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight 
aboard USAF aircraft and must be read before an operator conducts any event 
requiring flight aboard a USAF aircraft. (T-2) Note: MAJCOM and OGV 
AFSPECWAR Stan/Eval staffs should closely scrutinize FCIFs and ensure that the 
information communicated is pertinent to AFSPECWAR operators’ operations 
aboard the affected MDS prior to  assigning FCIF applicability to AFSPECWAR. 
 
8.1.3.1.3. Part C is the current read file that contains information temporary in 
nature related to jump, dive, ground, equipment and other safety messages not 
related to the safe conduct of flight aboard USAF aircraft and must be read by 
operators before conducting any event requiring a go/no-go review (see paragraph 
8.4). (T-2) 
 
8.1.3.1.4. Parts B and C may be combined and filed in chronological order with the 
most recent issuance on top.

level. If issued from agencies outside the MAJCOMs (e.g., HAF, Headquarters, but not 
subordinate Numbered Air Forces or units), the lead MAJCOM Stan/Eval function will 
coordinate the intent and verbiage of the SII with other MAJCOM Stan/Eval functions to 
determine the level of applicability within the individual MAJCOMs prior to release. (T-1) 
 
8.2.6. Information File owners will place SIIs into the Volume I, Part B for SIIs on USAF 
aircraft concerning AFSPECWAR and Part C for all other SIIs, for dissemination to 
operators. (T-2) 
 
8.2.7. All Risk Management related SIIs will be briefed by the enlisted leader or officer in 
charge during mission/team briefs for the duration of the SII(s). (T-1) Mission-specific SIIs 
will only be briefed on those missions for which the SII is relevant. 
 
8.3. AF Form 50, Flight Crew Information File.

8.5. Review Board. Review boards are designed to look at the overall evaluation or training 
process to deliver an impartial judgment. Review boards look at the trainee and the training 
process to see if the failure is individual, institutional, or procedural. 
 
8.5.1. Convene a review board when: 
 
8.5.1.1. Directed by the commander. 
 
8.5.1.2. A member fails a re-evaluation/re-certification. (T-3) Exception: JTAC 
evaluation failures are handled utilizing guidance in AFMAN 10-3505V2 or 
USSOCOM M 350-5. 
 
8.5.1.3. After any incident that compromised safety or resulted in injury to personnel or 
damage to equipment through negligence or violation of directives. (T-3) 
 
8.5.1.4. A review board is not required in situations where personnel do not yet hold a 
3-level AFSPECWAR AFS. 
 
8.5.2. Composition of Review Boards. CCV conducts the review board for their specific 
AFSs. Exception: For Squadron Commander (SQ/CC), OGV personnel, or personnel 
attached to the unit (i.e., HHQ) the OG/CC will conduct and determine the composition of 
the review board. (T-2) If a primary board member cannot be present, the presiding 
commander designates an alternate. The alternate is typically the next senior ranking 
member of the AFS involved. The reviewer’s direct supervisor may observe the board 
proceeding; however, the supervisor will not be a voting member. (T-2) The commander 
may observe the proceedings as a non-voting member since the board recommends action to 
the commander. 
 
8.5.2.1. A 19Z review board will consist of the 19Z assigned or designated to CCV, the 
operations officer, and the 19Z assigned to OGV (or another member designated by the 
OG/CC). (T-2) 
 
8.5.2.2. An enlisted review board will consist of the like AFS assigned or designated to 
CCV, the operations officer, the senior like AFS assigned to the unit, and the like AFS 
assigned to OGV (or another member designated by the OG/CC). (T-2) 
 
8.5.3. Review Board Actions. The board evaluates and analyzes all factors bearing on a 
situation and provides the commander with recommendations. 
 
8.5.3.1. Recommendations may include removal of an advanced skill qualification, 
additional supervised training, or recommendation for downgrade or removal of AFSC. 
Board findings of personnel retained in the AFS will be maintained on file for 18 
months. (T-2) If an AFSC downgrade/removal is recommended, the unit training 
manager coordinates with the base training office for guidance and documentation 
management procedures. 
 
42 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
8.5.3.2. Actions resulting in the recommendation for removal of an AFS will be 
forwarded to the next higher headquarters or MAJCOM level as appropriate. (T-1) 
 
8.6. Standardization and Evaluation (SEB). The unit commander, or their designated 
representative, will chair a semi-annual SEB. (T-3)  
 
8.6.1. The following are the recommended minimum attendees: 
 
8.6.1.1. Commander.  
 
8.6.1.2. Senior enlisted leader.  
 
8.6.1.3. Director of operations.  
 
8.6.1.4. Operations superintendent.  
 
8.6.1.5. Chief of Stan/Eval.  
 
8.6.1.6. Training program managers. 
 
8.6.2. The Chief of Stan/Eval or commander designated representative will coordinate the 
schedule, agenda, and attendees for the semi-annual SEB. (T-3) The SEB minutes will be 
sent to the next higher headquarters by the OGV no later than 30 days after the conclusion of 
the SEB. (T-3) See Attachment 2. 
 
8.6.3. Groups will consolidate unit SEB minutes to determine any group-wide trends. (T-3) 
 
8.6.4. Wings should review group minutes and provide cross-tell to their parent MAJCOM. 
 
8.7. Trend Analysis Program. The Stan/Eval function will maintain the trend analysis program 
which will include an objective analysis of all AFSPECWAR evaluations, closed book 
examinations, and any deficiencies/items of interest observed during training, exercises, and 
contingencies. (T-3) 
 
8.7.1. Stan/Eval organizations at the unit level will establish a trends analysis program. (T-3) 
Group and squadron commanders are the final authority for establishing their unit’s trends. 
(T-3) 
 
8.7.1.1. The unit will establish specific trend analysis threshold percentages and 
procedures. (T-3) 
 
8.7.1.2. OGV and CCV will report any negative trend data, recommend corrective 
actions, assign an OPR, and report trend status to the SEB. (T-3) 
 
8.7.1.3. For FTUs, CCV will maintain separate trend data for students and instructors. 
(T-3) 
AFMAN 10-3500V2  3 JUNE 2025 
 
43 
 
 
8.7.2. The trend program is the commander’s program, and the commander will determine 
which trends to effectively track, evaluate, correct, and close, and for how long. (T-3) 
 
8.7.3. Trend data will be included in the SEB minutes and follow-up actions will be 
addressed by the SEB lead at the subsequent SEBs until the discrepancies are 
corrected/closed. (T-3) CCV must maintain the trend analysis data collected from the date of 
the last unit inspection. (T-3) 
 
8.7.4. For closed book examination trends, consider the validity of the question, and the 
appropriateness. Consider the need for increased emphasis on the question’s subject area. 
 
8.7.5. For MSN qualification trends, calculate the percentage of “Q”, “Q-” and “U” grades 
against the total number of evaluations given in the subarea. Trends are not always identified 
by a threshold percentage but may be determined by the commander’s assessment as a 
potential weakness area. 
 
8.8. Unit Supplemental Exams. Each OGV or CCV function may conduct supplemental testing 
for all AFSPECWAR members. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge 
beyond the scope of required periodic exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, 
tactical/threat knowledge, or operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies 
exist within the unit (e.g., USSOCOM 350-series). This exam may be open or closed book, but 
does not count as a required periodic exam, nor does a periodic exam satisfy the requirement for 
a supplemental exam. Units will describe this program in the unit supplement to this manual, to 
include procedures for failed  exams. (T-3) 
 
8.9. Unit Supplemental Evaluations. 
 
8.9.1. Purpose. Supplementary evaluations are optional administrative tools used by a 
commander to ensure standardization of operations and to identify and evaluate implemented 
solutions to operational problems, such as negative evaluation trends. The form and content 
of a supplementary evaluation is at the discretion of the commander. 
 
8.9.2. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with any other 
evaluation. Supplementary evaluations are not periodic evaluations and will not affect 
grading or the qualification level and will not be documented on an AF Form 1035.  
 
8.9.3. The commander directing the supplementary evaluation determines the areas to be 
evaluated. The Stan/Eval function directly under the commander will determine the method 
of evaluation and provide administrative management of data collection. Once complete, the 
Stan/Eval function will report results to the commander. (T-3) 
 
8.9.4. Commanders may appoint anyone to conduct supplementary evaluations. 
 
8.9.5. At a minimum, the SEB lead will ensure supplementary evaluations results are 
documented in SEB minutes (see Attachment 2). (T-3)
