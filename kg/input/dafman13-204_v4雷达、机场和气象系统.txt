This Department of the Air Force Manual (DAFMAN) implements Air Force Policy Directive 
(AFPD) 13-2, Air Traffic Control, Airfield, Airspace and Range Management. This manual applies 
to Department of the Air Force (DAF) civilian employees and uniformed members of the Regular 
Air Force (RegAF), United States Space Force (USSF), Air Force Reserve (AFR), Air National 
Guard (ANG), and those with a contractual obligation to abide by the terms of DAF issuances 
except where noted otherwise, who operate or administer functions and facilities for Radar, 
Airfield and Weather Systems (RAWS). At joint, shared-use, or foreign airfields, this manual 
applies to the facilities controlled and used exclusively by the Department of the Air Force, as 
outlined in international agreements, real estate documents or other written agreements. This 
manual outlines key duties and responsibilities of RAWS personnel. This manual also provides 
detailed guidance, procedures, and programs for managing RAWS where the United States Air 
Force (USAF) has functional oversight responsibility. This manual may be supplemented at any 
level; however, all Major Command (MAJCOM) supplements to include interim changes to 
previously approved supplements must be routed to Air Force Flight Standards Agency, Airfield 
Operations Division (AFFSA/XA) for coordination prior to certification and approval. References 
to MAJCOM within this publication refer to the MAJCOM Office of Primary Responsibility 
(OPR) for Airfield Operations. Unit (wing/delta or base) level supplements to this publication must 
be routed to the responsible MAJCOM OPR for Airfield Operations for coordination prior to 
certification and approval. The authorities to waive requirements in this publication are identified 
with a tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See DAFMAN 90-
161, Publishing Processes and Procedures, for a description of the authorities associated with the 
2 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate tier 
waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the squadron commander for non-tiered compliance 
items or requirements. Refer to Chapter 1 for additional waiver requirements to this manual. Refer 
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the OPR using the DAF Form 847, 
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route DAF Forms 847 from the field through the 
appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure all records generated as a result of processes 
prescribed in this publication adhere to Air Force Instruction 33-322, Records Management and 
Information Governance Program, and are disposed in accordance with the Air Force Records 
Disposition Schedule, which is located in the Air Force Records Information Management System.

Chapter 1 
GENERAL 
1.1.  Overview.  This manual provides specialized and technical language and is intended for use 
by personnel who manage and/or maintain Air Force RAWS personnel, equipment, and facilities. 
AFMAN 13-204, Volume 1, Management of Airfield Operations, complements this publication. 
Note: AFMAN 13-204 Volumes 1-3 are in rewrite and upon publication will be DAFMANs. 
1.2.  The Military and Civilian Aviation Integration Division.  The Military and Civilian 
Aviation Integration Division, Career Field Management, is responsible for Air Force Specialty 
Codes (AFSCs) 13MX, Airfield Operations (AO) officer; 1C1X1, Air Traffic Control (ATC); 
1C7X1, Airfield Management (AM), and 1C8X3, RAWS. Career Field Managers (CFMs) will  
execute duties In Accordance With (IAW) AFMAN 36-2100, Military Utilization and 
Classification, Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 36-2670, Total Force 
Development, and AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization. This list is not all inclusive. 
1.3.  Air Force Flight Standards Agency.  Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) is 
responsible for terminal area AO (e.g., ATC, AM and RAWS) matters. In this capacity, AFFSA 
executes responsibilities as outlined in Air Force Mission Directive (AFMD) 27, Air Force Flight 
Standards Agency (AFFSA), in keeping with policy guidance provided by the Secretary of the Air 
Force. For the purpose of addressing specific procedural, training, standardization, architecture, 
and integration issues directly related to airfield operations, AFFSA may have cause to interact 
with MAJCOMs, interagency (in particular the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)), and sister 
services. 
1.4.  Operations at Contingency Locations.  Contingency is defined as a situation requiring 
military operations in response to natural disasters, terrorists, subversives, or as otherwise directed 
by appropriate authority to protect United States interests. At contingency locations, outside the 
United States, the Senior Airfield Authority (SAA) may waive airfield operations procedures 
outlined in this manual to support tactical or combat operations. This authority must not be 
exercised below the SAA level. (T-1) Prior to issuance of such a waiver, the SAA must ensure the 
following actions are completed: 
1.4.1.  Conduct a risk management assessment with the rationale for the waiver and explain 
(1) how complying with the requirement/compliance item impacts mission accomplishment, 
OR (2) cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower) 
creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; OR (3) the expected cost of compliance 
outweighs the benefit; OR (4) an explanation that personnel cannot comply with the 
requirement due to a lack of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or 
manpower). Note: SAA waiver period must not exceed requested waiver period or 30 calendar 
days after the approving commander’s deployment length, whichever is shorter. (T-1) Because 
these contingency waivers are the expression of a specific commander’s risk acceptance, 
approved waivers automatically expire 30 calendar days after a change in commander, unless 
the new commander renews the waiver. 
1.4.2.  Forward proposed waivers to the Air Force forces staff or equivalent for an operational 
review if time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA. 
8 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
1.4.3.  Refer to Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-4.13, Volume 2, 
Contingency Airfield Operations for additional information. This AFTTP outlines how Air 
Force personnel open and operate a deployed or contingency airfield. This AFTTP volume 
also contains planning considerations for AM, ATC, and Deployable Air Traffic Control and 
Landing Systems (DATCALS) capabilities, procedures, forces, and equipment. 
1.5.  Disaster Mitigation and Response.  Quick reaction checklists are available on the Air Force 
Flight Standards Agency, RAWS Operations, Procedures, and Training (AFFSA XAR) 
SharePoint®. Their use is highly encouraged when impending events have potential to damage 
RAWS equipment or facilities, or once a disaster has occurred. 
1.6.  Airfields Operated Pursuant to Contract.  This manual also applies to locations where 
Department of Defense (DoD) or Air Force access is pursuant to contract, to the extent specifically 
outlined in the contract Statement of Work (SOW) and/or Performance Work Statement (PWS). 
Locations unable to comply with these criteria due to pre-existing SOWs are exempt until such 
time that the current contract expires. Locations that intend to exclude the requirements of this 
manual will specifically state rationale for the exclusion in the SOW. (T-2) 
1.7.  Foreign Locations.  Any host nation procedures, or procedures based on otherwise 
inapplicable international regulations that are being implemented to fulfill basing or similar 
agreements should be implemented consistent with this manual to the extent possible. While 
agreed practices adopted for Air Force use in foreign areas take precedence, every effort should 
be made to conform to this manual. 
1.7.1.  MAJCOMs must identify any special procedures agreed upon with host nations in their 
supplement to this manual. Special consideration should be given to support and sustainment 
funding of equipment installed within foreign-controlled locations and agreed upon within a 
MAJCOM-funded support plan prior to installation. Refer conflicting procedures to 
AFFSA/XA prior to implementation. 
1.7.2.  Airfield operations personnel augmenting a facility operated by another branch of the 
US military will comply with their regulations and procedures as applicable. (T-0) 
1.8.  Waivers. 
1.8.1.  Units will use the DAF Form 679, Department of the Air Force Publication Compliance 
Item Waiver Request/Approval to process waivers to this manual. (T-1) Note: ANG units will 
comply with ANGMAN 90-161, Management of Air National Guard Waivers. (T-1) 
1.8.2.  Unit waiver request must include the following: 
1.8.2.1.  A paragraph reference or text of the specific requirement for which the 
commander/director is requesting a waiver. (T-1) 
1.8.2.2.  Rationale for the waiver. (T-1) Explain which one of the following reasons apply 
and explain: (1) How complying with the requirement/compliance item impacts mission 
accomplishment; (2) why the cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, 
guidance or manpower) creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; or (3) the 
expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit; or (4) why personnel cannot comply 
with the requirement due to a lack of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, 
guidance or manpower). 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
9 
1.8.2.3.  Time period or circumstance the waiver is needed. (T-1) Note: Tier 1, 2, and 3 
waivers may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver period or 90 
calendar days after the approving commander’s tour length, whichever is shorter. Because 
these tier waivers are the expression of a specific commander’s risk acceptance, approved 
waivers automatically expire 90 calendar days after a change in commander unless the new 
commander renews the waiver. 
1.8.2.4.  Risk mitigation measures to be implemented, if necessary, by the requesting 
commander during the waiver period. (T-1) 
1.8.2.5.  Impact if waiver is disapproved. (T-1) 
1.8.3.  Submit supporting data or documentation (i.e., letters of procedure, airspace maps, 
traffic patterns, airfield diagrams, etc.) to substantiate the waiver request. 
1.8.4.  Units must provide an informational copy of all approved waivers to MAJCOM OPR 
for AO. (T-2) 
1.8.5.  Units will submit waivers to applicable FAA publications through their respective 
commander for coordination from the MAJCOM OPR for AO, AFFSA/XA and the appropriate 
Air Force Representative (AFREP). (T-0) The AFREP submits the request to FAA and notifies 
the requesting unit, MAJCOM OPR for airfield operations, and AFFSA/XA of the results. 
1.8.6.  The requestor’s unit commander must forward a copy of the approved waiver to the 
AFFSA/XA workflow at hqaffsa.xa@us.af.mil within 30 calendar days of approval for 
situational awareness and process improvement considerations. (T-1) 
1.8.7.  Approved waivers become part of the approvers and requestor’s official records and are 
appropriately filed IAW AFI 33-322. 
1.9.  Governing Directives.  Airfield operations services are governed by DAFIs, DAFMANs, 
FAA orders (to the extent applicable), parts of the Code of Federal Regulations, and any host 
nation procedures which have been adopted for Air Force use; unless specifically exempted or 
waived. Unit commanders may contact AFFSA through their respective MAJCOM OPR for 
assistance in determining the applicability of directives. 
1.10.  Issuing New Air Force Airfield Operations Policy or Procedures.  New policies or 
procedures are sent out via message and posted on the AFFSA Airfield Operations SharePoint® 
website. Airfield operations staff personnel are required to utilize the AFFSA Airfield Operations 
SharePoint® website to download and/or view messages. 
1.11.  Maintenance Principles. 
1.11.1.  The primary objective of maintenance is to ensure continued operational availability 
of systems and equipment used in support of the Air Force assigned operational mission. A 
key factor in achieving this objective is maintenance discipline. Maintenance discipline 
involves integrity and the employment of required skills in all aspects of the maintenance 
process. It is the responsibility of all personnel to comply with all written guidance and verbal 
instruction to ensure required repairs, inspections and documentation are completed in a safe, 
timely, and effective manner. 
1.11.2.  Traditional maintenance concepts should adapt in-conjunction the ever-evolving 
technological environment.  The depth and breadth of the concepts varies throughout the 
10 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
maintenance environment.  In most cases, the older systems are more labor intensive to sustain, 
when compared to newer systems sustained under the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) concept.  
Maintenance personnel should strive to maintain their skillset and remain adaptable as the 
enterprise advances. 
1.11.3.  Readiness requirements may cause deferment of essential maintenance or training. 
Failure to recognize and support valid requirements may cause maintenance backlogs or 
mission failure. Managers will ensure every action is taken to make systems available for 
required maintenance actions and ensure maintenance is completed to meet mission 
requirements. (T-2)

Chapter 7 
QUALITY ASSURANCE 
7.1.  Introduction. 
7.1.1.  The QA evaluator’s primary duty is to ensure mission accomplishment occurs within 
the confines of law, DoD policy and guidance, Air Force policy and TOs. QA also provides an 
analysis, reporting, and deficiency resolution capability. It serves as the tool for ensuring that 
a process, equipment, system, end item, or service is of the type and quality to meet or exceed 
requirements for effective mission accomplishment. 
7.1.2.  QA is applicable to all field-level units with RAWS personnel. Those units will apply 
and perform the QA policies prescribed within this DAFMAN and applicable checklists. (T-3) 
Unit leadership is charged with the safety and quality of equipment operation, training, and 
maintenance. These actions will utilize the Inspection System self-assessment program as 
detailed in DAFI 90-302, to meet compliance and evaluation requirements. (T-3) 
7.1.3.  When manning or other extenuating circumstances exist preventing compliance, submit 
requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval 
authority. Once approved, the unit commander will appoint an individual within the RAWS 
maintenance work center to serve as QAR and perform QA duties outlined in Chapter 2. These 
QAR are individuals not permanently assigned as a QA evaluator and will report directly to 
the flight commander for all matters pertaining to QA functions. 
7.1.4.  QARs must meet the training requirements listed in paragraphs 2.9.2.1 through 
paragraph 2.9.2.3. 
7.2.  Managerial Evaluations.  Managerial evaluations will be performed as part of the 
Inspection System. 
7.3.  Personnel Evaluations. 
7.3.1.  The PE program assesses the effectiveness of a work center’s training program, 
technician competence, and technical and procedural data adequacy. These evaluations ensure 
equipment or systems are maintained in an effective and efficient manner to meet mission 
requirements. The evaluation can be accomplished on a system, equipment, or service-oriented 
function the technician is qualified to perform (e.g., align radar system, repair navigation 
system, and follow a written process). Evaluators observe how well processes are performed 
to determine if the technician demonstrates sufficient skill to accomplish the tasks. See 
Attachment 2 for additional information regarding PE process. 
7.3.2.  There are three types of PEs: Individual Personnel Evaluations (IPEs), UTC 
Evaluations, and Special Personnel Evaluations (SPEs). 
7.3.2.1.  Individual Personnel Evaluation. RAWS personnel and civilians directly 
maintaining centrally managed assets will complete an IPE within one year of initial 
assignment to an organization and upon return to the maintenance work center after an 
absence of one year or longer. (T-2) Short tour overseas assignments of 18 months or less, 
RAWS personnel will accomplish the IPE no later than 9 months’ time on station. (T-2) 
RAWS personnel and civilians directly maintaining centrally managed assets will 
accomplish recurring IPEs on an 18-month cycle (24-month cycle for ANG personnel). 
42 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
(T-2) This does not apply to MSgts - CMSgts unless they maintain training records and are 
task qualified to maintain equipment. 
7.3.2.2.  Unit Type Code Personnel Evaluation. UTC PEs assess UTC personnel readiness 
against the UTC MISCAP and ensure mission reliability. UTC PEs are completed on all 
RAWS personnel assigned to UTC-based organizations whose primary mission is to 
deploy. An individual will complete these evaluations within 90 calendar days (180 
calendar days for ANG/AFR) of being identified in the appropriate readiness tracking 
database. (T-2) These evaluations can be accomplished during field training exercises and 
other internal training opportunities. Team UTC PEs are encouraged; however, these 
evaluations do not apply to UTCs that do not have an equipment/technical component. 
Note: This evaluation can replace or be accomplished in conjunction with the initial IPE. 
If an individual is permanently reassigned to another UTC or the primarily assigned UTC 
has major changes (e.g., equipment replacement, new tasks identified), another UTC PE is 
required. (T-2) 
7.3.2.3.  Special Personnel Evaluation. SPEs are conducted on an as-needed basis. These 
evaluations are commonly conducted after major modifications of equipment/systems, or 
reevaluation of an individual who received a Not in Compliance (NIC) result from a 
previous evaluation, or who has had his/her qualification status revoked for any reason 
other than supervisor decertification. 
7.3.2.3.1.  Modification SPEs are required within 60 calendar days of new 
equipment/system acceptance on a sampling of assigned Regular Air Force personnel. 
Modification SPEs are required within 120 calendar days of new equipment/system 
acceptance on a sampling of ANG and AFR personnel. A major modification is defined 
as changes to published operating system parameters, specifications, requirements, or 
any change that revises published safety procedures. 
7.3.2.3.2.  Re-evaluation SPEs are the assessment of an individual who received a NIC 
result from a previous evaluation, or who has had his/her qualification status revoked 
for any reason other than supervisor decertification. Re-evaluation will be conducted 
within 90 calendar days after notification of recertification by the individual’s 
supervisor. ANG and AFR will be re-evaluated within 120 calendar days. The re-
evaluation of an individual whose previous evaluation resulted in a NIC will include 
only the specific tasks graded NIC, or the combination of the tasks that resulted in the 
NIC, unless the individual’s leadership determines a complete re-evaluation is 
necessary. 
7.3.2.4.  MFMs should ensure the effectiveness of the unit QA program by conducting 
evaluations on the QA evaluators and representatives. 
7.4.  Equipment Evaluation. 
7.4.1.  EEs are intended to give an overall view of the quality of maintenance. They also 
provide useful data for identifying training deficiencies and potential sustainment problem 
areas. The evaluation of systems maintained by the work center will be conducted by the QA 
program on a 12-month cycle (24 months for ANG). Equipment evaluations may be performed 
by any qualified technician and will be overseen and documented by an appointed QA/QAR 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
43 
evaluator. Attachment 3 can be utilized for EEs consisting of multiple like items. See 
Attachment 3 for additional information regarding EE process. 
7.4.2.  EEs are to be performed in enough depth to ensure systems and equipment are 
maintained and managed according to applicable technical data. The following areas will be 
evaluated as a minimum: 
7.4.2.1.  System performance as indicated by the technical parameters outlined in 
equipment specific TO/TM guidance. Also, NAVAIDS and ATC radar systems 
performance will be compared to flight inspection records and facility/equipment reference 
data. 
7.4.2.2.  Equipment cleanliness and housekeeping. 
7.4.2.3.  Compliance with standard maintenance practices and equipment safety 
requirements. 
7.4.2.4.  Corrosion prevention and control. 
7.4.2.5.  Equipment historical files, TO/TM configuration, and completeness using 
equipment inventory AFTO Form 470, AFTO Form 471, AFTO Form 472, automated 
copies according to TO 00-35D-2, Electronic Set Inventory Checklist for Ground 
Communications-Electronic (C-E) Equipment, and/or master COTS inventories. Units will 
develop master inventories based on shipping, acceptance, catalog, and other applicable 
documents for COTS equipment. 
7.4.2.6.  Applicable mobility markings. 
7.4.2.7.  Compliance with preplanned and time change requirements. 
7.4.2.8.  Management action taken on deferred maintenance actions. 
7.4.2.9.  Verification of the Master PMI Schedule to ensure all PMIs are scheduled. 
7.4.2.10.  Availability and condition of the required technical data, tools, and TMDE. 
7.5.  Unit Type Code Evaluations. 
7.5.1.  UTC evaluations will consist of three separate components designed to measure 
readiness: personnel readiness, equipment readiness, and acceptance readiness when new or 
overhauled equipment is received from the manufacturer/depot. The components of the UTC 
inspection can be accomplished separately or grouped together into one evaluation depending 
on availability of equipment and personnel. If grouped together, generate one report versus 
separate reports for each equipment end item/person. 
7.5.2.  The evaluation intervals are as follows: 
7.5.2.1.  UTC personnel will be evaluated when assigned to a UTC or once every 18 
months if already assigned to a UTC (24 months for ANG personnel). (T-3) Number of 
tasks evaluated is determined based on the minimum number of tasks necessary to make 
UTC operational. 
7.5.2.2.  UTC equipment will be evaluated as follows: pre-deployment, post deployment, 
and once every 24 months beginning from last post deployment inspection if not deployed. 
(T-3) 
44 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
7.5.2.3.  UTC acceptance evaluations will be conducted as required when equipment is 
received from the manufacturer or depot. (T-3) 
7.5.3.  For UTC PEs, the evaluator will assess a minimum number of tasks to ensure proper 
pre-deployment, employment, and redeployment of the assigned UTC. These tasks will be 
selected from the individual’s Individual Training Plan (ITP) and align to the UTC MISCAP. 
7.5.4.  UTC PEs will be conducted at the same interval as standard PEs. (T-3) 
7.5.5.  UTC EEs assess mission readiness against the UTC MISCAP and ensures mission 
reliability. UTC EEs are completed on all equipment assigned to UTC-based organizations 
whose primary mission is to deploy. These evaluations are intended to ensure that equipment 
is operating within the same capabilities as reported. The evaluations can be accomplished 
during field training exercises and other internal training opportunities when available. Team 
UTC EEs are encouraged. These evaluations do not apply to UTCs that do not have an 
equipment/technical component. 
7.5.5.1.  UTC EEs should include the highest interval PMI and below to evaluate that 
equipment is operating within tolerances IAW governing TOs/Technical Instructions 
(TIs)/TMs and/or COTS documentation. 
7.5.5.2.  Inspections should also evaluate that known equipment limitations or 
malfunctions at the time of inspection are being accurately reported in the IMDS and/or 
required reporting tool. 
7.5.5.3.  A qualified 5-level or higher must conduct the UTC evaluation. After completion, 
the UTC Team Lead and flight commander must validate the results. 
7.5.5.4.  If an individual’s UTC evaluation result is unsatisfactory, the unit commander 
determines whether or not the individual’s readiness status is changed. 
7.5.6.  UTC Acceptance Inspections (AIs) will ensure that system(s) being accepted is/are 
within full operational capability IAW applicable TOs/TIs/TMs and/or COTS documentation 
and documented on applicable acceptance forms.  UTC AIs will also include completing a full 
inventory of all equipment supplied by the manufacturer or depot. These inventories will be 
completed on AFTO Form 470, AFTO Form 471, and AFTO Form 472. 
7.6.  Trend Analysis. 
7.6.1.  Trend analysis is used to collect, compile, analyze, and record data on the processes 
sampled by QA personnel. One or two minor deficiencies may not seem significant by 
themselves; however, several similar instances could constitute a significant deficiency 
capable of impairing the unit or wing/delta mission. Effective trends analysis ensures 
continuous improvements of RAWS operations and processes. 
7.6.1.1.  Noticeable trends found during monthly no-notice inspections will be reported 
under the Special Interest Items tab of the RAWs Management MS Teams® (Team code: 
qv6t9ij) in the Inspections and Evaluations channel. 
7.6.1.2.  Special Interest Items (SIIs), PEs, and EEs will be submitted under the applicable 
tab of the RAWs Management MS Teams® channel. 
7.6.2.  Responsibilities and Awareness. The following are pertinent to QA performance of 
trend analysis: 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
45 
7.6.2.1.  It is critical for QA personnel to be alert for patterns of recurring errors found 
during all forms of evaluations. These deficiencies may indicate that additional guidance 
and training are needed in a specific area or function. In conjunction with documenting 
evaluation results, QA personnel and the affected work center supervisor must perform a 
root cause determination. 
7.6.2.2.  Deficiencies are often symptoms of an underlying problem. Management actions 
which result in ineffective supervision, inadequate training programs, insufficient 
manning, lack of proper tools, test equipment, parts or supplies, or a combination of these 
and other factors may be at the root of the identified problem. 
7.6.2.3.  Identify which agency has overall responsibility for the functional area. 
Sometimes the root cause may not reside in the work center that initially identified the 
problem; therefore, the problem may be out of their control. In these instances, QA 
personnel will report the issue to leadership for the appropriate resolution. 
7.6.2.4.  Review previous deficiency analysis results to determine the effectiveness of the 
actions taken to resolve the root cause(s). Compare current trend analysis results with 
previous results to identify similarities or recurring error trends or deficiency patterns.

Chapter 9 
TRAINING MANAGEMENT 
9.1.  Introduction. 
9.1.1.  The Air Force Training Program provides training for personnel to attain knowledge 
and skill qualifications required to perform duties within their specialty. The continuum of 
training for RAWS personnel begins at technical training and progresses throughout their 
entire career. The intent is to provide initial, upgrade, on-the-job, proficiency, and qualification 
training at key periods of a RAWS maintainer’s career depending on time periods, locations, 
systems, and duty/job requirements. Note: Refer all policy related questions to AFFSA/XAR 
at HQAFFSA.XAR.RAWSOperationsProc@us.af.mil or training related questions to 334 
TRS/RAWS at 334TRS.ULC.Workflow@us.af.mil. 
9.1.2.  All training will be conducted IAW DAFMAN 36-2689, Training Program. (T-3) 
9.1.2.1.  Personnel are considered in training until they become 100% task qualified. At a 
minimum, personnel must show training progression every 30 calendar days (60 days for 
ANG personnel). (T-2) 
9.1.2.2.  Refer to the 1C8X3 RAWS CFETP for more information specific to the 1C8 
career field. 
9.2.  Training Program Requirements. 
9.2.1.  Initial Skills Training is the bedrock of learning and instills the basic theory and training 
RAWS personnel will utilize and expand upon over time. The 334 TRS/RAWS at Keesler AFB 
will provide a multi-tracked course that teaches overall fundamentals to all personnel, before 
driving them through specific material based on the mission of their first base assignment. 
9.2.2.  Once personnel reach their first duty assignment, they will begin Upgrade Training 
(UGT), OJT, proficiency training, and qualification training. (T-3) 
9.2.2.1.  UGT will be based on the work center's MTP, the phased training approach, and 
the CFETP. The CFETP identifies common core task requirements for each skill-level 
upgrade across the RAWS career field. AFJQS and AFQTP will be assigned to personnel 
to complete UGT when they have applicable equipment items at their assigned location. 
UGT will not exceed 18 months (24 months for ANG personnel). (T-3) 
9.2.2.2.  OJT, proficiency, and qualification training is a necessary progression for 
personnel as they continue their career. The intent is to ensure job position, system 
familiarization and maintenance/theory proficiency increases over time to sustain the 
unique mission RAWS contributes to the Airfield Operations, Weather, Sister Services, 
and other communities. OJT will be completed by the work center supervisors and trainers 
based on the local MTP.  Proficiency and qualification training documentation will be 
completed by the work center supervisor and trainers, in conjunction with available 
AFJQSs, AFQTPs, and supplemental training products. 
9.2.2.3.  Continuation training and supplemental training courses will be available for 
personnel once they reach the appropriate proficiency and qualifications. (T-3) 
Supplemental training courses identified in the available course listing in Attachment 8 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
49 
will be utilized to provide advanced skill proficiency development to meet unit mission 
needs. The 334 TRS/RAWS will create and provide supplemental courses as deemed 
necessary by the needs of work centers, and at the direction of the CFM. Supplemental 
reference videos and training aids, created and managed by 334 TRS/RAWS and/or 
AFFSA, may be created and used to assist the field with proficiency and continuation 
training efforts. Continuation training will be required for personnel that PCS to a unit with 
a mission in which the member did not attend formal 3-level courses in initial skills 
training. (T-2) An example of this is a member moving from a mobile unit to a fixed unit, 
where they should transit through Keesler AFB to receive the training for their new 
assignment. 
9.2.3.  Except for ancillary training, all RAWS personnel will track and document training in 
an approved AIS for training. 
9.2.4.  All Air Force required ancillary training will be tracked in myLearning unless otherwise 
specified by program guidance. 
9.2.5.  All non-Air Force required ancillary training will be tracked in a sustainable method. 
9.2.6.  The work center supervisor will develop a training OI to establish local policy and 
procedures for implementing the training program. (T-3) As a minimum, include the 
following: 
9.2.6.1.  Responsibilities of personnel (AOF Flight Commander, Supervisor, Trainer, 
Trainee and QA evaluator/representative) involved in the training program. 
9.2.6.2.  Training program review procedures and documentation requirements. 
9.2.6.3.  Monthly training assessment procedures. 
9.2.6.4.  Recurring, review, and supplemental training. 
9.2.6.5.  Local or unique training requirements. 
9.2.6.6.  Work center orientation and initial evaluation. 
9.2.7.  Personnel in training will progress through four phases of training and be loaded tasks 
from the fifth miscellaneous phase when appropriate. (T-3) Each phase will build upon the 
knowledge of the last phase. Trainers may teach any task even if the member is not in that 
phase, however a task may not be signed off until the member reaches that phase of training. 
Example, trainers should not sign off a Phase 4 task if the trainee is in Phase 1. Phase 5 is the 
only exception as those tasks may be signed off at any point, if proficient. 
9.2.8.  The 334th TRS/RAWS will analyze each training product and categorize tasks based 
on complexity and required proficiency levels. Tasks will then be assigned to a specific training 
phase. Each AFJQS will include headers to indicate which phase specific tasks belong to. 
Note: The phase breakout pertains only to 1C8 specific AFJQS’s, all other command AFJQS’s 
will remain with the command OPR and will be loaded with CFETP task groups. 
9.2.9.  The 5 phases of training are: Phase 1-Knowledge Tasks, Phase 2-System Operation, 
Phase 3-System Checks, Phase 4-Advanced Theory and Alignments, and Phase 5-
Miscellaneous. Note: A training journal entry must be conducted at the completion of each 
individual phase. 
50 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
9.2.9.1.  Phase 1: Knowledge Tasks (Fundamental Concepts and Identification). 
Knowledge-based training tasks provide the fundamental concepts and theory for each 
system. These tasks will explain essential equipment characteristics, capabilities, and 
limitations. These tasks will be the foundation of the training program and will be 
conducted in a classroom-type environment utilizing Power Points, handouts, and/or 
schematic diagrams. Tasks in this phase can be completed without physical access to the 
equipment. The objective of this phase is for the trainee to properly be able to describe 
signal flow, assembly identification, and basic system theory. 
9.2.9.2.  Phase 2: System Operation (Turn-on/off, Operating Configuration and Indicators). 
System operation tasks will cover general system functions in operational conditions, fault 
detections via use of equipment indicators, built-in-test equipment functions, basic system 
resets, basic fault diagnostics, and turn-on/turn-off procedures. The objective in this phase 
is to properly understand operating configurations available to the system, identify system 
normal/abnormal indications, and turn-on/turn-off/reset of the system. Completion of this 
phase should enable the trainee to assume stand-by responsibilities of the certified 
equipment phase. Note: Stand-by responsibilities refers to the proficiency of the trainee to 
perform basic troubleshooting and reset procedures, enabling them to fulfill 24/7 system 
outage coverage. Any further maintenance activity could require supervision, approval, or 
oversite by a qualified technician. 
9.2.9.3.  Phase 3: System Checks (Preventative Maintenance Inspections). System checks 
include tasks that verify system operation, such as PMIs or tasks supporting PMIs. Tasks 
in this phase cover periodic operational checks and periodic system alignments. The 
objective of this phase is to reinforce system theory and operations, performance-based 
evaluation, and test equipment usage under operational conditions. 
9.2.9.4.  Phase 4: Advanced Theory and Alignments. Advanced theory and alignments 
include tasks that describe circuit or module functions and performing alignments outside 
of normal operations. Tasks in this phase contain training tasks utilized during 
troubleshooting, system alignment, and/or site survey. These tasks are a continuation of 
understanding regular operation from the previous phases. Phase 4 tasks primarily focus 
on what to do in abnormal circumstances and how to adjust the equipment back into normal 
constraints. The objective of this phase is to complete all remaining required training tasks 
not identified in the other four phases. Tasks usually consist of advanced alignments as 
well as remove and replacement procedures. 
9.2.9.5.  Phase 5: Miscellaneous (Non-Standard and High-Risk Tasks). Non-standard tasks 
are training tasks that are not performed regularly in a standard training environment (e.g., 
5-year interval tasks). Non-standard tasks usually cause operational downtime when 
performed. They are usually only performed when a part assembly requires replacement. 
Tasks in this phase will not pertain to all 1C8 equipment. Tasks identified in this phase are 
completed at any time mission requirements allow for the opportunity. These tasks are not 
required for skill-level upgrade and may be completed out of order when associated with 
this phase group. Note: Phase 5 task groups do not have to be loaded as a whole. Individual 
tasks can be loaded as training opportunities become available. 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
51 
9.2.10.  Work center training managers will create task groups for each phase and add the 
appropriate tasks from the AFJQS provided to them by the 334th TRS/RAWS. Work center 
managers have three options when creating tasks groups: 
9.2.10.1.  Option 1: Load Phase 1 and Phase 2 as one task group for the entire work center. 
Then, each Phase 3/4/5 tasks group would be loaded as needed. This is recommended, as 
it gives a foundation of all equipment in the work center. Depending on equipment 
downtimes, a work center should focus on what needs to be completed. See example task 
groups below: 
Table 9.1.  Phased Training Example 1

Misc: DASR 
9.2.10.2.  Option 2: Create a task group for each phase and for each piece of equipment. 
This will allow the local work centers to quickly train personnel on a specific type of 
equipment. For example, there would be phases 1-5 for DASR and 1-4 for the Enhanced 
Terminal Voice Switch (ETVS) since the ETVS has no MISC tasks. See example task 
groups below:

9.2.10.3.  Option 3: Load all the equipment tasks across the five phases. For example, if a 
base only has a DASR, NEXRAD and FMQ-19, the local work center could create phase 
groups with all DASR, NEXRAD and FMQ-19 tasks combined together. This option 
would still remain at five phases and would be beneficial for work centers that do not have 
a large variety of equipment or downtime issues. Note: This option is limiting as a trainee 
must fully complete a phase group before progressing to the next.

9.3.3.  Craftsman: Awarded upon completion of 7-level core requirements, in-residence, and 
virtual course. 
9.3.4.  Superintendent: Awarded upon completion of the in-residence or virtual skill awarding 
course. 
9.4.  Climbing Training Requirements. 
9.4.1.  Climbing training guidance and requirements are available in DAFMAN 91-203. 
9.4.2.  Technicians will receive initial training from a qualified training certifier at locations 
where climbing is required. (T-1) Technicians will be certified on structures according to task 
requirements of the work center they are assigned. (T-1) 
9.4.3.  Installations without a climbing certifier may use an alternate source for climbing 
certification (e.g., Air Force mobile training team, local climbing courses, Engineering and 
Installation (E&I), cable, and antenna teams).

(T-3) 
10.3.2.  Use AFTO Form 349 IAW TO 00-20-2, if IMDS is temporarily unavailable and 
maintain a copy until IMDS is available. (T-3) Upon IMDS restoral, enter all applicable data 
as necessary. (T-3) 
10.3.3.  Assign a JCN when a loss of capability or function in either equipment/system or 
service occurs. (T-3) 
10.3.4.  Ensure the same JCN is used for JDD/ESR throughout the life span of job. (T-3) Note: 
This includes when maintenance responsibility is transferred outside the work center as well 
as any required Not Repairable This Station (NRTS) actions. 
10.3.5.  Establish/schedule PMIs utilizing Phase Inspection type “A”. (T-3)  
10.3.6.  Track/update deferred PMIs to ensure timely completion. 
10.3.7.  Open a JCN sequential to the PMI JCN for major discrepancies during inspection. 
(T-3) 
10.4.  For outside agency support, capture customer service request tracking number in the 
IMDS job subject line/narrative (e.  g., BCE work order number, AT&T tracking number, Fed 
Ex tracking number). (T-3) 
10.5.  Issue JCNs to appropriate agency IAW DAFI 21-103.  (T-3) 
10.6.  Advise respective MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU of Not Mission Capable (NMC) outages 
lasting longer than 1-hour IAW MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU directives.  (T-2) Note: This report 
is only for systems the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU determined critical but do not require a COR. 
10.7.  PMIs that are deferred until the next PMI is due will not be cancelled.  When the next 
PMI interval is scheduled, the new PMI may be cancelled with approval from the CoM (e.g., 28-
day PMI will be cancelled 27 calendar days after the original scheduled due date). (T-3) Do not 
cancel the original PMI. To cancel a subsequent PMI, use screen 54 and clear the suspense using 
screen 128 in work center DOCS. 
10.8.  Obtain commander exercising operational control approval prior to cancelling PMIs 
twice consecutively.  (T-3) 
10.8.1.  The PMI must be completed the second time. (T-3) If the PMI is not completed the 
second time, the maintenance activity will change the equipment status to NMC and notify the 
MFM. (T-2) 
54 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
10.8.2.  If continued use of equipment is deemed necessary due to operational need, the 
commander exercising operational control assumes risks and full responsibility/accountability 
for damage to personnel/property during this directed period of equipment usage. 
10.8.3.  If waived by the commander exercising operational control, equipment status will 
remain NMC in IMDS. (T-3) 
10.8.4.  Waiver approval must be documented in IMDS. (T-3) 
10.9.  Utilize Restoral Priorities.  The work center will work jobs in such an order as to follow 
agreed-upon restoral priorities (e.g., work on a lower priority asset would be deferred if an outage 
on a higher priority asset occurs). (T-3) Guidance for establishing restoral priorities and outage 
response times is found in DAFMAN 13-204, Volume 1. Generally, restoral priorities for key 
systems are determined with all key base/wing/delta agencies. Many organizations also tie this to 
the base recovery plan. Note: DATCALS will establish priorities if necessary. (T-3) 
10.10.  Review and accomplish all TCTOs and document in IMDS.  (T-1) Additionally, 
accomplish any other completion reporting instructions specified within the TCTO. (T-1) For 
IMDS TCTO processing and procedures, review AFCSM 21-568 Volume 2, Time Compliance 
Technical Order (TCTO) Software User Manual (hosted in IMDS under the “Links” section of the 
top menu). Note: Commanders are not authorized to waive the accomplishment of TCTOs but 
may waive the requirement of the work center supervisor from reviewing and accomplishing 
TCTOs if the commander designates another office to perform that function. All TCTOs need to 
be immediately loaded and documented in IMDS, whether or not they are applicable at that 
location. TCTOs for RMC-supported equipment will be accomplished by or in coordination with 
RMC personnel. (T-1)

Chapter 14 
TMDE AND TOOLS MANAGEMENT 
14.1.  Introduction. 
14.1.1.  TMDE is critical to proper operation and maintenance of mission systems. Out-of-
tolerance TMDE can cause mission systems to be misaligned or erroneously declared 
unserviceable. Man-hours and parts may be expended unnecessarily to restore already 
serviceable equipment. Personnel who use TMDE are required to understand their function 
and the procedures for the use and care of TMDE. Proper use, handling, storage, transportation, 
and calibration are essential to ensure TMDE accurately performs its function. 
14.1.2.  TMDE is defined as any device used to maintain, evaluate, measure, calibrate, 
diagnose, or otherwise examine materials, supplies, equipment, and systems to identify or 
isolate actual or potential malfunction/discrepancies/deficiencies or decide if they meet 
operational specification established in technical publications. See TO 00-20-14 for details. 
14.1.3.  TMDE and Tool management applies to all sections supporting maintenance. All 
technicians will be knowledgeable of TO 00-25-234; TO 00-20-14; AFMAN 23-122; TO 33-
1-27, Logistic Support of Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment in FSC; TO 33-1-32, 
General Instructions for Input Power Wiring of Electrical/Electronic Support Equipment, and 
any applicable commercial manuals/guides. 
14.1.4.  All work center technicians will complete and document AFJQS XXXXX-201P, Work 
Center Test Equipment Management, IAW DAFMAN 36-2689. If local tasks are required, 
ensure tasks are identified, added to the training plan, and training is conducted. 
14.1.5.  Work centers will establish limited calibration requirements whenever possible. This 
eliminates time spent to calibrate unused functions or ranges and expedites return of the TMDE 
to the work center. However, before establishing limited calibration, consider the following: 
14.1.5.1.  Determine the functions and ranges needed for all mission systems and 
equipment supported by the TMDE in the work center. TMDE needs to be calibrated only 
for those functions and ranges used. 
14.1.5.2.  TMDE shared by two or more work centers are required to be calibrated for the 
ranges and tolerances required by each using work center. 
14.1.5.3.  Calibration 
limitations 
must 
be 
approved 
by 
designated 
7-level 
craftsman/civilian equivalents, after verifying all, or portions of main functions and ranges 
meet user maintenance requirements. 
14.2.  General Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment Requirements. 
14.2.1.  Priority calibration or repair will be requested through the work center TMDE monitor, 
only when justified to meet urgent mission requirements. TMDE will be picked up from 
Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) as soon as the priority calibration is 
completed. 
14.2.2.  An extension of the calibration due date will be requested through the work center 
TMDE monitor if loss of the TMDE delays or prevents critical mission accomplishment. 
70 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
14.2.3.  Training will be provided or arranged for work center personnel on proper use and 
care of TMDE, including how to determine calibration conditions and limitations. 
14.2.4.  The work center project coordinator must be advised of problems in obtaining or 
calibrating TMDE needed to install or maintain mission systems scheduled for installation. 
14.2.5.  Commander or designated representative/equivalent must be notified when the lack of 
TMDE impacts completion of the work center’s mission. 
14.2.5.1.  Work centers must perform TMDE user applications IAW TO 00-20-14. 
14.2.5.2.  Personnel are responsible to provide proper care, handling, cleanliness, and 
transportation of TMDE IAW TO 00-20-14. 
14.2.6.  Replacement TMDE may be required if PMEL is unable to repair an item of TMDE, 
or when an item is condemned or designated as obsolete. When new or replacement TMDE is 
required, work center TMDE monitors will: 
14.2.6.1.  Coordinate the acceptability of substitute tools with the work center supervisor 
or approved 7-level. 
14.2.6.2.  Notify the work center supervisor and property custodian when TMDE items are 
slated to be turned in to or received from supply. 
14.2.6.3.  Obtain applicable TOs for new TMDE and dispose of TOs for TMDE which has 
been turned in. 
14.2.7.  Recommend establishing TMDE inventory tracking system that facilitates quick 
inventory and accountability of TMDE assets. 
14.3.  General Tool Requirements. 
14.3.1.  Tool kits are defined as all government-purchased tools, to include tools provided by 
government-paid 
contractor, 
utilized 
to 
perform 
RAWS 
maintenance 
activities 
(restore/sustain/maintain systems). In this publication, the term “tool” refers to all types of tool 
kits as well as a basic tool (e.g., Xcelite®, drill, and socket kits). 
14.3.2.  Tools are defined as any instrument or apparatus used in performing an operation or 
task. 
14.3.3.  The objectives of the Tool Management Program are to reduce replacement costs 
through effective control and accountability of assets and minimize unsafe acts.

72 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
14.4.4.  When addressing the management of industrial shop machinery tools and 
accessories/attachments (e.g., Hilti, band saws, arbors, chucks, portable vise, blades, Pionjars) 
that normally do not fit within the tool kit the work center will: 
14.4.4.1.  Develop master tool inventory reflecting all industrial shop machinery tools and 
accessories/attachments that are not stored within the tool’s container. Inventory includes 
storage location of tool. 
14.4.4.2.  If a tool has multiple pieces stored within its container, create an inventory of the 
contents (e.g., Hilti’s drill box contains one drill, two 1/2-inch and one 3/4-inch 6- inch 
bits, and 3 ounces of lubricating oil). 
14.4.5.  Consider the following when establishing a tool inventory tracking system that 
facilitates quick inventory and accountability of tools: 
14.4.5.1.  Design tool kits to provide a quick inventory and accountability of tools. 
14.4.5.2.  Develop a simple inventory method, a “show” (e.g., a shadow of the tool) and 
“know” (knowledge of tool or kit location) concept. 
14.4.5.3.  Establish tool kit contents for ease of inventory. Tool kit contents should be 
standardized to the maximum extent possible within functional areas within a unit that have 
similar missions. 
14.4.5.4.  Each tool, equipment item, or consumable contained in a tool kit that can have 
an assigned location identified will have one of the following: inlay cuts in the shape of the 
item, shadowed layout, label, silhouette, or drawer/location assignment. No more than one 
item will be stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette except for tools issued in sets such as 
drill bits, Allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items (e.g., gloves, booties). 
14.4.5.5.  Utility tool kits (e.g., green tool bags, briefcase kits) do not have 
assigned/marked individual tool locations within the utility tool kit; however, the master 
inventory must reflect where the utility tool kits are stored when not in use.

CORROSION PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM 
15.1.  Introduction. 
15.1.1.  Corrosion is a natural phenomenon that attacks metal by electrochemical action and 
converts the metal into a metallic compound, such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. Corrosion 
occurs because of the tendency for metals to return to their natural state. 
15.1.2.  Corrosion, if left unchecked, progressively degrades an item’s strength until its 
structure can no longer sustain its design load and/or causes malfunctions. Unchecked 
corrosion can result in excessive maintenance and repair as well as system downtime and 
product contamination. 
15.2.  Maintenance Work Center Functions. 
15.2.1.  Effective and timely equipment corrosion prevention and control actions will be 
performed IAW TO 31Z-10-37, Corrosion Prevention and Protection, applicable TM/TO, and 
other command instructions. (T-3) 
15.2.2.  All work center technicians will complete AFJQS XXXX-201C, Corrosion 
Prevention and Control, and document in training records IAW DAFMAN 36-2689. (T-3) If 
local tasks are required, tasks will be identified, added to the training plan, and training 
conducted. 
15.2.3.  Submissions that address the type, extent, and repair/treatment of corrosion on 
equipment will be provided through accurate and timely maintenance and historical 
documentation. 
15.2.4.  If deemed necessary, research, develop, and publish corrosion-control procedures 
tailored to work center unique needs or high corrosion prone areas. Note: It is important to 
identify corrosion-prone areas, such as dissimilar metals, fasteners, hinges, latches, rivets, 
mating surfaces, crevices, faying surface, fillet sealing, spot-wielding assemblies, and water 
entrapment areas. 
15.2.5.  Equipment corrosion-control PMI intervals will be modified/changed to meet the 
corrosion environment in which the equipment will be operating.  Some locations may need to 
inspect equipment more frequently. 
15.2.6.  LWCs and PMIs will be verified for equipment containing clear corrosion-control 
inspection requirements and procedures.  Consider pertinent factors including operational 
environment, cost, resources, availability, and probability to establish inspection interval. 
15.2.7.  Guidance and resolution of corrosion problems beyond the unit’s capability to repair 
will be coordinated with parent MFM/MAJCOM FAM. (T-3)

Chapter 17 
CONTRACT MAINTENANCE 
17.1.  Introduction.  This section identifies the basic responsibilities for managing Most Efficient 
Organization or contract maintenance. 
17.2.  Compliance.  When the government solicits services via contract, some requirements may 
be excluded from the PWS or SOW due to cost. Requirements excluded from the PWS or SOW 
will be performed by the government. MFMs will determine which functions that are not included 
in the PWS or SOW will be waived or completed by other means. 
17.3.  Contract Maintenance Management Responsibilities.  When maintenance management 
responsibilities are required of a contractor, they must be specifically identified in the PWS. 
Managers will base PWS requirements on existing maintenance policy. The intent and philosophy 
of organic maintenance processes must be carefully considered and included when appropriate. 
Contract maintenance personnel are required to document maintenance actions and order parts, the 
preferred method is through the Air Force-approved AIS, to include IMDS and Reliability and 
Maintainability Information System (REMIS). (T-2) A contractor may generate their own database 
to track these actions. As a minimum, PWSs will have: 
17.3.1.  Contractor Maintenance Data Collection. (T-2) Enter systems and component failure 
IAW TO 00-20-2; material consumption IAW TO 00-20-3, and TCTO reporting requirements 
IAW TO 00-5-15. Cite appropriate data items and include collecting TCTO and reparable 
processing data in contracts. (T-3) Contract instructions call out the time and place to turn in 
data. (T-3) Specify if the contractors provide complete source documents and forms or 
automated products. (T-3) 
17.3.2.  System restoral priorities. (T-3) 
17.3.3.  Procedures to maintain configuration control. (T-3) 
17.3.4.  Procedures to document historical records, to include procedures if automated 
documentation method is unavailable. (T-3) 
17.4.  Contract Surveillance Programs/Contracting Officer Representatives.  Contract 
Surveillance Programs/Contracting Officer Representatives will accomplish contract maintenance 
surveillance program duties IAW procurement guidelines and command directives. When 
requested by the procurement office, the program executive officer/functional service manager 
provides a qualified Contracting Officer Representative for surveillance purposes. (T-3) 
Surveillance programs may vary depending on the scope of the contract and directions of the 
procurement office. It is vital military personnel do not change or task contractors, thus changing 
the contract. 
 
 
82 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
17.5.  Contracting Officers.  Only contracting officers will enter into or change a contract, PWS 
or SOW. (T-0) Only contracting officers or Contracting Officer Representatives will provide 
direction to contractors. (T-0) Direct problems with contract performance, contract changes or 
interpretation to the responsible contracting officer, administrative contracting officer or 
Contracting Officer Representative for resolution. (T-0) Contractual assistance may be used to 
satisfy a wide variety of requirements ranging from minor one-time repairs to operation and 
maintenance of complete systems. For more information see DAFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services, 
and AFPD 64-1, The Contracting System. 
17.6.  Considerations.  Consider contract maintenance on a planned and selective basis; however, 
wartime capability will not be compromised by excessive use of this resource. (T-3) Check with 
appropriate MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU managers to ensure local contract efforts do not erode 
command wartime capabilities.

equipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure, and movement 
of aircraft. 
Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems—DoD facilities, personnel, and equipment (fixed, 
mobile, and seaborne) with associated avionics to provide safe, orderly, and expeditious aerospace 
vehicle movements worldwide. 
Career Field Education and Training Plan—The CFETP is a comprehensive core-training 
document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements; training support resources; 
and minimum core task requirements for a specialty. The CFETP aims to give personnel a clear 
94 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
path and instill a sense of industry in career field training. It is the formal training contract between 
the Air Force Career Field Manager and AETC for formal accession and life- cycle skills training. 
Equipment Status Report—The term “ESR” refers to a report about systems/equipment mission 
capable status. The report is forwarded to managers at various levels who extract data on in-use 
AF equipment/systems to help identify trends, clear up problems, develop replacement systems, 
spare parts, and equipment modifications, and ensure managers know the status on critical CCITS. 
See DAFI 21-103, Chapter 6 for additional information. 
Flight line—Any area or facility including apron, hardstand, and ramps on or in which aircraft 
may be parked, stored, serviced, or maintained. 
Installation Commander—The individual responsible for all operations performed by an 
installation. 
Major Command (MAJCOM)—For the purpose of this manual, includes all Air Force Major 
Commands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command, Direct 
Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies. 
Master Training Plan—Employs a strategy for ensuring the completion of all work center job 
requirements by using a Master Task Listing and provides milestones for task, Career 
Development Course (CDC) completion, and prioritizes deployment/UTC, home station training 
tasks, upgrade, and qualification tasks. 
Mishap—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage 
or injury and meets Class A, B, C, D and Class E event reporting criteria IAW DAFI 91-204, 
Safety Investigations and Reports, paragraph 1.10. Damage or injury includes: damage to DoD 
property (excluding normal wear and tear or aging); occupational illness to DoD military or 
civilian personnel; injury to DoD military personnel on- or off-duty; injury to on-duty DoD civilian 
personnel; damage to public or private property, or injury or illness to non-DoD personnel caused 
by Air Force operations. 
Readiness Spares Package—Items other than aircraft, such as C-E, vehicles, and bare base 
systems, that are a transportable set of spares and repair parts required to support planned wartime 
or contingency operations for a specified period of time pending resupply. 
Objective—A statement that specifies what behavior is to be exhibited, the conditions under 
which behavior will be accomplished and the minimum standard of performance. Objectives 
describe only the behaviors that directly lead to or specifically satisfy a job performance 
requirement. An objective is a statement of instructional intent. 
On—the-Job Training—Hands-on, over-the-shoulder training conducted to certify personnel in 
both upgrade and job qualification training. 
Qualified Personnel—Refers to those individuals with the technical skills required to perform 
various functions relating to RAWS equipment/system corrective, inspection, maintenance, and 
preventive maintenance activities. An individual is considered “qualified” if that individual has 
been trained to the level necessary to perform specific activities or functions under this manual. 
Technical qualifications will vary by function being performed and technical competency required. 
For example, an individual qualified to troubleshoot a system will require more specialty/technical 
training than an individual qualified to remove and install a part. An individual qualified to remove 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
95 
and install a part will require more specialty/technical training than a custodian who conducts 
operational inspections and assessments. 
Qualification Training Package—An instructional package designed for use at the unit to 
qualify, or aid qualification, in a duty position or program, or a piece of equipment. It may be 
printed, computer-based, or in other audiovisual media. AFQTPs do not require third-party. 
Skill Level—The level of qualification within an awarded Air Force specialty, shown by the fourth 
digit of the AFSC. 
Specialty Training Standard—An Air Force publication that describes an Air Force specialty in 
terms of tasks and knowledge which an airman in that specialty may be expected to perform and 
identifies the training provided to achieve a 3-, 5-, or 7-skill level within an enlisted Air Force. It 
further serves as a contract between AETC and the functional user to show the overall training 
requirements for an AFSC that are taught in formal schools and correspondence schools. 
Supplemental Training—Training for a portion of an Air Force Specialty without a change in 
AFSC. Formal training on new equipment, methods and technology that is not suited for on-the- 
job training. 
Task—A unit of work activity or operation that forms a significant part of a duty. A task usually 
has clear beginning and ending points and directly observable or otherwise measurable processes, 
frequently but not always resulting in a product that can be evaluated for quantity, quality, or 
fitness in the work environment. A task is performed for its own sake; that is, it is not dependent 
upon other tasks, although it may fall in a sequence with other tasks in a duty or job array.

Attachment 2 
CONDUCTING PERSONNEL EVALUATIONS 
A2.1.  Conducting Evaluations. 
A2.1.1.  Evaluators will meet eligibility requirements of paragraph 2.9.2 and not have trained 
the individual on tasks being evaluated. Evaluators must make careful observations of actions 
taken to accomplish the task under evaluation. Each evaluator shares the duty for safe mission 
conduct with the individual being evaluated. Whenever an evaluator observes a breach of 
security, safety, discipline, or procedure during the evaluation, the evaluator will take 
immediate corrective action. Evaluators serving as safety observers will meet all safety 
requirements IAW DAFMAN 91-203. (T-3) 
A2.1.2.  Before the evaluation, evaluators must analyze and select tasks to be evaluated based 
on the type of evaluation, mission requirement, trend analysis indicators, training management 
reports, system performance data, previous evaluations done in the work center, and other 
management indicators requiring special emphasis.  Evaluators then select tasks not previously 
evaluated in the work center of which at least two-thirds are performance-based and the 
remaining third are common knowledge core tasks as identified in the ITP for the individual 
receiving the evaluation. 
A2.1.2.1.  Consider all equipment when selecting tasks for PE to adequately assess the 
work center training program effectiveness. 
A2.1.2.2.  Select alternate tasks to avoid the need to reschedule an evaluation when 
operational requirements do not permit completion of planned evaluations. 
A2.1.2.3.  Evaluators will brief the technician on the tasks to be evaluated, the 
rating/grading criteria, and the performance standards prior to beginning the evaluation.  
Emphasize that the goal of evaluations is to determine the effectiveness of the work 
center’s training program. The evaluator must advise the technician of the following: 
A2.1.2.3.1.  The evaluation starts when the technician begins to prepare for the task, or 
portion of the task to be evaluated, and is completed when the entire task or previously 
determined portion of the task is finished. 
A2.1.2.3.2.  All maintenance actions performed are subject to evaluation. 
A2.1.2.3.3.  Safety, security, or system/equipment integrity will not be compromised 
for any reason. 
A2.1.2.3.4.  All detected errors during the task evaluation will be used to calculate an 
overall award of C, Complies with Comments (CWC) or NIC. 
A2.1.2.3.5.  The technician must notify the evaluator of applicable information that 
could affect the task evaluation. This includes any Previously Complied With (PCW) 
task(s)/step(s) (e.g., a setup task for tactical equipment requires driving a ground rod, 
however the evaluation is conducted in a maintenance bay, so the technician hooks to 
a facility ground instead). If the technician fails to do this, he or she may be charged 
with an error for requirements that were omitted during the task performance that were 
not identified as PCW prior to the evaluation critique. 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
97 
A2.1.2.4.  Prior to initiating performance of the first task, the technician under evaluation 
will: 
A2.1.2.4.1.  Open a special inspection in IMDS or other approved AIS for each 
equipment item he/she is to be evaluated on. 
A2.1.2.4.2.  Gather tools, TMDE, technical data, safety gear, additional personnel (if 
required), and any other necessary requirements to perform tasks to be evaluated. 
A2.1.2.4.3.  Provide a safety and security brief for all personnel involved in the PE per 
Air Force instructions, technical orders, equipment/system manuals, and any local 
requirements. 
A2.1.3.  During the evaluation evaluators will evaluate the process from beginning to end, to 
include any preparation, task performance, and post-completion procedures. Technicians are 
to accomplish all tasks independently and without outside assistance unless a task requires 
additional personnel as directed by official guidance (i.e., technical orders, security 
instructions, and safety compliance requirements). 
A2.1.3.1.  Evaluators will stop the evaluation if technicians use methods or procedures that 
could jeopardize safety, violate security, or cause system/equipment damage. Task 
evaluations may be continued (at the evaluator’s discretion) after the hazard is corrected. 
A2.1.3.2.  The evaluator may ask questions or inject a task to determine technician 
knowledge of the task under evaluation. The technician may use technical references to 
answer any questions. 
A2.1.3.3.  Evaluators will assess a technician’s task performance, ensuring technicians 
accomplish the task independently and without outside assistance unless the task requires 
multiple personnel as directed by guidance. 
A2.1.3.4.  The evaluator may terminate the remaining portion of a single task if the 
technician has demonstrated technical competency. The evaluator will not terminate all 
remaining tasks for the evaluation. 
A2.1.3.5.  Evaluators will capture specific examples of how the individual performed 
various tasks for the report. 
A2.1.4.  At the conclusion of the personnel evaluation, evaluators will provide an out-brief to 
the work center supervisor and the technician. The out-brief will highlight the technician’s 
performance and notable shortfalls but will not include the overall results. Evaluators will 
complete a written report utilizing criteria described in paragraph A2.1.4.1, coordinate formal 
closure of the report based upon the overall result, and submit the finalized report IAW 
paragraph A2.1.5. 
A2.1.4.1.  Personnel Evaluation Report Writing and Submission. 
A2.1.4.1.1.  Capture all validated deficiencies, improvement areas, compliance 
examples, and Corrected During Evaluation (CDE) deficiencies on an AFMQCC 100-
1, or an automated substitute. The decision to document a deficiency must be based 
upon published standard practices and procedures, technical data, or other policy 
guidance. 
98 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
A2.1.4.1.2.  Validated deficiencies must include a deficiency code and a category 
rating of Cat I, Cat II, or Cat III. Table A2.1 lists these deficiency codes. All 
deficiencies will be tracked for trend analysis using these standardized codes. 
A2.1.4.1.2.1.  Cat I/Critical Deficiencies will result in an unsatisfactory evaluation 
and will require the evaluator to stop the evaluation and apply immediate corrective 
measures. The following are example causes for a Cat I deficiency: 
A2.1.4.1.2.1.1.  Strong potential/actual loss of life, limb, or litigation is 
required. 
A2.1.4.1.2.1.2.  Change mission to NMC status. 
A2.1.4.1.2.1.3.  Actual equipment degradation or lifespan; to include end items, 
ancillary, support or test equipment. 
A2.1.4.1.2.1.4.  Security incidents or violations that require further 
investigation or reporting; failure to meet instructions. 
A2.1.4.1.2.2.  Cat II/Major Deficiencies can result in an unsatisfactory evaluation. 
The following are example causes for a cat II deficiency: 
A2.1.4.1.2.2.1.  Slight risk/probability to cause minor bodily harm (e.g., faulty 
gloves, scratched goggles, dim flashlight, etc.). 
A2.1.4.1.2.2.2.  Change equipment operation to Partially Mission Capable 
(PMC) status. 
A2.1.4.1.2.2.3.  Possible equipment degradation or lifespan; to include end 
items, ancillary, support or test equipment. 
A2.1.4.1.2.2.4.  Possible minor security issue that does not require further 
investigation or reporting. 
A2.1.4.1.2.3.  Cat III/Minor Deficiencies can result in an unsatisfactory evaluation 
if they detract from the overall job or equipment/system performance. 
A2.1.4.1.2.4.  Evaluators will rate each task included in the overall evaluation. All 
deficiencies are then totaled and assigned an overall task result IAW Table A2.2., 
Personnel Evaluation Task Result Matrix. Results are based on the following three-
grade system: C, CWC, or NIC per Table A2.2. Technicians will be decertified on 
task(s) rated NIC. 
A2.1.4.1.2.5.  CDE is used on a report to show that the deficiency was corrected 
during the evaluation or on-the-spot. These deficiencies could still indicate a 
systemic issue and are factored in for trend and analysis. 
A2.1.4.1.2.6.  Table A2.1. s  hould be utilized to determine which deficiency code 
may apply to a certain situation. Note: This table provides an objective method to 
evaluate errors. Nevertheless, the evaluator’s experience and subjective judgment 
plays a vital role in the assessment. 
A2.1.4.1.2.7.  Table A2.2.  illustrates how to determine the results based on the 
deficiency code results for each task evaluated. 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
99 
A2.1.4.1.2.8.  PEs that do not contain any NIC tasks are rated as “Satisfactory.” 
Evaluations that contain one or more NIC tasks are rated as “Unsatisfactory.” 
A2.1.4.1.2.9.  Brief the technician and the work center supervisor upon determining 
the evaluation resulted in one or more NIC task ratings. Note: An evaluation that 
resulted in one or more NIC-rated tasks requires an investigation to determine the 
root cause of the identified deficiencies for each NIC task, and initiation of the 
decertification process on those respective tasks. See DAFMAN 36-2689, for more 
details. 
A2.1.4.1.2.10.  Develop an executive summary that contains a summary of what 
was evaluated, the overall result (satisfactory or unsatisfactory), a comment about 
the technician’s performance, strengths and weaknesses, and a deficiency trend 
analysis to include root causes and recommended management actions to prevent 
reoccurrence.

Attachment 3 
CONDUCTING EQUIPMENT EVALUATIONS 
A3.1.  Conducting Evaluations. 
A3.1.1.  Evaluators will meet eligibility requirements of paragraph 2.9.2. Evaluators will 
ensure EEs are performed on a sample of all equipment on a 12-month basis (24 months for 
ANG). This is the minimum required and units may increase the frequency or sample size 
depending on deficiencies noted. 
A3.1.2.  Before the evaluation, evaluators must analyze and select equipment items to be 
evaluated utilizing sampling plan guidance in paragraph A3.1.2.2. Effort should be made to 
select equipment not previously evaluated during previous sampling periods to ensure a broad 
sampling over time. 
A3.1.2.1.  Schedule EE completion, to the greatest extent possible, during organizational 
training exercises, pre-deployment inspections, recurring PMIs and maintenance actions, 
or other inspection actions to minimize operational mission disruption. Do not disassemble 
equipment solely for evaluation purposes. 
A3.1.2.2.  Unit commanders may direct a special EE at any time. An example of a special 
EE would be when a piece of equipment is overhauled. Do not document special equipment 
evaluations that reveal no discrepancies if an acceptance or commissioning document, such 
as an AFTO Form 217, Certificate of Maintenance Accomplished or AFTO Form 747, 
Cyberspace Infrastructure System Acceptance is signed. 
A3.1.2.3.  Review and analyze system records for performance data, applicable Standard 
Operating 
Procedures 
(SOPs), 
and 
other 
documentation 
such 
as 
previous 
AFMQCCs/LMQCCs, AF Form 1067, AFTO Form 227, TCIs, TCTOs, AFTO Form 47X-
Series inventories, and maintenance data documentation. 
A3.1.2.4.  Using a Sampling Plan for Equipment Evaluations. 
A3.1.2.4.1.  Common Terms. 
A3.1.2.4.1.1.  Population. The number of like items assigned to a work center will 
be used as the population for EEs. 
A3.1.2.4.1.2.  Like Items. Like items perform the same basic function; are of the 
same basic design; and are maintained using the same basic tests and alignments. 
A3.1.2.4.1.3.  Sample Size. Sample size is the number of items that need to be 
sampled.

A3.1.2.4.2.  Count the number of like items and find the corresponding block under the 
column titled population size in Table A3.1. 
A3.1.2.4.2.1.  The corresponding sample size in the sample size column is the 
minimum number of like items to be inspected. For example, the unit has 25 A-
Widgets and 30 B-Widgets which are considered like equipment end items. The 
total is 55; therefore, the sample size is 19 items. Nine (9) A-Widgets and ten (10) 
B-Widgets would be inspected over the 12-month timeframe. 
A3.1.2.4.2.2.  Random Sampling. 
A3.1.2.4.2.3.  For other large quantities of materials that need to be sampled, use a 
sampling size of 25 percent. This sampling rate can be useful to inspect any large 
population commodity, such as TO files, publication files, bench stock bins, etc. 
Rather than inspect 100 percent of a file/commodity, evaluation of an appropriate 
sample size normally provides a reliable indication of the condition of the total file. 
A3.1.2.4.3.  Use of a Random Number Table. 
A3.1.2.4.3.1.  To effectively evaluate a random sample of commodity, technicians 
can use a random number generator to identify which item in the commodity to 
evaluate. 
A3.1.2.4.3.2.  To determine the specific items or records to be evaluated, develop 
a way to randomly identify the items. For example: enter the list of items to be 
evaluated into an Excel spreadsheet. After determining how many need to be 
inspected by multiplying the total by 0.25, use a sequence generator to help provide 
the number of an item to be sampled. If the sample plan determines technicians 
have 16 items, four items need to be sampled, and the sequence generator responds 
DAFMAN13-204V4  13 MAY 2024 
105 
with 3, 5, 13, and 15 or technicians pull the corresponding number from a hat. Those 
items corresponding to those numbers are to be sampled. They were randomly 
selected to be evaluated. There are random sequence generators available via the 
Internet. 
A3.1.3.  During the Evaluation. 
A3.1.3.1.  During the evaluation, evaluators will: 
A3.1.3.1.1.  Utilize appropriate AFMQCCs for all EEs. For equipment, including 
COTS, where AFMQCCs have not yet been published, a LMQCC is required. 
A3.1.3.1.2.  Evaluate and identify deficiencies, improvement areas, and compliance 
examples in enough depth to ensure equipment and systems are maintained and 
managed according to applicable technical data and standards. These standards include 
technical parameters, grounding, bonding, power, and corrosion prevention. 
A3.1.3.1.3.  Document findings on applicable AFMQCCs/LMQCCs for use in the final 
report. All detected errors during the evaluation will be used to calculate an overall 
award on each AFMQCC line item. 
A3.1.4.  At the conclusion of the evaluation, evaluators will provide an initial out brief to the 
work center supervisor. Evaluators will complete a written report utilizing criteria described in 
paragraph A3.1.4.1, coordinate formal closure of the report based upon the overall result, and 
submit the finalized report IAW paragraph A3.1.4.2.2. 
A3.1.4.1.  Equipment Evaluation Report Writing and Submission.  
A3.1.4.1.1.  Capture all validated deficiencies, improvement areas, and compliance 
examples on the applicable equipment AFMQCC. The decision to document a 
deficiency must be based upon published technical data or other maintenance guidance. 
A3.1.4.1.2.  Validated deficiencies must include a deficiency code and a category 
rating of Cat I, Cat II, or Cat III. Table A3.1 should be utilized to determine which 
deficiency code may apply to a certain situation. The evaluator’s experience and 
subjective judgment plays a vital role in the assessment. 
A3.1.4.1.3.  Total all deficiencies and assign an overall rating of each AFMQCC line 
item according to Table A3.2. Results are based on the three-grade system (i.e., 
“Complies (C)”, “Complies With Comments (CWC)”, or “Not In Compliance (NIC)”). 
A3.1.4.1.4.  EEs that contain no (zero) NIC tasks are rated as “Satisfactory.” 
Evaluations that contain one or more NIC tasks are rated as “Unsatisfactory.” 
A3.1.4.1.5.  While determining the grade, if any critical deficiency is determined, 
evaluator will immediately notify the work center supervisor for immediate action. 
Root cause determination of the identified deficiency should be captured in the final 
report, if known.
