AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
Chapter 1 
OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Concept of the OPREP-3 System.  The OPREP-3 system provides national leaders, Chief 
of Staff, United States Air Force (CSAF) and Chief of Space Operation (CSO), United States 
Space Force intermediate commanders and their staffs the information necessary for timely 
operational decisions.  The main criterion for inclusion in the OPREP-3 system is essential 
operational information for command and control of aerospace forces. 
1.1.1.  MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU reporting rules or instructions will not be identified as an 
OPREP-3.  (T-1).  Any such MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commander-directed reporting 
requirements for events and incidents that do not meet OPREP-3 reporting requirements are 
commonly referred to as Commanders Critical Information Reports.  (T-1). 
1.1.2.  Due to the time sensitivity of OPREP-3 information, report each event and incident 
promptly and as accurately as possible.  (T-1).  The FIRST command post having 
knowledge of an event/incident will report/facilitate OPREP-3 reporting, the FIRST 
command post verifies a report has not already been submitted by reviewing the synchronous 
secure prior to submission.  (T-1).  Units will not delay submission of an OPREP-3 to 
research whether another unit is also submitting the report.  (T-1).  In the case of multiple 
OPREP-3 submissions, Air Force Service Watch Cell (AFSWC) will decide which unit will 
continue submitting follow-up reporting based on information received.  (T-1).  Only 
Command and Control Operations Specialists (1C3s) and certified personnel assigned to the 
wing or installation command post (e.g., 86P, 13N, or Civilians) can transmit an OPREP-3.  
(T-1). 
1.1.3.  Units at all levels will develop procedures to quickly obtain and report the key 
elements of an OPREP-3.  (T-3).  Installations hosting multiple units (assigned to different 
MAJCOMs, sister services, detachments) will include OPREP-3 reporting requirements in 
the host-tenant support agreement (HTSA).  (T-1).  When a HTSA is not feasible, a 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) will be used to capture OPREP-3 reporting processes 
for each unit.  (T-3).  All Air Force units, to include geographically separated units (GSUs), 
will comply with their MAJCOM guidance and this manual.  (T-1). 
1.1.3.1.  Per AFI 10-2701, Organization and Function of the Civil Air Patrol, the Air 
Force doctrine recognizes Civil Air Patrol (CAP), civilian, and contractors members as 
Airmen when performing missions or programs as the Air Force Auxiliary – a part of the 
Total Force with Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National Guard, and Air Force 
Reserve.  Civil Air Patrol – United States Air Force (CAP-USAF) provides advice, 
advocacy, assistance, and liaison to CAP and serves as the primary functional interface 
between other federal agencies and civil air patrol.  Therefore, CAP-USAF Shall ensure 
mishaps and events of interest shall be included in USAF Operational Reporting. 
1.1.4.  Air Force component commanders within combatant commands (Air Expeditionary 
Wings and Air Expeditionary Groups), joint bases, and joint task forces (permanent or 
temporary), will develop written guidance to ensure all OPREP-3 requirements within this 
document and the CSAF reports matrix can be met.  (T-1). 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018

1.1.5.  Authority.  This manual includes the requirements of various documents from the joint 
reporting structure.  Air and Space Force units will use this manual as the primary source for 
reporting OPREP-3 information to Department of Air Force (DAF) leadership.  (T-1).

their installation and wing operations.  (T-1). 
2.4.1.1.  OPREP-3 incidents reported by tenant units will go through the Air and Space 
Force Installation and Wing Commander for release and approval when installation and 
wing resources directly support the tenant.  Tenant Commanders should be the releasing 
and approving authority on reports impacting their operations only, unless otherwise 
directed in established support agreements.  Installation/Wing Commanders will be 
notified of all OPREP-3 reports submitted by the tenant commander.  Command Posts 
will not delay OPREP-3 submission to notify Installation/Wing Commanders of tenant 
unit reportable incidents.  (T-1).  ANG commanders retain approval authority until

10 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
2.4.3.  Ensure HTSA or MOA outline OPREP-3 procedures between organizations.  (T-1).  
Commanders will outline agreement procedures to ensure the installation Command Post is 
made aware of all event and incidents occurring on or impacting their installation.  (T-1).  
Established HTSA and MOA should not cause a delay in the submission of OPREP-3 reports 
by the Command Post. 
2.4.4.  Ensure OPREP-3 reports are released by the host wing commander (or delegated 
officials) when host installation resources are utilized, except as outlined below.  (T-1). 
2.4.5.  Ensure events and incidents meeting OPREP-3 reporting requirements (CSAF 
OPREP-3 Reports Matrix) and applicable required attachment or templates (i.e.  Storyboards, 
Unmanned Aircraft Systems) are submitted to the AFSWC.  (T-1). 
2.4.6.  Submit an OPREP-3 (Commander’s Discretion) when in the opinion of the 
commander, an event or incident does not fall into a CSAF rule, but is significant enough to 
report to DAF.  (T-3). 
2.4.7.  Ensure that individuals who are temporarily serving in the role of Commander or First 
Sergeant contact the command post for training on reporting requirements within 3-5 duty 
days of duty assumption.  (T-1).  Training is required if filling temporarily duties.

2.5.1.  Provide initial (within 30 days of assignment) and semi-annual training to 
Commanders (wing, group, squadron, tenant, sister services, etc.) and First Sergeants on 
OPREP-3 processes and requirements.  (T-0).  Training can be conducted via email, briefings 
or other methods so long as the training is documented; however, the recommendation is to 
conduct a face-to-face briefing to ensure understanding of notification procedures, and to 
provide any clarifying guidance.  (T-1).  Semi-annual training can be re-accomplished as 
changes to the CSAF matrix occur so long as the semi-annual requirement is met, and the

questions that need to be answered when including data into an OPREP-3.  Due to the 
need to update as the CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix is updated, the CSAF OPREP-3 
Reports Guide is posted on the NIPRnet Command Post Intelink Site.  When updates to 
the CSAF OPREP-3 Report Matrix occur, the CSAF OPREP-3 Report Guide will 
simultaneously updated as well.  Both documents are located on the NIPRnet Command 
Post Intelink Site. 
2.6.1.3.  Reports Checklists.  These contain step-by-step procedures to ensure required 
reports are submitted in the proper format, within established timelines, and with the 
correct content.  Electronic checklists are authorized; keep a printed copy within the 
Reports Guidebook.

EVENT/INCIDENT REPORT (OPREP-3) REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS 
3.1.  Subject and Purpose.  In accordance with CJCS Manual (CJCSM) 3150.03D, Joint 
Reporting Structure Event and Incident Reports, Air Force and Space Force Commanders shall 
use OPREP-3s to immediately notify Higher Headquarters of any significant event or incident 
that rises to the level of DoD, CSAF, CSO, CJCS, Combatant Command, or service-level 
interests.  (T-0).  Command Posts, on behalf of AF Commanders, will submit the applicable 
OPREP-3 regardless of whether or not the event is being reported through other channels.  (T-1).  
OPREP-3s do not replace the requirement for more detailed reports such as Commander’s 
Situational Reports (SITREPs), and other directorates’ accident or incident investigation reports.  
Submitting an OPREP-3 does not change, nor is it a substitute for, any report required by other 
directives.  Real-world OPREP-3s take priority over exercise events. 
3.2.  Security Classification.  To properly classify a report, refer to the appropriate Security 
Classification Guides.  Department of Defense Manual (DoDM) 5200.01, Vol 1, DoD 
Information Security Program:  Overview, Classification, and Declassification; DODM 
5200.01, Vol 2, DoD Information Security Program: Marking of Classified Information; and 
AFI 16-1404, Air Force Information Security Program, provide security classification, marking, 
and downgrading instructions provide guidance for writing security classification guides, as well 
as marking and downgrading instructions. 
3.2.1.  OPREP-3s are classified according to content.  Approving/releasing Commanders and 
Command and Control Operations Controllers must review report content to ensure it is 
classified appropriately per the applicable classification guide or Original Classification 
Authority.  (T-0).  Personnel transmitting classified OPREP-3 reports through either 
synchronous or asynchronous means are considered derivative classifiers and are responsible 
for appropriately marking all reports in accordance with DoDM 5200.01 Vol 2.  (T-0).  
Examples of derivatively classified reports found in this manual are provided to aid 
controllers in the proper formatting of derivative classification lines. 
3.2.2.  Command Posts must transmit all reports over Secret Internet Protocol Router 
Network (SIPRnet) with proper classification markings or via secure voice if classification is 
higher. 
(T-0). 
3.2.3.  When combat or combat-related speed of delivery outweigh the need for information 
security, after careful consideration of risks, military commanders may modify transmission 
of classified information as necessary to meet local conditions. 
3.3.  Directed Reporting.  Air Force Service Watch Cell (AFSWC), when directed by Joint 
Staff/HAF/USSF leadership, may direct a unit to submit an OPREP-3 on a significant 
event/incident.  Air Force Service Watch Cell may suspend reporting for a unit when they are in 
a degraded communications environment. 
3.3.1.  AFSWC controllers will serve as the primary HHQ advisor to Wing and Installation 
Command Posts regarding the need for reporting based on current directions of the JS, 
SECAF, CSAF, CSO or HAF/A3. 
14 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
3.3.2.  Air Force Duty Officers and AFSWC Controllers will not accept or deny any report 
but can advise when a report would be better reported under a different rule number or 
template. 
3.3.3.  AFSWC can direct units to submit storyboards or other supplemental information to 
support decision making of key senior leaders. 
3.4.  Appropriate Report Content.  Command Posts must clearly convey the details of the 
incident and protect individual references or Personally Identifying Information.  (T-0).  To 
ensure anonymity, reports may contain: 
3.4.1.  Rank, age, gender, marital status, number and age of dependents, duty status (e.g., 
RegAF, ANG or AFR-Full Time, ANG or AFR-Drill Status, ANG or AFR-Traditional 
Status, etc, DoD Civilian Status, Civil Air Patrol), and assigned unit and agency. 
3.4.2.  Aircraft type, full tail number, owning unit, aircrew unit and squadron, type of 
mission, and mission number. This information is required for all reports involving AF or 
CAP owned, contracted, or operated aircraft. 
3.5.  Inappropriate Report Content.  Although the narrative section of each report should 
clearly convey the details of the incident, the report should not include: 
3.5.1.  Any speculation regarding responsibility, failure of equipment or facilities, legal 
liability, or causes (except when the cause of death is known). 
3.5.2.  Quotations or opinions from witnesses or other privileged sources. 
3.5.3.  Names. EXCEPTIONS: 1) when provide, office symbol, and 10-digit DSN as a Point 
of Contact (POC) for a report (Civilian Personnel, Safety, Security Forces, Safety Board 
Lead etc.), 2) when reporting a public figure whose death occurs on an Air Force installation; 
or 3) the name of a deceased/retired AF VIP (e.g., flag officer or Chief Master Sergeant of 
the Air Force [CMSAF]).  If Higher Headquarters requires the name/SSN of any individual, 
it will be requested as an addendum separate from the report, and only the last 4 digits of the 
SSN should be provided.  Addendum information containing Personally Identifiable 
Information will be marked as Personally Identifiable Information and sent via encrypted 
email or by secure means.  (T-0). 
3.6.  Correction of Reports.  All report errors or deficiencies identified by the MAJCOM and/or 
the AFSWC, during a synchronous secure chat room post, will be corrected in the asynchronous 
report.  (T-1).  Unit-identified updates, content corrections and/or clarifications found after the 
synchronous secure chat room post, but prior to the asynchronous reporting system site 
submission, will be posted to the synchronous secure chat room and approved by the Air Force 
Service Watch Cell prior to posting to the asynchronous reporting system site.  (T-1). 
3.7.  Reporting Categories.  CJCSM 3150.03D, has FLAGWORD(s) that categorize events or 
incidents according to their nature.  FLAGWORDs are located in CJCSM 3150.03D, enclosure 
A, paragraph 1, a, 1-10.  FLAGWORDs (e.g., NUCFLASH, BENT SPEAR) associated with 
each category aid prompt processing and distribution of the reports by alerting Higher 
Headquarters to their importance.  The following FLAGWORDs identify reports that the Air 
Force utilizes: 
3.7.1.  PINNACLE (OPREP-3P)  .  This report is used by any unit to provide the National 
Military Command Center and, as appropriate, Combatant Commands and services, with 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
15 
immediate notification of any incident or event where national or international level interest 
is indicated.  Command Posts, on behalf of AF Commanders, will upgrade notification from 
an OPREP-3B to an OPREP-3P for any of the following: 
3.7.1.1.  The occurrence generates a higher level of military action (T-0). 
3.7.1.2.  The occurrence has national-level interest (T-0). 
3.7.1.3.  The occurrence affects international relations and/or is clearly against national 
interests or affects national policy (T-0). 
3.7.1.4.  Causes immediate widespread coverage in news media (national or 
international) (T-0). 
3.7.2.  PINNACLE NUCFLASH (OPREP-3PNF)  .  AF and Space Force Commanders 
will report an OPREP-3PNF for an event, accident, or incident that could create the risk of a 
nuclear war.  (T-0).  This report has the highest precedence in the OPREP-3 reporting 
structure.  AF Commanders will report any of the following as an OPREP-3PNF: 
3.7.2.1.  Ballistic missile launch or space launch (unscheduled or confirmed hostile) (T-
0). 
3.7.2.2.  Re-entering space objects (unscheduled or confirmed hostile) (T-0). 
3.7.2.3.  Loss, potential loss, or degradation of U.S. military space capability when the 
loss or degradation is because of actions by a suspected or known hostile source (T-0). 
3.7.2.4.  Reports of cruise missiles detected and/or launched against the U.S. or U.S. 
interests (T-0). 
3.7.2.5.  Accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained incident involving possible detonation 
of a nuclear weapon producing a nuclear yield (T-0). 
3.7.2.6.  Unauthorized flight, or deviation from an approved flight plan, by a U.S. 
nuclear-armed or nuclear-capable aircraft with the capability to penetrate the airspace of 
another nuclear-capable country (T-0). 
3.7.3.  PINNACLE 
FRONT 
BURNER 
(OPREP-3PFB).  AF 
and 
Space 
Force 
Commanders will report OPREP-3PFB for pre-conflict occurrence of armed attack, 
harassment, or hostile action against US. forces, territory, or interests.  (T-0).  After the 
OPREP-3PFB has been submitted for a specific hostile situation, subsequent OPREP-3P 
reports are not required.  Subsequent reporting of significant mission degradation or heavy 
losses, combat events and minor airfield damage resulting from the armed attack, 
harassment, or hostile action is reported in the SITREP.  This includes the first armed attack, 
first chemical attack, first biological attack, and first radiological (not nuclear) attack.  Report 
any of the following as an OPREP-3PFB: 
3.7.3.1.  Pre-incident indications or warnings.  (T-0). 
3.7.3.2.  Presumptive or definitive identification of the CBRNE substance.  (T-0). 
3.7.3.3.  Methods of hazard detection and verification.  (T-0). 
3.7.3.4.  Potential for further CBRNE substance dissemination and actions to limit

3.7.4.  PINNACLE BROKEN ARROW (OPREP-3PBA)  . AF Commanders will report 
OPREP-3PBA for a U.S. nuclear weapon accident that does not create the risk of a nuclear 
war (T-0). Report any of the following as an OPREP-3PBA: 
3.7.4.1.  Nuclear detonation of a U.S. nuclear weapon (T-0). 
3.7.4.2.  Non-nuclear detonation or burning of a U.S. nuclear weapon (T-0). 
3.7.4.3.  Radioactive contamination from a U.S. nuclear weapon or component (T-0). 
3.7.4.4.  Jettisoning of a U.S. nuclear weapon or component (T-0).

0). 
3.7.5.  PINNACLE EMPTY QUIVER (OPREP-3PEQ)  . AF Commanders will report 
OPREP-3PEQ for the seizure, theft, or loss of a U.S. nuclear weapon (T-0). 
3.7.6.  PINNACLE EMERGENCY DISABLEMENT (OPREP-3PED)  . AF Commanders 
will report OPREP-3PED for operations involving the command disablement or non-violent 
disablement of U.S. nuclear weapons (T-0). 
3.7.7.  PINNACLE EMERGENCY EVACUATION (OPREP-3PEV).  AF Commanders 
will report OPREP-3PEV for any operations involving the emergency evacuation of U.S. 
nuclear weapons (T-0). 
3.7.8.  WHITE PINNACLE (OPREP-3WP).  OPREP-3WP is an exercise report that 
contains simulated time-critical information from operating forces to the National Military 
Command Center and Combatant Commands. OPREP-3WP exercises use OPREP-3P 
procedures and are downward directed by the Combatant Commands to check timeliness of 
select Command Posts and other designated Command and Control nodes. 
3.7.8.1.  Combatant Commands designate the units to receive the exercise message and 
select specific exercise start times. AF Units are required to submit an OPREP-3WP 
acknowledgement to the National Military Command Center via the designated National 
Military Command Center synchronous secure chatroom within a time standard of 20 
minutes, upon receipt of an OPREP-3WP tasking (T-0). 
3.7.8.2.  Units will transmit an OPREP-3WP to the designated National Military 
Command Center synchronous secure chatroom using the format in Figure 3.1 (T-1). 
Units will notify Air Force Watch via phone call once OPREP-3WP is transmitted (T-1).

3.7.9.  BENT SPEAR (OPREP-3BS)  . AF Commanders will report OPREP-3BS for 
incidents involving U.S. nuclear weapons that are of significant interest, but are not 
categorized as OPREP-3PNF or OPREP-3PBA (T-0). OPREP-3BSs use the same timing 
requirements as OPREP-3Ps. 
3.7.10.  FADED GIANT (OPREP-3FG)  . AF Commanders will report OPREP-3FG for 
nuclear reactor or radiological accidents or incidents to the appropriate service headquarters 
(T-0). OPREP-3FGs use the same timing requirements as OPREP-3Ps. 
3.7.11.  BEELINE (OPREP-3B)  . AF Commanders will report OPREP-3B for any event or 
incident that the CSAF has deemed reportable in the CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix and/or 
meets AF-level interest, but does not meet national or international level interest 
requirements (T-1). 
3.7.11.1.  OPREP-3B, Sexually Based, Alleged or Confirmed Crimes. Commanders will 
follow guidance within AFI 90-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) 
Program, when submitting an OPREP-3B meeting this rule (T-1). Specific guidelines for 
submission are as follows: 
3.7.11.2.  Commanders will use the Commander’s Critical Information Requirements 
template in AFI 90-6001, Attachment 4, for all reports that meet the criteria for the CSAF 
Reports Matrix rule ‘Sexually Based, Alleged or Confirmed Crimes’ (T-1).

AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
3.7.11.3.  The Wing Commander or Vice Commander will send reports meeting the rule 
‘Sexually Based, Alleged or Confirmed Crimes’ in the same format directed by AFI 90-
6001, attachment 4, via an encrypted NIPRNET email (T-1). This email should be sent 
directly to Air Force Watch and their respective NAF/MAJCOM Commanders (T-1). The 
Air Force Watch will forward the email to HAF, CSAF, SECAF, and JCS leadership (T-
1). Command Posts will not send OPREP-3Bs meeting this rule, but will advise 
Commanders on the correct procedure (T-1).  NOTE: The Air Force Watch 
organizational email is: usaf.pentagon.af-a3.mbx.afwatch@mail.mil

Note: PINNACLE Nuclear Flash reports are extremely time sensitive and require initial 
reporting within 5 minutes of the incident (T-0). 
3.9.  Report Construction.  Report construction guidance provides standardization, quality, and 
consistency to unit reporting programs.  Reports are formatted based on senior Joint Staff and AF 
leadership direction.  Units will develop templates and checklists that aid in proper report 
formatting and submission (Refer to Figure 3.2 for example).  (T-1). 
3.9.1.  OPREP-3 Message Subject Line.  Regardless of transmission medium, Command 
Posts will format all OPREP-3 subject lines in the following order with the correct content.  
(T-1).  (Refer to Figure 3.2 for example). 
3.9.1.1.  Portion Marking. Command Posts will ensure all subject lines contain a portion 
marking for the classification of the subject line (T-0). The subject line portion marking 
(U, C, S, S/NF, etc.) does NOT identify the overall classification of the report, only the 
subject line. 
3.9.1.2.  Report FLAGWORD (OPREP-3P, OPREP-3PFB, OPREP-3B, etc.). 
3.9.1.3.  Date Time Group of Incident. This time is when the incident occurred, not when 
the incident became reportable. Clarification can always be provided in the narrative to 
explain Date Time Group if incident occurred several days prior to a report. Command 
Posts will not change the Date Time Group as subsequent reports are submitted. (T-1). 
Command Posts will only change the Date Time Group when an OPREP-3B is upgraded 
to an OPREP-3P, and will follow guidance within paragraph 3.9.7 when doing so (T-1). 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
19 
3.9.1.4.  Location Event Occurred.  This is the location of the incident or where the event 
took place.  (T-1). 
3.9.1.5.  Event/Incident and Rule Number.  Used to identify the incident listed in CSAF 
OPREP-3 Reports Matrix and the corresponding rule number.  Use the specific 
event/incident title to match the corresponding event (e.g.  Death or Injury and Rule 8C).  
(T-1). 
3.9.2.  Report Body (Synchronous Secure Chat) or Event Text (Asynchronous Reporting 
System Site).  The body of the report narrative includes the who, what, when, where, how, 
and operational impact of the incident.  In the initial report, provide as much information as 
possible that is known at the time.  Include new information as details unfold.  In subsequent 
reports, do not restate previously stated facts.  Regardless of transmission medium, 
Command Posts will construct the OPREP-3 narrative (event text) in the following manner, 
to include the line headings.  (T-1) (see Figure 3.2 for example): 
3.9.2.1.  Report Type: Initial, Initial/Final, Follow-Up, Final, or Corrected Report. 
3.9.2.2.  Time and Date: Time of Incident in HHMMZ, DD Mon YY format.  For Initial 
and Initial/Final reports, this time will match the Date Time Group of Incident in the 
subject line.  (T-1).  For Corrected Copy, Follow-Up and Final reports this time will 
reflect the time new information was provided or the Follow-Up or Final was approved 
for release by the commander.  (T-1). 
3.9.2.3.  Unit: Include Unit Designator for Unit and Wing or Installation Command Post 
submitting the OPREP.  (T-1).  Regional Command Posts, Command Post associations, 
etc. may utilize the name for their facility authorized by AFMAN 10-207.  (T-1).  (Refer 
to Figure 3.2 for example) 
3.9.2.4.  Member(s): Include member information including age, gender, rank, and 
military status (REGAF, ANG, AFR, or CAP), Unit of Assignment, etc.  If ANG or AFR, 
specify status (e.g.  ANG or AFR-Full Time, ANG or AFR-Drill Status, ANG or AFR- 
Traditional Status).  If Civil Air Patrol, specify status (e.g.  Air Force Assigned Mission 
or Corporate Status).  Multiple members should be separated by semicolons.  If number 
of members and military status is unknown at the time of the report, place “Unknown”.  
Use “N/A” for reports that do not involve a service member.  (Refer to Figure 3.2 for 
example). 
3.9.2.5.  Details: In the narrative, sentence case format, include the; who, what, when, 
where, and how the event/incident occurred (please refer to the CSAF OPREP Reporting 
Guide for additional requirements for each rule).  When aircraft are involved be sure to 
include Mission Design Series, full tail numbers, assigned units, mission numbers, etc.  
When describing a system or equipment malfunction, provide the nature of the 
discrepancies and the functions of that item in plain English terminology (e.g., avionic 
equipment, satellites, hard drives, maintenance laptops).  All acronyms will be spelled out 
within the report.  (T-1). 
3.9.2.6.  Mission Impact/Impairment: The CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix designates 
rules/events that are only reportable if they have an adverse impact on the installation, 
wing, or unit’s mission.  Commanders will provide a clear and detailed description of 
impact to the installation, wing, or unit’s primary mission in this line when required by 
20 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
the CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix.  (T-1).  The use of low, medium, and/or high 
without an explanation is not an acceptable response for mission impact.  The primary 
mission refers to the mission identified in the Mission Statement which directly supports 
the parent MAJCOM or Combatant Command mission (e.g.  an aircraft unit’s primary 
mission is to fly); therefore, any incident that degrades or prevents the flying mission is a 
mission impact.  Conversely, a SIPRnet outage on base that does not impact the flying 
mission would not be considered a mission impact.  Use “N/A” for rule numbers that are 
not dependent on the impact to mission for reportable events. 
3.9.2.7.  Estimated Time in Commission: Identify the estimated time a situation may end, 
a weapon system is expected to return to service, or repair can be completed.  Command 
Posts will format estimated time in commission line as HHMMZ, DD Mon YY.  (T-1).  
Use “N/A” for reports that do not require an estimated time in commission.  (Refer to 
Figure 3.2 for example) 
3.9.2.8.  Point of Contact (POC): This is used after consulting and confirming with the 
appropriate external agency/agencies and informing them that further reports should be 
accomplished through their channels, include agency office symbol and 10-digit DSN 
number.  As a minimum, a POC will be provided for all initial/final and final reports.  (T-
1).  Initial and follow-up reports may use “N/A” in the POC line if a POC is not 
identified at the time of report transmission.  (Refer to Figure 3.2 for example). 
Figure 3.2.  Report Body Example. 
 
 
 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
21 
3.9.3.  Initial and Initial/Final Reports.  Initial and Initial/Final reports should contain as 
much information as immediately available within established time parameters about an 
event or incident.  Command Posts will submit reports in accordance with formatting and 
content requirements within paragraph 3.9  (T-1).  An initial report may only be submitted 
as an Initial/Final report if it contains all of the required information to close the report (in 
accordance with the CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Guide). The CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Guide is 
a living document adjusted as CSAF, CSO, and Government Leaders’ requirements change, 
it 
is

0%2D9AD0%2DCCB335377B8D%7D).  The Air Force Service Watch Cell may ask 
questions during initial reporting to get clarification and/or prompt units to get information 
required by higher headquarters to post in subsequent reports, if unable to include in the 
initial report.  The Air Force Service Watch Cell may ask Commanders/Command Posts 
additional questions after an Initial/Final report has been submitted when required by DoD, 
Joint Staff, and/or HAF Senior Leaders. 
3.9.3.1.  When seven calendar days have elapsed from the Initial Report and a unit is 
unable to obtain all required information in accordance with the CSAF OPREP-3 
Reporting Guide or higher headquarter directed questions, a Final Report will be 
submitted stating “No further information will be provided through OPREP-3 channels”.  
(T-1).  Identify approved POCs, agencies, and contact numbers.  (T-1).  As required, 
units will coordinate extensions through their MAJCOM Command Center with the Air 
Force Service Watch Cell no later than the seventh calendar day from the submission of 
the Initial Report.  (T-1).  All unit extension requests will include a reason and estimated 
close out date.  (T-1).  Units will post extension approval to the additional comments 
portion of OPREP-3 SharePoint site with the reason and close out date.  (T-1). 
3.9.3.2.  The statement “Further reporting through XXX channels” is used after 
consulting and confirming with the appropriate external agency/agencies that further 
reports will be accomplished through their channels.  Include agency office symbol and 
contact number (through the Point of Contact line).  This statement is not a blanket 
statement and will be included in the details line. 
3.9.3.3.  Command Posts will submit the highest type report when multiple rules overlap 
(i.e.  submit report as PINNACLE when event meets BEELINE criteria and PINNACLE 
criteria). 
(T-0).  For OPREP-3s meeting criteria for multiple rule numbers, only one rule number and title 
is reflected in the subject line.  Use the most severe incident in the  subject line and identify 
additional rule numbers from the CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix at the end of the details 
section, but prior to the further reporting statement of the synchronous (secure 
chat)/asynchronous (reporting system site) report (i.e., Rules XX, XX and XX also apply). 
 
 
22 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
3.9.4.  Follow-Up reports.  These reports are essential to keep leaders at higher headquarters 
informed of developing situations and to provide additional details as they are learned.  
Command Posts will format follow-up reports in accordance with paragraph 3.9 and 
provide new or updated information in the details section.  (T-1).  Command Posts should 
not repeat information previously reported in the details section of the Initial or previous 
Follow-Up reports.  Follow-Up reports are posted in synchronous secure chat room PRIOR 
to posting in the asynchronous reporting system site in accordance with paragraph 3.11 
3.9.5.  Corrected Copy reports.  Command Posts will submit a correction if an error is 
noticed in content (e.g., incorrect facts, incorrect timing), after submitting the asynchronous 
web blog report.  (T-1).  Command Posts will format Corrected Copy reports in accordance 
with para 3.9  and post to synchronous secure chat.  (T-1).  Command Posts will also include 
a statement at the end of the details section stating what information was updated (e.g., 
Corrected tail number of aircraft, Corrected unit identification for member).  (T-1).  
Corrected Copy reports are posted in synchronous secure chat room PRIOR to posting in the 
asynchronous reporting system site in accordance with paragraph 3.11 
3.9.6.  Final reports.  These reports provide required information not previously reported and 
complete event/incident reporting.  All Final reports will end with the applicable statement, 
“No further information will be provided through OPREP-3 channels” in the details section.  
(T-1).  Higher Headquarters Command Center elements may ask command posts additional 
information after a Final report is submitted when directed.  Final reports are posted in 
synchronous secure chat room PRIOR to posting in the asynchronous reporting system site in 
accordance with paragraph 3.11 
3.9.7.  Upgrading OPREP-3s. Units will upgrade OPREP-3Bs if Follow-Up information to an 
event/incident meets the criteria of a higher-level report (i.e., BEELINE to PINNACLE) (T-
1). Command Posts will report the upgraded report as an Initial report at the higher level (T-
1). In the upgraded Initial report, provide all previously reported information and known 
facts. 
3.9.7.1.  The Date Time Group for the subject line of the upgraded report will be the time 
the event occurred or the information was received that made the report a PINNACLE 
(i.e. the time the event became more severe in nature) (T-0). The upgraded report will 
reference the original report’s Date Time Group as the last line of the details section if 
different (T-1). The original (lower-level) report automatically closes upon submission of 
the upgraded (higher-level) report. 
3.9.7.2.  MAJCOM-level reports (e.g., MAJCOM Commander’s Critical Information 
Reports or equivalent) are not OPREP-3s and will not follow “upgrading OPREP- 3” 
guidance.  (T-1).  When information from a MAJCOM report meets OPREP-3 criteria, 
the report will be submitted as an Initial OPREP-3.  (T-1). 
 
 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018

3.10.  Synchronous Reporting Processes.  Synchronous communication is where all parties 
involved in the communication are present at the same time.  Do not delay the initial 
synchronous notification to obtain additional information.  (T-1).  This notification can be a one 
line entry about the event.  The primary medium for transmitting all OPREP-3 synchronous 
reports will be designated through AF Command and Control Controller Information File.  (T-1).  
The alternate means for submitting a synchronous report is as directed in paragraph 3.12.1  The 
initial synchronous notification time is the time inputted into the system.  Use Follow-Up 
notifications and reporting to provide additional information as it becomes available.  
AFSWC/MAJCOMs assess unit reports for possible higher category reporting requirements. 
3.10.1.  Units submitting an OPREP-3 BEELINE synchronous report will enter it into the 
designated AF synchronous secure chat room.  (T-1).  OPREP-3 PINNACLE reports will be 
entered directly into the National Military Command Center designated synchronous secure 
chat room.  (T-1).  MAJCOMs will not publish guidance that mandates units receive 
MAJCOM approval/quality check before submitting to the Air Force Service Watch Cell (i.e.  
MAJCOMs, to include ANG and Combined Forces Air Component Commander Watch, will 
not require units to post OPREP-3s in their synchronous secure room prior to posting in the 
AF chat room).  Units will reference paragraph 3.9 for proper report construction.  (T-1).  
Units will be logged into the synchronous secure chat rooms as “(Unit, Rank, Last Name)”.  
(T-2). 
3.10.2.  AFSWC and MAJCOM Command Centers should acknowledge wing/unit reports 
within 5 minutes of the posting.  Acknowledgement can be in any hierarchical order.  In the 
event that a higher headquarters element does not acknowledge within 5 minutes, the 
wing/unit should contact their parent MAJCOM Command Center for assistance.  AFSWC is 
the highest level of required acknowledgement, unless an OPREP-3 PINNACLE at which 
time DOD National Joint Operations and Intelligence Center is the highest level of 
acknowledgement required.  Units will continue to monitor the designated AF synchronous 
secure chat room after submitting a report until the MAJCOM, AFSWC, and/or the National 
Joint Operations and Intelligence Center have received required information.  (T-1).  Units 
will not submit their asynchronous report until approved by AFSWC.  (T-1).  AFSWC will 
clear units by stating, “Please post your report within one hour and notify this office once 
completed”.  (T-1).  This serves as the official AF approval time.  Units will then post the 
report in the asynchronous reporting system site.  (T-1). 
3.10.3.  Units may submit exercise OPREP-3s to AFSWC at any time using the designated 
AF exercise synchronous secure chat room.  When mission dictates, AFSWC attempts to 
reply to exercise messages and provide feedback on reports submitted.  Command Posts may 
submit OPREP-3 reports for training, but all exercise reports must state “EXERCISE” at the 
beginning and end of the report.  (T-1). 
3.11.  Asynchronous Reports.  Asynchronous communication does not require that all parties 
involved in the communication be present and available at the same time. Examples of this 
include: email (the receiver does not have to be logged on when the sender sends the email 
message), and discussion boards, which allow conversations to evolve and community to 
develop over a period of time. Units will submit an asynchronous report for all OPREP-3s (T-1). 
3.11.1.  Command Posts will follow the AF system guidance/instructions to post 
asynchronous reports.  (T-1). 
24 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
3.11.2.  Notify AFSWC in designated AF synchronous secure chat room once report has 
been posted to the asynchronous reporting site. 
3.11.3.  Units may submit asynchronous exercise OPREP-3s to the AFSWC at any time 
using the asynchronous reporting site.  When mission dictates, the AFSWC attempts to reply 
to exercise messages and provide feedback on reports submitted.  Command Posts may 
submit OPREP-3 reports for training but all exercise reports must state “EXERCISE” at the 
beginning and end of the report.  (T-1). 
3.12.  Synchronous /Asynchronous Outages. 
3.12.1.  Synchronous Secure Chat Outage: 
3.12.1.1.  Units will notify the next higher headquarters that has access to synchronous 
secure chat for input (NAF, MAJCOM Command Center, AFSWC).  (T-1).  Contact 
information for AFSWC and other Command Centers may be found on the 1C3 Intelink 
page as “Worldwide Command Post listing”. 
3.12.1.2.  In the event of an AF-wide synchronous secure chat outage, units will contact 
their next higher headquarters to convene a voice conference with AFSWC.  (T-1). 
3.12.2.  Asynchronous reporting site outage: 
3.12.2.1.  If synchronous secure chat is functional, post report to synchronous secure chat 
and state that the unit is experiencing an asynchronous reporting site outage.  The 
applicable higher headquarters will post the report to the asynchronous reporting site.  If 
the asynchronous reporting site outage is AF-wide, the wing/unit will upload all reports 
submitted during the outage to asynchronous upon system return.  (T-1). 
3.12.2.2.  If the asynchronous reporting site and synchronous secure chat are both not 
functional, the AF unit will contact their higher headquarters to convene a conference 
with AFSWC and voice the report; the AF unit will follow-up with an email (record 
copy) on SIPRnet to next higher headquarters that has access to the asynchronous 
reporting site for input.  (T-1). 
3.12.2.3.  If SIPRnet outage is AF-wide, the AF units will submit reports via secure 
telephone conference with the MAJCOM and AFSWC (National Military Command 
Center as required); the wing/unit will upload all reports submitted during the outage to 
the asynchronous reporting site upon system return.  (T-0).  Initial voice conferences will 
cover both the voice and record copy reports.  (T-0). 
3.12.3.  Regardless of the outage, AFSWC immediately relays all PINNACLE reports to the 
National Military Command Center.  (T-0).  For reports requiring voice notification within a 
5-minute time limit, AFSWC will connect the National Military Command Center with the 
reporting unit’s conference.  (T-0). 
3.13.  CSAF Special Reporting Items.  These are events/incidents that are of personal interest 
to the SECAF/CSAF/CSO.  The C2 policy and produces office updates the CSAF OPREP-3 
Reporting Matrix when directed by the CSAF/CSO.  CSAF-Special Reporting Items remain in 
effect until superseded or rescinded.

Chapter 4 
COMMANDER'S SITUATION REPORT (SITREP) 
4.1.  Subject and Purpose.  To keep the MAJCOMs, services, Joint Staff, and SECDEF 
apprised of existing political, military, and operational situations/plans and to keep commanders 
advised of a unit’s ability to meet requirements outlined in approved plans. The SITREP is a 
narrative report that informs and enables higher levels of command to evaluate resources and 
prepare for potential effects of ongoing situations. The commander or designated alternate shall 
be responsible for timely and accurate SITREP reporting (T-1). Situation reporting should be 
accomplished for, but not limited to, the following: 
4.1.1.  Involvement in critical national or international situations 
4.1.2.  Involvement in natural or manmade disasters and/or emergency-relief efforts 
4.1.3.  Significant operational deficiencies that affect mission readiness 
4.1.4.  Other activities or ongoing operations to include defense support to civilian 
authorities.  All Defense Support to Civilian Authorities events should be reported as 
described in Chapter 6 if meeting guidance within CSAF OPREP-3 matrix. 
4.1.5.  Units receiving aircraft or personnel due to natural disaster evacuations 
4.1.6.  When directed by a higher headquarters (Combatant Command, Joint Staff, DAF, 
MAJCOM). 
4.2.  Submitted By.  Commanders at all levels will submit SITREPs when on-going events 
warrant (T-1). 
4.3.  Submitted To.  SITREPs are provided to the MAJCOM and AFSWC.  AFSWC transmits 
SITREPs to the National Military Command Center for Joint Staff directed reports.  Units will 
follow Combatant Command guidance when directed to submit SITREPs to a Combatant 
Command.  (T-1). 
4.4.  Submission Timing.  If submission timing is not directed by higher headquarters, reports 
are submitted daily for the duration of the activity or operation.  AF Units will submit reports no 
later than 0800Z, reflecting data current as of 0600Z, unless specified otherwise by DAF or a 
Combatant Commander directive.  (T-1). 
4.5.  Submission.  The primary means for transmitting SITREPs is via MS Word or Adobe PDF 
file in the asynchronous reporting site.  AF units will post the SITREP as an attachment to an 
event (similar to OPREP-3 submission) and format the subject line of the SITREP in accordance 
with paragraph 4.7.1 (T-1).  When posting a SITREP in the asynchronous reporting site, units 
use the subject line of the SITREP in the Event Title section and copy the Commanders 
Evaluation (Comments) from the SITREP and paste them into the Event Text block.  The 
SITREP is added as an attachment. 
4.5.1.  After posting the record copy SITREP in the asynchronous reporting site, units enter 
the Subject Line of the report in the designated synchronous secure chat room and state the 
report has been posted to the asynchronous reporting site.  Refer to paragraph 4.7.1 for 
subject line format.  (T-1). 
26 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
4.5.2.  When primary means are unavailable, transmit reports via SIPRnet email to the 
MAJCOM and AFSWC.  (T-1).  The wing/unit will upload all reports submitted during the 
outage to the asynchronous reporting site upon system return.  (T-1). 
4.6.  General Reporting Instructions. 
4.6.1.  Duplicate reporting is not desired; however, information available in another Joint 
Staff report should be referenced to ensure operational impacts are noted. 
4.6.2.  Any higher headquarters level in the reporting chain may direct additional reporting 
requirements.  AFSWC is authorized to request any additional or amplifying information on 
past events, current operations, or planned actions. 
4.7.  Report Construction.  AF SITREPs report significant factors relating primarily to 
readiness, mobilization personnel, force protection, and logistics.  Report content should 
highlight key activities and build on previous reports.  Brevity is paramount.  The below 
categories provide a list of subparagraphs.  These paragraphs are used as a general SITREP 
template.  Specific categories may be directed based on the event or operation and information 
required. 
4.7.1.  SUBJECT LINE: The subject line is the first (top) line in all AF SITREPs.  The 
subject line includes the following: AF SITREP, Date Time Group of the report, Unit, Base,

HURRICANE CONDITION/TROPICAL CYCLONE CONDITIONS OF READINESS 
REPORTING 
5.1.  OPREP-3B Hurricane/Tropical Cyclone (Typhoon) Conditions of Readiness.  The 
terms “Hurricane” and “Typhoon” are regional specific names for strong tropical cyclones. In the 
Atlantic Ocean or the Eastern Pacific Ocean (east of the international dateline) the storm is called 
a “Hurricane.” In the Western Pacific Ocean (west of the dateline) the storm is called a 
“Typhoon.” 
5.2.  Conditions of readiness.  Installations will include severe weather plans (including 
Hurricane Conditions (HURCON)/Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness (TCCOR)) into the 
Installation Emergency Management Plan 10-2 for the hazards likely to affect the installation. 
5.2.1.  Specific to the Air Force, installations use Hurricane Conditions/ Tropical Cyclone 
Conditions of Readiness warning codes to prepare for an impending hurricane or typhoon.  
The information to guide installation Hurricane Conditions/ Tropical Cyclone Conditions of 
Readiness codes provides arrival timelines and wind speed sheltering and evacuation 
decisions.  Those hurricane and tropical cyclone conditions are listed in Table 5.1 
5.2.2.  Tropical storms and hurricanes that come ashore can also generate tornadoes.  
Installations subject to tornadoes provide notification of watches and warnings using the 
Installation Notification and Warning System.  A tornado watch is issued for the installation 
by the regionally responsible US Air Force Operational Weather Squadron (see AFVA 15-
137, Operational Weather Squadron Areas of Responsibility) when weather conditions are 
capable of producing a tornado.  A tornado warning is issued by the regionally responsible 
US Air Force Operational Weather Squadron (or local USAF Weather flight in time-critical 
situations) when a tornado is confirmed by radar or sighted by spotters.  Personnel in the 
affected area should seek shelter immediately.  Tornado warnings can be issued without a 
tornado watch in effect.

around hazards (e.g.  downed power lines, unstable structures).  
Non-essential personnel are asked to remain. indoors. 
Note: (1) Commanders shall follow Combatant Commander guidance if that guidance 
conflicts with Air Force policy.  (T-1). 
Note: (2) Commanders may direct an installation to stay in HURCON/TCCOR 5 for an 
entire Tropical Cyclone or Hurricane season if desired.  This is discouraged due to the 
potential of the base/installation population becoming complacent in a prolonged 
HURCON/TCCOR 5 status.  (T-1). 
5.3.  Report submission timelines.  Command Posts will submit an OPREP-3B initial report 
when a commander directs a change in readiness condition and follow-up reports will be 
submitted for each subsequent change or when any of the following actions have been directed.  
(T-1).  During General Hurricane Season, an OPREP-3B Initial Report will not be submitted for 
Hurricane Condition/Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness 5 if declaring Hurricane 
Condition 5 only because of the season starting. 
5.3.1.  Aircraft and/or Personnel Evacuation Decision.  The time the decision was made; time 
when evacuation begins; the HURCON/TCCOR status; any updates or reference to the 
evacuation plan.  Reported as a Follow-Up report to the OPREP-3 HURCON/TCCOR 
Change. 
 
 
30 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
5.3.2.  Aircraft and/or Personnel Evacuation Started.  The time evacuation began; the 
Hurricane Condition / Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness status; any updates or 
references to the evacuation plan.  Report the status of evacuees and shelter-in-place 
personnel prior to and after a natural disaster, in accordance with the guidelines in AFI 36-
3802, Personnel Accountability in Conjunction with Natural Disasters or National 
Emergencies.  Do not initiate a dual/separate report for aircraft and/or personnel evacuation.  
Units will report the evacuation as a Follow-Up report to the Initial OPREP-3 
HURCON/TCCOR.  (T-1). 
5.3.3.  Aircraft and/or Personnel Evacuation Complete. Report the time when all aircraft are 
at the designated refuge base; and any updates as required. Reported as Follow-Up report. 
5.3.4.  Additionally, submit an “All Clear” report after the storm has passed and there is no 
longer operational impact to the installation. Submit the report using the normal Hurricane 
Condition / Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness report template and annotate “All 
Clear” in the current level portion. 
5.3.5.  Aircraft Reconstitution and/or Personnel Return to home station. Report the time 
when all aircraft have returned to home station. Report when personnel have been cleared to 
return to home station. Reported as Follow-Up or Final once reconstitution is complete. 
5.4.  General Hurricane Condition / Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness Reporting 
Procedures: 
5.4.1.  Each event of the same Hurricane Condition / Tropical Cyclone Conditions of 
Readiness is reported as Follow-Up reports rather than separate reports. 
5.4.2.  Consolidation of Reports. When events outpace the decision process, merge reports 
when possible (e.g., Hurricane Condition declaration with evacuation decision). If there are 4 
hours or more between stages, do not consolidate reports. 
5.4.3.  Formatting for the OPREP-3 subject line is as directed in paragraph 3.9.1, and 
formatting for ‘Report Type’ within the report body is as directed in paragraph 3.9.1.2  
Formatting for and information to include within the remainder of the report is as directed 
within report templates.  The report template and an example are provided in Figure 5.1 and 
Figure 5.2, respectively. 
5.4.4.  Follow-Up Hurricane Condition/Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness reports.  
Follow-up reports in synchronous secure chat will include the subject line and only the 
sections containing updated/new information.  (T-1).  The same procedure applies for 
submission into the asynchronous reporting site.  (T-1).  This process does not apply to any 
other report type referenced in this AFMAN, to include OPREP-3s, SITREPs, or Defense 
Support to Civilian Authorities.  (T-1).  When units are cleared by AFSWC to post a Follow- 
Up, Final, or Correction report in the asynchronous reporting system site, they will only post 
new or updated information into the “Comment” section.  (T-1).

designated asynchronous reporting site and will notify AFSWC via the AF synchronous chat 
room following submission.  (T-1). 
6.2.2.  Command Posts will submit Follow-Up reports in synchronous/asynchronous means 
as significant changes or circumstances occur (T-1). Follow-Up reports in both synchronous 
and asynchronous mediums will only include the Subject line and the updated/corrected lines 
(T-1). 
6.2.3.  For assets utilized for more than 24 hours and/or if media attention occurs, AF units 
are required to provide a Follow-Up Defense Support to Civilian Authorities report once 
daily, until the event is terminated or the asset returns to home base/installation, in 
accordance with DoDD 3025.18 and DoDI 3025.21.  (T-0). 
6.2.4.  If no change has occurred, units will post in the designated AF synchronous chat room 
the subject line and a statement saying “No changes in the last 24 hours”.  (T-1)  Upon 
AFSWC acknowledgment and approval, units will then make a post in reporting site under 
the previous asynchronous post stating “No changes in the last 24 hours.  (T-1). 
6.2.5.  AF units will submit all Defense Support to Civilian Authorities messages with 
AFSWC, AFNORTH National Security Emergency Preparedness, and parent MAJCOM 
selected as an “Affected Area” in the asynchronous reporting system site.  (T-0) 
6.2.6.  AF units will submit Defense Support to Civilian Authorities reports in accordance 
with Paragraph 3.12 during synchronous/asynchronous outages.  (T-1) 
6.3.  Defense Support to Civilian Authorities Report Format/Construction.  Use template in 
Figure 6.1 to construct Defense Support to Civilian Authorities reports. All bolded items will be 
included in the report body (T-1). Units should use “N/A” when information is not applicable.

Chapter 7 
CRESCENT EDGE (OPREP-3CE) 
7.1.  Subject and Purpose.  “Crescent Edge” is a type of report used to identify that a significant 
issue has occurred with a Special Access Program.  The AF OPREP-3CE report allows units 
operating Special Access Programs to use the operational reporting channel to advise their 
program managers of events or incidents that meet OPREP-3 reporting criteria.  The OPREP-
3CE report is the single reporting channel for all Special Access Program units reporting 
incidents to higher headquarters.  An OPREP-3CE report is submitted when an authorized 
individual from the unit has determined an event or incident involving a Special Access Program 
warrants higher-level awareness.  OPREP-3CE voice reports are forwarded through command 
post channels to MAJCOM Command Centers and the AFSWC. 
7.1.1.  Affected unit Command Posts will submit voice reports through normal command 
post channels to immediately notify the Joint Staff, or Air Force, of significant activities 
involving Special Access Programs operating in accordance with AFI 16-701, Management, 
Administration and Oversight of Special Access Programs.  (T-1).  The flag words 
BEELINE and PINNACLE are used to reference the Special Access Program management 
level to be contacted.  Regardless of the Special Access Program management level, AFSWC 
will address AF/A3XX (HQ USAF Special Programs Division) and SAF/AAZ (Air Force 
Special Access Program Central Office).  MAJCOMs establish procedures for contacting 
program managers at and below the MAJCOM level. 
7.1.2.  The unit with the Special Access Program, not the command post, will initiate 
OPREP-3CE reporting and notify the command post of an OPREP-3CE report to be 
submitted.  (T-3).  No program names or incident details are included in the report.  The 
command post sends the report up the chain to the appropriate level.  It is the reporting unit’s 
responsibility to determine the level of report and to provide all information.  After report 
submission command post performs no other action. 
7.1.3.  Command Posts will report AF OPREP-3CE via voice conference with MAJCOM and 
AFSWC.  Command Posts will not report via synchronous/asynchronous means.  (T-1).  The 
only information passed in the voice conference is the name, contact number and office 
symbol of the person initiating the report, and contact information of the program manager if 
different from initiator.

Chapter 8 
EMERGENCY MASS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM 
8.1.  Purpose.  The Air Force requires a single EMNS to alert and warn 100% of assigned forces 
quickly and effectively of an emergent event.  (T-0).  The EMNS is used for Command and 
Control of an installation’s forces and assets, with primary resources used during: Increased 
Force Protection Conditions, Information Protection Implementation, Wing Recall, Force 
Generation, Crisis Action Team Recall/Relocation, Personnel Accountability and Emergency 
Mass Notification (i.e.  Active Shooters, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear 
[CBRN] incidents, Natural disasters, etc.).  (T-0). 
8.2.  System Capabilities.  The USAF’s baseline requirements for an installation’s EMNS are 
the following components: 
8.2.1.  Network Alerting System: which consists of e-mail, text messaging, and desktop pop-
up notifications to installation personnel (T-1). 
8.2.2.  Telephone Alerting System: which consists of the capability of dialing work, home, 
mobile numbers and Short Message Service text (T-1). 
8.2.3.  Giant Voice Integration: which consists of the capability to integrate an installations 
current installed Giant Voice system with the EMNS at all Main Operating Bases.  (T-1). 
8.2.4.  Smart Device Applications: which consists of the capability for notification and global 
positioning to alert targeted members/installations/sites within 20 miles of an event, and 100 
miles if events escalate (T-1). 
8.2.5.  Cloud Solution: which consists of the capability to decrease the information 
technology (IT) footprint and provide significant savings, while improving end-user services 
and cybersecurity (T-1). 
8.2.6.  Hierarchical Infrastructure Notification Capability: which consists of connecting 
installations, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and Headquarters Air Force to provide rapid 
interoperable notification of an event (T-1). 
8.2.7.  Minimal Training: which consists of minimal training to begin immediate use of the 
system (i.e. web-based tutorials for personnel as needed) (T-1). 
8.2.8.  Dependent Access: which consists of allowing AF personnel the option to allow 
dependents to receive notifications (T-1). 
8.2.9.  Turnkey: which consists of a system capable with minimal to no impact a seamless 
transition to an interim ENMS solution, reaching operational status in less than 90 days.  (T-
1). 
8.2.10.  Connection to Authoritative sources: ability to connect to authoritative data sources 
for pulling of military, civilian and dependent contact information.  (T-1).  Members should 
then be able to verify the information is correct and current.  Note: Deployed locations will 
implement all capabilities listed within paragraph 8.2 that are feasible for the location (i.e. a 
location without cellphone coverage or smart phones will not implement procedures for 
such).  (T-1). 
38 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
8.2.11.  EMNS Program Capabilities: EMNS shall be capable of providing both alert 
notification as well as confirmation of receipt of the notification.  (T-1). 
8.3.  EMNS Program Management:  All AF EMNS components (records and overall system 
management) will be managed by a Program Management Office, under guidance and direction 
of Air Combat Command.  (T-1). 
8.4.  Notification Requirements.  Per DoD Instruction 6055.17, DOD Emergency Managemen 
(EM)t Program, Chapter 5, network alerting system solutions will ensure that alert notifications 
to anyone connected to the AFNet and manually loaded ‘.com’ email addresses be issued 
notification within 2 minutes of incident notification or initiated personnel accountability.  (T-0).  
In addition, the EMNS notification must reach a target audience of 90 percent or more of on and 
off-installation personnel with specific protective action recommendations (mass warning) and 
100 percent of assigned Emergency Management resources, including first responders, first 
receivers, and emergency responders within 10 minutes of initiation.  (T-0).  Within 1 hour after 
initiation, EMNS should reach 100% of the on and off- installation personnel.  (T-0).  The 
solution will ensure the systems Network Alerting System, Telephone Alerting System, and 
Giant Voice/in-building EMNS alerting system modules are fully integrated, allowing single 
click activation of pre-defined emergency scenario alerts.  (T-1).  The net-centric system will 
also include provisions for secure communication, authentication, and encryption using DoD 
and10948 PKI-encryption technologies and Common Access Card (CAC) authentication for 
government owned devices.  (T-0).  The network alerting system solution must support standard 
network ports and protocols.  (T-0). 
8.4.1.  Alert notifications loaded in the procured mass notification system (i.e. Duress, Field 
Reporting, etc.) originating from personnel at off-installation facilities should strive to be 
initiated within two minutes of incident verification, after contact is made to local emergency 
response forces by dialing 911 (or equivalent emergency center). 
8.4.2.  The net-centric systems must comply with Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) 
2013 
change

section 
3.10 
Net-Centric 
Alerting 
System 
(NCAS), 
(https://www.disa.mil/~/media/Files/DISA/Services/UCCO/UCR-2013-Change2/UCR-
2013-Change2.pdf), and be approved in accordance on the DoDI 8100.04. Unified 
Capability Approved Products List (APL).  (T-0) 
8.5.  Personally Identifiable Information.  Personally Identifiable Information data in the 
Emergency Mass Notification System database is protected as required by all federal laws and 
regulations.  (T-0).  Global Positioning System (GPS) data will only be accessed by the system 
to transmit notifications to personnel in the impacted area for the purpose of providing an 
emergency alert.  (T-0).  All generated records and reports will be protected as FOR OFFICIAL 
USE ONLY and will be deleted in accordance with the records disposition schedule.  (T-0).  
GPS coordinates will only be collected from personal devices when the user voluntarily activates 
the location/GPS feature.  (T-0).  All GPS coordinates will be overwritten within 60 minutes of 
the notification.  (T-0). 
8.5.1.  All levels of leadership will proactively educate users about the features and benefits 
of EMNS.  In addition, they will provide information on how the EMNS can collect an 
individual’s GPS coordinates, how those will be used and stored, and how individuals can 
opt out of this feature.  (T-1).  Features such as mobile applications can be downloaded to ten 
devices to ensure a member’s family is protected with emergency notifications. 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
39 
8.5.2.  All government cellphones will include the EMNS mobile applications software.  The 
app on government cellphone will be activated during hours the member is required to carry 
the cellphone for government duty.  (T-1). 
8.6.  User Interface.  EMNS user interface will be managed by authorized administrative 
account holders in the command post (i.e., scenario managers) who can implement the various 
scenarios built, or create scenarios as needed to support a particular situation.  (T-1).  Data will 
be accessed on a need-to-know basis through administrative accounts.  (T-1).  Administrative 
account holders and scenario managers must have the capability to add, edit, delete, and import 
or export database information for AF personnel.  (T-1).  Administrators must also be able to 
generate metric data to support Commander’s personnel accountability requirements (e.g., what 
members have or have not been accounted for in the current scenario, with no Personally 
Identifiable Information data).  (T-1).  A single letter, signed by the Commander owning the 
Command Center or Command Post, will appoint scenario managers, publishers, and distro list 
managers for each scenario established, for each MAJCOM/wing or unit.  (T-1).  Scenarios may 
be command-wide or wing/unit driven and will then be managed by the appropriate MAJCOM, 
wing, or unit. 
8.6.1.  Network Interface Requirements.  All deployed computers are required to 
communicate through Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Secure (443).  (T-0). 
8.6.2.  Telephone alerting must be provided by a fully integrated telephone alerting system 
capability in a centralized net-centric architecture for use throughout the Air Force by main 
operating bases that are run by the Air Force (Joint bases run by other Services fall under 
their rule set).  (T-1).  Response results from telephone voice, Short Message Service text 
messaging, and email alerts will be fully integrated into existing EMNS reporting 
capabilities.  (T-1).  All Telephone Alerting System capabilities must be 100% interoperable 
with the Network Alerting System.  (T-1).  All bases and installations run by the Air Force 
and on Air Force networks are subject to the EMNS rules of this manual.  (T-1). 
8.6.3.  The Telephone Alerting System communication capability must enable dialing to 
mobile or landline phones, with an audio notification generated automatically using text-to- 
speech technology.  (T-1).  Telephone Alerting System must include a closed loop 
communication allowing receipt of response from users.  (T-1).  EMNS software must 
include an integrated capability that simultaneously dials user telephone numbers via leased 
lines through commercial communication centers.  (T-1).  Telephonic delivery devices are 
useful in recall and personnel accountability scenarios when reaching out to a relatively small 
number of recipients; therefore, text, email, and smart applications should be the primary 
method during off duty hours.  Those without smart applications on cellphones will still have 
the ability to receive by text and email.  Phone lines and wireless networks may be damaged 
during a disaster; therefore, text messaging and cellphones must be an integral part of EMNS, 
due to the relatively few “bytes” of data, being sent via these methods emergency messages 
might transmit.  Note: Calls, texts, and data to non-government or personal cellphones could 
incur charges to an individual if they do not have sufficient cellular minutes or a text 
messaging data plan. 
8.6.4.  Members should be notified of what data is being collected, how the data will be used, 
how long the AF will maintain the records, how individuals may opt-out of the data 
collecting features, and what costs a user may incur from using the EMNS application. 
40 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
8.6.5.  Security Consideration.  Desktop software must operate with the AF Standard 
Desktop Configuration.  (T-0).  All communication shall be accomplished over Secure 
Socket Layer, and use client certificates found in the CAC to identify the user.  (T-1). 
8.6.6.  Notifications selected for Giant Voice broadcast must be worded carefully to insure 
best Text-to-Voice translation.  Numbers, acronyms and abbreviations do not translate well 
and may not be understandable over Giant Voice system. 
8.7.  Scenario Development.  There are three common uses of EMNS: 1) physical and personal 
security; 2) specialized recalls (e.  g., Crisis Action Teams and Emergency Operations Centers); 
and 3) to initiate personnel accountability.  When developing scenarios, use the guidelines in this 
section to ensure personnel are notified quickly and efficiently. 
8.7.1.  Emergency situations where immediate notifications are needed include: physical 
security, significant/life threatening weather or natural disaster events (tornado, hurricane, 
tsunami, earthquake, wild fire, blizzard, etc.), base closures, wing recalls, Crisis Actions 
Team, Threat Working Group, and Emergency Operations Center activations and other 
events impacting personnel or property.  Keywords to think of are mass, quick, specialized 
response, and must reach when determining the scenario components (e.g., transmission 
device and accountability). 
8.7.2.  During scenario development, consider who requires the notification, what devices 
notifications should be sent through, and other considerations listed within paragraph 8.9 
8.8.  Mass Alerting To All Affected Personnel.  (T-1) 
8.8.1.  On-base mass alerting is best done by desktop, Short Message Service text, mobile 
application, and Giant Voice. Duty email may not be very effective, as users need to be at 
their desk and open an email to react. Duty phone will not be useful for installation-wide 
(mass) notifications; base telephone switches are incapable of processing base- wide or mass 
telephone calls in a timely manner. Duty phone notifications should only be used for targeted 
audiences (e.g., Crisis Action Team recall). 
8.8.2.  Off-base mass alerting is best done using Short Message Service texts, mobile 
application, and personal email due to the “quick reach to the masses” nature. Phone calls 
should be considered as a secondary channel due to limited resources (phone ports) and 
potential associated costs to users. 
8.8.3.  Developing alerts targeted to specific teams or groups (e.g., security forces, Crisis 
Action Team, Emergency Operations Center, etc.) are used to provide specific instructions 
for these select personnel. Use this capability when requirement is to notify specific 
personnel as soon as possible with specific information or instructions. 
8.8.4.  Device notification order is important.  Contact any device available as authorized by 
paragraph 8.13 and Table 8.1: personal computer, telephone, cellphones via voice, email, 
Short Message Service, Mobile application (only if family should be made aware of the event 
or if units are in the field) as supported and used by the individual. 
8.8.5.  Accounting status is critical and will follow the Air Force Personnel Accountability 
and Assessment System processes and procedures as directed by Air Force leaders. 
 
 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
41 
8.9.  Utilization.  Installations will no longer use EMNS to  connect with cellphones, home 
phone, the mobile application, and text messaging for routine weather notifications, however 
may utilize it for significant/life threatening weather or natural disaster events (tornado, 
hurricane, tsunami, earthquake, wild fire, major blizzard, etc.).  (T-1).  Authorized uses are as 
shown in paragraph 8.13 and Table 8.1 
8.9.1.  Routine weather notifications were deemed nuisances and one of the primary reasons 
personnel opt out or ignore notifications. These notifications can still be transmitted to users 
via the desktop pop-up feature and broadcasted over radios (e.g., Maintenance and Security 
Forces). 
8.9.2.  All bases are authorized to create separate channels for other agencies (e.g., Security 
Forces, Emergency Operations Center, or a squadron).  This is allowed in order to manage 
and transmit mass notifications internally to their specific units or personnel working outside 
the normal office environment (flight line, hangars, construction sites, etc.).  This is 
authorized because they are not transmitting to the entire base populace which is only 
accomplished by the base command post.  These notifications will only be published for unit 
events, emergencies, or accountability recalls, etc. 
8.10.  EMNS Recalls.  EMNS recalls can encompass an entire installation, group, or squadron, 
but should be focused for specific teams (e.g., Crisis Action Team, Emergency Operations 
Center).  Mass alerting via EMNS targets the entire population, eliminating the need for 
hierarchical call-trees; however, the call-tree scenario should be used with the system when the 
person doing the notification is at the top of the hierarchy.  Most commercially available 
telephone alert systems enable approximately 1,500 phone calls per minute and will overwhelm 
base telephone systems if used to notify the entire base populace.  Mobile applications do not 
overwhelm base telephone systems and can notify up to 100,000 personnel a minute. 
8.11.  Accountability 
8.11.1.  Accountability proves invaluable during a natural disaster or mass casualty situation. 
The need to positively know the status of personnel and/or dependents is extremely important 
and can be accomplished by selecting a targeting method (e.g., squadron, building number, 
etc.). 
8.11.2.  Response options are crucial to accountability and will follow the Air Force 
Personnel Accountability and Assessment System processes and procedures as directed by 
Air Force leaders (T-1). 
8.11.3.  The Air Force Service Watch Cell will distribute AFPAAS messages to MAJCOM 
command centers by e-mail. This e-mail will include verbatim information that will be sent 
via EMNS.  MAJCOMs will forward this AFPAAS message to their applicable units. Unit 
command post will in turn distribute verbatim via EMNS to the entire base populace. The 
AFPAAS alerts will be published in two different versions based on the device(s) targeted. A 
longer, descriptive message will be sent to email (duty & home/personal), desktop popup, 
and mobile application and a condensed message will be sent via text message.  (T-1). 
 
 
42 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
8.12.  Distribution Lists.  Using distribution lists (static and dynamic) supports multiple ways to 
exclude an individual or a group of individuals from receiving alerts. Alerts should not be sent to 
known deployed personnel. Utilizing the self service module during deployment out-processing 
will allow the individual to exempt themselves from scenarios. Command Posts must work 
closely with end users and organizations to ensure scenarios are properly targeted. 
8.13.  Authorized Uses.  Table 8.1 is a list of how EMNS will be used (T-1).  Not all options 
checked are mandatory for each example, however units cannot add unmarked sections for 
scenarios (T-1):

Note 1: ALERTS not appropriate for base wide transmission will target selected individuals, 
with a need to act upon the information, as identified in a supporting OPLAN, Quick 
Reaction Checklist, or other source reference document.  As an example if the Maintenance 
Operations Center, Base Defense Operations Center, Tower, Fitness Center, Flying 
Squadron, and Radar Approach Control are required (by Quick Reaction Checklist, OPLAN, 
or other source document) to receive notifications for wind gusts in excess of 30 knots, then 
the EMNS notification is restricted to Maintenance Operations Center, Base Defense 
Operations Center, Tower, Fitness Center, Flying Squadron and Radar Approach Control.  
(T-1). 
Note 2: Each member with an EMNS account can share the application with up to ten 
people, which are predominantly family members.

AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
8.14.  End User Database Integrity.  The self-service module is available for individuals to 
initially input and keep their own contact information current. During the initial phases of 
implementation or until the installation is confident of the data, per wing commander, the 
installation Command Posts will send out mass scenarios asking personnel to check their contact 
information and update accordingly (T-3). Once data integrity is assured, mass scenarios can be 
done on a quarterly basis.  Note: Scenarios targeting specific individuals is also an option. 
8.14.1.  Emergency Mass Notification System can target existing distribution lists built by 
administrators. 
8.14.2.  It is mandatory for all military (RegAF, RegSF, AFRC, and ANG), civilians 
personnel (bargaining/non-bargaining), and contact support personnel whose normal place of 
duty is on a DoD installation or within a DoD facility to provide an after-hours contact 
number or personal email.  (T-0).  Foreign Nationals may participate and may remove 
themselves from the Emergency Mass Notification System at any time. 
8.14.2.1.  Alternate procedures will be created by the command post to include members 
that are geographically separated and are not connected to the AFNet requiring manual 
input.  (T-1).  Units connected to AFNet but geographically separated less than 150 miles 
are required to participate in the EMNS program with their servicing command post.  (T-
1). 
8.14.2.2.  Command Post will work with a primary POC (functionally or geographically) 
who will provide a consolidated file for import into the system (T-1). 
8.14.3.  Bases/units must add a step to out-processing checklists for civilian and military 
members to remove people no longer assigned to the installation.  (T-1).  In an effort to 
minimize recording personal information in the system indefinitely, bases and MAJCOMs 
will institute automatic deletion protocols already installed in the EMNS for a user inactive 
more than 90 days, unless the member utilizes the leave or deployed option.  (T-1). 
8.14.4.  Personnel with government cellphones will register and activate the EMNS mobile 
application.  (T-1). 
8.14.5.  All Squadrons and Group/Wing Staffs will appoint, in writing, EMNS End User 
Managers and alternates, preferably UCC personnel.  Provide all appointments letters to the 
command post to ensure End User Managers are properly trained and assigned system 
privileges. 
8.15.  Active Shooter / Emergency Incident Mass Notification Procedures. 
8.15.1.  All Command Centers and Installation Command Posts will actively monitor the 
designated secure synchronous reporting room and immediately implement Active 
Shooter/Emergency Incident procedures, if their units are in the affected area.  (T-1).  
Emergency Incidents are defined as “stabbings, use of vehicles as weapons, terrorist threats, 
riots, etc.” 
8.15.2.  Immediate notification of Active Shooter incidents take precedence over all actions, 
with the exception of nuclear events or Real World Emergency Actions Messages, ensuring 
emergency mass notification procedures are implemented throughout the service to personnel 
in the affected area (T-1). 
AFMAN10-206  18 JUNE 2018 
45 
8.15.2.1.  A situation is considered an “Active Shooter/Emergency Incident” once 
confirmed by law enforcement, military or civilian individual through a 911-dispatch, or 
Homeland Security. 
8.15.2.2.  All command posts and Command Centers with an “Active Shooter or 
Emergency Incident situation” are authorized and directed to immediately post any 
“Active Shooter situation” regardless of location into the Air Force Service Watch Cell 
secure chat room if it is not already posted.  Do not post exercise information in the 
secure chat room.  This will assist in ensuring emergency notifications reach affected 
members assigned within the area of the incident as quickly as possible.  All Command 
Post Command and Control Operations Controllers should monitor news channels to stay 
up on critical events. 
8.15.3.  The following procedures are for Command Posts during a confirmed Active Shooter 
Incident: 
8.15.3.1.  Installation Command Posts within 100 miles of an event will activate the
