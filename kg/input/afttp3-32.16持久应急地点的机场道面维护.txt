Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background. Airfield pavement repairs lasting several years are routinely 
achieved at main operating bases. Conversely, repairs at contingency locations 
using procedures outlined in UFCs have failed sooner than would normally be 
anticipated. Specifically, repairs in apron areas have achieved life spans in 
excess of 12 months, but often last less than eight months on runways and 
primary taxiways.  
1.1.1. Many repairs at contingency locations involve large, non-uniformly 
shaped repairs loaded shortly (within a few hours) after placement. While many 
problems can be traced to inadequate preparation of the repair, some problems 
arise from curing techniques, material selection, and early loading. High 
operational tempo at these locations require the use of extremely rapid-setting 
materials and early loading of repairs which tend to create additional stress in 
the repair not present at main operating bases using ordinary Portland cement 
mixes. 
1.1.2. An investigation of premature repair failures was initiated to determine 
their cause and to develop corrective actions to achieve enduring repairs in 
contingency locations. This publication includes the tactics, techniques and 
procedures (TTPs) resulting from that investigation.  
1.2. Scope. This handbook contains information on current practices for the 
repair of airfield pavements at contingency locations. It contains information on 
the UTC 4FWSP, Sustainment Pavement Repair (SuPR) Kit, including its 
intended purpose, kit contents, and setup procedures. It provides repair guidance 
for rigid pavements, flexible pavements, and cement-stabilized soil surfaces. 
Lastly, chemical dust control for airfields is discussed.

Chapter 2 
Sustainment Pavement Repair (SuPR) Kit 
2.1. Introduction. The SuPR Kit (Unit Type Code [UTC] 4FWSP) provides 
quality airfield sustainment capabilities during contingency operations.  
2.1.1. The SuPR Kit, when combined with trained engineers, provides 
commanders with the capability to rapidly produce long lasting, durable airfield 
pavement repairs. In most cases the airfield pavement may be opened to aircraft 
traffic in less than two hours after completion of repairs. The kit contains 
equipment and materials to rapidly remove damaged pavement without 
disrupting the substrate. It also contains specialized equipment to repair 
pavement in the vicinity of aircraft arresting systems to eliminate aircraft tail-
hook skip. The kit contains rapidly setting repair materials that attain required 
strength within 90 minutes and are less sensitive to field conditions than most 
other products. Such expedient repairs are virtually impossible to achieve 
without the use of the equipment and materials in this specialized kit. 
2.1.2. Airfield pavement at contingency locations may need significant repairs 
before receiving mission aircraft, beddown forces, or materiel. In this instance, 
either a RED HORSE (RH) advanced echelon repair team or a RH small 
horizontal construction team, depending upon airbase accessibility, deploys with 
their appropriate equipment UTCs, alongside contingency response forces, in an 
“open the airbase” scenario. They perform a minimum number of expedient 
airfield surface repairs to establish a minimum airfield operating surface 
(MAOS) for cargo aircraft. 
2.1.3. Aircraft then deliver equipment, personnel and materials necessary for 
Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (Prime BEEF), or RH engineers, to 
establish the airbase. In this phase, engineers improve the previous expedient 
repairs made by RH and extend the MAOS to achieve initial operating capability 
(IOC) of assigned mission aircraft. Subsequently, airfield sustainment 
capabilities must exist until Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) 
vehicles, equipment and materials arrive and a supply chain established. The 
SuPR Kit provides this interim maintenance capability. 
2.1.4. The pavement may only require minor repairs such as spall, joint and 
crack repairs before mission aircraft may arrive. Typically, Prime BEEF 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017          
         9 
personnel (RH may be tasked) deploy with the SuPR Kit to make the necessary 
minor repairs before cargo aircraft bring in BEAR vehicles and equipment. 
2.1.5. The SuPR kit may be augmented with other Airfield Damage Repair 
(ADR) kits to enhance its effectiveness and reduce lifecycle logistics associated 
with ADR, and in particular sustainment repair capabilities. These augmentation 
kits should be tailored to local pavement types, distresses, and materials at the 
airfield. 
2.1.6. When full allotment of BEAR vehicles and equipment arrive, Prime 
BEEF forces achieve full operational capability (FOC) of the airfield and 
transition into operate- and sustain-the-airbase missions. The SuPR kit remains 
in place until replacement vehicles, equipment, and materials essential to timely 
quality repair of airfield pavements has been received or the mission ends. 
2.1.7. In addition, engineers may deploy to forward operating locations (FOLs) 
to perform minor airfield repairs where no engineer capability exists. The 
modular and scalable SuPR kit is ideally suited to provide this capability. 
2.2. Description. This kit is a specialized equipment-and-materials-only UTC 
that provides Prime BEEF and RH teams the capability to sustain airfield 
pavements at contingency locations. The capability offers durable asphalt and 
concrete pavement maintenance and repairs (typically spall, joint/crack, small 
patch or single slab repairs). The Air Force Civil Engineer Center 
(AFCEC)/CXX is the Pilot Unit for this UTC. See the Mission Capability 
(MISCAP) Statement in Attachment 2. 
2.2.1. The kit consists of five (5) 20-ft long by 8-ft wide by 8-ft tall freight 
containers with multi-use equipment deployable via air, land or sea. The kit 
includes two vehicles (compact track loader [CTL] and compact vibratory roller) 
that require diesel fuel and periodic maintenance. Major equipment and vehicles 
provided in the kit are: 
•
CTL with the following attachments (atchs): cold planer, concrete
breaker, drum compactor, forks, multi-purpose bucket, rotary broom,
turbine heated asphalt mixer
•
vibratory compact roller, self-propelled, dual drum, 3-ton

2.2.2. There are three equipment containers (#1, #2, and #3) that open from each 
end and two repair material containers (#4 & #5) that have doors on all four 
sides. Containers are labeled in top left corner on both long ends (Figure 2.1). 
See Attachment 3 for container inventories and diagrams (as kit items are 
discussed in this document the corresponding inventory item numbers will be 
included for clarity from this point forward). Containers have been certified air 
transportable on C-130s, C-17s, and C-5s. Individual empty and gross container 
weights are listed in Table 2.1.

2.3.1. Many contingency locations have limited space for container setup; site 
them according to available space. Determine available square footage and 
choose an example in paragraph 2.3.2 to fit available space and desired layout. 
12 
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
2.3.2. Place containers on improved or semi-improved surfaces capable of 
supporting weight of containers (i.e., up to 29k lbs). The layout area should be in 
a location with adequate drainage and is not prone to standing water or flooding. 
It is recommended a 20-foot clear zone, for material handling equipment, be 
available on both ends of equipment containers (1, 2, & 3) and a 20-foot clear 
zone be available on both ends and both sides of material containers (4 & 5), as 
all four sides open. Figures 2.2 thru 2.6 provide layout configuration examples 
for the SuPR Kit; available space may dictate container layout configuration. 
Note: Six 10’ x 20’ tarps located in container 4 (item #3, Figure A3.18) may be 
temporarily used to provide covered storage areas until more durable 
tarps/covers can be obtained. Recommend a locally acquired pole (e.g., 
camouflage netting pole with spreader) at least 9-foot tall be placed in the center 
of the tarps to shed rain. 
2.3.2.1. Figure 2.2 demonstrates a 7,500 sq. ft. layout area. Tarps may be 
stretched between containers 1 and 2 and between containers 2 and 3 to provide 
two 11-ft by 20-ft covered storage and work areas. 
Figure 2.2. Container Layout Example 1 (7,500 sq. ft.). 
2.3.2.1.1. Required setup space may be reduced by siting containers near roads 
or parking lots. The road and parking lot may temporarily provide needed 
clearance around containers for loading/unloading. As Figure 2.3 demonstrates, 
total space required for container setup is reduced from 7,500 sq. ft. in Figure 
2.2 to 4,796 sq. ft. by utilizing adjacent roads for loading/unloading clearance. 
         13 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017         
Figure 2.3. Siting Containers near Roads or Parking Lots (4,796 sq. ft.). 
2.3.2.1.2. The footprint may be reduced even further (3,564 sq. ft.) if identical 
containers 4 and 5 are double-stacked. If, or when, the bottom container’s 
supplies run low, it may be switched out with the top container for easy access. 
2.3.2.1.3. Figure 2.4 demonstrates a 5,934 sq. ft. layout. Utilizing the concept 
described in paragraph 2.3.2.1.1 may reduce this layout to 3,380 sq. ft. If 
existing covered storage is not available for the equipment removed from the 
containers, a tarp may be attached to the outboard sides of containers 1 and/or 3 
and supported on the other end with locally obtained poles/posts. 
2.3.2.1.4. Layout configuration in Figure 2.5 demonstrates stacking containers 4 
and 5, which provides a layout footprint of 4,760 sq. ft. Footprint may be further 
reduced utilizing the concept in paragraph 2.3.2.1.1 to 3,536 sq. ft. Covered 
storage may be constructed by attaching tarps on the outboard sides of 
containers 1 thru 3 and support the other ends with locally obtained poles/posts.

         15 
2.3.2.1.5. The layout configuration in Figure 2.6 demonstrates how containers 4 
and 5 may be placed on each end of a straight-line to keep the footprint to a 
minimum (6,000 sq. ft.). Access is provided to all repair materials by retrieving 
items from opposite sides of material containers. As supplies are depleted, 
containers 4 and 5 may be swapped to opposite ends of the straight line 
configuration to provide access to the other half of the containers. If covered 
storage space is required, additional space may be provided between containers 
1, 2, and 3. Again, utilizing the concept in paragraph 2.3.2.1.1 may reduce the 
layout footprint to 3,200 sq. ft. 
Figure 2.6. Container Layout Example 4 (6,000 sq. ft.). 
2.4. Container Lifting Procedures. When a rough terrain container handler 
(RTCH) is unavailable, fully loaded containers will be lifted by crane. Operators 
of Air Force special purpose vehicle/truck cranes shall be licensed in accordance 
with AFI 32-301, Vehicle Operations. Follow crane safety guidelines in AFI 91-
203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction. The crane 
operator will consult crane’s load chart to ensure the load with rigging hardware 
does not exceed crane capabilities or safe working load. Note: Mission planner 
should determine if a crane or RTCH will be available at the unloading site 
when the SuPR kit arrives. If unavailable, the planner should make 
arrangements to have container handling assets available, whether organic or 
rental, with appropriate lifting capacity. At austere locations with only forklift 
capability, container items must be unloaded until at, or below, the capacity of 
the forklift before lifting.

2.4.1. A placard illustrating the configuration of the Spreader Bar Lifting Kit 
(container #1, item 23) is placed on the outside of each container (Figure 2.7). 
Remove spreader bar, turnbuckles and wire rope slings from container #1 (the 
container is marked on the end where the spreader bar lifting kit is located). The 
slings and turnbuckles are located in the CTL bucket attachment (container #1, 
item 21) and the spreader bar is located on the lower right wall next to the 
broom attachment (Figure 2.8).

2.4.2. Rig slings and spreader bar as illustrated in Figure 2.9. Shackles attach 
slings to spreader bar (Figure 2.10). Rotating Lift Lugs (Figure 2.11) connect 
turnbuckles to the container bottom, side corner fitting apertures (Figure 2.11 
shows slings connected to rotating lift lugs before turnbuckles were added to the 
kit). Rotating Lift Lugs with the Pre-Lift Safety Lock feature prevents unwanted 
fallout while Lugs are NOT under load. Insert the “toe” and twist the cross pin 
90-degrees to lock and prepare to lift. Connect the lower end of slings to the 
upper end of turnbuckles. It is also recommended that lumber (typically 2” x 4” 
x 10’) be placed between the sling and container, when available, as a cushion to 
prevent potential damage to the slings or container when lifted. Note: Ensure 
contents are secured before lifting containers. 
Figure 2.9. Container Lifting Configuration. 
Note: Adjust turnbuckles to level containers when balance is not centered. 
Connect turnbuckles between lifting lugs and slings.

2.6.1.1. Containers are prewired with four lights, one in each corner, a light 
switch on each end, and one convenience outlet next to a breaker panel (Figure 
2.16). Power is provided by plugging a 25-foot twist lock extension cord (Basket 
H in container #2, item 29) to the receptacle on the side of equipment containers 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017         
         21 
(Figure 2.17), or on an end door of material containers, and plugging opposite 
end into a power source. Four extension cords are provided that may be 
connected together to extend the reach of the cords. When a commercial or 
BEAR electrical source is not available, the two 6-kW generators (Figure 2.18) 
in containers 2 (item 58) and 3 (item 56) may be used as a power source for the 
containers. The generators have only one 30 amp/120 volt receptacle; therefore, 
if more than one container requires power simultaneously, both generators will 
be required. Move extension cords between the containers as needed.

2.6.1.2. Ground the generator prior to connecting power to a container (Figure 
2.19). A ground rod kit (ground rod, driver, connector, and ground wire) is 
located with each generator (container #2, items 60-63; and container #3, items 
58-61). A ground rod driver is provided in container #3 (item 35). An electrician 
should test the grounding system to ensure earth grounding resistance is less 
than 25 ohms and all containers are bonded to the ground source with less than 
one ohm of resistance.

2.6.2. Remove the box containing operations and parts manuals from the cab of 
the CTL in container 1 and place in a convenient location protected from the 
weather. There are two binders containing hard copies, and a computer disk with 
electronic copies. 
Note: Store all straps, chains and binders in their original container so they are 
readily available for repacking equipment and vehicles. 
Note: Kit is delivered with forklift attachment installed on the CTL. Use caution 
when backing the CTL out of the container to prevent damage to other items. 
2.6.3. Fuel CTL (item 12) and back it out of container 1 (Figure 2.21). Jumper 
cables are provided in container 2, wire basket G (item 29) if battery is dead.

2.7. Unique Items. While the majority of equipment and tools in this kit are 
common shop items used routinely during peacetime operations, there are a few 
unique items not commonly used by Prime BEEF members. The following sub-
paragraphs describe these unique items. 
2.7.1. Vibratory Drum Compactor, Work Tool Attachment (container 1, 
item 17). Experience has shown that this roller attachment (Figure 2.37) 
performs best when compacting crushed stone at lifts no higher than 3-inches. 
Figure 2.37. Vibratory Drum Compactor, Work Tool Attachment. 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017         
         31 
2.7.2. Asphalt Mixer/Burner. The asphalt mixer/burner attachment (item 49) 
stored in container 2 (Figure 2.38) is new equipment the typical engineer has no 
experience operating; therefore, extreme caution should be taken when heating 
and placing materials. The attachment heats 400 lbs of mix to 340° Fahrenheit in 
just eight minutes. Note: The Operator’s Manual was not available when kits 
were shipped, but may now be accessed and downloaded from the “08. ADR” 
folder located on the AFCEC Expeditionary Engineering SharePoint at 
https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/21340/default.aspx. 
Figure 2.38. Asphalt Mixer/Burner. 
2.7.2.1. Before using the attachment, inspect for warped drum, cracked drum 
welds, leaking fuel, damaged or frayed control wiring, and any other obvious 
discrepancies are corrected before operating. 
2.7.2.2. Ensure any spilled fuel is wiped up before starting the heater. 
2.7.2.3. There is a remote on/off switch with the attachment for safety purposes. 
After attaching to the CTL, run the heater on/off switch and wire through the 
CTL door opening (Figure 2.39) so it is accessible to the CTL operator, but 
does not interfere with entering or exiting the cab, or operation of the CTL. The 
weather stripping around the door provides cushioning and will not damage the 
wire when the door is closed.  
2.7.2.4. Always fuel, or refuel, the heater when it is detached from the CTL. 
2.7.2.5. Always have a spotter when heater is in use. 
2.7.2.6. Pivot the burner out of the way and lock it with the set-pin when loading 
and unloading the drum.

Figure 2.39. Asphalt Heater Remote Switch. 
2.7.2.7. Ensure the drum is rotating before igniting the heater to prevent drum 
warpage. 
2.7.2.8. If the heater malfunctions for any reason, the operator may press the red 
EMERGENCY STOP button (Figure 2.40) on the side of the drum or the CTL 
operator may turn the heater off with the remote switch inside the CTL cab. 
Figure 2.40. Asphalt Heater Red Emergency Stop Button. 
2.7.2.9. To shutdown, empty mixer of all material, turn off both heater switches, 
turn off mixer switch, and disconnect electrical connections between the burner 
and CTL. Let drum cool before placing in storage.

2.7.3. Hand-Held Concrete Chain Saw. The hand-held concrete chain saws 
(item 15) stored in container #3 (Figure 2.41) is not typically used by 
Pavements and Construction Equipment Operators. The purpose of the chain 
saws is to square corners of the repairs, if necessary, after the repairs are sawed 
and excavated. A few operating and safety procedures are listed below. 
Figure 2.41. Hand-held Concrete Chain Saw. 
2.7.3.1. Only operate the chain saw as described by the manufacturer’s manual. 
Follow all safety warnings and cautions in the manual. 
2.7.3.2. Do not operate chain saw when fatigued. 
2.7.3.3. Use safety footwear, snug-fitting clothing, protective gloves; eye, 
hearing and head protection devices; respiratory protection; and leggings when 
operating chain saws. Leggings are not included in the SuPR Kit, but are 
available in the chainsaw safety kit in UTC 4F9ET, Basic Engineering 
Beddown/Sustainment Equipment Set.  
2.7.3.4. Attach the saw to a water source with pressure of not less than 20 
pounds per square inch (psi). 
2.7.3.5. For first time use, follow break-in procedures in the manufacturer’s 
manual to prevent piston seizure. 
2.7.3.6. Guard against kickback by holding the chain saw firmly with both hands 
and cut at high engine speeds...do not overreach. 
2.7.3.7. Proper chain tension, especially for first cut, is extremely important. 
Over-tensioning of bar and chain, especially at high altitude, could result in 
severe loss of power output making initial cutting experience unsatisfactory. 
34 
      AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
2.7.3.8. Clean chain saw and follow maintenance guidelines after each use as 
described in the manufacturer’s manual. 
2.7.4. Skid Steer Mounted Cold Planer. The cold planer (Figure 2.42) tool 
attachment (container 2, item 25) may be used to rapidly remove unsound 
material and prepare the area for placing the repair material. See Chapter 3 for 
guidance on repairing spalls with extremely rapid-setting repair materials. 
Figure 2.42. Cold Planer Tool Attachment. 
2.7.5. Scarifier (planer). The scarifier (Figure 2.43) is ideal to level repairs 
with the surrounding surface to bring the repairs within smoothness criteria. It is 
especially useful to make repairs flush within 200 feet of an aircraft arresting 
system. It is also ideal for trip hazard repair, concrete and coatings removal, 
creating non-slip surfaces, and paint line and marking removal. The scarifier is 
located within container 2 (item 30).

2.8. Repacking Instructions. Reconfigure the containers in reverse order of 
procedures in paragraph 2.6. Each container has a packing scheme placard 
(Figure 2.44) on the inside of the end doors. They illustrate component location 
and tie down procedures using straps or chains and binders. 
Figure 2.44. Example Packing Scheme Placard. 
2.8.1. There is also a bill of material placard (Figure 2.45) placed on the inside 
of the each container’s end door that lists the contents, part numbers, and their 
quantities. 
Figure 2.45. Example Bill of Material Placard (contents subject to change).

2.8.2. Each wire basket has an attached label listing its contents (Figure 2.46). 
Figure 2.46. Example Wire Basket Content List. 
2.8.3. When strapping the shovels, brooms, etc., lace the straps through the D-
rings between each set of brackets as shown in Figure 2.47 to securely hold the 
items in place during transport.

Chapter 3 
RIGID PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR 
3.1. Purpose. This chapter supplements guidance provided in Unified Facilities 
Criteria (UFC) 3-270-03, Concrete Crack and Partial Depth Spall Repair. It 
focuses on standard procedures for repairing spalls on Portland Cement 
Concrete (PCC) pavements and using extremely rapid-setting repair materials.  
3.2. Background. Due to inherent thermal effects of expansion and contraction, 
rigid pavements must be constructed with joints at specific intervals to mitigate 
potential damage to the overall slab. While these joints serve to minimize 
pavement damage, they also introduce areas of structural weakness along the 
exposed joint edge. Over time, repeated loading from aircraft and/or support 
vehicles can cause deterioration in the joint regions and result in deep spalling 
requiring immediate repair. Spalls may also be a direct result of inadequate joint 
maintenance, improper construction methods, alkali-silica reactions (ASR), or 
munition damage. Spalls may be full or partial-depth damage, generating foreign 
object debris (FOD) that can cause damage to aircraft tires. 
3.2.1. An investigation was initiated to identify applicable rapid-set materials, 
excavation equipment and procedures by which to construct a durable concrete 
spall repair within fifteen minutes or less. A cold planer is essential to meet this 
goal. However, when time permits, use of a concrete saw is effective. 
3.2.2. While many problems can be traced back to problems with the preparation 
of spalls (many repairs at contingency locations involved large non-uniformly 
shaped repairs that were loaded within a few hours after placement), there are 
some problems that arise from curing techniques, material selection, and early 
loading. The need to use extremely rapid-setting materials and the early loading 
of repairs tend to create additional stress in the repair that are not present at other 
base locations using ordinary Portland cement mixes. 
3.3. Scope. This chapter provides recommendations to extend spall repair life 
made on PCC pavements. While the goal is to achieve repairs typically lasting 
two years, these procedures do not guarantee achievement of this goal. Many 
external factors can affect the life span of the repair; however, following the 
recommendations within this chapter should consistently produce repairs that 
last longer than eight months. 
38 
      AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
3.3.1. Many recommendations found in this chapter are included in UFC 3-270- 
03; however, studies suggest some recommended procedures are not always 
fully implemented in the field due to insufficient time allowed on the airfield. 
This chapter includes recommendations to extend life of repairs when time on 
the airfield is limited. 
3.3.2. Paragraph 3.9 provides information on emergency repairs to rapidly 
reopen airfield pavement for airfield operations; however, these repairs are not 
expected to last more than a few passes or days. 
Note: This chapter does not cover full-depth repairs (repairs with a depth greater 
than one-half of the pavement thickness). 
Note: Expedient solutions to repair airfield surface damage associated with very 
short take-off and landing (VSTOL) aircraft was not available at the time of this 
publication. As expedient solutions become available, this publication will be 
updated to reference applicable publications containing this information.  
3.4. Application. This document applies specifically to the repair of PCC 
airfield surfaces in expeditionary environments. The intended users of these 
procedures are Air Force base civil engineers (BCE); RED HORSE squadrons, 
and Prime BEEF units responsible for emergency repair of airfield pavements in 
an expeditionary environment. 
3.5. Summary of Material Test Data. Based on tests performed by the Air 
Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in the summer of 2007, the following 
hydraulic cement-based products provided the best performance in several key 
tests: CTS Cement Rapid Set DOT Repair Mix; Pre-Blend’s Premium Patch; 
BASF’s Thoroc 10-60; SikaQuick 2500 Rapid Mortar; Dayton Superior’s HD-
50; and Euclid Chemical’s Versaspeed. These products provided the best 
performance (comparing cement products; polymers not compared) at early ages 
(1.5 to 4 hours) in several critical areas. These areas included bond, 
compressive, tensile and flexural strength, set times and strength consistency. 
3.6. General Guidance and Information. Most spalls result from debris that 
enters a joint or crack; therefore, it is important to clean and seal all cracks and 
joints. In general, it is important to identify and address the root cause of the 
pavement distress or the pavement and repair will continue to deteriorate.  
3.6.1. Long-Lasting Repairs. There are four areas requiring particular attention 
to ensure long-lasting repairs.  
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          39 
 
 
3.6.1.1. Maintain integrity of joints or cracks.  
• 
Repair material must not bridge a joint or crack. Pouring repair material 
across a joint or crack and then making a partial depth cut after the 
material has set to re-establish the joint or crack is insufficient. Tests 
using this approach have resulted in failures in as little as 24 hours. 
• 
When making repairs next to joints or cracks, the joint or crack must be 
sealed with a small pliable bead of caulk or other equivalent seal 
material to prevent the intrusion of grout or epoxy into the crack or 
joint. 
• 
When making repairs next to joints, repair material must not be placed 
so that it is in direct contact with the adjacent slab. A compressible 
spacer must be placed in the joint. Tests conducted on spall repairs 
where such a spacer was not included resulted in failures within 48 
hours. 
• 
Failure to properly clean out and seal the joint or crack will reduce the 
life expectancy of the repair. 
3.6.1.2. Ensure spall repairs rest on clean, sound material. 
3.6.1.3. Allow repair material enough time to cure. This is at least two hours 
when the ambient air temperature is above 75 degrees Fahrenheit (75°F [24°C]) 
when using materials listed in paragraph 3.9 (check manufacturer’s 
recommendations). Additional cure time will increase probability of the patch 
lasting up to and beyond two years. When temperature is below 75°F (24°C), 
amount of unloaded cure time (including mix time) will increase. The amount of 
increase in time varies with materials, core temperature of pavement, and curing 
technique. In general a compressive strength in excess of 2,700 psi is desired 
before loading. See manufacturer’s recommendations on minimum pavement 
temperatures for placing repairs. 
3.6.1.4. Maintain a proper geometry and size for repair. The largest repair 
dimension without a joint should be no more than 8 feet (2.4 meters). The 
Primary reason limiting the repair dimension is due to the rapid setting materials 
used in a contingency environment. In the event a repair dimension exceeds 8 
feet, the repair must be broken into two or more individual repairs. These repairs 
can be accomplished at the same time, but must be separated at the time the 
material is placed by using a form or insert (backer board), or it must be 
separated by saw cutting once the material has cured for at least two hours but 
 
40  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
not more than three days. For spall repairs located at the edge of a slab, the 
repair must be separated as previously stated with the exception, where the 
repair abuts an existing joint, the existing joint shall be restored as originally 
designed. 
3.6.2. Materials and Procedures. It is important to select the right repair 
materials and procedures to provide a long-lasting repair. 
3.6.2.1. Emergency Repairs. Emergency repairs are required when there is 
insufficient time to properly repair the airfield using conventional materials/ 
techniques. This type repair may fail in a short period of time, perhaps after only 
a few aircraft passes. Therefore, such repairs require constant monitoring and 
will require replacement with a permanent repair at the earliest opportunity. 
3.6.2.2. Full-depth Repairs. Full-depth repairs are required when the unsound 
portion of the pavement extends below the mid-height of the slab, or if the spall 
is located on a section of slab prone to movement due to a lack of base support 
or lack of dowels for load transfer across a joint or crack. Also, a full-depth 
repair should be considered when a spall occurs on a corner break. 
3.6.2.3. Partial-depth repairs. Partial-depth repairs are placed when repairing an 
area one-half the thickness of the slab or less, and the remainder of the slab on 
which the repair is placed is not prone to movement. When spalls are located on 
a crack in a slab, the crack should be treated as a joint. Furthermore, load 
transfer across the crack should be restored in accordance with Chapter 10 of 
UFC 3-270-04, Concrete Repair, or the life of the repair will be shortened. 
3.6.3. General Product Selection Considerations. 
3.6.3.1. Cure Time. Polymeric materials should be selected for spall repair 
when rapid curing is necessary; a typical requirement is the ability to support 
aircraft traffic in one hour or less. Manufacturer-recommended cure times range 
from ten minutes to eight hours for most polymeric repair materials. The testing 
protocol described herein should initially assume that manufacturer-
recommended cure times are accurate. Note that cure times are most often a 
function of environmental conditions, especially temperature, so cure times may 
vary from the laboratory to the field. 
3.6.3.2. Shelf Life. Some polymeric repair materials have a very limited shelf 
life, as reported by the manufacturer, so particular attention should be given to 
shelf life when selecting a material. Shelf life typically ranges from three 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          41 
 
 
months to two years, and depends on storage conditions such as temperature, 
humidity, and the integrity of packaging. 
3.6.3.3. Surface Preparation. Surface preparation of the damaged concrete 
should be practiced according to the repair material manufacturer. Common 
recommendations are removing loose debris by either sandblasting or high-
pressure water, followed by blowing with compressed air. Some repairs require 
saw-cutting to eliminate feathered edges. Many materials require the application 
of a primer to the concrete surface before applying the repair material. Some 
repair materials are designed to immediately follow the priming step, while 
some require that the primer coat be allowed to fully cure before repairing. 
3.6.3.4. Fillers. While some polymeric repair materials comprise particular 
aggregates or fillers that are supplied with the resin, others are designed to use 
local aggregates which must be acquired independently by the user. 
Manufacturers’ recommendations regarding aggregate selection and preparation 
should be followed. 
3.6.3.5. Safety. Safety hazards, such as fire/explosion hazards, toxicity, and 
reactivity, are associated with many polymeric repair materials. Suppliers, 
handlers, and users of any polymeric repair material should ensure an MSDS 
from the manufacturer always accompanies the material. Before use, users 
should review and follow the MSDS guidance for personal protective equipment 
and other safety precautions. 
3.6.4. Materials. The following materials have been tested and have performed 
well in several repair environments. The effectiveness of these materials can be 
increased by storing materials inside an air-conditioned space for at least 48 
hours before use and when any required mixing water is heated or cooled to 
72°F (22°C) before use. 
3.6.4.1. CTS Cement Rapid Set DOT Repair Mix (National Stock Number 
[NSN] 5610-01-564-7710, CAGE-CD #: 4NFR3), may be used if ambient air

3.6.5. General Guidance for Repair Material. 
3.6.5.1. Some materials used to patch spalls are very alkaline; therefore, care 
should be taken to ensure alkaline patch materials are not placed on pavements 
containing materials that are prone to ASR. Furthermore, aggregates used to 
extend patch mixes should be checked to ensure ASR- susceptible materials are 
not used. 
3.6.5.2. It is recommended that full containers be used when preparing a patch. 
Many extremely or very rapid-setting materials contain several chemicals that 
are a small portion of the mix but are extremely vital to the proper performance 
of the patch. 
3.6.5.3. It is recommended that more material than required be ready for use to 
ensure sufficient material is on hand. Owing to the precise nature of the 
chemistry used in many of these materials, some variability in mix performance 
can be expected in the field. 
3.6.5.4. Whenever possible, purchase materials in sealed buckets instead of 
bags, and store them in covered locations in a temperature-controlled space with 
low humidity. These steps will significantly increase the shelf life. 
3.6.5.5. The best performing spall repair materials have a low heat of hydration 
(i.e., they don’t get very hot while they are setting and curing), are 
dimensionally stable (i.e., do not shrink or dilate), obtain high bond strengths (in 
excess of 1200 psi in one day using American Standard Test Method (ASTM) 
C882, Standard Test Method for Bond Strength of Epoxy-Resin Systems Used 
with Concrete by Slab Shear), and have thermal coefficients similar to the 
existing concrete. Unfortunately, rapid-setting materials tend to create more heat 
during setting and curing and can experience a large amount of dilation and 
shrinkage over the first few months after placement. Extremely, or very, rapid- 
setting materials also tend to be more sensitive to contaminants present during 
the mixing and placing process. 
3.6.6. Equipment. The following equipment is recommended for repairing 
spalls:

3.7. Procedures.  
3.7.1. Remove Debris. Remove loose debris from damaged area by hand, 
broom, compressed air, and/or with a wet/dry vacuum. 
3.7.2. Mark Edges. Mark outer edge of the repair area using red spray paint as 
shown in Figure 3.1. 
3.7.2.1. The outer edge should be located 2 to 3 inches (50 to 76 millimeters) 
beyond the damaged area (area of scaling, cracking, or spalling). Use a metal 
 
50  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
rod to “sound” the area around visibly damaged area to determine extent of 
unsound material. In some instances a horizontal crack (delamination) extends 
beyond visible surface damage. 
Figure 3.1. Marking Repair Area. 
 
3.7.2.2. Repair area should be square or rectangular in shape (it may be 
pentagonal at a slab corner as shown in Figure 3.2). 
Figure 3.2. Pentagonal Repair at Slab Corner. 
 
3.7.2.3. When a repair spans a crack or joint, the repair must be considered as 
two repairs—one on each side of the crack or joint. 
3.7.2.4. Each dimension of the rectangle must each be greater than or equal to 24 
inches (60.96 centimeters) or the width of the cold planer drum, but less than 8 
feet (2.44 meters). 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          51 
 
 
3.7.2.5. Repairs greater than the width of the planing drum shall be planed in 
adjacent rows until the desired width is achieved. 
3.7.2.6. When using a saw Vs a cold planer the length and width of the rectangle 
must each be larger or equal to 6 inches (152 millimeters). 
3.7.2.7. The ratio of the longer dimension to the shorter dimension of repair is 
referred to as aspect ratio. 
3.7.2.7.1. The aspect ratio should be less than two. 
3.7.2.7.2. If the aspect ratio is larger than two, the repair must be broken into 
two or more individual repairs. These repairs can be accomplished at the same 
time, but must be separated at the time the material is placed by using a form or 
insert (backer board), or it must be separated by saw cutting once the material 
has cured for at least two hours but not more than three days. 
3.7.3. Cold Planer. Orient the cold planer to the repair so that the grinding drum 
is parallel with the longest edge of the repair. Place the cold planer directly 
above the repair area so that the grinding drum begins cutting at the repair edge 
furthest from the skid steer, Figure 3.3 (Note: The cold planer is designed to be 
pulled backward with the skid steer during normal operation, rather than pushed 
forward). Ensure bits/tips of planer are designed for use on concrete, Figure 3.4. 
Use of a jack hammer alone is not recommended. If a jack hammer must be 
used, hammer should be 30 pounds or smaller in size. Larger hammers may 
cause damage to underlying material as shown in Figure 3.5, which leads to 
reduced life expectancy of the repair. 
Figure 3.3. Planer Orientation.

3.7.3.1. Begin planer operation and slowly lower the grinding drum to pavement 
surface until teeth begin cutting repair area (Figure 3.6).

AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          53 
 
 
3.7.3.2. Operating depth of the planer should be set to 4.5 inches (11.43 
centimeters). 
3.7.3.3. Operate the hydraulic system of the loader at the high setting (26 gallons 
per minute at 3,335 psi). 
3.7.3.4. Continue to plane until maximum depth is achieved (Figure 3.7). 
Figure 3.7. Completed Cold Planer Excavation. 
 
3.7.3.5. Slowly grind away from initial cut until the entire marked area has been 
excavated to the required depth (Note: The cold planer drum leaves a radius in 
the excavation such that the bottom surface of the spall excavation is not parallel 
with the pavement surface). A hand-held or wheel-mounted concrete saw may 
be used to square the radius edges in the excavation and prepare the area for 
placing repair material.  
3.7.3.5.1. Cut radius edges with a concrete saw to extend at least two inches (50 
millimeters) below pavement surface or 0.5 inch (13 millimeters) below the 
bottom of the spall. Extend the saw cuts so as to form a vertical corner. Do not 
feather the repair on any side. 
3.7.3.5.2. Remove remaining material using a small jack hammer (30 pounds or 
less). 
3.7.3.5.3. A small hand pistol grip chisel may be used to clean up the corners 
and avoid extra spalling of the edges. Pre-cutting concrete ensures material 
beneath repair is not damaged. 
3.7.3.6. Wash the repair area with a high-pressure washer or use water and a 
scrub brush. When using a polymer, it is best to clean the surface without water 
by scrubbing the surface with a stiff brush while blowing compressed air over it, 
 
54  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
or sandblasting the repair area. Figure 3.7 shows a photograph of the cleaned 
excavation. 
3.7.4. Alternative Preparation Method. A hand-held or wheel-mounted 
concrete saw may be used to remove unsound material and prepare the area for 
placing repair material. 
3.7.4.1. Cut edges of the repair with a concrete saw to a minimum depth of 2 
inches (50 millimeters) or 0.5 inch (13 millimeters) below the bottom of the 
spall. Extend the cuts to form a vertical corner. Do not feather the repair on any 
side (Figure 3.8). 
Figure 3.8. Cutting Edges of Repair Area. 
 
3.7.4.2. Make additional cuts within the bounds of the repair edges using a 
concrete saw. Make longitudinal cuts and space 1 to 2.5 inches (25 to 64 
millimeters) apart (Figure 3.9). 
Figure 3.9. Longitudinal Interior Cuts. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          55 
 
 
3.7.4.3. Cuts should extend 2 inches (50 millimeters) below pavement surface or 
0.5 inch (13 millimeters) below bottom of the spall. 
3.7.4.4. Make sure cuts do not extend beyond edge of repair or across a joint or 
crack. 
3.7.4.5. Once longitudinal cuts are complete, one or two transverse cuts on each 
end should be made 1.5 inches (38 millimeters) from ends of repair (Figure 
3.10). Depth of cuts should match that of edge cuts. 
Figure 3.10. Transverse Interior Cuts. 
 
3.7.4.6. Remove remaining material using a small jack hammer (30 pounds or 
less). 
3.7.4.7. A small, hand pistol grip chisel may be used to clean up the corners and 
avoid extra spalling of the edges. Pre-cutting concrete ensures material beneath 
repair is not damaged. 
3.7.4.8. If necessary, bottom of repair may be sloped; however, the slope should 
be kept as minimal as possible and with no abrupt changes (Figure 3.11 and 
Figure 3.12). 
Figure 3.11. Repair with Abrupt Slope (NOT Recommended).

               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
 
Figure 3.12. Repair without Abrupt Slope (Recommended). 
 
3.7.4.9. Remove loose debris from repair area by hand, broom, compressed air, 
and/or with a wet/dry vacuum. Remove any loose material in joint or crack. 
Compressed air should be filtered to prevent oil and other contaminants from 
being blown onto the clean surface. 
3.7.4.10. If a dowel bar or any rebar is exposed, with more than one-fourth of 
bar circumference exposed for 3 inches (76 millimeters) or more of length, 
remove material 0.5 inch (13 millimeters) to either side and below dowel/rebar. 
This should be done with a concrete saw and a small pneumatic chisel, hammer 
drill, or jack hammer. Typical design standards place dowel bars at mid-height 
of a slab; however, they have been found in the top half of the slab at some 
contingency locations. If encountering a dowel at mid-height, a full-depth repair 
should be accomplished. 
3.7.4.11. Wash repair area with a high-pressure washer or use water and a scrub 
brush. When using a polymer, such as FlexPatch, it is best to clean the surface 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          57 
 
 
without water by scrubbing surface with a stiff brush while blowing compressed 
air over it, or sandblasting repair area. 
3.7.4.12. Remove any loose material or lodged debris from joint or crack. 
3.7.4.13. Place small bead of caulk over joint or crack. 
3.7.5. Pavement Temperature. If pavement temperature is above 90°F (32°C), 
pour ice or cool water onto repair area and, if possible, allow it to sit for two to 
five minutes, or flush cool water over repair area for two minutes (some 
materials require this at temperatures above 80 °F [27 °C]). 
3.7.5.1. Remove excess water with a wet/dry vacuum or compressed air. 
3.7.5.2. When using a polymer, such as Pave Patch, SikaQuick, or Futura, all 
moisture must be removed by blowing the surface with compressed air. 
3.7.5.3. For cement-based materials such as Pavemend, CTS Cement Rapid Set 
DOT Road Repair Mix or Dayton Superior HD-50, leave area SSD. 
3.7.6. Joints or Cracks. Place a section of backer board, or other soft insert 
material, over any joint or crack in repair area (Figure 3.13 and Figure 3.14). 
Figure 3.13. Compressible Insert Placed Before Placing Repair Material. 
 
Figure 3.14. Compressible Insert Placed within Partially Completed Repair.

               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
 
3.7.6.1. Thickness of the insert should be slightly wider (0.125 to 0.25 inch [3 to 
6 millimeters]) than the joint/crack width. It should be at least 0.75 inch (19 
millimeters) thick for expansion joints and at least 0.5 inch (13 millimeters) 
thick for all other joints and cracks. 
3.7.6.2. Insert must extend from top to bottom and from one side to the other of 
repair area. Any holes or gaps in insert must be filled or sealed. It may be 
necessary to tape several pieces of backer board together to meet repair 
geometry. 
3.7.7. Bonding Agent. Apply surface preparation/bonding agents to reduce 
amount of water absorbed by the surrounding material. 
3.7.7.1. Polymer materials such as Pave Patch do not require a special bonding 
agent. However, they may (as in the case of Pave Patch) require the user to 
apply some liquid portion of the product (i.e., prior to adding aggregate) to 
repair area surfaces with a brush or trowel (Figure 3.15). 
Figure 3.15. Applying Polymer Liquid to Repair Area Surfaces. 
 
3.7.7.2. Hydraulic cement materials such as Pavemend, CTS Cement Rapid Set 
DOT Road Repair Mix, and Dayton Superior HD-50, normally do not require a 
bonding agent if the repair area is in SSD condition when the repair material is 
placed. At high temperatures (above 90°F [32°C]), and/or where SSD conditions 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          59 
 
 
cannot be maintained before mixing and placing the repair material, a bonding 
agent such as Dayton Superior’s Ad Bond (J-40) (an acrylic latex material) 
should be applied to the surfaces of the repair area. 
3.7.8. Mixing Materials. Mix materials in accordance with manufacturers’ 
recommendations (Figure 3.16). 
Figure 3.16. Mixing Repair Material in Bucket with Mixing Paddles. 
 
3.7.8.1. Due to the rapid-setting nature of these materials, it is recommended the 
materials be mixed in 5-gal buckets using drills equipped with mixing paddles. 
3.7.8.2. For hydraulic cement materials, the bucket and mixing paddle should be 
wetted prior to mixing. If the materials are too stiff to pour, discard the batch 
and prepare a new batch adding 5% to 10% more water to the mix. 
Note: 0.05 gal [1.89 liters] equals 0.4 pint, 0.8 cup, 6.4 ounces, or 12.8 
tablespoons. 
3.7.8.3. For polymer materials, all containers, paddles, and trowels should be 
kept dry. These types of materials require special materials for cleanup (e.g., 
mineral spirits for Pave Patch). 
3.7.8.4. A temperature gun (thermometer) should be used to check water and 
material temperature before mixing, as well as material temperature during 
mixing. 
3.7.8.5. Mix times will increase at lower ambient air temperatures and will 
decrease in high temperatures. At temperatures above 95°F (35°C), some 
recommended materials have been known to flash set. 
 
60  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
3.7.8.6. Store mortar at approximately 72°F (22°C) for at least 48 hours before 
use. Combine with water poured at 72°F (22°C) to extend workability in hot 
weather and speed set time in cold weather. Alternatively, some materials 
recommend ice water for mixing in hot temperatures or 90°F (32°C) water for 
mixing 
in 
temperatures 
below 
40°F 
(4°C); 
consult 
manufacturer’s 
recommendations. 
3.7.8.7. Some polymers, such as Pave Patch, are very sensitive to moisture and 
require completely dry surfaces and aggregates (when used). 
3.7.8.8. Extreme care must be taken when using locally obtained aggregates to 
extend materials. In general, use of these aggregates is discouraged. Many repair 
materials are very alkaline and can prematurely fail when extended with ASR-
susceptible aggregates. Some repair materials cannot be extended with limestone 
aggregates (consult the manufacturer’s recommendations). However, the use of 
aggregates can improve dimensional stability (i.e., reduce shrinkage) and reduce 
thermal problems during setting and curing. Any aggregates used must be 
washed before use. Aggregates should be stored in a covered location. They 
should be dry for use in polymer repairs. Aggregates should be soaked and SSD 
for use in hydraulic cement repairs. Typically, it is best to use a well-graded 
aggregate from a crushed material; however, most manufacturers of extremely 
and very rapid-setting materials recommend use of a uniformly graded rounded 
aggregate (0.375-inch [10-millimeter] pea gravel) to ensure material can be 
placed quickly enough. Furthermore, the use of aggregates in these materials is 
used to control shrinkage and heat production, not necessarily for strength and 
cement reduction. 
3.7.8.9. Some materials are shipped with proprietary aggregates. 
3.7.8.10. If locally obtained aggregates must be used, ensure they meet all 
manufacturers’ specifications. Some materials will adversely react with certain 
aggregates such as limestone. 
3.7.8.11. Test a small batch of aggregate/material mix before use on the airfield. 
3.7.9. Material Placement. Pour/place material in repair (Figure 3.17) and 
ensure material does not enter any joint or crack. Pavemend 15.0 and 5.0 
materials are self-consolidating. Other recommended materials require some 
work to ensure a complete, compact, level repair is obtained. Rod or vibrate 
material briefly after placing in repair area, then level repair with a screed, float, 
or trowel. Clean mixing and placement equipment immediately after use. Water 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          61 
 
 
may be used for cleaning when using hydraulic cements; polymers require 
special materials for cleanup such as mineral spirits for Flexpatch. 
Figure 3.17. Filling Repair with Pavemend. 
 
3.7.10. Curing. Polymer repair materials do not require any special treatment 
for curing; however, in cold weather required cure times will increase. Use of a 
blanket will reduce cure times. 
3.7.10.1. Hydraulic cement materials such as CTS Cement DOT Rapid Set 
Repair Mix, Thoroc, Premium Patch, Dayton Superior HD-50, Versaspeed, and 
Pavemend require a moisture cure for one hour after the material has initially set 
and when windy or hot (over 80°F [27°C]), dry conditions prevail. It is 
recommended to take steps to reduce moisture loss during curing. 
3.7.10.2. Once the repair no longer has a surface sheen, place a wet burlap 
material over repair or mist the repair for one hour. 
3.7.10.3. Alternatively, apply a white-colored curing compound that meets 
ASTM 
C309, 
Standard 
Specification 
for 
Liquid 
Membrane-Forming 
Compounds for Curing Concrete, such as ChemMasters Safe-Cure 2000, once 
the repair no longer has a surface sheen. Apply at least two coats of the 
compound or apply until the surface appears completely white.  
3.7.10.4. When possible, remove the backer board/compressible spacer insert 
after repair has cured for at least two hours. 
3.7.10.5. Reseal joint with backer rod and joint sealant to ensure incompressible 
material and moisture cannot easily enter the joint or crack. 
3.8. Emergency Repair Procedures. When limited time on the airfield, non-
availability of materials or equipment, or operational requirements dictate spall 
 
62  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
repairs be completed in a manner other than described in paragraph 3.7, the 
following procedures may be used. 
3.8.1. Remove loose debris from damaged area by hand, broom, compressed air, 
and/or with a wet/dry vacuum. 
3.8.2. Brush surface vigorously with a stiff brush. Remove all dust /loose debris 
with a broom, compressed air, and/or with a wet/dry vacuum. 
3.8.3. If possible, place a section of backer board, or other soft insert material, 
over any joint or crack in the repair area. 
3.8.4. Mix and place patching material in prepared area until level with (± 0.5 
inch [13 millimeters]) of the surface. 
3.8.4.1. For temperatures above 90°F (32°C), use Pavemend 15. 
3.8.4.2. For temperatures between 40°F and 90°F (4°C to 32°C), use Pavemend 
5.0. 
3.8.4.3. Alternatively, an asphalt cold patch material such as Instant Road Repair 
may be used (Figure 3.18). 
Figure 3.18. Instant Road Repair Patch. 
 
3.8.4.4. Some polymers extremely sensitive (very reactive) to water, such as 
Concrete Welder, are least preferred materials; however, some of these repairs 
can be opened to traffic within a few minutes of placement. These materials do 
not work in presence of water. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          63 
 
 
3.8.5. At a minimum, monitor emergency repairs daily. Take steps to re-
accomplish such repairs in accordance with procedures in paragraph 3.7 as 
soon as possible. 
3.9. Special Considerations. 
3.9.1. If a spall extends along both a transverse joint and longitudinal joint 
meeting at a corner, the repair must be accomplished as two repairs: one along 
the transverse joint and one along the longitudinal joint (Figure 3.19). 
Figure 3.19. Two Repairs when Spall Meets at a Corner of a Slab. 
 
3.9.1.1. If they must be accomplished simultaneously (i.e., in one pour), a spacer 
must be placed or a 2-inch- (51-millimeter) deep cut must be sawed at the 
junction of the two repairs (preferably in the longitudinal direction). 
3.9.1.2. Saw cuts should be made after final set of the material, usually one to 
two hours after the pour. 
3.9.1.3. The cut or joint should be filled with a backer rod and joint sealant. 
3.9.2. Repair sections should be square, rectangular, or pentagonal (for corner 
spalls) in shape. Many repairs in the field have a complex geometry when seen 
in the plan view (Figure 3.20). When such repair geometries are necessary, the 
repair must either be accomplished in several phases/pours or crack control 
joints must be cut into the resulting repair to control the location and condition 
of cracks (Figure 3.21). All joints must be sealed with a sealant. Joints should 
be aligned in a longitudinal direction whenever possible. Saw cuts must be made 
no sooner than the final set, which usually occurs one to two hours, and no later 
than 12 hours, after the material is placed. Delays in making the saw cuts will 
reduce the life span of the repair.

               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
Figure 3.20. Large Repair with Complex Geometry. 
 
Figure 3.21. Red Lines Indicate Where Saw Cuts Should Have Been Made. 
 
3.9.3. The repair shall not exceed 8 feet (2.4 meters) in its longest dimension. 
When damaged areas require repairs with dimensions longer than 8 feet (2.4 
meters), the repair must either be accomplished in several phases/pours 
(producing cold joints) or crack control joints must be cut into the resulting 
repair to control the curling stresses. All sawed control joints must be made to 
the full depth of the repair. All joints must be sealed with a sealant or preformed 
elastomeric. Joints should be aligned in the longitudinal direction whenever 
possible. Saw cuts must be made no sooner than the final set, which usually 
occurs one to two hours, and no later than 24 hours, after the material is placed. 
Delays in making the saw cuts will reduce the lifespan of the repair. Controlling 
the size of the repair will reduce stresses on the bond interface and increase the 
lifespan of the repair. 
3.9.4. Weather conditions during preparation and placement of a repair may 
decrease life expectancy of the repair. Use the following steps to mitigate 
weather effects. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          65 
 
 
3.9.4.1. Wind. The biggest effect of wind—aside from blowing debris into the 
prepared spall—is increased evaporation. This can quickly dry the prepared 
repair surface adversely affecting the bond, and dry the placed repair material 
surface leading to shrinkage cracks. 
Note: Windy conditions do not affect the performance of polymer materials. 
3.9.4.1.1. Use a bonding agent similar to Dayton Superior’s Ad Bond (J-40) 
when an SSD condition on the repair surface cannot be maintained. 
Alternatively, a grout scrub can also be used as a bonding agent, but it must be 
applied very rapidly, followed by material placement before the grout sets or 
dries. 
3.9.4.1.2. Moist cure hydraulic cement materials for one hour after the material 
has no sheen. This can be done by misting the surface or by placing a wet burlap 
cloth over the repair. Alternatively, a white curing compound, similar to 
ChemMasters Safe-Cure 2000, can be applied. Apply the curing compound until 
the entire repair surface appears completely white (at least two coats). 
3.9.4.2. Rain. Rain can affect the bond by ponding water in the repair area. It 
can also adversely affect the material during mixing, placement, and curing by 
affecting the water/cement ratio or by chemically reacting with the polymers. 
Use a portable rain fly, similar to an easy-up, to cover the repair area and/or use 
a box van for mixing the materials. Some materials, such as Concrete Welder, 
will foam up when exposed to the slightest amount of water and are not 
recommended for use when raining. 
3.9.4.3. Heat. Heat may affect the bond developed between the repair materials 
and the existing slab. It can cause flash setting of the repair materials and 
shrinkage cracking. 
3.9.4.3.1. Cool the pavement by placing ice water over the area, by running cold 
water over the repair area, and/or by blowing compressed air on the repair area. 
3.9.4.3.2. If SSD conditions cannot be maintained use a bonding agent with 
hydraulic cement materials (not for a polymer material). 
3.9.4.3.3. Precondition the materials (cement and water) and tools by storing 
them in a cool place, 72°F (22°C) or cooler, for at least 48 hours before use. 
When transported to a job site, the materials should be kept in a cooled vehicle 
cab or in a Styrofoam cooler or insulated box. 
 
66  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
3.9.4.3.4. Use materials designed for high temperatures, such as Thoroc 10- 60, 
Thoroc 10-61, Versaspeed LS, Pavemend 15 or FlexPatch. Some manufacturers 
sell admixtures that can be combined with their repair products to increase the 
effective temperature range. CTS offers admixtures that can be used with their 
DOT repair mix. 
3.9.4.3.5. Moist cure hydraulic cement materials (not polymer materials such as 
FlexPatch) for one hour after the material has set (i.e., no sheen). This can be 
done by misting the surface or by placing a wet burlap cloth over the repair. 
Alternatively, a white curing compound, similar to ChemMasters Safe-Cure 
2000, can be applied. Apply the curing compound until the entire repair surface 
appears completely white (at least two coats). 
3.9.4.4. Cold. Cold temperatures can affect the bond between repair materials 
and the existing slab. It can cause the material reactions to halt, resulting in the 
material failing to set or cure. 
3.9.4.4.1. Heat the pavement by running hot water or steam over the pavement 
for several minutes (until the surface is warm to the touch). Alternatively, 
aerospace ground equipment heaters can be used. 
3.9.4.4.2. Precondition the materials (cement and water) and tools by storing 
them in a warm place, 72°F (22°C) or warmer (Dayton Superior and Premium 
Patch recommend 90°F [32°C] for HD-50), for at least 48 hours before use. 
When transported to a job site, the materials should be kept in a warm vehicle 
cab or in a Styrofoam cooler or insulated box. 
3.9.4.4.3. Use materials designed for low temperatures, such as Dayton Superior 
HD-50, Premium Patch, Versaspeed, Pavemend TR, or Pavemend 5.0. 
Pavemend 5.0 may be used as a base layer which may then be topped with 
Pavemend 15 as a surface coat. 
3.9.4.4.4. Cover the repair with an insulating blanket or plastic for one to two 
hours after placement. 
3.10. Phasing Repairs. If time required to complete the repair in accordance 
with this chapter (i.e., a minimum of three hours) is longer than can/will be 
provided at one time on the airfield, the repair can be accomplished in phases 
(steps). Phasing the repair will shift the critical resource from time on the 
airfield to the availability of personnel, equipment, and materials. Several 
phased repair options are presented below.

3.10.1. Areas of distressed concrete are identified but major spalls do not yet 
exist, or spalls exist in areas not subject to direct tire loads. 
Step 1: Saw cut borders of the spall area and remove loose debris from the 
repair. It may be possible to make additional cuts within these borders, 
spaced 2 inches (51 millimeters) apart in the longitudinal direction 
(direction of traffic), to assist with the removal of material within the 
borders. Refrain from this step if concrete becomes loose as a result of this 
additional saw cutting.  
Step 2: Remove (jack hammer) the unsound concrete. 
Step 3: Place a compressible joint spacer insert. 
Step 4: Fill the spall with repair material. 
Step 5: If possible, remove the joint spacer and reseal the joint. If joint 
spacer cannot be removed, use router to remove top 2-inches of spacer and 
reseal the joint. 
3.10.2. Spall must be immediately filled. Additional areas around the spall may 
be unsound, but are not spalled. 
Step 1: Remove loose debris from the spall. Caulk or otherwise protect the 
joint from repair material entering the joint or crack. If possible, place a 
compressible joint spacer insert over any joint. Fill the spall. 
Note: This type of spall repair will rapidly deteriorate and the next phases 
must remove and replace this original repair. 
Step 2: Saw cut the borders of the spall area and clean loose debris. 
Step 3: It may be possible to make additional cuts within these borders, 
spaced 2 inches (51 millimeters) apart in the longitudinal direction 
(direction of traffic), to assist with the removal of material within the 
borders. This can be done in the repair material also, but is difficult to do in 
some polymer repairs. Refrain from this step if the concrete becomes loose 
as a result of this additional saw cutting. This may be done in conjunction 
with Step 1. 
Step 4: Remove (jack hammer) the unsound concrete, including the original 
repair, clean loose debris (if possible, place a compressible joint spacer 
insert over any joints) and fill the spall.

               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
Step 5: If possible, remove the joint spacer and reseal the joint. If joint 
spacer cannot be removed, use router to remove top 2-inches of spacer and 
reseal the joint. 
3.10.3. Spall must be filled, but there is not enough time to perform all necessary 
saw cuts in the initial phase/step. 
Step 1: Remove (jack hammer) the unsound concrete directly below the 
spall and a few inches on all sides. Remove all debris (if possible, place a 
compressible joint spacer insert) and fill the spall. This may lead to 
feathered edges and may leave some unsound material remaining outside of 
the original spall area—this will be addressed in later steps. 
Step 2: Cut borders of entire spall area and clean loose debris. 
Step 3: Make additional cuts within these borders, spaced 2 inches (51 
millimeters) apart in the longitudinal direction, to assist with the removal of 
material within the borders. This may be done in conjunction with Step 2. 
Step 4: Saw cut the spall material 1 to 2 inches (25 to 51 millimeters) 
within the feathered edge on each side of the spall. Remove (jack hammer) 
the unsound concrete (if possible, place a compressible joint spacer insert) 
and fill the spall. 
Note: Cut new spall repair in the longitudinal direction along one or 
two sides of the repair. This will prevent diagonal cracks from forming 
in the repair. Alternatively, Step 4 may be accomplished in three 
separate steps, ensuring each time that a rectangular section is poured 
so as to minimize stress intensities at interior corners and preclude 
cracking. 
Step 5: If possible, remove the joint spacer and reseal the joint. If joint 
spacer cannot be removed, use router to remove top 2-inches of spacer and 
reseal the joint.

FLEXIBLE PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR 
 
4.1. Purpose. The purpose of maintenance and repair (M&R) of asphalt 
pavements is to extend the useful life of the pavement, maintain a smooth 
surface, and prevent water from entering the underlying soil. Limited manpower 
and resources have increased the importance of M&R to the life of a pavement. 
To keep a pavement in the best possible condition, it is important to use an 
effective pavement management and inspection system. As pavements are 
repaired, it is extremely important to analyze and repair the “true cause” of the 
pavement distress and not just repair the distress. The intended function of 
pavements depends on proper and timely M&R. 
4.2. Scope. Use UFC 3-260-03, Airfield Pavement Evaluation, UFC 3-270-01, 
Asphalt Maintenance and Repair, and UFC 3-270-02, Asphalt Crack Repair, for 
guidance on pavement evaluation, maintenance and repair procedures.

Chapter 5 
REPAIR OF CEMENT-STABILIZED SOIL (CSS) SURFACES  
 
5.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines approaches for repairing failed CSS surfaces 
on airfields. Procedures for removing and replacing Portland cement-stabilized 
materials as well as performing in-place repairs are presented. 
5.2. Background. The U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center 
(ERDC) was tasked to develop a method for repairing Portland cement-
stabilized surfaces. Test sections were constructed according to the criteria 
outlined in UFC 3-250-11, Soil Stabilization for Pavements, for cement-
stabilized silty sand (SM) soil and different repair methods were performed. The 
repair methods tested were: 1) saw cut, remove, and replace with original soil 
mixed with cement (small patch size only); and 2) milling and in-place remixing 
with cement and water. Repair sizes were full depth (6 inches) for two 8-foot by 
8-foot square areas for one test lane (Lane 1) and one 18-foot by 40-foot area for 
another test lane (Lane 2). Lane 1 did not receive traffic prior to the repair while 
Lane 2 was trafficked until failure prior to the repair being performed. Traffic 
was applied using a C-17 six-wheel load cart. 
5.3. Soil Stabilization. Soil stabilization is generally defined as making major 
improvements to the engineering properties of soils by amending the natural soil 
with an additive. These additives may include other soils or materials such as 
Portland cement, lime, fly ash, asphalt cement, polymers, and fibers. 
Traditionally, additives such as bitumen, cement, and lime have achieved 
widespread use. Bitumen is typically used as a soil surface treatment to limit 
dust and loss of fines. Cement is used to provide strength to soil. Lime is often 
used in clay soils to control plasticity. The long-term performance of pavements 
constructed using CSS is influenced by the characteristics of the soil, the type 
and quantity of stabilization additive, construction practices, pavement system 
design, loading frequency and magnitude, and the local climate/environment. 
5.3.1. CSS is often used as a base layer for pavements since it improves the 
strength of the soil. However, when used as a surface layer, it may suffer from 
durability problems. The durability problems arise from inherent susceptibility 
of the natural soil and the relatively lower amounts of cement used for soil 
stabilization combined with less-than-ideal moisture and curing conditions in 
most cases. The durability of cement-stabilized materials is addressed in UFC 3-
250-11 through ASTM D559-03, Standard Test Methods for Wetting and 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          71 
 
 
Drying Compacted Soil-Cement Mixtures, and ASTM D560-03, Standard Test 
Methods for Freezing and Thawing Compacted Soil-Cement Mixtures 
(depending on project climate), by establishing criteria for weight loss after 
simulated weather cycling. Additional information may be found in Army FM 5-
410, Military Soils Engineering, Chapter 9, Soil Stabilization for Roads and 
Airfields. 
5.3.2. Several cement-stabilized military airfields have been constructed in the 
continental United States: Holland Assault Landing Zone (ALZ) at Fort Bragg, 
North Carolina, All American ALZ at Little Rock AFB, Arkansas, and Fullerton 
Landing Zone and Self Landing Zone at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Holland ALZ was 
removed from service due to FOD issues and All American ALZ also suffered 
severe FOD issues due to CSS surface degradation. The CSS airfields at Fort 
Polk are reported to be performing well. 
5.3.3. The problems at Holland ALZ appeared to be primarily related to 
construction techniques. Considerable cracking and spalling were evident at 
longitudinal cold joints where adjacent lanes from the stabilizer machine 
abutted. There is evidence that some lanes may have been allowed to cure for a 
significant period before constructing the adjoining lane. This prevented 
adequate compaction and bond at the joint and possibly degraded the cured 
material due to the compactor bridging from the cured side into the uncured 
material. In many locations, it appeared that a thin layer of CSS was placed to 
achieve final grade. The thin layer failed to adequately bond to the underlying 
material, resulting in large sheets of CSS delaminating and becoming a serious 
FOD issue. No evidence of an emulsion coating was observed. An emulsion 
coating (such as asphalt or polymer) serves two functions. First, applied 
immediately after mixing and compaction, it serves to hold moisture within the 
pavement, allowing it to react with the cement. Second, it serves as a barrier to 
external moisture, minimizing CSS softening and freeze-thaw damage. 
5.3.4. The problems at All American ALZ were deemed to be both construction 
and material related. Problems resulting from placing thin layers of CSS were 
also observed at this site, similar to those observed at Holland ALZ. In addition, 
durability testing was not conducted during design, which likely led to reduced 
design cement content and an inadequate mix design. It was also noted in 
discussions with base personnel that the source of the borrow soil was changed 
in the middle of construction without verifying the mixture design’s adequacy. It 
was determined that moisture contents may not have been properly controlled 
 
72  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
during construction. Degradation of the pavement also appeared to be the result 
of moisture intrusion and freeze-thaw damage. This may have been exacerbated 
by not maintaining a moisture barrier (such as asphalt or polymer emulsion). 
Construction records indicated that an asphalt emulsion was applied after 
construction. However, it was not clear if the emulsion was applied immediately 
after completion of each portion of the surface or was applied to the completed 
runway. The moisture barrier should have been applied to each completed 
portion of the pavement and a final coat applied to the entire surface when the 
project was completed. The moisture barrier should also have been periodically 
reapplied based on surface wear from traffic and/or degradation due to 
weathering. 
5.3.5. Properly designed and constructed CSS airfields, such as those at Fort 
Polk, are performing well. However, proper maintenance—such as reapplying 
emulsion coatings (asphalt or polymer) to prevent water intrusion (especially in 
freeze-thaw areas) and spot-repair of failed areas is necessary to prevent CSS 
degradation. 
5.4. Repair Procedures. 
5.4.1. Remove and Replace. 
5.4.1.1. The remove-and-replace method is analogous to a full-depth repair of a 
concrete pavement. It may be used to repair small areas (localized damage of 
less than an 8-foot by 8-foot area) or large areas; however, this method is 
probably feasible only for repairs of less than 2,000 square feet if a reclaimer/ 
stabilizer is not available. A concrete saw may be used to cut the sides of the 
repair area and a jackhammer or backhoe can be used to remove the failed 
material. For larger areas, it may be more feasible to use a reclaimer/stabilizer 
device or a front-end loader mounted miller (fitted with carbide cutting teeth). If 
milling is used, the sloped ends of the milled area created by the milling drum 
will need to be sawed vertically to avoid feathering the edge of the repair. The 
exposed base course will also need to be smoothed and repaired if any damage is 
evident after removing the failed CSS. Typically, the depth of repairs should not 
exceed 6 to 7 inches for compacted soil (8 to 9 inches for loose fill). 
5.4.1.2. For smaller patch areas, the material should be prepared outside of the 
patch recess and then placed. The amount of soil to be used can be estimated 
based on the patch dimensions, depth, and maximum density at the optimum 
moisture content (OMC). Excess soil should be mixed and placed to allow for 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          73 
 
 
surface trimming of the patch after compaction. Prepare the soil to be used in the 
repair by drying, if necessary, or by adding water to obtain the proper moisture 
content. A front-end loader can be used to fold the soil repeatedly while wetting. 
Once the appropriate uniform moisture content has been obtained, the cement 
should be added and mixing continued until a uniform mixture is obtained. Once 
mixed, the cement will begin to cure with the moisture in the soil so work as 
quickly as possible. Immediately place the soil-cement mixture into the 
excavation and spread uniformly with a substantial overfill of 3 to 4 inches. To 
obtain a fully compacted 6-inch soil layer will require approximately 8 inches of 
loose, uncompacted soil. After compaction, the patch area should be 
immediately trimmed to match the grade of the adjoining pavement and covered 
or sprayed with an emulsion to seal the surface to prevent excess moisture loss. 
If using Type I cement, a minimum of seven days of curing should be allowed 
for temperatures above 40 °F (4 °C). For Type III cement (high early strength), a 
minimum of 24 hours of cure should be allowed for temperatures above 40 °F (4 
°C). The surface should be protected from freezing temperatures during the 
curing period. At temperatures below 40 °F (4 °C), Portland cement is not 
recommended. 
5.4.2. Mix In Place (MIP). 
5.4.2.1. The MIP method would typically be used for repairs where a large area 
of pavement needs repair and mixing soil cement outside the repair area is not 
practical. This method is feasible only for repairs of greater than 2,000 square 
feet. A reclaimer/stabilizer machine is recommended for the MIP process, 
although a milling drum mounted on a front-end loader may be used. The 
reclaimer/stabilizer machine may also be used to mill the damaged CSS for 
removal or reuse. The area to be repaired should be milled at a speed of less than 
30 feet per minute to allow for efficient cutting of the damaged CSS. Care must 
be taken to properly set the depth of the reclaimer/stabilizer to prevent base 
course damage. The milled material should be discarded and replaced with the 
same or similar soil unless time and material constraints dictate otherwise. 
5.4.2.2. After milling, the sloped edges created by lowering and raising the 
milling drum at the beginning and end of the milling process will need to be cut 
vertically to avoid feathered edges on the repair. If reusing the millings, it may 
be necessary to add some fresh soil to the millings to increase the volume of 
material. After compaction, it will be necessary to trim the repair area to grade, 
which requires some overfill of the repair area. Ideally, the milled material 
 
74  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
should be sampled and tested to determine the moisture-density relationship 
(ASTM D1557-09, Standard Test Methods for Laboratory Compaction 
Characteristics of Soil Using Modified Effort [56,000 ft-lbf/ft3 {2,700 kN-
m/m3}]) that will define the optimum moisture content for compaction. When 
testing is not practical, such as in a contingency environment, then the OMC of 
the millings, new soil, and cement must be estimated based on field tests and 
engineering judgment. 
5.4.3. Calculations. 
5.4.3.1. Calculations are required to determine the amount of cement and water 
to add for a given repair area and depth. The calculations are based on the 
maximum dry density of the material (based on Standard or Modified Proctor), 
soil volume, optimum moisture content of the soil, cement content, and moisture 
content prior to construction. If using cement bags, determine the spacing of the 
cement bags over the repair area to achieve the target stabilizer content. If a 
reclaimer/stabilizer machine outfitted with a spray-bar inside the cowling is 
being used for the MIP procedure then water pump rates must be determined 
based on ground speed to achieve the target moisture content. The cement bag 
spacing within the reclaimer/stabilizer mixing lane must also be determined. 
5.4.3.2. Stabilizer Calculations. 
A = area, square feet 
D = depth of cut, feet 
OMC = optimum moisture content, % 
MSM = measured soil moisture content, % 
MDDOMC = maximum dry density at optimum moisture of the unmodified 
soil, lbs/ft3 
PCement = percentage of cement by dry weight of soil, % 
WSoil = weight of soil to be stabilized, lbs 
WCement = weight of cement to be added to soil, lbs 
bag spacing = number of cement bags/area, bags/ft2 
VWater = volume of water needed to reach OMC, gals 
The weight of cement, WCement, required for the mixture is calculated from the 
volume of soil, the maximum dry density, and the percentage of cement to be 
used based on UFC 3-250-11. The MDDOMC for the soil-cement mixture should 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          75 
 
 
be determined according to ASTM D1557-09 and ASTM D558-11, Standard 
Test Methods for Moisture-Density (Unit Weight) Relations of Soil-Cement 
Mixtures. If the MDDOMC is not known for the mix but only for the unmodified 
soil, a rule of thumb is that for every 5% of cement added, increase by 1% the 
amount of water needed to reach OMC. For example, if the MDDOMC is 9% of 
the unmodified soil, for a 7% cement addition, the MDDOMC of the modified soil 
would be estimated at 10%. If 11% cement was being added, the estimated 
MDDOMC of the modified soil would be 11%. This increase in the OMC 
results from the increased fines present in the cement and the need for extra 
water to hydrate the cement. The cement bag spacing is then determined by 
dividing WCement by the weight of cement bags divided by the area (typically 
either square feet or square yards). The volume of water necessary to reach the 
OMC for the soil-cement mix is determined from the weight of soil, WSoil, and 
the OMC. 
WSoil = A x D x MDDOMC 
WCEMENT = WSoil x PCement

           8.33 
5.4.3.2.1. Remove and Replace. 
5.4.3.2.1.1. As an example of the remove-and-replace method, 7% cement is 
being used to make a 10-foot-wide by 10-foot-long by 6-inch-deep repair with a 
SM soil having MDDOMC = 130 lbs/ft3. The OMC of the unmodified soil is 9% 
and the MSM = 4%. Using the equations above: 
WSoil = 10 x 10 x 0.5 x 130 = 6500 lbs 
WCement = 6500 x 7% = 455 lbs 
number of bags = 455/94 = 4.8, so round up to 5 
bag spacing = 5/(10x10) = 1 bag per 20 sq. ft. 
VWater = [(6500+455) x (10-4)]/8.33 = 50 gals water 
 
76  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
5.4.3.2.1.2. The weight of soil is 6500 pounds, resulting in a cement weight of 
455 pounds. For 94-pound bags of cement (typical in the United States), 4.84 
bags are needed. Always round up to the nearest whole number so five bags of 
cement (bag spacing = 1 bag per 20 square feet) would be needed to repair the 
area. For 7% added cement, the OMC for the soil-cement mix would be 10% 
(OMC of the soil = 9% + 1% added for extra water needed for 5% to 10% 
cement dosage) and using the MSM, leads to VWater = 50 gals to reach a 10% 
OMC target. The water should be evenly mixed with the soil before mixing the 
cement. After the cement is well mixed, the material should immediately be 
evenly placed in the repair recess with a 3- to 4-inch overfill and well 
compacted. 
5.4.3.2.2. MIP. 
5.4.3.2.2.1. For the MIP method the calculations are the same. However, the 
cement needs to be spread in the mixing lane of the reclaimer/stabilizer machine. 
The target moisture content may be reached by surface addition of water to the 
area or by spray-bar, if equipped. Surface water addition is the simplest 
approach as this avoids the complications of using the spray-bar method. When 
using the spray-bar approach, a nurse truck with water tank is required, and the 
pump rate (typically in gals/minute) must be controlled according to the total 
gals of water required over the area, the speed of the machine, and the width of 
the cutter head. Overlap of adjacent lanes must be minimized to avoid 
overwatering the overlap area and lane spacing must be coordinated to match the 
size of the repair area. 
Bag Spacing/Lane =                     A 
                                  CHW x Number of Bags 
Pump Rate = VWater x CHW x Machine Speed 
                                               A 
A = area, square feet 
CHW = cutter head width, feet/lane 
PR = pump rate needed to reach optimum moisture, gals/minute 
bag spacing/lane = bag spacing in mixing lane, feet 
machine speed = feet/minute 
5.4.3.2.2.2. As an example, a 100-foot by 100-foot area needs to be repaired 
using the MIP method. The same soil and cement conditions as in the previous 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          77 
 
 
example will be used. According to the previous equations, WSoil = 650,000 
pounds and WCement = 45,500 pounds. For 94-pound bags of cement (typical in 
the United States), 484 bags are needed. The bag spacing would be the same as 
the previous example: one bag per 20 square feet. For the MIP method, it is best 
to spread these in the mixing lane. The cutter head width of 6 feet is used to 
yield a bag spacing/lane of 3.44 feet. Thus, a bag of cement would be placed 
about every 3.5 feet in a 6-foot-wide mixing lane. The cutter head width yields 
the number of machine lanes of 16.7, which is rounded up to 17. The VWater = 
5,010 gals to reach a 10% OMC target. Assuming a machine speed of 30 
feet/minute, a pump rate of approximately 90 gals/minute is needed to reach 
OMC. 
5.4.4. Compaction. For proper compaction and to achieve proper grade, the 
repair recess must be overfilled. This process is similar to a cold joint 
compaction method for asphalt pavement repair. The filled material should be 
placed or arranged to overlap the repair area a few inches and then raked back 
inside the edge to create a raised area of new repair material around the 
perimeter of the repair (Figure 5.1). A steel wheel roller in static mode should 
be used to initially compact or pinch the edges and corners. The raised edge 
should remain above the surrounding grade at all times during compaction. 
When operating the compactor inside the patch area, care should be exercised to 
compact as closely as possible to the edges and in the corners of the patch recess 
without getting the compactor drum or plate outside the patch area. This is 
especially critical if using vibration or a heavy drum compactor, as this may 
damage the surrounding pavement. Vibration should be used to compact the 
material to density. After compaction, the patch area should be trimmed with a 
grader to match the grade of the adjoining pavement. Static operation of a steel 
wheel roller may be used to remove roller marks or a rubber tire roller may be 
used to finish the surface. The patch area should then be sprayed with an 
emulsion to seal the surface to prevent excess moisture loss. 
5.5. Repair Location. The location of the repair may dictate the size of the 
repair needed. If the damaged area is outside the aircraft wheel path in the 
runway, a small patch may be appropriate. However, patches located within the 
wheel paths shall extend across the full width of the gear on both sides of the 
centerline such that the patch condition encountered by the aircraft gear is the 
same (Figure 5.2).

5.6. Additional Considerations. Further research may be needed to validate 
these repair methods under full-scale testing conditions for different CSS 
pavement thicknesses, repair sizes, types of soils, and cement contents. 
Environmental factors such as wet-dry and freeze-thaw conditions exacerbate 
CSS degradation, especially if strict construction specifications and routine 
maintenance are not followed. A research study may also be warranted to 
identify surface treatments that prevent moisture intrusion, retain frictional 
characteristics, provide a wearing course, and act as curing membranes.

CHEMICAL DUST CONTROL FOR AIRFIELDS 
 
6.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance for the mitigation of dust for 
contingency roads, base camps, helipads, and airfields. It also includes detailed 
guidance for selecting and applying chemical dust palliatives in contingency 
environments. The implementation of dust mitigation technology is necessary to 
reduce FOD potential, improve the safety of military operations, and reduce 
operational hazards to military personnel. 
6.2. Background. The U.S. military was plagued by fugitive dust during 
Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Airborne dust generated 
during air and ground operations had a significant impact on missions: ground 
vehicles experienced safety hazards during convoy activities and personnel were 
exposed to potential health hazards from fine particulate matter. In addition, the 
widespread accumulation of dust during ground vehicle operations and in base 
camps adversely impacted the ability of military personnel to effectively 
conduct combat operations.  
6.2.1. Rotary-wing aircraft often experienced “brown out” conditions, in which 
the density of airborne dust was such that the pilots lost sight of the ground, 
resulting in hazardous operating conditions. Aircraft and personnel were lost due 
to accidents resulting from “brown out” conditions. Fixed-wing aircraft 
operations in contingency environments generated significant dust from 
operating on semi-prepared surfaces and unusually narrow taxiways and 
runways. The generated dust resulted in increased aircraft maintenance, airfield 
maintenance (particularly sweeping operations), and reduced operations tempo 
while waiting for the dissipation of dust clouds generated during aircraft 
landings and departures. 
6.2.2. The U.S. Army ERDC was tasked by AFCEC to develop dust-control 
guidance to address these concerns. ERDC recently concluded research and 
development of chemical dust palliatives for the U.S. Marine Corps Systems 
Command for mitigating dust for two distinct applications: one for 
expeditionary use on forward area arming and refueling points and one for 
sustainment use on roads and other large area applications. The technology 
developed under the Marine Corps program was leveraged and applied to fixed-
wing aircraft operations, including field tests at two semi-prepared runway test

6.3.1.6. Table 6.1 provides a summary table for selecting a type or category of 
dust palliative recommended for a particular application. The table provides 
 
82  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
general guidance concerning the recommended application rate or quantity of 
each product, as well as information on whether the product should be diluted 
with water before use. Table 6.1 also indicates whether the material should be 
applied topically or admixed into the soil to achieve the desired dust control 
results. If site conditions or the mission scenario preclude the use of the primary 
solution, Table 6.1 also includes secondary solution recommendations. 
6.3.2. Detailed Dust Palliative Description. This section describes the different 
categories of recommended chemical dust palliatives. Selecting the correct type 
of dust palliative is critical to ensure the method of dust abatement is compatible 
with the mission. 
6.3.2.1. Polymer Emulsions. Polymer emulsions used for dust control are 
generally vinyl acetate or acrylic-based copolymers suspended in water by 
surfactants (Table 6.2). They typically consist of 40 percent to 50 percent solid 
particles by weight of emulsion. Once they are applied, the polymer particles 
begin to coalesce as the water evaporates from the system, leaving a soil-
polymer matrix that prevents small dust particles from escaping the surface. The 
polymers used for dust control typically have excellent tensile and flexural 
strength, adhesion to soil particles, and resistance to water. These materials are 
often limited by a short shelf life (less than 2 years). Some vendors dilute 
polymer emulsion products, so it is recommended that random samples of the 
bulk product be taken to ensure that the bulk product includes at least 40 percent 
solids according to ASTM D 2834. Polymer emulsions should not be mixed 
with gray water or salt water for dilution. If applied topically to helipads, take 
care to ensure sufficient application rates and penetration depths to avoid the 
formation of thin crusts (less than 1 inch), creating the potential for FOD. 
6.3.2.2. Polysaccharides. Polysaccharides are solutions or suspensions of sugars, 
starches, and surfactants in water (Table 6.3). They have excellent shelf life, but 
the solids may settle from the solution when the product is not stored per the 
manufacturer’s recommendations. Polysaccharides may be diluted with water, 
depending on the intended use. Polysaccharides provide dust abatement by 
encapsulating soil grains and providing a binding network in the ground. They 
are biodegradable and may leach from the soil with exposure to precipitation.

6.3.2.3. Synthetic Fluids. Synthetic organic fluids have an indefinite shelf life 
and are applied to a soil “as received.” These fluids (Table 6.4) are not miscible 
with water and are therefore unable to be diluted. They consist of isoalkanes that 
do not dry or cure with time. The reworkable binder is ready for immediate use 
upon application and maintains effectiveness over extended periods of time. 
Follow-on applications have a cumulative effect. Despite lower application rates 
for a given usage (i.e., airfields, roads, helipads, or base camps), since synthetic

6.3.3. General Application Information. This section briefly describes the 
primary considerations and methods for applying the recommended dust 
palliatives.  
6.3.3.1. Soil Type. The soil type has an effect on the performance of dust 
palliatives. Finer grained soils (silts and clays) present a larger problem with 
dust generation and are more difficult to control. The higher specific surface of 
the soil will require greater quantities of the product for treatment. Penetration 
may also be hindered by the small pore sizes between soil grains. Multiple light 
application rates may be required to effectively treat fine-grained soils and to 
prevent ponding or surface runoff. Coarse-grained soils (sands and gravels) 
typically have higher infiltration rates that minimize ponding or runoff. The soil 
should be classified according to ASTM D 2487. 
6.3.3.2. Intended Use. Choosing a dust palliative will ultimately be governed by 
the existing need for dust control. Some products work better for helipads, while 
others are more effective on roads or airfields. Each chemical has benefits and 
limitations which should be considered before selecting a product. Table 6.1 
lists some of the recommended product categories for different dust-control 
needs.  
6.3.3.3. Application Rates. Application rates should be chosen according to the 
soil type, the intended use of the treated area, and the necessary duration of use. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          85 
 
 
Dust palliatives should be applied at the rates given in Table 6.1. Synthetic 
fluids may be applied at lower rates for most projects because they contain 100 
percent active ingredients. Polymeric materials may require application rates 
greater than 1.0 gallon per square yard (gsy) in areas of heavy traffic. For 
example, using polymer emulsions on helipads will require an application rate of 
approximately 1.2 gsy to produce thicker surface crusts to reduce FOD potential. 
Refer to Table 6.1 for guidance on selecting application rates. Note that higher 
application rates may be required if the polymer emulsions/polysaccharides are 
pre-diluted by the vendor as evidenced by less than 40 percent solids according 
to ASTM D 2834. 
6.3.3.4. Dilution Ratios. Some products may require dilution with water. These 
are typically emulsified products (polymers and polysaccharides). Diluting an 
emulsion will reduce the viscosity and improve penetration. In general, 3 parts 
water should be added for each part product. Note that the recommended 
dilution ratio may need to be reduced if the palliatives have been pre-diluted by 
the vendor to less than 40 percent solids according to ASTM D 2834. Synthetic 
fluids are intended for use “as received” and should be applied in their 
concentrated form. 
6.3.3.5. Topical Method. Topical applications are the most commonly used 
technique for dust control. Spraying the surface of the soil with a dust palliative 
will solve most dust problems. Alternative methods should be used when the 
area to be treated is structurally deficient for the anticipated traffic or when 
greater durability is needed. Topical applications are accomplished by spraying 
the dust palliative onto the natural or prepared soil surface. It is imperative to 
maintain the greatest level of uniformity while dispersing the liquid. Application 
quantities are determined by estimating the area of ground surface to be treated 
and multiplying that area by the suggested application rate. Manufacturers’ 
literature indicate that topical applications are typically effective for 6 to 24 
months, dependent on soil type, compaction, penetration depth, climate, and 
traffic type and volume. Reapplication is generally performed at 20 percent to 30 
percent of the initial application rate. 
6.3.3.6. Admixture Method. Admix methods are designed to incorporate dust 
palliatives deeper into the soil and provide longer lasting dust abatement. These 
methods are usually necessary when heavy, repetitive loading will be applied to 
the soil. Roads and airfields (runways, taxiways, or parking aprons) generally 
require admix applications to achieve the desired results. Admix depths should 
 
86  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
be at least 3 inches (76 millimeters) for roads and at least 4 inches (102 
millimeters) for airfields. Recommend the following procedure to incorporate 
dust palliative into the soil:  
Step 1. Grade the soil, if necessary, using a motor grader (Figure 6.1). 
Figure 6.1. Grading Soil Surface before Treatment. 
 
Step 2. Spray half of total palliative application rate onto the soil surface 
(Figure 6.2). 
Figure 6.2. Applying with HydroSeeder & Mixing with Rotary Mixer. 
 
Step 3. Blend into the top 3 inches to 4 inches (76 millimeters to 102 
millimeters) of soil using a rotary mixer (Figure 6.2). 
Step 4. Compact using steel-wheeled vibratory roller (Figure 6.3).

Step 5. Spray remaining product onto the compacted surface (Figure 6.4). 
Figure 6.4. Applying Final Spray to Soil Surface after Compaction. 
 
This method will provide optimal performance of most palliatives. Alternative 
construction methods may not provide sufficient durability. 
6.3.3.7. Distribution Equipment. A variety of distribution equipment can be used 
to apply the palliatives. Table 6.5 includes some equipment used by the ERDC.

project needs are also available. It is recommended to consult ERDC researchers (1-601-
634-2467) before renting or purchasing any equipment. 
6.3.4. Detailed Application Guidance. This section provides detailed guidance 
for treating helipads; roads; large, open areas; base camps; and fixed-wing 
airfield facilities. Undiluted chemicals used in these processes pose a potential 
skin, eye and respiratory irritation hazard. Therefore, during mixing, personnel 
should avoid skin contact with these products by using—at a minimum—nitrile 
gloves (or other gloves approved by the site bioenvironmental engineer) and 
chemical goggles. Aprons and/or face shields may be necessary if a significant 
splash hazard exists. Mixing operations should be reviewed by the 
bioenvironmental engineer to determine if adequate ventilation exists. If the 
products are mixed outside in a well ventilated area, respiratory protection 
should not be required. The primary environmental concern with organic 
nonpetroleum dust and solvent-based suppressants is how they impact the 
groundwater quality, freshwater aquatic environment, and plant community. Do 
not apply these products in excess or directly to any water bodies, wetlands, or 
where excess product runoff could discharge to a water body (e.g., stream, lake, 
pond, wetlands). Take all necessary precautions to keep dust palliative materials 
out of water drainages and roadway ditches leading to streams. 
6.3.4.1. Dust Abatement on Unsurfaced Helipads. Equipment requirements may 
be modified depending upon availability and mission requirements; however, 
the general types of equipment and process should be similar. 
6.3.4.1.1. Supplies. Necessary supplies include the following: 
• 
Truck to haul the chemical totes, pumps, etc., and to tow the 
distribution equipment, if necessary. 
• 
HydroSeeder or other spray distribution system compatible with the 
selected chemical. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          89 
 
 
• 
Two to four 275-gal totes for dust palliative (synthetic fluid – primary 
solution). 
• 
One trash pump and sufficient hoses with quick-connect ends to 
transfer the material from the totes to the distributor if the distributor 
does not include a pump. 
6.3.4.1.2. General Procedures. General application procedures are as follows: 
Step 1. Survey and establish the area to be treated. 
Step 2. Place synthetic fluid into a HydroSeeder/distributor (Figure 6.5). 
Figure 6.5. Filling Hydroseeder from Material Tote. 
 
Note 1: Approximately 450 gals will be required for a 100-foot by 100-
foot (30-meter by 30-meter) helipad for smaller rotary-wing aircraft. 
Note 2: Approximately 900 gals will be required for a 150-foot by 150-
foot (46-meter by 46-meter) helipad for larger rotary-wing aircraft. 
Note 3: Greater quantities will be required for treating with a polymer 
emulsion (secondary solution). Follow dilution/application guidance in 
Table 6.1. 
Note 4: If a polymer emulsion is used as the secondary solution, the 
material must be diluted 3:1 with water and agitated for a minimum of 
five minutes before application. 
Step 3. Position the HydroSeeder/distributor on the edge of the helipad. 
Step 4. Use the tower gun and a long-distance nozzle to spray half of the 
product on half of the helipad (Figure 6.6).

               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
Step 5. Move to the opposite side of the helipad and spray the remaining 
product. 
Figure 6.6. Topical Material Application from HydroSeeder Tower Gun. 
 
Step 6. If the distributor does not have standoff spray capability, it may be 
necessary to traverse the helipad to ensure spray overlap. (Note: If the 
helipad ruts significantly under the distributor, an attempt to smooth the ruts 
should be made and the ruts retreated by a hand wand to keep the ruts from 
acting as erosion focal points during aircraft operations.) 
Helicopters may land immediately on areas treated with synthetic fluids; 
however, for best results wait one day before trafficking (Figure 6.7). If a 
polymer emulsion is used as the alternative solution, the material must be 
allowed to cure for 24 hours before allowing traffic on the helipad.

6.3.4.2. Dust Abatement on Unsurfaced Roads. Equipment requirements may be 
modified depending upon availability and mission requirements; however, the 
general types of equipment and the process should be similar. 
6.3.4.2.1. Supplies. Necessary supplies include the following: 
• 
Motor grader for initial grading, if necessary. 
• 
Truck and/or HMMWV to haul chemical totes, pumps, etc., and to tow 
the distribution equipment, if necessary. 
• 
HydroSeeder or other chemical distributor compatible with the 
product(s). 
• 
Polymer emulsion and water (primary solution). Note: Quantities must 
be calculated based upon the recommended product application rate 
and the length and width of the road. 
• 
Rotary mixer for admixing. 
• 
Steel-wheeled vibratory compactor. 
6.3.4.2.2. General Procedures. The general application procedures are as 
follows: 
Step 1. Grade the road to establish general grade requirements and correct 
distresses. 
Step 2. Determine the length of road that can be treated per tank of product 
(HydroSeeder/distributor tank capacity) as follows: 
Length (yard [yd])=[Tank Capacity (gal)]/[Application Rate (gsy)]x[Road 
Width (yd)] 
Step 3. Place 675 gals of water into HydroSeeder/distributor (minimum 
900-gal capacity). For smaller distribution equipment, recalculate quantities 
to match the recommended dilution ratio. 
Step 4. Add 225 gals of polymer emulsion. 
Step 5. Mix for five minutes using mechanical agitation. 
Step 6. Apply product to the road surface using a distribution bar or wide 
fan nozzle on the tower gun. 
Step 7. Immediately till the road surface with a rotary mixer to a depth of 3 
inches (76 millimeters). 
Step 8. Compact the soil until the desired density is achieved. 
 
92  
               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
Step 9. Spray a light application (~0.2 gsy) of the product over the 
compacted road surface. 
Step 10. Repeat steps 1 through 9 for all subsequent road lengths to be 
treated. 
6.3.4.2.3. If a synthetic fluid (secondary solution) is used, it is applied in a 
topical application following the general approach described for dust abatement 
on unsurfaced helipads. 
6.3.4.3. Dust Abatement in Base Camps and other Non-Traffic Areas. The 
application guidance for these areas is less robust and more cost effective since 
the surface is subjected to reduced loading requirements. Thus, this guidance 
should not be used for areas directly exposed to vehicle traffic. Equipment 
requirements may be modified depending upon availability and mission 
requirements; however, the general types of equipment and process should be 
similar. 
6.3.4.3.1. Supplies. Necessary supplies include the following: 
• 
Truck and/or HMMWV to haul the chemical totes, pumps, etc., and to 
tow the distribution equipment, if necessary. 
• 
HydroSeeder or other chemical distributor compatible with the 
product(s). 
• 
Synthetic fluid. Note: Quantities must be calculated based upon the 
recommended product application rate and the length and width of the 
area to be treated. 
6.3.4.3.2. General Procedures. The general application procedures are as 
follows: 
Step 1. Determine the area that can be treated per tank of product 
(HydroSeeder/distributor tank capacity) as follows: 
Area (square yard [sq yd])=[Tank Capacity (gal)] / [Application Rate (gsy)] 
Step 2. Fill the distribution equipment with the synthetic fluid. Do not 
dilute. 
Step 3. Apply product to the soil surface using a distribution bar, wide fan 
nozzle on the tower gun, or a hand wand/hose. 
Step 4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 as required to treat the desired area. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          93 
 
 
6.3.4.4. Dust Abatement around Fixed-Wing Airfields. For paved airfields, 
chemical dust palliatives may be used on any unpaved area around the perimeter 
of the pavement, including unpaved shoulders and graded areas. Due to safety 
concerns associated with surface friction requirements, dust palliatives are not 
recommended on any primary operating surface of unsurfaced airfields. The 
exception is when a polymer emulsion is used as a soil stabilization agent and 
effectively admixed into the soil at depths greater than 4 inches (102 mm) and at 
higher application rates, typical of soil stabilization. Additionally, since the 
shoulders of unsurfaced airfields are designed to support occasional aircraft 
loading, it is also recommended that the products not be used on shoulders of 
unsurfaced airfields. Thus, for unsurfaced airfields, the use of chemical dust 
palliatives is limited to the graded areas. Due to potential FOD concerns, it is 
highly recommended that synthetic fluids be used for this application. If the 
alternative polymer emulsion solution is used, the material MUST be admixed 
into the soil to minimize FOD potential. Polymer emulsions or other 
stabilization additives cannot be topically applied around fixed-wing airfields 
due to the potential to form thin crusts capable of generating FOD. Equipment 
requirements may be modified depending upon availability and mission 
requirements; however, the general types of equipment and the process should 
be similar. 
6.3.4.4.1. Supplies. Necessary supplies include the following: 
• 
Truck and/or HMMWV to haul the chemical totes, pumps, etc., and to 
tow the distribution equipment, if necessary. 
• 
HydroSeeder or other chemical distributor compatible with the 
products. 
• 
Synthetic fluid. Quantities must be calculated based upon the 
recommended application rate and the length and width of the area to 
be treated. 
6.3.4.4.2. General Procedures. The general application procedures are as 
follows: 
Step 1. Determine the area of airfield that can be treated per tank of product 
(HydroSeeder/distributor tank capacity) as follows: 
Area (sq yd) = [Tank Capacity (gal)] / [Application Rate (gsy)] 
Step 2. Fill the distribution equipment with synthetic fluid. Do not dilute. 
Step 3. Apply to soil surface using a distribution bar or wide fan nozzle on

Step 4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 as required to treat the desired area. 
6.3.4.4.3. Application Areas for Fixed-Wing Facilities. A major consideration in 
the treatment of areas around fixed facilities is the size of the area requiring 
treatment. The width of treatment along the perimeter is generally reasonable; 
however, the length of treatment for airfields can range from 1 to 3 miles per 
side of the runway—the resulting treatment area can accumulate quickly. 
Analyses of the propeller/jet wakes for the C-130 and C-17 aircraft were 
performed to develop recommendations for the width of the area to be treated. 
The minimum treatment width for effective treatment is based upon the 
wingspan of the aircraft and the highest intensity exhaust plume, while the 
optimum treatment width is based upon the distance required to reduce the 
exhaust plume to a maximum velocity of 50 feet per second (35 miles per hour). 
As general guidance, the treatment width along each side of the runway and 
around any turnarounds or aprons should be: 
• 
C-130 minimum treatment width: 27 feet (8 meters) 
• 
C-130 optimum treatment width: 50 feet (15 meters) 
• 
C-17 minimum treatment width: 50 feet (15 meters) 
• 
C-17 optimum treatment width: 100 feet (30 meters) 
For unsurfaced fixed-wing facilities, the treatment should begin at the edge of 
the shoulder and be applied outward into the graded area and transition area. For 
paved fixed-wing facilities, the treatment should begin at the edge of the paved 
surface and extend outward for the recommended width.

Terms 
contingency location—A non-enduring location outside of the United States 
that supports and sustains operations during named and unnamed contingencies 
or other operations as directed by appropriate authority and is categorized by 
mission life-cycle requirements as initial, temporary, or semi-permanent. 
(DODD 3000.10) 
Critical Pavement Condition Index (PCI)—The PCI value of a section at 
which the rate of deterioration significantly increases and return on investment 
of PM decreases. Critical PCI (or breakdown point) will depend on the 
pavement type, pavement use, and traffic level, and is unique for each base. 
Until the PAVER software is configured to calculate the critical PCI, the policy 
PCI of 70 will be the default critical PCI for primary pavements and 55 for 
secondary and tertiary pavements. In the future, PAVER will develop critical 
PCIs for runways, taxiways, aprons, overruns, shoulders, asphalt concrete, and 
PCC pavements. 
Global Preventive Maintenance (PM)—Global PM is used to retard or slow 
pavement deterioration. Generally, global PM is effective at the beginning of 
pavement life and/or when climate-caused distresses have not started or, in some 
cases, the severity is low or medium. Global PM, like localized PM, may be 
performed in response to the appearance or progression of distress, but is more 
commonly performed on a recurring schedule (i.e., at set time intervals) without 
regard for the distresses present. 
Localized Preventive Maintenance (PM)—Localized PM consists of 
maintenance actions performed on pavement at the location of individual 
distresses to slow down the rate of pavement deterioration. It differs from global 
PM in that it typically is not applied to pavement outside of the location of the 
distress, whereas global PM is applied to areas of the pavement that may not be 
distressed. 
Pavement Condition Index (PCI)—PCI is a numerical indicator between 0 and 
100 that reflects the surface condition of the pavement. 
PAVER—pavements management software used by DOD, government, and 
private industry  
Policy PCI—A project should be programmed before the pavement reaches 
these conditions: 
 
AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017                                                          99 
 
 
• 
Sections with a PCI greater than or equal to 71 generally require minor 
M&R 
• 
Sections with a PCI of 56 to 70 generally require major and/or minor 
M&R  
• 
Sections with a PCI of 41 to 55 generally require major and minor 
M&R or reconstruction 
• 
Sections with a PCI of 26 to 40 generally require major repair or 
reconstruction 
• 
Sections with a PCI less than or equal to 25 generally require 
reconstruction 
Preventive Maintenance (PM)—PM is a program of activities that preserves 
the investment in pavements, reduces the rate of degradation due to specific 
distresses, extends pavement life, enhances pavement performance, and reduces 
mission impact. PM includes localized PM and global PM. Both are performed 
on pavements that are above the critical PCI and are intended to maintain good 
pavements in good condition at minimal cost. 
Preventive Maintenance Plan (PMP)—PMP is a plan for sustainment funds, 
i.e., a document that informs base leadership: 
• 
When maintenance is needed 
• 
What maintenance activities are to be performed 
• 
How the work is to be accomplished 
• 
What is the cost for the work and what is the risk if the work is not 
accomplished 
As a minimum, the PMP should include a prioritized list of projects by contract 
and in-house with location, quantity, estimated cost, and the risk associated with 
not performing the work. 
Primary Pavements—Primary pavements are mission-essential pavements 
such as runways, parallel taxiways, main parking aprons, arm-disarm pads, alert 
aircraft pavements, and overruns (when used as a taxiway or for takeoff). In 
general, only pavements used by aircraft on a daily basis or frequently used 
transient taxiways and parking areas are considered primary pavements. 
Rate of Pavement Deterioration—This is the rate at which a specific pavement 
at a specific location deteriorates over time. This rate is dependent on climatic 
conditions, pavement use, and traffic level.

               AFTTP 3-32.16   20 JANUARY 2017 
 
Tertiary Pavements—Tertiary pavements include pavements used by towed or 
light aircraft, such as maintenance hangar access aprons, aero club parking, 
wash racks, and overruns (when not used as a taxiway or for takeoff or to test 
aircraft arresting gear). Paved shoulders are classified as tertiary. In general, any 
pavement that does not support aircraft taxiing under their own power or is used 
only intermittently is considered a tertiary pavement.
