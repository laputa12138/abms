FUNCTIONAL AREA MANAGER (FAM) 
2.1.  Functional Area Manager. 
2.1.1.  Functional Area Manager Overview. The FAM is the individual accountable for the 
management and oversight of all personnel and equipment within a specific functional area’s 
UTCs to support operational planning and execution. Responsibilities may include developing 
and reviewing policy; developing, managing, and maintaining UTCs IAW DAFMAN 10-406, 
Unit Type Code Management; developing criteria for and monitoring readiness reporting; 
analyzing force posturing; and performing execution activities crucial to the management, and 
execution of our readiness programs. Component Major Commands (C-MAJCOMs) and 
Component Numbered Air Forces (C-NAFs) will appoint FAMs to provide guidance to 
address unique capabilities. C-MAJCOM and C-NAFs guidance will supplement and not 
conflict with HAF FAM guidance. (T-1) 
2.1.2.  FAMs play a significant part in the USAF operation planning process and their 
continual involvement in the war planning process is essential to accomplishing the USAF’s 
wartime mission. 
2.1.3.  Managers and supervisors will ensure only the most highly knowledgeable and 
experienced people in the grade of E-7 and above or civilian equivalent are selected and 
assigned to be FAMs. (T-3) 
2.1.3.1.  Within 90 calendar days of appointment, FAMs will access and complete the 
training material located on the FAM Community of Practice (CoP) SharePoint website 
managed by AF/A3OD at  https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/13160/SitePages/Home.aspx. The 
FAM CoP hosts access to training material, the FAM roster, as well as tools applicable to 
their duties.   Functional directors must ensure the FAMs are provided the tools, time, and 
training required to do their job. (T-1) 
2.1.4.  In some functional areas, it may be necessary to appoint more than one FAM to 
effectively manage a large or complex functional area. For example, in the JFXXX UTC series 
(Fuels and Supply) appointment of one FAM to manage Fuels and one FAM to manage Supply 
may be necessary. 
2.1.5.  General FAM Responsibilities. FAMs at each level are concerned with the same broad 
planning areas; however, the specific activities accomplished at each level are unique. FAM 
duties and responsibilities are listed below: 
2.1.5.1.  Provide Functional Area Guidance. FAMs, with approval of appropriate 
functional director, develop guidance consistent with the primary purpose of maximizing 
their functional area’s operational readiness and responsiveness to mission requirements in 
support of the AFFORGEN. When drafting functional guidance, FAMs should consider 
the needs of the supported commander, the availability of CCDR assigned forces, the 
ability of a functional area to implement the guidance, such as UTC construct and 
availability, the effect the guidance has on the supporting command, and the degree to 
which the guidance will enhance the readiness and availability of personnel and equipment.

19 
 
2.2.2.  Below the Air Staff, the MAJCOM OFAMO, along with the office responsible for UTC 
management, i.e., Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK) 
Responsible Agency OPR, should be in the same directorate. Whenever there is MAJCOM 
staff disagreement on FAM responsibilities, the OFAMO will be the final arbitrator and 
decision authority (per MAJCOM/CD authority) as to which Directorate or Agency in the 
MAJCOM will be the OPR for any UTC or UTC series. 
2.2.3.  The OFAMO will assist in scheduling FAM training requirements, determining 
additional training requirements, and tracking appointment status of all FAMs in the command 
or agency. (T-1) 
2.2.4.  The OFAMO, working with their MAJCOM or equivalent OPRs, will ensure all FAMs 
have access to systems and tools required to perform their duties. (T-1) 
2.2.5.  At a minimum, the OFAMO will hold quarterly FAM meetings to discuss FAM issues, 
disseminate policy and guidance, and/or conduct MAJCOM specific training. (T-1). Issues that 
cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM level will be forwarded to AF/A3OD for review and action 
as necessary. The OFAMO will act as the facilitator for cross-functional UTC matters (e.g., 
9AAX HQ UTCs). (T-1) 
2.2.6.  The OFAMO will maintain a current roster of FAMs for their organization and upload 
to the FAM CoP website. The current roster will be based upon directorate FAM appointment 
letters that will be maintained by the OFAMO. The directorate FAM appointment letter will 
mandate FAMs to attend meetings and conferences scheduled by the OFAMO. (T-1) 
2.2.7.  The OFAMO will maintain a database of current FAMs to determine formal and 
informal training. The OFAMO will provide new FAMs an in-processing checklist. (T-1) 
2.2.8.  The OFAMO initiates action with the respective manpower function to ensure the UMD 
positions of assigned FAMs are coded to reflect the R-prefix. (T-1) 
2.2.9.  The OFAMO serves as the critical interface between FAMs and the other staff readiness 
support offices. Readiness support offices are defined as those traditional "X" functions 
(operations, logistics, manpower, and personnel) and readiness program OPRs such as 
readiness reporting, MEFPAK, or Reserve management. The OFAMO: 
2.2.9.1.  Intercedes to address problems between FAMs and program OPRs. 
2.2.9.2.  Develops command supplemental policies to ensure the smooth application of this 
instruction with command-unique requirements.

Chapter 3 
FORCE STRUCTURE 
3.1.  Force Structure Overview.  Force structure is the composition of DoD organizations, both 
military and civilian, which comprise, and support defense forces as specified by the national 
defense authorization acts and defines the organizational hierarchy through which leadership 
authorities are exercised. Force structure includes JCS Unit Descriptor Code (UDC), Force and 
Infrastructure Categories (F&IC), and Program Element Code (PEC). 
3.1.1.  JCS UDC Code. The JCS UDC is the mechanism for differentiating between 
organizations fulfilling Title 10 USC responsibilities and those designated for Title 10 USC 
combatant commander warfighting support will be the JCS UDC. Every organization (defined 
by a Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS)) is described by a JCS UDC as combat, combat 
support, combat service support, or “Other.” The JCS UDC applies to the entire unit, not the 
Air Force specialty code (AFSC) or the authorization/personnel assigned to the organization. 
3.1.1.1.  Organizations will have only one UDC, and manpower agencies should select the 
UDC that most closely describes the organization’s primary mission. (T-0) If a MAJCOM 
determines that an organization can be “Other” or one of the “combat” categories, the 
MAJCOM should select the combat category that most closely describes the organization’s 
primary mission. The codes, and descriptions outlined in Table 3.1 will be used to identify 
Air Force organizations. (T-0) For a complete list of JCS UDC codes used throughout the 
Services, refer to CJCSM 3150.02B, Global Status of Resources and Training System 
(GSORTS). 
3.1.1.2.  Organizations identified as combat, combat support, or combat service support in 
the JCS UDC field in the PAS file are considered warfighting organizations and will 
posture UTCs IAW Table 3.1 below. Units with a UDC of “Other” (X, Q, 9 or 0) are 
Institutional Forces and will not posture UTCs. (T-0) 
3.1.2.  Forces and Infrastructure Categories (F&IC). 
3.1.2.1.  The Department of Defense established the force and infrastructure framework for 
senior decision-makers to organize and display every dollar, person, and piece of 
equipment using the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). The framework uses two 
types of organizational categories: forces and infrastructure. See Figure 3.1. 
3.1.2.2.  The accuracy of the F&ICs requires the accurate alignment of program element 
codes which can found on UMD and assigned to the appropriate category. Each program 
element is aligned to only one category and no program element is split across multiple 
categories. For this reason, understanding the conceptual model behind the display is 
crucial to correct program element alignment. 
3.1.2.3.  Force organizations contain the FE available for employment by the CCDRs. 
Infrastructure is the set of activities needed to create and sustain those forces. Infrastructure 
organizations are the laboratories, depots, test ranges, schools, and hospitals assigned 
exclusively to the Military Departments as well as minimum base support activities. 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
21 
 
Figure 3.1.  Force and Infrastructure Categories (F&ICs). 
 
3.1.2.4.  Figure 3.1  groups F&IC-1 forces, as the warfighting tools of the CCDRs, into 
broad operationally employable categories according to their intended use-to defend the 
homeland, or to fight overseas. These categories recognize the increased role of DoD’s 
intelligence operations, along with such non-traditional activities as security cooperation 
and nuclear threat-reduction programs. All of these, taken together, are the department’s 
means for achieving essential national security goals. 
3.1.2.5.  F&IC-2 infrastructure activities recruit, train, assign, and administer people. 
Infrastructure activities develop, procure, distribute, sustain materiel, houses military 
forces, and helps them communicate. Infrastructure represents the support functions 
organized apart from operational forces and assigned exclusively to the Military 
Departments by the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 
1986. 
3.2.  Program Element Code (PEC) Guidance and F&IC. 
3.2.1.  The DoD force structure framework enables senior decision-makers to organize and 
display programming of personnel and equipment using the FYDP. 
3.2.1.1.  To align within this framework, the AF synchronizes the posturing of its 
capabilities based on the AFFORGEN model with the Global Force Management-Data 
Initiative (GFM-DI). The GFM-DI directs the alignment of appropriate ADS and the 
operational FE planning constructs to comply with Joint Staff mandates to provide global 
visibility and force structure. The PEC and its association to the F&IC data elements 
provide a common department-wide visualization of force structure. 
3.2.2.  F&IC displays the department’s forces and infrastructure framework in their 
administrative relationship with their supporting infrastructure. Each PEC has an affiliated 
F&IC.

3.2.2.1.  F&IC-1, Forces – Specific FEs within operating forces and command and 
intelligence structure that are assigned or allocated to the CCDRs. Manpower 
authorizations with this F&IC are the Services deployable forces. Employed-in-Place (EIP) 
forces will also be aligned to F&IC-1. (T-0) 
3.2.2.2.  F&IC-2, Infrastructure – Means for creating and sustaining (manning, training and 
equipping) DoD forces.  Posturing FIC-2 positions in UTA deviates from the AFFORGEN 
construct and will only be allowed with AF/A3OD approval. (T-1)

3.3.  Building Capabilities. 
3.3.1.  UTCs compose the basic building blocks for the force packaging methodology. UTCs 
may contain both manpower (military, civilian, and /or contractor) and equipment details, 
manpower FE, and/or required equipment only. USAF planners use UTCs to document total 
manpower and logistics requirements (including contractor personnel and equipment) needed 
to support operational planning and execution activities. See DAFMAN 10-406 for further 
guidance. 
3.3.2.  Manpower is a critical resource that enables a combat capable and ready force to 
accomplish NDS objectives. These objectives are accomplished with efficient allocation of 
manpower resources organized and employed to provide required effectiveness and combat 
power to successfully execute the unit’s mission. Accordingly, risk mitigation takes 
precedence over cost savings when necessary to maintain appropriate control of government 
operations and missions. 
3.3.3.  Authorizations are funded requirements identified on the UMD as a result of a 
manpower study or negotiated at the establishment of an association. Some of the key data 
elements provided on the unit manning document are the UDCs, F&ICs and the associated 
PECs. The Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES) is the authoritative data 
source for force structure and unit manning documents. Manpower requirements are 
determined from the results of manpower studies and assessments of operational and support 
capabilities. Additional guidance can be found in AFI 38-101. The UMD is the authoritative 
reference for identifying funded authorizations by PEC. Manpower servicing activities will 
assist in identifying which funded authorizations will be postured into standard UTCs. (T-1)

3.4.  Forces. 
3.4.1.  Specific units within the operating forces or command and intelligence structure are 
assigned to the CCDRs by the Service secretaries. The Forces For Unified Commands 
Memorandum (commonly referred to as the “Forces For”) captures the existing forces, their 
equipment, and their organic support. The SecDef-signed “Forces For” represents the formal 
assignment, or Service retention, of units. 
3.4.2.  The assigned units’ activities cover a range of combat and organic support activities.  
They include the organic activities with which the warfighting echelons are designed to 
operate. Examples of tactical organic activities include logistics units that support manpower 
and equipment, communications and intelligence units, and the operational Headquarters 
USAF that directs the forces. 
3.4.3.  These resources encompass the range of activities designed to operate under the 
operational command of the CCDRs. Taken together, these warfighting FE and their organic 
support constitute the vast bulk of the military force structure. 
3.4.4.  The primary warfighting capabilities are contained within the readily available forces, 
assigned forces, and/or the employed-in-place forces. These forces are postured in UTA to 
support rotational and emergent allocation requirements. Force providers, in coordination with 
the designated Service force providers, provide their FE to the Joint Staff for allocation (T-1) 
and if the phrase GFM policies is needed, recommend specifying which policies need to be 
followed. 
3.4.5.  DCAPES’s UTA contains all the FEs aligned to the AFFORGEN phases and projected 
across the FYDP timeframe. The FEs within the library are available for sourcing to meet 
requirements across the range of military operations. 
3.4.6.  The UTA will be used as the authoritative source for determining a unit's ability to 
support CCDR needs, both deployable and in-place.  The units will procure items, obtain 
training, report UTC planning evaluation, etc. to provide fully capable forces. 
3.5.  Expeditionary Manpower Planning Functions. 
3.5.1.  USAF expeditionary manpower management will follow the following processes: 
3.5.1.1.  Use operational plans, planning scenarios, or other force lists comprising the 
NMS, as a tool to conduct manpower assessments identifying required manpower. (T-0) 
3.5.1.2.  Determine and package manpower requirements to accomplish specific and 
functionally oriented workload associated with employed-in-place or deploying forces. 
This is accomplished in the form of UTCs contained in the manpower force packaging 
system. Manpower requirements for infrastructure of institutional forces are not usually 
identified in a UTC. 
3.5.1.3.  Ensure accurate use of manpower when developing force packages to satisfy force 
employment requirements. (T-1) 
3.5.1.4.  Ensure the force employment requirements needed to accomplish assigned 
operational tasks, and associated theater in-place requirements, are documented in the 
appropriate operational plan TPFDD (applicable to level 3T/4 plans only). (T-1) 
24 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
3.5.1.5.  Ensure the force requirements will be identified as positions on a Deployment 
Requirements Manning Document (DRMD) under an operational plan force requirement 
number UTC. (T-1) 
3.5.1.6.  Ensure all force requirements will be created and managed by expeditionary 
manpower processes and procedures at different organizational levels. (T-1) 
3.5.1.7.  Ensure each position in a DRMD will have a tasking type made up of the 
deployment type and the supported organization. (T-1) 
3.5.1.8.  Document 
unavailable/shortfall 
manpower 
force 
package 
employment 
requirements associated with the operational plan TPFDD. (T-1) 
3.5.1.9.  Manage the manpower requirements of installation-level plans which contain the 
installation-level requirements and taskings associated with operational plans. (T-1) 
3.5.1.10.  Inform the FYDP planning process and annual Presidential Budgets to ensure 
adequate funding for ARC sourcing solutions. (T-1) 
3.5.2.  Expeditionary manpower management responsibilities at all levels of command are 
based on the need to prepare and maintain our forces so they are ready to perform their 
missions. All MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs (or equivalent) manpower servicing activities will: 
3.5.2.1.  Advise commanders of options to resolve discrepancies between the total UTC/in-
place requirement needs and available UMD authorizations. Provide unit readiness 
monitors with the unit authorization information to include deployment and in-place 
requirements data and requirements-to-resources analysis using applicable MPES data 
elements. (T-3) Additional guidance can be found in AFI 38-101. 
3.5.2.2.  Upon request, the manpower section will provide requirement information to the 
augmentation review board and assist them by identifying those requirements critical to 
the augmentation scenario as well as augmentation scenario-unique requirements. (T-3) 
The manpower section assists the augmentation review board and FAMs in validating the 
necessary requirements and identifying those available for augmentation. See Air Force 
Pamphlet (AFPAM) 10-243, Augmentation Duty, for further details. 
3.5.2.3.  Provide MPES authorization information to the augmentation review board. (T-1) 
3.5.2.4.  Provide the augmentation review board a listing of currently planned deployment 
requirements using DCAPES. (T-1) 
3.5.3.  All manpower staffs/offices/flights/elements will: 
3.5.3.1.  Provide commanders, functional managers (FMs), and appropriate decision 
makers at all levels with agile, timely, and relevant manpower information that underpins 
DAF strategies in line with AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization. 
3.5.3.2.  Provide MPES information to FAMs for possible tasked units. (T-1) 
3.5.3.3.  Analyze MPES AFSC level detail information against the requirements identified 
in the postured UTCs. (T-1) 
3.5.3.4.  Ensure the unit’s postured UTCs do not exceed UMD authorizations. (T-1) 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
25 
 
3.5.3.5.  Ensure unit Deployment Indicator (DEPID)-9 UTCs in the USAF PAS are 
correctly aligned to unit mission types in coordination with MAJCOM FAM. 
3.5.3.6.  Air Force units are required to ensure the data contained in the unit master file is 
accurate per DoDI 7730.64, Automated Extracts of Manpower and Unit Organizational 
Element Files. (T-0) Specifically, managing organizations need to ensure the correct unit 
identification code for the organization with operational control is identified in the correct 
data field. (T-1) Unit master file data elements are updated on a quarterly basis or when 
the information changes.

FORCE PRESENTATION 
4.1.  AFFORGEN Force Presentation Construct. 
4.1.1.  Force Presentation Overview. AFFORGEN is the Air Force’s sustainable, capacity‐
driven model for presenting forces to JFCs. AFFORGEN’s intent is to enable operational 
preparedness and readiness recovery to compete with peer competitors, while clearly focusing 
USAF efforts on a predictable and sustainable force offering. All MAJCOMs will align their 
forces into the AFFORGEN model. (T-1) 
4.1.2.  Operating forces by themselves are not discrete, employable entities. Operational forces 
may deploy and attach to the existing USAF component organizational construct or attach to 
an air expeditionary task force (AETF) provisional organizational construct for operational 
employment. 
4.1.3.  The Air Force’s force presentation construct effectively presents and reports readiness 
of forces and capabilities to support NDS and NMS and enhances how the Service presents 
operational capabilities to JFCs. 
4.1.4.  The USAF offers major operational AFFORGEN FEs to the JFC and the Service 
components to establish an AETF. IAW AF Doctrine Publication (AFDP) 3-30, Command and 
Control, an AETF is task-organized at time of execution based on the operational mission 
requirements. The AETF is a provisional organizational construct established for a temporary 
period to perform a specified mission. Additional guidance can be found in AFDP 3-30 and 
AFI 38-101. 
4.1.5.  AF/A3 implements SecAF guidance to align force readiness reporting and force 
generation mechanisms to build AFFORGEN FE capabilities for major combat operations 
(MCOs). These FE are presented to the Joint Force under the AFFORGEN model and represent 
the primary portfolio of operational capabilities the USAF provides for the Nation’s defense. 
4.1.6.  An AFFORGEN FE is a specific unit of measure the USAF uses to offer forces to the 
JFC. It is a composition of multiple UTCs that represents an operational capability and should 
not be disaggregated into individual UTCs. 
4.1.7.  The AFFORGEN model provides capabilities in a provisional organizational construct 
to preserve USAF unity of command and unity of effort. An organizational construct can be 
tailored in size and composition as appropriate for the mission. USAF operational planning 
efforts must focus on the ability of the AETF construct to integrate and sustain command and 
control (C2) during mission execution. (T-1) 
4.1.8.  Enabled by force generation, force employment is how the Air Force applies the desired 
effects or influences the strategic and operational environment (e.g., via Dynamic Force 
Employment (DFE), Agile Combat Employment (ACE) rotational requirements or crisis 
planning). Force employment involves planning, force management, and decision making. The 
USAF contributes to a joint combined arms approach in its plans to apply a global perspective 
to strategy, campaigning, and operations across all domains in multiple regions. 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
27 
 
4.2.  Defining Capabilities. 
4.2.1.  There are many contingency planning scenarios, and each are based on specific threats, 
mission requirements and/or assumptions relying on guidance contained in the NMS and other 
supporting documents. These documents direct the preparation of a wide range of plans to meet 
the SecDef or CJCS contingency planning requirements or orders. These plans focus on 
specific, anticipated threats and current force structure from a force employment perspective 
within a given theater of operations. The plans also identify the total (not just in-theater) force 
structure requirements, from a force provider perspective, to respond to the threats specified in 
the NMS. 
4.2.2.  AFFORGEN enables risk articulation to the joint force, aligns readiness reporting and 
force generation processes with emphasis on the high-end fight. 
4.2.3.  The AFFORGEN force elements are a method of packaging command and control, 
operational forces, and combat support forces for presentation to a combatant command 
through the service component commander. These FEs were developed to provide a 
standardized template to optimize initial planning through rapid requirements generation. 
4.2.4.  FEs expedite the adaptive planning process. The FEs are linked together and uniquely 
identified so that they may be extracted from or adjusted as an entity within DCAPES to 
enhance flexibility and usefulness of the operations planning and execution process. 
4.2.5.  The AFFORGEN FEs are Open the Airbase (OTB), Command and Control, Establish 
the Airbase, Mission Generation, Operate the Airbase and Robust the Airbase. See Figure 4.1. 
The planning factors for the FEs are at Attachment 2. 
Figure 4.1.  AFFORGEN Force Presentation. 
 
4.2.5.1.  When utilized in concert, the scalable FE provide capabilities required to open, 
establish, and operate an air expeditionary wing (AEW) or air expeditionary group (AEG). 
AEGs are normally formed utilizing the Mission Generation (MG) FE as tenant 
organizations at a USAF, joint, or coalition operating location if the Service/nation 
responsible for providing base operating support can provide sufficient support capabilities 
for the AEG to establish adequate C2 over assigned/allocated forces. 
4.2.6.  Each element is built on capabilities required to accomplish specific processes 
necessary to achieve desired effects. The capabilities contained within each FE are designed 
to work synergistically. Component Headquarters USAF may tailor the capabilities within the 
FE based upon the situation and mission requirements. The FE are all built on basic planning 
assumptions (Attachment 2). These planning assumptions are maintained by AF/A3OD and 
will be reviewed annually. (T-1) 
28 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
4.2.7.  Open the Airbase FE provides the capabilities to open an airbase, regardless of the 
follow- on mission. Open the Airbase forces will normally arrive first and assess the airbase 
for establishment of minimum airfield operating parameters. Airfield seizure or occupation 
will be conducted by other forces from the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, or special operations 
forces (SOFs). 
4.2.7.1.  The Open the Airbase FE provides the initial capabilities for command and 
control, force protection, cargo and passenger handling, logistics, airfield operations, force 
accountability, finance and contracting. In addition, the Open the Airbase also provides 
host-nation support capabilities, reception and beddown of follow-on elements. The Open 
the Airbase FE may support any Service or nation and provides capabilities to transition 
responsibilities to the follow-on forces. 
4.2.7.2.  The capabilities contained within the FE should rapidly establish an Initial 
Operating Capability (IOC) in approximately 24 hours from the arrival of forces. If 
extensive runway preparation is required, then the IOC for this module is approximately 
36 hours. The OPR for the Open the Airbase FE is AMC/A3/10. 
4.2.7.3.  The Open the Airbase FE is designed to operate for up to 60 days. After 60 days, 
Open forces need to be replaced with elements of follow-on FE C2 and Establish the 
Airbase. 
4.2.8.  Command and Control (C2) FE provides the capabilities to establish an air 
expeditionary wing C2 structure to include initial wing, operations, maintenance, mission 
support and     medical group staffs. Additionally, this FE can be tailored to complete the 
appropriate command structure. 
4.2.8.1.  The capabilities contained within the C2 FE should be operational in 
approximately 16 hours from arrival at destination. 
4.2.8.2.  This FE arrives on or after C-0 to assume C2 responsibilities from the Open the 
Airbase. This FE will integrate with the Establish the Air Base (EAB) and Operate the 
Airbase (OAB) FEs upon arrival. (T-1) 
4.2.9.  Establish the Airbase (EAB). FE provides sufficient forces to bring the airbase to IOC 
status within 4 days from arrival. This FE contains capabilities designed to support most 
missions or weapon systems and will integrate with the Open the Airbase and C2 elements. 
This FE will provide the airfield’s earliest capability to execute MG. 
4.2.9.1.  This FE arrives on or after C-0 to assume tasks from the Open the Airbase FE. 
4.2.10.  The Operate the Airbase FE provides combat support and combat service support 
capabilities to enhance force protection, communications, cargo handling, personnel force 
support, medical, and quality of life activities. This module brings the airbase into full 
operating capability. 
4.2.10.1.  The FE is estimated to be operational in approximately 7 days from arrival at 
destination. 
4.2.10.2.  The combination of the OAB and EAB can support up to four MG FEs 
indefinitely. 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
29 
 
4.2.11.  Expeditionary Airbase (XAB). XAB is the GFM-recognized term for the integration 
of the Command and Control (C2), Establish the Airbase (EAB) and Operate the Airbase 
(OAB). 
4.2.12.  MG FEs provide mission specific capabilities which provide direct aviation support, 
combat support, and combat service support. The UTCs are primarily those that are specifically 
identified on the aviation UTC’s mission capability (MISCAP) statement, as well as applicable 
Combat Support (CS)/Combat Service Support (CSS) standard UTCs. AF/A3OD is the OPR 
for the approved MG FE. 
4.2.13.  The MG FE is estimated to be operational in approximately 4 days from arrival at the 
deployed location. However, planners must ensure the flow of the MG FE does not outpace 
the flow of critical support elements in the C2 and EAB FE. (T-1) 
4.2.13.1.  The MG FEs are able to be requested by a JFC and operate independent of an 
XAB. However, when a JFC requests an XAB and one or more MG FE, the MG FE will 
be sourced from the XAB FE to the maximum extent possible. (T-1) 
4.2.13.2.  The Robust the Airbase (RAB) FE provides additional combat support and 
combat service support forces to robust the capabilities already in place from the previous 
elements. This FE contains those support forces that would typically not arrive until 30 
days after an operating location is established. 
4.3.  Guidelines for using and maintaining the AFFORGEN FEs. 
4.3.1.  The AFFORGEN FE are designed to have limited tailoring (removal of entire UTCs or 
portions of a UTC) because they are built to lowest common denominator. If a location already 
has a capability covered or designated to support less than a population of 3,000 personnel, 
then planners will tailor the FE. (T-0) 
4.3.2.  AF/A3OD will establish a schedule for USAF subject matter experts and designated 
USAF force provider lead agencies to periodically review the FE. (T-1) For out-of-cycle 
maintenance due to repackaging of capabilities, or if functional areas determine that certain 
capability is over or understated in the current FE, the USAF FAM and/or designated FE lead 
agency will contact AF/A3OD to propose modification. 
4.3.3.  Demand Force Teams (DFTs). DFTs are additional AFFORGEN capabilities that 
augment the AFFORGEN FE construct. 
4.3.3.1.  DFTs are composed primarily of units or capabilities that operate independently 
and include unique, highly specific combat, combat support or combat service support 
capabilities.  Example DFT capabilities include but are not limited to the Expeditionary 
Medical Support System (EMEDS), RED HORSE, and Tactical Air Control Party (TACP). 
AF/A3 reviews and determines the DFTs for each GFMAP cycle annually, incorporating 
inputs from MAJCOMs and functional area managers. Capabilities are placed into DFTs 
based on the following criteria: 
4.3.3.1.1.  The capacity of DFT capabilities is limited and cannot be distributed across 
the number of postured XABs, or the capability is only resident at very few home 
station locations. 
4.3.3.1.2.  The capability is unique in a way that calls for its employment only in 
circumstances that are not common to most expeditionary airbases. 
30 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
4.3.3.1.3.  The capability is designed to be a theater asset that supports the entire region 
(e.g., AFFOR). 
4.3.3.2.  Prior to the start of each GFM cycle, AF/A3OD will review and validate the 
capabilities designated as EIP and DFTs. (T-1) 
4.3.3.3.  Utilization of DFTs may be considered as a mitigation strategy to sourcing from 
an alternate pool or “reaching deeper;” however, use of DFTs must be approved by 
AF/A3O. (T-1) 
4.4.  Employed-in-Place (EIP).  EIP capabilities are capabilities that perform a specific 
operational mission supporting combatant commands from home station. Forces permanently 
stationed and/or assigned to a combatant command’s area of responsibility (AOR) by the 
applicable FY Forces For assignment tables, which will only be deployed within their assigned 
AOR may also be considered as EIP. 
4.4.1.  EIP forces are those capabilities committed to perform a 24/7 combatant command 
mission. (e.g., Security Force teams securing missile silos, aerial port personnel at en-route 
transportation locations). A unit may have both EIP capabilities and forces available to support 
deployments. 
4.4.2.  The deployable forces will be aligned to Supplemental UTC’s and AFFORGEN phases. 
(T-1)  
4.4.3.  AF/A3OD is the approval authority for units to be designated as EIP. EIP units are 
designated in the DCAPES UTA application with a force category of “employed in-place” and 
assigned Airmen will be given an AEFI of “EP” in MilPDS, only if the entire unit is designated 
EIP. 
4.5.  Organizational Responsibilities. 
4.5.1.  AF/A3OD will: 
4.5.1.1.  Oversee maintenance of the AFFORGEN FE, DFTs, EIP capabilities; adding and 
deleting UTCs as necessary and revising processes to keep pace with current weapon 
systems and employment strategies. (T-1) 
4.5.1.2.  Ensure current and future execution systems are designed and built to 
accommodate Force Modules (FMs). (T-1) 
4.5.1.3.  Manage the list of approved DFTs and EIPs, which is in the UTA module library 
in the USAF’s DCAPES application. (T-1) 
4.5.1.4.  Manage AFFORGEN Support Plan. 
4.5.2.  AF/A4 will provide base support planning expertise in the maintenance of the 
AFFORGEN FE. (T-1) 
4.5.3.  USAF FAMS will: 
4.5.3.1.  Ensure the development of those UTCs necessary to support capabilities-based 
deployment as outlined in AFFORGEN FE. (T-1) 
4.5.3.2.  Maintain and update functional UTCs found within the FE as changes occur. 
4.5.3.3.  Build and manage UTCs consistent with FE policies. (T-1) 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
31 
 
4.5.3.4.  Coordinate any new UTCs developed in support of meeting the AFFORGEN with 
applicable MAJCOM and Reserve Component FAMs. (T-1) 
4.5.4.  Air Component Headquarters will: 
4.5.4.1.  Use AFFORGEN FE and DFT structure as the initial and primary concept for 
TPFDD development, rotational planning, and request for forces. (T-1) 
4.5.4.2.  Ensure component planners include AFFORGEN FE UTC lists into the TPFDD 
elements within the JOPES to support an operation plan, concept plan, or an operations 
order. (T-1) 
4.6.  Operational Organizational Design. 
4.6.1.  The service component commander is the senior USAF warfighter who exercises the 
appropriate degree of control over the forces assigned or attached to the CCDR and is 
designated as the commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR). The COMAFFOR exercises 
administrative Control over all USAF assigned and attached forces and task-organizes forces 
under an AETF. 
4.6.2.  The designated AETF commander may exercise authorities delegated by the air 
component commander or the CCDR through a subordinate JFC. Within the joint force, these 
degrees of control are formally expressed as operational control, tactical control, or support. 
4.6.3.  Within the service chain of command lines, the AETF commander may exercise 
specified elements of administrative control over assigned and attached forces as delegated by 
the Service component commander. 
4.6.4.  The AETF construct provides a task-organized framework and integrates FE with the 
appropriate balance of force, sustainment, control, and force protection. The AETF construct 
may be as small as an air expeditionary group or as large as a numbered expeditionary air force 
consisting of multiple wings. The appropriate organizational construct contains the necessary 
command elements to provide reasonable spans of internal control and to maintain unit 
cohesion. See AFDP 3-30, for details on the AETF construct. 
4.6.5.  If augmentation is needed, or if in-theater forces are not available, the AETF construct 
will likely draw as needed from the available forces currently on a force rotation. These forces, 
whether in-theater or deployed from out of theater, should be fully supported with the requisite 
maintenance, logistical, health services, and administrative elements.

Chapter 5 
FORCE GENERATION 
5.1.  Force Generation Overview.  Force Generation is the military operation that develops and 
provides forces for projection and employment to enable military effects across the operating 
environments. 
5.1.1.  Force employment is enabled by both Force Generation and Force Projection. Force 
Employment is how a military force is used to achieve the desired effects or influence on the 
Operating Environment (e.g., DFE, ACE, rotational or crisis). 
5.1.2.  Force Projection is how a military force is moved from where it is generated to where 
it will be employed. A military force does this by moving its forces from those positions (e.g., 
forward-deployed, staging bases, ports, and installations) it has established to project and 
rapidly employ the forces. 
5.1.3.  Finally, Force Generation is a military force that is created from available resources and 
personnel to be projected and employed. A military force does this by providing the forces it 
has developed according to the military strategies and operational requirements that describe 
and direct the desired military effects and influence in the operating environment. 
5.2.  AFFORGEN Model.  The AFFORGEN model supports the GFM processes as well as 
enabling high-end readiness. The model provides available and ready FEs for force presentation. 
Additionally, AFFORGEN ensures operational forces are properly organized, trained, equipped, 
and ready to respond to emerging crises and sustained operations. Service force providers, in 
coordination with HAF, develop an optimized AFFORGEN schedule to support their operating 
forces. 
5.2.1.  The AFFORGEN model provides clear articulation of what the USAF can provide in 
terms of combat capability, while providing the time and training needed to rebuild readiness 
for the high-end fight. With AFFORGEN, senior leaders will be able to articulate risk-to-force 
if requested to exceed our sustainable force offering. 
5.2.2.  With AFFORGEN, most USAF forces operate within a single battle rhythm. Deviations 
to this battle rhythm must be approved through AF/A3O. 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024

Figure 5.1.  AFFORGEN Phases. 
 
 
5.3.  Phases.  AFFORGEN is a 4-phase model (Figure 5.1) that enables a 1:3 Deploy-to-Dwell 
(D2D) and 1:5 Mobilization-to-Dwell (M2D). Each phase is 6-months within a 24-month cycle. 
The 4-phases are Reset, Prepare, Certify and Available-to-Commit with applicable AFFORGEN 
FE embedded within each phase. 
5.3.1.  D2D ratio for Active Component (AC) is the ratio of time a unit, detachment, or 
individual is deployed to the ratio of time the unit, detachment, or individual is in dwell. M2D 
ratio for Reserve Component is measured IAW DoDI 1235.12, Accessing the Reserve 
Components (RC) as well as the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance 
(GFMIG) and the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG). The mobilization period is calculated 
from the date of mobilization to the date of demobilization. The SecDef's deploy-to-dwell and 
M2D goal and redline are provided in strategic documents such as NDS, NMS, Contingency 
Planning Guidance (CPG), and/or GFMIG. IAW OSD guidance, only the SecDef may waive 
an individual's or unit’s dwell redline. SecDef’s deploy-to-dwell redline for AC is 1:2 or less. 
SecDef’s M2D redline is 1:4 or less. 
5.4.  AFFORGEN Phases. 
5.4.1.  Reset – Accounts for reintegration and reconstitution. Readiness levels for the FE may 
be reduced during this phase to build personnel and hardware resiliency and rebuild 
proficiency. A focus of this phase is to unify and align the unit for the remainder of the 
AFFORGEN cycle. 
5.4.2.  Prepare – Focuses on training toward peak readiness. Single mission and multi mission 
training events and capstone certification exercises are conducted during this phase. 
5.4.3.  Certify – Focuses on certification events to enable deployment during the subsequent 
Available to Commit phase. Unit should sustain peak readiness levels and may be required for 
operation plan (OPLAN) taskings. 
5.4.4.  Available to Commit –Unit is available for rotational operations, DFE, Immediate 
Response Force (IRF), emergent crisis response or residual force deployment.

FORCE MANAGEMENT 
6.1.  AFFORGEN Force Management.  The third component of the AFFORGEN model is force 
management which encompasses aligning the various instances of each AFFORGEN FE across 
the four phases. It is imperative that each phase contains, to the greatest extent possible, equitable 
capacity to ensure consistent support to the Joint community and is the basis for the annual force 
offering for the GFMAP. 
6.1.1.  Mission Generation (MG) Alignment. HAF, in coordination with applicable Service 
force providers, will ensure equitable distribution of force packages for each MG FE. 
Alignment to a specific phase should remain constant and only shift under extreme 
circumstances (e.g., force structure changes, re-alignment driven by surge deployments, etc.). 
6.1.2.  Command and Control and Establish the Airbase (C2/EAB) Alignment. The C2 and 
EAB FE make up the core of an XAB and will predominantly be filled from a single 
installation. This wing will be the primary wing for the XAB. The primary wings are pre-
identified and where practical are aligned in the same phase as one of the MG force packages 
from their installation. 
6.1.3.  Open the Airbase Alignment. Provides capabilities to open an airbase, regardless of 
follow‐on mission. It will arrive first and assess an airbase for establishment of minimum 
airfield operating parameters. It consists of the initial capabilities for command and control 
(C2), force protection, cargo and passenger handling, logistics, airfield operations, force 
accountability, finance and contracting, host nation support, reception, and bed‐down of 
follow‐on forces. 
6.1.4.  Operate the Airbase (OAB) Alignment. Enhances combat support and combat service 
support capabilities beyond what the EAB FE provides and brings an airbase to full operating 
capability. OAB enhances force protection, communications, cargo handling, and quality of 
life activities such as Chaplain Corps, services, health care, and reach‐back capabilities. 
6.1.5.  Robust the Airbase (RAB) Alignment. It supports multiple MG FEs through additive 
capability. This FE is intended to enable the largest scale enduring expeditionary operating 
locations. 
6.2.  Demand Force Team (DFT) Alignment.  DFTs will be distributed across the four phases 
where feasible. However, due to the high demand/low density (HD/LD) nature of many DFTs, 
alignment of these capabilities will be managed on a case-by-case basis and included in the annual 
DFT validation list. Although ARC units perform the missions of DFTs, Title 10 USC statutes and 
SecDef policy must be considered when sourced. 
6.3.  Employed-in-Place (EIP) Alignment.  Validated EIP capabilities will not be aligned to a 
specific phase.  EIP capabilities will be designated in “P” phase to indicate they are employed-in-
place. 
6.4.  Excepted Forces.  Excepted Forces are approved by Director of Current Operations, 
AF/A3O. Excepted Forces are assets that cannot be equally phased in the AFFORGEN 24-month 
rotational cycle with 6-month phases. Amplifying guidance for Excepted Forces can be found in 
the AFFORGEN Support Plan. 
36 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
6.5.  Supplemental UTCs.  Supplemental UTCs are residual capabilities that exceed the standard 
AFFORGEN FE or DFT presentation composition. Supplemental UTCs are to be postured in one 
of the four force presentation phases in the same manner as FE aligned UTCs. 
6.6.  Postured Forces.  Postured forces maintain the capability to rapidly transition from normal 
day-to-day operations to crisis response operations. Operational forces are aligned within FE and 
postured within a sustainable force. The AFFORGEN Employment Force Indicator (AEFI) 
indicates the alignment of FEs to AFFORGEN phases. Force providers determine how their forces 
are aligned within the AFFORGEN model. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and ANG units 
remain in an established cyclic manner consistent with DoD Directive 1200.17, Managing the 
Reserve Components as an Operational Force. 
6.7.  Reserve Component (RC) Alignment.  The RC will align in eight Reserve Component 
periods (RCPs) that enables a 1:7 deploy-to-dwell which supports the SecDef goal of a 1:5 
mobilization-to-dwell. The 8-RCP construct supports AFFORGEN with a 48-month cycle with 
two RCPs associated with a specific phase (MA and NA align with ALPHA phase, MB and NB 
align with BRAVO, MC and NC align with CHARLIE, and MD and ND align with DELTA).  An 
alternate RC construct with eight 3-month deployments is used for RC Mission Generation Force 
Elements (MGFEs). The alternate construct aligns 1A and 2A with ALPHA, 1B and 2B with 
BRAVO, 1C and 2C with CHARLIE, and 1D and 2D with DELTA. 
6.7.1.  Commanders of Active Associate (AA) and Classic Associate (CA) units, in 
coordination with their respective MAJCOMs, will determine which UTCs each unit will 
contribute on a sustainable basis to each MG FE. (T-1) The combination of the UTCs from 
both units will comprise a complete MG FE for each Available to Commit phase. The host 
MAJCOM/A3 will then update the UTA accordingly to reflect the planned composition of 
each MG FE during each available phase. (T-1) 
6.7.1.1.  If a MG FE comprised of UTCs provided by associated units is sourced to fulfill 
a CCDR requirement, the sourcing nomination will include two force tracking number 
(FTN) line numbers, one for the host unit’s contribution and one for the associate unit’s 
contribution. 
6.7.1.2.  The host unit should provide a majority of the UTCs, and the associate unit should 
provide augmentation on a sustainable basis. 
6.7.1.3.  RC CA units may provide UTCs to a MG FE during all or some of AC host unit’s 
Available to Commit phases. 
6.7.1.3.1.  If a RC CA unit provides all of its UTCs to a MG FE, the RC CA unit may 
only provide UTCs during every other AC unit Available to Commit phase in order to 
maintain the SecDef goal of a 1:5 M2D ratio. In this case, all UTCs in the RC CA unit 
would be in the same RCP. Example: The RC CA unit would provide all of its UTCs 
in RCP 1 and no UTCs in RCP 5, and the AC unit would be required to provide all 
UTCs for the MG FE during every other ALPHA Phase. 
6.7.1.3.2.  If a RC CA unit provides some of its UTCs to a MG FE every time the AC 
unit is in the Available to Commit phase, the RC CA unit will alternate the UTCs it 
provides in order to maintain the SecDef goal of a 1:5 M2D ratio for the personnel 
assigned to those UTCs. (T-1) In this case, the UTCs in the RC CA unit would be 
spread across different RCPs to support a designated AC unit Available to Commit 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
37 
 
phase. Example:  A RC CA unit would provide a portion of its UTCs in RCP 1 and a 
portion its UTCs in RCP 5 to provide some UTCs for the MG FE during every ALPHA 
Phase. 
6.8.  Individual Alignment.  All F&IC-1 positions will be aligned against a MG, C2/EAB/OAB, 
RAB, DFT, EIP, or supplemental UTC and aligned to a specific deployment eligibility window. 
Alignment for individual Airmen, to include those against F&IC-2 positions, is outlined in 
Chapter 11.

Chapter 7 
FORCE READINESS 
7.1.  Force Readiness. 
7.1.1.  Force/activity designators (FADs) define the relative importance of a force, unit, 
activity, project, program, or foreign country to accomplish DoD objectives. In an environment 
of scarce supply resources, an organization’s relative priority is critical to its ability to secure 
commodity needs. CJCSI 4110.01F, Joint Materiel Priorities and Allocation, outlines the 
purpose of force/activity designators. DAFPD 10-11, Priorities for Resource Management, 
implements Department of the Air Force policy governing the assignment of FAD ratings for 
prioritization of Department of the Air Force units, activities, projects, and programs. 
7.1.2.  The DoD leverages the reporting of near real-time readiness data based on mission 
assessment and complementary resource information within DRRS for decision-making 
purposes. 
7.1.2.1.  Air Force readiness reporting in the Defense Readiness Reporting System 
Strategic is comprised of several types of reporting to include the following: unit resource 
readiness, unit capability readiness, installation capability readiness, FE readiness, and FE 
availability. 
7.1.2.1.1.  Resource Readiness Assessment. This report measures the effectiveness of 
the Air Force in meeting Title 10 or 32 (as applicable), USC responsibilities to 
organize, train, and equip forces for combatant commands. It is also a measured unit 
commander’s objective assessment of the unit’s ability to provide operational 
equipment and trained personnel to execute the full spectrum mission(s) for which the 
unit was organized. 
7.1.2.1.2.  Capability Readiness Assessment. This report is a commander’s subjective 
assessment of the unit’s ability to accomplish its designed mission essential tasks 
(METs) as required by its core mission, as well as any assigned named operation or 
level IV plan. Commanders must ensure the capability can be accomplished to the 
appropriate level (i.e., capacity). (T-1) For specific readiness reporting information, 
reference AFI 10-201. 
7.1.3.  UTC planning evaluations provide USAF units a mechanism to assess their postured 
UTC’s ability to fulfill its mission capability statement across the full range of military 
operations, to include emergent and rotational operations, and identifying shortfalls/aids in 
resource allocation. 
7.1.3.1.  USAF units at all levels, including Reserve Components, with UTCs postured in 
the UTA are required to assess their UTCs within the first 10 calendar days of every month. 
(T-1) Assessment and approval process is identified in Figure 7.1. Specific instructions 
are codified in the published UTA user guide within DCAPES. Total Force Integration 
(TFI) units are critical to USAF operations that are functionally integrated from Active 
Component, ANG, and AFRC forces. Although the host unit has the ultimate responsibility 
to ensure the assessment is accomplished, each unit in the association (host and associate) 
will independently assess their portion of the UTCs.

7.1.3.2.  AF/A3OD is the OPR for the overall UTC planning evaluation reporting program. 
The OPR may delegate reporting authority to another organization to manage the enterprise 
reporting. 
 
 
40 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
7.1.3.3.  HAF FAMs. The HAF FAM acts as a central coordinator of the actions of their 
MAJCOM, FOA or direct reporting unit (DRU) counterparts to ensure their applicable 
functional area UTCs are being properly assigned to the force presentation construct. HAF 
FAMs must monitor MAJCOM UTC planning evaluation reporting to identify trends and 
elevate UTC shortfalls and deficiencies for resolution to maximize deployable resources. 
(T-1) 
7.1.3.4.  MAJCOM, NAF, wing/base and squadron commanders or equivalents will 
appoint an approver and/or assessor in writing. Designation will include name(s), rank(s), 
unit and Defense Switched Network (DSN) telephone number. (T-1) Continuity and 
consistency in both positions is critical and therefore should be for a minimum of 18 
months. Approvers and assessors will log into their DCAPES account and review UTC 
planning evaluation familiarization within 30 days of appointment. (T-1) 
7.1.3.5.  The commander or civilian equivalent is the authority for reporting the status of a 
unit’s UTC(s). They review unit posturing to ensure that UTC(s) are postured IAW this 
instruction and responsible for associating, tracking, and managing personnel and 
equipment in UTCs. Commanders should consider known issues that impact the UTC (e.g., 
pending retirements/permanent change of station). Specifically, to: 
7.1.3.5.1.  Ensure UTC planning evaluations are accurate, meet the established 
timelines and are complete. 
7.1.3.5.2.  Monitor for late or unreported UTCs on a weekly basis and research/rectify 
incorrectly postured UTCs prior to the next month's reporting cycle. 
7.1.3.5.3.  Review discrepancies noted in previous reports and actions being taken to 
correct them. 
7.1.3.5.4.  Remarks should include known issues that impact the UTC and any 
necessary remarks to properly assess the UTC’s ability to fulfill its MISCAP statement. 
Remarks will not include information that would violate Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Remarks 
that are acceptable but not limited to are deficiency details (e.g., vacant, equip is 
broken, etc.), Duty Availability (DAV) codes, and get-well dates. (T-1) 
7.1.3.6.  Unit Deployment Managers (UDMs).  Unit Deployment Managers provide the 
unit commander the recommended UTC assessment rating of availability line numbers 
(ALNs) within their responsibility. 
7.1.3.6.1.  UDMs will posture personnel assigned to positions within their Unit 
Manpower Document as reflected on the Unit Personnel Manning Roster to Manpower 
Force Element positions within the UTC Assessments module of DCAPES. 
7.1.3.6.2.  UDMs will perform an assessment to meet the postured capability with the 
current available resources assigned to their unit. 
7.1.3.6.3.  Capabilities that do not have the required manpower or equipment to meet 
the UTC’s mission capability statement will mark the ALN with one of the following 
indicators as applicable: 
7.1.3.6.3.1.  Y: Unit can fulfill Mission Capability statement with assigned 
Resources. 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
41 
 
7.1.3.6.3.2.  NP: Unit cannot fulfill Mission Capability statement due to manpower 
or personnel conditions. 
7.1.3.6.3.3.  NE: Unit cannot fulfill mission capability statement due to lack or 
condition of currently assigned personnel. 
7.1.3.6.3.4.  NPE: Unit cannot fulfill mission capability due to manpower and 
logistics conditions. 
7.1.3.6.4.  UDMs will assign personnel to postured Manpower Force Element detail 
within UTA to the max extent and as early as possible within the AFFORGEN cycle.  
Postured personnel assignments will be reviewed during the monthly UTA reporting 
period and updated as necessary to ensure eligible deployers are identified prior to the 
Certify and Available to commit phases. 
7.1.3.7.  AF/A3 has the classification authority to extend or accelerate downgrading of 
DCAPES UTC planning evaluations or DRRS data following an initial determination by 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

Chapter 8 
GLOBAL FORCE MANAGEMENT 
8.1.  Global Force Management.  GFM is a Joint process aligning force assignment, allocation 
and apportionment methodologies in support of the NDS and joint force availability requirements. 
GFM procedures allow proactive, resource and risk informed planning assumptions, estimates and 
execution decision making regarding U.S. military forces. The Global Force Management 
Implementation Guidance and CJCSM 3130.06C, outline the roles and responsibilities for the joint 
force. The AFFORGEN model is the USAF’s methodology of supporting GFM. 
8.2.  Force Assignment.  Force assignment fulfills the military department’s 10 USC § 162 
responsibilities to assign responsibilities to assign specified forces as directed by SecDef to unified 
and specified combatant commands or to the United States element of the North American 
Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to perform missions assigned to those commands. 
8.2.1.  Assigned force demand tracks the use of CCMD assigned forces to conduct operational 
missions within the combatant command area of responsibility within the GFM process. 
8.2.2.  Only the SecDef may transfer operating forces assigned to a functional/geographic 
CCMD, or to the United States element of the NORAD, to another command. This is managed 
by the allocation process. 
8.3.  Allocation.  The GFM allocation process is the Department’s mechanism used to adjust the 
global allocation of forces and to conduct global force strategic planning. Through the Joint Staff-
led GFM processes, the USAF attempts to optimize force readiness for operations against peer 
competitors, fulfill current CCDR requirements, and maintain respective organize, train, and equip 
responsibilities. 
8.3.1.  As part of the annual GFMAP process, the Joint Staff hosts a series of Global Force 
Management Boards (GFMBs). The GFMB is a general/flag officer level body organized by 
the Joint Staff and chaired by the Director, Joint Staff (DJS) to provide senior DoD leadership 
the means to assess the effect of force management decisions and provide guidance for 
planning and execution. 
8.3.1.1.  At the GFMB, AF/A3 provides an assessment of force availability and capacity, 
presents an overview of the USAF AFFORGEN model and applicable fiscal year’s force 
offering, provides the Airman’s perspective on the optimal use of Airpower (e.g., 
leveraging DFE), and outlines risks-to-force for sourcing which exceeds the annual force 
offering. 
8.3.2.  The SecDef’s decision to allocate forces involves weighing the force providers’ risks of 
sourcing (risk-to-force) with operational risks to both current operations (risk-to-mission) and 
potential future contingencies (risk-to-strategy). The SecDef orders force transfers via the 
GFMAP process through the force provider’s chain of command to the unit or individual. The 
force provider conducts deployment planning and documents the TPFDD with deployment and 
movement criteria. 
 
 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
43 
 
8.3.3.  Under current policies, allocated forces may be provided through one of two specific 
global force management allocation supporting processes: Rotational force allocation in 
support of CCDR annual force needs, and emergent force allocation in support of CCDR 
emerging or crisis-based requests for capabilities and forces. 
8.4.  Global Force Management Systems. 
8.4.1.  This chapter provides basic information on Global Force Management information 
technology (IT) systems used by the USAF during deployment planning and execution 
activities. It provides an overview of IT management and administration, including information 
on system access and training. 
8.5.  Functional Communities.  The responsible functional communities for the War Planning 
and Execution Systems that are depicted in this chapter are primarily AF/A3OD - War Planning 
& Policy (Chair), AF/A4LR – Logistics Readiness Division, AF/A1XO – Career Field 
Management and Readiness Division, and AF/A1MR – Requirements Division. 
8.6.  Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES).  JOPES is the DoD directed 
single, integrated joint C2 system for conventional operation planning and execution (to include 
theater-level nuclear and chemical plans). JOPES is supported by a networked suite of Automated 
Data Processing (ADP) applications, tools, and databases, which reside on the Global C2 System 
(GCCS). JOPES ADP systems include the mechanisms to create and maintain TPFDD, and to 
submit CCDR movement requirements to United States Transportation Command 
(USTRANSCOM). 
8.6.1.  JOPES is currently navigating modernization to the Joint Planning and Execution 
Services (JPES) environment which is a browser based joint C2 system used to support military 
operations monitoring for all GFM planning and execution activities. 
8.7.  Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM).  JCRM is a web-enabled tool which 
facilitates GFM policy, processes and tools. JCRM supports automatic requirements generation, 
validation, force presentation, assignment, sourcing, and orders writing processes in both planning 
and execution environments. 
8.7.1.  Key elements of the tool are in direct support of JOPES and complement the Adaptive 
Planning and Execution process. 
8.7.2.  The primary functions of JCRM are to (1) account for forces and capabilities committed 
to ongoing operations and constantly changing unit availability (2) create added value during 
CCDRs decision-making (3) identify the most appropriate and responsive force or capability 
that best meets the CCDR requirement. 
8.8.  Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).  DRRS provides a means to manage and 
report the unit readiness of the DoD and its subordinate components to execute the NMS. 
Enterprise-wide readiness and unit readiness reports enable commanders at multiple levels to use 
quantitative and qualitative analysis to assess risk and inform resource prioritization decisions 
within the corporate structure. For specific readiness reporting information, reference AFI 10-201. 
8.9.  ORION.  ORION is a Joint Staff technology-enabled decision support platform that 
consolidates authoritative data from each of the services, provides global visualization of the forces 
and munitions in motion, and allows course of action (COA) experimentation for users to provide 
validated best military advice to senior-level decision-makers. 
44 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
8.9.1.  ORION’s Joint Force Capability Catalog is a DFE decision support tool that provides 
Capabilities, Readiness, Availability, and Employment/Location (CRAE) data from Service 
and DoD ADS to provide a common view of joint force assignment and allocation. 
8.9.2.  ORION provides a consolidated platform, enabled by intuitive application interfaces 
optimized for efficiency, that allows users to make timely and critical decisions, better informs 
key enterprise stakeholders, and evaluates GFM-specific risks inherited by the allocation and 
assignment of forces across the globe. 
8.10.  Automated GFM Tool (AGT).  Currently, this tool is focused on the DoD’s requirement 
to coordinate and staff the “Forces For” product in support of the GFMIG, Section II. With the 
ability to see the forces (unit to billet) that are assigned and apportioned to CCDRs, and Service 
retained, the planner will be able to make “planning” decisions in the development of their plans. 
In addition, the tool allows the user a view of the DoD Authorized Force Structure through its link 
with the Service Organizational Force Structure Construct (OFSC) servers which will be discussed 
later. 
8.11.  Collaborative Issue Resolution Tool (CIRT).  CIRT is a tool used to adjudicate issues and 
change requests in AGT. Service and CCMD users can request changes, while the Joint Staff 
provides adjudication and confirmation of changes. 
8.12.  Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES).  DCAPES 
is the Air Force’s war planning and execution system that directly interfaces with JOPES via near 
real time automated data exchange services. The objective of DCAPES is to enable improved and 
streamlined operations planning and execution processes which include associated policy and 
procedures, along with organizational and technology improvements. DCAPES provides standard 
data formats, application programs, and management procedures that are USAF unique, joint 
guidance compliant, and used primarily for force planning, sourcing equipment and personnel 
requirements, and transportation feasibility estimation. 
8.12.1.  DCAPES supports all phases of operations planning and execution at the HAF, major 
command, component, and wing/squadron level. It provides data manipulation capability to 
USAF planners to perform mobilization, deployment, sustainment, redeployment, 
demobilization, reconstitution, and accounting of forces. 
8.12.2.  DCAPES is CJCSM 3150.16G (JOPESREP (located on the SIPRNET)) compliant and 
supports JOPES by establishing a standard USAF support system for joint operation planning 
and execution. DCAPES and JOPES share common business rules and automated data 
exchange processes and policies to plan and execute joint military operations. USAF planners 
at all levels will use DCAPES to support the CCDRs selected COA in a timely manner. 
DCAPES supports sourcing and tailoring of lower levels of detail beyond the JOPES level of 
detail. 
8.13.  JOPES Sub Functional Managers.  MAJCOM, component Headquarters USAF, and 
Reserve Component will designate no more than three JOPES Sub Functional Managers (Sub-
FM)/DCAPES super user to manage allocated "08" series Plan IDs (PIDs) and respective user 
accounts. (T-1) 
 
 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024

8.14.  Air Force/Space Force Organizational Server (AFOS/SFOS).  As part of the initial task 
to support the Joint Staff led effort, GFM-DI and IAW DoDI 8260.03, each Service, OSD, JS and 
Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) was tasked to develop a capability to 
document their OFSC. 
8.14.1.  The AFOS/SFOS documents electronically the force structure authorization data 
(consistent with and as limited by law, policy, or security classification) and implement 
procedures to publish hierarchical relationships and force management identifiers (FMIDS) 
assignments in the Global Force Management Information Exchange Data Model 
(GFMIEDM) format. 
8.14.2.  The AFOS/SFOS stores and maintains force structure authorization data in 
organization servers. 
8.14.3.  The AFOS/SFOS Program Manager will: 
8.14.3.1.  Develop and implement a process for assigning FMIDS to all GFMIEDM data 
within the organization server (OS). (T-1) 
8.14.3.2.  Make the organization server data visible, so that authorized users and 
applications can discover the existence of this data through search services. (T-1) 
8.14.3.3.  Allow read-only access to the organization server. Access rules will follow 
DoD/Chief, Information Office (CIO) Network Core Enterprise Services implementation. 
(T-1) 
8.14.3.4.  Ensure only force structure data authorized under this instruction is used for any 
force structure representation in other automated systems. (T-1) 
8.14.3.5.  Apply the OFSC to identify doctrinal, crew and billet organizations and 
associated authorization data for materiel and manpower. (T-1) 
8.14.3.6.  Maintain a separate organizational server for classified and unclassified 
environments. All data within the unclassified OS will be replicated in the classified OS.

CCDR REQUIREMENTS/SOURCING 
Section 9A—Contingency Planning 
9.1.  Contingency Planning. 
9.1.1.  Contingency sourcing supports development and assessment phases of planning in three 
general categories: Combatant command requests to support plan development/refinement, 
CJCS-directed exercises with contingency sourcing requirements, and    Joint Combat 
Capability Assessment Plan Assessments (JCCA-PA). Contingency sourced forces are specific 
forces that meet the planning requirement at a specified point in time identified by the JFC in 
coordination with the Services and by the JFPs in coordination with their assigned Service 
components. 
9.1.2.  The JS/J5, Strategy, Plans and Policy provides specific guidance through a list of 
sourcing assumptions and planning factors contained in the contingency sourcing message. 
JS/J35, Regional Operations as the Joint Force Coordinator (JFC), is responsible for 
developing conventional sourcing solutions IAW the Services and consolidated with the 
sourcing solutions provided by the SOF and Mobility Forces JFPs. 
9.1.3.  Global Force Management Board (GFMB). The GFMB reviews and approves 
contingency sourcing efforts and is the arbiter of all sourcing requests. The GFMB also 
endorses the schedule and the SecDef orders the JFPs to contingency source specific plans per 
the schedule. CCDRs may request contingency sourcing of specific plans. These requests are 
evaluated by the JS/J5, and a contingency sourcing schedule is presented to the GFMB. 
9.2.  Contingency Plans. 
9.2.1.  Contingency plans are developed in anticipation of a potential crisis. There are four 
levels of planning detail for contingency plans, with an associated planning product for each 
level. 
9.2.1.1.  Level 1 Planning Detail— Commander’s Estimate. This level of planning has the 
least detail. It produces multiple COAs to address contingencies. The product for this level 
can be a COA briefing, command directive, commander’s estimate, or a memorandum with 
a proposed force list. The commander’s estimate provides SecDef with military COAs to 
meet a potential contingency. The estimate reflects the commander’s analysis of the various 
COAs and recommends a COA. 
9.2.1.2.  Level 2 Planning Detail—Base Plan (BPLAN). A BPLAN describes the Concept 
of Operations (CONOPS), major forces, concepts of support, and anticipated timelines for 
completing the mission. It normally does not include annexes. A BPLAN may contain 
alternatives, including Flexible Deterrent Options and Flexible Response Options, to 
provide multiple options to address contingencies as they develop or to shape the 
developing situation. 
 
 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024

9.2.1.3.  Level 3 Planning Detail—Concept Plan (CONPLAN). A CONPLAN is an 
OPLAN in an abbreviated format. It may require considerable expansion or alteration to 
be converted into a complete and detailed level 4 OPLAN or an OPORD. It includes a plan 
summary; a BPLAN; and usually includes the following annexes: A (Task Organization), 
B (Intelligence), C (Operations), D (Logistics), J (Command Relationships), K (Command, 
Control, Communications, and Computer Systems), S (Special Technical Operations), V 
(Interagency-Interorganizational Coordination), and Z (Distribution). If the development 
of time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) is directed for the CONPLAN, the 
planning level is designated as 3T and requires consideration of intelligence community 
assessed contested environment impacts on deployment and distribution operations. A 
combatant command may request a national intelligence support plan (NISP) be developed 
for level 3T contingency plans. A troop list and TPFDD also require an annex E (Personnel) 
and annex W (Operational Contract Support). 
9.2.1.4.  Level 4 Planning Detail—OPLAN. An OPLAN is a complete and detailed plan. 
The OPLAN identifies the force requirements, functional support, and resources to execute 
the plan. It contains a full description of the CONOPS, all applicable annexes, a time-
phased force and deployment list (TPFDL) and a transportation-feasible notional TPFDD, 
as well as analysis of the impact of a potentially contested environment on the joint 
deployment and distribution enterprise (JDDE). A TPFDD phases unit requirements into 
the theater of operations to support the CONOPS and provide closure estimates. A CCMD 
may request a NISP be developed for level 4 OPLANS. 
9.2.2.  Combatant command planners use the preferred forces process as part of the planning 
assumption necessary to continue planning efforts and assess the feasibility of a plan. The 
number of identified preferred forces should be within the apportioned force quantity. 
Preferred forces are planning assumptions only and do not indicate the specific forces are 
available for contingency or execution sourcing. The operational feasibility of the plan 
improves by using accurate planning assumptions when identifying preferred forces for 
mission execution. 
9.2.3.  The contingency sourcing process uses specific planning assumptions and is a part of 
the plan assessment process. JFC/JFPs use the contingency sourcing process to identify forces 
at a specified point in time to support the CCDRs planning requirements. The sourced plans 
provide a snapshot of the associated forces and transportation feasibility to inform senior 
leadership decisions. 
9.2.3.1.  There are two contingency sourcing options for a plan assessment. The option 
used during contingency sourcing is largely dependent on the level of planning detail. 
Contingency Sourcing Options A and B provide different levels of fidelity. JIA 
requirements are not contingency sourced in either Option A or B. Results of Option A and 
B are normally provided inputs for transportation feasibility assessment. 
9.2.4.  AFFORGEN FEs are created in the UTA module of DCAPES application to support 
MCOs for both planning and execution activities. The FE is also populated in the Joint 
apportionment and assignment applications that assist in the development of CCMD 
OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDD. 
 
 
48 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
9.2.5.  To ensure successful implementation of the AFFORGEN model, Air Force components 
will initiate the transformation of current USAF requirements in their respective CCMD 
TPFDDs. (T-1) This activity will take place starting in FY23 when the Joint Staff and their 
CCMD schedule TPFDD maintenance events occur. (T-1) 
9.2.6.  To ensure successful implementation of AFFORGEN, Air Force components will 
initiate the transformation of current requirements in their respective TPFDDs to standard 
UTCs identified within FEs (MG, XAB, and DFTs). (T-1) 
9.2.6.1.  Option “A” sourcing includes “above the line” unit availability and readiness. 
Above the line forces are major combat power units (squadron) apportioned for planning 
in the GFMIG. Option “A” sourcing may also include an assessment of critical support 
forces identified as part of the contingency sourcing message. Option “A” sourcing will 
reflect substitutions for above the line forces, impact on limited supply/high demand assets, 
a transportation feasibility estimate and Reserve Component implications. 
9.2.6.2.  Option “B” sourcing results in a fully sourced TPFDD containing Type Unit 
Characteristics (TUCHA) data. It includes substitutions and mitigation factors and includes 
a full transportation feasibility estimate. Option “B” sourcing is conducted at a lower-level 
of fidelity than execution level sourcing (i.e., sourcing is not identified below UTC level) 
and does not result in notification to units or placement of units in a prepare-to-deploy 
status. Option “B” contingency sourcing represents a “snapshot in time” of readiness and 
availability to assess feasibility and risk for senior leadership, eases the transition to 
execution sourcing during a crisis, provides near execution-level fidelity (human in the 
loop) and gives critical feedback to combatant command planners. 
9.2.7.  Types of Force Sourcing. CJCSM 3130.06C identifies three types of force and           
capability sourcing: preferred force sourcing, contingency sourcing, and execution sourcing. 
Note: Only contingency sourcing is used within the JCCA-PA structure. In some cases, 
combatant commands may use their execution sourcing data (EXORD forces) in TPFDD 
development. 
9.2.7.1.  Contingency Sourced Forces (plan assessment). Usually begun during the plan 
assessment stage of deliberate planning, the CJCS may direct the JFPs to contingency 
source a plan. Contingency sourced forces are specific forces identified by actual unit name 
and unit identification code (UIC) by the JFPs, assisted by their Service components and 
parent Services that meet the planning requirement at a specified point in time. Because 
these forces are identified based on planning assumptions and planning guidance provided 
for the sourcing effort, the forces sourced via contingency sourcing may not be the actual 
forces sourced during execution sourcing. 
9.2.7.1.1.  The CCDRs propose plans to be contingency sourced to Joint Staff 
(normally top-priority plans). Joint Staff recommends a schedule to contingency source 
selected plans for the GFMB to endorse and the CJCS to direct contingency sourcing 
efforts. 
 
 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
49 
 
9.2.7.1.2.  The frequency of contingency sourcing actions is, in part, dependent on the 
capacity of the JFPs and their assigned Service components. The Joint Staff provides 
specific guidance through a list of sourcing assumptions and planning factors contained 
in the contingency sourcing message or memorandum and other business rules agreed 
upon by the Joint Staff, the JFPs, supported CCDRs and the Services. 
9.2.7.1.3.  The JFPs have final approval of the total sourcing solution and provide the 
approved solution back to the supported CCMD in the CCDRs requested format. In 
contingency sourcing, the JFP approves the sourcing solutions. 
9.2.7.2.  Execution Sourced Forces (allocation). Specific forces recommended and 
identified by JFPs, assisted by their Service components (who are responsible to coordinate 
with their Services, as required). 
9.2.7.2.1.  The recommended sourcing solution is reviewed through the GFM 
allocation process. The Joint Staff will provide specific guidance for the selection of 
forces in the execution sourcing message, to include JOPES procedures for unit 
reporting. (T-0) 
9.2.7.2.2.  Execution sourcing of forces may result in a Prepare to Deploy Order 
(PTDO), deployment order (DEPORD) or execution order (EXORD). 
9.2.7.2.3.  The GFMAP is a consolidated deployment order and more details on this 
type of sourcing can be found in CJCSM 3130.06C, Annex C of the GFMIG (located 
on the SIPRNET), and this instruction. 
9.3.  Plan identification/TPFDD Actions. 
9.3.1.  For deliberate planning, the Joint Strategic Campaign Plan (JSCP) identifies the plan 
identification (PID) associated with a specific operation. The TPFDD will correlate to this PID 
and the written plan. (T-0) Variations of the master TPFDD (e.g., USAF-only requirements) 
may be in separate TPFDDs known as a Service slice. 
9.3.2.  The goal is 100 percent sourcing. JFPs will identify each force or capability by UIC via 
UTC. Each UIC will be accompanied by level 4 TUCHA data. (T-1) 
9.3.3.  Sourcing and Apportionment. Apportioned forces represent capabilities provided to 
CCDRs for planning purposes. Although apportioned forces are considered “available forces 
for planning,” CCDRs must refer to the current GFMAP and all available readiness data to 
make a “best” assessment of what forces can reasonably be assessed to meet CCDRs 
requirements for a contingency. (T-1) Apportioned forces sourced during contingency 
sourcing conferences, however, are not tied to any plan and may not be the actual forces which 
would be allocated when a contingency plan transitions to execution. 
9.3.4.  The CPG and JSCP provides functional CCDRs and Services with global prioritization 
guidance for resources. Global Combatant Commanders will find resourcing priorities in the 
regional guidance section of the Guidance for Employment of the Force (GEF). Development 
of campaign plans should be informed by this allocation and resourcing guidance and 
associated processing, exploitation, and dissemination. 
9.3.5.  GFM is supported by the contingency sourcing process, which will inform senior 
leaders about risk to the execution of selected plans and to the NDS. 
50 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
9.3.6.  Resource-Informed Planning. The concept of resource-informed planning requires the 
development of plans based on the near-term availability and readiness of the force (combat, 
CS, and CSS), the capacity and capability of the logistics and transportation systems, preferred 
munitions availability, identification and consideration of leveraging non-DoD capabilities and 
the level of commercial support required and available to offset the known shortfall or provide 
redundancy for a military capability. Commanders should produce a “fight tonight” plan based 
on resources that could reasonably be made available as articulated in the GFMIG 
apportionment tables, current or expedient contracted capabilities, and the JSCP Logistics 
Annex. 
9.3.7.  Sourcing Shortfalls. The Services must support the war planning community through a 
contingency sourcing process and accurate planning efforts by identifying shortfalls in 
resources and readiness. (T-0) The lack of forces, equipment, personnel, materiel, or capability 
reflected as the difference between the resources identified as a plan requirement [or Service 
asset] and those apportioned to a CCMD [or assigned to the Service] for planning will 
adversely affect the command’s ability to accomplish its mission. 
9.3.7.1.  Where combat, CS, and CSS forces availability are insufficient or unavailable to 
meet combatant command plan requirements, USAF planners must ensure all OPLAN 
UTCs are properly postured in UTA, ordered in systems of record (Expeditionary Supply 
System) with the consideration given to alternatives accounting for the increased risk to 
the support shortfalls.  (T-1) Current events add the lesson that the ability to adapt forces 
quickly is the best strategy for planning and managing uncertainty. 
9.3.7.2.  Commanders must ensure that forces not only can conduct the operations they 
regularly plan for, such as those comprising the NMS, but they must also respond to severe 
and unanticipated crises. (T-1) 
9.3.8.  DRRS contains applications that support contingency sourcing. These provide planners 
a nascent ability to find forces and manpower to meet CCDR-specified requirements or plans. 
Units are considered mission ready when the commander assesses the unit is able to perform 
its assigned mission-essential tasks to prescribed performance standards under specified 
conditions. 
9.4.  Contingency Sourcing Process. 
9.4.1.  The complete contingency sourcing process is governed by the appendices to enclosure 
J of CJCSM 3130.06C. For this instruction, the process is defined in four phases, combatant 
command contingency sourcing request and GFMB approval development of the contingency 
sourcing guidance message, TPFDD refinement, and contingency sourcing. 
9.4.1.1.  Combatant command contingency sourcing request. This phase begins when a 
combatant command submits a request to have one of their plans contingency sourced and 
includes the primary purpose (e.g., plan refinement or JCCA-PA). The Joint Staff develops 
a draft schedule on a quarterly basis and coordinates with the Services, JFC, and JFPs. 
 
 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
51 
 
9.4.1.2.  Contingency Sourcing Guidance Message. HAF will staff the TPFDD with ACC 
for conventional forces, AFSOC for special operations forces (SOF), and AMC for 
mobility forces. (T-1) ACC will obtain input from AFPC before responding. (T-1) AFSOC 
and AMC may also be tasked to respond through their respective JFPs. Once the Joint Staff 
has obtained coordination with the Services, JFC, and JFPs, they will coordinate schedule 
approval first through the Joint Combat Capability Assessment Group (JCCAG) and then 
through the GFMB. (T-0) 
9.4.1.2.1.  The JS/J5 issues a guidance message for each contingency sourcing event 
that specifies the purpose of the contingency sourcing event (e.g., to support a JCCA-
PA, an adaptive planning force flow conference, to support a CCDRs plan development 
and refinement). The guidance message provides sourcing assumptions, sourcing 
priorities, direction for TPFDD development and release, identifies deliverables and 
timelines and assigns tasks to specific commands. The JFC issues an additional 
message that provides presentation formats for submitting the sourcing solution. For 
conventional forces, ACC will use this message as a baseline to develop more specific 
USAF guidance, deliverable format, and timelines for AFPC to accomplish combat 
support sourcing, if required. (T-1) 
9.4.2.  TPFDD Refinement. Prior to the contingency sourcing process, the supported CCMD 
builds or refines the operation’s TPFDD for use during the contingency sourcing event. 
9.4.2.1.  The supported air component command ensures the accuracy of relevant data such 
as ULN, UTC, CCDR Required Delivery Date (CRD), Required Delivery Date (RDD), 
Port of Debarkation (POD), and destination to facilitate sourcing by the force providers. 
The air component will also review readiness and accuracy of all assigned or currently 
allocated forces requirements spread throughout the Reset, Prepare, and Certify phases of 
the AFFORGEN cycle. included in the TPFDD. Data on assigned forces that are not 
available, or not certified, will be, will be removed from the TPFDD. Likewise, data on 
unassigned, unallocated, or Service-retained forces will be removed from the TPFDD so 
that the FP will have a “clean” PID from which to begin sourcing. (T-1) 
9.4.2.2.  The JS/J5 with inputs from Joint Staff, JFP/JFCs, CCMDs and Services drafts the 
contingency guidance Message, provides contingency sourcing assumptions, guidance and 
direction for notional TPFDD development. The message identifies deliverables, timelines, 
and assigns tasks to specific commands. The message specifies the purpose of the 
contingency sourcing event. 
9.4.2.2.1.  Once the TPFDD is released for contingency sourcing, CCMD changes to 
requirements are not authorized unless coordinated with the relevant force provider and 
approved by the Joint Staff. 
9.4.2.3.  The air component will also review the TPFDD for equipment and materiel that 
could potentially be sourced via the commercial marketplace thereby reducing reliance on 
organic support options and freeing up strategic lift. (T-1) 
9.4.3.  Contingency Sourcing. The goal of a contingency sourcing solution is to develop the 
most ready, relevant, and available forces based on the sourcing guidance and assumptions 
provided in the Joint Staff guidance message. 
52 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
9.4.4.  Readiness. A readiness date is established in the JS/J5 Guidance Message, and this 
normally coincides with the established C-Day. The JS/J5 Guidance Message also establishes 
minimum readiness ratings. Normally, this is C-3 or above. When a C-3 unit is used, the FP 
must identify the reason for the degradation and any mitigation. When considering a C-3 unit, 
the unit’s overall assessment for capability readiness should be a “Qualified Yes.” Sourcing of 
a C-3 unit does NOT require preapproval or concurrence of the supported CCMD. The 
sourcing of units with a C-4 rating is discouraged but an FP can recommend using a C-4 unit 
if that unit can accomplish the mission to which it will be assigned or that mitigation options 
are available to improve a unit’s readiness before deployment. (T-1) All sourcing of C-4 units 
is subject to preapproval by the supported combatant command but failure to approve use of a 
C-4 unit may result in a sourcing shortfall. 
9.4.5.  Non-Standard or Outdated Requirements. USAF sourcing agencies will not be expected 
to routinely source non-standard requirements or outdated UTCs as part of a contingency 
sourcing event. However, Service force providers should review any non-standard or outdated 
UTCs and provide any recommended changes or substitutions to improve future CCMD 
planning. Sourcing agencies may also recommend options for any shortfalls to the CCMD. 
9.4.6.  TPFDD Update. USAF sourcing agencies will update the TPFDD with the UIC, unit 
name, and Available to Load Date for all contingency sourced units. (T-1) 
9.4.7.  Risk Assessment. The designated JFP will, in coordination with USAF sourcing 
agencies, include a force provider risk assessment as part of their contingency sourcing 
solution. This risk assessment will consider five categories: dwell time, unit readiness, 
organizational suitability and deployment timeline, current resource availability, and capability 
sustainment. Each category will be rated as low, moderate, significant, or high with specific 
rationale for anything above low. (T-1) 
9.4.8.  Sourcing Summary. USAF sourcing agencies will provide their final sourcing solution 
and risk assessment IAW the formats and timelines identified in the JFC/JFP and ACC/A3O 
guidance message. (T-1) 
9.4.9.  Shortfall Mitigation. All forces and capabilities that cannot be sourced will be reported 
to the Joint Staff. (T-0) The Joint Staff may coordinate a virtual contingency sourcing secure 
video teleconference (SVTC) with each force provider to address and resolve the shortfalls and 
develop a mitigation strategy. One example of a shortfall mitigation strategy is the sourcing of 
a unit with a C-4 or worse readiness rating. A JFC/JFP may recommend to the supported CCDR 
a unit with a readiness of C-4 if that unit can accomplish the CCDR’s mission, can quickly be 
modified for the CCDR’s mission, or can quickly be modified to C-2 or better prior to the 
Ready to Load date (RLD) in the TPFDD. 
9.4.10.  JFC/JFP Information Brief. A contingency sourcing event normally concludes with a 
JFC/JFP information brief to the JCCAG and the supported CCDR prior to final submission to 
the JS/J5. At a minimum, the JFC/JFP information brief contains the approving authority of 
the force requirements, CCMD assigned forces, PTDO forces, forces sourced (filled) against 
the requirements, the readiness levels of the contingency sourced forces, shortfalls and the 
reason for the shortfall, actions taken to mitigate shortfalls, and the JFC/JFP’s sourcing risk. If 
a particular contingency sourcing event is to become a JCCA-PA, then the results of JFC/JFP 
information brief will be embedded into the overall CCMD JCCA-PA brief. 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
53 
 
9.5.  Responsibilities. 
9.5.1.  Air Component Headquarters. C-MAJCOMs and C-NAFs will make the USAF portion 
of their respective combatant command OPLAN TPFDD available to HAF, USAF force 
provider, AFPC Requirements Managers and sourcing agencies in support of contingency 
sourcing events. (T-1) 
9.5.1.1.  Component Headquarters USAF planners will first use the assigned forces when 
building OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDDs. (T-1) Therefore, the requirements determination 
and sourcing of aviation combat forces are accomplished concurrently. When conducting 
contingency sourcing, replacement units will be identified for those units deployed in 
support of other contingencies. (T-1) Other MG forces available for planning are listed in 
GFMIG apportionment tables and Service documents. 
9.5.1.2.  Coordinate identification of operational requirements, commercial sourcing 
options, and functional responsibilities for contract support integration and contractor 
management with the A4 and/or the Senior Contracting Official (SCO) at the Air Force 
Installation Contracting Center (AFICC) operating location (OL) aligned to the C-
MAJCOM/C-NAF to include readiness reporting. 
9.5.1.3.  Build CS requirements utilizing the AFFORGEN FE to determine the mix of 
UTCs required at each destination. 
9.5.2.  HAF Responsibilities. HAF will: 
9.5.2.1.  Provide oversight and strategic guidance in support of the contingency sourcing 
process through adaptive planning. (T-1) 
9.5.2.2.  Consider location, availability, and mission readiness assessments when 
contingency sourcing to evaluate whether sufficient forces are available to meet the stated 
requirements of a plan. (T-1) 
9.5.2.3.  Responsibilities of AF/A3OD. 
9.5.2.3.1.  AF/A3OD will ensure that the UTA is current and updated. (T-1) 
9.5.2.3.2.  Provide oversight of contingency sourcing actions. (T-1) 
9.5.3.  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Responsibilities. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs will: 
9.5.3.1.  ACC, when directed by the HAF, will contingency source conventional aviation 
and associated direct aviation support, plus command-and-control elements for designated 
plans and identify shortfalls, capability substitutions IAW sourcing guidance and policy 
issues and determine institutional/joint force risks associated with filling shortfalls. ACC 
will consider location, availability and readiness when contingency sourcing to evaluate 
whether sufficient forces are available to meet the stated requirements of a plan. (T-1) 
9.5.3.2.  AFSOC, when directed by USSOCOM as the SOF JFP, will contingency source 
Special Operations Forces for designated plans and identify shortfalls, capability 
substitutions IAW sourcing guidance and policy issues and determine institutional/joint 
force risks associated with filling shortfalls. (T-1) 
 
 
54 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
9.5.3.3.  AMC, when directed by USTRANSCOM as the mobility forces JFP, will 
contingency source mobility forces for designated plans and identify shortfalls, capability 
substitutions IAW sourcing guidance and policy issues and determine institutional/joint 
force risks associated with filling shortfalls. (T-0) AMC will take into account location, 
availability and readiness when contingency sourcing to evaluate whether sufficient forces 
are available to meet the stated requirements of a plan. (T-1) 
9.5.3.4.  AFPC, in coordination with the applicable Service force provider, will 
contingency source conventional support forces from the postured available capability 
contained within Unit Type Code Availability, for designated plans and identify shortfalls, 
capability substitutions IAW sourcing guidance and policy issues and determine 
institutional/joint force risks associated with filling shortfalls. AFPC will consider location, 
availability, and readiness when contingency sourcing to evaluate whether sufficient forces 
are available to meet the stated requirements of a plan. (T-2) 
9.5.3.5.  C-MAJCOMs/C-NAFs, when directed by their respective CCDR, will 
contingency source aviation and associated direct aviation support, plus command-and-
control elements for designated plans and identify shortfalls, capability substitutions IAW 
sourcing guidance and policy issues and determine institutional/joint force risks associated 
with filling shortfalls. Will consider location, availability, and readiness when contingency 
sourcing to evaluate whether sufficient forces are available to meet the stated requirements 
of a plan. (T-2). 
9.5.4.  The Joint Staff provides specific guidance for the selection of forces, to include unit-
reporting requirements, in the execution-sourcing message. Execution sourced forces are 
considered allocated forces and are unavailable for use in other plans/operations unless 
reallocated by the SecDef. 
9.5.4.1.  The JFC uses the joint requirements code in JCRM aggregate operational 
capabilities in order to identify and staff global joint sourcing solutions. Although the joint 
requirements codes are like the USAF functional area codes, there is not a direct one-to-
one correlation. The joint requirements codes provide combatant command planners, the 
Joint Staff, and the JFC/JFP the ability to easily track aggregated sourcing information on 
functional requirements. 
9.5.4.2.  CCDRs report the requirements for their assigned force in the JCRM and assign 
each requirement a force tracking number, just as they would when requesting a force to 
be allocated in either the annual or emergent process. Although these are not captured in 
the GFMAP, this provides visibility of the operational force demand, and assists with 
evaluating risk in the allocation decisions. Force tracking numbers improve the sourcing 
and tracking of the request for forces and rotational force requirements throughout the 
deployment process and enhances force-closure reporting. 
9.5.4.3.  During execution, the CCDR tasks their assigned forces first. These operational 
requirements constitute the assigned force demand. If additional forces are required, the 
supported CCDR requests those forces through the global force management allocation 
process for consideration by the SecDef. 
 
 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
55 
 
9.5.5.  Postured operational forces are required to maintain the capability to rapidly transition 
from normal day-to-day operations to crisis response operations. A unit’s AFFORGEN posture 
will increase based on the issuance and receipt of a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs warning, 
planning, alert, deployment order, and/or prepare to deploy order. Note: AFRC and ANG units 
will not be postured in a “prepare to deploy” status unless activated. (T-1) 
9.5.6.  AF/A3OD is responsible for coordinating sourcing feasibility solutions with the 
appropriate Headquarters USAF FAM. 
9.5.6.1.  The HAF FAMs are required to review active joint individual augmentee 
requirements for accuracy and resubmit sourcing feasibilities to AF/A3OD during the 
GFMAP fiscal year requirements review. During the annual global force management 
sourcing process, the Headquarters USAF FAMs will work with the component staffs and 
AFPC to correct any inconsistencies. (T-1) 
9.5.7.  Service component planners will use standard tailored UTCs to the maximum extent 
possible for combatant command JIA requirements. Requested capabilities that do not fit 
within the scope of a standard UTC, the component planner will utilize non-standard (**Z99) 
UTCs. (T-1) 
9.5.8.  The supported component planners are required to use the Air Expeditionary Task Force 
Force Modules to identify operational forces. (T-1) 
9.5.9.  Force sourcing is the identification of the FEs, the UTCs comprising the FE, and 
movement characteristics, to include their point of origin and ports of embarkation, to satisfy 
the time-phased force movement requirements of a supported commander. 
9.5.10.  The baseline estimated tour length for deployments is six months. The Air Force 
recognizes there may be circumstances when extended estimated tour lengths are warranted. 
However, such tour lengths deviate from the operational force employment policy and must 
be approved by the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations (AF/A3). (T-1) Requests to extend 
and/or generate “key and critical” positions beyond 6-month tour lengths must meet one or 
more of the following criteria for approval: 
9.5.10.1.  Positions requiring extensive host nation and/or local populace interaction. 
Members who maintain direct and continuous daily contact with national and/or local 
populace organizations in order to support, be located on, operate in, or transit through its 
territory based on government invitation and/or national agreements. 
9.5.10.2.  Positions requiring critical continuity to coalition and/or joint operations. 
Members maintaining direct, regular, timely, and collaborative working relationships 
between civilian and/or military coalition/joint forces. 
9.5.11.  Extended Tour Lengths of 365 days or more are filled by AFPC using sourcing 
procedures governed by DAFI 36-2110, Total Force Assignments. 
9.5.12.  Only the Secretary of Defense may authorize involuntary extension of personnel 
greater than 30 days. Only the Secretary of Defense may involuntarily authorize or extend a 
unit or individual operational deployment beyond 365 days. 
 
 
56 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
9.5.13.  MAJCOMs may not exceed AFSC skill-level substitutions (two up / one down) or 
grade substitutions (one up / one down) when UMD-to-UTC mismatches exist, and 
substitutions are not prohibited by the MISCAP or applicable FAM guidance (i.e., grade field 
of Allocation Tool Suite). (T-0) 
Section 9B—Rotational Planning 
9.6.  Force Rotation. 
9.6.1.  The Chief of Staff of the Air Force, through the AF/A3, is responsible for the force 
rotation management policy to support CCDR rotational requirements.  Air Force rotational 
force planning supports the global force management requirement for an executable and 
sustainable global force management schedule. 
9.6.2.  The AF/A3 is responsible for organizing all operating forces within a force management 
construct to meet global CCDR requirements. The force management construct provides 
operating forces on a predictable and sustainable basis. Using operational forces to meet non-
CCDR requirements reduces the Air Force’s ability to meet the global operational/contingency 
requirements. 
9.6.2.1.  The planned operational requirements are those force requirements needed to 
satisfy the concurrent threats specified in the designated operational plans. A FE, composed 
of multiple UTCs, is the operational capability assigned to the force tracking number within 
the JCRM. 
9.6.2.2.  Component staffs submit rotational requirements annually through their CCDRs 
as part of the global force management rotational process. The Air Force uses the GFMAP 
and the Air Force deployment execution orders to task and deploy forces during each force 
rotation. 
9.6.2.3.  Service component staffs and the AFPC requirements managers build and 
maintain JOPES/DCAPES TPFDD force elements to source CCDR requirements. Force 
coordinators will coordinate TPFDD FE changes not specified in the JCRM process with 
combatant commander component staffs. (T-1) 
9.6.2.4.  The component staffs continually review the rotational requirements with the goal 
of meeting the CCDRs mission requirements. The force requirement evaluation takes place 
throughout the rotation cycle. Component staffs revalidate requirements as part of the 
official GFMAP process and identify requirements necessitating sustained rotational 
sourcing support to AFPC requirements managers and AF/A3OD. 
9.6.2.5.  The deployed commander will evaluate the impact and notify the component 
Headquarters USAF of needed changes when there is a change to the deployed unit’s 
mission, equipment, weapons systems, operating location, or a reduction in forces. (T-1) 
9.7.  Force Scheduling Timeline and Force Alignment. 
9.7.1.  To facilitate the development of the annual GFMAP, Joint Staff will release an annual 
GFMAP planning order (PLANORD) providing specific milestones to the overall tasks 
outlined in CJCSM 3130.06C. AF/A3O then publishes specific milestones for USAF 
organizations to support the annual global force management timelines. 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
57 
 
9.7.2.  AF/A3O specific actions include, but are not limited to reviewing the alignment of 
postured forces as part of the preparatory actions for every global force management cycle. 
(T-1) 
9.7.3.  The component staffs correct changes to the TPFDD elements based on the JCRM 
requirements. Any change affecting the JCRM requirements requires a GFM FTN change 
request. 
9.7.4.  AF/A3OD monitors the global force management planning tasks for the upcoming force 
rotation schedule to ensure the efficient and timely execution of the force management battle 
rhythm. Component staff planners, Headquarters USAF FAMs, sourcing agencies, Service 
force providers, and force providers, are required to complete their actions IAW the published 
timelines. 
9.7.4.1.  The scheduling process accommodates the Air Reserve Component notification, 
prioritization, and mobilization timelines IAW AFI 10-402, Mobilization Planning and 
AFI 10-301. 
9.7.4.2.  Provides supported component staffs with sufficient time to provide operational 
risk assessments to the CCDRs mission. 
9.7.4.3.  Allows force providers to assess risk-to-force and improves force development 
and personnel/assignment actions by the supporting commanders. 
9.8.  Tasking Notification. 
9.8.1.  An operational deployment begins when a unit or detachment, or an individual not 
attached to a unit or detachment, departs homeport/station/base or departs from an enroute 
training location to meet a SecDef-approved operational requirement. An event is an 
operational deployment if it is recorded in the JCRM or Fourth Estate Manpower Tracking 
System and is contained in the annual GFM-DI compliant tool under the GFM-DI reporting 
structure. 
9.8.2.  When notifying units of tasked unit line numbers, force providers utilize the tasking 
notification tool in DCAPES to support information on deployment activity and data reflected 
in the TPFDD (see Table 9.1.). The process begins when the sourcing agency applies the 
tasking notification code “A” to notify force providers of a sourcing solution. Upon verification 
of the sourcing solution and to notify units, force providers (requirements managers, FAMs, 
or AFFORGEN cells) enter an “M” in the tasking notification code field of the tasking 
notification tool. (Note:  Force providers may designate specific offices authorized to update 
this field.) This notifies the wing/base, through the Installation Deployment Officer, of the 
sourced TPFDD requirement. 
9.8.3.  Each MAJCOM/MAJCOM-equivalent initiates notification for assigned units. 
Exception: Air Force District of Washington initiates notification for units assigned to Air 
Force District of Washington (MAJCOM Code “4W”) as well as HAF organizations 
(MAJCOM code “13”).

AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
9.8.4.  The Requirements and Development Division of Secretary of the Air Force Office of 
Public Affairs (SAF/PAR), on behalf of Air Force Public Affairs Agency initiates notification 
for all Public Affairs taskings for members assigned to SAF/PA. The Air Force Public Affairs 
Agency (AFPAA) initiates notifications for its members and those of its subordinate Active 
Component unit, the 1st Combat Camera Squadron. 
9.8.5.  AFPC initiates notification for all organizations considered “outside” the Air Force and 
provides documentation of approval from OSD director of administration and management to 
the servicing installation deployment readiness cell.

Identification Designators (PIDs) are available in JOPES/DCAPES to move requirements from 
planning to execution by authorized users. 
2. Force providers/MAJCOMs will accomplish tasking notification code “M” within 10 
calendar days from “A” coding. (T-1) 
3. Sourcing agencies will accomplish tasking notification code “U” within 7 calendar days 
from “A” coding. (T-1) 
4. For crisis action planning, the same process is followed using compressed timelines to 
ensure available to load date timing is met. 
5. For Secretary of the Air Force retained forces, tasked MAJCOM/equivalent functions as 
Supporting Component and ACC (on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force) functions as 
supporting CCDR. 
9.8.6.  Supporting agencies will follow the JOPES Verification/Validation process outlined in 
CJCSM 3122.02F, Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES): Volume III Time 
Phased Force and Deployment Data Development and Deployment Execution, and CCDR 
TPFDD letter of instruction business rules. (T-0) The supported command’s TPFDD letter of 
instruction sets forth guidance regarding procedures and direction for TPFDD validation at the 
supporting and supported command level. 
9.8.7.  The management and building of TPFDD and deployment execution must follow the 
guidance as outlined in CJCSM 3122.02F. (T-0) 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024

9.9.  Line Remarks. 
9.9.1.  The use of restrictive line remarks is not authorized. Line remarks that require early 
arrival or end of tour overlap without adjustment to the estimated tour length (ETL) are the 
only authorized remarks for use. AF/A3OD manages the creation and publication of all 
approved line remarks and is the final approval authority for additions, changes, and deletions. 
The approved line remarks list is posted on the SIPR DCAPES homepage. 
9.9.2.  AFPC will remove line remarks that are not present within the DCAPES line remarks 
table. (T-1) 
9.9.3.  Service components will eliminate restrictive line remarks from practice and rely on the 
standard UTC MISCAP when requesting USAF capabilities. Service components will not 
develop or produce alternative methods (i.e., theater entry reporting instructions) that restrict 
the ability to source requirements with qualified Airmen that are within the Available to 
Commit phase for sourcing. (T-1) 
9.9.4.  Service components will leverage UTC line level detail AFSC prefix, suffix and/or 
special experience identifier (SEI) when more specific identification of position requirements 
and individual qualifications are necessary. 
9.9.5.  Service components will utilize theater reporting instructions to identify theater entry 
and pre-deployment training requirements. (T-0) 
9.9.6.  Service components may not use do not fill (DNF) in the line remarks data field. (T-0) 
If the specific line number is not filled, delete the line from the ULN/UTC. This ensures the 
actual passenger numbers roll up and are reflected in JOPES for transportation planning. 
9.10.  JIARequirements. 
9.10.1.  Joint Individual Augmentation is a joint term and process described by CJCSI 
1301.01G, Joint Individual Augmentation Procedures. Joint Individual Augmentation 
represents unfunded temporary duty positions (military or civilian) requested to augment a 
supported CCDRs or governmental agency’s staff operations during contingencies. Similar to 
requests for forces (RFFs) in support of contingencies, JIA requirements are inherently 
temporary in nature and are not to be used to solve permanent manning or capability shortages. 
9.10.1.1.  They are not to be used to source joint training or exercise requirements. 
9.10.1.2.  Supported commands must first evaluate their ability to fulfill contingency staff 
requirements using organic/ assigned manpower; only then should they request JIA support 
to cover any identified mission gaps. Once the supported commander develops, validates, 
and forwards a JIA joint manning document (JMD) to the Joint Staff, who initiates the 
prioritization and sourcing process described in CJCSI 1301.01G. 
9.10.2.  JIA Requirement Development. 
9.10.2.1.  Development and Service Allocation. Joint Individual Augmentation 
requirements for a particular joint operation and organization are developed by the 
supported commander, associated with the appropriate TPFDD, and assigned to Services 
for fill as a Joint Action tasking IAW CJCSI 1301.01G. Supported commanders will make 
every attempt to synchronize the RDD/Date Required In-place (DRI) with the AFFORGEN 
pivot date and maximize the notification time afforded deploying members. 
60 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
9.10.2.2.  The Joint Staff relays validated JIA requirements for Air Force fill (via a JMD 
formatted per CJCSI 1301.01G) to AF/A3OD for response. 
9.10.3.  Air Force Review of JIA Requirements. 
9.10.3.1.  AF/A3OD performs an initial JMD “scrub” to ensure format/content compliance 
with CJCSI 1301.01G. 
9.10.3.2.  AF/A3OD then relays the JMD to AFPC and affected HAF FAMs for detailed 
review and analysis. 
9.10.3.3.  The AFPC, with HAF FAM and AF/A3OD assistance, works with the Joint Staff 
and supported commander to resolve any requirements discrepancies or ambiguities, 
makes a preliminary determination regarding the Air Force’s ability to source and sustain 
the requirements if rotations are authorized, and forwards its analysis back to AF/A3OD. 
9.10.3.4.  With this information, AF/A3OD develops and coordinates a formal Air Force 
position and response to the Joint Staff, typically in the form of an Air Force Planner’s 
Memo, Air Force Operational Deputies Memo, or CSAF Memo. 
9.10.3.5.  Upon compiling Service positions regarding their ability to source and sustain 
the requirements, the Joint Staff may choose to convene a Prioritization and Sourcing 
Review Board to address Service or supported commander issues/concerns, broker JIA 
sourcing solutions, and/or elevate unresolved sourcing issues within the Operations 
Deputies (OPSDEPS) and JCS Tank structure (see CJCSI 1301.01G). 
9.10.4.  JIA Rotational Tour Lengths. 
9.10.4.1.  JIA rotational tours lengths will be IAW AFFORGEN rotation policy with 
exceptions approved by AF/A3. (T-1) 
9.10.4.2.  The supported commander may request longer/non-standard JIA tour lengths to 
meet position continuity or other requirements. The request must include the positions and 
justification. (T-1) 
9.10.5.  Out of Cycle JIA Requests. 
9.10.5.1.  When the initial RDD/DRI cannot be met, or the ETL does not meet warfighter 
requirements, the AFPC, component Headquarters USAF, and supporting MAJCOM (if 
known) will coordinate resolution. Tour length options, in order (appropriate 
waivers/permissions required): 
9.10.5.1.1.  ETL extends to end of current AFFORGEN rotation. Subsequent rotational 
tour lengths are synchronized with the AFFORGEN deployment window. 
9.10.5.1.2.  The initial tour ETL is 4 months, extending into the subsequent 
AFFORGEN rotation. The second rotation includes the remainder of the second 
AFFORGEN plus the next AFFORGEN rotation (third), not to exceed 179 days. 
Subsequent rotational tour lengths are synchronized with the AFFORGEN deployment 
window. 
 
 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
61 
 
9.10.5.1.3.  The second and third JIA rotations divide the remaining second 
AFFORGEN rotation plus next two (through the 4th AFFORGEN rotation such that 
the two JIA rotations have approximately equal ETLs). Subsequent rotational tour 
lengths are synchronized with the AFFORGEN deployment window. 
9.10.5.1.4.  If 179 day or longer ETLs are approved, the AFPC, in coordination with 
the supported and supporting commands, will schedule the first two rotations in order 
to align subsequent rotations with the AFFORGEN (for 179-day ETLs, every other 
rotation occurs during the AFFORGEN rotation window). 
9.11.  JIA Sourcing Procedures. 
9.11.1.  Once the supported commander, Joint Staff and the Service(s) agree to the sourcing 
commitments, the component Headquarters USAF ensures the requirements are entered in the 
appropriate TPFDD for sourcing. The requirement(s) will use standard tailored UTCs to the 
maximum extent possible. When using a non-standard/”Z99” UTC, the component 
Headquarters USAF will include a brief job/mission description with the ACR to expedite 
sourcing since non-standard/ "Z99" requirements have no mission capability statement. 
9.11.2.  In unique cases where there is no sponsoring component Headquarters USAF, AFPC 
follows internal TPFDD association procedures. TPFDD maintenance of JIA requirements is 
crucial to ensure visibility of Air Force capabilities supporting each operation. AFPC will then 
follow normal force provider sourcing and verification procedures to source personnel to meet 
JIA requirements. Individual Augmentees are filled primarily from Institutional Forces 
(UDC=X) and sourced at execution. (T-1) 
9.11.3.  AFPC will develop procedures to ensure validated positions assigned to the Air Force 
for which a sourcing solution has not been identified are examined for ability to source, sustain, 
and filled at the earliest opportunity, but no later than 4 months prior to the start of each 
rotation, if sustainable. 
9.11.4.  Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower, Personnel Services, Directorate of Force 
Management Policy (AF/A1P) will continue efforts after sourcing messages are released to 
rectify AFSC/job mismatches requested by the supported commander. 
9.11.5.  JIA Requests Not IAW CJCSI 1301.01G. 
9.11.5.1.  To ensure global visibility and centralized management of all joint JIA 
requirements, JIA support will be sent by a supported commander via the Joint Staff to the 
Services IAW CJCSI 1301.01G may not be supported by the USAF. (T-1) 
9.11.5.2.  Air Force offices aware of such requests should redirect the requestor to the 
JS/J1, Directorate of manpower and Personnel for further processing. 
 
 
62 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
9.12.  Service Augmentation/Non-Rotational Requirements/Temporary Line Numbers. 
9.12.1.  Non-Rotational Requirements/Temporary line numbers are normally the result of 
nonrecurring non-mission related activities (e.g., senior leader visits, Staff Assisted Visits 
(SAVs), Inspection Group (IG) inspections, mishap investigations, United Service 
Organizations (USO) support, etc.) with a tour length of less than 30 days. Temporary Line 
Numbers may also be used to request Service augmentation as outlined in CJSCM 3130.06C. 
It is not intended to augment mission activities or request additional support beyond the scope 
of the SecDef-approved RFF registered FTN in JCRM. Manpower needed to support mission 
activities must be coordinated via Change Requests through JCRM. 
9.12.2.  The deployed commander will evaluate the mission impact and send a request to the 
component Headquarters USAF with the needed workload, through the deployed manpower 
function. 
9.12.3.  The request must contain all TPFDD level-4, line-level detail to include purpose of 
Temporary Duty (TDY). Component Headquarters USAF will endorse/not endorse TLN 
requests, enter the requirement into the TPFDD using appropriate ULN construct, forward to 
AF/A3OD for approval, and forward the request to the AFPC for timely sourcing pending 
AF/A3OD approval. 
9.12.4.  The use of temporary line numbers is not a part of GFM so force tracking numbers 
will not be used in the TPFDD. Doing so would falsely imply it is GFMAP ordered.  
Temporary Line Numbers may also be used to request Service Augmentation as outlined in 
CJCSM 3130.06C.  AF/A3OD is the adjudicator/approval authority for use of Temporary Line 
Numbers. 
9.13.  Permanent Party Billets. 
9.13.1.  To coincide with the effective date the position is authorized on the unit manpower 
document, the component Headquarters USAF deletes the rotational requirement with the 
effective date to coincide with the arrival of the permanent party member. All such actions will 
be closely coordinated with the AFPC to ensure deployments are properly terminated. 
9.13.2.  Permanent party billets include those rotational requirements that are outsourced and 
supported by a contractor force. Once outsourced these requirements must be removed from 
the rotational PID. 
9.14.  Inter-Command Manning Assistance. 
9.14.1.  U.S. Air Force MAJCOMs will occasionally face temporary, operations staff, or unit 
manning requirements, Continental United States (CONUS) or OCONUS, that are not 
associated with a CCDRs TPFDD or PID and for which the MAJCOM does not possess the 
internal (intra-command) personnel resources to satisfy them. 
9.14.2.  Validation of these requirements is a shared responsibility between the requesting 
(supported) MAJCOM and affected AF/A1. If the requirement is approved, it is filled IAW 
DAFI 36-2110. 
 
 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
63 
 
9.15.  Ad-Hoc / In Lieu of Requirements and Sourcing. 
9.15.1.  An ad-hoc capability is consolidating individuals and equipment from various 
commands or Services and forming them into a deployable or employable entity, properly 
manned, trained, and equipped to meet the supported CCDRs requirements. Ad-Hoc 
nominations must be accompanied by an ad-hoc spreadsheet. The number of positions in the 
spreadsheet must match the nomination. (T-1) 
9.15.2.  An in lieu of capability is a standard force, including associated table of organization 
and equipment, which is deployed or employed to execute missions and tasks outside its core 
competencies. 
Section 9C—Emergent Planning 
9.16.  Emergent Requirements and Sourcing. 
9.16.1.  The GFM emergent process enables the SecDef to re-distribute joint forces among 
CCDRs at the speed of relevance to fulfill strategic opportunities, respond to crises, or major 
combat operations, and employ forces dynamically as the situation requires. 
9.16.2.  Unit emergent requirements are codified using the request for forces/capabilities 
(RFF/RFC) for units and out of cycle requests for Joint Task Force Headquarters Joint 
Individual Augmentation manpower using the joint manning document (JMD) process. 
9.16.3.  For emergent requirements, the CCDR initiates the emergent allocation process by 
identifying a requirement and submitting a request for forces/request for capability (RFF/RFC) 
to the Joint Staff. The RFF/RFC provides CCDRs with a means to obtain required support not 
already assigned or allocated to the command. IAW CJCSM 3122.01A, Joint Operations 
Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Volume 1, Planning and Policy Procedures, and 
CJCSM 3122.02E, the supported Air Force component Headquarters USAF will review all 
RFFs/RFCs for USAF capabilities being requested and place the requirements(s) in the 
applicable TPFDD prior to the supported CCDR forwarding to the JS. 
9.16.4.  Service force providers collect inputs from their respective FAMs and AFPC in order 
to develop a recommended sourcing solution. If a standard capability within existing resources 
can meet the requirement, then AFFCs recommend a standard sourcing solution. If a standard 
capability cannot meet the requirement, AFFCs, in conjunction with applicable FAMs, 
evaluate the RFF/RFC for possible non-standard sourcing solutions. If AFFCs cannot provide 
a standard USAF capability sourcing solution within existing resources, they will coordinate 
with AF/A3OD to determine if the USAF can commit resources. 
9.16.5.  Nominations will be entered into JCRM to be ordered in a GFMAP modification. 
Section 9D—Shortfall Resolution. 
9.17.  Shortfall Resolution. 
9.17.1.  Air Force units will make every effort to meet all GFMAP-ordered taskings. Relief 
should only be sought when a tasked unit does not possess sufficient or qualified personnel 
and the personnel are critical for home station mission accomplishment IAW AFI 10-201. 
Shortfall relief requests will be endorsed by the wing commander, or equivalent, before being 
64 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
elevated. Note: Submitting a shortfall relief request does not relieve the unit of the tasking 
until it has been re-sourced or closed without sourcing by the Joint Staff. 
9.17.2.  First, wings will attempt to fill shortfalls by looking at other UICs, Infrastructure 
Forces, DAV coded personnel, and Institutional Forces. If there is no mitigation at the wing 
level, then the shortfall is elevated to the respective MAJCOM for resolution, via current 
technology solution (e.g., Reclama Processing Tool or DCAPES) 
9.17.3.  Second, MAJCOMs will seek to find a sourcing solution MAJCOM-wide within the 
same AFFORGEN phase, employed-in-place, or enabler. See Figure 9.1 for the shortfall 
resolution flowchart. Resolution Process.  MAJCOMs will follow the same criteria above to 
find a sourcing solution MAJCOM-wide. If a sourcing solution is identified, MAJCOM’s will 
notify AFPC using the current technology solution (e.g., Reclama Processing Tool or 
DCAPES) and AFPC will update DCAPES with the alternate solution. 
9.17.4.  Third, if the MAJCOM is unable to fill the requirement using criteria in paragraph 
9.17.3, they will do the following.  Note: The MAJCOM will fill the requirement until relieved 
by AF/A3. 
9.17.4.1.  MAJCOM/CD will notify AF/A3 in writing (via SIPRnet email) of the shortfall 
and clearly articulate the risk to force. Written notification to AF/A3 will include a four-
part risk assessment that identifies the risk to force per the criteria found in CJCSM 
3105.01B, Joint Risk Analysis Methodology. Note: Sample four-part risk assessments can 
be found on AF/A3OD SIPRnet SharePoint Site. 
9.17.4.2.  Ensure wings update DCAPES to reflect the unit line number/force requirement 
number is in shortfall. In the MAJCOM A3 Adjudication text form using current automated 
solutions, MAJCOMs will enter the requirement type (XAB, DFT, or Supplemental) and 
the Date Time Group (DTG) from the email sent to AF/A3. 
9.17.4.3.  MAJCOM’s will notify AFPC using the current technology solution (e.g., 
Reclama Processing Tool or DCAPES) of shortfall.  AFPC will be prepared to develop 
alternate sourcing solution pending AF/A3 direction. 
9.17.5.  AF/A3 will review MAJCOM’s risk assessment and notify the requesting 
MAJCOM/CD in writing (via SIPR email) if validated/not validated. If validated, AF/A3 will 
notify AFPC of the decision for appropriate follow-on action to seek an alternate sourcing 
solution. If not validated, AF/A3 communicates with MAJCOM to fill the ordered tasking. 
Note: AF/A3 validation does not relieve the requesting MAJCOM of the tasking.  
9.17.6.  Once validated by AF/A3, AFPC takes appropriate sourcing action. If no sourcing 
solution exists, then AFPC will notify AF/A3O and the supporting component in writing “No 
Sourcing Available.” Supporting component will coordinate with the supported command to 
request close without sourcing the specific tasking. 
9.17.6.1.  If notified by a supported component that a position is not required for mission 
accomplishment, AFPC will coordinate with the applicable Air Force Service Force 
Provider (Annex A Conventional Forces – ACC; Annex B Special Operations Forces – 
AFSOC; Annex C Mobility Forces – AMC) for modification to the GFMAP. 
 
 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
65 
 
9.17.6.2.  If the supported component/supported combatant command disagrees to close 
without sourcing, then AFPC will forward package to AF/A3O for further adjudication. 
AF/A3 may submit a Service-level reclama IAW CJCSM 3130.06C or determine internal 
force-to-source sourcing recommendation.

publication by the CJCS. (T-1) 
10.3.  Operational Contract Support (OCS). 
10.3.1.  Introduction and Overview. OCS is a “whole-of-staff” process incorporating the 
planning, procurement, and management of commercial support to satisfy requirements for 
supplies, services, and construction during Combatant Commander-directed operations (which 
may include single-Service activities). Contractors have supported U.S. military operations 
since the Revolutionary War. The DoD’s and USAF’s reliance upon commercial sources of 
support is likely to evolve as concepts of employment evolve (e.g., ACE) and as the 
permissiveness of operating environments change (e.g., Conducting Logistics Under Attack). 
Coordination and synchronization of commercial support requirements, during shaping 
activities, throughout the planning process, and during execution of contingency operations, is 
essential to ensure commanders’ objectives, effects, and staff responsibilities are achieved. 
10.3.2.  Benefits of OCS. The following aspects of OCS can provide benefit to every functional 
community if considered early in the planning process and throughout the execution phase. 
10.3.2.1.  Speed. Commercial support from sources located as close as possible to the point 
of need can bring speed and agility to the fight e.g., accelerate base build-up; reduce time 
to build up and harden main operating bases/forward operating sites/contingency locations; 
reduce stress on intra/inter-theater air/sealift and overland trucking requirements; and 
provide unique skills, experience, and battle-loss replacements to offset certain functions 
performed by uniformed personnel; and ultimately shorten the time required to close the 
force. Force providers and functional area subject matter experts should evaluate and 
mitigate the associated risks.

10.3.2.2.  Resiliency. Commercial support may provide solutions for gaps in support 
available through host nation support (HNS) agreements or acquisition and cross servicing 
agreements, and it can offer options to support camouflage, concealment, and deception 
operations. Additionally, OCS provides the ability to recover after attack and continue the 
mission despite battle losses. 
10.3.2.3.  Redundancy. Commercial support can enable options for the alternative use of 
limited organic capabilities and can extend time available to establish additional sources of 
support. It may also allow forces to be repositioned or repurposed to higher priorities, 
alleviate constraints on force levels or concerns with public perception, and enable 
expeditious retrograde or transition to civil authorities upon cessation of hostilities. OCS 
can also provide flexibility to commanders when projecting forces in permissive and non-
permissive environments. 
10.3.3.  Principles of OCS. 
10.3.3.1.  It is essential to conduct commercial market research in key operational areas 
within the AOR through site surveys, scheduled exercises, and other Phase 0 actions. 
Commercial market research is an essential element of the analysis of the Operational 
Environment. This market research can be useful when making sustainment sourcing 
decisions and advising commanders on feasibility of COAs. There are a number of tools 
that can aid planners with visualization and interpretation of commercial market research. 
These tools can be accessed via the OCS Planner on staff. 
10.3.3.2.  Effective OCS planning and execution requires a collaborative approach on 
behalf of the JFC, its subordinate commands, combat support agencies (e.g., Defense 
Logistics Agency (DLA)) and their associated contracting organizations. In addition to the 
singular, overarching OCS principle of staff collaboration, the following principles are key 
to understanding the potential power and challenges of operational contract support. 
10.3.3.3.  Commercial support is relied upon in most plans and operations and should be 
considered during all phases of operations. Air Force staffs should incorporate system 
support contractors and equipment from program offices during planning. These assets will 
deploy in support of contingencies but are often overlooked during planning. 
10.3.3.4.  Commercial support is one of many sources to consider meeting operational 
requirements. 
10.3.3.5.  Commercial support is not just for logistics; it may include other critical support 
such as communications networks, staff augmentation, translators, and force protection. 
10.3.3.6.  Commercial support is not a contracting-only function. Each functional area has 
potential contracted requirements to source and several staff sections have designated 
responsibilities and considerations to ensure commercial support is planned and integrated 
effectively (see Table 10.1.). 
10.3.3.7.  Commercial support can be used to achieve certain desired objectives, effects, 
and outcomes. Commanders should consider all sources of sustainment and support to meet 
plan objectives.  Commercial support can often be the most effective and most flexible 
option.

10.3.3.8.  It is essential to conduct commercial market research in key operational areas 
within the AOR through site surveys, scheduled exercises, and other Phase 0 actions. 
Commercial market research is an essential element of the analysis of the Operational 
Environment. This market research can be useful when making sustainment sourcing 
decisions and advising commanders on feasibility of COAs. There are a number of tools 
that can aid planners with visualization and interpretation of commercial market research. 
These tools can be accessed via the OCS Planner on staff. 
10.3.3.9.  Commanders should assign qualified US government personnel to manage and 
oversee contracted support. Even the most well-written requirement and contract must have 
skilled personnel assigned to manage contractor performance to ensure it meets the 
requirements of the contract. 
10.3.3.10.  Commercial support and its associated contractor management challenges must 
be integrated early in the operational planning process. One of the most challenging 
elements of OCS is the accountability and management of contractor personnel and 
equipment. 
10.3.3.11.  All Air Force staffs have a role in the operational contract support cycle of plan-
procure-manage. See Table 10.1 for detailed staff responsibilities. 
10.3.3.12.  OCS actions can have a direct strategic impact on civil aspects of the operation 
(e.g., economic development, political/diplomatic implications, public opinion/positive 
impression of United States presence, etc.). 
10.3.3.13.  Intentional and early planning to use commercial support can help mitigate 
operational risks associated with its use and contribute to the prevention of fraud, waste, 
and abuse of critical resources during a contingency. 
10.3.4.  Functions of OCS. There are three primary functions associated with the OCS process.  
They include: 
10.3.4.1.  Contract Support Integration (CSI). This is the “plan” function of OCS. It 
includes activities to plan and integrate contract support (e.g., collaboration in boards, 
centers, cells, and working groups). It also includes activities to identify, develop, and 
approve requirements. It requires knowledge of commercial market capabilities and of 
adversary threats to potential vendors. Any directorate or functional area of a C-
MAJCOM/C-NAF staff may generate requirements to potentially be sourced 
commercially. Each directorate and functional area of the staff also has responsibilities or 
equities with regard to integration of contract support throughout each step of the planning 
process. The A4 and the cognizant Air Force Installation Contracting Center (AFICC) 
Operating Location’s (OL) senior contracting official should lead CSI across the staff and 
typically represent the service component commander (SCC) for OCS matters at combatant 
commander venues. 
10.3.4.2.  Contracting Support. This is the “procure” function of OCS. It includes the 
planning and organization of contracting forces, authorities, and constructs. It also includes 
the actions of warranted contracting officers to lead the process of solicitation, award, and 
administration of contracts. 
70 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
10.3.4.3.  Contractor Management. This is the “manage” function of OCS. It includes the 
visibility and accountability of contractor personnel (both Contractors Authorized to 
Accompany the Force (CAAF) and non-CAAF) and their associated equipment. It also 
includes activities necessary to prepare contractors for deployment, their actual 
deployment, and their redeployment. It includes forecasting and coordinating the provision 
of sustainment and other life support services to contractor personnel. It also includes 
identification and execution of contracting officer’s representative (COR) duties. 
10.3.5.  Deployment, Accountability, and Oversight of Contractors. 
10.3.5.1.  Deployment of Contractors. A variety of issues must be considered when the pre-
deployment, deployment, and re-deployment of contractor personnel is planned. For 
example, CCMD policies, theater business clearance requirements, U.S. and host nation 
laws, international legal considerations, acquisition regulations, and contract terms and 
conditions must be addressed to ensure compliance, visibility, and safety of contractor 
personnel and equipment. This information (as well as information on issuance of 
individual protective equipment, authorization for weapons, and training requirements) is 
typically held and distributed by the CCMD’s OCS integration cell (OCSIC). 
10.3.5.2.  Accountability of Contractors. This is a legal and policy requirement with 
significant attention and visibility in any contingency operation. The A1 has staff oversight 
of this function of OCS. The SPOT-ES is the DoD’s central repository for the tracking and 
reporting of contractor accountability. For CAAF (and some non-CAAF) to be provided 
by Government Furnished Services, contractor personnel must have a SPOT-ES generated 
“letter of authorization” (LOA). 
10.3.5.3.  Oversight of Contractors. Units should be prepared to deploy and nominate 
qualified personnel to serve as CORs if commercial support is determined to be the optimal 
sourcing solution for their operational requirements. Not only should personnel nominated 
to serve as CORs be trained, but they should also hold relevant skills and knowledge 
applicable to the contract they are assigned to oversee. For example, an Airman in vehicle 
operations should not be assigned as the COR for a computer network installation contract. 
Not only should personnel nominated to serve as CORs be trained, but they should also 
hold relevant skills and knowledge applicable to the contract they are assigned to oversee. 
10.3.6.  Air Force Forces Staff OCS Planning Considerations. 
10.3.6.1.  To plan for and provide effective commercial support to meet commander 
objectives, multiple staff sections have key OCS planning considerations which are 
outlined in Table 10.1 below. 
10.3.6.2.  Although Annex W is the designated location for detailed OCS information, each 
staff section should address contracted support in their respective plan Annex. For 
additional information on important OCS additions to staff Annexes, please refer to 
CJCSM 3130.03A, Appendix W to Annex W.

Chapter 11 
AFFORGEN AND THE INDIVIDUAL 
11.1.  AFFORGEN and the Individual Overview.  This chapter provides procedures for the 
management of individuals in support of the AFFORGEN model. This encompasses individual 
AFFORGEN association, force management with respect to individuals, and sourcing individuals 
to fulfill Joint Individual Augmentation (IA) requirements. 
11.2.  Air Force Personnel Contributions.  All Air Force personnel contribute to the 
AFFORGEN model. AFPC (or other designated force manager) supports Air Force operations by 
identifying the most ready and available forces as part of UTCs or as individuals to meet the stated 
requirement. Airmen are eligible for deployment during their scheduled AFFORGEN deployment 
availability period; however, increased requirements in a particular theater or mission may require 
Airmen to deploy outside their deployment eligibility window to meet the crisis. 
11.3.  Mission Accomplishment.  All Airmen are trained and equipped to provide the required 
capabilities enabling the CCDRs to accomplish their missions. Airmen also make up the staff of 
Service organizations and therefore are required to accomplish the mission of the assigned 
organization. DAF organizations are categorized based on their broad mission of combat, combat 
support, combat service support, or Other via the JCS UDC. 
11.3.1.  Airmen assigned to combat, CS, and CSS organizations are organized, trained, and 
equipped to meet the mission capabilities stipulated in postured UTCs and therefore are the 
DAF’s primary warfighting forces. 
11.3.2.  Airmen assigned to other organizations constitute the Institutional Force and are 
required to manage the programs and operations of the Service and are not identified with 
UTCs; however, these Airmen are eligible for deployment and will be used primarily to meet 
Joint Individual Augmentation requirements. 
11.4.  AFFORGEN Employment Force Indicator (AEFI).  All Airmen, regardless of 
assignment to combat, combat support, combat service support, or institutional force will be given 
an AEFI IAW Table 11.1. (T-1)

11.4.1.  Guard and Reserve components will determine component specific AFFORGEN 
procedures. (See Chapter 5). (T-1) 
11.4.2.  Commanders or equivalent are responsible for determining the appropriate 
AFFORGEN Employment Force Indicator for all assigned personnel. 
11.4.2.1.  Within 15 days of arrival, (permanent change of station/permanent change of 
assignment), commanders will ensure Airmen are postured against one of the four 
deployment eligibility windows based on their unit assignment to an AFFORGEN FE. 
(T-1) 
11.4.2.2.  Deployment Availability (DAV) Code 65. Per unit commanders’ discretion, 
DAV Code 65 is intended for use when no other DAV code applies, and the deferment is 
personal in nature and not mission driven. DAV Code 65 will not exceed 6 months without 
Wing commander or equivalent approval. Examples include but are not limited to extreme 
family (not Exceptional Family Member Program) or financial issues. Airmen will not be 
included in the normal rack-and-stack tasking methodology but eligible for deployment as 
part of a forced-to-source solution or resolving a shortfall/reclama. (T-1) 
11.4.3.  MAJCOM FAMs (or other delegated organization) will monitor AEFI codes to ensure 
Airmen are properly distributed throughout the associated deployment eligibility periods. 
(T-1) 
78 
AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
11.4.4.  MAJCOM FAMs and unit deployment managers (UDMs) will advise unit commander 
of recommended AFFORGEN indicator codes to correct erroneous or blank AFFORGEN 
indicator codes and suspense commanders for corrective action. Airmen with blank 
AFFORGEN indicator codes will be considered "available" in the current AFFORGEN phase. 
(T-1) 
11.4.5.  Prioritizing Eligible JIA Personnel. The pool of available and qualified personnel will 
be evaluated by AFPC based on input criteria, sorted by number of contingency deployments 
(as defined by Duty Status 20, Contingency Deployment), oldest deployment return date, 
number of short tours, and earliest short tour return date. 
11.4.6.  AFPC will enter the tasked PAS and Social Security Number (SSN) of the identified 
most eligible person into DCAPES and place the ULN in the designated force module for 
verification. (T-1) In the event the organization seeks to make a name change, the unit should 
submit a shortfall as detailed in paragraph 9.18. 
11.4.7.  Evaluation of Tasking. Upon receipt of a deployment tasking from AFPC, the tasked 
MAJCOM/DRU/FOA will follow similar procedures for UTC taskings (T-1): accept the 
sourcing solution; initiate a UIC change or name change; or submit a shortfall. (See paragraph 
9.18.) 
11.4.8.  Institutional Force “Any AFSC” Sourcing Business Rules. Within the CS/CSS any 
“AFSC requirements” will be allocated and scheduled to the generic MAJCOM TPAS. (T-1) 
CS/CSS approved business rules can be found in the Air Force Force Generation Support Plan. 
Upon receipt of an “any AFSC” requirement, AFPC filters MilPDS data to create and prioritize 
a manageable pool of eligible and qualified personnel. In addition, professional career fields 
will not be considered for “any AFSC” requirements and rated officers will only be considered 
for rated requirements (e.g., A-Staff). (Note: For taskings sourced to a rated Airman, AFPC 
will notify AF/A3O of recommended sourcing solution. AF/A3O will coordinate review of 
sourcing solution with HAF Rated FAM). (T-1). 
11.5.  Force Management of Individuals. 
11.5.1.  Force management of personnel during the deployment and employment process are 
covered in AFI 10-403 and DAFI 36-3802. 
11.5.2.  AC and ARC forces must not deploy longer than 365 days or remain deployed more 
than 30 days past the ordered deployment end date (for deployments less 365 days) without 
SecDef approval. (T-0) 
11.6.  Deploy-to-Dwell/Mob-to-Dwell Waivers. 
11.6.1.  All individual DAV Code 81 (Individual Dwell Time) waiver requests for Air Force 
service members require SecDef approval per Directive-type Memorandum (DTM) 21-005 – 
“Deployment-to-Dwell, Mobilization-to-Dwell Policy Revision. (T-0) 
11.6.1.1.  For the AC, the SecDef’s goal for the deployment-to-dwell ratio is 1:3 or greater. 
The deployment-to-dwell ratio threshold is 1:2. SecDef approval is required to deploy an 
AC unit, detachment, or individual with a ratio of 1:2 or less.

11.6.1.2.  IAW DoDI 1235.12, for the RCs, the SecDef’s goal is a ratio of 1:5 or more. The 
M2D ratio threshold is 1:4. Sec Def approval is required to mobilize an RC unit, 
detachment, or individuals with a ratio of 1:4 or less. These ratios apply only to dwell time 
for Service members who have completed a deployment of 30 days or more. 
11.6.2.  In order to facilitate staffing of waiver requests for SecDef approval, the following 
procedures will be followed: 
11.6.2.1.  Volunteering member submits a signed “Volunteering Airman’s Individual 
Deploy to Dwell Waiver Request Memorandum” through their first general/flag officer in 
their chain of command (Wing/CC, etc.) to volunteer outside of their Available to Commit 
AFFORGEN phase. (T-1) 
11.6.2.2.  MAJCOM/A3 coordinates via AF 1768, Staff Summary Sheet (attached with 
Airman’s Waiver Request) to AF/A3. (T-1) 
11.6.2.3.  AF/A3 approves/disapproves request for submission to SecDef. (T-1) 
11.6.2.3.1.  If AF/A3 approves, AF/A3OD submits volunteering members request to 
Joint Staff for inclusion in the next available SDOB. (T-1) 
11.6.2.3.2.  Once SDOB is signed, AF/A3OD will notify applicable MAJCOM/A3 via 
SIPRNet email. (T-1) 
11.6.2.3.3.  If AF/A3 disapproves, AF/A3OD will notify with applicable 
MAJCOM/A3 via SIPRNet with the rationale for disapproval. (T-1) 
11.7.  Force Management.  The Air Force assignment and separation/retirement process will be 
managed to coincide with the AFFORGEN battle rhythm to the maximum extent possible. 
Commanders will make every effort to schedule voluntary PCS/PCA departure dates, permissive 
TDY, terminal leave dates for retirement, and separation dates, to occur during the Airmen’s 
“Reset” phase or return from deployment. See DAFI 36-3203, Service Retirements and DAFI 36-
3211, Military Separations for rulesets on separation/retirement applications in lieu of supporting 
AFFORGEN deployments. Professional Military Education or Developmental Education 
(PME/DE), commanders must make every reasonable effort to deconflict PME/DE with the 
Airman’s “Available” phase when determining the timing of school attendance. Airmen should 
not be relieved from deployed duty if alternate school start dates are available which would allow 
deployment. 
11.8.  Temporary Non-Deployable Status.  Airmen who become temporarily disqualified during 
their AFFORGEN “Available to Commit” phase may be utilized upon return to deployable status 
to meet unit deployment requirements. Immediately upon return to deployable status the 
disqualified Airman may be utilized to fill out-of-cycle requirements or short notice Joint 
Individual Augmentation requests. Unit commanders may also realign the Airman with the unit’s 
next deploying phase.

AFI10-401  19 JULY 2024 
 
11.9.  Professional Development.  Wing commanders, or equivalents, may approve a change in 
an Airman’s AFFORGEN Indicator when the change is to facilitate career progression (e.g., 
Airman is promoted and moved to a position commensurate with the new grade). To minimize re-
sourcing actions, changes to AFFORGEN Indicators should be made at least 6 months prior to 
previously assigned phase, when feasible. Every effort will be made to assign the Airman to a 
position that will provide the greatest amount of time between “Available” phases while 
deconflicting the Airman's projected Date Estimated Return From Overseas (DEROS) or 
Maximum Controlled Tour Expiration Date when applicable.
