(Add) 7.12. Training Concepts, Policies, and Requirements. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1. Training Concepts. HAF/A3T (C2 Operations Branch), in direct collaboration with 
AETC/A3OP and the C2 Operations Enlisted Force Council, designs 1C3X1 education, training, 
and force development programs and ensures units implement them to achieve the highest degree 
of mission capability possible with available resources. CP Chiefs/OICs, C2 Operations 
Superintendents, and Certification Officials at MAJCOM/FLDCOM Command Centers and 
wing-level C2 nodes under the 11K100 Air Force Manpower Standard (non-SC2E locations) will 
ensure assigned C2 Operations personnel are trained to the maximum level of proficiency to 
meet mission requirements. The term “CP Managers” signifies CP Chiefs/OICs and CP 
Superintendents. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.1. Training consists of academic instruction through 1C3 formal education and 
training, qualification training, and continuous evaluation and may take place in both real-time 
(live) and exercise or simulated environments. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.2. The training program is categorized into two elements: Qualification Training 
(QT) and Continuation Training (CT). Qualification Training is further sub-categorized into 
Initial Qualification Training (IQT), Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and Position 
Qualification Training (PQT). 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.2.1. Initial Qualification Training offers a hands-on introduction to the 1C3 AFS, 
covering the unit, local community, and state/federal integration. It delivers essential training 
needed for initial qualification and is traditionally targeted for an individual’s first duty location. 
 
 
Changes to AFMAN10-207 
(Add) 7.12.1.2.2. Mission Qualification Training provides mission specific training for PCSing 
or PCAing members who have previously completed IQT at a previous 11K100 location (non-
SC2E location). Mission Qualification Training affords the potential of accelerated qualification 
by not having to retrain on the basic functions of being a controller (e.g., phone basics, events 
logs basics, etc.). 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.2.3. Position Qualification Training includes specialized training for program 
management positions or assuming greater responsibilities within a program specialty, including 
Reports, Training, Quality Assurance (QA), Systems, Security, and Operations. Position 
Qualification Training also encompasses junior controllers upgrading to senior controller. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.2.4. Continuation Training encompasses training aimed at maintaining essential 
qualifications and increasing proficiency to support the unit’s mission. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.3. Training culminates in a ‘Qualification’ and ‘Mission Ready’ or ‘Combat 
Mission Ready’ status. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.3.1. Award of an initial qualification status requires: 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.3.1.1. Enrollment in initial training and completion of formal education and 
training requirements (e.g., in-residence, distance learning (DL), etc.). 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.3.1.2. An evaluation administered by any member of the training team and 
subsequent qualification via the DAF Form 4374, Certificate of Qualification. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.3.2. For controllers to be qualified at single controller locations, the individual 
must be able to execute basic console and positional requirements and operate on the console 
alone without assistance. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.3.3. For multiple controller locations, being junior controller qualified determines 
that an individual can do the basics associated with positional requirements but cannot operate 
console alone and without assistance. Although junior and senior controller duties are similar, 
there are differentiating stipulations associated with each position. A senior controller 
qualification indicates the individual’s capacity and capability to exercise adequate control of the 
console as a shift lead or as a single controller. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.3.4. An initial qualification evaluation is administered to determine continued 
career field suitability and subsequently monitored through continuous evaluation. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.4. Mission Ready (MR) status applies to personnel in non-nuclear tasked OPLAN 
units who have satisfactorily completed IQT/MQT following an initial evaluation and maintain 
qualification and currency through annual check-ride performance evaluation and CT. This term 
does not apply to Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status units. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.5. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status applies to personnel in nuclear tasked 
units that support a weapon system (i.e., NC3 USAF AN/USQ-225) who have satisfactorily 
 
Changes to AFMAN10-207 
completed IQT/MQT following an initial evaluation and maintain qualification and currency 
through annual check-ride performance evaluation and CT. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.6. Disqualification indicates that an individual cannot perform unsupervised duties. 
It is intended for short term situations, such as personnel who have not fulfilled continuation 
training requirements or who have displayed poor performance in scenario training, etc. After 
disqualification, the training team will conduct a Training Needs Assessment (TNA) and 
qualification evaluation to requalify the member. Once complete, CP Managers will have the 
authority to requalify a person who has been disqualified. 
 
(Add) 7.12.1.7. Decertification is a more severe form of qualification removal and indicates an 
individual cannot perform unsupervised duties. It is intended for instances such as revocation of 
security clearances, multiple disqualifications, failure to maintain standards/substandard duty 
performance, etc. For a person to be requalified after a decertification, the Training Team will 
conduct a TNA and qualification evaluation to requalify the member. Once complete, their 
qualification would need to be certified by the Certification Official. Decertification is also a 
mechanism to remove a member from the 1C3 AFS who are unable to meet the needs of the 
career field. Refer to Personnel Services Delivery Guide on Classification Enlisted Air Force 
Specialty Code (AFSC) Disqualification. 
 
(Add) 7.12.2. Training Policies. 
 
(Add) 7.12.2.1. Training Managers may adjust an individual’s training timeline or remove 
personnel from training due to extenuating circumstances (i.e., emergency leave, medical or 
administrative action, Humanitarian or Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) 
reassignment, etc.). 
 
(Add) 7.12.2.2. CP Managers may enter newly assigned personnel awaiting a final/adjudicated 
Top Secret security clearance into training but may only grant access to training material 
commensurate with the member’s security clearance (interim or adjudicated). Members must be 
cleared for training via local offices for any external training that involves classified information 
(i.e., COMSEC). 
 
(Add) 7.12.2.3. Individuals not performing duties and unable to meet 1C3 DAFECD entry, 
award, or retention requirements will not be entered into or continue in training. Command Post 
Managers will immediately initiate procedures to remove the individual from the 1C3 AFS and 
reclassify the member to the appropriate 9 series AFS until final disposition of the member is 
determined. 
 
(Add) 7.12.2.4. 1C3 personnel with less than two years in the career field cannot be assigned as 
NCOIC, C2 Operations Training unless approved by a CP Manager and MAJCOM/FLDCOM 
Functional Manager. 
 
 
 
 
Changes to AFMAN10-207 
(Add) 7.12.2.5. For RegAF locations with a SMSgt authorization, CP Managers are not required 
to qualify unless directed by HHQ or local leadership. CP Managers in the grade of MSgt and 
below are required to qualify unless waived by Wing or Delta Commander. CP Managers who 
do not qualify will go through local unit familiarization training. ARC CP Managers will follow 
ARC guidance. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3. Qualification Requirements. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.1. Training Requirements for Qualification. IAW DAFMAN 36-2689, Training 
Program, trainers must be recommended by their supervisor, be qualified to perform the task 
being trained, and have completed the Air Force Training Course. The Training Team will 
identify all personnel who have met the task-trainer requirement. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.2. Any individual training a task must maintain required qualifications to be able to 
train and sign off that applicable duty position/task. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.3. Department of the Air Force (DAF) Master Training Plan (MTP). The DAF 
MTP is the baseline template for MAJCOM/FLDCOMs to develop their MAJCOM/FLDCOM 
specific training plans. HQ USAF/A3T (C2 Operations Branch) will create the DAF MTP shell 
for MAJCOM/FLDCOMs to develop their respective training plans. Units will utilize the 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM specific training plans to further refine unit-level requirements and execute 
their own training program. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.4. Master Task List (MTL). The MTL is a comprehensive list of tasks performed 
within the career field and is a reformatted version of the 1C3X1 CFETP Part II - Specialty 
Training Standard (STS). The MTL will function as a key reference for MAJCOM/FLDCOMs to 
formulate a comprehensive compilation of essential training tasks specific to each 
MAJCOM/FLDCOMs requirement. Units will utilize their MAJCOM/FLDCOM MTL to 
develop an extensive list of all tasks performed within the work center. MAJCOM/FLDCOMs 
will designate controller requirements on the MAJCOM/FLDCOM MTL. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.4.1. Every effort should be made to incorporate mandated training tasks under a 
related STS task. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.4.1.1. Local/unit-level tasks that do not fit under an existing STS task will be 
documented on the DAF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation. Units will identify 
additional tasks that are documented on the DAF Form 797 by annotating their Unit Designator 
on the MTL (e.g., “5 BW/All-Domain C2 Operations Controller.”) 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.5. Annual Training Plan (ATP). The ATP utilizes training received during initial 
training and applies it throughout the year for ongoing continuation training. Units are 
encouraged to add training tasks based on the relevancy of the applicable task(s) for local 
mission execution and requirements. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.6. Plan of Instruction (POI). POIs provide the trainer a plan for training each 
individual STS (codified in the 1C3X1 CFETP Part II). The training team will provide their 
 
Changes to AFMAN10-207 
members the necessary tools to attain proficiency in task performance, task comprehension, and 
subject knowledge relevant to each task. Refer to Attachment 7 for minimum POI requirements. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.6.1. There are three types of POI training tasks: 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.6.1.1. Knowledge (K). The use of mental processes that enable a person to identify 
facts, state principles, analyze or evaluate the subject. Knowledge is obtained through self-study, 
training meetings, and testing/knowledge assessment. Knowledge task training is considered 
complete when the trainee can successfully identify why and when a task must be done and why 
each step is needed. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.6.1.2. Performance (P). Identifies part of a measurable objective that describes 
observable controller behavior (or the product of that behavior) that is acceptable to the evaluator 
as proof that learning has occurred. Performance task training is considered complete when the 
trainee can successfully demonstrate they can do all parts of the task on their own. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.6.1.3. Both (pk). The ability to recall facts, identify concepts, apply rules or 
principles, and demonstrate observable behavior, which pertains to the task. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.7. Performance Standards. Performance standards are developed by 
MAJCOM/FLDCOMs for tasks identified as “Performance” or “Both”. Performance standards 
provide objectives with pre-existing conditions, available resources, allowable evaluator/trainer 
assists/errors, and a timeliness standard to clearly evaluate controller accuracy, timeliness, and 
correct use of procedures in meeting the learning objective. 
 
(Add) 7.12.3.8. Unit Training Plan (UTP). The UTP is a single, comprehensive base document 
for units to use, which consists of the MTL, ATP, POI, Performance Standards, and the 1C3X1 
CFETP. Unit-specific training items and requirements will be incorporated with 
MAJCOM/FLDCOMs requirements and will be used to train all sections of the training program. 
 
(Add) 7.13. Transfers (PCA/PCS). The training team will conduct a Training Needs Assessment 
(TNA) to assess the training records of newly assigned individuals to determine experience, 
qualifications, and currency of training. Based on this review, they will recommend to the CP 
Managers a training plan to meet the unit’s mission under the following allowances: 
 
(Add) 7.13.1. The training team will determine if the individual will be entered into MQT or 
IQT. 
 
(Add) 7.13.1.1. Individuals transferring from a unit that possesses similar mission requirements 
will retain those qualifications. Prior to performing unsupervised duties, the training team will 
validate satisfactory completion of a MQT check-ride/qualification evaluation. 
 
(Add) 7.13.2. An individual who has been disqualified for more than 12 months must re-
accomplish IQT. 
 
 
Changes to AFMAN10-207 
(Add) 7.13.2.1. If a member is placed into IQT, the option for proficiency advancement exists by 
demonstrating skill and competence. 
 
(Add) 7.13.2.1.1. An example of this is if an individual returns from a Developmental Specialty 
Duty (DSD) assignment and is enrolled in IQT, they may advance through the training more 
quickly by demonstrating proficiency. 
 
(Add) 7.14. Certification Official. The Wing/Base/Installation Commander or designated 
representative is the Certification Official and is responsible for certifying a member’s 
qualification status; the Commander will not delegate this authority below the Deputy 
Commander or Director of Staff (for A-Staff organizations and Command Centers) (T-2). 
MAJCOM/FLDCOMs may further specify delegation authorities in their supplements. 
Qualifications will be documented on the DAF Form 4374. 
 
(Add) 7.15. Personnel Reliability Assurance Program. Controllers performing Personnel 
Reliability Assurance Program (PRAP) duties will be certified in accordance with 
DoDM5210.42_AFMAN13-501, Nuclear Weapons Reliability Program. 
 
(Add) 7.16. Waivers. Policy and procedures are enacted to provide quality and consistency in 
training and evaluation. Occasionally, unique circumstances may warrant special consideration 
and possible waiver of policy provisions. Refer to DAFMAN 90-161, Publications and Forms 
Management, Table A10.1 for a description of the authorities associated with Tier Waiver 
Authorities. The default waiver approval authority for compliance items not identified with a tier 
number or an office specifically identified/delegated to approve waivers in this publication is 
HAF/A3T. Unless otherwise stated in this document, Wing or Delta Commander or their 
delegated alternates (T-3) are the approval authority for individual personnel exceptions to the 
policy outlined in this instruction caused by special or unusual circumstances. 
 
(Add) 7.17. Qualification Training (QT). QT is divided into three independent elements: IQT, 
MQT, and PQT. 
 
(Add) 7.17.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Initial Qualification Training provides a 
practical overview of the 1C3 AFS, unit, local community, and state/federal integration, and any 
necessary training to attain initial qualification. This training is mission-specific training required 
to perform the junior and/or senior duty controller roles and administered IAW this document. 
Completion of IQT qualification is required prior to performing unsupervised duties and is the 
highest form of accreditation through formal endorsement by the Certification Official. 
 
(Add) 7.17.1.1. Initial Qualification Training prepares individuals for unsupervised duties at 
their first duty location. Initial Qualification Training also applies to controllers who were 
assigned to a SC2E as their first duty location and to individuals who have been disqualified for 
more than 12 months. Prior to performing unsupervised duties, personnel will be trained at the 
basic controller duties and tasks. 
 
 
Changes to AFMAN10-207 
(Add) 7.17.1.1.1. Once a controller completes IQT, they remain qualified unless they are

fails to meet prescribed performance standards and/or has more Q3 results than any other 
qualification scale rating. 
 
(Add) 7.20.1.6. Critical Deviations. Failure to properly perform a critical task will result in an 
overall Q3 rating and “UNSATISFACTORY" review because it results in, or could result in, 
widespread negative mission impact or failure. Examples include but are not limited to: any 
deficiency that results in, or could result in, an unreliable nuclear weapon situation causing a 
nuclear weapon not to function or reach the target as planned and/or directed; an error by a 
controller that could credibly result in unauthorized release or improper 
execution/termination/posture; error that can lead to an unsafe nuclear weapons environment; 
inability to execute/terminate directed missions. MAJCOM/FLDCOMs will define and list 
Critical criteria for MAJCOM/FLDCOM tasks in their Master Training Plan. At the discretion of 
the evaluator, if a controller team commits a critical deviation, the overall evaluation may 
continue through the end of the scenario unless there is a concern for safety. 
 
(Add) 7.20.1.7. Significant Deviations. A task that has or could have negative mission impact or 
mission failure. Strict compliance with published procedures, policy, and guidance documents 
and/or checklists is required for successful completion. Failure to properly perform significant 
tasks may delay or degrade mission success or contribute to overall mission failure.

accomplish a required task or checklist item. Administrative tasks associated with performance 
tasks do not constitute errors (e.g. task is properly executed, however, checklist markings were 
not appropriately accomplished). 
 
(Add) 7.21. Task Decertification. Task deficiencies identified by Command Post Managers, 
Training Team, and supervisors can task decertify a controller who has not demonstrated enough 
skill, knowledge, and/or experience to perform a specific task(s) IAW DAFMAN 36-2689. This 
identification can be made during any of the following situations: scenario training, evaluations, 
exercises, no-notice injects, inability to demonstrate or convey task proficiency during normal 
duties.

Chapter 1 
OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Command Post 
1.1.1.  Command post operations furthers AFPD 10-25 guidance by serving as the focal point 
for Command and Control for commanders during routine operations, emergencies, 
contingencies, and increased readiness.  The Command Post is a direct representative of the 
commander and serves as the sole agency responsible for executing Command Post-related 
Command and Control activities. 
1.1.2.  The installation Command Post is a wing staff agency organized directly under the 
wing function.  Command Post Managers are tasked with the responsibility of operating the 
Command Post on behalf of the wing commander.  As such, either the wing commander, vice 
wing commander, or Director of Staff will be the reporting official for the Chief, Command 
and Control Operations or Superintendent if there is no Chief assigned (T-2). 
1.1.3.  Command Post. Each Command Post serves as one of the core functions of the 
Installation Command and Control construct.  The Command Post is a full-time, 24/7 
Command and Control node, directly responsible to commander(s) and serves as the focal 
point of operations, including the receipt and dissemination of orders, information, and 
requests necessary for the Command and Control of assigned forces and operations.  This 
AFMAN is applicable to all Command Posts.  Regardless of Command Post type listed 
below all Command Post Managers will ensure all assigned personnel are trained and 
certified on installation mission tasks using the Specialty Training Standard, 1C3 Master 
Training Plan, AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, and Chapter 7 of this manual, to 
include all applicable supporting MAJCOM guidance from tenant mission sets (T-2). 
1.1.3.1.  Consolidated Command Post. This type of Command Post is comprised of 
elements from two or more separate MAJCOMs/wings/units from the same component 
that merge together to share a common facility with each element responsive to the same 
Command Post Managers.  There is one set of Command Post Managers, and below the 
managers, one chain of authority, direction, and control.  All individuals assigned to 
Consolidated Command Posts supporting Air Mobility Command (AMC) will attend 
AMC required course(s) (or receive on-station training by a certified trainer) prior to 
certification (T-2).  At Active Component installations, the installation Command at all 
Consolidated Command Post manpower authorizations will be owned by the MAJCOM 
operating the installation and 1C3 billets will be assigned to the host wing Program 
Element Code (PEC) (T-2). 
1.1.3.1.1.  Command Posts supporting an Air Mobility Squadron (AMS) will have 
five of the merged AMC billets Program Element Code coded as AMC to ensure 
availability for future and emerging combatant command and AMC requirements. As 
emerging AMC mission requirements demand additional 1C3 support within the 
European Command (EUCOM) or Pacific Command (PACOM) Area of 
Responsibility (AORs); the 515th or 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing (AMOW) 
Superintendent will notify the AMC 1C3 Functional Manager and theater (United 
States Air Forces in Europe [USAFE] or Pacific Air Forces [PACAF]) MAJCOM 
6 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
1C3 Functional Manager to temporarily deploy controllers to the location as directed 
by the applicable AMOW Commander.  The tasked locations/members are at the 
discretion of the respective theater MAJCOM Functional Manager, based on manning 
levels at his/her specific units.  NOTE:  Numbered Air Force (NAF)/Air Force 
Component Headquarters/Field Operating Agency(s) are included in consolidation 
actions. 
1.1.3.2.  Command Post Association.  This type of Command Post is comprised of 
elements from two or more separate wings/units from different components (RegAF or 
Air Reserve Component) that share a common facility.  Each Command Post element has 
its own Command Post Superintendent, NCOIC, Command and Control Operations, and 
NCOIC, Training.  Administrative Control (ADCON) of controllers resides with the 
component they are a member of (i.e., Air Reserve Component personnel work 
administratively for Air Reserve Component).  Controllers in a Command Post 
Association are trained on all mission tasks supported by the Command Post Association.  
This type of Command Post applies where the determination has been made that 
component-specific mission aspects can be mutually supported by the Command Post 
console crew.  This type of Command Post is not applicable where Command Post 
elements from only one component are concerned; in that instance refer to Consolidated 
Command Post.  Use AFI 90-1001, Responsibilities for Total Force Integration, as 
guidance when preparing proposals to form Command Post Associations. 
1.1.3.3.  Collocated Command Post.  This type of Command Post is comprised of 
controllers from two or more separate wings/units from different components (Active 
Component or Air Reserve Component) that share a common facility.  Each Command 
Post element has its own Command Post Superintendent, NCOIC, Command and Control 
Operations, NCOIC, Training, and Command and Control responsibilities.  Controllers in 
a Collocated Command Post may share information with one another, but do not share 
work, (e.g., controllers are not trained to perform one another’s component specific 
mission).  Additionally, ADCON of Command Post controllers resides with the 
commander from each controller's component. 
1.1.3.4.  Regional Command Post.  This type of Command Post fully integrates two or 
more installations Command Posts into one geographical region Command Post; it may 
include Command Post elements from different components (Active Component or Air 
Reserve Component).  Each Command Post element has its own Command Post 
Superintendent, NCOIC, Command and Control Operations, and NCOIC, Training.  
ADCON of Air Reserve Component Command Post personnel resides with the Air 
Reserve Component unit commander to which they are assigned.  All Command Post 
controllers are capable of facilitating Command and Control for every mission aspect 
represented by all wings and tenant units supported.  Further responsibilities will be 
outlined in a memorandum of agreement/understanding between units.  Once established, 
Regional Command Posts follow the same guidance as Consolidated Command 
Posts/Command Post Associations as outlined in this manual. 
1.1.3.4.1.  When creating a Regional Command Post composed of more than one 
component, Command Post Managers will ensure all coordination requirements listed 
in AFI 90-1001 are met, prior to implementation (T-1). 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
7 
1.1.3.4.2.  Regional Command Post establishment is coordinated with the Command 
Post MAJCOM Functional Manager(s), MAJCOM A3(s), and the Air Force Career 
Field Manager.  Final approval authority is the AF Director of Air Operations. 
1.1.3.4.3.  Unit Weapons Safety Command Post are owned by the MAJCOM 
operating the installation. 1C3s billets are under the host wing Program Element 
Code. 
1.1.3.4.4.  Air Reserve Component manpower authorizations at a Regional Command 
Post are owned by the Air Reserve Component element they represent. 
1.1.4.  Specialized Command and Control Elements.  These are organizations that perform 
operations in support of specialized mission requirements.  The following are Specialized 
Command and Control Elements:  Air Mobility Control Centers; Contingency Response 
Groups; Air Operations Centers; Office of Special Investigations Operations Center; 1st 
Helicopter Squadron Mission Control Center, MAJCOM Command Centers, Air Force 
Watch (AF Watch), USAFE Munitions Support Squadron, or MAJCOM-defined Specialized 
Command and Control Elements.  This AFMAN is applicable to Specialized Command and 
Control Elements where directly specified.  MAJCOMs will determine additional 
applicability of this AFMAN in their respective MAJCOM supplements. 
1.1.5.  MAJCOMs will provide the Career Field Manager a list of their Command's 
Command Post designations depicting which units have been merged and their title (i.e. 
Consolidated Command Post, Command Post Association, Collocated Command Post, and 
Regional Command Post).  The Career Field Manager will maintain this list on the 1C3 
Intelink site at https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/afcommandpost/SitePages/Home.aspx. 
1.1.6.  Each installation/owning wing (base, station, joint-base, etc.) operating a Command 
Post will maintain and operate a single Command Post (where determined to be legal and 
beneficial) to support Command and Control activities/functions for all resident and tenant 
units/organizations. 
1.1.7.  AF organizations at the wing or group level residing on an installation operated by 
another service component (e.g., Joint Basing) may maintain and operate a stand-alone 
Command Post when the Command and Control needs of the AF organization cannot be met 
by the host service. 
1.2.  Command and Control Direction 
1.2.1.  The CSAF exercises Command and Control of AF forces through a global structure of 
fixed and expeditionary Command and Control facilities.  The AF Watch provides positive 
and effective Command and Control of AF assets in support of the AF mission.  The AF 
Watch communicates CSAF direction directly to MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and Units.  The 
AF Watch is a FOA that reports to the AF/A3 Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations. 
1.2.2.  MAJCOM Command Centers direct/exercise Command and Control of MAJCOM 
resources.  Within the MAJCOM, Command and Control structure, the MAJCOM Command 
Center is authorized to communicate command (CJCS, Combatant Command [CCMD], 
USAF, or MAJCOM) directions to operational organizations.  However, there are instances 
where CJCS or CCMD direction is communicated directly to the Air Force Component 
Headquarters, Air Operations Center, or executing/supporting forces (e.g., Operational Plan 
8 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
[OPLAN] 801X directives). MAJCOM Command Centers originate command directions, 
oversee status and location of MAJCOM resources, and manage commander-directed 
reporting. 
1.2.3.  The installation/owning Command Post is the primary agency authorized to 
communicate command (CJCS, CCMD, USAF, or MAJCOM) directions to operational 
organizations supporting the entire installation (e.g., Security Forces, Airfield Management 
Operations).  At the Wing level the Command Post is the only installation Command and 
Control function authorized to receive and process Emergency Action Messages) and prepare 
and transmit AF Operational Reports (AF OPREP-3).  Installation/owning Command Posts 
provide Command and Control support to tenant units, to include relaying command 
directions, flight following, and operational reporting.  Tenant units must coordinate and 
communicate operational requirements involving host resources through the Command Post 
(T-3).  Resulting memorandum for records are developed IAW AFI 25-201, Intra-Service, 
Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support Agreement Procedures, and maintained on file. 
1.3.  Organization. 
1.3.1.  The MAJCOM Command Center is the focal point of the MAJCOMs’ operations and 
conducts activities according to MAJCOM plans and policies.  MAJCOM Command Centers 
are organized as a staff agency under the MAJCOM commander, typically administratively 
aligned under the Director of Staff or Director of Operations (A3). 
1.3.2.  The installation/owning Command Post is the focal point of an installation’s 
operations and conducts activities according to assigned units’ plans and policies. 
1.4.  Command Post Functional Areas. 
1.4.1.  At a minimum, Command Posts consist of the following functional areas:  Command 
and Control Operations (includes Emergency Actions processing capability [if applicable]), 
Reports, Training, and Systems.  These functional areas perform duties in support of the 
career field’s four core competencies:  Mission monitoring/management, Emergency 
Actions, Emergency Management, and Operational Reporting (includes resource readiness 
[formally the Status of Resources and Training System or SORTS] and capability readiness 
[formerly the Defense Readiness Reporting System or DRRS, and includes Mission Essential 
Task/List mission assessment]). 
1.5.  Provisions 
1.5.1.  At the commander’s discretion, Command Posts may review high-priority messages 
addressed 
to 
the 
installation 
commander/vice 
commander, 
and 
tenant 
wing 
commander(s)/vice commander(s) during non-duty hour periods, to determine whether the 
message warrants immediate delivery/action.  Command Posts will not be tasked to 
review/route routine or non-emergency base-wide/MAJCOM headquarters message traffic 
(T-3). 
1.5.2.  The 1C3X1 controllers receive Basic Allowance for Subsistence at the standard rate, 
due to the nature of assigned duties (e.g., inability to depart the work center, non-standard 
duty hours) IAW AFMAN 65-116V1, Defense Joint Military Pay System Active Component 
(DJMS-AC) FSO Procedures.  1C3X1s will be placed in dorm rooms that have cooking 
facilities to enable them to prepare meals for rotating shift work schedules (T-3). 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
9 
1.5.3.  Command Posts and 1C3X1s will not be utilized as the Base Operator.  The Standard 
Command Post team consists of two controllers with limited phone lines (T-1).  Due to the 
responsibilities of the Command Post and the notification systems that are utilized, 
administrative base information calls hinder controller response for emergent situations and 
contingencies.

Chapter 3 
PERSONNEL, POSITIONS, DUTIES, AND DEVELOPMENT 
3.1.  This chapter defines the difference between Operational and Non-Operational 
Command Posts.  It identifies the minimum criteria to remain a 1C3X1, including clearance, 
standard duty titles.  Furthermore, it identifies the four key Command and Control Operations 
functional areas: Console Operations, Reports and Readiness, Training, and Systems.  It also 
establishes a cross-trainee program and a process for Superintendents and MAJCOM Functional 
Managers to interview potential 1C3X1s.  Additionally, it defines the members of the 1C3 
enlisted forces council and establishes their charter to develop career field members across the 
conventional, nuclear, and mobility spectrum including their leadership capabilities. 
3.2.  Staffing Requirements, Positions and, Assigned Duties 
3.2.1.  RegAF manpower requirements will be reviewed by the Career Field Manager, 
AF/A1MR, AFMAA, and MAJCOM Functional Managers and validated/published in AFMS 
135A00.  The ANG 1C3 Career Field Manager addresses ANG-specific manpower 
requirements and the appropriate manpower standard in its supplement to AFMAN 10-207.  
The AFRC 1C3 MAJCOM Functional Manager will address AFRC-specific manpower 
requirements and the appropriate manpower standard in their supplement to AFMAN 10-207. 
3.2.1.1.  Command Posts will be manned continuously with certified controller(s) (T-1). 
3.2.1.2.  All 1C3s, Command Post Managers, officers, and civilians assigned to the 
Command Post will be certified to work console and maintain certification IAW Chapter 
7 of this AFMAN (T-3). 
3.2.1.3.  Operational Command Posts will be manned with a minimum of two certified 
controllers (e.g., flying, satellite, and Nuclear Command and Control units) (T-3).  ANG 
Command Posts will be manned with a minimum of two certified controllers (T-2).  Non-
operational Command Posts will be manned with a minimum of one certified controller 
(T-3).  Command Posts with airfield quiet hours may adjust console manning based on 
mission requirements.  There will be at least one senior controller on duty at all times (T-
3).  Review Command Post Crew Size Waiver to identify locations approved crew size 
requirements outside the normal two certified controller team; superintendents will man 
the console over the two AF requirements based on unit mission requirements (T-2).  
Consolidated Command Post locations with an Air Mobility Squadron, will have one 
controller dedicated to air mobility support and/or other supported commander/tenant 
mission requirements (T-2). 
3.2.1.4.  Specialized Command and Control Elements may be manned with a minimum 
of one certified controller, unless otherwise directed by MAJCOM/CCMD guidance. 
3.2.2.  Command Post Managers will ensure RegAF Overhead staffing of Command Posts 
are IAW AFMS 135A00 and this manual (T-1). 
3.2.2.1.  Variances to AFMS 135A00, whether positive or negative, are coordinated with 
the MAJCOM Functional Manager(s) and Career Field Manager prior to submission to 
AFMAA, who will validate the variances using the AFMS process. 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
17 
3.2.2.2.  Command Post Managers will not convert any RegAF 1C3XX Command Post 
manpower authorizations from military to civilian or add any outside billets without the 
written approval of the Career Field Manager (T-1).  Command Post manpower 
requirements are codified in AFMS 135A00.  All authorizations assigned to the 
Command Post Unit Manpower Document will perform duties in the Command Post; 
removing of billets from the Command Post Unit Manpower Document or filling billets 
with personnel working outside the Command Post is not authorized. (T-2). 
3.2.3.  The Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory identifies mandatory and minimum 
requirements for entry into, award, and retention of the 1C3X1 AFSC.  Additional on-the-job 
training and upgrade requirements may be required by the 1C3 CFETP, governing 
MAJCOM, or locally determined directives. 
3.2.3.1.  To remain in the 1C3X1 career field, personnel must: 
3.2.3.1.1.  Be able to work rotating shifts; if a controller is not capable of working 
rotating shifts (e.g., Day and Night shifts rotating) for more than 1 year the member’s 
AFSC will be changed to a 9 series AFSC pending either cross-training or separation 
from the AF (T-1). 
3.2.3.1.2.  Maintain a deployable status; if a 1C3XX remains in-eligible to deploy for 
more than two continuous P1, P3 & P5 periods (e.g., P1, P3 & P5 and a second P1, 
P3 & P5 in a row) then the member’s AFSC will be changed to a 9 series AFSC 
pending either cross-training or separation from the AF (T-1). 
3.2.3.1.3.  Agree to work the Air Force nuclear mission (non-Personnel Reliability 
Assurance Program and critical Personnel Reliability Assurance Program mission) 
(T-1). 
3.2.4.  Process to retrain into the Command and Control Operations Career Field 
3.2.4.1.  (Not applicable to the Air Force Reserves)  .    Personnel retraining into the 
1C3 AFSC are required to be interviewed by closest Command Post Superintendent and a 
Competent Medical Authority for Personnel Reliability Assurance Program eligibility 
prior to being approved for retraining (T-1).  The Superintendent will review the 
member’s current Assignment Management System Single Unit Retrieval Format 
(SURF), last five EPRs, Air Force Fitness Management System II (AFFMS) Member 
Individual Fitness Report, and conduct a face-to-face interview (T-2). If any potential 
negative trends or issues exist which would impact the member receiving a Top Secret 
security clearance, the superintendent should non-recommend the individual for 
retraining. The Competent Medical Authority reviews the member’s records for 
Personnel Reliability Assurance Program suitability factors that would result in 
permanent Personnel Reliability Assurance Program disqualification.  If factors exist that 
would result in permanent Personnel Reliability Assurance Program disqualification, the 
Competent Medical Authority non-recommends the member for retraining into the 1C3 
career field. The interviewing Superintendent will forward the entire package, including 
the signed Competent Medical Authority recommendation, to the MAJCOM Functional 
Manager for coordination (T-1).  The MAJCOM Functional Manager will forward the 
entire package, plus a MAJCOM Functional Manager recommendation, to the Career 
Field Manager for final approval (T-1).  MAJCOM Functional Managers will also submit 
18 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
non-recommended retraining packages to the Career Field Manager for cancellation of 
technical school class dates (T-1).  ANG Command Posts are not required to forward the 
entire package for coordination or final approval. 
3.2.4.1.1.  The interview process is critical to maintaining the integrity of the 1C3X1 
AFSC.  Command Post missions differ based on command of assignment and weapon 
systems employed.  Therefore, the interviewer considers the person’s ability to meet 
all AFSC requirements when deciding whether to recommend a person for retraining 
into the 1C3X1 AFSC.  The Superintendent will ensure the individual meets the 
minimum requirements for retraining listed in Attachment 2 (T-2). 
3.2.4.1.2.  If the applicant does not have access to a Command Post (e.g., 
deployed/assigned location has no Command Post), individuals are interviewed and 
recommended for entry into the 1C3X1 AFSC by their 1C3 MAJCOM Functional 
Manager (telephone interviews are acceptable). 
3.2.4.2.  All recommendations to allow/deny the member to retrain into the 1C3 AFSC 
are reviewed and approved by the Career Field Manager; all documentation must be sent 
with the recommendation.  ANG units, all recommendations to approve/disapprove the 
member to retrain into the 1C3X1 AFSC are reviewed and approved at the state level. 
3.2.5.  Chief, Command and Control Operations.  When AFMS 135A00 authorizes a Chief, 
the Chief can be assigned/possess the 86P Special Duty Identifier, 13M, 13N AFSC(s) or be 
converted to a civilian GS-12; all are acceptable upon approval by the installation 
commander.  As these positions are difficult to fill, installation commanders are encouraged 
to covert the position to a GS-12 with a performance document that requires the individual to 
be deployable and work rotating shift work 24/7 for continuity.  MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent 
will approve MAJCOM Command Center use of other AFSCs or civilians. 
3.2.6.  Superintendent, Command and Control Operations.  The minimum grade for a 
Superintendent is MSgt, holding a primary AFSC (PAFSC) of 1C371 and 36 months of 1C3 
experience (T-3).

submits their periodic review in a timely manner (T-1).  This includes all 1C3X1 personnel 
serving in Command and Control facilities where Top Secret information is not processed 
and/or maintained on a routine basis.  If a 1C3’s Top Secret security clearance has been 
permanently revoked, Command Post Managers will immediately initiate procedures to 
remove the individual from the 1C3X1 AFSC and reclassify the member to the appropriate 9 
series AFSC until final disposition of the member is determined (T-1). 
3.3.4.  Upon a 1C3X1 Technical Trainee Graduate arriving at their first duty station, the 
Command Post Security Manager should check the status of the Technical Trainee 
Graduate’s security clearance via Joint Personnel Adjudication System.  If the member has 
an "open" Secret investigation, the security manager will not submit an SF86 for Top Secret 
clearance until the Secret clearance is adjudicated.  If the member has an adjudicated Secret, 
with no open Top Secret investigation, the security manager will submit the SF86 requesting 
a Top Secret clearance along with fingerprinting to the applicable Wing Information 
Protection (T-1).  If the member has an "open" Top Secret, the security manager should 
monitor the investigation until adjudicated and coordinate for the member to receive an 
"interim Top Secret”.

States 
Strategic 
Command 
Emergency 
Actions/Command, 
Control, 
and 
Communications. 
3.4.7.4.  Lead Instructor or Instructor(s), Command and Control Operations Training 
Manager. 
3.5.  Duty Schedule and Restrictions.   Due to the 24-hours a day, 7 days a week manning 
requirement for Command and Control facilities, Command Post controllers working rotating 
shifts (e.g., console controller duty) will not perform additional duties/details beyond the scope 
of Command and Control functions (e.g., base clean up, snow removal, augmentee duties) 
outside of the Command Post (T-3).  This provision does not apply to personnel assigned to 
overhead positions who work less than six shifts a month.  Command Post personnel who reside 
in the dormitory are not exempt from performing bay orderly functions in the dorm common 
areas. 
3.5.1.  The duty schedule is approved by the Superintendent or designated alternate.  
Command Post Managers will post duty schedules no later than (NLT) the 20th of the 
preceding month (T-3). 
26 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
3.5.2.  Each Command Post is different with regard to creating a duty schedule.  Controllers 
will not perform more than 12 hours of continuous duty (plus necessary time for shift 
changeover) (T-3).  Each controller will be provided 8 hours of uninterrupted rest before shift 
or any scheduled Command Post meetings (T-1).  EXCEPTION:  In times of emergency, 
controllers may be required to perform duty in excess of 12 hours to ensure uninterrupted 
Command and Control.  Recommended work schedules for home station consoles is a 
panama combination with the same shift for two weeks or the entire month, which helps 
controllers maintain circadian rhythm.  During holidays (Christmas and New Year’s), 
Command Post Management should be flexible to allow extended time off for duty personnel 
working a non-standard duty schedule.  The recommended work schedule for deployed 
operations is 12-hour shifts, 6 days on duty, 1 day off or panama combination. 
3.5.3.  Controllers will not consume alcohol within 8 hours preceding a scheduled console 
shift (T-1). 
3.5.4.  Controllers should coordinate leave requests and appointments with the duty scheduler 
NLT the 15th day of the preceding month of a published duty schedule.  Controllers should 
plan for bay orderly duties, dental and medical appointments, Weighted Airman Promotion 
System testing, training requirements, and leave projections and make every effort to de-
conflict with the schedule.  Not notifying leadership of schedule deviation(s) can cause 
conflicts and may potentially impact mission accomplishment.  Command Post Management 
will work with external agencies to ensure all mandatory appointments are coordinated NLT 
the 15th day of the previous month to prevent duty interference/impact to Command Post 
operations. 
3.5.5.  Managers should designate a minimum of one individual to attend mandatory 
formations (e.g., Commander’s Call).  The designated individual attending the mandatory 
formation will brief all Command Post personnel on items of interest during the next training 
meeting and/or establish a Controller Information File item for information requiring 
immediate dissemination. (T-3).  Command Post overhead personnel will attend mandatory 
formations, unless performing console duties or otherwise excused by Command Post 
Managers (T-3). 
3.5.6.  To aid analysis of work distribution, Command Post Managers will retain duty 
schedules (to include changes) IAW AFI 33-322, Records Management Program (T-2). 
3.5.7.  Shift Requirements.  All certified controllers are required to perform at least two full 
shifts per calendar month, verified through events log review (T-2).  Individuals not meeting 
this requirement will be decertified and require completion of recertification training and be 
recertified, IAW Chapter 7 (T-2).  Air Reserve Component Traditional Command Post 
Managers and controllers must perform 4 hours of console currency a month or 8 hours in 60 
days to maintain certification, verified by events log entry (T-2).  NOTE: Certified 
controllers can take up to 59 days of consecutive leave or TDY without being decertified for 
not working two full shifts per month.

3.6.  Unit Manning 
3.6.1.  Unit Manpower Document General Information.  Manpower management is an 
essential part of resource management and key to mission accomplishment.  It is critical that 
Command Post Managers understand the basics of identifying and managing manpower to 
meet the mission. 
3.6.1.1.  The Unit Manpower Document is a computer-generated product extracted from 
the Manpower Programming and Execution System and is a key product used in the 
management of manpower resources at all organizational levels.  It lists the number and 
type of manpower (enlisted, officer, or civilian); authorized and required grades, and 
AFSC required by personnel accounting symbol; Functional Account Code; Office 
Symbol Code; and whether the positions are funded or unfunded requirements. 
3.6.1.2.  Additional data codes are also used to further define positions and organizational 
structure, such as duty titles, supervisory positions, office symbol codes, authorization 
effective dates, and Program Element Code.  The Unit Manpower Document does not 
reflect information about the individuals who are filling the authorized positions; the Unit 
Personnel Management Roster, generated by the personnel community, provides specific 
data associated with assigned personnel. 
3.6.1.3.  Command Post Managers will request a Unit Manpower Document from the 
installation Manpower Office quarterly (T-3).  It is imperative managers review their 
Unit Manpower Document to ensure it accurately reflects unit requirements.  Command 
Post Managers will report Unit Manpower Document changes or discrepancies to the unit 
manpower POC and MAJCOM Functional Manager (T-3). 
3.6.2.  Unit Personnel Management Roster.  The Unit Personnel Management Roster reflects 
personnel and the Unit Manpower Document reflects the positions.  It is critical for 
Command Post Managers to ensure personnel are assigned to the correct grade and position 
on the Command Post Unit Manpower Document; this will ensure each location identifies 
vacancies and remains fully manned.  In addition, an imbalance between the Unit Manpower 
Document and Unit Personnel Management Roster can have a negative impact on the 
mission and the unit’s ability to meet AEF taskings.  Command Post Managers will request a 
Unit Personnel Management Roster quarterly, and report discrepancies to the commander’s 
support staff and MAJCOM Functional Manager immediately (T-3). 
3.6.3.  Preparing the Command Post Manning Report.  The Command Post manning report 
provides MAJCOM Functional Managers with current and projected manning status based 
on the Unit Manpower Document and Unit Personnel Management Roster.  It is a valuable 
tool in determining future manning and tasking priorities.  MAJCOMs may add to the 
content of the manning report; however, at a minimum, the manning report contains the 
information stipulated in paragraph 3.5.4.  Command Post Managers will ensure Command 
Post manning reports meet the requirements of all parent MAJCOMs/functional managers 
(e.g., MAJCOM Functional Managers and ANG Career Field Manager) (T-2).  Command 
Post Managers will: 
3.6.3.1.  Ensure the Unit Manpower Document accurately reflects authorizations. (T-2). 
3.6.3.2.  Maintain an updated current (quarterly) copy of the Unit Manpower Document 
and Unit Personnel Management Roster. (T-3). 
28 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
3.6.3.3.  Verify accuracy of duty AFSC and position number on personnel actions. (T-2). 
3.6.3.4.  Maintain a suspense file of personnel actions and verify approved actions are 
correctly entered into the Personal Data System. (T-2). 
3.6.3.5.  Coordinate permanent change of assignment actions. (T-3).  Ensure required 
documentation is completed and submitted. 
3.6.3.6.  Allocate projected gains against forecasted or actual vacant authorizations. (T-
3). 
3.6.4.  Command Post Manning Report Submission Instructions.  Command Post Managers 
will ensure the manning report is submitted monthly to MAJCOM Functional Managers (T-
2).  When significant changes occur that require HHQ involvement, Command Post 
Managers will notify the MAJCOM Functional Manager/Career Field Manager (as 
applicable) as soon as possible (T-2).  MAJCOMs will develop guidance or instruction for 
submitting manning reports; however, they need to contain the following: 
3.6.4.1.  Position.  The 7-digit position number from the Unit Manpower Document. 
3.6.4.2.  Authorized Rank.  Rank authorized for position number. 
3.6.4.3.  Authorized AFSC.  AFSC authorized for position number. 
3.6.4.4.  Assigned Rank.  Rank of person currently assigned to position number.  If the 
person has been selected for promotion, include the letter P immediately after the current 
rank. 
3.6.4.5.  Name.  The full name and middle initial of person assigned to position number.  
If more than one person is assigned to a single position number, ensure this is properly 
reflected.  Include projected gains and annotate month/year gained in remarks.  Designate 
senior controller status next to name (e.g., Jones, James A. -SR). 
3.6.4.6.  Date Arrived Station.  The date individual arrived on station.  Use month and 
year (e.g., Feb 07). 
3.6.4.7.  (Not applicable to Air Reserve Component)  Permanent Change of Station 
(PCS) Projection.  The date member is scheduled to perform a PCS move.  Use month 
and year (e.g., Feb 07). 
3.6.4.8.  Deployment Status.  This block reflects the last date an individual deployed to 
support a contingency tasking.  Use month and year (e.g., Feb 07) the individual returned 
from their most recent deployment.  Annotate “none” if an individual has not previously 
deployed.  Use “non-deployable” if an individual cannot deploy.  NOTE:  Do not state 
the reason a member cannot deploy as this may violate The Privacy Act of 1974 or the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.  Finally, include the Air and Space 
Expeditionary Force Indicator (AEFI) the member is assigned to. 
3.6.4.9.  Remarks.  Mandatory remarks, if applicable, are listed below.  Other remarks 
may be added as necessary (i.e., if individual is decertified, has Personnel Reliability 
Assurance Program or security clearance issues, or anything else affecting Command

5.3.6.  Command Posts will have Emergency Mass Notification Systems (T-1).  Emergency 
Mass Notification Systems allow controllers to provide personnel installation-wide 
information such as:  Mission Oriented Protective Posture levels, alarm conditions, Active 
Shooter alerts, Force Protection Condition/Information Operations Condition changes, 
recalls, and natural disaster warnings.  The Command Post will be the lead Emergency Mass 
Notification System operator, with the primary Emergency Mass Notification System 
activation node located on console (T-2). 
5.3.6.1.  All Command Posts and Specialized Command and Control Elements with 
Emergency Mass Notification System capabilities/responsibilities will preface all 
Emergency Mass Notification System notifications with the installation/base name (T-1).  
For example, “For Joint Base Langley-Eustis. Force Protection Condition Charlie has 
been directed.”  At a minimum, Command Posts will include this on all telephone, email, 
Mobile Application, Short Message Service/Text, network (desktop alerts/pop-
ups/banners), and social media (Facebook/Twitter integration) notifications (T-1). 
46 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
5.3.6.2.  Exercise notifications will include the word “EXERCISE”, at least once, in the 
subject line, at the beginning, and end of the message (T-1).  For example, “EXERCISE.  
For Sheppard AFB. A Tornado Warning is now in effect.  EXERCISE”. 
5.3.7.  Global Decision Support System.  If required by AMC or MAJCOM, Global Decision 
Support System is a system for flight following MAF and SOF aircraft worldwide. 
5.3.8.  Command Posts (alternate Command Posts if funding is available) will have 
cable/satellite TV to monitor real time life-saving events (e.g. active shooter, natural 
disasters) for Emergency Mass Notification System activation purposes and situational 
awareness (T-1). 
5.3.9.  Recording.  Consoles will have voice-recording capability for both landline and radio 
communications (T-3).  If the Command Post is located in a state that has determined it is 
illegal to use voice recording capability, then the state policy must be on file (T-3).  Actual or 
exercise situations pertaining to the following may be recorded without a warning tone:  
implementation of war deployment plans, increased defense readiness posture, natural 
disasters, civil disorders, crisis situations, aircraft in-flight emergencies or hijackings, bomb 
threats, terrorist threats. 
5.3.10.  As applicable, Secondary Crash Networks will be managed and activated on console 
(T-3). 
5.3.11.  Cryptographic and Communications Security.  The AKAC-1553, Triad Numerical 
Cipher/Authentication System, is the primary Command and Control Operations 
authentication document and will be maintained in all Command Posts (T-3).  The AKAC-
1553 may be used by any AF Command and Control node to authenticate with other AF 
Command and Control nodes in time of suspected duress, validate direction/orders received, 
and/or to authenticate with transiting aircraft. 
5.3.12.  E911 System.  The Command Post will at a minimum monitor the E911 system or 
installation first responder system (T-2).  This allows the Command Post to initiate lifesaving 
notifications in-conjunction with Security Forces and/or Fire Department responses to 
incidents (e.g., Active shooter notifications to base). 
5.4.  Security 
5.4.1.  Physical Security Considerations.  The Command Post must be designated and 
controlled as a USAF Controlled Area (protection level-4) or Restricted Area (protection 
level-1–3), IAW AFI 31-101 (T-1).  Installation and tenant Command Posts that function in 
the operational chain of command as Command and Control systems are designated the same 
protection level as the highest protection level resource they support operationally (i.e., 
OPREP support doesn't equal operational support).  Tenant or geographically separated units 
are not in the wing’s operational chain of command. 
5.4.2.  Entry and Circulation Control. Entry and circulation control procedures are based on 
the protection level assigned to the facility and contained in each Installation Defense Plan 
(IDP), in addition to AFI 31-101.  The Command Post must have procedures for Command 
Post entry and circulation control either in an operating instructions or Controller Basic 
Checklist (T-1).  At a minimum, the Command Post operating instructions or Controller 
Basic Checklist will address the following areas (T-3): 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
47 
5.4.3.  Entry and Exit Procedures.  Command Post Managers must ensure strict-entry 
procedures are provided to ensure adequate protection for personnel working inside the 
restricted area and to eliminate unnecessary traffic (T-1).  Facility entry is controlled by 
properly trained individuals, granted unrestricted access and escort responsibilities into the 
facility during normal day-to-day operations.  Armed Security Forces, Security Forces 
augmentees, or Crisis Action Team augmentees trained in Command Post entry and 
circulation control procedures will control entry during Crisis Action Team activation, 
contingencies, and increased Force Protection Conditions (T-3).  All un-cleared, escorted 
visitors will be announced to the on-duty controller team when transiting the Emergency 
Actions/Console area for situational awareness (T-3).  Command Post Managers must ensure 
unit procedures comply with the following, when applicable (T-3): 
5.4.1.1.  During routine operations, only one door of an entrapment/standoff area may be 
open at a time. 
5.4.1.2.  During routine operations, personnel exiting the Command Post should ensure 
the entrapment/standoff area is clear (i.e., no one in entrapment/standoff area) before 
opening the inside door.  When an entry controller (Security Forces/Security Forces 
Augmentee/Crisis Action Team augmentee) is present, he or she controls access into the 
entrapment/standoff area and Command Post. 
5.4.2.  Inspector General team members and Staff Assistance Visit/Functional Assistance 
Visit team members are not required to have the locally-designated Command Post area 
numbers open on their Restricted Area Badges; inspectors and evaluators will use their own 
military Identification Card, Restricted Area Badge, and/or advanced entry control card from 
their home station for entry, if a valid Entry Authority List is in place. (T-2). 
5.4.3.  Command Post personnel will ensure escorted entry is IAW AFI 31-101 controlled or 
restricted area procedures.  Command Post Managers will ensure there are procedures to 
preannounce the presence of escorted personnel requiring authorized entry to a restricted area 
(T-3). 
5.4.4.  Crisis Action Team Operations.  During Crisis Action Team or high-density 
operations, when an armed Security Forces member/Security Forces augmentee/Crisis Action 
Team augmentee has been posted, they should be given the cipher lock combinations to 
Command Post inner and outer doors to control entry (not the Emergency Actions area door, 
if equipped).  The cipher lock combinations are changed immediately upon completion of the 
exercise, operation, or resolution of the crisis situation. 
5.4.5.  Entry Authority Lists/Access Lists.  The Command Post will maintain all permanent 
Entry Authority Lists, active one-time Entry Authority Lists, and Entry Authority Lists 
applicable for duration of evaluations/inspections/exercises (T-3).  Command Post personnel 
will ensure receipt of a valid and authenticated Entry Authority List IAW AFI 31-101 (T-2).

Chapter 6 
MISSION MANAGEMENT/MONITORING 
6.1.  This chapter baselines Mobility and Combat mission movement instructions for 
controllers assigned  to different MAJCOMs to ensure regardless of assignment all aircrew and 
aircraft missions are monitored through the standard Transportation and Air Mobility Command 
process.  This standardized process ensures that each aircraft and crew are utilized to the 
maximum extent possible while still ensuring the safety and security of all assets.  It explains in 
detail the mission movement process, required aircrew/mission support and how to conduct 
originating mission setups.  Additionally it defines the different Special Category Missions and 
establishes radio discipline and hazardous runway procedure. Finally it lists Aircraft Flying 
Distinguished Visitor Personnel to track and immediately report deviations on to HHQs. 
6.2.  Mission Movement.    Mission movement refers to the command post controller’s 
responsibility to provide coordination, direction and reporting as necessary throughout all phases 
of a tasked mission.  Specific duties are linked to the unique requirements of each mission set.  
Specific controller mission management/monitoring duties are based off Mobility Air Forces 
(MAF) or Combat Air Forces (CAF) specific mission sets and unit requirements to support those 
mission sets.  Information in this chapter does not apply to all controllers at every location.  
MAF Controllers and those supporting MAF transit operations (regardless of command), select 
Special Operations Forces (SOF), and controllers at Consolidated Command Post locations 
supporting AMS operations will adhere to mission execution procedures in AMCI 10-202 Vol 6, 
to include all required forms and Command and Control systems (i.e., Global Decision Support 
System, mission cards, etc.) (T-2).  MAF Controllers supporting AMS operations will also 
follow guidance outlined in applicable AMC Instructions to include, but not limited to: AMCI 
10-202 V1 & V6, AMCI 11-206, & AMCI 11-208) (T-2). 
6.2.1.  Mission management is the function of organizing, planning, directing, and 
controlling CAF, MAF, SOF, and training missions operating worldwide.  Mission 
management includes mission execution authority, i.e., the authority to direct where and 
when a mission goes and what it does once it arrives.  This function is typically performed at 
the Air Operations Center level (e.g., Functions performed by the 618 Air Operations 
Center). 
6.2.1.1.  Overall Command and Control mission management of MAF is provided by the 
Numbered Air Force Air Operations Center that tasked the mission (e.g., 618 Air 
Operations Center will mission manage 18 AF-tasked missions and the 613 Air 
Operations Center will mission manage 13 AF-tasked missions). 
6.2.1.1.1.  The 18 AF, through Tanker Airlift Control Center, will retain control of all 
AMC missions/operations at Consolidated Command Posts and will exercise that 
authority through the air mobility support controller(s) (T-2).  Additionally, the AMS 
Commander at Consolidated Command Post locations will have authority to direct 
Tactical Control (TACON) over the AMC mission through the dedicated AMC 
controller(s) position (T-2). 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
49 
6.2.2.  Command Post controllers maintain complete situational awareness concerning status 
and location of unit and transient aircraft.  Controller situational awareness is instrumental to 
the prevention of and rapid response to instances of aircraft piracy (i.e., hijacking). 
6.2.2.1.  Command Post Managers will ensure procedures are developed to notify the 
National Military Command Center of suspected or confirmed aircraft piracy (T-1). 
6.2.2.2.  Controllers are highly encouraged to review the Crisis Management Guideline 
located in AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Attach 3). 
6.3.  Aircrew/Mission Support.    The aircrew and Command Post interface is accomplished to 
provide an exchange of required mission information, such as: 
6.3.1.1.  Aircraft tail number and call sign 
6.3.1.2.  Aircraft maintenance status 
6.3.1.3.  Aircraft parking spot 
6.3.1.4.  Departure time, route, and mission number 
6.3.1.5.  Fuel load 
6.3.1.6.  Cargo/passenger load 
6.3.1.7.  Advanced Computer Flight Plan 
6.3.1.8.  Unique mission requirements 
6.3.1.9.  Distinguished Visitor  information 
6.3.1.10.  Deadhead crew, additional crewmember, etc., information 
6.3.1.11.  Itinerary to next crew rest point 
6.3.1.12.  Diplomatic clearance information 
6.3.1.13.  The 24-hour access to an aircrew intelligence read file 
6.3.1.14.  Air refueling information (e.g., receiver/tanker, mission status, air refueling 
track weather, unique air refueling radio frequencies) 
6.3.1.15.  Global Decision Support System Airfield Database printout 
6.3.1.16.  Latest copy of North Atlantic Track message 
6.3.2.  When higher headquarters direction or local events impact a flight managed mission, 
Command Post personnel and Flight Managers at the AOCs will coordinate any changes (T-
2). 
6.3.3.  Each Command Post will have the ability to assist assigned or transitioning aircraft 
commander requests for information necessary to execute their mission (e.g., Hazardous 
cargo Electronic warfare activities, etc.) (T-2). 
6.3.4.  For all enroute arrivals, the aircraft commander and additional crew members will 
contact the appropriate Command Post and provide or receive the following information, as 
applicable:  stage posture, legal for alert time/alert window, crew/additional crewmember 
orders, base information handouts, etc. (T-2). 
50 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
6.4.  Originating Mission Setups. 
6.4.1.  When supporting MAF missions/aircraft, controllers will ensure the below agencies 
have entered their information into Global Decision Support System not less than 6 hours 
prior to scheduled mission departure time (T-2): 
6.4.1.1.  Current operations:  Mission identifier and schedule. 
6.4.1.2.  Applicable flying squadron:  Active Component name and last four digits of 
social security number, squadron, wing, scheduled return time, call sign, and the 
breakdown of the aircrew (numbers of male and female officers and male and female 
enlisted). 
6.4.1.3.  Maintenance group:  Aircraft tail number, aircraft due home date, and parking. 
6.5.  Special Category Missions.  There are several types of special missions (e.g., CLOSE 
WATCH, CLOSE HOLD, and different PHOENIX missions).  These special category missions 
place additional demands on the Command and Control system above those required for normal 
operations. 
6.5.1.  Enroute Command and Control locations monitoring AMC Special Airlift 
Missions/Distinguished Visitor airlift missions will ensure the 618 Air Operations Center is 
informed of all take-off and land times as well as any deviations that occur at the monitoring 
station.  Times, deviations and advisories will be input into Global Decision Support System 
in accordance with Air Mobility Command Instruction 10-202 Volume 6. 
6.5.2.  CLOSE WATCH.  CLOSE WATCH procedures expedite the flow of essential 
mission information up channeled to the agency imposing the procedure and ensure 
designated missions receive special attention.  As applicable, Command Posts will adhere to 
the following procedures for CLOSE WATCH missions (T-2): 
6.5.2.1.  Mission movement forms, including computer equipment screen faces (e.g., 
Theater Battle Management Core Systems, Global Decision Support System) used by the 
Command Post, are prominently annotated with the words "CLOSE WATCH" or the 
letters "CW", to facilitate the rapid identification of CLOSE WATCH missions. 
6.5.2.2.  Command Posts monitoring Special Assignment Airlift Mission CLOSE 
WATCH missions will ensure the on-load and off-load contacts (airlift) or receivers (air 
refueling) and Command and Control controlling agency, i.e. Air Operations Center, are 
promptly notified of delays that effect on time operation and advise them of the revised 
scheduling (T-2). 
6.5.2.3.  PHOENIX BANNER/SILVER/COPPER Missions (Refer to AFI 11-289, 
Phoenix Banner, Silver, and Copper Operations).  PHOENIX BANNER resources 
consist of designated aircraft and certified aircrews that support the President of the 
United States (POTUS).  PHOENIX SILVER missions support the Vice President of the 
United States (VPOTUS).  PHOENIX COPPER missions support the Secret Service.  
These missions have an established priority of 1A1 and are tasked and mission managed 
as "CLOSE WATCH" missions by 618 Air Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control 
Center).  PHOENIX BANNER missions are the highest JCS priority missions flown by 
HQ AMC. 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
51 
6.5.3.  CLOSE HOLD Missions.  AMC/AFSOC operate certain missions that are highly 
sensitive.  These missions place an unusual burden on the Command and Control system, 
since any facet of the mission may require special handling procedures and limited access.  
The sensitive information may include the itinerary, the material being transported, or the 
unit being supported.  By identifying a mission as "CLOSE HOLD," HQ AMC/AFSOC 
limits the access to particular mission information and requires modification of certain 
Command and Control procedures.  Command Post personnel WILL NOT accomplish real-
time mission movement reporting on CLOSE HOLD missions (T-2).  Specific modifications 
to normal Command and Control procedures, when required, are identified in the tasking 
order (mission operating directive, OPORD, etc.). 
6.5.4.  PHOENIX PUSH.  PHOENIX PUSH is a code name used to designate a mission with 
high-level 
interest 
from 
senior 
AF 
and 
DoD 
leadership, 
Congress, 
or 
the 
national/international media.  PHOENIX PUSH may be designated for an entire mission or a 
particular segment of a mission; the designation may also be added after a mission has 
departed home station.  While PHOENIX PUSH missions are CLOSE WATCH/CLOSE 
HOLD missions, Command Post personnel will provide special attention in addition to 
normal CLOSE WATCH/CLOSE HOLD procedures (T-2). 
6.5.4.1.  Once a mission has been designated as PHOENIX PUSH, Command Post 
personnel will annotate the Global Decision Support System CLOSE WATCH/CLOSE 
HOLD fields and add a remark indicating PHOENIX PUSH status (T-2). 
6.5.4.2.  The PHOENIX PUSH designator mandates expeditious handling of the mission 
at all levels of operations. 
6.5.4.3.  Command Post controllers will keep the 618 Air Operations Center informed of 
any unusual actions relating to a PHOENIX PUSH mission. (T-3).  This is done 
immediately, via the most expeditious communications means available, normally 
telephone.  Due to the sensitive nature of PHOENIX PUSH missions, an advisory 
message does not suffice. 
6.5.5.  Silent Running.  Silent Running operations are designed to permit aircraft movement 
while minimizing the transmission of in-flight data and air/ground communications.  They 
operate within the Command and Control system and are designated CLOSE HOLD 
missions.  These missions are preplanned to operate along a specified track or within a 
planned corridor to minimize conflict with other military missions or civilian air traffic.  
These procedures may be used in the event normal International Civil Aviation Organization 
procedures become unworkable or undesirable.  Command Posts will not transmit to the 
aircraft unless (T-2): 
6.5.5.1.  The aircraft commander requests information. 
6.5.5.2.  Emergency situations dictate. 
6.5.5.3.  Radio transmissions made at pre-determined times and with pre-determined 
information is mandatory by the mission-operating directive. 
 
 
52 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
6.5.6.  Special Operations.  While a few special operations missions operate outside the scope 
of the normal Command and Control system, most special operations missions can be 
executed using normal (Global Decision Support System) mission management procedures.  
No services are required or expected from the Command Post.  Special care is exercised to 
preclude compromising such missions by queries as to the mission/status of the aircraft.  
Such queries are not made without the specific approval of the aircraft commander.  Special 
operations aircraft commanders or trusted agents will advise Command Posts of services 
required (T-2). 
6.5.7.  Prime Nuclear Airlift Force.  Nuclear airlift missions are all designated as CLOSE 
WATCH.  The exact status of each mission is continuously monitored by the appropriate 
Command Post and the 618 Air Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center).  
Classification of nuclear mission information is governed by the DoD Foreign Clearance 
Guide, Special Weapons Overflight Guide Supplement, AF Nuclear Weapons Security 
Classification Guide for Nuclear Weapons, mission directives, and nuclear transportation 
technical orders. 
6.5.7.1.  Do not use terms that reveal nuclear cargo is on board a specific aircraft, 
mission, or at a specific location (T-0).  Do not talk around classified information on the 
radio, telephone, or message by substituting terms.  When discussing a particular mission, 
use only the mission number or aircraft tail number (T-0).  References to the mission 
number and itinerary are unclassified in themselves; however, including type of security 
required, mission priority, cargo data, or special regulations that reveal nuclear cargo is 
involved may be classified. 
6.5.7.2.  The 618 Air Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center) exercises control 
over all AMC nuclear airlift missions. 
6.6.  Radio Discipline.    Radio discipline is essential to mission effectiveness.  Command Posts 
ensure only information essential to mission execution and not available by other means will be 
transmitted to, or requested from, airborne aircraft (T-2).  Every effort to exchange required 
information with an aircrew prior to departure or after arrival, and by means other than radio 
when possible.  Command Posts may use voice call signs from Voice Call Sign Listing to 
identify military aircraft, organizations, activities, and geographical locations when establishing 
and maintaining voice communications. 
6.7.  Hazardous Weather/Runway Conditions. 
6.7.1.  Command Posts will ensure meteorological watch advisories, weather warnings, and 
runway surface condition data are received from weather units and Airfield Management 
Operations and disseminated to local agencies and departing/arriving aircraft (T-2). 
6.7.2.  Command Post controllers must notify all appropriate flying operation agencies (e.g., 
Tower, Airfield Management Operations, Maintenance Operations Center) when an aircraft 
(already in execution) is rescheduled to arrive or depart within one hour of sunrise or sunset 
during an identified Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Phase II period (T-1). 
6.8.  Aircraft Flying Distinguished Visitor Personnel.   All Command and Control facilities 
will notify the AF Watch of any USAF aircraft carrying the DVs listed below that divert (T-1): 
6.8.1.  POTUS/VPOTUS 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018

Chapter 7 
TRAINING, TESTING, AND CERTIFICATION 
7.1.  This chapter establishes a standard process for controllers assigned to any MAJCOM 
to complete initial, refresher, upgrade, and certification training.  It also identifies the 
different types of monthly training and evaluations conducted by conventional and nuclear 
assigned forces.  It also, establishes inspection and deviation criteria for evaluation and 
inspection purposes.  Finally, it institutes the quality assurance program to ensure controller 
training and certification processes are maintained to the highest extent possible.  The following 
documents: the AF Master Training Plan, 1C3 CFETP, and AFI 36-2201 contain specific 
instructions for documenting and administering the Command and Control Operations training 
program.  Throughout the chapter it will state “Training NCOIC will” which means the NCOIC 
Command and Control Operations Training, Training NCO, or alternate, as applicable will be 
responsible for completing all actions. 
7.2.  AF Master Training Plan.    The Air Force Master Training Plan is the baseline template 
for MAJCOMs to develop their MAJCOM specific training plans.  Units will utilize the 
MAJCOM specific training plans to further refine unit-level requirements and execute the 
training program (T-2).  The Master Training Plan is utilized for initial/recertification, recurring, 
and formal training. 
7.2.1.  Master Task List.  The Master Task List is a comprehensive list of tasks performed 
within the career field and is a reformatted version of the 1C3X1 CFETP Part II - Specialty 
Training Standard.  The Master Task List will be used as a legend for MAJCOMs to develop 
a comprehensive list of MAJCOM’s and COCOM required training tasks.  MAJCOMs will 
identify the required certification tasks for their respective MAJCOM by annotating 
MAJCOM designator and "CONTROLLER" (i.e., AMC CONTROLLER) on the Master 
Task List.  Units with multiple MACOMs and/or consolidated/combined with ANG/AFRES 
components will have a combined Master Task List capturing all applicable training tasks 
required to be a certified controller on all mission sets.  The annotation of the MAJCOMs 
identified training requirement will be captured within the plan of instructions and annotated 
by using the appropriate MAJCOM designator and “CONTROLLER” (i.e., ACC 
CONTROLLER).  MAJCOMs will annotate other duty position requirements based on duty 
titles outlined in Chapter 3 (e.g., “SUPERINTENDENT”, “SECURITY MANAGER”, etc.) 
using either the single word or the specific MAJCOM designator with the word. 
7.2.1.1.  Every effort should be made to incorporate mandated training tasks (“MAJCOM 
or Unit CONTROLLER”) under a related Specialty Training Standard task.  Unit 
Training NCOICs will coordinate with their respective MAJCOM’s Policy and 
Procedures teams to assist in identifying where to document local/unit-level tasks that 
may not fit under an existing Specialty Training Standard task (T-2). 
7.2.1.2.  Local/unit-level tasks that do not fit under an existing Specialty Training 
Standard task will be documented on the AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard 
Continuation.  Units will identify additional certification tasks by annotating their Unit 
Designator “5 BW/Command Post Controller” (T-2). 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
55 
7.2.2.  Annual Training Plan.  The Annual Training Plan takes selected training received 
during initial training and applies it throughout the year for recurring and proficiency 
training.  Units are encouraged to add recurring training tasks based on the relevancy of the 
applicable task(s) for mission execution.  An approved MAJCOM waiver is required to 
delete MAJCOM recurring training requirements.  Annually, Command Post Managers will 
verify that all mission requirements are identified and trained (T-2). 
7.2.3.  Plan of Instruction.  Plan of instructions represent the minimum teaching steps for all 
tasks represented in the Master Task List and Specialty Training Standard.  The Training 
NCOIC will provide the training plan/tools necessary for a controller to achieve proper task 
performance, task knowledge, and subject knowledge levels specified by the plan of 
instruction training task.  By successfully completing the plan of instruction teaching steps, 
controllers achieve task qualification for that task during initial, recertification and recurring 
training.  Task qualification training must be conducted by a qualified person to a standard 
that meets or exceeds local demands for proficiency, accuracy, and timeliness.  Upon 
completion of task qualification training, documenting in the controller’s Specialty Training 
Standard serves as an official certification of proficiency and that the trainer and trainee are 
accountable for task knowledge and/or performance of the task.  There are three types of plan 
of instruction training tasks: 
7.2.3.1.  Knowledge.  The use of mental processes that enable a person to recall facts, 
identify concepts, apply rules or principles, solve problems, and think creatively.  
Knowledge is obtained through self-study, training meetings, and testing/knowledge 
assessment.  Knowledge task training is considered complete when the trainee can 
successfully identify why and when a task must be done and why each step is needed. 
7.2.3.2.  Performance.  Part of a measurable objective that describes observable controller 
behavior (or the product of that behavior) that is acceptable to the evaluator as proof that 
learning has occurred.  Performance task training is considered complete when the trainee 
is able to successfully demonstrate they can do all parts of the task on their own. 
7.2.3.3.  Both.  Ability to recall facts, identify concepts, apply rules or principles, and 
demonstrate observable behavior, which pertains to the task. 
7.2.4.  Performance Standards.  Performance standards are developed for tasks identified as 
“Performance” or “Both”.  Performance standards provide objectives with pre-existing 
conditions (when applicable), available resources (if applicable), allowable evaluator/trainer 
assists/errors (if applicable), and a timeliness standard (when applicable) to clearly evaluate 
controller accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures in meeting the learning 
objective. 
7.2.4.1.  MAJCOMs must create performance or both standards for any specific 
MAJCOM teaching step(s) added into existing plan of instructions and/or any AF Form 
797/Job Qualification Standard tasks. 
7.2.5.  Unit Training Plan.  The Unit Training Plan is a single, comprehensive base document 
consisting of the Master Task List, Annual Training Plan, plan of instructions performance 
standards, and the 1C3X1 CFETP all integrated with MAJCOM and unit-specific training 
items and requirements (e.g. AMC, USAFE, and unit items merged into one seamless 
document at Spangdahlem AB).  When applicable, units capture their specific mission 
56 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
requirements by selecting appropriate Specialty Training Standard tasks, adding to the plan 
of instruction teaching steps, or adding an AF Form 797/Job Qualification Standard, when 
approved by the MAJCOM.  The Unit Training Plan is used to train personnel during initial, 
recurring, recertification, skill-level upgrade, and position qualification training.  Units are 
authorized to expand upon MAJCOM standards. 
7.2.5.1.  Master Task List/Specialty Training Standard Unit Task Identification. 
7.2.5.1.1.  The Training NCOIC will identify all duty position training requirements 
and controller certification requirements using the MAJCOM’s provided/approved 
Master Task List (T-2).  Prior to coordinating Unit Training Plans with the 
MAJCOMs, Command Post Managers will validate that all duty position and 
controller certification requirements are captured (T-2). 
7.2.5.1.2.  Master Specialty Training Standard.  The Training NCOIC will develop a 
master CFETP identifying all the work center duty positions and tasks required for 
each position from the MAJCOM’s approved Master Task List (T-2).  Command Post 
Managers and the Training NCOIC will document and maintain the Specialty 
Training Standard IAW AFI 36-2201 (T-2). 
7.2.5.2.  Annual Training Plan Unit Task Identification and utilization. 
7.2.5.2.1.  Command Post Managers and the Training NCOIC will identify tasks from 
the Unit Training Plan for recurring training utilizing the plan of instruction teaching 
steps, and its frequency.  Units may increase the frequency of MAJCOM’s mandated 
recurring training tasks.  At a minimum all mandatory MAJCOM tasks identified as 
performance and both will be evaluated semi-annually (T-2).  Semi-annual coverage 
can be accomplished by splitting the required tasks over the two quarterly 
performance evaluations, as long as all performance and both task are covered semi-
annually. 
7.2.5.2.1.1.  Tasks trained on a recurring basis through scenario, examinations, or 
formal training are annotated on the Annual Training Plan with an “X” in the 
applicable month column on the applicable task row. 
7.2.5.2.2.  The Training NCOIC will evaluate selected tasks, marked as Performance 
or Both (T-2). The Training NCOIC will identify when the task is evaluated by 
placing an “E” in the applicable evaluation month column on the applicable task row 
(T-2).  As a minimum, unit-level added tasks marked as “Performance” or “Both” 
will be evaluated semi-annually.  All tasks to be utilized during an evaluation will be 
trained in the 2 months prior to an evaluation month (T-2). 
7.2.5.2.3.  (If applicable) Added AF Form 797/Job Qualification Standard tasks.  
Tasks, subtasks, and substeps (as applicable) requiring recurring training are added to 
the Annual Training Plan. 
7.2.5.3.  Plan of Instruction. 
7.2.5.3.1.  Plan of Instructions will include: 
7.2.5.3.1.1.  Prerequisites (if required) for anything that needs to be accomplished 
prior to the instruction.  (e.g., local course, Communications Security training) 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
57 
7.2.5.3.1.2.  Introduction. This section provides the trainee an initial orientation 
into work center requirements, 1C3X1 career progression, command post training 
requirements, personal individual readiness responsibilities, and the Command 
Post role in force structure and command and control elements. 
7.2.5.3.1.3.  References to specific instructions, manuals, pamphlets, Operating 
Instructions, and Quick Reaction Checklists for each added task/subtask (T-2). 
7.2.5.3.1.4.  Estimated duration for this specific task based on objectives and 
teaching steps. 
7.2.5.3.1.5.  Objectives that define what the trainee/controller will be able to do at 
the end of instruction. 
7.2.5.3.1.6.  Instructional aids and equipment that are necessary to complete that 
task instruction. (T-2). 
7.2.5.3.1.7.  Additional instructional guidance for the trainer. (T-2). 
7.2.5.3.1.8.  Training/Evaluation Standard to ensure trainee/controller proficiency 
is able to be captured on the added task/subtask (T-2).  It will define if the task is 
only required for initial training or as recurring training requirement as well and 
how it will be trained. 
7.2.5.3.1.9.  Teaching steps to the task/subtask to ensure trainee receives all 
pertinent information required to accomplish the task/subtask objective (T-2).  
Controller training time will be adjusted to complete a Specialty Training 
Standard task for any added unit teaching step(s) to an existing plan of instruction 
or creation of a plan of instruction based upon an added AF Form 797/Job 
Qualification Standard (T-2).  Units must create a task standard for unit-specific 
teaching step(s) added into existing plan of instructions and/or any AF Form 
797/Job Qualification Standard tasks identified as Performance or Both (T-2). 
7.3.  Controller Certification (initial, recertification, decertification).  Prior to performing 
unsupervised duties, Command and Control Operations personnel will be trained and certified.  
The Training NCOIC will identify if a trainee receives initial training or recertification training 
by conducting an initial evaluation of the trainee.  Controllers can be entered into recertification 
training for the following reasons: PCA, PCS, TDY, and decertification for cause.  All 
certification actions (initial, recertification, and decertification) will be documented as a journal 
entry in Training Business Area and on the Specialty Training Standard IAW AFI 36-2201 (T-2). 
7.3.1.  Trainer Requirements: IAW AFI 36-2201, trainers must be recommended by their 
supervisor, qualified to perform the task being trained, and have completed the Air Force 
Training Course. Certified Command Post controllers who have met the trainer requirements 
will administer all training (T-1).  The Training NCOIC will utilize a Memorandum For 
Record listing all certified Command Post controllers who have met the task-trainer 
requirements (T-2).  NOTE: Members of Sister Services that are trainers of AF personnel are 
not required to complete the Air Force Training Course. 
 
 
58 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
7.3.2.  The Training NCOIC will conduct the initial evaluation and work center orientation, 
IAW AFI 36-2201, on behalf of the supervisor/rater (T-3).    The Training NCOIC or 
alternate will conduct and document initial evaluation and work center orientation with the 
trainee within 5 duty days of entering training to determine the tasks to be trained and project 
a certification date (T-2).  This will determine if the trainee is entered into initial or 
recertification training. This initial evaluation and work center orientation, will be 
documented as a journal entry in Training Business Area (T-2). 
7.3.3.  Initial certification training provides controllers with the knowledge and skills 
necessary to perform duties effectively at home station or in a deployed environment.  
During initial certification training, personnel will accomplish all training requirements 
identified in the Master Task List/Specialty Training Standard and the MAJCOM/unit 797 (if 
applicable) for certification as a controller.  The Training NCOIC, supervisors, and assigned 
trainers, will use CFETP Part II Specialty Training Standard to conduct and document initial 
certification and recertification training. Additionally, they will conduct position 
qualification training (based on appointment) and applicable skill level upgrade training 
commensurate with identified requirements, regardless of applicability towards certification 
(T-2). 
7.3.4.  Recertification Training.  Recertification training provides a condensed version of 
initial certification training and is designed to teach controllers local procedures and 
MAJCOM unique mission requirements when a controllers PCS/PCAs in with prior 
MAJCOM or base experience or was decertified due to deployment, extended absence, or 
failing to maintain standards. 
7.3.4.1.  Controllers being recertified for a previous decertification will retrain only the 
deficient tasks (T-3).  Certification actions must be completed IAW paragraph 7.3.5. and 
documented on the AF Form 4374. 
7.3.4.2.  Controllers going through recertification training must review all training 
minutes or pertinent AFI or Quick Reaction Checklist changes that occurred during their 
absence but are not required to make up missed training meetings, evaluations or training 
scenario rides. 
7.3.5.  There are three elements to initial and recertification (Written Examination, 
Emergency Actions Test, and Performance Evaluation). 
7.3.5.1.  Written Examination.  Which is a 50-question open book General Knowledge 
Test derived from unit tasks. Objectives will cover “Knowledge”, and “Both” based 
tasks/subtasks from the plan of instructions. (T-2). 
7.3.5.2.  Emergency Actions Test. 
7.3.5.2.1.  Conventional Units will take a 30 question open book Emergency Action 
Test. 
7.3.5.2.2.  Nuclear Command and Control Units will take a 30 question Emergency 
Action Test; open-book/closed-book requirements will be established by 
MAJCOM/FOA/DRU’s in their supplement. 
7.3.5.3.  Performance Evaluation IAW Para 7.7.2.7 of this AFMAN. 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018

7.3.5.4.  Controllers performing Personnel Reliability Assurance Program duties will be 
certified under Personnel Reliability Assurance Program in accordance with Department 
of Defense 5210.42-R_AFMAN 13-501, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability 
Program (T-0). 
7.3.6.  Training Timelines. 
7.3.6.1.  All controllers will enter training within 15 calendar days of reporting for duty to 
the Command Post (T-3).  The date entered training will be documented as a journal 
entry in Training Business Area (T-2). 
7.3.6.2.  Breaks in controller certification training (e.g., FTAC, PME attendance, 1C3 
formal training course attendance, etc.) will be documented as a journal entry in Training 
Business Area and captured in the monthly manning report (T-2).  For Airmen 
participating in the First Term Airman Center (FTAC) program, the date entered training 
is the first duty day after FTAC completion.  If a class date is not available within 15 
days of arriving station, initial certification training will begin and an annotation as a 
journal entry in Training Business Area will be made detailing the break in training (T-3).  
Controllers will not participate in any base detail or training (e.g. SFS Augmentee 
training) that extends the FTAC program beyond the standard AF 2-week period (T-2). 
7.3.6.3.  RegAF, (full-time Air Reserve Component/Active Guard and Reserve, or 
Traditional Reservist/Drill Status Guardsman on 60 consecutive Military Personnel 
Account days) Controllers and RegAF and full-time Air Reserve Component/Active 
Guard and Reserve Command Post Managers will complete certification training within 
60 calendar days of assuming their newly assigned positions (T-3). 
7.3.6.4.  Traditional Reservist/Drill Status Guardsman controllers not serving 60 
consecutive Military Personnel Account days will be certified within one year of 
reporting for duty (T-2).  Traditional Reservist/Drill Status Guardsman controllers not 
serving 90 consecutive Military Personnel Account days in Nuclear Command and 
Control units will be certified within 18 months or 120 man-days, whichever comes first 
(T-2). 
7.3.7.  Certification Authority. 
7.3.7.1.  At Command Posts, the installation commander or designated representative is 
the certifying official(s); the installation commander will not delegate this authority 
below the installation vice commander or director of staff (T-2).  The Chief, Command 
and Control Operations has recertifying authority for controllers who have been absent 
for 60 days or more, performing Command Post related duties (i.e., deployments) or due 
to maternity leave.  NOTE:  Superintendents (regardless if Chief Command and Control 
Operations is assigned or available) are not authorized to recertify controllers. 
7.3.7.2.  The certifying official(s) will conduct a personal interview with each controller 
prior to certification (T-3). 
7.3.8.  Documentation (Initial/Recertification/Duty Position). 
7.3.8.1.  The Training NCOIC, supervisor, or assigned trainers will use CFETP Part II 
Specialty Training Standard to document initial certification and recertification training 
(T-2). 
60 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
7.3.8.1.1.  The Training NCOIC will ensure the results of the certification tests and 
certification performance evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 4374, /Center 
Controller Certification Record (T-2). 
7.3.8.1.2.  The controller (trainee) signature on the AF Form 4374 is the endorsement 
that all certification training tasks/requirements outlined in the Master Training Plan 
were completed.  The signature is also endorsing the certification evaluation rating 
and examination scores, and that the member is fully ready to perform unsupervised 
duties. 
7.3.8.1.3.  The Training NCOIC’s signature on the AF Form 4374 is the endorsement 
to the certifying official(s) that all training requirements have been satisfactorily 
achieved.  The signature is tantamount to accepting liability that the controller is 
technically proficient to accomplish the mission safely and effectively. 
7.3.8.1.4.  The Chief/Superintendent signature on the AF Form 4374 is the 
endorsement to the certifying official(s) that a comprehensive evaluation of the 
member’s training and documentation was accomplished, and that the controller 
(trainee) is ready to perform unsupervised duties.  The Chief/Superintendent assume 
responsibility that effective training was accomplished, and a quality assurance (third-
party) evaluation was conducted. 
7.3.8.2.  After the certifying official(s) has interviewed the controller and determined they 
are fully qualified, the certifying official(s) will sign and date the AF Form 4374 (T-2). 
7.3.8.3.  The Training NCOIC will maintain the AF Form 4374 on each certified 
controller until the controller PCSs/PCAs (forms will be removed by gaining base), 
separates, or retires from his/her assigned unit in the controllers individual AF Form 623. 
(T-2).  Do not re-accomplish certification documents when new certification forms are 
published or when the certifying official changes (T-2). 
7.3.8.4.  For Consolidated Command Posts, Command Post Associations, and Regional 
Command Posts, AF Form 4374s may be signed by all applicable commanders with 1C3 
personnel assigned to perform duties, but at a minimum by the owning certifying 
authority (T-2). 
7.3.8.5.  Duty Position Documentation.  Each time an Airman changes duty positions 
(transfers from another base or work center), the Training NCOIC on behalf of the 
supervisor must perform an initial evaluation that includes a review of all previously 
certified tasks (T-2).  These tasks are compared against the unit master task list and will 
determine the extent of training required for the new duty position. 
7.3.8.5.1.  During the initial evaluation the Training NCOIC identifies tasks the 
trainee was previously qualified on and assess using the current plan of instruction to 
identify whether they are still qualified on each previously signed off task (T-2).  If 
the trainee is found to be qualified, no further action is required for those tasks. 
7.3.8.5.1.1.  If the Airman is found to be unqualified on a previously certified 
task, erase the initials, retrain, and document the task training IAW AFI 36-2201 
(T-2). 
 
 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
61 
7.3.8.5.1.2.  All new/unsigned tasks identified for the new duty position by the 
Training NCOIC will be circled or the electronic equivalent to be trained and 
documented IAW AFI 36-2201 (T-2).  All circles that do not apply to the current 
duty position will be erased.  Do not erase the initials and certification dates of 
previously certified tasks that will not be accomplished at current unit or duty 
position (T-2). 
7.3.8.6.  Any individual training a task must maintain required task qualifications to be 
able to sign a trainee off in the applicable duty position/task. 
7.3.9.  Decertification.  Command Post managers will ensure personnel remain proficient in 
all certification areas, take immediate action to correct deficiencies, and remove personnel 
found not suitable for duty.  Decertification can encompass task(s) decertification IAW AFI 
36-2201 and/or controller decertification.  The Training NCOIC will document 
decertification actions and the reason(s) for decertification (e.g., substandard performance, 
etc.) as a journal entry in Training Business Area.  This includes examination failures, 
unsatisfactory performance evaluation, and any remedial/supplemental training conducted. 
7.3.9.1.  Task Decertification.  Task deficiencies identified by Command Post Managers, 
Training NCOIC, and supervisors can task decertify a controller who has not 
demonstrated enough skill, knowledge, and/or experience to perform a task(s) without 
supervision.  This identification can be made during any of the following situations: 
scenario training, evaluations, exercises, no-notice injects, inability to demonstrate or 
convey task proficiency during normal duties, and/or security/Communications Security 
incidents (this list is not all inclusive). 
7.3.9.2.  Controller Decertification.  The AF Form 4374 is used to decertify and recertify 
controllers.  The Certification Official or Command and Control Operations Chief (when 
applicable) will decertify controllers for several reasons, to include: 
7.3.9.2.1.  Extended periods of absence longer than 60 days (T-3). 
7.3.9.2.2.  Substandard Performance: 
7.3.9.2.2.1.  (Certification Official(s)  Only)    Controllers failing to achieve a 
minimum passing score on an Emergency Actions examination will be evaluated 
by Command Post Managers and the NCOIC, Training for decertification, which 
will be documented as a journal entry in Training Business Area (T-2).  A second 
examination failure within a rolling six month window will result in 
decertification (T-3).  If a controller fails an examination in February, Command 
Post Managers have the option to recommend the individual for decertification.  If 
the same individual fails another examination in May, the controller will be 
decertified due to two failures in a six month period (T-3).  Once the controller is 
recertified, the rolling six month window will start over the following months 
(e.g., June would be month one of the new rolling window) (T-3).  Controllers 
who fail to achieve the minimum passing score on an Emergency Actions 
examination will be retested within 5 duty days from the failure (T-2).

Official(s)  Only) 
  Controllers 
receiving 
an 
unsatisfactory (exceeding the allowable number of deviations for an evaluated 
task as identified in paragraph 7.7.2.7.2.3 through 7.7.2.7.2.7) on a performance 
evaluation will be evaluated by Command Post Managers and the Training 
NCOIC for decertification (T-2).  The evaluation will be documented as a journal 
entry in Training Business Area (T-2).  If a controller receives a second 
unsatisfactory on a performance evaluation within a rolling six month window it 
will result in an automatic decertification (T-3).  If a controller received an 
unsatisfactory in February and the same individual receives a second 
unsatisfactory for another evaluation in May, the controller will be decertified due 
to two failures in a six month period (T-3).  Once the controller is recertified, the 
rolling six month window will start over the following month (e.g., June would be 
month one of the new rolling window) (T-3). 
7.3.9.2.2.3.  REGAF/full time Air Reserve Component controllers failing to pass 
the required monthly examination(s), or failing to receive a satisfactory rating on 
a 
quarterly 
performance 
evaluation 
will 
be 
required 
to 
complete 
remedial/supplemental training (T-2).  Remedial/supplemental training will be 
defined in the Command Post Operating Instructions, if required, or supplemented 
by the MAJCOM.  The failing controller will not be utilized as one of the on-duty 
controllers during this remedial/supplemental training (T-3).    Traditional 
Reservist and Drill Status Guardsman Air Reserve Component members will 
follow MAJCOM’s guidance (T-2). 
7.3.9.2.3.  Security clearance withdrawal (T-1). 
7.3.9.2.4.  AEF Deployments.  Controllers are decertified when deployed for 60 days 
or longer (T-1).  Command and Control Operations Chief will decertify a controller 
once the member has been gone for more than 60 days (T-3).  Command Post Chiefs 
may elect to formally decertify a controller prior to the 60 day mark, however, should 
the deployed controller return prior to 60 days, recertification training must be 
accomplished (T-2). 
7.3.9.2.5.  Not working 2 full shifts per month (T-2). NOTE: Certified controllers can 
take up to 59 days of consecutive leave or TDY without being decertified for not 
working two full shifts per month. 
7.4.  Command Post Recurring Training.  The purpose of recurring training is to ensure 
controllers remain qualified in all areas pertaining to their unit’s mission.  This training is based 
on the requirements established in the MAJCOM’s/Unit Annual Training Plan.  The Training 
NCOIC will cover tasks on the Annual Training Plan through a combination of formal training 
meetings, self-study, and proficiency training (T-3). 
7.4.1.  The Training NCOIC will conduct training meetings a minimum of once per quarter 
(T-3).  NOTE: To achieve maximum participation, training meetings can be conducted on 
the console when mission is not interrupted.

7.4.1.1.  The Training NCOIC will document training meeting minutes, as well as, the 
subtasks trained on the AF Form 4371, Record of Controller Formal Training (T-2).  If 
short notice training was accomplished during the training meeting that was not listed on 
the Annual Training Plan or self-study letter, the Training NCOIC will document it on 
the Form 4371 as supplemental formal training (e.g. recall procedures or areas of concern 
for a pending exercise need emphasis) (T-2).  The Training NCOIC will also attach any 
training meeting slides or visual aides to the AF Form 4371, Record of Controller Formal 
Training (T-2). 
7.4.1.2.  All controllers must attend the training meetings, unless excused by Command 
Post Managers (T-3).  The Training NCOIC will ensure all personnel not present at the 
training meeting receive training NLT 5 calendar days after returning to duty (T-3). 
7.4.2.  Self-Study.  The Training NCOIC will create a monthly self-study letter outlining 
each month’s training requirements, based on the Annual Training Plan (T-2).  The Training 
NCOIC will document all subtasks identified on the Annual Training Plan for that month on 
the self-study letter (T-2).  Additional training not required by the Annual Training Plan can 
be added to the self-study letter each month without modifying the Annual Training Plan.  
Self-study letter(s) must be signed by a Command Post Manager (T-2).  Certified controllers 
are required to thoroughly review all identified requirements, to include each teaching step 
within the identified plan of instruction(s) task/subtasks and/or sub-steps (if applicable).  
Command Post Managers, Training NCOIC, and supervisors are responsible for helping 
controllers complete and understand self-study requirements.  The self-study letter will be 
published NLT the first day of each month (T-2).  The Training NCOIC will retain the self-
study letter in the Controller Information File Binder until the next month (T-2).

from duty for 59 days or less will review and make up all missed training not accomplished 
(e.g., training meetings, examinations, training scenarios, performance evaluations), within 
10 calendar days of returning to duty (T-2).  Command Post Managers, Training NCOIC, and 
supervisors are responsible for ensuring each controller is briefed on all procedural changes 
and/or significant events that occurred during their absence (T-2). 
7.6.1.1.  Traditional Reservist and Drill Status Guardsmen Personnel: 
64 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
7.6.1.1.1.  Traditional Reservist and Drill Status Guardsman personnel that miss 
monthly training, will review the Controller Information File, and make up all missed 
training (T-3).  Command Post Managers, Training NCOIC and supervisors are 
responsible for ensuring personnel are briefed on all procedural changes and/or 
significant events that occurred during their absence. (T-3).  Command Post 
Managers, Training NCOIC and supervisors will provide this training prior to 
personnel assuming duty (T-3). 
7.6.1.1.2.  Traditional Reservist and Drill Status Guardsman personnel who miss two 
or more consecutive Unit Training Assembly weekends will be decertified and 
entered into recertification training upon returning to duty (T-3).  Prior to returning to 
duty, personnel will be recertified (T-3). 
7.7.  Testing, Training, Evaluations, and Quality Assurance 
7.7.1.  Written Examination Requirements for Monthly Training and Certification. 
7.7.1.1.  Examinations.  The Training NCOIC will ensure a minimum passing score of 
90% (critiqued to 100%) is completed to pass all written examinations (T-2). 
7.7.1.2.  The Training NCOIC will document monthly examination scores on the AF 
Form 4372, Record of Controller Recurring Training or if documenting in Training 
Business Area use the following standard entry titles: Month/Year Emergency Actions 
test or Month/Year General Knowledge test, retests will state Month/Year Emergency 
Actions retest (T-2). 
7.7.1.3.  The Training NCOIC will retain paper or electronic copies of all written 
examinations for 12 months from the end of the month they cover (T-2).  NOTE:  If 
Emergency Actions/Two-Person Control materials are involved, the Training NCOIC and 
Command Post Managers will ensure the electronic files are password protected (T-0). 
7.7.1.4.  Test questions will be written to the Instructional Systems Design format (T-2).  
The questions must be multiple-choice questions, with four potential answers and one 
correct answer choice.  Each question will be written to the knowledge level of the 
specific task identified in the Specialty Training Standard (if the task has both 5 and 7 
knowledge level then write to the 5 knowledge level) (T-2).  If a question comes from a 
task without a knowledge level assigned it must be written to the big “A” or little “a” 
standard listed in the CFETP (T-2). 
7.7.1.5.  MAJCOM’s Master Question Files.  MAJCOM’s may elect to facilitate unit 
testing through a Master Question File.  If a Master Question File is utilized, test 
development, test validation, HHQ testing, and Master Question File control 
requirements will be identified in the respective MAJCOM supplement. 
7.7.1.6.  General Knowledge Test. 
 
 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
65 
7.7.1.6.1.  General Knowledge Test objective tests questions, covering “Knowledge”, 
“Performance”, and “Both” based tasks/subtasks identified on the Annual Training 
Plan for the month will be incorporated into monthly scenario training (T-2).  The 
General Knowledge Test may be comprised of an open book knowledge test or as a 
verbal knowledge assessment as further defined by each MAJCOM.  The Training 
NCOIC can increase/decrease the verbal interaction based on controller knowledge-
level deficiency(s) or displayed experience and self-study. 
7.7.1.6.2.  General Knowledge Test objective test questions are not required during 
quarterly evaluations.  Controllers will use the plan of instructions, Annual Training 
Plan and monthly self-study letter to prepare for verbal General Knowledge Test 
assessment during the scenario training. 
7.7.1.7.  Emergency Actions Examination. 
7.7.1.7.1.  Monthly Test.  All certified personnel will be administered a monthly 
Emergency Actions written examination covering "Knowledge" and "Both" based 
task/subtasks identified on the Annual Training Plan for that month (T-2).  The 
individual writing the exam is exempt from taking that test (T-3).  The Training 
NCOIC and Alternate will rotate developing the monthly Emergency Actions 
examination with the goal of not developing exams in back-to-back months (T-2).  
This will be documented by editing the meta data in Microsoft Word by selecting File 
at the top of the screen and editing “Author” under Related People and “Date” when 
saving the test (T-2). 
7.7.1.7.1.1.  For Nuclear Command and Control units  with a closed-book 
Emergency Actions testing requirement, there will be a test A and test B version 
(T-2).  All Emergency Actions examinations will have a minimum of 20 
questions (T-2).  MAJCOMs will identify testing parameters (e.g., Master 
Question File, test development, validation, etc.) and requirements (open-
book/closed-book) in their MAJCOM supplement. 
7.7.1.7.1.2.  For Nuclear Command and Control units  the Superintendents and 
NCOICs (Command and Control Operations/Quality Assurance) will alternate 
validating the monthly Emergency Actions examination with the goal of not 
validating exams in back-to-back months (T-2).  Validation consists of taking the 
examination prior to giving the examinations to any controllers for their 
documented monthly recorded score.  The member validating the examination 
will only interact with the examination builder when questions and/or answers are 
ambiguous, misleading or incorrect (T-2).  Once the examination is scored, the 
validator will cover how the examination could be improved in order to meet 
Instructional Systems Design requirements and to ensure that all test questions, 
and answers, are developed to the appropriate level being tested using standard, 
direct, and concise language (T-2). 
7.7.1.7.1.3.  For Conventional Units   all Emergency Actions examinations will 
consist of at least 10 open-book questions (T-2). 
 
 
66 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
7.7.2.  Scenario Scripts for Monthly Training, Evaluations, Certification, and Quality 
Assurance observations will be conducted/documented using the AF Form 803 Report of 
Task Evaluations (T-2).  When documenting the AF Form 803 in Training Business Area use 
the following standard entry titles: Month/Year Training Scenario, Month/Year Performance 
Evaluation, Month/Year Quality Assurance Observation (T-2).  The type of evaluation (e.g., 
performance evaluation, monthly training scenario, etc.) and all deficient tasks (e.g., 
Specialty Training Standard 4.5.2) are the minimum required information in the "Job 
Qualification Standard Task Item(s) Evaluated" block.  Not all tasks need to be listed. 
7.7.2.1.  For Conventional Units  .  At a minimum, the Training NCOIC will ensure all 
scripts include an emergency management situation, processing of two Emergency 
Action Messages, processing of one Alert Condition Status of Action message, and 
creation and submission of an AF OPREP-3 (T-2). 
7.7.2.2.  For Nuclear Command and Control Units  .  At a minimum, the Training 
NCOIC will ensure all scripts include an emergency management situation, processing of 
four Emergency Action Messages (five for STRATCOM aircraft units) and processing of 
two reports applicable to the unit (e.g. AF OPREP-3, STRATCOM Reports, etc.) (T-2). 
7.7.2.3.  The Training NCOIC will ensure all scripts contain a minimum of four 
situations, and are progressive in nature when possible (T-2). 
7.7.2.4.  For units with multiple Emergency Action Plans/Emergency Actions 
responsibility, the Training NCOIC will ensure at least one Emergency Action Message 
format from each supported Emergency Action Plan is used/covered in the scenario (T-
2). 
7.7.2.5.  The Training NCOIC will retain paper or electronic copies of all scripts for 12 
months from the end of the month they cover (T-2).  NOTE:  If Emergency Actions 
materials are involved, the Training NCOIC and Command Post management will ensure 
the electronic files are password protected (T-0). 
7.7.2.6.  Monthly Scenario Training.  Scenario training is not graded, but rather used as a 
learning tool for controller performance proficiency.  Scenario training can be conducted 
on the console.  Scenario training will be documented using the AF Form 803 IAW para 
7.7.2. (T-2). 
7.7.2.6.1.  The Training NCOIC will ensure scenario training scripts rotate between 
actual and exercise Emergency Action Message traffic every other month (T-2).  
Units can inject an exercise message into an actual scenario to show prioritization and 
vice versa (T-2). 
7.7.2.6.2.  A HHQ or locally evaluated exercise can satisfy all or some of the scenario 
training requirements.  The Training NCOIC will determine which task/subtasks were 
performed and whether they meet the standards but it still must be documented on AF 
Form 803 (Report of Task Evaluations) (T-3). 
 
 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
67 
7.7.2.7.  Performance Evaluations.  All certified personnel will be administered a 
quarterly performance evaluation covering "Performance" and "Both" based 
tasks/subtasks identified on the Annual Training Plan (T-2).  The Training NCOIC will 
administer quarterly performance evaluations during February, May, August and 
November each year (T-2).  The Training NCOIC will ensure performance evaluation 
scripts contain a minimum of four situations, be progressive in nature when possible and 
cover "Performance" and "Both" based subtasks from the previous two-month period (T-
2).  Locations that perform single controller operations (daily) will conduct performance 
evaluations on a single controller to reflect their operational mission (T-3). 
7.7.2.7.1.  The Training NCOIC will ensure evaluation scripts rotate between actual 
and exercise Emergency Action Message traffic; February and August are exercise 
and May and November are actual scripts (T-2).  Units can inject an exercise message 
into an actual scenario to show prioritization and vice versa (T-2). 
7.7.2.7.2.  All performance evaluations are rated either satisfactory or unsatisfactory, 
with results documented on the AF Form 4372 and AF Form 803 (Report of Task 
Evaluations). 
7.7.2.7.2.1.  An evaluation is rated as “SATISFACTORY” if the controller 
completes all of the tasks within the number of allowable assists or errors 
identified in the Evaluation Standards portion of the Master Training Plan and 
does not surpass the allowable number of deviations. 
7.7.2.7.2.2.  An evaluation is rated as “UNSATISFACTORY” if the controller 
exceeds the allowable number of deviations. 
7.7.2.7.2.3.  Evaluated tasks are identified as critical, significant, or minor.  Errors 
noted must be corrected through remedial training.  MAJCOMs will identify each 
Master Training Plan task standards as critical, significant, or minor. 
7.7.2.7.2.4.  Critical Deviations.  Failure to properly perform a Critical task will 
result in an overall “UNSATISFACTORY" rating because it results in, or could 
result in, widespread negative mission impact or failure.  Examples include, but 
are not limited to:  any deficiency that results in, or could result in, an unreliable 
nuclear weapon situation causing a nuclear weapon not to function or reach the 
target as planned and/or directed; an error by a controller that could credibly 
result in unauthorized release or improper execution/termination/posture; error 
that can lead to an unsafe nuclear weapons environment; inability to 
execute/terminate directed missions.  MAJCOMs will define and list Critical 
criteria for MAJCOM tasks in their Master Training Plan.  If a controller team 
commits a Critical Deviation the overall evaluation will continue to the end of the 
scenario if at all possible (evaluators will attempt to make adjustments in actions 
performed to aid in continuing the evaluation). 
7.7.2.7.2.5.  Significant Deviations.  A task affecting mission accomplishment but 
doesn’t directly result in mission failure.  Strict compliance with published 
procedures, policy, and guidance documents and/or checklists is required for 
successful completion.  Failure to properly perform significant tasks may delay or 
degrade mission success or contribute to overall mission failure.  Five (5) 
68 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
significant deviations will result in an overall “UNSATISFACTORY” rating.  
MAJCOMs will define and list significant criteria in their Master Training Plan. 
7.7.2.7.2.6.  Minor Deviations.  A procedural or administrative task that does not 
fall under Critical or Significant criteria.  Failure to properly perform Minor tasks 
will not impact mission accomplishment.  Minor tasks may be performed without 
concurrent reference to guidance documents or checklists.  Ten (10) minor 
deviations will result in an “UNSATISFACTORY” rating. In addition, a total of 
four (4) significant deviations and seven (7) minor deviations will result in an 
overall “UNSATISFACTORY” rating. 
7.7.2.7.2.7.  An error is defined as the inability to accomplish a required 
task/checklist item accurately or correctly.  This does not include items such as 
checklist discipline/marking (e.g., a controller failing to check a step after 
completing a required action does not constitute an error; however, if the step that 
was missed required some action then the required item is an error).  The 
incorrect checklist marking needs to be addressed at the completion of the 
scenario/evaluation but will not result in a deviation. 
7.7.3.  The Training NCOIC will ensure controller training materials (tests, scenarios, and 
evaluations) are properly controlled to prevent compromise or disclosure (T-0). 
7.8.  HHQ Testing and Evaluations. 
7.8.1.  HHQ Testing.  IG and/or MAJCOM Policy and Procedures personnel may test 
controllers on Command Post procedures.  All HHQ testing, whether IG and/or MAJCOM 
Policy and Procedures, will be written by the MAJCOM’s Policy and Procedures office. 
7.8.1.1.  Results of IG and/or MAJCOMs Policy and Procedure administered tests should 
not be used as the sole reason for decertification of an individual.  Controller 
decertification recommendation should be based on overall performance during the HHQ 
visit and test failure.  Tests must be critiqued to 100 percent.  Testing must be IAW the 
applicable Master Training Plan.  HHQ evaluation must be assessed the same as a 
performance evaluation using the task standards listed in this document and in the Master 
Training Plan.  The same requirements apply (e.g., decertification, remedial training, and 
documented as a journal entry in Training Business Area) for an UNSATISFACTORY 
result. 
7.8.1.2.  Conventional Evaluations.  The IG and/or MAJCOM’s Policy and Procedures 
may use the training area of the Command Post as a mock console for the purpose of 
evaluation.  If evaluations are conducted, a team may be based on their mission 
requirements (e.g., single controller operations).  IG and/or MAJCOM’s Policy and 
Procedures reserves the right to select team members for evaluations.  If testing is 
accomplished, all tests will have a minimum of 20 questions, comprised from Master 
Training Plan tasks.  MAJCOMs will identify testing parameters (e.g., Master Question 
File, test development, validation, etc.) and requirements in their MAJCOM supplement. 
 
 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
69 
7.8.1.3.  Nuclear Command and Control Evaluations.  HHQ, Emergency Actions/ Two-
Person Control testing must be conducted in conjunction with the evaluation being 
administered.  The IG and/or MAJCOM’s Policy and Procedures may use the training 
area of the Command Post as a mock console for the purpose of evaluation.  If 
evaluations are conducted, a minimum two teams (A-side [senior controller] and B-side 
(junior controller) with an optional 3rd controller, equals one team) must be evaluated for 
each inspection.  IG and/or MAJCOM’s Policy and Procedures reserves the right to select 
team members for evaluations.  All written Emergency Actions examinations will have a 
minimum of 30 questions. MAJCOM’s will identify testing parameters (e.g., Master 
Question File, test development, validation, etc.) and requirements (open-book/closed-
book) in their MAJCOM supplement. 
7.9.  AF Form 623 Requirements. (All documents, documentation, and processes listed in 
paragraph 7.9 and subparagraphs will be accomplished with Training Business Area or 
equivalent system if possible (T-2). 
7.9.1.  All certified controllers will have a Training Business Area account with CFETP Part 
II/Specialty Training Standard, regardless of rank and position (T-2).  For MSgts through 
CMSgts and Officers requiring certification, the Specialty Training Standard is used for 
controller certification and position qualification training documentation only.  MSgts 
through CMSgts entered into training without a previous Specialty Training Standard are not 
required to re-accomplish documentation for 5/7 skill level training previously awarded in 
the Command and Control Operations career field.  This does not apply to MSgts in 
retraining status; they document the Specialty Training Standard IAW AFI 36-2201 for core 
task completion. 
7.9.2.  Training Business Area does not have the capability to upload and store all 623 
requirements. To ensure continuity of training documentation, the Training NCOIC will 
maintain one binder or electronic equivalent for all personnel alphabetically. The Training 
NCOIC will set up the Unit Training Binder in the following manner (T-2): 
7.9.2.1.  Tab 1 – AF Form 4374 
7.9.2.2.  Tab 2 – AF 623, Section II (ECI/CDC PARTICIPATION, ETC) and Section II 
(FORMAL TRAINING) 
7.9.2.3.  Tab 3 – Units will document exam scores IAW paragraph 7.7.1.2. 
7.9.2.4.  Tab 4 – Training Certificates 
7.9.2.5.  Tab 5 – Miscellaneous (i.e., AF Form 2096, Classification or On-the-Job 
Training Action, 5 and 7 level Distance Learning Course documentation, etc.) 
7.9.3.  AF Form 623s are not required to be taken with personnel to deployed locations 
unless otherwise indicated in applicable deployment reporting instructions. 
7.10.  Training Binder Requirements.    The Training NCOIC will maintain the following 
training documentation in a Training Binder or electronic equivalent (T-2).  The Training 
NCOIC will divide the binder or electronic file into four sections (T-2): 
 
 
70 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
7.10.1.  Section I – Self Study.  This section contains the monthly self-study letters.  The 
Training NCOIC will retain self- study letters for 12 months from the end of the month they 
cover.  If kept electronic the original signed copy must be kept in the record by scanning if 
applicable. 
7.10.2.  Section II – Training Meeting Records.  This section contains the training meeting 
minutes for each month conducted.  The Training NCOIC will retain the AF Form 4371 for 
12 months from the end of the month they cover. If kept electronic the original signed copy 
must be kept in the record by scanning if applicable. 
7.10.3.  Section III – The Master CFETP-STS, MTL, MAJCOM’s and unit 797s (if 
applicable) and Annual Training Plan. 
7.10.4.  Section IV – Miscellaneous.  Waivers, appointment letters, and MAJCOM 
Functional Manager correspondence.  If kept electronic the original signed copy must be kept 
in the record by scanning if applicable. 
7.11.  Quality Assurance Programs are mandatory for Nuclear Command and Control 
units only.  
7.11.1.  The Command and Control Operations Quality Assurance program is designed to 
ensure Command Post Managers maintain effective and continuous oversight on the training 
program (initial, recurring, recertification and upgrade training) through a validation process.  
The Quality Assurance oversight aids in analysis/trending of controller performance and 
system effectiveness to proactively enhance readiness through improvements in operations 
and training functions.  This effort also provides for the establishment of a baseline for 
normal operations; identifies, mitigates, and monitors operational risks, including 
inefficiencies.  At a minimum, the superintendents and NCOICs (Command and Control 
Operations/Quality Assurance) will each monitor one Command Post team every quarterly 
evaluation cycle (T-2).  If possible, Superintendents and NCOICs (Command and Control 
Operations/Quality Assurance) should monitor all evaluations in a quality assurance capacity 
to validate training effectiveness.  They will not conduct a joint validation to meet this 
requirement (T-2).  In an attempt to ensure every controller is observed, evaluation(s) can 
take place during monthly/certification scenario training in addition to the mandatory 
quarterly performance evaluations. 
7.11.1.1.  Superintendents and NCOICs (Command and Control Operations/Quality 
Assurance) are responsible for executing and sustaining a quality assurance program that: 
7.11.1.1.1.  Through active involvement of all initial controller certification 
evaluations and persistent involvement in monthly scenario training and quarterly 
performance evaluations. 
7.11.1.1.2.  Analyzes and provides corrective actions on negative controller trends 
(identify and mitigating risks).  Data will be collected on the AF Form 803, Report of 
Task Evaluations, for each controller/team during either a monthly/certification 
scenario or quarterly evaluation (T-2).  Collecting data in this way assists in 
attempting to observe every controller within each quarter.  All data captured will be 
utilized to identify trends and analyzed to determine if deficiencies exist with the 
training tools, program or controller(s).  Deficiencies that pertain to training tools 
(i.e., Master Training Plan, Master Task List, plan of instructions, Emergency Action 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
71 
Checklists, etc.) will be reported to MAJCOM Functional Managers for corrective 
action.  Deficiencies that pertain to the training program or individual controllers will 
be immediately corrected by Command Post Managers (T-2). 
7.11.1.1.3.  Provides essential quality training feedback throughout planning and 
execution.  Using the MAJCOM task standards (critical, significant, or minor) 
evaluate training and validate that it is effective. The AF Form 803 will be used to 
record controller validation sessions.  The form will be used to document deficiencies 
in the training tools (e.g. Master Task List, plan of instructions, Annual Training Plan, 
Performance Standards, etc.), the training program and to identify the controller’s 
strengths and areas needing improvement.  The AF Form 803 will be kept for 12 
months to develop trend analysis and controller improvements.  The Training NCOIC 
will store the forms in the training binder or scan/saved and stored in the training 
directory file plan (T-2). 
7.11.1.1.4.  Establishes a controller documentation review program which examines 
training documentation quality and ensures adherence to standards and scope of 
training IAW AFI 36-2201 and Chapter 7 of this AFMAN. 
7.11.1.1.4.1.  In addition to upgrade training documentation/review requirements 
outlined in AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6, as a minimum, Superintendents or NCOICs 
(Command Control Operations/Quality Assurance) will review two (2) different 
training records per month to identify training documentation deficiencies, and 
timeliness/quality of controller training. 
7.11.1.1.4.2.  Accomplishment of Superintendents or NCOICs (Command and 
Control Operations/Quality Assurance) reviews will be documented in Tab 5 or 
electronic equivalent of a controller’s training folder (AF Form 623). 
7.11.1.1.5.  Provides MAJCOM’s Policy and Procedures with training program ‘best 
practices’ (e.g., plans, policies, tools, scenarios, etc.) for centralized, command-wide 
analysis and incorporation (T-2). 
7.11.1.2.  The Quality Assurance/Evaluations oversight aids in analysis/trending of 
controller performance and system effectiveness to proactively enhance readiness 
through improvements in operations and training functions.  This effort also provides for 
the establishment of a baseline for normal operations; identifies, mitigates, and monitors 
operational risks, including inefficiencies. 
7.11.1.2.1.  Analyzes and corrective actions on negative controller trends (identify 
and mitigating risks). 
7.11.1.2.2.  The Training NCOIC is responsible for developing and administering the 
evaluations (T-2).  Using the MAJCOM task standards (critical, significant, or 
minor), the respective Superintendents and NCOICs (Command and Control 
Operations/Quality Assurance) is responsible for monitoring and validating that 
training objectives are met and training is both effective and efficient (T-2). 
 
 
72 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
7.11.1.2.3.  The Training NCOIC will de-brief evaluations with the controller (or 
controller team) (T-2).  The Superintendents or NCOICs (Command and Control 
Operations/Quality Assurance) will conduct a one-on-one debrief of the Quality 
Assurance evaluation with the Training NCOIC (T-2).

Chapter 8 
CONTINGENCY DEPLOYMENTS 
8.1.  This chapter establishes Command and Control Operations deployments, contingency 
training, and contingency management of the Command Post Air and Space Expeditionary 
Force process.  It also identifies the Unit Tasking Codes for each Command and Control 
Operations skill level. 
8.2.  Contingency Deployments. 
8.2.1.  In support of crises and contingencies, the USAF and Command Post career field are 
committed to providing forces where and when needed throughout the world.  Preparing 
Command Post personnel for deployment is necessary and entails requirements and actions 
to be completed; also known as personnel readiness responsibilities. 
8.2.2.  Command and Control Operations personnel will complete all required items given by 
the Unit Deployment Managers to ensure they achieve maximum readiness IAW Airman’s 
Manual,, Section 2 (T-1). 
8.3.  Contingency Training. 
8.3.1.  The Career Field Manager and MAJCOM Functional Managers are encouraged to 
attend the Contingency Wartime Planning Course, at Maxwell AFB, AL.  This course 
provides senior leaders and managers with a foundation of knowledge in Joint and AF 
contingency and deliberate planning processes and systems. 
8.4.  Contingency Management.    Contingency management ensures personnel and equipment 
are properly sourced to meet the demands of wartime/contingency operations.  Based on 
Command Post Manager’s inputs, MAJCOM Functional Managers posture all MAJCOM 1C3X1 
resources in Unit Type Code Availability.  AFPC/DPW recommends sourcing of resources to 
meet worldwide-contingency requirements, based upon what is postured within the AEF Time 
Phased Force Deployment Data Library.  MAJCOM Functional Managers validate AFPC/DPW 
recommendations, and then the tasking flows to the unit via a Joint Operations Planning and 
Execution System Levy. 
8.4.1.  AEF Assignment. 
8.4.1.1.  All controllers will be assigned an AEFI.  Ensure each Airman knows the 
specific AEF period they are assigned (T-1).  This provides each Airman with stability 
and predictability of their AEF deployment window. 
8.4.1.2.  Command Post Managers will assign controllers, by name, to a specific Unit 
Type Code and ensure controllers know which AEF period they are assigned to within 15 
days of arrival on station IAW AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and 
Execution.  Command Post Managers should have access to the deployment readiness 
reporting program to ensure controllers are assigned to the correct AEF period. 
8.4.1.2.1.  Command Post Managers should ensure their resources (controllers) are 
evenly distributed across all AEF periods, to prevent being over-tasked in a single 
period, as well as providing AFPC/DP2W personnel in every period. 
74 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
8.4.1.2.2.  Before placing a controller in a AEF period, Command Post Managers 
should consider factors such as the member’s date arrived station, previous 
deployments, and any other factors which may impact their ability to deploy in an 
assigned AEF period.  Once assigned to an AEF period, the member remains in that 
AEF period, IAW AFI 10-401. 
8.5.  Command Post Deployment Critique.    MAJCOM Functional Managers will ensure all 
superintendents and personnel at locations with three or fewer Controllers returning from a 
deployment complete a Command Post Deployment Critique Form (Attachment 4) within 30 
calendar days of returning to duty (T-2).  Critiques are sent to the MAJCOM Functional 
Manager.  MAJCOM Functional Managers forward all critiques to the Career Field Manager for 
review and action.  If requested, MAJCOM Functional Managers/Career Field Manager must 
provide a response to returning personnel within 30 days of submittal (T-1).

contingency, and wartime operations. Provides fuel and time optimized computer flight plans 
using an online system of track libraries, international navigational aids library, remote terminal 
request and dissemination procedures, and current weather forecasts. 
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)—Airlift service provided for the movement of patients by AMC 
aircraft assigned for aeromedical evacuation purposes. 
80 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF)—An organization comprised of air and space 
capabilities that provides tailored force packages to meet combatant commander needs across the 
full spectrum of military operations.  AEFs are inherently capable of performing one or more of 
the AF’s basic functions:  Counterair, counterspace, counterland, countersea, strategic attack, 
counterinformation, Command and Control, airlift, air refueling, spacelift, space support, special 
operations employment, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat search and 
rescue.  The fundamental underpinning to the sustained execution of these functions is the AF’s 
ability to provide the full complement of Expeditionary Combat Support forces. 
Air Mobility Control Center—is the functional name for the Command and Control flight that 
is a part of each AMS.  Air Mobility Control Centers provide Command and Control support at 
key enroute locations.  Normally Overseas CONUS Air Mobility Control Centers manage all 
aircraft and aircrews operating AMC and AMC-gained missions through their location.  
Assigned personnel monitor strategic mobility missions, report mission movement, and 
coordinate ground support activities to include maintenance, aerial port services, and aircrew 
support for all AMC and AMC-gained missions transiting their station. 
Air Mobility Division—The Air Mobility Division of an Air Operations Center plans, 
coordinates, tasks, and executes air mobility operations for the Commander Air Force 
Forces/Joint Force Air Combat Commander.  As one of the five divisions of the Air Operations 
Center under the Air Operations Center Director, the Air Mobility Division provides integration 
and support of all JOA air mobility missions.  The Air Mobility Division Chief ensures the 
division effectively participates in the Air Operations Center planning and execution process.  
The Air Operations Center director provides policy and guidance to the Air Mobility Division 
regarding the air and space planning and execution process.  The Air Mobility Division tasks 
intratheater air mobility forces through wing and unit Command Posts when those forces operate 
from home bases, and through applicable forward Command and Control nodes.  The Air 
Mobility Division usually consists of the following four teams: the air mobility control team, the 
airlift control team, the air refueling control team, and the aeromedical evacuation control team.  
The Director of Mobility Forces should be collocated in the Air Operations Center to facilitate 
their close working relationship with the Air Mobility Division. 
Air Operations Center—The senior agency of the AF component commander that provides 
Command and Control of AF air and space operations and coordinates with other components 
and services. 
Augmented Aircrew—A basic aircrew supplemented by additional aircrew members to permit 
in-flight rest periods.  At a minimum, an augmented crew provides for in-flight rest for 
crewmembers, if they are authorized and required for aircraft being flown or missions being 
performed. 
Authentication—A security measure designed to protect a communication system against the 
acceptance of fraudulent transmission or simulation by establishing the validity of a message, 
transmission, or originator. 
Change of Operational Control—The date and time (Greenwich Mean Time-GMT) at which 
the responsibility for operational control of a force or unit passes from one operational control 
authority to another.  The Change of Operational Control point is the geographical position 
where responsibility for operational control of a mission is transferred. 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
81 
CLOSE HOLD Missions—Certain highly sensitive missions that require special handling, 
limited access, and modification to normal Command and Control procedures. 
CLOSE WATCH Missions—Term used to ensure designated missions receive special 
attention, all possible actions are taken to ensure on-time accomplishment, and users are notified 
when delays occur or can be anticipated. 
Command and Control—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated 
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission.  Command 
and Control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, 
communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, 
coordinating, and controlling forces/operations in the accomplishment of the mission. 
Command and Control System—The facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and 
personnel essential to a commander for planning, directing, and controlling operations of 
assigned forces pursuant to the mission. 
Command Center—The Command Center serves as the HHQ full-time 24/7 Command and 
Control node.  The Command Center is a direct representative of the HHQ commander and 
serves as the focal point of the HHQ operation, and as such receives and disseminates laterally, 
up and down the chain-of-command, orders, information, and requests necessary for the 
Command and Control of assigned forces and operations. 
Command Post (CP)—The Command Post serves as one of the Installation Command and 
Control full-time 24/7 Command and Control nodes, directly responsible to the installation 
commander for Installation Command and Control.  The Command Post is a direct representative 
of the (installation) commander and serves as the focal point of the unit operation, and as such 
receives and disseminates orders, information, and requests necessary for the Command and 
Control of assigned forces and operations. 
Command Post Managers—The Chief and Superintendent directly in charge of the Command 
Post. 
NOTE:—Unless specifically addressed, the use of the term Command Post Managers in this 
AFMAN implies actions may be completed by either the Chief or Superintendent. 
Contingency Response Group—Contingency Response Groups are designed to be first 
responders for opening airbases.  These units will bridge the gap between the seizure forces and 
the follow-on combat/expeditionary combat support forces.  Contingency Response Groups are 
critical to the AF’s ability to rapidly deploy U.S. military forces and initiate air operations of any 
type in minimal time at any base or location around the globe.  Contingency Response Groups 
may also provide Command and Control, aerial port services, quick turn maintenance, force 
protection and various airbase support capabilities for AMC’s Global Mobility mission.  The 
Contingency Response Group Concept of Operations and AFI 10-202, Contingency Response 
Groups, describe Contingency Response Group operations. 
Crisis Action Team—A staff formed by the commander to plan, direct, and coordinate forces in 
response to contingencies, crises, natural/manmade disasters, or wartime situations.  The Crisis 
Action Team develops courses of action and executes the commander's and HHQ’s directives.  
The composition and function of the Crisis Action Team is largely mission driven and therefore 
a MAJCOM or unit commander prerogative.  However, membership for the Crisis Action Team 
82 
AFMAN 10-207  11 APRIL 2018 
is most frequently a combination of the commander’s senior staff and special staff which 
includes a Command Post representative.  The composition of a Crisis Action Team varies 
according to the situation. 
Defense Readiness Reporting System —is a platform used to report resources and capabilities.

needed to plan assigned sorties is accurate, complete, and de-conflicted; create risk-mitigated 
flight plans; file flight plans with Air Traffic Service, prepare, publish, and transmit accurate and 
complete Aircrew Departure Papers (ADPs), provide verbal departure briefings to aircrews when 
contacted by the aircrew, flight watch the sortie from takeoff to landing assisting aircrews in 
execution as required, and coordinate sortie mission issues with appropriate authorities.  They 
serve as the focal point of a centralized support network which proactively monitors the sortie’s 
operational environment, predicatively analyzes changes in key information elements that could 
pose hazards/risks to sortie success, derives alternatives and pushes actionable plans (dynamic 
re-tasking) to the aircrew and Aircrew Aircraft Tasking System (AATS). 
Force Protection Condition—The system is a program standardizing the military services 
identification of, and recommended responses to terrorist threats against U.S. personnel and 
facilities.  Force Protection Conditions are declared IAW AFI 31-101.  Complete descriptions 
and measures are detailed in AFI 10—245, Antiterrorism. 
Global Decision Support System—is used for MAF and SOF aircraft worldwide.  It is also 
used by CAF for selected missions.  It is capable of unclassified/classified operations and 
interfaces with 29 systems, to include Global Command and Control System-J and Theater Battle 
Management Core Systems, and accessed via a Web application URL.  AMC is the lead 
command, responsible for Global Decision Support System development, testing, fielding, 
requirements, and application training.

attacks against our information infrastructure.  Information Operations Conditions will be 
established to defend against a different type of warfare that is not limited to physical 
boundaries.  Information Operations Conditions address protection of AF assets against 
electronic offensive actions and defensive countermeasures, jamming, and denial of service.  
They will also prompt the response to generate offensive forces and detail defensive 
countermeasures.  An Information Operations Condition establishes specific alert levels and 
defines graduated response AF commanders must take at all organizational levels. 
Installation Commander—The individual typically responsible for maintaining and operating 
an installation, normally the host unit commander. 
Installation Command and Control—The Installation Command and Control construct 
provides the commander of a USAF home station or a deployed AEW/AEG to an expeditionary 
base with a single, consolidated Command and Control center from which to monitor, assess, 
plan, and execute the full range of installation activities.  A key function of Installation 
Command and Control is the Command Post; other key Installation Command and Control 
functions may include the Crisis Action Team, Maintenance Operations Center, Emergency 
Operations Center, Base Defense Operations Center, Fire (911), and a basic intelligence 
function.  Regardless of physical location, all Installation Command and Control nodes should be 
linked virtually (virtual Installation Command and Control) to expedite information flow during 
disasters/contingencies. 
International Civil Aviation Organization Codes—Four letter codes that identify specific 
locations.  The first letter indicates the International Civil Aviation Organization region and the 
nation/location by the last three letters.  All Continental US codes begin with "K."  (For example:  
"KCHS" designates Charleston AFB and "KDOV" stands for Dover AFB.)  This listing also 
includes Encode and Decode listings, e.g., 4-letter code to airport and airport to 4-letter code. 
Mission Management—The function of organizing, planning, directing, and controlling airlift
