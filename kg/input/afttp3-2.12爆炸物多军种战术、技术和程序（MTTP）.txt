EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
EO 
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (MTTP) for Explosive Ordnance 
establishes tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for planning, recognizing, 
reacting to, and reporting explosive ordnance found in the operational environment. 
Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) units are responsible for render safe, exploitation, 
clearance, and disposal of explosive ordnance. Army engineer and explosive ordnance 
clearance agents (EOCA) may dispose limited, known, single unexploded explosive 
ordnance (UXO) by detonation (blow-in-place). Primarily, combat engineer units are 
responsible for breaching and clearing land-based minefields. Personnel not specifically 
trained in explosive ordnance (EO) should mark and report EO hazards using the 
methods prescribed by this publication. 
This MTTP publication does not address improvised explosive device (IED) procedures. 
Although a component of an IED may include explosive ordnance, commanders should 
refer to EOD specialists on their staff, joint publications, Service regulations, and 
theater-specific guidance for IED mitigation TTP. 
Military operations use explosive ordnance that affect mobility, personnel, equipment, 
facilities, and mission accomplishment. Understanding the impact of explosive 
ordnance, when they pose a hazard, and the procedures used to minimize their effects 
can maximize the efficiency of resources available during operations. Establishing 
procedures and training the force to react to these hazards enhances joint force 
capabilities. This publication contains TTP to mitigate explosive ordnance threats. 
Specifically, it: 
•
Describes the EO hazards to friendly forces and provides information for operations.
•
Provides guidelines for planning, recognizing, reporting, marking, and taking
immediate action when encountering explosive ordnance.
•
Provides commanders several options for applying protective measures against EO
hazards.
•
Delineates the roles of EOD, EOCAs, and combat engineer units regarding EO
hazards.
•
Describes Service-specific EO missions and capabilities.

NOTE 
Explosive ordnance (EO) training considerations for unit standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) should align with procedures 
outlined in this multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures 
(MTTP) publication. Units should conduct EO awareness training 
concurrently with pre-deployment individual and collective skills 
training. Also, units should conduct continuation training 
throughout operational deployments to remain proficient with EO 
hazard recognition, reaction procedures, and reporting. Explosive 
ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel can assist with unit EO 
awareness training. 
Chapter I 
PLANNING AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
1. Introduction
a. The presence of EO in an operational area constitutes a hazard that often affects
mission accomplishment. Although EO may not pose an immediate threat to mission
accomplishment, EO may cause needless loss of life and materiel.
b. This MTTP publication familiarizes commanders and their personnel with EO and
how to plan for, recognize, react to, and report EO encountered in the operational
environment. Discussions in this MTTP publication follow these definitions:
(1) EO. All munitions containing explosives, nuclear fission or fusion materials,
and biological and chemical agents. This includes bombs and warheads; guided
and ballistic missiles; artillery, mortar, rocket, and small arms ammunition;
grenades; all mines, torpedoes, and depth charges; demolition charges;
pyrotechnics; clusters and dispensers; cartridge and propellant actuated devices;
electro-explosive devices; clandestine and improvised explosive devices (IEDs).
(National Defense Authorization Act)
(2) Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO). EO which has been primed, fuzed,
armed, or otherwise prepared for action and has been fired, dropped, launched,
projected, or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard to operations,
installations, personnel, or material and remains unexploded either by
malfunction or design or for any other cause. (Joint Publication [JP] 3-42, Joint
Explosive Ordnance Disposal)
c. All personnel must be properly trained and able to identify and react to EO
hazards to survive on the battlefield. Units should identify areas expected to contain
EO during intelligence preparation of the operational environment/battlespace
planning. Supporting intelligence, artillery, and air liaison personnel can provide this
information. The expected presence of EO affects the scheme of movement,
maneuver, and force protection. Personnel must arrange for appropriate EOD and
2 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 0$5 
engineer support to mitigate the hazard. This chapter discusses planning 
considerations for EO hazard mitigation during operations. 
Explosive Ordnance Operations on Today’s Battlefield 
The United States (US) establishes presence for a joint task force (JTF) 
embarked aboard amphibious warfare ships with a mission to conduct operations 
from expeditionary advanced bases within the contested littorals of the theater. 
Joint intelligence preparation of the operational environment has prepared 
commanders with information on offensive and defensive explosive ordnance 
capabilities and initial planning for their employment to enable a scheme of 
maneuver. The JTF uses a system of unmanned vehicles to detect and identify 
submerged, buried, and exposed EO from amphibious warfare ships to 
expeditionary advanced bases and littoral objectives. The JTF common 
operational picture is updated and navigation lanes are transmitted to 
multidomain support, combat, and tactical systems. 
During the initial phases of the operation, information on defensive EO is 
transmitted to maneuver units, engineers, and explosive ordnance disposal 
teams. Elements move in support of the ground scheme of maneuver to 
neutralize dense patterns of EO or exploit anomalous threats to increase 
awareness. Other teams maneuver to reconnoiter and clear EO from restrictive 
terrain, potential landing zones, and inland waterways with systems to enable 
maneuver. Information on offensive and defensive EO is reported to intelligence 
centers for fusion and analysis. 
As the operation continues, the number of improvised EO increases, challenging 
operations in a congested urban environment. Integrated systems counter these 
attacks and target enemy networks with speed and lethality due to increased 
situational understanding. Unmanned systems leverage artificial intelligence to 
detect, locate, and identify defensive EO and transmit information to intelligence 
cells to expand the knowledge base of the EO network. 
As the mission transitions from offensive to security operations, elements enable 
offensive action and logistics operations by detecting and clearing mobility 
corridors, landing zones, and main supply routes of defensive EO to maintain 
ground lines of communication. The growing information base on EO exploited to 
identify the forces that employ them enables continued offensive action to reduce 
the EO, reinforce partner nation security, and strengthen the strategic alliance.

2. EO Threat Environment Hazards
a. Hazards to Dismounted Forces. EO poses a great risk to dismounted forces. To
reduce this risk, dismounted forces must be aware of reported EO and understand
procedures for avoiding, recognizing, reacting to, and reporting EO hazards
appropriately.
b. Hazards to Nonarmored Vehicles. Nonarmored vehicles are vulnerable to
damage and destruction from EO. Nonarmored vehicle occupants face similar risk of
injury from EO as dismounted forces.
c. Hazards to Combat Vehicles. Armored combat vehicles (such as tanks, armored
personnel carriers, and Bradley fighting vehicles) offer variable protection against
EO. Although some EO disable armored vehicles by breaking tracks or flattening
tires, other EO may cause catastrophic injury and vehicle loss. Therefore, armored
crews can reduce risk of injury from some EO hazard areas by remaining mounted.
Consider the potential type, size, and quantity of EO likely to be present in a hazard
area when assessing risk to force.
d. Hazards to Aviation Forces. EO poses a risk to air assault and aviation forces.
Aviation units should be aware of potential EO hazard areas and conduct a thorough
reconnaissance and a preliminary area sweep for EO before occupying assembly
areas and forward arming and refueling points, or conducting casualty evacuation
tasks and other operations.
e. The following are impacts of EO on air operations:
(1) Launching, recovering, and supporting aircraft.
(2) Receiving combat forces and their movement to forward areas.
(3) Moving materiel, replacement personnel, and support forces.
(4) Evacuating patients, other casualties, and human remains.
(5) Evacuating United States (US) nationals, other noncombatants, and allied
and coalition partners.
(6) Evacuating enemy prisoners of war, dislocated civilians, detainees, and
refugees.
(7) Retrograding materiel.
f. Hazards to Waterborne Vehicles. EO can cause significant damage to certain
types of landing craft and inflict casualties on embarked personnel. Mines can deny
DANGER
Failure to recognize and plan for explosive hazards in the 
operational environment could cause unnecessary deaths, 
casualties, and loss of material.
4 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 0$5 
access to selected landing sites and sea lanes. Mitigating such hazards before 
landing forces requires adequate planning and resources allocation. 
g. Hazards to Civilians and Civil Infrastructure. EO poses a significant hazard to
civilians and infrastructure in the area of operations (AO), and can create significant,
undesirable, diplomatic, economic, and information impacts. Most civilians are
unfamiliar with military ordnance and are unaware of the hazard EO presents.
Therefore, civilians, children in particular, sometimes pick up and handle EO items
with devastating effects. For example, in an effort to reclaim homes and reestablish
lives during post conflict operations, local civilians may collect and return hazardous
EO items to US forces. Additionally, buried EO kills civilians performing routine
activities, such as walking or digging. The EO threat to civilian personnel may
continue long after cessation of military operations.
3. Operational Planning Considerations
a. When planning to conduct operations in an EO environment, commanders and
staffs should support EO operations with security, logistic support, safe holding
areas, and disposal sites.
b. Commanders and staffs should plan for the exploitation of EO. The technical
information on munitions and weapons systems generated during this process is
critical to providing updated threat analysis, informing threat mitigation best practices
and force protection guidance, and supporting attribution. For additional information
see JP 3-42, Joint Explosive Ordnance Disposal, and Navy Tactics, Techniques,
and Procedures (NTTP) 3-10.4.1, Navy Expeditionary, Technical Exploitation.
c. General EO planning considerations include the following:
(1) The impact of EO on current and future military operations including:
(a) Terrain.
(b) Timing.
(c) Positioning forces.
(d) Routes for movement and maneuver.
(e) Force protection.
(2) Identification of known EO locations and densities.
(3) Leverage existing capabilities and emerging technology to conduct explosive
ordnance reconnaissance (EOR), clearance, and exploitation operations such as:
(a) Electronics maintenance personnel.
(b) Nondestructive inspectors.
(c) Cyberspace warfare personnel.
(d) Signals intelligence analysts.
(4) Method for reporting the location of found EO to facilitate response by

(5) Increased personnel and logistical requirements due to enablers and
associated vehicles and equipment.
(6) Designation of recovery, disposal, and safe holding areas.
(7) Provision and construction of protective measures.
(8) Destruction of EO to mitigate threat to friendly forces and civilians, and
preclude recovery and use by enemy forces/hostile actors.
d. EO can limit or prevent access to an area of operation, and inhibit air, ground,
and maritime-based mobility by:
(1) Restricting the use of terrain due to concentrated explosive hazards (EHs),
such as when scatterable munitions are utilized to deny advantageous terrain.
(2) Reducing momentum (to include speed, maneuver, and rates of march) due
to EHs encountered on avenues of approach.
(3) Requiring the allocation of trained forces and other resources to conduct time
consuming clearance and marking of lanes.
(4) Increasing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance personnel and
equipment requirements.
(5) Reducing combat effectiveness due to attrition of personnel and equipment.
e. Variables affecting the degree of risk include:
(1) Type, size, and quantity of EO employed by enemy and friendly forces.
(2) Protection available to personnel, equipment, and facilities (such as armored
vehicles versus dismounted infantry, sheltered aircraft versus exposed aircraft, or
fortified positions versus no fortified positions).
(3) Mission and degree of mobility required.
(4) Terrain and climatic conditions.
(5) Threat from direct or indirect fire while securing the site.
4. Enabler Support Considerations
a. Enabler support is critical to operations in an EO environment and should be
planned for and requested if these enablers are not organic. The following enablers
all play significant roles during EO operations:
(1) EOD support.
(2) Explosive ordnance clearance agent (EOCA) technicians.
(3) Military criminal investigative organization (MCIO) special agents, intelligence
analysts, and forensic specialists. Service-specific MCIOs are:
(a) Air Force Office of Special Investigations.
(b) Army Criminal Investigative Division.
(c) Marine Corps Criminal Investigative Division.

(a) EOD.
(b) Weapons intelligence teams.
(c) Combined explosives exploitation cell.
(d) Forensic exploitation laboratory.
(e) Exploitation attribution center.
b. Enabler Support Planning Considerations.
(1) Security for technical enablers.
(2) Equipment for enablers such as:
(a) Specialized armored vehicles.
(b) Communications support.
(c) Unmanned system support.
(d) EO exploitation tools and equipment. (See JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence, and
JP 3-42).
(e) Airfield damage repair (ADR) personnel and support.
(f) Signals intelligence analysts.
5. Planning Roles and Responsibilities
a. The commander is responsible for planning, directing, managing, and executing
the joint EO mission, which may include coordination with host-nation personnel.
Prior to operational commitment, unit commanders should ensure forces receive EO
hazard recognition training and immediate-action training, including hazard
reporting. Commanders, at all levels, maintain situational awareness of EO in their
AO via individual spot reports, EOD 9-line reports, intelligence reports, and obstacle
overlays.
b. The supported commander’s guidance may address specific considerations for
EO hazards. During operational planning, additions to a commander’s primary staff
should include EOD, engineer, and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear
(CBRN) officers, to take advantage of their ordnance, mine clearing, and breaching
expertise.

ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 
7 
c. When required, forming a standalone or subordinate EOD JTF to execute EOD
functions as its primary mission may occur. These JTFs control two or more Service- 
component EOD organizations, via operational or tactical control of attached units,
to support the joint operations area. The EOD JTF commander analyzes the mission
and recommends EOD and enabler employment options to accomplish assigned
missions to the senior joint force commander. See JP 3-42 for additional information.
d. EO hazards are likely to exist during all phases of an operation. Commanders
and their staffs must consider responses to EO during planning.
e. Planning staffs have assigned EOD; engineer; intelligence; and CBRN personnel.
They provide detailed information on available EO capabilities and intelligence
regarding enemy EO capabilities and intent in the AO.
(1) It is the EOD staff officer’s responsibility for planning, recognizing, reacting,
reporting, rendering safe, recovering, exploiting, and disposing EO. The EOD
staff officer leverages the coordinating staff to:
(a) Provide recommendations to the commander on the employment of EOD
assets in support of operations.
(b) Support operational planning related to EO operations.
(c) Advise and coordinate Service, multinational partner, and civilian EOD
resources.
(d) Manage EOD incident reporting procedures and oversight.
(e) Assist in intelligence analysis of the EO hazard.
(f) Support identity operations to assist in the development of threat networks
that attribute activities to those networks.
(g) Review the ordnance order of battle.
(h) Support EO collection and reporting requirements and liaises with
appropriate intelligence agencies.
(2) The engineer officer’s responsibilities include:
(a) Providing recommendations to the commander on the employment of
combat engineering (i.e., mobility, counter-mobility, and survivability), general
engineering, and geospatial engineering capabilities in support of joint
operations.
(b) Planning, reporting, and tracking barriers and obstacles.
(c) Planning for the removal of obstacles.
(d) Receiving, consolidating, and disseminating obstacle information to the
staff and affected units.
(e) Incorporating known hazard area information onto the obstacle overlay.

ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 0$5 
(f) Maintaining all reports and historical data on obstacles and hazard areas
for use during current and future operations.
(g) Tracking all known obstacles and EO with assistance from the EOD staff
officer.
(h) ATP 3-34.20/MCRP 10-10.1, Countering Explosive Hazards, for more
details on specific engineer planning and tasks.
(3) The CBRN officer or noncommissioned officer develops procedures for
monitoring survey and decontamination hotline support to EOD efforts for CBRN
device detection, identification, recovery, evaluation, and final disposition in
coordination with the EOD staff officer.
(4) The intelligence officer integrates EO planning into the overall intelligence
picture for force protection and collection. This can include (see JP 2-0 for further
details):
(a) Coordination with the intelligence community (IC) technical exploitation.
(b) Integrating EO reports into the intelligence common operational picture
(COP).
(c) Planning for and collecting biometrics and forensics including chemical,
engineering, mechanical, or trace material exploitation.
(d) Electronic or digital exploitation.
(e) CBRN defense support.
(5) The mine countermeasures commander controls the operations of mine
countermeasures (MCM) forces (surface MCM vessels, airborne MCM squadrons
and detachments, and underwater MCM elements) in the operational area.
(6) EOD Support to Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UASs).
(a) There is no single solution to countering the low-slow-small, unmanned
aircraft system (UAS) threat. Training the force to recognize and neutralize
low-slow-small UAS threats prior to an attack is the preferred method but is
not always feasible. If an air attack is imminent, the commander should use
the most efficient method available to protect the unit and minimize effects.
Combined arms forces must maintain flexibility in their options to quickly
recognize and counter the effects from enemy low-slow-small UAS.
Ultimately, achieving the best C-UAS defense is through proper planning,
training, coordination, and execution of unit training strategies. The maneuver
force must plan, train, and execute operations as an integrated combined
arms team employing all forms of passive air defense techniques when active
air defense is limited or not available.

ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 
9 
(b) While C-UAS is not solely an EOD operation, the use of these systems is
to deliver payloads of various sizes and functions, and low-slow-small UAS
may become the responsibility of EOD. Either because of their own internal
C-UAS operations or by being requested to respond in an emergency
capacity by another unit in the area. EOD personnel must ensure they
practice the utmost safety when encountering a downed UAS platform,
regardless of size, because of the multitude of hazards associated with the
payloads and the system itself, treating the entire package as an IED
operation.
Note: Refer to JP 3-42, Joint Explosive Ordnance Disposal; JP 3-34, Joint Engineer 
Operations; JP 3-15, Barriers, Obstacles, and Mines in Joint Operations; JP 3-11, 
Operations in Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environments; and JP 2-0 
Joint Intelligence, for more on these roles and responsibilities. 
6. EO Incident Site Command and Control (C2)
a. When establishing guidance for EO activities, the senior commander should
ensure subordinate commanders understand the following responsibilities.
b. The incident commander:
(1) Establishes and maintains an initial cordon of the area containing the EO.
(2) Upon EOD team arrival, adjusts the cordon (as needed) to facilitate EOD
activities.
(3) Ensures inner cordon access is coordinated with the on-scene EOD team
leader.
(4) Collaborates with MCIO special agents and intelligence specialists to ensure
timely exchange of threat intelligence critical to inform tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTP), preservation of evidence/testimonial integrity for potential
judicial proceedings, and identification of larger threat networks/impending
secondary attacks.
c. The EOD team leader is the operational authority for all explosive-related issues
within the inner cordon during an EOD mission. This ensures the safety of the EOD
team and personnel in the surrounding area. The EOD team leader advises the
incident commander on:
(1) Security and safety requirements for on-scene activities, including use and
positioning of all electronic countermeasures and communications equipment.
(2) Options available to mitigate the EO.
(3) Risks involved in mitigating the EO.
WARNING 
When approaching a downed UAS take necessary precautions for 
unknown inhalation hazards.

DANGER
Leaders, at all levels, are responsible for ensuring personnel 
are aware of and trained to react appropriately to explosive 
ordnance. Failure to train personnel properly can result in 
death or injury.
WARNING
DO NOT continue movement towards a suspected explosive 
hazard. Some types of ordnance have magnetic or motion- 
sensitive fuzing and will detonate if they sense a target. Others 
may have built-in, self-destruct timers. Once you recognize EO, 
STOP, leave the area by the same path you entered, and make 
necessary observations with binoculars or other optical devices.
DO NOT move or remove anything on or near EO. It may contain 
a firing pin under spring tension or be a component of an IED.
NEVER move, jar, strike, or touch EO.
ALWAYS transmit communications emitters from a minimum safe 
distance of 100 feet (30 meters). EO may be highly susceptible to 
detonation via electromagnetic radiation emanating from 
communication devices.
Chapter II
RECOGNIZING EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE
1. Introduction
a. There is a multitude of EO on the battlefield and all EO has the potential to
become a hazard to friendly forces. Friendly forces may create as many EO hazards
as the enemy. Commanders and staffs should train their forces to recognize and
minimize EO impacts on current and future operations.
b. Recognizing EO is the first and most important step in reacting appropriately to
an EO hazard. Accurate recognition is critical to force protection and mitigating
associated risks to mission accomplishment. This chapter discusses general
identifying features of common US and foreign ordnance types encountered by units
during operations.

ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 0$5
DANGER
Avoid the area where explosive ordnance is located. Upon 
identification of a submunition, leave the area by the same path 
you entered. There may be many more submunitions in the same 
area. Small size does not diminish the danger of submunitions.
Many types of explosive ordnance may contain an incendiary (fire 
producing), chemical, or biological hazard in addition to 
explosives.
Training and practice ordnance may contain explosives.
2. EO Hazards
a. EO is classified and reported according to the ordnance’s employment method.
EO hazards can exist both above and below water. The five main types of EO are
dropped, projected, placed, possible IED, or thrown.
(1) Dropped. Dropped ordnance encompasses five subgroups: bombs,
dispensers (which contain submunitions), submunitions, sea mines, and
torpedoes. Figure 1 depicts examples of dropped ordnance.
Figure 1. Examples of Dropped Ordnance
(2) Projected. Projected ordnance encompasses five subgroups: projectiles,
mortars, rockets, guided missiles, and rifle grenades. Figure 2 depicts examples
of projected ordnance.

c. Unknown. If EO does not clearly meet one of these categories the type should be
reported as unknown with as much other information as possible. Report for
example:
(1) Suspected placement by unmanned or robotic systems via land, air, or water.
(2) Any notable characteristics that may help identify which category the EO
belongs.
DANGER 
NEVER approach a thrown grenade that did not detonate even if 
you threw the grenade. DO NOT move, jar, or disturb it. The fuse 
may function at any time. NEVER pick up, move, or disturb a 
found grenade even if the spoon or safety pin is attached and the 
grenade is in the original packaging. The grenade may be booby- 
trapped to explode.

gain any additional information beyond first observation. Since 
unknown explosive ordnance could be any of these categories it 
must be treated with the same caution and only be further 
investigated by trained explosive ordnance disposal.

Chapter III 
REACTING TO EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE 
1. Introduction
a. EO encountered in the AO can adversely affect mission accomplishment. This
chapter discusses the required individual and unit-level reactions and capabilities to
minimize the effects of EO. Figure 6 depicts these reactions and capabilities.
Figure 6. EO Reaction Capabilities 
18 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 0$5 
b. Balancing risk-to-force and mission accomplishment are inherent to any course of
action. Commanders must consider the objectives of the current phase of operations
when determining the appropriate reaction to EO.
c. When an EO hazard remains from a recent enemy attack, consider protecting
personnel and equipment by evacuating the area. Avoiding or bypassing the UXO is
the safest option for personnel and equipment. If mission parameters do not allow
avoiding or bypassing the hazard, take protective measures to reduce the risk to
personnel and equipment. Regardless, units must properly mark the location of UXO
in accordance with unit SOPs.
d. Staffs must consider the collection of information from EO to update threat
awareness (intelligence preparation of the operational environment), support
attribution, directed information collection requirements to develop network analysis,
limit enemy and adversary advantage, and assist in countermeasure development.
2. Protective Measures
a. There are three methods for protecting personnel and equipment: evacuate,
isolate, and barricade.
(1) Evacuate. Evacuating nonessential personnel and equipment is the best
protective measure. Evacuation distances, depicted in table 1, provide a
reasonable degree of safety for barricaded personnel and equipment. It is
important to note, these distances rely on an accurate estimate of the amount of
explosive filler in the EO. Using protective barricades around the EO can reduce
the distances depicted in table 1.

(a) The general rule for estimating blast effects from the amount of explosive
in an ordnance item is to assume 50 percent of the total ordnance weight
0$5 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 
19 
equals the net explosive weight. For example, the calculation for a 500-pound 
bomb would result in an estimate of 250 pounds of explosive. According to 
table 1, the safe distance for unprotected personnel is 637.5 meters 
(interpolated from averaging the values for 200 and 300 pounds explosive 
weight in the table). 
(b) After evacuating personnel and equipment, keep movement within the EO
area to essential operations only. If evacuating equipment is not possible,
allow only mission essential personnel in the area to operate it. Have
personnel employ personal protective equipment and protect equipment with
barricades.
(2) Isolate. When it is not possible to evacuate people or equipment due to
mission-related or other reasons, isolate the assets from EO by establishing a
safe area and limiting exposure. Contact EOD, if personnel must work in an area
where EO may be present.
(3) Barricade. If a unit is stationary, evacuate all nonessential personnel and
equipment out of the EO hazard area. When equipment must remain in place,
protect it with barricades. In addition to wearing personal protective equipment,
units can protect personnel by reinforcing fighting positions on the side facing the
EO and adding overhead cover to frontal protection: See appendix C for further
guidance.
3. Immediate Action
a. Units encountering EO should take immediate action (i.e., use confirm, clear,
cordon, check, and control [5-Cs]) to mitigate delays to mission accomplishment.
Immediate actions consist of a layered approach depending upon the current phase
of the operation and the size, type, quantity, and location of EO. Following the 5-Cs
will assist in dealing with the EO situation quickly and safely. Figure 7 depicts an
immediate action decision tree to assist the decision-making process.
(1) CONFIRM the presence of the suspected EO from a safe distance, when
possible, and with the maximum use of hard-cover and spotting equipment.
Never compromise safety for positive identification of the item.
(2) CLEAR all personnel from the area to a tactically safe distance. Conduct 5-
and 25-meter checks of the area for secondary hazards as a secondary
detonation may be imminent. The minimum safe distance for exposed personnel
is 300 meters from EO or in accordance with table 1.
(3) CORDON off the danger area to all vehicles and foot traffic and establish an
incident control point to prevent entry of unauthorized personnel. Mission, enemy,
terrain and weather, troops and support available—time available (METT-T)
determines the size of the cordon.
(4) CHECK the immediate area for secondary devices using the 5- and 25-
meter checks. Expand the search area as time and the hazard permit.
(5) CONTROL the area inside the cordon to ensure only authorized personnel
(i.e., EOD, medical, or firefighting) have access. Maintain security at the
20 
established safe distance while maximizing available cover to afford protection 
from the hazard.

4. Self-extraction
a. After an indirect fire attack, immediate action drills should include a plan to report
and mark EO.
b. After entering an EO saturated area, evacuate by the same route, marking the
area as the situation permits.
5. Mark UXO
a. Marking a UXO danger area is as important as marking other danger areas (such
as CBRN contaminated, minefield, and booby trapped areas). Mark hazards with
colored triangular signs to indicate the danger involved. Figure 8 depicts the
standard UXO marker. The background is red with a white bomb inset. UXO
markers have the same dimensions as the other military warning markers.
Figure 8. Standard UXO Marker 
b. To identify the location of UXO, place UXO markers above ground, at waist level
(about three feet), with the bomb pointing down. Place the marker no closer to the
UXO than the point where UXO is first recognized. Attach the marker to a stake, a
tree, or other suitable holder. Ensure the marker is clearly visible. Figure 9 depicts a
marker attached to a stake.
Figure 9. Marking a UXO with a Standard UXO Marker 
c. Mark all logical approach routes to the area containing UXO. If UXO is near a
road, place a marker on each side of the road approaching the UXO, at a minimum.
If there is a large concentration of UXO, such as submunitions, mark the area the
same as for a scatterable minefield, placing markers approximately every 15 meters
around the area’s perimeter.
22 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 0$5 
d. UXO are hard to detect due to environment, terrain, and weather effects on the
ordnance. Easily identifiable marking assists in keeping others away from a UXO
hazard area. Clear marking also assists the EOD team in finding the UXO area.
e. If standard UXO markers are not available, use other suitable materials (such as
engineer tape or colored ribbons) in accordance with the unit’s SOP. Use a
consistent marking system, when possible, to avoid confusion. When using
improvised marking materials, the same principles used for the standard markers
apply for their placement. Place all markers about three feet off the ground and
easily visible from all approach routes. See figure 10.
Figure 10. Marking UXO with Another Suitable Material 
6. Chemical and Biological Munitions
a. There are additional considerations for unit evacuation procedures when
encountering possible agent dispersion, such as the downwind effect on the area.
Refer to ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44, Multi-Service
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance, for additional information.
b. EOD uses a standard isolation radius and downwind protection zone when
responding to an incident. ATP 4-32, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
Operations, directs responders to create a 381-meter isolation zone around the
response site and a 2,000-meter downwind isolation and evacuation zone as shown
in figure 11.

1. Introduction
Chapter IV 
EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE REPORTING 
Accurately identifying the location of EO is vital to C2 elements when projecting
maneuver, movement, and support to combat units. EO directly affects combat
capabilities of any element encountering the ordnance. Commanders must
implement an effective EO reporting system to allow appropriate concentration and
shifting of EOD, engineer, and CBRN assets to support the commander’s priorities.
2. EOD 9-line Report
a. Purpose. An EOD 9-line report (refer to table 2) is detailed and relays the location
of suspected EO, recommended priority for clearance, and unit affected. The EOD 9
line is the first report sent upon detecting EO and is transmitted by the fastest means
available. The label, EOD 9-line report, also includes all types of EO (i.e., UXO, EO,
and IEDs). In addition to the report requesting EOD support when units encounter
suspected EO, the report assists commander prioritization of resources. Detected
ordnance suspected to involve CBRN agents requires the transmission of a nuclear,
biological, chemical spot report.
b. Routing. Route the EOD 9-line through the chain of command. Each commander
in the incident chain is responsible for setting the proper priority for the report.
Because mission priorities may change to reflect the current tactical situation or
future plans, commanders should remain informed of the status of EO in their AO.
c. Prioritization. The supported unit commander’s guidance establishes EO hazard
reaction priorities. The EOD commander coordinates incident response priorities
with the supported commander’s staff. Table 2 explains the four established incident
priorities for an EOD 9-line.
d. Recommended Priority (IMMEDIATE, INDIRECT, MINOR, or NO HAZARD).
Ensure the recommended priority corresponds with the tactical situation described
on line 7 of the report. These priorities refer only to the EO’s impact on the current
mission. A priority of MINOR or NO HAZARD does not indicate the EO is safe.

Description 
Immediate 
Incidents constituting grave and immediate threats. They stop the unit’s maneuver and 
mission capabilities or threaten vital assets. These incidents are to be given priority over all 
other incidents. EOD procedures are to be started immediately. 
Indirect 
Incidents constituting indirect threats. They slow the unit’s maneuver and mission 
capabilities or threaten important assets. Before beginning EOD procedures, a safe waiting 
period will normally be observed to reduce the threat to EOD personnel. 
Minor 
Incidents constituting a minor threat. They reduce the unit’s maneuver and mission 
capabilities or threaten noncritical assets of value. Typically, EOD personnel will deal with 
these incidents after immediate and indirect incidents, as the situation permits, and with 
minimum threat to personnel. 
No threat 
Incidents constituting no threat at present. These have little or no effect on the unit’s 
capabilities or assets.

EOD and MCIO Mutual Support 
In a forward deployed location, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) responded to 
the report of a downed unmanned aircraft system (UAS). As part of their 
response, they contacted their servicing military criminal investigative 
organization (MCIO) special agents. EOD cleared the site and preserved the 
UAS. MCIO special agents collected the UAS and used available resources 
through partner agencies for forensic analysis. The UAS was sent off to a lab and 
further exploitation provided key information to develop the threat network and 
combat future attacks.

Investigations, June 2022 
3. Follow-on EO Incident Reports and Reporting
a. Hazard mitigation actions, material collection, and reporting conducted by the
EOD teams, engineers, and CBRN elements are critical components to the
exploitation process. Exploitation feeds the intelligence and targeting cycles thereby
increasing the understanding of enemy networks and enabling the development of
target packages.
b. Follow-on incident reporting provides theater-level situational awareness of EO
hazards, establishes trends, and becomes a record of technical facts. While EOD
reporting procedures and formats are similar across the Service components,
submission and dissemination procedures differ. Timely, standardized EO technical
reporting and dissemination provide the joint force the ability to counter EHs.
c. In addition to theater threat exploitation, EO teams play a critical role in
supporting subsequent law enforcement investigations. EO teams and MCIOs must
maintain a mutually supportive relationship to create fusion and a unity of effort in
response to EO incidents ensuring the safety of Department of Defense (DoD)
personnel and resources.

battlefield. EOCA-certified engineers can remotely identify and detonate (blow-in- 
place) explosive hazards (EHs) for which they are trained and authorized.
Produced and approved by the EOD Commandant’s Office and the EOD
Technology Division, respectively, the theater EOD commander publishes the
supplemental EOCA ordnance list as part of the ordnance order of battle. EOCA
capabilities include:
(a) EO Area Marking. EOCA personnel can mark the EO area according to
the standard EH marking system.
(b) Increased Survivability Support. EOCA personnel can support
survivability efforts to isolate the blast and fragmentation danger area of an
identified EO. EOCA personnel also may provide an estimated blast and
fragmentation danger area for items similar to, but not included in, the EOCA
identification guide and supplemental list. EOCAs will advise the on-scene
commander regarding recommended personnel and equipment protective
measures. Commanders should increase survivability efforts to protect
personnel and equipment from the blast effects when personnel must remain
in the hazard area.
(c) EO and IED Disposal. EOCA personnel are authorized to destroy
individual EO identified in the EOCA identification guide, the supplemental
EOCA ordnance list, and theater policy.

4. United States Navy
a. Navy EOD is a combat support force manned, trained, and equipped to eliminate
hazards from UXO, IEDs, WMD, land and water mines, and all other types of
weaponry. Navy EOD provides specially trained, combat-ready, and highly mobile
forces in support of joint force maritime component commands, unified theater
commanders, carrier strike groups, amphibious forces, (SOF), joint interagency
partners, and allies throughout the range of military operations in all domains,
worldwide. Navy Warfare Publication (NWP) 3-10 Navy Expeditionary Combat
Command Forces, JP 3-42 Joint Explosive Ordnance Disposal, and Chief of Naval
Operations Instruction 8027.1H provide detail for Navy EOD-specific operations and
C2 structures. Naval Tactics Techniques and Procedures (NTTP) 3-10.4.1 Navy
Expeditionary Technical Exploitation provides details for Navy EOD and other
expeditionary forces in the collection and exploitation of foreign weapons, EO, and
other collected exploitable material on the battlefield.
(1) A Navy explosive ordnance disposal group (EODGRU) is a deployable
echelon IV, O-6 afloat command and is operationally task-organized under the
appropriate combatant commander and numbered fleet commander. An
EODGRU exercises service authorities, administrative control, and/or OPCON,
over assigned EOD, expeditionary salvage, other Navy Expeditionary Combat
Command (NECC), or joint forces and can form a headquarters staff as the core
of a joint task group or force. The EODGRU can provide C2 of operations at a
level comparable to an Army brigade or Army EOD group. The EODGRU
provides Navy EOD services to the operational commanders through an
explosive ordnance disposal mobile unit (EODMU).
(2) EODMUs are deployable, echelon V, O-5 afloat commands, and are
responsible for the operational readiness of their subordinate EOD unit of action
(referred to as UoA) (companies, platoons [PLTs], and EOD shore-based
detachments [SBDs]). Navy EODMUs C2 joint EOD operations as the
headquarters element for a JTF or an NECC mission-based task organization. In
joint EOD operations, an EODMU provides C2 at a level comparable to an Army
EOD battalion.
(3) Navy EOD SBDs are geographically located at select shore activities where a
full-time requirement for EOD presence exists and are assigned in direct support
of a Navy region and hosted by a Navy installation. EOD SBD capabilities may
differ and they maintain tailored EOD equipment to support their base and Navy
regional commander requirements. The supporting commander is the
commanding officer of the EODMU exercising Service authority and
administrative control over the EOD SBD.
(4) Navy EOD companies are subordinate activities of EODMU. Navy EOD
companies are comprised of two or more EOD PLTs combined with a C2
element.
(5) The Navy EOD PLT is the primary tactical element for Navy EOD and is
assigned under Service authority to a parent EODMU. EOD platoons may be
deployed independently and have the capability to break down into smaller task
0$5 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 
37 
elements depending on mission scope and operational requirements. EOD PLTs 
eliminate conventional explosives, and CBRN hazards from dropped, projected, 
thrown, or placed ordnance. EOD PLT personnel have special training and 
equipment to render EO safe, make intelligence reports on such ordnance, and 
supervise the safe removal thereof. All EOD PLTs conduct diving, demolition, and 
Level 1 technical exploitation operations. They can be used as force multipliers to 
support ordnance recovery, land range and underwater clearance, as well as 
EOD support and augmentation to land forces, shore detachments, contingency, 
and special operational support, as tasked. In addition, Navy EOD PLTs are 
assigned to SOF where continuing EOD requirements exist. They are equipped 
with EOD-specific tools, vehicles, and equipment, including demolition materials, 
explosive tools, robotics, electronic warfare systems, and specialized search and 
detection equipment. EOD PLTs are trained and equipped differently depending 
on their assigned mission, but all EOD PLTs maintain some common EOD 
response capabilities. 
(6) An EXMCM company enables access for combat forces and allow mobility
and maneuver. The EXMCM company integrates the underwater MCM
capabilities of an MCM PLT, an EXMCM company C2 element, and a unmanned
systems PLT into an effective task unit or as disaggregated units of action. They
are capable of rapidly performing all phases of MCM consisting of planning,
searching, classifying, mapping, reacquiring, identifying, neutralizing, and limited
exploitation of mines, maritime improvised explosive devices (MIEDs), and
waterborne improvised explosive devices (WBIEDs).
b. The mission of Navy EOD is to provide specially trained, combat ready, highly
mobile forces that enable access to areas denied by EO, and facilitate operational
mobility and maneuver in support of:
(1) Maritime component commanders, unified theater commanders, joint forces,
carrier strike groups, expeditionary strike groups.
(2) Amphibious ready groups/MEUs, MCM task forces and groups, SOF,
continental US Navy region commanders, interagency partners, and allies.
(3) The USSS and DOS for protection of designated dignitaries.
c. Navy EOD units support missions in all domains, worldwide, in which there is a
requirement to mitigate EHs that threaten operations or personnel. Such missions
include:
(1) Amphibious operations.
(2) Airfield damage repair (ADR).
(3) Port damage repair.
(4) Littoral, coastal, maritime, and blue water MCM.
(5) Range and waterway clearance.

continuum. Contingency operations include foreign humanitarian assistance,
including assistance in the development of allied nation EOD programs; disaster
relief; DSCA; very important personnel protection support activity; and providing
support to other operations as directed by higher authority.
e. Navy EOD personnel are manned, trained, and equipped to perform EOD tasks
to deliver the following capabilities:
(1) EXMCM. EXMCM include the search for, classification, mapping, requisition,
identification, neutralization, exploitation, and disposal of naval and sea mines. It
also includes MCM operations and exercises that require Navy EOD technicians
for mine recovery, technical exploitation, and neutralization operations.
(2) Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED). C-IED is conducted to defeat
unconventional ordnance and collect associated material to support technical
exploitation operations. Examples include booby traps and all types of IEDs, such
as MIEDs and WBIEDs.
(3) UXO. UXO response includes actions to identify UXO and mitigate their
effect on operations. This includes UXO remaining in former combat zones,
training areas, and target ranges. It also includes incidents involving explosive
items that have become or are suspected to be hazardous or unserviceable by
damage or deterioration. When foreign ordnance items are involved, acquisition
and exploitation provides value to the intelligence community via TECHINT, and
to the joint-Service EOD community for tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTP) and publications development.
(4) Counter CBRN ordnance. CBRN operations are conducted to counter WMD.
Examples include nuclear weapons, improvised nuclear devices, radiological
dispersal devices, and other devices incorporating chemical or biological warfare
agents. This may involve handling and/or storage of concentrations of chemical,
nuclear, or unusually hazardous bulk explosives or EO.
(5) Expeditionary Acquisition and Exploitation. This capability is near-real-time
technical exploitation operations on captured and recovered enemy weapons and
ordnance in support of the joint force. It includes operations intended to acquire
0$5 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12

enemy weapons systems and associated components for technical exploitation 
and analysis to support the intelligence community and joint-Service EOD. 
(6) Airfield Recovery. A tactical mission with a heavy engineering component in a
time-sensitive environment; EH is a subset of the broader capability of ADR. It
requires the EOD force to conduct EH identification and mitigation to enable the
naval construction force ability to restore air operations within timelines specified
by the operational commander.
f. Expeditionary Exploitation Unit ONE (referred to as EXU-1) general categories of
support. These include:
(1) Near-real-time weapons technical exploitation operations on captured and
recovered enemy weapons and ordnance in all weather conditions and CBRN
environments on land and underwater in support of the joint force.
(2) In theater and national post blast investigations (levels 1 and 2). These
encompass tactical evaluation of the incident site and identification, collection,
and neutralization of EO. Also included are electronic analysis of post-blast
components, producing detailed intelligence reports used for rapid development
of C-IED TTP, counter-bomber target development, and EOD render safe
procedures.
(3) In-theater identification and acquisition of unknown, foreign ordnance and
packaging it for shipment to US locations for further exploitation and to rapidly
develop TTP and EOD render safe procedures.
g. Navy Expeditionary Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (ExR-ADR). ExR-ADR is a
subset of the broader capability of ADR. ExR-ADR is tactical mission with a heavy
engineering component in a time-sensitive environment. It requires the naval
construction force augmented by the EOD force to conduct EH identification and
mitigation, airfield damage assessment, minimum airfield operating surface
selection, ADR, and emergency airfield lighting system installation to restore air
operations within timelines specified by the operational commander. During an
airfield attack, the enemy could use a combination of munitions: some that detonate
on impact, others with time delay-fuses, and possibly some antipersonnel
(AP)/materiel devices. The enemy’s use of a combination of munitions could
drastically hinder ADR efforts. Explosive ordnance reconnaissance (EOR) is the
investigation, detection, location, marking, initial identification, and reporting of
suspected EHs by EOD technicians to determine the need for further action and
inform the minimum airfield operating surface selection process. This activity is not
intended to fully mitigate EHs, but to be an initial appraisal where EHs or suspected
EHs have been found to quickly establish safe routes for the damage assessment
team (DAT).

5. United States Air Force (USAF)
a. Mission.
(1) Prime base engineer emergency force (Prime BEEF) EOD teams are
deployed to protect people, resources, and the environment from the effects of
EO caused by accidents or enemy attacks. Program requirements are identified
in Air Force Policy Directive 32-30, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, and Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program.
(a) USAF EOD teams are manned and equipped to provide a deployable,
response capability. EOD members provide an emergency response
capability for Air Force and joint commanders to detect, locate, access,
diagnose, render safe, recover, and dispose of EO.
(b) Direct combat support missions include the destruction of stockpiled and
abandoned enemy ordnance, route clearance, post-attack investigation, and
C-IED operations.
(c) Special capabilities include:
x Systems to rapidly clear heavy concentrations of area denial or UXO
submunitions from aircraft operating surfaces at key locations.
x Standoff munitions disruption, using projectile attack as an expedient
means of rapidly disrupting large numbers of UXO.
x Specialized vehicle-borne IED and chemical, biological, radiological,
nuclear, and explosives (referred to as CBRNE) capabilities.
x Explosive demolition for base denial effects.
WARNING 
**It is critical that ONLY EOD personnel conduct mitigation and 
disposal of explosive hazards. Non-EOD personnel are not 
directly involved in mitigation, but they should be prepared to 
assist EOD personnel in other aspects of these operations, when 
required. Explosive hazard mitigation should be in conjunction 
with, or immediately following, the explosive ordnance 
reconnaissance and damage assessment teams conducting their 
assessments. If explosive hazard mitigation is conducted after 
explosive ordnance reconnaissance, damage assessment, and 
minimum airfield operating surface selection, damage assessment 
team members may need to accompany the EOD technicians to 
record and report the locations of any collateral damage created 
by explosive hazard mitigation.

(2) USAF EOD teams are trained in small-unit tactics and support a JTF’s joint
operations area beyond the base and base defense zone. In these roles, EOD
teams must be able to operate, maintain, and employ weapons, including
individually assigned small arms, crew-served weapons, and remote weapon
systems.
b. USAF EOD Teams. EOD teams are comprised of a minimum of two EOD- 
qualified personnel based on the risk. The EOD team leader is a technical sergeant
(E-6) or above who has completed all required upgrade training and completed the
USAF EOD Team Leader Course. An EOD team is incomplete without special
training, publications, and specialized equipment to perform EOD-related
procedures. EOD is the only Air Force Specialty authorized to render-safe, dispose
of, and mitigate hazards posed by EO. (AFMAN 32-3001)
c. EOD Forces. USAF EOD forces primarily support air base operations for the
commander, USAF forces. USAF EOD can deploy as part of a joint, interagency, or
multinational force using counter-explosive unit type codes organized for specific
missions. In deployed environments, USAF EOD teams typically reside at every
main operating base supporting combat sortie generation and force protection by
eliminating EO to airfield operations. Priorities of USAF EOD employment are base
security zones and EOD missions outside of the base security zone, in support of air
operations. Other priorities include supporting battle-space owners during combined
or joint campaign execution.
d. Prime BEEF Units. Prime BEEF units are the primary organizational structures
supporting mobility and in-place requirements. USAF EOD forces are part of this
structure. Prime BEEF unit support to EO operations and EOD forces include:
(1) Providing EOR.
(2) Augmenting for ordnance removal.
(3) Plotting, tracking, and identifying EO.
(4) Providing heavy equipment support.
(5) Constructing barriers for EO effects mitigation.
(6) Detecting CBRN.
e. Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineer (RED
HORSE) Squadrons. Normally, RED HORSE units are assigned OPCON to the
USAF forces and are tasked through the commander, USAF forces, to provide
construction, heavy repair, general demolition capabilities (such as key infrastructure
demolition and airbase denial) or other general engineering capabilities as needed
throughout the theater of operations. RED HORSE squadrons provide a more robust
engineering capability than Prime BEEF units, but do not have assigned firefighter or
EOD personnel.
f. C2. The USAF task organizes Prime BEEF mobility units as expeditionary civil
engineer (CE) groups, expeditionary CE squadrons, or CE flights assigned to
support specific operating locations. USAF EOD organizes as a flight reporting to the
42 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 0$5 
CE squadron. The senior officer assigned to the Prime BEEF unit acts as the EO 
coordination element. For further task organization breakdown, refer to table 3.

1. Locations that do not have a high terrorist threat (i.e., openly hostile enemy or insurgent activities), or an
airfield recovery operations, follow guidance in the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP-1), Civil Engineer
Supplement, Enclosure G, Attachment 10.
2. High-threat locations support primarily aerial port, hub, spoke, on load, off load, enroute, and tanker task
force operations. If USAF EOD supports eight or more personnel at a base, this satisfies hub and air mobility,
low-threat requirements, and no additional personnel are required.

QUICK-REFERENCE GUIDE 
1. Introduction
a. Accurately recognizing hazards is critical to force protection and mitigating the
associated risk to mission accomplishment. This appendix describes general
identifying features of common United States (US) and foreign ordnance types and
demolition materials most likely encountered by units during operations.
2. Dropped Ordnance
a. General Purpose Bombs. As depicted in figure 13, general purpose bombs come
in many shapes and sizes depending on the manufacturing country and the specific
employment method. General purpose bombs consist of a metal container, a fuze,
and an aerodynamic stabilizing device. The metal container (called the bomb body)
holds an explosive or chemical filler. The body may be in one piece or multiple
pieces.
b. Chemical Bombs. Chemical-agent-filled bombs are built the same as general
purpose bombs. US chemical bombs are general purpose bombs with a chemical
filler in place of an explosive filler.

c. Dispensers. Dispensers, depicted in figures 14 and 15, come in a variety of
shapes and sizes depending on their payload. Some dispensers are reusable, and
some are one-time-use items. Never approach a dispenser or any part of a
dispenser found on the battlefield. The payload of submunitions may be scattered in
the area where the dispenser hit the ground.

WARNING 
DO NOT touch or disturb trip wires associated with submunitions. 
To avoid detonating the submunition, DO NOT touch or disturb its 
stabilization parachute or ribbon. 
If a submunition is found, many more submunitions may be in the 
same area. The small size of a submunition does not diminish its 
danger.

Figure 15. Example of Submunitions Dispenser CBU-87/B 
d. Submunitions. Submunitions, depicted in figures 16 and 17, are small, explosive
or chemical filled items designed for saturation coverage of a large area. They may
be antipersonnel (AP), antimateriel, antitank (AT), dual-purpose, incendiary, or
chemical. Dispensers, missiles, rockets, or projectiles may spread submunitions.

3. Projected Ordnance
a. Explosive ordnance (EO) originating from a launcher or gun tube is projected
ordnance (as depicted in figures 18 and 19). Projectiles can have a variety of fillers;
including explosives, chemicals (i.e., riot-control agents such as tear gas), white
phosphorus, illumination flares, or submunitions. Projectile bodies can be one piece
of metal or multiple sections fastened together.

Most guided missiles use internal proximity fuzing. Therefore, do 
not approach any guided missile lying on the battlefield. 
Figure 21. Examples of Rockets 
c. Figures 22, 23, and 24 show examples of guided missiles. Various guidance
systems direct guided missiles to a target. Some smaller rockets are wire guided to
the targets by a gunner. Radar guides most large missiles (such as the Patriot and
the Sparrow) to their target. The radar may be internal to the missile (like the Patriot)
or external (like the Sparrow), which uses the airplane’s radar system. Fins,
controlled by internal electronics, usually stabilize guided missiles in flight.

a. Thrown ordnance, commonly known as hand grenades (depicted in figure 25),
have three main parts: a body, a fuze with a pull ring and safety clip assembly, and a
filler. Never pick up a grenade on the battlefield, even if it still has the spoon and
safety pin attached. Consider all grenades found lying on a battlefield booby
trapped.

WARNING 
Consider all mines to be booby trapped or to have anti- 
disturbance fuzing. Never attempt to uncover or remove placed 
ordnance. 
Figure 25. Examples of Hand Grenades 
5. Placed Ordnance
a. Terms. The common term for placed ordnance is land mine. Land mines are
categorized as either persistent or nonpersistent. Both categories may include
antivehicle and AP capabilities. There is a major difference between placed mines
and scatterable mines. Camouflaging or burying (placing) mines underground makes
visual detection difficult. Scatterable mines land on the surface, usually making
visual detection easy. If approaching a suspected minefield, report it through the
chain of command using the explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) 9-line reporting
format.
b. AP Mines. AP mines are small and come in different shapes and sizes, as
depicted in figure 26. AP mine construction incorporates a variety of materials,
including plastic and wood. Some AP mines function when stepped on (pressure
54 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 0$5 
activated); and some AP mines (such as the US Claymore mine) may be set up to 
function by command detonation. Other AP mines are set up to function as 
improvised explosive devises (IEDs), such as those depicted in figure 27. These 
mines are set up to function by using a trip wire laid out across a path or road. 
Pulling or cutting the trip wire will cause the fuze to function and the mine to 
detonate.

Figure 27. Examples of AP Booby Traps 
c. AT Mines. AT mines are much larger than AP mines and may use a variety of
fuzing, including pressure, magnetic, or tilt-rod. Some of the more modern AT mines
have plastic bodies, which make them hard to detect with a metallic mine detector.
The AT mines depicted in figure 28 function by direct pressure from a tank or
vehicle, or employ a tilt-rod fuze sticking out of the ground. Moving or pushing the
rod causes the mine to detonate.

6. Demolition Material
a. The term, demolition material, identifies explosives, incendiaries, and necessary
accessories (depicted in figure 29) that are deliberately placed to destroy enemy
property, breach barricades, or dispose of EO. Such materials include explosive
initiators; demolition charges; and instruments, tools, and equipment used with
charges for performing various demolition operations.

1. Introduction
Appendix C 
BARRICADE PROTECTIVE MEASURES 
a. Operational area contamination by explosive ordnance (EO) can cause
confusion. A recognized and rehearsed system of alerting personnel to EO and
evacuating an area are essential. Alerting systems may include loudspeakers,
radios, and messengers. Unit standard operating procedures (SOPs) should include
procedures for evacuating personnel from a hazard area and reestablishing
operations at another location. Rehearsed and flexible evacuation plans can reduce
personnel and vehicle losses.
b. Commanders must consider EO when establishing bases, base camps, and work
sites. An evacuation plan should include procedures for unit elements to investigate
and mark clear paths or link paths from other unit positions to their position and to
the nearest hard-surfaced road. When evacuation is not possible due to mission
constraints, units must employ barricades.
2. Barricades
a. Overview. A barricade is an artificial barrier that provides limited protection by
channeling a blast and fragmentation emanating from a hazard area. Use barricades
to lessen blast effects and limit necessary evacuation areas. Estimated probable
damage from an EO detonation dictates barricade requirements. Building artificial
barricades is time consuming and resource intensive. Depending on the size of the
EO, consider constructing barricades immediately around the EO to protect the
entire area, or construct barricades next to exposed equipment.
b. Barricade Types. The three types of barricades are circular, semicircular, and
wall. Barricade selection depends on the EO hazard and the area requiring
protection.
(1) Circular. A circular barricade is the best choice for small EO hazards because
circular barriers provide complete protection for personnel and equipment. A
circular barricade 8 feet in diameter, 3 feet tall, and 3 sandbags thick requires
approximately 400 sandbags. The barricade, depicted in figure 33, forces the
blast upwards and contains the majority of the fragments.
Figure 33. Circular Barricade 
62 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 0$5 
(2) Semicircular. Use a semicircular barricade for small and medium-sized EO
hazards. Semicircular barricades channel the blast and fragmentation through the
open side and away from the protected area, as depicted in figure 34.
Figure 34. Semicircular Barricade 
(3) Wall. The wall barricade protects specific equipment or personnel areas. Use
the wall barricade when the EO hazard is too large to contain by using a circular
or semicircular barricade. The number of wall barricades needed will depend on
how much equipment and how many personnel must be protected. A wall
barricade 12 feet long, 6 feet high, and 3 sandbags thick requires 700 sandbags.
As shown in figure 36, the wall barricade should extend beyond, and be at least
as tall as, the equipment or personnel areas. Barricaded equipment must remain
functional. For example, the radar shown in figure 35 is still able to detect
threats.
Figure 35. Wall Barricade 
c. Barricade Construction Guidelines.
(1) Calculate the total destructive power of the EO hazard. Multiply the number
of items by their net explosive weight to identify how resistant your barricade will
need to be.
(2) Determine which assets must remain in the EO contaminated area.
(3) For assets remaining in the area, decide on the type of barricade required to
protect them. Sandbags or other dirt or water filled barriers can be used.
0$5 
ATP 4-32.2/MCRP 10-10D.1/NTTP 3-02.4.1/AFTTP 3-2.12 
63 
(4) Concrete barriers employed near EO produce secondary fragmentation and,
therefore, are not the preferred option when other barricade materials are
available.
(5) Minimize personnel exposure by using the minimum number of personnel to
construct barricades.
(6) Maximize earth-moving equipment use and consider constructing earthen
barriers rather than sandbag barricades.
(7) When using sandbag barricades, fill sandbags away from the EO hazard
area to reduce exposure and transport the filled sandbags to the barricade site.
(8) Ensure personnel constructing barricades employ appropriate personal
protective equipment.
d. Placement and Size of Barricades.
(1) Construct barricades between the EO and protected equipment. Construct
barricades no closer to the EO than the height of the barricade plus three feet.
For example, the barricade shown in figure 36 is 5 feet tall. By adding an
additional 3 feet, the barricade is positioned no closer to the EO than 8 feet.
Positioning barricades in this manner maximizes protection from the blast and
flying fragments.
Figure 36. Placement Distance for a Barricade 
(2) Interlock the sandbags for stability when building barricades, as depicted in
figure 37. Failing to interlock sandbags reduces protection and causes barricade
instability.

Figure 37. Interlocking Sandbags 
(3) Small EO includes missiles and rockets less than 70 millimeters in diameter,
projectiles less than 75 millimeters in diameter, and submunitions and grenades.
When barricading small EO, a double-wall thickness of sandbags surrounding the
EO affords sufficient protection. Stack sandbags at least 3 feet high in a
semicircular or circular configuration.
(4) Medium-sized EO includes missiles, rockets, and projectiles up to 200
millimeters in diameter. For medium- and large-sized EO and surface-placed
munitions, surround the area with a wall 4 or 5 sandbags thick. Stack sandbags
at least 5 feet high in a semicircular configuration to protect assets.
(5) Large unexploded explosive ordnance, such as projectiles, missiles, and
general-purpose bombs cannot be barricaded effectively. In these cases,
barricade equipment and personnel activity areas. A wall barricade between the
affected area and the EO hazard provides the best and easiest protection. Use
concrete barriers to protect assets in this situation. See Army Techniques
Publication (ATP) 3-37.34/Marine Corps Tactical Publication (MCTP) 3-34C,
Survivability Operations for more information on constructing protective works.
