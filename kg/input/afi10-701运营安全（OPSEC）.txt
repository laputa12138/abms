AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
Chapter 1 
OPERATIONS SECURITY (OPSEC) OVERVIEW 
1.1.  National Security Decision Directive 298,National Operations Security Programrequires 
each executive department and agency with a national security mission to have an OPSEC 
program.  Likewise, DoDD 5205.02E, DoD Operations Security (OPSEC) Program, supports 
the national program and requires each Department of Defense (DoD) component to establish 
and maintain an OPSEC program. 
1.2.  OPSEC is an information-related capability that preserves friendly essential secrecy 
by using a process to identify, control and protect critical information and indicators.  If 
critical information and indicators are disclosed, it could allow adversaries or potential 
adversaries to identify and exploit friendly vulnerabilities leading to increased risk to mission 
failure or the loss of life.  The desired effect of OPSEC is to influence the adversary’s behavior 
and actions by reducing the adversary’s ability to collect and exploit critical information and 
indicators about friendly activities. 
1.3.  Essential secrecy is the condition achieved by denying critical information and 
indicators to adversaries.  Adversaries in possession of critical information can hinder or 
prevent friendly mission accomplishment.  Thus, essential secrecy is a prerequisite for effective 
operations. 
1.4.  OPSEC, when closely integrated and synchronized with other information-related 
capabilities, security disciplines and all aspects of protected operations, preserves essential 
secrecy.  OPSEC does this by systematically identifying and managing critical information and 
indicators attendant to military operations and activities, to deny an adversary the ability to 
interpret friendly intentions, capabilities, or activities in sufficient time to act effectively against 
friendly mission accomplishment.  It is impossible to avoid all risk and protect everything.  
Attempting to protect all information diverts resources from actions needed for mission success.  
Instead organizations should seek an efficient and effective cost solution that balances their risk 
assessment against vulnerabilities and potential threats to their critical information and 
indicators. 
1.5.  OPSEC supports planning, preparation, execution and post execution phases of all 
activities, 
operations 
and 
programs 
across 
the 
entire 
spectrum 
of 
military 
operations.  Enhanced operational effectiveness occurs when decision-makers apply OPSEC 
from the earliest stages of planning.  Exclusion of OPSEC in the early stages of strategy and 
operational planning limits the effectiveness of operations and consequently degrades the 
commander’s ability to gain information superiority. 
 
 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019

1.6.  Commanders and directors are responsible for identifying and managing signatures 
associated with Air Force activities, capabilities, operations, and programs.  Signatures can 
be managed by implementing and practicing good OPSEC.  OPSEC will be integrated into all 
military functions such as military strategy, command and control, operational and tactical 
planning and execution, continuity of operations, Air Force specialized training, and military 
accession.  OPSEC shall also be coordinated and integrated into all security disciplines such as 
cyber, information, industrial, personnel and physical, law enforcement, antiterrorism and force 
protection.  In addition, OPSEC shall be integrated into relevant support activities; contingency; 
combat and peacetime operations and exercises; communications/computer architectures and 
processing; critical infrastructure protection; science and technology efforts, weapons systems 
research, development, test and evaluation processes; inspections; acquisition and procurement; 
and medical operations.  (T-0).  Note: Science and technology efforts and research, 
development, test and evaluation activities are high-priority targets for collection and are 
particularly vulnerable to compromise for both classified and unclassified information and have 
an inherent requirement to implement OPSEC. 
1.7.  OPSEC is a commander’s/director’s responsibility and is established, managed and 
implemented at all levels throughout the AF.  It is an operations function and shall be 
integrated into all operational planning and coordinated with relevant information operations 
functions.  (T-0). 
1.7.1.  To ensure effective implementation across organizational and functional lines of 
operations, the management of OPSEC should reside in the operations and/or plans element 
of an organization.  For those organizations with no traditional operations or plans element, 
the commander/director determines the most logical organization to place management and 
responsibility of their OPSEC program. 
1.7.2.  The Air Force OPSEC program management structure consists of senior leadership 
oversight and OPSEC practitioners (program managers, signature managers, coordinators, 
planners, instructors and OPSEC Support Team members) at appropriate command levels as 
illustrated in Figure 1.1, Air Force Operations Security Organizational Structure. 
Figure 1.1.  Air Force Operations Security Organizational Structure. 
 
1.7.3.  An OPSEC program consists of policies, accountability, mechanisms for enforcement, 
operating staff, tactics, techniques and procedures, education, training and equipping 
functions necessary to enable the conduct of OPSEC planning and execution and to ensure 
the highest level of leadership oversight. 
 
 
8 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
1.8.  OPSEC is everyone’s responsibility.  Air Force personnel at all levels will: 
1.8.1.  Be familiar with the organization’s critical information, indicators and threats.  (T-0). 
1.8.2.  Protect critical information and indicators from disclosure.  (T-0). 
1.8.3.  Protect all electronic communications containing critical information and indicators.  
(T-0). 
1.8.4.  Not publicly disseminate, or publish information or imagery displaying critical 
information such as improvised explosive device strikes, battle scenes, casualties, destroyed 
or damaged equipment, personnel killed in action (both friendly and adversary) and the 
protective measures of military facilities or other critical information as identified by the 
critical information and indicators list within each organization.  This prohibition extends to 
publishing sensitive information via social media and other internet-based capabilities 
without the appropriate level of oversight and approval.  (T-0). 
1.9.  To enhance the effectiveness and understanding of OPSEC:  The Air Force provides 
education and training for all Air Force personnel (e.g., military, Department of the Air Force 
civilians, DoD Contractors, family members).  Additionally, the Air Force conducts internal and 
external assessments utilizing tools and capabilities such as the AF OST, Electronic Systems 
Security Assessments (ESSA) and Enterprise Protection Risk Management (EPRM). 
1.10.  Ideally, the Air Force uses OPSEC countermeasures to protect its critical 
information.  Failure to properly implement countermeasures can result in serious injury or 
death to Air Force personnel, damage to weapons systems, equipment and facilities, loss of 
sensitive technologies, and mission degradation or failure. 
1.11.  Air Force OPSEC SharePoint Sites.  The Air Force maintains OPSEC SharePoint sites 
on both the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network and the Secret Internet Protocol 
Router Network (SIPRNet).  Air Force OPSEC practitioners request access to the SharePoint 
sites through their MAJCOM/DRU OPSEC Program Manager or the AF OST. 
1.11.1.  The SharePoint site https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10054/default.aspx located on the 
Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network is the central location for unclassified 
collaboration of OPSEC.  Examples of awareness briefings, training materials, potential 
communication technology threats and lessons learned are available on the SharePoint site. 
1.11.2.  The 
OPSEC 
SharePoint 
site 
located 
on 
SIPRNet 
https://intelshare.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/signaturemanagement/SitePages/Home.aspx is 
the central storage and collaboration space for OPSEC at the SECRET level.

Chapter 3 
OPSEC PROCESS 
3.1.  General.  The OPSEC process is a systematic method used to identify, control and protect 
critical information as established in National Security Decision Directive 298.  This chapter 
presents the five elements of the OPSEC process: 1) Identify critical information, 2) Analyze 
threats, 3) Analyze vulnerabilities, 4) Assess risk and 5) Apply countermeasures.  These 
elements may or may not be used in sequential order but all elements must be present to conduct 
an OPSEC analysis.  When planning in a contingency or crisis dynamic situation elements may 
need to be revisited at any time.  The Air Force uses OPSEC to enhance mission effectiveness by 
managing signatures.  Additionally, a profiling process is employed to identify and understand 
how the use of specific information systems and conduits to accomplish operational missions and 
activities.  Within the AF, process-related subject matter experts are consulted to create the most 
accurate list of critical information, the identification of vulnerabilities and indicators allowing 
us to conduct a thorough risk analysis.  This risk analysis provides Air Force leadership with 
options, based on the risk analysis results to manage signatures to protect Air Force activities. 
3.2.  Identify Critical Information: 
3.2.1.  Critical information includes specific facts about friendly activities, intentions, 
capabilities, or limitations that an adversary seeks to gain a military, diplomatic, economic, 
or technological advantage.  Such information, if revealed to an adversary may prevent or 
degrade mission accomplishment, cause loss of life or damage friendly resources.  This step 
only identifies potential critical information items.  The resulting critical information and 
indicators list should not be published as the unit’s official critical information and indicators 
list until the remainder of the OPSEC process is completed.  Other steps within the OPSEC 
process may remove, refine, or add additional items from/to the list. 
3.2.2.  The identification of critical information is a key part of the OPSEC process because it 
focuses the remainder of the OPSEC process on protecting vital information rather than 
attempting to protect all unclassified information.  The individuals responsible for the 
planning and execution of the organization’s mission are the ones that can best identify their 
critical information.  Additionally, using an adversarial approach and asking what 
information an adversary wants to know about the mission is a helpful method when trying to 
identify critical information. 
3.2.3.  Once the OPSEC process is completed, compile the critical information and indicators 
identified into a critical information and indicators list, obtain the commander/director 
approval and disseminate it to all organizational personnel to ensure they are aware of the 
information which requires protection. 
3.2.4.  Identify critical information at the earliest stages of planning an operation or activity 
and continuously update as necessary to support mission effectiveness. 
3.2.5.  Strive to keep critical information and indicators list unclassified “For Official Use 
Only”.  Critical information and indicators lists assist to remind personnel to protect related 
critical information and indicators.  Do not release critical information and indicator list to 
the public. 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
25 
3.3.  Analyze Threats: 
3.3.1.  A threat is an adversary with the capability and intent to undertake action detrimental 
to mission success, to include associated program activities and/or operations.  An adversary 
is any entity with goals counter to your own. 
3.3.2.  Threat information is necessary to understand what to protect and subsequently 
develop appropriate countermeasures.  Analyzing threats includes identifying potential 
adversaries and their associated capabilities and intentions to collect, analyze and exploit 
critical information and indicators. 
3.3.3.  Analyzing threat involves the research and analysis of intelligence, counterintelligence 
and open-source information to identify the likely adversaries to the planned operation.  The 
operation planners, working with the intelligence and counterintelligence staffs, assisted by 
the OPSEC Practitioner, will seek answers to the following threat questions: 
3.3.3.1.  Who is the adversary?  (Who has the intent and capability to take action against 
the mission?  Who are the friends of these adversaries?  Who are the Air Force’s potential 
adversaries?). 
3.3.3.2.  What are the adversary’s intentions and goals?  (What does the adversary want 
to accomplish?). 
3.3.3.3.  What are the adversary’s intelligence collection capabilities (e.g., Human 
Intelligence, Imagery Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Measurement and Signature 
Intelligence, Open-source Intelligence)? 
3.3.3.4.  What are the adversary’s tactics (courses of action) for opposing the mission?  
(What actions might the adversary take?). 
3.3.3.5.  What critical information or indicators does the adversary already know about 
the operation?  (What information is it too late to protect?). 
3.3.3.6.  What is the adversary’s methodology for collecting on friendly forces? 
3.3.4.  Intelligence organizations provide tailored intelligence threat information in support of 
the Commander’s Priority Intelligence Requirements.  AFOSI provides counterintelligence 
threat information that includes but is not limited to foreign intelligence services, foreign and 
domestic terrorist organizations, criminals, cyber-based threats, lone extremists groups, 
economic competitors.  Reports from cyberspace organizations can be used to assess cyber 
threats and vulnerabilities. 
3.4.  Analyze Vulnerabilities: 
3.4.1.  A vulnerability exists when the adversary is capable of collecting critical information 
and/or indicators, correctly analyzing them and acting quickly enough to impact friendly 
objectives. 
 
 
26 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
3.4.2.  An adversary exploits vulnerabilities to obtain critical information.  The adversary 
then uses the information collected to support their decision-making process thus obtaining 
an operational advantage.  The vulnerability can be in an organization’s procedures, a failure 
of traditional security, poor judgment on the part of leadership, lack of threat awareness, the 
use of unsecure information systems without encryption to process critical information or the 
system design itself.  Conducting exercises and analyzing operations can help identify 
vulnerabilities. 
3.4.3.  An indicator is a friendly detectable action and/or open-source information that can be 
interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information.  All indicators 
have characteristics making them identifiable or causing them to standout.  The 
characteristics of an indicator are: signatures, profiles, associations, contrast and exposure. 
3.4.4.  A vulnerability analysis is the examination of your processes, projects or missions to 
determine if you have inherent, naturally occurring or self-induced vulnerabilities or 
indicators that put your critical information and thus your mission at risk. 
3.5.  Assess Risk: 
3.5.1.  Risk is a measure of the potential degree to which critical information is subject to 
loss through adversary exploitation.  The assessment of risk evaluates the degree of probable 
harm or adverse impact that a vulnerability or combination of vulnerabilities may cause if 
exploited by an adversary.  It involves assessing the adversary’s ability to exploit 
vulnerabilities that would lead to the exposure of critical information and the potential impact 
it would have on the mission.  Determining the level of risk is a key element of the OPSEC 
process and provides justification for the use of countermeasures.  Conduct risk assessments 
and develop recommended countermeasures based on operational planning and the current 
operating environment.  A typical risk assessment will: 
3.5.1.1.  Determine the level of risk by comparing the vulnerabilities identified with the 
probability of an adversary being able to exploit those vulnerabilities and the impact if 
exploited. 
3.5.1.2.  Once the amount of risk is determined, identify potential countermeasures to 
reduce the vulnerabilities with the highest risk.  The most desirable countermeasures are 
those combining the highest possible protection with the least amount of resource 
requirements and/or adverse effects on mission goals. 
3.5.1.3.  Consider the cost, time and effort of implementing measures and 
countermeasures to mitigate risk.  Factors to consider include: 
3.5.1.3.1.  What are the benefits of the proposed countermeasures to reduce risks 
compared to the negative effects on the mission?” 
3.5.1.3.2.  What is the cost of the proposed countermeasure compared with the cost 
associated with the impact if the adversary exploits the vulnerability? 
3.5.1.3.3.  Will implementing the countermeasure create a new OPSEC indicator? 
 
 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
27 
3.6.  Apply Countermeasures: 
3.6.1.  Countermeasures are anything which negates or reduces an adversary’s ability to 
exploit Air Force vulnerabilities.  Countermeasures are designed to prevent an adversary 
from detecting critical information, provide an alternative interpretation of critical 
information or indicators (deception), or deny the adversary the ability to utilize their 
collection system to exploit Air Force operations.  Countermeasures may be offensive or 
defensive in nature (e.g., camouflage, concealment, deception, intentional deviations from 
normal patterns, direct strikes against adversary collection capabilities).  If the 
commander/director determines the risk level is unacceptable, implement countermeasures to 
mitigate the risk and reduce it to an acceptable level. 
3.6.2.  The OPSEC 
Working Group submits recommended countermeasures for 
commander/director approval. 
3.6.3.  Countermeasures must be synchronized and integrated with other information-related 
capabilities to achieve synergies in efforts to influence the adversary’s perceptions and 
situational awareness. 
3.6.4.  Countermeasures must be coordinated with other affected organizations to ensure they 
do not become vulnerabilities or unacceptable indicators. 
3.6.5.  During the execution of countermeasures, monitor the adversary’s reaction, if 
possible, to provide feedback that can be used to assess effectiveness or determine potential 
unintended consequences. 
3.7.  Signature Management.  Commanders defend or exploit operational profiles through the 
management of signatures.  This is accomplished by identifying processes and details within an 
Air Force activity to map and understand their operational profiles.  Signature management is the 
active defense or exploitation of operational profiles resident at a given military installation or 
organization. 
3.7.1.  Defense of operational profiles is accomplished by implementing countermeasures to 
deny or mitigate adversary collection of critical information. 
3.7.2.  Using a profiling process allows the commander to define the local operating 
environment and captures process points that present key signatures and profiles with critical 
information value.  This process is the deliberate effort to identify functional area process 
and the observables they produce to contribute to the overall signature of day-to-day 
activities and operational trends.  Once completed, the results can be used to develop 
execution checklists, critical information and indicators list and identify key process points 
for potential protection or exploitation.  This ultimately provides commanders several options 
to exploit or deny signatures to enhance mission effectiveness.

Chapter 5 
EVALUATING OPSEC 
5.1.  Overview.  OPSEC evaluations fall into two categories: OPSEC reviews and OPSEC 
assessments.  OPSEC reviews are methods to determine an organization’s compliance with 
established OPSEC standards or measures of performance.  OPSEC assessments are methods to 
determine the effectiveness of policies, practices, procedures and OPSEC measures to protect an 
organization’s critical information and indicators or measures of effectiveness.  In addition, 
OPSEC assessments may be used during exercises or real-world operations to determine the 
effectiveness of measures and countermeasures designed to affect adversary collection sensors.

5.2.  OPSEC Reviews.  Conducted annually, by the organization to verify policies and 
procedures are in place and measures of performance are documented and executed to protect 
critical information and indicators.  Results from a review may provide indications of the need 
for an OPSEC assessment. 
5.2.1.  Organizations may utilize assessment tools such as the management internal control 
toolset (MICT), the OPSEC module in the enterprise protection risk management (EPRM) 
system or staff assistance visits to conduct annual OPSEC reviews. 
5.2.1.1.  Management Internal Control Toolset.  MICT is the Air Force program of record 
to communicate a unit’s program health using self-assessment communicators and special 
interest item compliance.  The Air Force OPSEC self-assessment communicators are 
developed and managed by the Air Force OPSEC Program Manager.  See AFI 90-201, 
for specific MICT information. 
5.2.1.2.  Enterprise Protection Risk Management.  EPRM’s OPSEC Module is a web-
based tool developed to provide a standardized process to assist the OPSEC community 
with assessing and quantifying risk to critical information.  This assessment allow 
informed decisions on what countermeasures to implement to reduce the organization’s 
overall risk and vulnerabilities.  EPRM provides posture, vulnerabilities and risk level 
status, which can provide assistance in developing plans and management reports.  It 
provides a platform for planners to test remediation options and scenarios and provides 
an expert knowledge base to assist in threat assessments.  OPSEC practitioners can 
request an EPRM account by going to the EPRM site on SIPRNet. 
5.2.1.3.  Staff Assistance Visit.  OPSEC Program Managers, or other organization subject 
matter experts conduct staff assistance visits as needed in accordance with (IAW) AFI 
90-201 and this instruction.  The purpose is to assist organizations with managing and 
implementing OPSEC into plans, repairing dormant, non-compliant, deficient programs.  
Organizations may request staff assistance visits IAW AFI 90-201.  Staff assistance visits 
check for program compliance (e.g., Special Interest Items, AFIs, MAJCOM policies), 
identify and resolve shortfalls and provide guidance as required. 
5.2.2.  OPSEC reviews evaluate: 
5.2.2.1.  Personnel’s knowledge of critical information, indicators and publication of the 
critical information and indicators list. 
5.2.2.2.  Personnel’s knowledge of the collection threat to the organization and the 
countermeasures in place to protect against the collection. 
5.2.2.3.  The implementation of OPSEC countermeasures to protect identified critical 
information and indicators. 
5.2.2.4.  Status of OPSEC training within the organization. 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019

5.2.3.  Annual OPSEC Report.  Annually, each DoD Component is required to submit to the 
Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) an assessment of OPSEC within the component.  
An annual OPSEC report is completed and submitted by each MAJCOM, DRU, FOA, wing 
and wing equivalent organization.  The annual report shows how well OPSEC is being 
implemented and practiced in the Air Force.  Additionally, the report identifies best practices, 
gaps and issues within each organization.  The identification of gaps and issues enables the 
Air Force to focus its efforts to remedy those gaps.  The annual OPSEC Report is develop by 
combining fiscal year data from OPSEC program reviews, measures of performance, 
measures of effectiveness, exercise after-action reports, lessons learned, Unit Effectiveness 
Inspections and annually conducted external and internal assessments.  The report has been 
assigned Report Control Symbol (RCS) DD-INTEL(A) 2228.  (T-0). 
5.2.3.1.  The Air Force OPSEC Program Manager provides Air Force OPSEC Report 
guidance to the MAJCOMs, DRUs and FOAs. 
5.2.3.2.  MAJCOMs, DRUs and FOAs are responsible for tasking their subordinate 
organizations to complete and submit an annual OPSEC report that allows each 
MAJCOM, DRU and FOA to consolidate and provide a command view of their OPSEC 
program via the OPSEC report. 
5.2.3.3.  The MAJCOM, DRU and FOA Commander/Director, or the delegated authority 
responsible for the organizations OPSEC program signs that organization’s Annual 
OPSEC Report and forwards to the tasking organization. 
5.2.3.4.  The commander/director or designated representative for organizations below 
the MAJCOM/DRU signs that organization’s Annual OPSEC Program Report and 
forwards it to their higher headquarters OPSEC Program Manager. 
5.3.  Assessments.  OPSEC assessments are conducted to determine if adequate procedures are 
in place to protect critical information and indicators and to gauge the overall effectiveness of 
countermeasures.  OPSEC assessments, are conducted annually or when operations or 
commanders/directors dictate, to evaluate measures of effectiveness of an organization's ability 
to maintain essential secrecy.  The assessment of OPSEC identifies the effectiveness through the 
evaluation of unit established measures of performance and measures of effectiveness within 
plans and programs.  Measures of performance indicate whether a particular action was 
performed and measures of effectiveness measure if implemented measures and countermeasures 
work. 
5.3.1.  Website Assessment.  At least annually, organizations that maintain external-facing 
web sites conduct content vulnerability analysis of the information on those sites to ensure 
critical information is not available for exploitation by potential adversaries.  External-facing 
website owners should participate in conducting the annual assessments.  They have the best 
understanding of the scope, intent, and focus of the site and with assistance from an OPSEC 
Practitioner and a critical information and indicators list can determine if critical information 
and indicators are present on the site.  Note: Websites that require a DoD Common Access 
Card are exempt from this annual requirement.

AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
5.3.2.  OPSEC Internal Assessments.  An OPSEC Internal Assessment is an overall 
evaluation of the organization’s ability to effectively protect its critical information and 
indicators.  Use the organization’s internal assets to conduct internal assessments.  The 
purpose of an internal assessment is to evaluate an organization’s activities and supporting 
functions to determine if sufficient countermeasures are in place to protect against the loss of 
critical information and indicators. 
5.3.2.1.  Internal assessments are conducted annually.  Additionally, conduct assessments 
when there is a need to evaluate based on the sensitivity of the operation or activity, or 
when there is evidence that an adversary is attempting to gain critical information and 
indicators.  These assessments can include deploying OPSEC practitioners to forward 
operating locations to support assessment of deployed units. 
5.3.2.2.  Conduct an internal assessment prior to the development of an OPSEC program.  
The internal assessment can establish an OPSEC profile by revealing indicators that 
present vulnerabilities for an adversary to exploit.  This allows the program to be 
developed with fact-based knowledge of threats and vulnerabilities that must be 
addressed. 
5.3.3.  Electronic Systems Security Assessment (ESSA).  Cyberspace Defense Analysis 
weapon system units conduct ESSAs on Air Force owned, operated, and/or leased 
communication systems to support OPSEC protection measures.  ESSA assists commanders 
in evaluating their organization's OPSEC posture by identifying the amount and type of 
information available to adversary collection entities.  Commanders may submit request for 
ESSAs on SIPRNet via the support page of the 616th Operations Center, Command and 
Control 
Cyberspace 
Forces 
website 
(https://intelshare.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/624oc/SitePages/default.aspx).  Once the ESSA 
request is received, the request will be prioritized based on the type of mission the requesting 
organization is conducting or supporting.  See paragraph 6.4, for ESSA request priorities.  
ESSA monitoring can be tasked and focused on specific information pertaining to Air Force 
Core Functions, weapon systems, operations, and activities.  Awareness of active electronic 
monitoring of government telecommunication systems is an essential element of deterrence 
of such disclosures.  The monitoring of Air Force communication systems can only be 
conducted within certain legal parameters and may only be performed by authorized 
personnel. 
5.3.3.1.  The Air Force currently monitors three major mediums, which if exploited by 
adversaries, can negatively affect Air Force operations.  Note: Specific capabilities may 
vary as technology changes. 
5.3.3.1.1.  Telephony, the monitoring and assessment of Air Force unclassified voice 
networks. 
5.3.3.1.2.  Email Communications, the monitoring and assessment of unclassified Air 
Force email traffic on the Air Force Information Network. 
5.3.3.1.3.  Radio Frequency Communications, the monitoring and assessment of Air 
Force communications within radio frequency bands (e.g., mobile phones, land 
mobile radios, wireless local area networks). 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
37 
5.3.3.2.  ESSA Team Support.  OPSEC Program Managers, OPSEC Planners, FOA 
OPSEC Signature Managers, and members of the AF OST request ESSA support through 
Twenty-Fourth Air Force (AF Cyber). 
5.3.3.3.  Guidance regarding ESSA operations is provided in Chapter 6. 
5.3.3.4.  The most effective assessments involve active participation from the assessed 
unit.  This includes clearly describing areas to be assessed, developing quality lists of 
critical information for which to monitor, and providing feedback on assessment 
products. 
5.3.3.5.  Most monitoring activities are provided at no cost to the assessed organization.  
However, if the assessed organizations require a mode of monitoring that requires 
physical proximity or request an in-person mission out-brief, the requesting organization 
must fund the travel of the team conducting the assessment.  Additionally, for an on-site 
assessment, the requesting organization must: 
5.3.3.5.1.  Coordinate a work area and secure storage facility for the team performing 
the ESSA mission. 
5.3.3.5.2.  Assist the team with arrangements for billeting, transportation, and 
messing. 
5.3.3.5.3.  Provide necessary technical information when requested, such as 
frequencies, system specifications, circuit listings, and critical nodes. 
5.3.3.5.4.  Ensure administrative communication capabilities are available to teams 
for operational or administrative support.  Arrange specialized communications 
support as needed to meet mission requirements. 
5.3.4.  OPSEC External Assessment.  The AF OST conducts OPSEC external assessments to 
provide Air Force leadership with an in-depth analysis and feedback on the effectiveness of 
countermeasures put in place to mitigate adversarial exploitation of Air Force activities and 
operations.  An OPSEC external assessment is not a programmatic assessment.  It is a 
detailed, third-party analysis of Air Force activities and operations associated with a specific 
Air Force weapon system, core function, or operational event by employing the known 
collection capabilities of potential adversaries. 
5.3.4.1.  The OPSEC external assessment requires a team of experts to assess an activity 
from an adversary’s perspective to determine if critical information and indicators are 
disclosed through normal operations and functions, to identify vulnerabilities and propose 
countermeasures to mitigate the disclosure of essential secrets. 
5.3.4.2.  The primary focus is to identify critical information, indicators and 
vulnerabilities associated with the operations of the assessed Air Force capability, 
pinpoint weaknesses an adversary could utilize to degrade Air Force operations and 
activities and provide Air Force Senior Leadership information about when, where and 
how a potential adversary could interpret Air Force intentions. 
 
 
38 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
5.3.4.3.  OPSEC external assessments determine if current OPSEC countermeasures are 
effectively mitigating identified threats and vulnerabilities.  OPSEC external assessment, 
recommendations for new or additional countermeasures against existing or future 
capabilities are identified to better protect assets and increase the operational advantage 
over adversaries and competitors. 
5.3.4.4.  The AF OST coordinates their presence at locations with MAJCOM IG 
Gatekeepers and MAJCOM/DRU OPSEC Program Managers to ensure minimal impact 
by the team within a commander's enterprise IAW AFI 90-201. 
5.3.4.5.  To maintain team and mission integrity, it is imperative OPSEC external 
assessment team members be billeted together, when possible.  The OPSEC External 
Assessment Mission Director, while maintaining requirements established in the Joint 
Travel Regulations, is responsible for determining appropriate lodging for OPSEC 
External Assessment team members. 
5.3.4.6.  The AF OST nominates Air Force OPSEC external assessment targets annually, 
based on adversary threat information, through the lead MAJCOM to the Air Force 
OPSEC Program Manager to gain approval of future OPSEC external assessment focus 
area(s).  OPSEC external assessments are comprehensive and potentially multi-site 
assessments that attempt to collect and exploit Air Force critical information and 
indicators with the ultimate goal of improving essential secrecy. 
5.3.4.7.  Results from Air Force OPSEC external assessments are provided in a 
formalized report to the AF/A3 by the end of February following the completion of the 
tasked assessment. 
5.3.4.8.  MAJCOMs, DRUs and FOAs may request an OPSEC external assessment as 
needed, but OPSEC external assessments must be focused on a specific operation, 
mission, activity, or capability to allow the AF OST to provide the best results to the 
organizations. 
5.3.4.9.  The AF OST forwards results from the MAJCOM, DRU and FOA OPSEC 
external assessment to the command that requested the assessment.  MAJCOMs, DRUs 
and FOAs should provide an analysis of the results from any OPSEC external 
assessments conducted for their organizations in their Annual OPSEC Report. 
5.3.5.  OPSEC Program Management Assessment.  An OPSEC program management 
assessment is a thorough analysis of how OPSEC is implemented, executed, supported and 
managed to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of OPSEC implementation within the 
organization.  OPSEC program management assessments are conducted by the AF OST. 
5.3.5.1.  During an OPSEC program management assessment, the AF OST will work 
with the assessed organization to identify opportunities to develop and implement more 
effective methods to enable the improved protection of critical information and 
indicators. 
5.3.5.2.  OPSEC program management assessments require considerably more time and 
effort from the assessed organization’s leadership, program managers and general work 
force than what is required for an OPSEC external assessment.  To be successful, the AF 
OST’s activities during an OPSEC program management assessment require dedicated 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
39 
time and resources of the assessed organization to thoroughly understand and assess the 
OPSEC program. 
5.3.5.3.  OPSEC program management assessments can be requested by the assessed 
organization through their MAJCOM/DRU/AFFOR OPSEC Program Manager and FOA 
OPSEC Signature Manager. 
5.3.5.4.  The requesting organization is responsible for coordinating with the MAJCOM 
and Wing Gatekeepers of the AF OST presence on the installation. 
5.3.5.5.  The requesting organization is responsible for funding OPSEC program 
management assessments, unless preapproved by the Director, AF OST. 
5.3.5.6.  Results from OPSEC program management assessment are included in the AF 
OST’s annual report to the Air Force OPSEC Program Manager.  These results provide 
OPSEC vulnerability trends and allow for the development of effective protective 
measures. 
5.3.5.7.  AF/MAJCOM/DRU OPSEC Program Managers and FOA OPSEC Signature 
Managers are the focal point for requesting and scheduling all external assessments and 
setting all priorities between command organizations. 
5.4.  Air Force OPSEC Support Team.  The AF OST is the “operational arm” of Air Force 
OPSEC.  The AF OST conducts OPSEC assessments and provides “reach back” support to Air 
Force units worldwide to include support to OPSEC program development, planning efforts, 
development of protection methods and development and availability of OPSEC education 
materials.  The AF OST is responsible for: 
5.4.1.  Program Development: Provides support at the strategic through tactical level in the 
development of an OPSEC program.  Such as support to build and maintain an OPSEC 
program, development of an OPSEC Implementation Plan and/or provide knowledge and 
experience (helpdesk type function). 
5.4.2.  Planning: Provides support at the strategic through tactical level through the 
development and maintenance of operational plans.  This support may include support in 
areas such as building and maintaining an OPSEC operational planning capability, provide 
framework of a plan annex, development of countermeasures and mitigation methods,

Chapter 6 
ELECTRONIC SYSTEM SECURITY ASSESSMENT (ESSA) 
6.1.  Overview.  The Air Force employs electronic communications systems such as telephones, 
cellular phones, radios, pagers, computers, computer networks, internet-based capabilities such 
as blogs, web-sites, social networking sites and other wired or wireless electronic devices to 
conduct day-to-day official business.  Adversaries can easily monitor these systems to gather 
information regarding military capabilities, limitations, intentions, and activities.  ESSAs provide 
commanders/directors the type and amount of information traversing DoD electronic 
communication systems that is at risk to adversary collection and exploitation.  Assessments can 
be used to evaluate personnel compliance with information, personnel, and industrial security 
practices, communications security and cybersecurity procedures, the implementation and 
effectiveness of information operations, information warfare and military deception activities 
and the identification of potential OPSEC vulnerabilities.  They are also used to support other 
security operations, activities, and programs to enhance force protection and focus training 
requirements. 
6.2.  Purpose. 
6.2.1.  The Air Force monitors, collects, and analyzes information from Air Force electronic 
communications systems to determine if any critical or classified information transmitted via 
unsecured means could adversely affect US (and allied/coalition) operations. 
6.2.2.  The use of ESSAs are an integral part of Air Force OPSEC, Information Operations, 
and Red Teaming.  An ESSA is an effective tool to help assess the effectiveness of OPSEC 
and identify data disclosures that can adversely affect the DoD’s ability to maintain essential 
secrecy. 
6.2.3.  An ESSA identifies information content transmitted across DoD electronic 
communication systems in order to assess an organization’s OPSEC and network security 
posture and determine the amount and type of information available to adversary collection 
entities. 
6.3.  Monitoring Authority. 
6.3.1.  The authority to monitor Air Force networks is derived from the Federal Information 
Security Modernization Act 44, USC 3554.  Additional authority and/or legal restrictions 
may apply based on the specific intent and purpose for the monitoring. 
6.3.2.  The Cyberspace Defense Analysis Weapon System is the only Air Force capability 
authorized to conduct ESSA activities.  Cyberspace Defense Analysis operators accomplish 
these activities within specific legal parameters utilizing authorized tools to monitor, collect, 
and transfer telecommunication data for analysis.  They perform ESSA activities in a manner 
that satisfies the legitimate needs of the Air Force to provide OPSEC assessments while 
protecting the legal rights and civil liberties of those persons whose communications are 
subject to communications monitoring. 
 
 
42 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
6.3.3.  Monitoring resources can be adjusted during exercises, crises, contingencies, and 
conflicts.  The monitoring and subsequent analysis of data are designed to thoroughly 
examine communication system procedures associated with a specific weapons system, 
operation, or activity (focused assessment), and document their vulnerability to hostile 
intelligence collection and exploitation.  These assessments are also conducted to provide 
information and data into the OPSEC risk analysis process, gauge the overall effectiveness of 
an activity, program, or operation, and to support Information Operation/Information 
Warfare objectives. 
6.4.  ESSA Request Priorities.  ESSA missions are prioritized as follows: 
6.4.1.  Priority 1: Military operations: 
6.4.1.1.  Priority 1A: Major operations and campaigns 
6.4.1.2.  Priority 1B: Special operations

6.4.7.  Priority 7: All other assessments 
6.5.  Release of Monitoring Information.  Cyberspace Defense Analysis operators may release 
identifying information as provided in this section.  In all other cases, information that could 
reasonably identify individuals in assessed offices, flights, or sections, such as titles, names, 
ranks, complete phone numbers, complete e-mail addresses will not be released to customers.  
Office symbols may be released if the release of the office symbol does not provide sufficient 
data to identify an individual.  As long as the information in a product does not identify specific 
individuals as the source of the disclosure, a product may contain names, titles, or ranks when it 
is an integral part of the possible disclosure. 
6.5.1.  Adverse or Disciplinary Personnel Actions.  Information obtained during an ESSA 
mission will not be used as evidence in a criminal prosecution without approval of SAF/GC.  
(T-0). 
6.5.2.  Emergency Situations.  If information threatening death, serious bodily harm, 
significant or intentional compromise of classified information, or major loss of property is 
obtained during an ESSA: 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
43 
6.5.2.1.  Immediately report this information, as appropriate, to the military commander, 
AFOSI, U. S. law enforcement agency having jurisdiction of the effected organization, or 
other agency as necessary to resolve the emergency. 
6.5.2.2.  Use the most expeditious means of reporting that provides full security. 
6.5.2.3.  Complete identifying data may be released. 
6.5.2.4.  Until properly reported, the emergency situation has priority.  Resources may be 
re-assigned and other assessment missions may be suspended or delayed as necessary. 
6.5.2.5.  Although derived from ESSA activity, emergency information is not included in 
any ESSA product. 
6.5.2.6.  Notify, via email, ACC/JA within 24-hours of initial reporting. 
6.5.3.  Criminal, Foreign Intelligence, and Counterintelligence Information.  Information 
incidentally acquired during ESSA activities that directly relates to criminal, foreign 
intelligence, and counterintelligence information is reported as follows: 
6.5.3.1.  Immediately report this information to the unit commander and AFOSI. 
6.5.3.2.  Complete identifying data may be released. 
6.5.3.3.  Although derived from ESSA activity, this data is not included in any ESSA 
product. 
6.5.3.4.  Notify, via email, ACC/JA within 24-hours of initial reporting.  ACC/JA 
provides a legal review of the report and forwards via command Judge Advocate General 
Channels to AF/JA and SAF/GC. 
6.5.4.  Classified Information.  If information revealing a compromise or continuing threat of 
a compromise of classified information is obtained during the assessment, follow the 
reporting guidance within AFI 16-1404, Air Force Information Security Program.  If found 
within an assessed communication: 
6.5.4.1.  Release only the minimum amount of data necessary to ensure prompt remedial 
action.  Within the report briefly summarize the information that was sent and its 
classification. 
6.5.4.2.  If an attachment is present, it may also be sent using secure means to the 
appropriate information protection office, MAJCOM/DRU OPSEC Program Manager for 
evaluation.  The information protection office is the first level of management for 
classified information. 
6.5.4.3.  Release pertinent information to the appropriate commander, network control 
officials, information protection office, or MAJCOM/DRU OPSEC Program Manager to 
facilitate the positive identification, containment, and remediation of disclosed data.  
Pertinent information may include full header information (to, from and cc lines or 
sending/receiving addresses; dates/times; and subject line) or account information 
(enclave, username or hostname, password and /or identity certificate). 
6.5.5.  Distinguished Visitor Movements.  If encountered during an assessment, properly 
report the distinguished visitor movement information IAW AFI 71-101, Volume 2, 
Protective Service Matters, and include this information in an ESSA product. 
44 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
6.5.5.1.  Report high-level distinguished visitor movements, such as the President, Vice 
President, and foreign heads of state or foreign ambassadors.  Report data pertaining to 
specific dangerous situations and/or a threat, plan, or attempt to physically harm or 
kidnap certain individuals, as described in AFI 71-101V2.  Report this information to the 
local AFOSI detachment of the ESSA operation, who in-turn reports this information to 
the local AFOSI detachment at the assessed location. 
6.5.5.2.  Derivatively classify products utilizing the applicable security classification 
guide or source document.  Specific itineraries may carry a higher classification based on 
trip sensitivity.  For information regarding classification guides contact your local 
information protection office. 
6.5.6.  Vulnerabilities to Government Owned/Leased Networks and/or Databases.  If 
vulnerabilities to government owned or leased networks or databases are discovered in the 
course of an ESSA, release pertinent information to the appropriate commander, network 
control officials, information protection office, or MAJCOM/DRU OPSEC Program 
Manager to facilitate the positive identification, containment, and remediation of disclosed 
data.  See paragraph 6.5.4.3 for a list of pertinent information that may be released.  
Vulnerabilities are defined as a release of user credentials of government owned or operated 
systems, network topology data, compromises of personally identifiable information, or other 
information that may allow an adversary to attack or exploit Air Force networks.  Exception: 
Communications to and from various help desks or Cybersecurity offices to report and 
resolve network or systems issues are not reported. 
6.5.7.  Breach of personally identifiable information.  Breaches of personally identifiable 
information must be reported as directed in AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program and 
Civil Liberties Program.  A reportable personally identifiable information breach is defined 
as “actual or possible loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized 
acquisition, unauthorized access, or any similar term referring to situations where persons 
other than authorized users and for an other than authorized purpose have access or potential 
access to personally identifiable information, whether physical or electronic.”  In such cases, 
report the names of all parties who committed the potential breach, the facts, and the 
circumstances around the potential breach to the servicing Air Force Installation and Mission 
Support Center Privacy Act Program Manager and associated MAJCOM/DRU OPSEC 
Program Manager. 
6.6.  ESSA Products.  ESSA products are classified and marked according to DoD Instruction 
O-3600.02, Information Operations (IO) Security Classification Guidance, DoDM 5200.01, 
Volume 4, DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).  
When appropriate, prior to release, all ESSA products are marked and protected at a minimum of 
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY to ensure a thorough evaluation for classification.  ESSA products 
that contain information revealing specific DoD vulnerabilities and the compiled results of 
vulnerability analysis will be classified at the SECRET level and require appropriate protection 
levels to control access to the information.  (T-0). 
6.6.1.  Types of ESSA Products.  There are two basic types of ESSA products, reports and 
transcripts. 
6.6.1.1.  Reports.  ESSA reports provide operational commanders with awareness of 
critical information or through compilation classified information disclosures that may 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
45 
adversely affect U.S. (and allied/coalition) operations.  Commanders should use these 
reports for evaluating the effectiveness of OPSEC countermeasures and developing 
measures to diminish the value of disclosed information.  ESSA reports include 
information protection alerts, immediate, trend, and summary reports.  ESSA reports are 
provided to all organizations effected whether the ESSA is a part of continuous 
monitoring or a focused assessment.  ESSA products are sent to those organizations that 
are impacted by the information disclosed, data loss, or vulnerability trend.  At a 
minimum, a copy of all sanitized ESSA products will be sent to the higher headquarters 
OPSEC Program Manager of all the affected organizations and the AF OST when the 
disclosing organization is scheduled for an OPSEC external assessment. 
6.6.1.1.1.  An Information Protection Alert is a shortened reporting format used to 
notify the customer of possible disclosures upon discovery during an ongoing 
assessment.  These alerts may contain information of value to foreign intelligence 
collection services, unclassified critical information, or information pertaining to the 
movement of high level distinguished visitors. 
6.6.1.1.2.  Immediate reports provide time-critical information, force protection 
information, compromises of classified information, and/or mission critical 
information during exercise and real-world operations. 
6.6.1.1.3.  Trend reports are issued whenever analysis uncovers a significant trend of 
damage and/or vulnerabilities.  These reports may summarize and analyze damage 
and/or vulnerabilities covered in previous ESSA reports or OPSEC indicators in 
aggregate that uncover larger vulnerabilities.  Trend reports may be labeled as ESSA, 
but may contain information from ESSA-derived information as well as, non-ESSA-
derived sources. 
6.6.1.1.4.  Summary reports are used to review all information gathered following a 
completed organization requested ESSA.  The summary report reviews all 
information put at risk or disclosed and all information in aggregate used during the 
risk and damage assessments.  This report is typically issued within 60-calendar days 
of completion of the assessment.  Summary reports may be labeled as ESSA, but may 
contain information from ESSA-derived information as well as, non-ESSA-derived 
sources. 
6.6.1.2.  ESSA Transcripts.  There are two types of transcripts, sanitized and un-sanitized.  
A transcript can be part or all of a verbatim reproduction of an assessed communication 
and may include certain identifying information (sanitized versus un-sanitized).  It may 
also contain transcriber’s comments or remarks to clarify or enhance understanding of the 
information presented.  All transcripts (sanitized or un-sanitized) are classified according 
to content.  All markings for both classified and unclassified transcripts must be IAW 
DoD Instruction O-3600.02, Information Operations (IO) Security Classification 
Guidance, DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2, DoD Information Security Program: Marking of 
Information and DoDM 5200.01, Volume 4, Information Security Program: Control 
Unclassified Information (CUI).  (T-0). 
 
 
46 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
6.6.1.2.1.  Sanitized transcripts are furnished upon request of an organization.  A 
sanitized transcript is a true representation of a communication but will not contain 
personally identifiable information.  Sanitized transcripts may be requested by the 
higher headquarters OPSEC Program Manager of the affected organization and the 
AF OST when the disclosing organization is scheduled for an OPSEC external 
assessment. 
6.6.1.2.2.  Un-sanitized transcripts are true and complete representation of a 
communication(s).  Un-sanitized transcript may be attached to or included in other 
reports to streamline notifications when possible.  An organization may request an 
un-sanitized transcript.  An un-sanitized transcript includes both the sending and 
receiving communicator’s information (if available).  Un-sanitized transcripts may be 
requested by the higher headquarters OPSEC Program Manager of the affected 
organization. 
6.7.  Active Indicator Monitoring Products.  Active Indicator Monitoring products are used to 
report network vulnerabilities and personally identifiable information disclosures, as described in 
sections 6.5.6. and 6.5.7. 
6.7.1.  A personally identifiable information report may be generated when identifying 
information specific to an individual has been sent unencrypted from or to an Air Force 
Information Network account.  Cyberspace Defense Analysis units will not retain personally 
identifiable information after reporting procedures have been accomplished, except as 
required to support compliance with Federal laws and Air Force guidance or for formal 
training purposes. 
6.7.2.  A Network Vulnerability Report is generated when monitoring reveals the disclosure 
of information that may result in the compromise of government networks or systems.  A 
Network Vulnerability Credential Report identifies the disclosure of individual or group 
credentials for a government account or system.  A Network Vulnerability Baseline Report 
identifies the disclosure of a listing of hardware or software details for an Air Force system 
or network.  A Network Vulnerability Topology Report identifies the disclosure of the 
topological structure of an Air Force network, such as in network diagrams. 
6.8.  Other Products.  Cyberspace Operations Risk Assessment reports analyze the impact of 
potential and confirmed disclosures of data from adversary exfiltration.  Cyberspace Operations 
Risk Assessment applies OPSEC principles and processes in the conduct of responsive and 
systematic analysis of the content and impact of disclosed data leaving the Air Force Information 
Network.  Authorities for Cyberspace Operations Risk Assessment missions are derived from 
AFI 17-201, Command and Control (C2) for Cyberspace Operations.  Other products may be 
generated as needed to meet disclosure release requirements.

Chapter 7 
OPSEC PLANNING 
7.1.  General.  This chapter provides direction for planners to integrate OPSEC into operational 
plans. 
7.1.1.  The continuous planning, implementation and assessment of countermeasures 
throughout military operations enhance a commander’s ability to shape the information 
environment, achieve desired effects and meet operational objectives.  The basic principles, 
capabilities and activities of OPSEC planning remain the same whether units are at home 
station or deployed—only the specific focus of the planning process changes.  OPSEC 
provides systematic and comprehensive analysis designed to identify and manage observable 
friendly actions that could portray intentions and/or capabilities and is most effective when 
integrated with other information related capabilities as part of the strategy development, 
planning and execution phases of operations. 
7.1.2.  OPSEC planning efforts may result in formal portions of an operational planning 
document (i.e., Tab C to Appendix 3 to Annex C of an operational plan) or a separate 
OPSEC Plan (also referred to as a Signature Management Plan) that focuses on a small-scale, 
limited event requiring specific, additional OPSEC countermeasures (i.e., the silent 
movement of aircraft overseas).  Examples of OPSEC planning products are available from 
the AF OST. 
7.1.3.  Proper OPSEC planning ensures that sensitivities of friendly operations are identified, 
vulnerabilities to the hostile intelligence collection and exploitation are assessed and 
protective measures are identified and executed. 
7.2.  Incorporating OPSEC into Operational Planning.  Operational planning is typically 
focused at the AFFOR and/or AOC, with reach-back support outside the theater when 
appropriate.  When planning duties are split, all responsible entities integrate OPSEC into their 
planning efforts (see also Joint Publication 3-13.3, Operations Security, Chapter 3).  When there 
is no Component-MAJCOM, as the supported organization, the theater AOC resolves debates 
and provides general guidance.  OPSEC Planners are the focal point for integrating OPSEC into 
the operational planning function using skills and processes learned in the Defense OPSEC 
Planners Course or equivalent course. 
7.2.1.  OPSEC planning and subsequent executed countermeasures focus on protecting the 
operation’s overall essential secrets as defined by the Combatant Command or Joint Task 
Force Commander and their designated planning staff.  OPSEC Planners consider the 
standardized operational aspects of presence, capability, strength, intent, readiness, timing, 
location and method to identify appropriate essential secrets.  Analysis results of the five-part 
OPSEC process translate specifically to the seven steps of the Joint Planning Process. 
 
 
48 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
7.2.2.  OPSEC will be included in all operation plans, concept plans and operation orders, 
etc.  Planners will use established tactics, techniques and procedures to develop Tab C to 
Appendix 3 to Annex C to the operation order or operational plan.  The planning staff will 
identify critical information and indicators from all functional areas requiring protection 
throughout each phase of the operation.  Use risk assessments to identify applicable 
countermeasures to mitigate any unacceptable operational risks.  Develop measures of 
performance and measures of effectiveness for each OPSEC countermeasure.  Review plans 
annually and update as needed.  Consider changes in the threat, vulnerabilities, impact to the 
plan and measures of effectiveness and measures of performance of implemented 
countermeasures. 
7.2.3.  Component headquarters will include in their OPSEC Plans the Critical Information 
and Indicators List, threats, vulnerabilities, countermeasures and points of contact for 
supporting organizations (e.g. wings/wing-equivalents deploying for exercises, operations 
and/or systems under development and sustainment).  This action will occur as soon as the 
organization(s) are identified so that critical information and indicators can be protected 
before there are compromises to operations or system acquisitions.  Classify OPSEC Plans 
IAW respective security classification guidance. 
7.2.4.  OPSEC Program Managers, OPSEC Signature Managers and/or OPSEC Coordinators 
assist organizational planners and OPSEC Planners to incorporate protection of critical 
information and indicators into supported operational plans, concept plans and supporting 
plans. 
7.3.  Incorporating OPSEC into Support Plans.  Along with wartime operational plans, 
OPSEC will be integrated into all support plans (e.g., programming plans and in-garrison 
expeditionary site plans).  Note: See AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning, 
for Base Support Plan requirements and format. 
7.4.  Incorporating OPSEC into Exercise Planning.  To enhance a unit’s combat readiness and 
improve crisis response capabilities units should include OPSEC into their exercise plans.  
OPSEC Planners should identify specific training objectives for the exercise and achieve the 
objectives using OPSEC-focused scenarios to assist the training audience and exercise control 
group during the training event.  Incorporate specific OPSEC scenarios into the exercise’s 
Master Scenario Events Listings, along with specific measures of performance and measures of 
effectiveness to assess the proficiency of Commanders to mitigate loss of critical information 
and indicators as well as validating personnel’s ability to execute countermeasures.  OPSEC 
Planners should plan and implement OPSEC countermeasures for exercises to minimize 
observations of sensitive training activities by adversary surveillance and treaty verification 
activities. 
7.4.1.  For wing level exercises, OPSEC Signature Managers, OPSEC Planners and OPSEC 
Coordinators assist Wing Inspection Team members and exercise planners in developing 
Master Scenario Events Listings and measures of performance to train organization 
personnel in the application or execution of countermeasures. 
 
 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
49 
7.4.2.  For exercises higher than the wing level, OPSEC Program Managers, OPSEC 
Planners, OPSEC subject matter experts within the exercise control group that develop 
OPSEC scenarios and implementers that directly reflect the exercised unit's missions and 
operations as tasked in applicable concept plans, executive orders and/or operational plans.  
Scenarios and implementers must measure impact to operations and mission success if 
OPSEC is not implemented.  Track Master Scenario Events Listing injects in Joint Training 
Information Management System from start to completion in order to validate a units’ ability 
to complete OPSEC Mission Essential Task and rate the unit with T (Trained), P (Partially 
Trained), U (Untrained).  Joint Training Information Management System provides visibility 
to wing and above unit training status, allows exercised units to define yearly training 
requirements and provides training objectives for future exercises. 
7.4.3.  Evaluators submit deficiencies or best practices to the MAJCOM OPSEC Program 
Manager 
for 
inclusion 
into 
the 
Air 
Force 
Lessons 
Learned 
Database 
https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12989/default.aspx. 
7.4.4.  Evaluators submit lessons learned and after-action reports to MAJCOM OPSEC 
Program Managers within 45 days of completion of the exercise or operation when 
something significant or potentially useful was identified during the event.  These documents 
are used to develop tactics improvement proposals IAW AFI 10-204, Air Force Service 
Exercise Program and Support to Joint and National Exercise Program and AFI 11-260, 
Tactics Development Program. 
7.4.5.  Lessons Learned Validation and Resolution: MAJCOM OPSEC Program Managers 
review and track lessons learned observations to ensure accuracy and applicability. 
7.4.6.  Concepts and ideas for exercise OPSEC scenarios are often identified from previous 
operational experiences, inspections, OPSEC program management assessments, OPSEC 
external assessments and ESSA support.  Ideas and concepts to incorporate OPSEC into 
exercises are available from the AF OST.

Chapter 8 
OPSEC REQUIREMENTS WITHIN ACQUISITIONS AND CONTRACTING 
8.1.  Incorporating OPSEC into the Acquisitions and Contracting Process.  OPSEC must be 
considered throughout the lifecycle of the DoD Acquisitions and contractor-supported efforts.  It 
is essential to integrate OPSEC into the earliest stages beginning with operational capabilities 
requirements generation and continue through the award process, design, development, test and 
evaluation, fielding, sustainment and system disposal.  OPSEC requirements within acquisitions 
and contracting ensure critical information and/or indicators are not prematurely released to 
vendors.  This applies to all types of contracts, including but not limited to service, support, 
acquisition and fundamental research and grants.  Contractors for defense systems acquisition 
programs as well as other types of DoD contracts will practice OPSEC to protect critical 
information and indicators as specified in government contracts and subcontracts. 
8.2.  Organizational Responsibilities.  Organizations requesting contract support determine and 
communicate the OPSEC measures required for each contract and ensure they are included in 
requests for proposal, statements of work, performance work statements, statement of operations, 
or other contract documents. 
8.3.  Document Reviews. 
8.3.1.  OPSEC Program Managers and OPSEC Signature Managers in coordination with the 
contract requirement owners are responsible for the review of contract documents to ensure 
critical information and/or indicators are not made available to the public.  An approved 
Critical Information and Indicator List will be used as a reference when conducting reviews. 
8.3.2.  When an OPSEC Coordinator or Contracting representative is conducting the review, 
the OPSEC Program Manager/OPSEC Signature Manager provides technical guidance and 
an approved Critical Information and Indicators List to assist in the analysis of information 
within the contract documents. 
8.3.3.  If it is determined that a contract document contains critical information and/or 
indicators associated with the performance of the contract, the requesting organization will 
develop an OPSEC Plan to protect the critical information and/or indicators associated with 
the contract from cradle to grave. 
8.3.4.  The requesting organization will specify OPSEC requirements for unclassified and 
classified contracts in requests for proposal, statements of work, performance work 
statements, statement of operations, or other contract documents.  (T-1). 
8.3.4.1.  Provide sufficient detail to ensure complete contractor understanding of the 
requirements to protect the critical information and/or indicators (e.g., what do you want 
the contractor to do, how do you want the contractor to comply, when do you want the 
contractor to comply, who is going to provide OPSEC training). 
8.3.4.2.  Do not include critical information and indicators in unclassified contract 
documents.  (T-0). 
AFI10-701  24 JULY 2019 
51 
8.3.4.3.  Ensure DD Form 254, Department of Defense Contract Security Classification 
Specification is appropriately annotated IAW AFI 16-1406, Air Force Industrial Security 
Program, for classified contracts that require OPSEC measures.  (T-0). 
8.3.5.  If required, organizations will provide the contractor a copy of the OPSEC Plan 
associated with the contract.  (T-2).

assessing OPSEC.  Includes individuals such as OPSEC Program Managers, OPSEC Signature 
Manager, OPSEC Coordinators, OPSEC Support Teams, OPSEC Instructors and OPSEC 
Planners. 
OPSEC Program Management Assessment—An in-depth evaluation of the implementation 
and effectiveness of an organization’s OPSEC program.  OPSEC program management 
assessments are conducted by a team of subject matter experts to provide a detailed analysis of 
an OPSEC program’s effectiveness by completing a thorough analysis of how the program is 
implemented, executed, supported and managed. 
OPSEC Program Manager—A full-time appointee or primary representative assigned to 
develop and manage an OPSEC program.

OPSEC Vulnerability—A condition in which friendly actions provide OPSEC indicators that 
may be obtained and accurately evaluated by an adversary in time to prove a basis for effective 
adversary decision making. 
OPSEC Working Group—Designated body representing a broad range of line and staff 
activities within an organization that provides advice and support to leadership and all elements 
of the organization.  This can be an OPSEC, SM, threat, or public affairs working group that

Personally Identifiable Information Breach—An actual or possible loss of control, 
compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or any 
similar term referring to situations where persons other than authorized users and for an other 
than authorized purpose have access or potential access to personally identifiable information, 
whether physical or electronic. 
Profile—The characteristic of an indicator that refers to the sum of unique signatures and 
associations generated by a functional activity. 
Profiling Process—Defining the local operating environment and capture process points that 
present key signatures and profiles with critical information value.  This process is the deliberate 
effort to identify functional areas processes and the observables they produce to contribute to the 
overall signature of day-to-day activities and operational trends. 
Range Of Military Operations—The general categories of operations within which the military 
participates to fulfill the general strategic goals of the US government.  These operations are 
broadly defined as War and Operations Other Than War.  War involves combat operations and 
has as its general goal the ability to fight and win.  Operations Other Than War may involve 
noncombat or combat operations; the general goals of these operations are, respectively, promote 
peace and deter war/resolve conflict. 
Risk—A measure of the potential degree to which protected information is subject to loss 
through adversary exploitation. 
Risk Analysis—A method by which individual vulnerabilities are compared to perceived or 
actual security threat scenarios to determine the likelihood of compromise of critical information. 
Risk Assessment—A process of evaluating the risks to information based on susceptibility to 
intelligence collection and the anticipated severity of loss. 
Self-Assessment Communicator—A two-way communication tool designed to improve 
compliance with published guidance and communicate risk and program health up and down the 
chain of command in near real-time. 
Sensor—The collection element of the conduit or information pathway which identifies, 
registers and subsequently transmits data. 
Signals Intelligence—A category of intelligence comprising either individually or in 
combination all communications intelligence, electronic intelligence, and foreign instrumentation 
signals intelligence, however transmitted. 
Signature—Observable activities and operational trends that reveal critical information to 
adversary intelligence collection.

Signature Management—A systematic approach to identify, prioritize, and manage physical, 
technical, and administrative indicators of friendly forces’ operational profiles that, if ignored, 
will be exploited by an adversary to achieve an operational advantage over friendly force 
objectives. 
Social Media—An online social platform or site used to share information, communicate, and 
build relationships with the public. 
Threat—The capability of an adversary coupled with his intentions to undertake any actions 
detrimental to the success of program activities or operations. 
Threat Assessment—An evaluation of the intelligence collection threat to a program activity, 
system, or operation. 
Transcript—All or part of a verbatim reproduction of an assessed communication and may 
include certain identifying information.  It may also contain transcriber’s comments or remarks 
to clarify or enhance understanding of the information presented. 
Unsecured—Communications that do not use authorized cryptographic products or protected 
distribution systems. 
Vulnerability—An exploitable condition in which the adversary has sufficient knowledge, time 
and available resources to thwart friendly mission accomplishment or substantially increase 
operational risk. 
Vulnerability Analysis—A process that examines a friendly operation or activity from the point 
of view of an adversary, seeking ways in which the adversary might determine critical 
information in time to disrupt or defeat the operation or activity.
