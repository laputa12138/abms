GENERAL INFORMATION 
 
1.1. Overview. This manual establishes the training program for all AFSPECWAR Airmen, 
creating a framework that accommodates the unique requirements of AFSPECWAR training 
while leveraging proven elements from the Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 36-
2670, Total Force Development; DAFMAN 36-2689, Training Program; and AFMAN 11-
202V1. It establishes requirements for training and outlines currency and proficiency standards. 
 
1.1.1. The overall objective is to develop and maintain a high state of mission readiness to 
facilitate immediate and effective employment in exercises and across the range of military 
operations. Though not all inclusive, training should be structured to provide mission 
capability based on employment concepts identified in the unit’s Designed Operational 
Capability (DOC) statement and approved unit mission essential task list (METL). 
 
1.1.2. Units design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked roles, 
maintain proficiency (as defined in the specific career field education and training plans 
(CFETPs)), and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. 
 
1.2. Key Terms and Definitions. 
 
1.2.1. AFSPECWAR Collaborative Site. The AFSPECWAR SharePoint site, which is 
maintained by AF/A3S, is a repository for all AF/A3S created publications and a source for 
AFSPECWAR information. 
 
1.2.2. AFSPECWAR Operators. The term AFSPECWAR operator is restricted to members 
who hold a Control AFSC of 1ZXXX or 19ZXX, not the overarching AFSPECWAR 
enterprise. 
 
1.2.3. Operations Group (OG). OG is used as a generic term used to encompass Air Support 
Operations Groups, Rescue Groups, Special Operations Groups, Special Tactics Groups, and 
the Special Warfare Training Group. 
 
1.2.4. Formal Training Units (FTUs). FTUs are the Guardian Angel (GA) FTU (68th Rescue 
Squadron), the Special Tactics Training Squadron, and the TACP FTU (6th Combat 
Training Squadron, Detachment 2). 
 
1.2.5. Readiness Tasking Message (RTM). An RTM is a message sent from the major 
command (MAJCOM) to all subordinate units with operators assigned. It lists the task 
events and full mission profiles (FMPs) required to sustain CMR status. Note: When 
applicable, Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is also required for Basic Mission 
Capable (BMC) status as defined in the prescribing publication(s). 
 
 
 
6 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V1  3 JUNE 2025 
 
1.2.6. Instructor. An AFSPECWAR operator who is qualified in accordance with Chapter 5 
and the Instructor QTP to conduct task training and certification for any task on which they 
are trained and current. 
 
1.2.7. Trainer and Certifier. A member other than an AFSPECWAR operator who is 
certified to conduct and document training on CFETP tasks that they are current and 
certified or qualified to perform. At a minimum, they must meet all requirements for trainers 
listed in DAFMAN 36-2689, complete a MAJCOM-approved trainer upgrade, and be 
designated by the commander. (T-1) For the purposes of this document, references to 
instructors also apply when the task is being trained by a trainer. 
 
1.2.8. Certification. Procedure used to document competency in a particular task. 
Certification is accomplished through completion of instruction with a DAF Form 623A, 
On-the-Job Training (OJT) Record Continuation Sheet; or DAF Form 797, Job 
Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS. Certifiers designated by the 
commander may also complete an Air Force (AF) Form 1035, AFSPECWAR Evaluation 
Form, in a particular task.  
 
1.2.9. Qualification. Designation arising from graduating an approved course or a successful 
evaluation, documented on an AF Form 1035 that allows a member to perform specified 
duties. 
 
1.3. AFSPECWAR Operator Utilization. Reference DAFI 36-2606, Reenlistment and 
Extension of Enlistment, for utilization restrictions of Selective Reenlistment Bonus recipients. 
Note: DAFI 36-2606 states duties may not be performed outside the Selective Reenlistment 
Bonus specialty for more than 90 combined days in a 360-day period. See DAFI 36-2606 for 
detailed guidance. 
 
1.4. Training While Medically Restricted. While medically restricted, operators may conduct, 
and log training events not prohibited by the medical restriction. AFSPECWAR operators are 
entitled to Special Warfare Skill Incentive Pay (SWSIP) and special duty incentive pay for up to 
365 days while in “down” status. Operators will not be temporarily returned to “up” status for 
the purpose of SWSIP or Special Duty pay. (T-1) 
 
1.4.1. Duty Limiting Conditions, either temporary or permanent, will be annotated and 
communicated via AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report, and Department of 
Defense (DD) Form 2992, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational 
Duty, from medical authorities to commanders as defined by DAFMAN 48-123, Medical 
Examinations and Standards; the Medical Standards Directory (MSD); and AFI 48-133, 
Duty Limiting Conditions. An AF Form 469 outlines limitations, duration, and impact on 
duties not including Fly, Jump, Controlling, or Alert for all personnel. For conditions that 
may limit Fly, Jump, Controlling, or Alert, an individual is placed on “down” status when a 
competent medical authority, as designated by the Air Force Surgeon General marks block 
12 on DD Form 2992. An operator will also be placed on “down” status for an expired 
annual Preventative Health Assessment (PHA). (T-1) 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V1  3 JUNE 2025 
 
7 
 
1.4.2. Returning personnel to “up” status is restricted to aeromedical providers qualified in 
accordance with AFMAN 48-149, Flight and Operational Medicine Program (FOMP). 
Additionally, AFSPECWAR operators may work with a qualified aeromedical provider to 
annotate on their DD Form 2992 which duties may be performed while on “down” status, as 
these operators might be able to safely train on specific tasks or in a simulator environment, 
depending on their medical illness or injury. However, operators must not control live 
aircraft while in a live-virtual or live-virtual-constructive simulator environment while in 
down status. (T-2) 
 
1.5. Waiver Authority. Unless otherwise specified, AF/A3S is the waiver authority for the 
provisions of this publication. Submit waiver requests through the appropriate chain of command 
using DAF Form 679, Department of the Air Force Publication Compliance Item Waiver 
Request/Approval. Note: All blanket waivers require AF/A3S coordination.

QUALIFICATION TRAINING 
 
3.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). AFSPECWAR IQT requirements are completed 
during the AFS’ respective AETC apprentice courses. Graduates of IQT formal course training 
will be proficient in all 3-level tasks as indicated by the career field specialty training standards. 
(T-1) Note: This does not include specific qualifications (e.g., JTAC qualification). 
 
3.2. Local In-Processing. Gaining units will establish OJT records for operators arriving after 
completion of IQT and determine remaining local in-processing requirements in accordance with 
Table A2.2 for all newly assigned operators.  
 
3.3. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT is the training needed to qualify operators to 
accomplish a unit’s mission essential tasks. These items may be prescribed by either functional 
or command channels. Operators must complete MQT as a prerequisite for attaining CMR (and 
BMC when applicable). (T-2) Note: With OG/CC concurrence, operators may perform missions 
in support of civil authorities, humanitarian assistance, and other non-combat contingencies prior 
to MQT completion provided the member is trained and current for events to be performed. 
 
3.4. 1Z Skill Level Upgrade Training (UGT). 1Z skill-level UGT is designed to increase 
AFSPECWAR skills. Specified 1T0 UGT requirements will be tailored to increase 
AFSPECWAR skills, when assigned. AFS UGT requirements are outlined in this manual, 
DAFMAN 36-2689 and AFMAN 36-2100, Military Utilization and Classification. 
 
3.4.1. 1Z members must complete all mandatory training requirements outlined in their 
respective AFS CFETP for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels. (T-1) 
 
3.4.2. Tactical Enlisted Leader Qualification. Operators will complete the training in 
accordance with the AF/A3S Tactical Enlisted Leader QTP. (T-2) Note: A prerequisite for 
Tactical Enlisted Leader is qualification as an AFSPECWAR Instructor. 
 
3.5. 19Z Upgrade Training (UGT). 19Zs must complete all mandatory training requirements as 
outlined in this manual, AFMAN 36-2100, the 19Z CFETP, and MAJCOM SOIs (if applicable) 
for award of the 2, 3, and 4-skill levels. (T-1) 
 
3.6. On-the-Job Training (OJT) Certification. Operators generally do not require third party 
certification on tasks listed in their respective training records. There is, however, a small set of 
skills which may require further certification before operators may perform them unsupervised. 
These skills are identified by the respective career field managers in the specific AFS CFETP 
and certified by an instructor or trainer that meets the DAFMAN 36-2689 requirements as a 
certifier. 
 
3.7. Specialized Training Programs. Specialized training (e.g., sensitive activities, alternate 
insertion, and extraction (AIE)) is conducted in accordance with AF/A3S, and MAJCOM 
16 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V1  3 JUNE 2025

Chapter 4 
 
CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT) 
 
4.1. General. Continuation training items define the standards needed to maintain CMR and 
currency on tasks which they are trained. Table A2.1 prescribes the minimum continuation 
training requirements for each AFSC. Table A2.2 lists additional training items that may be 
completed based on mission analysis. These requirements define what is needed to maintain 
currency and do not equate to proficiency. 
 
4.1.1. The RTM is the MAJCOM approved list of FMPs and additional task events from 
Table A2.2 required to maintain unit specific CMR status. Note: RTM approval authority 
may be delegated to the WG/CC in accordance with paragraph 2.2.3. RTM development is 
initiated at the unit level by: 
 
 
 
4.1.1.1. Reviewing assigned METLs and TCSs. 
 
4.1.1.2. Performing mission analysis of upcoming taskings. 
 
4.1.1.3. Identifying FMPs and additional training tasks from Table A2.2, along with 
any increase in frequency and/or quantity that are necessary to mitigate identified risks 
and develop a mission-ready force. 
 
4.1.1.4. Forwarding the mission analysis and recommended FMPs and training tasks up 
the Chain of Command for validation. 
 
4.1.1.5. Echelons of command above the unit review, modify as required, validate the 
unit’s recommendations, and submit to the MAJCOM for approval. 
 
4.1.1.6. The MAJCOM receives the submissions, reviews, modifies as required and 
updates the RTM to reflect the adjudicated FMPs and additional tasks required for each 
unit’s members to achieve CMR. 
 
4.1.1.7. The MAJCOM will maintain all approved RTMs. (T-2) 
 
4.1.2. CMR. Status of satisfactorily completing the specified qualification/certification 
training and maintenance of the minimum currencies to fulfill AFS worldwide combat 
deployment requirements. A member is considered CMR after completion of IQT, MQT, 
and maintaining training frequency in accordance with Table A2.1 and the RTM. 
 
4.1.3. Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR). N-CMR status results from not meeting all 
requirements listed in paragraph 4.1.2. Unless noted, CMR currencies are go/no-go for the 
individual currency event only and operators may conduct training on any other 
qualified/current training items. N-CMR status will disqualify operators from combat 
deployments. (T-2) Note: The tier waiver authority may waive the requirement for CMR 
18 
 
AFMAN 10-3500V1  3 JUNE 2025 
 
status for combat deployments, but this waiver does not waive the requirement to undertake 
any of the CMR requirements in Table A2.1. 
 
4.1.4. Non-Training (NT). NT status results from not meeting designated requirements. No 
AFSPECWAR training events will be conducted until requirements are met. (T-3) Note: 
The tier waiver authority may waive the requirement for NT status for AFSPECWAR 
training events, but this waiver does not waive the requirement to undertake any of the NT 
requirements in Table A2.1. NT waiver may not be delegated lower than the wing 
commander. NT currencies are go/no-go items for all training events except those necessary 
to prepare for and regain currency in the event driving NT status. Note: AFSPECWAR 
personnel who are in NT status may still conduct training items aligned with classroom 
instruction, computer-based training, and/or simulated training events (includes simulator 
training). Identified training events are permitted so long as it does not conflict with a 
member’s existing medical waiver, profile, or exemptions. 
 
4.2. Currency Requirements. Currency is a defined frequency that maintains 
qualification/certification in accordance with documented level of training. Attachment 2 
prescribes currency requirements for all operators. 
 
4.2.1. Frequency Exceeded. If an event’s frequency is exceeded, that event may not be 
performed except for the purpose of regaining currency. Currency will be regained under 
supervision of an instructor who is current in the same task and qualified to the same or 
greater level required by the CFETP. (T-2) 
 
4.2.2. Grace Period. Members trained in tasks with a periodic currency are considered non-
current but trained to the specified level in the event until 181 days following the expiration 
of the currency. Note: Unless directed otherwise by Department of Defense publication. 
After this period, the member must be retrained in accordance with a SQ/CC directed 
retraining, recertification, or requalification program. (T-3) Qualification events require the 
completion of all evaluations for the event in question in accordance with AFMAN 10-
3500V2. (T-2) The SQ/CC may approve adjustments to the training program based on 
individual experience level and training requirements. SQ/CC approved training is 
documented in the individual’s DAF Form 623. 
 
4.2.3. Deployment Currency. If a member goes non-current/overdue in any CMR/NT item 
and has the ability to re-accomplish this task, all efforts will be made to regain currency. If 
the deployed member is unable or prohibited from regaining the currency due to operational 
restrictions, the member will remain current through the duration of the deployment. (T-2) 
Upon return, all overdue currencies will be regained in accordance with paragraph 4.2.1. 
This paragraph also applies to members on a geographically restricted alert. Exception: See 
AFMAN 10-3500V2 for evaluation waiver requirements. 
 
4.2.4. Humanitarian Aid Disaster Response/Defense Support of Civil Authorities. 
AFSPECWAR operators, when authorized may be required to perform missions in support 
of civil authorities, humanitarian assistance, and other non-combat contingencies. Operators 
will be current on all AFS Non-Training items listed in Table A2.1. Additionally, operators 
AFMAN 10-3500V1  3 JUNE 2025 
 
19 
 
will be current on any required mission items to be conducted that are listed in Table A2.2. 
Note: ANG members on Title 32 status during NGB and/or State ordered mobilizations will 
work go-no-go requirements within Table A2.1 and Table A2.2 with individual state 
authorities and chain of command based on mobilization mission requirements.

Notes:  
1. These CMR requirements only pertain to 1T0 personnel assigned to AFSPECWAR units (e.g., Rescue 
Squadron, Special Tactics Squadron, and Air Support Operations Squadron). 
2. Operators who fail the OFT will be due again in 3 months (e.g., if member receives an Unsatisfactory 
on 15 April, then member’s due month is July of the same year). (T-1) It is the member's responsibility to 
ensure they retest before the end of the 3rd month as non-currency begins on 1st calendar day of the 4th 
month. Note: Traditional Reserve (TR), and Drill Status Guardsmen will be due again in 6 months. 
Operators require commander’s approval to test earlier than the 3rd calendar month. (T-3) Operators who 
fail the OFT must take the Air Force Physical Fitness Assessment.   
3. Key Staff Minimum Requirements. Individuals in Student, Trainee, or Personnel Holdee (STP) status 
or filling positions designated in accordance with paragraph 2.1.8 or paragraph 2.2.11 are required to 
complete only these tasks to remain mission qualified. Key staff are only evaluated on tasks for which 
currency is maintained. Key staff must accomplish all AFS identified events above to regain CMR status. 
(T-2) Key staff must complete all task specific Go/No-Go items prior to training or evaluating the task 
(e.g., Military Free Fall (MFF) Emergency Procedures (EPs) before a Freefall jump). (T-2) Key staff will 
be current on all AFS NT tasks prior to conducting training or evaluations. (T-2) 
4. Members must complete TCCC training within 12 months of deployment, Air Reserve Component 
(ARC) members do not have to meet the 36-month currency but must meet the 12-month pre-deployment 
currency. (T-0) 
5. This is a 24-month currency window defined by the National Registry of Emergency Medical 
Technicians (NREMT) as ending 31 March. Members fall into even or odd year cycles based on their 
current NRP certification expiration.  
6. AFQC and Live Fire Sustainment Training are annual requirements that are offset by six months.
