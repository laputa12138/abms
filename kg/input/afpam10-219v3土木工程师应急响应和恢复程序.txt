This volume provides information and guidance for the execution of civil engineer (CE) 
contingency recovery activities. It describes procedures for a rapid transition from routine, day-
to-day operations to an emergency response posture. Using the disaster and attack planning and 
preparation measures of Volumes 1 and 2 as its basis, this volume addresses how CE executes 
tasks to ensure recovery and continued operation of the installation during and after a crisis. This 
publication applies to all Air Force (AF) active, Air Force Reserve Command, and Air National 
Guard CE units. This pamphlet implements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-210, Prime Base 
Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) Program and AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency 
Management (EM) Program Planning and Operation. Refer recommended changes and 
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF 
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This interim change revises AFPAM 10-219V3 by (1) changing Unexploded Explosive 
Ordnance (UXO) reporting procedures in paragraph 5.5.6.1, and (2) changing Table 5.3 to reflect 
Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) 9-Line Report criteria per Air Force Tactics, Techniques 
and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-2.12, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for 
Unexploded Ordnance.  A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

Chapter 1 
CE CONTINGENCY RESPONSE AND RECOVERY 
1.1.  Background.  The unpredictable nature of war and disasters requires a great degree of 
flexibility by the CE force during emergency response and recovery operations. CE units must 
maintain contingency response and recovery capabilities to restore operations, save lives, 
mitigate human suffering, and minimize damage during and after a crisis incident on or near the 
installation. While the CE Contingency Response Plan (CE CRP) and other base plans should be 
followed to ensure a coordinated response, no plan can cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, 
all elements of the CE team must be able to adjust quickly to changing circumstances. 
Immediately after a disaster, attack or other crisis, civil engineers typically operate in the 
reactionary mode to eliminate life-threatening hazards rapidly. In later phases of the recovery, 
the engineer force begins a more deliberate effort. Even though the environment can still be 
chaotic and there may still be many immediate actions to take, the overwhelming dangers that 
prevailed during the onset of the emergency may have passed. The effort to identify and quantify 
the damage, assign repair priorities, and determine recovery strategy then begins. Engineering 
knowledge, experience, and common sense become crucial to base recovery efforts. 
1.2.  Scope.  The information in this pamphlet supports implementation of Air Force Policy 
Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness. It builds upon lessons learned and doctrinal precepts outlined 
in AF Doctrine Volume 5, Support, AF Doctrine Annex 3-34, Engineer Operations, current AF 
policy, and other related and relevant CE publications. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 
1.1. See Attachment 1 for a complete list of references and supporting information. 
1.2.1.  Volumes 1 and 2 of this pamphlet series address CE planning and preparedness for 
natural or manmade disasters and installation attack. This volume, coupled with information 
in Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 10-219, Volume 4, Airfield Damage Repair Operations, 
address measures that support an effective CE contingency recovery capability. Specifically, 
this volume addresses base and unit level CE recovery actions associated with the following 
areas: 
1.2.1.1.  CE Unit Control Center (UCC) operations 
1.2.1.2.   Damage assessments 
1.2.1.3.    Auxiliary fire fighting and search and rescue 
1.2.1.4.  Explosive ordnance reconnaissance (EOR) 
1.2.1.5.  Expedient facility and utility repair processes and strategies 
1.2.1.6.  Operation and maintenance (O&M) and follow-on repairs 
1.2.1.7.  Self-protection and work party security 
1.2.1.8.  Base denial procedures 
1.2.2.  For comprehensive contingency response and recovery activities related to Emergency 
Management (EM), FES, and EOD, users should refer to AFI 10-2501; AFI 32-2001, Fire 
Emergency Services (FES) Program; AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)

1.3.  Roles and Responsibilities.  Most CE unit functions are heavily involved with base 
response and recovery operations after a disaster, attack, or other major crisis. These CE 
operations include fire fighting and rescue, damage assessments, hazard mitigation, airfield and 
facility repair, critical infrastructure restoration (e.g., power, water and sewerage), CBRN 
monitoring, response and control, unit recovery management, and emergency contracting, to 
name a few. The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of CE roles and responsibilities 
associated with emergency response and recovery operations. For additional information, consult 
the references in Attachment 1 and for reach-back support, contact the Air Force Civil Engineer

1.3.1.  The Base Civil Engineer (BCE)/CE Unit Commander.  The BCE/CE Commander 
and engineer staff advises the installation commander and other installation officials on 
contingency response and recovery operations. They are also responsible for providing 
trained forces and available equipment and materials to return the installation quickly to a 
condition where the primary mission can be executed. When an incident or crisis occurs and 
the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is activated, the BCE representative to the EOC is 
the command and control (C2) link between the EOC and the CE force. From the EOC, the 
BCE representative provides direction to airfield damage repair (ADR) crews and damage 
assessment and response teams through the CE UCC. At high-threat locations, the BCE and 
members of the minimum airfield operating surface (MAOS) selection team typically operate 
from the EOC during airfield recovery. Engineering and Operations Management specialists 
may also be attached to assist with CE response and recovery management activities. Other 
CE personnel operating from the EOC may include representatives from the Readiness and 
Emergency Management (R&EM) Flight, FES Flight, EOD and Operations Flights. 
1.3.2.  R&EM.  The role of R&EM is to help ensure force survivability, expeditious 
installation recovery and mission continuation in all threat environments. The R&EM Flight 
provides support to the EOC, Incident Commander (IC), mobile communications capability, 
and specialized teams during incident response and recovery. Flight responsibilities also 
include CBRN detection, warning, and notification, advising commanders on operations in 
contaminated environments, and managing installation contamination control operations. 
R&EM roles and responsibilities are further defined in AFI 10-2501, AFMAN 32-1007, 
Readiness and Emergency Management (R&EM) Flight Operations, and AFMAN 10-2503, 
Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive 
(CBRNE) Environment. 
1.3.3.  FES.  The primary role of FES during and just after an emergency is to rescue 
survivors, keep loss of life to a minimum, and extinguish or prevent the spread of fire. 
Emergency services include aircraft rescue fire fighting, structural fire fighting, technical 
rescue, emergency medical support, and hazardous materials (HAZMAT) response. Due to 
the limited numbers of firefighters, fire vehicles, and equipment, firefighter availability may 
be limited for ancillary tasks such as area contamination control processes. 
1.3.4.  EOD.  EOD response and installation recovery capabilities after an attack or disaster 
include: responding to aircraft and explosive mishaps; identifying, evaluating, rendering safe, 
recovering, and disposing of any explosive threat to include abandoned munitions, 
unexploded ordnances (UXOs), and improvised explosive devices (IEDs); performing 
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) detection, identification, sampling, 
warning, and reporting; recovering airfields denied by ordnance; and assisting mortuary 
services in remains processing. 
1.3.5.  CE UCC.  Generally, UCCs are activated to support installation response and 
recovery operations after a crisis incident. The CE UCC controls and coordinates unit 
response activities, arranges support from other organizations, and serves as the 
commander’s communications conduit for assigned personnel. It is normally staffed with 
highly experienced and knowledgeable CE specialists from various elements of the 
operations flight. See Chapter 2 for additional CE UCC information. 
  10  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
1.3.6.  Installation and Unit Specialized Teams.  Civil engineer units along with other 
assigned units, provide specialized teams to the installation DRF. These specialized groups 
are key elements of the DRF and provide essential support during response and recovery 
operations. Teams include the Emergency Management Support Team (EMST) (formerly the 
Readiness Support Team), Shelter Management Teams (SMTs), Contamination Control 
Teams (CCTs), and Post Attack Reconnaissance (PAR) Teams. See AFI 10-2501 for their 
description and composition. In addition to presenting specialized teams to the DRF, CE 
units also organize other multi-shop, response teams to respond to major incidents. 
1.3.7.  CE Response Teams.  While many peacetime emergencies can be handled without 
forming CE multi-shop response teams, a major natural disaster, major accident, or base 
attack will require special teams in addition to standard shop support. These response teams 
help keep the installation operational during the disaster or attack response period, reduce the 
loss of life, prevent property damage, and identify damage and initiate repairs following an 
emergency. Table 1.1 lists potential CE response teams not previously addressed in this 
chapter. See AFPAM 10-219, Volume 1, Contingency and Disaster Planning, for potential 
composition and organization of CE response teams. These teams are usually formed by 
assigning specific tasks or groups of tasks to various CE shops or flights. Individuals selected 
for positions on these teams should be highly skilled in their specialty and possess the 
maturity, level-headedness, and physical stamina to operate effectively in the chaotic and 
demanding environment that accompanies all catastrophes. The availability of qualified 
personnel at the time of a disaster or attack will be a prime determining factor in how these 
teams are structured. Furthermore, potential threats and manning differences at Continental 
United States (CONUS) and outside CONUS (OCONUS) locations can affect how CE 
response teams are formed. 
1.3.7.1.  CONUS CE Response Teams. Due to the varying sizes and compositions of 
CONUS engineer organizations, the number of response teams, and number of team 
members for each installation can vary. It is incumbent on each BCE to evaluate assigned 
personnel strengths and build the needed response teams. The response teams may be 
filled by military, civilian, or a combination of these forces. 
1.3.7.2.  OCONUS Theater CE Response Teams. By nature of their location, response 
teams at overseas locations have a greater likelihood of facing an attack situation than 
their CONUS counterparts. However, natural disasters cannot be ruled out as a potential 
occurrence. At overseas installations having a peacetime United States Air Force (USAF) 
engineer presence, theater emergency crews for natural disaster response are likely based 
on standard manning document authorizations, at least for the initial stages of response. 
As with the CONUS response teams, military personnel, civilian employees, or a 
combined force may fill team positions. They could be augmented for disaster recovery 
activities if damages exceeded in-house capability to any great extent. For overseas 
locations with no in-place USAF engineer force, deployed Prime Base Engineer 
Emergency Force (BEEF) units would form CE response teams. In an attack situation, 
Prime BEEF forces should be in-place prior to commencement of hostilities, thereby 
forming an integral part of the theater emergency response force by either augmenting in-
place forces or performing as an independent unit. Teams are based on the anticipated 
availability of Prime BEEF forces addressed in the CE Force Module construct.

Chapter 2 
CE COMMAND AND CONTROL 
2.1.  Overview.  The CE UCC is the BCE’s C2 conduit for unit personnel. It is an essential focal 
point within the CE organization during and after major accidents, attacks, or natural disasters. 
The UCC relays information to and from unit personnel, provides engineering expertise to the 
EOC or IC, and leverages unit resources to respond to and mitigate incidents. From the UCC, 
key supervisors coordinate, monitor, and direct CE recovery activities, including emergency 
notifications, personnel accountability, damage assessment, and repair, and other related 
activities. The following paragraphs address key factors related to CE UCC operations, including 
activation and management. For additional information on CE UCC staffing, organization and 
operation beyond what is addressed in this pamphlet, consult AFPAM 10-219, Volume 1. 
2.2.  UCC Activation.  Unit commanders activate their UCCs and initiate unit personnel 
accountability; however, the EOC Director determines which UCCs remain activated. The CE 
UCC is one of several UCCs that may be activated to respond to emergencies. From a CE point 
of view, the responsibilities of the CE UCC are similar to those of the EOC. The difference lies 
in the level of responsibility. The CE UCC monitors and coordinates CE recovery actions related 
to installation damage assessment, decontamination, damage recovery and repairs, and other CE 
CRP tasks. Activation involves staffing, facilities, and communications. 
2.2.1.  Staffing.  Although CE strategies and priorities are determined in the EOC, most of 
the actual engineer functions are controlled or coordinated by the CE UCC. The UCC is 
usually managed by the CE chief of operations and predominantly staffed by operations 
management personnel (Air Force Specialty [AFS] 3E6X1) and senior supervisors from 
select infrastructure support elements of the operations flight (e.g., electrical, water and fuels 
systems, pavements and construction, structural). While usually assigned in the EOC, FES 
and EOD representatives may also be on the staff. The typical CE UCC staff generally ranges 
between 7-11 personnel. 
2.2.1.1.  Operations managers are central to UCC operations and C2. They perform many 
tasks to standup and maintain the UCC; such as, keeping status of personnel, equipment, 
and vehicles; scheduling jobs; allocating resources; and coordinating information 
between the EOC and other unit UCCs. Other duties may include the following:

centers 
2.2.1.1.5.  Monitor and report on the availability of specialized skills and required 
equipment 
2.2.1.1.6.  Site, manage, and operate an alternate UCC 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  13  
2.2.1.2.  Engineering specialists (AFS 3E5X1) are sometimes added to the staff to assist 
Prime BEEF supervisors in directing and controlling overall recovery operations in the 
CE UCC. The UCC staff may also include civilian personnel in a natural disaster 
response. If available during wartime, civilian personnel may also be used; however, 
workaround plans should exist that take into account the possibility these civilian 
employees may not be available. 
2.2.2.  Facilities.  It may be advantageous to setup the CE UCC facility within walking 
distance of the CE shops. This makes communications easier if phones or radios are limited 
or not available. In addition, a backup power source should be provided to support operations 
during power outages. In case the primary facility is lost, an alternate or backup UCC facility 
should be ready for immediate occupancy. For wartime threats and disaster precautions, units 
should strive to establish their alternate UCC at a site that is unlikely to be included in the 
same hazard cordon affecting the primary location. Regardless where UCC facilities are 
located, the configuration, layout, equipment, and supplies are usually prearranged according 
to base and unit plans. 
2.2.3.  Communications.  The UCC is essential for passing information up, down and across 
the chain of command in response to changing installation recovery situations or strategy. To 
be efficient, UCC communications should be reliable, simple, clear-cut, and understood by 
everyone involved. The CE UCC uses various methods to communicate recalls and process 
vital information, including land-line phones, cell phones, radios, pagers, facsimiles, 
computers, runners, and other means. Operations managers should perform operational 
checks (preferably monthly) on primary and alternate communications devices in the UCC. 
These operational checks must include verification of key contact numbers for both landline 
and cellular devices. Also, verify computer software is current and able to access the base 
network. The following paragraphs highlight basic practices for maintaining effective 
operational communications. 
2.2.3.1.  Operations and Communications Security. Personnel should always practice 
good operations security (OPSEC) and communications security (COMSEC) procedures, 
especially when classified or sensitive C2 information and resources are involved. Make 
sure to protect sensitive information using SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network 
(SIPRNet) and other specified security/encryption measures when required. Shred 
discarded paperwork, establish, and use designated call signs, duress codes, 
authentication codes, and passwords as necessary. 
2.2.3.2.  Telephones. Operations managers should specify which telephone connections 
are available in the UCC and list phone numbers for the various positions. Also, identify 
cellular phone numbers and assignment. When landline or hard-wired telephones must be 
used to relay classified information, use secure telephone equipment (STE) devices. 
When available, STE devices provide secure multimedia communications: digital 
telephone, secure voice, transfer of secure fax and data files, and other capabilities. The 
lead operations manager should consult with the unit security manager on clearance 
requirements for assigned operations management personnel. 
2.2.3.3.  Radio Assets. Maintain strict control over assigned tactical radios and/or land 
mobile radio (LMR) assets. Operations managers in the CE UCC should only be required 
to operate and manage communication devices under their direct control. FES, EOD, and 
  14  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
R&EM Flights typically manage their own systems and assets. Inventory, recall, and 
assign handheld radios to response teams as necessary. Radio assets should be kept fully 
serviceable and ready for immediate use; pay close attention to recharging batteries. 
Several dead batteries causing partial loss of communications when performing recovery 
actions can severely reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of repair and damage 
assessment crews. This immediately affects the speed at which the installation’s mission 
capabilities are reestablished. Quickly replacing lost or damaged radios during 
contingencies or wartime is virtually impossible. Some basic steps to managing radios are 
listed in Table 2.1. 
Table 2.1.  Managing Radios 
Basic Steps for Managing Radios 
Maintain an accurate inventory of assigned radio assets 
 
Assign radios to CE response teams using an AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue 
Receipt, or other approved method; electronic receipts are commonly 
authorized 
 
Recall assigned radios for redistribution according to operational 
requirements 
 
Setup and operate the UCC base station 
 
Keep radio batteries/spare batteries charged 
 
Collect and redistribute radios for normal use after the emergency has ended 
 
2.2.3.4.  Radio Discipline. The key to effective radio communications is to ensure all 
personnel use proper radio discipline, designated call signs, good enunciation, and brevity 
when communicating. Avoid clogging the networks with unnecessary chatter so 
transmissions can be devoted to communicating and coordinating mission critical 
activities. Refer to AFPAM 10-219, Volume 2, Civil Engineer Disaster and Attack 
Preparations, for more information on setting up emergency communications. 
2.2.3.5.  Radio “Dead Zones.” Ensure CE personnel using radios know the location of 
radio dead zones (if applicable) and understand how to minimize their effects. The 
installation communications officer and intrabase radio personnel can assist in identifying 
dead zones. Once identified, it is a good idea to annotate the information on the UCC’s 
installation layout map. Make it a practice to advise all new or infrequent radio users of 
these locations and ways to minimize their effects. To minimize the effects of radio “dead 
zones” or areas of high interference, use message-relaying techniques, change location, or 
move closer to the UCC. 
2.2.3.6.  Alternative Communications. During emergencies, viable alternatives to landline 
phones and radio communications should be available. Cell phones, computers, fax 
machines, mobile data devices, and runners may be good alternatives. However, it may 
be impractical to use runners if great distances are involved. When using cell phones or 
other non-secure communication methods, users should always be cognizant of 
COMSEC and OPSEC requirements. 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015

2.3.  UCC Operation and Management.  Once activated, the CE UCC collects and reports 
damage inputs, directs recovery activities, and operates the CE communications network to 
coordinate around-the-clock recovery operations as directed by the BCE/CE unit commander and 
EOC. Additionally, as the CE communications pipeline, the UCC disseminates threat and 
emergency action information, incident cordon and evacuation instructions, protective measures, 
and other emergency information to all organizational elements. The following paragraphs 
address some specific CE UCC contingency response and recovery activities. 
2.3.1.  Maintain Essential Data and Documentation.  The CE UCC should have on hand 
all essential data and documents to support recovery operations. Control center managers and 
supervisors should review and maintain current copies of contingency plans and checklists 
applicable to the crisis, maintain an events log, and establish or maintain other essential data 
and documentation as necessary. 
2.3.1.1.  Contingency Plans and Checklists. Operations managers should have available 
and review (preferably semiannually) copies of applicable unit checklists, operations 
plans, support plans, and base plans that CE supports (Table 2.2). Ensure the plans are 
complete and current so the CE UCC is operating on the same information as the other 
operations and communications centers (e.g., EOC, Base Defense Operations Center 
[BDOC], Emergency Communications Center [ECC]). Unit checklists are important tools 
for effective consequence management and should be comprehensive and current. These 
checklists provide CE personnel the means to respond quickly to a variety of events with 
little or no delay.

2.3.1.2.  Log of Events and Support Activities. Establish and maintain a permanent log of 
events and unit support activities using methods prescribed by the owning MAJCOM or 
  16  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
unit, whichever is applicable. Either electronic/computer-generated logs or manual forms 
are usually permitted. Regardless of the means used, event logs typically have 
information fields similar to those shown in Figure 2.1. Maintaining an accurate log of 
events will not only improve continuity and information flow between shifts; it is also the 
basic information reference for after-action reporting. Regularly provide event logs to the 
alternate UCC (preferably no less than each shift change) for continuity in case the 
primary UCC becomes unavailable. When filled out, these logs are an official record of 
unit events and should be maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363. 
Figure 2.1.  Example Log of Events 
 
2.3.1.2.1.  Include in the log all significant events and notifications along with other 
incident or contingency support activities. Be sure to note changes relating to unit 
posture and preparedness; response/repair team capabilities; mitigation activities; 
receipt of critical correspondence or information; significant facility, equipment, 
communications, vehicle, and personnel changes; and other events required by 
installation or unit plans and instructions. 
2.3.1.2.2.  In addition to the log of events, maintain any data or documents that may 
be pertinent to the unit’s response and recovery activities (e.g., correspondence, work 
orders, receipts, and photographs). These items may be an important part of the 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  17  
record of events, especially if documenting damage or when contracting for 
equipment, supplies, or repair work. 
2.3.1.3.  Status Charts. Easily viewable status charts and boards are usually posted when 
certain information requires close monitoring by the UCC staff. Consider displaying the 
status of personnel, prepositioned equipment and materials, key facilities and shelters, 
vehicles, response and repair teams, damage assessment and repair, and/or other critical 
information (Table 2.3). The exact style and configuration of status charts or boards will 
likely vary between units and bases due to specific mission requirements. See AFPAM 
10-219, Volume 2, for sample charts.

2.3.1.4.  Installation Maps and Drawings. Appropriate maps (e.g., base grid maps, airfield 
maps, GeoBase maps, and overlays) of the installation are necessary in the CE UCC for 
coordinating and plotting response activities, infrastructure damage, and the location of 
known hazards. Maps should depict information such as that shown in Table 2.4 and any 
other required or relevant data. GeoBase maps and overlays are critical to establishing 
and maintaining situational awareness and the Common Installation Picture (CIP) or 
Common Operational Picture (COP). As a backup, maintain hardcopies of all relevant 
drawings, base maps, and airfield maps. Operations managers should ensure maps are 
reviewed appropriate Superintendents and shop NCOICs (preferably monthly) and 
updated by GeoBase or other CIP/COP stewards when required.

2.3.2.  Gather and Disseminate Information.  During a crisis, collecting and disseminating 
vital information for unit personnel, response teams and the EOC is a key function of the CE 
UCC. It helps facilitate the common operational picture and enhances contingency response 
and recovery operations. Even though the UCC is the CE communications conduit, all CE 
personnel have an essential role in information collection and dissemination. The ability to 
communicate important information quickly and efficiently is vital to successful installation 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  19  
recovery. Information the CE UCC collects and reports up, down, or laterally across the 
chain of command may include personnel status and accounting; threat and protective 
measures; unit alert condition and emergency notifications; incident cordon and evacuation 
instructions; damage, casualties, and mission capability reports; response and recovery 
direction; mitigation efforts, activities and status; availability of specialized skills; required 
equipment/resources, and other emergency action and crisis response information. 
2.3.3.  Personnel Accountability.  A fundamental task of all UCCs is accounting for 
assigned personnel. In the aftermath of a major disaster or an attack, it is doubtful the full 
complement of CE personnel will be available to respond. Individuals may be on leave, 
temporary duty (TDY), a casualty of the incident, or otherwise unable to respond or reach the 
installation. The recovery effort cannot wait until these personnel return or are backfilled; it 
will have to proceed with available manpower. For this reason, an accurate accounting of 
personnel present for duty is essential so CE management can make assignments to vital 
installation recovery functions. Personnel accountability procedures will vary from 
installation to installation. Therefore, adherence to locally established procedures is 
important to provide an accurate count of personnel to those responsible for making 
installation recovery decisions. The following paragraphs address typical methods used for 
personnel accounting. They include personnel recall, strength reporting, personnel rosters, 
including team/billeting assignments. For additional information on personnel accounting 
and reporting responsibilities during a crisis, refer to AFI 36-3803, Personnel Accountability 
in Conjunction with Natural Disasters or National Emergencies. 
2.3.3.1.  Personnel Recall. An accurate unit recall roster with concise reporting 
instructions is essential for contacting and accounting for personnel during emergencies. 
Units should also maintain a communications-out (comm-out) recall rosters in case local 
communications become overloaded or inoperative. Notwithstanding how personnel are 
notified, reporting instructions should always be clear and thorough, including who 
reports where, when, to whom, and with what equipment. See the CE CRP for specific 
information on unit personnel recall methods and procedures. Note: The sign-in 
procedures may be accomplished in a number of ways such as sign-in sheets for each 
AFS or a vertical plotting board with sections for the various AFSs. 
2.3.3.2.  Personnel Strength Reporting. When designated by disaster plans or recall 
checklists, personnel strengths are reported from assembly locations to the UCC. The 
UCC compiles the information and compares it to the Alpha Roster, verifies information 
as necessary through the unit orderly room, and forwards the required data to the EOC. 
Some UCCs prefer to track/monitor this information using an easily viewable chart 
within the UCC (see Table 2.5).

2.3.3.3.  Key Personnel Rosters and Team Assignment. Personnel accounting also 
includes identifying people that fill key positions related to CE response and recovery 
activities. Personnel rosters with contact information (phone, billeting, etc.) enable rapid 
notification, response and improved unit coordination. Operations managers should 
provide a roster of key CE personnel to the EOC. Likewise, keep a roster of key EOC 
personnel inside the CE UCC. When CE response teams and crews are organized, 
establish team rosters to help expedite, track and manage team response and repair 
activities. Operations managers should regularly (preferably monthly) review and update 
Key Personnel Rosters and team assignments. See AFPAM 10-219, Volume 2 for 
examples of personnel and team rosters. 
2.3.4.  Direct, Coordinate, and Monitor.  With BCE/CE unit commander direction, 
supervisors, and operations managers within the CE UCC coordinate, monitor, and direct 
unit resources to respond quickly and appropriately to a myriad of emergencies and tasks. 
The UCC staff should work closely with other internal elements such as EM, EOD, FES, and 
the ECC to avoid potential conflicts in tasking and activities. Once activated, the CE UCC 
may direct, coordinate, or monitor a number of activities including, fire fighting; UXO 
clearance; contamination control operations; damage assessments; repair of airfields, roads, 
facilities, and utilities; shelter management; moving unit personnel and equipment; dispersal, 
prepositioning and staging operations; spill response operations; base denial operations, and 
other response, mitigation and recovery activities. 
2.3.5.  Team Dispatch and Control.  Damage and destruction is an unfortunate byproduct of 
major accidents, natural disasters, and enemy attacks; consequently, when these situations 
occur, CE teams are dispatched to help mitigate the circumstances. CE response teams are 
usually organized based on the specific mission needs and threat condition. Besides first and 
emergency responders, CE response teams perform a number of tasks including, PAR, 
damage assessment, hazard and spill response, contamination control, ADR, engineering, 
MAAS and EALS installation, facility, and utility repair, and other emergency recovery 
activities. Once activated; and with EOC direction, the CE UCC staff dispatches emergency 
engineer teams when situations warrant their specialized skills and equipment. Engineer 
officers, superintendents, and operations managers in the CE UCC direct the repair efforts of 
the teams and provide functional expertise where needed. The staff also tracks progress and 
status of engineer teams so accurate information is relayed to the BCE, EOC, and/or IC, as 
appropriate. 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  21  
2.3.6.  Continuity of Operations (COOP) and Mission Support.  Helping to ensure COOP 
and mission support requirements during emergencies is a vital CE function. In addition to 
performing primary functions such as FES, EOD, and EM; repairing airfields, roads, and 
facilities; maintaining alternate command centers (e.g., alternate EOC, mobile 
communications vehicle and alternate CE UCC), CE forces also perform other actions that 
help ensure COOP and mission support during a crisis. Some of these actions are highlighted 
in the following paragraphs, including pre-designating alternate engineer leadership for EOC 
and UCCs; conducting thorough change-over briefings during shift changes; dispersing and 
recalling personnel and equipment, and prepositioning or staging assets for rapid response. 
While certain activities are performed during the planning and preparation phase before an 
emergency, others may need to be accomplished after the onset of the emergency or incident. 
2.3.6.1.  Pre-designated Personnel. Provision should be made for the continuity of 
engineer leadership in both the EOC and the UCC. Although, the establishment of 
alternate command centers aids in solving part of the problem, the possibility exists that 
key personnel assigned to serve in either the primary or alternate command centers may 
become casualties or unable to perform their primary duties. Other engineer personnel 
should be pre-designated to fill in for these key individuals. This pre-designation should 
be done in advance of any hostilities, and sufficient training and C2 familiarization 
should be provided so that a smooth transition can occur, if required. 
2.3.6.2.  Change-Over Briefings. Because of “round-the-clock” operations, the quality of 
shift changeover briefings can influence COOP and mission support. In effect, continuity 
is affected every time there is a shift change. The amount of professionalism and effort 
put into changeover briefings is directly proportional to the degree of operational and 
mission continuity maintained. These briefings should be in sufficient depth and scope to 
make individuals on the next shift conversant on all major recovery activities underway 
and those programmed to start during the shift. Fancy eyewash slides are not necessary 
nor worth the time to produce; however, just passing the logbook will not cut it either. 
Brief oncoming shift personnel as you would wish to be briefed. 
2.3.6.3.  Disperse and Recall Equipment/Personnel. Equipment and personnel are 
dispersed to protect them from damage or destruction so they are available for restoring 
operations after the crisis. Usually, when the disaster or attack is imminent, commanders 
will review dispersal plans and determine how they apply to the current situation. One of 
the most crucial factors in conducting an effective dispersal operation is time. The greater 
the warning before an emergency, the more attractive dispersal becomes as a resource 
protection option. Therefore, installation leadership will evaluate carefully all warnings 
regarding potential disasters or enemy actions and whenever possible, make early 
decisions regarding the feasibility of dispersal. The decision as to whether assets should 
be dispersed depends upon the perceived impact of the threat and estimates regarding the 
time available for dispersal. A prudent and judicious process of weighing one risk against 
the other is necessary to determine if the benefits of dispersal outweigh the costs. For 
example, dispersing resources may increase protection, but the manpower required to 
transport those assets may seriously undermine personnel strengths. To illustrate further, 
dispersing personnel and equipment to high ground across a river may protect these 
assets from the effects of a flood; but if the flood washes out the connecting bridge, these 
assets may not be immediately available to support the recovery effort. If commanders 
  22  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
anticipates regrouping at another location following the emergency, this could be a strong 
motivating factor for dispersing some of those assets during the pre-disaster or attack 
phase. The best dispersal plan is only effective if it is tempered by the conditions existing 
at the time of an emergency. If dispersal is necessary, the following actions should be 
taken: 
2.3.6.3.1.  Assemble and organize dispersal forces and provide them with a 
comprehensive briefing of actions to be taken. Any changes to preplanned dispersal 
activities should be emphasized. Especially important are changes in dispersal 
locations, dispersal assets, and dispersal methods. If dispersing off-base, be sure 
personnel have current maps with alternate routes back to the base marked in case 
primary routes are blocked. 
2.3.6.3.2.  Organize dispersal assets and arrange the necessary transportation. This 
step includes all activities necessary for mobilization of dispersal assets; loading 
trucks with equipment and materials; fueling equipment that will be driven to the 
dispersal location; organizing convoys for land movements to dispersal sites off base, 
arranging airlift support for long-range dispersal; and changing dispersal routes as 
needed to reflect the current situation. 
2.3.6.3.3.  Move resources to dispersal sites. Transport assembled assets to the 
dispersal location as expeditiously as possible. This is especially important to ensure 
that valuable resources are not exposed, or concentrated in a single location, when the 
catastrophe strikes. 
2.3.6.3.4.  Establish and maintain communications with appropriate command center. 
Dispersed forces must maintain contact with the command center. The command 
center must be advised of any factors that affect the capability of the dispersed forces 
to accomplish their post-disaster or post-attack mission. Remember to provide mobile 
generator support to dispersal sites for powering base station radios, battery chargers, 
and lighting. Also, include a means of refueling the generators nothing elaborate; 
portable fuel containers should be sufficient. 
2.3.6.3.5.  Protect dispersed assets. It is vital that dispersed resources be secured and 
protected from the effects of a disaster or enemy actions. Otherwise, the purpose of 
the original dispersal will be defeated and the force could be ineffective in responding 
when recalled. Depending upon the type of emergency, protective measures could 
range from boarding up windows and sandbagging to construction of standoff 
revetments. Plan accordingly; if time will not permit accomplishment of protective 
measures once arriving at a dispersal location, complete the hardening tasks as one of 
your preparation actions for disasters or attacks. 
2.3.6.3.6.  Recall dispersed equipment and personnel. Commanders assess the 
possibility of a threat recurrence before recalling dispersed assets for recovery 
actions. He or she may decide to recall only those assets needed for sustained 
operation of critical functions. 
2.3.6.4.  Prepositioning Assets. Maintaining COOP after a disaster or attack relies heavily 
on the availability of assets that support installation response and recovery operations. 
When there is adequate time to anticipate actions for emergency operations, unit 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  23  
leadership considers prepositioning needed assets (e.g., supplies, equipment, vehicles, 
and support materials) in primary/alternate locations for immediate use in emergencies. 
These assets provide the CE force with a rapid response capability during consequence 
management and are needed to protect or sustain personnel, repair damaged 
infrastructure, and restore operations. Assets may also be prepositioned to support 
commander-directed base denial operations. The type of prepositioned assets can 
sometimes affect where they are located. The following paragraphs highlight some 
examples of prepositioned assets. 
2.3.6.4.1.  Shelter Assets and Supplies. Whether planned for assigned personnel or an 
incoming augmenting force, eventually shelter assets and supplies will be 
prepositioned inside shelter areas. Items could include water, food, bedding, first aid 
supplies, and hygiene kits for potential occupants. Although water and power for 
shelters may be readily available through the normal infrastructure, if those utilities 
are damaged during the event, then bottled water and generator power may be 
needed. Both of these items should be prepositioned before the need arises. Also, 
consider having storage containers (e.g., lockers, cabinets, shelving) in the shelters for 
occupants’ clothing and personal gear. 
2.3.6.4.2.  ADR Assets. ADR equipment and materials are sometimes prepositioned 
at main operating bases to increase the crater repair capability at that location. These 
ADR assets are typically located at theater installations vulnerable to attack but may 
be staged at less vulnerable bases for potential deployment to other sites, if needed. 
Prepositioned ADR assets should be dispersed around the installation to help ensure 
availability after an attack (Figure 2.2). The number of dispersed locations selected 
depends on the quantity of ADR assets and resources, airfield location/orientation, 
enemy threat to the airfield, and the anticipated repairs. 
Figure 2.2.  ADR Equipment Convoying from Dispersed Location to Crater Repair Sites 
 
2.3.6.4.3.  CBRN Warning and Detection Assets. CBRN warning and detection assets 
provide units with the ability to detect and protect against a number of CBRN agents. 
When CBRN threats are present, prepositioning available detectors and alarms in key 
locations around an installation, (threat detection grid) may permit accurate and early 
  24  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
detection of CBRN agents and provide commanders more time to implement 
protective measures. Commanders may also employ warning and detection assets in 
the aftermath of an attack involving CBRN materials to relay or determine the 
location of contaminated or uncontaminated areas. Review AFMAN 10-2503 for 
additional information on CBRN warning and reporting, and detection assets. 
2.3.6.4.4.  Class IV Construction Materials. Construction materials and supplies for 
recovery operations may be prepositioned at installations or locations either as 
minimum stock levels or as separately stored stockpiled items. Adequate security and 
protection of these materials is essential to ensure they are available when needed. 
This is especially true for materials placed in open storage or dispersed locations. See 
Chapter 7 for more information on storing and stockpiling recovery materials. 
2.3.6.5.  Staging Assets. Generally, staging is the process of assembling, holding, and 
organizing arriving personnel, equipment, and sustaining materiel in preparation for 
onward movement. Understandably, the size and scope of staging operations vary and 
will likely be governed by a number of wide-ranging factors. Staging large forces and 
equipment for war or response to major disasters is different from staging CE resources 
for a much smaller, installation or unit emergency response. Furthermore, plans for 
staging assets may be developed well in advance of a potential crisis or accomplished 
immediately prior to or after an incident occurs. Regardless, when and how staging is 
planned or accomplished, engineers are usually heavily involved in the endeavor. 
2.3.6.5.1.  For major operations, expect the staging process to require a significant 
amount of preplanning, coordination, and effort, especially if large areas are needed 
to support huge groups of people and materiel. Large-scale staging operations usually 
involve all units on an installation and can include activities such as marshaling and 
lay-down areas, Security Forces (SF), personnel and equipment reception/staging 
areas and facilities, personnel support, billeting, transportation, material handling 
equipment, maintenance, general supply and subsistence support, contracting support, 
communications support, and medical services. 
2.3.6.5.2.  In contrast to large-scale staging operations, unit commanders can stage 
CE teams and resources in response to a heightened potential for attack or for an 
actual event on or near the installation. Furthermore, commanders may consider 
staging CE assets at dispersed or protected locations before a disaster strikes or an 
attack to increase their survivability and readiness during recovery operations. In any 
case, staging assets can enhance recovery capabilities and help ensure COOP after a 
crisis. 
2.3.6.5.3.  In emergencies, sometimes hastily developed staging areas are used to 
accommodate responding forces during the initial incident response phase. These 
staging areas should be checked for potential hazards prior to or immediately after the 
arrival of initial response forces to help ensure the staging area and entry control 
points are free of hazards. CE forces, including FES, EOD, and EM play a significant 
role in establishing hazard- and contamination-free staging areas. Refer to AFMAN 
10-2502, Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) Standards and 
Procedures, and your installation’s IEMP 10-2 and CE CRP for specific staging 
guidance.

Chapter 3 
DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS 
3.1.  General Information.  Performing damage assessments is the first step toward restoring 
critical installation facilities, utilities, and infrastructure to service after an attack or disaster. 
Specialized damage assessment response teams (DART) and airfield damage assessment teams 
(ADAT) perform assessments. DARTs help determine the location, type, and extent of damage 
to most installation facilities and utilities (Figure 3.1), and have a responsibility to isolate 
damaged utility systems whenever it is possible and practical to do so. During wartime, DARTs 
report the location, type, and quantity of UXOs discovered following an attack. They also make a 
quick inspection of ADR equipment and stockpiles; reporting the results of their findings to the 
ADR Officer-In-Charge (OIC). DART damage assessment reports are forwarded to the CE UCC 
where they are analyzed and prioritized IAW the installation recovery strategy developed by the 
EOC. Similar to DARTs, ADATs check and report the condition of the installation’s airfield 
(i.e., runways, taxiways, ramps, and supporting infrastructure). Since the condition of the airfield 
has a fundamental and immediate impact on the flying mission, ADATs report their findings 
directly to the EOC (not CE UCC), to ensure senior leaders and those responsible for Minimum 
Operating Strip (MOS) selection have instant visibility on airfield condition. Whether DARTs or 
ADATs; speed and accuracy is essential during damage assessments to help ensure timely base 
recovery and restoration of installation operations; including flying operations. 
Figure 3.1.  DARTs Assess Damage to Installation Facilities and Utilities 
 
3.2.  Overview.  This chapter addresses general damage assessment methods and processes; 
DART organization, leadership, and equipment requirements; and damage assessment recording 
and reporting. Airfield damage assessments and ADATs receive only cursory mention in this 
chapter, and readers should refer to AFPAM 10-219, Volume 4, for specific ADAT and airfield 
damage assessment information. 
3.3.  Assessment Methods.  In the aftermath of a peacetime disaster, major accident, wartime 
and terrorist attack, or other crisis incident, the approach or method of damage assessment is 
vital to meeting the goals of the recovery effort. For example, wartime damage assessments are 
usually conducted and analyzed with an eye on prioritizing expedient repairs of critical facilities 
  26  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
to restore installation operations quickly. Also during periods of war, repair times may be 
considered more critical than repair costs, and non-mission critical facilities will likely be 
completely bypassed during the repair/restoration process. Conversely, when conducting 
peacetime damage assessments, the focus may be on developing priorities and determining costs 
of permanent repairs to all facilities damaged during the disaster or accident. Both types of 
assessments are addressed throughout this chapter. 
3.3.1.  Installations with active flying operations differentiate airfield damage assessments 
from facility/infrastructure damage assessments. Airfield damage assessments involve a rapid 
appraisal of the airfield for damage, including checks of runway surfaces, taxiway surfaces, 
and other facilities that directly support aircraft operations. On the other hand, facility and 
infrastructure damage assessments evaluate damage to all other installation infrastructure, 
including facilities and utilities. Resources permitting, both assessments should be conducted 
simultaneously and depending on the situation, may be of equal importance. 
3.3.2.  Damage assessment methods are usually categorized as Preliminary (Phase I) and 
Detailed (Phase II) assessments. For preliminary assessments, an initial evaluation of the 
installation is made to quickly locate areas of UXO and major facility and utility damage. 
The results of this preliminary survey are used to obtain a general idea of overall installation 
damage and update the preplanned damage assessment routes. A detailed damage assessment 
requires a more accurate location and description of problems than the preliminary or rapid 
assessment since these reports will form the basis of repair crew sizing, material and vehicle 
allocation, damage repair cost estimates, and, to some degree, prioritization of efforts. During 
detailed assessments, DARTs follow UCC-directed travel routes from their shelter locations 
to various critical facilities and utilities throughout the installation. The DART reports the 
severity of damage along these routes and, in particular, at the predetermined critical 
facilities. DARTs also note and report all hazards; such as, dangerous breaks in gas, 
electrical, water and sewer lines; road perils; UXOs; etc. All affected areas should be 
recorded on a base map maintained in the CE UCC. See paragraph 3.5 for a closer look at 
preliminary and detailed damage assessment practices, priorities and reporting procedures. 
3.3.3.  In addition to the damage assessment procedures addressed in this section, UFC 1-
201-02, Assessment of Existing Facilities for Use In Military Operations, is a good source of 
information for performing preliminary and detailed facility assessments. It provides 
contingency personnel with procedures to assess facilities to determine if buildings meet the 
minimum life safety and habitability requirements to permit occupancy in support of military 
operations. It also provides options for mitigating risks when deficiencies exists. 
3.4.  DART Organization, Leadership, and Equipment.  The number of DARTs established 
depends, for the most part, on the size of the installation to be surveyed. Three teams should be 
sufficient for an average size installation. While manpower assets from Prime BEEF teams 
configured in a warfighting force posture can support a three-team requirement, the number of 
teams required for damage assessment should be based upon factors such as: 
 Facility type/size 
 Type/size of utility systems 
 Number of facilities 
 Geographical separation of facilities 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  27  
3.4.1.  Organization.  Reflected in Table 3.1 is an example of basic DART composition. Do 
not hesitate to tailor the skill mix and number to the installation’s facility and utility situation. 
For example, if the installation has a large petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL) complex and 
tank farm, consider adding or substituting a Water and Fuels System Maintenance (WFSM) 
person for another craftsman on one of the teams. If a civilian work force is available, use to 
fill needed positions on teams or to field additional teams. For safety reasons, DARTs should 
never have less than two qualified individuals at all times. See AFPAM 10-219, Volume 1 
for more information on the composition of DARTs and other CE response teams.

3.4.2.  Leadership.  The senior military member or civilian assigned to the DART is 
responsible for organizing and directing the team’s assessment operation. Ideally, individuals 
chosen to head DARTs should be knowledgeable of the type damage to be assessed (e.g., 
electrical, mechanical, and structural). Team leaders ensure DARTs: 
3.4.2.1.  Maintain communication with the UCC. 
3.4.2.2.  Survey incident/accident sites and compile preliminary and detailed damage 
assessment survey data. When incidents involve multiple locations/facilities, establish 
survey sequence using the installation’s facility priority list. 
3.4.2.3.  Report immediately to the UCC all situations posing an immediate threat to 
public safety (e.g., downed power lines, gas leaks, collapsing structures, fires). 
3.4.2.4.  Survey assigned areas, record damage on damage assessment worksheet(s) and 
transmit survey data information to the UCC. 
3.4.2.5.  Complete initial isolation or shutdown of utilities to prevent further damage or 
injury if within the capabilities of the DART. 
3.4.2.6.  Return to the UCC when directed and provide detailed damage assessment data. 
Also, maintain all worksheets/photos for the detailed damage assessment and for 
historical purposes. 
3.4.2.7.  Request any non-CE support through the UCC. 
3.4.3.  Equipment.  Equipment for DART support should be assembled during the attack 
preparedness phase. The specific types and quantities of support equipment depend on 
installation requirements and how the assessment will be conducted. Dedicated vehicle 
support for assessment team operations is virtually mandatory; however, the possibility exists 
that assessment may have to be accomplished on foot if many vehicles are destroyed or roads 
are seriously blocked. In such cases, teams will be severely limited in what they can perform 
in the way of utility isolation, and their assessment time will be greatly lengthened. Although 
  28  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
not all-inclusive or mandatory, Table 3.2 lists typical equipment and supplies for personnel 
performing DART tasks. Note: Items in this list do not constitute new purchase 
requirements. Consult with unit POCs for specific DART requirements, funding and logistics 
authority. 
Table 3.2.  Typical DART Equipment and Supplies 
DART Support Equipment 
Personal protective equipment (PPE) and/or individual protective equipment (IPE): (e.g., 
hard hats, gloves, safety glasses, rubber boots (flooded areas), reflective vests, chemical 
warfare ensemble, helmet, body armor) 
Data recording/reporting equipment (mobile device/computer w/GIS data loaded, small 
digital camera, if provided), priority facility list, base map/installation grid maps, utility 
drawings, damage assessment worksheets/forms, clipboards, writing implements, radios 
w/spare batteries 
Binoculars and night vision devices 
Utilities isolation tools and gear such as electrical hot sticks, fuse pullers, and valve keys 
Global positioning system equipment/directional compass 
Miscellaneous equipment such as explosion-proof, plastic-cased flashlights, hand tools, 
nonmetallic measuring tapes, surveyors tape (multiple colors), flags, UXO markers, utility 
shutoff markers, and first aid kit 
3.5.  Assessment Practices, Priorities and Reporting.  DARTs begin attack or disaster 
recovery assessments when directed by the commander (usually through the EOC or UCC after 
declaration of “Alarm Black” condition or “All Clear”). Upon notification, DART members 
should report to their designated assembly area or an alternate location as directed by the UCC. 
Conduct preliminary and detailed damage assessments as indicated below. For additional, 
comprehensive facility assessment procedures and checklists, see UFC 1-201-02. 
3.5.1.  Preliminary Assessment (Phase I).  The purpose of the preliminary damage 
assessment is to assess the recovery environment quickly and identify areas of major utility 
and facility disruption. The preliminary assessment should also identify any readily apparent 
life safety hazards. Note: If possible, preliminary damage assessments during peacetime 
should be completed within the first few hours of daylight that it is safe to have personnel out 
following the disaster. 
3.5.1.1.  When making preliminary reports, exact damage descriptions and measurements 
are not expected, so information should be of a general nature (e.g., roof damage, broken 
windows). Preselected observation posts can provide information on visible facility and 
utility damages using expedient modes of communication (e.g., radio/telephone contact 
with UCCs and the EOC). The preliminary damage assessment will set the pace for the 
recovery effort. During preliminary assessments, DARTs should: 
3.5.1.1.1.  Perform a rapid and safe base assessment 
3.5.1.1.2.  Identify damage by building category and general description 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  29  
3.5.1.1.3.  Use locally approved DART worksheets to document assessments (See 
Attachment 3 for examples of preliminary damage assessment worksheets) 
3.5.1.1.4.  Report limiting factors for emergency response vehicles (e.g., blocked 
road, bridge) 
3.5.1.1.5.  Provide inputs to the UCC 
3.5.1.2.  In addition to DART preliminary reporting, the CE UCC should expect 
installation-wide reports and inputs from personnel who are not trained or familiar with 
damage assessment reporting requirements. Much of the information received will be 
inaccurate; therefore, UCC personnel will have to be prepared to ask the right questions 
and clarify any contradictory inputs. Expect to receive damage inputs from all types of 
communications modes—runners, the installation telephone system, other C2 centers, 
and the EOC. 
3.5.1.3.  During wartime assessments after an installation attack, the UCC should be 
prepared for plenty of confusing UXO reports. Many personnel do not have an EOR 
background or experience. Most inputs will probably be in terms of generalities, so close 
questioning will have to be done to ascertain the type of munitions that will be 
encountered. The CE UCC will use the UXO information and other data obtained during 
the Phase I initial reconnaissance to adjust DART routes as appropriate. Afterwards, 
Phase II assessments begin. 
3.5.2.  Detailed Assessment (Phase II).  Once preliminary damage assessment is complete 
and the UCC has a rough estimate of overall base damage, the next step is to perform a 
detailed assessment of damaged facilities. The Phase II damage assessment can be highly 
dangerous and perhaps time-consuming, depending upon the extent of the damage and size of 
the installation. In both attack and disaster recovery environments, DARTs serve as the eyes 
and ears of the UCC. The interface between these two functions should be close since the 
entire installation recovery effort; from a facility and utility aspect, hinges on their efficiency 
and effectiveness. The following paragraphs address both peacetime disasters and installation 
attacks, unless otherwise noted. 
3.5.2.1.  DARTs should physically inspect and record the damage to each facility using 
locally developed, pre-formatted DART worksheets. Worksheets serve as source 
documents for what the DART has observed (See Attachment 3 for examples of damage 
assessment worksheets). 
3.5.2.2.  If safety permits, DARTs should inspect accessible areas of facilities. Damage to 
built-up roofs, remote storage facilities and other locations not readily visible could go 
undetected for days unless inspection criteria are clearly defined. Comprehensive 
worksheets and checklists can help ensure DARTs inspect all required areas within the 
facility. Any damage detected should be reported in units (e.g., windows, doors), square 
footage (e.g., roofs, exterior/interior walls), or linear footage (e.g., piping, ductwork, 
fencing), as applicable. 
3.5.2.3.  To ensure required facilities are inspected by DARTs, the UCC should set goals 
and chart completion of inspections. Records from previous incidents or lessons learned 
may help provide realistic timelines and goals. Since it is important to know how well the 
detailed damage assessment process is proceeding, it may be helpful to post a chart in the 
  30  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
UCC indicating progress or status of assessments. Table 3.3 is a notional chart indicating 
daily progress or achievement. 
Table 3.3.  DART Detailed Facility Assessments Progress (Notional) 
 
3.5.2.4.  During peacetime, damage assessment goals are to develop repair priorities and 
determine the cost of repairing all facilities damaged in the disaster. While an 
installation’s immediate priority following any natural disaster will rightfully be centered 
on rescuing personnel and stabilizing facilities to protect against further damage; 
typically, the debris will have barely settled before the first requests for a damage 
estimate arrives. The sooner an installation can provide a substantiated damage estimate, 
the sooner it can expect emergency funding for disaster repairs. Data provided by DARTs 
is vital to estimating repair costs and authenticating overall damage estimates. 
3.5.2.5.  Sometimes, due to DART inexperience or lack of practice, initial damage 
assessment reports may not contain all the information needed to prepare a complete cost 
estimate. As a result, DARTs may need to return to some facilities to collect additional 
information for cost estimators. However, repair costs are not the immediate concern 
during wartime; the unit’s main objective is to restore installation operations quickly. On 
the other hand, during peacetime, a complete cost estimate after a disaster is vital to 
gaining the necessary funds to repair or replace damaged infrastructure. For this reason, 
consider having DARTs submit assessment data to cost estimators in the UCC after 
initially performing only one or two assessments. Once the information supports accurate 
repair cost estimates, set the number of facilities DARTs should assess before submitting 
them to the UCC. For example, consider having DARTs submit damage assessment data 
after completing 5 to 7 facility assessments at a time. This may help minimize lost time 
revisiting damaged facilities to collect additional information. 
3.5.2.6.  Using the data from the DART worksheets, trained estimators compute the 
dollar estimates for each facility damaged. For peacetime disasters, repair costs should 
present a realistic appraisal of the damage done by the disaster. All damage caused by the 
disaster should be included, but the cost should not include any problems caused by age, 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  31  
change of use, or other outside factors. Repair costs are provided to the MAJCOM and 
HQ USAF and should be complete, accurate, timely, and justifiable. 
3.5.3.  Typical DART Attack Recovery Actions.  Damage assessments performed after an 
installation attack have a different focus than peacetime, they can also be more challenging 
due to a multitude of wartime effects and threats; e.g., CBRN hazards, UXOs, major fires, 
bomb-damaged infrastructure, additional attacks, and personnel/equipment attrition. These 
types of wartime challenges must be considered when executing DART activities. The 
typical sequence of DART actions following an attack is as follows: 
3.5.3.1.  The UCC gathers initial damage reports and annotates appropriate information 
on grid maps. Based on these initial reports, UCC personnel make a preliminary analysis 
of where major utility and facility damage has been inflicted. Tentative utility cutoff 
locations are also identified. 
3.5.3.2.  The UCC updates previously developed damage assessment routes as necessary, 
and assigns routes to the appropriate DART based on the technical expertise resident on 
each team. 
3.5.3.3.  The UCC directs DARTs to assemble and proceed to the UCC. The DART 
chiefs pick up their assigned damage assessment routes and receive an overview of 
present conditions from the UCC staff to include known hazards (including CBRN 
agents), route updates, and information relative to probable utility shutoff requirements. 
3.5.3.4.  DART chiefs then brief their teams on assessment routes and known hazards or 
problems and begin their damage assessment activities. A communications check is made 
prior to leaving the UCC area. When assessment teams are dispatched, the UCC notifies 
the engineering representatives in the EOC of this action. 
3.5.3.5.  DARTs report major problems and hazards (major utility breaks, fires, UXO 
fields, etc.) as they travel their routes. These major items are also plotted on installation 
grid maps carried by assessment teams. Radio discipline is critical and should be 
maintained—report only the necessary information back to the UCC—do not report 
trivial items. Remember, several assessment teams are operating concurrently plus the 
UCC is also monitoring ADR and fire fighting operations—the information flow into the 
UCC will be staggering. There is also a possibility that DARTs will encounter casualties 
while performing their damage assessment activities. The buddy care and first aid home 
station training learned during peacetime becomes important here. To the extent 
practicable, assessment teams should assist wounded personnel and perform rescue 
actions if within the capability of their teams. If possible, casualties should be turned over 
to their units for transport to the nearest installation CCP. If this cannot be done, the UCC 
should be informed of the casualty’s location so the appropriate unit can be contacted 
through installation C2 channels. While damage assessment is the assessment team’s 
primary task, they cannot ignore giving aid to others—team chiefs are responsible for 
making all decisions with regard to keeping the balance between life-saving/rescue 
actions and damage assessment responsibilities. 
3.5.3.6.  DARTs assess each designated critical facility/utility along their routes. At those 
locations where damage is found, develop repair/demolition estimates. Transmit 
estimates back to the UCC for each critical facility/utility visited, and make hard copies 
  32  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
of estimates. Data radioed back to the UCC should contain only the most important 
information (e.g., type and extent of damage, major materials, and equipment needed, 
crew size and most critical AFSs, time for repair/demolition, and obvious safety hazards). 
The written copy covers more detail such as additional materials needed and further 
scope of damage. If a critical facility or utility has suffered little or no damage, this 
information should also be transmitted to the UCC. The UCC, in turn, should inform the 
engineering representatives in the EOC of all major damage assessment results as they 
are reported. 
3.5.3.7.  At locations where damaged utilities are found, DART members attempt to 
isolate the problem but only if it can be done safely and is within the technical expertise 
of the team. Once a utility has been isolated, it is reported to the UCC. If a serious utility 
problem cannot be isolated, it is also reported to the UCC so a specialized team can be 
assigned the task. Remember, these specialized teams are few in number and in the case 
of Power Production personnel, will spend most of their time after an attack attending 
emergency generator problems. Therefore, assessment teams should make every 
reasonable effort to handle such situations without assistance. 
3.5.3.8.  At those locations where UXOs are found, DARTs should perform the standard 
EOR function locate the munitions, identify the type, report findings back to the UCC, 
and mark the area with ropes and appropriate signs. Under no circumstances should 
assessment team members attempt to move a UXO even if it interferes with utility 
isolation or facility damage assessment. The UCC will submit the UXO findings data to 
the EOC who will, in turn arrange for EOD support. Once the munitions are reported and 
roped off, the team should continue with their assessment run. When the munitions are 
eventually cleared, the UCC will decide when the assessment team will be sent back to 
assess damage to the affected facility or utility system. 
3.5.3.9.  As each damage assessment route is completed, DARTs provide the UCC copies 
of their assessment reports and await further taskings. At this point, if follow-on attacks 
are unlikely, the UCC normally has three options to consider for employing DARTs. It 
can assign additional damage assessment actions predicated on the most recent damage 
inputs from other installation personnel, task assessment team members to coordinate on-
scene recovery efforts, or assign team members to specific repair crews for emergency 
repair activities. 
3.5.3.10.  If follow-on attacks are expected soon, DART members should report to their 
original shelters and reestablish team integrity. Assessment team vehicles are again 
dispersed and “resupplied” with any equipment, tools, or materials that may have been 
expended during earlier assessment runs. The UCC updates the damage assessment 
routes and grid maps with all known damage and danger areas so that duplicate reports 
are not received during subsequent damage assessment runs and assessment teams are 
knowledgeable of all known problem areas prior to their next assessment tasking. 
3.5.4.  Priorities.  The routes DARTs take during damage assessment cannot be haphazardly 
determined. They should be preplanned with the highest priority areas looked at first. During 
wartime, assessment routes should also be planned around CBRN sectors as much as possible 
to reduce transition points during split-MOPP operations, DARTS would then be pre-
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  33  
positioned one per sector (if viable). If not, it could greatly increase travel/response time of 
DARTs. 
3.5.4.1.  The facility priority list contained in the CE CRP should be used as a guide. In 
this way, key facilities and systems on the installation will be checked and damage that 
has been previously unreported will be found. Another tool available for facility 
prioritization is the Prioritized Asset List (PAL) if the installation has one. If a wartime 
location does not have a predetermined facility priority list, the facilities listed in Table 
3.4 can be used as a starting point when setting DART priorities and schedules. 
Table 3.4.  Prospective Priority Facilities 
Priority Facilities 
Installation C2 node and other C2 facilities directly related to 
combat flying squadrons (e.g., squadron operations building) 
Communications facilities 
POL/munitions facilities 
Fire stations 
Medical facilities 
Utility plants and distribution stations 
3.5.4.2.  Although damage assessment routes should be determined in advance, this does 
not mean they cannot be altered to meet the real-world situation. They should be updated 
from the data received from initial damage reports. For example, if debris or a UXO field 
is blocking an access route, simply change the access route. Once the routes have been 
determined and updated, they are assigned to specific damage assessment teams. 
Common sense and a bit of quick analysis are required here. Routes with known power 
outages and major electrical damages should be assigned to the assessment team 
containing an electrical systems specialist. A route with known POL problems should be 
assigned to the team containing a WFSM specialist if one has been placed on a team. The 
basic thrust is to match the specific skills contained on a particular assessment team with 
the types of damages expected to be encountered along the assessment route. 
3.5.5.  Damage Recording and Reporting.  Once damage is assessed, it should be recorded 
and immediately transmitted back to the CE UCC for plotting, repair prioritization, and 
repair team selection. The speed of reporting depends on the complete understanding of the 
information being relayed and adherence to proper radio discipline by DARTs and UCC 
personnel. Communications operators and plotters in the UCC should be personnel with 
engineering backgrounds if possible. This lessens the chance of miscommunication and saves 
time in perhaps the most demanding and hectic period of the installation recovery process. 
3.5.5.1.  Damage Assessment Reports. There is much more to damage reporting than just 
calling in the visual damage inflicted upon a facility or utility; several other factors 
should be addressed by DART members. For example, assessment teams should make a 
determination of repair feasibility. This is an initial decision on whether a facility or 
utility component can realistically be repaired. During wartime, if the damage is so great 
that repairs cannot be made quickly or without huge expenditures of manpower and 
  34  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
material, the facility or utility will normally be abandoned or demolished. The choice 
between abandoning and demolishing will usually be made based on safety. If a serious 
hazard does not exist, abandon the facility or utility component in place and attend to it 
after installation recovery has been accomplished; if the condition of the facility or utility 
poses a major hazard, demolition will likely be necessary. Remember, the safety hazard 
determination should be based on its effect on the primary installation mission. For 
example, a structurally unstable open storage shed in the back of the supply yard, while 
posing a serious hazard to anyone entering it, would have little effect on the flying 
mission; therefore, abandon it for now. On the other hand, a structurally unstable 
maintenance shop adjacent to an aircraft fuel cell maintenance area and major taxiway 
will most likely need to be torn down; therefore, a demolition estimate from the DART 
would be needed. If, however, the decision is made that a facility or utility component is 
repairable, a repair estimate should be made in terms of time, materials, personnel, and 
equipment. 
3.5.5.2.  Repair Estimates. In developing damage repair estimates, DART members 
should be aware of the following factors: 
3.5.5.2.1.  Repair times are critical during wartime. The quickest, least effort and least 
material-intensive repair should be identified. Workarounds are very acceptable if a 
facility/utility can be satisfactorily put back in service via such methods. Remember, 
the goal is to make the facility or utility usable once again, not to put a “peacetime” 
fix on it. After the threat of further attack is over, repairs that are more permanent can 
be made, if necessary. 
3.5.5.2.2.  Accuracy is important. DARTs are purposely configured with experienced 
personnel with varied expertise. This expertise should be used in determining what 
has to be done. Any safety hazards that may have to be contended with during repair 
should be emphasized and highlighted by damage assessment teams in their reports. 
3.5.5.2.3.  Familiarity with available equipment and materials is necessary. Repair 
estimates should be made considering what resources are readily available—it cannot 
be assumed that resources can be immediately obtained through supply or contracting 
channels. Besides knowing the going-in position on equipment and materials, DARTs 
should also be aware of the status of major equipment and material items. This 
information comes from the UCC staff and is vital in terms of developing solutions to 
repair problems involving workarounds and quick fixes. In a wartime situation, it is 
prudent to rely only on what materials and equipment are known to be available on 
the installation—chances are other sources of supply will not be available or not very 
responsive during those first few hours after an attack or widespread disaster. 
3.5.5.2.4.  Knowledge of AFS capabilities is required. Repair estimates should also 
include an indication of work crew size. DART members should be familiar with the 
task capabilities of the various engineering AFSs, the multi-skilling aspects of 
engineer AFSs, and the general nature of the repairs to be accomplished. Specific 
repair taskings cannot be over manned—manpower; especially in wartime situations 
is a precious resource. 
3.5.5.3.  Demolition Estimates. In those cases where repair of damaged facilities or 
utilities is not feasible and a demolition action is called for, demolition estimates are then 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  35  
required. The reason for the demolition action in the first place is to alleviate a serious 
safety hazard—this hazard must be made perfectly clear in the estimate so personnel are 
not placed in any more danger than they are already facing in doing the job. DART 
members should consider the following when preparing demolition estimates: 
3.5.5.3.1.  Safety is paramount. Demolition actions need only be carried out to the 
point where the safety hazard no longer exists—final cleanup can usually wait. Do 
not worry about what the work site looks like; installation beautification is not a 
concern during a major disaster or wartime. 
3.5.5.3.2.  Crew size and time required for the task should be realistic and reasonably 
accurate. Again, like the repair estimate, the demolition task should not be over-
manned. Use the multi-skilling features of engineer forces—many people can drive a 
dump truck. 
3.5.5.4.  Estimating Repair Costs. When determining the actual dollar estimates, it is 
important to be consistent with estimation and computation tools. Use any pre-identified 
or pre-costing formulas or tools your unit may have to estimate costs quickly and to assist 
in speedy reporting of facility damage estimates. Keep all reference data together and on 
the fewest number of forms. The UCC will consolidate completed DART worksheets and 
maintain them for future reference. 
3.5.6.  EOC Reports.  Collecting, analyzing, and reporting damage assessment information 
to the EOC is a key function of the CE UCC. The installation leadership uses damage 
assessment information when making decisions about installation recovery, mission 
operations, personnel safety, and other important issues. The UCC should up-channel DART 
preliminary damage assessment reports quickly so unit leadership and decision makers have 
a comprehensive picture of the damage done to the installation following a disaster or attack 
(Figure 3.2). In addition to the preliminary reports, the EOC and Wing leadership expects to 
receive damage assessment updates continuously in order to continue making well-informed 
decisions, assimilate base information, and to forward essential elements to joint force, 
theater, and MAJCOM command centers. For these reasons, the CE UCC must remain 
steadfast and continue to report damage assessments to the EOC expeditiously. As previously 
addressed in Chapter 2, the CE UCC uses any number of methods to communicate vital 
information to the EOC. These methods can include landline phones, cell phones, radios, 
facsimiles, computers, pagers, runners, etc. Because certain information may be sensitive, 
personnel should be cognizant of and always practice good COMSEC and OPSEC 
procedures. 
  36  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
Figure 3.2.  Quickly Up-Channel Preliminary Damage Assessments to EOC 
 
3.5.7.  Higher Headquarters (HHQ) Reports.  Certain incidents and events must be 
reported to AF HHQ. These reports are completed and forwarded by the appropriate 
installation C2 node; however, some reports require input from the CE force, especially when 
damage assessment activities are conducted. While a detailed discussion of each report is not 
necessary here, information the BCE provides for certain reports are addressed in the 
following paragraphs. More detailed information regarding HHQ reporting requirements are 
contained in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. 
3.5.7.1.  Event/Incident Report (OPREP-3). This report uses installation C2 node 
channels to notify commanders immediately of any significant event or incident that rises 
to the level of MAJCOM, HQ USAF, or DOD interests. The report is submitted in 
accordance with AFI 10-206 to the AF Operations Center in the Pentagon and other 
addressees, depending on the category of the report. Typical incidents that could trigger 
an OPREP-3 report include major fire, installation attack, major natural disaster, terrorist 
attack, and major environmental contamination. The range of information that could be 
included in the OPREP-3 is extensive. However, for those events that result in significant 
damage to USAF installations, the items in Table 3.5 should provide adequate 
information from civil engineers. The DARTs are not responsible for supplying all of the 
information listed, but familiarization with the data that the BCE may have to supply for 
this report will facilitate the collection of essential information during assessment 
activities. The UCC will provide specific instructions to the DARTs if it requires 
information beyond a team’s normal report.

information is submitted using the OPREP-3 report, follow-on status is normally 
provided in the Commander’s SITREP. Engineer data are usually included in the logistics 
portion of the report and address only major engineer problems/shortfalls. Reports 
generated at unit level are sent to the major command and the parent joint command. 
3.5.8.  In summary, damage assessments form the foundation for prompt and effective 
installation recovery actions. Engineering DARTs concentrate on airfield pavements and 
installation facilities and utilities. The DARTs initially follow predetermined routes to survey 
damage. If damage is found, repair or demolition estimates are developed and transmitted to 
the UCC. These assessment team inputs provide the baseline data needed for assembling and 
tasking engineer facility and utility repair crews. The DARTs should be comprised of 
qualified, experienced personnel; be provided adequate communications, transport, and 
protective equipment; and be completely knowledgeable of damage assessment procedures. 
To round out the damage assessment process, engineers serving in installation C2 centers 
should be aware of and participate in the preparation of the electronic reports to HHQ.

Chapter 4 
AUXILIARY FIRE FIGHTING AND SEARCH AND RESCUE 
4.1.  Overview.  Preventing fires is always the best line of defense; however, fires caused by an 
installation attack may be unavoidable. In fact, in a conventional wartime environment, it is very 
plausible that FES personnel and their vehicles/equipment could be thoroughly engaged in 
mission priority crash rescue and fire suppression tasks involving aircraft and weapons systems. 
In such demanding situations, lesser priority structural and vehicle fires could be left unattended. 
To prevent or at least reduce damage to essential CE installation recovery assets if the situation 
arises, each Prime BEEF team should have a limited, internal fire fighting capability. Thus, all 
non-fire protection (non-AFS 3E7X1) team members should be taught basic fire fighting skills to 
be able to intervene in the early stages of a fire. However, employment of these skills must not 
constitute a safety hazard to Prime BEEF team members. At installation level, the fire chief 
ensures any required contingency-related fire fighting training is provided at the proper scope 
and depth to all non-FES personnel. This chapter briefly reviews CE auxiliary fire fighting and 
search and rescue concepts and fundamentals. Personnel should consult with local FES personnel 
beforehand, when planning for potential auxiliary fire fighting. 
4.2.  Auxiliary Fire Fighting.  If the need arises and FES is fully engaged elsewhere, Prime 
BEEF team members not engaged in other, higher priority work can perform auxiliary fire 
fighting duties. Most fires can be controlled in the initial stages with immediate and proper 
application of water or other appropriate extinguishing agent. In many cases, a well-trained 
auxiliary fire fighting team, with an attack plan and an adequate amount of water should be able 
to either extinguish or contain most small fires. However, the lack of technical knowledge, 
protective clothing, and breathing apparatus will usually limit the role of auxiliary fire fighting 
teams to that of preventing the spread of an existing fire. Nevertheless, regardless of the extent of 
involvement, personnel performing auxiliary fire fighting must be aware of basic fire fighting 
concepts and fundamentals addressed in this pamphlet to function effectively and safely. They 
include understanding fire behavior, the types of fire and fire extinguishers, and basic techniques 
for controlling and/or extinguishing small fires. Success or failure may depend on their 
knowledge and ability to apply basic fire fighting methods. 
4.2.1.  Fire Behavior.  The fire tetrahedron (Figure 4.1) is the best way of explaining the 
components necessary for a fire to occur; they include fuel, oxidizing agent, heat, and a self-
sustaining chemical reaction. When placed together in the right concentrations and 
conditions, these components can produce combustion—chemical chain reactions creating 
heat and sometimes light (fire). Combustion can be slow and non-flaming (smoldering) or 
rapid and flaming (fire). Removing any one of the components illustrated in the fire 
tetrahedron will extinguish the fire. In other words, a fire can be put out by simply reducing 
the temperature of the fuel below that needed to support combustion, eliminating the source 
of fuel, withdrawing the oxidant (e.g. oxygen, chlorine gas, hydrogen peroxide), or 
interrupting the chain reaction by other methods. Examples of these methods are addressed in 
the following paragraphs. In any case, it is important to know what type of fuel is burning to 
select the correct extinguishing agent or method. 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  39  
4.2.1.1.  Heat. One of the most common methods employed to extinguish a fire is to cool 
it with water. This approach is predicated upon reducing the temperatures of the fuel until 
it does not produce enough vapors to continue burning. 
4.2.1.2.  Fuel. In some instances, it is easier to extinguish a fire by removing its source of 
fuel, which, for example, is the intent of making firebreaks when there is a forest fire. 
This approach would also apply where liquid or gaseous fuel is involved, particularly 
when it is being sourced from a pipeline. A good example of this technique took place in 
Kuwait after the 1991 Iraq war when hundreds of oil wells were ablaze. Early in the 
recovery effort, a number of the fires were quenched by simply shutting off the flow of 
crude oil. 
4.2.1.3.  Oxidant. In certain situations, it is more advisable to extinguish a fire by 
reducing the oxygen concentration. This can be done by introducing an inert gas (e.g., 
Carbon dioxide or Halon) or by separating the oxygen from the fuel. Many fire 
extinguishers work on this principle. 
4.2.1.4.  Chemical Chain Reaction. Fire resulting from a self-sustained or self-
propagating chain reaction during combustion will continue to burn until the fuel, oxygen 
is depleted, or an extinguishing agent is applied in sufficient amounts to interrupt the 
chain reaction. Fire extinguishers with dry chemical or halogenated agents are effective at 
stopping or interrupting the chemical chain reaction that produces fire. 
Figure 4.1.  Four Components of Fire Tetrahedron 
 
4.2.2.  Classes of Fires.  Fires are classified according to the type of fuel that is burning. 
Most fires will generally fall into one of five classes or types described below: 
4.2.2.1.  Class A: Ordinary Combustible Materials. These are fires involving ordinary 
materials, such as wood, paper, cloth, rubber, and many plastics. The preferred method 
for extinguishing fires involving these materials involves using water to reduce the 
temperature of the burning material (or fuel) below its ignition temperature. 
  40  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
4.2.2.2.  Class B: Flammable Liquids or Gases. These fires are often fueled by gasoline or 
diesel fuel, oil, solvents, propane or natural gas. Removing the oxygen or interrupting the 
chemical chain reaction is the most effective means of extinguishing these types of fires. 
Carbon dioxide or dry chemical fire extinguishers work well on these types of fires. 
4.2.2.3.  Class C: Energized Electrical Equipment. These are fires with energized 
electrical equipment including wiring, fuse boxes, circuit breakers, machinery, and 
appliances. Dry chemical and CO2 extinguishers usually works well on these types of 
fires. As a general practice, de-energize the circuits first before attempting to extinguish a 
fire involving electrical equipment. Afterwards, treat the remaining flame as a structural 
or flammable liquid fire, depending upon the fuel that is involved. 
4.2.2.4.  Class D: Combustible Metals. These types of fires involve burning metals, such 
as magnesium, titanium, lithium, sodium, and potassium. They present special challenges 
for any firefighter because they can react violently to moisture. Therefore, water or 
water-based fire extinguishing agents should not be used on these fires. Even small 
amounts of moisture may produce reactions that increase fire intensity. In addition, 
standard dry chemicals are not effective because the high heat generated by the burning 
metal simply consumes the agent. 
4.2.2.5.  Class K: Cooking Oils. These are fires involving animal or vegetable based 
cooking oils, fats, and greases. Larger quantities of these fuels are used in commercial 
cooking media usually located in large, industrial-size kitchens, but smaller quantities are 
also found in many private homes. Wet chemical extinguishers containing a potassium 
acetate-based extinguishing agent are used to extinguish these types of fires. 
4.2.3.  Portable Fire Extinguishers.  Portable, pressurized fire extinguishers are the first line 
of defense for small fires. They can usually be found in most base facilities and are designed 
for use on specific types of fires. The type of fire, their common extinguishing agent, and fire 
disruption method is shown in Table 4.1. Shown in Table 4.2 are common fire extinguishers 
and their designated uses. Be sure the extinguisher used is intended for the type of fire that is 
being fought. Using the wrong fire extinguisher or extinguishing method on a fire can easily 
make matters worse. See Attachment 4 for a list of pros/cons of these fire extinguishers.

4.3.  Basic Fire Fighting Concepts and Techniques.  The primary objective of auxiliary fire 
fighting is to properly deal with small fires in their early stages, including locating the fire 
source, rescuing trapped victims when possible, and extinguishing or containing the fire until 
professional help arrives. In all likelihood, auxiliary fire fighting operations will be most 
prevalent immediately following an installation attack or natural disaster. In the period between 
the all clear notification and the assignment of installation recovery taskings, engineering 
personnel should survey their immediate areas for local fires, the presence of UXO, the amount 
of damage sustained, and the status of recovery vehicles, equipment, and supplies. Those 
personnel that are not required for damage assessment, recovery asset reconnaissance, or local 
C2 should be prepared to perform auxiliary fire fighting tasks until ordered to commence more 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  43  
pressing installation recovery efforts. Review AFH 32-2005, Fire Fighting Guide for 
Contingency Operations, for additional information on auxiliary fire fighting. 
4.3.1.  Team Composition and Duties.  An auxiliary fire fighting team has no set number of 
personnel. When the need for auxiliary fire fighting arises, the ranking person should assume 
the responsibility of team chief. Team assignments will depend on the number of personnel 
available to fight the fire(s). The fire attack must be fully coordinated to be successful and 
firefighters should follow the team chief’s directions precisely—deviations could be 
counterproductive and disastrous. In any event, remember that the auxiliary fire fighting role 
is a very restricted one. With limited training and little access to professional fire fighting 
tools, the auxiliary fire fighting role should be confined to only coping with small fires in 
their earliest stages of development. Teams should avoid sacrificing their safety in dangerous 
fire fighting situations. Team duties include but are not limited to the following: 
4.3.1.1.  Deploying and operating fire extinguishers and hose lines 
4.3.1.2.  Carrying and operating other tools and equipment 
4.3.1.3.  Performing rescues 
4.3.1.4.  Assisting other team members as required 
4.3.2.  Using Fire Extinguishers.  When using portable fire extinguishers to put out a fire, 
hold it in an upright position and operate the extinguisher within its effective range. The 
“PASS” acronym is an easy way to remember how to activate and discharge extinguishers. It 
stands for: Pull the pin; Aim at the base of the fire (not the flames); Squeeze the top handle to 
release extinguishing agent; and Sweep from side to side until the fire is out. In addition to 
the efficient use of appropriate fire extinguishers, auxiliary fire fighting personnel trained to 
use fire hoses/nozzles and fire pumps can either extinguish or contain most small fires. 
However, safety is paramount and personnel should be careful not to exceed their capability 
or training. 
4.3.3.  Structural Fires.  Structural fires can be extremely dangerous and again, the need for 
safety is of utmost importance. Generally, non-FES personnel should not enter or remain in a 
burning building to fight a fire. However, if fire is discovered in the early stages of 
development and can be safely engaged, use available fire extinguishers, water hoses, or 
other appropriate extinguishing methods to put out the fire. The lack of protective clothing 
and breathing apparatus make it doubly important for auxiliary fire fighting personnel to 
adhere to safety precautions and work in pairs when performing fire fighting operations. If 
the fire cannot be safely extinguished or contained, promptly evacuate the structure. When 
fighting a structural fire, auxiliary fire fighting teams should: 
4.3.3.1.  Always be aware of the location and operation of fire extinguishers 
4.3.3.2.  Fight small fires within the limitations of extinguishers and personal training 
4.3.3.3.  Always operate using the buddy system, work in teams 
4.3.3.4.  Maintain fire escape route to your back and NEVER allow fire to get between 
you and your way out 
  44  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
4.3.3.5.  Evacuate immediately if fire goes beyond the emerging stage or is out of control 
and try to contain the fire to the building from the outside or limit the spread of fire to 
adjacent structures 
4.3.4.  When using a fire extinguisher or water hose in a direct attack on a structural fire, the 
most effective method is to direct a penetrating stream at the base of the fire. Always be 
watchful for potential hazards such as: 
4.3.4.1.  Falling debris or possible structure collapse 
4.3.4.2.  Fire moving in behind, below, or above your position 
4.3.4.3.  Kinks in or obstructions to the hoseline (if using standpipe or small hose 
systems) 
4.3.4.4.  Holes or trip hazards 
4.3.4.5.  Hazardous materials or highly flammable gases or liquids in the area 
4.3.4.6.  Electrical hazards 
4.3.5.  If the fire cannot be engaged with a direct approach inside the structure, auxiliary fire 
fighting personnel with proper training can utilize hose streams from the exterior in an 
indirect attack; such as through a window or door if possible, to help control the spread of 
fire. Be mindful of the hazards discussed above. 
4.3.6.  When attacking the fire from the exterior using the indirect approach, if the hose 
nozzle settings can be adjusted, use a range between penetrating and a moderate angle fog 
and direct the water stream at the gases at ceiling level, rather than the base of the fire. In 
addition, the water should be swept back and forth to ensure good coverage. Once the fire is 
under control, the hoseline can be advanced to extinguish any remaining hot spots with the 
direct attack approach discussed previously. 
4.3.7.  Vehicle Fires.  Generally, auxiliary fire fighting for vehicle fires would be limited to 
small trucks and passenger-type vehicles rather than large equipment such as tank trucks or 
tractor trailers. In a small vehicle fire, a fuel ignition can usually be extinguished easily by 
using a portable fire extinguisher. If a water hose is available, burning fuel leaking from the 
vehicle should be flushed clear of the area with water and then extinguished with a portable 
extinguisher or sand. If a ruptured fuel tank is burning, use a steady stream of water to put 
out the fire and keep the fuel tank cool to avoid further combustion. Once the fuel portion of 
the fire is out, the remaining flames can be handled as a structural fire. If, in addition to the 
fire, occupants are trapped inside, try to protect trapped passengers from the flames using 
water spray until they can be rescued by firefighters having the appropriate tools and 
equipment. 
4.3.8.  Fires Involving Utilities.  Utilities should only be shut off when it is necessary and 
safe to do so. For obvious safety purposes, auxiliary fire fighting teams must be able to cut 
off the utility supply (electricity and gas) to a facility. They must know the location and 
shutoff procedures for main switches and circuit breakers and safely remove fuses. They 
must also know how to locate and close gas shutoff valves using the proper tool. 
4.3.8.1.  Electrical Fires. In a structural fire, from a safety standpoint, power should 
normally remain on as long as possible to provide lighting and ventilation for fire fighting 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  45  
and rescue operations. However, when the building becomes damaged to the point that 
electrical hazards exist, the power should be immediately shut off by throwing the main 
switch or disconnecting a fuse at the main service box. Fires in electrical equipment can 
be handled with relative ease once they are de-energized. As mentioned earlier, once the 
power has been eliminated, electrical fires are usually treated in the same fashion as a 
structural fire. 
4.3.8.2.  Gas Utilities. Facilities with gas utilities should have the gas turned off as soon 
as possible. The meter and cutoff valve are usually located outside the building. The flow 
of gas into the building may be stopped by turning the cutoff valve to the closed position, 
which will be at a right angle to the pipe, as shown in Figure 4.2. Gas fires should not be 
extinguished until gas flow can be shut off. 
Figure 4.2.  Typical Gas Shutoff Valve 
 
4.3.9.  Fires at Austere Beddown Locations.  The basic principles of fire fighting used for 
modern, built-up installations also apply to austere beddown locations. However, the type of 
construction and primitive living conditions of a bare base environment make the possibility 
of fire more pronounced. Most tents burn more readily than standard construction; 
consequently, a fire is prone to spread at an alarming speed in a tent city. An adequate water 
supply could also be a problem—a bare base water system may not be sufficient to support a 
sustained fire fighting effort. By the time an alternative water source is obtained, the entire 
compound could be engulfed in flames. The best course of action (COA) in a bare base fire 
may be to stop the fire from spreading to unaffected assets. One quick way of accomplishing 
this is to drop all tentage near the tent that is on fire. Another effective COA; assuming water 
is available, is to hose down the other tents in the area. 
4.3.10.  Ground Cover Fires.  These include fires in weeds, grass, brush, and similar 
vegetation. Fighting ground cover fires can be very dangerous. Many firefighters have lost 
their lives or been seriously injured while trying to control this type of fire. As with all fire 
fighting efforts, auxiliary fire fighting teams must thoroughly consider the situation before 
engaging ground cover fires on the installation. Even in the early stages, a ground cover fire 
may burn rapidly. Three main factors affecting ground cover fires are the types of fuel, 
  46  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
weather, and terrain. Attacking a ground fire is based on perimeter control. The control line 
can be established at the edge of the fire for a direct attack or at varying distances from the 
fire to form an indirect attack. Remember, regardless of the fire fighting technique used; 
always make personnel safety a prime concern. 
4.3.10.1.  Direct Attack. The direct attack is action taken directly against the flames. If a 
water source is available, hose lines can be used in conjunction with backpack water 
extinguishers to extinguish the fire. Hand tools can also be used to throw soil on the fire, 
to beat the fire out, and to cut down or remove fuel in the fire’s potential path. 
4.3.10.2.  Indirect Attack. The indirect attack is taken at varying distances from the fire. 
This method is used when the fire is too hot, too big, or moving too fast to use a direct 
attack. With this approach, the idea is to stop the fire by removing fuel from its path. 
Accomplished this by cutting fire breaks with hand tools or heavy equipment (Figure 
4.3). When appropriate, consider using natural fire breaks such as roads and streams. The 
FES should have a map of all environmentally protected areas of the installation and 
avoid indirect attack methods in those areas. 
Figure 4.3.  Engineers Using Heavy Equipment to Cut a Fire Break 
 
4.3.11.  Fire Rescue Techniques.  Attacks on an installation can result in multiple burning 
and collapsed facilities, downed electrical power lines, damaged vehicles, and trapped and 
injured personnel; possibly leading to an urgent need for widespread rescue operations. 
Although FES and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel may be fully engaged in 
emergency operations and unable to respond to all potential emergencies simultaneously, CE 
auxiliary fire fighting teams must temper their response to situations by considering their 
training, skill, and available personal protection before attempting a rescue operation. 
Furthermore, they must carefully evaluate each potential rescue situation in terms of the 
probability of making a safe and successful rescue before attempting such an activity. Most 
importantly and whenever possible, leave it to the professionals because they possess the 
training, equipment and tools to do the job. 
4.3.11.1.  Burning Buildings. Probably the most hazardous duty professional firefighters 
perform is fire fighting and rescue operations inside a burning building. Even in a 
wartime environment, CE personnel performing auxiliary fire fighting should not enter a 
burning building to fight a fire. Before entering a burning building to attempt a rescue, 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  47  
auxiliary fire fighting team members must first consider their own personal safety. Under 
no conditions should auxiliary fire fighting teams attempt a rescue in a burning building 
above the ground floor. Although the basic combat helmet, body armor, M50 mask, work 
gloves, and boots used by most CE personnel provide a limited measure of protection, 
they are not effective against the heat and toxic gases produced by an intense fire. 
Chemical protective masks do not protect the user from oxygen deficient environments 
and should not be used during fire fighting operations. 
4.3.11.2.  Collapsed Buildings. The difficulty in rescuing people from bombed or 
collapsed structures depends to a large degree on where they are located. During war, the 
situation may be aggravated by the possible presence of UXO in the rubble. Again, 
unnecessary chances should not be taken. The situation may dictate that rescue efforts be 
limited to helping only those victims that are readily accessible or slightly trapped. 
4.3.11.3.  Electrical Contact. When rescuing a victim who is touching electrically 
energized wires or equipment, always take precaution to protect yourself and others. It is 
essential that all electrical wires and conductors be treated as if they are energized. If the 
wire is not entangled with the victim’s body, a wooden pole with a hook on the end 
should be used to drag the victim clear of the wire. Under no circumstances should the 
rescuer or their clothing touch the wire or victim during the rescue operation. Sometimes 
it is more practical to remove the cable from the victim. This can be done by throwing 
one end of a rope over the line. Both ends of the rope are then tied together and the wire 
is carefully pulled away. 
4.3.11.4.  Vehicles. Vehicle rescues and extrications can be complex and demanding. 
Auxiliary fire fighting teams are limited in their ability to perform these tasks because 
they lack the FES training or power tools to execute difficult vehicle rescues or 
extractions. However, if FES and EMS teams are engaged in other attack response tasks 
and unavailable to respond, CE personnel may be able to render assistance by stabilizing 
the vehicle, performing basic first aid and helping injured, movable victims from 
vehicles. As with all rescue operations, safety during a vehicle rescue is essential. If 
safety is disregarded, both the victim and the rescuer may be placed in further danger. 
The first action in a vehicle rescue is to ensure the vehicle is stabilized before entering. If 
the vehicle is on its side or upside down, it should be stabilized by placing wedge boards, 
rocks, or other debris under the vehicle. If no material for this purpose is readily 
available, improvised methods can be tried such as using tire jacks and ropes, or opening 
the trunk and hood. After the vehicle is stabilized, select the easiest way to enter the 
vehicle—doors are the first choice. If they are jammed, a window may have to be used. If 
a window must be broken, start with the rear window; provided it gives a larger opening 
and glass will not fall on the victim. The goal is to gain access to the victim, stabilize, and 
protect this individual until extrication is possible. If the victim is trapped in the vehicle 
by the steering wheel, seats, or dashboard, stabilize the person until professional help 
(EMS or FES personnel) arrives. If the victim is conscious, coherent, and not completely 
entangled in the vehicle, removal operations can start. First, wounds should be bandaged, 
fractures splinted, and the body immobilized to reduce the chance of further injury. Once 
the victim has been properly prepared for removal, cover sharp edges in the vehicle and 
pad the opening through which the victim will be moved with blankets or similar 
  48  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
materials. When removing the victim, travel as smoothly as possible and try to avoid any 
jerking or sudden movements. 
4.4.  Search and Rescue (SAR) Concepts.  SAR operations are a crucial function during 
contingencies. Whether the emergency is the result of a major aircraft accident, a natural 
disaster, or an enemy attack, there may be scores of injured personnel who must be located, 
treated, and evacuated (Figure 4.4). SAR missions must be carried out promptly by trained 
personnel with the proper equipment, or it is highly probable that casualties will increase 
dramatically. In the aftermath of a major disaster or attack, FES personnel are ready to perform 
SAR. If called upon, augmenting CE forces should also be ready to assist with SAR activities. 
The following paragraphs address potential CE involvement in SAR operations. 
Figure 4.4.  SAR Team Removes Wounded Victim from Rubble 
 
4.4.1.  CE Involvement in SAR.  CE personnel may be involved in SAR operations in 
several ways. Depending on the type and extent of the emergency, CE SAR support may 
range from minimal to very extensive. Firefighters and rescue personnel would undoubtedly 
be very involved in the rescue of survivors from an aircraft crash or other major accident on 
the base, but would provide little, if any, SAR support for a group of campers lost in a nearby 
forest. The rescue of the campers would probably be handled by a local agency and civil 
engineers would provide support only if requested and authorized. The following areas 
outline possible CE responses to SAR requirements. 
4.4.1.1.  FES. Highly trained FES personnel are the most qualified to conduct SAR 
operations. Not only do most of them have advanced life saving training and the skills 
and equipment to rescue persons trapped because of a disaster, but also they will always 
be the first to respond to a major aircraft accident on the air base. Once at the scene, they 
use their resources to control fires and extract survivors from the aircraft. 
4.4.1.2.  Augmentees. In a demanding attack recovery environment, the installation can 
be faced with numerous fires, extensive damage, and injured personnel requiring 
emergency rescue and medical care. Getting to fires and rescue locations may be 
complicated by the presence of UXOs, craters, pavement damage, and scattered debris 
caused by bombs and other ordnance. Fire fighting and rescue is accomplished with fixed 
numbers of professional firefighters, equipment, and materials. Attrition can be expected 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  49  
to steadily decrease the availability of professional firefighters, fire vehicles, and rescue 
capabilities. In such a challenging scenario as this, the FES flight may not have the 
resources to simultaneously respond to and extinguish all fires; respond to all rescue 
situations, and support all aircraft incidents. Commanders decide which fire to fight, 
which fires to let burn, which people to rescue and which people to leave to buddy care. 
These and other decisions will affect the launch and recovery of aircraft, the response to 
returning battle-damaged aircraft, and the operation of both fixed and mobile aircraft 
arresting systems. Augmentees may be needed to perform SAR operations that 
professional firefighters and emergency medical responders are unable to attend. 
Therefore, CE personnel, along with other combat support forces, must possess the basic 
knowledge and skills to help save lives and mitigate human suffering. These skills 
include self-aid and buddy care or combat lifesaver skills (Figure 4.5). The severity of 
the emergency will dictate the number of persons needed to perform SAR duties, but 
efforts should be made to select individuals with some of the following qualifications: 
4.4.1.2.1.  Good physical condition. The physical demands of SAR operations are 
likely high 
4.4.1.2.2.  First aid training (survivors may need first aid to prevent serious 
complications) 
4.4.1.2.3.  Advanced emergency medical care 
4.4.1.2.4.  Specialized rescue equipment experience 
4.4.1.2.5.  Familiarity with the geography of the SAR area 
4.4.1.2.6.  Knowledge of area search methods and survivor extrication procedures 
Figure 4.5.  SAR Augmentees Should Possess Basic Lifesaving Skills 
 
4.4.2.  Site Access Support.  CE heavy equipment operators’ skills can be invaluable in 
clearing access to the site of a major disaster. When rescue vehicles are unable to reach and 
remove the survivors of an aircraft crash in a heavily wooded area, CE earth moving 
equipment can clear a road or create a path to the crash site. Following an earthquake, an 
engineer crane could be used to remove the fallen beams of a collapsed building, allowing 
rescuers to reach survivors trapped beneath the rubble. 
  50  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
4.4.3.  Rescue Equipment.  The type of equipment employed by a SAR team will depend on 
the type of emergency and the location of the rescue effort. Medical equipment and supplies 
are normally carried in fire rescue vehicles or ambulances to aid the injured during an on-
base disaster and to an aircraft accident in a remote region. If an off-base area precludes 
vehicular travel, medical supplies may be carried in by SAR personnel or delivered by air. A 
team going into a wilderness area would also require navigational aids, food, water, portable 
shelters, and other items to operate in an inhospitable environment. The following general 
categories of equipment should be considered when equipping SAR teams for missions: 
4.4.3.1.  Communications. Portable hand-held or backpack-type transceivers should be 
used for radio communications between team members, the staging installation (when 
established), and SAR aircraft, if used. 
4.4.3.2.  Navigation Equipment. Detailed maps of the search area showing all terrain 
features, landmarks, and water sources are a necessity. A global positioning system, 
reliable compasses or other direction-finding equipment are required for rescue 
operations in remote areas. 
4.4.3.3.  Operational Equipment. Select equipment appropriate for the type of SAR 
operation the team is expected to perform. A SAR operation centered on an area of 
demolished structures on the installation requires crowbars, shovels, rope, and similar 
items to assist in freeing people entrapped in the debris. Conversely, if the operation’s 
goal is to reach a downed aircraft in a snow-covered mountain area, snowshoes, 
mountaineering equipment, and portable litters should be among the team’s equipment. 
4.4.3.4.  Food and Water. Food and water will only be carried by teams operating in off-
base remote areas. Teams should carry adequate quantities to sustain an operation lasting 
48 to 72 hours. If the mission goes beyond these limits, the team should be resupplied. 
4.4.3.5.  Photographic Equipment. A simple, reliable camera is needed for missions 
involving aircraft crashes. Photographic evidence of aircraft wreckage, instrument panels, 
aircraft controls, and terrain disfigurations is useful for accident analysis. On-base 
disasters requiring photography should be provided by installation photographers. 
4.4.3.6.  Loud Hailer (Bullhorn or Portable Loudspeaker). This item is used for 
coordinating team actions at the rescue scene. 
4.4.3.7.  Survivor Extraction Equipment. Metal cutters, ax, knife, body splint, litter, pry 
bar, and a hydraulic rescue kit are typical items used by FES for situations involving 
extraction of survivors from downed aircraft. 
4.4.4.  SAR Operations.  SAR operations can be limited in scope, involving small search 
parties that cover the area on foot, or a massive effort covering thousands of square miles of 
land or sea, and involving ships, aircraft, and personnel of other services and governmental 
agencies. Engineer SAR operations will generally be limited to installation disaster response 
and, when required, operations support in the local community. 
4.4.4.1.  Installation SAR. Probably the most common SAR operation on the installation 
involves a major aircraft accident. In such a situation, firefighters/rescue personnel are 
responsible for containing any resulting fire and promptly removing survivors from the 
wreckage. A systematic search of the surrounding area may also be required to locate 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  51  
persons thrown from the wreckage by the impact. In most aircraft accidents on an 
installation, the crash site will be defined and team efforts will concentrate on the 
immediate rescue of personnel rather than search of the surrounding area. Other 
installation SAR operations result from earthquake, flood, hurricane, or enemy attack. 
Under these conditions, several search teams should be assigned to search the installation 
for survivors. Searches of this type require precise coordination and require all teams be 
thoroughly briefed on designated search areas, techniques, rescue procedures, 
communications protocol, reporting requirements, and availability of medical support for 
survivors. The SAR operation should ensure the entire disaster area is covered with no 
duplication of effort, which could result in delays in reaching survivors. 
4.4.4.2.  Off-Installation SAR. CE involvement in off-installation SAR efforts will 
probably be limited to heavy equipment support for access to a disaster site and 
augmentation of search teams. CE resources should not participate in off-installation 
operations if there is a high probability they will be needed for installation recovery or 
rescue operations. Regardless of the location, basic SAR operations generally follow the 
sequence shown in Figure 4.6. 
Figure 4.6.  SAR Sequence of Operations 
 
4.4.4.3.  SAR Debriefing. The debriefing should occur as soon as the SAR team returns 
from the search area to determine if the team has information affecting the outcome of 
the SAR mission. This is particularly important for teams assigned to a mission still in 
progress. In addition to providing first-hand information about the results of the SAR 
mission, the debriefing can supply knowledge of support requirements to other SAR 
teams and suggestions for improvements to the ongoing effort. 
4.5.  Summary.  The likelihood the FES flight will be engaged in higher priority tasks 
immediately following an attack on the installation or other major incident is real; for that 
reason, other CE forces should be prepared to respond to smaller fires affecting important CE 
resources with the intent of stopping such fires in their early stages of development. CE forces 
should also be capable of performing limited personnel rescue and first aid activities. However, 
personal safety must be a primary consideration before performing any of these tasks. Personnel 
performing auxiliary fire fighting duties must not exceed their capability or training and 
supervisors should be aware of the personnel skills and equipment required for engaging small 
fires and the SAR effort.

Chapter 5 
EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE RECONNAISSANCE (EOR) 
5.1.  Introduction.  Undoubtedly, UXOs are a consequence of warfare and they can be a 
dangerous threat to mobility, personnel, equipment, and facilities. During an installation attack, 
the enemy could use a combination of munitions; some that detonate on impact, others with 
delay-fuzes, and possibly anti-personnel/material devices. The enemy’s use of these methods 
could drastically hinder aircraft launch and recovery efforts by blocking rapid access of 
surviving aircraft to usable aircraft pavements, impeding the movement of recovery crews to 
their equipment and materials, interfering with the response of repair and rescue crews to 
damage sites, and instilling fear and hesitation into all installation personnel due to the inherent 
danger of random or inadvertent munitions detonations. Under these situations, rapid and 
accurate EOR becomes critical so EOD personnel can prioritize their efforts and determine areas 
of the installation that may be relatively safe to traverse. Since CE recovery tasks require access 
to virtually all areas of the installation, our forces must be capable of identifying, reporting, and 
marking UXOs properly so we can quickly make our way to the job site and ensure our EOD 
personnel respond to the highest priority needs first. 
5.2.  Overview.  Primarily, this chapter is relevant to non-EOD personnel and relates to their 
actions with respect to EOR. Mostly, it addresses common types of UXO they may encounter 
and their role in EOR. To a lesser extent, this chapter addresses engineer support provided to 
EOD teams performing UXO clearance operations. Reducing or clearing UXO threats, including 
IEDs, is an EOD responsibility. It is critical that ONLY EOD personnel conduct clearance of 
UXO threats (Figure 5.1). Non-EOD personnel and PAR team members should be trained to 
identify, mark, and report UXO threats using procedures outlined in paragraph 5.5.6 and Table 
5.2. The EOD flight is responsible for providing area of responsibility-specific EOR training to 
base personnel to supplement AF EOR web-based training, when required. For specific EOR 
information and requirements, refer to Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 
3-2.12, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Unexploded Ordnance. 
Figure 5.1.  Only EOD Personnel Render-Safe or Destroy UXOs 
 
5.2.1.  During certain emergency conditions, UXOs can be a significant issue limiting the 
progress of base recovery operations. Explosive ordnance problems will primarily affect 
overseas theater air bases, but cannot be ignored by the CONUS bases since terrorist attacks 
or munitions accidents could place them in a similar predicament. The major steps in any 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  53  
operation involving potential hazards from UXO are EOR, explosive ordnance safing, and 
explosive ordnance removal/destruction. 
5.2.2.  Non-EOD personnel are not directly involved in UXO render safe operations, but they 
should be prepared to assist EOD personnel in other aspects of these operations when 
required. Additionally, during recovery operations, EOD teams may need to be augmented 
by engineer forces trained as EOD augmentees. The two primary tasks for EOD augmentees 
in operations involving explosive ordnance are assisting EOD personnel in UXO 
reconnaissance and aiding in the removal of UXO that have been rendered safe and 
designated for removal. 
5.3.  Types of Explosive Ordnance.  Weapons manufacturers are constantly making numerous 
types of explosive ordnance in all shapes, sizes, and lethality. Knowing the type of munitions 
that could be encountered during EOR is essential to individual safety and accurate reporting of 
UXOs. According to AFTTP 3-2.12, explosive ordnance is generally grouped into four main 
types: dropped, projected, thrown, and placed. 
5.3.1.  Dropped Ordnance.  Regardless of its type or purpose, dropped ordnance is 
dispensed from an aircraft. There are three subgroups of dropped ordnance: bombs, 
dispensers, and submunitions (mines, bomblets, and grenades). Consider all bombs and 
submunitions to have magnetic/seismic or anti-disturbance fuzing. Simply stated, this means 
approaching them could detonate the ordnance. 
5.3.2.  Projected Ordnance.  Projected ordnance is fired from some type of launcher or gun 
tube. It can be projectiles, mortars, rockets, rifle grenades, or guided missiles. Projectile 
bodies can be one piece of metal or multiple sections fastened together. 
5.3.3.  Thrown Ordnance.  Commonly known as hand grenades, classification of thrown 
ordnance is by use as follows: fragmentation (also called defensive), antitank, smoke, and 
illumination. Moving, jarring, or otherwise disturbing this ordnance may cause it to explode. 
Never pick up or disturb a hand grenade, even if the spoon and safety pin are still attached. 
Consider all grenades to have anti-disturbance or anti-removal devices. 
5.3.4.  Placed Ordnance.  Placed ordnance is commonly referred to as land mines. Land 
mines are hidden, buried, or placed on the surface, and often cannot be seen. Visual detection 
of land mines is often difficult. Consider all mines to have anti-disturbance or anti-removal 
devices. Mines equipped with magnetic or seismic influence fuzes may detonate when 
disturbed. Conduct all observation of this ordnance with binoculars at the greatest distance 
that still allows gathering of required information. Placed land mines can destroy vehicles 
and inflict casualties on personnel who step on or drive across them. There are three basic 
types of land mines: antitank, antipersonnel, and chemical. 
5.4.  Classes of Explosive Ordnance.  Explosive ordnance may be defined as bombs and 
warheads; guided and ballistic missiles; artillery, mortar, and rocket ammunition; anti-
personnel/material and land mines; demolition charges; pyrotechnics; grenades; torpedoes and 
depth charges; and all similar or related items or components, explosive in nature, designed to 
cause damage to personnel or material. Excluding IEDs, Figure 5.2 through Figure 5.6 depicts 
the class, shape, and size of various types of explosive ordnance from Air Force Visual Aid 
(AFVA) 32-4022, USAF Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) Recognition and Reporting Chart. Each 
class of explosive ordnance could be encountered on an installation after an attack.

Figure 5.6.  Class F UXOs (Rocket-Propelled Grenades and Grenades) 
 
5.5.  EOR.  The accomplishment of EOR activities is vital to installation recovery. AFI 32-3001 
defines EOR as the investigation, detection, location, marking, initial identification, and 
reporting of suspected UXO, by EOR-trained personnel, in order to determine the need for 
further action. The initial step in dealing with UXOs is reconnaissance. Although unit PAR 
teams and other installation crews perform EOR, CE personnel are usually in a unique position 
to do much of the EOR effort after an enemy attack because engineer damage assessment and 
emergency repair teams are often the first on the scene after an attack. During the initial damage 
assessment of the installation, engineer teams can provide first-hand information on the presence 
of UXOs. 
5.5.1.  Difficulties and Complications.  EOR can expose engineer forces to very hazardous 
situations. Add the potential presence of a CBRN environment and the EOR task becomes 
  56  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
more difficult. In addition to the obvious hazards and complexities involved with EOR, CE 
leadership should expect some confusion from the misidentification of UXOs by personnel 
with limited ordnance recognition experience. It should also be expected that different crews 
or people would likely report the same item of ordnance multiple times. Locating and 
identifying buried or hidden ordnance may also be a problem. Supervisors should anticipate 
and make allowances for these and other difficulties and be prepared to adjust accordingly. 
5.5.2.  Personal Protection.  Personnel performing EOR duties on foot (dismounted) should 
wear protective body armor if available. If performing mounted EOR operations, armored 
vehicles can reduce the risk from some, but not all UXO threats. Personnel performing EOR 
operations in non-armored vehicles face nearly the same risk from UXOs as dismounted 
personnel because the protection afforded by non-armored vehicles is negligible. Commonly 
used armored vehicles include the Up-Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled 
Vehicle (aka HUMVEE), and the Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicle 
(Figure 5.7). Although conventional vehicles are sometimes modified with protective armor, 
they likely do not afford the upgraded protection of purpose-built armored vehicles such as 
the MRAP. 
Figure 5.7.  MRAP Armored Vehicle 
 
5.5.3.  Basic Safety Precautions.  Safe operations are especially important during EOR 
operations. Careless actions near a UXO can result in death or injury of personnel as well as 
serious damage to adjacent equipment and facilities. Personnel performing EOR must be 
aware of the dangers involved and never touch or tamper with any UXO not rendered safe by 
EOD personnel. Basic safety practices when performing EOR include: 
5.5.3.1.  Maintain Safe Distance. Personnel performing EOR should observe (with 
binoculars if necessary) potential UXOs from the safest distance that still allows the 
gathering of required reporting information. Be sure to keep adequate frontal and 
overhead protection. If an item is discovered that is believed to be a UXO, additional 
reconnaissance for the sole purpose of a complete report is not performed until EOD has 
arrived. 
5.5.3.2.  Disturbances. Do not touch or disturb the UXO or associated components, 
including loose wires or parachutes. Disturbances, either mechanical or otherwise, may 
cause the item to detonate. 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  57  
5.5.3.3.  Chemical/Biological Hazards. Assume the presence of chemical agents when 
there is the presence of liquid droplets, dead animals, dissolved paint, or peculiar odors. 
Put on protective equipment immediately. 
5.5.3.4.  Radio Transmit Hazard. If reporting by radio or cellular phone, transmit from a 
minimum safe distance for handheld or vehicle radios according to AFMAN 91-201; 
otherwise the signals may cause some UXOs to detonate. Generally, the distances are 10 
feet for cellular phones, 25 feet for handheld radios, and 100 feet for vehicle radios. 
5.5.4.  Protective Measures near UXO Threats. When operating in an environment with 
UXO threats, employ protective measures to help ensure the safety of personnel and critical 
equipment. There are three basic methods to protect personnel and equipment when UXO 
threats are discovered; evacuate, isolate, or barricade. 
5.5.4.1.  Evacuate. Upon identification of UXO, a decision must be made to either shelter 
in place or evacuate/retreat to a safe distance. PAR teams must be trained to recognize 
when it is appropriate to evacuate or shelter in place. If the decision is made to evacuate, 
the safe stand-off distance will depend upon the size of the UXO and the type of 
structures in the area. Small UXO/sub-munitions may not require total evacuation, only 
to a safe area of the facility. Refer to AFTTP 3-2.12 for recommended evacuation 
distances. After evacuating all personnel and equipment, movement within the area 
should only be allowed for mission essential operations. 
5.5.4.2.  Isolate. Sometimes, for mission-related, operational, or other reasons, personnel 
and/or equipment cannot be evacuated or leave a particular area. When this happens, it 
may be necessary to isolate either your assets (personnel, equipment, and operations) 
from the UXO or isolate the UXO from your assets by establishing safe areas and 
limiting exposure within the threat area. 
5.5.4.3.  Barricade. Personnel and equipment that cannot be moved can sometimes be 
protected with barricades. A barricade is an artificial barrier that provides limited 
protection by channeling the blast and fragmentation away from the threatened area. 
Barricades are usually constructed using a circular, semicircular, or wall design (Figure 
5.8). The type of design used depends on the UXO threat and area needing protection. 
Suppressive barricades are constructed to isolate an explosion, to deflect the 
thermal/shock wave, and absorb low-angle, high-speed fragments. Protective barricades 
are constructed around exposed resources to shelter from overpressure and impact of 
high-angle, low-speed fragments, which can escape over the top of suppressive 
barricades. Sometimes, local terrain features can form natural barricades providing 
adequate frontal and overhead protection. If natural barricades are judged inadequate, 
construct artificial barriers according to AFTTP 3-2.12. Constructing barricades can be 
very time-consuming and may require soil-filled containers, earth-moving equipment, or 
a large number of sandbags. If earth-moving equipment is available, consider building 
earth barriers in place of sandbag barricades. While building barricades, personnel should 
not disturb the UXO and should wear all protective equipment (to include Kevlar helmets 
and vests). Depending on the size of the UXO, build suppressive barricades around the 
UXO to protect the entire area, or build protective barricades next to non-evacuated 
personnel or equipment to shelter from overpressure and impact of high-angle, low-speed 
  58  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
fragments of exploding ordnance. Priority should be given to evacuation of resources and 
building protective barricading. 
Figure 5.8.  Barricade Examples 
 
5.5.5.  EOR Equipment.  The equipment used by personnel performing EOR depends on the 
severity of the attack and the availability of materials. Although not all-inclusive, Table 5.1 
lists typical equipment and supplies for personnel performing EOR tasks:

5.5.6.  UXO Recognition and Reporting.  The recognition of a UXO threat is the initial and 
most important step in reacting to a UXO threat. United States (US) personnel have been 
casualties of UXOs in virtually every conflict or contingency in which the US has 
participated. This can be attributed primarily to unfamiliarity with UXO countermeasures and 
avoidance procedures. Personnel operating in a contingency environment should be able to 
recognize and react safely to UXO threats. The hallmark of good EOR is proper 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  59  
identification, marking, and reporting of suspected UXO, which is accomplished by 
following five basic actions: Confirm, Clear, Cordon, Check, and Control (Table 5.2). These 
basic actions are referred to as the “5-C’s.”

5.5.6.1.  Confirm. Proper identification of UXOs assists EOD in understanding the threat 
in order to provide commanders with the best COA to mitigate the threat. Determine and 
confirm class, shape, and size of explosive ordnance using the UXO identifications 
addressed in paragraph 5.4. Following an enemy attack, UXO can potentially be at any 
location on the installation. However, if UXO exists, it may be concentrated in those 
areas of the installation heaviest hit by attacking forces. The general search area for 
UXOs and the possible type of UXO in the area can be determined from the effects of the 
munitions that did explode. The extent of damage to the area or facility can give 
personnel performing EOR an indication of the size and type of munitions used and 
provide valuable clues regarding the identification of UXO. Once all the information 
regarding the UXO is obtained report the information to your UCC. Timely and accurate 
UXO reporting is crucial to installation recovery after an attack. CE personnel 
performing EOR should report UXOs to the UCC or EOC by the fastest means available, 
using the EOD 9-Line Report provided in Table 5.3. The following additional factors 
may provide clues to the possible types of UXOs present and the potential damage or 
injury that could occur if the ordnance detonated.

5.5.6.1.1.  Blast Effects. The visible blast effects from ordnance that exploded in the 
area can be a relatively accurate prediction of damage that could occur to adjacent 
facilities if accidental detonation of the UXO occurred. 
5.5.6.1.2.  Fragmentation. An examination of fragments in a destruction zone should 
indicate the type UXO that may be present. The presence of fragments from cluster-
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  61  
type bombs should alert the team to smaller explosive devices, which may have been 
widely scattered from the initial point of impact. 
5.5.6.1.3.  Incendiary. Incendiary ordnance can be especially destructive because it 
feeds fires and compounds initial damage. Evidence of incendiary ordnance should be 
included in the EOR report to the EOC so FES support can be positioned to contain 
the flames if incendiary UXO detonates. 
5.5.6.1.4.  Craters. The size of bomb craters is a good indication of the size ordnance 
involved and is an indication of the radius of damage to be expected if UXO of the 
same type detonates. 
5.5.6.1.5.  Camouflets. The camouflet is the result of an underground burst of a bomb 
(Figure 5.9). In areas where camouflets are numerous, personnel performing EOR 
should be especially observant for evidence of buried UXO. Camouflets can collapse 
and are full of poisonous gases, void of oxygen. 
Figure 5.9.  Deep Burst (Camouflet) 
 
5.5.6.1.6.  Buried UXO. Aircraft-delivered ordnance, which does not explode, is 
likely to be completely or partially buried due to its impact force with the surface. 
Personnel conducting EOR must be familiar with the visible evidence of buried UXO 
as well as the methods for locating and identifying the ordnance. The most common 
evidence of buried UXO is the entry hole. An entry hole, crater, or related damage is 
a good indication that buried UXO may be present. The specific location of buried 
UXOs can be determined by the use of mine or metal detectors by qualified EOD 
technicians. 
5.5.6.2.  Clear: To ensure the safety of all essential and nonessential personnel in the 
immediate area, it is important the area surrounding the UXO(s) be cleared of all 
personnel. Refer to AFTTP 3.2-12 for guidance on the proper safe separation distance 
(SSD) based upon the type and size of the UXO. If evacuation is impossible, isolate or 
barricade the UXO and any surrounding facilities if necessary. Follow steps provided in 
paragraph 5.5.4.2 and 5.5.4.3 above. Always remember to leave the area the same way 
you entered. 
  62  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
5.5.6.3.  Cordon. Cordon off the area surrounding the UXO with some type of physical 
material such as rope or bright yellow “UXO Marking Tape.” It is recommended that a 
light source such as a cyalume glow stick be used so the UXO is visible during the night. 
It is important that unauthorized personnel be kept away from the UXO. All UXO 
discovered by personnel conducting EOR should be clearly marked as hazardous areas. 
Use the standard UXO marker identified in Figure 5.10, or other materials as improvised 
UXO markers. This marking serves two purposes. First, it identifies the location of the 
UXO to the EOD team entering the area to disarm the UXO. Ensure the markers are 
visible in all approach directions, at day or night. Second, the marking warns other 
persons of the location of the UXO so that it may be avoided. Reduce the risk of 
unintentional entry into the threat area by evacuating and controlling the area as 
addressed in paragraph 5.5.4. 
Figure 5.10.  Standard UXO Marker 
 
5.5.6.4.  Check. Ensure you check the immediate and surrounding area for other UXO. 
Some UXO may be laying on the surface or buried in the ground. Visible and obvious 
holes or disturbed earth may indicate that a UXO did not detonate and is buried in the 
ground. 
5.5.6.5.  Control. Control the area and make certain that only emergency services 
personnel, such as medical, FES, and EOD are the only ones allowed to enter the cordon. 
5.6.  Support to EOD UXO Operations.  As previously discussed, personnel should not attempt 
to disarm UXOs or move ordnance not rendered safe by EOD personnel. Doing so could cause 
additional facility destruction or fatal injury to personnel. CE support to EOD UXO operations 
could take the form of constructing protective berms around the danger zone during disarmament 
operations and providing equipment support for access to or removal of the UXO. Civil 
engineers might be called upon to rope off areas around UXOs, provide protective reinforcement 
to adjacent structures and heavy equipment to remove debris for access to the UXO, isolate 
major utilities in the area, or remove ordnance that has been rendered safe. 
5.7.  Summary.  Understanding the various types of UXO that may be encountered in a wartime 
situation and the engineer’s role in EOR is essential to installation recovery after an attack. In 
addition to locating and accurately identifying UXOs, those selected to perform EOR duty must 
also know how to properly mark and report UXOs. These activities and other support tasks allow 
EOD personnel to respond more quickly, permits other engineers to get their wartime taskings 
accomplished faster, and, perhaps most importantly, protects the lives of our personnel and other 
important resources.

Chapter 6 
EXPEDIENT FACILITY AND UTILITY REPAIRS 
6.1.  General Information.  Immediately following a disaster or an attack by hostile forces, CE 
personnel begin to repair damage and restore vital services necessary for the installation to 
continue its assigned mission. The primary concern will be in repairing runway and taxiway 
damage that prevents the launch and recovery of mission aircraft. Other repairs, such as those to 
restore critical installation facilities and utilities, should proceed at a rate commensurate with 
available resources and priorities established by the command element. It may not be feasible to 
delay main base repairs until all runway and taxiway repair activities are complete. For example, 
if ruptured POL lines pose hazards to C2 facilities, the installation population, or aircraft 
servicing operations, immediate response may be required to defuse the threat. A damaged or 
burning facility may require immediate assistance by CE forces to extract entrapped personnel. 
Ideally, there would be adequate personnel and materials available to do simultaneous recovery 
tasks. However, the more likely situation will find the BCE making some very prudent and 
judicious decisions to assign repair priorities to a wide range of damaged facilities and utilities 
whose restoration is critical to mission support. 
6.2.  Overview.  This chapter briefly examines processes relating to emergency facility and 
utility repairs during contingency operations. Specifically, it addresses expedient repair processes 
and strategies, repair considerations, and a brief review of CONUS versus OCONUS theater 
repair operations. Additional expedient repair information is provided in AFPAM 10-219, 
Volume 7, Expedient Methods. ADR principles and concepts are addressed in Volume 4 of this 
publication series and will not be discussed here. For comprehensive expedient repair 
procedures, consult applicable Technical Orders (T.O.) or Technical Manuals (TM). 
6.3.  Expedient Repair Processes and Strategies.  AF engineers have the responsibility for 
emergency repairs using expedient methods on USAF installations. The US Army has 
responsibility for major restoration and emergency repairs beyond AF organic capability. In this 
regard, however, US Army forces may not be immediately available; therefore, the BCE will 
likely plan repairs accordingly. If expedient repairs are to be accomplished in a timely manner 
following a catastrophe, it is important that the recovery effort be well organized and 
coordinated. The following is a brief examination of processes and strategies for accomplishing 
expedient installation repairs. 
6.3.1.  Repair Processes.  Starting with the initial damage assessment, all activities are 
structured to reflect the existing situation. Damage assessment teams are manned with 
personnel having experience in the major structural- and utility-related engineering trades 
and are instructed on the type of information needed for repair planning and response. The 
UCC uses the damage assessment inputs from the assessment teams to build an installation 
recovery strategy. As damaged areas are identified, expedient repair efforts are organized to 
restore vital installation infrastructure. Repairs are concentrated on three major areas: runway 
ancillary equipment, crucial installation utility systems, and key installation structures. 
6.3.1.1.  Runway ancillary equipment includes aircraft arresting systems, airfield lighting, 
NAVAIDS, and supporting utilities. These systems are critical to the launch and recovery 
of combat aircraft and therefore receive high priority for repair efforts. 
  64  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
6.3.1.2.  Installation utility systems include electrical, water, POL, natural gas, HVAC, 
sewer, and drainage. Expedient repairs to these systems generally include isolation of the 
systems or quick fixes such as clamps and splices, but in some cases, a new source of the 
utility must also be provided. Installation of mobile generators and construction of 
shallow wells with the accompanying water treatment equipment may be necessary. 
6.3.1.3.  Expedient repair of mission-critical structures is generally limited to shoring and 
patching activities. In some situations, demolition is required to eliminate major safety 
hazards. 
6.3.2.  Basic Repair Strategies.  Repair work following a disaster or hostile attack will go 
much smoother if the following basic strategies and procedures are considered: 
6.3.2.1.  Parts and Materials Substitution. Under some circumstances, damaged utilities, 
particularly foreign systems, may be repaired more efficiently by modifying the original 
system and substituting other materials and equipment. For example, prime item 
replacement parts for foreign electrical or water systems may not be available but the 
system can be restored to operation by using approximate size or capacity US standard 
parts. The extent of damage and available local stocks of repair parts and materials are 
governing factors. 
6.3.2.2.  Repair Time. Since time is normally a limiting factor in repairs made during 
installation recovery, rapid completion of the job is more important than economy of 
labor, materials, and equipment. In making improvised repairs, any suitable material or 
equipment available is used to meet immediate needs. A repaired broken water main does 
not have to be leak-proof to be functional. Expedient repairs are improved as time and 
supplies permit. 
6.3.2.3.  Cannibalization. Systems having identical or similar components may be 
restored by robbing parts from some damaged units to repair others. 
6.3.2.4.  Local Materials and Supplies. Local materials should be used whenever possible 
to reserve shipping space for more essential items. 
6.4.  Expedient Repair Considerations.  There are a number of important considerations when 
planning and performing expedient facility and utility repairs during contingency operations, 
including personnel and work safety, extent and priority of repairs, repair strategy, support 
lighting, and potential civilian contractor assistance. 
6.4.1.  Safety.  Safety is an important consideration when accomplishing any type of repair, 
but it is especially important with regard to expedient repairs following an emergency. The 
very nature of the disaster or attack recovery environment makes repair activities inherently 
dangerous. Structures may be weakened; live electrical wires may be down; explosive gas 
vapors may be present; CBRN contamination may be present; and UXOs may litter the 
installation. Installation medical facilities may be crowded with casualties and CE manpower 
may be at critical levels. These conditions will make it essential limited resources are not 
further strained by injuries caused through neglect of safety practices. It is the responsibility 
of every member on the repair crew to perform recovery tasks with the utmost concern for 
safety. Personnel must be knowledgeable of technical and operator manual safety 
requirements before performing operations or using equipment. 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  65  
6.4.1.1.  Because of its lethal nature, working around energized circuits is of particular 
concern. Arc flash protection must be provided for all AF operations exposing personnel 
to energized parts greater than 50 volts. Protective clothing required, if any, shall be 
based on the procedures outlined in Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-560-01, Electrical 
Safety, O&M and AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices. Additionally, Arc Flash 
warning labels (Figure 6.1) must be present on switchgear, switchboards, panelboards, 
disconnect switches, industrial control panels, meter socket enclosures, and motor control 
centers IAW UFC 3-560-01. 
6.4.1.2.  Every repair job or operation has its own particular safety hazards and work 
crews must follow proper safety procedures to prevent injury or illness. In addition to 
wearing required PPE, workers must adhere to basic safety rules for specific CE 
operations and equipment IAW AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety 
Instruction. See Attachment 5 for a list of basic safety rules for CE operations and 
equipment. 
Figure 6.1.  Arc Flash Warning Label 
 
6.4.2.  Extent of Repairs.  The efforts of AF civil engineers in the period immediately 
following an emergency should be limited to minimum emergency repair of crucial facilities 
and utilities. All work should be done expediently, concentrating on functional rather than 
cosmetic repairs. A primary consideration when determining what repairs should be made is 
the function of the damaged facility or utility. Those damaged activities which are not 
essential to the installation mission and do not present a hazard should be left as they are 
until time and resources permit conventional repairs. 
6.4.3.  Repair Priorities.  Immediate repair priorities should be established following a 
disaster or hostile attack. These priorities are usually based on previously developed CRPs, 
as well as from reports on the extent of damage following the emergency and the immediate 
operational requirements facing the installation. Generally, lifesaving operations and damage 
repair to the runway and taxiway system (if the installation supports flying operations) 
should be considered as the most essential. After lifesaving operations and runway repairs, 
the prioritized activities listed in Table 6.1 should be considered for repair efforts. These 
priorities are not “set in concrete.” It would be impossible for any priority listing to be 
inflexible considering the variations that may occur from the CONUS to overseas theater 
operations and from disasters to enemy attacks. Look upon these priorities as general 
  66  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
guidance, realizing that the actual contingency situation will dictate the commander’s 
specific repair priorities. 
Table 6.1.  General Guidance for Repair Priority 
Repair Priorities 
1 
NAVAIDS/Runway Lighting. NAVAIDS and runway lighting are vital to the 
operation of aircraft in continuing the installation mission. CE efforts at these facilities 
will consist of repairs to electrical power systems, mechanical repairs, and structural 
repairs. 
2 
C2 Facilities. The various C2 facilities coordinate installation flying and non-flying 
activities and are essential for effective operations following a disaster or hostile attack. 
CE support will consist of structural and utility repairs as well as continued expedient 
maintenance to ensure that these critical facilities remain in operation. 
3 
Communications Facilities. Reliable communications are required for coordination of 
rescue and recovery efforts following a disaster and for the effective management of 
combat resources after an enemy attack. In either case, the civil engineer’s function will 
be to provide utility and structural repairs to communications facilities and any 
assistance that might be required for the communications repair crews. 
4 
POL/Munitions Facilities. Adequate supplies of POL for both aircraft and ground 
vehicles will be required during an emergency. Repairs to these facilities will generally 
be performed by fuel specialists, but the CE force should be prepared to lend its 
expertise as required. Repair of munitions facilities will be crucial following an enemy 
attack to support future combat operations. If these facilities are damaged during a 
disaster, repairs can probably be delayed unless essential for the installation mission. 
5 
Fire Station. Following certain disasters or an enemy attack, there are likely to be 
conditions that will contribute to the start and spread of fires. Additionally, during any 
emergency, there will be requirements for the specialized rescue skills of FES personnel. 
Since the fire station must continue to function to manage these diverse activities, 
restoration of structural integrity and basic utilities will be essential. 
6 
Medical Facilities. The numerous injuries that will occur during an emergency require 
that medical facilities receive a high priority in contingency repairs. 
6.4.4.  Support Lighting.  The damage following any major contingency is likely to dictate a 
requirement for portable lighting. ADR operations performed at night will require substantial 
lighting for the repair operations taking place on the MOS and access taxiways. Damage 
repair to other areas of the installation may require lighting and electrical power for hand tool 
operations. Performing many force beddown tasks during hours of darkness would be 
virtually impossible without some type of lighting. To provide lighting for these operations, 
three common options are available. 
6.4.4.1.  Temporary Lighting. Using standard electrical repair materials and a small 
generator such as that included in the Prime BEEF team kit, temporary lighting can be 
fabricated in the field to serve small area projects and needs. 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  67  
6.4.4.2.  Portable Floodlight Set. The ADR equipment package and WRM force beddown 
equipment sets include portable lighting sets, which are most adaptable to our recovery 
requirements. Similar units are also part of the Prime BEEF team kit. All lights are fully 
adjustable and operate simultaneously or individually. 
6.4.4.3.  Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Units. At air bases, maintenance personnel 
will use AGE lighting units during aircraft repair and servicing operations. Borrowing 
such units from the maintenance complex could provide lighting support for recovery 
situations. This option, however, should be viewed as a fallback position since there is no 
guarantee that AGE units will be immediately available to engineer forces when needed. 
6.4.5.  Use of Civilians.  Civilian contract assistance, if available, can be a valuable asset 
during installation recovery efforts. Military authorities should emphasize the extent of repair 
work to be done to prevent rehabilitation beyond immediate military needs. If the work is 
being done following a hostile attack; especially at overseas locations, civilians must be 
carefully selected to avoid possible sabotage. 
6.5.  CONUS versus OCONUS Theater Repairs.  Natural and man-caused disasters can affect 
both CONUS and overseas theater installations causing similar damage and necessitating similar 
repairs. Much of the damage associated with a conventional enemy attack at an overseas theater 
installation could be duplicated at a CONUS location by an earthquake, tornado, or terrorist 
attack. The CONUS and overseas theater expedient repair techniques may differ largely due to 
the local environment, availability of resources, and the type of systems needing repair. The 
following paragraphs will highlight some typical differences between CONUS and OCONUS 
theater repair operations, keeping in mind that many of the basic repair techniques will be the 
same regardless of location. 
6.5.1.  CONUS Repair Operations.  The primary advantage of conducting repair operations 
at a CONUS location is that the CE repair team is generally working with standard American 
tools, equipment, and materials. Replacement parts and materials obtained from a supplier or 
salvaged from damaged facilities will likely be a standard size and require less field 
modification to complete an expedient repair. Manpower support is also much more reliable. 
A core of civil service employees with years of experience and knowledge is normally 
available at each installation for disaster response activities. Experience has also shown that 
contractors working on an installation will often times readily assist in disaster response 
measures. Lastly, support from off-base sources, both with respect to manpower and 
materials, is likely to be more readily available than in certain OCONUS theater locations. 
6.5.2.  OCONUS Theater Repair Operations.  Repairs at an overseas theater installation 
following a disaster or attack can be more complex than the same repairs at a CONUS 
location. Differences in parts and equipment, utility systems, supplies and material, or low 
levels of host nation support can all affect expedient repair capability and how quickly the 
installation can recover. 
6.5.2.1.  Differences in Equipment and Materials. Metric sizing of various components is 
common in overseas areas, and the repair team’s tools may not be ideally suited for every 
piece of equipment. Building materials and other supplies obtained from local vendors 
may be of non-standard sizes or of different qualities than those available in the US. 
  68  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
6.5.2.2.  Electrical systems at OCONUS theater installations are a major area requiring 
adjustment of repair methods. Although power systems should always be checked to 
determine voltages, 220 volts, 50-cycle current is common throughout the world with a 
few exceptions such as the US and Saudi Arabia. The differences that may exist between 
the CONUS and overseas theater systems should not deter theater CE personnel in their 
repair efforts. Even the most diverse systems or materials can be made to work together 
using innovative field expedient methods. For example, American-made and European-
made pipe of slightly different sizes could be connected by welding, with makeshift 
rubber gaskets fitted to ensure a tight seal. As another illustration, damaged components 
of an older European heating system, requiring custom-made replacement parts, could be 
repaired by using field-fabricated components or parts cannibalized from a similar 
system. 
6.5.2.3.  Host Nation Support. The degree of host nation support at overseas theater 
locations also impacts the ability to perform emergency repair taskings. At some 
locations, host nation support will be plentiful, equaling the capabilities of CONUS 
locations. At other sites, host nation support may be essentially non-existent. Host nation 
support for expedient repair activities could range from provision of well-trained military 
units and contractors with substantial amounts of materials and equipment to supply of 
only the bare essentials in the way of basic construction materials and unskilled labor. 
The differences in host nation support capabilities make every theater installation a 
unique operating location in terms of expedient facility and utility repair. 
6.6.  Summary.  As an interim measure, expedient methods will be required to repair installation 
damage resulting from a natural disaster or enemy attack. The ability to restore operations across 
the installation depends heavily on the level or extent of the damage and the repair priorities 
following the emergency. Expedient repairs are generally considered complete when major 
damage has been eliminated and most systems are capable of performing their basic functions. 
CE forces now turn their efforts to a more permanent upgrade of these makeshift remedies and 
the organization of resources for the continuing operations and maintenance required to sustain 
the installation mission.

Chapter 7 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) AND FOLLOW-ON REPAIR 
7.1.  General Information.  Expedient repairs are completed, and the threat of continued enemy 
activity or a recurrence of the natural phenomenon that caused the disaster is minimal. This is not 
the time, however, to stop and rest. The BCE now guides efforts from the expedient mode to a 
more deliberate mode of operation and maintenance (O&M) as well as taking action to facilitate 
improved repairs. With a complete understanding of agreements between other DOD engineering 
forces and AF units regarding the degree of support that will be provided, the BCE makes the 
most effective use of all resources during this damage repair period. Using information from 
early damage assessments, follow-on visits to damage locations, and knowledge of the 
installation mission, a work plan should be developed. The plan should define what work needs 
to be done and when, and suggests methods of accomplishment. 
7.2.  Overview.  After expedient repairs are made, O&M focuses on upgrading previous 
temporary repairs to allow for extended O&M of sustained flying operations. As in the initial 
recovery phase, identification of required work is essential. Additionally, safe, alternate 
transportation routes should be established, diminished supplies should be replenished, and 
remote stockpiling should be considered. This chapter outlines general procedures for identifying 
and documenting follow-on work requirements. Information is also included, which outlines CE 
options for accomplishing O&M work. For tasks within the capability of in-house forces, 
guidance is provided on making repairs that are more durable and better support the installation’s 
mission. Later sections of the chapter deal with alternate transportation routes for use during and 
after emergencies. Maintenance and repair of existing routes are emphasized with design and 
construction of new routes covered briefly as a last resort measure. Finally, resupply of 
diminished stocks needed for operations, maintenance, and upgrade of repairs is addressed. 
Consideration for dispersed stockpiling of materials is also included. 
7.3.  O&M Safety Considerations.  After the urgency of the immediate disaster recovery phase 
has passed, safety is still a critical consideration. Personnel will likely be experiencing a state of 
mental and physical exhaustion unlike any other previously experienced. Safety is everyone’s 
concern, but supervisors should be especially observant and cautious. Watch for signs of 
excessive fatigue, and do not allow personnel to overextend themselves. Carelessness usually 
accompanies fatigue. Shortcuts taken when people are tired and not thinking clearly can have 
disastrous results. 
7.4.  The O&M Concept.  The concept of O&M is a process for accomplishing work. It is a 
familiar theme for AF CE units in that their peacetime responsibilities are centered on the 
procedures and requirements associated with O&M taskings. Many similarities exist in the O&M 
concepts for both peacetime and wartime or contingency disaster recovery situations; however, 
several differences are also present. We will examine these differences as the steps for 
accomplishing O&M work are addressed. For our purposes here, the O&M concept will be 
addressed according to the six basic steps listed in Table 7.1. 
 
  70  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
Table 7.1.  O&M Concept 
O&M Concept 
Step 1 
Identify the work that needs to be done. 
Step 2 
Estimate the work requirements. Each job should be quantified in terms of 
man-hours, materials, and equipment necessary. 
Step 3 
Assign work priorities. These priorities will aid in developing a work strategy. 
Step 4 
Develop a work plan or strategy capable of sustaining the sortie rate necessary 
for combat operations. 
Step 5 
Assemble resources. Action must be taken to acquire the resources estimated in 
Step 2. 
Step 6 
Do the work. The final and most important step is to complete the work 
identified. 
7.4.1.  Work Identification (Step 1).  As addressed in Chapter 3, damage assessment teams 
are dispatched during the initial recovery phase to identify and quantify damage. Due to the 
urgency of immediate repair response after a disaster, assessments are necessarily limited to 
those requirements that most impacted launch and recovery of combat mission aircraft. Some 
damages were repaired during this initial recovery period using expedient methods, others 
were isolated, and others were ignored. In the disaster recovery O&M period, it is time to 
identify all repair requirements, irrespective of scope and importance to the primary 
installation combat mission. Expedient repairs should be replaced with permanent fixes, 
isolated utilities should be reinstated, and problem areas that were originally put aside should 
be corrected. Regardless of what repair actions were taken during the immediate aftermath of 
a disaster, all follow-on work should be identified in enough detail to convey the specific 
requirements of the job. For example, a general statement of work to repair the electrical 
service to a building is not enough information to allow a repair crew to do the job 
effectively. Details such as replace 25 kVA transformer and replace the service drop to the 
facility should be provided. A detailed description of work will ease detailed estimating and 
possibly save valuable repair time. Personnel chosen to perform the work identification 
should also be capable of determining, at least in a preliminary sense, how the work will be 
accomplished; e.g., by in-house forces, by contract, by Army engineers, etc. This will aid in 
the performance of the next step, work estimating, in that different levels of detail are 
required for the different methods of accomplishment. 
7.4.2.  Estimate Work (Step 2).  Estimating work is quantifying work in terms of the 
manpower, materials, and special equipment required. For in-house work, rough man-hour 
estimates are provided for each craft required on a particular repair. Materials are specified 
by description, quantity, and if in stock, by the stock location. Special equipment should be 
addressed, particularly if its requirement is not made obvious by reading the work 
description. This is most helpful when equipment must be rented or acquired from another 
agency. For non-in-house work, initial estimating should be of sufficient scope to allow 
contract programmers to produce costing and programming documents. MAJCOMs should 
also be informed of the fiscal requirements and work scopes so contract monies and inter-
service support can be obtained. 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  71  
7.4.3.  Assign Work Priority (Step 3).  At this stage of the disaster recovery effort, the 
assignment of work priorities is crucial to generating and maintaining a sortie rate adequate 
to sustain the combat mission. Similarly, prudent appropriation of available manpower and 
resources is the key to the expeditious recovery of the installation and the resumption of the 
full flying mission. All work will fall into one of the categories used for peacetime O&M 
purposes. As compared to peacetime operations, however, more priority ones and twos will 
probably be identified since facility, utility, and airfield pavement damages will cause many 
mission hindrances, safety hazards, and perhaps even health hazards. Expect to see work that 
is normally a low priority in peacetime become a higher priority in the disaster recovery 
period. Drainage work is a prime example. In peacetime, such activity is usually a routine 
maintenance function but in the disaster recovery environment, if flight line area flooding is 
caused by drainage system blockage, repairs will rapidly become critical. Also, be sure to 
maintain a combat mission mindset when assigning work priorities. What are considered 
safety deficiencies in peacetime may well be acceptable risks in the disaster recovery period. 
Furthermore, be wary of assigning too high a priority to quality of life features at the expense 
of direct mission support requirements. The pressure will be on to do this, and therefore it is 
imperative to maintain a balanced perspective. The work priorities listed in Table 7.2 will be 
used in the disaster recovery timeframe: 
Table 7.2.  Disaster Recovery Work Priorities 
Work Priorities 
Priority I 
Work done in direct support of the mission 
Priority II 
Work done to provide adequate security or to eliminate hazards 
Priority III 
Work done to prevent a breakdown of essential operations and services 
Priority IV 
Work not qualifying for a higher priority 
7.4.4.  Develop a Work Plan (Step 4).  Now that the first three steps in the preparation 
phase are completed, the transition from preparation to execution can begin. So far the 
requirements have been identified, labor and materials estimated, and a rough priority listing 
established. Now the task calls for arranging the work by order of importance and making the 
final determination of how it is to be accomplished (in-house or otherwise). Several factors 
influence the development of a disaster recovery work plan, and many of them interact with 
each other. Only after each of these factors has been considered can a work plan be deemed 
complete. 
7.4.4.1.  Scope of Work. The scope of identified work requirements should be closely 
considered to preclude overloading various trades. Such action causes a bottleneck in task 
accomplishment and subsequent slippages in work completions. Look closely at contract 
support for tasks that are large in scope, require unique skills or expertise not normally 
available in a typical military engineer unit, or require many man-hours of a particular 
trade as compared to others. 
7.4.4.2.  Material Availability. To a large extent, the availability of materials will 
determine which of the highest priority tasks will be performed first. Maximize use of 
whatever special levels and WRMs are remaining; they are there to support contingency 
and wartime situations. Materials being held for peacetime O&M requirements are also 
  72  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
another source of supply support. Cannibalization from lower priority damaged facilities 
or utilities should likewise be considered, particularly for items that traditionally have 
long lead times. Put higher priority systems back into full service this way and let lower 
priority systems wait for the supply system to provide the necessary materials. Do not 
overlook the value of local purchase for repair materials. In many cases, much of an 
engineer unit’s peacetime supply overseas comes from local sources. Any standing 
contracts or purchase orders from local vendors should be increased to obtain as much 
material as possible. 
7.4.4.3.  Manpower Availability. The majority of disaster recovery O&M actions will be 
accomplished by in-house forces simply due to their immediate availability. If engineer 
units from other services are in place, however, they should be incorporated into the 
disaster recovery O&M work strategy as well. Use these units wisely. Assign major 
restoration tasks associated with critical facility and utility requirements to these units. 
Do not waste their talents on low- priority jobs or tasks that do not utilize their full 
engineer capability. At some locations, the local economy may be able to furnish 
contractor support for O&M requirements. Work with installation contracting personnel 
to line this support up for tasks that do not require a detailed design effort. Another 
avenue of manpower support that should be investigated is that of local civilian over 
hires. Historically, much of the civil engineer’s wartime and contingency labor support 
has come from this source. Not only will in-house skilled personnel be freed up for more 
technical tasks, but the potential also exists for adding additional semi-skilled personnel 
to the O&M workforce. Lastly, remember that some of your work force will be required 
to provide day-to-day operations support and will not be fully available for repair 
taskings. Account for this in your planning but do not over-man this area—go with a 
minimum manning concept. 
7.4.4.4.  Timing Constraints. Disaster recovery O&M efforts will be greatly affected by 
timing constraints, which, in turn, steer the development of the overall work, schedule. 
Mission support is the driver for work scheduling, and all activities should be aimed at 
satisfying these taskings first. Additionally, do not be hesitant to mix in-house forces with 
contractors or other engineer units. Work your manpower assets together toward a 
common goal of bringing the most critical portions of the installation back up to standard. 
7.4.4.5.  Funds Availability. Keep your MAJCOM informed of your funding 
requirements for supply, civilian pay, and contract support. To some extent, each 
installation can keep the supply lines flowing by reallocation of local O&M funds, but 
few installations will have the ability to fund any sizable contract support or civilian pay 
increases. As disaster recovery O&M efforts progress, the need for additional funding 
will increase since requirements will become more defined. 
7.4.5.  Assemble Resources (Step 5).  Gathering of work materials, equipment, and 
assigning manpower to the various tasks are the first steps in the execution phase of the 
disaster recovery O&M effort. Follow your work plan priorities as closely as possible and 
exploit the various avenues of supply and manpower support mentioned earlier to build your 
O&M capability. 
7.4.6.  Accomplish Work (Step 6).  Accomplishing the work is the final and most important 
step in the execution phase and the O&M concept. This final step brings civil engineers 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  73  
closer to fully recovering the installation and sustaining the flying mission. As more and 
more repairs are made to installation facilities and utilities, be prepared to transition an 
increased portion of your work force to an operations mode. 
7.5.  Airfield Ancillary Equipment O&M.  O&M of ancillary airfield equipment is critical to 
the operation of the airfield. Items such as aircraft arresting systems, airfield lighting, and 
NAVAIDS, which were installed or expediently repaired immediately following the emergency, 
should now be maintained to support continuing aircraft operations. Any upgrade repairs that can 
be made to these systems without degrading the operational capability of the installation should 
be attempted at this time. 
7.5.1.  Aircraft Arresting Systems.  In a wartime situation where only a MOS has been 
made available for aircraft launch and recovery, a MAAS has most likely been installed. 
Routine servicing and inspection of the system must be maintained throughout its period of 
use. Refer to T.O. 35E8-2-10-1, Arresting Systems, Aircraft, Mobile, for MAAS operation 
and maintenance procedures. In all likelihood, however, once the threat of re-attack is over, 
efforts will intensify to bring the full runway surface back into operation. This, in turn, will 
permit permanently installed arresting systems to be reinstated into service. Once such 
permanent barriers are put into use, servicing and inspection efforts should be devoted to 
these systems. The mobile system then should be removed, reconditioned as necessary, and 
placed back into standby storage. In the event that airfield damages were such that the 
permanently installed systems could still be used during the disaster recovery period, 
particular attention should be paid to any expedient repairs that were made on the systems. 
All repairs made by substitution should be identified. A listing of the materials required to 
restore the system to full operational capability and alleviate the parts substitution condition 
should be developed. These materials should be immediately ordered and installed once they 
are received. Additionally, any stockpiled replacement parts that were expended during 
repair efforts should also be replenished. Repairs beyond component replacement are usually 
beyond the capability of the in-house work force and should be identified to the parent major 
command so that appropriate repair support can be arranged. 
7.5.2.  Airfield Lighting System.  If a MOS was established, an emergency airfield lighting 
system (EALS) was probably installed to support night and adverse weather flying 
requirements. Make daily checks of the system according to in-use preventative maintenance 
guidelines. Refer to T.O. 35F5-3-17-1, Lighting System, Airfield, Emergency A/E82U-2, for 
EALS operation and maintenance procedures. As repairs to runway pavement surfaces are 
being made, concurrent repairs to the permanently installed airfield lighting system should be 
accomplished with the intent of having the system operational when the full runway is 
brought back into service. If damage conditions permitted the permanently installed airfield 
lighting system to be used in lieu of a mobile system, it is still likely that some expedient 
repairs had to be made immediately after the attack or disaster ended. The objective now 
during the O&M phase of recovery operations is to upgrade these repairs to meet normal 
standards as quickly as possible and perform the maintenance necessary to keep the system 
fully operational. 
7.5.2.1.  If the power supply to the airfield lighting vault has been interrupted, restoration 
of this primary power should receive emphasis. Repair crews will have two major 
taskings: 
  74  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
7.5.2.1.1.  Operate and maintain the backup generator. Increased running time 
requires more frequent inspection and maintenance. 
7.5.2.1.2.  Pursue actions necessary to restore primary power to the airfield lighting 
vault. This could mean running new underground cabling to the vault or permanently 
repairing previously made expedient connections. 
7.5.2.2.  If the problem is with the underground system supplying each lighting circuit, 
sometimes it can be corrected by merely replacing damaged sections of underground 
direct burial cable or by repairs of a duct system. Replacement of direct burial cables is a 
simple task that can be accomplished by in-house forces if materials are available. Before 
a decision is made to make a repair in-house, first consider the impact the work will have 
on available resources and how it affects your capability to do other work. 
7.5.2.3.  In-house forces should make daily inspections of the lighting systems. Check for 
inoperative lights, damaged splices, and damaged surface run cables. Daily tasks include 
replacing burned out lights/damaged fixtures and repairing or replacing damaged splices. 
7.5.3.  NAVAIDS.  The type and number of NAVAIDS and the support given these aids by 
civil engineers will vary. You may be required to repair the metal frame for the wind sock or 
perform daily operational checks of the generator providing power to the Tactical Air 
Navigation (TACAN) facility. Any facility or utility damage that directly affects the 
operation of critical NAVAIDS should be repaired immediately. Likewise, the identification 
and completion of repairs required to restore the facility or supporting utility system should 
carry a high priority. 
7.6.  Utility Repairs.  The early expedient repair of utility systems is critical to preserve life, 
eliminate hazards, and support the operational mission. It pays dividends to upgrade the 
expedient repair to a more permanent repair as soon as possible. Expedient repairs are temporary 
at best, the longer they are left without upgrade, the greater the chances for repeated breakdown 
and failure. Increased incidents of failure drain resources and degrade the mission capability of 
the installation. The BCE should identify, quantify, and set the priority for all repair 
requirements. The COA selected will depend on how the work will be done; whether 
accomplished in-house, by contract, or by some type of work force augmentation. 
7.6.1.  Electrical System.  All damage as well as all expedient repairs should have been 
documented during initial recovery phases. Use this information as a departure point to 
determine required actions. Still another, perhaps more comprehensive damage survey should 
be made to identify the total scope of needed repairs. Discussing repair requirements with 
electrical and power production personnel will further clarify and quantify the repair effort. 
During the survey and especially during follow-on repair efforts, remember, the dangers 
associated with working on the electrical system make it imperative that the techniques and 
procedures outlined in AFI 32-1064 be applied at all times. 
7.6.1.1.  Power Generation Plants. If moderate to heavy damage to power production 
plants has been sustained, it is likely that expedient repairs will not have been possible. 
Major restoration efforts will be necessary, and contract action is probably the only 
answer. If damages were only slight, however, repairs to electrical production systems 
will have initially included maximum cannibalization and the use of spare parts to get all 
possible units back on line and in full production. In some cases, wrecking and shoring 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  75  
actions may have been taken to make the facility housing the power production units 
structurally safe. Automatic control and monitoring systems that could not be repaired 
may have been bypassed and replaced with whatever was available for a “makeshift” 
manual operation. Now is the time to determine to what extent upgrade repairs can be 
made and what maintenance operations are required. 
7.6.1.1.1.  Where makeshift manual controls are in use, ensure that all equipment is 
operating within the correct tolerances and that the appropriate output is being 
achieved. Otherwise, further damage to production equipment can occur or, in the 
case of incorrect output, the result can be damaged distribution equipment or worse. 
Ensure that replacement control panels are requisitioned. 
7.6.1.1.2.  Check and monitor fuel lines supplying the generators for serious leakage. 
Arrange for permanent repairs to be made thereby eliminating any potential fire or 
safety hazards. 
7.6.1.1.3.  Make any facility repairs that are needed to permanently weatherproof the 
power units and switchgear. 
7.6.1.2.  Individual and Mobile Power Units. In most situations, individual or mobile 
generators were expediently repaired either through cannibalization/spare part use or by 
total replacement if damaged beyond immediate repair. Repair upgrade actions should be 
relatively minimal with the exception; perhaps, of repairing splinter protection features 
(i.e., steel bin revetments, sandbags, earth berms, concrete revetments, etc.). Of more 
importance is the O&M of these units and the dedicated effort necessary to keep them 
functional. These generators should be checked at least daily and refueled as required. 
Fuel consumption data and the size of the tank should give an indication of how often a 
unit must be refueled. A refueling and services inspection schedule should be developed 
and strictly followed. 
7.6.1.3.  Distribution System. Depending upon the nature of the disaster, repairs to the 
distribution systems may vary from simple to very complex. If manpower and needed 
materials are available, most installations have the technical capability to make 
permanent repairs to the overhead distribution system. Some repairs, such as 
straightening leaning poles and adjusting line sag, will require no materials at all. 
However, the electrical distribution system at most installations is at least underground, 
and survey of such a system is a more difficult task. The underground system supports 
critical operations and is usually located in operational flying areas around the flight line. 
All manholes should be checked for structural damage as well as damage to the 
distribution system. Extreme caution should be exercised when entering or working on 
underground systems. Manholes can become settling points for combustible and/or 
extremely noxious gases. Most installations have the capability to check for potential line 
insulation breakdown. This should be done so that lines can be replaced before a failure 
occurs that could be detrimental to the installation mission. 
7.6.1.3.1.  If damage to the distribution system is heavy, it is likely that the 
distribution system off the installation has also sustained damage. In this situation, the 
local power company cannot be relied upon for assistance. This is the point where 
disaster planning efforts start to pay dividends. If there are electrical contractors in the 
local area that are capable of delivering the assistance needed, they were identified in 
  76  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
local CRPs. The value of negotiating a requirements (on-call) contract during the 
contingency planning phase becomes evident now in the form of a critical time 
savings. 
7.6.1.3.2.  Typical electrical distribution system upgrades and repair actions to be 
taken during the O&M phase of installation recovery include the activities in Table 
7.3. 
Table 7.3.  Typical Electrical Distribution Upgrade and Repairs 
Upgrade/Repair Actions 
Replacement of temporary ground-level distribution lines with permanent lines 
either above ground level or below ground as appropriate 
Installation of new service drops to repaired facilities 
Replacement of damaged power poles 
Repair of structural damage to vaults, switching stations, and security fencing 
Repair of damaged transformer banks 
7.6.2.  Water System.  The water system is extremely important. It is needed not only for 
consumption, but also for fire fighting, food preparation and hygiene, decontamination, and a 
great many other uses. System components are normally categorized as source, treatment, 
storage, and distribution. 
7.6.2.1.  Source. If the source has remained intact or has been repaired, determine 
whether it is still adequate to meet current needs. This determination will be based upon 
quantity and usability. The quantity can be calculated based on number of personnel, fire 
fighting requirements, and any other special considerations resulting from the 
contingency and recovery effort. Usability means potable. For fire fighting and many 
other uses, this is not so critical. The source should be treated periodically to ensure that 
it is free of contaminants. If the source is not adequate and supplementary wells have 
been developed, they should be inspected daily to ensure a sufficient water level for the 
installation could be maintained. Pumps also should be checked and serviced to ensure 
proper running conditions. 
7.6.2.2.  Treatment. If water treatment facilities were only lightly damaged by the attack 
or disaster and expedient repairs subsequently made, initial efforts should be concentrated 
on bringing the plants back up to the standards they were at before the disaster. 
7.6.2.2.1.  Typical O&M phase taskings would include: 
7.6.2.2.1.1.  Replacement of automatic controls and monitoring systems that was 
initially damaged and bypassed. 
7.6.2.2.1.2.  Repair of structural components to ensure weather protection and 
security. 
7.6.2.2.1.3.  Repair of any piping that was bypassed in an attempt to keep at least 
a portion of a plant operating. 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  77  
7.6.2.2.1.4.  Replacement of any auxiliary or backup pumps and motors that were 
damaged. 
7.6.2.2.2.  If, on the other hand, treatment facilities were heavily damaged, chances 
are repairs will be of the magnitude that a contract or major construction effort would 
be required. Water treatment in such a situation would have to be provided using 
several mobile water purification units. Such units require considerably more 
operating attention than a normal water treatment plant; therefore, an engineer 
squadron having to contend with this type of operation will have to expect an 
additional demand on available manpower. 
7.6.2.3.  Storage. Loss of storage capacity will place an additional demand on production 
of water. This would be a particularly severe problem if the installation developed a 
critical shortage in fire fighting requirements. If an installation has lost a sizable portion 
of its water storage capacity, one of the initial tasks once aircraft launch and recovery 
have been established should be to locate and develop an alternate source of non-potable 
water for fire fighting resupply. 
7.6.2.3.1.  Heavily damaged water storage tanks, reservoirs, etc., will likely be 
beyond repair or at least beyond the in-house repair capability of the typical base CE 
unit. Restoration of such facilities will have to be a contract effort. In the interim, 
consider using flexible storage bladders positioned at critical locations around the 
installation. Tank trucks are another alternative. 
7.6.2.3.2.  Minor damage to water storage structures can usually be repaired by 
draining the tanks and patching any punctures that have been sustained and replacing 
the necessary components of any measuring gauges that may have been damaged. 
Ground-level and above ground-level tanks should be checked daily to verify 
structural soundness. Damaging effects from blast pressures and ground shock may 
not show up immediately. 
7.6.2.4.  Distribution. In all probability, the bulk of CE water system repair taskings after 
an attack or disaster will be associated with the distribution system. This is due to the 
widespread nature of the piping network and its subsequent vulnerability to collateral 
damage. During the O&M phase of the installation recovery effort, the amount of damage 
received on the distribution system will dictate the repair methodology. If heavy damages 
were incurred, contract and/or construction battalion support will definitely be required. 
In fact, even if damages initially appear light, some outside support will probably be 
necessary since water distribution systems are extremely fragile and problems tend to 
continually surface long after the threat of attack or natural disaster has passed. On the 
other hand, the importance of the water distribution system for maintaining and 
sustaining overall installation operations will mean that some in-house repair efforts will 
always be needed. Typical repair tasks that can be expected for in-house accomplishment 
include the activities listed in Table 7.4. 
 
 
  78  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
Table 7.4.  Typical In-House Water Distribution Repairs 
Repair Actions 
Replacement of expedient aboveground lines with permanent 
below-ground piping 
Replacement of damaged or bypassed valves 
Reconnection of lines that were capped 
Replacement of pipe sections that were cracked or fractured 
Replacement of damaged pumps in pumping stations 
7.6.2.5.  Safety and Hygiene. As permanent repairs and upgrades to the water system are 
being accomplished, engineer personnel should be conscious of standard safety and 
health practices. Ground conditions are less stable after an attack or natural disaster due 
to such physical effects as shock propagation and soil saturation. It is likely that shoring 
for deeper excavations will be necessary and many more barricades and similar marking 
devices will be required due to the greater than average numbers of line breaks incurred. 
Pay special attention to water quality. Many underground distribution system problems 
will initially remain hidden, and the potential for external contamination of water 
supplies through these undiscovered line breaks is great. For this reason, the importance 
of disinfecting water systems before returning them to service cannot be overemphasized. 
Furthermore, once the distribution system is generally operational, water quality checks 
should be taken at various points on the installation on a scheduled basis to ensure purity 
standards are maintained. Water quality checks should be performed in concert with 
bioenvironmental engineering (BE) personnel. 
7.6.3.  Sewage System.  It will be during the O&M phase of the installation recovery 
operation that the majority of repairs to the sewage treatment and distribution system will be 
accomplished. As with the other utility systems, surveys should be made to identify what 
expedient repairs were made following the disaster and what permanent upgrade and 
replacement actions should be undertaken. While repairs to the sewage system are ongoing, 
care should be taken to ensure that expedient repairs or other workarounds are kept 
serviceable. Pumps and flexible lines being used as lift station or blocked main bypasses 
should be frequently checked and serviced as needed. If porta-potties, chemical toilets, or 
other self-contained sanitary facilities are used, provisions should be made to collect, 
transport, and properly dispose of the human wastes. 
7.6.3.1.  Treatment Plants. Sewage treatment plants do not lend themselves very well to 
expedient repair. Such repairs would be generally limited to minor piping repairs, control 
system bypassing, and patching of berms around ponds and lagoons. If a treatment plant 
was damaged sufficiently enough to take it completely out of service, it is probable that a 
contract effort would be required for restoration purposes. Although a vulnerable facility, 
it is unlikely such a facility would be a primary target, and its normally remote location 
decreases its chances of receiving collateral damage. 
7.6.3.2.  Distribution Systems. O&M efforts with regard to distribution systems usually 
involve repairs to distribution mains and valves, manholes, and lift stations. 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  79  
7.6.3.2.1.  Repairs to sewer mains are needed when they are fractured, collapsed, or 
blocked. Stoppages are normally obvious and may be corrected by routine 
maintenance procedures. Hidden fractures can go unnoticed for some time. Fractures 
or stoppages caused by collapsed mains will require excavation so the damaged main 
section can be replaced. Valve repairs are normally accomplished by replacing the 
entire valve assembly. 
7.6.3.2.2.  Besides pipe collapse, stoppages to sewer lines can also be caused by 
structural damage to manholes. Repair of manhole damage can vary from merely 
clearing debris from the hole to replacing the entire structure. Replacing the manhole 
may be beyond the capability of in-house forces; therefore, be prepared to ask for 
contract or construction battalion support. On the other hand, clearing debris is 
relatively easy, requiring a minimal demand on resources. Once debris has been 
cleared, remember to mark off or barricade the manhole area as a safety precaution. 
7.6.3.2.3.  If a lift station received sufficient damage to put it out of service, a portable 
pump and flexible bypass hoses are normally used as an expedient repair measure. 
Because of the importance of lift stations in moving sewage away from inhabited 
areas, a permanent fix by in-house forces is usually called for. Such a fix would entail 
total replacement of pumps, repair of associated piping, and repair of any structural 
damage to the lift station facility. 
7.6.4.  Heating Systems.  The need to upgrade heating system repairs depends largely on 
prevailing weather conditions. A large central heating system, like the electrical system, can 
sustain a range of damage varying from simple to complex. 
7.6.4.1.  Major Plants. Expedient repairs to a heat production plant will initially include 
repairs to supporting utilities such as electrical and water service. During expedient repair 
operations, damaged automatic controls may have been bypassed with manual controls. 
Parts may have been cannibalized to get as many boilers operating as possible and some 
wrecking and shoring may have been done. These repairs may be well documented, but 
the plant will probably have to be surveyed again to determine the total scope of what is 
needed to attain a fully operational status. Discussion with plant operators will help 
clarify repair needs. 
7.6.4.1.1.  Where automatic controls and monitoring systems have been bypassed and 
manual controls substituted, care should be taken to ensure that all equipment is 
operating within safe ranges. If this is not done, damage to the heat-generating 
equipment is likely to occur and personnel could be severely injured. Any feasible 
permanent repairs of these components should be accomplished. 
7.6.4.1.2.  Expedient repairs to the distribution system will probably have been 
limited due to the operating limits required for distribution. Now is the time to 
attempt repairs that will return the distribution system to its original configuration. 
Fractures are relatively easy to locate by the obvious venting of steam. Steam pits 
should be surveyed for structural damage as well as for mechanical damage to piping 
and valves. Local construction contractors may be an excellent source for not only 
renting excavation equipment but also providing additional skilled labor for repairing 
underground distribution system breaks. 
  80  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
7.6.4.2.  Individual Facility Systems. Many installation facilities will have individual 
heating systems or package units installed. Like major plants, initial repairs to these 
smaller systems will usually involve restoration of supporting utilities (electrical and 
water). Other repairs would include replacement of damaged major components obtained 
through either special level support or cannibalization of similar units. In the case of 
damage to individual heating systems serving high-priority facilities, the quickest 
expedient fix would have been to install a mobile heating system attached to the building 
using flexible ductwork. From an O&M viewpoint, personnel will have to be assigned the 
task of periodically checking, servicing, and refueling these units. From a practical 
perspective, it is unlikely that a building will suffer major damage to the individual 
heating system without also suffering serious damage to other utilities and the structural 
components of the facility. In this case, repairs most likely will have to be accomplished 
as part of a facility repair or restoration project. 
7.6.5.  Gas System.  Hidden gas leaks may occur underground and flow undetected until a 
thorough survey of the system is conducted. 
7.6.5.1.  Expedient repairs have a tendency to require additional repairs. Where service 
was rerouted to provide gas to a critical facility, that service should be checked 
periodically for damage or leaks until permanent repairs can be made. If portable sources 
(bottled) are used, they must be refilled periodically. 
7.6.5.2.  Repairs should never be attempted until the gas supply has been turned off. Be 
sure to allow gas to dissipate to safe levels before attempting excavation or repairs. 
Upgrading of repairs varies from the simple task of installing a clamp on a low-pressure 
line to replacing medium-pressure valves and pipe sections. Regardless of how complex 
or simple the job, safety is paramount. Good planning and a thorough survey of the gas 
system are needed to identify and quantify repairs that must be made. 
7.6.6.  POL Systems.  POL storage and distribution systems could be prime targets for 
potential attackers. The systems can also be severely damaged by natural disasters such as 
earthquakes or collateral effects occurring from attacks on other facilities. Any damage to the 
POL system will be compounded by the volatile nature of the system contents. The 
combustion of fuels leaking from a fracture in a pipe, valve, or tank can cause irreparable 
damage and devastation to the surrounding area. POL systems are critical to the recovery and 
continued operation of the installation because the POL resources are necessary for the 
operation of aircraft and ground support vehicles. 
7.6.6.1.  Many POL systems are constructed with a certain amount of redundancy. If part 
of the POL system is left undamaged, isolation and valving may result in a partially 
operational system that can be used to support the flying mission. Additionally, the rapid 
utility repair kit (RURK) and a future procurement repair system (i.e., Water and Fuels 
Expedient Repair Systems [WaFERS]) provide a means to quickly repair valve and line 
failures resulting from an attack or disaster. Whether isolation or expedient repair 
methods have been used, it is critical that frequent checks of the system be made to 
ensure continued system operability. This includes inspections of isolation points, 
temporary repairs, and the remaining serviceable portions of the system. 
7.6.6.2.  A physical survey is required to identify all work required for permanent repairs. 
Due to the exacting nature and critical skills needed for POL system permanent repair, 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  81  
plan in advance to acquire at least partial contract support. Any major amount of damage 
to the POL system will quickly outstrip the capabilities of in-house forces. 
7.7.  Facilities and Services.  Upgrading of expedient repairs to critical facilities and expanding 
the level of required services are main features of the BCE’s O&M effort after an attack or 
natural disaster. Because of the potentially large scope of these efforts, plan on using contract 
and joint force construction support for at least a portion of this requirement. 
7.7.1.  Facilities.  Recovery actions on facilities are done according to the priority of the 
facility. Efforts are directed towards upgrading expedient repairs and demolishing buildings 
presenting a danger to personnel. The BCE’s efforts regarding facility repair should begin 
with a thorough inspection of facilities so the scope and depth of needed repairs can be 
determined. Use the CE CRP and Facility Priority List as guides to the inspection order and 
check other facilities that are known to have sustained damage. Minor permanent repair 
actions should be identified for in-house accomplishment. Facility restoration beyond in-
house capabilities should also be identified and forwarded to the major command for 
allocation to contract or troop construction efforts. Typical tasks that in-house forces should 
be prepared to perform during the disaster recovery O&M phase include tasks listed in Table 
7.5. 
Table 7.5.  Typical In-House Disaster Recovery O&M Tasks 
In-House Disaster Recovery O&M Tasks 
Replacement of expedient plastic sheeting and canvas patches with plywood or plexi-glass 
patches 
Upgrade of shoring for facilities that will be repaired by other than in-house forces 
Isolation of damaged electrical circuits in a facility that would permit the remainder of a 
facility to be restored to electrical power 
Repair of utility service lines to critical facilities 
Restoration of structural integrity to facilities that are only slightly damaged 
Repair of security fencing/entry gates to critical resource areas 
Demolition of severely damaged facilities (salvage usable materials) 
Sectioning off of damaged portions of a facility to allow use of the remainder of the facility 
7.7.2.  Garbage and Refuse Disposal.  Regardless of disaster recovery conditions, garbage 
and refuse will continue to accumulate, and methods for handling these items must be 
devised. Unfortunately, damage to collection equipment or incinerating equipment may 
temporarily impair or halt collection and disposal efforts. Installation garbage and refuse are 
usually disposed of by sanitary landfills, incineration, sale, or contract. In most cases a 
contract service is used, however, it is likely that such service will be interrupted after a 
disaster has occurred, and particularly after an installation attack. During this period, in-
house forces will have to perform the task. Keep in mind that any disposal method must 
adhere to theater-specific waste management guidance and procedures. Once contract 
support has been reestablished, a joint effort may still be necessary. Although additional 
  82  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
costs may be incurred, contractors should be instructed to use all available transportation for 
collection and disposal and to assist in removal of installation-wide debris. 
7.7.2.1.  If off-base disposal sites are out of service or inaccessible, on-base locations 
must be identified. At these sites, garbage, refuse and debris can either be buried, burned, 
or a combination of both. Although it is important to consider all available methods of 
solid waste disposal, keep in mind there are usually severe restrictions imposed on open 
air burn pits. They should only be used as a short-term solution during contingency 
operations and must be operated in a manner that prevents or minimizes risks to humans 
and the environment. Personnel should consult DODI 4715.19, Use of Open-Air Burn 
Pits in Contingency Operations, for specific guidance on the use of burn pits in 
contingency operations. In areas with a high population density, such as base housing, 
occupants might be allowed to burn or bury their own refuse until adequate disposal 
facilities are made available. Common burial pits can be established for this purpose. 
Plan to monitor closely any type of “self-help” operation—uncontrolled refuse disposal 
can lead to serious fire and sanitation hazards. If on-base locations are created for 
garbage and refuse disposal, ensure a stringent pest control program is instituted to 
alleviate the danger of disease spread. 
7.7.2.2.  If there is a potential for recovery operations in a CBRN environment, follow 
procedures established for contaminated refuse disposal. Refer to AFMAN 10-2503, for 
specific guidance on contaminated waste control and disposal procedures. 
7.7.3.  Snow Removal and Ice Control.  Removing snow and ice from airfield pavements is 
as important as repairing damaged airfield pavements. In the disaster recovery environment, 
however, more care must be taken in some areas. For example, standard snow removal 
techniques may not work on repaired runway areas. It is likely that plow blades will catch the 
edges of anchored mats and perhaps other temporary repairs, thereby damaging the repair 
and probably the plow as well. A lot of handwork and a carefully operated front-end loader 
may be necessary to clear crater repair areas. Additionally, snow removal equipment 
operators will have to be observant of the mobile arresting system location since it will likely 
be positioned differently than the permanently installed barriers. If the runway has not been 
totally opened and a MOS is still in use, the situation is even more complicated. Equipment 
operators will also have to avoid the temporary airfield lighting and edge markers around the 
operating strip. 
7.7.3.1.  At the onset of heavy snow conditions and the ceasing of flying operations, it 
may be advisable to further mark the boundaries of the operating strip with flags or cones 
so that its outline is discernible once snow removal operations begin. If this is not feasible 
due to weather conditions, it may be necessary to identify the edges of the operating strip 
immediately prior to rolling the snow removal equipment to the airfield. It would also be 
advisable to mark the boundaries of any repaired areas since even a little snowfall will 
mask their locations. 
7.7.3.2.  At most locations, snow and ice removal will occur simultaneously on the 
airfield and installation thoroughfares. The following is a general list of the more 
important areas requiring snow and ice removal in an attack recovery environment: 
7.7.3.2.1.  Runway, primary taxiways, and alert parking areas 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  83  
7.7.3.2.2.  Aircraft parking areas and shelter entrances 
7.7.3.2.3.  Access route to aircraft maintenance hangars 
7.7.3.2.4.  Access roads to munitions storage areas 
7.7.3.2.5.  Safe routes to mission-critical facilities 
7.7.3.2.6.  Access routes to POL dispensing points 
7.7.3.2.7.  Primary installation thoroughfares 
7.8.  Transportation Routes.  Refueling and rearming of aircraft, evacuation of personnel, and 
other emergency responses require usable travel routes. The BCE is responsible for maintenance 
and repair of all traffic routes, including making alternate routes available. Alternate routes are 
needed when the primary route has been interdicted or travel on the primary route would be 
hazardous (e.g., downwind of a toxic substance source). 
7.8.1.  Alternate Route Development.  AF installations are normally constructed with an 
adequate network of roads affording sufficient opportunity for development of alternate 
routes. If all possible access routes have been damaged, the first option is to go around the 
damage by removing surface obstacles such as curbing, directing traffic onto the unpaved 
area around the damaged portion of the street, and then back onto the street once the damage 
has been cleared. If possible, try to tie parking lots into the diversion route since this will 
provide at least a partially paved surface. Also, be aware of overhead clearances. Building 
overhangs, electric and telephone lines, and tree limbs can quickly hinder traffic flow. Check 
that utilities, especially water, gas, and sewer, are not running close to the surface in the 
diversion route area. If they are, choose another location for the route or ensure that a hard 
surface such as AM-2 matting is placed over the lines to distribute vehicle weights better. 
When supplies are readily available; cover the diversion route with crushed rock or similar 
material to produce a better, weather-resistant travel surface. 
7.8.2.  Transportation Route Repair.  If going around the damage is not possible, the only 
other option is to repair the damage. This can be done expediently in a manner similar to 
airfield damage repair. Expedient road repair consists of removing debris, backfilling the 
crater, and compacting crater fill material. Difficult repairs, like shoring up a bridge 
superstructure or applying a surface course, should be avoided. Rely on contractors or other 
troop construction units to do this type of work. Permanent road repairs should not be 
attempted until the crisis is past and permanent recovery actions are well under way. 
7.9.  Resupply and Stockpiling.  By now much, if not all, of your stockpiled materials have 
been used up, damaged, or destroyed. To upgrade repairs and continue operation, steps should be 
taken for resupply and possible stockpiling of essential materials. 
7.9.1.  Any preplanning efforts that have been taken pay off now since it is not necessary to 
“build from scratch” a listing of needed materials. Many have already been identified during 
the preplanning process. This compilation, coupled with bench stock lists, shop stocks, 
special levels, WRM, and material identified because of damage assessment surveys, will 
produce a large shopping list. 
7.9.2.  Once a materials requirements’ listing is assembled, the acquisition process begins, 
normally through base supply and the installation contracting office. Contingency and 
wartime resupply usually comes from two sources—the CONUS and the local economy. The 
  84  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
CONUS effort oftentimes is initiated via a “push” system where materials are shipped prior 
to actual ordering by units in the field. The items shipped are common materials that 
traditionally have been needed for engineer support during wartime. In this way, the 
materials identification and ordering time delay is eliminated at least for the initial resupply 
action. Follow-on stocks based on requisitions from the field flow later. For planning 
purposes, assume a 60-day transit time for both initial resupply and the follow-on stocks. 
This essentially means you will have to rely on whatever you have on hand and the local 
economy to support your efforts for at least the 60-day period following the start of 
hostilities. 
7.9.3.  Exploit the local economy as much as possible as a source of supply. One of your 
initial tasks upon arrival at your beddown location should be to identify local contractors and 
material vendors. Visit their locations and see what is available in terms of both scope of 
items carried and quantities normally in stock. Provide this source information to base supply 
and contracting when you place orders. If worse comes to worst, also arrange for 
transportation of materials if this is posing a problem. 
7.9.4.  As materials are received, every effort should be made to control and track use of the 
materials. This will be particularly difficult in the chaotic recovery environment. As materials 
are used and stocks dwindle, material control should take action to replenish stocks on a 
regular basis. The goal should be to develop a supply flow that meets recovery needs and 
avoids excessive delays while at the same time does not flood the installation with more 
materials than will ever be required. Particular care should be taken to order only what is 
needed and not grossly inflate requirements. On the other hand, ensure that emergency stocks 
such as special levels that have been depleted are also replenished. Even though such stocks 
may not be immediately needed, it is only prudent to rebuild on-hand material quantities to 
levels existing prior to the disaster. Do not forget to incorporate “lessons learned” into your 
stockage requirements. If additional critical items are necessary to support disaster recovery 
conditions, add them to your emergency stockage lists. 
7.9.5.  Because the quantity of resupply material may be greater than available warehouse 
space, it could become necessary to stockpile material elsewhere. Remote stockpiling of 
resources (Figure 7.1) at or near a proposed job site can increase efficiency through 
reduction of waste and material handling time. Additionally, such stockpiling serves as a 
dispersal measure thereby affording some added protection from the effects of future attacks. 
Open and dispersed storage of materials has drawbacks that should be countered. Adequate 
security is a primary consideration to prevent weather damage, pilfering, or vandalism. This 
will present the need to inspect and segregate materials as they arrive. Items that are weather 
sensitive must be stored under cover (Figure 7.2). Materials that have high value such as 
copper wire should likewise be secured under cover. Items that are good “trading stock” such 
as plywood and lumber should be at least fenced in with concertina wire.

Figure 7.2.  Store Weather-Sensitive Materials Under Cover 
 
7.10.  Summary.  Making a smooth transition from the expedient repair mode to a more 
sustained mode of O&M with permanent repair upgrades is important. Even when the conditions 
of the emergency have subsided somewhat, the installation is still in a recovery mode. Carefully 
consider your options concerning specific repairs and the O&M requirements for various 
installation utility systems and facilities. Develop a restoration plan that includes total 
requirements, considers priorities, and assesses avenues available (work agencies) to effect 
repairs. Do not forget to include essential services such as refuse disposal and snow and ice 
control and make provisions for an effective resupply program. Maintenance and repair of 
transportation routes will play a key role in enhancing other repair operations. Be aware that a 
clear differentiation is established between Army and AF responsibilities concerning the attack 
recovery and restoration effort. However, differentiation on paper does not mean anything if 
those forces are not available when needed. Bottom line, be flexible, and ensure effective 
employment of those resources you control.

Chapter 8 
PROTECTION, SECURITY, AND DEFENSIVE PROCEDURES 
8.1.  Overview.  Civil engineers routinely perform tasks that are important to successful 
installation operations—these tasks become more vital under threat of attack or other hostile acts. 
When necessary to help safeguard their personnel and secure mission assets and resources from 
enemy action, CE teams must be able to execute certain basic protection, security, and defensive 
procedures. This chapter briefly examines individual and team defensive measures, convoy 
security operations, work party security (Figure 8.1), owner/user security procedures, and base 
defense augmentation. 
Figure 8.1.  Work Party Security Help Safeguard CE Work Crews 
 
8.2.  Basic Defensive Combat Skills for Self-Protection.  The concept of self-protection in this 
section refers to understanding and employing basic defensive combat skills and techniques that 
provide individuals and work crews with a better chance of survival when confronted with a 
hostile situation while, at the same time, ensuring task accomplishment and air base survival. 
These defensive skills could be critical during work site security, base defense, and convoy 
dismounted operations. 
8.2.1.  Cover, Concealment, and Camouflage.  If the enemy can see you, they can hit you 
with weapons fire. So you must be concealed from enemy observation and have cover from 
enemy fire. When the terrain does not provide natural cover and concealment, prepare your 
cover, and use natural and man-made materials to camouflage yourself, your equipment, and 
your position. 
8.2.1.1.  Cover. Cover gives protection from bullets, fragments, and some CBRN agents. 
Natural or man-made cover can also conceal you from enemy observation. Natural cover 
includes things such as logs, trees, stumps, ravines, and hollows (Figure 8.2). Man-made 
cover includes such things as fighting positions, trenches, walls, rubble, and craters. 
When in a defensive posture, a fighting position is normally constructed using natural 
cover from the surrounding terrain. To get protection from enemy fire when moving, use 
routes that put cover between you and the places where the enemy is known or thought to 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  87  
be. Use ravines, gullies, hills, wooded areas, and walls to keep the enemy from seeing 
and firing at you. Avoid open areas, and do not skyline yourself on hilltops and ridges. 
Figure 8.2.  Natural Cover Provides Hasty Protection From the Enemy. 
 
8.2.1.2.  Concealment. Concealment is anything that hides you from enemy observation; 
however, it does not protect you from enemy fire. Similar to cover, concealment can be 
natural or man-made. Natural concealment includes items such as bushes, trees, grass, 
and shadows. Man-made concealment includes airman battle uniforms, camouflage nets, 
face paint, and natural material that have been moved from its original location. To be 
effective, man-made concealment must blend into the natural concealment offered by the 
terrain. Contributing to concealment are three other factors that should be considered—
light discipline, noise discipline, and movement discipline. 
8.2.1.2.1.  Light discipline is controlling the use of lights at night such as not smoking 
in the open, not walking around with a flashlight on, not using vehicle headlights, and 
using vehicles’ blackout capability, if equipped. 
8.2.1.2.2.  Noise discipline is taking action to deflect sounds generated by your unit 
(such as operating equipment) away from the enemy and, when possible, using 
methods to communicate that do not generate sounds (arm and hand signals). 
8.2.1.2.3.  Movement discipline includes such things as not moving about fighting 
positions unless necessary and not moving on routes that lack cover and concealment. 
Movement draws attention. When you give arm and hand signals or walk about your 
position, your movement can be seen by the naked eye from long distances. When in 
a defensive posture, stay low and move only when necessary. If movement is 
necessary, do so only on covered and concealed routes. A note of caution darkness 
alone cannot hide you from enemy observation. Night vision devices will detect you 
in darkness. 
8.2.1.3.  Camouflage. Camouflage is anything used to keep yourself, your equipment, and 
your position from looking like what they are, e.g., breaking up outlines to blend in with 
your surroundings. Both natural and man-made material can be used for camouflage. 
When natural material is used, over time it will often die, fade, or otherwise lose its 
effectiveness and should be changed frequently. Likewise, man-made material may wear 
off or fade. When this happens, you and your equipment or position may no longer blend 
  88  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
with the surroundings making it easy for the enemy to spot. Some camouflage 
considerations include the following: 
8.2.1.3.1.  Shine. Shine may attract the enemy’s attention. In darkness, it may be a 
light such as a burning cigarette or flashlight. In daylight, it can be the reflection from 
a polished surface such as shiny mess gear, a worn helmet, a windshield, a watch 
crystal or even exposed skin. To reduce shine, cover your skin with clothing and face 
paint. Also, dull the surfaces of equipment and vehicles with paint, mud, or 
camouflage material. 
8.2.1.3.2.  Shape. Shape results from an object’s outline or form. The shape of a 
helmet and human body are easily distinguishable. Use camouflage and concealment 
to break up shapes and blend them with their surroundings. Be careful not to overdo 
camouflage and concealment techniques, it could create unnatural results, and draw 
unwanted attention to your location. 
8.2.1.3.3.  Colors. Colors can also be a “dead giveaway.” The colors of your skin, 
uniform, and equipment may help the enemy detect you if they contrast with the 
background. For example, a green uniform will contrast with snow-covered terrain. 
Camouflage yourself and your equipment to blend with the surroundings (Figure 
8.3). 
Figure 8.3.  Effective Personal Camouflage Blends With Surrounding Terrain 
 
8.2.1.3.4.  Dispersion. Dispersion is the spreading of personnel, vehicles, and 
equipment over a wide area. It is usually easier for the enemy to detect individuals 
when they are bunched—so, spread out. The distance between you and another 
person will vary with the terrain, degree of visibility, and enemy situation. 
8.2.2.  Individual Movement Preparations and Precautions.  Use the following individual 
movement preparations and precautions prior to and during an encounter with an enemy 
force: 
8.2.2.1.  Camouflage yourself and your equipment. 
8.2.2.2.  Wear soft, well-fitting clothes. 
8.2.2.3.  Exercise good noise discipline. Methods include: 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  89  
8.2.2.3.1.  Tape your dog tags together and to the chain so they cannot slide or rattle 
8.2.2.3.2.  Tape or pad the parts of your weapon and equipment that rattle or are so 
loose that they may snag (the tape or padding must not interfere with the operation of 
the weapon or equipment) 
8.2.2.3.3.  After finished taping, test for noise by shaking 
8.2.2.4.  Do not carry unnecessary equipment. Move from cover position to cover 
position (taking no longer than 3 to 5 seconds between positions). 
8.2.2.5.  Stop, look, and listen before moving. Look for the next position before leaving a 
position. 
8.2.2.6.  Look for covered and concealed routes on which to move. 
8.2.2.7.  Change directions slightly from time to time when moving through tall grass. 
8.2.2.8.  Cross roads and trails at places that have the most cover and concealment (large 
culverts, low spots, curves, or bridges). 
8.2.2.9.  Avoid steep slopes and places with loose dirt or stones. 
8.2.2.10.  Avoid cleared, open areas and tops of hills and ridges. 
8.2.2.11.  If you alarm birds or animals, remain in position and observe briefly. 
8.2.2.12.  Take advantage of distractions provided by noise. 
8.2.3.  Individual Movement Methods.  In addition to walking, four other movement 
methods may be utilized—low crawl, high crawl, rush, and spider crawl. Bear in mind, these 
movement methods are meant to be used to keep you out of enemy contact, allow you to 
reach a covered, concealed position, or withdraw from an area safely. There is no intent to 
have engineer personnel move toward an enemy force for the purpose of offensive 
maneuvers or actions. 
8.2.3.1.  Low Crawl. The low crawl (Figure 8.4) provides the lowest silhouette. Use it to 
cross places where the concealment is very low and enemy fire or observation prevents 
you from rising from the prone position. Keep your body flat against the ground. With 
your firing hand, grasp your weapon sling at the upper sling swivel. Let the front hand-
guard rest on your forearm (keeping the muzzle off the ground), and let the weapon butt 
drag on the ground. To move, push your arms forward and pull your firing side leg 
forward. Then pull with your arms and push with your leg. Continue this action 
throughout the move. 
  90  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
Figure 8.4.  Low Crawl Provides the Lowest Silhouette 
 
8.2.3.2.  High Crawl. The high crawl (Figure 8.5) lets you move faster than the low crawl 
and still give you a low silhouette. Use this crawl when there is good concealment but 
enemy fire prevents you from moving in an upright posture. Keep your body off the 
ground and resting on your forearms and lower legs. Cradle your weapon in your arms 
and keep its muzzle off the ground. Keep your knees well behind your buttocks so your 
body will stay low. To move, alternately advance your right elbow and left knee, then 
your left elbow and right knee. 
Figure 8.5.  High Crawl Permits Faster Movement and Low Silhouette 
 
8.2.3.3.  Short Rush. The short rush is the fastest way to move from one position to 
another. Each rush should last from 3 to 5 seconds. Rushes are kept short to keep enemy 
machine gunners or riflemen from tracking you. However, do not stop and hit the ground 
in the open just because 5 seconds have passed. Always try to hit the ground behind 
cover. Before moving, pick out your next cover and concealed position and the best route 
to it. Make your move from the prone position as explained in Table 8.1 and illustrated in 
Figure 8.6. 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015

8.2.3.4.  Spider Crawl. At times, it may become necessary to descend to the ground 
quickly from an elevated position or to move over an obstacle. To jump to the ground 
may cause injury due to unfamiliarity with the terrain or height of the obstacle. The 
“spider crawl” is used in these circumstances to avoid injury and to reduce your 
silhouette while going over an object. Perform the “spider crawl” as explained in Table 
8.2 and illustrated in Figure 8.7. 
  92  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
Table 8.2.  The “Spider Crawl” Technique 
Spider Crawl 
1 As you move along the obstacle or structure, you must maintain a low profile to reduce the 
silhouette; place your weapon in your lead hand 
2 Your leading hand and foot are extended over the edge of the obstacle in a “spread eagle” 
position while your trailing hand and foot is pressed firmly against the top of the obstacle 
3 Your lead hand and foot are slowly extended down the vertical face of the obstacle until 
only your trail hand and foot is on the top 
4 Your trail foot is released, closely followed by your trail hand using your lead hand as a 
pivot to control the drop 
5 
You should land on the balls of your feet, with your legs spread approximately shoulders 
width; your knees should be flexed and your body should be in a slightly crouched position 
hugging the obstacle 
6 
The “spider crawl” should be practiced for both right-handed, as well as left-handed 
descent; the placement of your lead hand will determine which direction you will be facing 
once you hit the ground 
Figure 8.7.  “Spider Crawl” Movement 
 
8.2.4.  Team or Small Group Movements.  For those occasions when engineer personnel 
have to move into an unsecured or potentially hostile area remote from the main installation 
or at a location off the installation, small group movement techniques may be necessary. In 
such situations, organizing personnel into fire team formations may provide the best defense. 
See Field Manual (FM) 3-21.8, The Infantry Rifle Platoon and Squad, for additional 
information. Fire teams normally consist of four-man groups. Each team member is 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  93  
identified by number (1, 2, 3, and 4). Note: For our purposes, all members are riflemen with 
the number four man being the team leader. 
8.2.4.1.  The wedge (Figure 8.8) is the basic formation for a fire team. The interval 
between personnel is normally 10 meters (approx. 33 feet). The wedge expands and 
contracts depending on the terrain. When rough terrain, poor visibility, or other factors 
make control of the wedge difficult, fire teams modify the wedge. The sides of the wedge 
can contract to the point where the wedge resembles a single file formation (Figure 8.9). 
When moving in less rugged terrain, where control is easier, personnel expand or resume 
their original positions. 
Figure 8.8.  Right and Left Wedge Formations 
 
Figure 8.9.  File Formation 
 
8.2.4.2.  If two or more fire teams are to be traveling together, the wedge or file 
formations are used (Figure 8.10). Usually an element leader is also present. A 20-meter 
(approx. 66 feet) separation between the element leader and the second fire team is 
normally maintained if contact with an enemy force is not likely. 
  94  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
Figure 8.10.  Two Fire Teams in Wedge and File Formations 
 
8.2.4.3.  If contact with an enemy force is possible, however, the formation is altered 
somewhat. The element leader and the second fire team fall back to a 50-meter (approx. 
164 feet) separation from the lead fire team (Figure 8.11). This formation is called 
traveling overwatch. 
Figure 8.11.  Two Fire Team Traveling Overwatch Formation 
 
8.2.4.4.  If fired upon during movement, Figure 8.12 and Figure 8.13 illustrate the 
pivoting techniques used for positioning a wedge formation to respond to attacks from 
the flanks.

8.3.  Convoy Security.  Convoys have historically been targets of choice for enemy ambush; 
therefore, defensive tactics do become an item of keen concern. Admittedly, if dedicated air 
cover is available, the possibility of ambush is markedly reduced—but even then not entirely 
eliminated. In today’s expeditionary battlefield environment, dedicated air cover does not negate 
the deadly effectiveness of an enemy’s use of IEDs or VBIEDs to disrupt convoys. These threats 
make it essential to utilize and practice current, battlefield-tested convoy defensive tactics—it 
can mean the difference between success and failure. Moving personnel and equipment from one 
place to another is a necessity in most peacetime and wartime military operations. Troops and 
goods must get to the right place, at the right time, and arrive in good condition. Frequently, road 
travel in the form of a convoy is the most desirable method of movement. As can be expected, 
convoys are always organized for a specific purpose and according to a specific plan. However, 
the general approach to convoy use during peace and war is somewhat different. 
8.3.1.  Peacetime Operations.  During times of peace, convoys serve as an efficient way to 
control the movement of items in mass from one point to another. Logically, in this situation 
little regard is given to defensive tactics. Things such as keeping the convoy intact, under 
positive control, and on schedule are at the forefront of concern. 
  96  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
8.3.2.  Wartime Operations.  During periods of conflict, the convoy continues to be an 
efficient way to move items (Figure 8.14). Common AF applications may include 
transporting items from installations to airports of embarkation and moving WRM from 
prepositioned sites within a theater to an installation of intended use. Probably a less 
common use, the convoy may be the logical way to move resources and personnel as part of 
a base denial effort. Additionally, AF personnel often participate in convoy operations with 
other services. Regardless of the reason for the convoy movement, wartime military 
operations expose our convoys to increasing types of threats, including roadside improvised 
explosive devices (IEDs), vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), small arms 
fire, rocket propelled grenades, sniper attacks, ambushes, and other threats. In this type of 
threat environment, convoy operations are virtually synonymous with combat operations. 
Therefore, personnel assigned to convoy duty must be able to respond appropriately to these 
threats. Refer to AFTTP 3-2.58, Tactical Convoy Operations, for specific information on 
convoy tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). In addition, a review of current AF lessons 
learned at https://www.jllis.mil/apps/ may provide up-to-date information on convoy 
procedures in ongoing expeditionary operations.

8.4.  Work Site Entry.  Arrival at a work site can cause a letdown in security consciousness 
since travel has finally been completed. This should not be allowed to happen since an enemy 
force could be waiting at the work site area just for such a situation. If the work site is not 
familiar or is known to be in an area that could be frequented by enemy forces, a clearly defined 
plan should be followed for ensuring access to the area is relatively safe. Although there may be 
other options to accomplish this, one method uses three fire teams from the convoy procession to 
perform an area sweep. The convoy stops short of the work site and convoy personnel dismounts 
and establishes a 360-degree security cordon around the convoy vehicles IAW “short halt” 
dismount procedures in AFTTP 3-2.58. The three fire teams approach the work site in file 
formation. Fire team A secures the entry road on the left and fire team C secures the right side of 
the road. Fire team B enters the work site in wedge formation and walks (sweeps) the site to its 
forward edge (Figure 8.15). When the sweep is completed, fire team A enters the work site and 
expands to the left. Fire team C then enters the site and expand to the right. Fire team B returns 
from the forward edge of the work site perimeter and joins with team A and C forming a 360-
degree secure area. The remainder of the convoy personnel then remounts their vehicles and 
quickly enters the work site (Figure 8.16). From this point, the commander/leader of the work 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  97  
party has two tasks to perform—establish work party security measures and accomplish the work 
task itself. 
Figure 8.15.  Work Site Sweep 
 
Figure 8.16.  Work Site Entry. 
 
8.5.  Work Party Security.  Work party security is typically provided by two or three 
individuals posted on the perimeter of the work area to provide early warning of any impending 
hostile action. If the work party is fired upon, these individuals will determine the direction of 
fire; estimate the type, size, and apparent intent of the hostile force; direct the work party to take 
defensive cover, and call BDOC for SF assistance. Defensive cover, as used in this context, 
means the occupation of either hasty or deliberate (prepared in advance) defensive fighting 
positions that take maximum advantage of the terrain at or in the vicinity. 
8.5.1.  Defense Sectors.  Upon arriving at a work site, establishing proper security requires 
more than just posting guards at random locations. To best defend the entire work site, 
defense sectors should be established. This task requires several actions to be taken. The first 
  98  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
action is to establish the exact boundary of the work site. Once this is done, the work party 
leader/commander and personnel who will be serving as sector commanders walk the 
perimeter of the work site and establish sector boundaries. Normally the number of sectors is 
kept between three and five and they need not be all the same size. The size of the sector will 
depend on the terrain and what resources are within the sector. The important thing to ensure 
when setting up sectors is that the boundaries between sectors are well defined. This allows 
personnel defending a sector to know exactly where their terrain defense responsibilities start 
and end. Refer to AFH 31-109, Integrated Defense in Expeditionary Environments, for 
information on fire control measures and setting up sectors of fire. Once sector locations and 
boundaries are determined, sector commanders site fighting positions in locations that have 
clear lines of fire toward the work area perimeter. These positions should be at least the 
equivalent of a hasty fighting position. If the work site will be occupied continuously for 
several days or longer, consideration should be given to constructing deliberate positions. 
Manning of the sector fighting positions should be by pre-established fire teams if possible—
this maintains team integrity and pre-identifies a leader “in the trenches.” 
8.5.2.  Listening Posts.  The purpose of going to a work site is to perform an engineer 
construction task of some sort. Security, while obviously important, cannot be allowed to 
consume most of your resources all the time. Normally, a small number of troops are placed 
on security duty while the remainder performs the engineering task. These security troops 
will not be sufficient to man all the fighting positions, but a “trip wire” system of listening 
posts can be used. These listening posts are positioned outside the work site perimeter but 
close enough to allow individuals to return quickly (Figure 8.17). If an enemy force is 
encountered, the troops manning the listening posts bring the information back to the work 
site, construction work is ceased, fighting positions are manned, and SF support is 
immediately requested. 
Figure 8.17.  Sectors, Fighting Positions, and Listening Posts 
 
8.5.3.  Fighting Position Construction.  When providing defense, personnel need cover 
from fire and concealment from observation. Cover and concealment are best provided by 
some type of fighting position. This may be an existing hole, a hastily dug prone shelter, or a 
well-prepared position with overhead cover. The time available for preparation determines 
how well you build your position. The basic requirements of a fighting position are that it 
must allow you to fire and protect you from observation and direct and indirect fire. For 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  99  
detailed information on the construction of defensive fighting positions, refer to AFH 10-222, 
Volume 14, Civil Engineer Guide to Fighting Positions, Shelters, Obstacles, and Revetments, 
and Graphic Training Aid (GTA) 90-01-011, Joint Forward Operations Base (JFOB) Force 
Protection Handbook, Sixth Edition (FOUO). 
8.5.4.  Recognition Code Systems.  A system of constantly changing passwords, number 
codes, and duress words is an essential part of the security of any military activity during 
periods of conflict. Code systems afford guards a quick means of identifying both friendly 
and enemy personnel, even when restrictions prevent visual confirmation. In addition, codes 
can be used as a spontaneous alerting signal. 
8.5.4.1.  Passwords. These codes aid a sentry by helping to prevent unauthorized persons 
from infiltrating the work area perimeter. Passwords are normally given in two parts and 
changed daily, usually at 1200 hours. They take the form of a challenge (e.g., Papa 
November) and a counter sign (e.g., Papa Tango). The use of letters from the phonetic 
alphabet as challenges and counter signs is an agreed North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) procedure and may be used when forces of two or more nations are in the same 
formation. 
8.5.4.2.  Number Codes. Number codes are often used in place of passwords. They are 
normally less than 20 to make response easier and faster. For example if the number code 
is 15, a challenge could be 9 with a counter sign of the number 6. The challenge and 
counter sign may be spoken, written, or transmitted visually using hand signals. You may 
want to avoid using numbers that are half the challenge number because an enemy could 
simply mimic your gesture or number and be accurate. 
8.5.4.3.  Duress Words. A duress word is one word used to alert a friendly listener that 
the transmitting party is in duress. When selecting and using such a code, consider the 
following: 
8.5.4.3.1.  Select a word that is not subject to routine use yet is also not exotic. The 
words chow and serendipitous are either too commonplace or exotic to be effective, 
whereas, the words boot or belt may well prove effective. 
8.5.4.3.2.  Use the word in casual dialog so it is not obvious; this allows the listener to 
take action without alerting the enemy. 
8.5.5.  Radio Communication.  Radios are the most frequently used means of 
communication. They are particularly suited for use when you are on the move and need a 
means of maintaining C2. Small handheld or backpacked radios that communicate for short 
distances are ideal for small unit use. As the need grows to talk over longer distances and to 
more units, the size and complexity of radios increase. To put radios to good use, first look at 
some of the things that affect radio communications. 
8.5.5.1.  To communicate with each other, radios must have a common frequency. They 
must also be able to transmit and receive the same type of signal. Most Prime BEEF 
radios are frequency modulation (FM) and will not communicate with amplitude 
modulation (AM) radios. Squelch settings on radios must also be set correctly. 
8.5.5.2.  Factors that affect the range of radio equipment are weather, terrain, antenna, 
power, and the location of the unit itself. Trying to communicate near man-made objects 
  100  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
such as bridges and buildings may also affect radio transmissions. Interference in the 
form of static often occurs when you use radios near power lines or electrical generators. 
Interference may also come from other radio stations, bad weather, or enemy jamming. 
Many of the things that cause poor radio communications can be corrected by using 
common sense. Such things as making sure that you are not trying to broadcast from 
under a steel bridge or near generators and power lines, using the best available antenna, 
and selecting the proper site will help ensure more reliable communications. 
8.5.5.3.  Using COMSEC denies or delays unauthorized personnel from gaining 
information of value from telecommunications. Below are some common COMSEC 
practices: 
8.5.5.3.1.  Use authentication to ensure the other communications station is a friendly 
one 
8.5.5.3.2.  Designate periods when all radio equipment is to be turned off 
8.5.5.3.3.  Restrict the use of radio transmitters (monitoring radio receivers/listening 
silence) 
8.5.5.3.4.  Enforce net discipline and radio procedures 
8.5.5.3.5.  Use proper site selection, minimum power, and minimum transmission 
times 
8.5.5.3.6.  Use directional antennas when possible 
8.5.6.  Visual Communications.  Radio jamming enhancements are causing more emphasis 
to be placed on visual communication for C2. Visual signals include arm and hand signals, 
pyrotechnics, smoke, flashing lights, and panel markers. Obviously, the effectiveness of any 
signal will depend upon a set of prearranged meanings. Assign prearranged meanings to 
visual signals for both senders and receivers so both have the same understanding of what a 
particular signal means. Generally, a listing of prearranged messages using these signals is 
included in a unit’s operating instructions. Visual signals, however, have some shortcomings 
that limit their use. For example, visual signals can be easily misunderstood, limited by poor 
visibility such as night or in dense terrain, and can be intercepted by the enemy and reused to 
create confusion. 
8.5.7.  Sound Communications.  Sound signals, like visual signals, depend upon a set of 
prearranged meanings. Sound signals include the use of the voice, whistles, horns, weapons, 
and other noise-making devices to transmit simple messages over short distances. In addition, 
like visual signals, sound signals are vulnerable to enemy interception and use and 
susceptible to misinterpretation. Their best application is as installation C2 warning alarms. 
The prearranged meanings for sound signals are usually established by local commanders 
and are listed in the unit operating instructions. 
8.5.8.  Wire Communications.  Wire communication will not often be used during a work 
party undertaking. However, since it does have an application with other Prime BEEF 
activities such as beddown, it will be briefly addressed here. Wire is another type of 
communication used during ground operations. Although installing a wire network takes 
more time than installing a radio, wire lines are usually more secure. In general, a wire 
network gives better communication because it is less subject to interference from weather, 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  101  
terrain, and man-made obstacles. Wire lines also protect you from enemy electronic warfare 
actions such as jamming. However, wire lines are subject to breakage by vehicular traffic or 
enemy offensive action—a major drawback. 
8.5.9.  Messenger Communications.  Unlike other field communications, messengers are a 
means of transmitting large and bulky items such as maps and documents as well as oral and 
written correspondence. Messengers are the most secure means of communications, but there 
are also negative aspects with using messengers. Specifically, they are subject to enemy 
action, require more time than radio or wire communications, and do not afford “real time” 
writer-to reader exchanges. If messengers are used routinely, do not forget to vary their 
movement schedules and routes periodically. 
8.5.10.  Weapons Accountability.  Firearms are prone to theft. Certain military-unique 
types, because of their great casualty potential and their non-availability in commercial 
markets, are particularly susceptible. Recognizing this, the DOD has established precise and 
exacting standards for protecting firearms against pilferage. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, 
outlines requirements for protecting firearms. 
8.5.10.1.  Protection Philosophy. All commanders and supervisors must give continuing 
special attention and emphasis to protecting firearms. Weapons must only be removed 
from a designated storage area for as short a time as possible and in as small a quantity as 
is needed to support specific missions or projects. Other requirements include: 
8.5.10.1.1.  Only government-owned facilities will be used to store government-
owned firearms. 
8.5.10.1.2.  The SF chief provides staff supervision over the firearms protection 
program IAW AFI 31-101. 
8.5.10.1.3.  All firearms must be continuously attended or guarded when they are 
removed from approved storage areas. Persons issued or in the possession of arms, 
ammunition, and explosives are responsible for protecting their items while entrusted 
with their care. They must make sure that all items are under positive control at all 
times. 
8.5.10.1.4.  Mobility weapons in storage should be placed in containers configured 
and clearly identified by a Prime BEEF team to allow ease of issuance. Be sure 
proper numbers of supplementary items such as cleaning kits and holsters are 
appropriately packed with the weapons. When weapons are in transit, stored in depots 
or warehouses, or held for contingencies, the containers must be banded or locked 
and sealed. 
8.5.11.  Protecting 
Firearms 
off 
the 
Military 
Installation 
or 
Under 
Field 
Conditions.  When deployed in the field for actual or exercise purposes, firearms must be 
under continuous positive control. Depending on the threat situation in the immediate area, 
commanders may elect to consolidate firearms in a central location to make surveillance 
easier. Weapons are never left unattended or unsecured. Personnel charged with custody of 
stored weapons should be armed and must have the capability to sound an alarm if a forceful 
theft is attempted. An armed response force must be established with the capability of 
responding within a reasonable time (normally 15 minutes). When traveling off the 
installation with weapons during deployments (ground transport in secure area) or when 
  102  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
obtaining commercial air transportation, weapons must be placed in locked, banded, or 
sealed containers. Ammunition will be placed in containers in accordance with shipping or 
security regulations, follow Transportation Security Administration or United States 
Transportation Command guidance for proper shipping or labeling of firearms and 
munitions. AFI 31-101 outlines requirements for protecting firearms under field conditions. 
8.6.  Augmentation of the Base Defense Force.  As outlined in AFI 31-101, “Effects-based 
integrated defense (ID) is a fundamental battle competency for all Airmen, regardless of 
location, and requires active participation by all to ensure success.” The degree of participation 
by base units and personnel is usually predetermined in the ID plan (IDP). Normally, CE forces 
will be assigned to protect an engineer resource (owner/user security) or augment SF in a 
specific sector. When performing in the base defense mode on AF installations, CE personnel 
will typically be under tactical control (TACON) of the SF Commander or Defense Force 
Commander (DFC). Detailed procedures for engineer units supporting ID efforts should be 
prepared and included in the CE CRP. See AFH 31-109, Integrated Defense in Expeditionary 
Environments, and AFPAM 10-219, Volume 2, for specific base defense preparations and ID 
measures. 
8.7.  Owner/User Security Procedures.  CE unit owner/user security procedures are an integral 
part of base defense. Unit ID efforts should integrate with installation ID operations. Owner/user 
security involves using a unit’s own resources to protect its essential facilities and equipment 
assets. Good pre-planning and training are necessary to ensure engineer response to a threat to 
base security is timely and organized. When initiating owner/user security measures, personnel 
should be informed of exactly where to report and what to do. An officer should be placed in 
charge of engineer fire teams and maintain constant contact with SF representatives. Shifts 
should be established and supervisory personnel should make checks on all manned positions at 
least hourly. Plan to staff all defensive positions with two personnel each and provide all 
personnel staffing these positions with the following minimum information. 
8.7.1.  Location of shift leader and how to make contact 
8.7.2.  Expected/probable direction of enemy attack or infiltration 
8.7.3.  Area of responsibility, i.e., what ground to watch over 
8.7.4.  Location of adjacent posts 
8.7.5.  Location of listening posts if forward of defensive position 
8.7.6.  Location of friendly forces forward of defensive position if any 
8.7.7.  Procedure for challenging (work closely with SF on rules of engagement and 
techniques) 
8.7.8.  Password and password change times (coordinate with SF on use of recognition 
codes) 
8.7.9.  Shift change times and procedures

BASE DENIAL PROCEDURES 
9.1.  General Information.  Base denial measures are intended to prevent or obstruct enemy use 
of installation facilities, systems, equipment, and resources. It may involve the functional 
destruction of certain base infrastructure and equipment, evacuation and contamination of 
resources, and the destruction of residual supplies. Generally, base denial is an overseas theater 
task and is implemented when the theater commander directs base evacuation and the follow-on 
destruction of selected air base systems, military equipment, and supplies. The priorities and 
extent of asset denial is decided by the theater commander, taking into account any potential 
value to the enemy. 
9.2.  General Responsibilities.  Once the order is given, the denial of military equipment and 
supplies is the responsibility of the user. Denial of the air base infrastructure, in large part, will 
be a CE responsibility. While the need to implement base denial actions may be rare, everyone 
involved in base denial must know what his or her responsibilities might be and common 
methods that can be used to physically accomplish their specific base denial task. Normally, not 
everyone in an organization will play a role in base denial. In fact, the vast majority of the base 
population will usually be directed to evacuate before consequential denial actions commence. 
However, if time permits, base denial activities can be expanded to include a large percentage of 
the base population, but such situations would be the exception rather than the norm. 
Realistically, only a very limited number of personnel, those assigned and trained as members of 
the base denial team, will remain behind to perform this vital role. A good rule of thumb to 
follow when determining denial target responsibilities is to use the same areas of responsibility 
that exist under peacetime operations. In other words, if you are required to maintain or operate it 
during peacetime, expect to be the one responsible for denying it to an enemy during wartime. 
9.3.  Base Denial Team.  The actual size and composition of the denial team will be dictated by 
a number of factors such as the amount of resources identified for destruction, types of items to 
be destroyed, and the methods of destruction to be employed. Many base denial team 
assignments will be dictated by AFS. For example, it only makes sense to have CE electrical 
personnel accomplish base denial actions on electrical systems since they are, as a matter of 
course, the ones who are intimately familiar with what type of action will best incapacitate the 
system. The same would also apply to HVAC personnel, heavy equipment operators, WFSM 
personnel, and FES personnel. Since CE personnel implement most infrastructure denial actions, 
they will likely be a significant portion of the base denial team. 
9.4.  CE Activities for Base Denial.  Time is usually very short once the order for emergency 
evacuation and base denial is received. Our CE forces must understand their role and be prepared 
to carry out denial operations by both explosive and non-explosive methods. As addressed in 
AFPAM 10-219, Volume 2, there are four conventional methods to accomplish base denial: 
evacuation, component removal, destruction, and the use of obstacles. Each method may have a 
place in the overall base denial scenario and planners should select methods that produce the 
desired results with the least amount of effort. The following paragraphs address some of the 
more substantial CE-specific base denial responsibilities and measures. 
  104  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
9.4.1.  Airfield 
Pavement, 
Railways, 
Drainage 
Systems, 
and 
Support 
Equipment.  Pavements and construction equipment personnel will be accountable for 
roadway, railway, drainage system, and airfield denial. Airfield pavements denial most often 
will be brought about using a combination of obstacles and explosives. However, to a large 
degree, the method employed and the extent of damage inflicted will be dictated by how soon 
and even if we can anticipate regaining physical control of the property. If it is not 
unreasonable to expect to lose control of the assets for only a short period and enemy use of 
the airfield during that time will be insignificant to the total battle effort, it may be 
counterproductive to extensively damage the airfield surfaces. The final decision to seriously 
deny use of airfield pavements will be made at senior command levels, and the BCE verifies 
the scope of pavement denial requirements before issuing orders to commence denial 
operations. Methods for performing denial of pavements, railways, drainage systems, and 
supporting equipment can take several forms. Below are examples of techniques that can be 
applied, singularly or in combination, to effect denial actions: 
9.4.1.1.  Use destroyed vehicles and aircraft, concrete blocks, or any kind of material that 
is readily available to create obstacles on the runway. 
9.4.1.2.  Fill 55-gallon barrels with concrete and place in the aircraft landing area/runway. 
9.4.1.3.  If the airfield has asphalt overlay, saturate selected areas with fuel to severely 
damage the surface area. 
9.4.1.4.  Use heavy equipment such as bulldozers and pavement breakers to scar the 
surface of airfield pavements and damage pavements at intersections and choke points. 
9.4.1.5.  Place destroyed NAVAIDS, distance-to-go markers, and towers on the runway 
surface. 
9.4.1.6.  Block open drainage ditches with rubble, debris, and ADR fill material to cause 
flooding conditions. 
9.4.1.7.  Use cement to block major drain areas and break primary drainage piping, 
particularly in those locations that would cause major airfield flooding. 
9.4.1.8.  Destroy fiberglass and metal ADR matting by driving over it with a bulldozer 
until severe deformity occurs. Place this damaged ADR matting on the airfield surfaces. 
Destroy any ADR component kits in the same manner. 
9.4.1.9.  Weave barbed tape/concertina wire around any obstacles placed on pavement 
surfaces. 
9.4.1.10.  Rip up railroad spurs with heavy equipment, burn crossties, and bend rails. 
However, be careful with timing, because rail movement could be used as a means of 
personnel and equipment evacuation. 
9.4.1.11.  Destroy and abandon on airfield surfaces any equipment not being evacuated 
by draining the oil and running the equipment. 
9.4.2.  Electrical Systems and Power Production.  Personnel in the electrical systems AFS 
will be responsible for destruction of the base power grid and its associated support 
complexes. This will normally include primary and secondary distribution systems, major 
transformer substations, and airfield lighting systems. In addition, power production 
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
  105  
individuals will be responsible for denial activities involving prime power plants, portable 
generators, and aircraft arresting systems. Methods for physically accomplishing denial of 
electrical systems are relatively straight forward. Use sledge hammers to destroy regulators, 
transformers, insulators, gauges, and shop equipment. Use chain saws to cut utility poles and 
barrier tapes. Vehicles and heavy equipment can be used to pull over towers (e.g., 
communications, radar, and approach control) and destroy arresting barrier facilities. 
Generators and arresting barrier units can be destroyed by draining engine oil as the units are 
running. Lastly, key items in bench stocks, special levels, and WRM can be destroyed using 
some of the same methods as above. 
9.4.3.  Mechanical Systems.  HVAC personnel will be responsible for disabling all critical 
base mechanical systems. At some theater locations, this may also include cold storage and 
ice plant facilities. WFSM personnel should take necessary steps to deny the use of both their 
system and product. The actual physical destruction of the pipeline itself may not be the 
easiest and most effective way of denying this crucial asset to an enemy. Instead, efforts 
should concentrate on contamination of bulk storage supplies and the destruction of key 
distribution system control components such as automatic valves and pumps. Denial of 
mechanical systems is most easily done by physically destroying the components. Use sledge 
hammers to break coils, motors, condensers, pumps, gauges, heaters, cooling units, automatic 
valves, and system control devices. Use cutting torches to destroy boiler units, heavy metal, 
and spare parts. Contaminate bulk fuel storage facilities by adding water, used oil, or similar 
substances to the fuel supplies. Due to the extreme hazard posed by some liquid fuels, 
draining the fuel out of the storage tanks is not recommended. However, burning of tank 
farms upon evacuation from the installation is a viable denial method. 
9.4.4.  Structures and Utilities.  Structures and utility systems personnel have the primary 
responsibility of destroying buildings and the water and sewage distribution systems. 
Structures individuals should obtain technical assistance from fire fighting personnel in 
burning facilities and any other bulk materials such as lumber and paint supplies. They 
should also use their skills with cutting torches to damage metal support structures like 
bridges and aircraft shelter door rail systems. WFSM personnel should direct their efforts 
toward disabling both the potable water and sewage distribution systems. Some of the key 
areas to concentrate on here include deep well pumps, pumping stations; storage tanks, 
chlorination equipment, and sewage lift stations. Numerous methods of denying facilities and 
supporting utility systems are available. Some of the more useful ones include the following: 
9.4.4.1.  Collapse facilities by using vehicles and cables to remove load-bearing 
members. 
9.4.4.2.  Use cutting torches to cut out supporting beams to buildings such as warehouses, 
aircraft hangars, and maintenance areas. 
9.4.4.3.  Use sledge hammers/jack hammers to breakup bricks, concrete block, and 
concrete walls. 
9.4.4.4.  Place debris in major drain areas to cause facility flooding. 
9.4.4.5.  Set fire to facilities that are constructed from easily burned materials. 
9.4.4.6.  Flood facilities that have belowground utility rooms and basements or are 
underground. 
  106  
AFPAM10-219V3  7 MAY 2015 
9.4.4.7.  Use sledge hammers to break up pumps, motors, and main water lines within 
pump houses and water plants. 
9.4.4.8.  Destroy fire hydrants using heavy construction equipment. 
9.4.4.9.  Drain and puncture water storage facilities. 
9.4.4.10.  Use cutting torches to cut supporting members of elevated water towers. 
9.4.4.11.  Pour cement and debris into main sewage lines and manholes. 
9.4.4.12.  Cut up, burn, or otherwise destroy shop stocks and construction materials. 
9.4.5.  Fire Demolition.  FES personnel will be looked upon to provide technical assistance 
during base denial activities primarily with respect to burning of base facilities and supplies. 
They should also expect to assist in flooding of any base facilities, if necessary. FES vehicles 
should be included as part of the evacuation contingent and should be loaded with as much 
fire fighting equipment as possible. Any vehicles left behind should be stripped of parts and 
components, and any fire fighting supplies that will not be taken should normally be 
destroyed. 
9.4.6.  Explosive Demolition.  Except in extreme cases, traditional engineer crafts personnel 
will not actively conduct explosive demolition. The task falls within the scope of 
responsibility of EOD personnel and RED HORSE Squadron (RHS) demolition teams. Some 
engineer forces, particularly construction equipment operators, can expect to be tasked to 
support EOD operations if earthwork, excavation, berming, etc., need to be accomplished as 
part of the demolition process. Major critical facilities and airfield pavements are the prime 
candidates for explosive demolition. Procedures for explosive demolition are contained in 
T.O. 11A-1-66, General Instructions, Demolitions. 
9.4.7.  Regardless of specific responsibilities and techniques, effective implementation of any 
base denial activity requires a team effort. As has already been brought out, expect time to be 
very limited and the workload to be excessive. You must follow the priority listing; there is a 
distinct possibility that limited time or resources will not allow you to complete all desired 
tasks. Safety is no less important than during peacetime, even in this hectic environment. Just 
because haste is a prime consideration, do not become a casualty of carelessness. Always let 
common sense and good judgment prevail. Since accomplishing your mission may be a 
monumental undertaking, the bottom line is teamwork. Each team member must be totally 
capable—knowing what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. 
9.5.  Withdrawal and Evacuation.  The final phase of base denial involves withdrawal and 
evacuation of base denial team personnel and equipment. As explained in AFPAM 10-219, 
Volume 1, these activities are preplanned during the attack preparation phase of the contingency. 
9.5.1.  At the onset of base denial efforts, several key actions must be taken to ensure all 
personnel are aware of their responsibilities and requirements with respect to withdrawal and 
evacuation once physical base denial missions have been completed. As a minimum, all 
personnel must be informed of the following items: 
9.5.1.1.  Anticipated time available for base denial actions. 
9.5.1.2.  Assembly location(s) for departure convoys. 
9.5.1.3.  Convoy method (rail, vehicle, etc.).

9.5.1.4.  Personnel accountability procedures. 
9.5.1.5.  Preplanned withdrawal routes and end-point locations. 
9.5.1.6.  Personal gear requirements. 
9.5.2.  While physical base denial actions are ongoing, another group of individuals must be 
designated to prepare the departure convoy for movement. In all likelihood, this group will 
encompass personnel from several base organizations; however, you can plan on having 
many engineer personnel involved as well due to the unique nature of much of the engineer 
equipment that will be evacuated (e.g., fire vehicles, heavy equipment). These individuals are 
responsible for accomplishing the following tasks: 
9.5.2.1.  Gathering and loading supplies and materials to be evacuated on transport 
vehicles 
9.5.2.2.  Setting up the convoy Order of March 
9.5.2.3.  Fueling and servicing of convoy vehicles 
9.5.2.4.  Preparing route maps for convoy drivers 
9.5.2.5.  Gathering and checking communications equipment 
9.5.2.6.  Reconnoitering the route to be taken checking for obstacles, choke points, proper 
traffic signs, etc. 
9.5.2.7.  Coordinating with destination point personnel to ensure support for evacuating 
personnel. 
9.5.2.8.  Arranging for en route SF escort support if necessary 
9.5.3.  In summary, the destructive work associated with the execution of base denial 
procedures requires skill and resourcefulness. Since the employment of explosive demolition 
methods; a most effective means for destruction of denial targets, may not be possible for a 
variety of reasons (shortage of EOD personnel or explosives; numerous taskings in too short 
a time frame; requirements to conceal our intentions; etc.), highly effective conventional, 
non-explosive denial methods should be available for used by the CE organization. Once 
physical base denial actions have been accomplished, an orderly withdrawal and evacuation 
complete the base denial process.
