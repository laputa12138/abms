PURPOSE:  The Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-42 series of 
publications is the primary reference for medical support capability.  AFTTP 3-42.9 provides 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) Global Health 
Engagement (GHE), including the International Health Specialist (IHS) teams and the Defense 
Institute for Medical Operations (DIMO).  These capabilities function across the range of 
military operations (ROMO) from peacetime security cooperation to combat operations and 
stability operations.  This AFTTP provides strategic focus and tactical level guidance for GHE 
execution.  It also outlines the way ahead for the AFMS to synchronize GHE capabilities to 
support the Air Force Global Partnership Strategy (AFGPS) and contribute to building 
partnerships (BP).  This guidance is intended to help planners integrate the IHS Regional Health 
Specialist Team (unit type code [UTC] FFHSR) into military operations that may require 
interaction with US government agencies, including but not limited to other Department of 
Defense (DOD) services, Department of State (DOS), United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID), and United States Public Health Service (USPHS), or interactions with 
foreign or international military, government, or private agencies or organizations.  Refer 
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary 
Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.  Route 
AF 847 through the appropriate functional chain of command.  Ensure that all records created as 
a result of the processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) 
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air 
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule 
(RDS).  The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, 
commodity, or service in the publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force. 
 
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS:  This revision combines AFTTP 3-42.9 and AFFTP 3-42.91 and 
changes the title.  Chapter 1, Global Health Engagement, addresses the Air Force’s role in 
2          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
interfacing with international and host nation (HN) healthcare resources.  Chapter 2, 
International Health Specialist Teams, describes the mission, structure, and deployment of UTC 
FFHSR.  The content has been significantly updated and should be completely reviewed. 
 
APPLICATION:  This publication applies to all Air Force military and civilian personnel, 
including Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units and 
members supporting expeditionary ground medical (non-Special Operations Forces [SOF]) 
operations.  The doctrine in this document is authoritative but not directive.  
 
SCOPE:  Chapter 1 of this document defines GHE and describes how AFMS personnel interface 
with global health organizations throughout the full spectrum of operations.  It discusses the 
direction and processes required for successful assessment, planning, strategic communication, 
and execution of the international AFMS mission.  Chapter 2 provides the TTP for the IHS team.  
This AFTTP may be used as a guide for developing standardized policies, operating procedures, 
and training concepts.  Air Combat Command (ACC) is the Manpower and Equipment Force 
Packaging (MEFPAK) Responsible Agency (MRA) for expeditionary ground medical IHS 
packages.  (Note:  IHS SOF support is outside the scope of this AFTTP.  Air Force Special 
Operations Command [AFSOC] is the MRA for AFSOC/SOF IHS packages and develops 
operational planning concepts to support SOF operations.)

Chapter 1 
 
GLOBAL HEALTH ENGAGEMENT (GHE) 
 
Section 1A—Introduction 
 
1.1.  Purpose.  The health resources available to support military deployments are finite.  
Interfacing with international and host nation (HN) resources can greatly expand the military’s 
deployed health capabilities.  However, to be effective, the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) 
must know what international health resources are available and how to develop cooperation and 
collaboration.   
 
1.2.  Global Health Definition.  Global health takes into consideration all aspects that affect the 
biological, psychological, and social wellness of individuals and international populations.  It 
includes health systems, patient care, all health disciplines, economics of health, health 
governance, international policies and standards, and international law.  Stakeholders include but 
are not limited to the following:  
 
 Medical systems in the US such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (including the 
Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance [OFDA]), Department of State 
(DOS), United States Public Health Service (USPHS), and the other US military services 
 
 HN elements such as the ministries of health and defense and private and public health 
networks 
 
 Disaster relief (DR) networks (networks of governmental and non-governmental agencies 
and private entities that respond to local and international disasters), public health 
agencies, medical logistics, and transportation systems 
 
 Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) such as the World Health Organization (WHO), 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private voluntary organizations (PVOs), and 
international organizations (IOs) such as the International Federation of Red Cross and 
Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) 
 
1.3.  GHE Definition.  GHE enables the Air Force to partner with other nations to build partner 
capacity and support security cooperation.  Through health related activities and exchanges, 
GHE builds trust and confidence primarily between DOD medical services and partner nation 
(PN) armed forces and, less directly, with foreign civilian authorities or agencies.  This rapport 
facilitates information exchange, coordination of activities of mutual benefit, and enhanced 
interoperability.  GHE operates across the full spectrum of health capabilities in support of 
combatant commander (CCDR) end-state objectives (DODD 3000.07, Irregular Warfare, and 
AFI 44-162, International Health Specialist (IHS) Program).  
 
1.3.1.  Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).  M&E is fundamental in the planning, 
execution, and assessment of AFMS GHE.  Program planning must include appropriate 
6          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
measures that link actions to short and long-term CCDR objectives as well as positive and 
preferably enduring health outcomes for civilian and security sector partners.  See 
Attachment 3 for an M&E framework. 
 
1.3.2.  Strategic Communication.  Strategic communication is defined as focused United 
States Government (USG) efforts to understand and engage key audiences to create, 
strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of USG interests, policies, 
and objectives through the use of coordinated programs, plans, themes, messages, and 
products synchronized with the actions of all instruments of national power. (JP 5-0).  The 
AFMS GHE Strategic Communications Plan provides guidance and key messages under 
three main themes: (1) Prevent – focused on building partnerships;  (2) Protect – focused on 
enhancing partner capabilities; and (3) Respond – emphasizing the AFMS desire for 
interoperable function with coalition partners.  GHE should incorporate these broad themes 
as well as commander-specific strategic communication messages into the planning of every 
activity or mission. 
 
1.4.  GHE and Expeditionary Operations.  Today’s expeditionary force requires Airmen with 
international insight, foreign language proficiency, cultural understanding, and regional expertise 
– men and women with the right skill sets to shape conditions and rapidly respond to the full 
spectrum of global operations.  Essential capacities include health systems and public health 
knowledge, diplomacy skills, ability to cultivate personal and inter-organizational relationships 
within other cultures, and planning and programming supporting activities. 
 
1.4.1.  US Strategic End States. 
 
1.4.1.1.  Access and Influence.  Extend the operational reach of joint forces through 
health-related activities that open doors and foster the establishment of trusting 
relationships with the PN’s personnel. 
 
1.4.1.2.  Biosecurity.  Enhance PN capability for force health protection (FHP) and 
health services regarding the International Health Regulations (IHR), health surveillance, 
and pandemic preparedness and response.  Biosecurity activities help protect the health of 
our own forces and contribute to national and DOD strategies for countering biological 
threats. 
 
1.4.1.3.  Capability and Coalition Development.  Optimize PN airpower concepts 
(light, lean, and lifesaving) through exchanges and training on aeromedical evacuation 
(AE), expeditionary medical support (EMEDS), health services, humanitarian assistance, 
and disaster relief (HA/DR).  The long-term goal of these activities is interoperable 
medical support between the PN and US forces and its allies and development of a 
coalition of partners. 
 
1.4.2.  Health Security Cooperation.  These health operations include activities designed to 
prepare the strategic infrastructure during the pre-deployment phase and facilitate initial 
deployments in an area of responsibility (AOR).  This objective is achieved primarily by 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
7 
well-planned and well-synchronized GHE activities in support of the combatant command 
Theater Campaign Plan (TCP). 
 
1.4.3. Building Partnerships (BP).  BP emphasizes collaboration with foreign governments, 
militaries, populations, USG departments and agencies, public and private industry, IOs, and 
NGOs.  BP is a joint capability area (JCA).  It includes the sub-elements Communicate and 
Shape. 
 
1.4.3.1.  Communicate is the ability to develop and present information to current and 
desired allies, competitors, and adversary audiences to affect their perceptions, will, 
behavior, and capabilities to further US national security or shared global security 
interests.  It also refers to developing and presenting information to domestic audiences to 
improve understanding. 
 
1.4.3.2.  Shape refers to conducting activities to affect the perceptions, will, behavior, 
and capabilities of partner, competitor, or adversary leaders, military forces, and relevant 
populations to further US national security or shared global security interests. 
 
1.4.4.  Integrated and Interoperable Aerospace Medicine.  The AFMS needs to interface 
with global health systems and partners and include these concepts in every strategic plan for 
the operational theater.  The TCP must consider the level of interaction with the nations in 
the region and the level of sophistication of their healthcare systems.  When in doubt, 
consultation with regional experts, such as regional international health specialist (IHS) 
teams, can be beneficial. 
 
1.4.5.  Medical Stability Operations (MSO).  Stability operations encompass military 
missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the US in coordination with other 
instruments of national power to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment and 
provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and 
humanitarian relief.  MSO objectives could include the restoration of services such as water, 
sanitation, public health, and essential medical care.  The desired end state is an indigenous 
capacity of the HN to provide vital health services to its people.  In these types of operations, 
a civilian USG agency will typically serve as the lead.  However, US military forces should 
be prepared to lead the activities necessary to accomplish these tasks when indigenous civil, 
USG, multinational, or international capacity does not exist or is incapable of assuming 
responsibility.  Once legitimate civil authority is prepared to conduct these tasks, US military 
forces may support these activities as required or necessary. 
 
1.4.6.  Humanitarian Assistance (HA)/Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA).  HA 
and HCA activities are powerful and relatively inexpensive investments in building 
international relationships.  Mission plans consider the HN’s main concerns as prioritized by 
the US embassy country team and propose efficient solutions.  A medical HA or HCA 
mission typically requires a 3-5 year follow-up plan that includes future missions to 
document the lessons learned of previous missions. 
 
8          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
1.4.7.  Disaster Response and Preparedness.  The readiness training plan delineates a 
timely and effective response to the most likely catastrophic events in the CCDR’s 
geographical region.  The objective is to be ready to work with coalition partners in response 
to natural or man-made catastrophes, including terrorist acts and weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD) incidents.  US medical forces exchange information with coalition 
partners and HN and regional disaster response organizations through academic institutions, 
training courses, and disaster response exercises.  
 
1.5.  AFMS Assets.  Medical personnel support the Commander, Air Force Forces 
(COMAFFOR) in all AORs to accomplish specific regional goals in support of the global 
strategy.  Personnel with global health skills help provide a smooth transition for deploying 
forces.  In some instances, medical personnel may be the initial or only asset used to facilitate 
beneficial international relations and promote productive engagements with international 
partners and allies across multiple types of operations, including HA/DR, peacekeeping, 
homeland defense, and counterinsurgency (COIN).  AFMS medical personnel specializing in an 
international arena possess skills and qualifications that uniquely support missions outside the 
continental United States (OCONUS).  Seamless collaboration and interoperability in military-
civilian partnerships optimizes the healthcare of US and allied military personnel.  
 
1.5.1.  Critical Personnel.  Regular Air Force (RegAF) and Air Force Reserve Component 
personnel who interface with global health leadership and systems include, but are not 
limited to, the deployed medical commander (DMC), Component Numbered Air Force 
Surgeon (C-NAF/SG), Major Command Surgeon (MAJCOM/SG), Joint Force Commander 
(JFC), Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC), COMAFFOR, Joint Force Surgeon 
(JFS), United States Military Group (USMILGP) personnel at US embassies worldwide, and 
medical planners.  Full-time AFMS global health professionals contribute by maintaining 
knowledge of US global health national interests, a proactive and long-range view of health 
sector development, the ability to plan and execute GHE activities that support theater and 
combatant command objectives, cross-cultural and geopolitical competency, and foreign 
language proficiency.  These personnel include IHS teams, Defense Institute for Medical 
Operations (DIMO) teams, members of the United States Air Force School of Aerospace 
Medicine (USAFSAM) International Training Division, and medical exchange officers.   
 
1.5.2.  Special Operations Support.  IHS personnel may be assigned to Air Force Special 
Operations Command (AFSOC) and the United States Special Operations Command 
(USSOCOM) as combat aviation advisors (CAA), special mission officers, theater special 
operations, command medical operations officers, and Air Force Special Operations School 
instructors.  Special operations IHS personnel are specially trained and organized to support 
the core tasks of USSOCOM in all theaters. 
 
1.6.  Range of Operations.  GHE activities executed by AFMS personnel cover the full 
spectrum of military activities around the world.  The AFMS supports the mission and objectives 
of the CCDR through direct support of the Air Component.  These activities serve security 
cooperation, building partnership capacity (BPC) missions, and stability operations.  They 
support the military and whole of government through the full range of military operations 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014

(ROMO) (see Figure 1.1).  Health sector objectives are intertwined with and support US military 
objectives and US national political interests in every type of operation.

1.6.1.  Limited Contingency Operations and Major Operations.  Combat support 
missions have a significantly greater risk component.  All precautionary measures should be 
enacted when planning to engage with all facets of the HN medical system.  For crisis 
response taskings, the pre-deployment window for initial forces may be short, but health 
engagement through all operational phases must be considered for the best long-term 
outcomes. Limited contingency operations may include ongoing irregular or stability 
operations that may involve long-term or recurrent actions without the forces or resources of 
a major campaign. GHE may find a larger future role in support of limited contingency 
operations that specifically involve COIN, military support to stability operations, and 
broader applications that fall within the concepts of irregular warfare as an essential service 
for disgruntled populations.  Health activities that deliver personal care, generate local health 
sector capability and capacity building, and provide positive strategic messaging can be 
applied with altruism and still be a political and military tool to gain long-term influence and 
partnership. 
 
10          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
1.6.2.  Humanitarian Assistance (HA).  HA operations are elective missions supporting 
requests typically made by ministers of health (or equivalent) to US embassies to aid civilian 
populations.  HA missions can benefit medical personnel by exposing them to unique 
medical situations and conditions outside their normal duties.  Requests for assistance are 
coordinated through the DOS for approval and to the CCDR for mission prioritization.  The 
mission may be in a peaceful situation, primarily for security cooperation, or it may be in an 
area of conflict and part of a limited contingency operation in support of COIN or stability 
operations.  The goals associated with the HA mission should generate long-term positive 
public relations and goodwill between the HN and DOD and help build security and 
sustainable stability within the host nation.  Planners should prepare by fully understanding 
the purpose and scope of the mission and ensure the force is adequately supplied and 
manned. 
 
1.6.3.  Disaster Relief (DR).  DR missions are contingency response HA missions, typically 
with a limited objective of delivering prompt aid to relieve human suffering.  Normally, DR 
includes humanitarian services and transportation; provision of food, clothing, medicine, 
beds and bedding, temporary shelter and housing; furnishing of medical materiel and medical 
and technical personnel; and making repairs to essential services, as defined in JP 3-29, 
Foreign Humanitarian Assistance.  The USG may be asked for aid and then task the DOD to 
support the USG effort.  The disaster may be solely the result of an abrupt natural 
phenomenon or may be concurrent with conflict or combat (complex emergency), elevating 
the level of required risk preparation.  Taskings typically have a very short pre-deployment 
window resulting in limited time to ensure mission readiness. 
 
1.6.4.  Transition and Termination of Healthcare Support.  AFMS planners play a major 
role in the transition and termination of military healthcare support and assisting civilian 
organizations in clarifying US military activities in the health sector.  Examples of indicators 
that assist commanders in timing a smooth termination of the mission in armed conflict 
include successful restoration of healthcare facilities and medical supply warehouses, an 
acceptable drop in mortality rates, a percentage of dislocated civilians returning to their 
homes, or a decrease in civilians reporting with blast injuries.  When other organizations 
(such as HN, United Nations [UN], NGOs, and IOs) have marshaled the necessary medical 
capabilities to assume the mission, AFMS forces may execute a transition plan. 
 
1.6.5.  Peace Operations.  The peacekeeper’s main function is to establish a presence to 
inhibit hostile actions by the disputing parties and to bolster confidence in the peace process.  
The DMC must be aware of special technical agreements with other services and agencies 
regarding emergency care services and healthcare logistics.  Medical and dental 
peacekeeping operations enhance positive response of the local populace to military 
personnel and hopefully the host partner government. 
 
1.7.  Goals.  Two goals associated with GHE are enhancing cultural aptitude and providing 
mission support. 
 
1.7.1.  Cultural Aptitude.  Enhancing cultural exchange through language proficiency, 
awareness and understanding of local customs, and experience working within international 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
11 
settings helps ensure the AFMS’ ability to meet assigned taskings, build partnerships, and 
support the full ROMO. 
 
1.7.2.  Mission Support.  The AFMS supports the DOS, CCDR, and COMAFFOR’s specific 
regional goals (as identified in strategic-level documents such as the Guidance for 
Employment of the Force [GEF]) through GHE and interaction with local, regional, and 
international healthcare organizations.  Successful interface and coordination with these 
organizations requires accurate assessment of medical resources and capabilities.  It requires 
knowledge of how these organizations operate and interact with each other and with the USG 
and DOD in particular. 
 
Section 1B—Roles and Responsibilities 
 
1.8.  Military Roles. 
 
1.8.1.  Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force for International Affairs (SAF/IA).  The 
SAF/IA is the lead Headquarters, Air Force (HAF) agent for building global partnerships.  
The SAF/IA coordinates development of the Air Force global partnership strategy and 
oversees its execution in support of the combatant commands in coordination with other 
HAF organizations, MAJCOMs, and Air Force components (regular Air Force and Air 
Reserve Component [ARC]). 
 
1.8.2.  United States Military Group (USMILGP) Embassy Team.  USMILGP facilitates 
relationships between deployed Air Force medical personnel and local health authorities and 
organizations.  Deploying commanders should make contact with the USMILGP before 
arrival in country.  USMILGP offices can advise AFMS personnel on whether the 
environment for medical operations is permissive, uncertain, or hostile.  The USMILGP 
should also be able to provide background information on the HN health care system, its 
capabilities, deficits, structure, and locations at the national, regional, and local levels. 
 
1.8.3.  Combatant Commander (CCDR).  The CCDR requests medical assets to support 
operations in the AOR in accordance with (IAW) the TCP or contingency operation plan 
(OPLAN).  The CCDR communicates and coordinates with SAF/IA, USMILGP, and the C-
NAF or Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG). 
 
1.8.4.  Major Commands (MAJCOMs) and Component Numbered Air Forces (C-
NAFs).  MAJCOMs and C-NAFs organize, train, and equip Air Force units to support global 
partnership activities.  They review on-going and new international activities on a regular 
basis to ensure activities continue to support combatant command objectives and Air Force 
strategy.  Through the A5, they work with CCDRs to develop theater security cooperation 
and similar plans, ensuring that AFMS assess, train, advise, and assist capabilities are 
incorporated into these plans as needed.  They receive requests for medical support from the 
combatant command surgeon or in-country team.  The C-NAF validates all requests and 
sources team requests through the MAJCOMs.   
 
12          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
1.8.5.  Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR).  The COMAFFOR has visibility of 
all medical assets available and understands the multinational context of healthcare in the 
AOR.  In interaction with allied forces and HN leadership, the COMAFFOR is alerted to HN 
medical concerns that warrant the attention of the Air Force Forces Surgeon (AFFOR/SG). 
 
1.9.  AFMS Responsibilities. 
 
1.9.1.  Air Force Surgeon General.  The AF/SG advises the Chief of Staff, United States 
Air Force (CSAF) on the Air Force medical assets available to support any contingency 
operation.  The AF/SG provides information on US, allied, and HN medical capabilities.  The 
AF/SG promotes interoperability of Air Force medical assets with joint, international, and 
HN healthcare through effective training and planning.  
 
1.9.2.  IHS Consultant to the AF/SG.  As the adviser to the AF/SG, the IHS consultant 
offers insight into staff capabilities in terms of cultural expertise, language proficiency, 
special experience identifier (SEI), and medical expertise.  The consultant offers 
recommendations on planning and execution of GHE and the training of expeditionary and 
global health assets at the enterprise level.  The consultant acts in an advisory capacity for the 
geographic IHS teams’ tactical execution and coordination.  The consultant is the point of 
contact (POC) for military medical education personnel exchanges and oversees DIMO as 
well as the IHS program. 
 
1.9.3.  Air Force Forces Surgeon (AFFOR/SG).  The AFFOR/SG directs Air Force health 
service operations and advises the COMAFFOR on all aspects of medical care that may 
affect mission accomplishment.  The AFFOR/SG is supported by the DMCs, IHS team chief, 
DIMO, and senior medical personnel. 
 
1.9.4.  Major Command Surgeon (MAJCOM/SG), Air National Guard Surgeon 
(ANG/SG), and Air Force Reserve Command Surgeon (AFRC/SG).  Command surgeons 
are charged with identifying units or personnel to support medical missions, including special 
operations missions.  The allocation and training of medical personnel supporting special 
operations missions and use of HN healthcare may differ from the approach in traditional 
expeditionary or humanitarian operations. 
 
1.9.5.  Air Force Expeditionary Medical Readiness Division (AF/SG3X).  AF/SG3X 
oversees the development of AF/SG policies supporting Air Force expeditionary capabilities 
and national security strategy.  The International Health Specialist branch (AFMSA/SG3XI) 
located at the Air Force Medical Support Agency, Medical Readiness Directorate 
(AFMSA/SG3X), is responsible for organizing, training, and equipping IHS staff members 
for MAJCOM, combatant command, and DIMO assignments. 
 
1.9.6.  Continental United States (CONUS) Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) 
Commander.  The MTF commander identifies personnel with the skills and qualifications 
required for unit type code (UTC) assignment or special taskings.  The MTF commander 
directs personnel to appropriate training and ensures that personnel tasked for overseas 
operations are familiar with the healthcare environment in their deployed location. 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
13 
 
1.9.7.  Public Health Officers (PHOs).  PHOs offer the COMAFFOR and AFFOR/SG 
regional medical surveillance skills that support the execution of war and other contingency 
operations.  As a tasked advanced echelon (ADVON) team member, public health personnel 
may make the first interface with HN personnel and must be familiar with local issues 
affecting healthcare. 
 
1.9.8.  Air Force Senior Medical Officer (SMO).  The SMO may be a DMC, task force 
surgeon, IHS team chief, or medical leader deployed in a different role.  The SMO 
establishes the framework of cooperative efforts with HN medical personnel.  This person 
must be familiar with the rules of engagement for the operation.  The SMO advises the chain 
of command on all medical data gathered from the AOR.  Every opportunity should be made 
to preserve and enhance established relationships with the HN before deployment of medical 
assets.  IHS team members and IHS SEI holders should be used to the greatest extent 
possible. 
 
1.9.9.  Deployed Medical Personnel.  All medical personnel engaged in international 
activities should be familiar with the HN medical capability, including caregiver levels of 
training and expertise, facility capacity, and resources.  Medical personnel should be aware 
of unique cultural differences within the HN healthcare system, especially in those rare 
circumstances when US forces may receive care at HN facilities.  In the absence of dedicated 
IHS personnel, deployed medical personnel should take advantage of other military language 
specialists to provide interpretation expertise necessary for safe and effective healthcare 
delivery. 
 
1.10.  Other Assets and Organizations. 
 
1.10.1.  International Organizations (IOs), Governmental Agencies, and Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  IOs, government agencies, and NGOs are excellent 
resources for medical data sharing.  Relationships with these organizations should be based 
on mutual understanding of lines of communication, support requirements, and information 
sharing.  To the extent possible, the AFMS should promote cooperation and information 
exchange with these agencies through a formal mechanism such as a Civil-Military 
Operations Center (CMOC).  The philosophies and political views of these organizations 
vary widely and should be considered before establishing an alliance.  Interactions between 
some NGOs and the AFMS may be impossible to negotiate because such cooperation may 
run counter to their charter or founding principles. 
 
1.10.2.  National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) and Defense Intelligence 
Agency (DIA).  These agencies offer comprehensive information on international healthcare 
capabilities, regional environment, and threat levels.  Their research may be used by senior 
medical officers in preparation for medical operations. 
 
1.10.3.  Air Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT) Squadron.  AFSAT’s mission 
is to plan, develop, program, and execute training and education programs that enhance 
strategic relationships and agreements and help strengthen worldwide alliances in support of 
14          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
US national security strategy.  The agency serves as the executive agent for all Air Force 
sponsored international training. 
 
Section 1C—Planning for Global Health Engagement 
 
1.11.  Integrated Planning.  Integrated health sector planning enhances the protection of Air 
Force expeditionary forces while furthering the objectives of commanders.  All deliberate, crisis-
action exercise and theater security cooperation planning processes should include international 
healthcare experts with operational experience at the strategic and operational levels.  IHS 
personnel on the MAJCOM, C-NAF, and CCDR Surgeon General staffs should participate in 
planning although they do not make decisions about OPLANs and exercises.  They should assist 
with developing guidance on theater objectives.  They should review proposed medical projects 
and after action reports (AARs) to ensure objectives are identified and aligned with theater 
objectives.  IHS personnel should provide information on PN POCs in the AOR, such as ministry 
of health (MOH), ministry of defense (MOD), and military groups.  Medical planners require 
detailed information on healthcare systems in identified locations to support OPLANs and 
concepts of operations (CONOPS).  This information should include details on the national 
healthcare infrastructures, availability of medical specialties, and access to evacuation assets, 
potential health hazards, environmental threats, and cultural and political sensitivities that may 
impact the health of deployed forces.  In planning and executing GHE activities, IHS personnel 
should stress the need to adhere to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and USAID’s 
reconstruction principles.   
 
1.12.  Reconstruction Principles.  USAID’s key principles for successful reconstruction and 
development efforts are critical concepts for GHE capacity-building initiatives. 
 
 Ownership:  Build on leadership, participation, and commitment of a country and its 
people. 
 
 Capacity Building:  Strengthen local institutions, transfer technical skills, and promote 
appropriate policies.  (Note:  Help build or enhance capability and then partner to 
increase capability breadth and impact.) 
 
 Sustainability:  Design programs to ensure their impact endures. 
 
 Selectivity:  Allocate resources based on need, local commitment, and foreign policy 
interests. 
 
 Assessment:  Conduct careful research, adapt best practices, and design for local 
conditions. 
 
 Results:  Direct resources to achieve clearly defined, measurable, and strategically 
focused objectives. 
 
 Partnership:  Collaborate closely with governments, commitments, donors, non-profit 
organizations, private sector, IOs, and universities. 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
15 
 
 Flexibility:  Adjust to changing conditions, take advantage of opportunities, and 
maximize efficiency. 
 
 Accountability:  Design accountability and transparency into systems and build effective 
checks and balances to guard against corruption. 
 
1.13.  Exercise Planning.  The AFMS provides medical support planning for specific training 
exercises to support OPLANs and CONOPS occurring in foreign nations.  Exercises such as 
COBRA GOLD, BRIGHT STAR, and ULCHI FREEDOM GUARDIAN are examples of 
planned exercises.  The planning for these exercises occurs at the CCDR and MAJCOM levels 
over a period of several months before the exercise.  MAJCOMs should include IHS personnel 
with language and operational experience for the exercise locations in their exercise planning 
and deployments.  PN participation in exercises helps identify capability gaps that IHS staff can 
work to improve. 
 
1.14.  Theater Campaign Planning.  Air Force GHE activities are normally conducted in 
support of COMAFFOR campaign support plans and country plans, which support the CCDR 
TCP.  The CCDR TCP identifies the objectives, mission focus, and direction for interaction with 
each country in the theater.  The TCP is based on a 5-7 year planning timeframe and is mainly 
created for peacetime, permissive environments.  The AFMS IHS program provides expertise to 
CCDRs for the planning and execution of medical interactions for the TCP and COMAFFOR 
supporting plans.  As an example, the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) 
Surgeon’s Office has an IHS team on staff whose members are responsible for developing 
specific regional medical plans within the USCENTCOM AOR. 
 
1.15.  Planning Considerations.  While focusing on PN military resources, GHE plans must 
identify and consider the whole health sector, which includes private, public, and military health 
systems, direct patient care, public health, and the critical governance and economic aspects that 
affect health.  Planners should consider the HN’s foundational health sector needs, which 
typically include public health issues such as sanitation, potable water, nutrition, immunization, 
disease surveillance and prevention, maternal and child health, veterinary medicine, dental, 
environmental health, industrial health, and HN AE.  Planners should design the correct type of 
activity to attain objectives.  For instance, direct patient care may not always be the right choice 
and could undermine relationship building, local health sector economics and development, and 
long-term positive outcomes.  GHE planning and execution requires international health 
information derived from and coordination with various organizations, such as the NCMI, CDC, 
US Global Health Initiative, and international sources such as the WHO. 
 
1.15.1.  Medical Intelligence Preparation.  Medical intelligence preparation considers the 
potential health threats that the partner health sector faces as well as the threats to US forces. 
 
1.15.1.1.  Theater Assessment.  Theater assessment considers the joint, coalition, and 
PN military and civilian capabilities and capacities.  It also considers socio-political and 
cultural aspects and regional nuances. 
 
16          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
1.15.1.2.  Health Risk Assessment.  Health risk assessments anticipate, identify, and 
assess health threats to military personnel, partners, and target patient care population.  It 
includes environmental, man-made, and industrial hazards. 
 
1.15.1.3.  Medical Threat Assessment.  Medical threat assessments consider specific 
diseases that may affect military personnel as well as diseases and occupational issues 
with great local impact that may be of low threat for US forces.  For example our US 
forces may be vaccinated against measles or pertussis, but the local population may have 
low vaccination rates. 
 
1.15.1.4.  Needs Assessment.  Needs assessment considers the PN’s military and civilian 
health sector gaps and priorities to determine if the US has capabilities that can assist.  
The AFMS focuses on military health sector gaps. The DOS and USAID focus on the 
civilian sector. 
 
1.15.1.5.  Outcomes Assessment.  Outcomes assessment is done as a baseline and then at 
various intervals during and after the engagement.  The goal is to have objective 
measurements that demonstrate attainment of objectives (also called measures of 
performance [MOPs] and measures of effectiveness [MOE]). 
 
1.15.2.  Force Health Protection Considerations.  In GHE missions, US forces may be 
acting as first responders with partners and may not have readily available access to the 
higher level capabilities expected in US systems.  Austere environments may offer patient 
movement challenges that require planning consideration.  Personnel responding to human 
tragedy or working with long-term human suffering may experience significant physical and 
emotional effects that should also be considered. 
 
1.15.3.  Medical Rules of Engagement.  Clearly defined medical rules of engagement help 
US medical personnel in all types of operations.  AFMS leadership and planners should 
determine in advance the plan for the provision of care to HN personnel and other civilians.  
The plan should include who gets direct patient care, which facilities will provide care, 
standard of care, disposition of patients to the HN or international community care, 
availability of AE, and cooperation on displaced personnel health issues.  
 
1.15.4.  Resources and Interoperability.  The packaging of personnel and equipment for 
health engagement operations is tailored to the mission.  For example, DR operations may 
require a primarily surgical presence initially while a security cooperation campaign may 
focus on public health advisors.  The AFMS must be integrated with the line responders, and 
medical plans should be coordinated with other functional areas to ensure synergy.  
Interoperability with sister services and the HN is also paramount. 
 
1.15.5.  Transition Planning.  Ultimately, the HN or designee will need to run their own 
health sector programs and efforts at the level of standards that their resources allow and 
their culture accepts.  To maximize the positive outcomes for US efforts, planners must 
coordinate early, determine who the lead is and who will take over, emphasize support and 
advising when possible, and help define and then focus on the commander’s objectives from 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
17 
the beginning.  In most cases, planning to enhance HN legitimacy in the health sector will be 
a win-win. 
 
1.15.6.  Examples of Health Engagement Activities.  The AFMS has the ability to support 
a wide variety of health engagement activities that can be tailored to the needs of the HN or 
partner.  To achieve enduring, strategic results, planners should prioritize activities that build 
PN capacity over direct intervention.  Medical Readiness Training Exercises (MEDRETEs) 
and Medical Civic Action Programs (MEDCAPs) may include one or any combination of 
activities as dictated by the objectives, needs, planning considerations, and funding.  The 
following are some examples of health engagement activities:  
 
 EMEDS 
 HN public health, preventive 
medicine, veterinary, dental 
augmentation 
 Health system mentoring and 
advising 
 Paramedic capability 
development 
 FHP  
 Emergent and disaster response 
capability development 
 Disaster response exercise 
planning and execution 
 Combat exercises 
 Combat casualty care training 
 Military and civilian medical 
logistics programs 
 Health worker education 
programs 
 Skill-specific mentorship 
 Military and civilian medical 
intelligence 
 Hospital and clinical system 
management 
 Sustainable infrastructure and 
upgrade of existing facilities 
 Public information programs 
 Health sector assessments 
 Direct patient care 
 Conferences, seminars, 
workshops 
 HA program 
 Disease surveillance 
 National Guard state partnership 
program 
 University partnership (academic 
exchanges) 
 Medical embedded training 
teams 
 Provincial reconstruction teams 
 HN patient movement 
capabilities 
 Health indicators assessment 
 
Section 1D—Operational Considerations for Deployed Medical Commanders 
 
1.16.  Pre-Deployment Activities. 
 
1.16.1.  Mission Communication.  The DMC/SMO should understand and communicate the 
mission scope and purpose to HN officials and deploying team members ahead of time.  It is 
important for the DMC/SMO to understand US politics and policy and know whether 
coordination should be turned over to Public Affairs.  IHS staff support strategic 
communication endeavors by providing cultural and foreign language expertise. 
 
1.16.2.  NGO Participation.  The mission of NGOs and other global health actors frequently 
diverge from those of the DOD.  When possible, DOD GHE personnel should seek to 
18          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
actively collaborate in areas of shared interest.  The next best option is cooperation whereby 
separate efforts support rather than hinder common goals.  GHE planners must understand 
that NGOs are often better postured and resourced to sustain long-term activities with foreign 
partners.  The United States Institute of Peace Guidelines for Relations between US Armed 
Forces and Non-Governmental Humanitarian Organizations in Hostile or Potentially Hostile 
Environments provide guidelines for interactions between US military and US NGOs in non-
permissive environments.  These guidelines were developed in concert with the DOD and 
InterAction (an umbrella organization for US NGOs) 
 
1.16.3.  Security Requirements.  The DMC/SMO should know of any security requirements 
and restrictions.  For example, ANG security forces were not allowed to carry weapons while 
providing security to a deployed clinic during PROVIDE COMFORT (an HA mission). 
 
1.16.4.  Gift Donations.  The donation of culturally appropriate gifts to the HN and partner 
leadership can be a valuable relationship building tool.  Gifts such as school supplies (e.g., 
pencils, pens, paper), clothing, and personal hygiene products (e.g., soap, shampoo) may be 
appropriate depending on the mission.  DMCs should be cautious not to allow these gifts to 
affect mission success.  Gift donations are often best done in conjunction with a local NGO.  
The local base legal office should be consulted for any gift donation.  The Defense Institute 
for Security Assistance Management (DISAM) can provide additional guidance on gift 
donation. 
 
1.16.5.  Site Survey Update.  Site surveys involve communicating with HN medical 
personnel to obtain updated information about medical capabilities and facilities at 
anticipated locations.  A plan to meet requirements from the HN infrastructure should be 
processed through the military liaison or CCDR surgeon. 
 
1.16.6.  Liaison Coordination.  If a task force surgeon is not in place, the DMC/SMO may 
need to coordinate directly with the US embassy through the military group or the embassy 
health program representative.  Typically, a USAID representative manages HN or regional 
health programs if there is not an official health attaché from the Department of Health and 
Human Services (DHHS).  The combatant command surgeon should also be used as a 
reachback capability.  Other resources include US expatriates, US private companies, and 
HN personnel operating in the US as liaison officers (LNOs). 
 
1.16.7.  Historical Document Review.  Before deployment, DMCs should review previous 
operations and exercises in the Theater Security Cooperation Management Information 
System (TSCMIS), AARs, and lessons learned.  AARs and lessons learned should be 
accessible from the supported combatant command surgeon or supported MAJCOM. 
 
1.16.8.  Host Nation Health Information and Medical Intelligence.  The DMC should 
ensure the currency of medical intelligence and HN medical information (e.g., hospital 
contact and capabilities information) before and throughout the deployment.  The DMC 
should review local health threats, disease and injury reports, and disease surveillance. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
19 
1.17.  Deployment Activities. 
 
1.17.1.  Establish Direct Communications.  Once authorized direct liaison authority by the 
US embassy, the DMC/SMO should make communication channels between HN medical 
facilities and US medical interests a priority.  Robust and open communications facilitate 
optimal care for deployed US troops.  All formal and informal communication channels 
should be used. 
 
1.17.1.1.  Direct Contact with HN Medical System.  Staff members of the deployed 
medical facility who directly interact with the HN medical system provide key 
information about medical care and the environment in the AOR.  This information 
should be reported up the chain of command. 
 
1.17.1.2.  Assessment of Host Nation Infrastructure.  The DMC and Air Force LNO 
along with Judge Advocate General (JAG) officials should ensure standards of care and 
quality of supplies and services meet AFMS standards for care of US personnel.  It may 
be necessary to consider increasing the medical footprint of the deployed medical system 
or to establish rapid, reliable AE capabilities.  Memorandums of understanding (MOUs), 
memorandums of agreement (MOAs), and contracts should be the primary 
communication for all formal relations with the HN medical infrastructure. 
 
1.17.1.3.  Participation in HN and Joint Medical Planning Activities.  Deployed 
commanders are strongly encouraged to participate in HN and joint planning for new 
contingencies while in the AOR.  Medical data gathered at these meetings can facilitate 
medical treatment and augment local capabilities. 
 
1.17.2.  Maintain Air Force Liaison Officer Relations.  To the extent possible, a medical 
LNO should be assigned to ensure daily contact with HN infrastructure to support quality 
assurance in all formal relations with the HN and continued informal partnerships. 
 
1.17.3.  Information Sharing.  The DMC/SMO should share appropriate information with 
the HN medical system such as disease and injury rates, mass casualty patient administration 
and collateral damage assessments, and medical infrastructure capabilities. 
 
1.17.4.  Informal Relationships with Host Nation.  Informal relationships with local 
populations often provide more current and relevant information about the local area than the 
information obtained through official sources.  In some cultures, these relationships may take 
generations to establish.  Cordial communications and building genuine, trusting 
relationships should be a goal.  The process of establishing informal lines of communication 
should be initiated immediately upon arrival in theater.  The DMC and medical personnel 
should expect to meet with local officials immediately upon arrival at a deployed site and 
should plan for extensive and regular discussion and coordination to solidify mutual 
understanding. 
 
1.17.5.  Transition Briefs.  The DMC/SMO provides transition briefs for new US personnel 
coming into the AOR.  Briefs should include standard facets, personal introductions to key 
20          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
players and counterparts, and a summary of host medical facility capabilities.  Local cultural 
practices and policies should be shared at all levels.  The staff IHS officer or 
noncommissioned officer (NCO) can assist with these briefs. 
 
1.18.  Redeployment Activities. 
 
1.18.1.  Update Medical Information.  HN medical capabilities and other information 
should be recorded and communicated.  Commanders should share lessons learned and best 
practices through AARs and lessons learned databases IAW AFI 10-204, Participation in 
Joint and National Exercises, and AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program.  AARs 
and daily summaries should focus on the skills that were transferred between medical 
professionals, capture measures of effectiveness, and provide context for follow-on 
personnel.  MOEs must be reviewed at appropriate intervals to determine if the desired 
impact was achieved and to inform plans to continue, improve, or terminate future similar 
missions. 
 
1.18.2.  Post-Operational Medical Liaison.  Relationships with the HN may continue to be 
nurtured and expanded after redeployment within the guidelines established by the combatant 
command or air component surgeon. 
 
Section 1E—Dedicated AFMS and DOD Programs 
 
1.19.  International Health Specialist Program.  The IHS Program Office develops and 
maintains information on individual IHS personnel to include foreign language proficiency, SEI 
level, formal education, and international health and deployment experience.  Their focus is on 
skills specific to interagency coordination, security cooperation, and cultural, political, 
sociological, economic, and geographic factors affecting the health sector of countries and 
regions in which US Forces may operate.  IHS personnel are AFMS personnel with identified 
cultural expertise, language proficiency, and medical skills.  The individual IHS SEI holder is 
responsible for maintaining language proficiency and IHS core competencies.  See AFI 44-162 
for more information about the IHS program.  See Chapter 2 of this AFTTP for more 
information about the IHS team. 
 
1.20.  Defense Institute for Medical Operations (DIMO).  DIMO provides exportable, 
regionally focused healthcare education and training.  DIMO’s programs strive to improve 
security cooperation between militaries, improve civilian agency interaction, and strengthen 
international coalition partnerships.  The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), as the 
DOD focal point for international education and training, provides sponsorship through 
International Military Education and Training (IMET), foreign military sales (FMS), and other 
funding sources such as the Foreign Military Financing Program (FMFP). 
 
1.21.  National Guard State Partnership Program (SPP).  The National Guard SPP is a joint 
security cooperation program managed by the National Guard Bureau (NGB) and executed by 
the state adjutant generals in support of CCDR security cooperation objectives and ambassador 
integrated country strategies under the authorities provided by DOD and Congress.  The SPP 
matches a National Guard state with a PN to exchange military skills and experience, share 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
21 
defense knowledge, enhance partner capability, and conduct GHE to support security 
cooperation goals.  The SPP promotes enduring and mutually beneficial security relationships.  It 
currently links 68 countries to all 50 states, 2 territories (Puerto Rico and Guam), and 
Washington D.C.  See DODI 5111.20, State Partnership Program (SPP), for more information. 
 
1.22.  Military Personnel Exchange Program (MPEP).  The MPEP, under legislative authority 
from the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997, is owned by CSAF and 
executed by the Air Force Attaché Office.  This program is executed through an MOA between 
the Air Force and each host country.  Working towards achieving interoperability with a country, 
AFMS personnel provide assistance in establishing requirements for the MPEP and in 
developing a longitudinal plan for future exchanges. 
 
Section 1F—Education and Training 
 
1.23.  Global Health Engagement Awareness.  All Air Force medical personnel should have 
basic cultural awareness and understand their role in GHE.  Resources for this training include 
the Air Force Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) cultural awareness module and 
the Air Force Cultural and Language Center.  Line commanders, SGs, and other medical leaders 
and planners require an understanding of AFMS health engagement capabilities and how they 
can and should be employed throughout the ROMO.  A subset of medical personnel should have 
comprehensive knowledge and aptitude for languages and cultures, global health systems, how to 
develop and leverage relationships, and how to use health engagements to maximize positive 
impacts and mitigate potential adverse impacts.  This advanced training may come from formal 
academic programs and informal offerings from the global health and military communities. 
 
1.23.1.  Special Operations Unit Training Capabilities.  As directed or required by the 
mission, special operations units may provide medical training in the HN IAW national 
security strategy. 
 
1.23.2.  International Medical Conferences and Seminars.  Air Force personnel participate 
in and can contribute to medical conferences and seminars designed to further international 
military medical education, cooperation, and interoperability.  
 
1.23.3.  Building Partnerships and Security Cooperation.  Air Force expeditionary 
medical personnel promote mutual understanding and increased cooperation between the US 
and the HN by participating in field training exercises in conjunction with partners.  AFMS 
personnel with global health backgrounds and experience help plan exercises that maximize 
development for US and partner forces. 
 
1.23.4.  DIMO Courses.  DIMO offers mobile training courses to host countries at the 
request of partners through the US embassy country team.  Course offerings include public 
health and biosecurity, disaster planning and consequence management, healthcare 
management, and patient movement.  Courses are funded by IMET, Expanded-International 
Military Education and Training (E-IMET), Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program 
(CTFP), FMS, FMFP, and HA sources. 
 
22          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
1.23.5.  USAF Steady-State Campaign Support Planning Course.  This ADLS course 
provides training for C-NAF and AFFOR personnel to design, plan, prepare, execute, and 
assess steady-state campaigns in support of the COMAFFOR and CCDRs.  
 
1.24.  International Education and Training.  The International Education and Training 
Program offers education and training to foreign governments and international organizations at 
DOD schools.  International training includes formal, informal, correspondence, or other forms 
of distance learning, and computer-aided instruction.  DOD medical agencies offering formal 
education and training opportunities for PNs include DIMO (see paragraph 1.20) and 
USAFSAM. 
 
1.24.1.  Training Requests and Funding.  PN requests for international training are routed 
through the US embassy’s security cooperation officer (SCO).  PNs may purchase training 
with their national funds through the FMS program or through security cooperation 
appropriations such as the IMET program.  These funds are congressional appropriated funds 
authorized annually by the DOS.  Requests for training are typically programmed during 
each geographic combatant commander’s (GCC) Security Cooperation Education and 
Training Working Group (SCETWG) and programmed with the military departments 
(MILDEPs) to identify training requirements.  Upon receipt of funding authority, the 
MILDEPs authorize the SCO to prepare invitation travel orders (ITO) once the candidate’s 
vetting is completed.  Individual schools can be represented at each SCETWG if authorized 
by the applicable GCC staff.  See Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Manual 
5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual (Chapter 10, International Training), 
for more information about the policies, programs, and procedures related to the International 
Education and Training Program.  AFI 16-105, Joint Security Cooperation Education and 
Training, provides additional information on the management of international education and 
training. 
 
1.24.2.  United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine International Training 
Division (USAFSAM/ETO).  USAFSAM is the premier institute for research, education, 
and worldwide operational consultation in aerospace medicine.  USAFSAM trains 
approximately 4,500 DOD, international, and civilian students each year.  The USAFSAM 
International Training Division (USAFSAM/ETO) collaborates with the Registrar Division 
(USAFSAM/EDM) to manage all international training within USAFSAM.  These courses 
promote English as the language of choice for medical operations and the globalization of 
many US practices.  The six-month Advanced Aerospace Medicine for International Medical 
Officers (AAMIMO) course has been instrumental in establishing and maintaining 
partnerships with over 130 nations and is recognized as one of the premier courses for PN 
flight surgeons. 
 
Section 1G—Information Management 
 
1.25.  Information Management and Information Sharing Activities.  Interfacing with world 
healthcare involves sharing the expertise of the AFMS with world partners to build capacity, 
interoperability, and goodwill between the US and foreign medical infrastructures.  Information 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
23 
learned from past HN integration activities is available on the AFMS knowledge server website.  
Target audiences include AFMS senior leaders and EMEDS commanders. 
 
1.25.1.  After Action and Trip Reports.  AARs provide documentation of previous 
missions and can be helpful for subsequent planning.  IHS personnel should complete these 
reports IAW AFI 10-204 and AFI 90-1601 and forward a copy to the IHS Program Office.  
These reports will be entered into appropriate planning databases, such as TSCMIS.  AARs 
should state the mission objectives and the extent to which they were achieved.  They should 
include the names of AFMS personnel involved, the names of foreign medical personnel 
contacted, and the foreign medical facilities visited. 
 
1.25.2.  National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI).  NCMI is the DOD agency that 
compiles information on foreign medical infrastructure, foreign military medical capability, 
and force protection information.  Upon request, NCMI will produce specific products for the 
mission and location needed by DMCs, medical planners, or IHS subject matter experts 
(SMEs). 
 
1.25.3.  Force Health Protection Information in Foreign Settings.  While NCMI and 
public health officers are the offices of primary responsibility for monitoring foreign disease 
issues that might affect deployed US military personnel, interfacing with local public health 
experts adds an understanding of the AOR’s disease profiles from the HN’s perspective. 
 
1.25.4.  Latent Information Sharing Activities.  Theater-focused IHS teams are encouraged 
to synthesize and document in a standard format the capability of each geographically 
distinct region in their AOR to support deployed AFMS operations.  Teams should actively 
monitor multiple sources to capture current knowledge of healthcare infrastructure, military 
medical capability, and FHP concerns of each country in the AOR. 
 
1.25.5.  Sharing Expertise with Global Health Partners.  DIMO, working with combatant 
command staffs in support of the component commander’s TCP, exports courses to foreign 
medical entities.  These educational events create opportunities for Air Force personnel to 
interface with world healthcare.  IHS team members are used on DIMO missions when 
instructor criteria are met.  Regional teams should be aware of the range of DIMO offerings 
so they can support the DIMO office in marketing these capabilities to their associated 
combatant commands. 
 
1.26.  Metrics.  Air Force offices with primary responsibilities for interfacing with world health 
officials use metrics to help quantify how Air Force personnel are supporting the CCDR’s 
medical surveillance, planning, coordination, and operational activities.  Metrics are used to 
justify resource allocations during the program objective memorandum (POM) process.  Useful 
measures include the number of countries involved in joint and bilateral military exercises; the 
percentage of TCP-prioritized PNs with active medical lines of engagement; the number of 
countries with medical capabilities evaluated; the types and quantities of clinical services 
performed in foreign countries; DIMO course results and whether the HN develops a similar 
course; the number of international personnel attending IHS-sponsored training; and whether 
IHS team members have attained full SEI qualification.  Mission-specific metrics should be 
24          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
developed during the planning process and focus on commander objectives, local health needs, 
and accepted international health parameters.

INTERNATIONAL HEALTH SPECIALIST (IHS) TEAMS 
 
Section 2A—Capability 
 
2.1.  Background.  The Air Force initiated the IHS program to focus AFMS members educated 
in the language, culture, and politics of specific regions on building medical partnerships with 
other countries and agencies.  IHS teams and individuals support CCDR TCPs, create 
partnerships with medical colleagues from nations within their regions, facilitate culturally 
appropriate military-to-military and military-to-civilian interactions, and support medical 
planning.  IHS teams cross traditional medical career field lines to facilitate interoperability 
between the AFMS and other health and humanitarian organizations.  Information about the 
program and reference materials are available on the IHS website:  
https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx4/InternationalHealthSpecialist/Pages/home.aspx. 
 
2.2.  Mission.  The IHS is a cadre of AFMS personnel with foreign language proficiency, cross-
cultural aptitude, and expertise in global public health and medical systems; joint, combined, and 
multi-agency operations; planning; strategic communication; and health diplomacy.  IHS 
members are instrumental in fostering partnerships with military, civilian, coalition, and 
interagency personnel.  IHS personnel can advise senior medical officers, SGs, AFFOR, and 
joint leadership on the effective use of medical assets across the ROMO and operational phases, 
particularly in the areas of GHE and direct support of TCP objectives.  IHS personnel may 
deploy as individual augmentees or as part of small, deployable force packages that provide 
support tailored to the requirements identified by the country teams, combatant command 
surgeon, AFFOR, joint task force (JTF), or joint enabling tasking. 
 
2.3.  Air Reserve Component (ARC) IHS Teams.  The AFRC and ANG do not have Reserve 
Component IHS UTCs.  The RegAF ARC liaison is responsible for coordinating the use of 
individual SEI holders.  Tasking may include self-initiated activities in support of geographic 
combatant command IHS requirements or the State Partnership Program, activities designed to 
augment another lead unit (e.g., Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] exercises), or direct Air and Space 
Expeditionary Force (AEF) tasking.  RegAF IHS liaisons work within the force structure of the 
ARC to find qualified personnel to support international engagement missions based on requests 
from other DOD and government agencies.  The individuals or units participate contingent on 
support from their wing or numbered air forces.  Through combatant command contacts, ARC 
IHS commitments are often made years in advance for programmed activities.  Response to 
short-notice taskings is possible but requires attention to fiscal and regulatory guidance that is 
often complicated.  ARC IHS participation is performed in a variety of pay status from annual 
tour to manpower or reserve personnel appropriation (MPA/RPA) man days.  C-NAF IHS teams 
should program MPA man days through their A1 Reserves Affairs to facilitate ARC 
augmentation for TCP events.   
 
2.4.  FFHSR, Regional Health Specialist.  FFHSR provides personnel to deliver regional health 
specialist expertise to military and non-military operations such as major theater war (MTW), 
HA/DR, security cooperation, HN partnership building, stability and reconstruction operations, 
26          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
and health sector capacity building.  FFHSR may deploy with EMEDS Health Response Team 
(HRT) or as augmentation for AFFOR, JTF, and Commander, Joint Task Force (CJTF) 
headquarters.  The regional health specialist provides area-specific insight and in-depth 
familiarity with HN, US and foreign government, non-governmental and international 
governmental health capabilities, and activities in the AOR.  This individual helps guide 
execution of health engagement activities to support mission objectives and helps deployed 
commanders evaluate the medical dimensions of the operational environment in a cultural 
context and their implications to the mission and US FHP.  Table 2-1 lists the manpower detail.

Note:  Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), grade, and skill-level substitutions are IAW the War 
and Mobilization Plan, Volume 1 (WMP-1), AFMS Supplement, AFI 10-403, Deployment 
Planning and Execution, and the mission capability (MISCAP) statement. 
 
2.5.  Primary Sourcing.  The C-NAFs or Component Major Commands (C-MAJCOMs) with 
full-time IHS personnel assigned provide RegAF medical personnel to support theater FFHSR 
requirements.  Fully qualified AFMS personnel assigned at MTFs or other locations may fill 
FFHSR requirements postured within their MAJCOMs if no full-time regional IHS personnel are 
available for deployment. 
 
2.6.  Additional Sourcing.  AFFOR may use volunteer forces from RegAF and ARC personnel 
(AFRC and ANG) to source specific FFHSR operational taskings.  The IHS personnel database 
identifies AFMS volunteers with IHS core competencies who can be used to support specific 
combatant command operations and security cooperation initiatives.  This database is centrally 
managed by the IHS Program Office with additional information provided by the Air Force 
Personnel Center (AFPC).  IHS members in the SEI database remain under the control of their 
respective commands but can be identified to fill CCDR and AFFOR IHS requirements.  At 
execution, command relationships are defined in the warning, execution, or deployment order. 
 
2.7.  Selection for FFHSR.  Full-time IHS candidates who are nominated to fill an FFHSR 
mobility tasking will undergo a position-specific local validation process.  The IHS Program 
Office provides IHS data support.  RegAF or ARC candidates for FFHSR mobility positions 
must be worldwide qualified, meet IHS core competency requirements IAW AFI 44-162, and 
have a minimum of a Secret security clearance.  ARC members will not fill RegAF IHS mobility 
billets but may volunteer for unfilled current operations and crisis response FFHSR taskings by 
nomination from the RegAF ARC IHS liaison. 
 
2.8.  Assignment of IHS Personnel as Augmentees.  Personnel assigned to FFHSR are subject 
to deploy in support of military operations that take priority over local augmentation 
requirements.  Members assigned to FFHSR as primaries and alternates should not be assigned 
augmentation duties until all other eligible resources are exhausted.  
 
2.9.  Tasks.  IHS capabilities are tailored to the mission and operational context (e.g., 
specifically requested individual competencies or complete, exportable IHS generalist package).  
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
27 
The following are common tasks FFHSR performs in support of AFFOR, JTF, CJTF, or 
appropriate command.  Mission-specific tasks should be defined in the tasking order. 
 
2.9.1.  Diplomacy and Negotiation.  Multilateral health sector negotiations may involve a 
number of actors, including nations and other military and non-military stakeholders.  They 
cover many issues often under conditions with uncertain levels of trust.  Within their 
distinctive areas of expertise and applicable to US military objectives, FFHSR helps force 
commanders and medical advisors work through the key phases of multilateral negotiations 
(e.g., issue definition, fact-finding, bargaining, and agreement implementation, review, and 
strengthening) within a multi-cultural context. 
 
2.9.2.  Cross-Cultural Insight of the Area of Operations (AO).  FFHSR is a force 
enhancer that helps commanders assess the operational environment, health threat, and health 
activities within a cultural context. 
 
2.9.3.  Strategic Communication.  IHS members help force commanders, planners, and 
deployed medical personnel become aware of the cultural scripts involved in expeditionary, 
security cooperation, and health engagement activities to help ensure their transcultural 
instructional interactions will produce the desired results. 
 
2.9.4.  Foreign Language Proficiency Appropriate to the Area of Operations (AO).  IHS 
members incorporate language skill and regional expertise into operational or contingency 
medical planning and execution.  FFHSR provides foreign language proficiency directly or 
as an interface with interpreters hired to support AFMS and joint capabilities. 
 
2.9.5.  Cooperation with US and Foreign Government Agencies, National Health 
Systems, NGOs, IOs, and PVOs.  US and foreign government agencies and organizations, 
HN, IO, NGO, and PVO health planning and health delivery activities provide services and 
expertise that enhance or may be enhanced by US military capabilities.  Health sector 
stakeholders may have post-conflict or post-disaster capability, including presence on the 
ground as first-responders.  They have the flexibility to deliver services in a fast-changing 
environment and long-standing presence and understanding of the local environment, culture, 
and health systems.  The IHS team helps leverage relationships between the US military and 
these entities to deliver health activities that meet mission objectives and focus on unified 
action. 
 
2.9.5.1.  Leveraging AO Resources.  IHS UTCs engage with regional IHS personnel at 
C-NAFs and rescue coordination centers (RCCs) as well as interagency contacts to help 
develop a health sector common operating picture for each mission.  They use their 
expertise and contacts to engage with HN and regional military and civilian health 
experts as indicated to determine needs and appropriate activities. 
 
2.9.5.2.  Facilitating Inter-Agency Coordination.  Within their respective scope and 
operational sphere, IHS teams interface with other US and foreign government agencies, 
HN health workers, IOs, NGOs, and PVOs on behalf of the task force commander and 
medical leadership.  IHS teams can speak the language of civilian international health and 
28          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
humanitarian stakeholders and potentially enhance existing relationships or create new 
ones. 
 
2.9.6.  Foreign Humanitarian Assistance (FHA) and Disaster Relief (DR).  IHS may be 
tasked to augment medical planners and assessment teams in FHA/DR planning and 
execution.  The standard FFHSR UTC provides AO-specific forward and tactical skills, 
knowledge, and awareness to assist deployed commanders and expeditionary platforms (such 
as EMEDS) in dealing with a wide range of medical and humanitarian crises from acute 
issues to enduring complex emergencies.  When filled by a skilled O-5, FFHSR can support 
strategic and operational level headquarters assignments that require multi-agency, multi-
cultural interactions with the HN, other US and foreign government agencies, and NGOs. 
 
2.9.7.  Cultural Context for Expeditionary Response.  IHS advanced crisis leadership 
capabilities help commanders and health professionals cultivate cultural awareness, develop 
a vision for health engagement courses of action, develop and implement culturally 
acceptable risk communication and media products, build and maintain effective teams, and 
carry out cultural conflict management and negotiation.  Advised by a senior IHS member, 
theater and MAJCOM planners can tailor FFHSR augmentation capabilities to address a 
wide range of strategic and regional health issues and complexities and medical and health-
related humanitarian emergencies that may arise.  
 
2.9.8.  Global Public Health and Health Systems.  Many internationalist experts view 
infectious disease as potentially the largest threat to human security.  Basic public health 
practices such as sanitation, vaccinations, and hygiene are the best preventers of morbidity 
and mortality.  IHS teams have or know how to access a working knowledge of the 
capabilities and activities of local public health stakeholders.  IHS teams work at their 
respective levels with expert joint public and environmental health experts to protect the 
force and to determine potential areas and avenues of engagement with the HN to achieve 
mission objectives or enhance US national interests. 
 
2.9.9.  Air Force Medical Service Foundational and Core Competency.  IHS members 
must have a working knowledge of AFMS doctrinal principles and core competencies for 
expeditionary settings, such as command and control (C2), medical planning, FHP, AE, 
expeditionary medical systems, human performance and enhancements, and population 
health.  Global health competencies include medical logistics and administration, theater 
blood support, military support to civil authorities, and refugee support.  IHS personnel use 
this knowledge in support of the AFMS team and as a knowledge base for learning about, 
collaborating with, and advising PN air components on potential health engagement synergy, 
interoperability, and capacity development. 
 
2.9.10.  Force Health Protection.  IHS team members will meet all prescribed FHP 
measures IAW theater guidance and mission-specific requirements. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
29 
Section 2B—Operations 
 
2.10.  Deployment Planning and Management.  IHS personnel at all geographic and ARC 
headquarters provide expert input on GHE operational planning and management.  The C-NAF 
IHS team is responsible for providing or arranging provision of a qualified IHS representative 
early in the planning cycle, as requested by the C-NAF SG.  This representative must have the 
IHS SEI-required planning knowledge but is not required to be an R-prefix medical contingency 
planner.  The IHS representative may be designated the medical planner for a mission if qualified 
but more likely will work closely with and provide SME input to the designated medical or line 
planner to ensure that FFHSR UTCs are appropriately employed.  C-NAF IHS teams work 
closely with the IHS Program Office and pertinent MAJCOM IHS teams to ensure FFHSR UTCs 
identified in theater time-phased force deployment data (TPFDD) are in a constant state of 
readiness.  C-NAF team functional areas of responsibility include threat assessment, IHS role 
identification, determining mission-specific UTC capabilities and response, mission and 
operational readiness evaluations, and AEF organization and integration. 
 
2.11.  Deployment and Employment.  IHS personnel function as SME advisors and action 
officers for the deployed SG, DMC, or liaisons with security sector and civilian local and 
international health authorities.  FFHSR can be employed as an on-ground, forward-deployed 
headquarters (AFFOR, JTF, CJTF) asset to assist in mission planning and execution.  FFHSR 
may also be attached to tactical assets such as EMEDS, Air Advisor Teams, and a variety of Air 
Force or joint elements involved in health engagement activities.  The team becomes part of the 
appropriate gaining AFFOR, JTF, or CJTF command element from time of deployment to the 
point of redeployment.  FFHSR has no stand-alone capability but is involved in the full spectrum 
of operations.  A senior FFHSR filled by a skilled O-5 may be deployed to meet specific 
requirements for IHS core competencies to support USG, CCDR, and AFMS engagements with 
the international medical and humanitarian response communities.  This individual may be 
employed to support a rear-area headquarters (combatant command, MAJCOM, AFFOR, JTF, 
CJTF, or coalition headquarters), a civilian equivalent such as an embassy country team or UN 
health cluster, or a survey team such as a humanitarian assistance survey team (HAST). 
 
2.11.1.  AEF Support to Theater Contingency Plans.  FFHSR UTCs are elements of 
TPFDD that operational and logistics planners use to route forces to meet theater deliberate 
planning requirements.  As standard FF series force packages, FFHSR UTCs are listed in the 
unit type code availability (UTA) database for Air Staff, theater planners, and MAJCOMs to 
use in deliberate and crisis action planning and AEF theater support.  
 
2.11.2.  Support to Multi-Agency HA Response.  Within the scope of its capabilities, 
FFHSR can be deployed to support multi-agency pre-crisis planning, crisis action planning, 
and response for HA missions such as refugee and displaced persons support, priority direct 
patient services, management and triage of mass populations, disease surveillance and 
control, and HIV/AIDS and other communicable disease prevention.  FFHSR can help task 
force commanders with assigning health support responsibilities and identifying health 
challenges and courses of action at the strategic planning and area-specific mission planning 
levels.  FFHSR can facilitate task force interfaces with civil support, US, and foreign 
government agencies and IOs. 
30          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
 
2.11.3.  Support for Security Cooperation.  Within the sphere and scope of its capability, 
FFHSR can leverage its health cooperation and diplomacy skills to support theater security 
cooperation activities.  IHS personnel assist in devising and executing phase 0 country and 
regional health engagement strategies that help build partnerships and partnership capacity in 
the security and civilian health sectors.  FFHSR may support medical elements of JCS, 
combatant command, component, and coalition campaigns, operations, and exercises to 
include peacetime MEDCAP and MEDRETE activities.  IHS personnel have the knowledge 
to help transform these types of missions from simple, short-term, direct care activities to 
comprehensive health engagements that create a foundation for enduring BP and BPC and 
meeting CCDR objectives. 
 
2.11.4.  Support to Medical Stability Operations (MSO).  FFHSR can provide medical 
support to stability operations in permissive and non-permissive environments.  The health 
sectors in areas and countries that suffer instability typically are rudimentary.  Low-level 
public health interventions (sanitation, clean water, immunizations, and basic health 
attention) have been shown to have the biggest impacts on overall reduction of local 
morbidity and mortality.  FFHSR can help commanders and planners prepare, plan, execute, 
and transition operations and projects that best support the MSO mission to optimize the use 
of time and resources.  See JP 3-07 for more information on stability operations. 
 
2.11.5.  Civil-Military Operations.  IHS personnel work to cultivate relationships with 
USAID, DHHS, DOS, health-related NGOs, and other organizations.  They are familiar with 
joint civil affairs capabilities and can function in collaboration with or embedded with civil 
affairs teams in developing and executing medical civil-military operations (CMO).  Through 
reachback and relationships with USG civilian partners and on-ground, in-country interaction 
with civilian organizations and health experts, IHS personnel can build medical bridges that 
enhance and support partnerships to achieve commander objectives. 
 
2.11.6.  IHS Support to EMEDS.  FFHSR can be tasked with EMEDS HRT to provide 
planning, liaison, and execution support for EMEDS operations that involve foreign nationals 
or other organizations outside of DOD (e.g., FHA/DR, security cooperation, MSO, and BP).  
While FFHSR personnel typically engage in execution and liaison activities more than 
planning activities at the employed location, they should continue to review OPLANs.  They 
should advocate for and assist with adjustments as the situation warrants and be actively 
involved in any new planning that occurs.  As liaisons for the facility, they focus on gaining 
knowledge of and building relationships with HN and other health care organizations in the 
AOR and with the support and direction of the commander work to foster interoperability. 
 
2.12.  Redeployment.  During the redeployment phase, IHS teams provide coordination between 
new and departing counterparts and provide continuity and maintenance of medical information 
related to local and multinational health capabilities.  A primary role of the IHS team is to help 
optimize the transition from US military health operations to HN or other agency leads, as 
appropriate. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
31 
Section 2C—Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence 
 
2.13.  Command and Control (C2).  The chain of command for expeditionary medical teams is 
through the line of the Air Force as outlined in Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-0, Operations and 
Planning, and Annex 3-30, Command and Control.  IHS assets are integrated within the task 
force structure established to support the contingency operation.  IHS-specific items are outlined 
in the operation order (OPORD) in Annex C.  Annex Q contains general IHS support guidance.   
 
2.13.1.  Component Numbered Air Forces (C-NAFs).  C-NAFs with full-time IHS personnel 
assigned in the unit manning document will be tasked with requirements for FFHSR in their 
designed operational capability (DOC) statements.  C-NAFs will use personnel and training 
data to report IHS deployment capabilities and shortfalls in the Status of Resources and 
Training System (SORTS) and AEF Reporting Tool (ART).  C-NAFs will use the ART to 
evaluate UTC capability and status. 
 
2.13.2.  IHS Program Office, Air Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA/SG3XI).  The 
IHS Program Office serves as the focal point and functional manager for the IHS SEI and 
maintains a database of personnel information and training completion records of AFMS 
personnel holding IHS SEIs other than those individuals already assigned to a full-time IHS 
position on a C-NAF unit manning document (UMD).  These personnel may be available for 
AEF and crisis-action deployment tasking when the C-NAFs cannot source the requirement.  
The IHS Program Office validates IHS capabilities-based requirements to ensure availability of 
IHS personnel to support worldwide expeditionary operations and coordinates with the Air and 
Space Expeditionary Force Center (AEFC) for FFHSR and individual IHS augmentation 
deployments. 
 
2.13.3.  Deployed Commands.  Deployed commanders from the joint or combined task force 
level to an individual EMEDS unit may call for regional or globally focused IHS support.  C-
NAF/MAJCOM IHS teams, the IHS Program Office, and ARC liaisons are closely involved 
with Air Force and joint command planners to ensure appropriate tasking of IHS resources in 
deployment and exercise plans.  Unless stated otherwise in MAJCOM reporting instructions, 
the deployed US air component commander will exercise operational control (OPCON) and 
administrative control (ADCON) of IHS personnel in direct support of non-special operations 
ground and naval forces.  OPCON and ADCON of deployed AFSOC IHS personnel will be 
exercised through the deployed special operations command. 
 
2.14.  Communication Requirements.  FFHSR does not deploy with its own communications 
equipment and relies on the element to which they are assigned or attached for support.  FFHSR 
requires access to the Defense Switched Network (DSN), secure voice communication, 
Nonsecure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), and Secret Internet Protocol Router 
Network (SIPRNET).  Depending on the mission, FFHSR may require land mobile radios 
(LMRs) to communicate with supported deployed medical facilities and international enabled 
mobile or satellite phone capability.  Ideally, IHS communication requirements should be 
clarified and requested during pre-deployment planning. 
 
32          
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014 
 
2.15.  Intelligence.  At the employment location, IHS teams receive medical intelligence reports 
through the theater medical director or the task force medical advisor.  Medical intelligence also 
may be gathered from other sources such as NCMI, other USG agencies, IOs, NGOs, and the 
private sector. 
 
Section 2D—Security 
 
2.16.  Site Security and Arming of Medical Personnel.  Medical personnel and equipment are 
non-combatant assets as defined by the Geneva Conventions and the Law of Armed Conflict 
(LOAC).  Medical personnel and war reserve materiel (WRM) assemblages are protected IAW 
AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.  Local security measures are outlined in the Integrated Defense 
Plan.  Medical personnel are authorized arms IAW AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air 
Force Personnel.  To maintain non-combatant status, IHS may provide site security only within 
the immediate area of their medical facility or if patients are present. 
 
2.17.  Operations Security (OPSEC).  IHS personnel must protect mission-critical information 
IAW CCDR OPSEC policy and AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC).  Classified 
information must be transmitted by secure means and protected IAW AFI 31-401.  Situation 
reports (SITREPs), medical surveillance, site locations, and compiled patient data are examples 
of information that may be classified. 
 
2.18.  Information Assurance (IA) Policy.  IHS members must understand and follow IA 
procedures, to include communications security (COMSEC) and computer security 
(COMPUSEC), IAW AFI 33-200, Information Assurance (IA) Management, AFMAN 33-282, 
Computer Security (COMPUSEC), and associated Air Force IA guidance. 
 
2.19.  Security of Weapons and Ammunition.  IHS members may maintain issued weapons 
and ammunition when authorized.  Weapons and ammunition must be secured IAW AFI 31-101, 
AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual, and local procedures. 
 
Section 2E—Integration and Interoperability 
 
2.20.  Integration of IHS Personnel into the Full Spectrum of Operations.  IHS personnel 
who are assigned or deployed to theaters of operation can be involved in pre-deployment, 
deployment, and redeployment phases.  The global health capabilities and prior activities of IHS 
personnel in the theater can provide the CCDR with medical guidance and critical information to 
enhance operations.  As AFMS assets interface with global health systems in the different AORs, 
IHS personnel can build and solidify HN relationships that can be leveraged by the regional 
commands in security cooperation, ongoing operations of any type, or contingency response 
operations.  IHS personnel train to integrate smoothly into joint and USG interagency operations 
and UTCs to include assignment within another Service unit. 
 
2.21.  Interoperability in the Area of Responsibility (AOR).  IHS personnel provide a basic 
knowledge of the foreign aeromedical assets in the country or AOR and interoperability with Air 
Force assets.  Specialized medical expert exchanges may be arranged to provide subject matter 
expertise for information exchange and training when requested by a host country.  Agenda 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
33 
items are pre-coordinated through discussions between the AFMS interface with the host country 
and are designed to help enhance HN capabilities. 
 
Section 2F—Training 
 
2.22.  Training Requirements.  Initial and sustainment training are required to maintain the 
operational and clinical capability of IHS personnel.  FFHSR members must meet all initial 
training requirements and complete sustainment training IAW AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness 
Program Management, and the Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP) before they can 
deploy in an IHS team role.  These requirements are not waiverable. 
 
2.23.  Mobility Assignment Criteria.  FFHSR positions are initially filled by full-time IHS 
personnel stationed at the appropriate geographic command or numbered Air Force for the 
deployment or exercise location.  The request for forces (RFF) owner should contact the IHS 
Program Office for assistance if manpower needs exceed the capabilities of the geographic 
command or numbered Air Forces.  The program office maintains a list of IHS SEI holders with 
specific language capability and geographical area expertise who may not be in IHS billets.  If 
they are unable to identify or receive permission to deploy an individual from this list, the RFF 
owner can request members from MTFs with an assigned FFHSR regardless of language or 
regional experience. 
 
2.24.  Unit Type Code (UTC) Training.  FFHSR training consists of the following elements:  
 
2.24.1.  AFSC-specific core RSVP and other medical readiness training IAW AFI 41-106. 
 
2.24.2.  EMEDS training every three years. 
 
2.24.3.  IHS core competencies required for SEI 452 or H8A, H8B, or H8C IAW AFI 44-
162.  Maintenance of skills training is tracked by the IHS Program Office and is required 
annually. 
 
2.24.4.  Additional training as dictated by regional or mission-specific requirements, global 
employment of the force, TCPs, Air Force campaign support plan, GHE guidance, and DOS 
mission program plans. 
 
2.25.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Training.  All 
personnel subject to deployment must receive CBRN defense training IAW AFI 41-106 and AFI 
10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations.  All 
personnel should be familiar with the concepts of counter-chemical warfare as outlined in 
AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield 
Explosive (CBRNE) Environment. 
 
2.26.  Other Training Platforms.  The Office of the Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG) has 
worked to develop training opportunities in collaboration with the Air Force Culture and 
Language Center (AFCLC), other Services, and within the interagency civilian sector through 
the IHS Program Office and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.  IHS

personnel have taken advantage of training offered at such diverse venues as Johns-Hopkins 
University (Health Emergencies in Large Populations Course), the Foreign Language Training 
Center Europe, George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, the US Agency for 
International Development’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (Joint Humanitarian 
Operations Course), Disaster Assistance Response Team training, and the Center of Excellence 
in Disaster Management (Combined Humanitarian Assistance Response Training). 
 
Section 2G—Logistics 
 
2.27.  Expeditionary Combat Support and Base Operating Support (ECS/BOS).  FFHSR is 
not a stand-alone UTC and requires ECS/BOS from the gaining command.  ECS/BOS 
requirements include but not limited to billeting, messing and other consumable materials, 
power, water, ice, latrines, showers, laundry, waste management, exterior lighting, 
transportation, fuels, vehicle maintenance, equipment maintenance, general supplies, contracting, 
information and communications systems support, mortuary affairs, public affairs, chaplain, 
linguist, personnel and vehicle decontamination, and security.  If an FFHSR away mission 
terminates at a location different from the host command or deployed IHS team’s location, the 
senior member will ensure the team receives necessary support while it awaits transportation.  If 
IHS teams are separated from the host command, the senior IHS member will contact the base 
command post to obtain necessary support until the team returns to its assigned location.  See 
Attachment 2 for quantified estimates on ECS/BOS requirements.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK 
 
A3.1.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is fundamental in the planning, execution, and 
assessment of AFMS GHE.  Approximately 10 percent of a program budget may be required for 
M&E.  Assessments should include both measure of performance (MOP) and measure of 
effectiveness (MOE).  MOP (or outputs) can be defined as a measure of how well the stated tasks 
were accomplished.  MOE (or outcomes) can be defined as a measure of the impact and 
effectiveness of the accomplished task. 
 
A3.2.  The objectives should be driven by and account for the views and opinions of both the HN 
and local community and agreed upon (to the extent possible) by key stakeholders.  Local 
personnel and resources should be used to the extent possible.  The long-term goal is that local 
personnel will assume ownership of the program. 
 
A3.3.  The role of each team member should be defined in writing.  This will help ensure that 
expectations are reasonable and achievable, form a basis for M&E, and establish a basis for the 
training of HN personnel. 
 
A3.4.  Program planning steps should include the following: 
 
 Determine need for the program or activity 
 Determine objectives (i.e., output and outcome) 
 Obtain appropriate funding 
 Design activities (include plans for both output and outcome measures) 
 Control resources (e.g., funding, manpower, equipment, infrastructure) 
 Conduct activities 
 Assess outputs and outcomes 
 
A3.5.  While there is no standardized methodology for assessment within DOD, the USG, or 
across the NGOs, the M&E logic model shown in Figure A3-1 is gaining increased acceptance as 
a framework for program planning and evaluation.  It can be used to link activity with CCDR 
security cooperation objectives, address MOPs (outputs), and evaluate effectiveness (short-term, 
intermediate, and long-term outcomes).

FUNDING GUIDANCE 
 
A4.1.  In general, Defense Health Program (DHP) funds are not used for execution of GHE or 
HA/DR activities.  Various sources of funding exist for mission execution.  Coordinate with your 
functional manager to determine funding and to program for use of combatant command or C-
NAF funds.  
 
A4.2.  For GHE, DHP funds can be used for training of personnel and for temporary duty (TDY) 
assignments directly related to the primary mission of the AFMS, including international travel.  
Funding requests for GHE activities for the objective of training AFMS personnel must be vetted 
through the Force Development and Medical Readiness Panels for approval and prioritization. 
 
A4.3.  The following questions must be answered before considering DHP dollar use: 
 
 Does the expense bear a logical relationship to the DHP appropriation and make a 
direct contribution to an authorized AFMS function?  Answer must be yes. 
 
 Is the expenditure prohibited by law? Answer must be no. 
 
 Does the expenditure fall within the scope of another appropriation or statutory funding 
scheme or is it otherwise provided for in a different appropriation?  Answer must be 
no. 
 
A4.4.  The following are frequently asked questions regarding use of DHP dollars for GHE:  
 
 Q1:  I am on a combatant command/C-NAF staff.  Can DHP dollars be used for my 
ongoing training? 
 
A1:  Yes.  DHP dollars can be used for continuing military education and other activities 
outlined above.  Line dollars should be used for mission-related TDY assignments. 
 
 Q2:  I need to travel to the combatant command for the annual Theater Cooperation 
Synchronization meeting.  These meetings are unit funded.  Who pays for me? 
 
A2:  If there are no dedicated funds from the combatant command or C-NAF for this 
requirement, then the use of DHP dollars is permissible. 
 
 Q3:  I did not complete all my IHS training before reporting to my new duty station 
(combatant command/C-NAF.)  Can DHP pay for this? 
 
A3:  Yes.  However, approval must be obtained from AFMSA/SG3XI first for any 
training that is not on the approved course list. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.9  25 NOVEMBER 2014         
47 
 Q4.  We would like to use some of our DHP training dollars for an exercise in another 
country where there would be less need to simulate limiting factors (LIMFACs).  Is this 
legal? 
A4:  Maybe.  You must demonstrate a bona fide need of why this cannot be simulated locally.  
Caveat:  There are currently no concrete training objectives delineated that satisfy the bona fide 
need mandate to train in a foreign country.
