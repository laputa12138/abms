This pamphlet supports AFI 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) Program, 
and AFI 10-211, Civil Engineer Contingency Response Planning. This volume describes the Air 
Force civil engineer’s role in establishing and operating a bare base. It lists civil engineer tasks 
involved in the forward projection of airpower, with emphasis on the use of Basic Expeditionary 
Airfield Resources (BEAR). This volume is of particular importance to engineers and mobility 
team chiefs responsible for initial beddown planning and execution at bare base and forward 
operating locations. The volume makes frequent reference to volumes in the Air Force Handbook 
10-222-series and applicable technical orders for additional information. Refer recommended 
changes and questions about this publication to the office of primary responsibility using the AF 
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication: route AF Form 847s from the field 
through the appropriate functional chain of command and Major Command (MAJCOM) 
publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed 
in this publication are maintained according to AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and 
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at 
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. The use of the name or mark of any 
specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not

AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This document is substantially revised and should be completely reviewed. Of particular 
significance: it replaces legacy (Harvest Eagle/Falcon) assets with BEAR throughout; addresses 
recommended water use rates for bare base beddowns; updates ancillary equipment; transitions 
from BEAR to BEAR Order of Battle asset management and equipment configurations; and adds 
information on contract force multipliers including the Air Force Contract Augmentation 
Program. Also addresses civil engineer (CE) task standards and planning factors such as 
manpower, materials and equipment for potential contingency tasks. Additionally, engineer 
quick reference sheets were included to provide engineers with bare base planning information 
and examples in a quick reference format.

Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION TO BARE BASE PLANNING 
1.1.  Purpose.  To support modern air, space and cyberspace operations and meet requirements 
for rapid deployment, expeditionary airbase planners must understand and employ sound 
planning principles. This volume was developed to provide deployment data and employment 
information to engineer and logistic planners, field units and others involved in bare base 
activities. A bare base is defined as a base having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain 
and support operations to include (if required) a stabilized runway, taxiways, aircraft parking 
areas, and have a source of water that can be made potable. Specifically, this volume provides a 
comprehensive collection of information and illustrations related to construction, erection, 
operations and maintenance of bare base facilities and equipment (Figure 1.1). The intent is to 
provide deploying and deployed personnel, particularly planners, the ability to plan for multiple 
austere locations and to procure beddown assets. 
Figure 1.1.  Bare Base Facilities and Equipment 
 
1.2.  Scope.  The information in this volume supports implementation of Air Force Policy 
Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness, and contains tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for 
use by civil engineers in supporting precepts outlined in Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 
4-0, Combat Support and AFDD 3-34, Engineer Operations. This relationship is illustrated in the 
Air Force CE hierarchy of publications (Figure 1.2). Engineer planners and others may find the 
information in this volume is most helpful when used as a starting point for planning a bare base 
or supporting austere locations. While each location has its own special requirements and 
features, there are commonalities that will not change despite the location. The base and facility 
layouts, facility guide matrices, utility layouts and drawings in this volume can be used and 
adapted to meet almost any site-specific location. This volume highlights key features and 
considerations associated with Air Force bare base planning; provides a concept of employment 
and a sequence for bare base construction; and serves as a road map that leads bare base planners 
from the initial response phase to the material acquisition phase. It is a checklist to ensure each 
crucial action that affects the base’s ability to function effectively is taken. This volume may not 
present the final or specific solution to a given problem. It is not expected to anticipate or solve 
all problems that might be encountered during beddowns. It simply addresses problems most 
  12  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
likely encountered and gives guidance so important aspects of the task will not be overlooked. 
While this conceptual planning pamphlet was developed for use anywhere in the world, it deals 
most heavily with the Southwest Asia (SWA) theater of operations. It primarily addresses bare 
base locations that have little to no host nation support. 
Figure 1.2.  Air Force Civil Engineer Publications Hierarchy 
 
1.3.  Background.  The shifting global geopolitical dynamics, closure of many main operating 
bases (MOB) overseas and the reluctance of many nations to permit permanent military bases on 
their soil have limited the basing options for United States (US) forces during contingency 
operations. This situation has increased the importance of the bare base concept as a viable 
solution to contingency basing shortfalls and requirements. 
1.3.1.  A bare base must be capable of supporting assigned aircraft and providing mission-
essential resources. These resources include logistical support and service to the 
infrastructure composed of people, facilities, equipment and supplies. The bare base concept 
requires mobile facilities, utilities and support equipment that can be rapidly deployed and 
installed. Bare base equipment can transform undeveloped real estate into an operational air 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  13  
base virtually overnight. Fortunately, these kinds of assets have undergone more than five 
decades of intense research and development. The search for stronger, lighter-weight, and 
more efficient facilities and equipment continues today as new technological advances are 
being discovered. These advances will continually move the bare base concept into new areas 
unimaginable today. To help guide future actions, it is important to know the history of the 
bare base process. 
1.3.2.  Early requirements for mobile air bases arose with the advent of air warfare during 
World War II. This mobility concept specified that ground forces advance in increments by 
surface means. The advancing force had to conduct offensive operations while 
simultaneously establishing new operating bases (Figure 1.3). The tactical air units moved 
from one forward operating base to another in order to keep up with and provide air support 
for the advancing troops. These units had two choices—build base facilities as protection 
from contingency and environmental elements or erect substandard facilities such as tents 
and perform maintenance out in the open. This cycle repeated itself whenever battle zones 
changed. Similar challenges were experienced during the Korean Conflict in the 1950s. 
Figure 1.3.  Dozer Clearing an Airfield in World War II 
 
1.3.3.  It was not until the 1950s that military planners developed techniques to prepackage 
base support equipment. This World War II equipment consisted mainly of tents and related 
accessories, field kitchens, medical facilities, generators and other assorted equipment. It was 
bulky, heavy and required excessive labor-hours to layout, assemble and erect. This initial 
deployment kit was nicknamed Gray Eagle. In the mid-1960s, more equipment was added. 
Some items were redesigned to make them more air transportable, and the name was changed 
to Harvest Eagle. Harvest Eagle has been tested many times in worldwide deployments 
including Southeast Asia. 
1.3.4.  A new mobility concept was developed in the late 1960s. Under this concept, all 
facilities and equipment would be lightweight, modular and C-130 transportable. Some 
shelters would be hardwall and serve as their own shipping containers. Some of the mobility 
hardware would interface with weapons systems while other hardware would be developed to 
take care of housing, messing, infrastructure support and civil engineer (CE) needs. This 
  14  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
concept would have everything needed to support a deployed force in the most austere 
environment. To test this concept, EXERCISE CORONET BARE was launched in October 
1969 to evaluate this new prototype equipment package. In November 1970, a full-scale 
deployment exercise successfully tested the bare base mobility concept of being operational 
within 72 hours. After successful validation, the program became known as Harvest Bare. 
1.3.5.  Another iteration of bare base facility history occurred in the early 1980s. To support 
the AF portion of the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force, the forerunner of US Central 
Command, the services made a major equipment purchase. Instead of procuring duplicate 
Harvest Bare packages, a mix of hard- and soft-walled facilities was obtained. This facility 
mix was lighter to airlift and eliminated several facilities that had maintenance problems in 
previous deployments. In addition to facility and utility systems, this new bare base package, 
nicknamed Harvest Falcon, contained several other major components. Typical of these 
components were vehicles, engineer equipment, unique tactical shelters, medical facilities 
and equipment and mobile flightline maintenance equipment. These Harvest Falcon packages 
provided support for several major multi-national exercises in the 1980s and during the Gulf 
War in 1990-91. 
1.3.6.  Today, the bare base concept for expeditionary airbases is as important as ever. While 
many foreign countries resist development of major fixed installations on their soil, they still 
possess airfields that could be offered to US forces during contingencies. There are hundreds 
of locations in the world that can support air operations, although many have limited and 
inadequate infrastructure. The AF must have the capability to deploy to and operate from 
available locations regardless of the current infrastructure. The majority of US bare base 
assets are prepositioned overseas for SWA support. A small number of assets are available at 
Holloman AFB, New Mexico for worldwide support. 
1.3.7.  The current Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) mobility concept is to deploy an 
expeditionary force rapidly, complete with facilities and related equipment, capable of 
independently supporting sustained combat operations (Figure 1.4). However, some support 
operations may have to exist as austere, because receipt of some support infrastructure may 
lag by a month or more. This is usually the case with support of joint forces, such as Army 
and Marine units and special operations forces. Expedient facilities provide the means for 
operating in initial austere locations. In 2002, deployments to Afghanistan reaffirmed the 
versatility of the bare base concept when captured airfields were quickly transformed into 
operational locations for use by multi-national forces. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  15  
Figure 1.4.  Prime Power Generators Support Sustained Operations 
 
1.4.  Planning Process.  The ambitious expeditionary mobility concept presents problems and 
challenges to planners, engineers and field units who have the ultimate responsibility of bare 
base development. The challenge is twofold for planners, who must consider both AF 
requirements and joint deployment requirements. The implications for joint planning and 
integration are discussed in further detail in AFPAM 10-219 Volume 6, Planning and Design of 
Expeditionary Airbases. In many cases, a bare base may support or host other US forces, allied 
military units and host nation agencies. These co-occupants can present planners with many 
challenges, since responsibilities and jurisdictional areas will have to be determined. Factors 
such as facility usage, equipment allocation, utilities and labor must also be worked out to the 
agreement of all parties. These challenges have an immediate effect on the mission; therefore 
planners must address them early in the bare base development process. The challenges could 
affect such features as airlift flow of bare base assets, construction sequence, projected use of 
local materials and the allocation of mobile facilities. 
1.4.1.  Additional data should be gathered to supplement this conceptual planning pamphlet 
since site-specific characteristics are important factors in the planning process. Existing 
facilities, airfield configuration, topography, climate, soil conditions, concept of operations 
and indigenous materials and available labor are some of the unknown characteristics that 
must be considered. The numbered AEF that deploys either a wing or other support force has 
primary responsibility for developing site-specific layouts. For potential bare base locations 
named in operational plans (OPLANs), advance echelon (ADVON) teams are responsible for 
site-specific planning. ADVONs are deployed ahead of the larger deploying force and may 
be included in the time-phased force deployment list (TPFDL). For short-notice deployments 
that have not been preplanned except in a concept plan (CONPLAN), the first unit on the 
scene is usually responsible for site-specific planning. The CONPLAN is an operation plan in 
an abbreviated format that requires considerable expansion or alteration to convert it into an 
OPLAN. Planners may have to gather additional site-specific data from intelligence sources 
  16  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
or first-hand observation prior to laying out their plans. This is important since a well-
planned and executed deployment hinges on the planner’s ability to produce a comprehensive 
site layout, complete to the last detail. 
1.4.2.  One of the first pieces of information that must be gathered is the threat analysis for 
the bare base location. This information is normally available through the wing intelligence 
office. Planners must know whether the base is in a high-, medium-, or low-threat area. The 
reasons are threefold: (1) Aircraft must be able to survive while on the ground. (2) Aircraft 
must be able to get airborne to perform their mission during or after an attack. (3) Logistics 
infrastructure must survive to sustain air operations. The threat analysis will determine 
whether individual facilities and facility groups will be positioned in a dispersed or non-
dispersed layout. It will also determine whether electrical and water plants will be dispersed 
or centrally located and whether revetments and airfield damage repair (ADR) sets will be 
required. In some of the forward and higher threat areas, it may be necessary to plan for 
camouflage, hardening, or even decontamination capabilities. 
1.4.3.  Topography and weather data should reveal prevailing wind direction and expected 
velocity, temperature ranges and humidity, annual rainfall, natural slope of the terrain, soil 
characteristics and latitude and longitude of the bare base site. This data is required to 
properly site the sewage lagoon downwind, determine heating and air conditioning 
requirements, restrict construction in natural water drainage areas during flash flooding, 
determine absorption rates of the soil and locate facilities in a way that minimizes shadows 
that can be detected through aerial reconnaissance. 
1.4.4.  It is important to know about the existing facilities and utilities in the preliminary 
planning stage. Consequently, any layouts, drawings, aerial photographs, etc., are vitally 
needed. Equally important are the lengths and widths of the existing runway(s), taxiways, 
ramps and aprons. Does runway lighting exist? If so, is it operational and adequate? Is there a 
requirement for an aircraft arresting system? What kinds of water sources are available? Is 
the water fresh, brackish, or salt water? Does it come from a well, river, or the ocean? What 
is its water temperature and how far away is the source? Is the area flood-prone or in a low-
lying area subject to flooding or high water during heavy rains? There are many more 
questions and the more answers we get, the better prepared we are to meet mission 
objectives. 
1.4.5.  Having accumulated as much site data as possible, begin mapping out the specific 
details on the base plans. Following guidance in this volume, planners must develop each of 
the different elements, keeping in mind that this volume generally discusses the “worst case” 
scenario. For example, a five-day water supply is required for the base populace. This water 
may be pumped from a non-potable source several miles away, purified with reverse osmosis 
units and stored in collapsible bladders. If, however, the planner discovers on-site purified 
water in sufficient quantities, the requirement for water production equipment decreases 
significantly. 
1.4.6.  Priorities cannot be overemphasized during bare base development. The allocation of 
engineering resources must be balanced between mission essential and force beddown 
taskings. Thus, commanders of various organizations at all echelons must understand the 
importance of establishing clear mission priorities. Increased engineer requirements, 
especially during the base erection phase, could spread engineer resources too sparsely. For 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  17  
example, this volume recommends that base organizations erect their own shelters with 
minimum technical guidance from engineer personnel (Figure 1.5). If this practice is 
circumvented by tasking engineers to erect shelters for everyone, it may cause significant 
delay in accomplishing other critical tasks and be detrimental to overall mission 
accomplishment. Another consideration is quality-of-life taskings that always seem to 
surface during deployments. Typical Gulf War examples include repairing swimming pools 
and building recreational facilities and gazebos. These conveniences are obviously not too 
much to provide people who are risking their lives. However, quality of life tasks alone could 
have a drastic effect on civil engineers’ ability to work on mission-essential tasks. 
Figure 1.5.  Medical Personnel Erect Shelters for Medical Support Operations 
 
1.4.7.  This publication highlights a variety of planning factors for particular topics. These 
factors are included to show the requirements that must be considered for a location that 
transitions from an austere combat contingency location to a short term bare base and then to 
a more permanent, long-duration bare base. Bare base equipment packages are frequently 
reconfigured to remove antiquated and unserviceable equipment and replace it with new 
equipment as technology advances. Successful bare base planning and development must 
remain flexible to inevitable changes. 
1.4.8.  Successfully erecting a bare base within a predetermined time schedule depends on 
many factors controlled outside of engineer channels: 
1.4.8.1.  Mobility assets must arrive in proper quantities and sequence. This is great for 
planning, but planners understand that most mobility assets DO NOT arrive in the proper 
quantities and sequence. No matter how good the plan or how far in advance notice is 
given, it just does not happen. Remain flexible and react to the situation as it develops. 
1.4.8.2.  Motorized support equipment, such as forklifts and trucks, must be available in 
the required quantities. Be prepared to share equipment and take care of it. 
1.4.8.3.  Craftsmen should be trained to erect, operate and maintain as much of the bare 
base equipment as possible. Since craftsmen do not typically work with these assets at 
  18  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
home station, progress will likely be slow at first. However, as personnel become more 
familiar with the equipment their proficiency should increase quite rapidly. 
1.4.9.  Plan for success. Leadership, high-technology weapons, quality troops, sound 
planning and a long lead-time have contributed to US and coalition forces’ successes during 
past contingency operations. Planners should review the assessments, after action reports and 
lessons learned from previous deployments to plan for the next one. Other factors to consider 
when planning engineer operations include: type of construction material available in theater, 
the construction standards required and availability of host nation resources and 
multinational forces. 
1.4.10.  Resource Planning Options. Several force multipliers are available to augment civil 
engineer, force protection and logistics capabilities during worldwide contingency 
operations. These contract tools and reach-back capabilities can provide significant relief to 
commanders, particularly over extended periods. 
1.4.10.1.  Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP). Although principally 
intended to support contingencies and humanitarian efforts, AFCAP resources may also 
be used, to a limited extent, during major combat operations. This cost-plus, award fee 
contract offers virtually all capabilities within AF CE, Force Protection and Logistics 
functional areas (Figure 1.6). AFCAP has standing agreements with a number of 
contractors and vendors to provide specific support and consequently can provide skilled 
labor, extensive quantities of equipment and materials under short lead times. AFCAP 
support generally includes: 
1.4.10.1.1.  Base recovery after natural disasters, accidents and terrorist attacks. 
1.4.10.1.2.  Sustainment operations for all noncombatant operations to include 
construction. 
1.4.10.1.3.  Asset reconstitution at user-level during contingency operations. 
1.4.10.1.4.  All types of restoration, except those involving major environmental 
damage. 
1.4.10.1.5.  Backfills vacancies for home base forces at equal or greater skill levels 
during deployments.

1.4.10.2.  AFCESA Reach-back Center. Another very valuable force multiplier for 
expeditionary and day-to-day operations is the civil engineer Reach-back Center at HQ 
AFCESA at Tyndall AFB FL. Since April 2005, the RBC has answered over 25,000 
inquiries on contingency, expeditionary and base-level operations. It provides methods, 
templates, checklists, criteria, lessons learned and assistance on the agency’s subject 
matter expertise. The RBC can be contacted via phone at 888-AFCESA1, stateside DSN 
at 523-6995, or international DSN at 312-523-6995. E-mails can be sent to

1.4.10.3.  Other Service Resources. The US Army and US Navy have established contract 
augmentation programs similar to AFCAP. 
1.4.10.3.1.  The Army uses the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) to 
augment its forces during wartime. LOGCAP provides for preplanned used of global 
corporate resources to free up soldiers to perform combat arms missions. With proper 
preplanning, coordination and training, it can support other services, federal agencies 
and coalition partners. LOGCAP has been used in Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti and 
East Timor. Army Material Command Pamphlet 700-30, LOGCAP, outlines 
procedures for commanders to follow when requesting and implementing these 
services. 
1.4.10.3.2.  The Navy uses the Global Contingency Construction Contract and the 
Global Contingency Service Contract to allow contract augmentation to quickly 
respond and provide supervision, equipment, materials and labor in response to 
natural disasters, humanitarian assistance needs and worldwide conflict. These 
programs, and predecessor programs, have been used in operations as diverse as 
Djibouti (Africa), Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, California (wildfire response) and New 
Orleans (post Hurricane Katrina). For additional information on these resources,

Chapter 2 
BARE BASE PLANNING GUIDELINES 
2.1.  Introduction.  Just like a construction project, the bare base planning process requires a 
foundation upon which to build the plan. In this case, the foundation consists of key assumptions 
and planning guidelines. An assumption is a statement accepted as true without proof or 
demonstration. Bare base assumptions are made in order to provide a common point of 
discussion. Detailed planning might, in some situations, prove some of these assumptions wrong. 
A planning guideline, on the other hand, is a combination of JCS planning factors, Air Staff 
guidance, results of expeditionary site planning studies and technical information obtained from 
publications and field experience (Figure 2.1). For the most part, the planning guidelines 
presented in this chapter assist planners in determining the type and amount of resources 
necessary to establish a bare base. Refer to AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and 
Execution, for additional planning guidance. 
Figure 2.1.  Elements of Bare Base Planning 
 
2.2.  Assumptions.  The following basic assumptions provide a common departure point for 
conducting planning. The items are generally considered valid for a bare base situation. 
2.2.1.  Runway and taxiways are adequate to support or be repairable to support minimum 
weapon system operations. 
2.2.2.  Minimum (aircraft) on Ground (MOG) 2 - 24 hr Ops (C-17). 
2.2.3.  Water source that can be made potable. 
2.2.4.  Jet fuel and ground fuel are available from host nation with limited storage at location. 
  22  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
2.2.5.  General purpose vehicles are available from host nation.

Group (49 MMG) will erect technically complex facilities, such as Aircraft Hangars (ACH), 
Dome Shelters, and Large Area Maintenance Shelters (LAMS). 
2.3.  Bare Base Force Module Planning.  Global engagement has transformed the way the AF 
views combat support and the requirements to ensure that decisive combat power is readily 
available. Key features of the subsequent AF doctrine are agile combat support (ACS) and Air 
and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) “force modules.” ACS presents capabilities in a 
building block or modular/scalable approach, which prepares assets for quick response and 
allows positioning of forces within the required response time. Assets flow incrementally, and 
force beddown is effectively established. The AF developed a force module concept that tailors 
force packages to specific expeditionary tasks and allows systematic presentation of capabilities 
to rapidly open an airfield, generate a certain level of sorties, establish operational capability and 
sustain air, space and cyberspace operations. 
2.3.1.  A force module is a planning and execution tool that provides a means of logically 
grouping records, which facilitate planning, analysis and monitoring. Force modules consists 
of a “grouping of combat, combat support and combat service support forces, with their 
accompanying supplies and required non-unit resupply and personnel necessary to sustain 
forces for a minimum of 30 days.” (Joint Pub 1-02). AETF force modules integrate combat 
unit type codes (UTC) with combat support UTCs to sustain a base population of 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  23  
approximately 3,000 personnel for at least 30 days. The six force modules (Figure 2.2) are 
not executed sequentially but rather overlap into a tiered effect that supports combat 
operations. The following paragraphs provide a brief description of each module. For in-
depth information on AETF force modules, including the basic assumption made in 
developing each module, see AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution. 
Figure 2.2.  AETF Force Module Construct 
 
2.3.1.1.  Open the Airbase. This module provides the capabilities to open an airbase and 
rapidly establish an initial operating capability (IOC), regardless of the mission, in 
approximately 24 hours after arrival of its forces. This module will likely deploy before 
operations commence (C-Day), and will: protect the forces, plan the reception and 
beddown follow-on forces, establish communications, prepare the airfield for initial flight 
operations and address host nation issues. The module normally includes one CE officer 
and one engineering craftsman who are primarily tasked with assessing the airfield’s 
immediate capability to support mobility airlift operations. RED HORSE and Prime 
BEEF UTCs may be tasked to augment the Open the Airbase module to expedite use of 
the airfield. 
2.3.1.2.  Command and Control. This module establishes an air expeditionary wing or 
group command and control (C2) structure to assume responsibility from the Open the 
Airbase module. The C2 module includes initial maintenance group, operations group, 
medical group and mission support group leadership and staffs. Secure communications 
and intelligence are key capabilities in this module. A field grade CE officer and an 
engineering craftsman, both from the Prime BEEF UTC tasked in the Establish the 
Airbase module, deploy with the C2 module to provide initial beddown planning and 
coordinate with engineers in the Open the Airbase module. 
2.3.1.3.  Establish the Airbase. This module provides initial base expeditionary combat 
support capability to expand base infrastructure, establish round-the-clock operations and 
enhance force protection and communications. The module includes the majority of 
deploying civil engineers and other expeditionary combat support forces, including 
  24  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
airfield operations, logistics plans, weather, chaplain and additional medical, security 
forces, force protection, supply and transportation elements. Housekeeping (e.g. billeting, 
food service, hygiene, environmental control units [ECU], etc), industrial operations and 
flightline assets are deployed with this module, along with personnel from the 49 MMG 
to assist with erection of technically complex mobile assets. 
2.3.1.4.  Generate the Mission. This module provides the primary weapon systems and 
systems operators and maintainers required to operate the weapon system and its 
subsystems. Module elements include maintenance supervision, munitions, intelligence, 
weather, operations support, flying squadrons and life support. 
2.3.1.5.  Operate the Airbase. This force module contains the mission support forces 
needed to achieve full operating capability and sustain those forces for up to 30 days. The 
module increases force protection, communications, cargo handling and materiel 
management and distribution. It also develops robust quality of life activities such as 
chaplain, fitness, library, health care, feeding and sheltering and reach-back capabilities 
(US mail and military pay). 
2.3.1.6.  Robust the Airbase. This force module provides additional expeditionary combat 
support to strengthen the capabilities already put in place by the previous force modules. 
The forces in this module will typically not arrive until 30 days after an operating 
location is established. 
2.4.  Bare Base Asset Deployment Planning Guidelines.  Just as the base population is phased 
into a bare base, the facility and utility assets required to support the population and aircraft are 
also predetermined and incrementally flowed. Without this preplanning and asset sequencing, 
engineers would have plane loads of equipment sitting on the ramp waiting to be sorted before 
any meaningful beddown or support to combat sorties could be initiated. To meet this challenge, 
engineers and logisticians use asset management systems like Basic Expeditionary Airfield 
Resources (BEAR) and BEAR Order of Battle (BOB) to manage these critical resources. Assets 
in both systems are key enablers for AETFs to open the air base, generate the mission, and 
operate the air base. Currently, BEAR equipment sets are being transformed into smaller BOB 
packages, therefore BOB will be the main focus of this section. 
2.4.1.  Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) Order of Battle (BOB). Similar to the 
reconfiguration of “Harvest” sets to lighter, leaner BEAR equipment sets, BOB is an 
example of the Air Force’s effort to continue implementing a flexible and responsive system 
for deploying BEAR assets. Under BOB, previously addressed BEAR 550-person sets are 
being reduced to smaller sizes (e.g. 250-person increments) to increase flexibility and 
efficiency and be postured for delivery by multi-modal shipping methods—a mix of air and 
surface delivery. It is also likely that units will deploy with equipment and spares in 
quantities of less than 30 days (e.g. a 10-day supply). In the same manner as BEAR, BOB 
supports the Agile Combat Support CONOPS goals of making the AF lighter, leaner and 
more responsive in planning and execution. Historically, beddown locations received 
equipment in entire “sets” even though each location had different needs. With order of battle 
priority sequencing, planners have a menu of capabilities to choose from because most or all 
BOB UTCs will be “playbook” options. The intent is to synchronize posturing of BEAR 
assets and give deployed commanders only what they need, exactly when they need it. BOB 
will provide a basic capability, but most assets and capabilities will be optional and mission 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  25  
specific. The policies that establish these processes are fully outlined in various publications, 
including AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-404. Figure 2.3 visually highlights the transition from 
BEAR to BOB asset management and the focus on flexibility and effect for the warfighter. 
The paragraphs that immediately follow also describe some of the elements of this transition. 
Note: the abbreviation “MTW” in the figure refers to major theater war but can also apply to 
most major operations. 
Figure 2.3.  Transition from BEAR to BOB Asset Management 
 
2.4.1.1.  Capability-Based Planning and Force Presentation. AF planners recognized 
inefficiencies in the architecture that presents forces on plan-based or theater-based 
requirements. When forces and assets are presented based on large modules, it usually 
creates the need for trimming or tailoring personnel and materiel to meet the actual need 
on the ground. To avoid this inevitable extra step, planners have transformed to a 
planning and execution process that allows delivery of a capability and an “effect” to 
combatant commanders. Presentation of capabilities in this manner helps reduce the 
overall engineer and logistics footprint compared to previous legacy and BEAR sets. 
Commanders can now employ only those capabilities required to meet the mission. 
2.4.1.2.  Dynamic Positioning Strategy. This capability involves planning that expedites 
placement and movement of assets to meet combatant commander requirements. Inherent 
in this strategy is the ability to gain/retain access to bases and infrastructure and move 
assets overtly and covertly. BEAR assets can be strategically and globally positioned to 
support not only AF requirements but international, joint service and coalition efforts. 
2.4.1.3.  Multi-Modal Configuration. One of the major challenges for legacy assets is the 
heavy dependence on limited airlift resources. With BOB, planners have a multi-modal 
and flexible transportation configuration and assets are efficiently packaged, transported 
and delivered by a range of air, land and sea options. With the exception of the BEAR 
150, which because of the need for its rapid deployment has an exclusive airlift 
configuration, all other BOB UTCs can be configured for air or surface delivery. 
Currently about 30% of BEAR assets are configured for transportation by air and 
  26  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
approximately 70% are planned to deploy via surface. Table 2.1 lists the major BOB 
UTCs as currently configured. Note: surface includes commercial rail, ground and sealift.

2.4.1.4.  Modular/Scalable UTCs. UTCs that do not require tailoring is an important order 
of battle feature. BOB builds the smallest viable structure of personnel and equipment to 
provide a baseline level of capability for all deployment locations. The baseline can then 
be incrementally increased to meet location/mission specific requirements. The goal is to 
define right-sized UTCs that can operate across a wide range of operations, locations and 
environments and rapidly link to other UTCs in a building block manner when necessary. 
This is key to a flexible expeditionary capability and the cornerstone of BOB. Figure 2.4 
through Figure 2.6 provide visual representation of how BOB is flexible and scalable to 
meet the specific situation and location. Shaded portions of the tables indicate capability 
not yet needed for that particular operation. Figure 2.7 further demonstrates the BOB 
capability. An obvious contrast is that while BEAR sets were based on increments of 550 
personnel, BOB assets are scaled to 250 personnel or down to the desired capability. And 
while legacy systems have very large UTCs with heavy airlift requirements, BOB has 
smaller, modular UTCs with flexible transportation modes.

2.5.  Complementary Systems and Equipment.  Although BEAR contain many facilities and 
utility support systems, a bare base cannot operate in a mission-responsive posture using only 
BEAR assets. Several complementary programs exist which engineers must be aware of since 
  30  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
some of these programs will require engineer support or directly assist engineer forces in 
accomplishing bare base taskings. Typically these other systems and equipment include: 
2.5.1.  Mobile Flightline Maintenance Equipment. For the most part, this equipment 
represents the powered and non-powered AGE used for aircraft maintenance purposes. 
2.5.2.  User Unique Tactical Shelters. Many other types of tactical shelters not directly 
associated with BEAR provide unique facility support for bare base users. The majority of 
these are aircraft-related maintenance shops dedicated to specific types of aircraft. 
2.5.3.  Vehicles. Vehicle packages, which provide a bare base with general and special 
purpose transportation equipment, are major support items. 
2.5.4.  Mobile Hospital/Clinics and Equipment. Expeditionary medical support facilities and 
related systems discussed in more detail in Chapter 12, fall in this category. 
2.5.5.  Communications Equipment. This grouping of facilities includes base communication 
networks and navigational aids (NAVAIDS) packages. 
2.5.6.  CE Construction Equipment. Typical of this category is airfield damage repair (ADR) 
additives to the base vehicle fleet. 
2.5.7.  Fuels Mobility Support Equipment (FMSE) and Fuels Operational Readiness 
Capability Equipment (FORCE). These include fuel bladders, air transportable hydrant 
refueling systems, pumps, filters and other equipment needed to store and distribute ground 
and aviation fuels in an expeditionary environment. 
2.5.8.  Unique Equipment from Other Functional Areas. This includes a myriad of equipment 
items that individually may not be major, but in total, represent a considerable weight and 
cube requirement for airlift movement. 
2.5.9.  In pursuit of lighter, leaner capability, the AF will continue to test and develop other 
rapidly deployable systems and components. The requirement to be prepared to respond to 
unpredictable situations and small-scale contingencies fuel much of this effort. However, 
lessons learned, individual initiative, suggestions and innovation are also factors. Air Force 
Special Operations Command (AFSOC), for instance, adopted the Air Rapid Response Kit 
(AARK) to meet the unique needs of special operations forces. This system uses a hybrid of 
lightweight military and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to provide various 
levels of basic shelter and hygiene for 10 to 100 persons for a limited period of time. 
2.6.  Engineer Planning Guidelines.  The following guidelines reflect planning criteria for 
various major BEAR facility and utility requirement areas. 
2.6.1.  Airfield. 
2.6.1.1.  If pre-existing aircraft arresting systems are operational and adequate in number, 
they will require operational checks and maintenance. When inoperative, or where none 
exist, a mobile aircraft arresting system (MAAS) must be installed (Figure 2.8). Note: 
AF personnel can only perform checks and maintenance on US-owned aircraft arresting 
systems. They cannot certify systems constructed by other countries. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  31  
Figure 2.8.  Servicing the Mobile Aircraft Arresting System 
 
2.6.1.2.  As a minimum, runway edge and approach lights are required. Distance-to-go 
and aircraft arresting system marker lights are required on runways supporting jet aircraft 
operations. The lights are also recommended for runways supporting propeller-type 
aircraft operations. 
2.6.1.3.  NAVAIDS are required. Communications and CE personnel will accomplish 
installation jointly. 
2.6.1.4.  An aircraft parking plan is required. 
2.6.1.5.  Aircraft revetments, when required, will be constructed 16 feet high on ramps, 
aprons, matting, or hardstands. 
2.6.1.6.  If additive aircraft parking surfaces are required to support surge, dispersal, or 
overcrowding conditions, stabilized areas will be required. If available, AM-2 matting 
should be the primary material considered. If using AM-2 matting, ensure the required 
technical expertise is available to install and evaluate AM-2 matting to withstand the 
rigors of aircraft movements. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps has extensive experience 
in AM-2 matting installation. If needed, consider consulting with their experts at the 
Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Lakehurst, New Jersey for advice and 
assistance. 
2.6.2.  Site Preparation and Layout. 
2.6.2.1.  The site should have relatively flat terrain with minimal grading, brush, or tree 
removal required. 
2.6.2.2.  Blasting or large rock removal should not be required. 
2.6.2.3.  Major soil stabilization work should not be required. 
2.6.2.4.  The site will require expedient soil testing and surveying to establish base lines, 
major functional areas and specific areas using field expedient survey methods, when 
possible. 
  32  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
2.6.2.5.  Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) site preparation consists of siting, grading, 
berming and furnishing and installing a 3-inch dike drain pipe and gate valve. All fuel 
bladders, regardless of size and content, will be bermed; all fuel bladder dikes will be 
fitted with a protective liner to prevent environmental damage and contamination (Figure 
2.9). Bladders, headers, adapters, fill stands and associated attachments will be furnished 
and installed by base supply fuels operations personnel. 
Figure 2.9.  Fuel Berm with Protective Liner Installed 
 
2.6.2.6.  The munitions storage site preparation consists of siting, grading, berming and 
sandbagging. Construction of storage bunkers should begin as soon as possible after other 
more essential tasks are completed. In the interim period, munitions should be stored in 
temporary bermed, sandbagged areas if sandbags are available. Also, plan on providing a 
grounding system for the munitions area consisting of ground rods and a connecting grid 
system. 
2.6.2.7.  Medical unit site preparation consists of siting and grading approximately 0.9 
acre for the 25-bed facility, 1.15 acres for the 50-bed Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH) 
and 2.5 acres for the 114-bed AFTH. Medical units should be sited in lower threat areas 
of the base but as near as practical to force support facilities such as billeting, showers 
and laundry. 
2.6.3.  Facilities Siting and Construction. 
2.6.3.1.  Use existing structures and facilities as much as possible, consistent with 
operational economy and functional requirements. 
2.6.3.2.  Use locally-available construction materials and use temporary construction 
methods unless more permanent structures are required due to operational demands or 
cost factors. 
2.6.3.3.  Civil engineers are responsible for siting and locating all facility groups and for 
siting, locating and erecting all utility plants and systems. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  33  
2.6.3.4.  Consider base defense requirements up front. Base layout should comply with 
theater-specific requirements and minimum antiterrorism standards (including hardening, 
standoff and separation distances) prescribed in UFC 4-010-01, DOD Minimum 
Antiterrorism Standards for Building, Appendix D, and UFC 4-020-01, DOD Security 
Engineering Facilities Planning Manual. 
2.6.3.5.  Comply with Quantity-Distance criteria for inhabited building according to 
AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards. 
2.6.3.6.  Facility separation distances may be minimized to improve functional 
relationships and save on utility system costs, as long as minimum standoff, facility 
separation, and quantity-distance criteria is met. 
2.6.3.7.  Civil engineers erect their own facilities and furnish a minimum cadre of 
personnel to provide technical assistance to other base functions erecting their own 
facilities (Figure 2.10). 
2.6.3.8.  The contingency troop housing planning factor of 50 SF per person can be used 
for the bare base. Soft-walled shelters can be used for personnel billeting. Refer to AFI 
34-246, Air Force Lodging, for additional planning factors during emergency/wartime 
conditions. 
Figure 2.10.  Civil Engineers Erect Medium Shelter System 
 
2.6.4.  Electrical Power. 
2.6.4.1.  Electrical power requirements should be based on 4.5 kilowatts (kW) per tent for 
the cantonment area. When an industrial capability is added, the planning factor may 
increase. These requirements should be used at contingency locations and during the 
initial bare base development stage. However, for longer term bare base locations, 
anticipate an increase in electrical power production to support quality of life 
requirements. 
  34  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
2.6.4.2.  Even though centrally located high-voltage generators offer the most 
advantageous primary distribution system, they should be dispersed in a high-threat area 
between prime and slave power plant locations to improve survivability. Multiple power 
plants and primary distribution loops that interconnect these plants are especially critical 
in high-threat locations. If a power plant becomes inoperative for any reason, the 
electrical grid can be energized from the remaining power plant(s). 
2.6.4.3.  MEP generators (30-kW and 60-kW) can be dispersed throughout the base to 
satisfy initial power requirements for priority facilities until the base electrical 
distribution system (750-kW units) becomes fully operational. At that time, the MEP 
generators will become a backup source of mission-essential power for critical bare base 
functions. 
2.6.4.4.  RALS should be installed around POL, liquid oxygen (LOX), flightlines, 
medical units and munitions storage. Primary and secondary distribution systems should 
be extended to these areas to provide power for RALSs. 
2.6.4.5.  Since the total connected load will not be operating continuously, a 
diversification factor of seven-tenths (0.7) should be applied to all loads except air 
conditioning or unique loads which require full demand at all times. 
2.6.5.  Water. 
2.6.5.1.  Water treatment plants must be installed at base sites where water is nonpotable. 
A ROWPU is required for water desalinization, removal of suspended solids from fresh 
water and chlorination control of bacteria. Water use planning factors are in Chapter 8 of 
this volume. 
2.6.5.2.  If available, one chilled fountain can be provided for approximately every 65 
people. Due to the limited number available, chillers should be allocated to areas with the 
greater population densities such as the flightline, base operations, cantonment area and 
similar functional groups. Additionally, three chilled water fountains are required for 
each AFTH (one in each ward and one in outpatient area). These requirements are based 
on a chilled water fountain that produces 15 gph of 60-degree water when the input water 
temperature is 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Chilled water fountains should be strategically 
located in shower/latrine and functional areas where water is already available. Water 
lines should not normally be run to functional areas for the sole purpose of providing 
drinking water. Chilled water fountains must be of the type with a downward water flow, 
allowing containers to be filled without excessive waste. 
2.6.5.3.  In SWA, temperatures range from a daytime high of 130 degrees Fahrenheit to a 
nighttime low of 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Where possible, pipes should be buried to a 
depth of 18 inches or more to provide mechanical protection to the system and to prevent 
heat gain from high ambient temperatures. 
2.6.5.4.  Demineralized water may be required for some medical operations. Verify this 
requirement by location to determine the total amount of storage needed. When the 
requirement for demineralized water exists but exact quantities are unknown, allow one 
20,000-gallon bladder for this purpose. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  35  
2.6.5.5.  Where total dissolved solids content of water used for showers and laundry 
exceeds 500 ppm, soaps and detergents designed for “salt water use” should be used. 
2.6.6.  Waste Disposal. 
2.6.6.1.  Approximately 70 percent of all potable water will likely become wastewater 
that enters the sewer system for treatment at wastewater lagoons. The remaining 30 
percent of potable water will be lost through leaks, perspiration, evaporation and food 
preparation. 
2.6.6.2.  When modular latrine units (field deployable latrine system) are used, the 
sanitary system treatment facilities should be sized to accept all human waste. When the 
field deployable latrine is used without piped sewage disposal, latrine holding tanks must 
be emptied periodically and the human waste transported to wastewater lagoons. Typical 
housing layouts contain a minimum of four deployable latrines; each latrine set has 
twelve toilets and two urinal troughs. 
2.6.6.3.  Depending on the salinity of the raw water source, for every gallon of potable 
water produced, up to two gallons of brine water can be produced. Provisions for the 
disposal of brine water must be made (e.g. dust control). Where feasible, brine water can 
be returned to the source. The lagoons discussed later in this pamphlet have not been 
sized to accept brine water since the salt content of the brine water would upset the 
biological treatment and evaporation processes. 
2.6.6.4.  Biodegradable soaps, paper and detergents should be used in an effort to 
eliminate unnecessary wastewater problems. 
2.6.6.5.  A combination of gravity flow and a force main sewer system is part of the 
BEAR wastewater distribution system. Grinders are used in the force main portion of the 
sewage ahead of lift pumps to grind waste material to slurry thereby reducing the power 
requirements and workload of the pumps. 
2.6.6.6.  Solid waste from dining halls should be buried or incinerated. A kitchen usually 
produces one-half to one pound of garbage per person per day. Kitchen grease traps 
should be maintained daily by Force Support personnel and inspected weekly by civil 
engineers. 
2.6.6.7.  Disposal of hazardous waste at expeditionary contingency bases must comply 
with DOD policy and guidance, Operations Plans and applicable international 
agreements. Usually, biological waste requires that an incineration site be established in a 
remote area of the base. Where incineration is not possible, a pit about 4 to 6 feet deep 
(depending on the water table) can sometimes be used to bury biological waste. Consult 
with base bioenvironmental (BEE) personnel for guidance and assistance on the handling 
and disposing of hazardous waste. 
2.6.7.  Fuels. 
2.6.7.1.  One 10,000-gallon fuel bladder should be provided for every two 750-kW diesel 
generators collocated at power plants. At full load each 750-kW diesel generator 
consumes approximately 55 gph of fuel. 
2.6.7.2.  At full load each 30-kW MEP generator consumes about 3 gph of diesel fuel and 
each 60-kW unit about 5 gph. 
  36  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
2.6.7.3.  Internal tanks normally fuel MEP generators. Base supply fuels personnel are 
responsible for central storage and resupply of fuel for MEP generators. 
2.7.  Task Priorities.  Many engineering tasks must be completed to establish an operational 
bare base at a fully mission capable level within desired time limits. Some tasks can be 
performed concurrently, others sequentially, and some may be dependent on BEAR asset flow 
and availability. A recommended order for bare base tasking accomplishment is provided in the 
priority taskings below. The priority of taskings reflects four stages of bare base development: 
initial, intermediate, follow-on and sustainment. See AFH 10-222 Volume 1, Civil Engineer 
Bare Base Development, for further information on the stages of bare base development.

when threat conditions dictate their preparation as a Priority 3 task. 
2.7.3.12.  Emergency Disposal Range. Prepare a land area to be used by EOD personnel 
for munitions destruction. 
2.7.4.  Priority 4 Taskings (Sustainment Stage). 
2.7.4.1.  Operations and Maintenance. Continue to provide operation and maintenance of 
bare base and existing facilities, utilities, roads, pavements and similar bare base 
infrastructure. 
2.7.4.2.  Contingency Response Plans. Develop and update contingency plans to include 
recovery operations and natural disaster responses. 
2.7.4.3.  Training. Provide training and rehearse contingency tasks to include security 
measures, base recovery and base denial. 
2.7.4.4.  Quality of Life Improvements. As time permits, improve facilities and utilities 
(i.e., increased square footage, more access points, hot water, air conditioning). 
2.7.4.5.  Recreation Support. Construct basic recreation facilities and fields; provide 
utilities to these facilities as necessary. 
2.7.4.6.  Resource Accountability. Establish controls over materials, equipment and 
vehicles to preclude loss, damage or unauthorized use. This includes inventory, 
assignment of responsibility and providing protective features such as fencing, shelters, 
lighting, etc. 
2.8.  Climate and Weather.  Planning guidelines for the effects of climate and weather vary 
with the location of the bare base. For example, close to the equator all seasons are nearly alike, 
with rain throughout the year. Farther from the equator, in areas such as Central America and 
Southeast Asia, there are distinct wet (monsoon) and dry seasons. Both regions have high 
temperatures, heavy rainfall and high humidity. All these climatic phenomena impact bare base 
operations in the tropics. Conversely, the common characteristics of all desert areas are their 
aridity. Rainfall has virtually never been recorded in some parts of the Atacama Desert in Chile, 
for example, but rain does fall in deserts. When it does occur, the rainfall may consist of a single 
violent storm in a year with high surface water run-off that, from a planning perspective, makes 
such rainfall a liability rather than an asset. While each climatic region confronts the bare base 
planner with its unique problems, none is as problematic as the arid desert environment. 
Extremely high daytime heat combines with near freezing temperatures at night (in the inland 
Sinai Desert, for example, day to night temperature can fluctuate as much as 72 degrees 
Fahrenheit), imposing an unusual strain on personnel and BEAR equipment. Consequently, 
climatic planning guidelines for the arid Southwest Asian environment receive prominent 
treatment in the following paragraphs of this chapter. The effects of climate and weather on bare 
bases located in other climatic zones are discussed throughout this volume. 
  40  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
2.8.1.  SWA. Since SWA receives little rain, precipitation is not considered as a significant 
factor. But, as mentioned earlier, sudden and intense rains that occur several hundred miles 
away from the bare base may eventually cause flash flooding at the bare base. Construction 
in areas where there is a likelihood of ponding should be avoided. A thorough terrain analysis 
should reveal natural drainage swales subject to flash flooding. 
2.8.2.  Winds in SWA can achieve almost hurricane force, and dust and sand suspended 
within them can make life almost intolerable, make any type of activity difficult and restrict 
visibility to a few yards. Strong winds are invariably followed by rapid changes in 
temperature. 
2.8.3.  Burial of utility lines and shading of fuel bladders, generators and vehicles will be 
required to reduce the effects of intense sunlight emitted from a cloudless sky. 
2.9.  Manpower.  The number of civil engineers required during the establish the base phase 
will not change radically at lower base populations because the tasks of preparing the runways 
and taxiways, installing runway lights, constructing POL and ammunition areas and installing 
utility systems remain relatively constant regardless of base population. 
2.9.1.  The maximum manpower requirement for heavy equipment operator, electrical, water 
and fuels systems maintenance and engineering personnel will exist during the establish the 
base phase of the force beddown. Maximum manpower requirements for power production 
and heating/air-conditioning personnel will exist during the longer-term operate the airbase 
and robust the airbase phases of the deployment. During the initial establish the airbase 
phase of the deployment, technicians in pest management, operations management, and 
structures can be used to assist electrical, utilities and engineering crews to erect civil 
engineer facilities and utilities. Additionally, specially trained personnel from any of these 
Air Force Specialties (AFSs) can be used to supervise other crews of base personnel in 
erection of base facilities. 
2.9.2.  Although this publication makes no allowances for temperature extremes in its time 
and labor estimates, each bare base location imposes its own set of constraints that translates 
into “additives.” Allowances must be made for acclimatization, reduced working hours 
during extreme heat or intense cold and the difficulties of handling materials under severe 
climatic conditions. Again, the arid desert environment imposes the worst set of working 
conditions and is therefore singled out under the following recommendations and guidelines 
(guidance for manpower planning in less demanding climates is discussed in Chapter 5). 
2.9.2.1.  A period of approximately two weeks should be allowed for acclimatization, 
with progressive degrees of heat exposure and physical exertion. 
2.9.2.2.  When it is not possible for combat forces and combat support forces to become 
fully acclimatized before being required to perform heavy labor, personnel should work 
in shifts, strenuous work should be reduced during the hottest part of the day or limited to 
the cooler hours and personnel should be allowed to rest more frequently than normal. 
2.9.2.3.  The prevention of heat injuries, generally considered an individual responsibility 
in most situations, becomes a matter of command concern in an environment that is 
especially harsh to the inexperienced. Proper wear of clothing (loose-fitting, allowing 
plenty of ventilation), periodic intake of water, frequent rest breaks and any other 
measures necessary to preserve the war fighting capability of people are critical factors. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  41  
2.10.  Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning.  Heating should be provided in all personnel 
shelters that are used for detail work or occupied for extended periods of time in order to 
maintain an interior dry bulb temperature above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Within permanent and 
semi-permanent facilities, an effective temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit should be 
maintained unless dictated otherwise by workload or extremely heavy clothing. Heating systems 
should be installed, when possible, so that hot air is not discharged directly on people. 
2.10.1.  A minimum of 20 cubic feet of air per minute of outside air per person should be 
introduced into any personnel enclosure to provide adequate ventilation. Air should be 
circulated within the space to prevent stratification or stagnation and delivered within the 
occupied zone (past a person) at a velocity less than 100 feet per minute. Under chemical, 
biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosive (CBRNE) conditions, ventilation 
requirements should be modified as required. Ventilation or other protective measures must 
be provided to keep gases, vapors, dust and fumes within safe limits. Intakes for ventilation 
systems must be located to minimize the introduction of engine exhaust emissions or other 
contaminated air. 
2.10.2.  Air conditioning has been designed for use in all facilities except storage and those 
with little or no occupancy. Utility systems are designed to accept a total air conditioning 
package. Air conditioning should be installed so that cold air is not discharged directly onto 
people. 
2.10.3.  Humidity should be approximately 30-65 percent at 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Humidity 
should decrease with rising temperatures, but should be above 15 percent to prevent irritation 
and drying of the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. It is also important that the temperature of 
enclosed areas be held relatively uniform. The temperature at floor level and at head level 
should not differ by more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit. 
2.11.  Noise Suppression and Lighting.  Personnel should be protected from noise levels that 
cause injury, interfere with voice or any other communications, cause fatigue, or in any other 
way degrade overall effectiveness. 
2.11.1.  Equipment such as diesel generators, which generate noise in excess of maximum 
allowable levels, should be placed sufficient distances away from facilities where people 
work or billet so as not to cause personal injury. If sufficient distances cannot be achieved, 
noise barriers or baffles should be installed. Concrete “Bitburg” type revetments have also 
proven effective in this regard. Workspace noise should be reduced to levels that allow the 
required degree of person-to-person and telephone communications, as well as an acceptable 
work environment. 
2.11.2.  Where equipment is to be used in enclosures and is not subject to blackout or special 
low-level lighting requirements, illumination should be distributed to reduce glare and 
reflection. Adequate illumination should be provided for maintenance tasks. General and 
supplementary lighting should be used, as appropriate, to ensure that illumination is 
compatible with each task situation. Portable lights should be provided for people performing 
visual tasks in areas where fixed illumination is not provided. 
2.12.  Transportation.  Special and general-purpose vehicles will be required to erect BEAR 
assets and to improve and maintain the bare base site. Aerial port personnel will normally offload 
BEAR equipage brought into an installation by airlift onto a cargo-holding apron. Transportation 
  42  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
personnel are responsible for moving cargo from the ramp to the point of use. Due to a limited 
number of vehicles, joint usage of vehicles by transportation and civil engineers may be required. 
Coordination is necessary between engineers and transportation during movement and placement 
of BEAR facilities, utilities and support items. To meet operational deadlines, engineers should 
be prepared to move BEAR assets from the holding area to sites of intended use without 
assistance from other organizations. This means having enough engineers licensed to operate 
material handling equipment such as forklifts and tractor trailers. 
2.13.  Medical Facilities Support.  The Expeditionary Medical Support/Air Force Theater 
Hospital (EMEDS/AFTH) systems provide the entire spectrum of AF health care in a theater of 
operations (Figure 2.12). This system and facilities provide modular and tiered medical 
capability driven by mission, airlift availability and population at risk. The EMEDS/AFTH 
system was developed from the need for an easily transported and ready medical care platform 
closer to expeditionary and combat forces. The older Air Transportable Hospital (ATH) was 
deemed too large and was normally located miles from front line forces (to reduce possible battle 
damage), delaying access to immediate care. EMEDS is smaller and can be expanded in a 
component fashion. The EMEDS/AFTH systems must attain operational capability within 24 
hours after employment. Further discussion of the capabilities and requirements of this system is 
found in Chapter 12 of this volume and AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management. 
Figure 2.12.  Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) System 
 
2.14.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) 
Environment.  The threat of CBRNE materials being used against a bare base, either during or 
after construction, is ever present. CE emergency management personnel must determine 
decontamination procedures and siting of decontamination stations. Provisions must be made for 
the disposal of contaminated water from the decontamination processes. This publication 
presents no specific planning guidelines for CBRNE threats; however, AFMAN 10-2503, 
Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive 
(CBRNE) Environment, addresses this area. It provides explanations and procedures for the AF 
shelter program, contamination control measures, mission-oriented protective postures (MOPP) 
and wartime attack actions for each level of command. The impact of CBRNE attacks on bare 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  43  
base operations should be considered in the BCE Contingency Response Plan and during training 
exercises. Planners should recognize that time estimates for facility erection and completion of 
bare base tasks will be affected by MOPP conditions, even with well-trained, fully equipped CE 
crews. 
2.15.  Camouflage and Concealment.  The fact that the bare base exists will be difficult to 
conceal from the enemy. Planning for concealment must therefore concentrate on decreasing the 
range of target acquisition by delaying recognition of targets and by concealing valuable BEAR 
assets, thus making precision bombing difficult. 
2.15.1.  Planning for concealment should be coordinated with bare base construction 
planning from the outset; it is much easier and less costly in time, manpower and camouflage 
materials to apply camouflage during the setup phase than to add camouflage as an after-the-
fact effort. Early planning for camouflage increases the awareness in all personnel and helps 
eliminate unnecessary ground and terrain disturbances that would otherwise defeat the 
purpose of camouflage or require additional effort to conceal the disturbance. 
2.15.2.  Where natural cover and concealment are inadequate or absent, BEAR camouflage 
sets can be used to screen and conceal assets. These camouflage sets includes 200 desert-
colored, lightweight radar scattering nets and 70 support systems to provide camouflage 
screening and shade for facilities and equipment. Each net is capable of covering 
approximately 200 square feet and the set can be configured to cover single or multiple 
structures. 
2.15.3.  Recognizing that camouflaging all assets on the bare base with nets would be 
logistically difficult to support, the planner must make every effort to reduce net 
requirements by taking maximum advantage of the natural concealment of existing terrain, 
by clustering several facilities or equipment items together and erecting a net over the entire 
group, or by placing nets only on the side of structures which contain the shadow. 
2.15.4.  Coordinated concealment planning will require compromises among the need for 
camouflage and dispersion, the efficiency of access, the maintenance security, the allocation 
of scarce resources and a number of similar considerations that depend on aspects unique to 
each bare base location and its mission. Additional camouflage and concealment planning 
factors are contained in AFH 10-222, Volume 10, Civil Engineer Camouflage, Concealment 
& Deception Measures. 
2.16.  Base Defense.  While accomplishing their bare base mission, engineers generally rely on 
security forces to shield and extricate them from hostile action. In some situations (during the 
early stages of a deployment, for example), availability of security forces may be limited. In such 
a situation, engineers must employ their individual weapons, body armor, cover and concealment 
and defensive fighting positions for security and survival. 
2.16.1.  For the bare base planner, CE involvement in air base defense should be anticipated 
in these areas: design and construction of defensive fighting positions, vehicle fighting 
positions and entry control points; removal of foliage around critical resources (to establish 
clear zones); assistance in establishing sector command posts and the base defense operations 
center (to include electrical power hook-up); establishment of an armory and other storage 
facilities; and assistance in setting up sensor equipment and mounting thermal imagers. In 
addition, the bare base planner should anticipate, when ordered to do so by the wing 
  44  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
commander, the integration of the engineer unit into the air base defense force to defend 
against enemy threats to the bare base. 
2.16.2.  The threat of terrorist activity directed against deployed forces must be assumed to 
exist anytime and anywhere a bare base is being established. In addition to the obvious 
requirement for an enhanced security posture of the CE force, the bare base planner must 
support base-wide antiterrorist measures. As the only unit on base that can create physical 
means to deter or impede a terrorist intrusion, civil engineers must be prepared to fabricate, 
install or emplace a variety of barriers, obstacles and fortifications (Figure 2.13). Volume 2 
of this publication series contains instructions and guidance on how to support these types of 
construction efforts and participate as a member of the air base defense force. 
Figure 2.13.  Engineers Create Physical Barriers Against Terrorist Intrusions 
 
2.17.  Base Recovery and Denial.  Bare base development and growth are evolutionary 
processes. Early efforts are concerned with the flying mission and protection of the base’s 
inhabitants from the elements. As the base grows, place more emphasis on contingency training 
and planning to include base recovery and base denial. From a base recovery aspect, give serious 
up-front thought to such wartime-related features as equipment and material dispersal locations, 
access ways for response vehicles, personnel shelter locations, communication capability 
between facilities, utility system redundancy and facility dispersal and hardening. Base denial 
planning should consider not only the more common tactics of asset destruction, but also, and 
perhaps more importantly, address the removal and transport of BEAR assets away from the land 
battle area. Even though these initiatives come later in the bare base development cycle, they 
require early planning to ensure air base survivability and that materials and equipment are 
available, when required. 
2.18.  Asset Reconstitution.  At the conclusion of a bare base deployment, the mobility assets 
used are normally placed back into storage to await future requirements and taskings. This part 
of the bare base operation often does not receive the proper degree of attention. A key step in this 
retrograde process is refurbishing and reconstituting worn out or damaged assets over the course 
of the deployment. The 49 MMG has primary responsibility for repair and maintenance of 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  45  
BEAR mobility assets. At the end of contingency deployments, this organization normally 
receives these assets back at storage locations and subsequently proceeds to conduct inventories, 
identify component shortages, repair damaged or worn items and repackage assets for storage. 
Reconstitution is complex and time consuming since personnel must handle hundreds, if not 
thousands, of individual assets. To speed up this process and help prolong the product life of 
mobility assets, facility users and, in particular, engineers should take several actions. 
2.18.1.  Disassembly. Disassembly and tear down of mobile facility and utility assets should 
be carefully and properly accomplished. Follow technical order instructions and guidance 
provided by people who are familiar with the assets. 
2.18.2.  Inventory and inspection. In conjunction with a bare base systems quality assurance 
evaluator, inventory and inspect all BEAR assets and components. Identify those pieces that 
are missing, broken, or non-functional and ensure a written list of these deficiencies is 
included with the asset being redeployed. Determine specific requirements that must be met 
in order for the deployed civil engineer unit to be released from custodial accountability in 
accordance with AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and 
Procedures. 
2.18.3.  Cleaning. Ensure the asset is as clean as possible and free from any foreign material 
that might cause damage or contamination during shipment. Keep in mind that aircraft and 
customs inspections will have to be passed. 
2.18.4.  Packaging. Take care to properly put the asset in its shipping configuration or 
package the asset correctly in its shipping container. Again, follow the technical order 
instructions and the advice of people who know what to do. Make sure the deficiency list 
mentioned above is included in the shipping container or firmly attached to the asset itself if 
a container is not used.

Chapter 3 
BARE BASE SITING AND CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES 
3.1.  Introduction.  For a bare base to withstand a harsh environment and to keep occupants 
reasonably comfortable, the location of a facility or utility should be determined by analyzing the 
constraints and features of the area. Overall siting analysis should include the climatic constraints 
of solar radiation, temperature, precipitation and prevailing wind. It should also include natural 
terrain features such as topography, ground cover and drainage patterns. Follow-on construction 
should be initiated during the early stages of bare base erection to address primary concerns: 
preparation of the airfield for its operational mission, establishment water treatment plants, and 
beddown and protection of inhabitants from the elements. As the base develops and its 
operational mission is assured, more emphasis can then be placed on base support functions such 
as administrative offices, personnel, finance, dining facilities and quality of life items. Work 
priorities and schedules should be established to ensure prudent use of CE manpower during the 
first 72 hours of employment. This increases the chance for a limited CE combat support force to 
accomplish all the essential tasks on time and helps ensure aircraft are launched and recovered as 
schedule. This chapter starts with a discussion of the basic principles involved in proper site 
selection and layout, including structure separation, standoff distances, and dispersed facility 
layouts. Then addresses construction sequence and task scheduling during the erection phase of 
bare base development followed by a brief review of theater construction standards. See AFH 
10-222, Volume 1, for more information on bare base siting and construction. 
3.2.  Site Selection and Layout.  The siting and layout of bare base facilities is influenced by the 
topography, climatic conditions, the principle of grouping related facilities to improve efficiency 
and the contrary principle of dispersing facilities to limit damage from enemy attack. Facility 
hardening, camouflage and concealment also increase protection from attack. Site-specific 
planning guidelines that take into account the many variables in topography and weather for the 
major climatic regions of the world are presented in Chapter 4. However, with a master bare 
base plan, facility siting tends to follow the pattern of existing roads and facilities. This may 
work out fine in some situations, but an overall siting plan which zones the base into functional 
areas with room for expansion helps manage orderly growth, boosts operational efficiency and 
conserves scarce resources. 
3.2.1.  Layout and Functional Grouping. The available real estate and configuration within 
the base defense boundary influences the layout and functional grouping of beddown 
facilities for expeditionary airbases. Figure 3.1 illustrates a conventional site layout where 
support facilities, billeting, and force protection functions are sited farther away from the 
flightline than the industrial support functions. However, if the base is long and narrow, a 
more linear layout may be appropriate (Figure 3.2). In addition to real estate configurations, 
the functional relationships between base activities are also a key concern. For example, 
certain aircraft maintenance activities must be on the flightline to expedite on-board aircraft 
maintenance; however, some need not be. If space is limited, activities such as avionics and 
parachute shops do not necessarily require direct access to the aircraft and may be sited off 
the flightline. Also, instead of placing supply facilities in one area, consider siting each 
facility where they are needed most. Locate some warehouses near aircraft maintenance 
facilities to improve response times to the primary supply customers. Place the civil engineer 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  47  
and vehicle maintenance functions near one another since a large vehicle fleet is involved. 
Put the main dining hall near the lodging area to better serve base personnel. Regardless of 
the layout selected, review the structure separation and standoff distances and dispersed 
layout guidance in paragraph 3.3 when planning layouts for facilities and groups. Also be 
very cognizant of the airfield clear/land use zones when planning facility layout. See UFC 2-
260-01 and Chapter 6 in this pamphlet for additional details. 
Figure 3.1.  Conventional Base Layout 
 
Figure 3.2.  Linear Base Layout 
 
3.2.2.  Space for Expansion. Always plan for future expansion and growth requirements—
including utilities and base defense requirements. Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 illustrate how a 
base layout plan can be structured to accommodate initial mission requirements while 
allowing for expansion due to mission changes. The first example is a 1100-person facility 
layout before expansion, the second is a 3300-person facility after a growth in mission and 
personnel. In the initial layout, planners included additional space in area requirements 
estimates to allow for expansion due to mission changes. Particularly for functions that could 
require numerous facility increases, such as billeting and supply warehousing and storage. 
Consider an additional buffer around munitions storage areas so that increased munitions 
levels do not expand or shift explosive clear zones into areas where personnel live or work, 
  48  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
thereby creating a violation of quantity-distance criteria. Allow sufficient space around utility 
plants so capacity can be increased without significant modification. Area requirements for a 
facility should also include space for attendant facilities. For example, aircraft parking ramps 
should have enough space to park the aircraft plus sufficient additional area to add 
revetments.

3.2.3.  Structure Separation, Standoff Distances and Dispersal Guidance. When making site 
layouts plans, the structure separation, standoff, and dispersal distances are key force 
protection measures that affect facility siting decisions. These measures help minimize the 
vulnerability of facilities and reduce the risk to personnel from a variety of threats. The 
minimum standoff distances and separation standards for new and existing facilities as well 
as expeditionary and temporary structures are contained in Unified Facility Criteria (UFC) 4-
010-01, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings and UFC 4-010-02, DOD 
Minimum Antiterrorism Standoff Distances for Buildings (FOUO). Planners may also consult 
AFTTP 3-2.68 IP, Multi-service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Airfield Opening, 
for additional guidance. 
3.2.4.  Facility Group Spacing. A major consideration when developing a base layout plan is 
the location and spacing of key facilities and essential areas. The data in Table 3.1 provides 
general planning guidance for spacing key facility groups when opening an airfield. See 
specific requirements for munitions areas in AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.

3.2.5.  Structure Separation and Standoff Distances. Structure separation requirements are 
established to minimize the possibility that an attack on one structure causes injuries or 
fatalities in adjacent structures. The separation distance is predicated on the potential use of 
indirect fire weapons. Standoff distances are used to minimize the accessibility and 
vulnerability of a facility. These distance are critical when siting a facility and can effectively 
mitigate indirect fire and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attacks. Standoff distances and 
separation for expeditionary and temporary structures are listed in Table 3.2 and illustrated 
in Figure 3.5. For container structures and pre-engineered buildings, the stand-off guidance 
for new and existing buildings listed in Table 3.3 apply. Always refer to UFC 4-010-01 and 
theater construction standards for specific requirements.

3.2.6.  Dispersed Facilities. Facility orientation is generally by rows and columns as shown in 
Figure 3.6. However in high-threat areas, facilities are usually hardened, dispersed, or both. 
If facilities are staggered or sited in irregular locations to maximize passive defense, ensure 
dispersed locations are within the limitations of the utility systems. The same principle 
applies to the different area locations. Use extreme caution when staggering facilities to 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  53  
avoid infringement upon utility routings. Latitude and longitude should also be considered in 
orienting facilities in order to minimize shadows, solar radiation and winds. Figure 3.7 
depicts typical dispersed layouts that can be used to build all facility groups, except billeting. 
By simply combining the appropriate number of groupings, planners can lay out an entire 
facility group in a short period of time. Use Figure 3.8 for billeting areas. Similarly, by 
combining this type of grouping, planners will be able to lay out an entire billeting group.

3.3.  Construction Sequence and Task Scheduling. 
3.3.1.  Construction Sequence. In general, bare base facilities and utilities should be 
constructed in the following sequence (for priority of the different construction jobs, see 
Chapter 2, Task Priorities). Many of these tasks can be accomplished simultaneously. 
3.3.1.1.  Runway preparation (sweeping, painting, etc.). 
3.3.1.2.  Runway edge and approach lights. 
3.3.1.3.  Water treatment plants. 
3.3.1.4.  Mission essential power (MEP). 
3.3.1.5.  Expedient sanitary latrine facilities. 
3.3.1.6.  Direct operational support functions.

3.3.1.14.  Indirect operational support facilities (kitchen, dining hall, etc.). 
3.3.1.15.  Waste utility system. 
3.3.1.16.  General billeting.

  55  
3.3.1.17.  Camouflage, concealment and personnel shelters. 
3.3.1.18.  Recreation. 
3.3.2.  Task Schedule. Major tasks listed in Table 3.4 are to be accomplished during base 
erection. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive, but to serve merely as a guide. This 
schedule is predicated on launching the first aircraft within 72 hours after arrival at the bare 
base. There could be situations that would require altering this construction schedule so this 
deadline can be met. This 72-hour requirement does not imply that the base will be 
completed but that the minimum requirements of the runway, taxiway, water, 
communications, barriers, turn-around capability, fueling and arming capabilities and parking 
ramp are available. It is important to note that the construction schedule does not reflect the 
phases of operation when installing the utility systems. For example, before the main 
generating plants and primary distribution cables are installed, it is necessary to hook up the 
MEP generators, secondary cables and secondary distribution centers (SDC) relevant to 
providing electric power to all direct operational support requirements. Once this is complete, 
the remaining elements of the electrical distribution system can be constructed. The same 
approach applies to the water and waste utility systems. In other words, the water treatment 
and storage tanks are established before distribution lines are laid, and operational latrines are 
constructed ahead of the waste disposal system.

3.4.  Theater Construction Standards.  Standards of construction in a theater of operations are 
specified by the Combatant Commander (CCDR) in coordination with the Service components 
and Force Support. This includes determining the location, types of materials, labor and 
construction techniques to be used. Theater construction standards provide criteria which 
minimize engineer effort while providing the quality of facilities consistent with mission 
requirements, personnel health and safety and the expected availability of construction resources. 
Keep in mind that construction standards are only guidelines; engineers must consider other 
factors during planning. There are generally two types of theater construction—contingency and 
enduring. 
3.4.1.  Contingency Construction. Contingency construction covers construction of facilities 
for initial beddown with a planned life expectancy of up to two years. The standards for 
contingency construction include organic, initial and temporary facilities (Table 3.5). 
3.4.1.1.  Organic construction uses host nation or unit organic equipment, facilities and 
labor to support deployments intended to last up to 90 days but may be used up to six 
months. Since construction is time consuming and often costly, the intent is to seek an 
alternative to new construction and use a minimum amount of labor and resources, until 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  57  
the arrival of the full engineer capability. Minimal or no land grading or site work, tents 
and pit latrines are examples of this standard. Although intended for use for up to 90 
days, organic construction may be used for up to six months. 
3.4.1.2.  Initial construction is also characterized by relatively austere facilities and 
utilities that require minimal engineer effort. This construction is intended for use during 
the first six months of a contingency. Most of the expeditionary equipment assets 
described in this volume—wood framed tents with flooring, latrines with sewage lift 
stations, tactical generators for electrical distribution and portable refrigeration—are 
examples of this standard. 
3.4.1.3.  Temporary construction is characterized by facilities and utilities of a more 
substantial nature. It is used to increase efficiency and sustain operations for at least 24 
months and with upgrades for up to 5 years. Wood frame buildings, bathhouses, 
commercial electric power and paved roads are examples of the temporary standard.

3.4.2.  Enduring Construction. Enduring construction covers design, award and 
management of construction for facilities with a life expectancy of more than two years. 
Planning for the enduring phase, if necessary, usually begins not later than 90 days into a 
deployment. Planning for the enduring phase should include early involvement of the 
servicing Contracting Officer, Finance Officer and Staff Judge Advocate. The standards for 
enduring construction include semi-permanent and permanent facilities. 
3.4.2.1.  Semi-Permanent facilities are designed and constructed with finishes, materials 
and systems that provide at least moderate energy efficiency, maintenance, and life-cycle 
cost. Life expectancy for semi-permanent facilities is more than two years but less than 
ten years. 
3.4.2.2.  Permanent facilities are designed and constructed with finishes, materials and 
systems selected for high energy efficiency and low maintenance and life-cycle costs. 
Life expectancy for permanent standard construction is more than 10 years. 
3.4.3.  Construction standards need not be stepped through in succession. For instance if local 
factors make it more prudent, temporary standard (two year) facilities and systems may be 
used from the start of an operation. This is particularly relevant if the use of local labor and 
materials make it more cost effective to build an infrastructure that provides a higher quality 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  59  
of life from the start of a deployment. Also remember that while mobile facilities (e.g. tents 
and shelters) are considered to be initial construction standard, this does not mean the 
facilities and utilities will be totally replaced after just six months. It simply means these 
systems are used at the initial onset of a conflict. It is quite possible that some initial standard 
assets will last several years before needing replacement. For additional information on 
construction standards see Joint Publication (JP) 3-34, Joint Engineer Operations.

Chapter 4 
SITE SPECIFIC PLANNING 
4.1.  Introduction.  The guidelines and planning factors presented in the preceding chapters 
were mostly generic in nature. When directed at a particular geographic application, such as 
SWA, these special considerations were prompted by the worst case conditions imposed by a 
desert environment. In preparing a comprehensive bare base development plan, nothing should 
be taken for granted. Consider the plight of military engineers in two vastly different regions of 
the world. During an exercise deployment to SWA, engineers disembarked at a desert air base to 
find that the only drinkable water immediately available was that carried in their canteens. Army 
engineers, deployed to a Central American airfield expecting to find a lush, tropical environment 
with an abundance of water, but instead found a barren area engulfed in layers of dust—a 
common situation during the dry season, even in the tropics. The lesson learned here is that 
surface water conditions can change between the pre-deployment site survey and the time of the 
mission, and can have significant impact on the project or mission. Obviously, the information 
generally available about a given deployment area and bare base site should not be taken at face 
value; it must be supplemented with up-to-date planning data that takes into account specific 
characteristics such as airfield configuration, topography, climate, existing facilities and other 
similar factors. 
4.2.  Overview.  The focus of this chapter is on providing information that assists the bare base 
planner and engineer in using a step-by-step approach to developing a comprehensive base 
development plan. General and specific planning considerations dictated by the climate and 
topography of a given area, should serve as a checklist to ensure the planner identifies questions 
that need to be answered about a specific site. Keep in mind that the planning considerations 
provided are not solely to determine use of BEAR assets, but rather are meant to address 
situations where no specific facility packages are identified. The intent is to give the planner and 
engineer advice, normally gleaned from experience, applicable to specific regional areas. 
4.3.  Data Collection.  The importance of effective data collection was addressed briefly in 
Chapter 1. This section further defines the data collection process and suggests sources that may 
be tapped for current information. Although, much of the data highlighted in this section can be 
collected independently, most of it is available as byproducts of the Expeditionary Site Planning 
and Survey Process (ESSP) and the Installation Geospatial Information and Services (IGI&S) 
program referred to in paragraph 4.4. 
4.3.1.  Mission Analysis. As with any military task, a thorough analysis of the mission is the 
keystone to effective bare base planning. What will be the primary mission of the bare base? 
Will the base support fighters, fighter-bombers, reconnaissance, or a combination of these 
weapons systems? Will the bare base serve as an aerial port supporting tactical aircraft, C-
130s, C-17, or strategic airlift involving commercial wide-body transports? The answers to 
these questions will drive all subsequent planning steps. Equally important to mission 
analysis is determining what level of aircraft maintenance is planned at the base. The number 
of aircraft and level of maintenance are key determinants of the number and type of 
operational support facilities. Another mission data item of vital interest to the bare base 
planner is the size of the population required to support the deploying aircraft. Once the 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  61  
mission has been analyzed and an initial estimate of the expected base population is 
determined, the next step should be an analysis of the threat. 
4.3.2.  Threat Analysis. Threat analysis will determine (1) whether facilities and utility plants 
will be dispersed or non-dispersed, (2) whether revetment and airfield damage repair sets will 
be required and (3) the level of effort to be expended on defensive fighting positions, 
hardening, and camouflage. It could also indicate the degree of convoying, resource dispersal 
and work party security activities that might be necessary, all of which normally translate 
into longer construction times. 
4.3.2.1.  The prudent planner will make an allowance for the potential of chemical 
weapons being used against the bare base by, as a minimum, identifying the additional 
resources needed to provide the base with a decontamination capability. 
4.3.2.2.  During previous major modern conflicts, the vulnerability of a theater air base 
was largely determined by its proximity to the forward edge of the battle area. In today’s 
major conflicts, the distinction between forward and rear areas has become blurred and 
predicting a base’s vulnerability is more difficult. Consequently, the air threat against a 
particular bare base should be officially assessed and defined through AF intelligence 
channels. Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and intelligence organizations can assess 
ground threats. 
4.3.3.  Site Specific Data Analysis. This analysis involves gathering as much data as possible 
about a bare base location and then using it as a guide during the actual planning and layout 
of the base. Typical data to be collected include basic terrain features, soil condition and 
topography, weather and climatic factors from maps, atlases, aerial photos, drawings, 
layouts, climatic records and other similar sources. Additionally, information on existing 
facilities, utilities and pavement should be obtained. Planners can also gather information on 
supporting resources such as indigenous labor and contractor availability; assured host-nation 
support and supply; and construction material sources. Once all available data have been 
obtained, it must be studied and combined to predict the influence on site layout; installation 
of facilities, utilities, camouflage and defense positions; and the operation and maintenance 
of the base. 
4.3.3.1.  Site Visit. If an advance visit is possible, capable individuals should be 
dispatched to contact their local counterparts, if any, and to investigate those aspects of 
existing facilities and available resources that relate to their jobs. For example, send a 
qualified engineer to collect soil samples and assess airfield pavement capabilities and 
condition, power and water specialists to learn the local systems, engineer technicians to 
obtain or make base layout drawings; and logisticians to investigate supply procedures 
and materials at hand (an example of a checklist to use during a site visit is shown in 
Attachment 3). The senior engineer should personally contact the host-base engineer (or 
equivalent) to discuss engineer missions, operational procedures and mutual support. If 
significant host-nation support discussions are anticipated, consider including the 
servicing Contracting Officer and Staff Judge Advocate on the site visit. 
4.3.3.2.  Sources of Information. If a site visit and ground reconnaissance is not feasible, 
planners can still use the following sources to gather a considerable amount of essential 
data: 
  62  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
4.3.3.2.1.  Flight Information Pamphlets. Carried by aircrews, these publications give 
nominal runway lengths and load capacities and are normally available at airfield 
management operations. 
4.3.3.2.2.  Airfield Database. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) 
maintains information on every high-interest airfield in the world. The database 
provides information on airfield pavements, utilities, facilities, fuel and off-base 
support. Database extracts are available from MAJCOMs through the Global 
Command and Control System (GCCS). Another good source for airfield information 
is Headquarters Air Mobility Command (AMC). The AMC Operations Directorate 
(AMC/A3) does recurring site visits/assessments of airfields worldwide as part of 
their enroute and bare base mobility mission. Additionally, tri-service Pavement-
Transportation Computer Assisted Structural Engineering (PCASE) project provides 
contingency airfield and road/railroad design, airfield parking planning software, 
access to unified facilities criteria and electronic versions of joint service handbooks 
on paved airfields. 
4.3.3.2.3.  Pavement Evaluation Reports. HQ AFCESA has compiled pavement data 
for many allied bases worldwide. Additionally, AFCESA can provide support when 
using Micro Paver, an automated pavement management system for developing 
maintenance and repair plans for airfields, roads and parking areas. Contact HQ 
AFCESA/CEO at Tyndall AFB, FL for additional information. 
4.3.3.2.4.  Air Navigation Charts (ANC). ANCs provide detailed information for 
airfields longer than 4,000 feet for most countries in the world. Published by NGA, 
these charts are described in the NGA catalog and should be available at airfield 
management operations. If map requirements (base names/locations) are identified, 
base operations personnel can order these products from NGA. 
4.3.3.2.5.  Topographic Maps. The NGA catalog of maps, charts and related products, 
has six volumes, each dealing with a portion of the world. The standard tactical maps 
listed in this extensive catalog are generally used for ground navigation and provide 
topographic information for a detailed terrain analysis of the bare base site and its 
surrounding areas. These topographic products can also be ordered through airfield 
management operations. 
4.3.3.2.6.  Climatic Data. The 14th Weather Squadron (formerly the Air Force 
Combat Climatology Center) should be able to provide all the climatic data required 
for planning worldwide military operations. For additional information on obtaining 
support, visit the squadron’s web site at: https://notus2.afccc.af.mil/SCISPublic/. 
Furnish 14 WS a concise statement of requirements in terms of the environmental 
factors involved or the climatic information desired. In many instances, the data can 
be downloaded directly from the website. 
4.3.3.2.7.  Commercial/Government Literature. Another source of general foreign 
country information is brochures and publications written by the countries 
themselves. Contact the respective US Embassy or Consulate for such data. 
4.3.3.3.  Weather and Terrain. It is essential that terrain limitations and opportunities be 
recognized early in the planning process. Since most terrain factors are affected by the 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  63  
weather, it is equally important to understand what these relationships are in the climatic 
region where the bare base site will be located. Paragraphs 4.5 through 4.8 present some 
specific planning considerations related to four major climatic zones—temperate, tropic, 
frigid and desert (the Arctic has been excluded from consideration). Use these 
considerations as a checklist. 
4.3.3.4.  Internet. A good portion of the information planners need can be found by 
“surfing” the worldwide web, where information is readily available on climatic 
conditions, communications, maps, transportation networks and airports. When combined 
with official DOD sources, this public information can help planners prepare for 
deployments. It is better to have too much information, when deploying to an unknown 
location, than to not have enough. 
4.3.4.  Unpublished joint support plans (JSP). Keep in mind that even bases without formal 
JSPs might have been surveyed by a site development or assessment team, particularly if the 
base supports a combatant command OPLAN. Results of an advance assessment should be 
available at the MAJCOM level. The local logistics plans or operations plans shop should 
know which bases are part of an OPLAN. 
4.4.  Expeditionary Site Planning and Survey Process (ESSP) and Installation Geospatial 
Information and Services (IGI&S). 
4.4.1.  Expeditionary Site Planning and Survey Process. The ESSP is a critical source of site 
data for planners. It identifies potential contingency beddown locations and collects site data 
to support decision-making about those locations. MAJCOMs and other organizations 
(AFCESA, RED HORSE, etc) support this effort by providing resources to participate in site 
surveys as directed. Three expeditionary site planning resources engineer planners should 
become familiar with are the Base Support & Expeditionary (BaS&E) Planning Tool, 
GeoReach and Expeditionary Basing, and Geospatial Expeditionary Planning Tool 
(GeoExPT). These resources are briefly described below, but for additional information on 
the ESSP process and major roles and responsibilities see AFI 10-404, Base Support and 
Expeditionary (BAS&E) Site Planning. 
4.4.1.1.  BaS&E Planning Tool is a versatile, web-enabled application delivering the 
capability to collect and centrally store military value data to support beddown planning. 
This expedient identification of resources and critical combat support enables rapid 
assessment for potential beddown locations around the world. Contains access to imaging 
and command surveys and reports, including previous airfield, pavements, threat, and 
initial beddown assessments. 
4.4.1.2.  GeoReach and Expeditionary Basing provides a Common Installation Picture 
(CIP) using information acquired from intelligence sources and assists with various 
planning aspects such as aircraft parking, munitions storage, and other beddown force 
requirements. 
4.4.1.3.  GeoExPT is an advanced expeditionary base planning tool that provides 
automated support for contingency beddown planning and sustainment operations. It uses 
geospatial source data and imagery from MAJCOM GeoReach cells and other national 
geospatial information sources. 
  64  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
4.4.2.  Installation Geospatial Information and Services. IGI&S (formerly called GeoBase) is 
a program that uses Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to capture, store, 
maintain, display and analyze geospatial databases. It is a response to mapping processes 
being decentralized across US installations. While the geospatial structure includes 
information, imagery and imagery intelligence that facilitate planning, decision and action it 
also includes people, processes and resources. IGI&S attempts to deliver situational 
awareness by viewing a single digital map of the installation. Commanders, planners, and 
combat support personnel need access to a common installation picture (CIP) for mission 
success. The CIP is a high-quality picture that allows viewers to see complex, built-up 
infrastructures from desktop computers using point and click steps. When fully developed 
and integrated into planning, the system will include a worldwide database on geography, 
environmental science, geology and ecology. The IGI&S vision is “One installation, one 
map” to eliminate functional stovepipes and provide an authoritative CIP on demand. IGI&S 
enables users to visualize mission assets in a shared, intuitive, cross-functional manner, 
allowing a reduction in the time required for making decisions. IGI&S is currently comprised 
of four unique decision support environments: Expeditionary GeoBase; Garrison GeoBase; 
Strategic GeoBase; and GeoReach. For additional information on these systems and on 
IGI&S, see AFI 32-10112, Installation Geospatial Information and Services (Installation 
GI&S). 
4.5.  Environmental Impact.  Unfamiliar environmental conditions can severely affect civil 
engineer operations. Environmental extremes usually require specialized techniques, procedures 
and equipment. Since there are over 1,200 potential bare base locations scattered throughout the 
world, this discussion on environmental considerations is limited to those that are deemed most 
essential to support planning efforts. 
4.5.1.  Temperate Zones. Temperate zones (Figure 4.1) extends throughout the world and 
includes the variable climates of the middle latitudes, between the extremes of the tropical 
and frigid climates. 
Figure 4.1.  North and South Temperate Zones 
 
 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  65  
4.5.1.1.  Intermediate Hot-Dry Regions. Intermediate hot-dry climates are prevalent in 
parts of the North American continent, Europe, Southern Spain, Africa, Asia and 
Australia. Operational conditions could include an ambient air temperature of 105 to 110 
degrees Fahrenheit, a maximum ground temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit and a 
wind velocity of 5 to 10 knots. A rainfall of 9.5 inches (maximum intensity: 0.45 in/min) 
during a 12-hour period is possible. Rains may be accompanied by intermittent wind 
velocity of 35 knots. Sites may be subject to winds of 45 knots for a 5-minute period; 
gusts may reach 65 knots. Snow and icing conditions are not uncommon in parts of the 
area designated intermediate hot-dry. 
4.5.1.2.  Intermediate Cold Regions. The intermediate cold regions of the temperate zone 
are located in the middle latitudes which encompass Iceland, Central Europe, parts of 
Asia (including the Korean peninsula) and some of the higher latitude coasts, including 
the southern coast of Alaska, where maritime effects prevent the occurrence of extremely 
low temperatures. The intermediate cold region of the temperate zone encompasses much 
of NATO’s Allied Command Europe, which is best characterized by the cold and wet 
environment of Germany. Although there are warm, sunny days in summer and snow is 
common in winter, low overcast skies with rain prevails much of the year. During fall, 
winter and early spring, the fog frequently does not lift until midday. For one third of fall 
and winter mornings, visibility is less than one mile. The cloud layer over Western 
Europe is typically low with easterly movement; ceilings are 1,000 feet or less during 
December-February. In the winter, the ambient temperature may drop to -25 degrees 
Fahrenheit for six continuous hours. Infrequent wind velocities greater than 10 knots can 
be expected when temperatures are that low. Winds are generally less than 10 knots and 
solar radiation is negligible. 
4.5.1.2.1.  The urbanization of Central Europe, particularly Germany, has a major 
impact on military operations. Hundreds of towns and cities have populations over 
50,000. Small villages have grown together and often surround air bases. The 
boundaries of these air bases were fixed 40 to 50 years ago and have not been 
expanded even though each year new missions and buildings were added. 
Additionally, some missions have been consolidated and relocated (e.g. operations at 
Rhein-Main AB moved to Ramstein AB) and have a major impact on space and 
infrastructure at the new location. The positioning of facilities during deployments to 
such crowded bases largely depends on availability of open space. 
4.5.1.2.2.  The Korean peninsula is a rugged, mountainous area with short, hot and 
humid summers and long, cold winters. The heavy rains that occur from June to 
September often cause damaging floods. Similar to Western Europe, air bases in 
Korea are crowded and surrounded by urban growth or extensive rice paddy 
agriculture. 
4.5.1.3.  Planning Considerations for the Temperate Zone. 
4.5.1.3.1.  Site Access. Avoid dense brush, timberland and rolling terrain requiring 
heavy clearing or grading. During terrain analysis, study slopes, drainage, vegetation, 
soil characteristics, flood-prone areas and any other unusual conditions affecting site 
development. 
  66  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
4.5.1.3.2.  Soils. The free-draining, coarse-grained soil, which predominates in most 
regions of the temperate zone, makes the best subgrade and subbase materials and 
exhibits almost no tendency toward high compressibility or expansion. 
4.5.1.3.3.  Roads. Roads should be located on soil composed of grained, non-frost-
susceptible material in regions of temperate zones which are prone to frost heave. 
Where drifting snow is expected, roads should generally be higher than the prevailing 
ground elevation and should not be constructed where existing vegetation or planned 
facility locations could block snow removal. 
4.5.1.3.4.  Solar Orientation. Plan to locate facilities so that energy consumption will 
be minimized without violating the concepts of functional grouping and dispersal. In 
the intermediate hot-dry environment of the temperate zone, orienting the facility’s 
longer side along an east-west axis should minimize shelter wall exposure to the sun. 
In intermediate cold regions, orient facilities so the longer sides of the shelters are 
along a north-south axis to provide maximum solar radiation on walls. 
4.5.1.3.5.  Wind Orientation. The velocity varies with each particular area and season. 
Maximum wind speed occurs during periods of changing temperatures, and 
prolonged velocities above 90 knots have been recorded. Snow and silt begin drifting 
with winds above 8 knots. 
4.5.1.3.6.  Site Drainage. Grade the soil away from exterior walls by use of drainage 
swales. Fill the low spots or grade to drain. 
4.5.1.3.7.  Water Supply Requirements. The water use planning factor for the 
temperate zone is 50 gallons per person per day. 
4.5.1.3.8.  Water Sources. In temperate zones, the best water source is surface 
freshwater from lakes and streams. Other sources include the host-nation water 
system, fresh groundwater (wells, springs and well points), seawater in coastal areas 
and brackish water from swamps, ponds or wells. 
4.5.1.3.9.  Water Treatment. The ROWPU is the primary equipment used to produce 
potable water from seawater and brackish ground and surface water. 
4.5.1.3.10.  Water Storage. Provide 50 percent reserve for peak loads and 
emergencies. In the intermediate cold regions, make provisions for freeze protection 
(see Chapter 8). Immediately consider reducing water consumption (rationing) if 
more serious, longer-term problems arise such as major equipment breakdown or 
battle damage occurs. 
4.5.1.3.11.  Water Distribution. Use pressure class 150 polyvinyl chloride pipe. If 
pressure and temperature exceed 150 pounds per square inch, gauge (psig) and 140 
degrees Fahrenheit, respectively, select steel or reinforced concrete piping. Position 
the pipe below the frost line. Above-ground piping should be electric traced or 
insulated to prevent freezing. Use metal pipe where heat tracing is required. 
4.5.1.3.12.  Sanitary Systems. Install sewer lines below the frost level. 
4.5.1.3.13.  Foundation Requirements. Spread or strip footings are most common for 
moderate loads. Carry depth below the frost line. Allowable bearing values vary due 
to varying soil and subsurface conditions. Use a thickened edge slab with lightweight 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  67  
structures where some slab cracking is permissible. Thicken edge slabs should only 
be used on coarse-grained soils. Use treated wood or concrete for foundations. Use 
treated wood, steel, or concrete piling where loads and low-bearing soil dictate. 
4.5.1.3.14.  Concrete Placement. In cold weather below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, use 
type III air entrained cement, or use richer mixes. Enclose the site with tents or use 
space heaters to keep the concrete warm. Keep concrete forms on longer and insulate 
in cold weather. Speed up strength gain by using calcium chloride (2 percent by 
weight of the concrete). 
4.5.2.  Tropical Zone.  Wet-warm regions in the tropical zone (Figure 4.2) coincide with the 
major tropical rain forest areas of the world. In the western hemisphere, this area extends 
from the southern tip of Mexico through Central America to South America. Wet-warm 
conditions also prevail in the heavily jungled areas of Central and East Africa, Southeast 
Asia, the Asian Islands and the northern coast of Australia. Wet-hot conditions, characterized 
by high temperature and humidity and intense solar radiation, are found in the open tropical 
areas where rain forest gives way to deciduous and secondary forests and tropical savannas. 
The discomforts of tropical climates are often exaggerated, but it is true that the heat is more 
persistent. Many people experienced in the tropics feel that the heat and discomfort in some 
US cities in the summertime are worse than the climate in the jungle. Strange as it may seem, 
there may be more suffering from cold in the tropics than from the heat. Of course, low 
temperatures do not occur, but chilly days and nights are common. In some tropical areas, in 
winter months (the reverse season below the equator), the nights are cold enough to require a 
wool blanket for sleeping. Rainfall in many parts of the tropics is much greater than that in 
most areas of the temperate zones. Tropical downpours usually are followed by clear skies, 
and in most places the rain is predictable at certain times of the day. Except in those areas 
where rainfall may be continuous during the rainy season (for example, in Southeast Asia 
and Asian Islands), there are not many days when the sun does not shine at least part of the 
time. 
Figure 4.2.  Tropical Zone 
 
  68  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
4.5.2.1.  Site Selection. Proper site selection for bare base development is the most 
important element in the tropical zone. Subgrade soil characteristics, groundwater and 
surface drainage are prime considerations for the planners. 
4.5.2.2.  Site Improvements. Site improvements at a bare base located in the tropics will 
generally involve construction and maintenance of taxiways, parking aprons, roads and 
protective revetments and shelters. The dense vegetation, gullies, cliffs, steep slopes and 
streams often found in the proximity of airfields complicate construction in the tropics. 
The heavy rainfall imposes a drainage problem of major concern. Groundwater is usually 
found a few inches below the surface, requiring special attention to subgrade drainage. 
Because of the ponding potential of surface water, parking aprons should be located on 
the runway’s downhill side. It is advisable to cut the right-of-way of roads much wider 
than normal so that the sun can dry the roadbeds. Good fill material is often difficult to 
locate in the tropical environments. Most tropical soils have high clay content, will not 
drain well and are difficult to compact. Bare base roads constructed of such materials fail 
under heavy traffic when wet. Good drainage is vital when these types of soils are used. 
4.5.2.3.  Solar Orientation. Despite the availability of air conditioning equipment, 
adequate protection from the sun should be provided to maintain a comfortable internal 
temperature for facilities (particularly BEAR shelters). Tree cover, man-made screening, 
camouflage netting, or a combination of these methods can produce the desired effect. 
When the bare base site features rolling or hilly terrain on its environs, shelters can be 
placed on the shaded slope (north slope in the northern hemisphere, south slope in the 
southern hemisphere) to reduce exposure to solar radiation. On flat terrain, shelters 
should be sited in an east-west direction, which minimizes wall area exposure to the low 
angles of early morning and late afternoon sun. Reflected radiation also poses a problem 
in the tropics. Avoid siting shelters near large paved areas or bodies of water. 
4.5.2.4.  Wind Orientation. Wet regions in the tropical zone are characterized by mild 
trade winds blowing in the same direction for most of the year. High velocity winds occur 
from several directions during the monsoon season. Effective use of breezes sometimes 
provides the only relief to oppressive heat; nevertheless, solar orientation of facilities and 
shelters should take precedence over wind orientation. 
4.5.2.5.  Water Supply Requirements. Use a water planning factor of 50 gallons per 
person per day in the tropical zone. 
4.5.2.6.  Water Treatment. The ROWPU system will be the primary equipment used to 
produce potable water from seawater and brackish ground and surface water. 
4.5.2.7.  Water Storage. Provide a 50 percent reserve and install screens to protect storage 
facilities from insects and animals. Use bladder pillow tanks where feasible for initial and 
elevated storage for temporary construction. 
4.5.2.8.  Water Distribution. Protect buried water distribution lines from movement 
caused by expansive soils. Use inert sand or gravel base for bedding and backfill. 
Aboveground piping should be insulated and protected with a mold-resistant covering. 
4.5.2.9.  Electrical Power Generation. Advance planning should provide for generators to 
be conditioned for operation in a high-humidity, fungus-promoting atmosphere. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  69  
4.5.2.10.  Interior Electrical. Electrical equipment used in the tropics must be specifically 
designed for use in this zone. 
4.5.2.10.1.  Use circuit breakers with bimetallic thermal elements treated to prevent 
corrosion or galvanic action, or replace them with suitably sealed or protected solid 
state tripping devices. 
4.5.2.10.2.  Use porcelain or fungus- and corrosion-resistant plastic switches and 
receptacles. 
4.5.2.10.3.  Equip motors larger than 1 horsepower, and generators rated above 10-
kW, with heaters that are energized when the units are not running. 
4.5.2.11.  Exterior Electrical. The following special requirements must be considered. 
4.5.2.11.1.  Request salt spray test certification for equipment used in a salt-ladened 
atmosphere. 
4.5.2.11.2.  Use oil-filled transformers that are hermetically sealed or equipped with 
inert gas provided by a nitrogen cylinder. 
4.5.2.11.3.  Use silicon bronze, copper, aluminum encased steel, or hot dipped 
galvanized steel hardware. 
4.5.2.11.4.  Use jute protected, double-type armored cables when directly buried in 
coral backfill. 
4.5.2.11.5.  When buried, use cable that is resistant to roach, termite and microbial 
attack. Ensure all splices are waterproof. 
4.5.2.12.  Foundation Requirements. The raised-point foundation is the best solution for 
the tropics. This type of foundation absorbs much less of the stored heat from the ground, 
allows the floor system to be cooled by natural ventilation and separates the structure 
from the high moisture content of the ground. Slab-on grade systems do work in tropical 
areas, but moisture problems result and heat is absorbed from the ground. 
4.5.2.13.  Concrete Placement. The following procedures are recommended when the 
temperature exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit: 
4.5.2.13.1.  Keep all materials cool and store cement in the shade. 
4.5.2.13.2.  Spray the gravel with water and, if necessary, use ice water in the mix. 
4.5.2.13.3.  Set up windbreaks to prevent rapid water evaporation. 
4.5.2.13.4.  Work at night when temperatures are lower. 
4.5.2.14.  Unique Structural Considerations. 
4.5.2.14.1.  Treated lumber should be used where wood is in contact with soil or 
concrete. 
4.5.2.14.2.  Where field painting is required, structural steel surfaces should be 
cleaned and primed using red lead or zinc chromatic paint. 
  70  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
4.5.2.14.3.  Aluminum alloys are excellent for use in the tropics. When in contact 
with concrete, mortar, or plaster, aluminum gives better service if coated with 
synthetic or rubber-based paint. 
4.5.2.14.4.  Use galvanized steel fasteners. Plain steel corrodes rapidly and promotes 
wood decay. 
4.5.2.14.5.  Use only paints, primers and enamels containing a fungicide to inhibit 
mold growth. 
4.5.3.  Frigid Zones. Frigid zones are generally the coldest parts of the earth and are usually 
covered with ice and snow. Frigid zone conditions exist in the northern hemisphere in 
Alaska, Canada, Greenland, northern Scandinavia and northern parts of Russia (Figure 4.3). 
The entire continent of Antarctica fills the southern hemisphere’s frigid zone. Consider the 
following factors when planning operations in frigid zones: 
Figure 4.3.  Frigid Zones 
 
4.5.3.1.  Deep snow, permafrost, seasonally frozen ground, frozen lakes and rivers, 
glaciers and extreme cold temperatures characterize frigid zones (Figure 4.4). Besides 
climatic effects, the vast distances and isolation influence bare base operations in these 
areas. Frequent high winds and either very short or very long periods of daylight prevail. 
Seasonably frozen ground may exist to depths as great as 12 feet. Special lubricants, 
antifreeze, protective covers and warming equipment will likely be required. Cold 
temperatures make even simple tasks difficult. During the summer, this zone may be 
characterized by numerous and extensive swamps, lakes and rivers, abundant insects and, 
at times, continuous daylight. Spring hazards include flash floods from snow and ice 
melt. Freeze-thaw cycles occur frequently. Engineers accustomed to operating in warm 
weather should be prepared for frigid conditions by proper training that should include 
operation of special-purpose equipment such as snow removal machinery and portable 
duct heaters. This training should also include winterization of standard BEAR assets. 
Operation and maintenance of vehicles, power equipment and utility systems in very low 
temperatures are difficult. Extreme cold may result in rapid deterioration of metal, plastic 
and other materials. Special lubricants may be required as well as antifreeze, protective 
covers and warming equipment. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012

Figure 4.4.  Special Planning Required for Frigid Zones 
 
4.5.3.2.  Temperatures. While temperatures vary considerably between locations during 
the winter season, six continuous hours with an ambient temperature of -50 degrees 
Fahrenheit can be expected in the extreme parts of the frozen zone. Summer maximum 
temperature expectancy is +95 degrees Fahrenheit well inland. 
4.5.3.3.  Winds. The velocity varies with the particular area and season. Maximum wind 
speed occurs during periods of changing temperature and prolonged velocities above 90 
knots have been recorded. Snow and silt begin drifting with winds above 8 knots. High 
winds combined with heavy snow can produce whiteouts capable of bringing movement 
to a standstill. 
4.5.3.4.  Icing Phenomena. Ice fog occurs mainly at temperatures below +20 degrees 
Fahrenheit. At temperatures below -35 degrees Fahrenheit, ice fog may be quite dense 
and could limit visibility to a few feet. 
4.5.3.5.  Site Access. Plan to use trees, shrubs, snow fences, or even structures to keep 
drifting snow from reaching the site proper. In a non-dispersed layout, leave enough 
space between shelters to permit snow removal and locate structures in rows 
perpendicular to the wind. Dispersed shelters should be oriented with their longest axis 
parallel to the wind. During site planning, provide for snow-dumping areas downwind to 
eliminate large piles of snow and windrows in the camp area. 
4.5.3.5.1.  Locate major heat-producing facilities, including heated shelters and shops, 
downhill and downwind from the runway to guard against ice fog. 
4.5.3.5.2.  At least 150 feet should remain open between the near edges of parallel 
runways and taxiways to provide dumping space for removed snow. 
4.5.3.5.3.  Parking aprons should be a minimum width to facilitate snow removal and 
should permit maximum access to planned hangar locations, taking into account the 
prevailing winds. Locate parking aprons on the uphill side of the runway because of 
  72  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
the ponding potential of the surface water. Parking aprons should be placed alongside 
– not upwind or downwind – of hangars and maintenance facilities. 
4.5.3.5.4.  Locate priority facilities toward the downwind end of the bare base where 
they are afforded protection by less important upwind shelters. 
4.5.3.5.5.  When planning to locate a facility, such as a ROWPU near a stream or 
river, be sure to check topographic data for the region to determine the maximum 
high-water level resulting from spring thaws, ice jams and similar conditions. 
4.5.3.6.  Road Construction. Mobility on the bare base may vary considerably during the 
winter season in the Frigid Zone. On frozen ground with minimal snow cover, 
maneuverability is generally excellent. Marginally frozen soil, tundra and thin frozen 
crust rapidly break down under the heavy traffic that can be expected at the deployment 
site. Where no permafrost is found, road construction design and procedures are generally 
the same for a frigid area as for a temperate climate. In permafrost regions where both 
wooded and open areas are available for road locations, it is better to cut through the 
wooded section for the additional protection trees offer against degradation of permafrost 
by radiant heat. Trees also protect against strong winds and snow drifts. Roadway grades 
should not exceed 3 to 5 percent to provide adequate vehicular wheel traction. Wheeled-
vehicle mobility in deep snow can be improved by reducing tire inflation pressure up to 
50 percent. Roads require a crown for surface drainage in summer and a flat crown for 
maximum traction and safety in the winter. Spring and fall grading operations for 
unpaved roads should be an expected requirement. Shoulder slopes of 5:1 should be used 
to prevent snowdrifts in open areas. Slopes may be a conventional 1-1/2:1 in protected 
areas. For longitudinal elevations, avoid cut sections where possible. Fill sections with 
minimum slopes of 4:1 should be used. 
4.5.3.7.  Solar Orientation. In subarctic areas, the long axis of shelters should be an east-
west direction to take advantage of the maximum solar exposure. However, since the 
solar radiation received is small, the direction of prevailing winds should be the deciding 
siting factor. 
4.5.3.8.  Utility Systems. Adequate planning will be required to provide the necessary 
freeze protection. For water storage and distribution, preheating the water at the source, 
using the M-80 water heater, should be one of the first considerations. Where feasible, 
use electric trace and insulated lines. 
4.5.3.9.  Field Sanitation. Maintaining proper field sanitation in a frigid climate presents 
some unique problems. Edible garbage should be burned to avoid attracting roving 
animals, bears in particular. Get the pest managers involved in planning to control the rats 
and mice, which are commonly found in great numbers in most of the habitable cold 
regions of the world. 
4.6.  Desert Regions.  Desert regions, for the purpose of this discussion, is described as two 
different climate subzones: the hot-humid coastal desert and the hot-dry interior desert. 
Characteristics common to both desert subzones are an arid, barren environment with stark 
contrasts of temperature, terrain, vegetation and weather. Temperatures vary according to 
latitude and season, from over 136 degrees Fahrenheit in Mexico and Libya to the bitter cold of 
winter in the Gobi desert in East Asia. In some desert areas, day to night temperature fluctuations 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  73  
can exceed 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Annual rainfall may vary from zero to 10 inches and is often 
totally unpredictable. Desert terrain also varies from place to place, the sole common 
denominator being lack of water with its consequent environmental effects (Figure 4.5). 
4.6.1.  Coastal Desert. Hot-humid conditions are limited to the immediate coast of bodies of 
water having a high surface temperature, such as the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. These 
areas experience the highest water vapor in the world. In these coastal desert regions, 
relatively high temperatures (about 100 degrees Fahrenheit) often combine with large 
amounts of water vapor in the surface air. Higher temperatures occur occasionally, but 
humidity levels will not be as extreme. The reverse season daytime minimum temperature is 
32 degrees Fahrenheit. Nighttime temperatures are moderate: 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit in 
the summer and 30 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter. 
4.6.1.1.  Expect a one-hour rainfall of 4 inches with a maximum intensity of 0.45 inches 
per minute and an intermittent wind velocity of 35 knots. Although annual total and 
frequency of rainfall are much less in hot-humid and hot-dry desert climates than in 
tropical and intermediate climates, when rainfall occurs it is often a quick, violent deluge 
causing flash flooding. 
Figure 4.5.  Rocky Desert Terrain 
 
4.6.1.2.  Bare base sites will be subject to winds of 45 knots for a 5-minute period with 
gusts to 65 knots. Prevailing winds blow from northwest or southeast almost exclusively. 
4.6.2.  Hot-Dry Subzone. Hot-dry conditions are found in the deserts of Northern Africa, the 
Middle East, Pakistan, India, Southwest United States, Northern Mexico and Australia. 
During the hottest month in a normal year, the temperature may be above the intermediate 
hot-dry extreme of 100 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 10 percent of that month. In 
Northern Africa temperatures exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit as much as one percent of the 
hottest month. Substantial desert areas on all continents have long periods with temperatures 
above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the hottest month. The temperatures cited are shelter/shade 
temperatures taken 4 to 6 feet above the ground. Note: Equipment operating in direct 
sunshine will be exposed to temperatures 30 to 50 degrees higher than the shade temperature. 
  74  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
4.6.2.1.  Humidity in the hot-dry desert subzone is low, ranging from 5 to 20 percent. 
During the reverse season, expect a minimum temperature of about 25 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
4.6.2.2.  A one-hour rainfall of 4 inches with a maximum intensity of 0.45 inches per 
minute and an intermittent wind velocity of 35 knots can be expected. Temperatures 
during heavy rainfall will be lower than 80 degrees Fahrenheit. 
4.6.2.3.  Sites are subject to winds of 45 knots for a 5-minute period with gusts to 65 
knots. Prevailing winds blow from northwest or southwest almost exclusively. 
4.6.3.  Planning Considerations for the Desert Zone. 
4.6.3.1.  Site Access. Of the several landforms found in the desert zone, the Piedmont, 
Coastal Plain and Mesa are the most suitable for site development and are the ones most 
likely to have water sources nearby. An increase in elevation in the Piedmont and Mesa 
regions causes the temperatures and the relative humidity to decrease. Wind ventilation is 
also greatly improved. The Piedmont area slopes down from the mountains. Slopes facing 
away from the equator are preferable because they receive less solar radiation and have 
lower temperatures. Coastal plains slope toward the sea and suffer from high humidity. If 
the planned site will be located in this area, water availability and wind circulation will be 
more important planning considerations. 
4.6.3.2.  Trafficability. In the desert, rainfall and drainage seldom present problems. Soil 
is normally trafficable to all-wheel drive vehicles. After prolonged traffic, dust and 
blowing sand will become bothersome. Dust control can be achieved with minimal 
compaction and expedient grading effort followed by sprinkling with an asphalt 
emulsion, diesel or fuel oil, or even crude oil. Saltwater is a good treatment for unpaved 
roads at the bare base site. For additional guidance on mitigating dust at contingency 
locations see Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 09-3, Chemical Dust Control for 
Contingency Roads, Base Camps, Helipads, and Airfields. 
4.6.3.3.  Solar Orientation. Plan to locate bare base facilities with their long axis in an 
east-west orientation to minimize exposure to the low-angled sun and to reduce the 
creation of shadows. 
4.6.3.4.  Wind Orientation. Winds in desert areas are practically unceasing and can 
achieve almost hurricane force. Because the wind moves great amounts of hot dry air, it 
has severe dehydrating effects. The wind carries fine soil particles, which clog 
mechanical systems, accumulate on every surface and can restrict visibility to a few 
yards. The Sahara “Khamseen” for example, can last for days at a time, although it 
normally only occurs in the spring and summer. Khamseen means “fifty” in Arabic and 
refers to the wind blowing for 50 days. The deserts of Iran are equally well known for the 
“wind of 120 days,” with sand blowing almost constantly from the north with wind 
velocities up to 75 miles per hour. At the bare base the wind can be lifted, deflected and 
guided with a perimeter berm to shelter height, particularly on the prevailing wind side. 
Also consider placing the long side of shelters perpendicular to the prevailing wind. 
Experience has shown this orientation helps keep sand out of the tents. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  75  
4.6.3.5.  Site Drainage. During site layout, avoid low-lying areas or “wadis,” in the 
desert. Sudden and intense rains may cause flash flooding. Rainfall generally occurs 
during the winter season. 
4.6.3.6.  Water Planning Factor. In a true bare base environment, the scarcity of water in 
a desert zone makes proper water planning, conservation and discipline critical issues. Do 
not exceed the water use planning factor of 30 gallons per person per day. 
4.6.3.7.  Water Sources and Treatment. Plan to use ROWPUs to produce potable water 
from seawater and brackish ground and surface water sources. Resupply aircraft, tanker 
trucks, water trailers and bulk containers or pillow tanks strapped to flatbed trucks are 
additional water sources. Well water is available at various depths under most deserts; 
however, such water is seldom of potable quality without employing a ROWPU process. 
4.6.3.8.  Water Storage. In the desert, every effort should be made to store drinking water 
at a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Earth cooling and night radiation could be 
used for cooling if mechanical cooling units are not available. Make provisions to use 
water chillers with water trailers or alternate bulk storage containers to provide small 
quantities of cool water reserved for human consumption only. 
4.6.3.9.  Water Distribution. Exposed water distribution lines (flexible hose type) must be 
insulated to prevent freezing. 
4.6.3.10.  Electrical Power Generation. Plan on installing sunscreens to protect the 
equipment from the intense solar radiation. Enclosures are not practical due to the 
excessive heat buildup. Equally important will be efforts to provide additional generator 
cooling capacity, using add-on radiators to allow generators to operate above their rated 
ambient temperature, normally 125 degrees Fahrenheit. Since the expected generator 
failure rate is above normal, plan on maintaining an adequate stock of replacement parts. 
4.6.3.11.  Electrical System Operation. Generator output is somewhat degraded in desert 
conditions. Units will continue to operate until one of its safety devices triggers, alerting 
to one of the following: high water temperature, high oil temperature, low fuel level, low 
oil pressure, or high alternator temperature. Some safety cutoffs can be manually 
overridden in critical situations. However, low oil pressure and high alternator 
temperature should never be overridden. 
4.6.3.11.1.  Underground or on-the-ground power distribution is recommended in the 
desert zone. On-the-ground cable should be protected from sunlight and blowing 
sands as much as practical. When crossing a road, the cable should be underground 
and protected by PVC conduit. 
4.6.3.12.  Sanitary Systems. Expect a minimal sewage flow due to water scarcity. In areas 
with acute water shortage, consider recycling wastewater from showers and laundry for 
nonpotable purposes such as dust abatement, concrete mixing, firefighting and aircraft 
and vehicle washing. 
4.6.3.13.  Shelter Foundation Requirements. Sand, when confined and compacted, makes 
an excellent base or foundation for BEAR shelter facilities. Wind erosion, particularly at 
the corners of the shelters, can be prevented by gravel backfill or chemical stabilization. 
Drifting sand can be controlled by placing snow fences at critical locations. 
  76  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
4.6.3.14.  Ventilation Considerations. Take advantage of winds for ventilation. Hot, dry 
daytime winds must be lifted, deflected, or guided away from shelters. In low humidity 
regions with large variations between day and night air temperatures, ventilation should 
be as high as possible at night to cool down the interior walls. During the day, the 
ventilation should be as low as possible so that hot air will not raise the temperature of 
interior surfaces. In high humidity (coast desert) regions with little change between day 
and night air temperatures, there should always be ventilation for facilities not served by 
air conditioning. 
4.7.  Existing Facilities and Resources.  Time is usually a critical factor in bare base 
deployments. Given all the possible contingency scenarios that may constrain the airlift of BEAR 
assets, an imaginative and prompt approach to planning the use of existing resources will be a 
key determinant of success or failure of the engineer support mission. Working and living space 
provided by mobile facility assets will only meet minimum essential requirements. Do not turn 
down any reasonable opportunity to use existing facilities to cover facility space shortfalls, 
improve working and living conditions, or supplement mobile assets. 
4.8.  Supplies and Construction Materials.  Providing bare base upgrades, expansions, or 
repairs requires large quantities of materials. However, there are many potential sources of 
supplies and construction materials overseas. The challenge is to locate the needed materials, 
then determine how to acquire them. Sources may be on base, in the local area, in-theater, or in 
CONUS. 
4.8.1.  Base Supply. The first place to check is the official source, the standard base supply 
system. In some overseas locations, USAF main operating bases support deployment sites by 
processing requisitions. Bare base planners can expedite requisitioning by providing base 
supply the current stock numbers of common engineering materials. The nomenclature of 
AM-2 mat and accessories, sandbags and lumber may mean little to a supply specialist while 
valid stock numbers mean everything. Materials not in stock locally will be backordered 
from CONUS by base supply and shipped in by air or sea, depending on the priority. In a 
large contingency, airlift will be severely constrained, and it is not reasonable to expect that 
construction materials will preempt more important cargo. 
4.8.2.  Headquarters Staff. The staffs at numbered air force, MAJCOM headquarters, and 
combatant command theater staffs are an important source of material support. These staffs 
are generally aware of in-theater assets—either prepositioned WRM or stockpiles of 
deployed materials not in the standard supply system. Depending on other in-theater 
priorities, these assets may be available to support the bare base mission. Working through 
these headquarters elements, particularly those that might be in-theater or deployed forward, 
often produces more responsive results than standard requisitioning methods. The important 
point is: to ask for help and keep asking because headquarters staffs are there to assist. 
4.8.3.  Other Engineer Units. If certain materials are either not available or carry an 
unacceptable long lead-time, other local military units should be considered as a potential 
source. These include the host-nation base engineer, nearby host-nation, US Army combat 
engineer units or US Navy “Seabees.” 
4.8.4.  Local Purchase. Another possible source of material is the local economy. This is 
especially appropriate for bulky materials (cement, crushed stone, select fill, asphalt and 
lumber), which require significant airlift if shipped from a CONUS source. Local purchases 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  77  
require assistance from contracting, finance, an interpreter and a competent civil engineer to 
identify the right materials. Several common tools and factors for quickly converting lengths, 
volumes and measurements are included in Attachment 4 and Attachment 5 of this volume. 
Additionally, various internet sites provide free use of conversion applications and 
calculators. Some of the more popular ones include: http://www.onlineconversion.com; 
http://www.metricconversion.ws; 
and 
http://www.infoplease.com/pages/unitconversion.html. Also the “Google©” search engine 
will provide a conversion tool just by entering the conversion factors in the search box (for 
example enter “convert dollars to euros”). Local construction contractors are familiar with 
nearby sources of engineering materials. Experience has shown that blanket purchase 
agreements with local suppliers work well during contingencies where response and delivery 
are critical. Cultural differences have a definite effect on local purchase procedures. In many 
SWA countries for example, small businesses are accustomed to working strictly on a verbal, 
cash basis. They may regard written contracts and invoices as unnecessary or even as an 
insult to their integrity. Prices are generally not fixed, but are established by bartering. 
Sensitivity to local customs is recommended even if planners cannot always follow them. 
4.9.  Host-Nation Support Agreements.  Air Force units deployed in past expeditionary 
operations were often tenants on bases belonging to the host nation. As tenants, Air Force civil 
engineers frequently relied on the host base engineers for assistance. The Air Force paid for 
much of this support. Even with reimbursement, good working relationships were important to 
the progress of base development. At many of these bases, joint support plans or country-to-
country agreements defined the responsibilities for both the tenant and the host. Future 
deployments will also benefit from good host relationships. Some installations in Europe and 
joint-use bases in Korea are covered by JSPs, which list the facilities the host nation has agreed 
to share with, or turn over entirely to US forces upon deployment. In locations such as SWA, the 
US funds construction of facilities on host-nation bases for US use. For a base without a JSP or 
similar agreement executed prior to deployment, mutually acceptable arrangements for facility 
use, maintenance, work approval and reimbursement may have to be worked out informally and 
then approved by appropriate US and host-nation authorities. In these scenarios, early 
coordination with the servicing Staff Judge Advocate is strongly advised. 
4.10.  Hardening Requirements.  Hardening requirements have to be addressed if the base is 
situated in a high threat area. The simplest style of hardening is to use sandbags, revetments, 
soil-filled steel bins, or soil-filled containers of any type that can be stacked and fastened 
together to form a wall (Figure 4.6). Testing has shown that for expedient revetments a 
thickness-to-height ratio no less than 40 percent provides reasonable stability against tipping 
over from a blast. While hardening effectively counters the threat from conventional munitions, 
it consumes great amounts of scarce manpower, materials and time. Revetment construction 
should be planned according to the priority of the resources to be protected. Aircraft come first, 
followed by command post, communications, functional control centers, billeting shelters, water 
pumps and treatment plants, fire vehicles, remaining working areas and so on as threat levels and 
other work dictate. Revetment descriptions are contained in Chapter 6 of this volume. 
Construction details are included in Volume 2 of this pamphlet series. 
  78  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
Figure 4.6.  Concertainer® Revetment Material 
 
4.11.  Camouflage and Concealment Requirements.  Camouflage and concealment measures 
are almost as costly as facility hardening in terms of manpower, materials and time. Camouflage 
and concealment refers to the capability to reduce the effectiveness of attacking air and ground 
forces and reconnaissance assets. The nature of the threat, the importance of the base mission 
and the vulnerability of the base all affect the requirement and priority for establishing 
camouflage and concealment measures. To be practical, these measures must concentrate on 
decreasing the range of target acquisition by delaying recognition of targets and by concealing or 
decoying valuable assets within target areas, thus hampering precision bombing. Camouflage 
and concealment includes the principles of hide, blend, disguise and decoy to protect friendly 
assets and aim points with materials and equipment that alter or obscure part or all of their 
multispectral signatures. Camouflage net systems are an optional BEAR equipment item. See 
AFH10-222, Volume 10, Civil Engineer Camouflage, Concealment, & Deception (CCD) 
Measures for more information on this topic. 
4.12.  Environmental Considerations.  The USAF is committed to achieving and maintaining 
environmental quality to ensure long-term access to the air, land and water needed to protect US 
interests. Maintaining a high level of environmental awareness and compliance during 
contingency operations presents a difficult challenge. All personnel involved in these operations 
have a role to play in protecting the environment. The goals of the AF Environmental Quality 
Program during contingency operations are to minimize risks to human health and the 
environment while maintaining readiness and accomplishing the mission. These goals are 
divided into five areas: protection of personnel; pollution prevention; planning for hazards; 
managing environmental functions; and mitigation and restoration policies. For additional 
information on the duties and responsibilities of engineers with respect to environmental 
programs during contingencies, see AFH 10-222, Volume 4, Environmental Guide for 
Contingency Operations Overseas.

MANPOWER PLANNING 
5.1.  Introduction.  Operational commands require its civil engineers to provide the flexibility to 
employ weapons systems without dependence on other command organizations. Civil engineers 
are located at most major AF bases and are totally integrated into the bases’ peacetime force 
structure. These engineers are organized as Prime BEEF teams and accompany each flying 
squadron deployed to a bare base. The support they provide encompasses everything from force 
beddown and routine O&M to emergency and follow-on damage repair of the airbase. Each bare 
base will have a different airfield layout, site conditions and other criteria that will dictate the 
degree of engineering effort needed to prepare the site and sustain the base. A typical bare base 
could be a commercial airport or allied military airfield, of which the AF is given use, along with 
a water source and an area to erect BEAR facilities. In some cases, there may be facilities and 
services that can be used in lieu of BEAR assets. For example, an allied military airfield may 
have adequate airfield lighting, aircraft arresting systems and fire protection services to support 
the deploying flying mission. In some cases, billeting or similar support may also be available 
and would negate the need for certain BEAR facilities. Likewise, electrical power, water and 
waste systems may be available without further augmentation or development. Factors such as 
these dictate the overall level of effort needed to establish, operate and recover a bare base. The 
responsibility for identifying the specific engineer support requirements belongs with planners 
from both the overseas theaters and gaining commands. To aid in this endeavor, this chapter 
assumes a worst-case scenario—that there is no host-nation beddown support and no facilities, 
utilities or services other than those provided in BEAR support packages. Under this scenario, 
bare base operations will depend largely upon Prime BEEF and RED HORSE resources. 
5.2.  Overview.  This chapter describes the Prime BEEF beddown force structure; phases of 
beddown operation; typical beddown, operation and maintenance and base recovery tasks; and 
factors which affect the productivity of the engineer force. Planners should review the entire CE 
UTC structure in AFI 10-210 for manpower and equipment force packaging (MEFPAK) 
guidance. 
5.3.  Roles and Mission.  While deterring nuclear attack will remain the US’s national defense 
priority, deterrence using conventional forces remains essential in addressing conflicts that could 
threaten US interests and allies. Deterrence requires that US forces be flexible, rapidly 
responding, precise and lethal with global reach. USAF activities during Operations 
ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM are examples of this conventional deterrent in 
practice. In all cases where a mobile response was required, emphasis was placed on accelerated 
force projection and rapid initial beddown. Prime BEEF forces played key roles in these 
situations, assisting in the beddown and support of combat and air mobility forces and enabling 
operational commanders to display US national resolve and intent. Prime BEEF personnel must 
be able to mobilize and deploy at least as fast as the flying squadrons they support; able to 
provide immediate beddown, FES, EM and EOD support regardless of location; capable of 
performing base recovery quickly and effectively; and able to sustain base operations 
irrespective of the age, condition, or type of facilities. 
5.3.1.  Engineer Employment Concept. The primary mission of AF engineers is to provide 
force beddown and aircraft beddown. Prime BEEF teams install deployable facilities and 
  80  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
utilities, conduct light repair and rehabilitation of existing bare base facilities and utilities and 
accomplish other contingency general engineering work required to make the bare base ready 
to conduct flying operations. Prime BEEF personnel have the responsibility for bare base 
operations and maintenance, sustainment of the AEF wing, squadron or group mission or 
support for joint operational units. This includes operating and maintaining USAF aircraft 
arresting systems, airfield lighting, utilities and facilities and providing engineering support 
such as FES, EOD, Pest Management and environmental support and waste collection and 
disposal. Prime BEEF forces are also responsible for emergency repair and recovery 
operations if the bare base is damaged. Prime BEEF forces are deployed by UTCs and 
identified as teams or individuals. 
5.3.1.1.  While team components and UTC designations may change, most Prime BEEF 
deployment operations follow traditional roles of civil engineer deployment teams. Prime 
BEEF teams deploy with the necessary command and control, individual protective 
equipment and clothing, weapons and ammo establish a beddown location, beddown 
incoming forces and support flying operations. Additionally, separate engineer UTCs 
provide FES; chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) passive defense and 
emergency management; EOD support; RED HORSE support; and staff augmentation. 
Additionally, two UTCs are provided by HQ AFCESA (airfield pavement evaluations 
and civil engineer maintenance, inspection and repair). 
5.3.1.2.  Additional engineer UTCs are brought in as the size and mission requirements of 
the bare base increase. Additional EM and EOD UTCs may be brought in based on threat 
and local operational support conditions. 
5.3.1.3.  Prime BEEF team members bring individual protective clothing, hand tools and 
selective team equipment. Separate UTCs for most construction equipment, special 
vehicles and bulk supplies are deployed to support personnel UTCs. Supporting UTCs 
and other programs provide specialized equipment/systems, O&M and sustainment 
support above the requirements in the basic engineer and augmentation UTCs. These 
include BEAR assets, WRM, personnel and equipment UTCs from 49 MMG, and 
AFCAP. 
5.3.1.4.  Tailored UTCs are used to adjust resources to the realities of operations 
requirements, timing and force capabilities. Adjustment often occurs when follow-on 
forces deploy to an AEF location and sustainment operations are required rather than 
beddown-buildup. Also, tailored UTCs may be used when special requirements are 
needed to support an operation or mission. In some cases, the tailored civil engineer force 
is included in a MAJCOM-unique team UTC, such as an AMC first-in operation or 
AFSOC mission. However, any AEF base with qualified personnel could be tasked to 
provide a tailored UTC for this type support. 
5.3.2.  Logistic Support. It is essential that a logistical support relationship be established 
when Prime BEEF teams are deployed to a theater of operation. Full logistic responsibility 
must rest with the theater MAJCOM being supported. This responsibility should include but 
is not limited to intelligence, communications, coordination and liaison with other agencies, 
personnel replacement, medical evacuation, transportation and vehicle maintenance support, 
rations, ammunition, beddown and construction materials, POL, maps, blueprints, charts and 
resupply. If engineer resources cannot reasonably be expected during the early phases of 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  81  
deployment and employment, the responsible theater MAJCOM must pursue other avenues 
to support the engineer teams; for example, individual mobilization augmentees (IMA), host-
nation support and contract support. Engineer teams at each beddown location will provide 
their own capability to set up internal supply operations to include determining requirements 
and requesting, receiving, storing and distributing items necessary to fill engineer needs. 
5.4.  Beddown Force Structure.  Engineer forces deploying from a single or possibly several 
different CONUS and theater locations will develop the bare base site, facilities and utilities 
(Figure 5.1). There can be several types of these forces; sometimes working alone, sometimes in 
combination. 
Figure 5.1.  Engineer Team Assembling a Medium Shelter System 
 
5.4.1.  Prime BEEF. From a bare base perspective, the Prime BEEF UTCs are the basic 
engineer manpower components. Historically, these UTCs were sized to support a squadron 
of aircraft and a standard 1,100-person deployed base population. In order to provide 
flexibility, particularly for joint missions, a CE transformation initiative has created a 26-
person basic engineer team (BET) UTC. The BET represents the basic CE capability, 
regardless of mission, and is rounded-out by support UTCs. It must be remembered, 
however, that Prime BEEF teams are not heavily equipped and only have basic toolboxes and 
rudimentary team kits. The exception is EOD, which has a drive-on/drive-off capability as 
well as all the necessary equipment and explosives to operate. Vehicles, major shop 
machinery and all materials must be provided by separate UTC support packages, as 
prepositioned assets or via local contract support. See Attachment 6 for a list of Prime BEEF 
and other engineer manpower planning factors that may be tasked to participate in beddown 
activities. 
5.4.1.1.  Engineering and Operations. Responsibilities include bare base operations, 
maintenance and sustainment of airfields for AF and joint beddown. Capabilities include 
maintaining airfield lighting, arresting systems, airfield surfaces, roads and BEAR 
  82  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
facilities. Also performs pest management, environmental and contract support, base 
recovery after attack and light horizontal/vertical construction. 
5.4.1.2.  Emergency Management. Responsible for effective CBRN defense planning and 
swift disaster response operations. Capabilities include developing plans, training and 
equipment to respond to major accidents, natural and manmade disasters, HAZMAT and 
CBRN attack or terrorist use of CBRNE. 
5.4.1.3.  EOD. Responsible for locating, identifying, disarming, and disposing of 
hazardous explosives and ordnance. Capabilities include aircraft emergency recovery, 
force protection, recovery of airfields denied by ordnance, range clearance, counter-mine 
operations and support to organizations providing protection to US and foreign 
dignitaries. 
5.4.1.4.  FES. Responsible for aircraft rescue firefighting, emergency medical support 
and fire prevention education. Other capabilities include protecting life and property and 
HAZMAT mitigation. 
5.4.1.5.  Staff Augmentation. These “S-teams” provide C2 for CE at MAJCOM level. 
Capabilities include expertise in construction management, technical design and 
expeditionary site planning. 
5.4.2.  RED HORSE. RED HORSE is a self-sufficient, mobile heavy construction squadron 
capable of rapid response and independent operations in a Level 1 threat environment (see 
AFDD 3-10 for definitions of the different threat levels). RED HORSE supports force 
beddown requirements, siting and installation of air transportable facilities and equipment, 
well-drilling, aircraft arresting system installation and can repair enemy-inflicted damage or 
damage by friendly forces (Figure 5.2). RED HORSE teams have the internal capability for 
its own housing, medical, food service, vehicle maintenance, logistics planning, contracting 
and (limited) security. These forces are deployed with their own heavy construction 
equipment, tools and a limited amount of rations. Yet, it may take up to 30 days for all the 
equipment to join up with the deploying forces. Therefore, during the first 30 days of any 
anticipated bare base operation involving RED HORSE, prepositioned or indigenous 
equipment will be required. Bare base planners, however, must remember RED HORSE 
squadrons are a limited resource. Even with Air Reserve Component (ARC) forces fully 
mobilized, only a few RED HORSE squadrons are available. If major concurrent 
construction activities must be performed at several bare base locations, rigid prioritization of 
projects must be maintained to avoid diluting and fragmenting RED HORSE efforts.

personnel possessing in-depth knowledge and unique expertise on BEAR equipment. Under 
normal operations, the 49 MMG is manned for storage, supply accountability, maintenance, 
training and logistics planning responsibilities for mobility assets stored at Holloman AFB, 
New Mexico (Figure 5.3), or at forward storage and maintenance locations. During bare base 
contingency operations, the 49 MMG plays a major role in the preparation for shipment, 
installation, erection and on-site maintenance of BEAR facilities.

5.4.4.  Other Engineers. Other heavy construction support, such as Army engineer 
construction forces, Navy Seabees, or local contractors, should be considered for special 
tasks, such as airfield resurfacing, ramp and apron expansions, installation of aircraft 
  84  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
arresting systems, well drilling, large earth moving projects and follow-on war damage 
repair. 
5.4.5.  Local Nationals (LN). A potentially large source of manpower is the hiring of LNs. 
Also known as indigenous labor, these are citizens of the host nation. During the Korean and 
Vietnamese conflicts, LNs provided a major part of the work force to construct, operate and 
maintain USAF facilities. Hired individually or by contractors, LNs have worked as 
equipment operators, electricians, carpenters, masons and unskilled laborers. They have also 
been employed in the white-collar jobs such as administration, engineering design, drafting 
and production control. Availability of LNs during future deployments, especially the more 
skilled people, will depend on local economic conditions and local threat. If the host nation 
has mobilized for war, labor may be scarce, but military reserve units and national 
construction organizations may be able to assist in bare base development work. 
5.4.6.  Users. As mentioned earlier in this volume, individual organizations should erect their 
own shelters (TEMPER tents, ESCs, user-unique ISO containers) with technical aid from 
CE. If this requirement is circumvented and engineers are tasked to erect all shelters, it could 
cause major delays in engineers establishing utility systems and accomplishing other critical 
tasks. 
5.5.  Manpower Requirements.  As mentioned in Chapter 2, bare base deployments normally 
occur with the phased movement of personnel, equipment, and supplies according to the AETF 
Force Module Construct. While some engineer representation is present and vital during the open 
the airbase and C2 deployment phases, the bulk of the engineer work force and the majority of 
engineer tasking will be realized during the establish, operate, and robust the airbase phases of 
the deployment. 
5.5.1.  Manpower Employment. Manpower employment and intensity fluctuates during the 
deployment phases. Demands on manpower will likely be more intensive initially, then 
gradually moderate as the base transitions to other phases of deployment. Transition from the 
establish the airbase phase to the operate the airbase phase for all work functions will not 
necessarily occur at the same time. For example, power plants and electrical distribution 
systems may be installed well ahead of water and waste distribution systems. Runways may 
meet all lighting and aircraft arresting system requirements and would transition immediately 
into the O&M phase. During the establish the airbase phase, the most critical skills are 
utilities, electrical, power production, heating and air conditioning, liquid fuels and 
equipment operations. The level of civil engineer support required during the establish the 
airbase phase will not change radically at the lower base population locations because the 
tasks of preparing runways and taxiways, installing airfield lights, constructing POL and 
ammunition areas and installing utility systems remain relatively constant regardless of base 
population levels. 
5.5.1.1.  Establish the Airbase Phase. The prompt beddown of deploying units is critical 
to mission success at contingency bare bases. Rapidly expanding bare bases will require 
the minimum facilities essential for air combat operations. Some existing facilities may 
have to be expanded or modified, or mobility shelters will have to be erected. During the 
early stages of deployment, engineer duties will not only concentrate on force beddown 
but also on preparation of the base to withstand the shock of an attack. Those activities 
include erecting mobile assets, installing backup power, hardening priority facilities and 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  85  
utilities and stockpiling and dispersing war reserve materiel. To provide enhanced base 
security from ground attack, heavy equipment operators will clear, cover, remove 
obstacles and sculpture terrain on and immediately off base to provide the integrated 
defense force with clear fields of fire and to deny the enemy and terrorists access to the 
base. If time allows prior to an attack, engineers will attempt to isolate utility systems to 
reduce the possibility of additional damage resulting from an attack. Engineers may be 
working around the clock. Nighttime operations may or may not be lit, and construction 
equipment will produce high noise levels throughout the base and surrounding area. 
Personnel will require time to become familiar with the base layout; as a result, 
disoriented vehicle and pedestrian traffic can be expected in unusual locations. Since 
construction equipment is generally not equipped with radios, operators and drivers must 
work from written or verbal orders. The following list, although not inclusive, shows the 
magnitude of the work projected for the beddown phase. See Attachment 6 for planning 
factors for CE contingency tasks. Additionally, Attachment 7 provides engineers a quick 
reference of useful information and examples related to bare base planning and 
development.

5.5.1.1.16.  Hardening critical facilities and utilities. 
5.5.1.2.  Operate the Airbase Phase. After completing the initial beddown, engineers must 
provide operations, maintenance and services for essential facilities and utilities required 
to support bare base operations. The following functions are involved: 
5.5.1.2.1.  Supporting force beddown of AF units and weapons systems. 
  86  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
5.5.1.2.2.  Accomplishing operation and maintenance functions for existing, as well 
as newly installed, BEAR facilities and utilities. 
5.5.1.2.3.  Providing fire emergency services and fire suppression. 
5.5.1.2.4.  Providing liaison with 49 MMG to ensure ample BEAR technical expertise 
is on-hand. 
5.5.1.2.5.  Enhancing base C2 and overall survivability by providing wartime training 
and exercise support. 
5.5.1.2.6.  Selectively upgrading minimum quality expedient facilities to standards 
better capable of supporting sustained operations. 
5.5.1.3.  Base Recovery. After an attack, engineers will concentrate on restoring air 
operations as quickly as possible. Damage assessment, expedient airfield repair and 
emergency war damage repair to utility systems and priority facilities throughout the base 
complex will be necessary. The working environment could be laden with unexploded 
ordnance; contain disrupted utilities (live electrical lines, spewing fuel lines, broken 
water lines, raw sewage discharge, etc.); be subject to multiple, uncontrolled fires; 
include damaged facilities and pavements; and possibly be contaminated with chemical 
agents. Additionally, there may be casualties who must be rescued and attended to before 
repair efforts can begin in earnest. After minimizing the threat of air attack, engineers 
will begin replacing expedient repairs with more permanent repairs. In some cases, Army 
engineers may perform construction management of AF construction activities during 
rebuild of airfields, utilities, facilities and roads. If, as a last resort, denial operations are 
required, engineers may be directed to deny the enemy items that contribute to the war 
effort. This might include equipment, facilities, utilities, runways, roads and items of 
intelligence value. Engineer supplies and equipment will be evacuated whenever 
possible. 
5.5.1.4.  Levels of Effort. Expedient force beddown, airfield damage repair and war 
damage repair are typically based on a 72-hour workweek (each person working six days 
on 12-hour shifts). All other civil engineer operations and maintenance manpower 
requirements are typically based on a 60-hour work week (six days on 10-hour shifts). 
Manpower requirements also include the use of multi-skilled efforts whenever possible. 
5.5.1.5.  FES Manning. Staffing for FES activities is typically based on the fire protection 
vehicle requirements (see CE Supplement to WMP-1, Appendix 5). The bare base host 
MAJCOM will determine the structural vehicle requirements, while the bare base’s 
assigned aircraft, sortie rate per day and number of aircraft on the ground will determine 
FES vehicle requirements. As a result, additional vehicles above the basic set identified 
in Allowance Standard 012 may be required. Once total fire protection vehicle 
requirements are known, staffing requirements can then be identified. 
5.5.2.  Factors Affecting the Engineer Force. All the planning covered in this volume are 
meaningless unless engineers—the human factor in the bare base equation—are capable of 
operating and surviving under adverse conditions. The following paragraphs are addressed 
not only to the planners, but to the CE organization as a whole. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  87  
5.5.2.1.  Training. Mission success in a theater of operations depends on the level of 
individual and unit training. Engineers must train the way they expect to fight. Engineers 
must train to be innovative, because shortages of supplies, equipment and manpower will 
demand it. Training must stress flexibility and multiskilling capabilities, because 
casualties and unforeseen situations will challenge character. Engineers must train in 
combat skills, as well as their primary and secondary AF specialties. Field exercises must 
stimulate and test physical and mental limits to build stamina and minimize the trauma of 
war. Engineers must train for all conceivable missions in all kinds of weather and climate 
and for all types of CBRN considerations. And in preparation for violent and lethal 
conflicts, engineers must receive, as a minimum, enough defensive training to give them 
a reasonable chance of survival. CE officers and NCOs must train to be leaders in the 
wartime environment. As leaders, they must be imaginative, innovative and reliable. In 
summary, engineer proficiency depends on adequate training and professional leadership 
at all levels of command. In order to meet these demanding requirements, engineers must 
be prepared technically, physically and psychologically to operate in environments of 
extreme stress and must train at base level to work as teams. Every effort must be made 
to incorporate engineer training scenarios into wing-level training plans and exercises. 
This is critical in tying engineer wartime capabilities to the operational mission. 
5.5.2.2.  Survivability. Engineers are vital to sustaining forward combat operations. 
Engineers must be able to perform the most critical wartime taskings under chemical 
warfare conditions and be thoroughly knowledgeable of the procedures for wearing 
individual protective equipment, accomplishing shelter processing and responding 
properly to the various stages of alert. They must be capable of decontaminating limited 
areas and their own equipment and supply items. Engineers must also be able to repair 
and service the mechanical/electrical systems that support personnel shelters and 
decontaminate equipment and attack warning systems. 
5.5.2.2.1.  Engineers will be working in areas that could be laden with hundreds of 
unexploded ordnance. They must be trained to recognize signs of potential danger 
and what actions to take, or not to take, in the vicinity of unexploded ordnance. 
Engineers must be able to identify, report and mark such munitions. 
5.5.2.2.2.  Engineers may also be subjected to a high volume of direct or indirect fire 
while engaged in wartime recovery or even stability operations. They will likely be 
enemy targets of opportunity, since damage recovery work assignments and 
equipment will draw attention and be recognized as essential to sustaining air 
operations. Engineers may also be tasked to travel to and perform duties in the less 
populated areas of the base or in limited security areas outside the wire. Due to the 
variety and number of engineer work assignments, it will not be possible to provide 
on-scene, full-time armed protection for each work crew. Consequently, engineers 
could be vulnerable to attack by enemy forces, saboteurs, snipers, or terrorists. Prime 
BEEF personnel require work party security/convoy training and weapons to defend 
themselves from such attacks, until security forces fire teams can arrive to engage the 
hostile force and pull back to a safer area. In some situations, engineers may be called 
upon to help defend the base and may represent the difference between success and 
failure. During conflicts, engineers must rely on hardened vehicles, protected 
positions, deception, withdrawal and personal weapons for survivability. HQ 
  88  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
AFCESA/CEXX has developed home station training courses on work party security, 
tactical convoy operations, team leading procedures, weapons handling, and other 
subjects to help prepare engineers for this task. Many of these courses are located on

at: 
https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp. Tactical convoy procedures is also 
addressed in AFTTP 3-2.58, Tactical Convoy Ops. 
5.5.2.2.3.  Also in the area of survivability, engineers must be prepared to implement 
dispersal and hardening activities. During beddown of forces, the vulnerability of 
mobile facility, equipment and material assets must be considered in terms of the 
potential enemy threat. If threat conditions warrant, assets should be dispersed within 
the practical limitations of distance and utility support capabilities. Make maximum 
use of natural cover and camouflage techniques. Hand-in-hand with dispersal actions 
are hardening activities. Engineers must be able to perform a wide range of hardening 
tasks. Revetting aircraft will be a requirement in almost any contingency of moderate-
to-long duration in a high-threat environment. Engineers must be capable of 
hardening the most critical base facilities and utilities. They have to be prepared to 
use any available materials and methods ranging from concrete and metal revetment 
to earth berms and sandbags. Engineers used commercial, prefabricated defensive 
wall systems (Figure 5.4) during Operations IRAQI FREEDOM and ENDURING 
FREEDOM to mitigate and protect from small arms, rocket propelled grenades and 
mortars. 
Figure 5.4.  Defensive Walls Increase Survivability 
 
5.5.2.3.  Morale. During contingencies, high morale can make the difference between 
success and failure. Good leadership, discipline, comradeship, esprit de corps and 
devotion to a mission cultivate morale. Together, these quantities—all inspired through 
unit integrity—make people endure and show courage in times of fatigue and danger. In a 
contingency situation, engineer tasks of operations, maintenance and repair will be many 
times more demanding. Engineers will be asked to work faster with fewer people, fewer 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  89  
materials will be available, no detailed planning will have been accomplished, the 
environment will be foreign or perhaps hostile and there will be little room for error. 
These situations make the need for cohesion and unity more important than ever. In the 
final analysis, it may well be the quantity of unit integrity, and not the number of 
engineers and special equipment, that will make the difference.

Chapter 6 
AIRFIELD REQUIREMENTS 
6.1.  Introduction.  The airfield is defined, for the purpose of this pamphlet, as that part of the 
bare base devoted to the operation of aircraft. A typical airfield consists of runways, taxiways, 
hardstands, aprons and other airfield pavements. NAVAIDS, aircraft arresting systems, airfield 
lighting and markings, overruns and approach zones are also part of the airfield environment. 
However, the prerequisites for a bare base airfield demand only a usable runway, taxiway and 
parking area (Figure 6.1). Supporting areas such as aircraft parking aprons, arm and dearm pads, 
hot cargo off-loading pad, aircraft turn-around points and taxiways may require construction, 
modification, or upgrade to meet AF standards and mission requirements. 
Figure 6.1.  C-17 Landing at a Bare Base Airfield 
 
6.2.  Overview.  Working on the assumption that the bare base airfield meets its basic 
prerequisite, this chapter will describe the essential features of a runway, lists dimensions of 
aircraft and associated runway clearance requirements and then addresses the equipment and 
facilities needed to make the runway operational. 
6.3.  Bare Base Mission.  It is critical to first determine the number and types of aircraft 
assigned to the base, identify all available aircraft parking areas and determine turn-around 
requirements (servicing, refueling and rearming). It is important to remember that even though 
many missions may be built around tactical aircraft, transport aircraft will airlift some or most of 
the BEAR supplies to the base. Consult AFPAM 10-1403, Air Mobility Planning Factors, when 
reviewing peacetime and wartime planning factors for air mobility aircraft. Bare base planning 
should consider airlift and tactical aircraft and, in some cases, strategic aircraft or unmanned 
aircraft systems. The ability of the bare base to accept, park and turn-around these aircraft must 
be evaluated as soon as possible. Limiting factors must be identified and transmitted to higher 
headquarters, enabling them to configure or schedule only aircraft that can properly land and 
carry out their mission. The data derived from the airfield evaluation also serves as the basis for 
any rehabilitation or upgrade effort required to make the bare base fully mission capable. 
6.4.  Airfield Planning Criteria.  Design requirements for runways are based on MAJCOM and 
theater guidance. However, UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, provides 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  91  
standardized criteria for layout, design and construction of runways, helipads, taxiways, aprons 
and related facilities, as well as dimensions for lateral clearance. Use this UFC during initial 
planning when determining runway criteria and layout requirements. Adjust the criteria as 
necessary in coordination with airfield management and wing flight safety offices based on 
theater and MAJCOM deployment requirements. ETL 09-6, C-130 and C-17 Landing Zone (LZ) 
Dimensional, Marking, and Lighting Criteria, provides dimensional, marking, and lighting 
criteria and guidance for planning, design, construction, and evaluation of landing zones (LZ) for 
aircrew training and contingency operations of C-130 and C-17 aircraft. Also, ETL 09-1, 
Airfield Planning and Design Criteria for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), provides guidance 
and criteria for planning and designing airfields that support operations of UAS presently fielded. 
When airfields support large numbers of cargo aircraft, such as during joint operations and when 
Civil Reserve Air Fleet aircraft are used, consider AFPAM 10-1403, Table 1, Aircraft Airfield 
Restrictions, for evaluating airfield capabilities. 
6.5.  Runway Requirements.  The essential features of a runway are its length, clearances (both 
on the ground and in the surrounding airspace) and surface condition. Required pavement 
strength is also important and is a function of aircraft type, weight and the amount of traffic 
expected. For general concepts and design criteria for airfield pavements, consult UFC 3-260-02, 
Pavement Design for Airfields. Also check aircraft-specific references and MAJCOM guidance 
for minimum runway lengths and widths by aircraft type and model. Although a normal landing 
or takeoff may use only part of the runway, adequate length and clearance is also needed to 
recover safely from emergencies. At each end of the runway is the clear zone. Runway end and 
clear zone details are illustrated in Figure 6.2. 
Figure 6.2.  Runway End and Clear Zone Details 
 
6.5.1.  In addition to the minimum runway dimensions, up to 1,000 feet of paved or 
compacted overrun should be provided at each end of the runway. Each end clear zone 
include the overruns. Clear zones should not contain any tree stumps, raised slabs, steep 
ditches or similar objects that would present a hazard to an out-of-control aircraft. The 
approach-departure clearance surface is an imaginary surface that forms the “floor” of the 
glide path. Except as shown in ETL 09-6, for C-17 and C-130 LZs, the approach-departure 
clearance surface begins 200 feet from the end of the runway (see Figure 6.2). It rises at a 
gradual slope from both ends of the runway, extending for several miles. No tree, utility pole, 
water tower, or elevated terrain feature should penetrate the approach/departure surface. In 
addition to the end clear zones, lateral runway clearances are also important safety features, 
  92  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
especially when aircraft encounter control problems or strong crosswind conditions. The 
runway lateral clearance zone's lateral limits coincide with the limits of the primary surface 
(Figure 6.3). The ends of the lateral clearance zone coincide with the runway ends. The 
lateral clearance zone width is measured perpendicularly from the centerline of the runway 
and begins at the runway centerline. The clearance zone width is 1000 feet unless ETL 09-6 
criteria apply. The ground surface within this area must be clear of fixed or mobile objects. 
Runway shoulders, which should always slope away from the runway, are generally paved at 
permanent bases. At bare bases, runway shoulders should at least be dust stabilized. 
Extending out from the shoulders on both sides of the runway is a graded area. As a 
minimum, this area is rough graded to the extent necessary to minimize damage to aircraft. 
Slopes are to be as gradual as practicable and avoid abrupt changes or sudden reversals. 
Taxiing aircraft, fire emergency vehicles, aircraft arresting systems and navigational aids 
(when essential for their proper functioning) may be allowed in the runway lateral clear zone. 
Figure 6.3.  Runway Lateral Clearance Zones 
 
6.5.2.  Runway surfaces that are usable during initial bare base operations must be monitored 
and repaired as necessary to support continued sortie production. Additionally, bare base 
airfield management and maintenance programs should include regularly scheduled runway, 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  93  
taxiway and ramp sweeping as well as debris collection. This will minimize the damaging 
effects of the environment on aircraft operating in an austere location. Planners should ensure 
runway sweeping equipment is provided during the initial establishment of the bare base. 
6.6.  Taxiway Requirements.  Bare bases that support a broad mix of aircraft require 75-foot 
wide taxiways. At a minimum, taxiways should be at least 60 feet wide to allow the use of C-17s 
during initial operations. Taxiway shoulders are normally paved/stabilized: 10 feet wide for 
fighter aircraft and 25 feet wide for most other aircraft. Taxiways require lateral clearance but no 
end clearance unless they serve as emergency runways. The lateral clearance to fixed and mobile 
obstructions is 200 feet from the taxiway centerline. This can be reduced per ETL 09-6 for initial 
contingency operations with C-130s and C-17s. 
6.7.  Apron Requirements.  There are no standard sizes for aircraft parking aprons. Aprons are 
individually designed to support specific aircraft and missions at each installation. The detailed 
dimensions are determined the by size, type and number of aircraft that require parking and 
maneuvering space and by the type of activity the apron serves. For bare base planning purposes, 
refer to AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements, and UFC 3-260-01 for specific apron dimensions 
and aircraft clearance requirements. 
6.7.1.  Estimating New Apron Requirements. For broad planning purposes, the following 
method in AFH 32-1084 is used to estimate new apron requirements: Multiply the wingspan 
of the selected aircraft by its length. Multiply the product by a factor of 5.3 (use a factor of 
4.4 for fighter-type aircraft). Example: To estimate apron requirements for 10 C-141 aircraft, 
multiply: 48.8 m x 51.3 m x 10 aircraft x 5.3 factor = 133,000 m2 of apron needed. This is a 
planning tool for sizing new aprons only. Do not use it to estimate the number of aircraft 
(specifically, large aircraft) that can park on an existing apron. Many variables (e.g., 
length, width, and taxi lane locations) determine an existing apron's suitability to support 
specific aircraft types. At existing bases, develop a conceptual aircraft parking plan to 
determine the apron square meter requirements. 
6.7.2.  Parking Aircraft on an Existing Apron. Operational aircraft are parked on mass 
aprons, strip aprons, or where authorized, on dispersed stubs. To determine how many 
operational aircraft require apron space, proceed as follows: Begin with 100 percent of the 
assigned aircraft as established by official OPLANs; from this subtract any aircraft that are 
located on separate aprons, such as alert aircraft. Subtract the aircraft that are normally 
located in maintenance hangars under maintenance schedules. And finally, subtract any 
aircraft that are parked elsewhere on existing pavement or hardstands. Following are other 
factors affecting the size and configuration of aprons for operational aircraft: 
6.7.2.1.  Aircraft Parking Arrangements. Aircraft are generally parked in rows on an 
apron and spaced according to their dimensions (Table 6.1) and specific clearance 
requirements. This spacing permits aircraft to move in and out of parking places under 
their own power. Figure 6.4 illustrates a typical parking arrangement. Parking 
arrangements should be studied carefully to achieve the parking layout that requires the 
least amount of pavement per parked aircraft. 
6.7.2.2.  Fighter Aircraft. Fighter-type aircraft are often parked at a 45° angle (Figure 
6.5). This is an efficient way to achieve adequate clearance to dissipate the temperature 
and velocity of jet blast to levels that will not endanger aircraft or personnel; that is, 
about 38° C (100° F), and 56 kilometers per hour (30.4 knots).

6.7.2.3.  Rotary-Wing Aircraft. Mass parking of rotary-wing aircraft will require an apron 
designated for rotary-wing aircraft. Parking for transient rotary-wing aircraft at aviation 
facilities where only a few rotary-wing aircraft are assigned, may be located on aprons 
for fixed-wing aircraft. As with fixed-wing aircraft aprons, there is no standard size for 
rotary-wing aircraft aprons. Rotary-wing aircraft at Air Force facilities are parked in a 
layout similar to that of fixed-wing aircraft. Parking space, taxilane, and clearance 
dimensions will be based on the rotor diameter of the specific aircraft assigned to the 
facility. The wingtip clearance criteria provided in AFH 32-1084 is preferred. However, 
the Army criteria in UFC-3-260-01 may be used for all rotary wing aircraft except CH-53 
and CH-54 (Figure 6.6). Air Force rotary-wing parking apron dimensions are based on 
the aircraft dimensions and separation distances for parked helicopters given in Table 
6.2. For a rough estimate of the apron area needed, obtain the block area each helicopter 
occupies by multiplying its operating length by its operating width, then multiply each 
block area by 13. The apron is usually part of, or contiguous to, the main airfield apron.

6.7.2.4.  Taxi Lanes. Interior and peripheral taxi lanes must exceed the required width for 
aircraft parked in the area if larger aircraft must taxi through en route to docks, hangars, 
or pads. Example: If E-4s taxi past a ramp of F-16s, taxi lane should be based on the 
wingspan of the E-4. Confine this width variation to the fewest taxi lanes possible.

6.7.2.5.  Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In addition to planning and designing 
airfields that support manned aircraft, engineer planners may find it necessary to consider 
support for UAS operations as well. UFC 3-260-01, supplemented by ETL 09-1, 
provides basic criteria and requirements for UAS airfields. Like other aircraft, UAS are 
generally parked in rows on an apron and spaced according to their dimensions. See 
Table 6.3 for specific UAS dimensions.

6.8.  Airfield Lights.  If airfield lighting is required, contingency forces can install the portable 
EALS available in BEAR. 
6.8.1.  The EALS can be used to support runway surfaces up to 150 feet by 10,000 feet and 
can be installed and secured on all types of surfaces, e.g., sand, frozen earth, mud, ice, 
asphalt and concrete. Packaged on six trailers (Figure 6.7), the system is air transportable, 
fitting within the space of three standard-sized transport pallet positions. The system includes 
runway edge lighting, approach lighting, threshold/end lighting, taxiway lighting, precision 
approach path indicator lights, distance-to-go marker lighting and obstruction lighting. Also 
included are a regulator, control panel, numerous transformers and various lengths of cable. 
6.8.2.  A six-person crew can normally layout and install the EALS on a minimum operating 
strip (50 feet by 5,000 feet) in approximately 2½ hours. Further details on setting up and 
operating the system can be found in AFH 10-222, Volume 7, Emergency Airfield Lighting 
System (EALS,) and Technical Order (T.O.) 35F5-3-17-1. 
Figure 6.7.  EALS Trailers 
 
6.9.  Aircraft Arresting Systems.  While there are several types of aircraft arresting systems in 
the AF inventory, the MAAS is the type most often used in a bare base situation. The MAAS can 
be installed either by RED HORSE or Prime BEEF personnel. 
6.9.1.  The MAAS consists of two, trailer-mounted rotary friction energy absorbers (Figure 
6.8). Its primary purpose is to provide for rapid deployment of aircraft recovery capability. 
The MAAS enables high cycle arrestment of hook-equipped tactical aircraft on airfields not 
having a compatible, permanently installed arresting system or those that have been 
expediently repaired after base attack. The MAAS is easily transportable by air or land and 
can be set up on various surfaces ranging from soil to asphalt to concrete. Each MAAS is 
equipped with a BAK-12 energy absorber. 
  100  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
Figure 6.8.  Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (Towed) 
 
6.9.2.  While the MAAS is capable of bidirectional engagements, the basic MAAS is 
configured for unidirectional engagements of aircraft weighing up to 40,000 pounds and does 
not allow for wide-body aircraft operations, nor does it provide for both approach and 
departure end engagements. A MAAS upgrade kit has been developed to overcome these 
limitations. The kit employs a lightweight fairlead beam which permits the MAAS trailers to 
be moved back a maximum of 200 feet from the runway edge and improves the overall 
capability of the system. The kit contains two 1,500-foot nylon tapes, two lightweight 
fairlead beams and numerous anchoring components. All the items except the fairlead beams 
are organized in reusable shipping containers, and the entire kit is trailerized and air 
transportable. 
6.9.3.  The size of the MAAS installation crew and the time required to install the system will 
be dictated by the contingency situation. However, on average, an experienced 12-person 
crew should be able to install the MAAS in less than one hour. 
6.9.4.  The MAAS is currently an optional BEAR equipment UTC. Detailed installation and 
operating instructions for the MAAS are contained in AFH 10-222, Volume 8, Guide to 
Mobile Aircraft Arresting System Installation, and T.O. 35E8-2-10-1, Arresting Systems, 
Aircraft, Mobile. 
6.10.  Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS).  If not already available at the bare base, NAVAIDS 
must be installed. The basic criteria for locating NAVAIDS are listed below. Final siting and 
installation are the responsibility of communications organizations. Whenever possible, install 
NAVAIDS in accordance with UFC 3-260-01. 
6.10.1.  Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN). TACAN should be located no closer than 500 
feet from the runway centerline. 
6.10.2.  Radio. The physical location is flexible. A clear area for the scope antenna is 
required. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  101  
6.10.3.  Radar Approach Control (RAPCON). Should be located a minimum of 500 feet from 
the runway centerline in a clear area where both approaches can be observed. The search 
antenna should be clear in all directions. 
6.10.4.  Mobile Air Traffic Control Tower. The mobile control tower (Figure 6.9) should be 
located a minimum of 500 feet from the runway centerline in a location which provides 
visual surveillance of all taxiways and runways. 
6.10.5.  Wind Cone. Should be located in an area visible to taxiing aircraft and should be at 
least 400 feet from the centerline of the runway. 
Figure 6.9.  AN/TSW-7 Mobile Control Tower 
 
6.11.  Aircraft Revetment.  Enemy air, artillery, rocket and ground attacks against a bare base 
are likely to concentrate on aircraft which are by far the most lucrative and, when parked in the 
open, the most vulnerable targets available. Consequently, when the bare base site is located in a 
high-threat area, plan to provide revetments for the protection of parked aircraft (Figure 6.10). 
6.11.1.  Revetment Protection Features. Revetments protect parked aircraft from three 
dangers. First, they block shrapnel and deflect the blast from near misses by enemy aerial 
munitions and indirect fire weapons (artillery, rockets and mortars). Second, revetments 
screen aircraft from direct fire weapons on the ground. Third, revetments can prevent chain 
reaction explosions from one aircraft to the next. Dispersed revetment cells on separate 
parking pads (Figure 6.11) provide greater protection from air attack because they are point 
targets rather than line targets. Where dispersed revetment parking is not possible, revetments 
can be erected on the mass-parking apron in one or more of several cluster arrangements 
(Figure 6.12). The “U” shape cluster arrangement could be erected along a taxiway if AM-2 
matting is available for parking pads. The multiple groups, “H” shape cluster arrangement 
provide each aircraft protection on three sides and have no line-of-sight to other parked 
aircraft. Line of sight parking posed a problem in Vietnam where parked aircraft were 
occasionally destroyed despite revetments because forward firing weapons on one aircraft 
pointed directly at other parked aircraft. The drive-through cluster layout shown in Figure 
6.12 allows quick entry and exit, but lacks the protection of a third wall. With proper 
  102  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
positioning of the drive-through clusters, aircraft in adjacent rows still have line-of-sight 
protection.

6.11.2.  Standard Revetments. Several types of revetment systems are available; however, the 
one most likely to be available is the B-1 Revetment Kit. Although no longer in the BEAR 
package, the revetments are available as theater WRM assets. A standard kit contains 21 
sections, each 12 feet long, and provides 252 linear feet of steel bins that are 16 feet high and 
nearly 7 feet wide. For bare base planning, one revetment kit is required for one tactical 
aircraft. Two revetment kits are required for each cargo or strategic aircraft; however, since 
two B-1 kits do not provide sufficient material for dispersed revetment cell construction, one 
of the cluster arrangements shown in Figure 6.13 must be used for large aircraft. Revetments 
are assembled from 16- and 18-gauge corrugated steel panels pinned together with ¼-inch 
diameter rods (Figure 6.14). Assembled in place, the bins must be filled with soil, sand, or 
gravel. Detailed assembly instructions, list of materials, packing information and equipment 
required for B-1 assembly are contained in T.O. 35E4-170-2, Aircraft Revetment Kit, Type B-
1.

6.11.3.  Non-standard Revetments. Non-standard aircraft revetments can be constructed from 
shipping containers, timber cribs, retaining walls of wood or matting, berms of piled earth or 
soil cement and sandbags. Also, several other revetting systems are commercially available 
and employed by other military services (Figure 6.15). See AFH 10-222, Volume 14, Guide 
to Fighting Positions, Obstacles, and Revetments, for detailed employment methods and 
assembly instructions for revetments. 
6.11.4.  Critical Airfield Facility Revetments. Coordinate with other base agencies to 
determine which airfield facilities should be protected by revetments. Facilities commonly 
protected include utility plants and substations, squadron operations, command posts and 
communications, to name a few. When standard revetment materials are in short supply, it 
may be necessary to depend on non-standard expedient revetments to protect equipment 
essential to sortie generation.

ELECTRICAL UTILITY SYSTEMS 
7.1.  Introduction.  BEAR electrical packages consist of both high- and low-voltage systems. 
Traditionally, high-voltage systems are associated with large (1,100-person) base populations; 
low voltage systems primarily with smaller (550-person) base populations. As new assets come 
into the inventory, low-voltage systems are being upgraded to high-voltage capability. High-
voltage generators are 3-phase, 4,160 volt primary distribution and low-voltage system are 
(120/208 volt) (Figure 7.1). High-voltage systems must be used when ECUs are deployed. 
Figure 7.1.  Typical BEAR Low-Voltage Generator 
 
7.2.  Overview.  The chapter provides a brief discussion of planning for electrical systems and 
power plant dispersal and environmental considerations. For specific operator and technician-
level information on BEAR electrical power assets, see AFH 10-222 Volume 5, Guide to 
Contingency Electrical Power System Installation. 
7.3.  General Guidance. 
7.3.1.  Dispersed Layout. For maximum efficiency of both people and equipment, the 
optimum mode of operation is to generate all the primary power at a centrally located power 
plant. However, a dispersed layout could prevent the total loss of generating capability in an 
area with a high-threat of attack. Plan on providing separate power plants, each separated by 
distances of 1,500 to 3,000 feet. Plants should be electrically tied together to allow a back-
feed capability in the event of enemy bomb damage. It also allows operators to switch 
generators off during periods of light load and maintenance shutdown. 
7.3.2.  Environmental Effects. High ambient temperatures can adversely affect the 
performance of BEAR electric generator sets. To help reduce these effects, generator sets 
should be located and spaced so that the prevailing winds (Figure 7.2) will carry the heat 
away from adjacent generators and occupied areas. It is recommended that these sets be 
shaded from direct sunlight to prevent engine overheating, derating output and generator 
  106  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
shutdown. Additionally, these sets should be protected, to the highest practical extent, from 
blowing dust and sand entering cooling air intakes. Air intakes must not be restricted or heat 
will buildup and cause loss of power. This cannot be overemphasized. Protect air intakes 
and exhaust ports on non-operating sets and fuel and oil tanks during servicing operations. 
An accelerated maintenance schedule must be expected when operating in high-temperature 
and arid environments. A pressure washer for cleaning radiators should be procured early on 
during the initial stages of beddown. Keeping radiators clean is essential to providing reliable 
power. Specific recommendations are also in AFH 10-222, Volume 5, but from an overall 
perspective planners can avoid some problems by considering the following guidelines: 
7.3.2.1.  Locate generator sets as far apart as feasible, consistent with other requirements. 
7.3.2.2.  Place generator sets on a line perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction. 
7.3.2.3.  Avoid placing generator sets in direct sunlight, if possible. A shelter may have to 
be provided to shield units from the sun. Camouflage netting and screening can reduce 
heat-related failures on bladders and other major components, but should be configured 
to ensure they do not insulate the equipment and hold in the heat. 
7.3.2.4.  Do not attempt to bypass the thermal control, since excessive temperature can 
cause catastrophic damage. 
7.3.2.5.  Where possible, reduce the effects of blowing sand and dust by using a shelter. 
7.3.2.6.  High ambient temperatures influence the maximum allowable current in cables. 
Heat buildup within current-carrying conductors will not dissipate rapidly in high-
temperature environments. Therefore, current-carrying ability of conductors must be 
reduced when installed in areas of high ambient temperature since an excessive increase 
in cable temperatures will cause insulation failure. High ambient temperatures also affect 
protective devices such as fuses, fused cutouts, time delay fuses, circuit breakers and 
motor control contactors. Additionally, sand and dust tend to build up in these electrical 
components causing operational problems. Finally, the standard methods for power plant 
or distribution system grounding will not offer adequate or safe grounding because of the 
extremely poor electrical conductivity of sand, sandy soils, or rocky soils when dry. 
Figure 7.2.  Generator Positioned to Allow Prevailing Winds to Disperse Heat 
 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  107  
7.3.3.  Electrical Distribution. Initial electrical power is normally provided to command 
posts, squadron operations facilities, control tower, communications systems and other 
mission-essential facilities using mobile, low-voltage MEP generators. Once the high-voltage 
power plant and distribution system are installed, electrical power can be provided to non-
essential facilities, and the MEP generators can be used for emergency backup. A typical 
electrical distribution system for an 1100-, 2200-, and 3300-person camp is illustrated in 
Figure 7.3 through Figure 7.5 During construction, the base civil engineer may make an 
operational risk management decision to leave some or all of the high-voltage cable on the 
surface if soil conditions, time or equipment constraints prevent its immediate burial. But, 
engineers must take other measures to mitigate the risk of personnel injury or damage to the 
cables. At a minimum, bury or otherwise protect cables crossing roads and high-traffic 
walkways. Keep detailed maps of underground lines and the locations of splices and ensure 
utilities and communications personnel are aware of the layout. Locally constructed overhead 
primary distribution systems are not recommended because of the difficulty in designing and 
constructing a safe system given limited available materials and engineer labor.

Figure 7.5.  Electric Distribution for an 3300-Person Camp (Typical) 
 
7.3.4.  Power Conditioning. If power conditioning is required, the user must provide this 
capability with the specific equipment that requires conditioned power. Most BEAR assets 
work well with most types of incoming power, and at worst “hiccup” a bit when the power 
drops out or fluctuates. Computers, on the other hand, can corrupt data or stop working when 
subjected to power fluctuation. Equipment such as power supply units, surge/spike filter 
power boards, power filters and uninterrupted power supplies may all be used to overcome 
surges, sags, spikes and outages. 
7.3.5.  Host Nation Power. A major assumption often included in exercise scenarios—and in 
this chapter—is that host nation electric power will not be available for, or is not compatible 
with, bare base power demands. However, many countries do have limited electric power 
distribution networks that would be useful when troops start to build the base. If host nation 
power is available, plan to use it to supplement BEAR generation capability; this will vastly 
reduce fuel consumption. The base must, however, maintain its own internal generation and 
distribution system in case host nation power is cut off. Most power grids outside the US and 
Canada use power generated at 50 cycles or hertz (Hz), single- or 3-phase, which can be used 
in many cases to power electric lights and heating elements. However, only equipment 
specifically designed as compatible with 50 Hz power should be connected. Most AF 
equipment and utilities are designed for 60 Hz, and operating at 50 Hz will cause permanent 
damage. Table 7.1 lists electric power characteristics available in various countries around 
the world. For additional quick reference, Attachment 2 lists the diversity of electric power 
and its characteristics in various countries of SWA. It should be noted that the quality of 
  110  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
power in SWA is generally poor, frequency stability and voltage regulations are often 
substandard and high-level voltage transients are possible.

7.4.  Low Voltage Electrical System.  The urgency of most bare base deployments dictates that 
electrical utility lines and distribution panels be provided on the ground on short notice. This 
type system depends solely on the use of low-voltage generators. It is not sized to accept air 
conditioning loads, however it can provide lighting and duplex convenience outlets for billeting, 
organizational shop, administrative, office and command-level tents. These type systems depend 
primarily on 30-kW and 60-kW generators. Low-voltage electrical distribution systems provide 
open loop (one path of power flow to the load), 120/208-volt, 3-phase power. 
7.4.1.  Electrical Computation. Computations of generator demands and feeder peak loads are 
based on 4,500 watts or 4.5-kW per tent. That product is then multiplied by a 0.7 
diversification factor. MEP generators are capable of 10 percent overloads for several hours 
at a time and should be able to handle peak loads. If the load exceeds the generator’s 
capability, low priority branch circuits can be shed until a safe operating range is achieved. 
7.4.2.  Generators. A 550-person population can normally be powered by either two 60-kW 
or four 30-kW generator sets. Running generators is a labor-intensive operation. Engine 
failures and breakdowns will inevitably occur, and response and repair times will be 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  111  
lengthened due to field conditions. Fueling generators will be a constant task since typical 
day tanks must be refilled approximately every six to eight hours. Ideally, refilling generators 
should be accomplished using a refueling vehicle, but under contingency conditions, it may 
be necessary to resort to towed fuel trailers or even “jerry” cans. 
7.5.  High Voltage Electrical System.  The high-voltage electrical system is basically composed 
of three major components: power generation, high-voltage primary distribution (4,160-volt) and 
low-voltage secondary distribution (120/208-volt). 
7.5.1.  Power Generation. In many cases primary power will be obtained from 750-kW 
diesel-driven electric generator sets, like the MEP-012A (Figure 7.6), providing 3-phase, 
4,160-volt, 60-cycle power. The MEP-012A generator is towable by most bare base vehicles 
and is air transportable. Normally, three generators are required to provide power to a 1,100-
person base and a fourth generator is required to provide periodic rotational maintenance 
capability. These generators permit routine maintenance to be performed on all units on a 
preplanned basis without having to purposely shut down major portions of the base electrical 
system. Obviously, the number of generators required will depend on the mission and 
population at the particular location. Also supporting the power generation system is a 
predetermined set of spares and consumable used for performing required maintenance and 
routine operations. 
7.5.2.  Installation. Procedures for setting up power generation plants and primary and 
secondary distribution can be found in AFH 10-222 Volume 5. 
7.5.3.  Generator Plants. The controls for the generators are normally assembled on a panel 
located inside a small shelter system, an expandable shelter container, or TEMPER tent. Plan 
on manning generator plants around the clock with at least a two-shift operation. Electrical 
personnel can augment power production personnel in this regard. Also plan on providing a 
generator training program for personnel not fully familiar with the operation of the 750-kW 
units. Communications squadrons usually deploy with their own power production personnel. 
It is generally useful to try absorbing these personnel into the plant’s operation to help spread 
the workload over the entire power mission. Recommend the forward headquarters be 
contacted as soon as possible for sustainment manning once the total manpower requirements 
are determined. In addition, put consumable parts on order as soon as possible to start the 
logistics flow. Use the item listing attached to the support and spare boxes as a guide.

7.5.4.  Generator Fuel System. 10,000-gallon-size fuel bladders are provided for generator 
sets (Figure 7.7). The objective is to have approximately a 7-day fuel supply at each power 
generation plant. Ensure the fuel bladders are positioned equal to or higher than the fuel 
distribution manifolds. Fuel berms or dikes should not be built higher than necessary to 
contain the contents of the bladder in the event of a collapse. Excessively high berm walls 
pose siphoning and gravity feed issues that are hard to overcome in a field environment. 
Refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 1, AFPAM 23-221, Fuels Logistics Planning, and T.O. 
37A12-15-1, Collapsible Fuel Bladders, for other fuel dike or berm construction details. 
Where feasible, convert temporary bladders to above ground steel tanks for long duration 
deployments.

7.5.5.  Interim Power Unit (IPU). The IPU is fielded to supplement BEAR high power UTC 
shortfalls. The versatile IPU has a prime power rating of 1100kW and provides 3-phase, 
2,400-/4,160-volt 60-cycle power. It consists of a generator set housed inside a 40-foot ISO 
container mounted on a 40-foot trailer (Figure 7.8). The unit has sound-reduction features, 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  113  
switch gear, battery and starter components, shore power components, and a 300-gallon fuel 
tank. It has remote control capability and weighs approximately 52,000 pounds. 
Figure 7.8.  Interim Power Unit (IPU) 
 
7.5.6.  Electrical Computation. The layout of facilities (including maximum dispersed 
distance) should be compatible with the electrical distribution system assets available in the 
BEAR equipment packages. If deployment is to a low-threat area where maximum dispersal 
is not required, minimum spacing distances may be used between facilities. This non-
dispersed pattern will reduce cable requirements considerably. In contrast, however, when 
facility layout is widely dispersed due to terrain features or other constraints, it may be 
necessary to have a sufficient stock of extra cables of different lengths so that some 
secondary circuits can be extended. AFH 10-222, Volume 5 describes the power 
requirements for each element within a facility group, presents example feeder schedules and 
shows schematics of a basic electrical distribution system. The feeder schedule provides 
examples of the various electrical loads of different SDCs and methods of supplying power 
to air conditioners and to mobile electric power, where necessary. 
7.5.6.1.  Computation of electric feeder loads is accomplished using data from shelter 
configuration agencies and applying appropriate diversification factors. All loads are 3-
phase. The total load for each SDC is determined by first adding all the shelter loads; 
second, diversifying this total by multiplying by seven-tenths (0.7); and lastly, adding 
either the heater or air conditioner load, whichever is larger (the heater and air 
conditioner should not run simultaneously). The resulting load is the total kVA load on 
the SDC. A quicker way to estimate requirements is to figure one SDC per every eight to 
twelve facilities (take into account that shelter occupants will invariably install and use 
personal electrical appliances). 
7.5.6.2.  If power is required in remote areas of the base, some facilities can be satisfied 
by: (1) running power from an adjacent shelter exterior receptacle, (2) fabricating a 
junction box to service one or more of the facilities simultaneously from one 60-amp 
connector on the SDC, or (3) using the generator on a TF-2 light cart (Figure 7.9) or 
similar lighting unit. 
  114  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
Figure 7.9.  TF-2 Light Carts 
 
7.5.6.3.  The RALS also depend on power from a SDC or other source such as a remote 
area generator. Area lighting (flightline, supply areas, aerial port facilities) can be 
accomplished using a RALS (Figure 7.10 and Figure 7.11). The RALS provides a 
flexible solution to support illumination requirements. It features 13 telescoping poles, 12 
of which are positionable through the use of “left side” and “right side” cable loop 
assemblies emanating from the RALS container. The thirteenth pole is attached to the 
RALS container. Each pole is 15 feet high with one single 150-watt, 16,000-lumen, high-
pressure sodium (HPS) lamp. Poles are positioned 125 feet apart on a flat plate with 
outriggers. “Left side/right side” lighting string length is 750 feet per side (comprised of 
two 375 feet RALS loop cord sections), for a total string length of 1,500 feet.

7.5.6.4.  Water purification plants are shown on the base layout plan. Once these plants 
have been sited, an electrical installation team will determine exact locations of SDCs 
and MEP generators that support the water plants. 
7.5.6.5.  Sewage lift stations and treatment plants are indicated on the base water and 
sanitary layout plans. Electrical power must be provided from the nearest SDC. 
7.6.  Grounding.  In any electric power generation and distribution system, appropriate electrical 
grounding of equipment such as generator sets, transformers, junction boxes and bus bars is 
generally very important to ensure safe and reliable operation of the system. Traditional guidance 
requires 25 ohms resistance to ground, or less, at all normally grounded locations. However, the 
nature of the soils in many locations will not permit this level of assured grounding with 
traditional ground rods or expedient techniques. In dry, rocky, or sandy regions, 25 ohms or less 
grounding to earth can only be obtained using more involved and equipment-intensive methods 
that may not be available to bare base engineers. 
7.7.  Future BEAR Electrical Power Generation and Distribution System.  The AF is 
exploring several options as a “future” system of electrical power distribution as a replacement 
for 750kW generators. The new system will support contingency operations ranging in size from 
relatively small deployments to large operations of total electrical support. The US Army is 
currently using a prime power unit, the MEP-PU-810A, which was tested but not fielded by the 
AF. Testing and fielding of a final, deployable system may take several more years. In the 
meantime, the IPU addressed in paragraph 7.5.5. is being fielded to fill any BEAR high power 
UTC shortfalls.

Chapter 8 
WATER UTILITY SYSTEMS  
8.1.  Introduction.  In bare base operations it is absolutely essential to determine if a source of 
water, that can be made potable, is available before consideration is given to almost any other 
requirement. 
8.2.  Overview.  This chapter addresses the sources, uses, treatment and distribution of water in 
arid and non-arid environments. Since water is generally scarce in an arid environment, it must 
be used wisely. Consequently, a portion of this chapter will be devoted to describing proper 
water supply and use in the context of a worst case situation—a bare base in an arid 
environment. The final portion of this chapter is on water system equipment and procedures. 
8.3.  Water Sources. 
8.3.1.  Non-Arid Environments. In non-arid (temperate, arctic and tropical) environments, 
water is generally readily available in streams, rivers and lakes. The water usually requires 
only clarification and disinfection to make it potable. Groundwater is also abundant and often 
can be used immediately after it is disinfected. However, groundwater near industrial areas 
should be tested for the presence of hazardous wastes and all water must be examined for the 
presence of human waste. 
8.3.2.  Arid Environments. Probably the most distinguishing characteristic of arid areas is the 
lack of water. Surface water is limited to a few rivers and intermittent streams that benefit 
from sparse rainfall. Except for limited areas, primarily along the coast, groundwater is also 
scarce and is generally unfit to drink because of the dissolved solids content. Because of the 
widespread unsanitary practices, all water in underdeveloped countries, no matter what the 
source, should be considered to be contaminated with disease-causing organisms until proven 
otherwise. As a result, a contingency force must be prepared to produce its own potable 
water and must constantly strive to conserve this mission-essential resource, regardless of the 
water’s quality and ultimate use. 
8.3.3.  Seawater. Seawater obtained offshore at a location removed from a sewage outfall is 
normally relatively clean. It is salty and contains suspended particles of sand and bacteria. 
Seawater may be used without adverse effects for electrical grounding, housekeeping tasks, 
firefighting (although not in fire vehicles), some construction tasks, showering and 
laundering. It should not be used where continued use could corrode critical metal surfaces. 
When used for showers, laundries and personal hygiene purposes, it must be disinfected. 
8.3.4.  Brackish Water. Surface water and groundwater containing 500 to 15,000 parts per 
million (ppm) of dissolved solids are called brackish. The solid content is much less than 
seawater (35,000 ppm) but is high enough to give the water a distinctively salty taste (Figure 
8.1). Brackish water may contain dissolved salts. This makes the water difficult to lather 
(forms curds) and, when heated, leaves hard mineral deposits on the wetted surface of the 
container. As with seawater, brackish water may be used for construction, electrical 
grounding, firefighting and general housekeeping tasks. It is not generally recommended for 
those purposes where it is to be heated to near-boiling temperatures. Additionally, some 
aquifers may be contaminated by oil. Other less common contaminants, such as ammonia, 
arsenic and radioactive isotopes, may be encountered. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  117  
Figure 8.1.  Dissolved Solids 
 
8.3.5.  Freshwater. Freshwater (less than 500 ppm of dissolved salts) has no apparent salty 
taste, but when found on the surface (river, stream, oasis), may contain suspended materials, 
dissolved minerals, fecal matter, bacteria and other disease-causing organisms. When 
obtained from local wells or the municipal water supply systems, freshwater may appear 
clean with no significant odor. Despite its appearance, such water sources may contain 
dissolved minerals, salts and bacteria. Disinfection through chlorination is often the only 
treatment required to make the local water drinkable. On the other hand, drinking freshwater 
containing significant amounts of dissolved salts may produce a laxative effect. 
8.3.5.1.  Freshwater can be used for most cleaning and nonconsumptive purposes without 
purification. Conventional water purification procedures are normally adequate to make 
most freshwater sources potable; however, when the dissolved solids content is too high, 
water should be purified by reverse osmosis treatment. To reemphasize a point made 
earlier; do not make the mistake of assuming that a particular water supply is safe. Some 
countries do not treat water to the standards required by the AF. To safeguard the health 
of the deployed forces, indigenous water sources must be tested before being declared 
suitable for human consumption. 
8.3.5.2.  Surface freshwater sources can also be a major health hazard. These waters, 
primarily rivers, often serve the indigenous population for the disposal of all forms of 
wastes (including human waste) and for that reason is a source of pathogenic organisms. 
Surface freshwater also harbors a variety of other organisms that may infect humans 
through bodily contact with the water (Figure 8.2). 
  118  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
Figure 8.2.  Surface Freshwater Sources May Contain Infectious Organisms 
 
8.3.5.3.  Drinking water from a source such as depicted above is obviously dangerous. 
Even more health threatening are the blood flukes (small worms spawned by several 
types of snails) that cause a disabling disease known as Schistosomiasis. Prevalent in 
Africa and SWA, these immature worms (Schistosomes, Figure 8.3) are released from 
snails’ bodies into the water. The worm penetrates the skin of people who are in the water 
to bath, swim, or do their laundry. Once in the body, these worms block circulation and 
cause scarring in the liver, bladder and intestines, giving rise to severe swelling. 
Schistosomiasis can occur in less than 30 days. Treatment for this disease is very painful 
and, to make matters worse, there is no vaccine for Schistosomiasis. 
Figure 8.3.  Schistosomes Worms 
 
8.4.  Water Use.  Water consumption is based on the size of the deployed force and its 
consumption requirements. Joint Publication 4-01, Joint Bulk Petroleum and Water Doctrine, 
describes essential water requirements as: drinking, personal hygiene, field feeding, medical 
treatment, heat casualty treatment, personal contamination control, patient decontamination in 
CBRN environments, and in arid regions, vehicle and aircraft maintenance. When requirements 
exceed production, all but essential consumption should be reduced. After performing a 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  119  
preventive medicine risk assessment, commanders may decide to use nonpotable water for 
activities that generally use potable water (e.g. showering, laundry, etc). Various AF engineer 
panels have recommended that when mobile water treatment and distribution assets are used, the 
water-use planning factor should be 30 gallons per person per day (gpppd) at a bare base. If a 
permanent water treatment plant and adequate storage capability are available at the beddown 
location, a 60-gpppd factor may be used. A breakdown of the 30-/60-gpppd planning factor, by 
function, is shown in Table 8.1. A description of each of the functions follows the table as well 
as a discussion of ice requirements. Depending on location, climate and other factors, 
commanders may determine that these quantities need to be reduced to conserve water. Note: 
keep in mind that water consumption may be affected by considerations other than military 
populations. For instance, consumption by host nation labor forces, enemy prisoners of war or 
displaced persons (e.g. refugees). Planners should be aware of requirements and obligations that 
may arise from various international protocols, agreements and conventions at specific locations.

8.4.1.  Potable Water. 
8.4.1.1.  Drinking. Approximately four gallons of cooled drinking water will be provided 
each individual per day. Those engaged in strenuous physical activities will normally 
require this amount of water to maintain their strength during the hottest period of the 
  120  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
day. Those who are less active will drink less. Under all circumstances, everyone needs 
to develop a habit of drinking frequently during the day, whether thirsty or not. Every 
contingency since Operation DESERT STORM has made providing packaged or bottled 
water almost a standard operating procedure. While this is one quality of life factor that 
should not be deleted, there are drawbacks to using bottled water, including extensive 
shipping and handling. Many people are not in the habit of drinking a lot of water. It’s a 
hard habit to learn, but one that can be directly related to mission capability. Practice the 
following tips: 
8.4.1.1.1.  Drink extra water before starting any mission or hard work. 
8.4.1.1.2.  Drink small quantities frequently. 
8.4.1.1.3.  Drink water even if not thirsty. 
8.4.1.1.4.  Refill water jugs and canteens at every opportunity. 
8.4.1.2.  Personal Hygiene. Approximately 3 gallons of water are to be provided for 
personal hygiene each day. Personal hygiene should consist of brushing teeth, shaving, 
and washing face and hands. It is allocated in a contingency environment in the following 
manner: brushing teeth with a brief rinse 1/3 gallon; shaving (once a day) and washing 
2/3 gallon; based on three times per day, the total requirement would be 3 gallons per day 
(gpd). In austere environments washing three times a day and shaving each day may not 
be possible; however, the minimum planning factor of 2.7 gpd should be used. Electric 
shavers are very popular and may help to reduce a small portion of the personal hygiene 
water requirement. 
8.4.1.3.  Shower. In order to maintain the health and mental well being of personnel at 
bare base locations, a daily shower is recommended. However, prior to all BEAR assets 
being operational or when source water is limited, a time limit may need to be established 
for the length of showers. There may be occasions when bacterially safe nonpotable 
water, such as from a river or stream, can be used by contingency forces. In these 
instances, approval to use this water without treatment should be obtained from the unit 
medical officer. The BEAR showerhead flow rate is 1.5 gallons per minute, and a daily 
2–minute shower would require 3.0 gpppd. 
8.4.1.4.  Food Preparation. The amount of water used for food preparation varies with the 
type of meal being served. In arid regions, two “B” type meals and one “C” type meal 
will be served daily. Preparation of these meals will require 0.7 gpppd. Another 0.3 
gpppd are required due to additions of tilt grilles, coffee pots and steam tables in the 
BEAR 550 Kitchen. And 3 gpppd are required for kitchen cleanup. The total water 
requirement for food preparation is 4 gpppd. 
8.4.1.5.  Hospital. The hospital consumption planning factor is 1.0 gpppd. This figure 
comes from a projection of 65 gpd for each patient and 10 gpd per hospital staff member. 
These rather significant quantities of water are based on daily baths for the medical staff 
and the majority of patients; changes of uniforms and bedding each day; and the various 
general sanitation, food preparation and housekeeping tasks accomplished each day in 
support of patients and the hospital staff. See Chapter 12 of this volume for additional 
information on support of bare base medical facilities. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  121  
8.4.1.6.  Heat Treatment. Approximately 1.0 gpppd is planned for use in the treatment of 
heat casualties. Heat casualties are normally treated by submersion in cool water and by 
forced intake of liquids. 
8.4.2.  Nonpotable Water. 
8.4.2.1.  Laundry. About 5.0 gpppd are allocated to launder individual and organizational 
clothing. Although potable water is not required, consider the constraints imposed by the 
use of untreated water. First, hard water not only reduces the cleaning power of laundry 
detergents, but may also deposit insoluble residue on the clothing being laundered. 
Second, brackish and saltwater rapidly corrode metal components of the laundry system. 
However, both problems can be overcome or at least tolerated for a short period of time 
in an austere environment. Saltwater detergents, developed primarily for shipboard use 
by the Navy, are available commercially and usually in the DOD inventory. Corrosion 
tolerance is essentially a trade-off between immediate requirements and increased 
equipment wear and subsequent maintenance work. The BEAR Self-Help Laundry is 
made up of standard commercial washers and dryers. According to the manufacturer, the 
new and more efficient commercial washers use 46 gallons per wash cycle. To allow for 
locally purchased washers that might be less efficient than the BEAR units, 49 gallons 
per wash cycle was used as the planning factor. It is estimated that two washings per 
person per week will sustain sanitary conditions and provide for morale and welfare in a 
bare base environment. Therefore, the recommended planning factor for laundry with a 
fixed water treatment plant is 14 gpppd. 
8.4.2.2.  Construction. Approximately 1 gpppd is planned for construction. Concrete 
mixes for most contingency field applications can use nonpotable quality water. In 
general, satisfactory concrete can be mixed using natural surface water, brackish water 
and seawater, or any water that is free of oil and suspended organic matter, especially 
sugar. Brackish or seawater should not be used however in reinforced concrete, because 
the steel reinforcement will corrode. Depending on the type of cement used, curing time 
may be extended. Also, sewage effluent that has undergone the equivalent of secondary 
treatment is suitable for concrete. There may be some occasions to use wastewater as a 
dust control agent. 
8.4.2.3.  Graves Registration. A planning factor of 0.5 gpppd is used for graves 
registration. This involves the handling of the remains, which demand the application of 
good sanitation practices, especially among the graves registration personnel. Some water 
is used for washing the remains’ hands and feet for identification purposes, but most is 
used for hygiene. Handlers are required to wash and disinfect themselves frequently. 
While this planning factor usage is low, the total quantity set aside for this task should be 
sufficient. 
8.4.2.4.  Vehicle Operations. Use 0.5 gpppd in planning for vehicle operations. Water 
will be used primarily for radiator coolant makeup. Washing vehicles should be kept to a 
minimum to conserve water. However, be prepared to increase this amount at facilities 
with limited hard-top roadways, FOD-prevention measures may require that vehicle 
undercarriages and wheel-wells be washed at entry control points (ECPs) before entering 
flightline areas. 
  122  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
8.4.2.5.  Aircraft Operations. Aircraft operations will require 2.0 gpppd. The water will 
be used primarily for cleaning engine intakes and to prevent engine damage from 
ingested sand. Water will also be used to clean other surfaces that could be damaged by 
abrasion. 
8.4.2.6.  Firefighting. A minimum of 2.0 gpppd should be stored strictly for firefighting 
purposes. 
8.4.3.  Ice Requirements. Hot weather and strenuous physical activity cause the body’s 
temperature to increase and the body sheds this increase by producing sweat. This natural 
cooling system is efficient, and the body continues to function well if its water losses are 
replaced. When not replaced, dehydration occurs and with it comes a corresponding loss in 
body function efficiency. If dehydration is allowed to progress, an individual can quickly 
become incapacitated and then must be treated for heat stroke. 
8.4.3.1.  The normal thirst sensation is not a reliable indicator of the water requirement. It 
will be necessary, therefore, for individuals to drink water frequently during the hot and 
most active part of the day. It may be necessary to cool the water to at least 90 degrees 
Fahrenheit (60 degrees Fahrenheit is more desirable) to make it more palatable. If water 
cannot be sufficiently cooled for consumption, then it is important to alter the taste. For 
example, when added to water most powered drink mixes are generally palatable at 85 
degrees Fahrenheit; however, plain water is not. Water that is converted to ice to cool 
drinking liquids will more likely be consumed and is considered part of each individual’s 
daily allocation. 
8.4.3.2.  The dining hall will dispense 0.5 gallons of water per person each day as 
beverage during meals and another 0.09 gallons (12 ounces) per person of water 
converted into ice to cool that beverage. Dining halls will have their own dedicated ice 
machines. 
8.4.3.3.  About half of the base population will perform duties away from the areas where 
drinking fountains are available; therefore, drinking water or other beverages may be 
transported to job sites in 5- and 10-gallon insulated containers. It takes 2.88 gallons of 
water or beverage per person per day to meet these requirements. It takes another 0.53 
gallons of water converted to ice (4.4 pounds) to cool a 75 degrees Fahrenheit liquid to a 
desired 60 degrees Fahrenheit for three to four hours when the ambient temperature is 
120 degrees Fahrenheit. 
8.4.3.4.  The ice needed by medical treatment facilities located at the bare base represents 
an additive requirement. The quantity of ice to be allocated to each type of medical 
facility is addressed in Chapter 12, Table 12.2. 
8.4.3.5.  Ice requirements for the mortuary holding area (for graves registration when 
mechanical refrigeration is not available) are 1.7 pounds per person per day (0.2 gallons 
of water) in arid climates. 
8.5.  Water Purification.  The primary water purification equipment item used in bare base 
operations is the ROWPU. It can produce potable water from almost any water source. 
8.5.1.  With the formation of the Rapid Deployment Force in the late-1970s, an increased 
need arose for water purification equipment that could produce potable water from seawater. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  123  
To meet this need, the AF fielded a 600-gallon-per-hour (gph) ROWPU, able to produce 
potable water from either seawater or freshwater (Figure 8.4). While this particular ROWPU 
was rated to produce 600 gph of potable water from seawater, it has produced up to 900 gph 
from freshwater without over-taxing the unit or causing excess wear to the membranes. 
Today, larger capacity ROWPUs that can produce 1500 gph or more of treated water are 
replacing the 600-gph ROWPU in the BEAR inventory (Figure 8.5). 
8.5.2.  ROWPUs normally do not come with their own power source, however electrical 
power is required to pressurize the water for the reverse osmosis process. The lower the 
dissolved solids content of the water, the lower the power requirement. For instance, 
purifying fresh water will consume less energy than purifying seawater. 
8.5.3.  The temperature of the feed water also affects the water purification capability. Very 
cold or very warm feed water will decrease the output and shorten the life of the purification 
membranes. When the temperature of the feed water exceeds 96 degrees Fahrenheit, plan on 
producing less water than usual. The dissolved solids concentration in raw water also 
influences the production capability. For additional details of the various ROWPUs and the 
BEAR water distribution system, see AFH 10-222, Volume 9, Reverse Osmosis Water 
Purification Unit Set-Up and Operation. 
Figure 8.4.  600-GPH Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU) 
 
  124  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
Figure 8.5.  1500-GPH ROWPU 
 
8.6.  Water Purification Plants.  When several water purification units must be used to meet the 
water requirements of a given base population, the individual units can be consolidated into 
water purification plants. In low threat areas where enemy attack is unlikely, one central water 
plant is most efficient. Less manpower and logistics support are required to operate one plant 
than two separate units that produce an equal amount of treated water. Where an enemy attack is 
likely, multiple water plants should be established to enhance survivability. The vital need of 
water at a bare base justifies sacrificing the economy of operation in a high-threat area. No more 
than two water purification plants are recommended; one should be located near the billeting 
area, the other near the flightline. 
8.7.  Water Storage.  A bare base should have the capacity to store a 5-day supply of water. The 
storage capacity should consist of 60 percent potable water and 40 percent untreated water based 
on the 30-gpppd requirement. With three 20,000-gallon water bladders and four 3,000 gallon 
bladders, there are 72,000 gallons of potable water storage capacity in a typical 550-person 
package. This does not include the potential storage capacity for the source run (20,000-gallon), 
water production (52,000-gallon) and extension packages (6,000-gallon) which may also be 
attached. Using BEAR assets, a bare base of 3,300 personnel will have over 600,000 gallons of 
storage capability. This potential capacity exceeds the 5-day storage planning factor. At bases 
using two purification plants, the storage capacity should be fairly evenly split between the two 
plants. 
8.8.  Freeze Protection.  For extreme cold-temperature operation, water purification units may 
be placed in a small shelter and 3,000-gallon tanks in separate tents. Where practical, two 3,000-
gallon tanks can be enclosed within one tent. When necessary, the M-80 or WH-400 water heater 
can be used to circulate water through the tanks to prevent freezing (this may not be necessary 
when using the BEAR water distribution loop, since it has a circulating pump that will 
continuously move water into bladders). To minimize damage, hoses not being used to distribute 
water should be disconnected, drained and rolled up. 
8.9.  Wastewater Removal.  Wastewater (or gray water) disposal is generally handled by 
electric-driven pumps (Figure 8.6), which are provided in each shower, kitchen and laundry 
location. Wastewater lines of a lightweight, flat hose are used to carry the water away from the 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  125  
inhabited area to natural drainage or to a waste disposal system. Even future latrine systems may 
require manually turning on pumps and using a wash-down spray wand to push heavy solids into 
the pump for disposal. 
Figure 8.6.  Electric-Driven Pump 
 
8.10.  Water Cooling.  Water stored in some locations in SWA has been recorded at over 120 
degrees Fahrenheit. While the effects of such temperature on human consumption have not been 
fully documented, it is obvious this water temperature must be brought within the range of 60 to 
70 degrees Fahrenheit in order to encourage personal consumption and to avoid dehydration. 
Also, some cooling may be required prior to use for showers. 
8.10.1.  Several methods of providing cooled drinking water are available. Where water is 
already on hand, water coolers can be used. A centralized distribution point for chilled water 
and ice should be located at one of the water purification plants to provide for people who do 
not otherwise have access to water. Insulated containers and mobile water chillers are used to 
provide cooled drinking water to persons in remote areas of the base. The number of water 
coolers required for a specific base population is relative to the chilled water output of a 
given unit. Consider, for example, a water cooler, that provides 15 gph of cooled water at a 
temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit when the ambient air temperature is 120 degrees 
Fahrenheit and the supply water temperature is 110 degrees Fahrenheit. This cooler would 
theoretically cool 360 gallons of water per day. But to do this, the unit would have to operate 
continuously and would not account for a backlog of people who require a drink 
simultaneously during periods of peak shelter occupancy or following mass physical exercise 
or work. Therefore, the unit should be derated at least 30 percent or to an output of 252 
gallons per day. Since each person should consume up to four gallons per day, one water 
cooler will service approximately 63 people. Water coolers should have a downward water 
flow, allowing water to be drawn to fill canteens and drinking containers without excessive 
waste. Since water fountains are not provided as part of the BEAR package, consider local 
purchase of suitable units. 
  126  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
8.10.2.  It may be necessary to provide other methods to cool drinking water that will be 
consumed in remote work areas. For on-base personnel, potable chilled water points with 
provisions for making ice can be established at a selected water purification plant. For remote 
areas or off-base personnel, chilled water and ice can also be taken in insulated water 
containers to work sites. 
8.10.3.  The mobile water chiller (Figure 8.7) is also used to provide cooled drinking water 
at remote sites. The mobile water chiller mounts on the M-149 series water trailer. It is 
capable of cooling 120 degrees Fahrenheit water to 60 degrees Fahrenheit at a rate of 800 
gallons per day. Assuming that half of the work force will require half of their daily drinking 
water cooled in this fashion, a requirement will exist to cool 1-gallon per person per day 
using mobile water chillers mounted on M-149 water trailers. Two M-149 water trailers and 
two chillers are adequate for each 1,100-person increment. For deployments greater than 
2,200 people, two spare trailers and two chiller units should be included. 
Figure 8.7.  400-Gallon “Water Buffalo” Trailer With Chiller Attached 
 
8.11.  Ice Plants.  To supplement chilled water requirements, approximately 4.4 pounds of ice 
per person per day should be provided. Ideally, an ice plant should be set up at one of the water 
purification plants to support the base populace. Currently, however, ice-making machines 
capable of meeting overall ice requirements are not part of the BEAR inventory. Limited ice 
making capability is available at dining facilities but this is primarily for food service support. 
There are ice machines included with the BEAR 550 kitchen. Table 8.2 shows ice requirements 
for initial bare base populations and Figure 8.8 shows some typical large capacity ice machines.

8.12.  Water Conservation.  As a culture, Americans generally do not use water sparingly. 
Consequently, part of the training before deploying to arid regions must include instruction on 
water conservation. Such training should be accompanied by measures that make water less 
available. This will reduce the temptation to return to wasteful habits. While everyone in the 
chain of command must assist in the conservation effort, command emphasis is the backbone of 
water conservation. Additionally, planners must be aware of the need to save water and must 
learn to take advantage of opportunities to reuse wastewater for other purposes. 
8.12.1.  Planners play a major role in conserving water through proper siting of activities and 
facilities. For example, activities that require large amounts of potable water should be 
located near water terminals and tank farms to minimize transportation requirements and 
losses during handling. In addition, activities/facilities that can use nonpotable water should 
be sited, when possible, near those that generate wastewater. For example, wastewater from 
laundry and shower units could be used for mixing concrete, compacting soil and controlling 
dust. 
8.12.2.  Planners should also consider using seawater or brackish water. Both sources can be 
used for concrete, soil cement, soil compaction and dust control. The two latter tasks are 
likely to constitute major civil engineer efforts. The existing road network at most bare bases 
is limited and will require expansion, and the rapid deterioration of existing and newly 
established roads from heavy traffic will demand continuous maintenance. Also, nonpotable 
  128  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
water can be used in the decontamination of certain CBRN-contaminated equipment, should 
the need arise. 
8.12.3.  Much can be learned from some of the water-conserving habits of the region’s 
inhabitants. Everyone operating in a water-scarce, arid environment should observe the basic 
water conservation principles listed below. Desert dwellers, particularly the nomadic tribes, 
have relied on similar water discipline for centuries. 
8.12.3.1.  Make it a responsibility shared by everyone to conserve water by avoiding 
wasteful practices. Also, create a shared awareness that there is a useful purpose for 
wastewater or potable water that is hot and therefore unpalatable. 
8.12.3.2.  Place command emphasis on water conservation and water reuse. 
8.12.3.3.  Protect potable water from all sources of contamination, including sand and 
dust. 
8.12.3.4.  Do not dispose of water of any type without considering alternative uses. 
8.12.3.5.  Prohibit water thievery from storage containers and pipelines and the 
indiscriminate use of expedient showers. 
8.12.4.  The use of water of lesser quality is also a viable method of conservation. In SWA, 
where the dissolved solids content of water can be high, any opportunity to use local water 
and avoid the costly reverse osmosis purification process has both logistic and economic 
advantages. These benefits are most apparent when it comes to water for bare base 
construction tasks. Untreated seawater or brackish water is usually quite satisfactory for 
construction that is only intended for short-term use. 
8.13.  Legacy and Future Water Systems.  Until recently, engineers deployed and trained on 
bare base water distribution systems developed in the 1980s. Many of the components were 
developed specifically for military bare base use, but the basic system layout was an industry 
standard. The design required specific UV-treated piping and connectors that greatly increased 
the cost and added labor hours to the setup time. 
8.13.1.  Lessons learned from Operations DESERT STORM and PROVIDE HOPE, and 
more recently in Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM have 
broadened AF knowledge of creating water systems that are more efficient for real-world 
operations. Changes in camp layouts, efficient contract purchasing methods and more precise 
water usage estimates have all contributed to development of better systems. Changes in 
technology have vastly improved material, while commercial inventory and vendor 
availability have made it more efficient and less costly to procure sustainable equipment. 
Consequently, the AF has developed a new BEAR water system. The new system combines 
proven characteristics from legacy Harvest assets with new technology to create a system 
suitable for current and future operations. 
8.13.2.  The BEAR water system is intended to fulfill potable water and wastewater recovery 
needs at austere locations. The water system is modular in design and consist of a series of 
pumping, piping, and storage equipment; applicable fittings; and other components such as 
fluid control valves. It is capable of drawing source water, purifying, storing, and then 
distributing potable water to user facilities. The water system provides water to support 
kitchens, latrines, showers, laundries, and other bare base facilities and recovers the 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  129  
wastewater for appropriate disposal. One complete water system is comprised of five distinct 
subsystems: Source Run, Water Production (1500 ROWPU or 600 ROWPU), 550 Initial, 550 
Follow-on, and Industrial Operations & Flightline Extension. From a bare base perspective, 
the new water system is easier to set up, maintain, and be trained on and is more efficient 
than older systems. From an overall program perspective, the system is easier to store, takes 
up less airlift space, is easier to procure (less parts) and should prove to be cost-effective in 
the long run. The AF is constantly looking for ways to be lighter, leaner and more effective 
in deploying forces for expeditionary operations. The new BEAR Water System is a 
substantial complement to that effort. See T.O. 40W4-21-1, BEAR Water System, and AFH 
10-222, Volume 11, Contingency Water System Installation and Operation, for water system 
configuration and operation.

Chapter 9 
WASTE UTILITY SYSTEMS 
9.1.  Introduction.  Since potable water is viewed as perhaps the most essential element to bare 
base operations, disposal of wastewater and other wastes may seem to be unimportant. This is 
not true. If waste is not quickly and properly disposed of, unsanitary conditions can rapidly 
develop. Flies, mosquitoes and rodents can overwhelm a bare base, spreading disease with them. 
During some previous major conflicts, the casualty rate from disease and other non-battle causes 
invariably exceeded the combat casualty rate. This was particularly true for theaters of operation 
that combine high temperatures and prevalence of indigenous disease. 
9.1.1.  Field Sanitation. Despite many medical and technological advances, the threat from 
insect-borne diseases and sanitation hazards remains as real today as it was in World War II, 
Korea and Vietnam. Troops deployed to areas with poor sanitary conditions and high rates of 
insect-borne diseases can still contract malaria during a 180-day deployment. During 
physically exhausting deployments, particularly those lacking permanent facilities, there is an 
individual tendency to relax sanitation and personal hygiene standards. This poses a threat to 
the entire base population and could seriously affect mission accomplishment. It is also a 
significant challenge for bare base planners who may have to rely on expedient methods for 
waste disposal during the early stages of deployments. With proper application of field 
sanitation and insect control methods, infection rates can be kept to a very low level. 
9.1.2.  Environmental Considerations. In addition to traditional waste disposal problems, 
engineers must also consider those types of waste that pose potential environmental problems 
if not monitored. Items such as fuels, chemicals and process byproducts must be controlled 
and properly disposed of to avoid health and safety hazards. If safe disposal is not an 
immediate option at a bare base, as a minimum an adequate, secure storage area should be 
established. Be especially observant of local-national activities that might be under AF 
control. Local environmental rules at a bare base may not be as strict as US standards and 
may pose environmental problems for US forces if not watched closely. For additional 
information on environmental considerations during contingency operations, see AFH 10-
222, Volume 4, and the numerous references and checklists in its attachments. 
9.2.  Overview.  To assist in planning, this chapter describes various methods to dispose of 
wastes. Expedient field methods for human waste disposal are addressed first, followed by a 
discussion of methods that use BEAR assets for disposing of liquid wastes during longer-term 
deployments. Finally, this chapter presents methods for disposing of solid wastes. 
9.3.  Expedient Human Waste Disposal Methods.  During the early stages of most 
deployments, engineers may need to use expedient field methods to dispose of human wastes 
such as cat hole, burn-out, deep pit, and saddle trench latrines (Figure 9.1), and urine soakage 
pits. Later on, even when BEAR latrines and disposal systems are in place, there may be 
locations on the base that need expedient facilities due to the distances from main utility 
networks or lack of enough BEAR assets. See AFPAM 10-219 Volume 7, Expedient Methods, 
and AFH 10-222 Volume 1, for a thorough description of commonly-used and effective 
expedient latrines. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  131  
Figure 9.1.  Typical Expedient Straddle-Trench Latrine with Privacy Screens 
 
9.3.1.  When planning for expedient latrine facilities, assume one toilet will serve 20 people. 
In areas where females will not routinely use the latrine, urinals may be substituted for one-
third of the minimum required number of toilets. For instance, in a 550-person camp with all 
males, generally plan on a minimum of 28 toilets. However, if urinals were available, then 
only 19 toilets (and 9 urinals) would suffice. Keep in mind that separate latrines must still be 
provided for females. Since approximately 20 percent of AF personnel are women, plan on 
providing a corresponding percentage of bare base latrine facilities for them. 
9.3.2.  Like many other BEAR assets, field deployable latrines begin arriving over the course 
of the first several days of the deployment, and become more and more plentiful as the base 
is established. As deployable latrine units arrive and are set up, expedient latrines will be 
closed. Until deployable latrines are connected to the wastewater distribution system, 
wastewater from the holding tanks is collected using a wastewater disposal trailer (Figure 
9.2). The trailer consists of a 1,000-gallon tank and a vacuum pump powered by a 12-hp 
gasoline engine. The vacuum pump removes air from the tank causing suction through the 
pickup hose. Large material can be removed in this way and not damage the pump. To empty 
the unit, the pump is reversed and the tank pressurized, thus forcing out the contents. For 
planning purposes, assume wastewater disposal trailers can make 15 trips a day and thus can 
dispose of 15,000 gallons of waste per day. Latrines should be emptied daily. 
9.3.3.  Wastewater from the disposal trailer should be emptied in uninhibited areas downwind 
from the base where contamination of drinking water sources is not possible. Dumping 
locations must be carefully considered since waste disposal in this manner may continue 
several days until a more permanent collection system is in place (i.e., septic system, lagoon, 
treatment facility, contracted disposal). 
  132  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
Figure 9.2.  Wastewater Disposal Trailer 
 
9.4.  Expedient Wastewater Disposal Methods.  Water usage generally results in wastewater 
that requires disposal. Depending on the source, wastewater may contain suspended solids and 
particulate matter, organic material, dissolved salts, biological and pathogenic organisms, and 
toxic chemicals. The volume of wastewater alone can cause significant problems in the field. The 
information in Table 9.1. is presented as a guide for estimating the quantities of wastewater 
generated under initial bare base conditions (prior to the entire collection system being installed). 
These quantities are less than those addressed later in this chapter because the water system will 
not be established and less water will be available. Also during this initial phase, less water will 
be used for showers and personal hygiene. Planning for expedient wastewater disposal in the 
early stages of a deployment is essential to protect the health of the force. The following 
paragraphs address several field-expedient wastewater disposal options.

9.4.1.  Soakage Pits.  Soakage pits acts as a reservoir from which water is gradually 
absorbed by the surrounding soil (Figure 9.3). Its effectiveness depends on the cleanliness of 
the water being absorbed, level of the ground water table, permeability of the soil and 
dimensions of the soakage surface. In areas with good/rapid soil drainage, such as limestone 
or coral, average size soakage pits (4 feet square by 4 feet deep) should work well. In slow 
draining silt or desert sands pits must be much larger. Care must be taken in slow-drainage 
areas to clear the wastewater thoroughly before running it into a soakage pit. Soakage pits are 
generally not recommended in areas where soil percolation rates are poor—SWA, for 
example. Nevertheless, field studies may identify favorable conditions for pits even when 
percolation rates are known to be poor. 
  134  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
Figure 9.3.  Soakage Pit 
 
9.4.2.  Soakage Trenches.  In areas where ground-water level precludes digging a 4-foot 
deep pit, engineers can construct soakage trenches (Figure 9.4). First construct a 2 feet 
square by 1 foot deep pit and fill with coarse well-draining material, such as stones or gravel. 
Dig one foot wide trenches that radiate outward from the pit in several directions. Vary the 
depth of the trenches from 1 at the pit to 1.5 feet at the outer edges. Fill the trenches with the 
well-draining materials. 
Figure 9.4.  Soakage Trench 
 
9.4.3.  Evaporation Beds.  Laundries, showers and kitchens generate many gallons of 
wastewater. When soil is compacted and makes it difficult to use soakage pits, use 
evaporation beds. To determine the size of evaporation beds, allow three square feet per 
person for kitchen wastewater and two square feet for shower and laundry waste. The beds 
should be placed so that wastewater can be channeled to any particular bed as desired. As an 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  135  
example, a BEAR kitchen configured to serve 1,100 personnel would require 3,300 square 
feet of evaporation bed. If divided into seven individual beds of 472 square feet, each bed 
would measure 22 feet by 22 feet. The kitchen will produce about 2 gpppd of wastewater for 
a total of 2,200 gallons or 294 cubic feet. Each bed should be about 0.62 feet deep, but to 
allow for free board each bed should be one foot deep. 
9.4.4.  Expedient Grease Traps.  Grease traps should be constructed to prevent grease from 
entering the wastewater disposal beds. Grease will slow the evaporation process, clog and 
prevent water from leaching into the soil and provide food for insects. Several types of grease 
traps sufficiently remove grease from liquid wastes in the field. Some are superior to others 
in that they are easier to construct and last longer. The important thing about a grease trap is 
it should be of sufficient capacity so the hot, greasy water being added will not heat the cool 
water already in the trap. Otherwise the grease will remain uncongealed and pass through the 
trap. Figure 9.5 depicts two types of expedient grease traps that are easy to construct. 
Figure 9.5.  Expedient Grease Traps 
 
9.4.5.  Wastewater Collection Pit Boxes.  Other facilities that produce wastewater must 
have pits constructed to collect the wastewater. These type facilities are less common and are 
included here for legacy purposes. Facilities that produce relatively small quantities of 
wastewater should have a pit that holds 1,000 gallons. Facilities that produce larger amounts 
of wastewater should have a 2,000-gallon pit. Details for construction of these pits are shown 
in Figure 9.6, Table 9.2 and Table 9.3 The wastewater disposal trailer is also used to empty 
these collection pits.

9.5.  BEAR Wastewater Disposal Methods.  The BEAR wastewater disposal system operates 
similar to many municipal wastewater systems. Wastewater is collected and transported via 
pipes, hoses, lift stations and pumps to a centralized collection area. The wastewater system uses 
a 25,000-gallon wastewater collection tank (Figure 9.7). The system can also collect wastewater 
from BEAR facilities for disposal at an on-site treatment plant or by contract collection and 
transport to an off-site treatment facility. During initial bare base operations, collecting all 
wastewater from base facilities may not be feasible. It is recommended that gray-water drying 
beds or evaporation ponds be constructed for showers and laundry facilities and only latrines and 
kitchens be initially connected to the wastewater system. This will eliminate individual facility 
black water collection by pushing the wastewater through a series of force-main pumping 
stations to the central collection tank located outside the main bare base. Wastewater sent to the 
collection tank is mixed and aerated to maintain it in a liquid state for eventual disposal. Setting 
up the wastewater system takes time, so while the system is being constructed, wastewater is 
picked up at the point of generation by wastewater removal trailers. These trailers are discharged 
away from the base or into sewage or stabilization lagoons once they are completed. The BEAR 
wastewater system is packaged in increments designed to support various populations. Although 
the type and amount of equipment is specified, planners may need to design a system unique to 
the deployment location. To help in designing the system, the following paragraphs address the 
sources and quantities of wastewater, followed by a description of the collection system and 
wastewater treatment options. 
9.5.1.  Wastewater Sources. Of the 30 gpppd of potable water provided at a bare base for 
initial beddown, about 21 gpppd (70 percent) will become wastewater. Table 9.4 can be used 
to calculate the quantity of wastewater generated in a given area. For example, a typical 
shower-latrine complex supports 275 people. Latrines and showers generate approximately 
12.7 gpppd, so the latrine complex will generate about 3,500 gallons of wastewater per day 
  138  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
or an average flow of 145 gallons per hour. Because of various work schedules and shifts, the 
maximum hourly flow is unlikely to exceed four times the average hourly flow. Therefore, 
the maximum hourly flow would be about 580 gallons per hour. This figure can be used for 
initial design purposes. Keep in mind locations with fixed water treatment plants and those 
with more quality of life improvements will see water usage increase and more wastewater 
being generated. Planners should be aware the initial design specifications for wastewater 
treatment and disposal facilities will more than likely have to be expanded. Potable water 
production and usage should be monitored to determine actual wastewater generation.

9.5.2.  Wastewater Collection. Base camps are usually placed on fairly level ground making 
gravity-fed wastewater lines unfeasible. The BEAR water system uses forced wastewater 
lines; which makes them usable on level or uneven terrain. Waste output from user facilities 
(latrines, showers, kitchens, laundries, etc.) is processed by various pumps, lift stations, and 
wastewater lines that distribute the wastewater to lagoons or the wastewater collection tank 
for eventual disposal. Latrine and kitchen facilities also have an in-line, sewage ejector 
system (grinder pump) to help facilitate wastewater distribution (Figure 9.8). The ejector is 
attached to the latrine waste tank outlet and kitchen holding tank outlet. The latrines’ waste is 
sent through the ejector and pushed to a macerator pump lift-station (Figure 9.9). From the 
lift-station the waste is pushed through a wastewater hose to a dual-pump lift-station (Figure 
9.10). Note: Manual cleaning of the latrine tanks with the water wand will still be required.

The kitchen waste is sent through the ejector and sent to the dual-pump lift station. The dual 
pump lift-station collects all of the wastewater in the camp and pushes it into a central 
collection tank.

9.5.2.1.  The layout and configuration of the wastewater system is largely dependent 
upon specific site conditions and requirements, including camp size, facility layout, and 
predominant wind direction. In the layout shown in Figure 9.11, all wastewater is 
distributed to a 25,000-gallon wastewater collection tank. In this configuration, it is 
estimated the wastewater tank will be required to be pumped out one or more times per 
day. The waste can be sent to a sewage or stabilization lagoon, leach field, treatment 
plant, etc.

Figure 9.11.  Total Wastewater Collection Layout (1100-Person Camp) 
 
9.5.2.2.  In another configuration (Figure 9.12), only wastewater from latrines and 
kitchens is routed to the wastewater tank. The remaining wastewater from showers and 
laundries is sent to gray-water drying beds or lagoons. In this configuration, it is 
estimated that the wastewater tank will be required to be pumped out once every five 
days.

9.5.2.3.  Installation of these components, while not technically difficult, will be time 
consuming. Additionally, the same people responsible for installation of the wastewater 
system are also responsible for installing the more important water distribution system. 
Furthermore, some personnel will be used to support ROWPU operation and wastewater 
disposal functions. The bottom line is be prepared to operate the field deployable latrine 
and disposal trailers for an extended time since there will be several concurrent 
competing beddown demands vying for engineer assistance. Local contract support in 
this area may be a good alternative.

9.5.3.  Wastewater Treatment and Disposal. 
9.5.3.1.  Stabilization Lagoons.  In areas where sufficient natural drainage exists to carry 
wastewater away from the base, stabilization lagoons (Figure 9.13) can be constructed. A 
stabilization lagoon is a shallow artificial pond used to treat wastewater before it is 
discharged. Bacteria and protozoans metabolize waste organics in a stabilization lagoon. 
When the lagoon bottom is anaerobic (without oxygen), biological activity results in 
digestion of the settled solids. Algae in photosynthesis use nutrients released by the 
bacteria. The degree of stabilization produced in oxidation lagoons is significantly 
influenced by climatic conditions. During warm, sunny weather, decomposition and 
photosynthetic processes flourish, resulting in rapid stabilization of waste organics. 
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) reductions in warm weather usually exceed 95 
percent. Stabilization lagoons are designed with long liquid retention times, usually 20 to 
120 days. Lagoons discussed in this chapter have been designed with a retention time of 
approximately 20 days, suitable for a predominantly hot and sunny region (SWA or 
equivalent). Although much of the treatment occurs naturally through chemical 
processes, aeration devices may be used to add oxygen to the wastewater. Aeration 
makes treatment more efficient so that less land area is necessary. 
Figure 9.13.  Stabilization Lagoon 
 
9.5.3.1.1.  A wastewater stabilization lagoon should have a flat bottom pond and be 
enclosed by an earth dike. Operating liquid depth has a range of 2 to 5 feet with 3 feet 
of dike freeboard. Freeboard is the distance between the highest level of the 
wastewater and the top of the dike or berm. A minimum depth of 2 feet is required to 
prevent growth of rooted aquatic plants. Operating depths greater than 5 feet can 
create odorous conditions because of anaerobic bottom conditions. Influent lines 
discharge near the center of the pond and the effluent overflows in a corner on the 
windward side to minimize short-circuiting. When multiple lagoons are used, they 
should be able to operate individually or in a series. It may also be necessary to line 
or seal the bottom of the lagoon to prevent leaks and maintain its biological 
properties. A commonly used sealing agent is bentonite clay, although flexible 
synthetic membranes may also be used. 
  144  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
9.5.3.1.2.  In multiple lagoon installations, the sequence of lagoon operation is 
regulated to provide control of the treatment process. Operating lagoons in series 
generally increases BOD removal by preventing short-circuiting. Parallel operation 
may be desirable to distribute the organic load and avoid potential odor problems. 
Since stabilization lagoons may emit odor, they should be located as far as practical 
from the base and on the leeward side so that prevailing winds are away from the 
base. Lagoons treating only domestic wastewater normally operate odor-free. Figure 
9.14 lists the requirements for stabilization lagoons for various base sizes. 
Construction details are shown in Figure 9.15. Excavation for the lagoons is based on 
balanced cut and fill.

9.5.3.2.  Evaporation Lagoons.  In areas where it is impossible to discharge wastewater 
off base, evaporation lagoons will have to be constructed. Evaporation reduces the liquid 
volume of wastewater, returning water vapor to the environment. Solids settle to the 
bottom and form sludge. Because of the large construction requirements, evaporation 
lagoons should only be used as a last resort. Evaporation lagoons for the different size 
bases are presented in Table 9.5.

9.5.3.2.1.  Evaporation is dependent upon the net evaporation rate and surface area 
available for evaporation. The evaporation lagoons sized in this chapter are based 
upon a net evaporation rate of 46 inches per year and a wastewater flow rate of 15 
gallons per person per day. Figure 9.16 can be used to calculate lagoon requirements 
for other net evaporation rates. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  147  
Figure 9.16.  Evaporation Lagoon Area Requirements 
 
9.5.3.2.2.  Evaporation lagoons should be constructed in increments. Table 9.6 shows 
the time required for each of the lagoons to fill (in days). The time varies because as 
the lagoon area increases, the amount of water being evaporated increases, thus 
decreasing the net flow rate. For the 1,100-person base the first lagoon will fill in 46 
days but the eighth lagoon will not fill until 932 days. Only construct lagoons that 
will be used during the anticipated deployment. Following the lagoon construction 
sequence in Figure 9.17 will minimize construction requirements.

Notes: Based on 14 gallons of wastewater per person per day. Net evaporation rate of 46 inches per 
year. Lagoons are 5 feet deep with dike walls that slope at 3:1.

Figure 9.17.  Evaporation Lagoon Construction Sequence 
 
9.5.3.2.3.  Where less than one gallon per hour is discharged from a shelter supplied 
with water for drinking or testing purposes, a dry pit (French) drain would adequately 
serve the area. The drain can be constructed using a 55-gallon drum (with the top and 
bottom removed) that is placed level in the ground and filled with rocks. No human or 
solid wastes should be discharged into the dry pit drain. 
9.5.3.2.4.  The lagoons in this chapter have not been sized to accept brine water 
discharged from ROWPUs. The brine water can be disposed of by returning it to the 
source, if the source is a body of water. If the source of the water is a well, some other 
method of disposal must be found. The ROWPU brine water flow rate depends on the 
source of water being treated, but can be twice the amount of potable water being 
produced (see Chapter 9). 
9.5.3.2.5.  Wastewater from kitchens must be treated to remove grease before 
entering the collection system. Construction details for typical grease traps supporting 
kitchen facilities are presented in Figure 9.18. The single-drum grease trap can be 
used for a 550-person kitchen and the larger version should be used for kitchens that 
serve 1,100 or more. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  149  
Figure 9.18.  Kitchen Facility Grease Traps 
 
9.6.  Solid Waste Disposal.  Solid waste must also be collected and disposed. For planning 
purposes, expect four pounds per person per day of solid waste will be generated. This includes 
garbage (waste from preparation and serving of food), rubbish (paper, cartons, boxes, cans, etc.), 
ashes and industrial wastes. Although it is important to consider all available methods of solid 
waste disposal, disposal plans must adhere to theater-specific waste management guidance and 
procedures. Other sources of information include AFI 32-7001, Environmental Management, 
AFI 32-7042, Waste Management, UFC 3-240-10A, Sanitary Landfill, and AFH 10-222, Volume 
  150  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
4. These publications provide good solid waste management guidelines, however engineer 
planners must be aware of local, theater, and host-nation requirements. 
9.6.1.  Burning Operations. If solid waste disposal plans include burning, severe restrictions 
may apply to certain types of burning. If used, open-air burn pits must be operated in a 
manner that prevents or minimizes risks to humans and the environment. Review DODI 
4715-19, Use of Open-air Burn Pits in Contingency Operations, for additional information. 
Open-air burn pits are a short-term solution to reduce the volume of solid waste during 
contingency operations. Long-term solutions include the use of incinerators (Figure 9.19) 
and landfills. 
Figure 9.19.  Incinerator Operations 
 
9.6.2.  Landfill Operations. Uncompacted solid waste weighs about 200 pounds per cubic 
yard. When compacted into a landfill, it weighs 700 to 1,000 pounds per cubic yard. A 1,100-
person base generates about 4,400 pounds per day of solid waste. Uncompacted, the waste 
would have a volume of 22 cubic yards. A dump truck with a 5-cubic yard capacity would 
need to make five trips to carry a day’s waste to the disposal site. However, daily burial at a 
landfill would compact it to between 4.4 and 6.3 cubic yards per day. 
9.6.2.1.  A typical trench method of landfill operation is shown in Figure 9.20. A crawler 
tractor digs a trench for waste to be dumped into. It also spreads and consolidates the 
waste. At the end of the day, the crawler of construction equipment covers the waste with 
24 inches of earth. As a trench is filled or abandoned, it should be covered with 30 inches 
of earth and its boundaries marked.

  151  
Figure 9.20.  Trench Method Construction of Sanitary Landfill 
 
9.6.2.2.  To minimize the possibility of underground pollution, follow these 
recommendations when siting a landfill: 
9.6.2.2.1.  Do not build on exposed rock strata. Keep a minimum of 30 feet clay-till 
overburden between strata and refuse unless studies indicate a lesser depth is 
satisfactory. Locate fill at least 500 feet from wells unless studies indicate subsurface 
seepage is not imminent. 
9.6.2.2.2.  Do not place garbage and refuse in mines or other areas where resulting 
seepage or leaching could carry waste to water-bearing strata or wells. Remember, 
chemical pollution emanating from a fill will travel longer distances than organic and 
bacterial pollution. 
9.6.2.2.3.  Do not locate sanitary fills on or near springs. 
9.6.2.2.4.  Locate the landfill in an area of stable soil and downwind from the 
installation. Avoid areas of sand dunes or other mobile earth deposits. 
9.6.3.  Commercial solid waste disposal systems are increasingly being targeted at meeting 
the unique challenges of deployed environments. These include containerized dehydration 
units that turn solid waste into ash or fine powder. These systems can potentially reduce the 
amount of water, logistics and labor needed for disposal operations and are easier on the 
environment. 
9.6.4.  Additional information on managing and disposing of solid, hazardous and medical 
waste can be found AFH 10-222, Volume 4.

BEAR FACILITIES 
10.1.  Introduction.  Modular, expandable and fabric-covered shelters and canvas tents provide 
structures needed on a bare base for billeting, shops, hangars and storage. All expandable 
facilities and tents can be set up for immediate use and packaged for redeployment by the same 
people who use them. It is important to keep in mind that BEAR shelters are made of lightweight 
materials that provide virtually no protection against weapons fire and munitions fragments. 
Consequently, in high-threat areas these shelters are dispersed and hardened to the maximum 
extent possible by using sandbags or other expedient revetment walls. In some instances, 
protective shelters may have to be constructed to obtain the required degree of survivability. 
10.2.  Overview.  This chapter provides a brief description of BEAR contemporary and legacy 
shelters. It also covers the special handling procedures required for hardwall shelters. 
Throughout this chapter, keep in mind when siting facilities, areas should be level, firm, well-
drained and relatively free of surface rock or stone. Also keep in mind the environmental 
limitation for these facilities is generally -25 degrees Fahrenheit to +125 degrees Fahrenheit and 
most can withstand steady wind loads of 60 knots with gusts to 90 knots. Refer to AFH 10-222, 
Volume 6, Guide to Bare Base Facility Erection, and applicable technical orders for detailed 
guidance on erection and disassembly of facilities in this chapter. 
10.3.  BEAR Shelters. 
10.3.1.  Small Shelter System (SSS). This all-purpose tent-type shelter (Figure 10.1) is used 
for billeting, work areas, latrines and showers, storage, etc. It is stored and shipped in its own 
container, four containers per 463L pallet. When fully erected, this shelter measures 32.5 feet 
long by 20 feet wide by 10 feet high (650 sq ft). The SSS is equipped to accept 120/208 
VAC, 60-cycle, single-phase power. This shelter is commonly referred to as the “Triple-S” 
and has been designated as the replacement for the TEMPER tent through attrition. 
Compared to the TEMPER tent, it is less costly, slightly lighter, tighter, and more vector 
proof. It also requires less day-to-day maintenance when erected, and its fabric is easier to 
repair. A minimum of six people are required to safely assemble this structure in about 1.5 
hours (nine labor hours) and multiple buildings can be interconnected. See T.O. 35E5-6-11, 
Alaska Small Shelter System (AKSSS), for further instructions. 
10.3.2.  Medium Shelter System (MSS). This shelter is 52 feet long by 29.5 feet wide by 15 
feet high (1,534 sq ft) and is used as an all-purpose, mid-sized shelter (Figure 10.2) in the 
maintenance, warehouse, storage and kitchen areas. The shelter is shipped and stored in its 
own containers. An all-terrain forklift and a hammer drill and bits are required for erection. It 
may be erected over soil, asphalt, or concrete. This shelter has a 120/208 VAC, 60-cycle, 3-
phase, 5-wire input. The MSS is replacing the General Purpose Shelter in the inventory. It 
provides tighter protection against dust and insects, has lower maintenance costs and takes up 
less shipping space. These shelters are also known as the “M Double S.” A minimum of six 
people can safely assemble this structure in about 4 hours (24 labor hours) and multiple 
shelters can be interconnected. Consult T.O. 35E5-6-21, California Medium Shelter System, 
for more details.

10.3.3.  Dome Shelter. The Dome Shelter is a large shelter used as a warehouse, 
maintenance area, or small aircraft hangar (Figure 10.3). It is constructed of synthetic fabric 
over aluminum arch sections, with steel tension cables to provide rigidity. The standard 
configuration for the Dome Shelter is 120 feet long, 70 feet wide (8,400-sq-ft shelter) and 
25.6 feet high at the arch apex. Dome Shelters with a gabled end are 89.3 feet long by 60 feet 
wide by 25.6 feet high for a 5,358-sq-ft building. The area needed to erect the standard 
shelter is 140 feet by 90 feet and with the gable end requires 110 feet by 90 feet. The location 
should be vehicle accessible as the shelter is shipped and stored in three 463L pallet 
containers. When installing on concrete, secure with thunder studs. Shelter can accept 
120/208 VAC, 60-cycle, 3-phase, 5-wire electrical input. A minimum crew of eight is 
required to erect the Dome Shelter in about 32 hours (256 labor hours), and multiple 
buildings can be interconnected. See T.O. 35E4-216-1, Bare Base Dome Shelter, for more 
information on the shelter.

10.3.4.  International Standardization Organization (ISO) Shelter.  ISO shelters were 
developed to provide some degree of standardization in the various shelters used by the 
Armed Forces. The ISO designation means each structure conforms to the material handling 
requirements established by the ISO. Although there are not many of these shelters in the 
BEAR systems, some may be encountered at locations supporting joint services. As shown in 
Figure 10.4, these shelters are either rigid or expandable. No special equipment is needed for 
erecting ISO shelters and site preparation requirements are minimal. 
10.3.4.1.  The ISO 1:1 (rigid type) measures 8 by 20 feet and its gross weight is 13,900 
pounds (3,900 tare weight and 10,000 payload). 
10.3.4.2.  The ISO 2:1 (one side expandable) has interior dimensions of 14 feet 6 inches 
by 19 feet 1 inch; ceiling height is 7 feet 1 inch. The gross weight of this shelter is 15,000 
pounds (tare weight is 5,500 pounds). With four people assigned, erection takes 25 
minutes. 
10.3.4.3.  With both sides expanded, the ISO 3:1 has a nominal interior dimension of 20 
feet by 11 feet 6 inches; ceiling height is 6 feet 9 inches. Gross weight is 6,500 pounds 
(tare weight is 2,000 pounds). Six people can erect this ISO in 45 minutes.

10.3.5.  Expandable Light Air Mobile Shelter (ELAMS). This all-purpose, softwalled 
shelter serves as a command post, medical clinic, maintenance shop, storage, or office area 
(Figure 10.5). Standard expanded configuration is 14.8 feet long by 20.25 feet wide by 8 feet 
high (300 sq ft). The shelter has a 120/208 VAC, 60-cycle, 3-phase, 5-wire input. A 
minimum of five personnel are can safely assemble the structure in about six hours (30 labor 
hours). 
Figure 10.5.  Expandable Light Air Mobile Shelter 
 
10.3.6.  Large Area Maintenance Shelter (LAMS).  The LAMS (Figure 10.6) provides 
semi-portable housing for small aircraft and vehicle maintenance. Sized at approximate 129 
feet long, 75 feet wide, and with a 31-foot height clearance at the center, it has electrically 
operated Clamshell end-doors at both ends. The shelter is equipped with explosion proof 
lights, outlets, wiring, and switches. It can be erected on a reinforced concrete pad (100 feet 
minimum x 135 foot minimum x 8 to 10 inch thick), asphalt, or earth surface. Once erected, 
the LAMS provide an unobstructed, weatherproof work area free of vertical supports that 
could hinder movement of aircraft and equipment within. A minimum of ten people are 
  156  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
required to assemble the structure safely. Assembly time is approximately 300 man-hours. 
Consult T.O. 35E4-219-1, Large Area Maintenance Shelter, for additional information. 
Figure 10.6.  Large Area Maintenance Shelter 
 
10.3.7.  Automatic Building Machines. While not included in BEAR packages, automatic 
building machines can be and are used at most bare bases. Using rolls of galvanized steel or 
aluminum, these machines produce structural building arches of various widths that are 
erected and crimped together at the seams. The manufactured facilities, commonly called K-
spans (Figure 10.7), can be used as aircraft hangars or covered storage buildings. When 
fitted with end walls and ventilating and mechanical systems, these facilities can serve as 
shops, recreational facilities and shelters. Some of these machines are prepositioned overseas 
and others are part of the RED HORSE squadron equipment package. A trained crew of 10 to 
12 people can make a 10,000 SF facility in about a day using a trailer-mounted system.

10.4.  Legacy Shelters. 
10.4.1.  Tent, Extendable, Modular, Personnel (TEMPER). Prior to the SSS, the 
TEMPER was the most frequently used facility in bare base packages. The TEMPER tent is a 
modular, soft shelter (synthetic material) supported by an aluminum frame structure (Figure 
10.8). Its primary use is for troop billeting (12 personnel per tent) but it also supports other 
functions, such as shops and administrative space. This tent comes with roll up windows, 
mosquito netting and a flysheet (waterproof material that attaches above the tent top and 
allows free movement of air between the flysheet and the tent top). The tent comes in 8 foot 
by 20-foot sections that fasten together; the nominal tent size is 32 feet by 20 feet x 11 feet 
(640 sq ft tent). Also included is a white inner liner for insulation and a fabric floor. For 
special adaptations, solid doors and entry vestibules are available. An electrical wiring kit 
provides lights and convenience outlets. The TEMPER tent can be heated and cooled as 
required and a fabric plenum is provided to direct airflow. A minimum of six personnel are 
required to safely assemble this shelter in about 1.5 hours (9 labor hours). However, it is 
common to use a team of 10 personnel (of various skill levels) to erect it in about an hour. 
Multiple buildings can be interconnected. Consult AFH 10-222, Volume 6, and T.O. 35E5-
6-1, Tent, Extendable, Modular, Personnel (TEMPER), for detailed information on this 
shelter. 
Figure 10.8.  TEMPER Tent 
 
10.4.2.  General Purpose (GP) Shelter.  The general-purpose shelter supports such 
functions as shops, storage and multipurpose use (Figure 10.9). The overall size of the 
shelter is approximately 48 feet long by 31 feet wide by 12 feet high. The shelter has 
windows, rigid doors and truck doors that give access to service equipment. Lighting and 
service outlets are provided through a distribution panel and cable arrangement on each side 
of the shelter. A membrane or rigid panel floor are optional features that may be installed in 
the shelter. Removable panels in the shelter allows for the installation of a heating and air 
conditioning unit. Shelter erection tools are provided and located in marked containers. A 
crew of six can erect the shelter on a prepared surface in about 15 hours, or about 20 hours if 
installed with a floor. The GP Shelter is packaged into an 8 feet by 8 feet by 10 feet 
container, which can be used for other purposes until the shelter is reconstituted. The GP 
shelter is being replaced through attrition by a softwalled Medium Shelter System described 
earlier in this chapter.

Figure 10.9.  General Purpose Shelter 
 
10.4.3.  Expandable Shelter Container (ESC). This shelter container is used primarily for 
flightline and industrial shops (Figure 10.10). When expanded, the ESC measures 
approximately 21 feet long by 13 feet wide by 8 feet high (273 SF) and weighs 12,500 
pounds when shipped without an internal payload. When packaged, the unit is 8 feet by 13 
feet by 8 feet. The unit may be expanded without removing whatever payload might be in the 
container. Panel inserts in one of the swing-out walls can be removed to connect one ECU, 
which is sufficient for heating and cooling this shelter. Double doors (cargo doors) are 
installed in one end wall of the center section and a personnel door in the other end wall. 
Double pane windows in the walls are nonopening, shatterproof, heat resistant and equipped 
with blackout curtains. An entire 3-phase electrical system is provided, along with installed 
lighting and electrical service equipment. The ESC can be erected with a crew of six people 
in approximately two hours.

10.4.4.  Aircraft Maintenance Hangar (ACH). This 77-foot-wide shelter is used for most 
on-aircraft maintenance functions or as a warehouse (Figure 10.11). It consists of a series of 
freestanding arches formed from individually shipped aluminum beams and honeycomb core 
and aluminum skin panels. The beams and panels are locked together at ground level to form 
an arch section. Each hangar is shipped in four containers that measure 10 feet by 8 feet by 8 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  159  
feet each. These containers are positioned at each corner of the hangar to make vestibule-like 
personnel entrances/offices. Use existing concrete or asphalt surfaces, AM-2 matting or a 
locally supplied material as the floor. The ACH structure comes with 3-phase electric wiring 
and openings for ducts to interface with the BEAR electric and heating systems. The first 
choice for the hangar site is on, or close to, an airfield apron. If the apron site is impractical, a 
hard surface, approximately 125 by 150 feet, capable of withstanding aircraft weight should 
be selected. When erected, the hangar is 125.6 feet long by 77 feet wide and 25 feet high at 
the center (9,748 sq ft) with the doors closed. Personnel from RED HORSE or the 49 MMG 
will erect this shelter. Erecting the ACH requires a minimum of 10 people and generally 
takes about 40 hours (400 labor hours). Multiple buildings can be interconnected. Consult 
T.O. 35E4-133-1 for further information.

10.4.5.  Frame-Supported Tensioned Fabric Shelter (FSTFS). The FSTFS is a hangar-like 
structure fashioned by stretching a fabric skin over a series of metal arches (Figure 10.12). It 
supports functions requiring large floor spaces, such as supply storage, vehicle maintenance 
and various aircraft maintenance shops. The FSTFS can be set up directly on pavement or 
floors built from AM-2 matting. The most common sizes are 70 feet long x 60 feet wide x 
25.6 feet high (4,200 sq ft) and 140 feet long x 60 feet wide x 26 feet high (8,400 sq ft). RED 
HORSE or the 49 MMG erects these facilities. A minimum of eight personnel are required to 
safely assembly the FSTFS and assembly time is about 32 hours (256 total labor hours) for 
the smaller version and 48 hours (384 total labor hours) for the larger version. Multiple 
buildings can be interconnected. FSTFSs are gradually being replaced by the Dome Shelters, 
which provide more utility and versatility. See T.O. 35E4-183-1 for detailed descriptions.

10.5.  Hygiene Facilities. 
10.5.1.  Shower/Shave Unit. This portable shower/shave unit (Figure 10.13) consists of a 
four-section shower element and four separate washstands. These units come with their own 
tents. Set up requires a minimum of four people approximately 6 hours (plus tent and boiler 
set up). 
Figure 10.13.  Shower/Shave Unit 
 
10.5.1.1.  Portable shower consists of six separate but identical and interchangeable 
modules. Each module has a pallet-like shower base pan with drains and fittings to 
connect the drain plumbing. Each shower module has two shower nozzles mounted on a 
surrounding framework, which serves as a support for the vinyl fabric shower enclosure. 
The entire shower system includes interconnecting hoses among the six modules for 
water inlet and draining, a water heater (usually an M-80) and pump for hot water supply 
and another pump with hose for removal of wastewater. 
10.5.1.2.  Each shave facility consists of a three-bowl washstand and a mirror with 
attached light fixture (Figure 10.14). The washstand features folding legs and contains all 
required plumbing. Four washstands (a total of 12 bowls) will be located with each field 
shower (two on each side).

Figure 10.14.  Shave Facility Washstand 
 
10.5.2.  Field Deployable Latrine. The field deployable latrine is included in BEAR 
equipment. This latrine (Figure 10.15) consists of six toilets and a urinal trough mounted 
above a 135-gallon water tank, a hand-washing sink and a 180-gallon waste tank. Four 
deployable latrine units constitute one BEAR package and support 600 people. These 
packages come with their own tents. Setup (not including the shelter) takes two people about 
one hour. 
Figure 10.15.  Field Deployable Latrine 
 
10.5.2.1.  Water and waste tanks are supported by an aluminum frame and plywood 
partitions. There are privacy screens between the toilet commodes and the urinals. A 
pressurized water system, operating on 115-VAC power, supplies water for flushing the 
toilets. The vent pipes, curtains and frame dismantle and the urinal board folds down to 
provide a shipping package 88 inches wide by 104 inches long by 42 inches high. This 
latrine contains an electrical outlet and comes with a 100-foot power cable. The unit is 
self-packaging, can be forklifted and is stackable. Tie down and lifting eyes are provided. 
  162  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
The double-stacked latrine unit is air transportable on 463L pallets. This unit weights 
1,530 pounds dry without the pump unit. 
10.5.2.2.  During the early stages of a deployment, this latrine can be operated in a stand-
alone mode. That is, the water tank is periodically replenished and the waste tank is 
emptied using the wastewater disposal trailer (recall Figure 9.2). Once the water and 
waste distribution systems are in place, the unit can be connected directly to the service 
lines. For planning purposes, one six-commode field deployable latrine can serve 160 
males (because it would also have urinals) and 120 females. As mentioned in the 
previous chapter, separate latrines must be provided for women. This provision may be 
accomplished by splitting one bank of the latrine assembly and separating them with a 
plywood wall between the two banks. This allows use of the same shelter, pumps, etc. 
10.6.  Food Service Facilities.  The kitchen complex generally consists of several tents and 
associated kitchen equipment sized to feed 1,100 people. The 1,100-person kitchen package 
consists of two 550-person kitchens. In a typical setup for this population size, interconnected 
shelters provide space for storage, utensil washing, food preparation, serving and dining. Force 
Support personnel normally erect all tents associated with the kitchen; however, engineers 
provide supporting utility service (electric, water and wastewater) and install some of the more 
complicated equipment items, such as water heaters, walk-in refrigeration units and air 
conditioning units. Several expedient food service facilities are covered in the next chapter. 
10.7.  Offloading Facilities at the Bare Base.  Dimensions and weight is determined by the 
mode of transportation from the aircraft to the site of erection. Basically, the shelters must be 
forklifted, hoisted, or trucked from one location to another. Engineers will need to have several 
people qualified on large, all-terrain forklifts. Provisions for forklifting tines are incorporated 
into the base assembly of all hardwall shelters. The tines must slide into the opening provided for 
forklift operation. The ship/store containers also have forklift tine holes. Site layout action must 
be well under way by the time facilities begin to arrive on base. This allows equipment operators 
to place facility assets correctly with respect to orientation and utility connections. More 
importantly, this also helps avoid having to move assets more than once during the initial 
beddown. 
10.7.1.  Containers. Many BEAR assets are transported in ship/store containers that are 90 
inches high and sized for a 463L pallet. The containers have double doors on both 108-inch 
sides with adjustable shelves and a center divider. The containers have a tare weight of about 
1,750 pounds and a maximum load capacity of 10,000 pounds. They are used to ship and 
store such assets as tents, shower/shave facilities, BEAR 550 kitchens and Dome Shelters. 
(Note: the overall dimensions of the 463L pallet are 88 by 108 inches, with usable 
dimensions of 84 by 104 inches. This allows two inches around the load to attach straps, nets, 
or other restraint devices. An empty 463L pallet weighs 290 pounds and with nets it weighs 
355 pounds). Planners should expect to see 20-feet wide ISO containers become the primary 
packaging source for BEAR equipment assets. 
10.7.2.  Hoisting. Hoisting rings are also located on each roof corner of hardwall shelter 
containers. When three shelters are joined in a triple-mode concept, 12 rings are available. 
Inboard corners of outbound shelters or outbound corners of center shelters give the best 
cable angles for lifting the shelter and any internal payload. Ship/store containers also have 
external lifting rings. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  163  
10.8.  Allowance Standards (AS).  AS 157 is the allowance standard for BEAR equipment. The 
facilities and equipment lists presented in Chapter 3 are derived from the information contained 
in the allowance standard. Be aware, however, that the allowance standard is not specific with 
respect to numbers and types of facilities for all functional areas. For example, security forces 
will likely want a base defense operations center, sector command posts, an armory, a storage 
facility and protective revetments; these potential requirements are not specifically delineated in 
the AS. Instead, there are several facility assets that are identified as multipurpose or common 
facilities, and these will have to be parceled out base wide to meet the various facility demands. 
The commander at the deployed location is normally the final authority in regard to facility 
allocation, but engineer planners must be prepared to provide advice and recommendations of 
facility scopes and base wide requirements based on population and the number of aircraft. 
10.9.  Survivability Considerations.  As stated at the chapter’s outset, the lightweight 
construction of modular BEAR shelters provides little, if any, protection even against small arms 
fire, much less the blast and fragmentation associated with explosions and aerial munitions. 
While dispersal of facilities in a high-threat environment enhances survivability, additional 
measures are necessary to protect personnel and critical resources. Volume 2 of this pamphlet 
series highlights basic planning for such enhancements and AFH 10-222, Volume 14 provides 
descriptions of various weapons effects and information on natural and manmade revetment 
materials. Construction methods for structural revetments and personnel protection shelters are 
presented in Volume 7 of this pamphlet series.

Chapter 11 
BARE BASE ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT 
11.1.  Introduction.  This chapter provides descriptions of ancillary equipment and mechanical 
systems that may require support by bare base engineers. Although CE may not own or operate 
most of this equipment, much of it is in UTC packages used by other functional communities 
(e.g. Force Support, Medical, etc), and CE will likely be involved in site preparation, installation 
and hardening and the connection of electrical power, water and waste disposal systems. 
11.2.  Overview.  The description of equipment and systems in this chapter and Chapter 12 is 
intended as a guide for planning for the additional resources required to support these ancillary 
equipment items. This chapter is not intended to cover operations or detailed procedures. 
Planners should see applicable TOs, manuals, and other sources for additional information on 
these and other ancillary equipment and systems. 
11.3.  Fuels Mobility Support Equipment (FMSE).  FMSE is designed to receive and issue 
fuel at bare bases and to augment locations with fixed-fuel facilities. It includes items such air-
transportable fuel bladders, hydrant systems, bulk pumps, and filter separators. Details for two of 
these items are addressed below. 
11.3.1.  R-14 Air Transportable Hydrant Refueling System. The R-14 is a portable, hydrant-
refueling system that can be airlifted or ground shipped anywhere in the world and made 
fully operational in a matter of hours. A complete system contains three identical, self-
sufficient modules. Each module consists of a pumping unit; two 50,000-gallon bladder 
tanks; and all the hoses, valves, and fittings necessary for operation (Figure 11.1). The 
pumping module is configured on a four- wheeled trailer and features the same components 
found on conventional servicing equipment. Each R-14 module can fuel one heavy aircraft at 
600 gallons-per-minute (gpm) or two fighter aircraft at 200 gpm. The number of R-14 units 
to be deployed to an installation is predicated on the number of aircraft to be supported. 
These units are sourced separately from BEAR assets and can vary in quantity from base to 
base. Additional 50,000-gallon bladders without the refueling module can also be deployed, 
normally in packages of four. 
11.3.2.  Fuel Bladders. Fuel bladders (sometimes referred to as pillow tanks) generally range 
in capacity from 500 gallons to 210,000 gallons (Figure 11.2). Typically, 10,000-gallon fuel 
bladders are used at low-demand sites such as vehicle refueling points. Larger 50,000-gallon 
fuel bladders support aircraft fuel storage and refueling and are commonly found with the R-
14 refueling unit previously addressed. The 210,000-gallon bladders are used for bulk fuel 
storage. Collapsible fuel bladders, like aboveground steel tanks, require berms and liners to 
contain tank contents in case of rupture and to stop fragments and blast effects from near-
miss explosions. Fuel bladders are actually less vulnerable than permanently installed steel 
tanks since they are close to the ground, have no vapor space, generate no sparks when 
penetrated and have much lower static head. Additional fuel bladder details are listed in 
Table 11.1. Refer to T.O. 37A12-15-1, for additional information relating to operation, 
service, repair, and berm construction details.

11.4.  Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE).  A mobile, air-
transportable, aircraft and ground fuel delivery system that is designed to replace older and less 
efficient Fuels Mobility Support Equipment (FMSE) previously addressed. Currently being 
fielded at numerous locations, FORCE fueling systems, like that shown in Figure 11.3, saves 
time and resources and improves safety, reliability, and flexibility of the deployed fueling 
systems. 
Figure 11.3.  New FORCE Refueling System 
 
11.5.  Laundry Facility.  Force Support personnel provide laundry service support at a bare 
base. Force Support is responsible for planning the quantities of washers, dryers and supplies for 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  167  
laundry operations or providing for contract support where available. For additional information 
on Force Support’s role in laundry support, refer to AFH 10-247, Volume 1, Guide to Services 
Contingency Planning—Beddown. For planning purposes, each laundry unit normally supports 
550 persons, although the capability will depend on the type of laundry system used. For the 
Self-Help Laundry System, plan on 5 washers and 10 dryers for every 200 people. For 
commercial-off-the-shelf equipment, plan on one washer and 1.5 dryers for every 20 people. 
11.5.1.  Self-Help Laundry. The self-help laundry is designed for rapid deployment and 
continuous operation as an efficient field laundry system. An entire set contains 10 washers, 
and 20 double-stacked dryers, water heater, 3,000-gallon collapsible bladder water tank, 
supply and drain pumps, electrical distribution panels and associated hardware. The washers, 
dryers and electrical connection boxes are to be operated inside a 32 feet long by 20 feet 
wide facility (TEMPER tent or small shelter system). The pumps, water heater and tank are 
all positioned outside the shelter. The set also includes benches, folding tables and temporary 
hanging racks. The set can be halved into a laundry center of 5 washers and 10 dryers per 
tent to support smaller populations (Figure 11.4). Bare bases also often use heavy-duty 
household or commercial washers and dryers as self-help laundries. 
11.5.1.1.  Utilities. The laundry requires a maximum of 300 amps, 3-phase, 60-cycle, 
120/208 VAC electrical power. This laundry does not come with electrical generation 
equipment and must be connected to the local power source. It can also be operated 
without the water heater, which requires 208 VAC, 3-phase power. Adapters are provided 
to connect this system’s 1-1/2 inch diameter inlet valve assembly to a 2-inch local water 
source. Cold water is then pumped to the washers and to the hot water heater. The drain 
pump draws wastewater and sends it to the local drain piping system or whatever disposal 
system is being used.

Figure 11.4.  Self-Help Laundry Major Components 
 
11.5.1.2.  Site Preparation. The site selected for the laundry facility should be a relatively 
level area with adequate drainage. Laundry equipment requires approximately 75 square 
feet of space inside a TEMPER tent or general-purpose medium or small shelter system, 
which is erected by Force Support personnel. 
11.5.2.  Contract Laundry and Dry Cleaning. Depending on location and need, Force Support 
personnel may establish contract laundry, dry cleaning and linen exchange. This includes 
organizational laundry (e.g. medical) and other needs. Quality of life enhancements might 
include a covered porch, additional chairs and a rudimentary sound system for radio 
broadcasts. 
11.6.  BEAR 550 Kitchen.  The BEAR 550 Kitchen is an optional asset and currently the most 
commonly used food service structure in the BEAR inventory (Figure 11.5). It is designed to 
serve up to 550 personnel and seat 120. That capacity is doubled (1100 personnel and 240 seats) 
when two 550 kitchens are combined (Figure 11.6). All tools, components and equipment, 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  169  
(except electrical and water supplies), that are required to unpack, set up, operate, maintain, 
strike, and repack the facility, are supplied in the shipping containers. Force Support personnel 
normally erect all tents associated with the kitchen; however, engineers provide siting layout and 
supporting utility service (power, water, and wastewater) and install some of the more 
complicated equipment items such as water heaters, walk-in refrigeration units and air 
conditioning units. The power distribution system takes electrical power from an external source 
and steps it down to the power level requirements of the various electric appliances and lights. 
The major components of the power distribution system of 550 kitchen facilities include 
secondary distribution boxes, cable assemblies and lighting harnesses. Electrical power 
requirements are one 225-Amp, 208 VAC, 3 Phase, 60 Hz power source and two 150-kVA 
secondary distribution centers. Refer to T.O. 35E4-169-31, BEAR Base Harvest Falcon/Eagle 
Electric Kitchen with Mess Kit Laundry, for more information on siting kitchen facilities.

11.7.  Single Pallet Expeditionary Kitchen (SPEK).  This specially designed kitchen is 
deployed as a lightweight, highly mobile, temporary kitchen for use at remote and 
underdeveloped areas for periods of up to 30 days (Figure 11.7). As the name implies, the 
BEAR SPEK and all of its equipment fit onto a single 463L air cargo pallet. It is designed to feed 
500 people twice a day in two-hour periods with tray-pack Unitized Group Rations-Heat and 
Serve (UGR-H&S). It comes in an expandable “EISU-90” container and includes a Medium 
Shelter System for diners’ seating space. The SPEK’s critical equipment items are the Tray 
Ration Heater (TRH), which is used to prepare the UGR-H&S menu items, and the Field 
Sanitation Unit (FSU), which is used for cleaning, washing and sanitizing kitchen utensils. The 
TRH and FSU can operate in temperatures from –20 degrees Fahrenheit to +120 degrees 
Fahrenheit and relative humidity ranging from 20 to 80 percent. Local support for water and 
wastewater disposal is required. A 2-kW diesel generator, provided with the kitchen, furnishes 
the electrical power source. The entire kitchen can be easily unpacked and assembled by a 
minimum of 8 personnel in about 2 hours and requires only 4 food service personnel to operate 
its equipment and serve food.

11.8.  M-80 Water Heater.  The M-80 water heater (Figure 11.8) is the primary boiler 
component for several BEAR assets, namely the shave/shower unit, the 550-person kitchen and 
the standardized field laundry. The heater is self-contained and operates on either diesel or 
gasoline, consuming approximately five gallons per hour. It weighs approximately 465 pounds 
and is skid-mounted with forklift tine inserts for ease of movement. Its overall size is 52 inches 
long by 27 inches wide by 47 inches high. It has a capacity of 23.7 gallons and provides nine 
gallons of water per minute at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The heater comes as an integral part of all 
the systems it supports; i.e., it does not have to be requested separately. Details on the operation 
of the M-80 water heater can be found in T.O. 35E7-4-27-1, Heater, Water, Liquid Fuel, M-80, 
and AFH 10-222, Volume 12, Guide to Bare Base Mechanical Systems. 
Figure 11.8.  M-80 Water Heater 
 
11.9.  WH-400 Water Heater.  The WH-400 water heater (Figure 11.9) is being phased into the 
BEAR inventory as a replacement for the M-80. It is a fuel-fired, skid-mounted water heater 
suitable for military transport. It operates using a variety of fuels, including DF1, DF2, DFA, JP-
  172  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
5, and JP-8. The heater dimensions are 75” H x 32” W x 55” L, and weighs 500 pounds in the 
fully functioning, ready-to-operate configuration. It delivers water at a rate of 9 gpm at 
temperatures between 60o F and 190o F (16o C and 88o C). It has a drum fill adaptor assembly 
that permits use of 55-gallon fuel drums for extended operations. 
Figure 11.9.  WH-400 Water Heater 
 
11.10.  130K Portable Heater.  The 130K heater provides heated air for sleeping quarters and 
work facilities (Figure 11.10). This multi-fueled heater will deliver hot air at a minimum of 1000 
cubic feet per minute and at temperatures ranging from 80o F to 180o F—making it ideal for 
extremely cold conditions. It can also provide forced fresh air ventilation without heating. 
Consult AFH-10-222, Volume 12, and T.O. 35E7-3-4-1, Heater, 130K Multi-Fueled, Portable, 
Duct Type 130,000 BTUH Model Polar Bear1, for additional information. 
Figure 11.10.  130K Portable Heater 
 
11.11.  Environmental Control Units (ECUs).  ECUs are used for heating, cooling, 
dehumidifying, filtering, and circulating air in tents, portable shelters and vans to meet the 
controlled environmental requirements of personnel and equipment. ECUs admit fresh air at a 
controlled rate. In a typical application, the air conditioner is located external to the controlled 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  173  
space (normally 4-6 feet away) and conditioned air is circulated into the controlled space through 
supply and return ducts. ECUs are included in BEAR assets in sufficient numbers to support the 
facilities included in each set. 
11.11.1.  Field-Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU). The FDECU is the 
primary BEAR ECU (Figure 11.11). There are several different models fielded and each can 
be used to heat, cool, dehumidify, filter and circulate air in portable shelters and containers 
for personnel and equipment. It provides a maximum of 84,000 BTUs of heat and 67,000 
BTUs of cooling per hour. This unit also uses “ozone friendly” R-134A refrigerant. Perhaps 
most important from a mobility aspect, the FDECU is smaller and considerably lighter than 
the other models. Weight and cube improvements have doubled the number of ECUs that can 
be packaged per pallet. FDECUs can be fitted with chemical, biological and radiological 
filters attached to an inside blower to pressurize the shelter and filter-out harmful agents. 
Additional information on the FDECU can be found in T.O. 35E9-314-1, Field-Deployable 
Environmental Control Unit. 
Figure 11.11.  Field-Deployable Environmental Control Unit 
 
11.11.2.  A/E32C-39. Commonly referred to as the Dash 39 (-39), the ECU-39 (Figure 
11.12) is a BEAR legacy ECU that is being replaced by the FDECU previously addressed. In 
a standard application, the unit is located external to the controlled space and the conditioned 
air circulates through supply and return air ducts. The unit can also be adjusted to admit fresh 
air at a controlled rate. Approximate cooling capacity is 4.5 tons. Approximate heating 
capacity is 9.6 kilowatts (down to approximately 30° F). This unit uses R-22, an ozone-
depleting refrigerant.

11.12.  Walk-In Refrigeration Units.  BEAR packages contain portable, walk-in refrigeration 
units or boxes that support food service storage operations or a field morgue. Refrigeration boxes 
are secure, insulated containers in which the mechanical refrigeration equipment is installed. 
These boxes can be moved by forklift utilizing the forklift holes provided in the aluminum skid, 
which is a permanent part of the boxes. Lifting loops are also provided on each corner near the 
top so that the boxes can be lifted by crane, boom, or helicopter. The walls, floor and ceiling of 
the boxes are aluminum-framed, filled with densely packed insulating foam and covered with 
sheet metal. These boxes must be placed on a smooth, level surface to allow ventilation under the 
floor and ensure proper fitting and closing of the door. Under non-wartime conditions, an 
individual must be universal chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-qualified in order to purchase, dispose 
and recover refrigerants used in these units. Engineers are responsible for the setup, O&M of all 
refrigeration units. 
11.12.1.  Advanced Design Refrigerator, 300 Cubic Foot (ADR-300). The ADR-300 (Figure 
11.13) replaces the 150-cf reefer. It weighs 3,285 pounds and is approximately 9 feet wide by 
7 feet long by 8 feet high. It has forklift pockets and airlift cargo rails on all four sides. The 
ADR-300 has an internal capacity of 6,715 pounds which makes its maximum gross weight 
10,000. It has interior racks with five removable shelves on each side wall that each holds up 
to 300 pounds. The unit is also approved for helicopter sling load operations. Since the 
mechanical refrigeration unit comes already attached, the ADR can be setup by one 
technician, using a 10K forklift, and operational in less than an hour. For additional 
information, refer to T.O. 40R7-6-1, Operator's, Unit, and Direct Support Maintenance 
Manual, Advanced Design Refrigerator, 300 Cubic Foot, (ADR-300) and AFH 10-222, 
Volume 12. 
11.12.2.  150-Cubic Foot (CF) Refrigerator. The 150-cf refrigeration unit (Figure 11.14) is a 
BEAR legacy reefer. It is used for food service, mortuary and medical applications. It weighs 
800 pounds and is approximately 7 feet wide by 7 feet long by 7 feet high overall. When in 
service, it must have a clear space of at least 3 feet around the condenser. These units come 
in two sections: an insulated box and a mechanical refrigeration unit (MRU). See paragraph 
11.12.4. for more information on MRUs. The 150 cubic foot units are being phased-out of 
the inventory and replaced by the ADR-300 previously addressed.

11.12.3.  1200-Cubic Foot Refrigerator. The 1,200-cf refrigeration unit (Figure 11.15) is also 
a BEAR legacy reefer unit. It weighs 4,140 pounds and needs 6 feet of clear space on the 
ends to allow for installation and ventilation of the condenser. This unit comes unassembled, 
and takes 8 people approximately 8 hours (with a forklift) to set up. When set up, the unit is 
approximately 13 feet wide by 17 feet long and 8 feet high. Similar to the 150-cf reefer, this 
unit comes in two sections, insulated box and a mechanical refrigeration unit (MRU). See

Chapter 12 
MEDICAL FACILITIES  
12.1.  Introduction.  Medical resources are of vital importance to contingency and wartime 
operations. Deployment of medical treatment facilities (MTF) is necessary to support and sustain 
sortie generation at the bare base. The basic premise is to treat and return to duty when possible 
or evacuate and replace. Using phased levels of care, the AF has developed multiple deployable 
MTFs to treat and evacuate casualties under all conditions (Figure 12.1). The Expeditionary 
Medical Support (EMEDS) system is a component of the Aerospace Medical Contingency 
Ground Support System. EMEDS is composed of UTC building blocks that provide personnel 
and equipment to meet specific operational requirements. These UTCs enable a deployed MTF 
to expand in an incremental or modular manner to meet the full spectrum of theater 
requirements. These capabilities are used to provide essential care, deferring definitive care to 
the continental United States (CONUS) or supporting theaters. 
Figure 12.1.  Aerial View of Expeditionary Medical Treatment Facility 
 
12.2.  Overview.  This chapter begins with a discussion of the levels of AF medical assets in a 
theater, followed by an outline of CE responsibilities for the support of bare base MTFs. Each 
type of MTF is described in detail to permit planners to gain an appreciation of the magnitude of 
the engineer task involved. Facility layouts are also shown. Finally, engineer support 
requirements are summarized in ready reference tables for efficient use in the planning process. 
12.3.  Concept of Operations and Deployment Sequence.  The Aerospace Medical 
Contingency Ground Support System has almost 200 equipment and personnel UTCs tailored to 
meet specific theater operational requirements. The UTCs enable the main unit of this system, 
the Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH), to deploy in modules and expand to meet the full 
spectrum of specialty care requirements. The medical capability required at a beddown location 
is determined by the expected casualty rates, casualty types, base population, evacuation 
distances, etc. The AFTH starts with the Small, Portable Expeditionary Aeromedical Rapid 
Response (SPEARR) team and, using EMEDS building blocks, expands to as large as 114 beds. 
  178  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
The following paragraphs provide an overview of the major elements of the EMEDS/AFTH, 
(formerly called the Air Transportable Hospital). Air Combat Command (ACC) is responsible 
for Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) for the EMEDS. Tables in this 
chapter provide an overview of the civil engineer and other expeditionary combat support (ECS) 
required for EMEDS. For additional information on EMEDS, see Air Force Tactics, Techniques, 
and Procedures 3-42.7, Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System. 
12.3.1.  EMEDS Basic. The EMEDS Basic package provides medical care for operations 
with a population at risk (PAR) of 1-2,000 personnel and is currently comprised of two 
modules. 
12.3.1.1.  Module 1—SPEARR Team. This 10-person mobile, clinically capable team 
provides care that includes physician-directed resuscitation and stabilization. It may also 
include advanced trauma management, emergency medical procedures and forward 
resuscitative surgery. Supporting capabilities include basic laboratory, limited x-ray, 
pharmacy and temporary holding facilities (Figure 12.2). Patients are treated and 
returned to duty (RTD), or are stabilized for movement to an MTF capable of providing a 
higher level of care. The SPEARR Team can sustain this capability for 5-7 days without 
resupply for a PAR of 1-500 personnel. The team can deploy as man-portable (no shelter 
for patient operations) or with a 6,000-pound sling loadable pallet trailer (patient care 
shelter included). 
Figure 12.2.  Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) SPEARR Facility 
 
12.3.1.2.  Module 2—An additional 15 personnel, supplies and infrastructure to augment 
the previously deployed SPEARR team. When combined with Module 1, this package 
increases medical capability to serve a PAR of up to 2,000 personnel. If necessary, both 
modules may deploy at the same time as a single unit. 
12.3.1.3.  At full capacity, EMEDS Basic has 25 medical personnel plus equipment and 
provides forward stabilization, primary care, dental services, force health protection and 
preparation for aeromedical evacuation. This package has a limited inpatient care 
capability consisting of four holding beds. Full operational capability for EMEDS Basic 
is expected within 12 hours of arrival at the bare base. Again, ECS requirements are 
summarized later in this chapter. 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  179  
12.3.2.  EMEDS+10 Bed AFTH. This package adds another 31 personnel (total of 56) 
providing care that includes resuscitation, initial wound surgery and postoperative treatment. 
EMEDS+10 can provide care for seven days without resupply for a PAR of 2,000-3,000. It 
has 10 inpatient beds and one ambulance. Full operational capability for EMEDS+10 Bed 
AFTH is expected within 24 hours following arrival at the bare base. Full operational 
capability for any of the EMEDS increments is attained when facility and clinical functional 
areas (aerospace medicine, preventive medicine, dental, primary care, C2, emergency care, 
critical care and surgical capability) are fully established. 
12.3.3.  EMEDS+25 Bed AFTH. This package adds another 30 personnel (total of 86) 
providing the same level of medical/dental care as the EMEDS+10, but for a PAR of 3,000-
5,000. The package deploys with seven days of supplies and increases inpatient capacity to 
25 inpatient beds (cumulative) and one additional ambulance. Full operational capability for 
EMEDS+25 Bed AFTH is expected within 24 hours following arrival at the bare base. 
12.3.4.  EMEDS+50 Bed AFTH and up. The EMEDS+50 provides the surgical capability 
found in the smaller hospitals plus rehabilitative and recovery therapy for those who can 
RTD within the theater evacuation policy. This size facility is achieved by adding a 25-bed 
Hospital Medical Expansion Package (HMEP) or Hospital Surgical Expansion Package 
(HSEP) of 25 ward personnel and equipment to the EMEDS+25 Bed AFTH. With multiple 
expansion packages, the EMEDS AFTH is expandable to 114 beds and 299 medical 
personnel. 
12.3.5.  Transportable Blood Transshipment Center (TBTC). This Small Shelter System/ 
International Standardization Organization (ISO) shelter system is staffed with 12 personnel 
and is designed to store and ship frozen and liquid blood products during contingency 
operations. The EMEDS AFTH is only capable of storing about 60 units of blood, but each 
TBTC can hold up to 7,200 units. The TBTC is normally collocated with other supporting 
medical treatment facilities near a strategic airhead or major airfield. Twelve medical 
personnel, with support of a 13K forklift, can assemble the TBTC in 22 hours. It is, however, 
not mobile so it does require base support. Engineer support requirements consist of technical 
assistance (and physical assistance if TBTC staffing is inadequate) for shelter erection and 
provision of power (200-kW), water (300 gal/day) and ice (800 lbs/day). 
12.4.  Civil Engineer Support of Medical Facilities.  In general, AF medical doctrine restricts 
staff capabilities to those actions that directly perform and support medically specific functions 
and technology associated with a medical unit’s mission. For all other functions, the medical 
facility must rely upon CE and those ECS elements to which the medical support is provided. In 
a bare base environment, CE support translates into the following engineer tasks: 
12.4.1.  Site Preparation: Must meet the medical facility’s specific layout requirements. 
12.4.2.  Shelter Erection: Furnish technical direction for shelter erection and, when required, 
augment medical personnel in the assembly of discrete, functional modules into an operating 
hospital complex. An all-terrain forklift must be available to set up the EMEDS/AFTH. 
12.4.3.  Utilities: Provide water; electricity; disposal of wastewater, liquids, solid and 
biological wastes; HVAC support to maintain specified temperatures; and the final 
connection of BEAR utility systems to the medical facility’s utility interfaces. 
  180  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
12.4.4.  O&M: Repair war damage to the physical plant, utility systems and installed non-
medical equipment. 
12.4.5.  Fire Emergency Services: Establish a response posture to meet the fire emergency 
service requirement for the type of medical facility being supported. For determination of 
additive vehicles and personnel, see the Fire appendix in CE Supplement to WMP-1. 
12.4.6.  EOD: Provide instructions and procedures on how to conduct medical post-attack 
and recovery operations in an unexploded ordnance environment. 
12.5.  Support Requirement by Type of EMEDS Facility. 
12.5.1.  Facility Shelters. All medical functions are housed in Small Shelter Systems (SSS), 
except for surgery, x-ray and lab which are housed in ISO shelters. EMEDS Basic is housed 
in three SSSs (Figure 12.3). The EMEDS+10 adds three additional SSSs and the 
EMEDS+25 adds three more (for a total complex of nine SSSs) plus three ISO shelters. A 
13K all-terrain forklift will be required to move these containers. Since the EMEDS is 
designed in a modular or incremental fashion, a quick response sub-set can be transported in 
one C-130 aircraft, as shown in Table 12.1.

12.5.2.  EMEDS Basic has a one pallet SPEARR trailer, known as the Expanded Capability 
and Infrastructure Module (ECIM). It is sling-loadable which enables movement by 
helicopter if mission circumstances dictate. 
12.5.3.  Components and Equipment. The EMEDS deploys with tools needed for erection. 
One 10-kW (single-phase only) generator deploys with the SPEARR for initial power. 
EMEDS Basic requires base support for power. EMEDS+10 and +25 deploy with a total of 
two MEP-7 portable 100-kW generators (for initial and backup power) and a 400-gallon 
water trailer. One additional 100-kW generator is provided when adding a 25-bed HMEP or 
HSEP. 
12.5.4.  Site Requirements. The EMEDS should be sited in low-threat areas, but near support 
group services such as showers, billeting, kitchen, etc. Site grades must slope away from the 
shelter to preventing flooding. 
12.5.5.  External Support Requirements. The EMEDS is equipped and staffed to provide 
medical support only, and is therefore dependent on CE and base support as summarized in 
Table 12.2.

12.6.  Aeromedical Staging Facilities. 
12.6.1.  Mobile Aeromedical Staging Facility (MASF).  The MASF is a 13-person mobile, 
tented, temporary staging facility that provides rapid response patient staging, limited 
holding and supports small scale contingency (SSC), humanitarian and civil disaster response 
operations, and major theater war (MTW). Once deployed, the MASF is an aeromedical 
evacuation (AE) system asset subordinate to the expeditionary AE Squadron to which they 
  184  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
are assigned and or attached. The MASF assists in the carrying out of the AE mission, and is 
normally located at or near airheads capable of supporting mobility airlift (Figure 12.4). 
Figure 12.4.  Patients Prepared for Aeromedical Evacuation 
 
12.6.1.1.  The MASF is equipped and staffed for routine wartime processing of 10 
patients at a time, a maximum flow of 40 patients in a 24-hour period, and a maximum 6 
hour patient hold time. It is made up of patient care and support personnel. An additional 
MASF package along with UTC FFQM2 (MASF Expansion Package +25) must be 
added to increase the wartime patient flow to 80 patients per 24 hour period. 
12.6.1.2.  Facility Shelters, Components and Equipment. The ASF uses 168 TEMPER 
tent sections. Tools needed for erection, portable 100-kW generators (for initial and 
backup power) and the environmental control systems are deployed with the ASF 
increments. The site should not have more than a 6-inch drop in 20 feet. The ASF must 
be sited near a base or support complex. 
12.6.2.  Contingency Aeromedical Staging Facility (CASF).  The CASF provides 
personnel and equipment necessary for 24-hour staging operations for patients transiting the 
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) system worldwide. The CASF coordinates and communicates 
with medical and AE elements to accomplish patient care and patient movement, including 
ground transportation. It provides patient reception, complex medical/surgical nursing, 
limited emergent intervention, and ensures patients are medically and administratively 
prepared for flights.

located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. The Readiness Support Directorate (HQ 
AFCESA/CEX) acts as the Air Force program manager for civil engineer contingency response 
planning. 
Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP)—A program under which civilian 
contractors/commercially available resources can be used to fill critical base operating support 
functions/asset requirements that occur during a wide range of contingency, crisis, and wartime 
operations. AFCAP uses civilian contractual assistance during peacetime to locate and plan for 
the acquisition of worldwide commercial resources (personnel and materiel) assets to meet AF 
wartime support requirements. 
Area of Operations (AO)—An operational area defined by the joint force commander for land 
and naval forces. Areas of operation do not typically encompass the entire operational area of the 
joint force commander, but should be large enough for component commanders to accomplish 
their missions and protect their forces. 
Bare Base—A base having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain and support operations 
to include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways and aircraft parking areas. A bare base must 
have a source of water that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate under bare 
conditions form a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base.

incapacitating munitions/agents and the warning and protective measures associated with such 
  196  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
offensive operations. Since riot control agents and herbicides are not considered to be chemical 
warfare agents, those two items are referred to separately or under the broader term "chemical", 
which is used to include all types of chemical munitions or agents collectively (JP 1-02). 
Collective Protection Shelter—A filtered air shelter that provides a contamination-free working 
environment for selected portions of the force such as command and control elements. The 
shelter allows relief from continuous wear of chemical protective equipment. 
Collocated Operating Base—An active or Reserve allied airfield designated for joint or 
unilateral use by US Air Force wartime augmentation forces or for wartime relocation of US Air 
Force in-theater forces. COBs are not US bases. 
Command and Control—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated 
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command 
and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, 
communications, facilities and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, 
coordinating and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission (JP 1-
02). 
Contingency—An emergency, involving military forces, caused by natural disasters, terrorists, 
subversives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, 
contingencies require plans, rapid response and special procedures to ensure the safety and 
readiness of personnel, installations and equipment (JP 1-02). 
Contingency Plan—A plan for major contingencies that can reasonably be anticipated in the 
principal geographic subareas of the command (JP 1-02). 
Contingency Response Plan—A base civil engineer plan of action developed in anticipation of 
all types of contingencies, emergencies and disasters. 
Decontamination—The process of making any person, object, or area safe by absorbing, 
destroying, neutralizing, making harmless, or removing chemical or biological agents or by 
removing radioactive material clinging to or around it. 
Deployment—The relocation of forces and material to desired areas of operations or to a staging 
area. Deployment encompasses all activities from origin or home station through destination, 
specifically including within the United States, inter-theater and intra-theater movement legs, 
staging and holding areas. (JP 1-02). Deployment begins when the first aircraft, personnel, or 
item of equipment leaves the home base. The force is deployed when the last component of the 
unit has arrived at the desired area. 
Dispersal—Relocation of forces for the purpose of increasing survivability. 
Doctrine—Fundamental principles by which military forces guide their actions in support of the 
national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application (JP 1-02). 
Expeditionary Operation—An operation conducted by an armed force organized to accomplish 
a specific objective in a foreign country. Examples of expeditionary operations include engaging 
in armed conflict; protecting US citizens or commerce abroad; providing humanitarian assistance

include explosive ordnance that has become hazardous by damage or deterioration. 
Fabric Covered Structures—A construction type that can be identified by wood or metal 
(usually aluminum) posts or load-bearing frames with some type of fabric (such as canvas) 
stretched or pulled over the posts or frames. Examples of the types of structures that should be 
considered under this classification of structures include Frame-Supported Tensioned Fabric 
Structures (FSTFS); Tent, Extendable, Modular, Personnel (TEMPER Tents); and Small and 
Medium Shelter Systems (SSS and MSS); General Purpose (GP) Medium tents and GP Large 
tents; and air supported fabric 
structures. Testing has shown that for these fabric structures, the posts and frames are 
what cause hazards (UFC 4—010-01). 
Facility—Any structure, pavement, or utility system that supports Air Force operations. For 
emergency planning purposes, the term facility in 40 CFR 355, as it applies to the Air Force, is 
considered equivalent to an installation. 
Force Beddown—The provision of expedient facilities for troop support to provide a platform 
for the projection of force. These facilities may include modular or kit-type substitutes (JP 3-34). 
Force Module—A grouping of combat, combat support and combat service support forces, with 
their accompanying supplies and the required nonunit resupply and personnel necessary to 
sustain forces for a minimum of 30 days. The elements of force modules are linked together or 
are uniquely identified so that they may be extracted from or adjusted as an entity in the Joint 
Operation Planning and Execution System databases to enhance flexibility and usefulness of the 
operation during a crisis (JP 1-02). 
Forward Operating Base—An airfield used to support tactical operations without establishing 
full support facilities. The base may be used for an extended time period. Support by a main 
operating base will be required to provide backup support for a forward operating base (JP 1-02). 
Harvest Eagle—A nickname for a legacy air transportable, tent-based system of housekeeping 
support facilities designed to provide basic living accommodations, field feeding and hygiene 
support under bare base conditions. Each kit is designed to provide softwall housekeeping 
support for 550 personnel. Facilities are not air conditioned and are powered with low voltage, 
tactical power generator systems. Examples of Harvest Eagle equipment are water purification 
units, tents and showers. Harvest Eagle packages are being entirely phased out and the 
equipment phased into BEAR modules. 
Harvest Falcon—A nickname for a legacy air transportable system of hardwall shelters, tents, 
equipment and vehicles designed to provide worldwide support of personnel and squadron size 
aircraft deployments under bare base conditions. These sets provide direct mission and 
housekeeping support facilities for up to 55,000 personnel and 822 aircraft at up to 15 separate 
beddown locations. It includes facilities, equipment and supplies necessary to establish and 
maintain base support functions such as base civil engineering, vehicle maintenance, supply, 
chapel, pest management, field exchange, administration and chaplain support. Harvest Falcon is 
  198  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
sized into 50, 1,100-person bare base housekeeping sets, 15 flightline initial sets, 25 flightline 
follow-on support sets and 15 industrial operations support sets. Harvest Falcon sets are being 
entirely phased out and the equipment phased into BEAR modules. 
Hazardous Material—All hazardous substances, petroleum, natural gas, synthetic gas, acutely 
toxic chemicals and other toxic chemicals including hazardous waste. 
High Threat Area—An area that, because of its location or strategic targets, is highly 
susceptible to enemy attacks.

The plan outlines all facets of operations at a collocated operating base to include personnel, 
facilities and equipment. 
Limiting Factor—A factor or condition that, either temporarily or permanently, impedes 
mission accomplishment. Illustrative examples are transportation network deficiencies, lack of 
in-place facilities, malpositioned forces or materiel, extreme climatic conditions, distance, transit 
or overflight rights, political conditions, etc. 
Main Operating Base (MOB)—In special operations, a base established by a joint force special 
operations component commander or a subordinate special operations component commander in 
friendly territory to provide sustained command and control, administration and logistical 
support to special operations activities in designated areas. Also, a base on which all essential 
buildings and facilities are erected and organizational and intermediate maintenance capability 
exists for assigned weapon systems. The intermediate maintenance capability may be expanded 
to support specific weapon systems deployed to the MOB. Also called main operations base. 
Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK)—-A data system that supports 
contingency and general war planning with predefined and standardized personnel and 
equipment force packages. MEFPAK has two subsystems: the Manpower Force Packaging 
System (MANFOR) and the Logistics Force Packaging System (LOGFOR). 
Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR)—A MEFPAK subsystem that provides: (1) 
the title of the unit or force element and its unique Joint Chiefs of Staff Unit Type Code, (2) the 
mission capability statement (MISCAP) containing the definition of a UTC’s capability, and (3) 
the manpower detail by function, grade (officers only) and Air Force specialty required to meet 
the defined capability. 
Operation Plan—Any plan, except for the Single Integrated Operation Plan, for the conduct of 
military operations. Plans are prepared by combatant commanders in response to requirements 
established by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by commanders of subordinate 
commands in response to requirements tasked by the establishing unified commander. Operation 
plans are prepared in either a complete format (OPLAN) or as a concept plan (CONPLAN). The 
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
  199  
CONPLAN can be published with or without a time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) 
file. 
a. OPLAN—An operation plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis for 
development of an operation order (OPORD). An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies 
required to execute the combatant commander’s strategic concept and a movement schedule of 
these resources to the theater of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in TPFDD 
files. OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation. The plan is prepared with the 
appropriate annexes, appendixes and TPFDD files as described in the Joint Operation Planning 
and Execution System manuals containing planning policies, procedures and formats. 
b. CONPLAN—An operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require considerable 
expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the 
combatant commander’s strategic concept and those annexes and appendixes deemed necessary 
by the combatant commander to complete planning. Generally, detailed support requirements are 
not calculated and TPFDD files are not prepared. 
c. CONPLAN with TPFDD—A CONPLAN with TPFDD is the same as a CONPLAN except 
that it requires more detailed planning for phased deployment of forces. 
Playbook Option—Equipment available to but excluded from BEAR sets to allow planners 
greater tasking flexibility. While these items provide significant capability, they may not be 
needed in the core BEAR sets each and every deployment. Playbook options consist of 16 major 
UTCs including the MAAS, 550 kitchen, EALS, self-help laundry, AM-2 matting and ROWPU. 
Potable Water—Water that is safe for drinking because it is free from contamination, pollution 
and harmful impurities. 
Primary Circuit—An electrical circuit carrying greater than 600 volts. 
Prime BEEF (Base Engineer Emergency Forces)—A headquarters US Air Force, major 
command (MAJCOM) and base-level program that organizes civil engineer forces for worldwide 
direct and indirect combat support roles. It assigns civilian employees and military personnel to 
both peacetime real property maintenance and wartime engineering functions. 
Readiness—The ability of US military forces to fight and meet the demands of the national 
military strategy. Readiness is the synthesis of two distinct but interrelated levels: (a) Unit 
readiness – the ability to provide capabilities required by the Combatant Commanders to execute 
their assigned missions. This is derived from the ability of each unit to deliver the outputs for 
which it was designed. (b) Joint readiness – the Combatant Commander’s ability to integrate and 
synchronize ready combat and support forces to execute his or her assigned missions (JP 1-02). 
RED HORSE Squadrons (RHS)—These squadrons provide the Air Force with a highly 
mobile, self-sufficient, rapidly deployable civil engineering capability required in a potential 
theater of operations. 
Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU)— A water purification device that uses 
a series of membranes to eliminate impurities. The ROWPU is capable of removing dissolved 
minerals. 
Secondary Circuit—An electrical circuit carrying less than 600 volts. 
  200  
AFPAM10-219V5  30 MARCH 2012 
Standoff—A steel or wood curtain erected approximately 10 feet in front of a protective 
structure to detonate shells and thereby reduce the penetrating effect. 
Survivability—Capability of a system to accomplish its mission in the face of an unnatural 
(man-made) hostile, scenario-dependent environment. Survivability may be achieved by 
avoidance, hardness, proliferation, or reconstitution (or a combination). 
Temporary Structures—Those structures that are erected with an expected occupancy of 3 
years or less. This group of structures typically includes wood frame and rigid wall construction, 
and such things as Southeast Asia (SEA) Huts, hardback tents, ISO and CONEX containers, pre-
engineered buildings, trailers, stress tensioned shelters, Expandable Shelter Containers (ESC), 
and Aircraft Hangars (ACH). 
Terrorism—The calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to instill 
fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are 
generally political, religious, or ideological. 
Time-Phased Force and Deployment List (TPFDL)—Appendix 1 to Annex A of the operation 
plan which identifies types or actual units required to support the operation plan and indicates 
origin and ports of debarkation or ocean area. It may also be generated as a computer listing from 
the time-phased force and deployment data. 
Unit Type Code (UTC)—A Joint Chiefs of Staff developed and assigned code, consisting of 
five characters that uniquely identify a “type unit.” 
War And Mobilization Plan (WMP)—The Air Force supporting plan to the Joint Strategic 
Capabilities Plan. The six volumes of the WMP extend through the Future Years Defense 
Program to provide continuity in short- and mid-range war and mobilization planning. It 
provides current planning cycle policies and planning factors for the conduct and support of 
wartime operations. It establishes requirements for development of mobilization and production 
planning programs to support sustained contingency operations of the programmed forces. The

Attachment 6 
CIVIL ENGINEER CONTINGENCY PLANNING FACTORS 
A6.1.  Introduction.  This attachment outlines the basic planning factors for the many potential 
CE contingency tasks (see Table A6.1). It lists the manpower, major materials and equipment 
required for each and provides typical completion time frames. 
A6.2.  Column Definitions and Explanations.  The planning factors are based on several 
considerations. Many are derived from field experience, others are extracted from technical 
orders and some are estimates. The following paragraphs describe the column headings in Table 
A6.1 
A6.2.1.  Task. Only tasks which represent an activity are shown. Knowledge-only tasks are 
not included since they do not have a clearly delineated duration or end result. 
A6.2.2.  Air Force Specialty (AFS). AFSs identified in this column are those most closely 
associated with the task. This could be from a peacetime perspective, a multi-skilling 
perspective, or contingency-only perspective. 
A6.2.3.  Number of Personnel. This column identifies the number of personnel normally 
required for a task to be completed within the planned timeframe. 
A6.2.4.  Standard. The standard estimates shown are either go/no-go or represent clock hours 
(duration), not manhours. They also represent common working conditions, e.g., fair 
weather vice snow storms or thundershowers. In many cases they portray completion of 
generic tasks, relatively uncomplicated in nature, and therefore should not be viewed as the 
"correct time" for completion of detailed, complex tasks using the same piece of equipment. 
When viewed in this optimum environment, the times should generally be conservative and a 
well-trained, fully equipped team or crew should be able to perform the tasks within the time 
frames indicated. 
A6.2.5.  Major Material and Equipment Requirements. This column lists the primary 
equipment and material items needed to perform each task. Obviously, some substitutions 
can be made. In both training and contingency instances, variations are not only possible but 
probable. For example, if a dozer is identified for construction of an evaporation lagoon or 
building a protective berm, it should not be construed to mean that no other piece of 
equipment can be used for these tasks. Additionally, not all materials or equipment items 
were identified—most tasks will require a multitude of hand tools and minor supply and 
consumable items. 
A6.2.6.  References. This column shows the primary references for the task.

Note 1: The turning radius assumed by a designer when investigating possible turning paths 
and is set at the centerline of the front axle of a vehicle. If the minimum turning path is 
assumed, the CTR approximately equals the minimum design turning radius minus one-half 
the front width of the vehicle. (Ref. Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, American Association of 
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO))

Table A7.26.  Calculate Quantity of Water Flowing in a Stream 
Calculation of Quantity of Water Flowing in a Stream 
Formula: Q = 6.4 x A x V 
  where  Q = Quantity of water in gallons per minute 
  6.4 = Constant. There are 7.5 gallons of water per cubic foot. However,    
            because of error in stream measurement, 7.5 is reduced to 6.4. 
    V = Velocity of the stream in feet per minute. This figure is obtained by 
            noting the time it takes a twig or floating object to travel a known  
            distance. 
     A = Area of the stream in square feet. This figure is obtained by  
             multiplying the width of the stream by the depth of the stream. 
Illustrative Problem: A stream has an average depth of 2 feet and a width of 16 feet. A 
twig floats 13.3 feet per minute. How many gallons per minute are flowing in the 
stream? 
 
Q = 6.4 x A x V 
= 6.4 x 2 x 16 x 13.3 
= 2,732.8 gallons per minute

Table A7.27.  Convert Volume to Weight of Water 
Conversion of Volume to Weight of Water 
Formula: Weight of water in pounds = Cubic feet of water x 62.4 
Illustrative Problem: What is the weight of water in a full tank with a volume of 470 
cubic feet? 
 
Weight of water = Cubic feet x 62.4 
   = 470 x 62.4 
   = 29, 328 pounds 
     (Ref: FM 10-52-1) 
 
Table A7.28.  Convert Pounds Per Square Inch to Vertical Feet of Water 
 
Conversion of Pounds Per Square Inch to Vertical Feet of Water 
Formula: Vertical feet of water = Pounds per square inch = 2.3 
Illustrative Problem: How many vertical feet of water are in a tank that is 45 feet high? 
A pressure gauge at the bottom of the tank reads 9 pounds per square inch. 
 
Vertical feet of water = Pounds per square inch x 2.3 
        = 9 x 2.3 
        = 20.7

water? 
 
Gallons of water = Cubic feet of water x 7.5 
      = 400 x 7.5 
      = 3,000

L = Length in feet 
W = Width in feet 
H = Height in feet 
Illustrative Problem: What is the volume of a rectangular tank that is 10 feet long, 7 feet 
wide, and 4 feet high? 
V = L x W x H 
    = 10 x 7 x 4 
    = 280 cubic feet                                                                            (Ref: FM 10-52-1)

Notes: 
1. EMERGENCY ONLY. 
2. Blended with 50% Diesel (DF-2 only) by volume. Aviation Fuel Grade JP-4 (or Jet B) should 
be used only when no other fuels are available. JP-4 (or Jet B) and mixtures of JP-4 (or Jet B) 
and other fuels are dangerous due to the extremely low flash point of the JP-4 (or Jet B). When 
this fuel or fuel mixtures must be used in DAY TANKS or operating tanks located inside 
buildings or structures, every precaution must be taken to protect the product from any ignition 
source. Base Ground Safety Personnel must be consulted prior to implementing use of JP-4 in 
diesel engines. Tanks containing this mixture should be temporarily marked - BLENDED 
FUEL IN USE — DANGER. 
3. Some units powered by diesel fuels are authorized to operate on JP-5/JP-8 as a primary or 
alternate fuel. Refer to the applicable equipment manual for instructions. 
4. Blending and burning alternate fuels with conventional boiler fuel must be coordinated with 
civil engineering at command level. For detailed engineering data on blending, contact 
AFCESA/CESM, 139 Barnes 
Drive, Suite 1, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403-5319; COMM - (850) 283-6222, DSN - 523-6222. 
5. Blended 50/50 with JP-4. Under no circumstances should this blend be premixed and stored. 
Equipment utilizing this blend should be tagged - BLENDED FUEL IN USE.  
6. Some mobile electric power units are authorized to operate on diesel fuels as an alternate 
fuel. Refer to the applicable equipment manual for clarification. Contact the applicable AFMC 
technical office if further clarification is required.                                       (Ref. AFPAM 23-221)
