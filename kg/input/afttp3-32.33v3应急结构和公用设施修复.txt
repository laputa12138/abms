Chapter 1 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. Overview. Air Force civil engineers often make expedient repairs to base 
facilities and infrastructure damaged from the effects of natural disasters, major 
accidents, or hostile acts. The goal of expedient repairs is to sustain or ensure 
continued mission operations, prevent significant additional damage to facilities 
and infrastructure, and protect the safety and security of the installation, mission, 
or personnel. Expedient repairs should be improved as time and supplies permit. 
This AFTTP provides examples of expedient repair methods for structures and 
utility systems when immediate action is necessary and standard resources are 
unavailable. While mostly applicable during wartime and overseas contingency 
operations, some procedures may be options during disaster recovery and 
humanitarian assistance operations. The material applications and expedient 
repair methods illustrated herein are compiled from multiple sources, including 
data from Department of Defense (DOD), Joint, and Service publications as well 
as Best Practices and Lessons Learned from AF Civil Engineers and the US Army 
Corps of Engineers (USACE). Any data and procedures presented are general in 
nature and does not constitute mandatory guidance. Personnel should adhere to 
directive AF guidance for related equipment, systems, and procedures. 
 
1.2. Environmental Considerations. The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is 
committed to maintaining environmental quality to ensure long-term access to the 
air, land, and water needed to protect United States interests abroad. Although a 
high level of environmental quality can be difficult to achieve during contingency 
operations overseas, the health and safety of personnel are critical in any military 
operation. Safe food, water, air, and a means of properly disposing of waste is 
essential. The intention of environmental goals during contingencies is to 
minimize risks to human health and safety and prevent unnecessary damage to the 
environment while maximizing the natural resources available to support 
readiness and operational effectiveness. Further information on integrating 
environmentally responsible practices during contingency operations is located in 
Department of Defense Instruction 4715.22, Environmental Management Policy

for Contingency Locations, and Air Force Handbook 10-222V4, Environmental 
Considerations for Overseas Contingency Operations. 
 
1.3. General Safety Practices. During CE expedient construction or repairs, it is 
important to be both flexible and safe, especially if employing nonstandard 
methods and materials. You should not compromise safety, because it could result 
in personnel injuries or disabled equipment, and negatively affect the mission. 
Below are some general safety considerations for CE construction and repair 
activities. See detail safety procedures and requirements in subsequent chapters. 
 
1.3.1. Construction and repair work often involves activities that are hazardous to 
personnel. Workers and supervisors should be vigilant; adhere to technical data 
warnings and cautions and wear protective clothing and equipment in accordance 
with safety information and standards. 
 
1.3.2. Crew leaders should know assigned personnel’s capabilities and limitations 
and monitor all work efforts accordingly. In addition, ensure activities are 
coordinated with all involved. For example, debris removal from inside and 
around facilities can be a dangerous task and vibrations from heavy equipment 
can cause a building to collapse on recovery workers. Not only should all worksite 
personnel be cognizant of this hazard, but they should also be aware and able to 
recognize other potential safety hazards associated with the job. 
 
1.3.3. A key responsibility of supervisors is to ensure personnel have and wear 
the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) and individual protective 
equipment (IPE) for the working environment. Make wear of PPE a routine 
practice for hazards such as dust and noise, and when handling sharp objects and 
construction materials. When working in a contaminated environment, be sure to 
wear the appropriate IPE for the hazard present. In addition, wash contaminated 
clothing and take a shower as soon as possible after working in a contaminated 
environment. Additionally, it is important to protect workers from hazards such 
as high-pressure subsystems and components, harmful solvents and adhesives, 
and infectious black and gray water products from wastewater systems. Note: 
Black water refers to latrine wastewater containing human waste. Gray water 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
15 
 
 
refers to wastewater from non-latrine sources such as showers, laundries, kitchen 
operations, and handwashing devices. 
 
1.3.3.1. Department of the Air Force Manual (DAFMAN) 91-203, Air Force 
Occupational Safety, Fire, and Health Standards, lists PPE for selected CE 
activities. Although technical orders (T.O.) and other job-related publications 
address proper wear and use of PPE and IPE (for Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) defense), workers have the ultimate 
responsibility to properly use, inspect, and care for protective equipment assigned 
to them. Be sure to contact Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) and/or 
Occupational Safety personnel for assistance in selecting the appropriate PPE. 
Note: Non-disposable respirators shall not be worn unless the individual has been 
properly fit-tested by BE personnel. 
 
1.3.3.2. Workers should adhere to NFPA 70, Article 250 of Grounding and 
bonding of electrical systems, for dangerous voltages and to the IEEE Green book 
for information above that is discussed in NFPA 70. PPE that provides appropriate 
arc flash protection is required for all personnel working on or near exposed 
energized electrical equipment operating at 50 volts or more. Unified Facilities 
Criteria (UFC) 3-560-01, O&M: Electrical Safety and National Fire Protection 
Association (NFPA) 70E, Standard for Electric Safety in the Workplace, address 
tasks that require Arc Flash PPE. 
 
1.3.4. Every job or operation has its own safety hazards, and everyone involved 
must follow proper safety procedures to prevent injury or illness. This is extra 
critical during force beddown at austere locations and base recovery activities. 
Exposure to construction, power production, and heavy equipment, fuel and 
mechanical systems, and water or wastewater systems makes for an assortment of 
job related hazards—remain vigilant to stay safe. 
 
1.4. Managing and Documenting Expedient Repairs. Equally critical to rapidly 
responding to contingency work requirements is the need to establish appropriate 
record keeping practices at the very beginning of the recovery efforts. Depending 
on the nature of the event, the installation may need to provide recovery cost 
details to higher headquarters. Aggregate costs may be useful to define and defend

external installation reimbursement to aid in defraying the overall costs to the 
Base Civil Engineer (BCE). 
 
1.4.1. Reporting Tools: Installations need to be aware of and use the following 
tools as appropriate: 
 
1.4.1.1. Storm Damage Tracker: Installations should coordinate with their major 
command or Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center Detachment to 
determine if the IMSC O&M (3400/3410 appropriation only) Storm Damage 
Tracker tool should be used. Details at:

STRUCTURAL REPAIR CONSIDERATIONS, AREA SAFETY,  
AND DEBRIS CLEARING 
 
2.1. Structural Repair Considerations. After an attack, disaster, or other base 
emergency, expedient structural repairs may be necessary to mitigate damages 
and allow continuation of important base functions. Structural engineers should 
examine facilities with damaged structural components or that show signs of 
possible structural failure to determine feasibility of repair and proper repair 
methods. If a facility is determined to be beyond repair, consider its potential as a 
source of material for expedient roof patching, confining walls, and shoring for 
other repairable structures. If electing to perform structural repairs, consider 
issues related to safety, expediency, mission, practicality, and flexibility. 
 
2.1.1. Safety. War and contingency environments are hazardous enough without 
endangering personnel through unsafe acts during repair activities. For example, 
weakened structures; live electrical wires down; explosive gas vapors, chemical, 
or biological contamination; or unexploded ordnance littering the installation are 
hazards that may exist. Additionally, base medical facilities may be crowded with 
casualties, and the CE workforce may likely be at critical levels. These conditions 
make it essential not to further strain limited resources with injuries resulting from 
neglect of safety procedures. Consider steps to calm or moderate enthusiasm for 
getting the job done with a prudent assessment of the risks confronted. Take the 
time to make a preliminary survey of any suspect structures before repairs are 
attempted. Especially, when CE personnel are providing assistance to off-base 
civilian agencies during a major disaster, because they could encounter various 
structures and hazards uncommon to the installation environment. 
 
2.1.2. Expediency. CE recovery efforts immediately following an incident should 
be limited to minimum-essential repair of crucial facilities. Work performed 
should concentrate on structural integrity, mitigation/safety, then functional rather 
than cosmetic repairs. Focus structural repair efforts toward making a facility safe 
for occupancy and providing minimal protection from the elements to persons 
using the facility. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
19 
 
 
2.1.3. Mission. Predetermined facility priority lists establish repair priority of 
facilities to the overall base mission. In the absence of a priority list, damaged 
facilities accommodating activities that are not essential to the assigned mission 
and do not present a hazard should be left as they are until time and resources 
permit conventional repairs. 
 
2.1.4. Practicality. Consider other related repair activities affecting the facility. 
For example, if the facility provides service to aircraft and access pavements are 
so severely damaged that they are not usable for days, then structural repairs can 
usually wait. Similarly, if supporting utility systems to a facility are far beyond 
emergency repair, consider delaying the structural portion of the repair effort. On 
the other hand, lack of full utility service does not mean a building will be useless. 
A facility with partial utility service, e.g., electricity but no water can usually 
continue functioning for its wartime purpose. The CE unit control center (UCC) 
will have to make real-time decisions as to the practicality of repairs. 
 
2.1.5. Flexibility. Flexibility is essential to any expedient repair effort—including 
ones of a structural nature. During wartime, expect repair priorities to change; 
engineer efforts should adjust accordingly. As might be expected, no two attacks 
on the base will be identical; therefore, no structural repair tasks will be identical. 
Even during peacetime contingencies, engineer forces should not be locked into 
an unyielding standard set of facility priorities or spend a lot of time on minor 
repairs to the detriment of other more pressing requirements. For example: 
 
2.1.5.1. Emergency repairs to a power generating plant may prove more important 
at some point in time than minor repairs to either an installation command and 
control (C2) center or other normally high-priority facility. 
 
2.1.5.2. There may be some facilities damaged beyond the unit’s expedient repair 
capabilities. If such a facility is vital to the base mission, consider converting 
another facility to meet the uninhabitable facility’s role. Using an understanding 
of the function of the destroyed structure, engineers can evaluate potential 
alternate facilities in terms of size, utilities support, and other special functional 
requirements. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
20 
 
 
2.1.5.3. Base Civil Engineers (BCE) consider two main factors, among others, 
when selecting or recommending facilities for conversion: First, what other 
structures on the base come closest to satisfying requirements for an alternate 
facility? Second, how much work will be required to convert the facility for its 
intended use? If there are no special concerns, the structure meeting the functional 
requirements and taking the least amount of time to convert may be the best 
option. 
 
2.2. Area Clearing and Safety Practices. Area clearing and safety are important 
considerations before performing expedient repairs following an emergency. 
Whether on base or off base, some hazards may not be identified or quickly 
cleared after an incident. Problems could arise when setting up for emergency 
repairs even after first responders have been through the facilities. As addressed 
below, some of the hazards you could encounter include unexploded ordnance, 
downed electrical wires, broken gas lines, and loose hazardous materials 
(airborne, liquid, or solid); biological hazards; animals and insects; and asbestos 
and lead contamination. Consider these and other potential health and safety 
problems before accomplishing repairs. 
 
2.2.1. Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). After a wartime or terrorist attack, or during 
humanitarian assistance efforts, UXOs can be a problem for engineers recovering 
facilities and utilities. In a war zone, sometimes weapons used against facilities 
may not all detonate. During floods, currents can move UXOs and hide them 
under debris. Both situations can create significant hazards. 
 
2.2.2. Biological Hazards and Disease-Causing Contaminants.  Biological hazards 
and disease-causing contaminants can be a problem after an attack or natural 
disaster. Whether accidental or deliberate release and dissemination, they could 
have adverse effects on human, plant, or animal health. These hazards include 
medical wastes, microorganisms, viruses, or toxins (from a biological source). 
Natural biological hazards and hazardous wastes can also be problems for 
engineers conducting emergency repairs after floods, hurricanes, and other natural 
disasters. Debris and floodwaters may expose rotting animal carcasses and sewage 
(blackwater) that contain pathogenic microbes, viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Some 
buildings affected by conventional attacks, hurricanes, or contaminated 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
21 
 
 
floodwaters have walls, insulation, floors, and ventilation systems that can 
become breeding grounds for biologic pathogens. Building materials can exhibit 
a wicking effect that draws water into and up the walls—as much as three feet 
above the water line. Even if workers avoid becoming contaminated while 
repairing the facility, occupants working in the buildings afterwards may quickly 
become seriously ill as the pathogens (disease-producing microorganisms) grow 
and become airborne. Drying building materials to less than 30 percent moisture 
will inhibit spore growth. If time is available, make sure that the work area and 
critical facilities are free of contaminants, even if it requires ripping out wallboard, 
floor covering, and insulation. Consider hosing off impermeable surface 
contaminants with clean water or disinfectant at the work site. 
 
2.2.3. Structural Damage. As emergency repairs are underway, efforts may halt if 
the building incurs additional consequential structural damage by wind and water 
after the initial onslaught. When sheetrock becomes wet, it loses strength and 
becomes heavier. The additional weight and loss of strength can cause further 
damage or collapse. If repair delays occur, provide temporary protection and early 
cleanup to avoid additional damage. Shoring procedures may also be necessary, 
if so, see subsequent chapters for structural shoring and bracing information. 
 
2.2.4. Electrical Hazards. Electrical lines can be a potential problem following 
bomb damage, hurricanes, tornados, or floods. Overhead electrical lines are 
vulnerable and easily knocked down. They can be especially hard to see at night 
and others may not have made the wires safe. Damaged underground electrical 
lines can charge soil, standing water, and be difficult to find. A generator 
powering a nearby work site can send power through damaged electrical systems 
and reenergize wires at the work site. When working in this type of environment, 
watch for loose wires and ensure main power panels are off before entering a 
building for emergency repair, especially when working on metal roofs or metal 
structures near damaged electrical lines. 
 
2.2.5. Gaseous Hazards. Leaking or ruptured gas tanks and lines are serious 
hazards with a potential for explosions and fires. Winds and flooding can carry 
away compressed gas tanks or drums containing chemicals from damaged 
facilities. As the floodwaters and wind move the containers about, they can easily 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
22 
 
 
penetrate building walls. Be alert for leaking gas from tanks or ruptured utility 
lines and pay particular attention to smells when around buildings. An extremely 
offensive, garlicky odor is usually associated with mercaptans (a class of sulfur-
containing compounds) added to natural or bottled gas. Even moderate damage 
can turn deadly when leaking gas is involved. A weak chlorine odor may indicate 
arcing electrical wires. Note: Some gas hazards can be extremely dangerous but 
do not have a smell. 
 
2.2.6. Flammable or Combustible Liquid Hazards. Hazards related to flammable 
and combustible liquids include explosions, burns from fire, chemical burns, 
asphyxiation, inhalation of vapors, absorption through the skin, skin irritation, and 
eye damage from direct contact or exposure. After an airfield attack or natural 
disaster, response, cleanup, or construction crews could be exposed to flammable 
or combustible liquids from leaking containers or ruptured storage systems and 
distribution lines. Common examples of flammable and combustible liquids are 
gasoline, acetone, lacquer thinner, kerosene, fuel oil, mineral spirits, etc. The 
volatility of flammable or combustible liquids is increased by heat, and when 
heated to temperatures higher than their flashpoints they present a greater hazard. 
In addition, some flammable and combustible liquids are highly reactive with 
other substances, subject to explosive decomposition, or may have other 
properties that dictate extra safeguards. Consult your local ground safety and (or) 
BE or fire protection staff when in doubt. For spills and leaks, follow local spill 
and containment control protocols. Spills of flammable or combustible liquids 
should be cleaned up promptly. With major spills, remove ignition sources, 
evacuate, and ventilate the area, and provide appropriate PPE to the cleanup crew. 
Flammable or combustible liquids should not be allowed to enter a confined 
space, such as a sewer, because of the possibility of an explosion. 
 
2.2.7. Fugitive Dust Hazards. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) refers 
to fugitive dust as “particulate matter that enters the air without first passing 
through a stack or duct designed to direct or control its flow.” Several CE 
operations that generate fugitive dust sources include roadway/airfield paving and 
patching, asphalt and concrete batch plant, earthmoving, mining and quarries, 
hauling and trucking, explosive demolition, and building construction. Fugitive 
dust from these operations could cause both respiratory issues (especially to 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
23 
 
 
sensitive individuals) and visual impairment issues. In addition to wearing PPE 
when practicable, consider consulting your local ground safety and BE offices for 
methods to control or mitigate the effects of fugitive dust hazards. For other 
mitigation options consider reviewing the EPA summary document on fugitive 
dust 
at 
https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-02/fugitive-dust-
control-best-practices.pdf. 
 
2.2.8. Animal and Insect Hazards. Live animals and insects can be just as 
dangerous as the effects of dead animals during floods. Animals, reptiles, and 
insects often take refuge in damaged buildings. Snakes and venomous insects can 
be especially problematic in coastal areas affected by floods and hurricanes. 
 
2.2.9. Asbestos and Lead Hazards. Exposure to asbestos, lead fibers, and lead dust 
can be a problem, especially when an explosion or windstorm has damaged the 
work area. Flying debris or blast waves can expose enclosed areas of buildings 
where previously concealed and brittle asbestos reside. Formerly encapsulated 
asbestos shingles, wallboard, plaster, insulation, or stucco can fracture and 
disperse asbestos fibers. Base control and removal efforts may limit exposure to 
asbestos on the installation, but off-base facilities may present serious exposure 
problems. Workers should immediately notify BE if asbestos or lead hazards are 
suspected or confirmed. If confirmed, BE can provide specific respiratory 
protection and protective clothing requirements. At locations or job sites where 
BE nor occupational or environmental health personnel are readily available, 
supervisors should contact the supporting medical facility or the next higher 
headquarters for assistance and guidance. 
 
2.3. Debris Clearing. When clearing debris from work areas and facilities, 
provide enough room around the facility for access by high-reach trucks, cranes, 
ladders, or for required scaffolding during the repair. Remove or completely 
isolate utility and communication lines (i.e., telephone and fiber optic) from the 
work area. Hot power lines may contact and energize wires, cable, metal fences, 
pipes, and roofs causing electrocution. At times, it is safer to remove damaged 
building parts when it is extremely dangerous to repair the component. This is 
often the case with heavy hangar doors when dislodged from their tracks after an 
explosion or windstorm. Doors of this type normally require special equipment 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
24 
 
 
and training to allow recovery or repair. Large doors or smaller hangar door 
sections may be valuable as temporary replacement wall sections if equipment is 
available to move them safely. Always clear out hazardous materials and debris, 
especially wet debris. If workers cannot make immediate repairs to walls and 
roofs using plywood, protect the area with tarps and/or plastic sheeting. Keep in 
mind that little adjustments can make the job much more manageable. 
 
2.3.1. Debris Removal Priorities. The priorities for debris removal will vary 
depending on base mission and type of disaster. The Emergency Operations 
Center (EOC), Incident Commander, and CE UCC assigns debris removal 
priorities. In the instance where damage is limited to a military complex, debris 
removal personnel should expect the EOC to assign the highest priorities to those 
areas most critical to the mission. 
 
2.3.2. Debris Removal Resources. As might be anticipated, the type of equipment 
required to clear an area depends on the size and amount of debris. For example, 
large pieces of wreckage will necessitate the use of heavy equipment such as 
loaders and cranes (Figure 2.1). These and other heavy equipment can be 
effective in debris clearance operations. If equipment is scarce, consider using 
hand tools to clear areas with large amounts of smaller-sized debris. 
 
Figure 2.1. Debris Removal Using Heavy Equipment. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
25 
 
 
2.3.2.1. Crane. For removing extremely large chunks of debris, a crane may be 
the only suitable piece of equipment. A crane can clear destruction on upper floors 
of a structure beyond the reach of an excavator or front-end loader. Note: Cranes 
may not be available at some locations. 
 
2.3.2.2. Bulldozer. A bulldozer has the power to push large pieces of debris out 
of an area and can quickly clear large areas of smaller debris. One skilled dozer 
operator can clear an area that would require several hours of labor if done by 
hand. However, bulldozers may be in short supply if runway repair is required. 
 
2.3.2.3. Front-End Loader. Front-end loaders are especially useful in loading 
debris on dump trucks and other vehicles for removal from the site. They also are 
adequate for clearing paved areas and streets of large amounts of small debris. 
 
2.3.2.4. Dump Truck. Dump trucks haul debris to disposal sites; however, after 
an attack, they may be essential during airfield damage repair, and only be 
available in limited numbers for debris removal. If necessary, consider using other 
suitable vehicles, such as cargo trucks and tractor-trailer units, to haul debris. 
 
2.3.2.5. Sweepers. After removing the larger debris, use street sweepers to clear 
smaller items from aircraft operating surfaces and primary access streets. If 
sweepers are not used, small metal items left on roadways and working areas can 
cause tire damage to equipment used in cleanup operations. Time spent repairing 
and replacing flat tires on these vehicles can delay the overall recovery effort. 
 
2.3.2.6. Towing Devices. Steel cable, chains, hooks, and similar items can be 
fashioned into towing devices for debris removal. 
 
2.3.2.7. Hand Tools. Various hand tools are useful in debris clearance. Workers 
can use chainsaws and axes to cut fallen trees into smaller sections for easier 
removal. Shovels are useful in loading smaller debris on vehicles for transport to 
a disposal site. Use brooms and rakes to clear surface areas of scattered debris. 
 
2.3.2.8. Manpower. The amount of labor required to clear an area of debris will 
depend upon the availability of the laborsaving equipment discussed in the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
26 
 
 
previous paragraphs. If mechanical equipment is available, the unit will need 
fewer workers for cleanup. However, personnel assigned to cleanup detail must 
be skilled in operating the equipment. Less equipment means a greater number of 
persons required, but their skill levels need not be as high. 
 
2.3.2.9. During recovery operations on a military installation, likely, the EOC will 
task other installation agencies, whose attack recovery missions may not be 
critical to aircraft generation, to supply augmentees for debris removal efforts. In 
such instances, CE personnel will have to supervise these individuals during 
debris removal activities and provide them with necessary tools and protective 
gear. These augmentees may not be cognizant of the dangers involved with debris 
removal nor be trained in explosive ordnance reconnaissance; therefore, consider 
these limitations when assigning their tasks. 
 
2.3.3. Debris Removal Operations. Available equipment and labor usually dictate 
the extent of debris removal. Immediately following a disaster or enemy attack, 
the EOC or Incident Commander makes decisions regarding how debris removal 
operations should proceed. Often, debris remains in nonessential areas until 
additional resources become available, unless it hampers recovery operations or 
presents a safety hazard. Personnel should be assigned debris clearance tasks and 
allocated required equipment on a priority basis. 
 
2.3.3.1. Preparations. This step consists of establishing debris removal crews, 
positioning equipment for removal activities, attaching cables and other devices 
to large pieces of debris, breaking or cutting up larger debris pieces for ease of 
removal, and similar actions. Any debris salvageable for recovery operations 
should be set aside. 
 
2.3.3.2. Removal and Disposal. Under certain circumstances, operators may bury 
the debris by pushing it into craters or prepared holes. When not burying the debris 
or otherwise disposing of it at the scene of destruction, move it to a central location 
where it can be loaded into dump trucks or other vehicles for transport to a remote 
location for burial or burning. Consult the local installation management flight 
before establishing any landfill or debris-burning operation.

Chapter 3 
 
STRUCTURAL SHORING 
 
3.1. Introduction. Immediately after an attack or natural disaster, there may not 
be time to make a detailed engineering analysis on structural soundness of 
damaged facilities. During an emergency, structural engineers may instead rely 
on field experience, facility appearance, common sense, and instinct. If a facility 
appears beyond repair, demolition is probably in order. Conversely, when 
resolved to "save" a damaged facility, several expedient repair options are usually 
available. Once crews remove debris and assure safe access, the first concern 
before starting structural repairs may be to shore up and stabilize any weakened 
areas to restore a minimum degree of structural integrity to the facility. Most 
expedient shoring requires common engineering materials readily available on 
base or from off-base vendors. Examples include lateral shoring (guying and 
bracing), vertical shoring, and horizontal shoring. Stabilization of concrete 
columns, beams, and slabs may include the use of splinting, tension ties, welding, 
and stitching dogs. This section addresses these options. Some of the structural 
shoring construction methods illustrated in this chapter were adapted from the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Field Guide for Building Stabilization 
and Shoring Techniques, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) 
Structures Specialist, Field Operations Guide. Work crews should consult with 
the Engineering Flight for specific shoring design requirements and procedures 
when addressing structural instability of collapsed and damaged buildings. 
 
3.2. Lateral Shoring. Damaged and collapsed buildings often contain both lateral 
and vertical instability. Generally, we use bracing, guying, and shoring to stabilize 
a facility from lateral movement, keeping it from moving side to side. 
 
3.2.1. Guying. Guywires are usually fashioned from wire rope and tensioned by 
turnbuckles, if available. We commonly see guywires providing stabilizing 
support for power poles and tall antennas. Engineer work crews normally install 
them to function in opposing pairs to provide lateral restraint from such forces as 
wind or ice loading. They are particularly effective when damage occurs to end 
walls or sidewalls, yet roof members have been essentially untouched. Depending 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
28 
 
 
upon the situation, crews can install guywires either inside or outside a facility. 
The number of pairs required will depend on the situation at hand, based upon the 
size of the facility requiring shoring and extent of damage sustained. 
 
3.2.1.1. Although several different wire rope fittings are available commercially, 
by far the most common means of attachment of guywires is the use of wire rope 
clips (Figure 3.1). When properly installed, clips can provide up to 80 percent of 
the rope’s strength. The size of the wire rope dictates the number of clips used and 
their spacing. A good rule of thumb is to use a minimum of three clips spaced 
about 3-3/4 inches apart for 1/2- or 5/8-inch rope, and four clips spaced 4-1/2 
inches apart for 3/4- or 7/8-inch rope. These standard practices prevent kinking of 
the rope and fraying of the cable due to friction when connected to a turnbuckle 
or other attachment. Also, note how the clips attach to the rope. The bend of the 
U-bolt compresses the dead end of the rope, whereas the clip compresses the live 
end of the rope. The live end of the rope leads back to the structure the crew is 
guying. See Figure 3.2 for assembly instructions. 
 
Figure 3.1. Wire Rope and Clips. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
29 
 
 
Figure 3.2. Wire Rope Clip Assembly. 
 
 
 
3.2.1.2. Illustrated in Figure 3.3 is a typical guywire connection to a structure. 
The wire rope attaches to a turnbuckle that attaches to the building. This example 
shows a connection to a steel beam using a beam clip. A beam clip is merely a C-
shaped connector that workers can fabricate in the shop, if necessary. Other 
connections to a structure are possible using eyebolts and even wrapping the rope 
around the structural member the workers are stabilizing. Note the use of the 
2"x4" board as a brace to prevent the guywire from twisting when crews tighten 
the turnbuckle. If an external guywire is to be used, one end of the guywire must 
be connected to a solid, immovable object, commonly referred to as a “deadman.” 
The deadman can be a nearby foundation, another part of the structure to be guyed, 
screw-anchors similar to what linemen use for pole guying, or even a piece of 
unserviceable equipment, provided it is heavy enough.

30 
 
 
Figure 3.3. Typical Guy Wire Connection to a Structure. 
 
 
 
3.2.1.3. As mentioned earlier, work crews can install guywires either internally or 
externally. Figure 3.4 illustrates an internal configuration. Always tighten 
guywires in pairs and concurrently, to avoid placing too much stress on the 
structure’s frame at any particular point. However, use caution to prevent over 
tightening; the intent is to take all the sag out of the wire ropes. 
 
Figure 3.4. Internal Guy System. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
31 
 
 
3.2.1.4. Work crews also install and configure external guywires in pairs (see 
Figure 3.5). The major difference is instead of using the structure itself as the 
endpoints for the guywires, external anchors or deadmen are used. The 
stabilization effect is essentially the same. 
 
Figure 3.5. External Guy System. 
 
 
 
3.2.2. Bracing. Braces are a type of lateral (diagonal) shoring with compression 
members usually made of structural steel and heavy timbers (Figure 3.6). Similar 
to guywires, their installation is either internally or externally. Depending upon 
the situation, crews can place them in opposite pairs or use them individually. 
Regardless of the method used, ensure brace(s) adequately connects to the 
structure. If not well attached, the probability that the bracing will slide out of 
position is great, risking further facility damage or collapse. Footings for bracing 
require the same attention; they must be of sufficient mass so they will not move 
when force is applied. Do not expect a brace that is just shoved into the ground to 
hold. If necessary, build an expedient footing out of rubble, heavy metal, or timber 
if another part of the structure’s foundation or the foundation of an adjacent 
building is not available. 
 
3.2.2.1. In most cases, work crews will install braces in pairs. Figure 3.7 shows 
externally opposed braces. Like guywires, more than one pair of braces may be 
required. This will be an on-site decision, generally driven by the size of the 
building requiring shoring and severity of damage incurred.

3.2.3. Raker Shoring. Raker shores help to stabilize leaning or damaged walls. 
There are three types of Raker shores (Figure 3.9), Flying, Solid Sole, and Split 
Sole. The Flying Raker is a temporary spot Raker used when a debris pile is next 
to the base of the wall needing shoring. The Solid Sole Raker is a “full triangle” 
shore and the most desirable Raker; normally built in groups of two or more. The 
Split Sole Raker is an option when there is a limited amount of soil or debris next 
to the wall (Figure 3.10).

3.3. Vertical Shoring. Sometimes, the structural integrity of a facility may be in 
jeopardy due to damaged structural members directly affected by vertical loads—
in other words, the effects of gravity. In such situations, there may be deflected or 
cracked beams/girders that need vertical support, or damaged columns that will 
eventually need replacement. See paragraph 4.2.2 for more information on roof 
shoring techniques. Shoring jacks and constructed wood shoring systems 
addressed below provide expedient solutions for vertical instability, however, 
engineers may later add some lateral bracing for stability. Basic preliminary steps 
for using vertical shoring may include: 
 
• 
Removing debris and floor covering. 
• 
If soil supported, using 18”x18” footing under shoring post locations. 
• 
Installing temporary shores to reduce risk (T Spot or Double T). 
• 
Prefabricating shoring as much as possible to reduce risk further. 
• 
Adding bracing after tightening shoring wedges. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023

3.3.1. Jacks. Shoring jacks (also called shores) are placed immediately under the 
point of deflection, or adjacent to the damaged column, and extended until they 
are firmly wedged into position (Figure 3.11). Use base and top plates to 
distribute the compressive forces so as not to further deteriorate either floor or 
roof, which may happen if large force is placed in a small area, i.e., punching 
shear. Clear away any debris around the base of the jacks so the jacks remain 
positioned level on the facility floor. While not shown in the illustration, it is also 
advisable to brace the jacks once they are in position. One option to prevent 
accidental movement is to create bracing (using metal and lumber materials) and 
attached it to the jacks and floor. Use bolts, epoxy, or other fasteners to secure the 
bracing to the floor. 
 
Figure 3.11. Shoring Jack Installation. 
 
 
 
3.3.1.1. In most cases, shoring jacks will be in short supply and too valuable to 
leave in damaged facilities. As illustrated in Figure 3.12, an alternative to leaving 
the jacks is using timbers as supporting members. The procedures for installing 
timbers are similar to jacks but are somewhat more worker intensive. 
 
3.3.1.2. Begin by clearing debris from the work area and place a shoring jack 
immediately adjacent to the location where the timber is going to go. Then raise 
the jack until it reaches the desired height or can no longer be extended. Measure 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
36 
 
 
the distance from the top of the jack to the floor and cut the timber 1/2-inch shorter 
than the measurement. Once cut, raise the timber into position and pound several 
wedges into the 1/2-inch gap between the top of the timber and the damaged beam; 
this secures the timber into position. Then lower and remove the shoring jack. The 
final step is to brace the timber in two directions, similar to that done earlier with 
nails and 2"x4" stock. 
 
Figure 3.12. Timber Column Brace. 
 
 
 
3.3.2. Constructed Wood Shoring Systems. Wood and timber are common options 
to shore damaged structural components because of their availability and 
economy. Work crews use a variety of elements, ranging from tree logs, sawed 
timbers, and utility poles, to industrially made items with different cross sections, 
such as planks, boards, and beams. One final note concerning the use of timbers; 
if heavy timbers are not readily available, consider potential options. Other 
facilities damaged beyond repair may contain salvageable timbers. Also, consider 
nailing, gluing, bolting, or banding 2"x8" or 2"x10" stock together to form usable 
substitutes. The focus of this section is on constructing temporary vertical shoring 
elements from lumber materials. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023

3.3.2.1. Design Basics. The strength of constructed wood systems depends on the 
following: 
 
• 
Perpendicular to grain bearing of the Post on the Header. 
• 
Vertical capacity of Posts (based on height or length). 
• 
Strength of Header and Sole. 
• 
Strength of ground or floor slab below the Sole. 
 
3.3.2.1.1. Using 4”x4” and 6”x6” headers is desirable since this maintains a 
relatively stable 1 to 1 height to width ratio. This allows the use of 1-sided 
connections to headers. Using 4”x4” headers for 4’ on center (o.c.) posts and 
6”x6” headers for 5’ o.c. posts is for supporting normal wood floors and intact 
concrete floors. For badly cracked concrete floors, and shores with larger post 
spacing, contact the Engineering Flight for specific design requirements. 
 
3.3.2.1.2. Consider using backing (2”x10” or 2”x12” full length, centered on top 
of the header, or 8’ long strips of 12” to 16” wide, 3/4” plywood) above headers 
if one is supporting a badly cracked concrete or masonry structure. Use backing 
under the sole at each post when bearing on soil. Use 3-2”x6”x18” (Figure 3.13) 
or 2-layers of 18”x18”x3/4” plywood centered under posts. 
 
3.3.2.1.3. It is desirable to use 2-sided connections at posts to sole plates at wedges 
to confine the wedges. The connectors should be 6”x12” half gussets. Cut gussets 
from 5/8” or 3/4” plywood (or may use Oriented Strand Board [OSB], only where 
wet conditions will not occur). 
 
3.3.2.1.4. Construct plywood gussets as shown in Figure 3.14 (Full Gussets) and 
Figure 3.15 (Half and Double Gussets). Use 8d nails for gusset construction. For 
wood or light metal floor/roof systems, consider using 1-sided connections at 
wedges in situations where lateral displacement of the shore is unlikely. Note: 
Displacement may result from lateral loads, vibrations, and structural shifting. 
 
3.3.2.1.5. Construct plywood braces for plywood laced posts (PLP) as illustrated 
in Figure 3.16. Use 8d nails in each end. Note: Bracing between the vertical 
timbers is a common construction technique that increases the efficiency of the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
38 
 
 
timber shoring by limiting lateral movement and reducing the potential for 
buckling under any increases in load.

3.3.2.1.6. As illustrated in Figure 3.17, when nailing connections for 2”x6” and 
2”x4” braces to posts, consider using 16d coated nails (0.148” x 3.25”) to reduce 
splitting. Also, try to place nails away from the ends of 2”x4”s and 2”x6”s. 
 
3.3.2.1.7. When nailing 2”x6” and 2”x4” diagonal braces to headers (Figure 3.18 
and Figure 3.19), the braces connect the post to the header and provide bracing. 
Carefully place the diagonal brace so required nails can be driven without splitting 
the post. For conditions where 5-16d nails will split the post, 3-16d nails may be 
used. 
 
3.3.2.1.8. When building vertical shoring, the nails connect wooden members 
together, but they should not transfer direct loads. Use either hand or gun-driven 
nailing methods; however, gun-driven nails normally produce less impact 
vibration. Full head nails are best, but the head is set off-center for most nail guns. 
Clip head nails are also an option but be careful not to over-drive the nails. Do not 
use wedge cut nails. The preferred 16d nail is a 0.148”x3.25” coated nail. Standard 
16d nails are 0.162”x3.5” and tend to split the wood. Consider using duplex nails 
on the wedges, so you can easily pull the nails when adjusting the wedges. Figure 
3.20 illustrates standard nailing patterns for shoring construction.

3.3.2.2. T Spot Shore. The T Spot shore is a rapidly installed temporary shore for 
use only until a complete shoring system can be installed. It can become unstable 
if it is not centered under the load. Using the wooden materials listed in Table 
3.1; build the T Spot shore (Figure 3.21) according to procedures below: 
 
3.3.2.2.1. Determine where to build the T Spot shores to reduce risk quickly (prior 
to building more stable shores). 
 
3.3.2.2.2. Determine the height of the area to shore; remove the least amount of 
debris required to place shore. 
 
3.3.2.2.3. Measure and cut the 4”x4” header and sole to 3 feet. 
 
3.3.2.2.4. Cut the post to proper height (max length 10’3”) so that the total height 
of the shore is not more than 11’, after adding the 4”x4” header (3.5”), 4”x4” sole 
(3.5”), and 2”x4” wedge height (2”).

• 
Place and nail Full Gusset plate on one side. 
• 
Flip shore over and place/nail another full gusset on the other side. 
 
3.3.2.2.6. Place T Shore in position, centered under the load. 
 
3.3.2.2.7. Position header across (perpendicular to) the roof/floor joists and 
position the post directly under a joist. 
 
3.3.2.2.8. Slide sole plate under T and tap wedges into position. Check for 
straightness and position directly under the load, and then tighten the wedges. 
 
3.3.2.2.9. Install bottom half gusset; nail 4-8d nails to post and sole. Note: A 
2”x4”x18” cleat may be used, but the 3-16d nails to post and to sole may tend to 
split the cleat. In addition, the nailing of 16d causes more impact within the danger 
zone than for 8d nails. 
 
3.3.2.2.10. Anchor the shore to the floor above and sole to floor below, if practical. 
 
3.3.2.3. Double T Shore. The Double T shore is the most stable spot shore, and 
more preferred to the marginally stable T Spot shore. Using the wooden materials 
listed in Table 3.2; build the Double T shore (Figure 3.22) according to 
procedures below: 
 
3.3.2.3.1. Determine overall height of the area to shore and remove the least 
amount of debris required to place the shore. 
 
3.3.2.3.2. Measure and cut the 4”x4” header and sole to 3’ long. 
 
3.3.2.3.3. Cut the 4”x4” post to proper height (max length 11’3”) so the total 
height of the shore is not more than 12’, after adding 4”x4” header (3.5”), 4”x4” 
sole (3.5”), and 2”x4” wedge height.

precede the erection of this shore. Using the wooden materials listed in Table 3.3; 
build the 4-Post Vertical shore (Figure 3.23) according to the following 
procedures. Note: Crews may adjust procedures for either three or five posts. 
 
3.3.2.4.1. Survey, install spot shores (if needed), and remove the least amount of 
debris required to place the shore. 
 
3.3.2.4.2. Lay the sole plate on the floor or ground directly under and in line where 
installing the header. The sole plate should be as level as possible.

3.3.2.4.3. Measure and cut the posts to the proper height: 
 
• 
Place the header on top of the sole plate. 
• 
Place the end of the tape measure on top of the header at both ends and 
at its middle, to find the distances to the bottom of the structure needing 
shoring. 
• 
After deducting for wedges, use the smallest dimension for all posts 
(assumes near-level conditions).

them together simultaneously until the posts are tight. Nail behind the wedges to 
secure them. 
 
3.3.2.4.7. Attach the diagonal braces to each side of the vertical shore. 
 
• 
Install mid-point brace prior to the diagonal braces, when needed. 
• 
Diagonal braces should be long enough to span its entire length and 
attached to the sole plate and header and each post. 
• 
If possible, installed diagonal braces should be in a "X" pattern on 
opposite sides of the system. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023

• 
Very long vertical shoring systems may require several sets of diagonal 
braces. 
 
3.3.2.4.8. Attach half gussets to one side of header to post, except where diagonal 
braces attach. Add Half Gussets to each side of each post to sole plate, except 
where diagonal braces attach (then only one side). Nail with 8-8d nails. 
 
3.3.2.5. Door and Window Shores. Use door and window shores in unreinforced 
masonry buildings to support loose masonry over openings. The shores may also 
be usable in other building types with damaged door or window headers. Build 
shores using the wooden materials listed in Table 3.4 and according to the 
following procedures. Figure 3.24 illustrates basic shore design with open access 
for doors or windows. Note: If not using door or window opening for access or 
egress, consider reinforcing the shore with diagonal bracing. 
 
3.3.2.5.1. Survey, remove finishes (if required), and remove debris. 
 
3.3.2.5.2. Measure and cut the sole plate and header to the proper length, 
deducting the width of the wedges used. Make the header 1” deep for every foot 
of opening; 4”x4” minimum. Design headers for openings over four feet. 
 
3.3.2.5.3. Measure and cut the posts to the proper height. 
 
• 
Place the header on top of the sole plate. 
• 
To determine post height, place the end of the tape measure on top of the 
header where installing the posts, slide the tape up to the bottom of the 
structural element to be shored, deducting the thickness of the wedges to 
be used. (Use the shorter of the two measurements). 
 
3.3.2.5.4. Install the sole with a set of wedges at one end and tap them together 
simultaneously until the sole is tight. The sole should be as level as possible: use 
shims as necessary under the sole plate.

3.3.2.5.6. Install the posts between the header and sole, and against the sides of 
the opening. Install the first post under the wedge side of the header to prevent 
movement if the header wedges loosen. 
 
3.3.2.5.7. Keep posts in line and plumb with header and sole. 
 
3.3.2.5.8. Install a wedge set under each post, on top of the sole. Tighten the 
wedges to lock shore in place. 
 
3.3.2.5.9. Attach cleat and half gusset to at least one side of the header and posts 
(as shown) and nail in place. 
 
3.3.2.5.10. Confine the wedges by placing a cleat against the inside face of each 
post at the bottom and nail them in place with 3-16d nails to each post and 2-16d 
toenails to the sole. Note: May use duplex nails for future adjustments of the 
wedges.

3.3.2.6. Cribbing. Cribbing is an easily adjustable shore for height and width 
dimensions. Height must be limited because of a large amount of deflection due 
to crushing, especially when different crushing rates occur at different bearings. 
The materials used depends on the height, number of pieces per layer, and the 
height of each piece. The recommended maximum height for systems using 4x4s 
is 4 feet, and for 6x6s is 6 feet. Build the cribbing as illustrated in Figure 3.25 
and according to procedures below. Table 3.5 lists cribbing design loads. 
 
3.3.2.6.1. Determine where to build cribbing to reduce risk quickly. 
 
3.3.2.6.2. Determine overall height of the area to be shored and remove least 
amount of debris required to place shore.

3.3.2.6.3. Determine the desired width dimensions of the crib; the size of the 
members required; and the configuration of the crib layers. 
• 
Use 6”x6” members if crib needs to be more than 4 ft. high. 
• 
Note that the 3-member x 3-member configuration is more than 2 times 
as strong as 2-member x 2-member. 
 
Figure 3.25. Cribbing. 
 
 
 
3.3.2.6.4. Decide if the first layer needs to be a solid layer, depending on the type 
of bearing material (soil or other surface softer than a concrete slab). If the 
supporting surface is concrete, make sure that it has the required stiffness and 
capacity, and there is not a basement story below.

3.3.2.6.6. When the crib reaches required height, add shims to make sure that all 
intersections of crib members are in solid contact with the supported structure. 
 
3.3.2.6.7. Attach the crib to the supporting surface (or confine its movement), if 
practical. 
 
3.3.2.6.8. Where vibration and aftershocks may occur, interconnect the crib layers 
with 3/8” min x 16” long plywood strips that are 1.5 times as high as the cribbing 
members are (Figure 3.26). 
 
• 
The plywood strips need to be placed on all 4 sides of the crib. 
• 
Nail plywood strips at top and bottom edges to crib members with 8d at 
3 inches on center.

3.4. Horizontal Shoring. Use horizontal shores to stabilize damaged, parallel 
vertical walls, especially walls that are bulging. The shores may be designed to 
permit access or for non-access. Fabricate horizontal shores as illustrated in 
Figure 3.27 and Figure 3.28, and according to following procedures. 
 
3.4.1. Measure and cut the wall plates and struts (4”x4” or 6”x6”) to the proper 
length. The maximum shore width for 4”x4” struts is 10 feet; for 6”x6” struts, 16 
feet. Measure between the wall plates where the struts are to be installed, 
deducting the width of the wedges. 
 
3.4.2. Place both wall plates next to each other and attach cleats and single 4x 
wedges to the wall plates just below where the struts will be installed. If 4x wedge 
is not available, use 2x wedge on top of a 2x cleat; nail with 5-16d nails. 
 
3.4.3. Place the wall plates in the area that is to be shored, square and in line with 
each other and as plumb as possible by shimming any void spaces behind the wall 
plates. Install the struts between the wall plates. Keep the struts in line and plumb 
with the wall plates. Space 4”x4” struts a maximum 4 feet o.c.; for 6”x6” struts, a 
maximum 5 feet o.c.

3.4.4. Install a set of wedges horizontally between the wall plate and each strut 
and tap them together simultaneously until the struts are tight. Toenail the wedges 
from top into wall plate. Consider using duplex nails for future adjustment. Add 
2”x4”x18” cleat from wall plate to strut (on top if possible) to secure wedges and 
strut. Use 3-16d nails on each end. At non-wedge end of the strut, place half gusset 
on one side. If possible, attach the wall plates to the walls. 
 
3.4.5. Attach the diagonal braces to each side of the horizontal shore if not used 
for access or egress. The diagonal braces should be long enough to span the entire 
length and attach to both wall plates and each strut. When used, install diagonal 
braces in a "X" pattern on opposite sides of struts. Use 5-16d nails on each end.

3.5. Splinting. Splinting is a method of enhancing the structural integrity of 
columns, particularly the reinforced concrete type, that have not been seriously 
damaged but show signs of cracking or minor fracturing. Using steel and iron 
components to reinforce, strengthen, and delay further degradation of damaged 
concrete columns is a common engineering practice. The techniques below 
describe how steel plates, strapping, angle iron, and wound wire/cables are used 
for this purpose. 
 
3.5.1. One technique involves "sandwiching" the damaged column between two 
steel plates connected by threaded rods. The plates have slotted holes so they can 
fit various sized columns (Figure 3.29). In this repair, splints are set around the 
column at the location of the crack(s) to provide a lateral restraining force (Figure 
3.30). If cracks are at several locations on the column, consider using multiple 
splints. This repair is preferable to column replacement when a damaged column 
is still capable of carrying a significant load, because it requires less workers and 
is a faster repair (under good conditions, between 5 and 15 minutes). However, 
for severely damaged columns appearing near the point of collapse, column 
replacement using jacks or timber supports may be the better option.

58 
 
 
3.5.2. A second splinting technique involves placing angle iron at the corners of 
a damaged column and connecting the angles with steel straps (Figure 3.31). Use 
steel plates at the ends of the angles to avoid load-bearing problems at the bottom 
of the column where it attaches to the slab. A third method of splinting again uses 
angle iron at the corners of the damaged columns but uses wire rope or similar 
cabling to connect the angle irons together (Figure 3.32). Weld one end of the 
wire rope to the top of one of the angles, and tightly wind the rope around the 
column. Weld the other end of the wire rope to one of the angles at the base of the 
column. Additional welds may be necessary at various points to secure the cable 
to the angle iron. Note: The required size and thickness of the angle iron, steel 
straps, wire rope, etc., can vary depending on the degree of damage to the column 
and potential for further degradation. While angle iron that is 1/4” thick with 4” 
to 4.5” legs may be sufficient for concrete columns with minor cracks and 
fractures, structural engineers can determine specific requirements for this and 
other reinforcing materials.

3.6. Tension Ties. Some facilities at overseas locations are essentially all 
reinforced concrete construction. In such cases, slabs and beams will be of unitary 
construction, meaning that they are formed, reinforced, and poured as a single 
unit. After an attack or natural disaster, some of the slabs and beams may develop 
minor cracking. Tension ties are a method of providing a compressive force on 
the slabs and beams that aids in the prevention of further cracking (Figure 3.33). 
For slab repair, anchor a threaded rod to the beams on both sides of the cracked 
area of the slab. For beams, bolt anchor plates to the beam on both sides of the 
crack and place a threaded rod parallel to the beam, connecting the two anchor 
plates. Tightening the nuts on the threaded rod induces a compressive force into 
the beam or slab, thereby restricting further cracking. Note: Structural engineers 
can determine specific size requirements for threaded rods and anchor plates.

3.7. Stitching Dogs. Yet another method of restoring structural integrity into a 
cracked concrete slab is the use of "stitching dogs." These dogs are steel bars, 
normally rebar, formed into a U-shape and set over the crack, rather like staples, 
as shown in Figure 3.34. The dogs should be of random length and variably 
spaced along the crack. To ensure a tight fit, well grout the holes after inserting 
the stitching dogs.

3.8. Welding. Welding steel sections back into place to restore the stability of a 
steel framework is a common shoring method. Welding repairs will usually be 
limited to a relatively small section of a facility. To attempt more than this as an 
expedient repair will take too much time and effort. For the most part, such repairs 
will involve erecting scaffolding, positioning steel plate and structural shapes, and 
accomplishing the welding.

Chapter 4 
 
STRUCTURAL REPAIRS 
 
4.1. Introduction. Emergency building repairs after a wartime or terrorist attack 
are generally limited in scope and considered adequate when they allow mission-
critical functions to continue. For peacetime emergencies, the type and extent of 
the disaster will dictate, to a large degree, the type and extent of the repairs and 
recovery response. Military installations and surrounding communities may 
experience tornados, hurricanes, fires, floods, or even the effects of a volcano. 
The potential devastation from these threats reinforces the necessity that CE 
personnel possess the skill sets to make expedient repairs to facilities and 
equipment damaged by hostile action or disasters. This chapter presents common 
techniques for making expedient and emergency repairs to damaged structures, 
and miscellaneous wooden joint construction. The information and illustrations 
shown present notional repair options from Army Technical Manual 5-620, 
Facilities Engineering Maintenance and Repair of Architectural and Structural 
Elements of Buildings and Structures, and does not replace applicable Air Force, 
theater, or International Building Code repair standards. 
 
4.2. Roof Repairs. It is important to recognize that some roofs and support 
systems perform various functions. While some are simply a weather cover, others 
act as part of a structural frame or diaphragm. When repairing a damaged roof 
structure, initial efforts must focus on safety. Ensure that bracing and shoring are 
adequate as addressed in the previous section; take additional steps to protect 
personnel and essential equipment from the elements. Local climate and 
prevailing weather are major factors. If the weather is warm and rainfall is not a 
detrimental factor, some openings may be left exposed temporarily without 
significant impact. However, if patching is required, consider the various 
materials and expedient repair options covered later in the chapter. Before starting 
any repairs, assess roof damage and brace or shore up any damaged beams or 
trusses, which may be unsupported due to the damaged roof, using expedient 
structural shoring methods in paragraph 4.2.2. Additionally, see paragraph 4.5 
for information on constructing wooden joints and splices. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
63 
 
 
4.2.1. Assess Roof Damage. Analyze failed sections and holes in the roof to 
determine the need for emergency repair. Inspect both the top and bottom portions 
of the roof to make sure that the areas are sound. Be aware that even though roof 
structural members and the deck are intact, emergency repairs may still be 
necessary. One example is that even after hurricane winds subside, persistent rains 
can cause severe damage or building collapse. Some roof covers have insulation 
boards, and high winds can leave the decking intact but blow off felts and expose 
insulation boards; and some insulation boards soak up rain like a sponge. The 
additional dead load from the water-soaked insulation, and ponding of trapped 
water, can collapse structures, especially warehouses and large hangars. 
 
4.2.1.1. Rafters, beams, trusses and other roof framing should be easy to check 
because they are usually uncovered and accessible on the roof’s underside, and 
therefore defects and damage should be visible. Damage assessments and periodic 
checks should identify areas where remedial action is necessary to repair or 
replace trusses and prevent roof failure. 
 
4.2.1.2. Inspect roof framing from ground level to determine if there is obvious 
failure that would make an inspection from inside the roof framing itself unsafe. 
If unsafe, first take precautions to mitigate risk, then use a ladder or lift machine 
for close-up inspections. 
 
4.2.1.3. Check framing members for noticeable bowing, warping, or vertical 
sagging that could lead to failure. Bowing could indicate an overloaded 
compression member; however, harmless warping may occur in an unloaded 
redundant member. 
 
4.2.1.4. Inspect framing members for ruptures or freshly exposed wood fibers, 
indicating the member experienced unusual loads. Look for evidence of leakage 
such as water stains, mold, or decay. 
 
4.2.1.5. Check framing members for splits and seasoning checks that could lead 
to failure. Seasoning checks and splits are normal reactions in most timber as it 
dries out. However, continued development of checks or splits toward line of bolts 
or through a bolt area or connector area may require corrective action. If records 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
64 
 
 
indicate increases in size, location, and depth of checks and splits, stitch bolts, 
yokes, or clamps may be used to prevent any further enlargement. Refer to 
paragraph 4.2.4.2.1 for repair options. 
 
4.2.1.6. Check truss members for proper construction and evidence of separation 
at joints. Loose or absent nuts can permit the timber members to separate and 
render the shear connectors less effective. Replace missing nuts and tighten all 
nuts to snugness without embedment into the wood. 
 
4.2.1.7. Check the condition of the roof framing. Be sure to examine the rafter-to-
plate connection. Look for evidence of movement of the rafter (spreading or 
slippage), or exterior wall movement (outward thrust). 
 
4.2.1.8. If the structure was exposed to fire, check fire-damaged wood structural 
members for structural integrity. Scrape the charred wood off the member in 
various sections to check the extent of damage. Fire-damaged wood can remain 
in place if it retains most of its structural integrity. The amount of remaining 
strength will depend on the extent of charring or exposure to high temperatures. 
There is no definitive, in-place test to determine if fire-damaged wood is still 
structurally sound. Engineering judgment is needed to decide which charred 
members can remain in place, be repaired, or replaced. As indicated in U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) General Technical Report FPL–GTR–234, 
Wood and Timber Condition Assessment Manual, some engineers choose to repair 
or remove lumber showing any signs of charring, while others elect to repair or 
remove only lumber that has lost over 10% of its cross section to charring or has 
a charring depth greater than 1/16", on the assumption it would not significantly 
reduce the lumber’s strength. In any case, engineers should consider the 
importance of the member to the structural integrity of the building and decide if 
a conservative approach is needed. For definitive results, an engineering test and 
analysis is normally required. 
 
4.2.2. Shoring Roof Trusses. After assessing the damage, it may be necessary to 
shore up trusses and roof framing to prevent collapse or to provide security while 
making repairs. Figure 4.1 through Figure 4.3 indicate proper locations and 
number of shores to support common flat trusses. If desired, place shores at all 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
65 
 
 
panel points. In shoring Warren-type trusses, it is advisable to place a temporary 
strut to prevent introducing serious secondary stresses in the truss members. Note: 
See paragraph 4.2.4.1 for a description of other common trusses. 
 
4.2.2.1. Shoring may be made of steel or seasoned timber. Place sufficient 
planking under shore jacks to distribute load on the floor. Raise the trusses slowly 
and carefully, jacking each shore in small increments one at a time. Otherwise, 
additional failures may occur due to secondary stresses and distortion, potentially 
damaging the roof membrane of the structure. Be sure to eliminate hazardous 
hanging materials (i.e., lights, wires, cable trays, mechanical ducts, etc.) below 
the roof and assess the extent of damage to the roof support system.

Figure 4.3. Shoring Warren Trusses. 
 
 
 
4.2.3. Weather Tightness. After ensuring the structural integrity, you can begin 
returning the weather tightness to the structure. From an expedient aspect, it will 
be difficult to seal off the building completely from weather, but you can keep out 
most of the ill effects of bad weather. Consider nailing sheets of plywood over the 
opening. Sheet metal, plastic sheeting, and canvas are options in lieu of plywood. 
Figure 4.4 show personnel using plastic sheeting as expedient roof protection on 
a housing unit after a hurricane damage. 
 
4.2.3.1. For flat roofs, consider fabricating sheets of plywood into a patch a bit 
larger than the hole and nail in place. If the roof is concrete, consider using bolts, 
epoxy, or other suitable fasteners to attach the plywood patch. Note: The repair 
sequence in Table 4.1 is an example how expedient weatherproofing and hole 
repair may proceed during a contingency. 
 
4.2.3.2. If available, nail rolled roofing to the patch for added weather protection. 
Once covering is in place, maintain positive drainage to divert rainwater and 
prevent ponding. This may involve stacking sandbags above the repair to divert 
the water or changing the slope at the repair itself. For larger areas, raise the center 
of the tarp or sheeting to divert water.

proper length; small hydraulic jacks can be used to push them 
back into place 
• 
Stretch plastic sheeting or a tarp over the hole and secure it to 
the roof deck; realize this is an intermediate step and if it starts 
to rain, the water may pond on the tarp/plastic and tear it  
•

perimeter 2”x4”s and toenail it to the roof decking 
• 
Cover the plywood with felt, plastic, tarp, or anything else that 
would make it water-resistant. Now, the temporary repair will 
be water-resistant and should not collapse under pressure 
 
4.2.4. Timber Roof Repairs. During contingencies, expedient repairs to timber 
roofs (framed or trussed) are often necessary when there is damage to sheathing, 
rafters, purlins, or other framing members. The following paragraphs provide a 
brief overview of timber roof structure, expedient repair options and procedures, 
and common repair tools and equipment. 
 
4.2.4.1. Structural Components. The primary components used in the framework 
of wooden roofs are lumber and metal fasteners. Framed roofs vary widely, from 
the simple lean-to type of flat roof to complex hipped and gabled roofs. Roof 
rafters are the structural members of a frame roof. Truss roofs have a structural 
framework of pitched, flat, or curved units used in place of rafters, for supporting 
loads over long spans. All roof framing, including rafters, trusses, roof beams, 
purlins and girders support roof loads in much the same way as joist beams and 
girders support floor loads. The notable difference is that pitched roofs must resist 
lateral forces such as those caused by wind. 
 
4.2.4.1.1. Rafters. Rafters are beams that slope from the roof ridge to the eaves 
making the main body of the roof. As illustrated in Figure 4.5, there are four types 
of rafters: common, hip, valley, and jack. Common rafters are framing members 
that extend at right angles from the plate line to the roof ridge. They are “common” 
to all types of roofs and are the basis for laying out other types of rafters. Hip 
rafters are roof members that extend diagonally from the corner of the plate to the 
ridge. Valley rafters extend from the plate to the ridge along the lines where two 
roofs intersect. Jack rafters may be a combination hip-jack (extends from plate to 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
69 
 
 
hip rafter), valley-jack (extends from the ridge to the valley rafter), or cripple jack 
(extends between the hip and valley rafters). 
 
Figure 4.5. Various Rafters and Details. 
 
 
 
4.2.4.1.2. Trusses. Trusses are the most common roof support in use today. Figure 
4.6 illustrates a few common types of trusses. Roof trusses can span large areas 
to give wide, unobstructed floor space for large buildings such as shops and 
hangars. Builders sometimes use trusses in small buildings to save material; they 
act as rafters and give the roof rigidity. The timber truss is a framed or jointed 
structure composed of connected wood members in various triangular 
configurations. The necessary number of subdivisions depend upon the length of 
the span and the type of construction. Over the years, construction innovations 
have changed the way most builders make and assemble timber trusses. 
Previously, many builders constructed heavy timber and double-chorded trusses 
and connected the members using bolts, glue, nails, screws, and plywood gussets. 
Today, common trusses are lightweight and single ply with pressed or stamped 
metal plate connectors joining the truss members together; expect to see all types 
when making repairs. See Table 4.2 for basic truss terms and descriptions. 
 
4.2.4.1.2.1. Flat Trusses. Most used for long spans, the flat-type Pratt trusses have 
spans up to 120 feet. Both the Pratt and Warren flat-type trusses, as well as the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
70 
 
 
Howe Truss, have relatively high stress in the web members in relation to the 
chord member stresses. 
 
4.2.4.1.2.2. Bowstring or Curved Trusses. Generally, bowstring trusses are in the 
smaller hangars, warehouses, and some recreational buildings. These trusses have 
relatively high chord stresses with the web members carrying proportionally 
lighter stress. The upper chords of bowstring trusses are generally of laminated 
construction. Failures occur more often in the chord members. However, this type 
of truss gives comparatively less maintenance trouble than other types.

4.2.4.1.2.3. Pitched Trusses. Pitched trusses of the Fink, Howe, Scissors, and 
related types are for shorter spans, usually 60 feet and under. They are common 
options in recreational, chapel subsistence, garage, barracks, and similar type 
structures. Figure 4.7 is an example of a contemporary, lightweight, single ply 
pitched truss.

4.2.4.2. Roof Framing Repair. Damage to roof framing may result from roof cover 
or sheathing damage; extreme roof loading; impact damage; poor construction or 
maintenance; or use of unseasoned or defective lumber during construction. 
Depending on the specific damage encountered, repair options could range from 
the use of scabs (short pieces of lumber used to splice or prevent movement of 
two other pieces), splices, gussets, metal plates, support braces, metal fasteners 
(bolts, screws, nails, etc.), adhesives, epoxy, and clamps, to complete timber 
replacement. The following paragraphs address some of the expedient repair 
options for damaged timber roof framing. 
4.2.4.2.1. Splits and Seasoning Checks. The standard practice of using unseasoned 
lumber for trusses invites splits (opening separating the wood, extending from one 
surface to the opposite surface or to an adjacent surface) and seasoning checks 
(separation of wood fibers by drying) that could lead to failure in roof framing. 
Potential remedies for such splitting include the installation of stitch bolts, yokes 
and clamps, or steel banding on truss members. 
 
4.2.4.2.1.1. Stitch Bolts. The stitch bolts prevent enlargement of splits and checks 
and further deterioration of the member. In truss members that have only one row 
of bolts, any split or check that occurs is normal and is not likely to be serious. 
However, if the split passes through the bolt holes and continues beyond into the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
73 
 
 
member, it requires attention. The recommended remedy for such splitting and 
checking is the installation of stitch bolts in the ends of each such member that 
has split. The bolts used for this purpose are 1/2-inch diameter bolts, threaded on 
both ends; 9/16 inch holes are drilled 2 to 4 inches from the end of the split 
member and perpendicular to the axis of the member. The bolt is then inserted 
and 2-inch, square-cut washers are place at each end. Install the stitch bolts before 
tightening the bolted connection. Do not attempt to completely close splits or 
checks because it could extend the split or check to the other side of the member.  
If the split is serious and continues well into the member, place a second stitch 
bolt on the opposite side of the connection about 6 to 12 inches from the ring 
connector. Figure 4.8 is an example of a stitch bolt repair used on a double-
chorded truss member. Exercise care in drilling stitch bolt holes so that holes are 
parallel to the face of the member. 
 
Figure 4.8. Stitch Bolt Repair on Truss Member. 
 
 
 
4.2.4.2.1.2. Yoke Angles and Clamps. Figure 4.9 illustrates the expedient repair 
of a minor split occurring at or near the joint of a truss chord member. Yoke angles 
or clamps are preferable in this case because stitch bolts would reduce the 
effective area of the chord member. Note the boring of a small hole immediately 
beyond the termination of the split. In some cases, when the split passes through 
the connection but does not pass too far up into the member, consider drilling a 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
74 
 
 
small hole through the thickness of the member at the end of the split to stop its 
progression. This hole should relieve any abnormal stresses at that point. Shown 
in Figure 4.10 are typical yoke and clamp details. 
 
4.2.4.2.1.3. Steel Banding. High strength steel banding such as that used to seal 
shipping cartons has proved effective in arresting the spread of splits. The bands 
should be of high tensile strength steel 1-1/4 inch wide and 0.035 inch thick. 
Apply the bands with a strapping tool (stretcher) that has no part remaining under 
the strapping during tightening that may cause slackening when removing the 
stretcher. Secure strapping using a push seal (for steel) and manual sealer. Figure 
4.11 illustrates a typical steel banding for arresting splits.

4.2.4.2.2. Rafter Movement or Shifting. Sustained overload on pitched roofs 
usually results in the rafters spreading with the consequent sag in the ridgeline. 
Include an examination of rafters’ connection to the plate during the roof framing 
inspection. If rafters slipped outward on the plate, consider realigning them by 
pulling the ends of the rafters together with rods and turnbuckles or other devices. 
A similar effect would be noticeable if the exterior walls were thrusted outward 
by the rafters. Remedy this condition in the same manner as for slippage. To limit 
movement, the best way to anchor the rafters to the top plate is by applying 
framing anchors, such as shown in Figure 4.12. 
 
Figure 4.12. Common Rafter to Plate Connection. 
 
 
 
4.2.4.2.3. Warped Lower Chord and Splice Members. Figure 4.13 shows a lower 
chord splice in which both the splice and lower chord members were badly 
warped. This condition usually occurs when trusses are made of light material 
generally 2 inches thick with depths 8 to 10 inches or greater. The omission of 
outside splice plates and an inside filler block between the chords was a 
contributing factor to the conditions shown. The remedy is to install outside splice 
plates using 4-inch split rings with 3/4-inch bolts and the addition of an inside 
filler block for stiffness, as illustrated in Figure 4.14.

4.2.4.2.4. Split Lower Chord. Figure 4.15 illustrates the repair of a split in a lower 
chord. Accomplish this repair by adding two splice plates, one on either side of 
the lower chord and the outside plate, carried through the panel point nearest the 
fracture. Use this procedure in carrying the splice plate through the nearest joint 
if there is insufficient room on each side of the fracture to develop the full strength 
of the member when the splice is bolted in place. Before applying the splice plates, 
drill a small hole ahead of the split to arrest further splitting. Next, apply a clamp 
of sufficient size to draw the broken member together. If a member has a thickness 
greater than 2 inches, place a stitch bolt through the member to retain this position. 
Next, bolt two scabs to the fractured member using sufficient bolts on each side 
of the break to develop the full strength of the member.

4.2.4.2.5. Complete Lower Cord Break. In many cases due to extreme knotty 
conditions and the use of brash (brittle) timber, it will be necessary to repair lower 
chords when one or more of the members has completely failed (Figure 4.16). 
 
Figure 4.16. Lower Chord Break on Double-Chorded Truss. 
 
 
 
4.2.4.2.5.1. Figure 4.17 illustrates a lower chord repair in a double chord truss 
using split ring connectors. The split rings permit the use of fewer bolts and a 
shorter plate than would be necessary for a bolted connection. However, 
experience has shown that when such a break appears near a panel point, it is good 
practice to carry the splice plates completely through the panel point. The 
illustration also shows the installation of new filler blocks between the chord 
members. A break of this type cannot be adequately repaired by adding splice 
plates to the failed members alone, due to the difficulty in installing split grooves 
on the inside face of the broken member. Therefore, the splice plate, which would 
normally be on the inside face of the broken member, is placed on the outside face 
of the opposite chord member where split rings can be readily installed.

Figure 4.17. Lower Chord Break Repair Using Split Ring Connectors. 
 
 
 
4.2.4.2.5.2. Illustrated in Figure 4.18 is an alternate method of repair for the same 
type of failure. It involves using bolts without connector rings. In the example, 
the repair is to the single broken chord member. The same principles described 
above apply here, except split ring connectors are not used. To develop the full 
strength of the failed member, it is necessary by this method to use a considerably 
larger number of bolts than required by the former method. It is also necessary to 
use longer pieces of repair timber. This method is not advisable for large fractures 
and should only be an option when split rings and the equipment necessary for 
their installation are not available.

4.2.4.2.6. Sagging Rafters or Beams. If rafters are sagging due to overload, 
consider repairing by splicing additional member or members to the existing ones. 
Sustained overload on pitched roofs can also cause the rafters to spread with a 
resultant sag in the ridgeline. Jacking and/or shimming may be necessary to repair 
sagging beams. However, sometimes a sagging timber beam will appear 
overloaded when it is not overloaded. An inelastic deformation called creep will 
give an appearance of excessive deflection at the midpoint. Damage might occur 
if such a beam is jacked back into a level position. Check the beam first, to find 
out if there is any evidence of recent motion. In a real overload, there will be fine 
breaks revealing unexposed wood fiber or flaking of paint or other finish material. 
Consider taking measurements and monitor the beam to determine if any other 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
82 
 
 
deflection has occurred. If additional creep is evident, and the roof deck requires 
leveling, use shimming between the beam and roof deck. 
 
4.2.4.2.7. Warped or Broken Rafters. If the roof surface is sound, one option is to 
replace the warped, twisted, or broken rafter. However, a more expedient option 
may be straightening the warped or twisted rafter by adding solid bridging and 
bracing. Additionally, a broken rafter can be scabbed without harming other roof 
framing or the roof covering. 
 
4.2.4.2.8. Fire-Damaged Trusses. Emergency repair of fire-damaged trusses 
normally involves scraping off the charred material and attaching a similar piece 
of wood onto the damaged section, splinting the damaged area between two sound 
pieces of wood, using gusset plates (Figure 4.19), or using a combination of these 
procedures.

4.2.4.3. Roof Sheathing. Most contemporary roof sheathing or decking is 
constructed using well-seasoned sheathing lumber, nominal 1 inch in thickness, 
not more than 6 inches wide and preferably tongued and grooved, or of plywood 
with exterior glue, not less than 1/2 inch thick. The sheathing is usable with 
various roof covers, including asphalt shingles, asbestos-cement shingles, wood 
shingles, slate, tile, flat metal sheets, etc. Damaged and improperly repaired 
sheathing can lead to eventual roof failure. Sheathing damage may result in 
leaking roofs that no longer protect the framing, thus allowing weathering and 
eventual failure of the roof structure. Check the sheathing under the roof covering 
for movement, decay, and warping or cupping. Also, check the roof topside for 
signs of damage and movement of sheathing under the roof covering. It is 
sometimes necessary to redrive nails to tighten sheathing and prevent cupping of 
the individual pieces. Threaded nails of various types are useful since they have 
more withdrawal resistance than plain shank nails. When repairing sheathing, 
remove applicable roof covering and complete the following: 
 
4.2.4.3.1. Remove all protruding nails and renail sound sheathing where 
necessary. 
 
4.2.4.3.2. Remove rotted or warped sheathing boards or delaminated plywood and 
install new decking. Note: Sheathing boards should be fastened to each rafter with 
two nails to provide a smooth, even surface. 
 
4.2.4.3.3. Cover all large cracks, knotholes, and resinous areas with sheet metal. 
For asphalt-shingled roofs, cover the exposed decking with an underlayment of 
Type 15 asphalt-saturated felt before laying shingles. Note: Do not use coated 
felts as an underlayment for shingles since they constitute a good vapor barrier 
and might cause condensation or frost to form at the roof deck. 
 
4.2.4.3.4. Repair or replace flashing as necessary. 
 
4.2.4.3.5. Apply applicable roof cover according to specifications. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
84 
 
 
4.2.4.4. Solid Beams and Columns. With heavy timber beams and columns, severe 
checking sometimes occurs. In most cases, this checking, although of 
considerable width and depth, is parallel to the axis of the member and usually 
requires no attention. An attempt to close such checks with stitch bolts will only 
aggravate the condition and cause the checks to extend completely through the 
members. Whenever this checking occurs in cross-grained members, corrective 
measures must be taken. In extreme cases, the members should be replaced. In 
some cases, repairs can be effectively made by bolting channel or angle iron 
parallel to the member and connecting them with bolts and shear plates. 
 
4.2.4.5. Repair Tools and Equipment. The tools and equipment needed to make 
repairs to timber roofs will vary depending on the type and size of the structure, 
and the extent of the damage. The focus here is on those materials needed to 
perform expedient roof repairs for rapid restoration of vital facilities rather than 
permanent repairs. For many expedient roof repairs, the tools and equipment 
shown below should be sufficient. However, if roof structural members have 
significant damage such as serious splits, breaks, or other failures, then the use of 
stitch bolts, clamps, steel rods, plates, bands, or other repair materials may be 
necessary as a temporary measure until replacing the structural member.

4.2.5. Metal Roof Repair. Commonly, metal roof repairs consist of removing the 
damaged surface material and replacing it with new or cannibalized material. 
Overlap the good metal roofing with the replacement metal roofing by at least a 
matching corrugation or rib section. Catch as many purlins as possible for support 
and tack in place with sheet metal screws along the edges. Use caulk or 
construction adhesive on the upslope side for additional water protection. For 
large holes where purlins are too badly damaged to allow fast repair, and where 
reuse and immediate coverage is required, expediently patch the hole with similar 
materials, but provide at least 24 inches of overlap to distribute loadings. Add 
purlins later as time allows. 
 
4.3. Wall Repairs. For the most part, wall repairs are similar to roof repairs, 
except they should be somewhat easier since there is no longer a requirement to 
lift all materials to roof height. However, be sure to consider shoring and bracing 
the structure as described in Chapter 3, if required. Damaged walls may be 
covered with common materials such as plywood, sheet metal, tarpaulins, and 
plastic sheets. During wartime, if the wall damage is near the ground level and the 
structure is strong enough, earth can even be bermed against the facility for added 
protection from a possible future onslaught. Alternative materials may also be an 
option for this purpose. A few examples include lumber from packing crates and 
shipping dunnage, salvaged and cannibalized materials from other facilities, and 
precast concrete revetments. 
 
4.3.1. Temporary Repair with Plastic Sheeting. Before beginning wall repair, 
ensure the structure is strong enough to withstand pounding from additional winds 
when using plastic sheeting. When using plastic sheeting as an expedient repair 
to cover a hole in a wall, use nailing strips to attach the sheeting to the structure. 
Size the nailing strips and plastic based on the size of the hole. Normally, required 
materials include nailing strips (at least 1"x2" furring strips or 12-gauge, 1” wide 
metal strips), plastic sheeting (at least 6-mil plastic or reinforced sheeting, 10-mil 
plastic, or plastic with woven fiber is preferable), and fasteners of sufficient length 
to penetrate the sheathing at least 1.5 inches into the stud. Avoid black, recycled 
plastic sheeting for repairs because it has a high rate of deterioration, especially 
when exposed to harsh elements for more than a month. Use nails, staples, or 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
86 
 
 
screws in wood and self-tapping metal screws to fasten nailing strips into metal 
siding. The side nailing strips should fit between the top and bottom nailing strips. 
 
4.3.1.1. Wrap plastic sheeting around nailing strips and nail the strips around the 
hole as a rectangular frame to create a tight plastic surface. When possible, 
provide 6 to 12 inches of plastic overlap around the edges of the hole. 
 
4.3.1.2. For holes in plywood (or other nailable substrate) cut the nailing strips 12 
to 24 inches wider than the hole and cut the plastic sheeting yet another 24 inches 
wider. 
 
4.3.1.3. For holes in a non-nailable substrate, locate the nailing strips over the 
closest undamaged wall-framing studs. Then cut the plastic sheeting 24 inches 
wider than the nailing strip. Wrap 12 inches of plastic around both the top and 
bottom nailing strips. When installed, the plastic should be flat against the 
building with the wrapped nailing strip on the outside. 
 
4.3.1.4. Position the strips and fasten in place to the wall (or studs for non-nailable 
surfaces), stretching tight vertically (Figure 4.20). However, be aware that plastic 
sheets only provide protection against the elements. More substantial, structural 
repairs are often necessary. If more weather protection is needed than that 
provided by plastic sheeting, consider using plywood sheathing. 
 
4.3.1.5. Repair any miss-cuts or tears in the plastic with flexible duct tape. Use 
caulk to fill in larger gaps between the nailing strips and wall surface. For metal 
skin walls with deformations, use expanding foam to fill in gaps as necessary 
between the metal and the nailing strip.

4.3.2. Temporary Repair with Tarps. Secured tarps also provide good protection 
from rain and can withstand greater wind loads than plastic sheeting (Figure 
4.21). Note: Usually large tarps and high-strength plastic sheets are special order 
but are generally available as a construction material item. Contact local logistics 
personnel or the AFCEC Reach Back Center for information on how to obtain 
large tarps and sheeting material.

4.3.3. Wood Frame Wall Repairs. Wood-framed walls are typically the easiest 
wall systems to repair. Determining the best repair procedure depends on the use 
of the building, extent of damage, life expectancy of the structure, and possible 
future uses. Relative to repairs, explosions, projectiles, or flying debris causes 
similar types of damage in wood-framed walls. Depending on the size of the hole 
or damage, repair options may include replacing the damaged area in kind, 
replacing a wall section, or providing a structural or non-structural patch. 
 
4.3.3.1. General Information. Common wall framing consists of studs, diagonal 
bracing, cripples, trimmers, headers, and fire blocks. Figure 4.22 illustrates 
typical wall framing details. The studs are usually closely spaced, 2”x4” vertical 
members; arranged in a row with their ends bearing on a long horizontal member 
called a bottom plate or sole plate, and their tops capped with a top plate. Double 
top plates tie walls and partitions together. See paragraph 4.5 for information on 
wooden joint construction.

Figure 4.22. Typical Wall Framing Details. 
 
 
 
4.3.3.1.1. During contingency operations, units may accept some distortion, 
warping, and settling of the structure, and make only wall framing repairs 
necessary to safely occupy and operate the structure. The severity of the damage 
may make it necessary to repair cracking plaster, surface irregularities, sticking 
doors or windows, and other localized faults for personnel safety. 
 
4.3.3.1.2. Do not perform major structural repairs or stud replacement on load-
bearing walls without first removing the load from the wall under repair using 
adequate shoring and jacking. Consider the same precautions when replacing 
doors, arches, and windows; other structural failures often affect the framing 
around these openings. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
90 
 
 
4.3.3.2. Hole Repair. Hole repair requirements will vary by the size of hole, 
location, and wall function. Consider repairing smaller holes that have little 
damage to framing members with a sheathing material (plywood, fiberglass, metal 
sheet, etc.) or plastic sheeting. Plywood or OSB sheets are normally used. Holes 
larger than 3 feet in diameter usually require some reframing before applying new 
plywood/OSB. Still larger holes may require replacing the wall section with new 
framing and plywood/OSB on the outside of the wall. If the damaged wall is a 
shear wall, a cross wall providing lateral support, or a load-bearing wall, the 
required repair may be a structural frame wall having plywood on both sides. 
 
4.3.3.2.1. Small Hole Repair. Use plywood or OSB sheathing to repair small holes 
(< 3 feet in diameter) when the substrate is nailable. If possible, provide at least a 
6-inch overlap over the undamaged siding. When the substrate is not nailable, cut 
the sheathing to fit between the closest studs on both sides of the hole. Position 
sheathing over the hole and fasten into a stud or nailable substrate. Be sure to 
caulk along edge of the sheathing before fastening in place. 
 
4.3.3.2.2. Large Hole Repair. Where sheathing is missing and framing damaged, 
the wall usually requires repair or replacement of damaged framing and new 
sheathing. For larger holes, remove damaged framing, but be particularly careful 
around any load-bearing joists, beams, or wall top plates. Replace damaged or 
missing framing and blocking. After shoring and bracing adjoining walls and 
ceiling, replace any missing studs and top and bottom plates. Attempt to maintain 
normal stud spacing at 16 inches o.c. For partially split or gouged studs (i.e., 60 
to 80 percent of the damaged stud cross section remains), and where some 
sheathing is still present, sister another stud to the damaged stud to strengthen it 
and replace damaged sheathing (Figure 4.23). Apply construction adhesive 
between the damaged stud and new stud for additional strength. To add strength 
to walls that must withstand additional wind loads, apply construction adhesive 
on stud surfaces and then nail the members together.

Figure 4.23. Repair Damaged Stud and Sheathing. 
 
 
 
4.3.3.3. Sheathing Repair. Emergency sheathing repair is usually required on 
structural walls when shear walls fail. As shown in Figure 4.24, shear failure in 
plywood can be either localized to a small area that appears as a tearing pattern in 
the plywood or involve a complete failure where the sheathing itself is dislodged. 
 
Figure 4.24. Examples of Sheathing Damage. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
92 
 
 
4.3.3.3.1. When sheathing is entirely missing, add new material as necessary. To 
do this, remove damaged wall covering and/or sheathing back to the nearest 
exposed stud. Apply 1/2-inch nominal sheathing to the studs for most walls. 
However, for shear walls, use 3/4-inch plywood when available. If additional 
nailing surface is necessary for securing the new sheathing, add another stud to 
the exposed stud. When the wall must act as a hold down for the roof, nail the 
sheathing at 6 inches o.c. vertically and horizontally, except on the top and bottom 
plates where nailing is at 4 inches on center. Block the wall at sheathing edges if 
it is taller than the sheathing. For additional strength and less nailing, apply 
construction adhesive on framing members near edges. Adhesive should meet any 
adopted industry performance specifications. In addition, if repairs will become 
exposed to heavy rains, cover with plastic sheeting and/or caulk the butt joints. 
 
4.3.3.3.2. For shear walls wider than 4 feet, apply plywood horizontally on both 
sides of the wall. When dealing with shear walls between floor levels, if possible 
do not align plywood butt joints with any of the floor joints. Instead, stagger end 
joints and block all edges that require nailing. For other walls, except shear walls, 
apply sheathing vertically or horizontally per standard nailing procedures. Note: 
Some failed shear walls may have been constructed with vertical sheathing. If new 
building standards require three-by (3x) lumber at edges, consider running the 
plywood horizontally and block at all horizontal edges. Blocking provides 
additional stiffness support to shear walls. 
 
4.4. Wood Frame Floor Repairs. Wood floor framing includes floor joists, 
girders, sills, columns or posts, splices, scabs, footings, and required bracing used 
to support the floor. Typically, framing plans will include the floor components, 
their sizes and spacing, and the methods of anchoring joists and girders to the 
columns or posts and foundation walls or footing. Figure 4.25 and Figure 4.26 
illustrates typical floor framing details using light wood-framing techniques. See 
paragraph 4.5 for information on wooden joints and splices. 
 
4.4.1. Posts and Columns. Posts and columns are the vertical members that 
transmit loads directly to the foundations. They are the “legs” of the building and 
should be strong enough to transmit the vertical loads to the foundation (sills) and 
resist lateral or side forces. Columns differ from posts only in their length, and 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
93 
 
 
usually are above grade for support of second- or upper-story floor and roof loads. 
In finished buildings, wallboard, sheathing, etc., often covers the columns making 
them difficult to check and repair.

Figure 4.26. Floor Framing Section Details. 
 
 
 
4.4.1.1. If posts are out of alignment or plumb, consider shoring the floor above 
with jacks or other devices, and realign the posts. If the foundation is not level 
because of uneven settling, correct the foundation before realigning the post or 
column. 
 
4.4.1.2. Posts and columns are usually made of timber that has not been air- or 
kiln-dried. This results in seasoning checks (surface openings), which are caused 
by separation of the wood fibers by drying. Checks are not usually a cause for 
replacement, but carefully note their location, depth, and width. If inspections 
indicate these openings or checks are increasing in size, an engineer should 
examine them for possible replacement. If the post or column shows signs of 
failure from overloading, follow the engineer’s recommendation for adequate 
repairs or replacement. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
95 
 
 
4.4.2. Floor Girders, Beams, and Joists. Girders and beams are those structural 
components of floors that span from column to column or wall to wall and 
transmit vertical loads to their bearings. These loads may be introduced into the 
girders by beams, joists, planks, or other surfaces. The sill provides a nailing base 
for joists or studs resting directly on the foundation. 
 
4.4.2.1. Similar to posts and columns, large size girders, beams, and joists are 
made of lumber that is not kiln dried. Consequently, it is normal to expect 
seasoning checks as the wood loses its moisture. Just as for posts, be sure to 
examine checks for continued expansion. If increases in size, location, and depth 
continues, consider installing stitch-bolts to halt the expansion. The bolts used for 
this purpose are 1/2-inch bolts, threaded on both ends. Drill 9/16-inch holes 
perpendicular to the axis of the girder, beam, or joist. Insert the bolts and place 2-
inch, square-cut washers at each end and tighten the nuts. 
 
4.4.2.2. Beams or joists, which have failed in bending but have sound wood 
surrounding the failure, may be repaired by fastening scabs to the sides of the 
failed member. Many other methods are available to reinforce girders, beams, and 
joists. Selection of the proper method often depend on the loads carried, costs, 
clearances, and accessibility. 
  
4.4.2.3. Bridging is a common method of reinforcing and stiffening floor-framing 
members (joists). Figure 4.27 illustrates how to stiffen floor framing by adding 
or replacing the existing bridging. For the solid bridging method, it is important 
to accurately cut and fit the bridging neatly between the joists to ensure resistance 
to individual movement of the joists. This type of bridging can also function as a 
fire stop if correctly positioned in the floor. Fire stops are obstructions deliberately 
set in concealed airspaces to block passage of hot gases and flames from one area 
to another. For the open bridging example, ensure the bridging is tight by driving 
nails completely through the bridging and into the joist.

4.5. Wooden Framing Joints and Splices. Generally, structural repairs to 
existing or damaged wooden-framed buildings at contingency locations includes 
carpentry work on roofs, walls, and other structural features. When making 
repairs, remember structures with nailed wood connections will better resist the 
effects of ground forces and high winds if a continuous load path exists from the 
roof to the foundation. Weak points in a structure usually occur at the connections 
between pieces of lumber. The following paragraphs address typical joints and 
splices used in wood construction and repair along with their common 
applications. 
 
4.5.1. Joints. Joints are connections between two pieces of timber that come 
together at an angle. The types of joints most used in carpentry are butt joints and 
lap joints. The following paragraphs address standard configuration of joints used 
during wood frame construction and repair of damaged framing components. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
97 
 
 
4.5.1.1. Miter Butt Joint. Builders use miter joints mostly in framing, usually at 
corners where the straight butt joint is not satisfactory. However, it is a very weak 
joint and should not be an option when strength is important. To form a right-
angle miter butt joint, cut each piece of lumber at a 45-degree angle as illustrated 
in Figure 4.28. 
 
4.5.1.2. Oblique Butt Joint. The oblique butt joint is a common method to brace 
other pieces of timber (Figure 4.28). However, this joint should not be an option 
where great strength is required. Form the joint by butting the mitered end of one 
board against the face of another board. The strength of the oblique butt joint 
depends upon the nailing. The nail size depends upon the timber size. Depending 
on the material, 3 to 5 nails should be sufficient to toenail into the joint for 
adequate strength. 
 
Figure 4.28. Types of Butt Joints. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
98 
 
 
4.5.1.3. Straight Butt Joint. To make this joint, the butt end of one board should 
be square and the face of the other smooth so that the pieces fit snug and 
perpendicular to each other (see Figure 4.28). For framing, secure butt joints with 
size 8d or 10d nails toenailed to strengthen the joint. Generally, the end grain is 
the weakest part of a piece of wood when used in joints. Butt joints are made at 
either one or two end-grain parts. It will be no stronger than the quality of those 
parts. Therefore, butt joints are the weakest type of joint. This is especially true if 
the joint is made of two pieces of wood only. 
 
4.5.1.4. Lap Joints. The lap joint is the strongest joint. The plain lap joint is the 
simplest and most often used method in joining framing and general construction. 
The joint built in this manner is as strong as the fasteners and material used. To 
make the half-lap joint, cut away equal lengths and thicknesses from two boards 
and join them so the cut-away portions interlock, forming the joint. To maximize 
effectiveness, surfaces must fit snugly and smoothly. As shown in Figure 4.29, 
two other useful variations of the half-lap joint are the cross-lap and middle lap. 
 
Figure 4.29. Typical Lap Joints. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
99 
 
 
4.5.2. Wood Splices. The splice is another way to join wood materials rapidly. 
Splices connect two or more pieces of material that extend in the same line. The 
joint will be as strong as the unjointed portions. The type of splice used depends 
on the type of stress/strain that the spliced timber must withstand. Vertical 
supports (longitudinal stress) require splices that resist compression. Trusses, 
braces, and joists (transverse and angular stress) require splices that resist tension. 
Horizontal supports, such as girders or beams, require splices that resist bending 
tension and compression (Figure 4.30). 
 
4.5.2.1. Compression-Resistant Splices. Compression-resistant splices support 
weight or exert pressure and will resist compression stress only. The most 
common types of compression-resistant splices are the plain splice, butt splice, 
and the halved splice. 
 
Figure 4.30. Splice Stresses. 
 
 
 
4.5.2.1.1. Butt Splice. Construct a butt splice by butting the squared ends of two 
pieces of timber together and securing them in this position with two wood or 
metal pieces fastened on opposite sides of the timber (Figure 4.31). The two short 
supporting pieces keep the splice straight and prevent buckling. Metal plates used 
as supports in a butt splice are called fishplates. Wood plates are called scabs and 
are fastened in place with bolts or screws. Nails or corrugated fasteners are other 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
100 
 
 
options to secure scabs. If using nails, stagger and drive nails at an angle away 
from the splice. Note: Too many nails or oversized nails will weaken the splice. 
 
4.5.2.1.2. Plain Splice. The plain splice is the easiest and most common splice 
used in vertical timbers, which require splicing. A long overlap of the two pieces 
is necessary to provide sufficient room for enough fasteners (Figure 4.31). 
 
Figure 4.31. Typical Plain and Butt Splices. 
 
 
 
4.5.2.1.3. Halved Splice. Make the halved splice by cutting away half the 
thickness of equal lengths from the ends of two pieces of timber, then fitting the 
tongues (laps) together splice (Figure 4.32). The laps should be long enough to 
provide adequate bearing surfaces. Consider using nails or bolts to fasten the 
halved splice. Note: To give the halved splice resistance to tension as well as 
compression, fishplates or scabs may be used. 
 
4.5.2.1.4. Bend Resistant Splice. This type of splice is common where it is 
necessary to join horizontal members that support weight (see Figure 4.32). 
Consider fastening a scab or fishplate along the bottom of the splice to resist the 
tendency of the pieces to separate. Note: When this splice is not an option, a butt 
joint, halved splice, or square splice secured by fishplates or scabs may be used.

Figure 4.32. Common Halved and Bend-Resistant Splices. 
 
 
 
4.5.2.2. Tension-Resistant Splices. In members such as trusses, braces, and joists, 
the joint undergoes stress in more than one direction; this creates tension, buckling 
the member in a predictable direction. Tension-resistant splices provide the 
greatest practical number of bearing surfaces and shoulders within the splice. The 
square splice and long plain splice are two common tension resistant examples 
(Figure 4.33). 
 
4.5.2.2.1. Square Splice. This splice is a modification of the compression-resistant 
halved splice. Cut complementary notches in the tongues or laps to provide an 
additional locking shoulder. Use nails or bolts to fasten the square splice. To 
increase the strength of a square splice significantly, use fishplates or scabs. 
 
4.5.2.2.2. Long Plain Splice. This splice is a hasty substitute for the square splice. 
A long overlap of two pieces is desirable to provide adequate bearing surface and 
enough room for fasteners to make up for the lack of shoulder lock.

4.6. Emergency Wall Repairs on Masonry Structures. Emergency repair of 
masonry walls is usually more time-consuming, strenuous, and equipment and 
material sensitive than emergency repairs to wood walls. Masonry walls are 
usually block and/or brick; however, masonry buildings composed of rock and 
mortar walls may be encountered at some overseas locations. Use extra caution 
when performing emergency repairs on masonry walls. Failed masonry walls are 
normally more dangerous to work with than most other walls for several reasons. 
This added danger results from factors such as the increased dead weight of the 
building materials, the brittle nature of masonry products, and the limited ability 
to determine the actual extent of damage by simply viewing the apparent damage. 
In fact, workers may not know how or even if the wall is reinforced (i.e., 
reinforcing bars) or what is holding the cracked areas together. 
 
4.6.1. Damage Assessment Considerations. Consider the following when 
assessing masonry wall damage. While a crack may appear to be small, the wall 
may still fail if there is inadequate reinforcing steel to hold the crack together. 
Reinforcing steel is usually in select cells. Determine if a crack crosses reinforced 
cells and if the cells are still solid. If the cells do not contain reinforcing steel, 
determine if the crack is being held in place temporarily by friction from dead 
loads. If such is the case, a small shift in the weight of a structure or ground 
tremors (i.e., seismic shaking from nearby movement of heavy equipment) can 
cause release and catastrophic collapse. Keep in mind that removal of debris, rain, 
snow, or wind can also cause shifting in multistory structures and subsequent 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
103 
 
 
collapse. Two additional factors associated with masonry walls to assess include 
determining if the wall can be shored to maintain lateral support when ornamental 
wall columns are damaged and if the wall’s floor or roof attachments are damaged 
or have failed. 
 
4.6.2. Masonry Wall Variations. Emergency repairs to masonry structures usually 
depend on whether the wall is a structural wall or a non-structural wall (infill or 
offset). However, structural walls can be infill walls that provide lateral support 
or shear walls built into a concrete or steel moment frame building. In addition, 
structural walls can be supporting walls that provide lateral and vertical support 
for the roof and other floors. Non-structural walls are usually constructed as infill 
walls (Figure 4.34) that have wall ties to flexible frames, or they may use tracks 
or offset walls that extend past the exterior frame and wrap around it without 
providing lateral support. If a structural wall is damaged, emergency shoring and 
bracing may be required along with repair. Once strengthened, the wall should be 
closed up with injection grout or some other means of confinement as discussed 
in this chapter. Emergency repairs for non-structural walls depend on the damage. 
Typical repairs usually involve removing and replacing damaged material and 
patching the open area with appropriate sheathing.

AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
104 
 
 
4.6.3. Small Hole Repair in Structural Walls. The simplest emergency repair to a 
masonry wall is repairing a small hole through the wall involving no damage to 
the rest of the structure. Usually, this will occur from debris thrown through the 
wall from an exterior blast or high winds. The repair method for small, punched 
holes in masonry structures varies according to the type of wall involved. The 
emergency repair method for small holes cleanly punched through a non-
structural masonry wall, where only a few blocks are missing, is to fasten a patch 
of wood sheathing over the hole. Cut a sheet of sheathing (plywood or OSB) that 
is large enough to extend several inches past the next undamaged blocks' grout 
joints around the hole. When positioning the patch on the outside of the wall, 
apply construction adhesive to the edges of the sheathing. Next, drill holes 
through the sheathing and into the undamaged grout joint (or a block with a filled 
cell); secure the sheathing in place with bolts, washers, and lead or expanding 
anchors. Do not use this repair method if there are loose blocks or cracks around 
the hole; rather, tie the wall together with sheathing on both sides. When only a 
few blocks are damaged (Figure 4.35) or missing, it may be easier to knock out 
the damaged material, square up the opening to size, and fill the void using new 
blocks and a fast-setting cement or epoxy grout mortar. 
 
Figure 4.35. Damaged Blocks. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
105 
 
 
4.6.4. Large Hole Repair in Structural Walls. Structural masonry walls with larger 
holes (i.e., larger than about five blocks high and four blocks wide) or failed 
sections are dangerous. It is usually better to shore and brace the roof or floors 
above the failed area and then work somewhere else in the facility. However, 
avoid moving to another section of the building until the extent of the structural 
damage is thoroughly analyzed. Failed sections in one part of a masonry building 
can often lead to a progressive collapse in the rest of the structure when wind, 
rain, vibration, or shifting loads are involved. Figure 4.36 is an excellent example 
of a progressive structural collapse after an earthquake. There are few options for 
making emergency repairs for larger holes in structural masonry walls. For a 
wartime repair of a larger hole in a shear wall or support wall, shore and brace the 
area around the wall, square up the hole, provide necessary bracing, and cover the 
hole. Leave the shoring in place if there will be continued blast or seismic shaking; 
cribbing is more stable than using a single support post. After shoring the area, 
square the hole, brace the hole with double 2"x8" headers and side braces, and use 
double 2"x4" cross bracing. Cover over each side with one or two layers of 3/4-
inch plywood (depending on the expected shear loads). Cut sheets to run 
horizontally and allow at least 8 inches of overlap onto good masonry. Position 
sheets and drill holes through the masonry to align with the holes in the plywood. 
Tie together with threaded rods, washers, and nuts. When possible, use 2"x4"s 
between opposing bolts to prevent the tie rods, washers, and nuts from tearing 
through the plywood. 
 
4.6.5. Structural Wall Confining. When unable to replace broken blocks for a 
small hole in a structural masonry wall, confining the wall is a safe option. This 
repair should be limited to small holes with seven or eight blocks missing and 
where there is no extensive cracking around the hole. Use at least 4- or 3-gauge 
sheet steel (i.e., about 1/4-inch thick) on both sides of the hole. Cut the steel to 
provide about 8 inches of overlap between the steel and the undamaged block. 
Drill through the sheet steel about 4 inches from the edges in the corners and 
midpoint on each side. Next, drill through the masonry so it will align with the 
holes in the sheet steel. Next, run a bead of construction adhesive around the hole 
on both sides before fastening the sheet steel together with threaded rods, washers, 
and nuts (see Figure 4.37 graphic sequence).

Figure 4.37. Masonry Wall Confining Sequence. 
 
 
 
4.6.6. Large Hole Repair in Non-Structural Walls. Non-structural walls with large 
holes (i.e., up to about five blocks high and four blocks wide) can usually be 
repaired with a sheet of plywood, a couple of 2"x8" braces, and a header. Knock 
out or saw-cut loose block on the top and sides of the hole to provide nearly 
straight edges (i.e., square up the hole). Cut one or two 2"x8"s for a header to fit 
the top of the squared hole (if overseas and metric blocks are used, use a wider 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
107 
 
 
header, or add 3/4-inch plywood cut as wide as the block and nailed to the top of 
the header). Next, cut two side braces about 1/8 inch longer than the distance from 
the bottom of the hole to the bottom of the header and place one end of the braces 
at the bottom of the hole on each side and drive the top of the braces in place to 
hold up the header. Once in position, toenail the top of each header. Lastly, cut 
sheathing and fasten in place in the same manner as described for covering a small 
hole. If desired, and for additional rigidity, apply 1/2-inch sheetrock on the inside 
facing. 
 
4.6.7. Crack Repairs on Reinforced Walls. When replacing a reinforced masonry 
or concrete wall is not feasible, an acceptable repair is to fill the cracks with a 
structural grout or epoxy (Figure 4.38). In most cases, epoxy injection works best 
(see Attachment 2, Crack Repair Using Epoxy Injection Method). 
 
Figure 4.38. Epoxy Application. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
108 
 
 
4.6.7.1. The epoxy injection method is useful to repair cracks as narrow as 0.002 
inch if the reinforcing steel has not been stressed beyond its elastic limit. If 
necessary, seal the top of the crack with the same epoxy troweled in place or use 
metal plates. This type of repair generally consists of drilling holes at close 
intervals along the cracks, in some cases installing entry ports, and injecting the 
epoxy under pressure. However, for small cracks, cartridges used with handguns 
may be an option. 
 
4.6.7.2. For massive structures, an alternative procedure consists of drilling a 
series of holes, usually 7/8 inch in diameter, which intercept the crack at several 
locations. Typically, holes are spaced at 5-foot intervals. 
 
4.7. Window Repair. In an expedient sense, there are not too many fixes for 
damaged windows. Attempting to replace glass is much too long an effort and 
during a conflict or earthquake, is almost self-defeating since it will probably all 
be lost again in the next attack or aftershock. 
 
4.7.1. Repair Options. Normally, placing plywood over the window opening is 
sufficient. If the facility must remain occupied and requires daylight, consider 
using rigid plastic sheets to maintain a visible opening. Plexiglas sheets are 
usually an option for this repair. Use polycarbonate sheets if additional protection 
is required. Either way, it is important to first bond the rigid sheet to the building 
using construction adhesive, and then clamp it to the building using a simple 
wooden or metal frame and screws. 
 
4.7.2. Repair Procedures. Do not drill or fasten through the sheets if there will be 
additional blasts or high winds. Instead, hold them in place with a wooden (or 
metal) frame. Cut the rigid sheets 2 inches wider and taller than the opening. Use 
2"x4"s or 2"x6"s to frame the opening, sizing the frame to fit outside the 
dimension of the opening. After configuring the frame, apply a continuous bead 
of construction adhesive to the edge of the opening to set and hold the sheet in 
place. Sandwich the rigid sheet between the building and the frame and clamp in 
place by fastening the frame to the building with screws or other appropriate 
(removable) fasteners. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
109 
 
 
4.8. Door Repair. If damaged door openings must remain accessible for entry 
and exit, consider shoring and framing the door to keep the opening safe. To 
protect the opening against further damage from wind, weather, or blast forces, 
use expedient measures such as stacking sandbags at the opening. This is 
especially important when the damaged wall is a structural wall. 
 
4.8.1. Shoring. The priority for an emergency repair of a door opening in a 
structural wall is to maintain the wall's structural integrity. Shore the opening at 
the top, bottom, and sides (see paragraph 3.3.2.5). Use spreaders at the top and 
bottom of the door to take the place of cross bracing. If blast or wind protection 
is required, use sandbags stacked at the entrance and along walls. 
 
4.8.2. Weather Tightness. If weather tightness and further strengthening are 
required, construct a separate door. Tack the door framework to the opening to 
avoid causing additional stress on any weakened structures. Make sure the 
connections to the building are relatively weak. Rely on sandbag berms or other 
expedient berm structures for protection against blast. 
 
4.8.3. Sliding/Roller Doors. Hangars, warehouses, and maintenance facilities are 
often critical facilities. Excluding hardened aircraft shelters, these facilities have 
doors that are vulnerable to exterior blast and high winds. Commonly, hangar 
doors are sliding doors, with top guide tracks and bottom rollers on support tracks. 
Other types of large doors are usable on large facilities when blast protection is 
not a problem or when snow and ice are a problem. Lightweight doors are often 
on newer permanent or deployable hangars and warehouses. Deployable hangars 
and some newer maintenance facilities and warehouses may have vertical lift, 
clamshell, canopy, or folded-fabric lift (panel) doors. 
 
4.8.4. Heavy Metal Door Repair. Full metal, bottom-rolling doors that have come 
loose from their tracks usually are not expediently repairable. Limit repairs to 
patching holes. If the rollers and top tracks are undamaged, some doors can be 
jacked-up and pushed back on tracks. 
 
4.8.4.1. The following failures require door removal and/or track repair: 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
110 
 
 
• 
Rolling doors come loose from the top rail. 
• 
Doors have fallen inward from the top when wind or blast pressures have 
racked the building or collapsed the metal overhead track system. 
• 
High winds or floods lifted or pushed the doors off the bottom track. 
• 
Door has hung up on the upper track and torqued the wall and supporting 
framework. 
 
4.8.4.2. Be aware when assessing damage to very large metal rolling doors such 
as those on hangars; emergency repair is usually not feasible except by trained 
heavy repair teams supported by cranes and other special equipment. Also, check 
on the door and framing specifications before considering the repair of top rails 
using standard shapes of American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) A36 
(36,000 pounds per square inch [psi]) steel. Large steel hangar door structures 
often use ASTM A50 (50,000-psi) steel and special fittings. If an ASTM A36 
structural shape is used and the original specification was for 50,000-psi steel, the 
door framing and tracks will be grossly undersized for the load if 36,000-psi steel 
is used. 
 
4.9. Fabric Structure Repairs. 
 
4.9.1. Lightweight Metal/Fabric Door Repair. Primarily applicable to vertical lift, 
clamshell, canopy, and folded-fabric lift doors. Specialists can usually make 
repairs to these lightweight doors in an emergency without the use of heavy 
equipment. Deployable structures such as the Large Area Maintenance Shelter 
shown in Figure 4.39 consists of clamshell end-doors with field-repairable fabric 
panels, and lightweight framing. 
 
4.9.1.1. Door Structure Repairs. If the structure’s repair manual allows it, consider 
repairing bent framing by straightening, bolstering with additional piping, or 
replacing with similar common materials. In addition, damaged tracks can often 
be straightened, detached, or cut out and replaced using similar materials. Refer 
to the Operator’s Manual for specific repair guidelines. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
111 
 
 
Figure 4.39. Large Area Maintenance Shelter. 
 
 
 
4.9.1.2. Door Surface Skin Repairs. Holes in lightweight rigid composite panels 
are usually repaired with a patch of 14-gauge sheet metal fastened over the hole. 
Use construction adhesive and sheet metal screws, screw-in shields, or expanding 
sleeve anchors, whichever is appropriate. Fabric panel systems can usually be 
quickly repaired. Coated fabric systems are used with many portable shelters, 
deployable hangars, and maintenance shelters. The most common coated fabric is 
Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)-coated polyester. It is used with many clamshell-type 
structures and fabric hangars. Larger structures may use a tensile fabric design. 
Emergency repairs must maintain structural integrity of these larger structures. 
Emergency fabric repair kits are usually available from the manufacturer. If one 
is not available, consult with Fuels or Aircrew Flight Equipment shops, as some 
of their shop methods and equipment are similar to manufacturers' recommended 
methods and equipment. Depending on whether the material is a cover fabric or 
tensile fabric, there are usually two repair methods for fixing pierced fabric 
sections in walls and overhead doors: the Fabric Clamp and PVC-Coated 
Polyester Fabric system. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
112 
 
 
4.9.1.2.1. Fabric Clamp Repair. Fabric clamp systems are most often used for 
folded fabric-lift doors (Figure 4.40). The steps begin with loosening screws on 
the fabric-clamp strips above and below the torn section. Next, cut the repair 
fabric large enough to overlap the tear by at least 2 inches on each side. Once the 
repair patch is properly sized, extend the repair fabric under and between the two 
clamp strips. Then, retighten the clamp strips, trim off excess material, and tack 
down the fabric edges with adhesive or double-sided tape. Lastly, trim off or glue 
together any loose fabric that is under the patch and around the tear. 
 
Figure 4.40. Fabric Clamp Repair on Folded Fabric Lift Door. 
 
 
 
4.9.1.2.2. Repair of PVC-Coated Polyester Fabric Systems. The manufacturer for 
these fabric systems usually provides repair criteria; however, if criteria are not 
readily available, consider the general guidance here. Repairs usually require 
either a heat-welded patch (with either a heat gun or bonding iron and a roller) or 
a solvent-welded patch (with solvent). For coated fabric systems that have a slick, 
Teflon-like coating on the exterior surface, patch the hole from the inside using a 
piece of fabric and adhesive. As with the Fabric Clamp method, consult with Fuels 
or Aircrew Flight Equipment shop personnel to repair these types of fabrics. Begin 
the repair by cutting and positioning a fabric patch over the torn section. For 
tensile fabric systems that distribute load, cut the patch to extend at least 12 inches 
past each damaged edge, unless the manufacturer has other guidelines. For simple 
cover systems, cut the patch to extend 2 to 4 inches past each damaged edge. For 
heat-welded patches, provide heat between the fabric and the patch. Hold a piece 
of plywood on the inside surface and use the roller on the outside of the heated 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
113 
 
 
patch to roll the material together. Roll out air bubbles, keeping the temperature 
just under the point where smoke develops on the patch, or the two fabrics will 
melt. When done properly, the result should look similar to that in Figure 4.41. 
 
Figure 4.41. Example of Heat/Solvent -Welded Patch Repair. 
 
 
 
4.9.2. Cement and Sealer Fabric Repair. Other fabric-based deployable assets, 
such as Small and Medium Shelter Systems, are sheathed with a fabric outer 
covering over rigid framing. When damage to these units occur, it is not always 
possible or practical to make sewn repairs, especially when the shelter is already 
up and the damage is minor. Manufacturers usually provide specific repair kits to 
correct minor damage. Below are typical repair procedures for holes and tears. 
 
4.9.2.1. Cemented Repair. The kind of cemented repair depends on the size of the 
holes and tears. If a hole or tear is small and it is not located near a seam, an edge, 
or hardware, a cemented patch or dab of adhesive may be a sufficient repair. 
 
4.9.2.1.1. Small Hole Adhesive Repair. A dab of adhesive is used on a hole in a 
tent that measures 1/8 inch or less across. To seal a small hole, first use a wire 
brush to clean the area around the hole and raise the nap of the fabric (Figure 
4.42). Next, simply use a small stick or paddle to put a dab of adhesive on the 
hole, working it into the fabric while being sure to bridge the damage with the 
adhesive to ensure a complete seal. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
114 
 
 
Figure 4.42. Cementing Small Hole with Adhesive. 
 
 
 
4.9.2.1.2. Large Hole/Tear Adhesive Repair. Cemented patches are used to cover 
holes and tears that are more than 1/8 inch, but less than 4-3/4 inches across. 
Putting a cemented patch on a tent is similar to patching a bicycle tire. To apply a 
cemented patch (Figure 4.43), first obtain the following items (if not included in 
the repair kit): a ruler, chalk, wire brush, flat board, paddle, roller, tent-patching 
adhesive, and a piece of clean matching canvas. Next, measure the damage and 
cut a round patch from a piece of matching canvas, making sure the patch is large 
enough to extend 3/4 inch beyond the damage in all directions. Then, place the 
board under the damage for support. On an erect tent, another individual will be 
needed inside the tent to hold the board against the damage. Center the patch over 
the damage and draw a circle with chalk around the patch, then remove the patch. 
Use a wire brush to clean the fabric and raise the nap of the material inside the 
circle and the patch itself. Now, position the patch facedown over the damage and 
use the paddle to coat the patch evenly with adhesive. Let the adhesive overlap 
the edge of the patch a little so that it forms a circle on the tent. Next, remove the 
patch, flatten out the canvas and the edges of the hole or tear as much as possible 
and fill in the circle with a coating of adhesive. Let the adhesive dry, and then 
apply a second coat of adhesive to the tent and to the patch. Now, wait 10 to 15 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
115 
 
 
minutes for the adhesive to become tacky (test the patch by touching it). The patch 
is ready to use when it is sticky. Once the adhesive reaches this point, center the 
patch face up on top of the damage and press the two sticky surfaces together. Use 
a roller to press the excess adhesive and the air bubbles from under the patch. Roll 
first in one direction and then in the opposite direction. If no roller is available, 
use the can of adhesive as a roller. Be sure to seal the can tightly first. Lastly, dip 
the tip of one gloved finger in the adhesive and run the finger around the edge of 
the patch to seal the edge with adhesive and prevent fraying. Note: With some 
fabrics, large tears must be sewn together prior to the application of adhesive or 
sealer. Caution: Seam sealer and solvent are extremely flammable and contain 
toxic fumes. Do not smoke or use seam sealer/solvent near an open flame. Use 
seam sealer and solvent with goggles and gloves. When indoors, wear a respirator, 
or use in an open, well-ventilated area, away from sources of combustion. Death 
or severe injury may result from explosion or fire. Inhalation of fumes may cause 
toxic sickness.

4.9.3. Sealer Repairs. Silicone sealer (MIL-A-46106) is used to repair holes and 
tears in stovepipes shields such as those in Legacy shelters (e.g., TEMPER tents). 
Just as cemented repairs, the kind of sealer repairs used depends on the extent of 
the damage. 
 
4.9.3.1. Sealer Repairs for Small Holes/Tears in Stovepipe Shields. A layer of 
silicone sealer is used to repair holes or tears that measure 2 inches or less across. 
To make this repair, obtain cleaning materials, a dry rag, a can of silicone sealer, 
and a paddle. Then clean and dry the damaged area thoroughly. Next, spread a 
1/16-inch thick layer of sealer on both sides of the shield, covering the hole or tear 
and at least 1/2-inch on each side of the damage (Figure 4.44). Smooth out the 
layer as evenly as possible. Brace the shield so that the sealer does not touch 
anything while it is wet and allow the repair to dry for 4 hours on a sunny day 
with low humidity or 6 hours on a humid day. Do not move the tent while the 
sealer is drying.

4.9.3.2. Sealer Repairs for Large Holes/Tears in Stovepipe Shields. A patch 
attached with silicone sealer is used to repair holes and tears more than 2 inches 
across in stovepipe shields (Figure 4.45). To make this repair, first obtain the 
following items (if not included in the repair kit): ruler, cleaning materials, a dry 
rag, a craftsman’s knife, a piece of matching patch material, a can of silicone 
sealer, and a paddle. Begin the process by cleaning and drying the damaged area 
thoroughly. Next, measure the damaged area and cut a patch from material 
salvaged from a shield that could not be repaired, making sure that the patch is 
large enough to extend 1 inch beyond the damage on all sides. Now, spread a layer 
of sealer on either the patch or the shield and press the patch in place at once. 
Finally, spread sealer 1 inch over all edges of the patch to eliminate fraying. Do 
not move the shield for 4 to 6 hours. Note: Additional details on fabric repair 
procedures can be obtained in the following documents: T.O. 35E4-219-1, Large 
Area Maintenance Shelter; T.O. 35E4-216-1, Bare Base Dome Shelter; T.O.

WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS REPAIR 
 
5.1. Introduction. Timely repair of water and waste systems is essential after a 
disaster or enemy attack for obvious health, hygiene, and operational reasons. 
Since it is impossible to predict the extent of damage to these systems during a 
disaster or attack, units often establish specific priorities after an incident. Facility 
priorities listed in base recovery plans are generally a sound starting point. 
However, the EOC normally dictates repair priorities during emergencies. In most 
cases, service restoration to crucial base functions is a priority. If necessary, some 
creative engineering and cannibalization of non-critical systems may be required 
to establish or keep priority water and sanitation systems operating. Some 
expedient repairs to water and wastewater systems, and associated piping and 
fittings last a long time, but most expedient repairs are temporary measures that 
provide limited support for short periods. 
 
5.2. Overview. Although local utility services and commercial utility companies 
may service or repair base water and wastewater systems via contract, this chapter 
provide CE Water and Fuel Systems Maintenance personnel with basic 
considerations and expedient repair options for the most vulnerable components 
of water and wastewater systems. For general safety-related considerations and 
issues, refer to Chapter 2 in this publication. Note: Some water plants use 
chlorine (liquid or gas) for disinfection during water treatment. It can be very 
harmful on-site and off, and if overlooked can cause significant health impacts. 
Chlorine gas is very dense, travels downward in ditches, and can collect in 
depressed areas. 
 
5.3. Water Distribution Systems. Water is an important utility that usually 
requires quick restoration following a disaster or hostile attack. Water systems 
normally have a high priority for repair due to firefighting requirements, 
decontamination purposes, personal consumption, cooking use, and both general 
and medical hygiene. The major components of any water supply system are 
source, treatment, storage, and distribution (Figure 5.1). Of these, the distribution 
network (including service connections or Point of Use), is the most extensive 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
119 
 
 
component of the installation water system and is where most expedient repairs 
are affected. 
 
Figure 5.1. Typical Features of Water Supply Systems. 
 
 
 
5.3.1. Anticipated Damage and Effects. Subterranean construction protects the 
distribution network from certain types of disasters. However, its widespread 
layout can make it more vulnerable to other emergencies. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
120 
 
 
5.3.1.1. High wind associated with a hurricane or tornado is not likely to break 
underground water mains, but a major enemy air attack is almost certain to disrupt 
some part of the dispersed layout of the distribution network. Damage to the 
distribution system is normally confined to pumps, valves, appurtenances, and 
water mains. Water mains may be broken in several locations resulting in easily 
recognizable leaks (Figure 5.2) as well as numerous hidden leaks producing 
delayed damage in the form of undermined streets or structures. 
 
Figure 5.2. Obvious Water Line Break. 
 
 
 
5.3.1.2. Contamination to a water system can easily occur when water mains and 
sewers in close proximity fracture. If water mains and sewers are on a steep 
gradient, sewage may enter water mains with enough head to flow to the 
consumers' taps below. Contamination may result when broken mains reduce 
pressure within the system, heavy draft for firefighting, valve closures, and supply 
failures occurring during enemy attack or sabotage. Contamination may also 
occur by waste debris entering open mains through open ends or fractures during 
repair operations. The more common diseases attributed to contaminated water 
are typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery. Diarrhea may also result from 
contaminated water. An epidemic of any of these illnesses seriously hampers 
military operations. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
121 
 
 
5.3.1.3. During periods of conflict, a retreating enemy or terrorists may purposely 
contaminate water supply systems by placing bone oil, refuse, bodies, lubrication 
oils, or other materials in wells, springs, reservoirs, tanks, or the distribution 
system. Consequently, units should take measures to secure easy access points 
such as well points, pumping stations, and storage vessels. 
 
5.3.2. Expedient Repair Process. Once the situation permits, begin work on 
restoring water supply since water supply systems often have a higher priority in 
rehabilitation than other utilities. Time is normally a limiting factor during base 
recovery, and rapid completion of the job is by far more important than economy 
of labor, materials, and equipment. First responders typically attempt to isolate 
and/or bypass damaged lines. After assessing the damage, make temporary repairs 
to control water loss, maintain essential flow and pressure, and permit the 
reopening of valves. In making improvised repairs, consider using any suitable 
material or equipment available to meet the immediate need. A repaired water 
main does not have to be leak-proof to be functional. Work crews can improve 
expedient repairs as time and supplies allow. Water distribution systems include 
pipe from 1-1/2 to 24 inches in diameter and may consist of PVC rigid plastic 
pipe, steel, asbestos cement, cast iron, and ductile iron. Water pressure ranges 
from 60- to 120-psi. Most distribution lines should be repairable and, therefore, 
efforts should concentrate on quickly reestablishing major feeder lines. Generally, 
fixed system components, such as pumps, hydrants, valves, and purification units, 
are not expediently repairable due to the time required to accomplish a fix. Below 
are some expedient repair options for water distribution systems. See UFC 3-230-
02, Operation and Maintenance: Water Supply Systems for more repair data. 
 
5.3.2.1. Identify the Problem. The first corrective action is to identify the extent 
of the problem. Pipes, mains, valves, and pumping stations can be located from 
existing utility drawings. If available, local technicians should be able to assist 
greatly in this effort. Multi-frequency pipe locators and similar equipment can be 
used to locate otherwise hidden lines. As mentioned previously, water main 
breaks should be easy to recognize and is where most expedient repairs will be 
necessary. After locating pipe breaks, ensure the worksite is safe (see Chapter 2), 
and shut off the water supply to the damaged pipe section. For belowground 
repairs, remove standing water and debris, and excavate a repair trench as 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
122 
 
 
necessary to reveal the damaged piping so you can perform a damage assessment. 
Continue to excavate around the damaged piping until you locate undamaged pipe 
sections. The pipe sections must be round and in close alignment. 
 
5.3.2.2. Select Repair Materials. Typical repair consumables include pipes (PVC, 
iron, steel, polyethylene, etc.), valves, fittings, couplers, and fuel for pumps and 
equipment. Mechanical repair clamps and couplings are generally desirable 
because of their quick installation, vibration resistance and minimal amount of 
equipment, labor, and repair times. Often made of stainless steel and ductile iron, 
manufacturers also use alloys, carbon steel, and other materials. The most 
common repair fittings are the full circle clamp, mechanical and compression 
coupling. Work crew can use clamps and couplers to make repairs in or out of 
water and above or below the ground (Figure 5.3). 
 
Figure 5.3. Belowground Pipe Clamp and Coupler Repairs. 
 
 
 
5.3.2.2.1. Full circle clamps can be the sole repair material for pipe punctures; but 
usually, the clamps along with hardwall pipe is required as a replacement for 
complete pipe breaks. Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5 illustrate various pipe damage 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
123 
 
 
and typical repair options. Common tools and equipment used during pipe repair 
include those listed in Table 5.1.

Pipe Repair Tools and Equipment 
• Earth moving equipment 
• File 
• Shovel 
• Brush 
• Trash pump 
• Wire brush 
• Gloves

5.3.2.2.2. Full Circle clamps provide a full 360-degree seal around the pipe. They 
are the most preferred for water, sewer, and fuel line repairs. A full circle clamp 
is fast and simple to install. Workers wrap the clamp around the pipe, properly 
position it over the repair or connected area, and tighten the bolts. This compacts 
the rubber gasket tightly against the full circumference of the pipe wall, to form a 
leak resistant seal. They are available in various sizes and materials, primarily 
used for repairing holes, splits and breaks in distribution pipes. If necessary, work 
crews can install the full circle clamp underwater. Shown in Figure 5.6 are 
examples of full circle clamps. 
 
5.3.2.2.3. The mechanical coupling is primarily for steam line repairs. Workers 
push the pipe ends into the coupler and tighten the bolts. As the bolts tighten, the 
gaskets in the coupler compress to form a leak resistant seal. The Dresser coupling 
illustrated in Figure 5.7 is suitable for small and large-sized pipes. It has a 
seamless body with gaskets and flanges bolted together to form a leak-proof joint. 
 
5.3.2.3. Implement Repairs. Typically, expedient repair of water distribution 
systems consist of making repairs to piping systems using locally available 
materials or components from dismantled, non-critical systems. Although 
expedient repairs may not eliminate all water leaks, work crews should plan to 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
125 
 
 
repair small leaks when the tactical situation or mission permits. Consider the 
following methods when making expedient repairs to water distribution systems.

126 
 
 
5.3.3. Water Main Leaks and Breaks. Accomplish repairs to water mains as soon 
as the recovery situation permits. The repair techniques used depends on the 
location and type of leak present in the water main. If the main is underground, 
dig repair trench on both sides of the main. Ensure the repair trench is big enough 
to accommodate workers, equipment, and materials. If necessary, pump out any 
trench water capable of contaminating repair materials or the inside the water 
main. Note: Whenever work crews open a water main for repair, be sure to flush 
and disinfect the main before returning it to service. A boil water notice may need 
to be issued when returning the water line into service. 
 
5.3.3.1. Small Holes. Use wood plugs to stop small holes temporarily (replace 
wood plugs with permanent metal plugs/couplers later). Temporary wood plugs 
are an option to plug the ends of pipes up to 8 inches in diameter. Brace plugs to 
withstand the pressure in the main. For joint leaks, if caulking was used in the 
joint, re-caulk the joint to repair leaks. 
 
5.3.3.2. Cracks in Main. Cracks in the mains usually require valves be shut-off in 
the affected area, especially in severe main breaks. Notify Fire and Emergency 
Services in case of main shutoff. Consider repairing leaks in mains using 
mechanical couplings. Mechanical couplings, including joint clamps offer the 
best methods for quick, effective repairs. Mechanical-joint repair may involve 
cutting out a section of the cracked pipe and replacing it with a piece of pipe and 
mechanical couplings. Several companies manufacture mechanical-joint repair 
fittings; consult manufacturer data for selection and installation. 
 
5.3.3.3. Replacing Pipe Sections. It may be necessary to replace a pipe section due 
to leaks from cracks, holes, or severe corrosion. To replace a damaged pipe 
section, follow the damaged piping until you find an area of undamaged pipe 
section. If the break or damaged area is too long for a short insertion piece, it may 
be necessary to insert a whole length of pipe. If it is necessary to replace a pipe 
section, consider laying a parallel pipe section relative to the damage pipe, tie in 
the parallel pipe with appropriate pipefittings, and leave the damage pipe in place. 
Continue the repair as follows: 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
127 
 
 
5.3.3.3.1. Cut pipe ends square with a pipe cutter or saw and remove all burrs that 
result from cutting pipe. Clean all dirt, rust, oil, or loose scale from pipe ends. 
Check surfaces where gasket contacts the pipe to ensure that there are no 
imperfections, such as gouges or grooves that will impair the performance of the 
gasket seal. 
 
5.3.3.3.2. Measure back on each pipe end one-half of the width of the coupler and 
mark. Use these marks to center the coupler over the joint. 
 
5.3.3.3.3. Measure and cut a replacement section of pipe. Repeat deburring and 
cleaning process. 
 
5.3.3.3.4. Clean and disinfect the inside of couplings, repair pipe section, and 
other fittings, typically with a solution of hypochlorite or chlorine. Clean both 
ends of the cut water main and repair pipe sections. Note: Avoid contaminating 
couplings and repair pipe sections with soil or trench water during the installation. 
 
5.3.3.3.5. Wipe gaskets clean and lubricate gaskets and pipe ends with soapy 
water. Consider adding alcohol to soapy water in freezing weather. 
 
5.3.3.3.6. Align replacement pipe on both ends. Place coupler over pipe end and 
align with mark. Rotate coupler until gasket is flat against pipe. Repeat process 
for other side. Tighten bolts uniformly to the manufacturer recommended torque. 
 
5.3.3.3.7. Turn on the water supply and check for acceptable level of leakage. 
Flush and disinfect the affected water main section before returning it to service. 
 
5.3.3.4. Bedding and Blocking Water Mains. When repairs require replacement 
of underground pipe sections or fittings, additional bedding or thrust blocks may 
be needed to counteract the effects of the internal hydrostatic pressure and prevent 
pipe joint separation. Improper bedding or blocking can result in reoccurring leaks 
and broken water mains. Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.9 illustrate common pipe 
bedding and thrust blocking techniques. Typically, granular bedding material is 
sand, and normally set in layers not more than 6” thick and thoroughly tamped.

5.3.3.5. Tapping Water Mains. After a disaster or during a contingency, it may be 
necessary to tap into water mains to make expedient repairs or reroute essential 
service. Water mains are usually 4 inches or more in diameter, and constructed of 
PVC, ductile iron, Polyethylene, or asbestos-cement. If the involved main is less 
than 8 inches in diameter, taps should be 2 inches or smaller. Table 5.2 and Figure 
5.10 address typical water main tapping procedures. Note: Refer to tap 
manufacturer’s instructions for specific procedures. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
130 
 
 
Table 5.2. Typical Procedures for Tapping Water Mains. 
 
Step 
Procedure 
1 
Dig to expose pipe at the point where tap is to be made. Dig as close to 
the top of water main as possible. 
2 
Clean all dirt and rust off pipe at that point. 
3 
Place gasket of water-main self-tapping machine on pipe and set saddle 
of machine on the gasket. 
4 
Wrap the chain around the pipe and tighten it to clamp water main self-
tapping machine to the pipe. 
5 
Remove cap from the cylinder of machine, and place combination drill 
and tap in boring bar. 
6 
Reassemble machine by putting boring bar through the cylinder and 
tightening cap. 
7 
Open flap valve between the compartments and start drilling the hole by 
applying pressure at feed yoke and turning ratchet handle until drill 
enters the main. 
8 
When tap starts threading the hole, back off the feed yoke to prevent 
stripping threads. 
9 
Continue to turn boring bar until the ratchet handle no longer turns 
without extra force. 
10 
Remove tap from the hole by reversing the ratchet. Then, back the 
boring bar out by turning it counterclockwise. 
11 
Close the flap valve between upper and lower compartments. 
12 
Drain water from cylinder through the bypass. 
13 
Remove cap and drill tool. Place a corporation stop in the boring bar, 
ensuring that the stop is closed.  
14 
Repeat steps 6 and 7. 
15 
Turn ratchet handle to thread corporation stop into pipe. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
131 
 
 
16 
Repeat Step 13. 
17 
Remove cap from the cylinder and unbolt boring bar from the 
corporation stop. 
18 
Remove lower chamber from the pipe. 
19 
Inspect for leaks. If corporation stop leaks, tighten with suitable wrench.

5.3.4. Plumbing Leaks. If the proper fittings, material, and tools are available, 
plumbing repair can be a relatively straightforward task. However, during 
contingencies or war, the proper supplies and materials may not be available. 
Therefore, the field engineer may have to improvise using expedient methods or 
dissimilar materials to effect temporary repairs. The following paragraphs and 
illustrations in Figure 5.11 provide techniques and examples for making 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
132 
 
 
expedient or temporary repairs for small leaks in a plumbing system. Before 
making any repairs, shut off the water and relieve the pressure from the system. 
Note: Work crews should make permanent repairs as soon as practicable to 
replace the weak or defective part. Replace parts with a unit (and insulation if 
used) that is the same size and quality as the original installation. 
 
Figure 5.11. Expedient Pipe Repair Techniques. 
 
 
 
5.3.4.1. Rubber Hose or Plastic Tubing. Cut the pipe on either side of the leak 
with a hacksaw or pipe cutter. Remove the damaged pipe section and replace it 
with a length of rubber hose or plastic tubing. To do this, slip the ends over the 
pipe and fasten them with hose clamps. The inside diameter of the hose must fit 
the outside diameter of the pipe. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
133 
 
 
5.3.4.2. Sheet Rubber. Wrap the leaking area with sheet rubber. Place two sheet-
metal clamps on the pipe (one on each side). Then, fasten the clamps with the 
bolts and nuts. 
 
5.3.4.3. Electrician's Friction Tape. Wrap several layers of friction tape around 
the hole or crack, extending the tape about 2 inches above and below the leak. 
 
5.3.4.4. Wood Plugs. Similar to water main repairs, consider filling small holes in 
other water pipes with wood plugs. Drive a wooden plug into the hole after it is 
drilled or reamed. The plug will swell as it absorbs water, preventing it from being 
blown out by water pressure. 
 
5.3.5. Frozen Pipes. Pipes may freeze in temperate as well as frigid zones. In frigid 
climates, freezing presents a major problem to a water distribution system, and 
pipes are normally insulated and heated. If a building’s temperature falls below 
freezing, inside pipes may also freeze causing the pipe to break at the weakest 
point. The best way to avoid frozen pipes is to insulate or wrap lines with electrical 
heat tape. In areas where the ground is permanently frozen, water pipes are set in 
heated conduits. Pipes are typically buried below frost penetration depth in 
temperate climates where freezing is only a seasonal problem. Even with proper 
protection, some pipes may still freeze. The paragraphs below examines 
procedures for thawing above- and below-ground pipes. 
 
5.3.5.1. Heat Lamp or Blowtorch. A heat lamp or blowtorch is a good method to 
thaw aboveground pipes, but there is a risk of fire with the blowtorch, especially 
with plastic pipes. Use the following steps to thaw frozen pipes when using a heat 
lamp or blowtorch: 
 
• 
Open the faucets in the line. 
• 
Apply heat from the heat lamp or blowtorch at one end of the pipe and 
work along the entire length of the pipe (Figure 5.12). 
• 
Continue to heat the pipe until the water flows freely. Be careful not to 
overheat pipes because solder joints will break loose if the solder melts.

134 
 
 
Figure 5.12. Thawing Frozen Interior Pipes. 
 
 
 
5.3.5.2. Boiling Water and Cloth. Consider thawing pipes by wrapping burlap or 
other cloth over the frozen section and pouring boiling water over the wrappings, 
thus transmitting heat to the frozen pipe. When internal freezing is due to failure 
of the heating plant, repair the heating plant; maintain a high temperature in the 
building until the pipes thaw. 
 
5.3.5.3. Boiling Water and Thaw Pipe. Follow the steps in Table 5.3 and use the 
illustration in Figure 5.13 to thaw frozen exterior pipes. In some cases, a small 
pump may be an option to clear a piece of pipe. However, excessive pump 
pressure can cause a backup; therefore, carefully monitor this procedure. 
 
5.3.5.4. Steam Thawing. Steam thawing is often a common option for use on fire 
hydrants. In steam thawing, workers connect one end of a hose to a boiler, insert 
the other end into the hydrant through a disconnected fitting, and then gradually 
advance the hose as the steam melts the ice.

Table 5.3. Steps to Thaw Frozen Underground Pipes. 
 
Pipe Thawing Procedures 
Step 1 
Remove the pipe fittings. 
Step 2 
Insert small thaw pipe or tube into the frozen pipe as shown in 
Figure 5.13. 
Step 3 
Add an elbow and a piece of vertical pipe to outer end of the 
thaw pipe. 
Step 4 
Place a bucket under the opening to the frozen pipe. 
Step 5 
Insert a funnel into the open end of the vertical pipe. 
Step 6 
Pour boiling water into the funnel and, as the ice melts, push 
the thaw pipe forward. 
Step 7 
After the flow starts, withdraw the pipe quickly. Allow the 
flow to continue until the thaw pipe is completely withdrawn 
and cleared of ice.

136 
 
 
5.3.6. Disinfecting the Piping System. After making repairs to water supply pipes, 
clean and disinfect plumbing pipes and other parts of a water supply system 
carrying drinking water before use. Flush the system to remove dirt, waste, and 
surface water. Disinfect each unit with a chemical such as a solution of 
hypochlorite or chlorine according to established disinfection standards and 
procedures. Normally, there is little danger of contamination, and disinfection is 
not required if leaks or breaks are repaired with clamping devices while the mains 
remain full of pressurized water. 
 
5.4. Water Treatment System. The expedient restoration of water treatment 
capabilities may consist of repairs to an existing treatment plant or the installation 
of portable water treatment units. The importance of restoring the water treatment 
facility will depend upon the quality of the installation water source following an 
emergency. If the source is relatively free of contaminants, treatment plant repairs 
or setting up of portable treatment equipment may be of less importance than other 
installation repairs. If water treatment is necessary and the treatment plant is 
beyond repair, or the installation does not possess a treatment facility, it may be 
necessary to use expedient water treatment equipment. The most common 
expedient water treatment system available to CE forces is the Reverse Osmosis 
Water Purification Unit (ROWPU). 
 
5.4.1. The ROWPU purifies water by forcing water under high pressure through 
a series of membranes to eliminate impurities. The ROWPU can remove dissolved 
minerals from water. Although ROWPUs come in several sizes, the AF primarily 
uses the 1500-Gallons per Hour (GPH) unit shown in Figure 5.14. Extreme high 
and low temperatures of the feed water source will reduce the production 
capability of the ROWPU. 
 
5.4.2. Disinfection treatment is accomplished only after the water processes 
through the membrane filter elements since chlorine causes acute damage to the 
filter elements. For specific information on ROWPU operations and procedures, 
refer to T.O. 40W4-20-1. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
137 
 
 
Figure 5.14. 1500-GPH ROWPU. 
 
 
 
5.5. Water Storage System. The water storage system on an air base or beddown 
location may consist of underground or open reservoirs; large, fixed storage tanks, 
or temporary storage facilities. The most severe damage to the storage system 
could be a rupture causing loss of the stored water. Another consideration is 
sabotage by clandestine groups. Whenever possible, water storage facilities 
should be postured well within the secure area of the base or beddown setting. 
Ruptures or other damage to existing storage facilities can be sealed from the 
inside using rubber patches, epoxy, or wooden dowels if the holes are small. 
 
5.5.1. When the base’s conventional water storage facilities are damaged, or 
additional storage space is required, swimming pools and similar watertight 
facilities make excellent alternate reservoirs. Other expedient water storage 
alternatives include flexible bladders (Figure 5.15), ranging in size up to a 
50,000-gallon capacity, portable water tanks, water distribution trucks, water 
trailers, 5- and 10-gallon igloo water coolers, and 55-gallon drums. 
 
5.5.2. An aboveground reservoir can be constructed using sandbags or earthen 
berms lined with plastic sheeting to make it watertight. In addition, bear in mind 
that a considerable amount of water is stored within the distribution system 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
138 
 
 
pipelines themselves. For example, a 6-inch pipeline, two miles long contains 
approximately 16,000 gallons when full. Using shutoff valves to quickly isolate 
undamaged sections of the distribution system could mean substantial amounts of 
water saved within the pipes for future use. 
 
Figure 5.15. Temporary Water Storage Bladders. 
 
 
 
5.6. Wastewater (Sewage) Systems. Improper disposal of sewage in the 
aftermath of a disaster or enemy attack will compound base recovery problems. 
If the sewage enters a water supply, an outbreak of intestinal diseases such as 
typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea, is almost certain to occur. To prevent 
such outbreaks, CE forces may have to repair damage to existing sewer systems 
as well as provide temporary sanitation facilities. The priority of these repairs will 
be based on an estimate of potential hazard to the installation population. Basic 
classification, operation, and repair of sewage systems is addressed below: 
 
5.6.1. Classification of Air Base Sewage. Sewage may be divided into several 
classifications according to its source. These classifications will decide the 
immediate need for sewer rehabilitation. The two primary types of sewage on 
most installations are domestic sewage and storm sewage. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
139 
 
 
5.6.1.1. Domestic Sewage. Domestic sewage is the waste from toilets, lavatories, 
urinals, bathtubs, showers, laundries, and kitchens. Proper disposal of this type of 
sewage should receive first consideration in expedient repair operations. 
 
5.6.1.2. Storm Sewage. Storm sewage is the inflow of surface runoff during or 
immediately following a storm or heavy rain. Disposal of storm sewage following 
a disaster is not a high priority unless it hinders base operations or endangers lives 
by flooding critical areas. Since storm sewers are designed to catch runoff whether 
it is natural or manmade, they will also catch and collect toxic chemicals 
introduced accidentally or on purpose. For this reason, civil engineers should be 
prepared to establish blocking points at critical locations to prevent the spread of 
hazardous materials. Storm sewers may be blocked using commercially available 
plugs or sandbags. 
 
5.6.2. Sewage System Operation. The major components of the sewage system 
consist of facilities for collecting, pumping, treating, and disposing of sewage. 
The basic collecting system consists of a series of branch, lateral, main, and trunk 
sewers leading from various installation structures. Raw sewage moves through 
the collection system to a central point for treatment and eventual disposal. At any 
point along the system where gravity is not sufficient to move the sewage, a pump 
or lift station may be required. Sewage treatment plants vary in complexity 
according to the characteristics of the influent and the degree of treatment required 
prior to discharge. Effluent standards, set by national and local regulations, 
determine the degree of treatment. 
 
5.6.3. Anticipated Sewer Damage. Common problems with the sewage system 
during typical disasters such as floods and hurricanes are complete inundation of 
the system by excessive amounts of water and blockage of parts of the system by 
debris. In the extreme, earthquakes or enemy attacks can cause complete 
destruction of treatment plants and lift stations as well as ruptures of sewage lines. 
Damage sustained during hostile attacks will probably be collateral in nature since 
the sewage system is not normally a preplanned target. Specific damage could 
consist of the following: 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
140 
 
 
5.6.3.1. Sewers. Deliberate demolition to sewers by an enemy is usually limited 
to junction manholes or large mains. Stoppages caused by debris being blown and 
washed into sewers can be expected. 
 
5.6.3.2. Pumping Stations. During conflict, attackers may target pumping stations 
because they are key points, are more accessible, and are most difficult to repair. 
However, they are not likely to be damaged seriously by bombs or artillery fire 
since they offer a relatively small target. Disastrous flooding during either tropical 
storms or tornados can also prove consequential. 
 
5.6.3.3. Treatment Units. Treatment units may be damaged during a conflict by 
the demolition of machinery and other key equipment. However, they are not 
normally high-value targets due to their small size and the ability to achieve 
effective treatment results by other means. 
 
5.6.3.4. Cesspools and Septic Tanks. Damage to cesspools and septic tanks from 
sabotage or bombing is relatively unimportant. Destruction of a cesspool or septic 
tank would affect only one or a small number of properties. Their wide dispersal 
provides a large measure of safety. 
 
5.6.4. Effect of Damage. Human wastes must be properly disposed of in order to 
protect personnel. If sewage enters a water supply, an epidemic outbreak of 
intestinal diseases such as typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea is almost 
certain to follow. Existing sewer systems may have to be rehabilitated to prevent 
such mission-impacting outbreaks. 
 
5.6.5. Expedient Repair Procedures. Expedient sewer repairs should consist only 
of the minimum work required to prevent the outbreak of disease. For example, if 
the ruptured sewer line results in sewage leakage into an occupied area and does 
not threaten water sources, repairs can be delayed until emergency conditions 
subside. When damage is too widespread for expedient repair, civil engineers 
must resort to proven field sanitation methods. Development of temporary latrine 
facilities is addressed in Volume 1 of this publication series. The rehabilitation of 
a sewage disposal system requires the following actions. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
141 
 
 
5.6.5.1. Sewers. Sewer lines are the most essential item in a sewage disposal 
system. If the situation is critical, service can be restored temporarily by pumping 
from an upstream manhole, around the damaged section, and into a downstream 
manhole. If the sewer is completely stopped or badly damaged, an open channel 
can be built. Where storm and sanitary sewers are separate, it may be possible to 
divert sanitary sewage through a storm sewer to a suitable outlet. 
 
5.6.5.2. Pumping Stations. When sewage pumping stations cannot be repaired 
expeditiously using available replacement parts or parts cannibalized from other 
stations, use portable pumps as a substituted. If pumps are not available, consider 
rerouting past the lift station with pipe or open channels using gravity flow. 
 
5.6.5.3. Treatment Plants. It may be necessary to bypass severely damaged 
treatment plants. Settling and digestion tanks and filters can usually be repaired 
with standard construction materials. Sludge beds are practically indestructible. 
Machinery must be repaired by cannibalization or improvised methods. If 
compressed air is used in an activated sludge process, replacement of air 
compressors is difficult at best. However, the activated sludge plants can be 
operated as sedimentation or septic tanks. Such treatment, together with 
chlorination, provides a reasonable degree of purification. Further information 
about expedient septic systems is available in Volume 1 of this publication series. 
 
5.6.5.4. Septic Tanks. Septic tank systems (Figure 5.16) are used to treat and 
dispose of wastewater from buildings where it is not feasible to provide a 
community wastewater collection and treatment system. A septic tank speeds up 
the decay of raw sewage. It may be made of concrete, stone, fiberglass, or brick 
(lumber is used when other materials are not available), in box-section form, and 
it should be watertight. The septic tank should have a manhole and cover to give 
access for cleaning and repair and must be designed to hold 70 percent of the peak 
water demand of that facility for 24 hours and not less than 16 hours. Contingency 
rapid repair of a septic tank would normally be low priority since other options 
are usually available. However, if a septic tank is severely damaged and totally 
inoperable and other prudent options are not available, an expedient-type septic 
tank can be constructed using procedures provided in Volume 1 of this publication 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023

series. Otherwise, expedient repairs would probably be limited to unclogging 
pipes, pumping out tanks, and improving or expanding drain fields. 
 
Figure 5.16. Typical Septic Tank Details. 
 
 
 
5.6.5.5. Grease Traps. Grease traps come in countless shapes and sizes, but their 
operation is basically the same. Just as the name suggests, a grease trap catches 
grease (animal fats and oils) from kitchen wastewater. Although there are many 
different models, grease traps are typically set in the flow line of the building’s 
sewer system to catch grease and fats from kitchen and scullery sinks, preventing 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
143 
 
 
clogs in the waste pipes. Expedient repair of grease traps is usually limited to 
unclogging inlet pipes and repairing or replacing damaged traps. Service 
personnel should be trained to perform routine cleaning and maintenance of 
grease traps installed in their area(s). Figure 5.17 provides a layout of a typical 
grease trap. 
 
5.6.5.6. Additional details on water supply and wastewater systems repair 
procedures can be obtained from UFC 3-230-02 and UFC 3-240-01, Wastewater 
Collection.

5.7. Pipes and Fittings. Pipes and fittings for plumbing systems are classified 
into four basic groups: cast-iron soil pipe and fittings, galvanized steel/iron pipe 
and fittings, copper tubing and fittings, and plastic pipe. Listed in Table 5.4 and 
addressed in the following paragraphs are the characteristics and uses of pipes and 
fittings in a plumbing system. See Attachment 4 for sizes and metric equivalents. 
 
5.7.1. Cast-Iron Soil Pipe and Fittings. Cast iron is available in two different wall 
thicknesses or weights: service weight and extra-heavy weight. Use cast-iron soil 
pipes for sewers, drains, stacks, and vents in a waste system. Service weight is for 
general household use and is adequate for most military construction. Use extra-
heavy weight where liquids may corrode the pipe or where greater strength is 
needed for tall stacks or under roadways.

5.7.1.1. Types. As listed in Table 5.4 and illustrated in Figure 5.18, this pipe is 
manufactured in three different types. The hub-and-spigot pipe comes in lengths 
up to 10 feet and ranging in diameter from 2 to 15 inches. Whereas the double-
hub pipe comes in 5-foot lengths ranging in diameter from 2 to 15 inches. Hubless 
pipe comes in 10-foot lengths ranging in diameter from 1-1/2 to 8 inches. 
 
5.7.1.2. Fittings. The major types of fittings used for cast-iron pipe are Tees, Y-
branches, bends, and traps. These fittings are used for connecting hub-and-
spigot or hubless cast-iron pipes. 
 
Figure 5.18. Cast-Iron Pipes. 
 
 
 
5.7.1.2.1. Sanitary Tees are designed to carry drainage and straight Tees are used 
for vent lines (Figure 5.19). Use a tapped Tee, either sanitary or straight, to 
connect threaded-pipe branch drains or vent lines. Use a test Tee for testing a 
newly installed waste system for leaks.

Figure 5.19. Cast-Iron Tees (Ts). 
 
 
 
5.7.1.2.2. Y-branches can join one or more sanitary sewer branches or connect a 
branch to a main line. This design allows a smoother change in flow direction. 
The most common Y-branches are the 45- and 90-degree types (Figure 5.20). 
 
Figure 5.20. Cast-Iron 45- and 90-Degree Y Branches. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
147 
 
 
5.7.1.2.3. Bends are used to change the direction of a cast-iron pipeline. The 
degree of direction change is given as a common math fraction. Bends are 
designated in fractions of 1/16, 1/8, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, and 1/2 as they change the 
direction of 22 1/2, 45, 60, 72, 90, and 180 degrees, respectively. These bends can 
be regular, short sweep, or long sweep (Figure 5.21). 
 
Figure 5.21. Cast-Iron Bends. 
 
 
 
5.7.1.2.4. Every plumber knows a trap provides a water seal, which keeps sewer 
gases from entering a building through a waste outlet. The most common type is 
a P-trap. The P-trap is used in a partition to connect a drain to a waste branch. A 
running trap is used in a building's drain line when the local plumbing codes 
require that the building drain be trapped. Figure 5.22 illustrates four general 
types of cast-iron soil pipe traps. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
148 
 
 
5.7.1.2.5. Other cast iron fittings include the offset, increaser, cleanout, tucker 
coupling, and sewer thimble (Figure 5.23). Except for the tucker fitting, they are 
usable on all types of pipes.

5.7.1.2.6. Make a Hubless joint cast iron pipe repair with a neoprene sleeve and a 
stainless steel clamp. To make the Hubless joint, use the illustration in Figure 
5.24 and the following procedures: 
 
• 
Remove the neoprene sleeve from the stainless-steel clamp. 
• 
Slide the sleeve on the end of one pipe or fitting until it is firmly against 
the collar inside the sleeve. 
• 
Slide the clamp on the other pipe. 
• 
Slide the pipe end into the sleeve until it is firmly against the collar inside 
the sleeve. 
• 
Center the clamp over the sleeve and tighten with a screwdriver or 
wrench. 
 
Figure 5.24. Expedient Hubless Joint for Cast-Iron Pipe. 
 
 
 
5.7.1.3. Legacy Systems. Legacy systems containing cast-iron pressure pipes 
(also called corporation), were sometimes used for water supply mains. They may 
be hub-and-spigot pattern or have flanged ends for bolting connections. Fittings 
similar to those for cast-iron soil pipe are available. Note: Although cast-iron 
pressure pipes are seldom used today, work crews may encounter these pipes 
when making repairs to legacy systems. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
150 
 
 
5.7.2. Galvanized-Steel/Iron Pipes. Galvanized-steel/iron pipe is an option for 
hot- and cold-water supply distribution, certain drainage applications, and vent 
installations. This pipe comes in three strengths: (1) standard, (2) extra strong and 
(3) double extra strong. The definitions Schedule 40 and Schedule 80 also 
describe pipe strengths. Schedule 40 standard is most commonly used in 
plumbing. Pipe diameter sizes (nominal pipe sizes) are 1/8 inch to 12 inches, also 
referred to as iron-pipe size. The pipe comes in 21-foot lengths, threaded or 
unthreaded (Figure 5.25). Galvanized pipe should be stored in a dry place. If the 
pipe ends are threaded, they must be protected from damage. 
 
Figure 5.25. Galvanized-Steel/Iron Pipe. 
 
 
 
5.7.2.1. Fittings and Uses. Galvanized pipe fittings (Figure 5.26) are classified as 
either ordinary (standard) or drainage (recessed). Ordinary fittings are used for 
water service and venting. They range in size from 3/8-inch to 6 inches. Drainage 
fittings are used in waste systems. They have threads at a slight angle so that 
horizontal drainage pipe will slope about 1/4- inch per foot. They range in size 
from 1-1/4 to 12 inches. 
 
5.7.2.1.1. Use tees (Figure 5.27) when a pipe run branches at a 90-degree angle. 
The required tee size is determined by the through section or run, and the outlet. 
 
5.7.2.1.2. Use elbows (Figure 5.28) to change the direction of a pipeline. They 
come in a variety of sizes and patterns. The most common elbow are 90- and 45-
degree angle. Either type can be a standard or a reducing elbow. The size of an 
elbow is given first by the larger opening and then by the smaller opening.

Figure 5.28. Elbows (Ls). 
 
 
 
5.7.2.1.3. Use couplings (Figure 5.29) to connect two lengths of pipe. A standard 
or ordinary coupling connects pipes of the same size. A reducing coupling and an 
eccentric reducing coupling connects pipes of different sizes. 
 
Figure 5.29. Couplings and Extension. 
 
 
 
5.7.2.1.4. Other fittings include unions, nipples, plugs, caps, bushings and crosses 
(Figure 5.30). Use unions to join the ends of two pipes that can be turned or 
disconnected. Nipples are used to make an extension from a fitting or to join two 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
153 
 
 
fittings together. Nipples are pieces of pipe 12 inches or less in length and 
threaded on each end. Plugs and caps are for sealing off openings in other fittings 
or pipe ends. Cross fittings join two different pipelines in the same plane, making 
them perpendicular to each other. Crosses can also be side-outlet and reducing. 
Lastly, bushings are used to reduce a fitting outlet or to connect a pipe to a larger 
outlet. 
 
Figure 5.30. Other Types of Pipe Fittings. 
 
 
 
5.7.2.2. Joining Threaded Pipe. Fittings are normally screwed to the pipe after it 
is threaded, while the pipe is still in the vise. This ensures a good fit. The 
assembled pipe and fittings should then be screwed into the proper place in the 
installation. See procedures below and Figure 5.31 for joining steps: 
 
• 
Check the fitting threads for cleanliness and damage. If necessary, clean 
with a wire brush or replace. 
• 
Repeat above procedure for the pipe threads. 
• 
Apply pipe-joint compound or Teflon tape to the pipe threads only (A). 
• 
Screw the fitting on, hand tight (B). 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
154 
 
 
• 
Tighten the fitting using two pipe wrenches, one on the fitting (backup 
wrench) and the other on the pipe (C), provided no vise is available. The 
backup wrench keeps the fitting from turning. 
 
Figure 5.31. Joining Threaded Pipe. 
 
 
 
5.7.3. Copper Tubing and Fittings. Copper tubing is lightweight, easily joined, 
and corrosion resistant. It can be rigid or flexible, and classified by its wall 
thickness. Copper tubing is used for hot- and cold-water supply systems, certain 
drainage applications, and venting. While system designers generally select the 
type of copper tubing required, they consider various plumbing and mechanical 
codes in their decision-making process. This section only relates to water and 
wastewater systems. 
 
5.7.3.1. Types. Types of copper tubing include K, L, M, and DWV (Figure 5.32). 
Type “K” is a thick-walled, rigid or flexible copper tubing available in 20-foot 
lengths or 100-foot coils. Diameter sizes range from 1/4-inch to 12 inches. Type 
“L” is a medium-walled, rigid or flexible copper tubing available in 20-foot 
lengths or 100-foot coils. Diameter sizes are the same as K. Type “M” is a thin-
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
155 
 
 
walled, rigid copper tubing available in 20-foot lengths. Diameter sizes are the 
same as K and L. The DWV (drain-waste-vent) is available in 20-foot lengths 
with diameter sizes ranging from 1-1/4 to 8 inches. While K, L, and M copper 
tubing is used on various water service and distribution systems, DWV copper 
tubing is used for building drains, waste and vent lines, and sewers. 
 
Figure 5.32. Copper Tubing. 
 
 
 
5.7.3.2. Fittings. Fittings for copper tubing can be solder, flared, or compressed 
(Figure 5.33). Soldered fittings can be used with either rigid or flexible copper 
tubing. The fitting sizes are similar to galvanized steel/iron fittings. Sizes are 
identified in the same manner. Flared fittings are used with flexible copper tubing 
that has flared ends. Fitting sizes range from 3/8-inch to 3 inches in diameter. 
DWV fittings are similar to cast-iron fittings of the solder type.

Figure 5.33. Copper Tubing Solder and Compression Fittings. 
 
 
 
5.7.3.3. Joining Copper Tubing. The three primary methods of joining copper 
tubing are solder, flared joint and mechanical compression. Note: Other advanced 
joining methods and techniques likely unavailable at contingency locations are 
purposely omitted. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
157 
 
 
5.7.3.3.1. Soldered joints are used to connect rigid copper tubing. The following 
tools and materials are needed: a heating torch, 95-5 (95 percent tin and 5 percent 
aluminum) nonacid solder, soldering flux, and Emery cloth or steel wool. Review 
Figure 5.34 and the following steps when making a soldered joint: 
 
Figure 5.34. Soldering Copper Tubing Joints. 
 
 
 
• 
Inspect the end of the copper tubing to be sure it is round, free of burrs, 
and cut square. 
• 
Clean the end of the tubing and the inside of the fitting to a bright shine 
with emery cloth or fine steel wool. 
• 
Apply a thin coat of flux to the shined end of the tubing and fitting (A). 
• 
Push the fitting onto the tubing and give it a quarter turn to spread the 
flux evenly (B). 
• 
Heat the connection with a torch, applying the flame on the fitting (C). 
• 
When the flux is bubbling, apply the solder to the joint; the solder will 
flow into and completely around the joint. 
• 
Clean the joint using a clean rag. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
158 
 
 
5.7.3.3.2. A flared joint is used with flexible copper tubing. Make the flare on the 
end of the tubing with a flaring or flanging tool. Review the procedures below and 
illustration in Figure 5.35 when flaring or flanging flexible copper tubing: 
 
• 
Inspect the end of the tubing to ensure it is free of burrs and is cut square. 
• 
Remove the flange nut from the fitting and slide its unthreaded end onto 
the tubing first. 
• 
Flare the end of the tubing with either a flaring tool or a flanging tool. 
 
Figure 5.35. Flaring and Flanging Flexible Copper Tubing. 
 
 
 
5.7.3.3.2.1. For the flaring tool, loosen the wing nuts on the flaring tool and place 
the tubing in the correct size hole. Make the tubing's end even with the tool's 
surface. Then tighten the wing nuts. Finally, turn the yoke cone down into the 
tubing until the flare fills the beveled pad of the hole. 
 
5.7.3.3.2.2. For the flanging tool method, hold the flanging tool on the end of the 
tubing so that it is centered and straight. Then, using a hammer, tap the flanging 
tool until the flare fills the recess in the flanging nut. 
 
5.7.3.3.2.3. Slide the flare/compression nut up to the flared end and screw it on 
the fitting hand tight, then tighten the flare/compression nut (Figure 5.36).

Figure 5.36. Copper Tubing Flared Fitting. 
 
 
 
5.7.3.3.3. A mechanical-compression joint is used to connect a fixture's water 
supply tubing to the shutoff valves. Review Figure 5.37 and the following 
procedures when making mechanical-compression joints for copper tubing. 
 
Figure 5.37. Mechanical-Compression Joint. 
 
 
 
• 
Cut or bend the tubing to the required length. 
• 
Slide the compression nut onto the tubing. 
• 
Slide the compression ring onto the tubing. 
• 
Screw the compression nut onto the fitting by hand. 
• 
Tighten the nut. The ring compresses to form a sealed leak proof joint.

5.7.4. Plastic Pipe and Fittings. Plastic piping is lightweight and rigid or flexible 
(similar to copper tubing) and is easily joined with corrosion-resistant fittings. 
Applicable for water or waste systems, plastic piping is usable for hot- or cold-
water piping and for drain, waste, and vent piping. 
 
5.7.4.1. Types of Pipes. Generally, we classify plastic pipes by the acronym for 
the type of material from which it is made. 
 
5.7.4.1.1. Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) pipe is usually white and used only for cold-
water pipelines, sanitary drainage, and venting. It comes in 10- and 20-foot 
lengths. Diameter sizes range from 1/2 inch to 6 inches. 
 
5.7.4.1.2. Chlorinated PVC (CPVC) pipe is light or cream color and has a higher 
temperature resistance than standard PVC. Used primarily for hot-water pipelines 
but can also be used for cold-water lines. It comes in 10-foot lengths. Diameter 
sizes are 1/2 inch and 3/4 inch. 
 
5.7.4.1.3. Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) pipe is black or gray and used 
for above- and below-ground sanitary drainage and venting. It comes in 10- and 
20-foot lengths. Diameter sizes range from 1-1/4 to 6 inches. 
 
5.7.4.1.4. Polybutylene (PB) pipe is black or dark gray and used for cold-water 
lines. It is available in coils of 100 feet or more. Diameter sizes range from 3/4 
inch to 2 inches. PB pipe is costly, requires special fittings, and is not in wide use. 
 
5.7.4.1.5. Polyethylene (PE) tubing is black and often used for low-pressure cold-
water lines and sprinkler systems. It comes in coils of 100 feet. Diameter sizes 
range from 3/4 inch to 2 inches. 
 
5.7.4.2. Pipe Fittings. There are numerous types of plastic pipe fittings available 
commercially and through normal logistic channels. See Figure 5.38 for 
examples. The sizes for PVC and CPVC pipe fittings are similar to steel and 
copper fittings. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
161 
 
 
Figure 5.38. Typical Plastic Pipe Fittings. 
 
 
 
5.7.5. Joining Plastic Pipes. The most common methods for joining PVC and 
CPVC pipes and fittings are solvent cements, threading, and compression 
couplings. PE hose fittings used in cold-water sprinkler system piping are usually 
the insertable type. Note: Other joining methods and techniques likely unavailable 
at contingency locations are purposely omitted. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
162 
 
 
5.7.5.1. The solvent-cement weld joint is made by using a cleaning primer and 
solvent cement on the pipe and fitting. Solvent cement consists of a plastic filler 
(same material for each type of plastic pipe) dissolved in a mixture of solvents. 
Use the appropriate solvent cement for the type of pipe being used. The solvent 
cement melts the plastic of the pipe and the fitting to weld them together. Since 
solvent cement sets fast, a plastic pipe joint is completed quickly (Figure 5.39). 
Use the following steps to join plastic pipe with solvent cement: 
 
• 
Inspect the pipe end for burrs and the fitting for cracks. 
• 
Clean the pipe and the inside of the fitting with an authorized cleaning 
primer, using a clean rag. 
• 
Coat the outside of the pipe end and the inside of the fitting with solvent 
cement (A). 
• 
Push the pipe as quickly as possible into the fitting as far as it will go; a 
small bead of cement will be visible (B). 
• 
Give the fitting a quarter turn to spread the solvent cement evenly (C). 
• 
Hold the joint connection for about 30 seconds to be sure it is solidly set. 
• 
Wipe off all excess cement.

5.7.5.2. For flexible plastic piping (i.e., PE tubing), make the insert fitting joint 
by sliding and clamping the pipe onto the insert fitting as addressed below and 
illustrated in Figure 5.40. 
 
• 
Slide a clamp over the flexible pipe (A). 
• 
Push the pipe onto the insert fitting to the last serration (B). 
• 
Slide clamp over the pipe and tighten the clamp with a screwdriver (C). 
 
Figure 5.40. Inserting Flexible Plastic Pipe Joint. 
 
 
 
5.7.6. Joining Dissimilar Materials. During expedient repair, the goal is delivery. 
As such, the piping used depends upon the sizes that the pumps will accommodate 
and the type of piping materials available. Figure 5.41 and Figure 5.42 illustrate 
a few ways to accomplish pipe connections when working with dissimilar 
materials. In addition to the clamps and couplings shown in the illustrations, 
dielectric unions and transition fittings are also used to connect dissimilar pipe 
materials (Figure 5.43). 
 
5.7.6.1. Dielectric unions are used to connect dissimilar-metal, water supply pipes 
to prevent electrolysis (corrosion). This type of union is common when 
connecting galvanized steel/iron pipe to copper pipe. 
 
5.7.6.2. Transition fittings are common options for connecting joints between 
plastic and metallic pipes.

5.7.7. Unions and Compression Couplings. Additional options for making pipe 
connections include ground-joint unions, flange unions, plastic unions and 
compression couplings (Figure 5.44). The pipe unions are for joining the ends of 
two pipes that can be turned or disconnected. Compression couplings are 
mechanical joints designed to connect two pipe ends quickly. They are available 
for both metal and plastic pipes. Below is a brief description for making pipe 
connections using these fittings. 
 
5.7.7.1. A ground union has three distinct parts: a shoulder piece with female 
threads; a thread piece with female and male threads; and a ring (or collar) with 
an inside flange that matches the shoulder of the shoulder piece and a female 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
166 
 
 
thread that matches the male thread of the thread piece. The pipes are screwed to 
the thread and shoulder pieces. They are drawn together by the collar, making a 
gastight and watertight joint. 
 
Figure 5.44. Unions and Fittings. 
 
 
 
5.7.7.2. The flange union has two parts, each with a female thread, and screwed 
to the pipes to be joined. Nuts and bolts pull the flanges together. A gasket 
between the flanges makes a gastight and watertight joint. Plain-faced flanges 
may have male and female faces or tongue and groove faces. Regardless of the 
type of repair performed, flush and disinfect the affected pipe section when the 
repairs are completed. 
 
5.7.7.3. The compression coupler shown in Figure 5.44 is for plastic pipe repairs. 
It allows quick joint connections without the use of solder, solvent cement, glues, 
and other adhesives. Typically, no tools are required for installation. The coupling 
slips over the pipe ends and is hand tighten. Compression couplings can be used 
as a single union to connect two pipe ends or to repair longer, damaged pipe 
sections by using two couplings with a section of replacement pipe.

5.7.8. Other Types of Pipes and Fittings. 
 
5.7.8.1. Bituminous-Fiber. Bituminous-fiber pipe, often called “Orangeburg,” is 
used underground to install house-to-sewer and house-to-septic-tank waste lines 
and storm drainage lines to dry wells. Perforated pipe is used for septic tank 
disposal fields and for footing drains and other subsurface drainage. It is 
lightweight, easily joined, and corrosion resistant. This pipe may be a plain or 
perforated type. Both plain and perforated pipe comes in 5- and 8-foot lengths. 
The plain pipe ends are tapered 2 degrees from a 1/16-inch shoulder. Diameter 
sizes range from 2 to 8 inches. 
 
5.7.8.2. Concrete. Concrete pipe is used underground for sanitary and storm 
drainage pipelines. This pipe is made with cement and sand. Cement pipe is 
supplied in two grades: non-reinforced and reinforced with wire or steel bars. This 
pipe comes in various lengths and diameters. 
 
5.7.8.3. Vitrified-Clay. Vitrified-clay pipe (terra cotta) is used underground for 
sanitary and storm drainage pipelines outside of buildings. This pipe has hub-and-
spigot ends in lengths of 2, 2 1/2, and 3 feet. Diameter sizes range from 4 to 42 
inches. Clay pipe fittings are similar to cast-iron soil pipe fittings.

GAS AND LIQUID FUELS SYSTEM REPAIR 
 
6.1. Overview. Overseas military bases often have gas and liquid fuels facilities 
designed to permit continuous operation using emergency or temporary measures 
should one or more components of the receiving or dispensing system is loss from 
enemy action or other factors. This chapter briefly addresses expedient repair of 
base natural gas and petroleum fuel systems. 
 
6.2. General Information. Our ability to make expedient repairs to land-based 
gas and liquid fuel facilities and systems helps ensure emergency operation under 
adverse and demanding conditions. 
 
6.2.1. Natural gas systems usually receive gas via pipeline from local distribution 
companies to a central regulating and metering station on or near the installation. 
From there, follow-on gas distribution is through a base piping network to the end 
users. Some bases use smaller, stand-alone liquefied petroleum gas, or 
compressed natural gas tank systems for specific fueling needs around the base. 
Expedient repair of those systems is beyond the scope of this publication and 
therefore only receive cursory mention in this chapter. Personnel should refer to 
AFMAN 32-1067, Water and Fuel Systems, for additional design, and operation 
and maintenance (O&M) information for natural gas systems. 
 
6.2.2. Base petroleum fuel systems (liquid fuels) often include receiving and 
dispensing facilities, aboveground and/or underground storage tanks, ground 
vehicle fueling and aircraft fueling facilities, and a base pipeline distribution 
network. These systems provide receiving, storage, and distribution for products 
such as motor gasoline (Mogas), diesel, aviation fuels, and other commonly used 
fuels. The distribution network for natural gas and petroleum fuel are the most 
widespread component of base fuel systems and is where work crews will likely 
perform most expedient repairs. Repairs to other components such as pump 
facilities and bulk storage tanks are mostly beyond the scope of expedient repair. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
169 
 
 
6.2.3. Some gas and fuels distribution components are very similar to previously 
addressed water distribution components. However, repairing gas and fuel 
systems present additional environmental and safety hazards not present in 
repairing water systems. The potential existence of volatile liquids and vapors 
capable of producing fires, explosions, or contamination of aviation fuel are key 
concerns. These liquids and vapors are also toxic to the human body. 
 
6.2.4. Personnel should follow local contingency spill plans when responding to 
breaks in gas and fuel distribution lines. Ensure leaks/releases are reported to the 
proper authorities if they exceed applicable reportable quantity thresholds. It may 
be possible to capture gases in confined and enclosed spaces and remove standing 
volatile liquids using established spill response and cleanup protocols. Only 
emergency and cleanup personnel should be in the threat area when mitigating the 
fuel hazard (cleaned up, diluted, evaporated, or absorbed). These workers should 
avoid any action that could provide an ignition source for fuel vapors. They should 
also use approved respiratory protection and appropriate monitors or detectors to 
check for hazardous or toxic vapors. 
 
6.2.5. When making expedient repairs to gas and liquid fuels systems, determine: 
 
• 
If the damaged line is vital to mission support. 
• 
Repair priority if there is damage to more than one line. 
• 
If the distribution line can be shut-off, plugged, and abandoned. 
• 
If fire suppression, fuel removal, debris removal, and ordnance disposal 
is necessary. 
• 
If the damaged component should be replaced with a temporary system. 
• 
What safety issues need to be addressed. 
• 
What personnel, tools, and equipment are necessary to perform repairs. 
 
6.3. Natural Gas Distribution Systems. Units should rapidly respond to 
damaged natural gas systems to prevent and contain potential accidents (Figure 
6.1). The most expedient method of handling gas system leaks is to shut off the 
gas supply at main feeder points. Selective system isolation is usually a good 
option until time and resources permit making the necessary permanent repairs. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
170 
 
 
6.3.1. Emergency Cut-Off Procedures. If it is not possible to shut the gas off using 
the existing valves, gas main bags or flow stoppers may be required. Gas main 
bags are plugs with a bladder inside and a synthetic fiber casing that workers insert 
into a gas main and inflate until they fill the pipe and halt the gas flow. To seal a 
main with a gas main bag, insert the inflatable device through a hole in the main 
(a hole created by damage, removal of a riser, or access port). Inflate the bag 
through a piece of attached tubing until it fills the pipe and stops the gas flow. To 
use a gas stopper, squeeze the stopper frame together and inserted it into the hole 
in the gas main. After the stopper is in the pipe, use the wire levers attached to the 
frame to restore its circular shape. Then, adjust the gas stopper to shut off the gas 
flow. In larger mains, it may be safer to use both bag and stopper. 
 
Figure 6.1. Ruptured Natural Gas Line Fire. 
  
 
 
6.3.2. Expedient Repairs of Natural Gas Distribution Systems. As mentioned 
earlier, it is best to simply cut off gas systems and make permanent repairs later 
when the emergency has subsided. However, certain conditions may call for some 
immediate expedient repairs to prevent danger to personnel or to provide limited 
gas service. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
171 
 
 
6.3.2.1. Venting of Gas Accumulations. After shutting off the main gas supply, 
immediately check buildings and other areas for the presence of dangerous gas 
accumulations. The presence of gas should be detected using special gas detection 
devices such as a combustible gas indicator. Individuals cannot depend on their 
sense of smell to detect leaks because gas can lose its odor while traveling through 
the ground. Be sure to vent any gas accumulations to the outside to reduce the 
potential for asphyxiation or explosion. 
 
6.3.2.2. Repair of Broken or Punctured Gas Lines. There may be conditions 
following an emergency when gas must be available to certain facilities for 
essential operations. For example, the dining hall may have no alternate method 
of preparing food for the recovery force, or the hospital may need hot water for 
crucial medical services and have no other source of energy for water heaters. 
During periods of cold weather, gas may be the only source of heat for certain 
mission-critical installation facilities. Under any of these conditions, leaking or 
ruptured gas lines may require patching. If the leak is small and involves low-
pressure gas pipes, workers may use a sealant in conjunction with a pressure mold 
to close the opening. The sealant should be a product that does not break down in 
the presence of natural gas. Consider using various mechanical clamps to repair 
larger leaks and pipe breaks. 
 
6.3.2.3. Replacing Gas Lines. Refer to UFC 3-430-05, Natural Gas and Liquefied 
Petroleum Gas (LPG) Distribution Pipelines, for specific design requirements for 
natural gas distribution systems. Consider the following precautions when 
replacing distribution line sections: 
 
6.3.2.3.1. Do not install distribution system lines under a building. 
 
6.3.2.3.2. Do not lay lines in the same trench with other utilities to preclude the 
possibility of leaking gas following along or collecting in other conduits and 
creating an explosion hazard. 
 
6.3.2.3.3. For the same reason as above, gas lines should be above other utilities 
whenever they cross, if practicable. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
172 
 
 
6.3.2.3.4. Avoid laying gas lines under paved streets or in other locations subject 
to heavy traffic whenever practicably avoidable. Whenever it is necessary to 
locate gas lines in such locations, protect the lines with a suitable casing or by 
burying to a depth to provide at least 2 feet of cover over the top of the pipe. 
 
6.3.2.3.5. Maintain sufficient clearance between plastic mains and any steam, hot 
water, power lines, or other source of heat, to avoid temperatures in excess of 140 
degrees Fahrenheit for thermoplastics or 150 degrees Fahrenheit for thermo-
setting epoxy resin pipe. 
 
6.3.2.4. Safety. The potential for asphyxiation or explosion during encounters 
with gas leaks makes it imperative that repair crews exercise extreme caution. 
Personnel should not enter confined areas with high gas accumulations unless they 
are equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus. Do not use open flame from 
cutting torches, cigarette lighters, or similar devices in a gaseous environment. 
Additionally, repair crews must be careful not to generate sparks near a gas leak. 
A good rule of thumb is not to enter any area where the mixture of air and gas is 
at or approaches the lower explosive limit. Taking a few extra minutes to ventilate 
the area will greatly reduce the danger to personnel. Additional safety precautions 
include: 
 
• 
Remove the pressure from all the lines before working on them. 
• 
Never smoke in areas where crews are installing or repairing gas piping; 
it is not permissible. 
• 
Never use matches to test for gas leaks. 
• 
Locate the meter and the riser pipes some distance from electric meters, 
switches, fuses, and other equipment. 
• 
Install adequate pressure-relief valves on air compressors. 
• 
Test all replaced line for leaks with appropriate procedures prior to 
returning to service. 
 
6.3.2.5. Leak Detection Measures. Natural gas can be detected using special gas 
detection devices (Figure 6.2). There are also other methods to detect gas leaks—
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
173 
 
 
like heavy insect activity (swarming), hissing sound, unusual improvement or 
deterioration in surrounding vegetation, and odor.  
 
Figure 6.2. Common Gas Leak Detection Devices. 
 
 
 
6.3.2.5.1. Although natural gas is odorless, gas companies and DOD plants inject 
odor additives into the system to warn the public and aid in leak identification. 
These additives produce a rotten egg or sulfur odor when released into the air. 
However, be aware that a lack of odor is not a reliable indicator of the absence of 
a gas leak. The odor of the gas could be filtered out as the gas passes through 
certain soils, or the odor may be modified by other vapors within a sewer system. 
Therefore, reports of gas leaks should be investigated using leak detection devices 
such as a Combustible Gas Indicator or Flame Ionization Detector. Refer to the 
manufacturer’s operating manual for specific leak detector operation. 
 
6.3.2.5.2. Another effective way to pinpoint the location of small leaks on exposed 
lines involves using a spray bottle of soapy water. The soapy liquid will bubble 
when it contacts a leak. 
 
6.4. Petroleum Fuels Systems. An installation’s petroleum fuels system is a key 
utility because its loss or degradation could immediately affect aircraft sortie 
generation. Normally, bases have liquid fuels products piped directly onto the 
base or delivered by tank truck, rail car, or barge (Figure 6.3). The fuel system 
has two primary components: storage facilities and distribution systems. Refer to 
AFMAN 32-1067 and UFC 3-460-01, Design: Petroleum Fuel Facilities, for 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
174 
 
 
specific design requirements for liquid fuels systems. Refer to UFC 3-460-03, 
Operation and Maintenance: Maintenance of Petroleum Systems, for inspection 
and testing requirements to keep systems operational. 
 
Figure 6.3. Notional Fuel System Storage and Dispensing Scheme. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
175 
 
 
6.4.1. Storage Facilities. Most installations have several days of storage capacity 
for major fuel products. Bulk fuels storage methods vary considerably from 
installation to installation. At some installations, large, fixed storage tanks are 
located aboveground (Figure 6.4) and underground. Conversely, at many 
contingency locations, fuel storage is in lower profile, collapsible, fabric tanks 
(Figure 6.5), and sometimes dispersed. As previously addressed, wartime damage 
to large, fixed storage tanks are not usually expediently repairable. However, 
engineer forces may be able to accomplish minor repair for superficial damage 
and berm reconstruction. For collapsible fabric tanks, units will likely patch or 
replace any damaged tanks. 
 
6.4.2. Distribution System. Fuels distribution includes pumping facilities, 
pipelines, and dispensing points. The construction of most fixed or land-based 
fuels distribution systems makes them relatively safe from natural disasters other 
than flooding. The major damage that the distribution system might receive would 
more likely result from an enemy attack during wartime. Damage impact may be 
lessened at installations where the distribution system is interconnected. As a 
protective measure, most control valves at several overseas locations are located 
in pits in order to limit their exposure to direct impact during an attack. 
 
6.4.2.1. Pumping Stations. Fuel pumping stations may not be considered primary 
targets during an enemy attack. However, anticipate some losses to pumping 
capability from collateral damage, though it is likely the system will retain some 
capacity to pump fuel. 
 
6.4.2.2. Pipelines. Most fuel pipelines are essentially all welded steel pipe. Some 
semi-permanent systems use spoolable, steel-reinforced pipeline with bolted 
connections; some expeditionary systems have hose connections. However, since 
distribution network piping is the most extensive element of the fuels system, it is 
more likely this element will experience damage during an attack. The impact of 
such damage will be less at installations with looped distribution systems. 
 
6.4.2.3. Dispensing Points. Dispensing points range from vehicle fill stands to 
concrete encased aircraft hydrant refueling systems. The fill stands service fuels 
tank trucks for refueling aircraft at most locations. Expect damage to fill stands as 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
176 
 
 
a collateral effect of weapons detonation. Hydrant refueling systems, however, 
because of their "hardness," should remain relatively intact. 
 
Figure 6.4. Fuels Tank Farm. 
 
 
 
Figure 6.5. Collapsible Fabric Tanks at Contingency Location. 
 
 
 
6.4.3. Fuels System Repairs. Most base fuels systems have a certain amount of 
redundancy. If after an attack, part of the fuels system is undamaged, isolation and 
valving may partially restore fuel service to support the flying mission. For repairs 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
177 
 
 
to piping, valves, and other elements of the distribution system, engineers will 
have to think in terms of expedient repairs similar to water systems and use 
whatever spare parts and materials currently exist in bench stock or special levels. 
However, unlike water systems, water and fuels system repair crews will have to 
be especially concerned with toxicity, flammability, and compatibility issues. The 
volatile nature of the fuels system contents complicates any damage repairs. 
Avoid getting jet fuel or gasoline on the skin and clothing; severe chemical burns 
may result if they remain in contact with the skin. Vapors from all petroleum 
products constitute fire and explosion hazards and are toxic to the human body. 
Vapors from petroleum products have caused fires or explosions because the 
vapors are heavier than air and settle in low places such as tanks or pits. The 
vapors will remain in these low places indefinitely unless removed by ventilation. 
Consult AFMAN 91-203, Air Force Occupational Safety, Fire, and Health 
Standards, for methods to eliminate personnel hazards associated with exposure 
to liquid fuels and vapor concentrations. Water and other foreign materials can 
contaminate aviation fuels, so exercise care to properly clean and maintain the 
work area. 
 
6.4.3.1. The Water and Fuels Expedient Repair System (WaFERS) provides the 
tools, parts, and materials to quickly repair valve and line failures resulting from 
an attack or disaster. The WaFERS (along with associated instructions and related 
information) is being fielded and replaces legacy expedient repair systems. 
 
6.4.3.2. Whether work crews use isolation or expedient repair methods, it is 
critical to perform frequent checks of the system to ensure continued system 
operability. This includes inspections of isolation points, temporary repairs, and 
the remaining serviceable portions of the system. 
 
6.4.3.3. Watch for leaks or drips in aboveground pipelines when performing other 
maintenance tasks. Leaks in underground pipelines is sometimes evident by fuel 
surfacing on the ground, fuel runoff in the storm drainage system, fuel in 
underground pits or manholes, dead vegetation, or the continuous odor of fuel in 
a particular area. For information on permanent repairs to fuels systems, refer to 
UFC 3-460-03.

EXPEDIENT ELECTRICAL REPAIRS 
 
7.1. Introduction. After an attack or disaster, power for airfield lighting, 
navigational aids, communications centers, C2 nodes, medical facilities, and other 
important activities may need restoration for the installation to resume its 
operational mission. If the attack or disaster resulted in downed or damaged 
electrical lines, the repair or isolation of life-threatening electrical hazards should 
receive high priority. This chapter addresses CE basic considerations and 
expedient repair for electrical utilities. When expedient electrical repairs become 
necessary, be sure to adhere to requirements in AFMAN 32-1065 and related 
safety criteria. Additionally, consider other criteria in UFCs such as UFC 3-520-
01, Interior Electrical Systems, UFC 3-530-01, Interior and Exterior Lighting 
Systems and Controls, UFC 3-550-01, Exterior Electrical Power Distribution, 
and UFC 3-550-07, Operation and Maintenance (O&M): Exterior Power 
Distribution Systems. 
 
 
 
7.2. Safety Considerations. The AF Form 1213, Civil Engineer Energized 
Electrical Work Permit, is required to authorize the performance of energized 
work meeting the intent of NFPA 70E and the Air Force Risk Management 
Framework. Additionally, UFC 3-560-01 identifies additional hazard/risk 
category classifications for work tasks. Detailed safety procedures for electrical 
repair operations, including Arc Flash protection are contained in AFMAN 32-
1065 and UFC 3-560-01. Arc Flash protection is required for all personnel 
working on or near exposed energized electrical equipment operating at 50 volts 
or more. 
 
 
NOTICE 
Work on energized electrical equipment is prohibited except in 
circumstances justified and approved by the BCE or equivalent. 
(AFMAN 32-1065) 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
179 
 
 
7.2.1. According to AFMAN 32-1065, supervisors must properly equip and train 
workers to correctly use and maintain tools and PPE. When ensuring workers 
properly wear PPE, give special focus to rubber insulating protective equipment 
(rubber gloves, sleeves, line hoses, hoods, and covers) and hotline tools. 
 
7.2.2. Another essential safety concern is proper system documentation for 
configuration management and future troubleshooting (i.e., redlining one-line 
diagrams with changes and dates) after repairs. Expedient repairs resulting in 
system alterations or modifications can potentially lead to serious safety issues if 
not properly documented. In accordance with AFMAN 32-1065, supervisors must 
not authorize or permit alterations or modifications to equipment or protective 
device settings without adequate engineering guidance and study. 
 
7.2.3. System safety devices help protect personnel and prevent equipment 
failures (overcurrent, short circuit, surge protection). Failing to maintain, 
bypassing, or making safety devices inoperative without proper authorization 
increases risk to life safety and can potentially lead to future system failures. 
 
7.2.3.1. Maintaining surge arresters is especially important to limit overvoltages 
and bypass the related current surge to a ground system that absorbs most of the 
energy. An overvoltage condition can result from a fault in the electrical system, 
a lightning strike, or a surge voltage related to load switching. Note: Consider all 
surge arrester equipment as loaded to full circuit potential, unless positively 
disconnected from the circuit. Be sure the permanent ground conductor is intact 
before performing any work. 
 
7.2.3.2. Any improper or inadequate maintenance on overcurrent protective 
devices can increase opening time of the device, thus increasing incident energy. 
Where equipment is not properly installed or maintained, PPE selection based on 
incident energy analysis, or the PPE category method may not provide adequate 
protection from arc flash hazards. 
 
7.2.4. Bottom line, efforts should emphasize not only repairing the power system, 
but also restoring it to ensure the safety and security of personnel and the mission. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023

7.3. Components of Electrical System. The electrical system supporting a 
typical installation consists of three components: production, distribution, and 
interior wiring. Consider each component in terms of its anticipated damage 
during a contingency and the expedient repairs needed to mitigate the damage. 
 
7.3.1. Production Systems. At overseas installations, electrical power supply is 
either by base power plants or by commercial sources. In the Continental United 
States, a commercial grid most likely provides primary power. If there is an 
interruption in the commercial source, usually the only alternative is to disconnect 
the impaired power source from the distribution system and substitute generators 
to power vital facilities. All mission-essential facilities should have dedicated 
standby generators with an automatic transfer capability to maintain operations in 
the event the prime power is lost. 
 
7.3.2. Distribution Systems. The power distribution system may consist of 
substations, switchgear, and utility lines that are either overhead or underground. 
Overhead power lines and the associated utility poles are likely to suffer extensive 
damage during a hurricane, tornado, or enemy attack. An underground system, 
although better protected from the high winds common to hurricanes and 
tornadoes, is still vulnerable to the effects of an earthquake, flooding, or enemy 
munitions. The three basic distribution systems are radial, loop, and network. Any 
combination of these three systems can exist at most installations. 
 
7.3.2.1. Radial System. The radial layout is one in which a mainline is established 
through the approximate center of an installation and branch lines are run from 
the mainline to power various facilities. Figure 7.1 illustrates a basic radial layout. 
The primary disadvantage of the radial layout is that a break in the mainline from 
the power source results in a complete loss of power to all branch lines and 
facilities on the installation. Thus, the radial system is less effective since it is 
susceptible to extreme weather conditions, war damage, or sabotage. However, 
since the radial system requires considerably less material, labor, and time to 
construct, radial systems are often the option used during a contingency beddown.

181 
 
 
Figure 7.1. Basic Radial Layout. 
 
 
 
7.3.2.2. Loop System. A loop layout supplies power to a facility from more than 
one direction (Figure 7.2). Note that a break in the loop will not cause complete 
power failure since the base can still distribute power through the other section of 
the loop. Thus, a loop system has an inherent capability to prevent complete power 
loss of all facilities. Faults in the circuit can be isolated and repaired without large 
disruption of service. Also, the loop layout often distributes power with less 
voltage drop. The primary disadvantage of the loop system is it requires more 
material and time to construct than radial systems.

182 
 
 
Figure 7.2. Basic Loop Layout. 
 
 
 
7.3.2.3. Network System. A network system is simply a merger of both the radial 
and loop systems (Figure 7.3). It uses the independent feeder system of the radial 
system to supply power to distribution transformers while also paralleling the 
secondary lines used in the loop concept. This configuration capitalizes on the 
strong individual points of both radial and loop systems, thereby allowing

optimum flexibility and efficiency. Table 7.1 lists basic characteristics of 
electrical systems.

7.3.3. Interior Wiring. The “third leg” of the electrical system after transmission 
and distribution is the interior wiring. It generally consists of the wiring, switches, 
outlets, circuit breakers, and other electrical accessories located within a building 
after the service entrance interface. 
 
7.4. Repairing Electrical Systems. After an initial damage assessment of the 
electrical system following an attack or disaster, the next action should be the 
isolation of those damaged areas presenting life-threatening hazards to personnel 
or posing a potential for additional property damage. Once initial isolation is 
accomplished, UCC personnel, using installation utility plans and maps, 
determine the best way to restore electrical power to vital installation facilities. 
Typically, work crews accomplished this by rerouting power lines to bypass 
damaged areas. After damage assessment data is posted to the installation utility 
maps, the UCC should be able to direct electrical system rerouting quickly using 
the existing, undamaged circuits. When rerouting around damaged areas, 
remember the use of non-standard materials may be an option for a provisional or 
temporary repair until permanent repairs can be accomplished, provided they do 
not jeopardize safety. If capable of carrying the required loads, consider 
substituting wires and cables of different sizes or those normally designed for 
other uses as expedient power lines. Note the use of non-standard materials as a 
provisional repair and be sure to conduct a regular review of the minimum 
available shop materials. Strictly adhere to electrical safety requirements outlined 
in mandatory guidance and ensure proper “phasing” of conductors is 
accomplished. Additionally, consider salvaging conductors, wire, and other 
components from unimportant or abandoned facilities. 
 
7.4.1. Power Production Repairs. The extent of damage to an independent power 
production plant on the installation will vary with the type of emergency that has 
occurred. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, are likely to cause 
structural damage to the plant as well as disrupt the plant’s connections to the 
distribution system. An enemy attack will probably cause structural damage and 
disruption of connections to the distribution system. The attack may produce 
damage to other components of the power system, e.g., demolished control 
equipment, broken turbine blades, and shattered insulators and bushings. In 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
186 
 
 
repairing such damage, take full advantage of bench stocks maintained by each 
power plant or draw on base supply sources. As a last resort, try cannibalization. 
 
7.4.1.1. Portable generators, as an alternate power source, will probably be in 
short supply, making it imperative that units properly position and maintain these 
vital assets. Generators should be limited to providing power to only those 
facilities that are crucial to base operations. Use AFMAN 32-1062, Electrical 
Systems, Power Plants and Generators, to determine those facilities that are 
authorized emergency or standby generators. 
 
7.4.1.2. Consider damaged or inoperative generators as a source of spare parts. 
Reassemble components and parts from several damaged generators to produce 
one usable machine. Equipment other than disabled generators may serve as a 
source of repair parts, e.g., salvage injectors from a diesel engine in a destroyed 
vehicle and may be adaptable to a generator engine. If available, consider using 
WRM generators if they are compatible with the existing voltages. 
 
7.4.1.3. Since renewable energy sources are becoming more prevalent at 
contingency locations, consider how Photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems 
can affect damage repair processes and worker safety. 
 
7.4.1.3.1. Verify that the grid connected renewable has dropped out and isolated 
prior to working on utility lines. However, this is not necessarily the case for off 
grid or microgrid/islanded applications. This can cause some degree of a safety 
risk if the PV system continues to produce power after other distributed resources 
have been destroyed or drop out for some reason. This will potentially keep lines 
energizes when they are assumed to be de-energized. 
 
7.4.1.3.2. With the development of microgriding/paralleling base generation 
sources, and renewable sources that normally drop out upon loss of power, plans 
should include methods to reestablish the system. These systems can all be 
unique; in the event of a microgrid, as a part of the design phase, develop or 
provide an emergency plan for review and system restoration along with monthly, 
quarterly, and annual testing requirements.

7.4.2. Power Distribution Repairs. Some local municipal utilities or commercial 
utility companies can perform electrical system repairs via contract; this may not 
be the situation at some overseas bases or contingency locations. CE expedient 
repairs to power distribution systems depend on the damage involved and 
availability of spare parts. Most distribution systems are composed of items such 
as distribution cables, poles, insulators, capacitors, cross arms, switchgear, and in 
many cases, transformers. Only a few items within the electrical distribution 
system lend themselves to repair. Items such as distribution cables, grounding 
wires, guywires, anchors, service entrances, and occasionally transformers fall 
into this category. Depending on conditions at the contingency location, 
distribution cables may be installed overhead, laid on the ground, or buried 
underground. The method used often relies on the availability of time, materials, 
and labor. In addition, local threat conditions and degree of system damage may 
also be factors. The following paragraphs provide a brief review of overhead, on 
grade, and underground power distribution and repairs. Personnel should consult 
the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), Personnel should consult the 
National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), normally referred to as IEEE C2, and 
the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) standards for specific information 
and requirements. 
 
7.4.2.1. Overhead Conductors. As a temporary repair expedient, BCEs may 
permit work crews to hang overhead power lines from trees, existing structures, 
or new poles. In some instances, cutting the damaged line on both sides of the 
destruction and bridging the area with new cable may be necessary. In any case, 
work crews should discuss the plan of operation in detail before stringing or 
removing deenergized conductors and overhead ground wires. Explain the type 
of equipment used, grounding procedures, crossover methods, safe clearance 
requirements, and other pertinent operations. Refer to UFC 3-560-01 and UFC 3-
550-07 for additional guidance for performing aerial line work. 
 
7.4.2.1.1. Vertical Clearances. Table 7.2 list general vertical clearances for wires, 
conductors, and cables above ground. Each clearance has additional variations 
based on pole position, area location, vehicle height, sag, emergency installation, 
and other factors. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023

7.4.2.1.2. Vertical Conductor Spacing. Vertical spacing is the clear distance 
between conductors, supported on vertical racks or separate brackets. Six-inch 
minimum spacing is required for spans up to and including 200 feet while 12-inch 
minimum spacing is required for spans over 250 feet (Table 7.3). Always leave a 
clear space at the top of an electrical pole. This distance is equal to the wire 
spacing, that is, 6 inches for 200-foot spans and less and 12 inches for spans 
greater than 200 feet. Note: Expediently installed utility poles at initial 
contingency locations often do not use cross arms and braces. Instead, workers 
may hang conductors directly on the pole, one above the other.

7.4.2.2. Wood Utility Poles. Part of the distribution system may include utility or 
power poles. Workers might need to install wood utility poles to replace war-
damaged, storm-damaged, insect-damaged, or decayed poles. Use solid wood 
poles for electric distribution lines. Do not use laminated wood poles for electric 
distribution lines. The poles used in a distribution system should consist of a good 
grade of timber that will last. For example, some pressure-treated species (e.g., 
Texas Southern Pine) may last 35 to 50 years. Conversely, untreated timber such 
as soft pine may last only a couple of years and have a useful life of only one 
season under unfavorable conditions. However, the fact that a pole is in good 
condition is not proof that it can satisfactorily support the line. Poles must 
withstand column loadings as well as transverse loads from wind and turns in the 
line. Natural wood poles and sawn wood structural members, cross arms, and 
braces should meet the requirements in the NESC and IEEE Standards, and the 
permitted stress level requirements of American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) 05.1-2017, Wood Poles: Specifications and Dimensions. Note: Concrete 
or steel poles may be justified for medium-voltage distribution circuits where 
wood poles do not provide adequate strength, or where climatic conditions cause 
wood poles to deteriorate rapidly. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
190 
 
 
7.4.2.2.1. Pole Height. The height of a given utility pole is governed by vertical 
clearance requirements both above and below the proposed conductors. Near 
airfields, poles should be kept low, yet high enough to provide adequate clearance 
over streets and roads. Corner poles, transformer poles, and the like are usually 
heavier and sometimes higher than line poles. 
 
7.4.2.2.2. Pole Holes. If new poles are to be set adjacent to poles being dismantled, 
new holes should be dug. Power tools are available for digging, such as power 
borers or augers, and only qualified personnel must use these tools. Rock cutting 
drills are generally a safer alternative than the use of explosives, when 
encountering rock. It may be necessary to dig pole holes by hand if power diggers 
are unavailable or not usable. Scope the area where poles are to be set and mark 
all the utilities identified. Take special care when digging close to underground, 
energized cables and circuits. 
 
7.4.2.2.3. Setting Poles. Crews can set or install the poles by hand, with a crane, 
or by using a nearby pole as a gin pole. Set the poles according to the ground 
conditions. Pole-setting depths can vary dependent upon whether the ground is 
normal firm ground, swampy, or rocky. Ideally, poles should be set deep enough 
to develop their full bending strength at the ground line. Table 7.4 lists common 
setting depths for poles in soil and solid rock. If poles are set on the side of streets, 
roads, or highways, locate the poles a sufficient distance from the street side of 
the curb to avoid contact by ordinary vehicles using and located on the traveled 
way. For a redirectional curb, this horizontal distance should not be less than 6 
inches from the street side of the curb.

7.4.2.3. Guys (Wires and Anchors). Expedient utility pole repair often involves 
replacing or resetting guywires and anchors while bracing existing poles or raising 
new poles. In new work, crews should generally install guys before stringing line 
wires. In reconstruction work, they should install guys before making any changes 
in the line wires, while at the same time being careful not to place excessive pull 
on the pole and wires already in position. Improperly or inadequately guyed power 
lines will soon begin to sag, degrading the reliability of the line. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
192 
 
 
7.4.2.3.1. When replacing guy wires, determine the condition of the pole before 
removing the old guy wire. If the pole is weak, brace it securely before effecting 
any changes in pole strains. Make sure the guy wire is installed so there is minimal 
interference with the climbing space on the pole, and guys should clear all 
energized wires. In some cases, it may be necessary to install a guy hook to 
prevent the guy from slipping down the pole. Position the hooks so they do not 
interfere with climbing and cannot be used as steps. Where guys are liable to cut 
into the surface of a pole, protect the pole by installing a guy plate at the 
attachment point. Ensure workers well secure the plate to the pole to prevent the 
possibility of personal injury when climbing up or down the pole. 
 
7.4.2.3.2. When workers install guys near roadways, position them so they do not 
interfere with street or roadway traffic. Guys located near streets should be 
equipped with yellow traffic guards (sometimes called "anchor shields"). Any guy 
wires containing snarls or kinks should not be used for line work, and it is 
preferable to use guy wires of the correct length to avoid unnecessary splices. 
 
7.4.2.3.3. The type of anchor used in these repairs must provide suitable resistance 
to uplift and is therefore dependent on the condition of the soil. For most cases, 
the suitable anchor is an expanding type because most lines are installed in 
ordinary soils. However, rock, sandy soil, or swamp conditions may prevail. 
Figure 7.4 illustrates common anchors utilized in various soil types. Table 7.5 
indicates suitable anchor types based on a range of soils from hard to soft. While 
the soil descriptions are not an industry standard, manufacturers are familiar with 
this and other similar classifications.

7.4.2.4. Cables Laid on the Ground. During beddown at initial contingency 
locations, primary and secondary electrical distribution cables are often laid on 
the ground to save time. At established locations, workers making expedient 
repairs to existing systems may also lay distribution cables directly on grade. In 
either situation, the cables should be guarded or otherwise located so they do not 
unduly obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic and are appropriately marked. 
Note: NESC rules indicate power cables operating above 600V to ground must 
have a continuous metallic shield, sheath, or concentric neutral that is effectively 
grounded. At a splice or joint, the current path of the metallic shield, sheath, or 
neutral must be continuous, but need not be concentric. 
 
7.4.2.4.1. Where cables cut across roads or pathways, protect them from 
mechanical damage using aboveground shielding or route the cables under the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
195 
 
 
roadway. One method to temporarily shield or protect power cables crossing 
roadways is to use a commercial cable protector as shown in Figure 7.5. 
 
Figure 7.5. Commercial Cable Protector across Roadway. 
 
 
 
7.4.2.4.2. Another method of crossing roadways is to create a cable raceway under 
the road using PVC pipe (Figure 7.6). Schedule 40 PVC conduit with a diameter 
of 3 to 4 inches is suitable for expedient raceways under crossings. In applications 
for which excessively high roadway temperatures are expected, use Schedule 80 
PVC if available. For average temperatures over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the 
number of cables per raceway should be limited to three to prevent insulation 
overheating. In addition, the raceway in this application must also have at least 60 
percent air space in its section to reduce the possibility of overheating. The cables 
on both sides of the road are protected from foot traffic by sandbags. If 
anticipating follow-on road improvements or upgrades, consider running the 
cables in commercial-grade conduit under roadway or burying the cables deeper.

7.4.2.5. Existing Buried Electrical Cables. Use AF GeoBase Program data layers 
and area utility maps to help locate existing buried power cables and nearby 
utilities as accurately as possible. Locate and scope for buried cables along any 
intended digging areas. Use caution when excavating near or exposing direct-
burial electric underground cables. If the depth of all direct-burial cables is 
known, consider using power-digging equipment for excavating all but the last 12 
inches of cover over the cables. Remove the remaining cover using hand-digging 
tools with fiberglass reinforced plastic handles. Where the depth of direct-burial 
cables is not known, do not use power-digging equipment, except to break and 
remove the surface pavement. Workers should refer to UFC 3-560-01 for 
additional information relating to locating buried electrical cables. Other 
precautions for direct-burial cables include: 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
197 
 
 
• 
Do not use probe rods or bars to locate underground cables. 
• 
Avoid damaging cable insulation when uncovering cables. 
• 
Protect all exposed cables against damage in work area using boards or 
other nonconductive materials. 
• 
Do not stand, sit, kneel, or lean on unprotected cables. 
 
7.4.2.6. Direct-Burial Cables. When time and labor become available, consider 
burying direct-burial cables previously laid on the ground. Burying the cables can 
enhance personnel safety, protect the cable from damage, and improve the cable’s 
current-carrying ability. Include the following when planning for cable burial: 
 
• 
Exposed to the least disturbance practical. 
• 
In as straight a line as practical. 
• 
Allow safe access for construction, inspection, and maintenance. 
• 
Planned trenching or boring path will not interfere with proposed or 
existing structures. 
• 
Avoids unstable soil such as mud and shifting or corrosive soils. 
• 
Protected from natural hazards. 
 
7.4.2.6.1. Before trenching operations, be sure to scope and mark all appropriate 
areas showing the exact location of existing utility lines. Ensure the ditching 
machine has required safety devices and operations are safe and efficient. When 
possible, excavate trenches in increments that minimize the length of open 
trenches. Consider removing spoil daily to an area where it is not a safety hazard. 
 
7.4.2.6.2. When trenching for direct-burial cable, the bottom of the trench should 
be relatively smooth, undisturbed earth; well-tamped earth; or sand. Do not lay 
cables directly on sharp rocks or in very rocky soil. For excavations in rock or 
rocky soils, lay the cable on a protective layer of well-tamped backfill. If the soil 
is very rocky and the area will be trafficked, then a layer of sand or rock- free soil 
may be necessary as backfill above the cables. As a minimum, the backfill within 
4 inches of the cable should be free of materials that could damage the cable. 
Avoid using machine compaction within 6 inches of the cable. Consider laying 
down underground warning/marking tape 12 inches or less below grade along the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
198 
 
 
length of the line to alerts workers there is an existing high voltage line, especially 
at locations where the maps may not be current. Consult the NESC for additional 
instructions for trenching and other cable burial options. 
 
7.4.2.6.3. The burial depth for direct-buried cables should be adequate to prevent 
cables from being disturbed or damage by surface digging or usage. The NESC 
and IEEE Standards provide adequate burial depths for direct-buried cables and 
conductors (Table 7.6). Exception: Where conflicts with other underground 
facilities exist, street and area lighting cables operating at not more than 150V to 
ground may be buried at a depth not less than 18 inches.

7.4.2.7. Pole-Mounted Power Transformers. If the damage is not too extensive, 
electricians may be able to repair certain unserviceable or impaired transformers. 
Cracks or holes in the tank can be patched by welding, provided testing indicates 
that internal windings have not been compromised. Return the transformers to 
service after being thoroughly dried and replacing lost or contaminated oil. Keep 
in mind that oil from damaged transformers must be filtered before being reused

in circumstances justified and approved by the BCE or 
equivalent. (AFMAN 32-1065)

and that motor oil is not a satisfactory substitute for transformer use (a transformer 
requires a highly refined mineral oil free from moisture or other impurities). 
 
7.4.2.7.1. At some contingency locations, there may not be sufficient spare 
transformers available to provide a one-for-one replacement for damaged units. 
For example, you may not have a single-phase transformer with the capacity for 
the required load. In such a case, it may be necessary to parallel two smaller 
transformers in order to supply the load (Figure 7.7). This expedient solution will 
solve an immediate problem, but it is not cost effective. Replace this transformer 
configuration when the correct equipment becomes available. Note: Ensure the 
transformer polarities match additive-to-additive or subtractive-to-subtractive. 
 
Figure 7.7. Paralleling Single-Phase Transformers. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023

7.4.2.7.2. In a situation where three-phase power is needed and one transformer 
out of the three is damaged, three-phase power can still be provided by making 
what are commonly called open-delta connections. Figure 7.8 shows the open-
delta connection when a four-wire, three-phase wye primary is involved. Figure 
7.9 illustrates the connections that must be made to achieve the open-delta 
connection when a three-wire, three-phase delta primary is involved. Regardless 
of the type of primary involved, these connections are used only for emergencies 
and should not be constructed as permanent installation. The two transformers 
used in the open-delta connection will only supply 86.6 percent of their rated 
capacity. The total capacity of the bank will be only 57.7 percent of the original 
bank capacity.

7.4.2.8. Service Entrances. During the aftermath of an attack or disaster, it may 
become necessary to repair or build new service entrances with expedient methods 
and materials. New installations would be intended as temporary measures only 
and would be upgraded as the situation stabilizes or used where the location is 
intended only as a one-time, short-term development. An electrical service 
entrance is the point at which electrical service enters a facility, it normally 
consists of a load center with circuit breakers or fuses, and any other equipment 
located between the load center and service drop (overhead connection). An 
expedient service entrance can be constructed as follows: 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
202 
 
 
7.4.2.8.1. If only the service entrance cable is available, electrician can make a 
weather head using PVC pipe to form the downward curve of the weather head. 
Fasten the PVC to a rigid vertical item like wood framing. Should PVC not be 
available, plastic electrician’s tape can effectively seal moisture out of the cable 
insulation for the service entrance (Figure 7.10). Individually insulated wires can 
be bundled and wrapped with tape to form a service entrance cable. Should plastic 
tape not be available, friction tape can be used to wrap the cable; however, if 
friction tape is used, it should be coated with varnish to render it waterproof before 
installation. 
 
Figure 7.10. Expedient Weather Head Using Electrician’s Tape. 
 
 
 
7.4.2.8.2. If load centers are not available, using safety switches (Figure 7.11) for 
service equipment can protect light loads. It may be necessary to bridge one set 
of contacts inside the switch so that the neutral will be a solid, unbroken circuit. 
The energized circuits can then be fused to the proper ampacity (current-carrying 
capacity) through the operating contacts. Keep in mind that this is an emergency 
situation and that the fuses should be well below the ampacity of the branch 
circuits installed to protect the insulation of these branch circuits.

Figure 7.11. Safety Switch. 
 
 
 
7.4.2.9. Grounding Wires and Rods. Proper grounding of electrical systems is 
essential to the safe operation of the system. Grounding is accomplished by 
driving ground rods into the ground and providing a minimum 10 American Wire 
Gauge (AWG) bare copper wire from the ground rod to the device or system to 
be grounded. The spacing and depth of ground rods depends upon the resistance 
to ground to the earth at the site. In the absence of the capability to measure the 
resistance to ground and determine actual grounding requirements for the site, use 
a 5/8-inch x 8-foot ground rod driven into the earth or into the permanent ground 
water level, if known. Electrical continuity is essential in a grounding system; 
therefore, all connections must be clean and properly bonded. The design and 
application of grounding to an electrical system should normally be inherent in 
the system installation and not something that is added later. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
204 
 
 
7.4.2.10. Tools and Equipment. Generally, the tools, equipment, and materials 
needed for electrical utility repairs are contained in CE and Basic Expeditionary 
Airfield Resources UTCs along with their associated Mobility Readiness Spares 
Packages (MRSP). However, before deploying it is important to contemplate site-
specific needs and the availability of on-site assets. If additional materials are 
needed for early or expedient repairs, consider having arriving personnel bring 
the materials with them for the anticipated work. 
 
7.4.3. Airfield Lighting Repairs. Airfield lighting can be essential to support 
aircraft nighttime operations and other periods of decreased visibility. If after an 
attack or disaster, damage conditions allow use of the permanently installed 
airfield lighting system, likely some expedient repairs will be necessary. Ideally, 
as repairs to runway pavement surfaces are under way, concurrent repairs to the 
airfield lighting system should be proceeding with the intent of having the system 
operational when the full runway returns into service. Refer to AFMAN 32-1040, 
Civil Engineer Airfield Infrastructure Systems, UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air 
Navigation Facilities, and UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and 
Design, for specific information on runway and airfield lighting guidance. 
 
7.4.3.1. Lamps and Fixtures. These items are probably the most vulnerable 
components of runway lighting systems. Because of their exposed locations, the 
components can suffer damage from accidents, natural disasters, or airfield 
attacks. If the fixtures are undamaged, just replace the broken or inoperative 
lamps. If replacement lamps or fixtures are scarce or unavailable, consider 
substitute equipment and alternate sources for parts. If, for example, the base has 
multiple runways, lamps and other components salvaged from one runway may 
be useful to light another. As a last resort, lamps and fixtures not commonly used 
in runway lighting systems may be a potential option to accomplish the mission 
under emergency conditions. If considering these or other unconventional 
emergency repair options, coordinate with local airfield management and wing 
safety (flight and ground) authorities before proceeding. Note: Remove substitute 
equipment from service upon installation of approved replacement equipment.

7.4.3.2. Light Emitting Diode (LED) Fixtures. With significant technology 
advancements in interior and exterior lighting, LED sources and fixtures have 
rapidly become industry standards and may be potential replacements for 
defective and quartz-halogen lighting. According to AFMAN 32-1040, LED 
fixtures are approved for use on Department of the Air Force installations in both 
enduring and contingency applications with the following exceptions: medium-
intensity and high-intensity runway edge lighting, approach lighting, and 
obstruction lighting. Other conditions may limit or prohibit the use of LED lights 
and fixtures on the airfield. In any case, the use of LED light fixtures for airfield 
ramp, apron, alert, or airfield security lighting requires appropriate base level 
organization coordination. For specific requirements regarding LED fixtures, 
refer to AFMAN 32-1040 and UFC 3-535-01. 
 
7.4.3.3. Power Supply. An adequate power supply must be available to return a 
damaged runway lighting system to operation. If the main base power and the air 
base lighting vault are still operational, the first consideration should be to 
reconnect or reroute feeder lines from the vault to the nearest source of base 
power. If the main base power system is not operational, or it is not feasible to 
reconnect an operational vault to base power, the use of generators is the 
alternative. Since an operational runway usually has highest priority in base 
recovery activities, the acquisition of generators should not pose a significant 
problem. Depending on runway location, connecting the runway lighting system 
to an off base, commercial power supply might also be a viable option. 
 
7.4.3.4. Cable Connections. It is likely that disruption to parts of the underground 
cable system will occur during an airfield attack. The most expedient way to repair 
this type of damage is to use the existing system to the maximum extent by 
splicing broken cable and looping around the extensive breaks with replacement 
cable. If the lighting system received extensive damage, or the selected MOS does 
not lend itself to the use of an existing lighting system, run new cables to support 
a new lighting system. In either situation, "expedient" is the key word. Avoid 
devoting extra time to burying cable repairs or new cables unless required for safe 
aircraft operations. Running the cables above ground expedites repairs and saves 
considerable time for other critical repair tasks. Accomplish permanent repairs 
and burying of cables after emergency conditions subside. Remember, it is 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
206 
 
 
desirable to use standard runway lighting cable for repairs. However, if necessary, 
consider any available electrical cable with a voltage and current rating equivalent 
to that required by the lighting system as a potential substitute. 
 
7.4.3.5. Emergency Airfield Lighting System. While the expedient solution to 
damaged airfield and runway lighting is usually to repair or replace the damaged 
parts, if that is not feasible, the use of an emergency airfield lighting system 
(EALS) may be next best option. Likewise, if a minimum operating strip (MOS) 
is in use, an EALS installation may be necessary to support night and adverse 
weather flying requirements. When making repairs to EALS, refer to T.O. 35F5-
3-17-1, Lighting System, Airfield, Emergency A/E82U-2, for repair procedures. 
 
7.4.4. Interior and Exterior Fluorescent and Incandescent Lighting. When 
repairing or replacing defective fluorescent and incandescent lighting sources and 
systems, energy consumption and life cycle costs are usually an important 
consideration. Refer to UFC 3-530-01 for additional information on interior and 
exterior lighting systems and controls. 
 
7.4.4.1. Fluorescent Lamp Repairs. Tubes, starters, ballasts, and tube holders (also 
called sockets) are the components usually involved in the repair of fluorescent 
lamps. All components are easy to replace, and most repairs are a matter of 
substitution. Due to improved life cycle costs, consider use and availability of 
solid-state lighting (SSL), such as LED sources or fixtures as potential 
replacements. For example, replacing linear fluorescent lamps with linear LED 
lamps (sometimes referred to as tubular LED (TLED) lamps). Note: UFC 3-530-
01 only permits LED light source replacements (screw base) for incandescent or 
compact fluorescent light (CFL) sources. 
 
7.4.4.2. Incandescent Lamp Repairs. Recent developments in light source 
technology have introduced long life light sources that have four to five times the 
life of standard incandescent light sources. In lieu of repair, consider replacing 
defective incandescent lamps with LED retrofits or other energy-efficient light 
sources. If feasible, also consider replacing defective incandescent or fluorescent 
lamps in exit lights with compatible LED types where permitted. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
207 
 
 
7.4.5. Interior Wiring. Expedient repairs to the interior wiring of a structure 
depend on the extent of damage and the criticality of the facility. If the facility is 
not critical to current base recovery operations, delay repairs until additional 
resources are available. For facilities considered essential to base operations, 
determine the minimum level of required electrical service. Does an entire 
structure need power or only a small portion of it? What type of equipment will 
the electrical system of the building be required to support? Will it only need 
minimum electrical voltage to provide lighting, or are there requirements for 
specialized voltages to power large air conditioning units, refrigeration units, or 
specialized systems and equipment? For example, there is no need to devote 
excessive labor and materials to complete restoration of the base hospital’s 
electrical system if the hospital staff needs only a section of the building and one 
X-ray machine. In this case, electrical wiring in this section of the building could 
be restored and a special high-voltage cable could be run to operate the X-ray 
machine. 
 
7.4.5.1. When making expedient repairs to the interior wiring, use undamaged 
wiring to the maximum extent possible. This will cut repair time and result in 
fewer exposed live circuits when the facility returns to operation. 
 
7.4.5.2. As with distribution systems, consider bypassing damaged areas with new 
wiring to complete a vital circuit. When bypassing damaged areas or running 
temporary lines into a structure, running wiring across floors and other building 
surfaces to expedite repairs may be an option. However, if the facility will have a 
high volume of personnel traffic, tack the wiring to the wall or ceiling to prevent 
further damage or hazards. It is not necessary to conceal the temporary wiring to 
present a finished appearance; it only needs to be functional and out of the way of 
heavy traffic (Figure 7.12). 
 
7.4.5.3. The best wiring practice (including open wiring systems) is to run 
continuous wires from the service box to the outlets. Although spliced wires are 
permitted (if they are located inside an electrical box), avoid using them whenever 
possible. If using spliced wires, the spliced wire must be as good a conductor as a 
continuous wire. Note: Never pull splices through conduit. Place splices in 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
208 
 
 
appropriate electrical boxes so that the hot wire will not make contact with the 
grounding system. 
 
Figure 7.12. Installing Temporary Interior Wiring. 
 
 
 
7.4.5.3.1. Since heavy wires are difficult to splice, electricians will often use split-
bolt connectors for wire joints (Figure 7.13). Wire nut connectors are common 
options for connecting small-gauge and fixture wires. One design consists of a 
funnel-shaped, metal spring insert molded into a plastic shell; the other type has 
a removable insert that contains a setscrew to clamp the wires. In either design, 
the plastic shell screws onto the insert to cover the joint. Follow steps below to 
connect a wire nut: 
 
• 
Strip off about 1 inch of insulation from the ends of the wires that you 
are going to join. 
• 
Twist the stripped ends clockwise at least one and one-half turns. 
• 
Snip 3/8 to 1/2 inch off the twisted wires so that the ends are even. 
• 
Screw the wire nut on clockwise.

209 
 
 
Figure 7.13. Solderless Connectors. 
 
 
 
7.4.5.3.2. For temporary or expedient wiring, use plastic electrical tape to insulate 
splices. On a two-conductor cable, separate the two legs. Secure the tape on one 
leg, tape the first leg, close the legs together, and tape the wire splice past the end. 
Adequately cover all bare copper. Apply three layers for voltages up to 600 volts. 
Half lap the tape (overlap by half the width of the tape) for padded mechanical 
protection. 
 
7.4.5.4. When attaching a wire to a switch or an electrical device or when splicing 
a wire to another wire, remove the wire insulation to bare the copper conductor. 
Make the cut at an angle to the conductor to avoid nicking and weakening the 
wire. To attach the trimmed wire to the terminal, always insert the wire loop under 
the terminal screw (Figure 7.14), so that tightening the screw tends to close the 
loop. When correctly inserted, the loop brings the wire insulation ends close to 
the terminal. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023

7.4.5.5. After completing wiring repairs evaluate the loading on each phase and 
balance the loads as well as possible. Failing to keep the loads balanced can 
quickly generate additional failures. See UFC 3-520-01 for more information 
when checking and maintaining load balance between phases. 
 
Figure 7.14. Wire Attachment to Terminals. 
 
 
 
7.4.5.6. Other important considerations for expedient repair of interior electrical 
systems is the supply of wiring, switches, and associated hardware needed for 
repairs. Depending on the extent of damage, base supply sources may not have 
enough for all repair needs. In these cases, cannibalization and substitution 
become important. At theater locations, many components will be of foreign 
manufacture and not readily available through US supply channels, making it 
imperative that repair crews salvage as much as possible. Structures declared 
irreparable may contain switches, wiring, and other hardware that is usable to 
restore electrical services to other structures. Exercise caution to avoid inflicting 
additional or unnecessary damage during salvage attempts. Salvaged structures 
may require rehabilitation in the future. 
 
7.4.5.7. The tools an electrician would need for interior wiring include standard 
items such as pliers, screwdrivers, hammers, wrenches, chisels, hacksaws, files, 
and drills. Table 7.7 lists special tools and materials not typically available in a 
standard took kit. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023

Table 7.7. Tools for Interior Wiring. 
 
Tool 
Purpose 
Fuse Puller 
Eliminates the danger of pulling/replacing cartridge 
fuses by hand. Also used for bending fuse clips, 
adjusting loose cutout clips, and handling live 
electrical parts. Some have encased circuits and test 
probes to determine if voltage is present in a circuit. 
Masonry Drill 
Typically, carbide-tipped drill used for drilling holes 
in brick or concrete walls to anchor apparatus with 
expansion screws or allow passage of conduit/cable. 
Conduit Threaders, 
Reamers, and 
Cutters 
Used to thread rigid conduit for installation. The 
tapered pipe reamer is as a precaution against wire 
damage. The thin-wall conduit cutter has a tapered-
blade attachment for reaming the conduit ends. 
Insulation 
Stripping Tools 
Wire strippers (or knives) are for removing wire 
insulation before making connections; multi-tools to 
cut and skin wires, attach terminals, gauge wire, and 
cut small bolts; and cable cutter instead of a hacksaw 
to remove the armor from electrical conductors at the 
box entry or when cutting cable to length. 
Plastic Electrical 
Tape 
Used for replacing insulation and wire coverings; 
provides weather resistance and limited mechanical 
protection to a splice that is already insulated. 
Fish Tape 
Used to pull wire through conduit. Tape is made of 
tempered spring steel, is about 1/4-inch wide, and is 
available in different lengths to suit requirements. 
Drop Chain 
Used for pulling wire and cable between studs in 
existing buildings. Consists of small chain links 
attached to a lead or iron weight; used only to feed 
through wall openings in a vertical plane.

Tool 
Purpose 
Ruler and 
Measuring Tape 
Folding ruler and steel measuring tape used for 
measuring conduit and determine the quantity of 
material required for each job. 
Wire Grip and 
Splicing Clamp 
Wire grips aid in pulling wire through conduit and 
for pulling open-wire installations tight. Splicing 
clamps used to twist the wire pairs into a uniform, 
tight joint when making splices. 
Extension Light 
Used when normal building lighting is not available; 
light includes long extension cord. 
Wire Code 
Markers 
Used to identify wires and equipment, particularly 
for wires in complicated wiring circuits, fuse circuit-
breaker panels, or junction boxes. 
Multimeter 
Used for measuring voltage, current, resistance, and 
continuity. 
 
7.5. Foreign Wiring Systems. Engineers may encounter contingency situations 
that involve reactivating an established installation in a foreign country. In this 
case, the facilities on the installation would be intact but possibly requiring 
renovation or modification. Be cognizant of  differences in foreign wiring 
systems/standards (e.g., color coding, frequencies, and secondary distribution 
voltages) and how they could influence expedient repair processes. See combatant 
command guidance for any specific requirements relating to foreign wiring 
systems. 
 
7.5.1. Foreign Systems Interface. The primary difference between US and foreign 
wiring systems is some foreign systems are not installed according to standards 
outlined by the NESC, IEEE, and ASC. This may be due to material shortages, 
particularly in economically depressed nations, which often have to use materials 
at hand. The following paragraphs provide additional details regarding material 
variances and electrical system comparisons. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
213 
 
 
7.5.1.1. Voltage. The US uses nominal voltages that range from 120 to 240 volts 
for single-phase alternating current and 208 to 600 volts for three-phase 
alternating current in low-voltage distribution systems. A considerable number of 
foreign countries use other voltages, requiring our electrical equipment to be 
converted, modified, or operated inefficiently when powered by these foreign 
electrical systems. 
 
7.5.1.2. Frequency. The standard frequency of alternating current distribution in 
the US is 60 Hertz (Hz). In many foreign lands, 50-cycle frequency generation is 
common; but the electrician may also encounter frequencies such as 25, 40, 42, 
and 100 cycles. See paragraph 7.5.4 for general guidelines for using 60 Hz 
electrical equipment on 50 Hz power sources. Attachment 5 lists frequencies and 
secondary distribution voltages for commercial power systems in various 
countries. Note: This data is subject to change so always verify before beginning 
work. 
 
7.5.1.3. Materials. The wiring materials commonly used in foreign countries are 
normally peculiar to the country’s manufacturer. The US employs the AWG 
system, which US installations use. Most foreign wire will differ in size and use. 
In addition, receptacles, switches, and plugs used in foreign wiring systems are 
different and normally cannot be mated or used with similar American-
manufactured components. Be aware that problems may result when dissimilar 
materials are used interchangeably in a power-distribution system. The close 
association of dissimilar metals may cause galvanic corrosion at the joints that 
eventually destroys the usefulness of the equipment. This is a particular concern 
when joining aluminum and copper. Newer materials made especially for 
connection to copper or aluminum with no adverse effects will be appropriately 
marked. Except in emergency expedient installation, dissimilar metals should 
never be used together. If using aluminum exclusively in a system, a special joint 
compound must be applied to all connections or joints to protect against excess 
surface oxidation. The oxide of an aluminum conductor differs from copper oxide 
in that it adds a high contact resistance to the wire. 
 
7.5.2. Expedient Procedures Involving Foreign Systems. During contingency 
operations in a foreign country, the AF may use all or part of the installation 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
214 
 
 
electrical system. Though the decision of employment is usually determined by 
immediate circumstances, the AF will likely use one of the approaches below: 
 
7.5.2.1. Since the electrical components of a foreign and domestic electrical 
system cannot be interchanged, the decision may be made to use all foreign 
equipment. The obvious problem in this decision is one of supply. The parts 
needed may not be readily available. 
 
7.5.2.2. If time is a consequential factor, consideration should be given to the use 
of standard electrical items made in the US and the modification of plugs or 
connections so that they may be used in the foreign system. Although this method 
usually results in decreased operating efficiency, the ease of adaptability and 
abundance of supplies usually outweigh the reduction in performance. 
 
7.5.3. Different Voltage Effects. Whenever possible, all equipment should be 
operated at its rated voltage. To expedite foreign system use, items built to operate 
at standard American voltages may have to function at different voltages. Though 
such items may not be operated efficiently, their availability for use may be an 
important military need. Below are some effects of voltage differences on 
common electrical devices. 
 
7.5.3.1. Lighting Fixtures. When fluorescent lamps are operated at voltages higher 
than standard, both the lamp and ballast life are shortened. Line voltages below 
the minimum of the operating ranges of 110-125, 199-216, or 220-250 volts will 
cause uncertain starting, short lamp life, and reduced lighting efficiency. 
 
7.5.3.2. Motors. Rotating equipment, such as motors and fans, are usually 
designed to operate with a permissible voltage variation of 10 percent within their 
prescribed rating. The combined voltage and frequency variation is also limited 
to 10 percent. Higher voltages give increased torque, increased efficiency, and 
increased starting temperature. Operating at voltages differing from rated voltages 
by more than 10 percent may be permitted only in an extreme emergency since 
the equipment will quickly be damaged or destroyed by such operations. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
215 
 
 
7.5.4. Different Frequency Effects. Electrical operating items based on resistance 
characteristics (such as heaters, hot plates, and electric stoves) operate efficiently 
over all ranges of distribution frequencies used throughout the US and foreign 
territories. Rotating equipment and items such as lights and transmission or 
receiving equipment are adversely affected by variations in frequency. Some of 
the effects of frequency changes on this type of equipment are described below. 
 
7.5.4.1. Resistive Loads. Fluorescent lights rated to operate at a nominal 60-cycle 
current can be used at 50 cycles, but with a shorter ballast life. At lower than 60-
cycle frequencies, a noticeable flicker in the light output can be detected. This is 
undesirable where painstaking and meticulous work is being performed. 
Operation at lower frequency is not satisfactory and should be avoided. 
Incandescent lights, because of their resistance design, will operate satisfactorily 
at all of the frequencies encountered overseas. However, lamps designed to 
function at 60 Hz will not burn as brightly at 50 Hz and ovens will not be as hot. 
 
7.5.4.2. Static Induction Devices. Distribution transformers, electric discharge 
lighting ballasts, series lighting current regulators, and other static inductive 
equipment induce magnetic energy fields in iron as part of their normal operation. 
The magnetic flux density is directly proportional to the volts/hertz ratio of the 
power source. Consequently, the voltage must be reduced proportionally to 
maintain the volts/hertz ratio at the design point. 
 
7.5.4.3. Transmitting Equipment. All receiving and transmitting equipment, or 
other items which have transformers included in their wiring, will not operate 
satisfactorily either below or above their rated line frequency and should be used 
only in an emergency. In some cases, there may be frequency converters available, 
particularly in flight line operations, which can be obtained and used when the 
equipment operation is mission essential. 
 
7.5.4.4. Induction Motors. Induction motors rated for 60 Hz operation will run at 
about 5/6 of rated speed when connected to a 50 Hz source. Consequently, if a 
motor is nominally rated to run at 1800 rpm at 60 cycles and is operated at 50 
cycles, its output speed will be reduced to approximately 1500 rpm. Motor current 
varies inversely with both source frequency and voltage. As the 50 Hz source 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
216 
 
 
voltage is reduced, motor current heating the winding increases while iron loss 
heating is decreasing. No amount of voltage reduction can compensate for both 
heating effects simultaneously. However, induction motors rated at 120V, 60 Hz 
will operate successfully at about 110V, 50 Hz if the speed reduction can be 
tolerated. Keep in mind that some motors are built to function at either 50 or 60 
cycles. In addition, Table 7.8 lists current and circuit breaker sizes for alternating 
current motors.

7.5.5. Electric Motor Voltage/Hertz Variation Remedies. Corrective measures for 
two of the more common major electric motor problems related to voltage and 
hertz incompatibilities are provided below. 
 
7.5.5.1. Motor Heating Due to Iron Saturation. Motor geometry establishes a 
design volts/hertz ratio. As addressed earlier, if the motor will be operated at less 
than designed frequency, then the voltage must be reduced proportionately (5/6) 
to maintain the volts/hertz ratio at or below the design limit. 
 
7.5.5.2. Reduced Motor Shaft Speed. Shaft speed is a function of source frequency 
and motor configuration. The coupling to the drive load often involves belts, 
pulleys, chains, or gears. A change in drive ratios could correct the speed. 
However, many loads operate adequately at 5/6 of design speed. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023

7.6. Miscellaneous Reference Material. The following information addresses 
load-carrying capacity of various wire, load current and circuit breaker sizes for 
alternating current motors, and common AWG wire sizes, types, and general uses. 
 
7.6.1. Wire Size and Voltage Drop Determination. The selected wire size for a 
given section of a system is based on the amount of electrical load that it must 
carry, and the allowable voltage drop. Note the larger the wire size, the greater its 
capacity and the less resistance it will have, hence, less voltage drop. Consider 
economy in size determination. Table 7.9 shows the kilovolts-amperes (kVA) and 
current-carrying capacities for wires ranging from No. 8 to a 4/0. The largest 
gauge size is No 4/0. Wires larger than this are classified in size by their circular 
mil cross-sectional area. One circular mil is the area of a circle with a diameter of 
1/1,000 inch. Thus, if a wire has a diameter of 0.1 inch or 100 mil, the cross-
sectional area is 100 by 100, or 10,000 circular mils. At overseas contingency 
locations, metric size wiring is likely used. Table A4.3 compares AWG or MCM 
(1,000 circular mils) wire sizes to the nearest metric equivalents.

7.6.2. Conductor Types. Conductors used in installation overhead distribution 
systems are usually copper, although they may be steel, aluminum, or 
combinations of these metals. Figure 7.15 and Figure 7.16 provides information 
regarding common AWG wire sizes, types, and applications. In addition, Table 
7.10 through Table 7.13 list the wire sizes for 120-volt, single-phase circuits, 
number of wires allowable in various conduits, and the wire sizes for 240-volt, 
single-phase circuits, respectively. 
 
7.6.2.1. Copper Conductors. Copper has high conductivity and is easily spliced. 
Hard-drawn or medium-hard-drawn copper is desirable for distribution 
conductors because of its strength. Since heating and cooling reduces the wire's 
tensile strength from 50,000-psi to 35,000-psi, soldered splices should not be used 
on hard-drawn copper wire because the hot solder weakens the joints. Splicing 
sleeves are normally used when making joints. 
 
7.6.2.2. Steel Conductors. Steel wire used as a conductor permits long spans 
because of its high tensile strength. Steel has about 10 to 15 percent as much 
conductivity size-for-size as copper, but the short life and low conductivity of 
steel wire are overcome, to some extent, by the use of copper-clad steel made by 
welding a copper coating to the steel wire. 
 
7.6.2.3. Primary Distribution. For primary distribution below 5,000 volts, either 
bare or weatherproof conductors may be used. The ordinary weatherproof 
covering is not to be considered as insulation, although it does prevent 
breakdowns on the lower primary voltages caused by conductors swinging 
together. For all primary distribution over 5,000 volts, bare conductors are 
ordinarily used. 
 
7.6.2.4. Secondary Distribution. Insulated wires are used for secondary 
distribution. The insulated wires permits rack-type distribution and closely spaced 
secondary conductors. No wire smaller than a No. 8 should be used for secondary 
distribution or for any external transmission of power.

HEATING, VENTILATION, AND AIR CONDITIONING (HVAC) 
SYSTEMS REPAIR 
 
8.1. General Information. Effective facility heating and air conditioning 
enhances personal comfort, but historically, it usually had minimum impact on 
aircraft sortie generation. However, in today’s operating environment, many 
mission-critical systems and electronics equipment require stringent climate 
control. For example, some self-contained C2 center operations may find it 
difficult to function without HVAC support (Figure 8.1). In these situations, 
adequate HVAC systems are imperative to mission accomplishment. 
 
Figure 8.1. Command and Control Center with Climate Control. 
 
 
 
8.2. Overview. This chapter briefly reviews expedient HVAC repair options 
during contingency situations. Repairs may involve working around hazardous 
materials or require work on and near energized circuits; therefore, only trained 
technicians may accomplish HVAC system repairs and modifications. Be sure to 
comply with requirements in AFMAN 32-1065 and other Air Force electrical 
safety criteria when making repairs. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
227 
 
 
8.3. Heating Systems Repair. Depending upon weather conditions at the time of 
a disaster or attack, repairing damage to the heating system can range in 
importance from critical to insignificant. However, unless the installation is 
undergoing a period of severe cold, consider delaying repairs to heating systems 
servicing non-mission-essential facilities by using space heaters and having 
personnel wear additional clothing. However, if repairs are essential, concentrate 
on minimum efforts necessary to return some measure of heat to base facilities. It 
is not necessary to attain pre-disaster comfort levels following an emergency. A 
partial return of heat can raise temperatures to a level that will allow normal 
operations if personnel are warmly clothed. 
 
8.3.1. Central Heating Systems Repair. Expedient repairs to central heating 
systems may involve the production plant or distribution system. For those 
installations that have a large central heating system, damage following an attack 
or disaster can be widespread. The feasibility of conducting expedient repairs to 
the heating system will depend to a great degree upon the amount of damage 
incurred. For example, if an earthquake or bomb explosion causes a large rupture 
of the central boiler, it is unlikely that expedient repair techniques will suffice. On 
the other hand, a break in one of the pipes leading from the boiler could probably 
be expediently repaired. Fortunately, the inherent strength of materials used to 
contain the pressure within the system also serves to protect the system from 
external damage. 
 
8.3.1.1. Production Plant Repairs. In some situations, units will need to delay 
expedient repair of heat production plants pending structural and/or electrical 
support. It may be necessary to shore damaged walls to prevent structural collapse 
or restore electrical utility service power to control and monitoring devices. From 
a mechanical perspective, crews may need to repair or replace broken pipes, 
bypass damaged automatic controls with manual ones, or cannibalize inoperable 
plant components in order to get some boilers back in operation. As stated earlier, 
however, if a plant’s boilers have sustained significant damage, the production 
plant is probably beyond immediate repair. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
228 
 
 
8.3.1.2. Distribution System Repairs. The high heat and pressure associated with 
most heating systems preclude the use of many expedient repair methods and 
materials used to correct damage to water distribution systems. It is not safe to 
attempt to patch or weld pipe or fittings. Pipe replacement and welding are the 
most common repair techniques used to correct distribution system problems. 
Welding of high-pressure vessels is a specialized technique and requires 
substantial experience; only an American Society of Mechanical Engineers 
certified welder should attempt it. In overseas areas, expect to encounter older 
systems containing components no longer in production. Repair parts for these 
facilities may have to be custom fabricated or cannibalized from other systems. 
Most locations, however, should have an emergency stock of heating system 
materials. Tap this source as much as possible. 
 
8.3.2. Individual Systems Repair. Installations without a central heating system 
generally feature individual building systems. The great advantages of these 
independent units are that damage is limited to the system that supports a single 
building and general repair concepts are, for the most part, universally applicable. 
The basic question then becomes whether or not to repair. 
 
8.3.2.1. If the weather permits, or the facility is not critical to the base mission, 
delay repairs until emergency conditions are essentially over. Another quick 
alternative when extensive repairs are required is to move personnel into a nearby 
building with a working heating system. 
 
8.3.2.2. Expedient repairs to an individual heating unit are generally less complex 
than repairs on a large central system. Damage is confined and easy to determine 
since the independent system does not involve a dispersed network. Components 
are smaller, making it easier for repair crews to install replacements. In addition, 
spare parts may be more readily available from base supply and local vendors. 
Furthermore, since there often are many facilities containing similar individual 
heating systems, there are more opportunities for cannibalization of parts from 
low-priority buildings. If the damage is limited to the system’s ducting, consider 
placing temporary flexible ducts to correct the problem. Figure 8.2 shows 
examples of flexible ducting.

229 
 
 
Figure 8.2. Typical Flexible HVAC Ducting. 
 
 
 
8.3.3. Alternative Heating Sources. If attempts to repair existing heating systems 
fail, temporary heating sources can provide support for mission-essential 
facilities. Remember, however, alternate heat sources can be dangerous and 
require frequent checks and servicing. As time permits, repair damaged systems 
using existing stocks or cannibalized materials, thereby freeing portable heaters 
for use elsewhere. 
 
8.3.3.1. Fuel-fired and Propane Space Heaters. Various types of space heaters 
provide an alternative to central or individual heating systems. Fuel-fired heaters 
(Figure 8.3) may be an option in large open buildings if the odor is not 
objectionable and explosive vapors are not present. The propane heater on the 
right of the figure delivers 8,000 to 24,000 BTU of portable, infrared heat from a 
common 20-lb propane cylinder. Several variations are readily available on the 
open market, including larger units designed to meet higher heating demands. In 
general, open flame heaters are dangerous, especially the unvented type. If they 
are used the catalytic types are the safest.

Figure 8.3. Typical Portable Fuel-Fired and Propane Heaters. 
 
 
 
8.3.3.2. Electric Space Heaters. Electric heaters (Figure 8.4) provide a safer 
alternative to open flame units provided temporary wiring and power sources can 
handle the extra load. Space heaters may be available from various sources, 
including routine supply channels or local vendors. Some units may have portable 
shop heaters that may be reassigned to critical facilities. Heating units are also in 
Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources assets. 
 
8.3.3.3. Cart-Type Ducted Heaters. Cart-type ducted heaters provide an excellent 
alternate heat source because combustion stays outside the structure being heated. 
The units may be available from organizations on base, such as aerospace ground 
equipment or communications squadrons, after requirements for aircraft sorties 
and other vital operations have been met.

8.3.3.4. Improvised Heaters. The use of improvised heaters should be avoided, 
except in cases of extreme cold and where no other alternative exists. The primary 
dangers inherent with improvised heating systems are the possibility for 
asphyxiation and fire hazard potential. Caution must be taken to ensure that 
dangerous fumes are vented during combustion and any open flame is properly 
contained. One of the most common improvised heaters consists of a 55-gallon 
drum converted for use as a burner coupled with makeshift sheet metal ducting to 
vent fumes to the outside. Remember, improvised heaters do not completely 
contain combustion vapors. Therefore, even with vents to the outside, makeshift 
heaters should never be used in totally enclosed areas. 
 
8.4. AC System Repairs. Generally, AC systems are more vulnerable than their 
heating counterparts are. Several critical components of the climate control 
system are usually located externally to the facility they serve and therefore are 
more susceptible to damage. Typical AC repairs tend to be labor intensive and 
usually take a considerable amount of time. Like heating systems, AC support is 
highly dependent on a reliable electric supply. In addition to being time intensive, 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
232 
 
 
it is common to have many unit and system variations present on a typical 
installation or base. These factors make developing an expedient repair strategy 
and standardized repair kit to satisfy all potential needs both cost prohibitive and 
nearly impossible. If system rejuvenation is plausible and parts are not available 
in a standardized repair kit, consider obtaining needed parts from similar units 
that support less critical functions. Normally, if expedient AC is required after an 
attack or natural disaster, portable units are the ideal way to go until time and 
resources allow permanent repairs. Several BTU variations are available that 
support AC requirements ranging from small area units to large package 
configurations used for cooling entire buildings. Figure 8.5 is an example of a 
trailer-mounted portable AC unit.

8.4.1. Visual Check. A careful visual inspection of the AC system is often all that 
it takes to find the cause of the problem. This could include broken belts, 
obstructed condenser air passages, a loose clutch, loose or broken mounting 
brackets, disconnected or broken wires, and refrigerant leaks. However, 
refrigerant leaks are especially problematic because, whether large or small, the 
leak will eventually empty the system of its charge and cause faulty operation. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
233 
 
 
8.4.2. Refrigerant Leaks. Refrigerants are a key component of any air conditioning 
(AC) system and require proper handling. Review guidance in AFMAN 32-7002, 
Environmental Compliance and Pollution Prevention, when performing work on 
any AC system.  Expedient AC repairs often involve locating and repairing leaks 
within the refrigeration system. If, during an emergency, you have mission 
essential cooling units that are operable except for minor leaks, your first course 
of action would usually be to charge the unit as a temporary measure and move 
on to the next issue. However, if the situation allows for a more concerted effort, 
make permanent repairs to avoid duplication of effort. 
 
8.4.2.1. Methods for testing for leaks vary with the refrigerant used. When 
conducting leak tests, be certain to check for leaks before the unit is evacuated. 
Moisture could enter the system through a leak during evacuation or pump-down. 
Always use the proper recycle/recover equipment when locating and repairing 
leaks. Some manufacturers recommend using the refrigerant in the system to test 
for leaks. In such situations, use a sensitive leak detector to help find leaks. 
 
8.4.2.2. Other methods involve applying pressure to the system with an inert gas, 
such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide. At the start of testing, a positive pressure 
(greater than atmospheric pressure) of 5 to 30 psi is necessary throughout the 
circuit. If unable to find leaks, test again at or above the normal condensing 
pressure for the refrigerant used. When you find and repair a leak, you should 
recheck the complete unit to confirm the repair and ensure there are no additional 
refrigerant leaks. 
 
8.4.3. Alternative AC Sources. When expedient repair to an existing central AC 
system is not feasible, an alternative AC source may be necessary to provide 
cooling for mission-essential equipment, systems, and facilities. While there are 
many alternate cooling options available, portable, self-contained, ductless, and 
field-deployable AC units are likely the most expedient options during 
contingencies. Self-contained AC systems are generally one of two types: 
window-mounted or floor-mounted units. They are all-inclusive package units, 
and commonly configured as a thru-wall unit on exterior walls. These package 
units are primarily in smaller structures and modular units. Some locations may 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
234 
 
 
employ self-contained systems as a temporary, expedient cooling method during 
contingencies. 
 
8.4.3.1. Window-mounted AC units usually range from 4,000 to 36,000 BTU per 
hour in capacity. In addition to window installation, workers may install these 
units in other transoms or directly in the outside walls (commonly called a 
"through-the-wall" installation). Install these units with a slight downward tilt 
towards building exterior so the condensate drains to the outside. These units 
require very little mechanical attention before operation. 
 
8.4.3.2. Floor-mounted AC units range in size from 24,000 to 360,000 BTU per 
hour. The entire system of this package unit is located in the conditioned space. 
Like window units, these larger units contain a complete system of refrigeration 
components. These units normally use either a water-cooled or an air-cooled 
condenser. 
 
8.4.3.3. Ductless Mini-Split AC System. These systems have an outdoor unit that 
houses the compressor and condenser and an indoor unit consisting of the 
evaporator and air handler. In some split-system air conditioners, the indoor unit 
may also include electric heating coils. An advantage of ductless systems is they 
avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork of conventional central air 
systems. This type of unit is often the option at enduring expeditionary locations. 
 
8.4.3.4. Ductless Mini-Split Heat Pumps. Like ductless AC units, these units may 
be an option when use of distribution ductwork is not feasible. They also have 
two main components, an outdoor compressor/condenser, and an indoor air-
handling unit. These units are easy to install, and generally only require a small 
hole through the wall for the conduit, which houses the power cable, refrigerant 
tubing, suction tubing, and condensate drain. 
 
8.4.3.5. Portable Chillers. Generally, chillers cool and circulate water (or water 
mixture) to provide comfort cooling into buildings and other controlled spaces. 
These systems deliver conditioned air by pumping chilled water to heat 
exchangers in air handling or fan-coil units. Units may have air-cooled or water-
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
235 
 
 
cooled chiller condensers, and range in size from small units capable of cooling 
small areas to large units capable cooling entire buildings. 
 
8.4.3.6. Field-Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU). Also 
considered somewhat self-contained, the FDECU is a packaged, air-to-air heat 
pump that requires the units be located outside the facility and connection to the 
facility is through the supply and return ducts. The AF uses this type of unit 
extensively at contingency locations to cool, heat, dehumidify, filter, and circulate 
air in portable shelters and containers for personnel and equipment. 
 
8.5. Sizing Portable and Temporary AC Units. AC units are rated by the 
number of BTU of heat they can remove per hour. Another common rating term 
for air conditioning size is the “ton,” which is 12,000 BTU per hour. As reference 
in the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) publication, Energy-Efficient Air 
Conditioning, when sizing AC units, consider the following: 
 
• 
Size of facility and number of windows. 
• 
Amount of shade on the building’s roof, windows, and walls. 
• 
Amount of insulation in the ceiling and walls. 
• 
Extent of outside air leaking into the building. 
• 
Amount of heat generated by building occupants and equipment. 
 
8.5.1. To determine specific AC size requirements, consider using sizing 
calculations and standards provided by the Air Conditioning Contractors of 
America (ACCA), at https://www.acca.org/standards, and the American 
Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), 
at https://www.ashrae.org/resources--publications/free-resources/choosing-
the-right-system-for-your-home. Keep in mind that an AC’s performance, 
efficiency, durability, and cost depends on properly matching its size to your 
specific facility or room cooling requirements. 
 
8.5.2. An oversized AC unit does not provide the best cooling; in fact, it will result 
in the following: 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
236 
 
 
• 
Higher costs for a unit larger than needed for the facility. 
• 
Larger units cycles on and off more frequently, reducing efficiency. 
• 
Frequent cycling inhibits proper moisture removal from the indoor air, 
increasing humidity and personal discomfort. 
• 
Frequent cycling also wears out the compressor and electrical parts more 
rapidly. 
• 
Uses more electricity and increases demands on electrical generation and 
distribution.

CRACK REPAIR USING EPOXY INJECTION METHOD 
 
A2.1. Purpose. To provide guidance on use of epoxy injection to repair cracks in 
concrete. The following information was extracted from Repair, Evaluation, 
Maintenance, and Rehabilitation Technical Note CS-MR-3.9, Crack Repair 
Method: Epoxy Injection. 
  
A2.2. Description. This method can be used to repair cracks as narrow as 0.002 
inch. The method generally consists of drilling holes at close intervals along the 
cracks, in some cases installing entry ports, and injecting the epoxy under 
pressure. For massive structures, an alternative procedure consists of drilling a 
series of holes, usually 7/8 inch in diameter that intercepts the crack at several 
locations. Typically, holes are spaced at 5-foot intervals. 
 
A2.3. Equipment, Tools, and Personnel Requirements. A concrete drill, an 
epoxy injection system, a means of cleaning holes and cracks, and normal hand 
tools are required. One man can repair cracks using this method, but a two- or 
three-man operation is more efficient. Epoxy injection requires personnel with a 
high degree of skill for satisfactory execution. 
 
A2.4. Applications and Limitations. Epoxy injection has been successfully used 
in the repair of cracks in buildings, bridges, dams, and other concrete structures. 
However, unless the cause of cracking is removed, thereby making the crack 
dormant, it will probably recur, possibly somewhere else in the structure. If the 
crack is active and the desired is to seal it while allowing continued movement at 
that location, a sealant or other material that allows the crack to function as a joint 
must be used. The ambient temperature may also limit application of this method. 
In the case of delaminated bridge decks, epoxy injection can be an effective 
intermediate-term repair method. In this case, steps in paragraph A2.5.1, A2.5.2, 
and A2.5.6 outlined below are omitted. The process is terminated at a specific 
location when epoxy exits from the crack at some distance from the injection 
ports. This method does not arrest ongoing corrosion. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
247 
 
 
A2.5. Step-By-Step Procedure. 
 
A2.5.1. Clean the cracks. The first step is to clean cracks that have been 
contaminated. Oil, grease, dirt, or fine particles of concrete prevent epoxy 
penetration and bonding. Preferably, contamination should be removed by 
flushing with water or some other especially effective solvent. The solvent is then 
blown out using compressed air, or adequate time is provided for air-drying. 
 
A2.5.2. Seal the surface. Surface cracks should be sealed to keep the epoxy from 
leaking out before it has gelled. Where the crack face cannot be reached, but where 
there is backfill, or where a slab-on grade is being repaired, the backfill material 
or subbase material is often an adequate seal. A surface can be sealed by brushing 
an epoxy along the surface of the crack and allowing it to harden. If extremely 
high injection pressures are needed, the crack should be cut out to a depth of 1/2 
in. and width of about 3/4 in. in a V-shape, filled with an epoxy, and struck off 
flush with the surface. If a permanent glossy appearance along the crack is 
objectionable and if high injection pressure is not required, a strippable plastic 
may be applied along the crack. When the job is completed, the dry filler can be 
stripped away to expose the gloss-free surface. 
 
A2.5.3. Install the entry ports. Three methods are in general use: 
 
A2.5.3.1. Drilled holes—fittings inserted. Historically, this method was the first 
to be used and is often used in conjunction with V-grooving of the cracks. The 
method entails drilling a hole into the crack, approximately 3/4 inch in diameter 
and 1/2 to 1 inch below the apex of the V-grooved section, into which a fitting, 
such as a pipe nipple or tire valve stem, is bonded with an epoxy adhesive. A 
vacuum chuck and bit are useful in preventing the cracks from being plugged with 
drilling dust. 
 
A2.5.3.2. Bonded flush fitting. When the cracks are not V-grooved, a method 
frequently used to provide an entry port is to bond a fitting flush with the concrete 
face over the crack. This flush fitting has a hat-like cross section with an opening 
at the top for the adhesive to enter. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
248 
 
 
A2.5.3.3. Interruption in seal. Another means of providing entry is to omit the seal 
from a portion of the crack. This method can be used when special gasket devices 
are available that cover the unsealed portion of the crack and allow injection of 
the adhesive directly into the crack without leaking. 
 
A2.5.4. Mix the epoxy. This is done by either batch or continuous methods. In 
batch mixing, the adhesive components are premixed according to the 
manufacturer's instructions, usually with the use of a mechanical stirrer, like a 
paint-mixing paddle. Care must be taken to mix only the amount of adhesive that 
can be used prior to commencement of gelling of the material. When the adhesive 
material begins to gel, its flow characteristics begin to change, and pressure 
injection becomes more and more difficult. In the continuous mixing system, the 
two liquid adhesive components pass through metering and driving pumps prior 
to passing through an automatic mixing head. The continuous mixing system 
allows the use of fast-setting adhesives that have a short working life. 
 
A2.5.5. Inject the epoxy. 
 
A2.5.5.1. Hydraulic pumps, paint pressure pots, or air-actuated caulking guns can 
be used. The pressure used for injection must be carefully selected. Increased 
pressure often does little to accelerate the rate of injection. In fact, the use of 
excessive pressure can propagate the existing cracks, causing additional damage. 
 
A2.5.5.2. If the crack is vertical; the injection process should begin with pumping 
epoxy into the entry port at the lowest elevation until the epoxy level reaches the 
entry port above. The lower injection port is then capped, and the process is 
repeated at successively higher ports until the crack has been completely filled 
and all ports have been capped. 
 
A2.5.5.3. For horizontal cracks, injection should proceed from one end of the 
crack to the other in the same manner. The crack is full if the pressure can be 
maintained. If the pressure cannot be maintained, the epoxy is still flowing into 
unfilled portions or leaking out of the crack. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.33V3, 26 September 2023 
249 
 
 
A2.5.6. Remove the surface seal. After the injected epoxy has cured, the surface 
seal should be removed by grinding or other means, as appropriate. Fittings and 
holes at entry ports should be painted with an epoxy-patching compound. 
 
A2.6. Environmental Considerations. Reasonable caution should guide the 
preparation, repair, and cleanup phases of any crack repair activities involving 
potentially 
hazardous 
and 
toxic 
chemical 
substances. 
Manufacturer's 
recommendations to protect occupational health and environmental quality should 
be carefully followed. In instances where the effects of a chemical substance on 
occupational health or environmental quality are unknown, chemical substances 
should be treated as potentially hazardous and toxic materials.
