INTRODUCTION 
 
 
1.1. Contingency Electrical Systems Overview. The contingency electrical 
system is composed of three major subsystems: power generation, primary 
(2,400/4,160-volt) distribution, and secondary (120/208-volt) distribution. The 
equipment described in this TTP must be installed, operated, and maintained by 
persons knowledgeable in contingency electrical power generation and 
distribution equipment and their associated hazards as described in UFC 3-560-01, 
Electrical Safety, O & M. 
 
Note: Maintenance personnel shall wear appropriate personal protective 
equipment (PPE), to include arc thermal performance value (ATPV) rated PPE, 
IAW AFI 32-1064 and UFC 3-560-01 when working on or near energized 
electrical equipment or circuits.  
1.1.1. Within the major subsystems are components such as generators, primary 
cable reels and pallets, secondary distribution centers (SDCs), primary switching 
centers (PSC), remote area lighting system (RALS), secondary cable assemblies, 
power distribution panels, and mission-critical cable assemblies. 
1.1.2. Contingency electrical systems arrive at the beddown site in air transportable 
and or surface deployment packages. These deployment packages are Force 
Module Enablers necessary to open and operate any austere airbase across the 
spectrum of Air Expeditionary Force operations. These packages may also be used 
in other contingencies such as humanitarian operations. 
1.2. Deployment Packages. BEAR provides vital equipment, facilities and 
supplies necessary to beddown and support combat forces at austere airbases with 
limited infrastructure and support facilities. It is assumed that the beddown 
location has a runway, taxiways and aircraft parking areas suitable for the type of 
aircraft deployed, and a source of water that can be made potable. BEAR provides

MAJOR SYSTEMS COMPONENTS 
 
2.1. Contingency Electrical Power Generation and Distribution Systems 
Components. This system provides electrical power generation and distribution 
equipment designed to support austere base power requirements. The design is 
modular to support a broad range of contingency operations requiring electrical 
power. Contingency operations ranging in size from relatively small deployments 
requiring power generation and distribution at the hundreds of kilowatt level to 
very large operations requiring power generation at the multi-megawatt level can 
be supported. A brief description of the major components follows. 
2.1.1. BEAR Power Unit (BPU). The BPU (Figure 2.1) is a fully enclosed, trailer-
mounted, mobile generator set with a prime power output of 800 kW at 60 hertz 
(Hz) and 435 kW at 50 Hz, both at 0.75 lagging PF. The BPU is a 3-phase, 4-wire 
system that can operate at 60 Hz or 50 Hz. It delivers a nominal voltage of 
4160/2400 VAC at 60 Hz and a nominal voltage of 3800/2200 VAC at 50 Hz. The 
BPU can achieve this performance at altitudes from sea level up to 4,000 feet and 
in ambient air temperatures from -25 ºF up to 122 ºF without derating. See Table 
2.1 and Table 2.2 for altitude and ambient temperature derating information. The 
BPU utilizes JP-8 fuel, but can also operate on alternate fuels that include JP-5, 1-
D S15, 1-D S500, 1-D S5000, 2-D S15, 2-D S500, 2-D S5000, TS-1 with JP-8 
additives, Jet A, and Jet A1. It can operate as a standalone generator, in parallel 
with other BPUs, or in parallel with a commercial power grid. The BPU consists 
of a diesel engine, an AC system, cooling system, fuel system, air intake system, 
exhaust system, Digital Control System (DCS), enclosure, trailer, and DC 
electrical system.

2.1.1.1. The BPU Digital Control System (DCS) performs automatic voltage 
regulator functions, engine governing, system fault annunciation, paralleling 
functions, and operator and servicing control panel functions. The BPU also has a 
software component that can be installed on a suitable PC that emulates the 
Operator Control Panel functions of the DCS for remote operations. Remote 
operation can be provided up to 250 feet from the generator set. This computer is 
not furnished with the BPU, but is included in the High Power UTC. The DCS 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017

display is a Video Graphics Adapter (640x480) full color, sunlight readable 
display. The display switches and labels are backlit green for viewing under dark 
conditions.  
2.1.1.2. BPU tow vehicles must meet the following requirements: 6X4 tractor, with 
a pintal hook height between 22 inches and 30 inches, and minimum 80,000 
pounds gross combined weight rating. Do not use tow vehicles that do not meet all 
requirements. Tow vehicle NSN 2320-00-721-1432 meets all these requirements. 
Do not exceed 15 MPH on level paved road, 10 MPH on graded gravel, 8 MPH on 
Belgian Block or equivalent. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment.    
2.1.2. MEP-12A. This generator set (Figure 2.2) is a trailer-mounted diesel engine 
driven, prime power (Type II), utility (class 2A), mode I unit that produces 750 
kW at 60 Hz and 625 kW at 50 Hz with 0.8 power factor, lagging. It provides 
2400/4160 volts, 3 phase, 4-wire, wye (2400 volts line-to-neutral; 4160 volts line-
to-line) for 60 Hz operation; and 2200-3800 volts, 3 phase, 4-wire, wye (2200 volts 
line-to-neutral; 3800 volts line-to-line) for 50 Hz operation. 
Figure 2.2. MEP-12A Generator. 
 
2.1.2.1. The main control panel assembly allows local and remote start, stop, 
monitor, and control of the generator set in operation. Operation can be achieved 
up to 150 feet (45 meters) from the generator set. 
2.1.2.2. The MEP-12A is designed to operate on a variety of fuels, which include 
DF-2, JP-4, JP-8 DFA (Arctic Grade Diesel), and commercial jet A-1. One MEP-
12A consumes 55 gallons of fuel per hour at full load under normal environmental 
conditions, which equates to a consumption of about 1,320 gallons during daily 
operation. To ensure an adequate continuous fuel supply, connections are provided 
to accept fuel from two external fuel sources, such as a fuel trailer or a fuel bladder. 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     10 
Note: There are very few MEP-12As currently in inventory. The MEP-12A is 
being replaced by the BPU through attrition. Any mention of generators 
concerning power plant operations in this TTP past step 2.1.2.2 will be in reference 
to the BPU, unless otherwise specified.  
2.1.2.3. MEP-12A tow vehicles must have a 25,000 pound towing capacity with a 
pintal-hook connection. Do not exceed a speed of 20 MPH on a paved road or 5 
MPH on an unpaved road.  
2.1.4. The PSC provides for interconnection and safe isolation of primary 
generators and the connection of loads to the system (Figure 2.3). The basic 
electrical component of the PSC is the S&C VistaTM Switchgear. The switchgear is 
housed in an enclosure that provides both environmental protection as well as a 
stacking capability for transportation. The housed switchgear is referred to as a 
PSC.   
Figure 2.3. Primary Switch Center (PSC). 
 
2.1.4.1. General Description. The PSC features load-interrupter switches for 
switching 600-ampere main feeders and micro-processor-controlled, re-settable, 
vacuum fault interrupters for switching and protection of 600-ampere main 
feeders. These elbow-connected components are enclosed in an SF6-insulated, 
welded steel tank. The three position (closed-open-grounded) load-interrupter 
switches are manually operated and provide three-pole live switching of 600-
ampere three phase circuits. These circuits also provide a visible gap when open 
and internal grounding for all three phases. The 600-ampere fault interrupters 
feature re-settable vacuum interrupters in series with manually operated three-
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     11 
position (closed-open-grounded) disconnects for isolation and internal grounding 
of each phase. Fault interrupters provide three-pole live switching of load circuits. 
Fault interruption is initiated by a programmable over current control. The TO 
includes instructions on programming the control. 
 
The PSC allows for insulation testing without physically isolating the high voltage 
cable to within the high voltage compartment by switching the Way to open 
position. Then go to the nearest SDC and isolate and test from there. Note: PSCs 
have 600-amp deadbreak bushing connections. Install 600-amp to 200A adapters 
on bushings before connecting 200 amp load break elbows. 
2.1.4.2. PSC Connections. The Primary Switch features six Way Switches and 
provides for 3 phase inputs from a primary power generator. Primary power 
(4160VAC, 60Hz, or 3800VAC, 50Hz, 3-phase, 3 wire) is supplied to the PSC via 
three primary cables. A primary power connection is accomplished by connecting 
three loadbreak elbows to the 600-amp-to-200-amp adapters that are connected to 
the PSCs bushing wells. The bushing wells are connected to the Way Switches, or 
“Ways.” The function of each way is either a switch or a combination of a switch 
and a circuit breaker. A Load Interrupter Switch is comprised of only a switch. A 
Fault Interrupter Switch is comprised of a switch and a circuit breaker. Way 1 and 
Way 2 are Load Interrupter Switches; Way 3, 4, 5 and 6 are Fault Interrupter 
Switches. Depending on the configuration of a specific application, the Way 
Switches can either be inputs from a primary power generator, or outputs (feeders) 
to a load such as an SDC or to another PSC. 
2.1.4.3. Overcurrent Relay Settings. An operator’s remote terminal and 
overcurrent control adapter cable is furnished with the PSC to input settings, 
review settings, and interrogate the event recorder. However, the software for 
programming the overcurrent control is contained within the control, allowing any 
computer meeting minimum system requirements to input settings as long as the 
adapter cable is available. Two data ports are provided, one port is for 
programming ways 3 & 4 and the other is for programming ways 5 & 6. Procedures 
for programming overcurrent controls are presented in TO 35F14-1-1, Attachment 
CAUTION 
All routine operating tasks, switching, voltage testing, and 
grounding must be accomplished by a two-person team due 
to potential exposure of high-voltage IAW AFI 32-1064.

Control. 
2.1.5. Secondary Distribution Center. The SDC features a 150-KVA three-phase 
2400/4160 VAC primary 120/208 VAC secondary utility transformer and a low-
voltage secondary distribution panel. The SDC has 16 secondary outputs, 60 amps 
each (Figure 2.4), which are fed by 100 amp, 208 VAC output circuit breakers (16 
each). The primary power connections are configured for a feed through 
configuration. The high-voltage power is connected using 200 amp load break 
quick disconnects, to a common high-voltage bus. The high-voltage bus is 
designed to accept one input and two outputs and is equipped with three sets of 
high-voltage disconnects. Two sets of disconnects are used to provide feed through 
capability. The third set are fused disconnects (30 Amps) and provide overcurrent 
protection to the high-voltage side of the transformer. The low-voltage power 
distribution portion of the SDC provides 120/208 VAC, 60 Hz, 3-phase, wye 
connected with ground (5 wire system) from a 3-Phase 800 Amp distribution bus 
panel through a 600 amp, 208 VAC Main circuit breaker. Note: The SDCs are 
available with both the “Commercial Connector” and the “Class-L 
Connectors/cannon plugs.” AF SDCs only come with Class-L connectors and will 
be the only ones discussed in this TTP.

30kW and 60kW TQG sets (Figure 2.8). Wheel kits are included to allow ease of 
transport. Note: TQGs will be phased out through attrition. 
Figure 2.8. Tactical Quiet Generators (TQG). 
 
2.1.9.1. MEP-805B. This is a diesel or JP-8 powered, mobile unit that provides 3-
phase, 60-cycle, 120/208 or 240/416-volt power to support loads up to 30 kW. This 
generator may also be operated at 50 cycles, but will be de-rated to 25 kW. The 
MEP-805B model is provided with digital controls and instruments. Note: For 
altitude and temperature deratings see applicable TO. 
2.1.9.2. MEP-806B. This is a diesel or JP-8 powered, mobile unit that provides 3-
phase, 60-cycle, 120/208- or 240/416-volt power to support loads up to 60 kW. 
This generator may also be operated at 50 cycles, but will be de-rated to 50 kW. 
Note: For altitude and temperature deratings see applicable TO. The MEP-806B 
model is provided with digital controls and instruments.  
2.1.10. Primary Power Cable. The 1/0, 5kV cable provides the tie connections 
between the BPU generator, PSC, and SDCs. The cable is also used for power 
distribution. The primary cable uses load break elbows (Figure 2.9) as primary 
connectors.

2.1.11. Cable Reel Pallet Assembly. Primary cables are provided on three cable 
reels housed within a cable reel pallet assembly (Figure 2.10). 
Figure 2.10. Cable Reel Pallet Assembly (CRPA) with Cable Installed. 
 
2.1.12. Secondary Power Cable. Secondary Power Cables have Class L connectors 
and are keyed for voltage, frequency, and current. Covers, cable grips, and glands 
for both ends of the cable are supplied and properly secured to each connector. 
There are three different secondary power cables: a 25 foot 200 amp cable that 
distributes power from TQGs to the SDC or 60kW PDP, two 60 amp cables, 50 
foot and 100 foot, that distributes power from the SDCs to PDPs, and in some 
cases from the PDPs to Environmental Control Units (ECUs). 
2.1.12.1. In lieu of a PDP, some BEAR facilities have power distribution panels 
incorporated into the facility and therefore will be connected directly from the SDC 
via secondary power cables. 
2.1.12.2. When connecting cables to the SDC, start with the bottom row of 
connectors and work your way up. This will keep connected cables from 
interfering when connecting additional cables (Figure 2.11).

2.1.13. Remote Area Lighting System (RALS). The RALS provides a flexible 
solution to support illumination requirements. The RALS features 13 telescoping 
poles, twelve of which are positional through the use of “left-side” and “right-side” 
cable loop assemblies originating from the RALS container. The RALS is required 
to be fed by a 60 amp secondary power cable. The thirteenth pole is mounted on 
the RALS container. Each RALS pole uses a single 150 watt, 16,000 lumen, high-
pressure sodium lamp. The manual telescoping aluminum poles have locking 
collars. Each cable loop assembly is comprised of two (2) RALS loop cord sections 
of 375 feet each, thereby providing 750-foot of lighting string in each direction, 
for a total of 1,500 feet. The RALS container and a representative pole are 
illustrated in (Figure 2.12).

2.2. System Composition. A typical contingency electrical distribution system is 
depicted in (Figure 2.13). Note: If host nation commercial power is available and 
compatible with BEAR system, plan to use it to supplement BEAR generation 
capability; this will vastly reduce fuel consumption.

Figure 2.13. Basic Electrical Distribution System Schematic. 
 
2.2.1. When all system components are placed together, they create an electrical 
system with three subsystems: power generation, primary power (high-voltage) 
distribution, and secondary power (low-voltage) distribution.  
2.2.2. Primary system components are tied together with high-voltage cable, using 
load break elbows, from the prime generator through the PSC, and onto the SDC.  
 
2.2.3. The secondary system starts at the SDC and is provided to the user's PDP, 
or service panel, through secondary voltage cables using cannon plug connectors. 
The input can be made from either a prime generator, the output side feeders of 
another PSC, or from a commercial power source. 
 
 
CAUTION 
If a commercial power source is used, ensure the maximum 
voltage does not exceed the ratings of the SDC.

Chapter 3 
SITE PLANNING AND LAYOUT 
 
3.1. Site Planning. When most power production and electrical personnel begin 
arriving to set up the power plant and electrical distribution system, basic beddown 
planning will have likely already been accomplished, including designating and 
siting facility groupings. 
3.1.1. There are three main facility groupings: Flight-line Operations and 
Maintenance, Industrial Operations and Base Support, and the Cantonment Area 
(living and services facilities). In addition, Munitions, LOX and POL functions 
should be located separately from these three main groupings. 
3.1.2. If an austere base is being established with a view toward expansion, growth 
should be addressed during all stages of planning. Therefore, siting of individual 
facilities during initial stages of planning should also take the growth of the utility 
systems into account.  
3.1.2.1. Planners should recognize that the increase in physical size and number of 
facilities for each facility group is not usually directly proportional to the increase 
in base population. Most functional groups will not double, triple, etc. in facilities, 
area size, or utility support if the population doubles, triples, etc. Supply, 
Transportation, and Civil Engineering functions will increase marginally, while 
Billeting, Maintenance, Squadron Operations, and Wing Operations may increase 
between two to three times. 
3.1.2.2. During initial planning, consider the possibility of the base growing in 
population and identify locations for additional kitchens, laundries, power plants, 
water plants, and sanitary waste facilities; each of which may require large support 
areas and new electrical utility and backup generator support.  
3.1.2.3. Preplanning for facilities layout should also take into account the base may 
be expandable in only one or two directions without creating conflict with 
previously sited roads, facilities, and utilities. 
3.1.3. A major consideration when developing a base layout plan is the location 
and spacing of key facilities and essential areas. Force protection measures help 
minimize the vulnerability of facilities and reduce the risk to personnel from a 
variety of threats. Structure separation, standoff, and dispersal force protection 
measures affect facility siting decisions. Information on minimum standoff 
distances and separation standards for new and existing facilities as well as 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     19 
expeditionary and temporary structures can be found in AFPAM 10-219, Volume 
5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning. 
3.1.4. Deployment packages are standardized for the types of facility structures 
that serve each functional grouping. For planning purposes, functional groupings 
vary little and carry a common designation. Table 3.1 identifies basic designations 
for facility groups and types of structures supplied to house major functions. Note: 
The specific type and quantity of UTCs will determine the specific type and 
quantity of structures. The BEAR Power Planning and Distribution Tool (PPDT) 
helps plan the expeditionary beddown requirement by calculating the type and 
number of BEAR UTCs required based on a series of questions presented to the 
user. Additionally, the BEAR UTC Planning Factors within the tool can be viewed. 
The BEAR Expeditionary UTC planning tool is available at the BEAR Global

Note: The following facility groups provide their own structures:  
Hospital (X), Communications (Y), and Airfield Facilities (Z)  
3.1.5. Which facilities go where varies from location to location. In most cases, 
physical size and topographic conditions may constrain or dictate the basic base 
layout (e.g., a linear or conventional layout). The functional interrelation of flight-
line operations, maintenance, and command structures may also dictate that some 
facilities and functions be collocated differently, especially if the base supports 
other US or allied military services. 
3.1.6. Gather the following facts to determine the type of power system required.  
3.1.6.1. Threat level of the deployed area. 
3.1.6.1.1. If the threat is low and population of the base is not too large, one 
centralized power plant may be all that is needed. 
3.1.6.1.2. If the threat dictates facility dispersal, two power plants may be required 
to increase survivability and to cover the extended area. Ensure enough PSCs are 
available if two power plants are required. 
3.1.6.2. Determine if plants can be located to allow connection between them. 
3.1.6.3. Determine availability of primary cable to connect between power plants. 
3.1.6.4. Determine if SDCs from separate plants can be located in close proximity 
to quickly lay and park cable between critical SDCs for redundancy. 
3.1.7. The issues above may be easily addressed after rechecking facility 
groupings, loads, and layout plans. However, the situation can become 
increasingly complicated when considering additional transient aircraft, personnel 
support, and/or beddown expansions, especially if dispersed. The larger the size of 
the area to be served, the more resources required for setup, support, and security. 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     21 
3.1.8. Determine the system power factors and how they may affect power plant 
operations and the distribution system. Consider the following basic limiting 
factors when planning the layout of the electrical system. These system limitations 
are based on transmission and distribution distances from the prime power source 
to the PSC, the PSC to the SDCs, and the SDCs to the PDPs. 
3.1.8.1. Keep the primary power cable runs between generators and PSCs to the 
shortest distance possible (less than 100 feet). The primary reason for this is to 
minimize the overall footprint of the power plant. 
3.1.8.2. Limit the primary power cable runs from the PSC to the SDCs to one mile 
where the SDCs are grouped at the end of the run. A one mile run may still 
experience excessive voltage drop, but can be partially compensated for by 
adjusting the tap settings of the SDC. To avoid changing tap settings, limit the 
length of a run from the PSC to the SDCs to 4,000 feet. 
3.1.8.3. Primary runs between the PSC and SDCs should not exceed two miles 
where the SDCs are equally distributed along the run. Again, a two mile run may 
experience excessive voltage drop that requires SDC tap adjustments. To help 
avoid changing tap settings when SDCs are distributed equally along the run, limit 
the length of a run to 1.5 miles.  
3.1.8.4. Limit secondary runs from SDCs to PDPs and facility distribution panels 
to 800 feet when it is necessary to keep the voltage drop below 10% for the 
supported facility. Longer runs may be made for emergency use and use with 
resistance type equipment less vulnerable to voltage drops. 
3.1.9. An electrical distribution schematic should be developed during beddown 
planning. Planners should calculate, determine, and/or identify load factors, 
demand, maximum draw, and diversified load as related to individual facility 
groups. The specific information is used to develop a detailed secondary 
distribution schedule, placement of mission essential generators, and develop 
individual feeder schedules used for installation. Given time and expertise, going 
into this amount of detail during the initial beddown planning will significantly 
limit the need to relocate SDCs, re-site/relocate facilities, and relocate cable runs. 
During initial planning, basic planning factors can be followed to help minimize 
duplication of work. Detailed schedules should be accomplished prior to installing 
the electrical distribution system. 
3.1.10. Initial billeting planning is essential. Figure 3.1 shows billeting in the 
initial stages of low voltage (LV) set-up, with and without Field Deployable 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     22 
Environmental Control Units (FDECUs), and eventually transitioning to high 
voltage (HV).  
3.1.10.1. Due to time and manpower required to set up and remove HV equipment 
for billeting, it may not be practical to transition from LV to HV (Figure 3.2) for 
short term contingencies.  
Figure 3.1. Initial Billeting Planning with Low and High Voltage   
 
Figure 3.2. Low Voltage Billeting Planning with no Transition to High Voltage 
 
3.1.11. Basic electrical planning factors. System design should take into 
consideration the minimum number of generators required to support the 
maximum load at each power plant. This does not imply that each generator will 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     23 
be online at all times, but ensures sufficient capacity is available to meet peak 
demand.  
3.1.11.1. Where FDECUs sustain their continuous maximum amperage draw, 
consider the maximum load that one generator can support through the PSC and 
SDCs. The total load on each SDC should not exceed 150 kVA and the load on 
each SDC circuit should not exceed 21.6 kVA. 
3.1.11.2. One BPU, 800 kW generator (operating at 80% of its maximum capacity) 
will support no more than 5 SDCs per one 200-amp PSC output circuit when 
facilities are operating at maximum loads with FDECUs. 
3.1.11.3. Under normal operating loads, a power plant with at least two generators 
operating will support 6 to 10 SDCs per PSC circuit when facilities have FDECUs, 
and 10 to 15 SDCs per circuit when facilities do not have FDECUs. 
3.1.11.4. Each SDC has two high voltage output circuits with loadbreak elbow 
connections for feed through capabilities. A maximum of five SDCs can be 
supported from these connections. Only 10 shelters per SDC can be connected 
when the FDECU is used in each shelter. By properly balancing the number of 
SDCs per plant, the number of SDCs per PSC should not exceed this maximum 
number (maximum number depends on how many BPUs are connected). 
 
3.2. Layout. All CE units with deployable UTCs should conduct bare-base layout 
table-top exercises during home station training. Layouts should focus on which 
facilities require close proximity to each other, both within and between facility 
groups, in order to function effectively and efficiently (see AFPAM 10-219V5, 
Bare Base Conceptual Planning). Site planners will need this information during 
the “Open the Airbase” phase of the deployment. This exercise will also provide 
opportunity for power production and electrical systems personnel to practice 
layout of the electrical generation and distribution system and calculate secondary 
distribution requirements and feeder schedules. Layout decisions need to consider 
the threat, future growth of the base, and type of primary distribution system to be 
installed. 
WARNING 
At full load, the FDECU draws 41 amps. For 
ambient temperatures over 125°F, do not 
operate SDCs at more than 60% load (i.e., no 
more than 8 of 16 output connections used). 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     24 
3.2.1. Bare base primary distribution systems can either be a radial or network 
(loop or tie) system. 
3.2.1.1. A radial system has a single simultaneous path of power flow to the load. 
A radial feeder connects between a source and a load point, and it may supply one 
or more additional load points between the two (Figure 3.3). Each load point can 
be supplied from one direction only. Radial systems are easier and faster to 
construct, but do not provide redundancy.  
Figure 3.3. Radial System. 
 
3.2.1.2. A network system has more than one simultaneous path and can have two 
feeder arrangements, loop and tie. This system is more advantageous than the 
radial system because they provide redundancy by feeding loads from more than 
one direction. 
3.2.1.2.1. A loop feeder has its ends connected to a source (usually a single source), 
but its main function is to supply two or more load points in between (Figure 3.4). 
Each load point can be supplied from either direction; so it is possible to remove 
any section of the loop from service without causing an outage at other load points. 
One section of the loop feeder cables are normally parked at one SDC ready to be 
connected in case of an outage somewhere in the loop. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     25 
Figure 3.4. Loop Feeder. 
 
3.2.1.2.2. The main function of a tie feeder is to connect two sources. It provides 
a connection between two PSCs to provide service continuity for the load supplied 
from each bus (Figure 3.5). Make sure that correct phasing is maintained and 
concentric grounds are properly connected. Note: Use way point 6 as the tie feeder 
in each PSC and ensure the trip rating of the PSC tie Way and the tie cable are 
sized IAW Technical Order. 35F14-1-1.  
Figure 3.5. Tie Feeder. 
 
3.2.2. For expeditionary bases in a medium to high threat area, planners should 
consider the base structure from an air base defense point-of-view, combined with 
normal base operating requirements. In many cases, the boundary of the tactical 
area of responsibility (AOR) for base defense may dictate the initial installation 
pattern for the electrical system. 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     26 
3.2.2.1. For some locations, the tactical AOR may dictate a linear base structure 
(Figure 3.6) designed along a flight-line where the base is long and narrow. In this 
case, a radial electrical distribution system may be necessary with loop and tie 
feeders installed where possible. 
Figure 3.6. Linear Base Layout. 
 
3.2.2.2. When defense boundaries allow a more conventional layout to be 
considered, support facilities, billeting, and services functions can be progressively 
moved away from the flight-line operations and industrial support functions 
(Figure 3.7). For this layout, a tie feeder may be achievable between two power 
plants, even during the initial installation. A looped system for each power plant 
may also be possible. 
Figure 3.7. Conventional Base Layout. 
 
3.2.2.3. For critical facilities, especially those that require emergency or backup 
generators, SDCs can be connected with tie feeders parked on one end. This will 
allow SDCs to be quickly connected in case one feeder circuit is disrupted. 
Additionally, SDCs connected to critical facilities can be connected to an 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     27 
emergency back-up 30Kw or 60Kw via the low-voltage mission input connector 
of the SDC. 
3.2.2.4. Cables provided with electrical generation and distribution systems are 
adequate for initial installation based on non-dispersed facility separation 
guidelines. However, if high-threat conditions require facility dispersal at the 
maximum distances, some non-critical facilities may require portable generator 
support, and/or additional primary and secondary cable and connectors. Be aware 
that required separation criteria for some facilities (such as Munitions, POL, and 
LOX) can be varied based on terrain, protection of assets, and mission/weapons 
systems and should be determined for each individual base. This could have a 
major impact on the layout of power plants, SDCs, and mission-critical generators. 
3.2.3. Assets. If the population increases to accommodate two additional 
squadrons, or other missions, most assets needed for expansion usually does not 
triple with the population. When laying out the base, be aware that some functions 
require additional planning, either due to large size (i.e., an aircraft hangar, 4K/8K 
dome shelter, a 9-2 kitchen, or a medical facility) or minimum separation 
requirements (i.e., a power or sewage plant). 
3.2.3.1. An effective way to manage and delineate where facility groups will be 
placed is to locate and line up the facility groups within a network of travel and 
emergency response routes consisting of flight-line pavement, roadways, and 
utility corridors (Figure 3.8). 
3.2.3.2. If the base does not have a basic roadway system established, fire, security, 
and base planners should make this a priority during the layout process. Roadways 
should be created and fit easily between the groups (within the group separation 
distances), while utility corridors and utility right-of-ways would run along and 
between the groups and roadways. 
3.2.3.3. Facility group grids should then be established within the “blocks” created 
by roadways. Plan ahead; orient the tents/shelters and maintain adequate distances 
between each tent/shelter to allow room for FDECUs and other utilities. 
Otherwise, utility corridors can become cluttered with equipment, which make 
repairs, maintenance, emergency response, and removal of equipment more 
difficult.

3.2.3.4. With expansion, facilities grow within the roadway system blocks. Flight-
line facilities (such as Maintenance and Squadron Operations) normally grow 
along the flight-line. Industrial operations and base support functions (such as 
Civil Engineering, Wing Operations, and Support Group) normally expand 
outward and away from each other. Billeting functions normally expand away 
from the industrial operations, while additional key personnel services support 
functions (i.e., mobile kitchen trailer, latrines, 9-2 kitchens, and laundry) are 
located in areas where personnel are massed. Areas should be reserved to allow 
growth of existing power and sewage plants and placement of new power plants. 
3.2.4. Power Plant Layout. There are many ways to lay out a power plant as long 
as available resources are not exceeded, systems operate safely, and the system is 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     29 
installed in a secure environment. Layout power plants using planning factors 
stated previously in this chapter and adhere to safety requirements in Chapter 4. 
Figure 3.9 provides an example for a power plant layout. Key concerns for laying 
out the plants are topography, noise prevention, and vehicle and equipment 
accessibility.  
3.2.4.1. Topography. The general location of the primary power plant is 
determined by facility planners (primarily engineer officers and engineering 
personnel) with input from electrical and power production personnel. If a 
dispersed plant operation is called for, all plant locations need to be identified. 
With general locations decided, specific sites can then be picked out by on-site 
physical inspection. Consider the following when determining specific sites: 
3.2.4.1.1. Ensure the area is large enough to accommodate all power plant assets 
(e.g., generators, fuel bladders, berms, PSC, operator’s shelter, etc.). 
3.2.4.1.2. Plan for a secure boundary around plant perimeter (e.g., concertina wire, 
soil-filled wire fabric container). 
3.2.4.1.3. Look for relatively level ground to minimize site preparation. 
3.2.4.1.4. Plan to level ground for fuel bladders and PSC locations. Ensure the base 
under the bladder is free of sharp objects (large rocks, etc.) Consider using sand or 
small gravel under the base of the fuel bladder. 
3.2.4.1.5. Check area for potential flooding and reasonable drainage patterns. 
3.2.4.1.6. Ensure drainage ditches, swales, or irregular terrain does not inhibit 
access to site. 
3.2.4.1.7. If possible, leave trees on site to provide shade and some camouflage, 
but do not allow to block airflow. 
3.2.4.1.8. To minimize blowing dust and dirt, leave ground cover undisturbed to 
the greatest extent possible. 
3.2.4.2. Noise Considerations. When selecting the site, consider noise generated 
by power plants. Planners normally take this into account by distancing power 
plants as far as possible from cantonment and administrative type areas.  
3.2.4.2.1. In addition to distance, the use of tree lines and natural ground contours 
between power plants and highly populated areas can reduce noise intrusion.  
3.2.4.2.2. In barren regions, man-made revetments and baffles may also be used as 
noise barriers.

Figure 3.9. Power Plant Layout Example. 
 
3.2.4.2.3. When practical, locate power plants downwind of high-use areas to 
allow prevailing winds to carry noise and exhaust fumes away from cantonment 
and administrative areas.  
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017

3.2.4.3. Vehicle access is of critical importance to power plant operation, 
particularly for larger trucks and heavy equipment. Once the plant is constructed, 
large vehicles require access for delivery of operating supplies, repair parts, and 
fuel.  
3.2.4.3.1. Sufficient space should be allowed to enable removal of an entire 
generator unit for depot level repair without removing other plant equipment or 
moving assets around.  
3.2.4.3.2. Burial of electrical cables may be desired at a later time. Leave space for 
trenching equipment when future trenching in plant area is anticipated. At 
locations where cables cross roadways and in high-traffic areas, the lines should 
be buried even in the initial phases of the operation. See section 4.4 through 4.4.6 
for more detail concerning trenching and cable burial. 
3.2.4.3.3. If an extended contingency operation appears probable, it is advisable to 
build hard surface vehicle access ways, at least to the refueling points. If blacktop 
roads are not possible, use soil-cement mixture or compacted gravel.  
3.2.4.3.4. Be sure to consider fire-fighting access. Coordinate with the base fire 
chief to determine realistic space requirements; different bases have different fire 
fighting vehicle sets. As a minimum, plan your plant layout to allow complete 
accessibility to its entire perimeter. 
3.2.4.4. Power Asset Configurations. Although the same basic equipment is used 
in all Air Force contingency power plants, there are many possible equipment 
layout configurations. These configurations are influenced by two basic factors—
the size of the base population (determines quantities of assets received) and 
whether dispersed or non-dispersed operations are required (dictates number of 
plants).  
3.2.4.4.1. Layout with PSCs. One, two, and three generator plants are typically 
configured with one PSC as shown in Figure 3.10. For a one and two generator 
plant, remove generators starting with “Unit 3” as necessary. If using Way 3 as a 
generator input, the PSC must be reprogramed to remove fault isolation on Way 3. 
If not reprogramed, any fault will open Way 3. A four generator plant (Figure 
3.11) requires the use of two PSCs for safe isolation. See TO 35F14-1-1 for proper 
power plant set-up when using PSCs.

Figure 3.11. Four-Unit Plant with PSC Configuration. 
 
3.2.4.4.2. When only one prime generator is required for a limited area and in 
unusual cases when a PSC is unavailable, an SDC can accept power directly from 
a prime generator or from a commercial source of 4160VAC, 3-phase, 50/60Hz 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017

power. Then, SDCs may be branch-connected (Figure 3.12) to sufficiently 
distribute power. Theoretically, five SDCs can be connected in this manner to 
distribute high-voltage power; however, such an installation will provide a lower 
degree of safety for the generator than will be provided with the use of a PSC. 
Figure 3.12. Branch Connected SDCs. 
 
 
3.2.4.4.2.1. Managing loads coming from an SDC branched distribution system 
must only be accomplished by experienced personnel who are qualified to make 
primary electrical connections and disconnects IAW UFC 3-560-01; as the overall 
branched system will be functioning as a PSC. Always communicate with power 
production personnel before shedding sufficient loads from primary distribution.  
Also, shed loads slowly at SDCs on the secondary side before isolating the high 
voltage compartment of the SDC. 
 
CAUTION 
Standard SDC configuration with electric 
fusible disconnects only in center pole position 
does not provide over-current protection back 
to the generator. 
WARNING 
Verify the secondary (load) system is de-
energized before pulling outer poles with a hot 
stick. 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     34 
3.2.4.4.2.2. Unlike the PSC, which has load interrupter switches, the SDC has only 
outer switch poles that may be removed. However, there is no recommended 
procedure to allow emergency energized disconnects for the SDC.  
3.2.4.4.3. Generator Siting. Typically, power plant generators are lined up in 
parallel with one another. Position and ground the generators according to TOs or 
manufacturers recommendations. While the minimum clearance between the four 
sides of the generator and any obstructions is 15 feet, generators are usually 
positioned up to 20 feet apart to provide plenty of room for maintenance access 
and to ensure adequate air supply. Also, spacing of 20 feet allows for additional 
cooling when prevailing winds have a range of directions.  
3.2.4.4.3.1. For enduring deployments in hot regions, consider building sunshades 
over the generators to reduce solar heat buildup. The BPU is 116 inches tall (almost 
10 feet) and 152 inches tall (almost 13 feet) when the radiator outlet doors are 
opened in order to operate the unit. It is recommended that the covering roof height 
for generator sunshades be at least 240 inches (20 feet) to avoid re-circulation of 
the air being drawn in and pushed out of the unit.  
3.2.4.4.4. Locate Fuel Storage Area. When setting up a power plant, normally one 
bladder is provided for every two generators. Figure 3.13 depicts the common 
placement of the fuel bladder with respect to the generators.  
3.2.4.4.4.1. Do not locate generators any closer than 50 feet to fuel bladders due to 
flammability and fire protection purposes. Note: The BPU generator must not be 
more than 100-ft from the fuel source IAW TO35C2-3-474-11.    
3.2.4.4.4.2. Two 25 feet long by one inch diameter fuel lines are provided with 
each generator; therefore, manifolds should be within 50 feet of the generator fill 
ports, but should have enough slack to be moved and connected. 
3.2.4.4.4.3. Three, three inch by 10 foot long discharge hoses are provided with 
each bladder; therefore, the fuel manifold has to be within 30 feet of the bladders. 
3.2.4.4.4.4. Carefully consider where you place fuel bladders. Do not place them 
in a location that would permit fuel from a ruptured bladder and berm to flow 
downhill into other base areas or waterways. Lastly, be sure you have developed a 
plan for fuel containment in case a bladder and berm rupture or refueling 
operations result in major spillage.

     35 
Figure 3.13. Typical Fuel Bladder Placement.  
 
3.2.4.4.5. PSC Siting. The installation site should be in close proximity to the 
generators and should be relatively level and capable of bearing the weight of the 
PSC. Clear the site of brush, large rocks, and other items that might interfere with 
the operation, maintenance, access to, or stability of the unit. Ensure area is free 
from potential floods or potential washout from rains. Ensure adequate access to 
all removable outside panels and door openings. Provide at least six feet of 
overhead clearance for proper ventilation and ten feet for cable access and a safe 
clearance zone. If possible, make use of terrain features to minimize the heat loads 
on the PSC by placing the unit in a shady area. 
3.2.4.4.6. The RALS is another item designated for the power plant area. It 
provides overall general lighting for safety and security.  
3.2.4.4.6.1. The RALS includes a panel box and receptacle container, 13 light 
poles and fixture assemblies, cables to connect the lights to the panel box, and 
cables to connect the panel box to an SDC. The panel box also serves as the storage 
and shipping container for the cables and lights.  
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     36 
3.2.4.4.6.2. The lights are controlled with photocells; however, the panel box 
should be placed within the power plant perimeter for security purposes and in 
case manual operation is ever desired.  
3.2.4.4.6.3. The RALS receives power from an SDC. The cable provided for 
connection to the SDC is 250 feet long; therefore you’ll have to ensure an SDC is 
nearby. The same SDC should also provide service to the power plant shelter and 
air conditioner.  
3.2.4.4.6.4. Twelve of the 13 lights are connected to four 375-foot cable sections. 
Normally two strings of six lights are set up, each string 750 feet long. Each string 
is plugged into the panel box. The thirteenth light fixture is mounted on the panel 
box itself.  
3.2.4.4.7. Remote Generator Operation. This function is for long term operation, 
or plant operation where several generators are in use simultaneously. 
3.2.4.4.7.1. BPU Remote Operations. Establish a power plant control room and 
set-up the Remote Operator Panel (ROP) for the BPU. Remote operations are 
accomplished via the ROP laptop and the 250 foot remoting cable.   
3.2.4.4.8. Other Facilities. Plan for a parts supply facility and POL storage area 
near the generators for maintenance purposes. Finally, place a portable toilet and 
hand washing station in the plant area for convenience. 
3.3. Electrical Planning. Contingency electrical systems are pre-engineered; 
however, they need be tailored to each beddown location. Determine the electrical 
load on each SDC and then determine the electrical load on each primary feeder. 
To do this, you need to know the power that will be required for each facility. The 
information contained in this section will assist you in this task. 
3.3.1. After determining what facilities will be erected in the base, the next step is 
to identify total electrical demand loads from these facilities. Each type of facility 
and function has a connected load, which is theoretically the maximum facility 
load if all equipment was operating at the same time. This will not be the case in 
most instances; therefore, a demand power load is more realistic. The demand load 
is the load that a facility would draw during normal operations. Expressed as a 
ratio, demand load over connected load provides a demand factor, which is 
normally less than 1.0. Table 3.2 provides a list of typical demand factors by 
facility type and function. Actual demands may vary by mission and deployed 
equipment. Changes may be required for distribution and generation systems, 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     37 
including mission-critical generators; adjust demand factors and requirements as 
needed.

3.3.2. Table 3.3 details the power requirements for all base facilities by facility 
groups, functions, and types of structures used to house the function, and typical 
electrical planning factors in columns four and five. A diversity factor is applied 
to the connected and air conditioning (AC) loads since all equipment is not likely 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     38 
to be on at the same time. The diversity factors are usually 0.7 for connected power 
and 1.0 for AC power. Based on values determined either in the field, or taken 
from Table 3.3, total diversified power requirement is placed in the sixth column. 
This figure is obtained by multiplying the respective diversity factors with the 
respective connected power and adding that product to the AC power requirement. 
If total diversified load in column 6 is greater than the maximum allowable load 
on a single SDC circuit (i.e., 21.6 kVA at 100% load and 17.3 kVA at 80% load), 
then diversified load should be broken up between two circuits as shown in the last 
two columns. The seventh column is the requirement for mission-critical load; 
standard values are provided in the table, but use the specific, mission essential 
equipment loads if known.

Notes: 1 Loads vary for deployed freezer units. 
2 Loads vary and may increase as new equipment comes into the inventory. 
To prevent generator overload, two generators may be required even when 
level of service is reduced and some equipment is isolated. 
3.3.3. Keep in mind that electrical loads shown for the various facilities are 
estimated in many cases. Often, users bring additional or differing equipment that 
could alter these figures. If time permits, determine what equipment is actually 
being supported, particularly in areas related to flight-line maintenance operations. 
Do not be surprised to see containerized facilities arrive. Some organizations, such 
as the medical unit, have these types of facilities for specialized functions. During 
your planning efforts it would be wise to save a couple of circuits from the SDCs 
for these specialized facilities, at least in the medical and aircraft maintenance 
facility groups. 
3.3.4. Pre-deployment discussions with aircraft maintenance, munitions, and 
medical personnel prior to deployment may reveal unit-unique power requirements 
greater than those normally supported by contingency electrical distribution 
systems. The facility diversity factor for each plant should be evaluated during 
operations by checking the average daily peak demand versus the total facility 
demand. A major difference from planned versus actual loads may justify 
rerouting electrical service to achieve greater efficiencies. 
3.3.5. After the diversified loads are identified and excessive loads split between 
circuits, the next step is to identify how many of each facility type will be included 
in each of the facility groups. This will enable you to develop a secondary 
distribution schedule for each group. 
3.3.6. Based on the number of facilities and their function, a secondary distribution 
schedule can be developed (Table 3.4) as a preliminary worksheet for determining 
the specific number of functions and facilities to be served within a group. The 
secondary distribution schedule can be used to brief commanders and control 
centers in order to determine if specific changes will be required before actually 
hard wiring the base. Using the suggested format in Table 3.4 and the information 
from the previous tables, the third column beneath the headings shows the number 
of facilities of the same type that will be included within a specific group. The 
fourth and fifth columns beneath the headings shows the specific diversified loads 
per circuit required to service each facility. The sixth column under the headings 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     42 
shows the estimated basic mission-critical power required. The final line at the 
bottom of this worksheet provides a preliminary total power demand, which is 
determined by multiplying the number of facilities for each function by the kVA 
load for each function, and then adding all the products together. By dividing the 
results by the size of the SDC to be used, such as a 150 kVA SDC, you can 
determine the preliminary number of SDCs that may be required to support the 
group.

3.3.7. The FDECU is a heat-pump-type air conditioner and heater that is widely 
used with most shelters and tents. When a beddown requires the use of FDECUs, 
load planning factors for generators and the distribution system are greatly 
increased. The result is that a significant number of fewer facilities can be 
supported by each SDC when providing power to each facility’s FDECU. 
3.3.8. After development of each group’s secondary distribution schedule, group 
functional facilities by SDC as much as possible and arrange facilities to minimize 
the number of required emergency/back-up generators. Doing this will help ensure 
that emergency generators are properly loaded and decreases the manpower

required for maintenance and operations. If possible, complete this before site 
planners finalize facility locations in each group. 
3.3.9. Table 3.5 is an example of an SDC Feeder Schedule. It is based on the 
secondary distribution schedule for a Wing Operations Group at a 3,300-person 
base. The schedule expands on information from Table 3.4 and identifies circuit 
designations for each SDC.

3.3.9.1. This specific example shows that all circuits were kept within the capacity 
of a 150 kVA SDC and similar facilities/functions with mission-critical power 
requirements grouped together on two SDCs. 
3.3.9.2. The 35.2 kW mission-critical load for SDC-W1 could be supported with a 
60-kW emergency/back-up generator. The 12.8 kW on SDC-W2 could be 
supported with a 30-kW emergency/back-up generator, or the facilities and SDC 
could be sited near another group so that both groups could be fed from the same 
SDC and 60 kW emergency/back-up generator. 
3.3.10. The feeder schedule for each group should be used to develop a circuit 
schematic to list the required connections. While the surveyors are determining the 
rough layout of major facility groups, the circuit schematics can be annotated to 
show concerns for a specific layout. Identify basic distances and locations for 
placement of SDCs next to major facilities and circuits requiring emergency/back-
up generators for initial operation of the base. Critical base facilities may operate 
from emergency/back-up generators, linked by SDCs, for up to two weeks while 
assets arrive and the main electrical distribution system is installed. The 
schematics can be used to show and explain how facilities are located in proximity 
to SDCs and emergency/back-up generators. They can also be used to flag the need 
for an emergency/back-up generator at critical facilities where a load on the 
generator would be so low that it should be shared with critical facilities in another 
group; thus affecting the siting within two groups. Figure 3.14 depicts an example 
of an SDC circuit.

Figure 3.14. Example SDC Circuit for Wing Operations Group.   
 
3.3.11. Phase Balancing. To operate a power plant or generator efficiently, the load 
on all three phases of the system have to be nearly equal. The difference between 
phases should not exceed 10 percent; otherwise, generators will be out of balance 
and not provide full output. Also, voltage regulation will be poor, which can 
damage both generating equipment and equipment being powered. Even after all 
load factors are known and system schematics developed, the system might require 
further balancing (smaller generators are especially vulnerable to this condition 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     46 
when connected to critical or isolated facilities). When laying out loads other than 
three-phase, take into account the total loading on each phase. Equally distribute 
the facility loads on an SDC by alternating which phase each facility is connected 
to on the PDP (e.g., facility W1 connected to 25-kW PDP connector J5 [phase C], 
W2 connected to J6 [phase B], W3 connected to J7 [phase A], etc.). 
3.3.12. Radial versus Loop. Radial systems are normally used during initial stages 
of a deployment or for smaller austere bases in a low threat environment. 
Otherwise, plan to use a loop system, as they provide more reliable power, better 
system grounding, and greater flexibility for handling everyday type power 
demands and maintenance outages. The #1/0 aluminum, 5,000-volt primary cable, 
and associated load break elbow connectors, are used to interconnect the power 
plants and provide both adequate insulation and mechanical integrity when buried 
to the proper depth.  
3.3.13. Power Plant Dispersal. Plan to construct multiple power plants in a high-
threat environment (where facility dispersal is required) and for larger 
deployments. Power plant dispersal does not require greater separation of 
equipment and controls within the plant. Protection of resources is provided 
through the use of revetments, barriers, concertina wire, camouflage concealment 
deception, and berms. Plants should have the capability to be electrically 
interconnected to ensure some degree of electrical generation capability is retained 
after an attack. For threat dispersal purposes, plants should be separated between 
1,500 and 3,000 feet from each other as part of a loop electrical distribution 
network. The primary method of looping is by interconnecting some PSCs 
between plants. 
 
3.3.13.1. To establish a looped system, a physical connection is made from the 
Way Switches of one PSC to the Way Switches of another. 
3.3.13.1.1. Larger beddowns may have two or three plants with more than one 
PSC. There are greater opportunities to loop between each plant and interconnect 
several PSCs to form a complete “parked” ring between plants. 
WARNING 
Ensure interconnecting cables are marked 
properly and maps are updated to show 
interconnecting cables to ensure future 
rotations are aware of these cables. 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     47 
3.3.13.2. When rerouting PSC feeder circuits to power additional SDCs, care 
should be taken to not overload the circuit. 
3.3.13.3. Always ensure correct phase to phase relationship and the concentric 
grounds are properly connected on rerouted circuits.

SAFETY 
 
4.1. Safety Summary. As noted in paragraph 1.1, electricians and maintenance 
personnel shall wear appropriate ATPV rated uniforms, as well as other 
appropriate personal protective equipment IAW AFI 32-1064 and UFC 3-560-01 
prior to working on or near energized electrical equipment or circuits. BCE or 
equivalent approval is required prior to working on any energized circuits. The 
following paragraphs are recommended safety precautions to apply during many 
phases of operation and maintenance of contingency electrical generation and 
distribution systems. 
 
 
 
4.1.1. Ensure only qualified individuals install, operate, and maintain the 
equipment described in this TTP IAW applicable TOs. A qualified person is one 
who is trained and competent in: 
WARNING 
High voltage may cause severe shock or 
death upon contact. Use caution and avoid 
contact with energized components. Use a 
hot stick when handling loadbreak elbows. 
WARNING 
Ensure loadbreak elbows are installed on 
parking stands at the generator when 
performing 
maintenance 
to 
prevent 
possibility of utility power being fed back 
into equipment. Failure to comply may result 
in death by electrocution. 
WARNING 
Ensure all high voltage switching and isolation 
operations with grip-all switch sticks are 
performed by trained and qualified 3E0X1 
Electrical System Specialist.  
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     49 
4.1.1.1. The skills and techniques necessary to distinguish energized parts from 
non-energized parts of electronic and electrical equipment. 
4.1.1.2. The skills and techniques necessary to determine the proper approach 
distances corresponding to the voltages to which the qualified person will be 
exposed. 
4.1.1.3. The proper use of the special precautionary techniques, personal protective 
equipment, insulating and shielding materials, and insulated tools for working on 
or near exposed energized parts of electronic or electrical equipment. 
4.1.2. Keep away from live circuits. Operators must at all times observe all safety 
instructions IAW UFC 3-560-01. Do not replace components or make adjustments 
inside the generator set with the high-voltage supply energized. Under certain 
conditions, dangerous potentials may exist when the generator is not operating and 
disconnected from the circuit due to charges retained by capacitors. To avoid 
casualties, always remove power, test, and ground to assure it’s discharged before 
touching. 
4.1.3. High-Voltage Cable Connections and Disconnects. Always operate and 
connect generators, PSCs, and SDCs IAW the applicable TOs. Only properly 
trained and qualified 3E0X1 Electrical Systems personnel should connect and 
disconnect this equipment. 
4.1.3.1. Disconnects should be made in an de-energized state, which is normally 
achieved by shutting down the power source and opening the load-interrupter 
switches on a PSC, or turning off circuit breakers on an SDC. De-energized cables 
and transformers should be grounded to prevent a shocking hazard from residual 
voltages. 
4.1.3.2. During placement of the units (i.e., PSCs, SDCs, and PDPs) and cable 
laying prior to bringing generators on line, always use proper PPE and safety 
practices. Use of a grip-all shot gun for placing the load break elbows on bushings 
is always a good safety practice to ensure proper seating of the load break elbows. 
4.1.3.3. PPE and electrical equipment must be used when connecting and 
disconnecting energized load break elbows, opening PSC load-interrupter 
switches, and fusible switches IAW UFC 3-560-01. 
4.1.4. Resuscitation. Personnel working with or near high voltages will be trained 
and certified on cardiopulmonary resuscitation IAW AFI 91-203.  
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     50 
4.2. Personnel Responsibilities. Multi-skilling of power production and electrical 
personnel is critical for installation and operation of contingency power generation 
and distribution systems. Neither power nor electrical specialties have sufficient 
numbers of personnel on standard mobility teams to accomplish all beddown and 
recovery tasks following traditional skill breakouts. Contingency training 
programs direct several training activities meant to enable engineer personnel to 
perform beyond traditional peacetime-related skill requirements.  
4.3. Grounding. Proper grounding of the electrical system is crucial for the safety 
of electrical power production and electrical system personnel. Procedures for 
grounding the deployable systems differ little from those used in standard 
electrical system installations. The grounding system for the contingency electrical 
generation and deployable system equipment consists of equipment grounds with 
ground rods at major components and the (grounded) concentric neutral wires 
throughout the high-voltage distribution portion of the system. 
 
4.3.1. All equipment shall have a grounding resistance that does not exceed 25 
ohms. Test grounds IAW AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems. 
4.3.2. Soil characteristics play a large part in the suitability of the grounding 
network. The type of soil, its chemical content, and the moisture level surrounding 
the ground rod will determine the resistance. Clay and loam soils with no rocks or 
stones will have a much lower resistance than clay or loam soils with many rocks 
or stones. Moisture content also affects resistance readings dramatically. As 
moisture content increases, soil resistivity decreases. This is especially true at the 
lower moisture content levels. Therefore, much of the dry, rocky, or sandy soils in 
southwest Asia cannot provide the required soil resistivity of 25 ohms or less using 
just the driven ground rods provided with each unit. 
4.3.3. For proper grounding, you need to have a ground rod that will be in contact 
with moist soil. Use as many ground rods as required to obtain adequate resistance 
readings. If deployed to a location where a ground rod cannot be driven deep 
enough to reach low resistance soil, or if ground rods are in short supply, then 
WARNING 
Do not energize equipment unless properly 
grounded IAW applicable TO. Electrical 
faults in generator set, load lines, or load 
equipment can cause injury or electrocution 
from contact with an ungrounded system. 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017 
 
     51 
alternate-grounding methods may be used. A horizontal ground rod installation, 
buried metal well pipes, metal plate electrodes, or a laced wire grounding 
installation can be used to obtain the adequate resistance reading. Dig a trench as 
deep as feasible to reach wet soil or soil that can be moistened with water or brine. 
Lace a copper wire up and down the bottom of the trench. To keep resistance 
readings low under extremely adverse soil conditions, you may have to 
continuously keep the grounding area damp using water or salt water/Reverse 
Osmosis Water Purification Unit brine solutions. Thoroughly compact the soil 
when backfilling the trench to maximize soil contact with the wire or rods. 
4.3.4. For longer deployments, installation of a grounding grid under each 
equipment item (i.e., generator, PSC, SDC, etc.) should be considered both for 
additional safety and reliability. Each equipment item should have its own 
equipment ground.  
4.3.5. If deployed to a location in a climatic zone where the ground freezes, be sure 
to lay the horizontal grounding system below the frost line, as resistivity readings 
can increase substantially for frozen ground. Also, frost heaves that occur in soil 
with different moisture contents may cause equipment to tilt or move if the buried 
horizontal rod or wire system is located too close to the equipment. Keep the 
disturbed, moistened soil of the buried grounding system at least 10 feet from the 
supported equipment. The grounding system should normally be within 15 feet of 
the supported equipment; this is not a hard and fast rule and is dictated more so by 
the available area, materials, and the ability to obtain and maintain adequate 
resistance readings. For driven ground rods, recheck the resistance readings 
regularly throughout the deployment. Note: If 25 ohms is not able to be reached 
for grounding systems, contact the Electronics Engineer SME (Grounding SME) 
through the AFCEC Reachback Center at 888-232-3721 (toll free), Defense 
Switched Network (DSN) 523-6995, or via email at afcec.rbc@us.af.mil.  
 
4.4. Trenching. During the initial layout and early operation, the electrical 
distribution network is an above ground system. When time permits, bury the 
primary distribution electrical lines in trenches about 18-inches deep. Trenching 
may be accomplished using a tractor with backhoe and blade (Figure 4.1). 
WARNING 
Prior to conducting trenching operations on 
previous battlefields or in areas suspected of 
unexploded ordnance consult Explosive 
Ordnance Disposal.

4.4.1. When burying primary cables where rocks are present, place a layer of sand 
or other soil (free of rocks) on the bottom and top of cables to ensure they are 
protected. Trenches should be wide enough to provide a 6-inch separation between 
cables. 
4.4.2. At locations where cables cross roadways and in high-traffic areas, the lines 
should be buried even in the initial phases of the operation. Consideration should 
be given to running the lines in conduit under roadways and burying the cables 
deeper to allow improving roads over these cables with gravel or hard surface. 
Secondary distribution lines for service from SDCs should also be buried (when 
time permits) in shallower trenches. Under most climactic conditions, secondary 
distribution lines require only eight inches of cover, except for the following 
conditions: 
4.4.2.1. In areas subject to ground freezing, bury cables below the frost line. 
4.4.2.2. In locations which may experience numerous freeze-thaw cycles 
throughout the winter (where there is intermittent flooding and ground movement), 
buried cannon plug cable connections may require some waterproofing protection 
(i.e., wrap in plastic sheeting and tape) or be surrounded with free draining sandy 
gravel. If winterizing procedures are required for the deployment, marking or 
otherwise identifying buried cannon plug connections at critical facilities will 
allow them to be checked if freeze-thaw cycles cause problems with electrical 
connections. 
CAUTION 
To prevent damage to cables, do not lay them directly on 
sharp rocks or in very rocky soil. 
AFTTP 3-32.34V5   28 February 2017

4.4.3. It is especially critical to maintain the six inch separation (Figure 4.2) for 
primary power cables and to keep the cable from bundling together in the trench 
for facilities that require more reliable power and for interconnecting power plants. 
If a rotary-trencher is used, maintaining adequate separation will be difficult due 
to the narrow width of the trench. Field conditions may dictate various installation 
choices, which can be used to maintain a six inch separation and also meet required 
cover and protection, such as multiple trenches with a wheel cutter trencher, wider 
trenches, and/or deeper trenches and cable laid with horizontal and a vertical 
separation between cables. 
Figure 4.2. Trench and Cable Detail. 
 
4.4.4. In the immediate power plant area, make sure the trenches are clearly 
marked to ensure that future additional trenching operations will not hit buried 
power cables. Plan ahead, especially when multiple power plants are used, to 
provide access for routing of cables between plants. In some cases it may be 
feasible to bury several sets of power lines in wider and deeper trenches (Figure 
4.3) to accommodate base growth and/or expansion of the power plant.

4.4.5. Keep accurate, up-to-date records on the location of power lines and when 
possible, mark the cable routes. Note: Contact the Engineering Assistant office to 
ensure the continuity of records and the update of Geobase. Cable routes between 
plants can be relatively long, traversing much of the camp area. During long-term 
deployments, trenches can become overgrown or covered by blowing sand. If they 
do not have accurate records, follow-on units can easily disrupt electrical and other 
utilities when trenching to expand or repair/replace systems.  
4.4.6. When burying cable, be sure to label SDCs with feeder and SDC numbers. 
These numbers should accurately match the as-built drawings for troubleshooting 
and safety purposes. When time permits, label the cable to show where it feeds and 
from where it is fed (Figure 4.4).
