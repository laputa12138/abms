FOREWORD 
This multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) publication is a product 
of the Air Land Sea Space Application (ALSSA) Center in accordance with the 
memorandum of agreement between the Headquarters of the United States (US) Army, 
Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force doctrine commanders directing 
ALSSA to develop MTTP publications to meet the immediate needs of the warfighter. 
This MTTP publication has been prepared by ALSSA under our direction for 
implementation by our respective commands and for use by other commands as 
appropriate.

PREFACE 
1. Purpose
This publication will improve coordination and understanding during multi-Service
operations. A brevity code is a code that provides no security. Its sole purpose is the
shortening of messages rather than the concealment of content.
2. Scope
This publication standardizes air-to-air, air-to-surface, surface-to-air, surface-to-surface,
maritime air, and maritime-to-maritime brevity codes regardless of communication
medium (voice/chat), and brevity codes (abbreviations) specific for use in tactical chat.
The scope is limited to brevity codes used in multi-Service operations. All Services
agree to these brevity code meanings. These brevity codes have been forwarded to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for inclusion or modification of the NATO
Allied Procedural Publication (APP)-7, Joint Brevity Words, and other allied
communications publications.
3. Applicability
This publication is for Service members conducting operations at the tactical level.

STANDARD TACTICAL CHAT ABBREVIATIONS  
Background 
Due to the significant proliferation of tactical chat (TC) systems, a list of common 
acronyms, abbreviations, and terms has been incorporated into this publication. TC has 
expanded to multiple platforms, users, and locations and is commonly used as a C2 
tool. A broader audience than the end user often monitors and acts upon the 
information. Therefore, it is necessary to make TC abbreviations available and widely 
distributed to educate all users. Like a brevity code, a TC abbreviation provides no 
security and is only meant to shorten messages, not conceal their content. 
 
TC does not replace formal communications. Its use must be consistent with existing 
doctrine and established procedures. TC, like brevity codes, requires discipline to 
minimize ambiguity and facilitate the understanding of messages sent and received. 
Users may be joint or multinational personnel and plain language may be the most 
effective means of passing information, especially with new users or when giving 
commands. Therefore, users should avoid generating new terminology and 
abbreviations. 
 
Note: This is a list of recommended acronyms, abbreviations, and terms used to 
expedite information flow but not at the expense of clarity and accuracy of the 
information being sent. The list was developed by subject matter experts and operators 
of TC to streamline communications, mitigate miscommunications, and minimize traffic 
populating a chat room. Every effort should be made to use approved terms detailed in 
Service, multi-Service, and joint publications.
