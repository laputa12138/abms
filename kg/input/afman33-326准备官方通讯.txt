Chapter 1 
COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT 
1.1.  Overview.   This publication provides Air Force personnel guidance and procedures for the 
administrative processes for preparing and submitting written correspondence. Manage 
correspondence in accordance with the authority in Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 
(DoDD) 5105.53, Director of Administration and Management. Examples and reference material 
for Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense and correspondence, Office of the Secretary 
of Defense and DoD components can be found in DoD 5110.04-M-V1, DoD Manual for Written 
Material: Correspondence Management and  DoD 5110.04-M-Volume 2, DoD Manual for 
Written Material: Examples and Reference Material. Air Force units at all levels ensure written 
correspondence is executed properly for processing and distributed through appropriate channels. 
1.2.  Formats Unique to the Headquarters Air Force (HAF). 
1.2.1.  The HAF formats differ from some of the other types of correspondence processes 
prescribed in this manual. These formats are unique to the HAF and are used for 
correspondence for preparing and submitting to the HAF, the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense, and the President of the United States, located in Washington, DC. 
1.2.2.  Airmen prepare all official correspondence communicated between and through the 
Secretariat of the Air Force (SAF), Air Staff and Air Force leadership (including, but not 
limited to, Secretary of the Air Force; Under Secretary of the Air Force; Chief of Staff of the 
Air Force; Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force; Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force 
and the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force) using the formats/process prescribed in 
Headquarters Operating Instructions (HOI) 33-3, Correspondence Preparation, Control and 
Tracking. 
1.3.  Plain Language.  Prepare all AF correspondence using plain language. The Plain Writing 
Act of 2010, is the law that is the law that promotes “…clear Government communication that the 
public can understand and use.” Plain language saves the AF time, effort, and money. Key concepts 
of plain language to keep in mind are be clear, be concise, and be specific, noted in AFI 33-360, 
Table 6.3 and at https://www.esd.whs.mil/DD/plainlanguage/. 
1.3.1.  Organize your material to help the reader. Identify your audience for the document; 
write to get their attention and anticipate their questions. Consider any additional readers. 
Always start by putting your main message up front. Present information in the succeeding 
paragraphs in a logical order. 
1.3.2.  Avoid words and phrases that your readers might not understand. Define each 
abbreviation or acronym the first time you use it. Use the same term consistently to identify a 
specific thought or object. Use words in a way that does not conflict with ordinary or accepted 
usage. Avoid ambiguous phrasing, confusing legal terms, and technical jargon that can mislead 
your reader. 
1.3.3.  Use “you” and other pronouns to speak directly to readers (active voice). Do not refer 
to people as if they were inanimate objects. Address the reader as “you.” “You” reinforces the 
message intended for your reader. Use “we” in place of your organization’s name. Be careful 
using “you” if it sounds accusatory or insulting. Instead, put the emphasis on the organization 
4 
AFMAN33-326  31 JULY 2019 
by using “we.” Example of a passive voice is “The commander’s call will be organized by the 
executive officer.” Notice the subject (actor)—the executive officer—as receiver of the action. 
1.3.4.  Active voice is the best way to identify who is responsible for what action. To 
communicate effectively, write the strong majority (around 75%) of your sentences in the 
active voice. Example of an active voice is “The executive officer organized the commander’s 
call.” Notice the subject (actor) comes first in the sentence. 
1.3.5.  Short sentences deliver a clear message. Average sentences to 15 to 20 words--never 
make them longer than 40 words. Break up your idea into its logical parts and make each one 
the subject of its own sentence. Eliminate unnecessary words. 
1.4.  Writers’ Responsibilities. 
1.4.1.  When applicable, use this manual along with other referenced materials for preparing 
written correspondence. 
1.4.2.  Protect and mark any classified information in your correspondence according to DoD 
5200.01-M, Volume 1, DoD Information Security Program: Overview, Classification, and 
Declassification, DoD 5200.01-M, Volume 2, DoD Information Security Program: Marking 
of Information, DoD 5200.01-M, Volume 3, DoD Information Security Program: Protection 
of Classified Information, DoD 5200.01-M, Volume 4, DoD Information Security Program: 
Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and AFI 16-1404, Air Force Information Security 
Program. Distribute correspondence on a need-to-know basis. Additional references below 
can also be utilized. 
1.4.3.  Follow AFI 16-1404, if you include “For Official Use Only” information or DoD 
5200.01-M, Vol 4.  If the document contains personally identifiably information (PII), refer to 
AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program.

1.4.5.  Conserve paper. Consider whether you can communicate with other means such as 
telephone or email. Do not print and mail out correspondence originally sent by email, unless 
requested. Satisfy the minimum distribution requirements only. 
1.4.6.  Select the appropriate distribution method. Consider the needs of the recipient when 
choosing the distribution method. When transmitting sensitive unclassified information by 
email, apply an appropriate level of safeguards to ensure the sensitive, but unclassified, 
information is properly protected. 
1.4.7.  Follow AFI 33-324, The Air Force Information Collections and Reports Management 
Program for information collecting and reporting of internal and public requirements. This 
includes the licensing of internal information reports and collections and/or requesting 
information from the public in accordance with Chapter 35 of Public Law 104-13, The 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. 
1.4.8.  When transmitting classified email, take care to transmit only on a system certified and 
accredited for that level of classified information. 
1.5.  Suspense Actions. 
1.5.1.  Set realistic time limits for answering priority and routine correspondence. 
1.5.2.  Control the suspense at all offices tasked with answering correspondence. Notify the 
originating agency before the due date if the reply is delayed. 
1.6.  Coordination Process. 
1.6.1.  Coordinate with offices affected by the proposed action during the draft stage to keep 
from revising the final version. Consider the chain of command to ensure complete 
coordination. Schedule enough time to finish review and coordination. 
1.6.2.  Coordinate using AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet (electronic, Task Management 
Tool, or hardcopy).

3.1.1.  Original.  Use white letterhead stationery (printed or computer-generated) for the first 
page of a memorandum, staff study, report, or minutes of a meeting. Use plain white paper for 
continuation pages. (See paragraph 3.4 for computer-generated letterhead.) 
3.1.2.  Copies.  Use plain white paper for information or courtesy copies.

3.2.  Standard Letterhead.  DoD 5110.04-M-V1, establishes the standards for letterhead. There 
are only two types of letterhead authorized for use: standard (pre-printed) and computer-generated. 
Submit request for exceptions to the standards through your MAJCOM to SAF/CN for final 
determination. Air National Guard exceptions are approved by individual Air National Guard State 
Headquarters or the Director, Air National Guard (T-1). 
3.3.  Pre-printed Letterhead.  See Figure 3.1 for an example of letterhead. MAJCOMs may elect 
to use generic two-line command letterhead for command-wide use. MAJCOMs may authorize 
letterhead below wing-level if the quantity needed justifies the printing cost or other circumstances 
warrant. Any unit without its own letterhead uses its parent unit’s letterhead stationery and 
identifies its organization and standard office symbol in the FROM caption. 
3.3.1.  Ink.  Print the letterhead and seal using either ultramarine blue blue or black ink (see 
paragraph A2.2 for description of acceptable ink color). 
3.3.2.  Seal.  The DoD seal is one inch in diameter. Align the seal 1/2-inch from the upper left 
and top edge of the paper. Do not use any other emblem, decorative device, or distinguishing 
insignia with or in place of the DoD seal. 
AFMAN33-326  31 JULY 2019 
9 
3.3.3.  Format.  Center organization name and address on the letterhead using no more than 
four lines: 
3.3.3.1.  First Line.  DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. Center this line leaving 5/8-
inch from the top of the sheet. Print it in 12 point font uppercase using copperplate plate 
Gothic bold, or equivalent. 
3.3.3.2.  Second Line.  Center the name of the organization listed in the G-series special 
order that established it. If G-series orders do not exist, the MAJCOM Director of 
Communications decides the second line. Put HEADQUARTERS before the 
organization’s name only if it appears in the activation order. Print in 10.5 point uppercase 
using copperplate plate Gothic bold, or equivalent. If the name is more than fifty characters, 
you may use an additional line. 
3.3.3.3.  Third Line.  If used, center the location without the ZIP+4 code on this line. Print 
in 10.5 point uppercase using copperplate plate Gothic bold. The bottom of the third line 
is 1 1/16 inches from the top of the sheet. If your unit is overseas, do not show the Army 
and AF Post Office or Fleet Post Office number and a geographical location together. You 
may use the two letter state abbreviation or spell out the state name. Do not use punctuation 
in the last line of the address element.

3.3.4.  Optional Items.  Fold marks are guides for judging typing space and for folding the 
paper in three equal parts. Typist guidelines show you are near the 1-inch bottom margin. If 
used, print them in half-point rules (see Figure 3.1). 
3.4.  Computer-Generated Letterhead.  Computer-generated letterhead allows for the use of 
plain white paper and high production rates. It also permits an organization to generate its own 
letterhead stationery. 
3.4.1.  Use.  You may use computer-generated letterhead the same as printed letterhead when 
the design satisfies all specifications in paragraph 3.3. Use computer-generated letterhead 
only for correspondence within the DoD. Do not use for the signature of the Secretary or 
10 
AFMAN33-326  31 JULY 2019 
Deputy Secretary of Defense, or Executive Secretary of the DoD. MAJCOMs may direct the 
use of printed letterhead for headquarters and subordinate units. 
3.4.2.  Format.  When using computer-generated letterhead, you may identify the office name 
as approved in organizational designation documents. Center the office name below the 
organization name. You may identify the complete mailing address including ZIP+4 code. Do 
not use more than four lines for the letterhead. 
3.5.  Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Letterhead.  HAF offices use this stationery, as do certain 
Field Operating Agencies when their commanders function as members of the HAF. 
3.6.  DoD Programs and Activities Letterhead.  When issuing correspondence in the capacity 
of the designated DoD Executive Agent for a DoD directed program (designated in accordance 
with DoDI 5101.1, DoD Executive Agent), do not show the DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR 
FORCE on the top line.  If letterhead format is similar to paragraph 3.1, use the layout prescribed 
in paragraphs 3.6.1 and 3.6.2, instead. 
3.6.1.  First Line.  Print the name of the program referenced in the DoD program. 
3.6.2.  Second and Third Line.  Print the location. For additional guidance, contact the 
Deputy Chief Information Office, Secretary of the Air Force, Compliance Division

3.7.  Slogans.  MAJCOMs and FOAs may permit use of slogans on official memorandums and 
personalized letters that: 
3.7.1.  Represent the mission of the organization. 
3.7.2.  Are easy to understand. 
3.7.3.  Are not offensive. 
3.7.4.  Meet printing specifications (printed approximately 1/2-inch from bottom of page). 
3.8.  Logograms (Logos).  Do not use the Department of the AF seal on stationery; the proper use 
of the Department of the AF seal is covered in Attachment 2. DoD 5110.04-M-V1 prohibits use 
of logos, emblems, decorative devices, or distinguishing insignia printed or otherwise on 
stationery. The Office of the Secretary of Defense grants waivers only for programs of AF-wide 
importance and applicability, such as the AF Seventieth Anniversary. Send waiver request to 
SAF/CN for staffing to Office of the Secretary of Defense through the Washington Headquarters 
AFMAN33-326  31 JULY 2019

Services for approval. SAF/CNZA initiates waiver request coordination and prepares applicable 
approval responses for distributions. Organizations will continue to utilize existing logo stationery 
until supplies are exhausted. (T-1).

THE OFFICIAL MEMORANDUM, COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT FORMS 
AND OTHER TYPES OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATION 
4.1.  Official Memorandums.  See AFH 33-337 for formatting of official memorandums. 
4.2.  AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet.   Use the AF Form 1768 or a similar electronic version

assembling, and coordination steps. Follow local guidance for formatting electronic versions of 
the AF Form 1768 when applicable. 
4.2.1.  Try to resolve all differences when you receive a non-concurrence on an AF Form 1768. 
4.2.2.  If you cannot resolve the differences, the action officer needs to write a rebuttal 
memorandum to the approval authority stating the differences discussed with the non-
concurring official explaining why the proposed action was not changed.

Chapter 5 
GUIDE AND FORM MEMORANDUMS 
5.1.  Guide Memorandums.  These are models of a memorandum text composed in advance, but 
not printed. They may be complete memorandums with several paragraphs or a single paragraph. 
Use guide memorandums to compose official memorandums. Select the combination of 
paragraphs appropriate for the reply. 
5.2.  Form Memorandums.  These are mass-produced memos sent in place of individually 
composed or typed memorandums when many individuals require similar information or the same 
individual requires the information at frequent intervals. These also include standard formats 
stored on electronic media that can be accessed, completed with optional data, and then printed or 
electronically forwarded. 
5.2.1.  Types of Form Memorandums.  There are three basic memorandums formats: 
prewritten, fill-in, and optional statement. A form memorandum allows the writer the option 
of selecting from one of several pre-filled statements or a blank space for filling in information. 
An optional statement form memorandums allows the writer to check the statements that apply 
to a specific situation. 
5.2.2.  Form Memorandums Use.  Use form memorandums when the subject matter and the 
action are routine or informational, when it is more economical to duplicate the memorandum 
than to type each memorandum individually, and when the printed format expedites response 
from the recipient. Do not use form memorandums if the subject is of a personal or 
congratulatory nature, if it may bring grief, disappointment, or embarrassment to the recipient, 
or if a numbered form would be better. 
5.2.3.  Preparing and Controlling Form Memorandums. 
5.2.3.1.  Justification.  Analyze your correspondence for a 2-week period and group 
memorandums that are similar in meaning and purpose. Count the number of individually 
typed memorandums for each group. Refer to Table 5.1 when determining if a form 
memorandum is justified. 
Table 5.1.  Form Memorandum (Justified). 
The line count (text) of a repetitive 
memorandum is: 
And 
the 
number 
of 
similar 
memorandums written each month is: 
 
 
5 
30 or more 
10 
15 or more 
15 
10 or more 
5.2.3.2.  Composition.  Follow the principles of writing in AFH 33-337. Consider the 
memorandum’s impact, especially if sent outside the AF. If a memorandum collects 
information, review the requirements of Public Law 104-13 and AFI 33-324. 
AFMAN33-326  31 JULY 2019 
15 
5.2.3.3.  Design.  Leave enough blank space to complete a fill-in form memorandum. 
Align check boxes () on an optional statement form memorandum. 
5.2.3.4.  Signature.  Sign form memorandums individually or sign the master before 
reproduction. 
5.2.3.5.  Control.  Identify each form or guide memorandum by a different symbol if you 
have more than one, e.g. FM-1, FM-2, etc. You may mark the memorandums themselves 
or their folders. Review the need and currency of the memorandum before reproduction, 
and reproduce no more than a 3-month supply. 
5.3.  Other Written Communication Types.  For other written communications, see AFH 33-
337 and DoD 5110.04-M-V1.

with flames in natural color that shows striking power through the use of aerospace. The 
thunderbolt consists of an AF yellow vertical twist with three natural color flames on each 
end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight lightning bolts. The background of the 
top part is light blue representing the sky. The lower part is white representing metal silver. 
A2.2.2.  The 13 white encircling stars represent the original 13 colonies. 
A2.2.3.  The AF yellow numerals under the shield are 1947. This is the year the AF was 
established. 
A2.2.4.  The band encircling the whole design is white edged in AF yellow with black lettering. 
The inscriptions read “Department of the Air Force” on the top part and “United States of 
America” on the lower part.
