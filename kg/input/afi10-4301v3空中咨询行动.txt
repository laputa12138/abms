Chapter 1 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1.  Purpose.  The purpose of this instruction is to provide Air Force guidance and direction for 
the planning, execution, and assessment of USAF air advising operations with partner nations.  
The objective is to harmonize and synchronize the wide range of US security cooperation (SC) 
activities in order to better achieve US national strategic objectives. 
1.2.  Background. 
1.2.1.  Air advising is an Air Force capability employed throughout the full range of military 
operations in support of combatant commander (CCDR), commander Air Force forces 
(COMAFFOR), or theater special operations command (TSOC) objectives.  Air advising can 
create tactical, operational, and strategic-level effects. 
1.2.1.1.  Air Advising Operations.  Air advising operations focus on supporting and 
developing employment, sustainment, and integration of partner nation aviation 
enterprise capabilities in support of CCDR, COMAFFOR and/or TSOC objectives across 
the range of military operations. 
1.2.1.2.  Air advising operations include, but are not limited to: subject-matter expert 
exchanges, exercises and competitions, mobile training team (MTT) and extended 
training service specialists (ETSS) deployments, global health engagements, agile combat 
support engagements, DoD State Partnership Program engagements, and operations in 
support of request for forces (RFF) and/or request for support (RFS) taskings. 
1.2.1.3.  Air advising operations are conducted through various SC initiatives and 
programs, including building partner capacity, security force assistance (SFA), foreign 
internal defense, and support to security assistance (SA).  Authorities and funding for 
these activities for the Department of Defense is usually found in Title 10 United States 
Code (USC), Armed Forces and for the Department of State is usually found in Title 22 
USC, Foreign Relations and Intercourse.  Further details on specific authorities are found 
in Attachment 2. 
1.2.1.4.  The Chief of Mission is an important stakeholder in Air Advisor operations, as 
his/her concurrence is required prior to air advising operations which are not under the 
sole purview of the CCDR.  COM objectives for the partner nation are addressed in 
CCDR and COMAFFOR/TSOC country plans at the operational level.  Air Advisor plans 
at the tactical level support these country plans. 
1.2.2.  Total Force Airmen assigned to conduct air advising operations may reside in 
designated Air Advisor units or the Conventional Force (CF) and should be tasked through 
the Joint Staff’s Global Force Management (GFM) process. 
1.2.3.  Title 22 programs such as International Military Education and Training, Foreign 
Military Financing (FMF), and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) are part of the Department of 
State (DoS) foreign operations budget. 
6 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
1.2.3.1.  Air Advisors may execute Title 22-funded missions as part of a MTT or as an 
individual deployment.  Funding for Title 22 missions is managed through the Air Force 
Security Assistance Training Squadron (AFSAT). 
1.2.3.2.  Although Air Advisors executing Title 22 MTTs are under the operational 
oversight of the Chief of Mission, the Commander with Operational Control (OPCON) 
will manage Air Advisors.  (T-2). 
1.3.  Scope. 
1.3.1.  This instruction addresses USAF air advising operations conducted in support of 
geographical combatant commander (GCC) operation plans, theater campaign plans (TCPs), 
bi- or multi-lateral exercises, and GCC country plans. 
1.3.1.1.  These air advising operations are primarily documented in the Air Force 
campaign support plan (CSP), the TSOC CSP, the specific COMAFFOR country plans, 
and United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) country support plans. 
1.3.1.2.  When directives and tasks assigned in this instruction conflict with specific 
guidance from the GCC to Air Force Forces (AFFOR) staffs, GCC guidance takes 
precedence. 
1.3.2.  This instruction expands upon guidance contained in SC related AFIs to encompass 
the larger air advising community and establish a common framework to better synchronize a 
wide range of USAF air advising operations.  References to related AFIs are made 
throughout this instruction for completeness and consistency. 
1.3.3.  Detailed air advising procedures and checklists in Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and 
Procedures (AFTTP) 3-4.5, Air Advising, should be used in conjunction with this AFI. 
1.3.4.  Air Advisors should consult AFI 10-421, Operations Planning for the Steady-State, 
for specific planning, execution, and assessment guidance related to country, event, and 
training/capacity plans.

AIR ADVISING OPERATIONS 
3.1.  Mission Description. 
3.1.1.  Security Cooperation, as defined in Joint Publication (JP) 3-20, Security Cooperation, 
encompasses all activities with foreign security establishments to build security relationships 
that promote specific United States security interests, develop allied and partner nation 
military and security capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide 
United States forces with peacetime and contingency access. 
3.1.2.  Air advising is the Air Force’s operational arm of SC and it occurs across all levels of 
the Governance, Executive, Generating, and Operating (G-EGO) functions of a partner 
nation, as defined by the Joint Center for International Security Force Assistance (JCISFA).  
(See Figure 3.1). 
Figure 3.1.  JCISFA G-EGO Functional Descriptions. 
Structure 
Function 
Basic Description 
 
Prime 
Minister & 
Parliament 
 
Governance 
Provides a partner nation government the means to 
organize and purpose a foreign security force by way 
of laws and policy; and, to provide necessary 
resources to the foreign security forces.  Typical 
instruments within this function include general law 
and annual authorizations generated by actions in the 
lower and upper domains of a partner nation 
parliament. 
 
Foreign Security

AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
3.1.3.  The overall goal of air advising is to support US strategic objectives, GCC theater 
strategies, and TCPs by working with and through partner nations in the development, 
sustainment, and employment of their aviation enterprises.  Air advising operations can occur 
inside partner nations or in the US and consist of personnel interacting with partner nation 
personnel at the strategic, operational and tactical levels within the G-EGO framework (See 
Figure 3.2).  These interactions span a wide range of events and include activities such as 
addressing technical skills on the flight line; understanding and integrating space and 
cyberspace capabilities; learning and exercising operational skills in the command center; 
conducting flying operations in foreign or US aircraft; and teaching managerial skills at a 
headquarters or other staff levels. 
Figure 3.2.  JCISFA G-EGO Function and Process Structure. 
 
 
3.2.  Types of Engagements.  Air advising operations can support various types of engagements 
and are designed to accomplish specific objectives.  The following types are illustrative of the 
wide range of engagements, but should not be considered all inclusive.  Each is designed to 
address some aspect of the partner nations’ aviation enterprise and is tailored to the partner 
nations’ specific needs.  To maximize the impact to the partner nation’s aviation enterprise 
development, air advising operations must be part of a persistent presence with focused 
engagements by trained personnel over a number of years. 
 
 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
19 
3.2.1.  Defense Institution Building.  SC activities that empower partner nation defense 
institutions to establish or re-orient their policies and structures to make their defense sector 
more transparent, accountable, effective, affordable, and responsible to civilian control.  It 
improves defense governance, increases the sustainability of other DoD SC programs, and is 
carried out in cooperation with partner nations pursuant to appropriate and available legal 
authority.  It is typically conducted at the ministerial, general, joint staff, military service 
headquarters, and related defense agency level, and when appropriate, with other supporting 
defense entities. 
3.2.2.  Building Partnerships and/or International Relationships.  This type of engagement is 
focused on building relationships and rapport with partner nation personnel.  These 
engagements can include initial “door-opening” activities and periodic military-to-military 
discrete engagements at either a senior-level or subject matter expert level to address specific 
areas within the aviation enterprise.  This type of engagement can facilitate US access to 
partner nation facilities required during both peacetime and contingency operations.  Finally, 
maintaining these relationships over time can further US strategic interests as partner nation 
personnel become senior leaders of their military or government. 
3.2.3.  Building Partner Capabilities and/or Capacities.  This type of engagement is focused 
on increasing the capabilities and/or capacities of the partner nation’s aviation enterprise.  
This type of engagement can include a wide range of activities, from developing the basic 
infrastructure and support systems of an aviation enterprise to training partner nation 
personnel to perform military aviation missions such as airlift and personnel recovery.  
However, activities should be tailored to the partner nation’s needs and capabilities, based on 
economic, infrastructure, and human capital factors, to ensure the partner nation can operate 
and sustain their capabilities. 
3.2.4.  Joint Training and Interoperability.  This type of engagement is focused on joint and 
coalition training that can lead to increased interoperability among joint and coalition forces.  
Examples of this type of engagement are bilateral and multilateral exercises and 
competitions, joint combined exchange training missions conducted by SOF, and the 
involvement of forward-stationed forces, teams, and individual liaison officers that train and 
operate with international allies and partners on a daily basis. 
3.3.  Team Composition. 
3.3.1.  Provider Organizations.  Air advising teams should be formed from designated Air 
Advisor units.  If necessary, air advising teams can be formed on an as-needed basis from 
organizations with the required specialty and/or expertise.  Air advising units may be 
established in theater (such as the air expeditionary wings previously established in Iraq and 
Afghanistan) or in the Continental United States (such as the 81 FS, 571 and 818 MSASs).  
Air advising teams may be composed of personnel from one or more organizations, and 
consist of AFSOF, AF CF, other services, government civilians, and coalition personnel 
trained for the air advising activity.  Note: For information on air advising team and unit 
organizational structures reference AFTTP 3-4.5. 
 
 
20 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
3.3.2.  Personnel and/or Size.  CF and SOF air advising teams are generally cross functional, 
task and/or mission oriented, and comprised of personnel proficient in a wide variety of AF 
specialty codes.  Capability to achieve specific mission requirements and the potential 
operating environment (i.e., permissive to hostile and/or uncertain) are key factors in 
personnel selection.  The team lead or mission commander will ensure the required team 
composition meets minimum mission and operational requirements.  (T-1).  Total team size 
is mission dependent but also must remain within partner nation expectations, agreements, 
and specific approvals.  (T-0).  Teams may have capability to operate in a self-contained 
independent package, to include force protection, or as a dependent package that requires key 
support from the SCO or AF Component (C-MAJCOM/C-NAF [TSOC for SOF teams]) 
while in the theater, or significant reachback support from outside the theater.  AFSOF teams 
are task organized as Operational Aviation Detachments and tailored to the specific mission. 
3.3.3.  Training.  Teams may be augmented by members who are not specifically trained as 
Air Advisors.  In these cases, sourced and sourcing units will ensure that augmentees meet 
requirements commensurate with mission objectives and environment.  (T-1).  These training 
requirements include those elements and tasks required for augmentees to integrate and 
operate with team members and supported and/or partnered elements.  In order to improve 
both response times to CCDR requirements and the overall quality of an Air Advisor team, 
command staffs and career field managers should work together to provide trained and 
available personnel.  For mission planning and execution, team leads, mission commanders, 
and/or requirement owners may levy additional training. 
3.3.3.1.  Designated and expeditionary Air Advisor units will ensure their Air Advisors 
are trained IAW AFI 10-4301V1.  (T-1). 
3.3.3.2.  Global Force Management requests for personnel sourcing should identify the 
number of Air Advisors required to support a SC mission.  When Conventional Forces 
are sourced through means other than GFM, AFFOR staffs and SCOs will ensure that the 
air advising team consists of a minimum of 2 trained Air Advisors or 10 percent of the 
advising team, whichever is greater.  (T-1).  When required, round up to nearest whole 
Air Advisor; for example, a team size of 25 requires 2.5 qualified advisors so the team 
lead should have 3 trained Air Advisors or a waiver to execute with less. 
3.3.3.3.  Theater entry and/or country clearance requirements may dictate additional 
training for air advising teams. 
3.4.  Synchronization of Air Advising Operations. 
3.4.1.  Air advising operations are most effective when planned as a series of continuing 
engagements designed to meet definitive GCC SC objectives; however, not all countries need 
or will have a persistent engagement to have successful SC partnership.  Since air advising 
operations are part of the larger SC program in the partner nation, Air Advisors shall ensure 
that missions are planned, approved, executed and assessed in coordination with the 
respective Air Component and Country Team.  (T-3). 
 
 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
21 
3.4.2.  Thorough planning and synchronization of all air advising operations in a partner 
nation is critical, to include AFSOC Combat Aviation Advisors, Mobility Support Advisory 
Squadron, Contingency Response Group Air Advisors, and State Partnership Program 
personnel.  Air advising operations are often conducted by leveraging expertise from 
multiple organizations to meet US objectives and the requirements of the partner nation.  The 
AFFOR/TSOC staff works with the SCO personnel to assist in coordinating and 
synchronizing all air advising operations with the TSOC, other GCC components, and, as 
appropriate, with other AFFOR and MAJCOM staffs.  The objective is to ensure all activities 
are mutually supporting and complementary, create a persistent engagement relationship with 
the partner nation, and provide synergistic effects focused on the long-term strategies and 
objectives of the GCC.

Chapter 4 
AUTHORITIES FOR AIR ADVISING OPERATIONS 
4.1.  Background 
4.1.1.  All DoD interactions with international partners are governed by specific legal 
authorities, which in turn authorize, fund, and establish constraints on air advising operations.  
Authorities used for air advising operations are subsets of authorities for security 
cooperation.  Authorities may have expiration dates; therefore, Airmen must be mindful of 
whether Congress permits a temporary authority to expire or chooses to extend its application 
for a longer period.  (T-0). 
4.1.2.  In addition to the Congressional authorization for an activity, Congress must also 
appropriate funds before execution.  Identifying applicable authorities and appropriations and 
determining the most appropriate ones to use can be complex and requires careful and 
thorough review and planning in order to properly facilitate air advising operations.  AFFOR 
staffs and/or SAF/IA coordinate with GCC staffs to ensure appropriate funding and 
authorities are available or programmed to conduct specific air advising operations. 
4.2.  Compliance Requirements 
4.2.1.  In all situations and environments, DAF personnel must ensure they comply with 
applicable US, foreign, and international law as they work to advance US strategic 
objectives.  (T-0).  If Air Advisors have questions regarding what activities they are 
authorized to execute, they should seek legal advice from the appropriate legal office on 
available authorities and funding for proposed air advising operations. 
4.2.2.  Detailed information regarding SC authorities can be found in Attachment 2.

Chapter 5 
PERSONNEL SELECTION AND MANAGEMENT 
5.1.  Personnel Selection. 
5.1.1.  Attaining SC objectives is critically dependent upon selecting individuals with the 
requisite skills to ensure success.  Since Airmen conducting air advising operations represent 
the USAF to partner nation personnel, as much as practicable during the selection process, 
units should screen qualifications of potential Air Advisors. 
5.1.2.  For designated forces and/or units, the cross-functional authority, working with the 
functional area manager and current commander in conjunction with the gaining 
organization, should ensure personnel being considered for designated Air Advisor 
assignments are screened as part of the selection process.  In addition to standard evaluation 
areas, such as Officer Performance Reports and/or Enlisted Performance Reports, functional 
area expertise, etc., the following areas are considerations for selection: 
5.1.2.1.  Volunteer for the Air Advisor career field. 
5.1.2.2.  Appropriate regional and cultural experience and understanding. 
5.1.2.3.  Appropriate language proficiency. 
5.1.2.4.  Supervisor and/or commander recommendation(s). 
5.1.2.5.  Previous air advising experience or international relations experience. 
5.1.2.6.  Previous Air Advisor education and training. 
5.1.2.7.  Previous curriculum development, teaching or training experience. 
5.1.3.  For expeditionary units, personnel being considered for individual air advising 
operations versus designated Air Advisor positions should be screened using the above 
criteria as a guide prior to selection.  Note: MAJCOMs will apply selection criteria to 
individuals assigned to air advising duties (for both designated and expeditionary forces 
and/or units). 
5.2.  Personnel Tracking. 
5.2.1.  Tracking air advising experience and Air Advisor education and training will enable 
the USAF to provide cross-functional management to quickly identify trained and/or 
experienced personnel for future air advising assignments and deliberately develop 
personnel. 
5.2.2.  Air Advisors receive a special duty identifier IAW AFI 10-4301 V1. 
5.2.3.  Designated units will track air advising missions to capture individual experience for 
upgrade IAW SC workforce management directed by DAFPD 10-43.  (T-3).

5.3.  Personnel Certification.  Qualification of Air Advisors is IAW this AFI.  Certification for 
Combat Aviation Advisors and MSAS Air Advisors is IAW this AFI and MAJCOM guidance. 
5.4.  Readiness. 
5.4.1.  DAF units with designated Air Advisor manpower positions will report readiness 
status IAW AFI 10-201.  (T-2).  The Air Force component A3 is responsible for establishing 
readiness requirements for their given AOR. 
5.4.2.  Organizations with designated Air Advisor manpower positions will include air 
advising tasks in their core Mission Essential Task Lists.  (T-1).

Chapter 6 
PLANNING 
6.1.  General.  Thorough and comprehensive planning is critical to ensuring the achievement of 
US national security strategy objectives in the most effective way possible.  In addition, strategy-
driven plans justify resources and enable operational assessment.  Airmen involved in the 
planning, execution, and assessment of air advising operations need to be familiar with CCMD 
campaign plans and COMAFFOR/TSOC CSPs, as these plans link country plans and Air 
Advisor operations with national-level strategy and objectives.  Country plans developed by the 
AFFOR staff or TSOC inform event and training/capacity plans developed by Air Advisors. 
6.2.  Planning Guidance. 
6.2.1.  Air Advisors must be proficient in operational planning.  (T-3).  Formal training, 
professional military education, and experience are the primary means to acquire proficiency 
in planning air advising operations.  Attachment 3 to this AFI provides a non-inclusive list 
of key references that Airmen should consult when planning, executing, and assessing Air 
Advisor operations. 
6.2.2.  Baseline assessments are a critical step in the development of country, event, and 
training/capacity plans.  Specifically, the baseline assessment of military objectives enables 
the development of an operational approach that clearly outlines a game plan to move from a 
baseline state to an end state. 
6.2.3.  As in all operational plans, the establishment of military objectives is a critical step in 
the planning process. 
6.2.3.1.  Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives 
enable mission execution and support the COMAFFOR/TSOC operational assessment 
process.  SMART objectives, when defined further with effects and tasks, provide a 
doctrinally-sound framework for executing and assessing Air Advisor operations. 
6.2.3.2.  Effects are supported by measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and tasks are 
supported by MOPs.  Requirements owners should articulate MOEs and MOPs at each 
planning level (tactical, operational, and theater-strategic) and should be referenced in 
Air Advisor after action reports to enable the refinement of follow-on planning and 
engagements. 
6.2.3.3.  Expeditionary units, AFFOR and TSOC staffs generate MOEs, MOPs, and 
metrics and/or indicators to determine if air advising operations support the achievement 
of defined objectives.  Evaluation products use the MOEs to answer the question, “Are 
we doing the right things?” and MOPs to answer, “Are we doing things right?” An 
expanded discussion of MOEs and MOPs is provided in JP 5-0, Joint Planning, Chapter 
VI. 
 
 
26 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
6.3.  Theater-Wide and Regional Plans (Theater-Strategic Level). 
6.3.1.  AFFOR and TSOC staffs, in conjunction with the CCMD staff, SCOs, and country 
teams, accomplish both theater-wide and regional planning.  Theater-wide and regional 
planning follow the directions contained in the GCC TCP and are aligned with requirements 
of the AFFOR or TSOC CSP. 
6.3.1.1.  GCC TCP.  The TCP is the GCC’s plan to accomplish strategic or operational 
objectives within a geographic AOR.  This plan operationalizes the CCDR’s theater 
strategy and translates strategic concepts into unified actions.  The TCP integrates steady-
state activities, which include ongoing operations, security cooperation, and other 
shaping activities.  Contingency plans for responding to crisis scenarios are treated as 
branch plans to the campaign plan. 
6.3.1.2.  TSOC/COMAFFOR CSP.  The TSOC/COMAFFOR CSP is an operations plan 
at the theater-strategic level, summarizing steady-state, component-specific operations in 
support of the CCDR TCP.  The TSOC/COMAFFOR CSP operationalizes the 
TSOC/COMAFFOR strategy.  The scope and planning horizon of the CSP normally 
align with the TCP. 
6.3.2.  AFFOR and TSOC staffs should be proactive in advocating for the development and 
sustainment of aviation enterprise capabilities and capacities within the theater that supports 
the implementation of the CCMD campaign plans. 
6.3.3.  Regional planning is accomplished in much the same way as theater-wide planning, 
but is focused on specific regions of a theater and is thus smaller in scope.  Regional planning 
can be used to address objectives that are specific to a given region, such as, promoting 
regional stability and assistance, US-regional cooperation, and interoperability among the 
partner nations in the region.  Regional planning allows for a more focused effort in areas of 
strategic importance to the US and should complement theater-wide planning. 
6.4.  Security Cooperation Plans (Operational Level). 
6.4.1.  Operational level planning is accomplished in coordination with the CCMD staff, 
SCOs, SAF/IA, and individual country teams.  Country planning follows the direction 
contained in the GCC TCP, aligns with requirements of the AFFOR or TSOC CSP and the 
US Embassy Integrated Country Strategy (ICS). 
6.4.2.  Department of State ICS.  ICSs are 3-year DoS-developed country plans that serve as 
single, multi-year, overarching strategies that encapsulate US government policy priorities, 
objectives, and the means by which diplomatic engagement, foreign assistance, and other 
tools will be used to achieve national objectives. 
6.4.2.1.  The ICS codifies DoS goals and objectives across the spectrum of foreign policy 
areas (e.g., security, development, health, agriculture, trade, education, etc.) through a 
coordinated and collaborative planning effort at the country level and are flexible enough 
to accommodate emerging threats. 
6.4.2.2.  The ICS serves as the core organizing document for security sector assistance 
efforts in each country and will inform individual agencies’ security sector assistance 
planning and budget requests. 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020

6.4.3.  GCC Country Plan.  The country plan is the GCC’s primary tool to synchronize DoD 
SC operations in support of the DoS ICS.  The initial focus of country planning should be on 
the GCC priority countries in the theater.  Other than the TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan, 
the GCC country plan is the plan most applicable to the Air Advisor. 
6.4.4.  TSOC/COMAFFOR Country Plan.  The TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan is a SC 
plan at the operational level that aligns with the GCC’s country plan and nests under the 
TSOC/COMAFFOR CSP.  These plans focus on achieving country-level objectives related 
to partner relationships, partner capabilities and capacities, access, and interoperability.  The 
TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan is the plan most applicable to the Air Advisor, as Air 
Advisor-developed tactical plans support and link to the TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan.  
The TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan: 
6.4.4.1.  Identifies desired security roles the GCC would like the partner to play. 
6.4.4.2.  Focuses on achieving US interests and aligns with the intersection of US and 
partner objectives. 
6.4.4.3.  Sequences activities, operations, events, and investments in time and space to 
achieve desired effects.  The most common SC operations include military-to-military 
engagement, training, equipping, and exercises. 
6.4.4.4.  Articulates resource requirements, including a demand signal for SC programs 
and organizations. 
6.4.4.5.  Provides justification for SC funding regardless of funding source. 
6.4.4.6.  Provides justification to request forces through the GFM system. 
6.4.4.7.  Should include phase 0 shaping actions associated with TSOC/COMAFFOR-
developed contingency support plans. 
6.5.  Security Cooperation Plans (Tactical Level). 
6.5.1.  Event Plan.  The event plan is a SC plan at the tactical level, outlining objectives, 
concept of operations, and concept of support for an individual SC action or engagement, 
hereafter referred to as an event.  A detailed event plan builds the linkage between the 
tactical action (event) and the COMAFFOR/TSOC operational-level plan (country plan).  
This vertical linkage is vital because it provides top-down purpose to the event and enables 
bottom-up operational assessment of the country plan and steady-state campaign plan.  The 
event plan: 
6.5.1.1.  Is a detailed SC plan for a specific or discrete steady-state engagement.  Must 
take into account and comply with foreign disclosure guidance governing interactions 
with each international partner. 
6.5.1.2.  Is an internal USAF plan focused on how USAF personnel will prepare, deploy, 
employ, redeploy, and assess the steady-state event.  For SC events, the event plan is not 
shared with the partner nation. 
6.5.1.3.  May be supplemented with a subordinate plan(s) that focuses entirely on a 
partner nation (e.g., training plan, building capacity and/or capability plan, etc.). 
28 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
6.5.1.4.  Articulates preparation, training, rehearsal, funding, equipment, force protection, 
logistics, command relationships, and other requirements necessary for event execution 
and assessment. 
6.5.1.5.  Is developed by any organization or individual formally tasked for the execution 
and assessment of a steady-state event. 
6.5.1.6.  May not be required for all steady-state events due to the event’s importance, 
significance, scope, cost, etc., as determined by C-MAJCOM. 
6.5.1.7.  Must take into account and comply with public laws and authorities that govern 
interactions with international partners.  This is especially relevant to building the 
capacity and capability of partner nations and security assistance events. 
6.5.1.8.  May be executed and funded using a variety of authorities and programs, 
including Title 10, Title 22, and others. 
6.5.1.9.  Addresses the expected duration of event planning, preparation, execution, 
assessment, and after action reporting. 
6.5.1.10.  Is developed using an effects-based approach, ensuring events support 
TSOC/COMAFFOR-established strategy, objectives, effects, and tasks.  Event-level 
objectives are the centerpiece of the event plan, enabling all subordinate planning and 
assessment. 
6.5.1.10.1.  Normally, event-level objectives support tasks in the TSOC/COMAFFOR 
country plan, and are developed by the planning organization in coordination with the 
TSOC/AFFOR staff. 
6.5.1.10.2.  Event-level objectives should be SMART. 
6.5.1.10.3.  Event-level objective baselines should be established prior to the 
development of an operational approach. 
6.5.1.10.4.  Event effects describe the conditions necessary to achieve event 
objectives.  MOEs support the assessment of effects. 
6.5.1.10.5.  Event tasks describe friendly actions to create effects.  MOPs support the 
assessment of tasks. 
6.5.1.10.6.  Event plans are often organized by phases.  For illustration, a single event 
plan may include phases for planning, preparation, site survey, baseline assessment, 
deployment, employment, redeployment, assessment, and after action reporting. 
6.5.1.10.7.  The ability to assess during plan execution should be incorporated into the 
plan at initial creation. 
 
 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
29 
6.5.2.  Training/Capacity Plan.  A training/capacity plan is a SC plan at the tactical level, 
outlining objectives, concept of operations, and concept of support for building partner 
capacity or capability.  In contrast to the event plan that focuses on the specifics of how 
Airmen will execute and assess an individual engagement event, the training/capacity plan is 
entirely focused on the partner nation.  It can be viewed as a very comprehensive and highly 
detailed project management plan for building a partner’s capacity or capability.  A detailed 
training/capacity plan implements, from a building partner capacity/capability perspective, 
the applicable portions of the TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan.  The training/capacity plan: 
6.5.2.1.  Is developed, executed, and assessed in collaboration with the partner nation. 
6.5.2.2.  Is developed for the sole purpose of building a specific capacity or capability 
within a partner nation.  Multiple training/capacity plans may be necessary for a partner 
nation.  A single training/capacity plan may support multiple events. 
6.5.2.3.  Is developed by the planning organization in coordination with the 
TSOC/AFFOR staff. 
6.5.2.4.  May require the integration of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leader 
development and education, personnel, facilities, and policy in order to build a capacity 
or capability. 
6.5.2.5.  Is developed using an effects-based approach. 
6.5.2.5.1.  Although the training/capacity plan may be included as part of an event 
plan, the training/capacity plan primarily supports TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan 
objectives, effects, and tasks. 
6.5.2.5.2.  Objectives are the centerpiece of the training/capacity plan, enabling all 
subordinate planning and assessment. 
6.5.2.5.3.  Objectives should be SMART and developed in collaboration with the 
TSOC/AFFOR staff. 
6.5.2.5.4.  Objective baselines should be established prior to the development of an 
operational approach. 
6.5.2.5.5.  Effects describe the partner conditions necessary to achieve objectives.  
MOEs support the assessment of effects. 
6.5.2.5.6.  Tasks describe partner actions to create effects.  MOPs support the 
assessment of tasks. 
6.5.2.5.7.  Training/capacity plans are often organized by phases.  For illustration, a 
single training/capacity plan may include phases for defining requirements, 
procurement, fielding, initial operating capability, full operating capability, and 
sustainment. 
6.5.2.5.8.  The ability to assess during plan execution should be incorporated into the 
plan at initial creation. 
6.5.3.  Organizations tasked to lead and plan the air advising operations should: 
 
 
30 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
6.5.3.1.  Understand the purpose, scope, and detailed objectives of the air advising 
operations and how it links to US strategic planning objectives. 
6.5.3.2.  Understand how the partner nation’s air force is organized, employed, supported, 
and integrated into the larger context of the partner nation’s national security strategy and 
US planning constructs. 
6.5.3.3.  Understand the partner nation’s civil aviation capabilities and organizational 
structure, and obtain an awareness of how current and future civil aviation development 
could influence its aviation enterprise. 
6.5.3.4.  Understand any previous and ongoing air advising operations in the partner 
nation and their relationship to the activity being planned. 
6.5.3.5.  Ensure all planned air advising operations support CCMD TCPs and country 
plans. 
6.5.3.6.  Incorporate the ability to assess the activity during plan execution during plan 
development. 
6.5.3.7.  Develop the plan using an effects-based approach. 
6.5.3.8.  Define the required air advising resources—manpower, equipment, etc. 
6.5.3.9.  Understand and take into account the ability of the partner nation to sustain the 
capabilities that the organization is tasked to develop. 
6.5.3.10.  Coordinate formal and informal activity details with the AFFOR/TSOC staff 
and with the US country team in the partner nation (e.g., opening ceremonies, closing 
ceremonies, and ice breakers). 
6.5.3.11.  Obtain strategic communications inputs (Public Affairs guidance) from the 
AFFOR/TSOC staff and/or US country team. 
6.5.3.12.  Understand country entry requirements per the Foreign Clearance Guide, and 
lead times associated with Aircraft and Personnel Automated Clearance System, visas, 
etc. 
6.5.3.13.  Plan for the personnel recovery requirements for each phase of the activities. 
6.5.3.14.  Obtain foreign disclosure guidance and review from AFFOR/TSOC staff.

Chapter 7 
EXECUTION 
7.1.  General.  All facets of SC including security assistance, SFA, foreign internal defense, and 
security sector reform may require air advising operations.  Air advising operations function 
across the range of military operations within the categories of indirect support, direct support 
not involving combat, and combat operations. 
7.2.  Interagency Coordination.  Air advising operations are part of the unified actions of the 
GCC and require interagency coordination.  This coordination is led by the CCDR, but must be 
understood by all Airmen prior to the execution of the mission.  (T-2). 
7.3.  Employment Factors.  Key factors that may affect mission execution include: 
7.3.1.  Legal authority and/or funding.  Air Advisors should consult with the appropriate 
legal office to ensure they understand the legal authorities for employment and the funding 
restrictions that limit the conduct of the mission. 
7.3.2.  Foreign Disclosure Limitations.  Only designated foreign disclosure officers may 
approve the disclosure of classified and controlled unclassified information to foreign 
personnel.  Air Advisors will follow foreign disclosure rules and regulations.  (T-0).  USAF 
personnel must ensure compliance with AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and 
Technology Transfer Program (T-1).  AFSOF will comply with appropriate USSOCOM 
directives.  (T-0).  Foreign Disclosure Officers are the only officials authorized to approve 
the transfer of information, files, copies or other documents IAW AFI 16-201.  Air Advisor 
teams should not assume that unclassified or unmarked information is transferrable.  If an 
advisor or team has questions regarding releasability, they should verify with the appropriate 
Foreign Disclosure Officer. 
7.3.3.  Disclosure Involving Equipment Procurement through FMS, Pseudo-FMS or Other 
Transfers.  Air Advisors must adhere to the limits of information transfer concerning specific 
equipment procured or transferred to Foreign Security Forces.  (T-1). 
7.3.4.  Information Operations Impact.  Information Operations are a key consideration at all 
levels of execution.  Strategic communication plans require coordination with the Public 
Affairs office at the appropriate level of command (i.e., SCO, CCDR, C-MAJCOM, TSOC, 
or C- NAF).  Each Air Advisor should review facets of information-related operations that 
may influence or affect the perceptions of the partner nation population, an adversary, or the 
international community. 
7.3.5.  Intelligence Support.  Intelligence assessments of partner nations and potential 
adversary capabilities, capacities, and shortfalls inform air advising operations. 
7.3.6.  Contract Support for Air Advising Operations.  If the activity involves contract 
support, such as maintenance of any equipment or supplies, ensure a contracting officer 
representative is appointed and trained prior to activity initiation.  Ensure the contracting 
officer representative has basic knowledge pertaining to contract maintenance responsibilities 
and is able to reach back to the contracting officer for assistance. 
32 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
7.3.7.  Anti-Terrorism and/or Force Protection.  The COM and SCOs also play an important 
role in force protection, but the primary responsibility sits with the geographic COMAFFOR 
or TSOC.  This is true regardless of whether the Air Advisors are assigned, attached, aligned, 
or unaffiliated with the GCC.  A force protection annex to the event plan is an effective 
method to coordinate force protection with the regional AFFOR.  Commanders, mission 
commanders, and/or team leaders are responsible for implementing anti-terrorism and/or 
force protection measures, OPSEC, COMSEC, and other security measures, such as 
countering a potential insider attack threat, for the air advising activity or operation. 
7.3.8.  Risk Management.  Prior to execution, commanders, mission commanders, and or 
team leaders will conduct a risk assessment and implement required mitigating measures.  
(T-2).  Approval authority for a risk management plan is a minimum of one command level 
above the mission commander and/or team lead. 
7.3.9.  Personnel Recovery.  Squadron or equivalent commanders will ensure PR 
preparedness of assigned forces and that emergency action plans and/or evasion plans of 
action are implemented as required IAW JP 3-50, Personnel Recovery, and CCMD guidance.  
(T-0). 
7.4.  Equipping the Air Advisor, Team, or Unit. 
7.4.1.  The AFFOR staff or TSOC responsible for the theater in which the air advising 
activity will take place, in coordination with the unit tasked to support the mission, should 
define the equipment requirements for the team and provide an equipment list to team 
members.  Minimum required equipment includes unique equipment specific to the air 
advising activity, individual protective equipment, and, if required due to mission and/or 
training objectives, weapons and ammunition. 
7.4.2.  Required equipment is provided to team members by their home organization, the 
SCO, or the AFFOR/TSOC staff depending on travel and or country clearance restrictions.  
Specialized equipment that requires procurement will require a determination of the most 
appropriate funding source based on the executive authority directing the mission. 
7.5.  Command Relationships for Air Advising Teams. 
7.5.1.  Air advising teams support the GCC and COM in the partner nation to which they are 
deployed; the command relationships specified for the deployment support this relationship.  
The advisor team’s specific chain of command and command relationships will be identified 
and briefed to all US units, organizations, and agencies integrated into specific SC efforts 
utilizing Air Advisors or Air Advisor teams.  (T-2). 
7.5.2.  The COMAFFOR/TSOC commander ensures appropriate command and control 
relationships are established for applicable air advising teams, activities, and events in their 
respective AOR.  Command and control relationships should be clearly identified in the 
event plan. 
 
 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
33 
7.6.  Core Task Execution.  Core task execution may range from indirect support operations 
through direct support operations up to and including combat operations. 
7.6.1.  All Air Advisors must operate under the assigned authority granted for application of 
each core task.  (T-0).  If during the execution of the mission it becomes apparent that the 
interaction may exceed that level, the Air Advisor must gain new operational guidance before 
exceeding the authority of the current operational task.  (T-2). 
7.6.2.  Assessing the Partner Nation.  Air advising operations require continuous assessment.  
Initially, Air Advisors should assess a partner nation’s aviation capabilities and limitations 
based on the specific tasks in response to the GCC requirements and the Country Plan.  
Examples of assessment areas can be found in AFTTP 3-4.5 Attachment 4. 
7.6.3.  Training the Partner Nation.  Air Advisors train partner nation military aviation forces 
to operate and sustain indigenous airpower resources and capabilities.  Training can provide a 
doctrinal or procedural foundation for military operations and activities.  Training enables 
foreign aviation forces to accomplish a variety of airpower functional tasks, roles, and 
missions.  Instructional programs impart employable capabilities ranging from technical 
skills, sustainment functions, and tactical flying skills.  Training can be used to close specific 
gaps in foreign skills and to raise the partner nation level of competency. 
7.6.4.  Advising the Partner Nation.  The step from training to advising crosses a political 
threshold requiring at a minimum, Secretary of Defense (SecDef) approval and potentially 
Presidential approval.  As explained in Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-22, Foreign Internal 
Defense advice can include advising central command elements of the host military on the 
capabilities, limitations, and correct use of airpower in a given conflict.  Examples include 
providing mission-related advice on intelligence, maintenance, logistics, communications, 
and administration as well as tactical operations. 
7.6.5.  Assisting the Partner Nation.  Assist operations are unique and may be authorized 
when a partner nation cannot conduct required missions or contingency operations alone.  
Assist operations can also include all types of mission and operational support functions 
working in parallel to support the overall objective.  When specifically authorized, assisting 
can include accompanying a partner nation’s forces in combat operations. 
7.6.6.  Equipping the Partner Nation.  From training through assisting, Air Advisors need to 
understand the legal restrictions involved in equipping their partner nation.  Air Advisors will 
not transfer any equipment and/or information to Foreign Security Forces unless explicitly 
authorized in their mission orders.  (T-0). 
7.7.  Miscellaneous Execution Support. 
7.7.1.  Reachback Support. 
7.7.1.1.  SCO personnel, in coordination with the GCC, assisted by AF Component (C- 
MAJCOM/C-NAF), should function as the central point of contact for reachback support 
for CF air advising teams within their country.  They work with MAJCOMs and other 
agencies and organizations as necessary to provide the support required by the air 
advising team that is not available at the theater level. 
 
 
34 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
7.7.1.2.  Detailed procedures for obtaining reachback support should be established by 
the SCO and AF Component (C-MAJCOM/C-NAF), coordinated with all participating 
reachback organizations, and provided to members of the air advising team prior to 
initiation of the activity. 
7.7.1.3.  TSOCs are expected to function as the central point of contact for reachback 
support to SOF air advising teams deployed within their theater. 
7.7.1.4.  MAJCOMs provide assistance to SCOs/C-MAJCOMs/C-NAFs and TSOCs for 
reachback support not available at the theater level. 
7.7.2.  Joint or Coalition Organizations and Teams.  USAF personnel can be assigned or 
deployed as part of a joint and/or coalition air advising organization or team.  In this 
situation, USAF personnel should follow the policy and procedures established by the US 
commander of the organization or by the team lead. 
7.7.3.  Security Cooperation Management Information Systems. 
7.7.3.1.  The organization with primary responsibility for the execution of an advising 
activity or operation will enter details of the operation into the approved information 
system of record.  (T-1).  (i.e.  Global Theater SC Management Information System [G-
TSCMIS], Socium, etc.). 
7.7.3.2.  Organizations that have air advising events unique to their organization will 
enter those events into G-TSCMIS or the information system of record.  (T-1).  A 
designated person within the activity or operation owns the event from initial data entry 
through assessment and closeout. 
7.8.  Flying and Maintenance Operations. 
7.8.1.  Flight on non-USAF aircraft.  Refer to DAFMAN 11-401, Aviation Management, AFI 
24-605 V2, Air Transportation Operations, applicable supplements, and the following 
paragraphs (as applicable) for guidance and approval authorities.  NOTE: Paragraph 7.8.2 
and its subparagraphs are applicable to flight on foreign-owned military aircraft only.  
Approval for flight in foreign air carrier commercial aircraft is addressed separately by DoDI 
4500.53. 
7.8.2.  Flight on foreign-owned military aircraft.  Compliance with DoDD 5030.61 must be 
accomplished prior to granting approval for USAF personnel (uniformed service members, 
civil service employees, and contractors performing under a US DoD contract) to fly as 
passengers or aircrew on foreign-owned military aircraft.  (T-0).  By following the guidance 
contained in this paragraph and its subparagraphs, commanders can ensure they remain in 
compliance with DoD guidance.  Note: On-scene commanders may authorize emergency 
combat extraction and lifesaving medical evacuation missions utilizing foreign-owned 
military aircraft without following this guidance. 
7.8.2.1.  Compliance requires the geographic AFFOR in which the foreign nation is 
located pursue either (1) a Military Airworthiness Authority System Assessment 
conducted by the National Airworthiness Council or (2) an Operational Airworthiness 
Appraisal (OAA) with risk acceptance endorsed by a general/flag officer (GO/FO) or 
Senior Executive Service (SES) civilian in the operational, supervisory, or command 
chain of the AFFOR in which the foreign nation is located (e.g., USAFE A3/5). 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
35 
7.8.2.1.1.  Recognition is established upon completion of a positive recognition 
assessment confirming the Airworthiness Assurance System, operated by the foreign 
Airworthiness Authority, ensures a sufficient level of safety for the aircraft under its 
purview.  Commands can determine if a recognition certificate already exists for the 
foreign nation under review by contacting the USAF Airworthiness Office 
(usaf.airworthiness.office@us.af.mil or 937-255-5802).  Recognition typically 
requires 120-180 days to complete once funding is obtained and the foreign 
Airworthiness Authority agrees to participate.  Recognition is valid for up to 4 years 
and is the preferred course of action to establish compliance with DoDD 5030.61.  
However, mission schedule constraints, economics (e.g., non-recurring and/or 
infrequent missions), and other circumstances (e.g., no identifiable or uncooperative 
foreign Airworthiness Authority) may make it impossible to pursue recognition.  
Commands may pursue recognition through the USAF Airworthiness Office.  If this 
is not feasible or advisable for the USAF Airworthiness Office, commands may 
pursue an OAA. 
7.8.2.1.2.  OAA endorsement is a four-step process that assesses the airworthiness-
related operational risk for a specific aircraft type and mission set (e.g., India C-130J, 
night vision device training). 
7.8.2.1.2.1.  The geographic AFFOR in which the foreign nation is located shall 
notify the USAF Airworthiness office with their intention to complete an OAA.  
The notification shall identify nationality, aircraft type(s), scope of operations 
(passenger movement, aircrew operations, parachuting operations, etc.) and date 
of the mission.  (T-2).  This will provide the USAF Airworthiness Office an 
opportunity to inform the notifying command of recognition assessments in work, 
updated instructions, or other pertinent history. 
7.8.2.1.2.2.  The geographic AFFOR in which the foreign nation is located must 
source a team to conduct the OAA.  OAAs are accomplished in person, by at least 
one rated officer and one 7-level aircraft maintainer at the home or deployed 
station of the foreign-owned aircraft.  Note: Foreign aircraft in a “TDY” status 
without full logistical support are not considered deployed.  OAA teams must 
fully comprehend the appraisal checklist provided by the USAF Airworthiness 
Office.  OAA team members should be formally trained on, or have extensive 
experience with, aviation operations and maintenance practices.  Example 
appraisal areas include technician and/or operator training and certification, 
maintenance practices, recordkeeping, and flight operations policies and 
procedures.  An OAA should require only a few days to complete once access to 
the foreign aircraft operating unit is gained. 
7.8.2.1.2.3.  The results of the OAA must be endorsed in writing by a GO/FO/SES 
in the operational, supervisory, or command chain (e.g., USAFE A3/5) of the 
geographic AFFOR (or CCMD) in which the foreign nation is located.  (T-1).  
The endorsement memo shall assess the airworthiness-related operational risk of 
the specific mission(s) it supports and include a duration (e.g., single sortie, 
multiple sorties, calendar period, etc.).  (T-1). 
 
 
36 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
7.8.2.1.2.4.  The airworthiness risk for the mission is accepted by the appropriate 
authority consistent with existing Air Force approval processes for flight on 
foreign-owned military aircraft.  The completed OAA checklist and endorsement 
memo shall be incorporated in the decision-making process.  (T-1). 
7.8.2.2.  Geographic AFFORs should maintain all OAA documentation until considered 
obsolete.  A previously completed OAA checklist may be used to inform risk acceptance 
decisions for a future mission if validated as current and applicable to the future mission.  
Note: Neither SAF/IA or the USAF Airworthiness Office are responsible for tracking 
and/or maintaining OAA documentation. 
7.8.2.3.  SC education and training (SCET) team requests.  SAF/IA will not approve or 
forward SCET requests (DD Form 2964, Security Cooperation Education and Training 
(SCET) Team Request) requiring flight by USAF personnel on foreign-owned military 
aircraft to AFSAT for sourcing unless Military Airworthiness Authority System 
Assessment exists or an OAA is completed or scheduled to be completed.  Completion or 
scheduled dates and points of contact must be included with all applicable SCET 
requests.  (T-1). 
7.8.2.4.  If an OAA checklist cannot be executed due to insufficient time or non-
cooperation of the foreign operating unit on whose aircraft flight is to occur, a 
documented risk acceptance decision by the GO/FO/SES responsible for the DoD 
personnel flying as passengers or aircrew on the aircraft is required.  This risk acceptance 
decision (i.e., accepting risk without the aid of a completed OAA checklist) must be 
transmitted to the USAF Airworthiness Office. 
7.8.3.  Operational Guidance for Aircrew Activity with Partner Nations.  The general 
provisions of AFI 11-series regulations are not authoritative over partner nation owned and 
operated aircraft.  When specific AFI guidance directly refers to operations in non-USAF 
owned aircraft that guidance must be adhered to.  (T-1).  To the maximum extent possible, 
Air Advisor aircrew operating on partner nation aircraft will use AFI 11-series regulations as 
a guide to safe and effective operations.  (T-3). 
7.9.  After Action and Lessons Learned Reporting and Implementation. 
7.9.1.  The effectiveness of individual air advising operations and the overall country and 
theater-wide plans are measured and documented on a continual basis with evaluations at 
multiple levels within the air advising realm.  It is necessary for Air Advisors to document 
observations and lessons learned to support the cyclical nature of air advising: planning, 
execution, and measuring effectiveness.  All air advising operations conclude with an event 
AAR as defined specifically by the AFFOR or TSOC staff.  The report articulates the degree 
to which the objectives were satisfied.  Data  collection  associated  with  the  MOPs  and  
MOEs  provide  support  for the report findings.  AARs shall include a narrative summary of 
observations, lessons learned, and recommendations.  (T-2). 
7.9.1.1.  Mission commanders or team leads will forward an AAR to the tasking 
organization.  (T-2).  The report should be submitted within 14 days. 
 
 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
37 
7.9.1.2.  The AAR articulates the degree to which the event objectives were satisfied in 
reference to specified MOEs and MOPs.

ASSESSMENT 
8.1.  General.  Assessment is a critical component to ensuring air advising operations are 
effective and contribute to the achievement of campaign plan objectives.  The primary purpose 
of assessment is to enhance the commander’s decision making ability and increase the 
effectiveness of operations and plans.  Assessment is a key component of the commander’s 
decision cycle, helping to determine the results of actions in the context of overall mission 
objectives and providing potential recommendations for the refinement of future plans.  
Assessment is continuous; it precedes and guides every planning or operations execution activity 
and follows each operation or phase of an operation. 
8.2.  Types of Assessment.  As is relates to the Air Advisor, there are three categories of 
assessment discussed below. 
8.2.1.  Baseline Assessment.  This is a limited scope, short duration assessment of the partner 
nation’s air force that must remain focused at the operational and/or strategic level to provide 
a snapshot of current capability, capacity and absorptive capacity.  The primary goal of this 
assessment is to provide a high-level understanding to support the establishment of desired 
partner roles and/or country-level military objectives to inform country plan development.  
Experience has shown the use of a Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leader 
Development and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy, Political, Military, Economic, 
Social, Information, and Infrastructure, or a similar construct provides an effective 
framework for this assessment.  In most cases, this assessment is only necessary when 
beginning or renewing a US relationship with a partner nation. 
8.2.2.  Operational Assessments.  Operational assessments determine progress toward closing 
the gap between the initial state (baseline) and the objective.  This assessment is necessary at 
every level where a plan exists to achieve a desired capability or capacity.  The operational 
assessment framework is built into the plan itself, requiring the establishment of SMART 
objectives, effects, and tasks.  MOPs support task accomplishment.  MOEs support effects 
accomplishment.  MOEs and MOPs provide the commander and Air Advisor with evidence 
and clues related to the progress toward closing the gap between the initial state and 
objective.  Operational assessments inform the refinement of future plans. 
8.2.3.  Tactical Assessments.  These assessments are conducted within specific organizations 
of the partner nation air force and determine abilities to conduct assigned tasks.  These 
assessments are used to develop partner nation engagement plans, MOEs, and MOPs for 
meeting desired end states.  This assessment informs event or training/capacity plan 
development at the tactical level.  This is a more detailed baseline assessment and will 
require contact with partner nation personnel and on-site visits.  The support and concurrence 
of the partner nation is critical since a baseline assessment is not possible without the 
partner’s acceptance and buy-in to the US military objective.  The assessment framework to 
be used is unique to the objective.  The results and insights of this assessment may require 
changes to the military objective. 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
39 
8.3.  Assessment Guidance. 
8.3.1.  The air advising team will accomplish an operational assessment for each event and 
will take into account CCMD and component assessment, monitoring, and evaluation 
processes.  (T-2).  Mission commanders or team leads will communicate the assessment as 
part of the AAR to the TSOC/AFFOR staff.  (T-2). 
8.3.1.1.  The AAR articulates the degree to which the event objectives were satisfied.  
Many people use a three-point scale to represent this:  green, yellow, and red. 
8.3.1.2.  Data collection associated with the MOEs/MOPs provides support for the report 
findings. 
8.3.2.  Assessment should be built into the plan from the outset and not engineered as an 
afterthought when execution is complete. 
8.3.3.  Assessments must be appropriately scoped, emphasizing operational assessment as the 
key activity that informs commander decision making. 
8.3.4.  The assessment approach should be documented in an annex to the event, 
training/capacity, or country plan.  Air Advisors should consider rehearsing the methods of 
data collection to be used during event execution. 
8.3.5.  The AAR documents the assessment, but it is not the assessment itself and it is not the 
assessment framework. 
8.3.6.  Operational assessments cannot provide absolute proof that an objective has or has not 
been achieved.  The intent is to provide the commander the most compelling information 
possible, to inform his/her decision making and future action.

Air Advising—A category of related activities that provides the basic operational methods used 
by USAF personnel to work with partner nations to develop, sustain, and employ their aviation 
enterprise to meet their national security needs, in support of US interests. 
Air Advising Operations—SC efforts focused on improving/enhancing a partner nation aviation 
capability/capacity in support of combatant commander/COMAFFOR/TSOC objectives across 
the range of military operations. 
44 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
Air Advisor—An Airman specially trained and educated to apply aviation support and 
operational expertise to assess, train, advise, assist, and equip partner nations in the development, 
sustainment, and employment of their aviation enterprise to meet their national security needs, in 
support of US interests.  This includes both Conventional and Special Operations Force 
personnel. 
Air Force Corporate Structure—The corporate review process for Headquarters U.S. Air 
Force.  Membership consists of civilian and military personnel assigned to the Air Staff or 
Secretariat, Core Function Lead representatives, and the MAJCOMs and provides the forum for 
considering and deciding Air Force resource allocation issues. 
Assessment—1.  A continuous process that measures the overall effectiveness of employing 
joint force capabilities during military operations.  2.  Determination of the progress toward 
accomplishing a task, creating a condition, or achieving an objective.  (Department of Defense 
Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms). 
Aviation Enterprise Development—The plans, programs, and activities undertaken to develop 
the system of systems necessary for a nation to optimize employment of national aviation 
resources.  The total aviation resource capacity and capability of a nation is defined by the sum 
total of all air domain resources including humans, aircraft, processes and infrastructure in both 
the civilian and military/security sectors.  Modern standards that function to provide efficient, 
safe and effective employment of national aviation resources calls for infrastructure development 
that considers the civilian aviation sector and the military/security aviation sector of a nation as 
mutually supportive systems of an integrated air domain in developing nations. 
Building Partnerships—The ability to set the conditions for interaction with partner, 
competitor, or adversary leaders, military forces, or relevant populations by developing and 
presenting information and conducting activities to affect their perceptions, will, behavior, and 
capabilities. 
Building Partner Capacity—Assisting domestic and/or foreign partners and institutions with 
the development of their capabilities and capacities—for mutual benefit—to address US national 
or shared global security interests.  An outcome of Security Force Assistance activities, it is the 
development of capabilities and capacities among foreign partners for the mutual benefit of the 
partner and US national or shared global security interests.  This definition is derived from the 
Tier III JCA of “building the capabilities and capacities of partners and institutions”, but is not 
defined in Joint Publications or other DoD Issuances.  (DoD Security Force Assistance Lexicon 
Framework). 
C—MAJCOM—The C-MAJCOM is the Air Force component to specific Unified Combatant 
Commands and presents its forces to the combatant commander through one or more C-NAFs.  
The C-MAJCOM is commanded by the Commander of Air Force forces (COMAFFOR) and 
includes the supporting staff (C-MAJCOM staff), one or more C-NAFs (with an AOC [or 
applicable operations center] and AFFOR staff) and all assigned and attached forces.  The C- 
MAJCOM staff supports the Air Force component commander at the strategic level in 
developing policy, formulating strategic level guidance, conducting administrative management 
functions, and executing (through the C-NAF where applicable) CCDR Title 10 responsibilities 
to organize and train assigned and attached forces to accomplish CCDR-assigned missions (10 
U.S.C. § 164(c), Commanders of Combatant Commands). 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
45 
C—NAF—The C-NAF is the Air Force component to specific combatant commands, and 
supports the C-MAJCOM as part of the Air Force component to other specific combatant 
commands.  When the C-NAF is part of the C-MAJCOM, the C-NAF, with its AOC and AFFOR 
staff, is the primary operational level headquarters element designed to support the Air Force 
component commander at the operational and tactical level through the full range of military 
operations and across all phases of conflict.  The C-NAF commander will be prepared to provide 
command and control of those forces in contingency operations as a COMAFFOR, JFACC 
and/or JTF/CC as required.  When the C-NAF is the component to the unified combatant 
command, the C-NAF commander is the COMAFFOR, and provides all component support 
across the full range of military operations and at the strategic, operational and tactical levels as 
described above for the C-MAJCOM and C-NAF. 
Campaign Plan—Global campaign plans and theater campaign plans (TCPs) are the centerpiece 
of the planning construct and operationalize Combatant Command (CCMD) theater or functional 
strategies.  Campaign plans should focus on the command’s steady-state activities, which include 
ongoing operations, military engagement, security cooperation, deterrence, and other shaping or 
preventive activities.  Campaign plans provide the vehicle for linking steady-state shaping 
activities to the attainment of strategic and military end states.  (JP 5-0) 
Campaign Support Plan—An annual plan at the national-strategic level, summarizing steady-
state operations in support of CCDR functional and theater campaign plans and USAF- specific 
shaping activities that directly contribute to US and USAF interests. 
Certification—A formal indication of an individual’s ability to perform a task to required 
standards. 
COMAFFOR Country Plan—A SC plan at the operational level that aligns with the CCDR’s 
country plan and nests under the COMAFFOR CSP. 
COMAFFOR Strategy—COMAFFOR theater and functional strategies outline the 
commander’s long-term vision for the USAF component to the CCMD. 
Combat Aviation Advisor (CAA)—Personnel specifically organized to assess, train, advise and 
assist foreign aviation forces in the employment and sustainment of their own assets in both 
peace, war and, when necessary, integrate those assets into joint, multi-national operations.  A 
principal objective of CAA advisory operations is to facilitate the availability, reliability, safety, 
and interoperability of partner nation or participating nation aviation resources to support 
combined Special Operations Forces. 
Designated Air Advisor Forces/Units—Those forces and/or units that perform air advising, as 
designed by their operational capability statements and mission essential tasks.  Designated Air 
Advisor forces/units have readiness requirements for personnel, training, and equipment, if 
applicable, and report those requirements in status of resources and training system and defense 
readiness reporting system.  Personnel assigned to the air advising mission in designated 
forces/units are required to accomplish Air Advisor education and training at the Advanced or 
Basic level prior to reporting ready for the Air Advisor mission.  Advanced or Basic levels are 
described in AFI 10-4301V1. 
 
 
46 
AFI10-4301V3  14 DECEMBER 2020 
Expeditionary Air Advisor Forces—Those individuals, teams, or units, who are not aligned 
with air advising designed operational capability statements or mission essential tasks.  
Consequently, expeditionary Air Advisor forces have no specific readiness requirements for 
personnel, training, and equipment and do not report such requirements in status of resources and 
training system and defense readiness reporting system.  Expeditionary Air Advisor forces are 
required to accomplish Air Advisor education and training at the Advanced or Basic level to 
serve in an expeditionary Air Advisor capacity.  Advanced or Basic levels are described in AFI 
10- 4201V1. 
Extended Training Service Specialists (ETSS)—ETSS are permanent change of station teams 
that are technically qualified to provide advice, instruction, and training in the installation, 
operation, and maintenance of weapons, equipment, and systems.  The ETSS deploy under one 
of the security assistance authorities in Title 22.  They are not used for follow-on retraining or 
advisory roles, except in rare instances when the recipient country cannot provide qualified 
personnel from its own resources or hire qualified personnel from non-indigenous sources and 
the SC organization recommends it as in the interest of the United States. 
Foreign Internal Defense—Participation by civilian and military agencies of a government in 
any of the action programs taken by another government or other designated organization to free 
and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, insurgency, terrorism, and other threats to 
its security.  (JP 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense) 
Foreign Military Financing (FMF)—Foreign Military Financing (FMF) is a critical foreign 
policy tool for promoting US interests around the world by ensuring that coalition partners and 
friendly foreign governments are equipped and trained to work toward common security goals 
and share burdens in joint missions.  FMF provides grants for the acquisition of US defense 
equipment, services and training, which promotes US national security by contributing to 
regional and global stability, strengthening military support for democratically-elected 
governments, and containing transnational threats including terrorism and trafficking in 
narcotics, weapons, and persons. 
Foreign Military Sales (FMS)—That portion of United States security assistance for sales 
programs that require agreements/contracts between the United States Government and an 
authorized recipient government or international organization for defense articles and services to 
be provided to the recipient for current stocks or new procurements under Department of 
Defense-managed contracts, regardless of the source of financing.  (JP 3-20) 
Functional Area Manager (FAM)—The individual accountable for the management and 
oversight of all personnel and equipment within a specific functional area to support operational 
planning and execution.  Responsibilities may include developing and reviewing policy; 
developing, managing, and maintaining unit type codes; developing criteria for and monitoring 
readiness reporting; force posturing, analysis, and execution activities which are crucial to the 
management and execution of Air Force readiness programs.  (AFI 10-401)

Federal funds.  (b) The term does not normally include—(1) gathering information for or 
providing advice, opinions, recommendations, or ideas to Federal Government officials; or (2) 
any function that is primarily ministerial and internal in nature (such as building security, mail 
operations, operation of cafeterias, housekeeping, facilities operations and maintenance, 
warehouse operations, motor vehicle fleet management operations, or other routine electrical or 
mechanical services). 
Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment—The analytical process used by 
intelligence organizations to produce intelligence estimates and other intelligence products in 
support of the joint force commander's decision—making process (Department of Defense 
Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms).  It is a continuous process that includes defining 
the operational environment; describing the impact of the operational environment; evaluating 
the adversary; and determining adversary courses of action.

the security assistance authorities in Title 22 or one of the Title 10 authorized programs that 
follow SC procedures. 
Request for Forces (RFF)—In those instances in which assigned or allocated forces are not 
available within the theater or are not adequate to accomplish the air advising requirement, the 
activity planner may initiate an RFF using guidance provided in the Global Force Management 
Implementation Guidance and CJCSM 3130.06B, Global Force Management Allocation Policies 
and Procedures.  As an example, SOF CAA forces are normally requested using the RFF 
process.  Note:  RFFs must be submitted IAW Joint Staff established timelines to ensure ability 
to meet requested dates.  In the event dates change due to country clearance issues, Joint Staff, 
Joint Force Provider, and CCDR coordination is required. 
Security Assistance (SA)—Group of programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended; the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended; or other related statutes by

SECURITY COOPERATION AUTHORITIES 
A2.1.  Security Cooperation Authorities.  Authorities available to conduct air advising 
operations are listed below: 
A2.2.  Title 10 – DoD.  Title 10, U.S.C. §§ 301-386, contains specific DoD authorities for 
conducting military-to-military engagements, training with foreign forces, support for operations 
and capacity building and education and training activities.  These authorities are discussed in 
greater detail below.  Authorities for conducting international armaments cooperation are found 
elsewhere in Title 10, U.S.C. 
A2.2.1.  Military-to-Military Engagements (10 USC §§ 311-313).  SecDef is authorized to 
enter into international agreements for the exchange of US defense personnel and foreign 
personnel.  Under this authority, exchanges may be conducted on a reciprocal or non-
reciprocal basis; US personnel may include military or civilian personnel.  Exchanges may be 
conducted with personnel of foreign defense ministries or, with the concurrence of Secretary 
of State (SecState), foreign non-defense security ministries or international or regional 
security organizations.  SecDef may pay certain personnel expenses of foreign personnel as 
necessary for theater SC.  Eligible expenses include travel, subsistence, and similar personnel 
expenses, administrative services, and support for foreign liaison officers who are assigned. 
A2.2.2.  Training with Foreign Forces (10 USC §§ 321-322).  The US Armed Forces are 
authorized to train with military forces or other security forces of a foreign friendly country 
in cases where SecDef determines it is in the national security interests of the US.  Under this 
authority, the US Armed Forces may conduct training with, or bilateral or multilateral 
exercises with, counterpart friendly foreign forces.  US Armed Forces may pay the 
incremental expenses of a friendly foreign country (limited to developing countries except 
under exceptional circumstances) to participate in such training.  Authorized expenses 
include the travel, subsistence, and other personnel expenses of the developing country’s 
defense personnel.  The primary purpose of the training and exercises for which payment 
may be made shall be to train the US forces.  Combined training and exercises may be 
conducted with nonmilitary security forces only by specialized forces of the US Armed 
Forces; US CF may only train with the military forces of a friendly foreign country. 
A2.2.3.  Support for Operations and Capacity Building (10 USC §§ 331-333). 
A2.2.3.1.  Support for Operations (10 USC § 331).  SecDef, with the concurrence of 
SecState, may provide support to friendly foreign countries in the context of specifically 
designated operations.  Such support may include logistics support, supplies, and 
services; procurement of equipment for the purposes of loaning such equipment to 
enhance capabilities and interoperability; provision of specialized training; and small-

supplies, and services may be provided to nonmilitary forces who are participating in a 
combined operation with US forces or in a military operation or stability activity that 
benefits the US.  For operations in which the US is not participating, SecDef and 
SecState must jointly certify to Congress that the operation is in the national security 
interests of the US prior to the provision of assistance under this authority. 
A2.2.3.2.  Defense Institution Capacity Building (10 USC § 332).  SecDef, with the 
concurrence of SecState, may provide programs for training and training support 
programs and may assign DoD civilian employees as advisors to the ministries of defense 
(or security agencies serving a similar defense function) to provide institutional, 
ministerial-level advice, and other training in support of stabilization or post conflict 
activities or assist in building core institutional capacity, competencies, and capabilities 
to manage defense-related processes.  Programs should enhance civilian oversight; 
establish responsible defense governance; assess and establish a roadmap to address 
shortfalls; and enhance overall ministerial, general, or joint staff or service-level core 
management competencies. 
A2.2.3.3.  Building Capacities (10 USC § 333).  SecDef, with the concurrence of 
SecState, is authorized to build the capacity of a foreign country’s national security forces 
to conduct counterterrorism operations, counter weapons of mass destruction operations, 
counterdrug trafficking operations, counter transnational organized crime operations, 
maritime and border security operations, military intelligence operations, and other 
operations or activities that contribute to multinational operations that benefit the national 
security interests of the US.  Programs may include the provision of equipment, supplies, 
training, defense services, and small-scale military construction.  Sustainment support 
may be provided for a period extending up to 5 years after the provision of equipment 
under the authority.  Any assistance provided under this authority must be accompanied 
by parallel assistance programs aimed to address institutional capacity-building and 
respect for the law of armed conflict, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of 
law, and civilian control of the military.  Assistance will generally be provided to foreign 
military forces, but may be provided to other security forces under certain circumstances. 
A2.2.4.  Department of Defense State Partnership Program.  (10 USC § 341).  SecDef, with 
the concurrence of SecState, is authorized to establish a program of activities, known as a 
“State Partnership” and described to support the achievement of US SC objectives, between 
members of the National Guard of a state or territory and any of the following: 
A2.2.4.1.  The military forces of a foreign country. 
A2.2.4.2.  The security forces of a foreign country. 
A2.2.4.3.  Governmental organizations of a foreign country whose primary functions 
include disaster response or emergency response.

A2.3.  Title 22 – Department of State.  22 U.S.C. outlines the roles and responsibilities of the 
DoS with respect to foreign relations.  When a program is referred to as a 22 U.S.C. program, it 
means that by law, DoS maintains overall responsibility for the program, even when 
administration of portions of the program is delegated to the DoD.  US military members 
performing security assistance duties authorized by 22 U.S.C. may exercise force in self- defense 
but do not participate in offensive combat operations.  Detailed information on available 
authorities can be obtained through the OSD Partnership Strategy Toolkit; contact 
SCToolsAdministrators@osd.mil for access to the website.  However, Air Force personnel 
should seek legal advice from the appropriate Air Force legal office on available authorities and 
funding for proposed air advising operations. 
A2.4.  Contractor roles in the process.  Agencies must ensure that inherently governmental 
functions are reserved exclusively for performance by Federal employees (military or civilian).  
Although contractors provide important support to the agency, they may not be motivated solely 
by the public interest, and may be beyond the reach of management controls applicable to 
Federal employees.  Agencies must further ensure that a sufficient number of Federal employees 
are dedicated to the performance and/or management of critical functions so that Federal 
employees can provide for the accomplishment of, and maintain control over, their mission and 
operations.  Proper identification of inherently governmental and critical functions is the first 
step for meeting these requirements.
