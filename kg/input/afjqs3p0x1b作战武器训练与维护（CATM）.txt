AIR FORCE JOB QUALIFICATION STANDARD (AFJQS)  
COMBAT ARMS TRAINING AND MAINTENANCE (CATM) 
(3P0X1B) 
 
ACCESSIBILITY: Publications and forms are available on the e-Publishing website at www.e-
Publishing.af.mil for downloading or ordering. 
 
RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication. 
 
 
1. PURPOSE. As directed by DAFMAN 31-131v1, this AFJQS identifies the training requirements for 
CATM instructors to achieve job qualification within the 3, 5 and 7 skill level of the B shred for Air Force 
specialty code (AFSC 3P0X1). This AFJQS must be utilized by all CATM personnel for job qualification. 
This AFJQS applies to all personnel with the career Air Force specialty code (CAFSC) 3P0X1B and DoD 
Civilians performing the CATM function. This AFJQS will remain in effect until superseded or rescinded. 
 
2. TASK QUALIFICATION. Personnel will be qualified to the GO/NO GO standard on this AFJQS. 
GO means the individual can perform the task without assistance utilizing appropriate instructions or other 
procedural guidance. All training listed in Part II of this AFJQS is provided through on the job training 
(OJT), utilizing lesson plans and task performance checklists developed by AFSFC/S3TC and located on 
the SmartNet. In all cases, the CATM Trainer will complete the trainer’s block to document training 
completion. AFJQS items marked with an “*” are considered critical and must be certified by a third party 
(the CATM Section Chief or higher authority). All training listed in Part II of this AFJQS is separated by 
skill level. CATM personnel may only be task qualified/certified on items within the skill level they 
currently hold. However, training listed in Part II of this AFJQS is not tied to skill level upgrade. To upgrade 
skill levels, the CATM instructor must attend formal training as outlined in the CATM career field 
education and training plan (CFETP). CATM Instructors are only required to conduct task qualification on 
duties for which they conduct. For example: if an instructor is assigned to a duty location that does not train 
on the Mk19, the instructor is not required to be trained/certified on the Mk19 solely because they are 3 
level. If the instructor becomes reassigned to a unit that trains on a Mk19 and has achieved their 5 level, 
they may conduct task qualification/certification on the Mk19 even though it is a 3-level task, and they are 
a 5 level. Training can always move down in skill level, but never up.  
 
3. TRAINING DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINER/CERTIFIER IDENTIFICATION. 
Document training required by this AFJQS in accordance with DAFMAN 36-2689, Training Program, and 
any automated learning management system (LMS) procedural guides. Military and civilian personnel will 
both utilize the Air Force approved LMS unless it is unavailable. In those instances, military and civilian 
personnel will utilize a paper copy record of this AFJQS and retain it in their On-the-Job training record for 
military and in the Supervisor’s Employee Brief for civilian personnel. Per DAFMAN 36-2689, paragraph 
5.2.11, core tasks in this AFJQS are defined as those tasks requiring third party certification. If a military 
or civilian trainee is assigned an additional duty or task not included in an individual’s CFETP or this 
AFJQS, the supervisor will add the task(s) to the Master Training Plan (MTP) and Individual Training Plan 
(ITP). 
  
4. ADDITIONAL DUTY or TASK. If a CATM instructor is assigned an additional duty or task not 
listed in this AFJQS, the Instructor Supervisor will develop an AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard 
Continuation/Command JQS. The Instructor Supervisor, CATM Trainer or, Section Chief will then 
2 
 
develop a plan for the member to receive training and certification to become duty position or task 
qualified. 
 
5. ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION/TASK QUALIFICATION. CATM Instructors, Trainers and 
Section Chiefs will follow the guidance in DAFI 31-131 and Department of the Air Force Manual 
(DAFMAN) 31-131 V1 for annual evaluations on instruction and weapons maintenance. CATM 
Instructors are not required to conduct routine annual recertification/task qualification on any other line 
items in this AFJQS unless required by the Section Chief for remedial training or other annual reviews. 
 
6. This AFJQS has been coordinated with all applicable Career Field Managers (CFM) and Major 
Command Functional Managers (MFM). The overall point of contact (POC) for this AFJQS is AFSFC/S3TC 
AFSFC.S3T.CATM@us.af.mil.
