SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This manual has been substantially revised, and needs to be completely reviewed. A significant 
amount of procedural information has been removed and incorporated in other publications. New 
guidance includes: environmental considerations; roped rescue, extrication, confined 
space/structural collapse, snow/ice/avalanche operations; updates for new aircraft and 
equipment; tandem parachuting calculations and procedures; equipment maintenance and 
inspection and the inclusion of a local procedures chapter.

GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1.  Purpose.  This manual outlines standard operating procedures for PJ and CRO operations 
during Personnel Recovery and/or sensitive item recovery operations, and in support of Global 
Access and Precision Strike operations when applicable. 
1.2.  Applicability.  This manual applies to operators (i.e., PJs, CROs and other attached Special 
Warfare Airmen), support personnel, and their managers across the full range of military 
operations. This manual prescribes guidance for PJ and CRO operations under most 
circumstances, but is not a substitute for sound judgment or common sense. Operations or 
procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective 
mission accomplishment. 
1.3.  Key Words Explained. 
1.3.1.  "Will", "Must" and "Shall" indicate a mandatory requirement. 
1.3.2.  "Should" indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment. 
1.3.3.  "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 
1.3.4.  "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to 
emphasize. 
1.3.5.  “CAUTION” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in 
damage to equipment if not carefully followed. 
1.3.6.  “WARNING” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in 
personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed. 
1.3.7.  See Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information, for additional 
terms. 
1.4.  Deviations.  Do not deviate from the instruction and procedural guidance in this manual 
except when the situation demands immediate action to ensure safety (specifically, the protect 
against death or serious bodily injury) or an urgent requirement exists; any deviation must be 
approved by the appropriate Tier waiver authority. In this case, the Team Commander, or Team 
Leader in their absence, will evaluate all options and take the appropriate action to ensure the 
safety of those under their control. 
1.4.1.  Units will report all deviations without an approved waiver to the appropriate waiver 
authority (with the Lead MAJCOM OPR and AF/A3S as informational addressees) within 24 
hours or when tactically/operationally feasible. (T-1). 
1.4.2.  When it is necessary to protect those under their control from a situation not covered 
by this manual and immediate action is required, the Team Commander has ultimate 
authority and responsibility for the course of action to be taken.

1.5.  Conflicting Supplement Procedures.  This manual is a basic directive and will be the 
default if there are conflicts between supplements. 
1.5.1.  Combined command operations. Plan and conduct all operations that include forces 
from multiple MAJCOMs using provisions in this manual. Do not assume or expect 
personnel to perform MAJCOM/Theater unique procedures without MAJCOM/A3 approval 
and advance training. 
1.5.2.  Though a unit’s entries in Chapter 19 are not a supplement, conflicts between units 
during combined ops will default to the lowest common derivative of this manual. 
1.6.  Development of New Equipment and Procedures.  Units must obtain MAJCOM approval 
prior to testing new equipment or procedures that would require an update to current guidance. 
(T-1). Units are encouraged to suggest new equipment, methods, tactics and procedures. Test 
suggestions are made via squadron and wing weapons officers through command channels to the 
lead MAJCOM Weapons and Tactics Branch in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 
11-260, Tactics Development Program using AF Form 4326, Tactic Improvement Proposal for 
tactics and procedures and in accordance with AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle 
Management using AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal for equipment. 
1.7.  Operational Reports.  The reporting requirements in this manual are exempt from 
licensing in accordance with AFI 33-324, The Air Force Information Collections and Reports 
Management Program.

Chapter 3 
COMMAND AND CONTROL 
3.1.  General.  Personnel recovery (PR) operations are dynamic, complex and time sensitive 
with operational and strategic importance. Geographical Combatant Commanders define theater 
PR Command and Control (C2) for subordinate commanders’ implementation. Because of these 
relationships, PR C2 authorities and responsibilities vary and may not be the same for each 
theater. 
3.2.  Command Authorities: 
3.2.1.  Operational control (OPCON). Service component commanders normally retain 
OPCON over their assigned and attached Service forces in accordance with JP 3-30, Joint 
Air Operations. Commanders at all levels assess combatant command OPCON authorities 
and ensure unit coordination procedures and concepts are established accordingly. 
3.2.2.  Tactical control (TACON). TACON is command authority over assigned, attached or 
augmenting forces/military capabilities for a mission tasking. TACON is limited to the 
detailed and, usually, local direction and control of movements or maneuvers necessary to 
accomplish missions or tasks assigned. Tactical control can be transferred to another 
component or commander and delegated. Commanders will verify TACON authority prior to 
executing an operation and ensure supported air and ground commanders understand C2 
relationships. (T-2). 
3.2.3.  Execute authority. Commanders with OPCON over CAF PR resources generally hold 
execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority formulate 
plans, allocate assets and approve missions through a command post or a C2 element. 
Operational group commanders usually serve as execution authority for local training 
missions. 
3.2.4.  Mission support. PJ/CROs may be tasked with collateral or secondary missions 
requiring an understanding of government agency and interagency authorities necessary to 
provide effective support: 
3.2.4.1.  Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) may require warfighting 
capabilities to aid recovery from disasters, declared emergencies, or to support designated 
law enforcement and other authorized activities in accordance with AFI 10-801, Defense 
Support of Civil Authorities. Commanders will be familiar with local installation 
procedures for planning, responding and supporting domestic emergencies, law 
enforcement support and other national security special activities. (T-3). Unit personnel 
should be familiar with the appropriate actions to prevent human suffering and the loss of 
life within the limitations of DoDD 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities

AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
3.2.4.1.1.  Within the United States (US): In accordance with DoDD 3025.18, in cases 
of extreme emergencies (e.g., in order to prevent the loss of life, prevent human 
suffering or mitigate great property loss) and when a request for assistance is made by 
civil authority, a commander may provide immediate response by temporarily 
employing the resources under their control, subject to any supplemental direction 
provided by higher headquarters. Immediate response authority does not permit 
actions that would subject civilians to the use of military power that is regulatory, 
prescriptive, proscriptive, or compulsory. 
3.2.4.1.2.  Outside the US: a commander may offer assistance to host nation civil 
authorities in accordance with Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA), Rules of 
Engagement (ROE) or both. If possible, seek command approval prior to 
commencing these operations. 
3.2.4.2.  Foreign Humanitarian Assistance (FHA)/Foreign Disaster Relief (FDR): 
Department of Defense (DoD) activities conducted outside the US and its territories to 
directly relieve or reduce human suffering, disease, hunger, or privation requires 
systematic diplomacy and coordination to achieve a desired US intent. These DoD 
activities are conducted in support of other governmental departments or agencies or as 
part of a Geographic Combatant Command security cooperation program to achieve a 
specific theater campaign objective. 
3.2.4.2.1.  The Department of State is the lead agency for developing and 
implementing US foreign policy and has lead responsibility for FHA through the 
Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. US Agency for International 
Development/Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance is the lead agency for FDR and 
may deploy a disaster relief team into a crisis area to assist with assessing, 
coordinating and reporting on a FDR. These specialists work closely with military 
units and may complement recovery efforts. 
3.2.4.2.2.  Requests for DoD support may come from a foreign national government, 
from a country team or both. The DoD should coordinate with the Chief of Mission 
and country team prior to deploying to assess restrictions and constraints such as 
SOFA, treaties or other international agreements or arrangements. PR forces may be 
tasked as part of a Joint Task Force or as an independent entity to support the country 
team. PR commanders should liaise and maintain a representing presence within JTF 
headquarter elements and if available, embed personnel in the appropriate operation 
centers. 
3.3.  Command and Control (C2) Responsibilities.  CROs and PJs will be assigned operational 
roles and responsibilities consistent with their qualifications and experience. (T-2). Depending 
on the assigned mission, the following responsibilities may be assigned: 
3.3.1.  Team Leader (TL). A PJ qualified to lead personnel in accordance with AFTTP 3-
3.GA. 
 
 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
13 
3.3.2.  Team Commander (TC). A CRO qualified to command personnel in accordance with 
AFTTP 3-3.GA. In cases when the rescue force operates on the ground with no pre-
designated ground force commanders (GFC), TCs will act as GFC and have the appropriate 
authority to accomplish assigned missions. (T-3). The GFC must approve all effects within 
the operating zone and terminal area to include weapons employment and insertion or 
extraction activities. (T-3). In cases where supporting forces are assigned to the tactical, 
maneuver unit (e.g., security teams, interpreters, or medical specialists), TCs are responsible 
for the welfare and command of the entire force. In the absence of a TC, the senior PJ 
assigned TL duties will assume GFC duties and responsibilities. (T-3). 
3.3.3.  Mission Commanders (MC). A CRO who is qualified as a TC and appointed specific 
command responsibilities based on experience, competence and commander’s trust. MCs 
have the authority to execute missions of increased size, complexity, and force integration. 
3.3.3.1.  In general, commanders should appoint a MC to lead an operation for complex 
or high-visibility operations. 
3.3.3.2.  For integrated Air Force or joint PR operations, the commander should appoint a 
CRO as MC for missions where the preponderance of operations requires the specific 
expertise resident in PJ/CROs. Often, that expertise includes command of extended 
surface operations on land and water, mass casualty operations and complex technical 
rescue operations. 
3.3.3.3.  In those cases where multiple units, platforms or capabilities are assembled into 
a task force for a specific mission with an MC in command, the MC is responsible for the 
welfare of the task force and will maintain command and control throughout the 
operation. (T-3). Once the execute authority has been granted, the MC is the delegated 
TACON command authority during an operation and will direct and monitor subordinate 
commanders’ actions and support their requirements throughout the mission. (T-3).

MISSION PLANNING 
4.1.  General.  Planning is the art and science of comprehending a situation, envisioning a 
desired end-state and laying out effective ways to bring about a conceptualized future. Planning 
involves skill, knowledge, experience and innovation to ensure success. The planning continuum 
requires continuous operational assessments to adapt to changing conditions while minimizing 
risk. 
4.2.  Planning Process.  PR requires detailed planning, coordination and a concerted effort from 
multiple personnel. Plans, or concept of operations, are developed with an operation process 
where problems are analyzed and solutions are developed. Planners should conduct a 
comprehensive analysis of potential missions to determine suitable concept of operations. 
Commanders should drive the operation process and lead others in understanding, visualizing, 
describing and assessing capabilities. Leaders should synchronize capabilities and maintain 
information flow during the operation process. 
4.2.1.  Joint Planning Process (JPP). Planners should use JPP, or a similar process (e.g., the 
Army’s Military Decision Making Process) to build base plans. According to JP 3-0, Joint 
Operations, The JPP underpins planning at all levels and for missions across the range of 
military operations. Commanders should routinely use JPP to plan, prepare, execute, assess 
and adapt their concept of operations to increase awareness and to reduce risk. 
4.2.2.  Troop-Leading Procedures (TLPs). Leaders should use TLPs when tasked with the 
responsibility of a mission. Leaders should identify the appropriate base plan, developed 
through JPP, and extract pertinent information. This starting point facilitates a leader’s ability 
to task, prioritize and allocate resources and identify necessary decision points. 
4.2.3.  Refer to AFTTP 3-3.GA for Personnel Recovery Annex planning tactics, techniques, 
and procedures (TTPs). 
4.3.  Responsibilities.  Planning and preparation is a mission wide responsibility shared by 
operators, enablers, support and service support personnel alike. The dynamic nature of PR 
requires an entire unit’s participation. Leaders maintain a high-level readiness with active 
involvement from all unit personnel. 
4.3.1.  Commander will ensure unit planning is consistent with Designed Operational 
Capability and Mission Essential Task Listing. (T-1). 
4.3.2.  Unit members will comprehend mission-planning responsibilities. (T-3).

maintain an alert posture, for a specific mission or duration. (T-3). 
4.4.2.  Personnel will adhere to local area procedures when tasked with an alert duty. (T-3). 
4.4.2.1.  Prior to assuming alert, operators must have the opportunity for at least 8 hours 
of uninterrupted sleep (operational dependent). (T-3). Commanders should use discretion 
when assuming a non-airborne alert. 
4.4.2.2.  Leaders will monitor rest cycles during alert duty periods. (T-3). 
4.4.3.  The alert period begins upon notification, or upon assumption of alert. 
4.4.3.1.  Operators will attend daily briefings during alert. (T-3). Briefings should include 
updates on mission information, safety considerations, rules of engagement, and 
information on special interest items. 
4.4.3.2.  Operators may complete initial alert activities (e.g., transportation, briefing, 
equipment preparation, communications check) without assuming alert. 
4.5.  Crew Rest and Duty Limitations. 
4.5.1.  AFMAN 11-202V3, Flight Operations, establishes crew rest as a 12-hour rest period 
with an opportunity for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. 
4.5.2.  TCs and TLs monitor mission parameters and with risk analysis, may request a waiver 
to the crew rest requirements of AFMAN 11-202V3 in order to facilitate mission 
accomplishment.

stationary and not moving. The target line is parallel to the firing line. Shooters may change 
stances and move along pre-briefed lines when commanded to do so. Examples include zeroing, 
qualification firing, shooting while moving in briefed direction and box drills. 
5.5.  Dynamic Firing Range.  A dynamic firing range is defined when a range has irregular 
obstacles, no established shooting lanes, or both. Shooters move through weapon employment 
zones while engaging targets. While target lines are clearly defined, they may be comprised of 
multiple lines. Examples include arroyo courses, urban streets with a predetermined path of 
travel, or scripted small team immediate action drills. Additional individual or team briefing 
requirements for Dynamic Ranges (local area procedures) include:

7.3.5.  Amount of safety margin available with equipment. 
7.4.  General Team Roped Rescue Requirements. 
7.4.1.  Minimize potential shock loading. 
7.4.2.  Assess and brief RM prior to loading a system without a safety line. (T-3). Proprietary 
single rope rescue systems (eg. TRACE and AR kits) are authorized with appropriate training 
and risk management. 
7.4.3.  A safety check or “whistle test” is required for all systems prior to applying a live load 
to the system. ‘Whistle test’ implies a hands free back up is in place. (T-3). 
7.4.4.  “Close” systems with a knot to prevent the end of the rope from feeding through the 
device and causing an accidental run out. (T-3). 
7.4.5.  Protect rope/webbing with edge protection when and where possible. 
7.4.6.  Evaluate need for a barrelman to negotiate obstacles. 
7.4.7.  For training, all operators within 10 feet of an edge where a fall of 10 feet or greater, 
down a slope of 50° or greater is possible, must be tied in. (T-3). 
7.4.8.  Determine load size and calculate safety factor required; a less than 10:1 safety factor 
will not be accepted without a careful RM evaluation. Freedom of the Hills contains 
techniques for these calculations for high, medium and low angle operations. 
7.4.9.  Select and construct anchors to support the intended dynamic load. (T-3). 
7.4.10.  Focus equalized anchor systems with an appropriate knot. (T-3). WARNING: Free 
running equalizing anchor systems are not authorized. WARNING: The angle between the 
outside legs of an anchor should be kept below 90°. At angles greater than 120° between 
legs, the force exerted on each anchor point exceeds the force exerted on the anchor by the 
load. This is especially important in anchors with only two legs. WARNING: When using 
gear anchors points such as “friends” or ice screws, two anchor points with a minimum of 12 
Kilonewton (kN) rating each will be placed for personal loads, four anchor points with a 
minimum of 12 kN rating each will be placed for rescue loads. (T-3). 
7.4.11.  Main line and safety line should be interconnected at the litter yoke with a tandem 
knot. 
7.4.12.  Patients will be secured to either the main or safety line through their harness. (T-2). 
NOTE: Harness may be actual climbing harness or made with available webbing or suitable 
substitute that meets the intent of securing the patient. 
7.4.13.  For training, patients will have head and eye protection to avoid injury. (T-3). 
7.4.14.  Any time a progress capture device is employed a tension release mechanism will be 
used to connect the device to the anchor (Load Releasing Hitch (LRH), tied off belay device, 
etc.). WARNING: Dynamic ropes will not be used as the main or belay line in rescue 
systems. (T-3). 
7.5.  Required Individual Equipment for Roped Rescue: 
7.5.1.  Helmet. (T-3). 
7.5.2.  Sit harness. (T-3).

7.5.9.  Radio for communication (recommended). 
7.6.  Lowering Systems Team Requirements. 
7.6.1.  General. 
7.6.1.1.  A twin line system should be used for redundancy in high angle terrain if rope 
damage is possible. 
7.6.1.2.  Personnel will be tied into the end of the rope. However, a triple-action locking 
carabineer may be used if the situation warrants and RM is assessed. (T-1). 
7.6.2.  Procedures. 
7.6.2.1.  Design/construct system to meet lowering requirements, pay close attention to 
the fall line, focal point and weight of load. (T-3). 
7.6.2.2.  Members will use an appropriate friction device for the expected loads (T-3): 
7.6.2.2.1.  Personal loads may use ATC, Gri-Gri®, Munter hitch or comparable 
device. 
7.6.2.2.2.  Rescue loads will use brake rack, Scarab®, Traverse 540°, tandem ATCs, 
Super Munter or comparable device. (T-3). 
7.6.2.3.  Use tandem Prusiks appropriately sized for the rope diameter in use as back up 
for rescue loads. (T-3). WARNING: Only use rescue load rated mechanical rope grabs 
for back up to rescue load systems. 
7.7.  Haul System and Mechanical Advantage Team Requirements. 
7.7.1.  General. 
7.7.1.1.  Always consider a separate anchor with safety line for redundancy. If system 
strength is questionable, then a separate safety system must be utilized. (T-3). 
7.7.1.2.  Every attempt must be made to make sure that the haul line and safety line are 
protected from sharp edges or any other obstacles that may cause rope abrasion. 
7.7.2.  Procedures. 
7.7.2.1.  Anchors will be built with a 10:1 safety factor for anticipated working load (load 
plus haul force, e.g., if load is determined to be 2kN, then all equipment must be rated to 
20kN or greater). (T-3). 
 
 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
37 
7.7.2.2.  A progress capture should be included between the load and the first pulley with 
a suitable anchor to handle the load (Prusik with LRH, etc.). WARNING: If at any time 
the haul team meets unexpected resistance, (e.g., litter trapped on an overhang or a rope 
pinched in a crack) cease hauling until the situation is identified and corrected. Be 
prepared to initiate a lower if hung up. 
7.8.  Suspension Traverse/High Line Team Requirements. 
7.8.1.  Only rescue load rated static kernmantle rope will be used for conducting a suspension 
traverse or high line. (T-3). (A 30kN rating should be considered the minimum standard. See 
Freedom of the Hills for an in-depth discussion on vector angles and resultant forces on ropes 
and anchors.). 
7.8.2.  Sloping suspension traverses/high lines require a belay/tagline or mechanical 
advantage and require tandem prusiks with an LRH attached in front of the brake rack or 
mechanical advantage to protect against a dynamic event. (T-3). WARNING: Traverse lines 
have extremely high forces as rope sag is eliminated. Forces on the anchors reach 
catastrophic levels as the rope angle approaches zero degrees. Each anchor must always be 
stronger than the traverse line. 
7.9.  Roped Climbing Team Requirements. 
7.9.1.  Aid climbing techniques are recommended for roped rescue/recovery. 
7.9.2.  Roped climbing will be used whenever there is an immediate or obvious danger of a 
catastrophic fall. (T-3). 
7.9.3.  Individuals will establish protection so that a fall will not exceed 10 feet, to include 
rope ascensions. (T-3). 
7.9.4.  Climber must be belayed. (T-3). 
7.9.5.  Base anchors and system selection on potential fall forces. 
7.9.6.  A dynamic style rope should be used when a fall from above the highest anchor is 
possible. Dynamic ropes bear the Union Internationale des Associations d’Alpinisme (UIAA) 
symbol for single or double rope use. Ropes must be rated for single use to be utilized in a 
single rope system. (T-3). 
7.10.  Rappelling Requirements.  (See Chapter 14 for Rappelling from Helicopter 
requirements). 
7.10.1.  General. Helmets and gloves will be worn on all rappels. (T-3). 
7.10.2.  Procedures. 
7.10.2.1.  Construct anchor oriented to load and attach rope. 
7.10.2.2.  Ensure rope has sufficient length to access the objective and tie a knot in the 
end to prevent accidental run out. 
7.10.2.3.  Use edge pro anywhere the rope may abrade. 
7.10.2.4.  Rappeller will connect harness to rope with weight appropriate friction device. 
(T-3). WARNING: Rappeller should use hands-free back up. If the hands-free back up 
will hinder operations, the TL will apply RM to determine use.

CONFINED SPACE/STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE OPERATIONS 
9.1.  General.  Consider all confined space/structural collapse (CS/SC) operations as hazardous 
and use appropriate caution when planning and approaching. CS/SC operations are conducted in 
accordance with Freedom of the Hills, AFTTP 3-3.GA and this manual. AFMAN 91-203, Air 
Force Occupational Safety, Fire, and Health Standards may be used for reference. 
9.2.  CS/SC Defined. 
9.2.1.  Confined space is defined by three criteria: 
9.2.1.1.  Space is big enough to bodily enter. 
9.2.1.2.  Space is not meant for continuous human occupancy. 
9.2.1.3.  Space has limited means of entry and escape. 
9.2.2.  Structural collapse is defined as any structure that has received damage to its 
infrastructure making it unsuitable for occupancy. 
9.3.  CS/SC Responsibilities.

9.3.1.2.  Brief all equipment and PPE requirements. 
9.3.1.3.  Ensure safety of all personnel in operation. 
9.3.1.4.  When dealing with a structural collapse, safe zones and CCPs should be 
established away from the collapsed structure a distance of 1.5 times the height of the 
structure. 
9.3.1.5.  Consider assigning a knowledgeable/capable entrant as entry element lead. The 
TC/TL then delegates the following to the entry element lead: 
9.3.1.5.1.  Oversee operations in space.

tactical threat level. 
9.6.2.  Assess atmospheric hazards. Atmospheric monitors will be turned on/calibrated in 
fresh air. (T-3). Intelligence driven atmospheric hazards should be confirmed and verify the 
following: 
9.6.2.1.  Normal oxygen concentration limits are between 19.5% and 23.5% (If below, 
supplemental oxygen is required. If above, there is an increase in explosive potential). 
42 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
9.6.2.2.  Lower explosive limit (LEL) is <10%. 
9.6.2.3.  Airborne combustible dust: There should be five feet of visibility at all times, 
use appropriate RM measures in less than five feet of dust visibility. 
9.6.2.4.  Carbon Monoxide (CO) <35ppm (self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) 
required for >35ppm.). 
9.6.2.5.  Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) <10ppm. 
9.6.2.6.  Other contaminants. Use SDS or other intelligence sources for proper mitigation 
(e.g., cyanide, ammonia, aromatic hydrocarbons). 
9.6.2.7.  Respiratory protection. Unless all the above conditions are met, respiratory 
protection is required. (T-3). Based on the threat, determine if passive or active protection 
is warranted. 
9.6.2.7.1.  Passive: Air purifying respirator/CBRNE Mask. 
9.6.2.7.2.  Active: Supplied air SCBA. Note: If the atmosphere contains any hazard 
that requires the use of the SCBA mode of a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) 
equipped system, turning the PAPR system on will introduce the hazard into the 
mask. Even with the PAPR OFF and on SCBA mode, the standard Osen-Hunter 
SHIELD configuration is not a completely self-contained apparatus since all modes 
are routed through the same system. If a known “non-scrubable” atmospheric hazard 
exists, one of two actions is recommended: If possible, convert the SHIELD systems 
to SCBA-only mode by removing the PAPR system according to the user manual; or 
alternatively, install the blanking caps that are used during vacuum testing. As long as 
the system passes the vacuum test, this will prevent any ambient air from entering the 
system during use. The battery pack should also be disconnected to prevent damage 
to the PAPR motor in the event the switch is inadvertently turned on. 
9.6.3.  Determine isolation/ventilation. Prior to entering the space, determine whether to 
isolate or ventilate the space. Ventilation of the space can sometimes cause problems of its 
own to include creating an explosive environment. 
9.6.4.  Identify other hazards. Hazards to the team could include but not limited to: 
9.6.4.1.  Mechanical. Find source to cut power as required. 
9.6.4.2.  Engulfment. Consider reduced PPE in order to negotiate hazard. 
9.6.4.3.  Thermal. Ensure adequate PPE. 
9.6.4.4.  Chemical contact. Get SDS. 
9.6.4.5.  Electrical. Identify source and cut off station. 
9.6.4.6.  Booby traps. 
9.6.5.  Determine additional protective gear requirements. 
9.6.5.1.  Tyvex®/Tychem® garments will be worn in any environment where there is a 
threat of hazardous contaminant transfer to skin. (T-3). 
9.6.5.2.  Thermal protection. This could be anything from additional clothing to prevent 
hypothermia to gloves for handling burning material. 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
43 
9.6.5.3.  Voltmeter (to verify power is disconnected). 
9.6.6.  Identify two types of communications. Examples include voice, radio, whistle blows, 
hand signals and rope tugs. Two separate radio frequencies do not fulfill this requirement. 
9.6.7.  Identify entrant rescue procedures. Any time personnel enter a confined space; there 
will be a plan to retrieve the personnel. (T-3). 
9.6.7.1.  Self-rescue via self-haul, immediate means of retrieval, ascend or walk out on 
horizontal entry. 
9.6.7.2.  External retrieval via entrant’s tether. 
9.6.7.3.  Entry rescue. If the space prevents the ability to use a line for retrieval, there will 
be back up entrants prepared to enter the space for rescue. (T-3). Initial entrants will be 
prepared for quick hook up and retrieval by entry rescue team. (T-3). The entry rescue 
team will be tethered much like a safety diver. (T-3). 
9.6.8.  Minimum team equipment requirements: 
9.6.8.1.  Pre-entry team atmospheric monitor: 
9.6.8.1.1.  Calibrate and record significant levels in both “safe” area and the space.

brief with crew. Ensure personnel briefing ship’s crew have a radio to communicate the 
brief back to the team. 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
53 
11.6.4.2.  Approach at a 45° angle to vessels course. The leeward side of the vessel is 
highly recommended. However, conduct appropriate RM before selecting a side. Note: 
The optimum course for the vessel is 20°-30° off the bow, and into the wind and seas 
making 2-5 knots forward speed. This will help deflect wind and seas for better 
communication and smoother boarding. 
11.6.4.3.  Hold position forward of boarding station and ask for the sea painter line. 
Deploy the bow harness from its stowed position and connect the line then drift back 
allowing line to pull CRRC. 
11.6.4.4.  Attach frapping line(s). 
11.6.4.5.  Embark via rope/caving/ships ladder leaving Coxswain and one member. 
11.6.4.6.  The coxswain controls the CRRC while remaining operator receives hoist hook 
and attach lifting harness. Turn off engine, lift and lock in stowed position to avoid 
damage to engine and ship’s deck during lifting process. WARNING: Hoist hooks can 
weigh several hundred pounds and crush the operator into the side of the ship or the 
CRRC floor. Extreme caution must be exercised when the hook is near the CRRC 
(remember that waves affect a CRRC much more than a ship). 
11.6.4.7.  Final operators embark ship via ladder once lifting harness is secured to hoist. 
WARNING: Never raise or lower CRRC with personnel on board. The CRRC floor and 
lifting harness are not rated for personnel. 
11.6.5.  CRRC Lower Procedures: Reverse raise procedures. WARNING: Never back down 
parallel to clear a vessel under way. Depart at 45° angle.

58 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
12.3.1.  Diver Recall. Dive Supervisor briefs all Underwater Emergency Procedures prior to 
conducting dive operations. A method of diver recall is required for all dives. (T-3). 
12.3.2.  Entangled Diver. Diver entanglements are relatively common and should be 
considered only an inconvenience to a well-trained team. Divers usually find themselves or 
their buddies entangled by their tank valves, fin buckles, or dangling hoses and gauges. 
WARNING: Dive entanglements, if not addressed quickly and efficiently, can have a 
dramatic effect on usable bottom time, potentially endangering both the mission and the 
diver. 
12.3.2.1.  Self-Rescue in Entanglements. Conduct a head-to-fin check to determine point 
of entanglement, utilize personal cutting tools to get free entanglement. If unable to 
locate point of entanglement or unable to free entanglement, signal buddy or the standby 
diver for assistance. 
12.3.2.2.  Buddy/Standby Diver Assistance to Entangled Diver. The buddy/standby diver 
determines the point of entanglement and frees the primary diver. 
12.3.2.3.  Entangled Tending Line. If the primary diver’s line is entangled, the standby 
diver descends and clears both the lines, then ensures the diver is free. In the event the 
tending line is too entangled to clear, the standby diver clips into the diver’s harness with 
a contingency strap, cut the tender line and take the diver to the surface. 
12.3.3.  Underwater Emergency Signals. After signaling for the standby diver, the primary 
diver places a hand on the harness/tether attachment point. Having followed the tether to the 
diver the standby will encounter the diver’s hand. In low/no visibility, the divers then use one 
or more of the following hand signals to communicate. 
12.3.3.1.  Tapping the standby diver’s hand to the primary diver’s second stage indicates, 
“NEED MORE AIR.” Once the standby diver receives the signal, the standby diver 
places the primary diver’s hand on the octopus or the first stage of the new pony bottle. 
The primary diver removes the octopus or emergency gas supply bottle from the standby 
diver and inserts the mouthpiece. 
12.3.3.2.  The standby diver placing the primary diver’s hand on the harness/tether 
attachment point and giving three squeezes means, “I AM LEAVING, BUT I AM 
COMING RIGHT BACK.” 
12.3.3.3.  The primary diver makes a large circular motion with the standby diver’s hand 
and then placing his hand on point of entanglement indicating “THIS IS WHERE MY 
ENTANGLEMENT IS.” This also helps the standby avoid becoming entangled in the 
hazard. 
12.3.3.4.  Tapping the standby diver’s hand on the primary diver’s chest indicates “I AM 
HURT.” After tapping the chest, the primary diver guides the standby diver’s hand to the 
injured area. The standby diver moves slowly and gently to prevent further injury. 
12.4.  Dive Equipment Inspection Criteria.  All SCUBA and associated equipment will be 
inspected in accordance with AFI 10-3501 and the U.S. Navy Diving Manual, as well as both the 
Navy’s 3-M and its Planned Maintenance System (PMS) requirements. (T-2).

lowering the cable. Individual may be returned to the surface by lowering the aircraft. 
14.6.3.2.  Cable shock loading: Operational. Discuss RM with Aircraft Commander and 
hoist operator taking into account mission requirements, alternate means of 
insertion/extraction, and consequences of cable failure. 
14.6.4.  Procedures. 
14.6.4.1.  Infil procedures. Hoist rider will release aircraft restraint and move to the exit 
once secured to the hoist, cable slack is removed, and aircraft is established on short final. 
(T-3). 
14.6.4.2.  Exfil procedures. WARNING: Rotary wing aircraft build up static electricity 
that will discharge once the cable is grounded. Team should wait for cable to ground out 
prior to handling it. If fuel is in the terminal area, ensure the aircraft discharges static 
electricity away from fuel prior to exfil. Move away from fuel if able. 
14.6.4.2.1.  Rider(s) will give pre-briefed signal to aircraft when connected to hook 
and ready for exfil. (T-3). WARNING: Cable slack must be carefully monitored; 
excessive slack in the cable can wrap around parts of the operator or gear and cause 
injury. If the slack cannot be monitored, disconnect from the cable and move away 
until aircraft has eliminated all slack. 
14.6.4.2.2.  Aircraft may be prepared with a strap across top side edge of door to aid 
riders entering. 
14.6.4.2.3.  Once inside the aircraft, operators will secure themselves and patients as

14.6.4.3.3.2.  Repositioning the Tender. Tender is positioned offset prior to hoist 
initiation and control the rescue device throughout the hoist. WARNING: 
Insufficient offset of the tag line tender from the hoist point will negate the utility 
of the tag line and render it useless to control the rescue devices. This is 
particularly critical when hoisting SKEDCO® litter as insufficient tag line control 
will result in violent spins. WARNING: All taglines will have a weak link 
created with a single loop of gutted 550 cord or two wraps of 80lb test tape 
incorporated between tagline and litter. (T-3).

HAF coordinated syllabus are authorized to jump NVDs. (T-3). NVDs may be worn for all 
military free fall (MFF) operations; however, if they are not worn in the down-and-locked 
position during HALO operations, they should be in the up-and-locked position until after 
post opening procedures. The Jumpmaster makes the employment/TTP risk assessment for 
the team. 
 
 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
79 
15.5.3.  Equipment. PJ and CRO personnel are only authorized to jump equipment listed on 
the current AF Personnel Parachute Program Approved for Use List (PPP AUL). (See AFI 
10-3503 for more information). WARNING: Any load that is mounted low, front or rear, 
should have the “leg straps” worn tight enough to keep the load in place throughout the jump. 
On free fall operations, lightweight loads that are low, front-mounted can be particularly hard 
to control. Any load under 45 pounds should be evaluated for surface area in the relative 
wind to determine whether it is safe to jump. Note: Jumper should consider lowering all 
loads greater than 45 pounds if not high- or mid-mounted. 
15.5.4.  JMD drops. 
15.5.4.1.  Jumpmaster will have two points of reference or an established release point 
prior to Drop. (T-3). 
15.5.4.2.  Once the pilot has established drop clearance visually, verbally or 
electronically (e.g., green light, thumbs up, verbal clear to drop) indicating that the 
aircraft is within parameters and the pilot has cleared the team to jump, the decision lays 
solely with the jumpmaster on when, where and if to deploy the team or equipment. 
15.5.5.  Wind limitations. Static line and free fall wind limitations are defined in AFI 13-217, 
For operational deployments, careful consideration will be given to canopy performance, 
jumper experience, jumper’s equipment, drop zone size/elevation, exit altitude, and tactical 
situation surrounding the drop zone to ensure mission success. 
15.5.6.  Exit/deployment altitude restrictions. Exit/deployment altitudes and restrictions for 
training and operational limits are in accordance with AFI 10-3503 or MAJCOM/A3 
approved guidance. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.GA for recommended opening altitudes above and 
below 20,000 ft. MSL. 
15.5.7.  Spring loaded pilot chute. If used, a spring-loaded pilot chute may cause pilot chute 
hesitation and possibly an entanglement due to the low-pressure area behind the jumper. This 
low (negative) pressure area will vary based on the size and rate of decent of the jumper. To 
mitigate this risk, the jumper must lift a shoulder after pulling the ripcord to disrupt the 
burble and allow the pilot chute to escape. WARNING: Failure to break the burble of low 
pressure behind the parachutist to allow the spring-loaded pilot chute to escape may cause 
pilot chute hesitation or entanglements, which could lead to horseshoe malfunctions. 
15.5.8.  Parachute deployment airspeeds. Specific instructions for all aircraft deployment 
airspeeds and parachute operating procedures will be in accordance with AFI 11-2-MDS Vol. 
3, or service-specific aircraft flight manuals. WARNING: Emphasize maximum airspeed 
restrictions with the aircrew during mission planning and briefing. Use caution when 
coordinating with the crews of heavy lift aircraft. They frequently have weights that will 
force them to have airdrop speeds in excess of the safe exit limitations of 135 Knots for the 
MC1-1C/D/E. 
15.6.  Intentional Water/Tree Jumps.  When performing intentional water or tree jumps, PJ 
and CRO personnel will follow additional equipment rigging guidance contained in AFTTP 3-
3.GA. (T-3). 
15.7.  Electronic Automatic Activation Device (EAAD).  Use only EAADs listed on the AF 
PPP AUL. (T-1). 
80 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
15.7.1.  Parachutist must use an EAAD during training MFF operations. (T-2). 
15.7.2.  Parachutist must use an EAAD during contingency MFF operations unless the 
ranking jumpmaster determines it would add unnecessary time and complexity to mission 
execution. WARNING: When using “unknown drop zone (DZ) pressure” default setting of 
29.92 inches of mercury, the jumpmaster must also add 1,000 feet to the jumpers’ pull 
altitude as a safety factor in case the EAAD fires on the high side. (T-3). Failure to do so 
could cause a dual canopy deployment, resulting in injury or death to the parachutist. 
WARNING: If equipped, do NOT turn on EAAD when performing Ram Air Static Line 
(RASL) at exit altitudes below 3000ft above ground level (AGL). Pressure differentials 
during a hung jumper scenario may cause the EAAD to inadvertently fire while jumper is 
still attached to the aircraft. WARNING: EAAD calculations will be verified by a second, 
trained individual. (T-3). Incorrect settings can cause dual parachute activations with the 
potential of serious injury or death. 
15.8.  Risk Management.  In order to help form an accurate prediction of the RM, the following 
considerations should be made when planning the jump phase of the operation. 
15.8.1.  Oxygen requirements. 
15.8.2.  DZ wind speed. 
15.8.3.  DZ elevation.

15.10.2.18.  Flotation. When performing deliberate water jumps, floatation is required for 
jumpers in accordance with AFI 13-217. Options for jumper flotation are contained in 
AFMAN 11-420, ATP 3-18.11, and TC 18-11 and authorized equipment is listed on the 
AF PPP AUL. (For training water jumps, a LPU-3P or comparable device will be routed 
through the waistband of the parachute unless other approved flotation is authorized for 
the parachute system in order to recover equipment). (T-3). WARNING: Non-locking 
carabineers and other hook type items (e.g., boots with hook grommets versus eyelets) 
will not be jumped exposed, as the possibilities exist for pilot chute/canopy lines to be 
entangled within the devices preventing cut-away or causing a malfunction. Stow or tape 
as necessary and ensure locking carabineers are locked. 
15.11.  Equipment Checks.  Jumpers will prepare all equipment for jump operations prior to the 
jumpmaster parachutist inspection. (T-3). Check all equipment required for the jump operation. 
(T-3). Additional info can be found in AFMAN 11-420, ATP 3-18.11, and TC 18-11.

Maintenance Instruction for Survival Kit Components and Container Assembly (set ML-4 
kit on a chair with the arrow on top, pointing to the front of the chair, jumper then sits on 
the ML-4 and attaches to lower equipment V-rings, positioning the arrow between the 
legs, pointed at the knees). Note: Special care should be taken when jumping a rear 
mounted ML-4 kit on a free fall parachute in Bottom of Container pilot chute 
configuration. Jumpmasters must ensure jumpers have access to the pilot chute handle 
prior to releasing jumpers. (T-3). 
15.12.  Jumpmaster Personnel Inspection (JMPI).  PJ and CRO personnel are authorized to 
perform JMPIs when they have been specifically trained to conduct a JMPI in accordance with 
AFI 10-3503 and documented in their training records. Parachute specific information can be 
found in ATP 3-18.11, TC 18-11, AFMAN 11-420 and parachute manufacturer’s documentation. 
15.13.  Emergency Procedures.  In accordance with ATP 3-18.11, TC 18-11, and AFI 10-3503. 
15.14.  Military Tandem Tethered Bundle/Tandem.  Military tandem tethered bundle (MTTB) 
is designed to allow MFF parachutist to employ expert personnel or heavy or large equipment 
loads. 
15.14.1.  Responsibilities. 
15.14.1.1.  Tandem Master. 
15.14.1.1.1.  Ensure passenger(s) or MTTB is rigged in accordance with MAJCOM 
guidance. (T-3). 
15.14.1.1.2.  Brief passenger of required actions: in aircraft, on exit, in free fall, under 
canopy and on landing. (T-3). 
15.14.1.1.3.  Brief personnel assisting with Tandem operation. (T-3). 
15.14.1.2.  Equipment Bundle Safety. (Equipment Bundle Safety can be a jumper from 
the same stick.). 
15.14.1.2.1.  Remove tie down straps from MTTB when instructed by Tandem 
Master delivering the MTTB. 
15.14.1.2.2.  Assist Tandem Master with positioning the bundle in proper position for 
deployment. 
15.14.1.3.  Drogue Setter (drogue setter can be a jumper from the same stick). Note: 
Drogue Setters must receive ground training from the Tandem Master prior to conducting 
live jump operations. (T-3). 
15.14.1.3.1.  Prior to movement, the Tandem Master Drogue Setter must be in place 
and have a firm grasp of Tandem Master’s drogue chute. (T-3). 
15.14.1.3.2.  Move with Tandem Master into deployment position without releasing 
hold of drogue chute. 
15.14.1.3.3.  Ensure drogue chute has fully deployed from drogue pocket prior to 
releasing when Tandem Master exits the aircraft. 
15.14.2.  MTTB rigging procedures. See Chapter 16. 
84 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
15.14.3.  MTTB procedures. 
15.14.3.1.  Actions in the aircraft. 
15.14.3.1.1.  Equipment will be secured in the aircraft by tandem master or designee 
in accordance with MDS -9 requirements for taxi, takeoff and landing. (T-3). A 
minimum of one 5K cargo strap will secure each tandem bundle unit Tandem Master 
directs preparation for exit. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.  Time warnings. The following time warnings and actions will be 
followed: 
15.14.3.1.2.1.  “10-minute” warning. If not done prior to take-off, the Tandem 
Master will don the bundle recovery rig or attach tandem passenger and get 
appropriate JMPI checks. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.2.  “5-minute” warning. Tandem Master or bundle safety will remove 
all cargo straps except one. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.3.  “2-minute” warning. 
15.14.3.1.2.3.1.  Tandem Master will secure recovery parachute’s tethered 
carabineer to bundle. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.3.2.  Tandem Master controls his bundle by grasping the left and 
right handles on the bundle. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.3.3.  Tandem master will tell the bundle safety “I have the 
bundle.” Safety will respond with “You have the bundle” and release 
remaining cargo strap. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.3.4.  Drogue setter takes up position to the right of the Tandem 
Master and maintains a firm grip on the drogue pilot chute handle. Drogue 
setter will state, “I have your drogue,” to which Tandem Master will reply, 
“You have my drogue.” The drogue setter will ensure they remain to the right 
side of the Tandem Master until the drogue is deployed in order to have the 
drogue feed out of the right side of the drogue pouch. Ensure that the bundle 
safety remains to the left side of the bundle as not to interfere with the drogue 
setter’s duties. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.3.5.  Tandem Master moves the bundle to center portion of the 
ramp. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.4.  “1-minute” warning. 
15.14.3.1.2.4.1.  Tandem Master moves bundle to desired point in preparation 
for exit. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.4.2.  Tandem Master maintains visual contact with primary 
jumpmaster, or safetyman (situation will dictate). (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.4.3.  If a bundle safety is assisting with moving the bundle, he 
may rotate to the left to assist with the next bundle or return to his position in 
the stick. 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
85 
15.14.3.1.2.4.4.  When the jumpmaster gives the “Standby” command to the 
Tandem Master, the drogue setter ensures he is to the Tandem Master’s right 
side with a firm two-handed grip on the Tandem Master’s drogue pilot chute, 
assuring that his footing is solid and nothing can interfere with the setting of 
the drogue pilot chute. 
15.14.3.1.2.5.  “GO” exit procedure: 
15.14.3.1.2.5.1.  When the jumpmaster gives the command of “GO,” the 
Tandem Master establishes eye-to-eye contact with the drogue setter and 
begins a head and verbal cadence of “Ready - Set – Go.” (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.5.2.  On the count of “GO,” the Tandem Master pushes the bundle 
straight off the ramp of the aircraft while maintaining a firm grip on the 
bundle handles. Once clear of the ramp, within 6 seconds the right hand 
confirms the drogue is set, followed by a systems check. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.5.3.  As the Tandem Master leaves the aircraft, the drogue setter 
accompanies him to the edge of the ramp, holding the drogue to the center of 
the ramp, controlling it until the drogue is pulled from his hands, thus 
preventing contact with the aircraft. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.5.4.  As soon as the drogue pilot chute leaves the drogue setter’s 
hands, he must rotate to the right out of the next Tandem Master’s way or 
rotate to the next Tandem Master to become his drogue setter. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.5.5.  If there is a second Tandem Master for the drogue setter, the 
Tandem Master does not move forward past the hinge of the ramp until the 
drogue setter moves to his right side and grips his drogue with both hands, at 
which time the drogue setter will tell the Tandem Master that he has control of 
his drogue pilot chute. (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.5.6.  The Tandem Master will ensure that his exit does not 
interfere with other team members (recommend the Tandem Master delays 5 
seconds after previous jumper deploys to ensure adequate separation from the 
team). (T-3). 
15.14.3.1.2.5.7.  Tandem Master can exit first or last with the accompaniment 
of JM, drogue setter and optional bundle safety. Alternately, a static line 
drogue alleviates need of drogue setter. Retrieve static line deployment bag 
before subsequent jumpers if Tandem Master is first. 
15.14.3.1.2.5.8.  Crosswind release is preferred to give team stack and tandem 
bundles separate ‘lanes’ to the Point of Impact (PI). 
15.14.3.1.2.5.9.  If the jumpmaster gives a “NO DROP,” the Tandem Master 
will pull the bundle back to the two-minute warning position and wait for 
further instructions from the jumpmaster. (T-3). 
15.14.3.2.  Free fall procedures. WARNING: Team members will remain clear of 
tandem master and bundles to ensure they are not entangled in tandem master’s 
equipment during free fall. (T-3). 
86 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
15.14.3.3.  Canopy procedures. Note: Release bundle, if necessary, at 800 feet AGL if 
landing with the bundle incurs a safety hazard to the jumper (e.g., rocky terrain, tall 
vegetation, etc.). WARNING: No turns will be conducted below 200 feet with the 
exception of minor corrections necessary to land as close to the DZ as possible. (T-2). 
15.14.4.  Personnel tandem time warnings: 
15.14.4.1.  “10-minute” warning: 
15.14.4.1.1.  Tandem Master secures passenger and equipment to tandem parachute 
system. (T-3). 
15.14.4.1.2.  Tandem Master and passenger receive final JMPI. (T-3). 
15.14.4.2.  “2-minute” warning: 
15.14.4.2.1.  Tandem pair stand and move to hinge of ramp or designated pre-exit 
position. (T-3). 
15.14.4.2.2.  Floor-loaded aircraft: Tandem pair accomplishes all passenger 
connections steps up to tightening lower connector straps. Note: When adjusting the 
main lift webs and the rear diagonals, it is important to remember that the larger the 
passenger, the farther to the passenger’s rear the upper connectors must be. This will 
ensure that the passenger rides in the proper position and provides more comfort and 
good blood flow for the passenger. Never allow the connectors to go forward of the 
passenger’s shoulders. WARNING: Improperly adjusted leg straps can cause 
restricted blood flow in the lower extremities resulting in discomfort and/or loss of 
consciousness. 
15.15.  Precision Jumpmaster Procedures.  Precision Jumpmaster (PJM) procedures are a 
subset of JMD utilized to enable the rapid deployment of personnel through precision release 
point determination under current conditions. Minimizing the distance to the survivor increases 
their chance of survival while decreasing the team exposure to the elements and the threat. When 
PJM procedures cannot be executed because of time or threat, precision jumpmasters will 
perform CARP or HARP calculation procedures to obtain the release point. If the aircraft is 
crewed with a navigator/combat systems operator, the JM will compare calculated release points. 
(T-3). If there is a discrepancy of greater than 250m, both should check data and calculations. If 
there is still a disparity, they will come up with a mutually acceptable solution. The Jumpmaster 
has final authority when deploying personnel. 
15.15.1.  Additional guidance. Aircraft specific parachute deployment procedures are 
contained in each aircraft’s MDS specific guidance, and amended as necessary by 
subordinate supplements, flight crew information files and unit flight crew bulletins (FCB). 
JMs should be familiar with and review the paradrop procedures used by the deployment 
aircraft. All JMs should review the applicable portions of the FCB of the flying organizations 
routinely supporting PJ/CRO parachute operations. 
15.15.2.  Unless threats to the aircraft exist, PJM drops are more appropriate to ensure rescue 
personnel land on the intended objective. During PJM airdrops, the JM is responsible for the 
accuracy of the drop. (T-3). 
15.15.2.1.  JMD airdrops of any type are authorized for training during visual 
meteorological conditions. (T-3). 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
87 
15.15.2.2.  Procedures, verbal communication, and visual signals are located in AFTTP 
3-3.GA, and will be briefed prior to execution. (T-3). 
15.15.3.  Wind drift indicator (WDI). The primary tool for a JM to determine accurate release 
point during PJM is the WDI. Wind drift determination is critical to accurate target 
deployment. The JM should deploy a minimum of one WDI prior to personnel delivery, with 
consideration to deploying additional WDIs as necessary for verification. Consider additional 
WDIs if: 
15.15.3.1.  Delivery site is restrictive. 
15.15.3.2.  Wind velocity appears marginal or gusty. 
15.15.3.3.  Lost sight of or unsure of the landing location/accuracy of the previous WDI. 
15.15.3.4.  Suspect the wind conditions have changed since the last deployment. 
15.15.3.5.  Any doubt as to delivery conditions. 
15.15.3.6.  Terrain that would produce inconsistent winds between the downwind and 
upwind sides of the PI. 
15.15.4.  JM/pilot communication. The JM and pilot may use two methods to inform the 
other of the location of an object in the air or on the ground (e.g., wind drift device, 
equipment or parachutist): 
15.15.4.1.  For items in the air or on the ground away from the DZ, identify the object’s 
position in respect to the aircraft by giving a clock position, distance and altitude (e.g., 
“Streamers are at 9 o’clock, just under the wing and above the road”). 
15.15.4.2.  For items on the drop zone, use the PI and heading of “last final flown” as 12 
o’clock. (e.g., “Steamers landed at the PI’s 5 o’clock for 300 Meters.”). 
15.15.5.  Attachment 2  provides figures and procedural guidance for specific PJM methods. 
15.16.  Aircraft Inspections.  Refer to AFMAN 11-420, ATP 3-18.11, TC 18-11, or MDS 
specific guidance. 
15.17.  Combination Exit Procedures.  See Chapter 16.

96 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
Table 16.1.  Tandem Bundle Calculations. 
In order to determine the ideal weight for a fixed container: 
 
In order to determine ideal cylinder for predetermined equipment: 
 
In order to determine the velocity of a rigged bundle: 
 
C = drag coefficient 
When cylinder is 4x8ft tube on end =1.0 to 1.05 
When cylinder is 4x8ft presenting a side to the wind = 1.15 
D =density of air (given in feet above MSL) 
0 = .07 
5000 = .06 
15,000 = .044 
30,000 = .026 
V = velocity of bundle in ft./sec (parameters should be between 265 and 440 without RM) 
A = Area of surface presented to the wind; 
 where  and r = radius given in feet (remember radius is half the diameter) 
 given in feet 
g = Gravity (32.2 feet/sec) 
W = weight of equipment, container and rigging material in pounds 
16.10.2.4.  Perform RM determination. In order to get a clear idea of the risk include the 
following items and weigh them against the mission importance and impact of the 
equipment. 
16.10.2.4.1.  Bundle fall rate. Canopy and jumper integrity can be negatively affected 
as fall rate approaches 440 ft./sec. Above 440 ft./sec is considered a high risk for 
injury, system failure or both. 
16.10.2.4.2.  Wind speed on DZ. 
16.10.2.4.3.  Elevation, size and condition of DZ. 
16.10.2.4.4.  Support for Tandem Master (team members or ground assistance). 
16.10.2.5.  Loading container. 
16.10.2.5.1.  Place the items to be airdropped on padding. Place the durable or heavy 
items on the bottom and the lighter or more fragile items on the middle or top layers. 
Use the cellulose wadding, felt or honeycomb to cushion the rigged items and to fill 
the load before closing the container. 
16.10.2.5.2.  The longer the barrel, the more important the center of gravity. For 
bundles over 3 feet, attempt to maintain a CG of 2/3 towards presenting area. Use 
caution on barrels that are in excess of 4 feet with dense weight at the nose end (e.g., 
CG of 7/8 towards presenting area); they tip as soon as the nose of the barrel crosses 
the ramp edge and trailing end can impact the tandem master, cause uncomfortable 
exits or do both. Also, ensure sufficient ceiling height for long barrels with a 
significantly nose heavy CG. 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
97 
16.10.2.5.3.  Provide padding for sensitive mission equipment. Padding may also be 
applied to the outside of the container. WARNING: Fill all voids with padding so 
that items will not shift during transport/ deployment. If the equipment shifts, this will 
cause severe pendulum during free fall. 
16.10.2.6.  Rig load in accordance with manufacturer’s guides. (T-3). 
16.10.2.7.  Suspend equipment, and check balance. (T-3). 
16.10.2.8.  Weigh and measure container AGAIN. If necessary, repeat above calculations 
for adjusted bundle. (T-3). 
16.10.2.9.  Label container with: 
16.10.2.9.1.  Surface area. (T-3). 
16.10.2.9.2.  Weight. (T-3). 
16.10.2.9.3.  Expected fall rate with air density (e.g., 300ft/sec @ 5000’). (T-3). 
16.11.  Joint Precision Aerial Delivery System (JPADS).  JPADS is a family of systems 
consisting of a specialized JPADS mission planner laptop computer loaded with airdrop 
calculating software, an ultra-high frequency dropsonde interface, a GPS retransmit subsystem, 
and dropsondes. The current JPADS steerable parafoil guidance systems are the Microfly® 
(capable of 200-700 lbs. suspended weight) and Firefly (capable of 700-2K lbs. suspended 
weight). 
16.11.1.  Set up. 
16.11.1.1.  For rigging procedures, reference the manufacturer’s technical manuals. 
16.11.1.2.  The deploying team will meet the following minimum lighting for night 
training: 
16.11.1.2.1.  Each side of package: 2 blue lights. (T-3). 
16.11.1.2.2.  Back of Airborne Guidance Unit (AGU): 2 green lights. (T-3). 
16.11.1.2.3.  Front of AGU: 2 red lights. (T-3). 
16.11.1.2.4.  Spider harness: 2 strobes. (T-3). 
16.11.1.3.  Upload the current National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 4-D 
weather model before proceeding to the aircraft. (T-3). 
16.11.1.4.  Ensure AGU and mission planning computer connectivity prior to takeoff. (T-
3). 
16.11.1.5.  Verify the AGU is set to the AUTOLAND mode. (T-3). 
16.11.1.6.  A minimum of 6000’ AGL drop altitude should be establish to allow the 
parafoil system adequate altitude to compensate for winds and set up its landing pattern. 
16.11.1.7.  For combination drops, use the calculated personnel release point as the 
JPADS has a more efficient glide ratio. See Table 16.2 to calculate optimal weights for a 
consistent stack rate of fall. WARNING: Care must be taken to ensure that parachutists 
do not wing load their canopies more than the JPADS, this may place the parachutist in 
the dangerous position of being lower than the JPADS package.

16.11.2.  Procedures. 
16.11.2.1.  Brief the JPADS annex to the personnel parachute brief. (T-3). 
16.11.2.2.  It is highly recommended that all jumpers are NVD equipped. 
16.11.2.3.  Deployment. Normal CRL, CDS or Jumpmaster directed (JMD) procedures 
are used. WARNING: Never deploy the AGU in the OFF mode. The AGU takes 
approximately one minute to boot up and will not respond to AGU controller inputs while 
booting. Deploying an AGU in the OFF mode creates an unsafe condition. (T-3). 
16.11.2.4.  The JPADS system will be deployed prior to jumpers. 
16.11.2.4.1.  RASL, the jumpers can treat the JPADS as a jumper and follow it at a 2-
second interval. However, a 5-second delay is recommended for safety in case the 
JPADs opens off heading. (T-3). 
16.11.2.4.2.  MFF, first jumper (Remote Control Operator (RCO)) will delay 4-5 
seconds and only exit after ensuring the D-bag is clear (either retrieved or broke 
away). (T-3). 
16.11.2.5.  Normally after exiting the aircraft, the RCO overrides the AGU’s autonomous 
mode and flies the AGU, allowing the team to stack on the package. After the stack is 
formed, the RCO returns the AGU to the autonomous mode and the team follows it to the 
PI. WARNING: In autonomous mode, the AGU will do a series of wide S turns between 
1,000 to 2,000 ft. AGL to determine wind direction and then compute its final landing 
heading. All jumpers will remain aware of these maneuvers and stay clear of the package. 
16.11.3.  Emergency procedures. 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
99 
16.11.3.1.  Avoiding the AGU cannot be understated. As with any parachute collision, 
the impact forces will be close to the speeds driven on a highway. If a jumper collides 
with the AGU, and the AGU has a good canopy, that canopy will be heavily wing-loaded. 
Because of the wing loading, any turns WILL cause a pendulum effect. In addition, the 
AGU will not fly at 50% brakes, but will be at “full flight” for landing. This means that it 
is imperative that the suspended jumper cutaway prior to 1000ft or be prepared for a 
violent parachute landing fall. 
16.11.3.2.  If a jumper ends up below a JPADS after opening or cut-away, the jumper 
slows rate of decent and attempts to rejoin stack. 
16.11.3.3.  Controller manually controls AGU and attempts to get AGU below low 
jumper and allow them to rejoin stack. 
16.11.3.4.  Collision/entanglement with package. Note: These procedures are intended to 
correspond with personnel entanglement emergency procedures so individual jumpers 
will not have to memorize a different set of emergency procedures if entanglement occurs 
with an AGU. 
16.11.3.4.1.  Avoid AGU at all costs/Steer to avoid. 
16.11.3.4.2.  If collision is imminent, assume the modified spread eagle position 
while protecting handles. 
16.11.3.4.3.  If jumper’s canopy is entangled with AGU and AGU has a good canopy: 
cut away no lower than 1000 ft. AGL. 
16.11.3.4.4.  Lower/jettison combat equipment. 
16.11.3.4.5.  Be prepared for a violent parachute landing fall. 
16.11.3.4.6.  At no time will an RCO attempt to control/land an AGU with a jumper 
suspended under it. 
16.11.3.4.7.  If jumper has a good canopy but AGU canopy is entangled with jumper, 
the jumper should clear the canopy/entanglement from himself and his equipment. 
16.11.3.4.8.  If jumper and AGU are entangled and neither has a good canopy, clear 
yourself from entanglement and cut away regardless of position in the entanglement. 
16.11.3.4.9.  If impact with ground is imminent, deploy reserve in an attempt to slow 
decent. 
16.11.3.5.  Lost visual or cannot acquire AGU after exit. 
16.11.3.5.1.  Keep scanning and attempt to visually acquire AGU. 
16.11.3.5.2.  Turn to briefed heading and continue scanning.

DROP ZONE / LANDING ZONE 
17.1.  General.  Drop zone operations will be in accordance with AFI 10-3503, AFI 13-217, 
AFMAN 11-420, ATP 3-18.11, or TC 18-11. Additional drop zone guidance is listed below. 
During training jumps, every attempt should be made to duplicate conditions encountered during 
operational missions. 
17.2.  DZ/LZ Responsibilities. 
17.2.1.  Team Leader/Jumpmaster. 
17.2.1.1.  The TL/JM in charge of training is responsible for briefing the Drop Zone 
personnel of the requirements for training. 
17.2.1.2.  The TL/JM in charge of training will use the current and approved DZ survey 
to determine the number of personnel to be dropped per pass based on jumper 
proficiency, prevailing winds and AFI 13-217. (T-3). 
17.2.2.  Drop Zone Controller (DZC) responsibilities. 
17.2.2.1.  During unilateral operations, the DZC can perform Drop Zone Safety Officer 
(DZSO) and malfunction officer duties. Personnel will receive training in accordance 
with AFI 13-217, AFI 13-210_IP, and be designated by unit commander prior to 
conducting DZC/DZSO operations. (T-3). 
17.2.2.2.  DZ Medic responsibilities. 
17.2.2.2.1.  Medic will ensure all medical equipment is prepositioned and accessible 
for immediate treatment of injured personnel in accordance with unit SOP and AFI 
10-3503. (T-3). A dedicated ground medic is not required for unilateral training that 
includes at least two members medically qualified in accordance with AFI 10-3503 
on the first pass. The required medical equipment will be prepositioned with the 
ground party and accessible for immediate treatment of injured personnel. (T-3). 
17.2.2.2.2.  Vehicle suitable for evacuating injured jumpers and a driver. (T-3). 
Exception: A vehicle is not required when the aircraft can land adjacent to the DZ. 
17.3.  Ground Party Briefing Requirements.  The JM will ensure the ground party is briefed in 
accordance with the current Briefing Guide. (T-3). 
17.4.  DZ/LZ Set up.  The DZC will inspect all ground party equipment prior to use:

AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
101 
17.5.1.  Units will have current and approved drop zone surveys for areas utilized in 
sufficient quantity/location to provide JMs access to selected drop zone information. (T-3). 
Drop zone surveys may be obtained by calling DSN 576-2899 or use the HQ AMC web site 
(https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10358/default.aspx). DZCs ensure the following: 
17.5.2.  Communications. 
17.5.2.1.  Direct radio communication from the DZC to the aircraft will be the primary 
method of communication for all training parachute operations. (T-3). In case of primary 
communication failure, back up communications will also be identified. (T-3). 
17.5.2.1.1.  Communication may be relayed through adjacent air tower as a back up 
to direct DZ communication in case direct communication fails. 
17.5.2.1.2.  Air/Ground radio communication is required for all training night 
deployments. EXCEPTION: The ranking TC/TL/JM may waive the direct radio 
communications requirement after RM analysis if procedures in AFI 13-217 and pre-
briefed visual DZ markings are used for the drop. 
17.5.2.2.  Contact phone numbers. Communication plans should include phone numbers 
and access numbers. Numbers to consider: Flying squadron operations, Jumpmaster, 
aircraft commander, range control, Air Traffic Control, MEDEVAC and local hospitals. 
17.5.2.3.  Visual signals. Standard NORDO signals are in accordance with AFI 13-217 
and below: 
17.5.2.3.1.  CLEAR TO JUMP: Land - Target displayed. Water - boat circling off 
wind line. 
17.5.2.3.2.  NO 
DROP 
THIS 
PASS: 
Land 
- 
target 
scrambled 
or 
red 
smoke/flares/lights on the DZ. Water - boat stationary in water. 
17.5.2.3.3.  JUMP CANCELED: Land -Target removed. Water - boat rapidly 
traveling away from the drop zone. 
17.5.2.3.4.  INJURED JUMPER: Red smoke or flare on the DZ or at place of injury. 
17.5.2.4.  Strict control of light signals will be maintained at all times as the unnecessary 
exposure of light may confuse personnel aboard the aircraft. (T-3). Lights, other than 
those used for the desired point of impact, and those aircraft lighting systems required by 
regulatory guidance, will remain out for the duration of parachute operations. (T-3). 
17.5.2.5.  In the event of an injury or any unusual circumstance that requires the 
excessive use of lights, parachute operations will be suspended until a light condition 
satisfactory to the TL/JM can be reestablished. (T-3). 
17.5.3.  Additional water procedures: See AFI 10-3503 for additional requirement for 
intentional water jump operations and AFTTP 3-3.GA for TTPs. 
17.5.3.1.  Medical coverage must be in place prior to personnel airdrops. (T-3). If 
medical personnel are not in the same safety boat as the drop zone controller, the medical 
personnel must have communications with them. (T-3). 
102 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
17.5.3.2.  All water training jumps require a safety swimmer present in the support boat, 
prior to jumpers exiting the aircraft. The safety swimmer will be appropriately dressed 
and ready for immediate water entry should an emergency arise. (T-3). 
17.5.3.3.  During AF intentional water operations, one power driven recovery boat is 
required for every three parachutists on a single pass in accordance with AFMAN 11-
420(I). (T-3). When all parachutists are military divers, the minimum ratio is reduced to 
one for every six parachutists on a single pass. Airdropped boats are not considered 
functional until operational, at which point they may be used for recovery operations. 
17.5.4.  Injured jumper. Treatment of the injured usually takes priority over other DZ 
activities. When a jumper’s injuries on the DZ require evacuation for life, limb or eyesight, 
all further jump activities should be cancelled unless DZSO determines to deploy additional 
jumpers to manage the incident. Following any parachute related injury: 
17.5.4.1.  Advise aircraft of jumper’s status and evacuation requirements. 
17.5.4.2.  Isolate jumper’s equipment. 
17.5.4.3.  Note surface winds, type landing and any unusual circumstances.

RESCUE JUMPMASTER PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE 
A2.1.  Fixed Target. 
A2.1.1.  Procedures. (See Paragraph 15.15 and Figure A2.1 Fixed Target Pattern.). 
A2.1.1.1.  Head directly toward the target, regardless of the wind direction. 
A2.1.1.2.  Release the WDI directly over the target. 
A2.1.1.3.  Immediately upon release, have the aircraft begin a turn, tight enough to 
observe descent and position of WDI and not lose sight of it. 
A2.1.1.4.  Establish a rectangular drop pattern oriented so that the final approach is flown 
oriented from the WDI to the target. 
A2.1.1.5.  Turn on approach. Make minor changes in heading to pass over the WDI and 
the target on a direct line. Establish aircraft drift correction prior to passing over the 
WDI. 
A2.1.1.6.  Initiate uniform count over the WDI. 
A2.1.1.7.  Reverse count over the target. 
A2.1.1.8.  Deploy either a second WDI or jumpers when the reverse count reaches zero. 
(For multiple jumpers, consider the DZ and that jumpers release before/after reaching 
zero will land short/long of the target.). 
A2.1.1.9.  After the jumper clears the aircraft, turn to observe the accuracy of the drop. 
A2.1.2.  Fixed Target Pattern. The normal flight pattern is a rectangular or racetrack pattern 
with the final approach from WDI to target. Each leg of the pattern must be long enough to 
allow the JM and jumpers the preparation needed prior to deployment. 
A2.1.2.1.  For high performance aircraft, make the turn to the crosswind leg as soon as 
possible after releasing the WDI. A pattern with crosswind and base legs of not over 30 
seconds and with downwind and final legs of 60 to 90 seconds will allow time for 
heading corrections on final. This allows the JM time to observe the descent of WDI 
device or jumpers. If a delay is expected, fly another full pattern, as opposed to extending 
the downwind leg, this maintains the aircraft close to the area for continued evaluation. 
This pattern will place the aircraft a maximum of 5 minutes from the site at any one time. 
A2.1.2.2.  Fly the aircraft over the target at a predetermined altitude and airspeed. When 
directly over the target, drop a minimum of one WDI. The JM and aircrew will make 
every effort to keep the WDI in sight from release to impact. Over land, the pilot may 
have to circle over the WDI to ensure the definite location of, or orientation to the impact 
point to the target. After the first WDI has reached the ground and its position noted, the 
aircraft will return to the normal pattern. The final approach should pass directly over the 
WDI and the intended target, in that order. This pattern automatically aligns the final 
approach into the wind. 
 
 
120 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
A2.1.2.3.  Depending on terrain and aircraft configuration, the aircraft may fly either a 
right or left hand pattern with minor course corrections on final. As the aircraft passes 
directly over the first WDI, the JM starts a uniform count to measure the time from the 
WDI to the target. When the aircraft is over the target, stop counting forward and start 
counting backward from that point, when the JM’s count returns to zero, deploy the 
second WDI or jumper. The reverse count measures an equal distance past the target as 
was calculated from the WDI to the target. Subsequently, the accuracy of the deployment 
is dependent upon the JM’s alignment and count.

A2.2.  Moving Target. 
A2.2.1.  Procedures. (See Paragraph 15.15 and Figure A2.2 Moving Target Pattern.). 
A2.2.1.1.  Head directly toward the target, regardless of the wind direction. 
A2.2.1.2.  Release the spotter chute directly over the target. 
122 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
A2.2.1.3.  Immediately upon release, make a left/right hand turn to observe the descent 
and position of the WDI. 
A2.2.1.4.  Establish rectangular drop pattern oriented with the final approach from WDI 
to target. Adjust the pattern so that the aircraft will be over the target five to nine minutes 
after the WDI deployment. 
A2.2.1.5.  Turn on approach. Make minor changes in heading to pass over the WDI and 
the target on a direct line. Establish aircraft drift correction prior to passing over the 
WDI. Initiate a uniform count over the WDI. 
A2.2.1.6.  Reverse count over the target. 
A2.2.1.7.  Deploy jumpers upon reaching the last digit in the reverse count. 
A2.2.1.8.  After the jumper clears the aircraft, turn to observe the accuracy of the drop. 
A2.2.1.9.  Deploy additional jumpers using the drop heading and count established in 
steps 5, 6 and 7. 
A2.2.1.10.  Disregard the WDI for subsequent passes. 
A2.2.1.11.  When the target drift rate is changed (drogue chute is installed on target, 
know wind shift occurs, etc.) the entire WDI procedure must be re-accomplished and a 
new drop heading and count established. 
A2.2.2.  Moving Target Pattern. Deployment procedures to a moving target are similar to 
those employed for a stationary target. Moving target procedures take into consideration 
target drift and place the team on the downdrift line of the moving target, not necessarily on 
target. Special attention should be paid to the following items: 
A2.2.2.1.  Adjust the pattern so that the initial pass over the target after WDI deployment 
is not less than 5 minutes and not more than 9 minutes, 7 minutes being ideal. If the 
initial pattern requires more than 9 minutes, the team will be too far downdrift/downwind 
and with a high target drift rate may not be able to see the target once in the water. 
A2.2.2.2.  On the initial pass after the WDI deployment, an accurate count can be 
obtained by the JM and the heading noted by both the JM and pilot. Make all subsequent 
passes on this initial heading using the count obtained on the first pass. Do not attempt to 
recheck the count or change the initial heading because the target will have drifted. Note: 
On subsequent passes requiring a change of heading to place the aircraft over the target, 
ensure the pilot corrects back to original heading before passing over the target. Moving 
target procedures are normally conducted from fixed-wing aircraft.

A2.3.  Crosswind Target. 
A2.3.1.  Procedures. (See Paragraph 15.15 and Figure A2.3 Crosswind Target Pattern.). 
A2.3.1.1.  Fly over target on heading in a direction to permit a left/right hand pattern. 
124 
AFMAN10-3511  2 DECEMBER 2020 
A2.3.1.2.  Release the WDI directly over target. 
A2.3.1.3.  Accomplish a 180° turn (terrain permitting) in direction of drift and observe 
distance of WDI from target. 
A2.3.1.4.  Make another 180° turn to place the aircraft on the approach leg the same 
distance upwind from the target as the spotter chute is downwind. 
A2.3.1.5.  Deploy jumpers, equipment or additional spotters chutes/streamers (as 
required) just prior to when the aircraft is in direct line with the target and WDI. 
A2.3.2.  Crosswind pattern. 
A2.3.2.1.  A crosswind pattern may be required by terrain conditions or possible sun 
reflection on the water’s surface. The pilot and JM must accurately judge the upwind 
distance from the target in order for this technique to be effective. The easiest method for 
obtaining an accurate upwind distance is the utilization of a reference/release point. It is 
imperative that the jumpers are deployed prior to reaching the reference point due to the 
forward throw and ballistics of the parachute as opening occurs. The objective is to place 
the reference point at the center of the stick after forward throw is considered. 
A2.3.2.2.  Spotting techniques. Reference points may be used on all JMD land 
deployments. The utilization of reference points will increase the JMs accuracy in 
determining the proper release point. An established reference/release point will allow the 
aircraft to fly in any direction as long as it will pass over the reference/release point. 
These points are a necessity when accomplishing a crosswind or down-wind deployment 
pattern. The correct method for establishing a reference/release point is: 
A2.3.2.2.1.  Upon completion of the initial over the target WDI deployment, establish 
the impact location of the WDI. 
A2.3.2.2.2.  Pick out a spot that is an equal distance on the opposite side of the target 
as the WDI. This spot can be any readily identifiable feature, e.g., discolored ground,

assure that both are utilizing the same point of reference.
