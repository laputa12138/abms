Expeditionary Airfield Planning Considerations
1. Overview
The purpose of this chapter is to frame the establishment of an aerial lodgment,
and to identify key planning considerations. This will assist planners in identifying the
five “Ws” (who, what, where, when, and why) on force projection in the initial stages
of planning.
Identifying the combatant commander’s (CCDR’s) intent early in the operational
planning process is important for influencing the Service’s port opening capabilities
as a tool to project airpower. This force is considered a “supported” ground force
maneuver element which ensures adequate force protection (FP) measures and
resource allocation are included for potential follow-on missions.
2. Operational Environment
Establishing and maintaining aerial lodgments that enable aviation asset
positioning within the range of supported forces supplement aviation employment.
These tasks become more complicated when airbases are hosts to a variety of
military, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), other governmental organizations,
and commercial air activities.
The Army and Air Force hold joint responsibility for selecting landing zones (LZs),
with the objective of deploying and sustaining the air-landed or airborne force. The
Army coordinates the LZ site selection with the Air Force before making the final
decision. Information gathered from a landing area study that highlights options
ranging from existing large, modern facilities to more austere and underdeveloped
areas suitable only for short takeoffs and landings provides the basis for this
decision. Planners should include a weather analyst (or forecaster) in LZ studies and
selection to obtain pertinent climatology, including predominant wind direction and
speed, cloud ceilings, and visibility. Planners evaluate potential sites based on
enemy threat, suitability by type, quantity and sortie rate of aircraft; and the capacity
of available airfield support facilities or services. Planners will identify infrastructure
requirements (in terms of repair or improvement) and provide a prioritized listing of
recommended projects to the commander who will approve and assign construction
tasks (mission) to an engineer force.
The Navy and Marine Corps are responsible for selecting landing areas to deploy
and sustain Naval forces ashore. Where time allows, qualified airfield assessors
should forward AF Form 3822 (Landing Zone Survey), (or other airfield assessment
information) to the combined air operations center (CAOC), via the operational chain
of command, so the information is available to the joint force. This provides follow-on
forces usable information on the airfield status at the time of information collection.
In some instances, it may be the only information available for a particular location.
Desirable characteristics of LZs are ease of identification from the air; a straight,
unobstructed, secure approach for aircraft, proximity to ground objectives and units,
and suitable weather conditions. Some necessary characteristics of LZs identified for
2 
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
development into theater aerial ports with sophisticated facilities include the 
following: 
An area of sufficient size to accommodate the number and type of aircraft 
introduced.
Areas for parking and dispersal to accommodate the planned capacity of the 
facility.
An internal road network, capable of supporting use by ground vehicles that 
directly support airfield operations.
Minimum construction and maintenance requirements.
Areas and facilities for air terminal operations.
Facilities for holding personnel awaiting evacuation (e.g., medical or
noncombatant persons). 
Sufficient aerial port capacity to handle incoming personnel, equipment, and 
supplies.
Facilities to support aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) vehicles and 
equipment.
Availability of electromagnetic spectrum for planned operations. 
Well-established and maintained aerial ports are essential to successful aviation 
combat and sustainment operations. These operations include air movement and 
aerial sustainment of special operations, infantry, airborne, air assault, and heavy 
forces. Aviation sustainment operations also support high-priority resupply and air 
movement throughout the theater of operations.
Airfield service elements must maintain the capability of 24/7 operations and an 
ability to launch and recover aircraft safely in all weather conditions. This requires
consideration of the following: 
Experienced and adequately trained airfield management, air traffic 
controllers, and radar, airfield, and weather systems (RAWS) personnel. 
Adequate personnel and resources maintained through appropriate battle 
rhythm management.
Operational, sustainable, and certified navigational aids (NAVAIDS) and 
approved terminal instrument procedures (TERPS). 
Adequate airfield lighting and required airfield markings.
Advanced, digitized communications systems providing increased situational 
awareness.
Adequate weather equipment and trained weather personnel. 
Types of aircraft using the airfield and the assigned tasks associated with the 
airfield’s mission dictate airfield planning principles and services. Consider the
mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops, support available, time available, civil

considerations, and informational considerations when evaluating airfield 
requirements.  
The combination of the enemy threat, high-density air traffic, lack of established 
procedures outside airport traffic areas, and tactical unmanned aircraft system 
(UAS) operations create the potential for midair collisions in a low-altitude 
environment.
3. Senior Airfield Authority (SAA) and Base Operating Support-Integrator (BOS-I)
The most critical components of a successful airfield opening are the SAA and
BOS-I and their interactions. The Service component commander should designate
the personnel to fill these responsibilities early to facilitate transition from expedient
to sustained operations.
The SAA is responsible for airfield operations at the direction of the joint force
commander (JFC). The SAA controls, operates and maintains the airfield. This
includes the deployable air traffic control and landing system (DATCALS); runways;
taxiways and parking ramps; and air, land, safety surfaces and facilities the proximity
of which affects airfield operations. The SAA coordinates all component or joint task
force (JTF) aircraft and airfield facilities. The SAA controls airfield access and is
responsible for safe operations in the airport traffic area, controlled movement areas,
and on all airfield surfaces. Airfield operations personnel are the on-site focal points
of operations and have primary responsibility for operating the airfield, enforcing
airfield operating procedures, and coordinating airfield requirements on behalf of the
SAA. Due to the rapid and evolving nature of an airfield opening, the SAA may not
be designated or available at the commencement of operations. Under these
circumstances, the initial airfield opening forces commander (e.g., special tactics
mission commander, contingency response force (CRF) commander, or senior
officer on the ground) will serve as the acting SAA until the designated SAA arrives.
(See Joint Publication (JP) 3-36, Air Mobility and Sealift Operations, or Air Force
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-4.4, Contingency Airfield
Operations).
The JP 3-36 definition of SAA does not assign authority and is often open to 
interpretation. It is important that a command relationship is determined among 
SAA, BOS-I, and tenant units using the airfield to streamline funding and logistics 
support channels and ensure the airfield operating surfaces are deconflicted from 
the life-support area. The SAA controls airfield access and coordinates for airfield 
security with the base commander, base cluster commander, or joint security 
coordinator for the area (if a base commander has not been designated). 
To enhance combat effectiveness and operational efficiency, SAA staff 
planners should define expectations of the supporting units and for the supported 
units. Other details should be discussed; including administrative and operational 
responsibilities for supported and supporting units, identification of resource 
requirements, and allocation of available resources. 
During the planning process, the SAA and staff will ensure the proper 
personnel, equipment, and support are coordinated to execute the mission.

Whether conducting deliberate or crisis action planning, the SAA will assign 
operational planning team (OPT) members to higher headquarters (HHQ) OPTs. 
These OPTs also may convene their own OPTs to plan personnel, equipment, 
and supplies deployment, build up the site capacity, and conduct sustained 
airfield operations. 
Sites established on a host nation (HN) airbase or airport will require detailed 
coordination with the HN airbase commander, or site commander, and 
appropriate civil aviation authority. The SAA will coordinate airfield support, real 
estate management, and other airbase support with the authority who is 
responsible for the airbase. The SAA will evaluate the level of support and 
services provided by the HN airbase commander and identify shortfalls or 
deficiencies to HHQ. 
Note: The USMC uses the term site commander in lieu of base commander (per Marine 
Corps Reference Publication (MCRP) 3-20F.3, MAGTF Aviation Site Command 
Handbook). This publication will use base commander exclusively with the 
understanding the USMC uses site commander for an air facility.
Upon arrival, the SAA begins to assume the position’s responsibilities from 
the airfield seizure force commander, but must coordinate with the airfield seizure 
force commander during planning and establishment of airfield operations. SAA 
transition is particularly challenging if not preplanned or executed early in base 
build-up. Coordination of expeditionary airbase build up between key personnel 
of the airfield seizure force, SAA organization, and tenant commands at the 
airfield will improve the pace of the buildup and the safety and efficiency of 
airfield operations. 
The BOS-I acts as the joint base operating support (BOS) or base operating 
support service provider. The Service component with the preponderance of forces 
at a base should provide the BOS-I. A CCDR may designate an individual within a 
Service component or JTF as the BOS-I at each operating location. The BOS-I 
coordinates using mission support resources efficiently. Where shortfalls or 
opportunities for efficiencies exist, the CCDR may task JTF components to provide 
or coordinate specific capabilities (e.g., infrastructure or installation security 
communications). The BOS-I conducts master planning for facilities and real estate. 
BOS-I responsibilities may include collecting and prioritizing construction 
requirements, seeking funding support, environmental management, emergency 
management, FP, facility use, and hazardous waste management. 
 Communications integration requires both BOS-I and SAA coordination to
integrate all communication services and capabilities at a designated airbase or 
airfield. See table 1 for a list of communications integration considerations.
The BOS-I and SAA have an important interaction. In many cases, the CCDR will 
designate a BOS-I and SAA from different Services at the same location (e.g., a 
common practice is to designate BOS-I responsibilities to the Army component while 
designating SAA responsibilities to the Air Force component). The BOS-I is the joint 
BOS provider for the operating location or base and the SAA is responsible for
0$5

5 
airfield control, operation, and maintenance including runways, associated taxiways 
and parking ramps, and land and facilities affecting airfield operations. As such, the 
SAA will perform many BOS functions on the facilities immediately surrounding the 
airfield. The BOS-I and SAA should closely coordinate along this seam during 
operations planning and execution. A common solution is to form an agreed-upon 
boundary line around the airfield and designate the SAA responsibility for the area 
inside the line and the BOS-I responsibility for the area outside the line. Refer to 
table 1 for an overview of airfield responsibilities.

4. Mission Analysis
Operations that require airfield openings can range from combat operations in a
hostile environment to emergency, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief
missions conducted in a permissive environment. An airfield opening can be nested
as part of a larger mission or as a staging point for follow-on operations. Opening an
airfield supports the JFC’s broad mission. An understanding of how the airfield
opening process will align within the larger mission for the joint force is critical for
mission planners. When conducting humanitarian assistance/disaster relief
missions, contact the US defense attaché liaison officer of the supported country to
gain situational awareness early in the planning process.
Planners, at all levels, contribute to mission analysis. It is imperative that all 
required functional leads are involved in mission planning from the outset, including 
6 
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
the Army rapid port opening element (RPOE) unit, Army theater airfield operations
group (TAOG), Army airfield operations battalion (AOB), Air Force CRFs, Air Force 
Special Operations Command special tactics squadron (STS), Marine air-ground 
task force (MAGTF) planners, humanitarian assistance rapid response team, 
supported combatant command planners, and the Air Force forces staff. Sharing 
critical information will help clarify implied tasks, assess mission risks, and develop 
alternative courses of action.
During a mission analysis, planners examine the mission, available assets, facts, 
and assumptions to determine the specified and implied tasks. Airfield openings are 
a component of larger missions or major operations. Therefore, planning for an 
airfield opening should be integrated with planning the larger mission or major 
operation. This can be accomplished by providing liaison officers to the 
headquarters that is planning the major operation or using electronic collaborative 
planning tools and systems to connect that organization. Including airfield planners 
early in the process provides sufficient time to perform surveys of the existing airfield 
and identify resources (e.g., real estate, materials, equipment, personnel, funding, 
time) required to construct an airfield expediently. In addition, it will ensure planners 
identify appropriate airfield capabilities to meet the JFC’s requirements for deploying 
forces and providing combat support and sustainment. 
Integrating airfield operation planners from the commencement of planning helps 
the JFC and staff identify requirements associated with establishing and operating 
an airfield while sufficient time remains to coordinate resources to match identified 
requirements. These include the following: 
Develop a task-organized force deployment package for an airfield opening. 
Develop estimates of airfield capabilities and requirements to provide 
requisite support to tenants and designated forces. 
(a) Identify maximum (aircraft) on ground (MOG).
(b) Identify the aircraft parking plan and movement area.
(c) Identify the cargo throughput capacity (e.g., consider size, locations,
storage area security, and material handling equipment available or required).
(d) Identify survey requirements (LZ, drop zone [DZ], hot pit refueling,
hazardous cargo, forward arming and refueling point [FARP], UAS).
Provide equipment and manning required for airfield operation. 
(a) Identify notice to air mission (NOTAM) procedures in accordance with
governing regulations in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-208/ Army Regulation
(AR) 95-10/ Chief of Naval Operations Instruction (OPNAVINST) 3721.20E,
Department of Defense Notice to Air Mission System.
(b) Contact the Department of Defense Notice to Air Mission Office via DSN
510-422-4757 or COM 540-422-4752 for additional information or issue
resolution.
Coordinate inter-Service and interagency communication.

Establish priorities of work for airfield opening.
Identify activities that can be conducted with airfield seizure and airfield 
opening.
The four primary phases of airfield opening include the following:
Phase I, Seize the Airfield. The United States Army, United States Marine 
Corps, and special operations forces (SOF) may conduct an airfield seizure by a 
ground, air-land, or airdrop method of maneuver.
Phase II, Open the Runway. The runway is open when: 
(a) The first (subsequent) aircraft has been cleared to land.
(b) The runway that aircraft will use is approved for use.
(c) All taxiways that aircraft will use are approved for use.
(d) All ramps that aircraft will use are approved for use.
(e) The airfield is secure and capable of supporting operations.
Phase III, Open the Airfield. The airfield is open when sufficient ramps,
taxiways, and facilities can support operational mission. 
Phase IV, Open the Airbase. The transition from an airfield to an airbase 
occurs, and an airbase is open when sufficient secure space exists to allow 
combat and combat support forces to bed down. The task is complete once 
forces are in place to extend, and subsequently replace, the initial open–the-
airbase force capability. A checklist with factors to consider during mission 
planning is included in appendix A.
5. Joint Task Force-Port Opening (JTF-PO)
Although all Services have the organic capability to execute theater-opening
functions, traditional service port opening and operating forces may not be sufficient
in situations that require rapid response or joint integration. The USTRANSCOM
JTF-PO aerial port of debarkation (APOD) provides the supported CCDR with a
rapid assessment of potential aerial ports and their distribution infrastructures. It also
provides a port opening capability to facilitate crisis response in established or
austere environments. The JTF-PO’s mission is to be in place in advance of a force
deployment or arrival of sustainment, humanitarian, or relief supplies.
JTF-PO is a scalable joint expeditionary capability that enables USTRANSCOM to
rapidly establish, operate, and clear a port of debarkation (POD). Additionally, JTF-
PO forces can conduct cargo-handling operations to a forward distribution node and
facilitate port throughput in support of a CCDR-executed contingency.
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) can deploy a rapid-deployment team (RDT) with
JTF-PO forces, if necessary, to support the JFC with expeditionary contracting
capability and expertise. DLA can leverage existing strategic-level contracts within
the theater, to support the JFC or help establish provisional contracts to support
mission requirements. DLA’s primary mission is to assist in establishing theater
openings and facilitate distribution operations beyond the forward node (FN).
8 
The Commander, USTRANSCOM has the authority to deploy a JTF-PO in direct 
support of the supported CCDR (as authorized in the Unified Command Plan and 
Secretary of Defense standing execute order). For more information on JTF-PO, see 
appendix I.
6. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Considerations
Commanders, across the Services, should determine the ATC capabilities and
required forces, arrival sequence, and HN and adjacent nation restrictions to plan
ATC operations. The aircraft control authority will need expertise from Service ATC
representatives and HN liaison elements for coordination with all relevant agencies.
Consider the following critical factors during the planning phase to enable effective
ATC services.
Plan for the full range of ATC operations to support deliberate and crisis 
action planning for deploying, employing, sustaining, and redeploying forces. 
Specifically, consider the following: 
D Length of the operation.
E Size of the airbase (e.g., forward operating base, main airbase, air facility,
air site, and air point).
F Complexity of the area (e.g., the mixture and volume of existing civilian
structures, services, NAVAIDS, and runways’ condition).
G Type and density of traffic (e.g., rotary-wing (RW), fixed-wing (FW)
unmanned aircraft operations).
H Primary users (e.g., SOF, fighters, cargo transporters, other governmental
agencies, coalition forces, or humanitarians).
I
Type of service.
x Instrument flight rules (IFR) and visual flight rules (VFR).
x Radar or non-radar.
x Terminal.
x Single or multiple precision or non-precision approaches.
x En route control.
J Personnel requirements (e.g., qualifications, liaisons, and translators).
K Equipment reliability, back-up capability, and connectivity.
L
Disposition of base (e.g., a base that transitions to different use with
different Service and equipment requirements).
M
Environment (e.g., permissive, nonpermissive, terrain, climatology, visual
or instrument meteorological conditions, winds, temperature, or density
altitude).
N Threats and FP.

(l) Interface between terminal and en route ATC systems.
(m) Base operations support (e.g., power, supply, maintenance, billeting,
medical, and provisions).
(n) Aircraft operation restrictions near munitions storage.
(o) Frequency requirements for radio, radar, and NAVAIDS.
(p) Airfield lighting and marking requirements.
(q) Ensuring the initial plan considers transition procedures that will be
required to transition the ATC back to the HN or another agency.
Coordinate HN integration of the civil ATC system, including agreements for 
national and international air traffic coordination and negotiation of international-
level agreements.
Coordinate with adjacent command and control (C2) agencies to establish 
procedures for control hand-offs, reference points, and ATC sharing. Use letters 
of agreement or memoranda of understanding to record airspace management 
and control decisions.
Collaborate with the joint air operations center or CAOC combat plans 
division to integrate airspace design into the development of the ATC plan. 
Coordinate TERPS reviews for theater airfields. Review preexisting HN or 
commercial instrument procedures for Department of Defense (DoD) approval.
Coordinate flight inspections, as required. If instrument NAVAIDS and IFR 
procedures are necessary to meet mission objectives, the following two areas 
are required:
(a) TERPS specialists (Marine, Army, and Air Force) participate, when
warranted or requested, in initial NAVAID site surveys. TERPS specialists
provide recommendations regarding siting deployable NAVAIDS used in
developing instrument procedures and can forward site survey data to the
appropriate HHQ TERPS office that is responsible for the operational area.
Authorization to use the procedures remains with the appropriate flying
operations authority and the commander exercising operational control
(OPCON) of the aircraft. If possible, a flight inspection should be scheduled.
Flight inspections specify required obstruction clearances and verify the
performance of air navigation services and ensures their instrument flight
procedures conform to prescribed standards documented in the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), DoD, and Annex 10 of the Convention on
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) directives. Per Service
regulations, flight inspections must be performed during daylight hours and
require visual meteorological conditions. Inspecting a single NAVAID takes
half a day and as few as one sortie to complete.
(b) Flight inspection methods incur varying risks for the commander. The
following four options are available to the joint force air component
commander (JFACC) listed from high to low risk.

0$5
x Option 1, Approval without FAA Flight Inspection. Theater
commanders have the final authority and responsibility for
accomplishing their mission. If the military situation dictates and a
Service allows using an installed NAVAID and approach without a flight
inspection, this authorization is restricted to aircraft under the individual
Service approval authority’s OPCON will be annotated with specific
flying units use only (e.g., “For Use By [specific unit] Aircraft Only”).
x Option 2, Military Contingency Flight Inspection. The appropriate
flying operations authority and theater commander exercising OPCON
of the aircraft may approve an abbreviated flight inspection for radar
approaches and certain new instrument procedures in accordance with
chapter 24 of FAA Order 8200.1D, United States Standard Flight
Inspection Manual (also identified as Technical Manual [TM] 95-225,
Naval Air Systems Command [NAVAIR] 16-1-520, and Air Force
Manual [AFMAN] 11-225). This inspection allows a theater commander
to have temporary IFR capability for aircraft under the direction of the
JFC.
x Option 3, Restricted Facility Commissioning. This inspection certifies
the NAVAID and instrument approach using normal procedures to
support a minimal number of IFR approach procedures in accordance
with FAA Order 8200.1D/TM 95-225/NAVAIR 16-1-520/NAVAIR 00-
80T-114/AFMAN 11-225. The restricted facility commissioning
inspection permits use by any aircraft. Areas evaluated as acceptable
are certified for use, and the remaining areas and procedures are
restricted. The local (deployed) airspace officer or ATC manager will
publish the restrictions in a Notice to Airmen.
x Option 4, Normal Commissioning. This is the full certification of all
procedures (i.e., arrival, approach, and departure) and areas of
NAVAID coverage in accordance with FAA Order 8200.1D/TM 95-
225/NAVAIR 16-1-520/NAVAIR 00-80T-114/AFMAN 11-225. Each
Service will submit all instrument procedure certifications through the
appropriate chain of command. Once complete, the procedures and
airspace are certified to support all aircraft (i.e., DoD, civil, HN,
coalition forces, etc.) including aircraft transiting through en route
airspace.

AIRFIELD ASSESSMENT AND SURVEYS
Ecuador Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief
“In Ecuador, the host nation advocated for the mobile tower to be placed at a 
location specifically decided upon for convenience. The airfield systems’ 
maintainers emphasized the potential limitations of the equipment in that 
location, but were outranked in the decision. The convenient location did not 
allow for suitable communication with the inbound aircraft and ultimately was 
relocated to the maintainers’ originally advised location.”
—Technical Sergeant Nicholas Lossett, United States Air Force, 
Airfield Systems Technician, April 2016
1. Overview
When tasked by USTRANSCOM or the supported CCDR, assessors perform airfield 
assessments prior to an airfield opening. They may perform additional assessments for 
unfamiliar airfields, damaged airfields, or any time a large contingent of follow-on forces 
is expected. Planners have many tools available to conduct an airfield assessment 
remotely; but, usually, an in-person assessment is necessary. Although similar, airfield 
assessments and non-geodetic surveys occur at separate times and serve separate 
purposes. The terms airfield survey and assessment are sometimes used 
interchangeably. Surveys and assessments support two distinctly separate missions. 
The following paragraphs describe the different actions that support assessments 
versus surveys. 
An airfield assessment focuses on identifying and overcoming the impediments to 
the mission. An airfield assessment may occur in permissive or uncertain 
environments. Timing for an assessment is immediately following an unopposed 
entry (permissive) or after an airfield seizure by the joint force (uncertain). 
An assessment should validate or determine the suitability of a designated 
airfield for a pending air mission, in support of an actual contingency, or for other 
airfield assessment requirements designated by the tasking authority. Critical 
assessment aspects include airfield capabilities, limitations, air movement
facilities available, and obstruction clearance in the departure and arrival areas. 
Planners will need to consider runway characteristics and taxiway, parking, ramp, 
and cargo handling areas for operational suitability, and determine MOG 
limitations. See JP 3-36 for more information. 
The airfield assessment should be done as early as possible to verify 
information and to identify additional requirements. Report results back through 
secure, dependable, long-range communications, as directed, through command
channels. It will provide a recommendation on the suitability of future airfield 
operations to decision makers.
 A non-geodetic airfield survey provides data for the Global Decision Support 
System (GDSS) airfield database. See paragraph 7d for more information on GDSS
access. This survey is conducted in a permissive environment. This survey is a 
12
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
physical investigation of a location, conducted for gathering data to support planned 
or possible contingency operations. The historical data provides the foundation for 
future assessment team airfield evaluations conducted in response to an actual 
contingency. Considerations for site surveys include the following: 
Determine the feasibility of a location for planned operations.
Validate information about equipment, terrain, HN resources, commercially 
available capabilities, and infrastructure (such as serviceability, availability, and 
compatibility).
Gather critical information and facilitate planning for future operations.
2. Airfield Assessment and Survey Teams
Airfield assessment teams, specifically trained to conduct a rapid airfield evaluation, 
execute airfield assessments enabling commanders to make airfield suitability 
decisions. The assessment team may be composed of coalition, single-Service, or 
multi-Service personnel; intergovernmental or NGOs; or civilian representatives. The 
following are some of the most common assessment teams: 
SOF. The composition varies, but it often consists of Air Force combat controllers 
assigned to a special tactics team (STT). Combat controllers survey and establish 
airfields in austere or hostile areas while providing ATC to land aircraft during 
combat and humanitarian missions. (ALSB 2016-2, p. 18) STTs can conduct LZ and 
DZ surveys and complete an AF Form 1174 (Airfield Survey). 
Marine Expeditionary Forces. Marine expeditionary forces can conduct LZ and 
pavement surveys or assessments. A survey team is task organized to meet the 
mission requirement. Marine airfield survey teams are trained and equipped to 
assess the capabilities of an airfield and its supporting facilities. They relay that 
information to authorities who deploy any needed augmentation or engineer forces.
A team usually consists of three to five personnel trained to conduct LZ and airfield 
assessments. Marines who have received an airfield pavement evaluation (APE) 
training course certification also can conduct pavement surveys. Teams typically 
consist of air traffic controllers, expeditionary airfield Marines, and engineers. The 
Marine expeditionary forces’ airfield survey team can produce an expedient 
pavement evaluation and a formal assessment report within 24 hours to assist in 
command-level go/no-go decisions.
The USAF 7E1AM. This team can produce an expedient pavement evaluation and 
a formal assessment report within 24 hours to assist in command-level go/no-go 
decisions.
Personnel. This team is composed of eight Air Force CRF personnel, 
including a rated officer, airfield operations officer or airfield manager, civil 
engineers, a communications noncommissioned officer (NCO), a security forces 
NCO, and a mission-dependent specialty. 
Equipment. The team’s equipment includes two high mobility multipurpose 
wheeled vehicles, two all-terrain vehicles, very high frequency and ultrahigh 
0$5

frequency capable radios, and satellite communications equipment capable of 
supporting the team for 72 hours. 
Deployment Methods. The team delivery may occur by FW, RW, or convoy 
insertion methods. 
The USAF 7E1AK. This is an airborne assessment team consisting of 12 Air 
Force CRF personnel capable of FW or RW air-land infiltration and airdrop or 
overland employment into a bare-base location. The 7E1AK includes a 7E1AM 
team, ATC, medical, and logistics readiness personnel.
The USAF 7E1AP. This airfield assessment team conducts worldwide airfield and 
site assessments to evaluate airfield capabilities in support of air mobility operations.
Personnel. This team is composed of eight Air Force CRF personnel, 
including civil engineers, airfield management, fuels, materiel management, 
contracting, and a security forces NCO. 
Equipment. The team’s equipment includes hand-carried items specific to the 
team’s functional areas used during the survey.
Deployment Methods. The team delivery may occur by FW, RW, sealift, or 
convoy insertion methods.
The Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) APE team (4F9AD). This APE team 
conducts worldwide contingency, sustainment, and permanent level APEs. The team 
uses destructive and nondestructive techniques to evaluate or assess pavement 
weight bearing capacity and surface conditions. Additionally, the team can proof load 
high-capacity aircraft anchoring systems, determine runway surface friction 
characteristics, and provide technical expertise and guidance to design, repair, and 
construct airfield pavements in support of regional conflict operations. Taskings 
support contingency operating locations, aerial ports, en route bases, or critical 
stateside bases including humanitarian relief operations. This team also conducts 
the Contingency Airfield Pavement Evaluation Training Course and certifies DoD 
evaluators. 
Personnel. This team is composed of four Air Force civil engineering 
personnel assigned to the AFCEC. 
Equipment. The team’s equipment includes specialized rolling stock (i.e., 
heavy weight deflectors, automated dynamic cone penetrometers, continuous 
friction measurement equipment, and anchor testing kit components). 
Deployment Methods. The team’s equipment is C-130/C-17 air transportable
or delivery may occur via sealift or convoy insertion methods.
JTF-PO Assessments.
The joint assessment team’s (JAT’s) mission is to evaluate all aspects of 
opening deployment and distribution networks. Its two-fold purpose is to gather 
information to determine if the airfield and distribution infrastructure are capable 
of supporting the mission, and determine the availability of resources to 
14
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
accomplish JTF-PO assigned tasks. See appendix B for an example of the 
airfield assessment and survey checklists. 
Mission analysis for the JAT requires coordination between the air element 
and surface element, with the HN or seizure forces prior to JAT arrival. At a 
minimum, JAT planners should know the expected airflow, type of cargo, delivery 
mode to the FN, and operational environment.
The JAT assessment should emphasize specific areas, including joint aerial 
port or marshalling area operations; logistics, work and living spaces, ramp and 
transportation route security; and access to, and capabilities of, forward 
distribution areas.
The JAT consists of eight Air Force personnel (i.e., seven core members 
from 7E1AM and one augmentee), and four Army personnel (i.e., three core
members from RPOE and one augmentee). Members from DLA’s assessment 
team may accompany the JAT, as the mission dictates. See appendix I for 
additional JTF-PO JAT capabilities.  
The go/no-go recommendation by the JAT is a leadership decision made 
after the initial assessment, to determine: 
(a) If the APOD can handle the distribution mission.
(b) If augmentation is required before operations can commence (i.e.,
additional security, runway repair, etc.).
(c) If additional time is needed before a decision can be made. The JAT must
provide Commander, USTRANSCOM, through the deployment and
distribution operations center, the go/no-go decision within 4 hours.
3. Assessment Considerations
Upon arrival, assessment team personnel should meet with representatives of the
airfield seizure forces (if applicable), HN personnel, or designated representatives to
discuss local operating conditions, area security, and the likelihood of the airfield
supporting the intended mission. In a permissive environment, the assessment
activity coordination should occur through the defense attaché officer at the
appropriate US embassy or NGO representatives.
Appendix B depicts sample checklist items for airfield assessments. Teams
should consider each listed item to assess airfield suitability. In addition to checklist
items, teams should also consider assessing operations in support of the following:
Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC). Emphasis includes space available for 
medical treatment facilities, patient staging areas, and FW or RW patient loading 
areas.
Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief. Emphasis areas include personnel 
staging areas, cargo hold areas, and interagency coordination.
Helicopter Operations. Emphasis areas include designated clear zones, 
FARP placement, and helicopter LZ placement.
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
15
UAS. Emphasis areas include potential UAS LZs, user requirements, and 
ATC deconfliction plan. 
Fire Missions. Emphasis areas include potential launch sites, user 
requirements, and ATC deconfliction procedures. Fire missions includes artillery, 
rockets, mortars, etc.
Explosives Storage. Emphasis areas include potential locations for storage of 
unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) and munitions.  
Encampment. 
The go/no-go priorities of the assessment team depend on mission objectives and
the condition of the airfield. The primary mission of the assessment team is to 
conduct airfield site assessments of austere or established airfields for imminent air 
operations. However, the assessment team also may evaluate and report the status 
of organic communications, facilities, fuels, pavement, FP, ATC, and overall airfield 
condition or suitability while establishing a minimum operating strip. If intended for 
use by air refueling tanker aircraft, the assessment team should factor in the ability 
to provide large volumes of fuel required for that operation.
The following are some examples of airfield assessment priorities: 
Complete the assessment within 4 hours and provide a go/no-go
recommendation and provide a detailed survey within 24 hours.
Capture airfield capabilities and assist in collecting and validating 
information, including airfield suitability.
Evaluate the airfield’s pavement.
Establish a minimum operating strip based on mission aircraft. 
Assume SAA. Complete the “runway open” phase of the initial airbase 
opening operations.
Determine the capability and suitability of a forward operating location to 
support airfield operations and combat airpower sustainment.
Make an overall force bed down assessment, including real estate available.
Establish site bed down for airfield opening personnel, receive each 
personnel chalk, and provide an initial briefing to arriving personnel.
Make a full-spectrum threat assessment, including airfield and airbase 
security, enemy activity or intelligence threats, terrorist threats, UXO hazards, 
health threats, and environmental threats.
Once completed, report assessment team findings through secure, long-
range communications as directed through appropriate command channels. 
Provide a recommendation to appropriate decision makers on the suitability 
for intended airfield operations as soon as possible.

the CRF commander met up with elements of United States Marine Corps 
(USMC) Combat Logistics Regiment 4. CRF and USMC cross-Services 
efficiencies were immediately identified to facilitate operating in and around 
Tacloban. It was quickly determined that CRF’s focus would be airfield 
operations, and CLR-4 elements’ focus would be establishment of operational 
water purification units, the distribution of relief supplies beyond the confines of 
the airport, and oversight of bed down locations for follow-on forces. Moreover, 
the USMC G-4 at Tacloban conveyed that they would coordinate all resupply 
requirements for CRF and USMC through the chain of command.

personnel with associated training accomplish this type of 
survey to support austere, unimproved landing strips, and may 
include an entire airfield that has unique issues. These issues 
can include missing navigation aids, insufficient lighting, or 
obstacles, that prevent it from operating as an LZ. Air mobility 
division tactics is the office of primary responsibility for LZ 
suitability issues. The 53rd Air Traffic Control Squadron has an 
AFSOC approved course to teach landing zone surveys. See 
Air Mobility Command (AMC) zone availability report (ZAR) or 
Talon Point for LZ/DZ information. 
Drop Zone (DZ)
A DZ-certified person performs a comprehensive site survey to 
certify a location to support DZ operations. See AMC ZAR or 
Talon Point for LZ/DZ information. 
AF Form 1174
(Airfield Survey)
An AF airfield survey is a two-part document that recommends
suitability of an airfield for operations of aircraft. Part 1, Airfield 
Data, provides specific information on the physical capability of 
the airfield to handle air mobility aircraft. Part II, Airfield 
Support,  is a checklist designed to provide information to 
determine if the airfield has the facilities to support air mobility 
operations. 
Deployable Air 
Traffic Control and 
Landing System 
(DATCALS)
A DATCALS survey is a siting (placement and setup) function. 
It involves selecting the appropriate location for the DATCALS 
and gathering foundational data required to support terminal 
instrument procedures (TERPS) design and flight inspections.

Expeditionary Site 
Survey Process 
This is predominately a United States Air Force base operating 
support-integrator (BOS-I) survey process used for 
expeditionary site planning. It is an installation survey that 
looks at all facets of an installation, to including: supply, 
logistics, maintenance, operations, infrastructure, etc. The 
survey is published in a multiple chapter document which 
resides within the base support and expeditionary (BaS&E) 
database, and is supposed to be updated any time its content 
is changed through any survey process. Refer to Air Force 
Instruction (AFI) 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site 
Planning, for more details.
Contingency Site

This is predominately a United States Army survey process 
used for contingency site planning of Army Aviation forces. 
This survey documents similar items found within an 
Expeditionary Site Survey Process documented above. 
Additionally, the CSP will detail Aviation Task Force apron 
utilization and rotary wing parking support plans.
Airfield Geodetic 
Survey 
The primary source for the Department of Defense airfield 
survey is the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Office of 
Geomatics. This office is responsible for gathering aeronautical 
data through various means including conducting geodetic 
airfield surveys and managing the terminal aeronautical global 
navigation satellite system (GNSS) Geodetic Survey Program. 
This program provides ground truth surveyed coordinates and 
elevations for the aerodrome, including the runways, 
navigation aids, vertical obstructions, and ground-control 
points. This information provides highly accurate, geodetic 
coordinates, and elevations critical to flight safety. It also 
ensures a common geodetic frame of reference (i.e., WGS-84) 
for all air operations on an international scale. The aeronautical 
data collected during this geodetic survey is used for 
publishing airfield diagrams, developing terminal instrument 
procedures, and evaluating the airport imaginary surfaces for 
possible navigational hazards.

Airfield Obstruction Charts. These are physical or digital analyses of obstacles on 
or near runways to determine if those obstructions pose a hazard to air navigation. 
They support waiver package development and validation. Find the published results 
on the applicable civil engineer map, if available or published.
6. Publishing Airfield Data
Multiple databases containing key airfield information currently exist. The airfield
assessment or survey tasking authority must ensure an appropriate C2 entity is
designated for collecting and disseminating airfield data. Additionally, identification of
a primary database is essential to preclude data conflicts.
Review, update, and validate contingency airfield data weekly.
7. Airfield Assessments for Mobility Aircraft
The SAA must ensure prompt transmission of airfield assessment information to
the Director of Mobility Forces and Headquarters AMC. AMC, on behalf of
USTRANSCOM, maintains a continuously updated global database of airfield
information. This global airfield database is contained in AMC’s mission
management and planning system, the GDSS.
AMC accomplishes destination airport suitability analysis to build and maintain the
GDSS airfield database used by all Services. AMC airfield suitability assessments,
also called “Giant Reports,” are maintained in the GDSS airfield database. USAF
major command TERPS reviews are included in AMC Giant Reports, as appropriate.
AMC planners and crews review and adhere to guidance outlined in the Giant
Report when doing feasibility studies and mission planning.
The airfield assessment team must ensure prompt transmission of airfield
infrastructure information to AMC Airfield Suitability (AMC/A3AS) after arrival if
mobility aircraft operations are required. Refer to the GDSS airfield database to
determine suitability for mobility aircraft (i.e., C-5, C-17, C-20, C-21, C-32, C-710 37,
C-40, C-130, KC-10, KC-46, and KC-135). Contact AMC/A3AS to provide data or
request an airfield evaluation addition to the GDSS airfield database. Write to:

OPENING AN AIRFIELD
Joint Task Force-Port Opening (JTF-PO) Operations in Haiti (2010) 
“A couple of hours after the joint assessment team (JAT) landed in Haiti in 
support of hurricane relief, the JTF-PO commander and main body arrived on 
five C-17s. The team immediately began coordinating bed down and operations 
efforts with the JAT, special operations forces (SOF), controllers, special tactics 
teams, and Soldiers from the 688th rapid port opening element. On the periphery 
of the busy airfield, the 26-man security force (SF) team set up a layered defense 
of the damaged perimeter. Due to the size of the airfield and number of people 
living in close proximity to the airfield, it became apparent that more SF 
assistance was needed. On 24 January, a squadron of SF Airmen from the 820th 
Base Defense Group arrived and began working alongside the JTF-PO 
defenders to secure the airfield.
The JTF-PO brought order to the parking area by controlling the flow of aircraft. A 
contingency response group maintenance crew chief was assigned to the SOF 
special tactics teams and directed aircraft ground and air traffic. Within a day, this 
logistical solution doubled the number of aircraft transiting the airfield. Due to the 
myriad of aircraft supporting the relief effort and a lack of compatible ground 
handling equipment, foreign aircraft were often unloaded by hand.” 
—MAJ Armando Velasquez, 
690th RPOE Commander, 2010
1. Overview
Integrate subject matter expert (SME) planners into the process as early as possible 
when developing and rehearsing operations that may include an airfield opening. The 
planning process must incorporate planners versed in the mission and aircraft expected 
to operate out of the opened airfield. Planning for an airfield opening begins at the 
strategic level of force assignment. The plan should address options for one of the three 
operational environments: permissive, uncertain, or hostile. Upon force assignment, 
detailed planning must occur coordinated with initial entry forces. CCDRs identify 
airfields for use and direct their staffs and subordinate commands to generate plans, 
based on whether the airfield is in a permissive, uncertain, or hostile environment. Once 
the plan has been finalized, the airbase will be seized or secured initiating the airfield 
opening process.
2. Planning Factors
Tailor airfield opening activities to the mission of the airfield and operations that
the airfield is supporting. Commanders must get a clear statement of priorities and
future intent from combatant and subordinate commands to ensure they shape the
airbase to those roles. In some cases, the JFACC may decide to use Agile Combat
Employment to operate off of airfields for periods of short duration. The following
offers insight and guidelines for such operations.
22
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
Airfield opening activities take place in four general phases. The phases are: 
Seize/Secure the Airfield, Runway Open, Airfield Open, and Airbase Open. The 
duration of airbase operations is critical in determining the level of development 
required for the facilities and capabilities. Operations lasting a few hours do not 
require the same activities that an enduring airfield will require. Tailor the plans to 
the duration of the mission. See figure 1 for the phases of airfield opening.  
Phases for Opening an Airfield
Different organizations will provide different capabilities. Each Service’s
capabilities are broken down in appendices E-H. Command of an airfield and 
command relationships will change based on the Services chosen to open an airfield 
and the unique capabilities and cultures each uses to accomplish this mission. Each 
Service has unique organizations and systems for opening an airfield, but the 
required tasks are fundamentally the same.
Airfield opening tasks can be broken into three general categories, airfield 
operations, airfield support, and airfield sustainment. The responsibility of these 
tasks will be divided between SAA and the BOS-I.
Airbase opening operations must consider the physical, human, political, cultural, 
and threat geography of where those opening the airfield will be working. An initial 
transfer could span between a friendly governmental or HN agency and a seizure 
force. 
In a permissive environment, forces may take responsibility for, or assume control 
of, the airfield (or portions of the airfield) as arranged with the HN or governmental 
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
23
agency. Coordination with the US embassy, HN, and local authorities is critical for 
mission success in this environment.
Some environments may require area or site seizure. Such operations may 
include airborne, amphibious, or air assault forces that should remain in place until 
relieved by airbase opening forces. Planners must ensure the airspace is managed 
and aircraft are controlled after landing (e.g., parking locations and taxiing control). 
This helps Services accomplish their tasks. Tailor requests for forces to the 
capabilities of these units as outlined in Service appendices. Special forces, 
pathfinders, and some others can be inserted ahead of the force as part of a joint 
airborne advance party; they can jump with the airborne assault or land with the first 
assault aircraft. Others will flow in behind the seizure force and replace or expand 
seizure force capabilities. 
SAA transfer to the oncoming force occurs after the oncoming force is capable of 
maintaining airfield security. Airfield opening planners should be involved with 
seizure planning to expedite this transfer.
After assuming control, the SAA is responsible for all airfield operations and 
coordinates area security requirements with the appropriate authorities. The SAA is 
responsible for assessing and validating the airfield and airfield-opening plan.
3. Command Relationships
Building Command Relationships. Military command relationships can be
complex. For example, OPCON of continental United States (CONUS)-based CRFs
remains with USTRANSCOM even when supporting another CCDR. Coordination
with the CCDR or HN also may be required to establish support and define mission
needs. Liaisons can help maintain communication.
Airfield Command and Sustainment. Command of airfield opening forces will vary
based on mission, forces, and time. The mission of the airbase will drive who retains
OPCON and tactical control (TACON). Short duration missions, with organic
support, will not drive the same command relationship as a JTF-PO shaping an
airbase for an enduring mission. The command relationships will change over time
as the mission matures. Key organizations include the combatant commands and
JTFs. Solidify command relationships early in the planning process and ensure they
are clearly defined in operation orders. Commanders must understand, they will
have to negotiate among all mission owners to develop a command relationship that
works for a specific mission. A thorough understanding of joint and Service
doctrines, use of liaisons, and regular joint training are valuable in developing a
command relationship in a compressed timeline.
OPCON. Operational control of forces will vary by mission duration and unit 
ownership. For example, for a FARP or raid mission, the unit’s commander may 
maintain OPCON. This holds true for missions lasting between 1–14 days. For 
missions lasting 14–60 days, the OPCON may transfer to a JTF or similar 
authority. Missions lasting more than 60 days, or missions originally planned to 
establish an enduring airbase, would fall under the JFACC for OPCON of the 
24
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
airfield opening forces. It is critical that the execute order clearly define supported 
and supporting commands. Verbal orders also should include these authorities. 
TACON. Tactical control delegation will occur per joint and Service doctrine. 
Critical to TACON considerations will be HN abilities and authorities. The 
authorities on airfield operations that the HN maintains may restrain the SAA’s 
authorities considerably. 
Sustainment. Sustainment is primarily the responsibility of the supported 
CCDR and subordinate Service component commander in close cooperation with 
Service, combat support agencies, and supporting commands (JP 4-0, Joint 
Logistics). In situations where a CCDR does not have administrative control, 
OPCON, or TACON of a force, the parent command should create an agreement 
with the CCDR for force sustainment, either through a memorandum or in the 
execute order. The on-scene commander will have to develop a positive working 
relationship with the combatant command’s logistics leadership and the forces 
driving them. Relationships are critical to overcoming unforeseen circumstances 
and dealing with high-visibility problems, like casualty reporting, where multiple 
commands will want to be informed and may have a specific process for an 
event’s resolution.
SAA. The exact delegation and sharing of authorities will depend on the situation 
and forces available. Plan the mission with a good breakout of authorities; but 
consider, the SAA may have to negotiate with interested parties once on the ground 
and gaining situational awareness of the ground truths. In situations where US 
forces are not the overarching authorities for airfield operations (e.g., the HN 
maintains airfield control, or it is an operational civil airfield), the SAA maintains 
oversight for all US or coalition airfield operations and, is the primary negotiator with 
the airfield officials for any support required. (See JP 3-36.)
The SAA is responsible for all aspects of airfield operations and should be 
allocated resources and personnel to conduct operations. Cooperative efforts of 
HN and coalition and joint forces may meet some or all of these needs. Request 
force augmentation or additional support, as required, to support air operations 
(i.e., ATC, civil engineer, BOS-I, etc.). The SAA should maintain TACON of any 
units conducting airfield operations, including STTs, Marine air traffic control 
mobile team (MMTs), Army tactical aviation control team (TACT), and Navy 
tactical air control squadron units while they operate on the SAA’s airfield. Due to 
the specialized nature of some of these units’ missions and the complexities of 
conventional forces having TACON of SOF forces, the SAA is encouraged to 
communicate command relationship needs to the CCDR. 
If dual-hatted as the base commander, the SAA has control and direction 
over base defense activities within the base boundary through the C2 
mechanism of the base defense operations center (BDOC). (See JP 3-10, Joint 
Security Operations in Theater.) The base commander, through the BDOC, 
addresses threats with attached forces within the designated base boundary, 
coordinates with the designated area commander(s) for additional support or 
forces, and (if required) requests joint fires within the base boundary. Within this 
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
25
context, clear lines of authority are required to ensure personnel and resource 
protection from ground-based and standoff attacks commensurate with the 
commander’s integrated base defense plan. (See JP 3-36.)
The SAA and BOS-I Relationship. The working relationship between SAA 
and BOS-I is critical to determining the success of an airbase opening. The BOS-
I and SAA should meet regularly to coordinate their activities. These meetings 
should be daily at the beginning of a mission and can be weekly as each gains 
an appreciation of the other’s mission and priorities. Whenever there is a change 
of SAA or BOS-I, execute daily meetings to establish a good relationship 
between the new leaders. Any parties with interests that affect SAA and BOS-I 
should attend these meetings (e.g., engineering, contracting, security, ATC, or
logistics).
Transition and Establish Authority. Ensure a positive transition of authority from 
seizure forces or integration with HN or existing authorities. Transferring 
responsibility should happen when the incoming force can meet or exceed the 
existing force’s capability. The SAA must establish a position in the local command 
structure.
Build HN Relationships. Navigating these relationships can be challenging and 
impact operations if not clearly understood. Build relationships with the local 
embassy, diplomats, or other HN officials (e.g. local community and business 
leaders) to facilitate coordination on concerns, such as overflight and access 
agreements or arrangements that suit the foreseeable period of operations. These 
relationships can also aid in assessing and addressing issues concerning ability of 
HN vendors to support airfield opening and subsequent operations with 
commercially available items, services, and minor construction. 
HN and SAA. In situations where the HN retains control of the airfield, it still may
be desirable to appoint an SAA. The SAA must have a good working relationship 
with HN airfield managers that is built on trust and expertise. The SAA is responsible 
for coordinating all US military flight operations and movement procedures, and 
becomes the single clearinghouse between the HN airfield managers and any US 
military airfield users. All US military operations on the airfield and any 
improvements or changes to the airfield should be coordinated through the SAA and 
transmitted to the HN airfield manager to ensure HN buy in and approval. 
“When I stepped off the aircraft at Port-au-Prince [Haiti] there was no one there 
who knew we were coming. I immediately asked for directions to the office of the 
airport manager and then began introducing myself as the JTF-PO [joint task 
force-port opening] airfield management and ATC [air traffic control] expert at 
every office I walked past until I was taken to the Chief of Airfield Operations’ 
office. Once there, we sat down and started talking about how we should work 
together. From then on, I informed him and his offices everything that was 
happening on the airfield.”

Partner Service Mobility Liaisons.
Air mobility liaison officers (AMLOs) are rated USAF mobility air forces 
officers selected, trained, and equipped to assess, train, advise, and assist 
mobility air forces and ground force integration for air movement and 
sustainment. They integrate with supported joint force component staff functions 
at the echelons that make decisions for air movement and sustainment planning, 
validation, prioritization, preparation, and execution. AMLOs are organized to 
advise ground force commanders on air mobility issues and are granted
coordinating and direct liaison authority to provide essential coordination and 
enhance the interoperability between the global mobility enterprise, supported 
combatant commands, joint force partners, and other authorized mobility users in 
garrison and forward deployed. AMC’s AMLOs are forces assigned to 
USTRANSCOM. The Air Force transportation component retains OPCON, and 
the CRW has administrative control responsibility.
Ground liaison officers (GLOs) are US Army liaison representatives assigned 
to contingency response organizations in support of air mobility operations. 
GLOs provide Army expertise to Air Force organizations by analyzing and 
briefing the ground tactical situation to contingency response personnel before 
and during operations.
4. Functions
Airfield Operations. Airfield operation forces, during expeditionary military
operations, require tactical-level procedures to provide a unity of effort supporting
the JFC. Integrate air assets from across the Services to achieve operational
success. The following paragraphs serve as guides to execute airfield operations.
See appendix C for an airfield operations checklist.
Airfield Systems. Responsibilities include all radar, NAVAIDs, weather, ATC 
C2 radios, telecomm infrastructure, spectrum management, arresting gear, and 
lighting systems. This function must be scalable from small footprint to large 
equipment requirements to meet the specific airfield mission.
Airfield Management. Airfield managers’ survey or assess airfield conditions 
to determine suitability for future aircraft operations. Managers develop aircraft 
parking plans and determine parking MOGs. For detailed information refer to 
appendix K or the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport 
Planning and Design. The following are airfield layout considerations: 
(a) Runways.
x Consider the type of runway surface available for the required
mission, such as unprepared or semi-prepared surfaces (e.g., grass,
dirt, and matting) or prepared surfaces (e.g., asphalt or concrete).
x Assess the weight-bearing capacity and surface conditions required
on a continual basis. These should be based on the type of required
aircraft.
0$5 
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
27 
x Periodically, engineers should assess the runway to determine its
capacity and feasibility for sustained operations.
x Conduct runway inspections daily to ensure a safe airfield
environment.
(b) Taxiways. Ensure proper control procedures exist for ground aircraft
movement and deconfliction. Update procedures as taxiways are opened or
become available.
(c) Ramp Parking. Consider the size of the parking area in relation to the
number of required aircraft. Coordinate, establish, and publish an aircraft
parking plan.
x MOG.
x Working MOG. Determine how many aircraft can be loaded, receive
maintenance, or refueled simultaneously.
x Parking MOG. Determine how much physical space is available by
size and type of aircraft.
(d) Hazard Area. Identify and mark hazards.
(e) Crossing Areas. Coordinate with the airfield manager and ATC to
establish crossing procedures for runway and perimeter roads.
(f) Frangibility and Clear Zones or Areas. Review and establish criteria based
on mission requirements.
(g) Lighting or Approach Systems. Establish runway, taxiway, ramp lighting,
marking, NAVAIDS, and approach systems based on mission requirements.
(h) Emergency Landing Surface Operations. Airfield operations may
experience loss of the primary landing surface due to an unplanned event
(e.g., dual barrier engagement or enemy action). Develop emergency landing
surface procedures to ensure there are continuous airfield operations
supporting the joint force.
(i) Considerations for using a taxiway as an alternate runway:
x Obtain the appropriate command approval.
x Coordinate with airfield management and the tower supervisor.
x Move all arming and de-arming areas at least 100 feet from the
alternate runway.
x Have ground control direct taxiing aircraft to clear the taxiway and
hold all others in parking areas.
x Visually, ensure the taxiway is clear.
x This is only for daylight operations or time-critical missions.
x The taxiway is only for straight-in approaches.
28
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
x There may be a displaced threshold.
x There may be obstructions near the taxiway.
x A taxiway is narrower than a runway.
x There is a rapid deterioration of the taxiway’s surface.
x Taxiway lighting and markings are different than for a runway.
ATC. ATC units must remain operationally creative, within regulatory 
guidelines, to ensure the full range of capability is available to support the JFC.
(a) UAS Operations. ATC should prepare to modify deconfliction procedures
used within the national airspace system. Procedural deconfliction will
transition to real-time deconfliction within the assigned airspace due to
expeditionary UAS operations.
(b) Counter-rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) Operations. These operations
will likely share the operational environment with ATC units. C-RAM is
designed to integrate a variety of capabilities and assets to the defeat the
enemy’s indirect fire efforts. Rapid action to defeat indirect fire may limit ATC
units’ reaction time and adversely affect their operations. ATC units must
maintain situational awareness on C-RAM operations to deconflict fire with
flying. Close coordination with the BDOC will allow ATC units to receive the
quickest possible warning prior to interception.
(c) Deconfliction of Surface-to-Surface Fires. Coordination with ground forces
to deconflict surface-to-surface fires must be accomplished to ensure safe,
orderly, and expeditious air traffic flow and timely fires clearance.
(d) Communications Out/Emission Control (EMCON) ATC Operations.
During these procedures, aircraft operations may require alternative
communication procedures between the aircraft and airfield ATC. In most
instances, these prebriefed procedures use light signals for communication
between the control tower and aircraft. An alternative uses airport vehicles
vice lights. The tower communicates with a vehicle using low powered,
handheld radios, and the vehicle blocks or gives way to the aircraft based on
permission to restrict taxi or allow takeoff. The vehicle method allows more
positive control on high-tempo airfield traffic. These procedures require close
coordination between the tower and aircrew for mission accomplishment.
Table 4 is an example of communications out/EMCON procedures.

An Example of Communications Out/EMCON Procedures
If back taxi is required or safety is in doubt, cancel communications out/emission 
control (EMCON), and crews should resume normal communication procedures. 
Request a restart of these procedures at any time by making a request with the 
ground/tower (i.e., “Midas 20, resume communications out/EMCON”). 
Once airborne, resume communication with air traffic control.
1. Provide the following information to airfield operations no later than two hours
prior to takeoff:
x
Call sign, number, and type of aircraft (i.e., Midas 20, four F-15Es).
x
Tail numbers.
x
Start, taxi, and takeoff times.
x
Runway line-up procedures.
2. Make start, taxi, and takeoff times on time or up to five minutes late. After
engine start, request time changes with operations (refer to the original time).
3. Flight leads will accomplish a radio check with operations using the tail
number; and obtain routing clearance by telephone prior to step, secure, or in the
clear with ground using the tail number.
4. All flight members will monitor ground, tower, and departure frequencies.
5. During a large force employment, a representative from air traffic control will
attend the mass brief.
6. When the communications out/EMCON launch light signals, display a steady
taxi or landing light at the tower when the aircraft is ready for takeoff.

(e) Reduced Same Runway Separation. The sequential nature of military
operations, coupled with the limited number of airfields, highlights the need to
achieve and maintain a peak level of operation into a busy airfield or airspace.
Using reduced runway separation (i.e., allowing aircraft to land in proximity to
other aircraft) increases overall traffic flow into a congested airfield. See FAA
Order JO 7110.65Z, Air Traffic Control, for additional information.
(f) Randomized Arrival or Departure Procedures. Terminal ATC procedures
in a high-threat situation can enhance aircraft survivability. A sector, or wagon
wheel, overlay divides the airspace into eight 45-degree sectors starting at 5
nautical miles (nm) and continuing in 5 nm increments, out to 15 nm, or
whatever number of sectors and mileage is deemed appropriate (figure 3).
Designate sectors using an alpha-numeric system that is changed regularly
and published within the special instructions of the current air tasking order or
airspace control order cycle. The frequency of changes is based upon the
threat activity level. The sectors are aligned with existing runways or helipads

0$5
on the airfield and allow aircraft freedom to maneuver below the established 
coordinating altitude. Sectors and control become more restrictive the closer 
aircraft are to the airfield. Using sectors and landing pads eliminates the need 
for traffic or holding patterns. Aircraft report crossing each phase line (5 nm 
increments) of the sector until aircraft are cleared to land. Position calls 
enable traffic advisories and procedural separation by controllers and 
eliminates the need for runway use by RW traffic in situations where a large 
volume of FW air traffic exists.
Depiction of Randomized Arrival/Departure Procedures
(g) Aircraft Traffic Patterns During Tactical Operations. Increase aircraft
survivability in the terminal phase of flight operations by modifying and
randomizing aircraft traffic patterns. For more information, see FAA Order JO
7400.2, Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters.
Other Airfield Support. The following list shows support required for executing
additional airfield operations. See appendix C for additional information.

Cargo or Passenger Handling. 
Aircraft Maintenance and Ground Equipment. Plan for initially austere, limited 
capabilities, to full maintenance support after arrival of sustainment forces.
Safety. Provides occupational, flight, and weapons safety oversight. 
ARFF. ARFF depends on vehicles, an agent, and personnel available to 
conduct operations. 
Munitions and Ordnance. 
Weather Support. The initially deployed weather capability provides essential 
airfield-focused weather services consisting of solar and lunar data, 
Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs), Terminal Area Forecasts (TAFs), 
and warnings, watches, and advisories (WWAs).  
(a) In addition to the above, theater weather support units provide other
essential weather support services, these include;
x Theater-focused weather forecast products.
x Space weather.
x Hydrological and oceanographic products.
x Environmental awareness.
x Winds and temperature aloft forecasts.
x Other services.
(b) Depending on the mission, collaboration with HN weather forecasters
may be considered when setting up an airfield and providing weather
products due to HN familiarity with local weather patterns.
Airfield Engineer Forces. Engineer units should accompany the assault force. 
Their task is to clear runways of obstacles. The type and quantity of obstacles on 
a runway demand special consideration. These obstacles have a major impact on 
engineer assets required by the task force, the time for clearance, and the 
planned time of arrival of air-land sorties. The initial assault may include airdrop 
bulldozers and handheld mine detectors to assist engineers. Assault forces 
should consider training select personnel to hot wire indigenous vehicles and 
airfield support vehicles required to assist an offload. Once the assault echelon 
has seized initial objectives, runway clearance teams (i.e., engineers, explosive 
ordnance disposal [EOD], and other designated personnel) begin clearing or 
repairing the runway(s). See appendix H for unique engineer capabilities.
Support Functions. The following are recommended airbase support 
functions for integrated operations: 
(a) Contracting. Provides oversight, execution, and closeout of any contracts
with HN, nongovernment agencies, and joint Services. They should be a first
in and last out capability. They must have ability to terminate or transfer
contracts prior to retrograde or redeployment.

0$5
(b) Finance. Provides financial expertise, funding oversight and Service
member financial support.
(c) Medical Services. Provides medical care for tenant units. Aviation and
flight medicine staff are necessary for aviators and aircrew personnel. Refer
to JP 4-02, Joint Health Services, for more information.
(d) Supply. Provides oversight and management of supply classes.
(e) Communications. Provides internal and external communication support,
to include all cyberspace transport solutions, and oversight for the
communications working group to integrate or deconflict as required.
(f) Fuel Services. Provides aviation and ground fleet petroleum, oil,
lubricants; other specialized equipment fuel needs (includes receipt, storage
and distribution equipment); fuel accountability; fuel quality
assurance/surveillance; and defueling services.
(g) Power Production. Provides power generation to the airfield.
(h) Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Services. Provides morale, welfare, and
quality of life resources.
(i) Personnel. Provides personnel accountability, casualty reporting, and
personnel control operations.
(j) Religious Support. Provides direct religious support and advisement for
command and staff on the impact of religion, ethics, morals, and morality.
(k) Vehicle Fleet Management and Maintenance. Provides oversight,
accountability and maintenance of nontactical and tactical vehicle fleets.
(l) Intelligence. Provides geospatial planning and support; intelligence
analysis; and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations.
(m) Legal. Provides legal advice to the commander and staff on military
justice, administrative and civil law, contract and fiscal law, and national
security law.
(n) Public Affairs. Provides public communications, command information,
audiovisual documentation, and community and key-leader engagement
support to the airfield commander.
(o) Force Protection. Provides oversight of defense forces, conducts liaison
with HN and coalition partners, prepares and coordinates base defense plans
with the SAA and support agencies, and implements physical security
measures, coordinating deviations from standards with HHQ FP directorate.
Establishing Airfield Security. Airfield opening forces can have some organic 
security for airfield access control and limited self-defense. However, expansion 
of FP services for the airfield, base perimeter, base security zone, suppression of 
enemy air defense, and patrols for indirect fire standoff often depend on 
additional forces.
Security Measures. 
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
33
(a) Airfield physical security is integral to protect forces and equipment.
Physical security measures are designed to deter, detect, delay, defend, and
defeat threats from terrorists, criminals, and unconventional forces. These
measures include:
x Fencing and perimeter standoff space.
x Lighting and sensors.
x Vehicle barriers.
x Blast protection.
x Intrusion-detection systems and electronic surveillance.
x Camouflage, concealment, and deception.
(b) Procedural measures protect US personnel and equipment regardless of
mission or geographical location. Procedural measures include:
x Security checks.
x Training and awareness.
x Property accountability and inventory requirements.
x Physical security inspections of mission essential or vulnerable
areas.
x Physical security surveys of installations.
Airfield Defense. 
(a) Airfield defense requires a dedicated security force coordinated with a
BDOC. The airfield may house a base-cluster commander, or it may be a
cluster itself. A dedicated security force is responsible for the airfield’s base
security zone, suppression of enemy air defense, counter UAS capabilities,
and patrols for indirect fire standoff. Its internal defense is primarily the
responsibility of the quick reaction force (QRF) and security forces assigned
to the airfield. The QRF provides in-depth defense for weapons, weapons
systems, command centers, personnel, and other priority resources
established by the base commander.
(b) When the threat exceeds the capability of the assigned airfield security
force and QRF, the base commander requests FP assistance through the
base cluster operations cell. The base cluster operations cell is the Army
maneuver enhancement brigade responsible for or the joint security areas’
joint security coordination center. (See JP 3-10, Joint Security Operations in
Theater).
Base Defense Plan. 
(a) The SAA provides assistance in developing and implementing
comprehensive defense plans to protect the airfields. The defense plan
34 
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
0$5 
includes measures to deter, detect, delay, and defeat Level I and Level II 
threats.  
x Level I Threat. A small enemy force that can be defeated by those
units normally operating in the echelon support area or by the
perimeter defenses established by friendly bases and base clusters.
Level I threats include enemy agents and terrorists whose primary
missions include espionage, sabotage, assassination, and subversion.
These include a potential for insider attacks by elements or individuals
of HN partners and security forces, often characterized as green-on-
blue.
x Level II Threat. An enemy force or activities that can be defeated by
a base or base cluster’s defensive capabilities when augmented by a
response force. Level II threats include small-scale forces conducting
irregular warfare that can pose serious threats to military forces and
civilians. Attacks by Level II threats can cause significant disruptions to
military operations and the orderly conduct of local government and
services. Forces constituting Level II threats are capable of conducting
well-coordinated, but small-scale, hit-and-run attacks; improvised
weapons attacks with roadside or vehicle-borne improvised explosive
devices; raids; and ambushes. These forces may employ significant
standoff weapons threats, such as mortars, rockets, rocket-propelled
grenades, and man-portable air defense systems.
x Level III Threat. An enemy force which is beyond the capability of
base and base cluster security forces and can only be effectively
countered by a tactical combat force (TCF) or other significant forces.
Level III threats may be encountered when a threat force has the
capability of projecting combat power by air, land, or sea or anywhere
into the operational area. Level III threats include airborne, heliborne,
and amphibious operations; large combined arms ground force
operations; and infiltration operations involving small groups infiltrated
into the operational area, regrouped at predetermined times and
locations, and committed against priority targets. Air and missile
threats to bases, base clusters, and lines of communications also
present imminent threats to joint forces.
Note: See Joint Publication 3-10, Joint Security Operations in Theater, for more 
information on threat levels. 
(b) To maximize mutual support and prevent friendly fire, the SAA or base
commander will assist in deconflicting defense plans (to include contract
support necessary to implement those plans) with adjacent base and base
clusters, and joint, multinational, and HN forces. The base commander must
ensure proper integration of defense plans into the overall base and joint
forces’ security plans. SAA airfield defense responsibilities include:
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
35
x Developing and monitoring unit training as it relates to the base
defense plan.
x Participating in base defense planning.
x Providing, staffing, and operating base defense facilities per base
defense plans.
x Conducting individual and unit training to ensure force readiness in
defense of the base.
x Providing appropriate personnel to the BDOC.
x Providing liaison personnel to advise the base commander on
matters unique to the airfield.
x Providing communications systems, including common-user
communications, within the command.
x Providing review and placement of camera systems and tethered
balloons.
Establish the Airfield Layout. (See appendix K for more information.) 
General. When arriving at an airfield, the SAA, airfield assessment team, and 
airfield management personnel should consider the operational needs of current 
and future aviation units, the tactical requirements for the mission, and any 
hazards and risks associated with contingency airfield operations. Upon 
identification of risks, the SAA begins the process of mitigation to ensure the 
airfield expansion can occur safely and meet the needs of the using force. 
Applicable Service regulations and UFCs  will dictate the criteria used for airfield 
opening and follow-on operations. This may require formal safety waivers and 
risk mitigation at varying leadership levels, depending on the size of the force 
and the nature of the tactical mission. 
SAA Requirements. The SAA must proactively seek an airfield manager or 
operations officer with airfield management and opening experience to ensure 
safety requirement implementation. 
(a) Preserve Usable Pavement. Airfield pavements (e.g., runways, taxiways,
aprons, etc.) capable of supporting aircraft movement and parking are scarce
and finite resources. As such, the use of airfield pavements for non-aircraft
related activities (i.e., cargo storage, maintenance and support facilities, etc.)
should be limited to the maximum extent possible.
(b) Prioritize Flight Line Functions and Placement. Certain functions need
immediate flight line access for mission accomplishment, while some can
support operations further away from the flight line or from the base-support
layer. Depending on the mission, some critical functions can provide support,
fully, from just off the flight line (e.g., life support, EOD, maintenance, flight
operations, etc.). Some other functions, such as ARFF, require immediate
access to the airfield. In some cases, physically splitting a function may be
36
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
the best solution. For example, locate aeromedical evacuation adjacent to the 
ramp and in the main medical center support section. 
(c) Place Support Facilities. Determine the placement of critical airfield
support facilities. FARP, arm/de-arm pads, and munitions storage areas are
hazardous and should not be located in the approach or departure areas of
the runway or helipad, or near high-population areas and facilities. In addition,
arm/de-arm headings should be positioned in a safe direction.
(d) Plan Explosive Routes. Coordinate explosive delivery routes to limit entry
control points and minimize personnel and aircraft exposure.
(e) Plan Ammunition Storage. Ammunition storage requires a minimum safe
distance from facilities and other munitions depending on the net explosive
weight and type of munition. In addition, there are rules concerning hazards of
electromagnetic radiation to ordnance which must be followed per MIL-HDBK-
240, Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance Test Guide, and
DESR 6055.09, Defense Explosives Safety Regulation.
(f) Know Airfield Criteria. Establish and enforce airfield criteria. All airfield
construction and airfield support sighting should be coordinated with the SAA
to ensure they do not encroach on runway, taxiway, or apron clear zones.
The airfield manager can determine the airfield planning and design criteria to
apply to the airfield. Depending on the area of responsibility, seek combatant
command guidance for additional airfield technical requirements.
(g) Manage Expansion. The SAA should develop an airfield master plan that
captures requirements for planned airfield expansion and potential additional
bed down. Installing airfield matting (i.e., airfield matting second-generation
[AM2]) may enable temporary taxiways, runways, and parking area
expansion.
(h) Determine Dispersal Distances. UFC 3-260-01 is the source document for
joint airfield criteria. Civil engineers and airfield managers plan airfield and
camp layouts taking into account all factors and Service guidance (such as
Air Force Pamphlet 10-219v5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning).
Required Assessments Implementation. Continually assess the airfield’s 
weight-bearing capacity and surface condition based on the aircraft type required 
for mission accomplishment. Engineers should ensure repairs are complete and 
to an acceptable quality to meet the SAA’s most stringent aircraft requirements, 
and minimum number of passes requirements. 
Austere or Expeditionary Condition Preparations. Preparation of temporary 
airfield surfaces provides the SAA with immediate runway and parking solutions 
for supported aircraft (manned or unmanned). Soil and ground preparation 
analyses are critical to install AM2 matting, expeditionary lighting, and arresting 
equipment.
(a) The United States Marine Corps uses AM2 matting to construct runways,
taxiways, parking areas, vertical short takeoff and landing expanses, and
0$5 
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
37 
vertical takeoff and landing pads. AM2 matting is suitable for all FW, RW, and 
tiltrotor aircraft in the USMC inventory. AM2 is also suitable for C-17 
operations. All AM2 matting will be installed in accordance with NAVAIR 51-
60A-1, USMC EAF Surfacing Systems and Accessories.  SAA will approve 
the design and usage of AM2 airfields. PMA-251, Office Code BL14500 will 
provide technical support for all AM2 installations when required. Assembling 
AM2 to accommodate these applications requires a number of special pieces 
(e.g., connectors, key locks, spacer mats, and adapters) not used for an AM2 
patch. Many applications require anchoring or staking to stop vertical and 
horizontal movement. Install and test anchors and stakes in accordance with 
NAVAIR 51-60A-1. 
“…The few minor airfield operating considerations that we had during 
predeployment training were with nacelles and being non-compatible with some 
of the surfaces that we have in some of our zones. You can’t go into helo 
matting, it can’t go into mobi-matting but it can land, obviously, on AM2 (airfield 
mat 2nd generation) matting. Those were all addressed prior to the unit arriving. 
There are no concerns that haven’t been looked at, scrutinized, and thoroughly 
addressed during the deployment or post deployment stage.” 
—LtCol Kurt Diehl, Assistant G-3, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing 
(b) United States Air Force. The extruded aluminum alloy matting,
designated as AM2, has been in the Air Force inventory for almost 40 years.
Once the mainstay of rapid runway crater repair, it is now mostly relegated to
a secondary use for taxiway repairs and parking apron expansion. However, it
represents a viable option for runway repairs if other methods are not
possible. AM2 mat repair must meet the repair quality criteria for its location
on the runway. The following limitations apply.
x AM2 mat repair kits are acceptable for fighter aircraft and C-130s, but
are inadequate for jet cargo aircraft landing strips. This limitation is due
to the inadequate anchoring system, narrow patch width (16.5 meters
wide by 23.6 meters long [54 feet wide by 77.5 feet long]), and
susceptibility to jet blast from outboard engines.
x AM2 mats may be used to repair taxiways and aprons if braking and
tight turns are limited on the mat. Adequate drainage of the base and
subbase layers is important. Excess moisture in these layers will cause
a reduction in the load-bearing capacity of the subsurface material and,
subsequently, mat failure.
(c) Adjacent Parking. Expand parking areas adjacent to existing aircraft
pavements using expedient techniques, such as graded and compacted
earth, compacted crushed stone, or AM2 matting over a compacted subbase.
Once used primarily for rapid runway crater repairs, AM2 matting is now used
to repair or expand aircraft parking areas. Refer to TSPWG M 3-270-01.3-
270-07 O&M: Airfield Damage Repair, for more information on AM2 matting
assembly and installation.

AIRFIELD TRANSITION OPERATIONS
1. Overview
The transition to follow-on forces and subsequent drawdown have a significant
impact on an airfield opening. Planners must consider the long-term use of the
airfield in the planning phase, because the transition phase brings airfield operations
from the capabilities established in airfield opening to the desired operational
capability determined in planning. Planners also must consider, and provide
resources for, transitioning the airfield to follow-on forces or the HN, in a deliberate
manner.
Specialized military forces providing expeditionary capabilities at locations where
operational support is insufficient or nonexistent conduct airfield opening operations.
As units accomplish airfield-opening tasks, the goal is to create smooth transitions
between the various phases of operations and transfers of authority to follow-on
forces. When available, liaison personnel can be instrumental in ensuring seamless
transitions.
Transition to sustained operations can occur through multiple venues: continuous
military rotation, contracted service support, or returning services to the HN’s
responsibility. Of note, returning services to the HN’s responsibility still may require
oversight, assistance, or support. Establishing sustainable airfield operations
capability requires significant planning to ensure appropriate resources are available
to meet the JFC’s requirements. Sustainment of airfield operations requires long-
term ATC support.
Although the mission circumstances can vary greatly, transferring airfield
responsibility requires detailed and deliberate planning. Functional transitions occur
over time as follow-on capabilities match or exceed existing capabilities. Ideally,
transitioning organizations (i.e., Services, agencies, or nations) use standardized
checklists. Appendix D is an example of a joint capability-based transition checklist
to guide transition operations.
2. Preparation
Establish a Timeline. Timelines provide a template and an execution order to
facilitate an orderly transition of equipment and airbase operations from airfield
opening forces to follow-on forces. Timelines will focus on sustaining capabilities
throughout the transition.
Organize Equipment Transitions. Equipment availability and support requirements 
are key planning factors in determining the airfield operations requirements. 
Reconstitute equipment used in support of airfield opening during turnover with 
follow-on forces to make the equipment available for future tasking. Functional 
SMEs determine the order of equipment teardown for their individual area of 
operations (AO) to ensure mission continuation. Transferring equipment to follow-on 
forces should be reserved for extreme circumstances to preserve a rapid-response 
airfield opening capability. 
40
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
Synchronize. The infrastructure necessary to support follow-on equipment must 
be in place prior to transition. Replacement parts and trained maintenance 
technicians are Service specific and, often, equipment specific. Sustainable 
operations require in-place base support (e.g., power, supply, communications, and 
FP personnel). For ATC, setup times may vary from hours to days, depending on the 
weather, equipment deployed, and availability of flight check aircraft. Increasing 
capabilities may require changes to assigned airspace, and must be coordinated 
with the aircraft control agency and the HN. 
Ensure Interoperability. Current DATCALS of one Service may not be fully 
compatible with those of other Services, coalition partners, or HN. Consider the 
equipage of all aircraft operating from the airfield in determining required capabilities 
and services.  
Facilitate Point of Contact (POC) Transition. Liaisons are instrumental in ensuring 
a smooth transition. The transition POC is a person from the deployed unit who 
possesses experience in, and a broad understanding of, the mission.
Coordinate Personnel Transition. SMEs should link up with their follow-on 
counterpart to pass airfield or airbase operations information.
Assign Functional Area POCs. Functional transitions occur as follow-on forces 
arrive on station. Functional area POCs and SMEs help facilitate a detailed and 
deliberate airfield and airbase responsibility transfer. Some liaison considerations 
are listed in table 5.

3. Transition to Follow-on Forces, HN, or Governmental Agency Control
Functional airfield capabilities and responsibilities will transition from airfield
opening when similar forces are in place to extend or expand airfield operations.
As soon as possible, establish specific priorities, timelines, and common
checklists for integration and transition. When planning for a transition, allocate
sufficient time to handover and transfer contractual obligations and supply accounts,
and foster follow-on force or HN relationships.
Once the transition is complete, the airfield opening force can redeploy or move
forward, as required. Required airfield functions do not change after the transition.
The transition is merely a change in organizations from airfield opening forces to
organizations that are responsible for providing long-term airfield operations.
Joint Service Capabilities. Services can provide VFR and IFR service to all aircraft 
through mobile control towers, radar systems, and communications connectivity. Air 
Force and Marine ATC sustainment equipment provides complete ATC service to 
support a theater airbase mission but requires extensive airlift to deploy. Navy 
shipboard systems, with their inherent resupply and embarked maintenance, are 
limited by the ship’s ability to remain on station and maintain the operational health 
of its systems. The Army provides complete service, except approach control. See 
appendices E–H for Service specifics.  
Continued Responsibility. Sustained operations may not end when airfield 
operations’ personnel and equipment completely redeploy. With HN or contracted 
services, the joint force still may have responsibility for oversight, quality assurance 
evaluation, procedures review, and HN agreements. The sustained operations 
phase ends when the JFC determines the mission is complete and transfers 
responsibility.
4. Enabling Civil Authority
General. During the enabling civil authority phase of military operations, place
emphasis on restoring HN jurisdiction and airspace control following the operation.
This phase also reestablishes the HN infrastructure and prepares forces for
redeployment, while progressively transferring airfield and airspace control to HN
authority. Service ATC units continue to provide airspace information and terminal
services to aid the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic until the HN can
assume all ATC responsibilities. However, some airfields may require complete
termination of operations due to nature of the airfield, or HN inability or desire to
assume ATC responsibilities.
Planning Considerations. Planning for the transition back to civil ATC services or
military ATC operation cessation should begin early and be continually updated. As
early as possible, coordinate with HN, NGO, and JFC planners (to include
operational contract support [OCS] planners and/or the senior contracting official
[SCO] performing duties of lead Service for contracting [LSC] or lead Service for
contracting coordination [LSCC]) to restore or contract ATC services to relieve
military ATC units. The transitioning forces should determine if improvements are
42
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
needed for airfield and ATC facility infrastructure to meet ICAO standards and
recommended practices.
Transferring Airspace Control. When an ATC agency receives a request to 
transfer control of airspace, the agency should consider the following:
Receiving Agency. Consider the personnel and equipment to be transferred 
or loaned to the HN or Service during the transfer period, and associated costs.
Consultation with Affected Agencies. Agencies and organizations with 
established procedures require notification of an impending transfer. Examples of 
agencies requiring notification are aviation units, fire support elements, air 
defense agencies, intelligence organizations, and multinational forces.
Identification of the Date of Transfer. Knowing the expected date and time of 
transfer is critical to executing a workable plan to accomplish the transfer. 
Identifying the key elements of the transfer plan and liaisons with the transfer 
authority will minimize delays and expedite the handover.
5. Close the Airfield
Closure Planning. Closure planning requires a coordinated interagency effort that
addresses all joint, State Department, US Government, and HN issues and
concerns. In a joint operations area, the joint staff in the area of responsibility should
provide overarching closure policies and procedures for all Services. The CCDR’s
staff will lead in negotiating HN agreements. The termination of military operations
ends with a transition to civilian control. The result will be a timely, efficient, and
effective closure that leaves a positive message with the HN and properly marshals
US forces and equipment for future employment.
Drawdown. The drawdown of operations may require reversing the buildup
process, including a second deployment of initial entry ATC assets who are able to
operate without base support (e.g., Marine MMT, Army TACT, or Air Force STT) to
allow for joint force withdrawal. End of operations will require a handover or phase-
out of ATC services. Then, units may deploy ATC equipment to another location or
the home station, or transfer it to the HN, as determined by higher authority.
Phasing and Considerations. 
Phases. 
(a) Phase 1, Assessment and Plan Development. Inventory and determine
equipment  to redeploy, transfer to the HN, or remain in place. Assess
actions, forces, and equipment required to accomplish the closure or
transition. Produce a time-phased plan that encompasses all closing
activities, while sustaining required airfield operations capabilities.
Communicate the plan to all organizations involved.
x The plan should be site-specific, but reflect lessons learned from
previous airfield closures.
x BOS-I and SAA priorities require consideration because different
Services may be responsible for one or both.
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
43
x FP and accountability must continue until all personnel have
departed.
(b) Phase 2, Execution of the Closure Plan. Redeploy non-closure related
personnel and equipment. Manage infrastructure disposition.
x Direct and frequent communication between the BOS-I and SAA will
significantly benefit closure operations and equipment retrograde.
x There may be closure forces assigned from two or more Services,
US Government agencies, or partner nations.
x Detailed sequencing is the key to effectively executing the closure
plan.
(c) Phase 3, Final Closure Actions. Relinquish control of the airfield and
complete personnel and equipment redeployment. This includes
accountability of contractors authorized to accompany the force (CAAF), their
equipment, and redeployment.
x Security is most vulnerable during this phase.
x Personnel accountability is vital.
Risks. 
(a) An increased ground threat due to localized or standoff attack, sabotage,
and civil unrest.
(b) Operational requirements may change during closure.
(c) An accelerated timeline to close.
(d) A contractor or contract default of existing contracts and/or commercial
market capacity to meet surge of requirements or acceleration of timelines
due to closure.
Closing Limitations. Airfield closure requires integrating in-place forces and 
may include a minimal amount of closure-specific forces and equipment to 
execute closure processes. Closing installations must develop comprehensive 
local plans and dedicate sufficient personnel and transportation assets for 
closure functions. Most military equipment will redeploy with units or be 
retrograded to support reset programs. In some cases, the closing authority may 
only return a portion of a location to the HN authority. In these instances, the 
closing authority would consider the location “partially returned,” and it will remain 
usable as an operational platform. This may involve turning over responsibility to 
the HN authority for base operating support, in accordance with proper

“As the Afghanistan noncombatant evacuation operations ramped up during the 
peak of retrograde operations, it became rapidly apparent that joint 
interoperability between DoD, NGOs, and DOS [Department of State] would be 
the key to success or subsequent cause of mission failure. The movement of 
civilians from theater to CONUS with so many different government agencies 
involved caused a complex system of command relationships that needed to be 
worked out before operations could move smoothly and be successful at the 
tactical level.”

Appendix B
AIRFIELD ASSESSMENT AND SURVEY CHECKLIST
1. Overview
A single standard for airfield assessment data does not exist. The AF Form 1174
(Airfield Survey), is one product that can be used as an airfield assessment or 
survey. The form can be downloaded from https://static.e-
publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a3/form/af1174/af1174.pdf  
Additionally, the joint task force-port opening joint assessment team (JAT)
assessment report format is in United States Transportation Command 
(USTRANSCOM) Instruction 10-27, Vol 2, Attachment 2, Joint Task Force–Port 
Opening. Table 7 is a sample of an assessment checklist. 
2. Timeline for the Initial Assessment
Four Hours. When the JAT leader or commander arrives at the port of debarkation 
(POD), the “go/no-go” is provided by leadership after the initial assessment, to 
determine: 
If the POD can handle the stated mission. 
If augmentation is required before operations can commence (i.e. additional 
security, runway repair, etc.).  
If additional time is needed before the decision can be made.
Twenty-four Hours. This is after JAT personnel arrive at the POD to submit a JAT 
report (including the POD, distribution network, and forward node assessment) to 
USTRANSCOM and the combatant commander (CCDR).

Appendix C
AIRFIELD OPENING CHECKLIST
1. Handover from Seizure Forces
Planning. Transfer of senior airfield authority (SAA) from seizure forces to follow-
on forces is a deliberately planned event. The transfer of authority, despite its 
operational connotations, is a tactical event that requires tactical considerations.
Planning Factors. Key planning factors include: 
Determine who the follow-on forces should speak to during the transfer of 
authority event.
The communications between seizure forces and follow-on forces. 
Where the transfer of authority will take place on the field. 
Go/no-go contracts between the seizure force and the follow-on forces. 
Consider tactical movement on the field. 
Procedures for follow-on forces to request aid or a quick reaction force (QRF) 
from seizure forces. 
Sustaining follow-on forces until their own equipment and sustainment arrive. 
Establishing the command relationship between seizure forces and follow-on
forces.
Determining reactions to attack and indirect fire. 
General Procedures. Discuss and finalize all aspects of the initial handover
checklist (table 8). When the transfer is to Air Force units, the air mobility liaison 
officer is critical for initiating and facilitating these planning events. Joint training in 
this process will help seizure and hand-off forces build a shared understanding of 
each force’s needs, capabilities, limitations, and lexicons. If seizure forces conduct a 
rehearsal, the follow-on force’s action officers should participate.
Initial Contacts. Establish contact with the land force commander. If following an 
Army brigade combat team (BCT), the assessment team commander or Service-
specific contingency response force (CRF) commander will want to make contact 
with the land force, unit commander occupying the airfield for a situation report 
(SITREP). This person may be the BCT commander, brigade support battalion 
commander, brigade engineer battalion commander, or another tasked unit’s 
commander.
Initial SITREP. The information in table 8 must be complete prior to the formal 
battlefield handover between the BCT commander (if possible) or a designated 
representative and the CRF commander. Priorities 1, 2, and 3 list tasks that need 
attention before seizure forces complete a handover.

0$5
Note: The checklist in table 8 serves as a guide for assessment, but does not drive strict 
adherence to its contents. Be mindful of battlefield conditions to determine the specific 
applicability of each checklist item. If the seizure force is still engaged in the fight, 
expect limited handover information. Expect the commander of the seizure force unit 
occupying the airfield to provide the initial SITREP. Prioritize discussion topics to aid 
with brevity, depending on battlefield conditions.
Initial Handover Checklist
Tasks and Considerations
Priority 1
Situation report. Consider the threat environment, enemy location, airfield or landing 
zone condition, or sustainment requirements. Is additional support needed to 
complete the mission?
Location of Friendly Forces. Where are the fields of fire?
Confirm rules of engagement changes (if any).
Status of the runway or landing zone. Has the airfield been damaged by the 
operation?
Base defense operations center or joint operations center. Establish one if none
exists. 
Sensors. What sensors are available and what is required after handover?
Configuration and location of seizure force airfield security forces. Where are the 
fields of fire?
Force integration. How can incoming forces best integrate with forces already in 
place?
Signal operating instructions. Ask for the current signal operating instructions, if not 
part of the seizure force. Signal operating instructions require change only if they 
breach operations security. 
(1) Challenge and use passwords.
(2) Implement near and far recognition.
(3) Use a running password.
(4) Use a number combination.
Location of casualty collection or evacuation point.

Tasks and Considerations
Ground communication status. Conduct a communications check on frequency 
modulation nets, as required, if it is not part of the seizure force’s procedures. 
(Complete this prior to operation commencement, if part of the seizure force’s 
procedures.)
Team notification of threats to the airfield.
Deconflict command and control of airspace over the airfield or landing zone.
(1) Notice to air mission (NOTAMs) and airfield advisories
Where, and what are the capabilities of, artillery and mortars in the airfield 
environment?
What are their standard operating procedures for firing indirect fires?
What is the command net frequency?
(1) How do airfield opening forces deconflict fires with inbound and outbound aircraft?
(2) Who is the fire direction officer?
(3) Who is the fire support officer?
Priority 2
Determine the seizure force’s logistical support requirements.
Establish traffic control points, as needed.
Create an aircraft parking plan (by type).
Create a vehicle parking plan (airfield).
Determine if environmental concerns exist. If they do, determine their locations.
Priority 3
Type and number of stay-behind forces.
(1) Commander.
(2) Noncommissioned officer in charge.
(3) Follow-on forces.
Allotted time on the objective.
The command relationship.
Additional points of contact.
(1) Force protection.
(2) Civil engineering.
(3) Explosive ordnance disposal.

UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS (USMC) CAPABILITIES
1. Overview
The USMC provides great versatility and flexibility to deal with situations across
the range of military operations. Fighting as an integrated air-ground team, the
Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) is a task-organized force comprised of four
elements: command element; ground combat element; aviation combat element
(ACE); and logistics combat element (LCE). The ACE’s ability to deploy and operate
in proximity to the fighting heightens the MAGTF’s ability to project power. Potential
operating sites range from urban areas containing established aviation facilities to
areas with crude, austere facilities. The MAGTF requires responsive air support
during all phases of its operations.
Marine aviation is expeditionary and, therefore, organizes, trains, and equips
Marines for expeditionary operations. The ACE’s expeditionary ability sets it apart
from the aviation organizations of other Services. Marine aviation can operate from
aircraft carriers; amphibious ships; or shore-based, forward operating bases (FOBs).
As an extension of sea-based aviation in littoral warfare, FOBs provide the ACE the
capability to phase military units ashore in support of sustained operations, or it can
provide shore-based support to naval campaigns in distributed operations. Essential
to the success of FOBs are certain infrastructure and ground support requirements
that facilitate flight operations, commonly referred to as aviation ground support
(AGS). The Marine Corps has also perfected short-duration aviation support
operations designed, expressly, to provide aviation rearming and refueling
operations, commonly referred to as a forward arming and refueling point (FARP).
FARPs can vary in size, scope, and duration; but they support a specific mission to
minimize the response time and decrease turnaround time in support of a specific
operation. FARPs are not enduring and only require minimal personnel and
equipment for the specific mission. Figure 5 highlights some USMC site command
scenarios.

USMC Site Command Scenarios
2. Marine Wing Support Squadron (MWSS)
The MWSS commander provides AGS to enable the Marine aircraft group (MAG)
commander, designated as the site commander, to generate sorties. AGS consists
of ground support functions required (except aircraft supply, maintenance, and
ordnance) for sustained air operations at FOBs and airbases. AGS directly supports
employing the six functions of Marine aviation, making it the critical component that
gives Marine aviation its expeditionary capability. AGS consists of numerous ground,
functional capabilities that support MAGTF aviation assets in austere environments.
Internal airfield service and airbase logistical requirements of attached and
supported units are coordinated through the aviation ground support operations
center (AGSOC). The Marine air control group (MACG) and Marine aviation logistics
squadrons execute ATC and aircraft maintenance, and supply, respectively.
The MWSS is a subordinate command of the MAG. The MWSS mission is to
provide AGS to enable a MAG or a composite MAG, designated site commander,
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
85
and supporting or attached elements of the MACG to conduct expeditionary 
operations. To support ACE units, the MWSS conducts the six AGS functions. They 
are: forward aviation combat engineering operations, airfield operations, base 
recovery after attack, airfield damage repair operations, FARP operations, and 
aircraft salvage and recovery operations.
The MWSS does not provide: meteorological and oceanographic services; air 
traffic control (ATC); aircraft maintenance; aviation supply; chemical, biological, 
radiological, nuclear, and explosives defense; or law enforcement functions. Other 
elements of the Marine aircraft wing or MAGTF provide these functions. The MWSS 
is structured to accomplish its missions in combat and is capable of task-organizing 
into detachments to meet specific mission requirements. The MWSS can establish 
and support one FOB and two FARPs simultaneously. The MWSS is organized into 
four operational companies with a headquarters staff. Each staff section conducts its 
traditional staff role with the operations and logistics sections responsible for the 
other functions.
The MWSS operates from an AGSOC and responds to the MAG/ACE 
commanding officer or site commander who it is assigned to support. The AGSOC is 
the nucleus for coordinating and executing AGS services for the ACE. From the 
AGSOC, the MWSS commander supervises the MWSS companies and manages 
squadron activities in accordance with the priorities established by the supported 
MAG commanding officer or site commander. The squadron S-3 runs the AGSOC, 
which includes representation from the squadron’s other staff sections and 
subordinate companies (i.e., airfield operations, engineer, and motor transport). The 
S-3 must be able to receive, prioritize, assign, and track AGS activities. The AGSOC
must be flexible to respond to changes in operations, tempo, and environment. The
AGSOC processes AGS requests from supported units and tasks subordinate
elements to respond to them. It manages the AGS effort and provides the command
and control for other activities which are important to operations:
Airfield operations. 
Airfield security operations. 
Base recovery after attack.
ADR operations. 
FARP operations. 
Aircraft salvage and recovery operations. 
Base camp construction and repair. 
Base camp services for the ACE. 
The AGSOC setup, internal functioning, and staffing are operationally driven and, 
therefore, change as the situation and the mission dictate. The AGSOC’s operation
is established in the unit’s standing operating procedures.

3. Marine Air Traffic Control (MATC) Company (Co)
MATC Cos are the principal terminal ATC organizations within the Marine air
command and control system. (See Marine Corps Tactical Publication (MCTP) 3-
20F, Control of Aircraft and Missiles, for more information.) In garrison, the MATC
Co is a subordinate element of the Marine air control squadron. An MATC Co
deploys as part of Marine air command and control system within a MAGTF, but
may deploy independently or as part of a joint or coalition force, should the mission
dictate. MATC Cos also function as integral parts of a MAGTF or joint force
integrated air defense system. (See MCRP 3-20F.7, Marine Air Traffic Control
Detachment Handbook, for details.)
Each MATC Co is organized and equipped to provide continuous, all-weather
ATC services to an independent and geographically separated main airbase or air
facility, and two remote air sites or points. The MATC Co includes the staff,
controllers, technicians, and equipment under a single company commander. MATC
Co equipment is maintained by the technicians assigned to the MATC Co and
supported by Naval Air Systems Command.
MATC Cos provide the full range of services from liaison at existing host nation,
coalition, or joint air traffic control facilities; to augmenting existing facilities to
increase interoperability and capability; to a full approach control with precision
approach capability where no services existed. The MATC Co may retain an
embedded Marine air traffic control mobile team (MMT) to support additional
requirements.
The MATC Co deploys credentialed weather analyst and air traffic controllers that
are trained and qualified at Marine Corps air stations. Each MATC Co is collocated
in garrison with an ATC facility, and the controllers assigned to the MATC Co train at
the facility under the Fleet Assistance Program. The MATC Co will task organize for
deployment to support specific mission requirements, in accordance with Naval Air
Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) manning
requirements. See NAVAIR 00-80T-114, NATOPS Air Traffic Control Manual.
4. MMTs
MMTs are trained and equipped to provide initial, rapid-response ATC and command, 
control, and communications to support MAGTF and joint missions. MMTs support 
operations at air sites, FARPs, and rapid ground refueling or lager points. As a 
standalone ATC capability, the MMT can task-organize to provide ATC and weather 
services for airfield seizures, noncombatant evacuation operations, domestic or foreign 
humanitarian assistance operations, civil assistance operations, and other short-
duration MAGTF or joint operations. Although often employed with other combat units, 
the MMT provides all self-sustainment equipment (for up to 72 hours) during initial 
operations. The MMT may serve as a precursor to a more robust capability from the 
MATC Co. A MMT is assigned to each Marine expeditionary unit.

UNITED STATES AIR FORCE (USAF) CAPABILITIES
1. Overview
The USAF’s airfield operations mission is to enable a full range of military operations 
from airfield seizure to closure or transition operations. The USAF, with the Air National 
Guard (ANG) component, provides safe, efficient, and effective airfield operations
support to theater combat operations, similar to those fixed-based facilities provide in 
the continental United States (CONUS) and overseas. The USAF has a robust ANG 
component, which plays a key role in airfield operations and can be available to support 
theater operations. See table 12 for an overview of USAF airfield operations 
capabilities.

Notes:
1. This is a basic airfield survey or assessment conducted during the initial entry phase, which is not a formal
geodetic survey, and cannot be used to gather data for TERPS certified approaches.
2. This requires high-intensity airfield lighting or host nation lighting. If neither is available, aircrew night vision
device systems are required.
3. Air Force or ANG PAR controllers require SEI 365 and must be tasked to ensure qualified controllers are
deployed.
4. STTs carry man-portable, battery-operated, short-duration, airfield lighting (all others require tactical lighting
systems or operational host nation systems). Use under visual meteorological conditions only.
5. This is limited to tactical airfield markings, lighting, runway surveillance, and landing surface evaluations.
6. Air Force airfield management personnel are tasked by the same command authority as ATC personnel.
7. Fixed-base unit type codes consist of personnel that join ATC equipment in the forward area or may be tailored
via TPFDD to work in host nation or inter-Service facilities.
8. This is the responsibility of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Office of Geomatics.
9. Instrument meteorological conditions only.
10. This is limited to TACAN systems. There is no approach control or PAR function. It may be limited to non-radar
operations that may hamper the operational tempo.

2. Contingency Response Forces (CRFs)
CRFs are scalable to meet specific tasking requirements. Their capabilities 
include: 
Limited airfield assessment. 
Contingency response element (CRE) command and control (C2). 
Aerial port. 
Quick-turn aircraft maintenance. 
Force protection (FP). 
Intelligence. 
Airfield security. 
Airfield management. 
Air traffic control (ATC) 
Communications. 
Fuels. 
Medical. 
Financial management. 
Contracting. 
Supply. 
CRFs are on 12-hour initial deployment requirements (36 hours for ANG) and will 
be used when there is limited planning time. CRF, and associated equipment, will be 
retrograded upon departure. 
A CRF also may have mobility advisory roles that include air mobility division 
augmentation or standalone capability, Service mobility liaisons, and a partner-
building capacity. 
CRFs task organize based on mission requirements. In a planning framework, the 
terms contingency response group (CRG), CRE and contingency response team 
(CRT) are used frequently. The size and capabilities associated with these terms are 
explained in the following paragraphs. Understand, these are planning frameworks 
only. The deployed CRF is not beholden to the described size or structure. 
Commanders and planners will generate the forces required from the capabilities 
available to them and present them to the supported command as a CRF (possibly 
referred to as a CRT, CRE, or CRG) only to help describe the general size and 
capability of the force. 
Consider the following CRF limitations: 
Working, parking, and contingency maximum (aircraft) on ground (MOG) 
vary for each mission.
There is no organic aircraft rescue and firefighting.
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
89
Beyond personal protective equipment, the CRF has no chemical, biological, 
radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) defense or detection capabilities. 
There is limited organic FP for airfield access control and self-defense. 
However, FP for the expanded base area depends on additional forces. 
Communications may be limited. Depending on the geographic location and 
crisis, worldwide access to cell phone and broadband global area network 
bandwidth may be limited due to high-demand commercial use.
Sustained operations are limited because CRFs are equipped to be self-
sufficient for the first five days of deployment.
CRF tasking to provide defense support of civil authorities (DSCA) and 
noncombatant evacuation operation (NEO) missions may occur.
DSCA. CRFs may assist in DSCA operations. Homeland Security 
Presidential Directive 5, Management of Domestic Incidents, established new 
federal emergency management rules based on the requirement that all levels of 
government have a single, unified approach to managing domestic incidents. 
Such incidents may include the following conditions: 
(a) Major disaster.
(b) Emergency.
(c) Fire management assistance.
(d) Catastrophic incident.
(e) Hazard.
NEO. CRFs may support NEOs. NEOs assist the Department of State in
evacuating United States citizens, DoD civilian personnel, and designated host 
nation (HN) and third country nationals whose lives are in danger, from locations 
in a foreign nation to a safe haven. Although considered in connection with 
hostile action, evacuation in anticipation of, or in response to, any natural or man-
made disaster is possible.
3. Contingency Response Wing (CRW)
The CRW is the basis of USAF contingency airfield operations. The in-garrison structure 
of CONUS-based CRW include two CRGs split between two operating locations: Joint 
Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey; and Travis Air Force Base, California. Each 
operating location has one CRG consisting of two contingency response squadrons and 
one contingency response support squadron. 
Deployable CRF units normally are not used in a sustainment role.
CRWs normally do not change operational control.
4. CRG
The CRG mission is to assess, open, and, initially, operate airfields. The group
consists of a standardized force module dedicated to the airfield-opening task. This
module includes a tailored selection of all forces needed after seizure, or handover
90
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
from seizure forces, to assess an airfield, establish initial air mobility C2, and operate 
the flow of air mobility into and out of that airfield.
CRGs may open and operate airfields or airbases after seizure, or when needed 
to assess, open, and initially operate airbases in support of the USAF component of 
the combatant command. Operational control (OPCON) will not transfer. The CRG 
may represent senior USAF leadership initially. For this reason, an O-6 commands 
the CRG. 
CRGs may open an airfield for the USAF, another Service, or a coalition partner. 
To ensure continuity of operations, CRGs should coordinate planning and 
agreements with the theater commander, commander USAF forces, or the joint force 
air component commander staffs.
CRGs are limited to a 60-day deployment cycle to complete transition to follow-on 
forces. CONUS-assigned CRGs maintain OPCON with the United States 
Transportation Command. Their primary capabilities include:
Airfield assessment.
Air mobility mission management, C2, and senior airfield authority (SAA).
Aerial port support (cargo and passenger handling). 
Limited quick-turn aircraft maintenance.
FP and limited airfield security.
Intelligence.
Airfield management.
ATC.
Communications.
Navigation aids.
Fuel servicing.
Financial management (paying agent).
Contracting.
Supply.
Airfield weather services. 
Special external capabilities (available for planning, but not immediately 
present in every unit). These include airborne, air assault, pathfinder, expanded 
combat communication, rapid engineer deployable heavy operational repair 
squadron engineer (RED HORSE), expeditionary engineering, and explosive 
ordnance disposal. 
CRF’s deploy with only five days of food, water, and diesel fuel. Resupply 
will be required by day six.

5. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE)-
Specific CRGs
PACAF CRG. The PACAF organization is somewhat different than an Air Mobility
Command controlled CRG. The PACAF CRG has four squadrons and a theater staff
to support wing-type functions inside the CRG. The four squadrons include:
RED HORSE. The RED HORSE squadron provides the theater construction 
capability and is associated with an ANG and a USAF Reserve RED HORSE 
unit.
Security Force Squadron. The security force squadron is responsible for in-
theater security force squadron training (e.g., fly away security teams, 
commando warrior, etc.) and containing the FP element for the CRG.
Mobility Response Squadron. The mobility response squadron has limited 
aerial port and aircraft maintenance personnel assigned to it. Therefore, these 
positions may require augmentation from other PACAF units.
Combat Communication Squadron. The combat communication squadron 
provides in-theater deployable communications for all PACAF. 
USAFE CRG. The USAFE CRG is an in-garrison organization and deployable 
unit. The deployable size, organization, and mission are similar to other USAF 
CRGs. The in-garrison organization consists of three squadrons. They are: 
Air mobility squadron (which includes the operational and combat support 
mission elements of the aerial port, C2, and quick-turn maintenance). 
Security forces squadron.
Construction and training squadron. 
6. USAF Reserve and National Guard Bureau
The USAF Reserve and National Guard Bureau possess CRF capability. The
ANG CRGs consist of in-garrison and deployable units. The in-garrison organization
consists of a global mobility squadron, a global mobility readiness squadron, and
contingency response flight. The deployable size and mission are consistent with
active-duty CRGs. See Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures 3-4.7,
Contingency Response, for more information.
The CRG is an in-garrison organization and a deployable unit. The in-garrison
organization consists of two squadrons, a contingency response squadron (CRS)
and a contingency response support squadron (CRSS). The CRS includes the
operational and combat support mission elements of the aerial port, C2, and quick-
turn aircraft maintenance. The CRSS includes selected mission elements of agile
combat support, such as security forces and other base operating support-integrator
support roles.
7. CRE
A CRE is a deployed organization at forward locations where air mobility support
is insufficient or nonexistent. A CRE’s core capability sets consist of C2, aerial port,
92
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
and aircraft maintenance. CREs provide minimum essential on or offload and en 
route aircraft mission support during deployment, employment, and redeployment 
operations. The standard CRE is capable of supporting a working MOG of two with 
24-hour C2 coverage.
The ANG CRF1 is a temporary deployed organization established where air
mobility operational support is nonexistent or insufficient. An officer, trained within 
the unit and certified by the commander, leads the CRF1. The core capability sets 
that define a CRF1 are the same as those for a CRE. Aerial port and aircraft 
maintenance specialists will have to be obtained through unit sourcing. CRF1s 
provide minimum, essential onload, offload, and en route aircraft mission support 
during deployment, employment, and redeployment operations. A CRF1 can support 
a working maximum of two aircraft on the ground for 24 hours.
8. CRT
A CRT performs the same functions as a CRE, but on a smaller scale and with no
aircraft maintenance capability. CRTs are led by an enlisted supervisor (E-7 or
above) trained and certified by the unit’s commander. A CRT can support a working
MOG of one for 12 hours a day but will maintain 24-hour C2 coverage.
A CRF1 performs the same functions as a CRE, but on a smaller scale. The airlift
control flight is led by an enlisted supervisor (E7-level or above) trained within the
unit and certified by the commander. An airlift control flight is capable of supporting a
MOG of one for 12 hours a day, but will maintain 24-hour C2 coverage. Contingency
support elements will augment a CRT as required.
9. Assessment Team and Airfield Survey Team
An assessment team or airfield survey team accomplishes assessments to verify
known information and evaluate and obtain any items that were not already
assessed. Assessment teams compile and report results to higher headquarters
(HHQ), as directed, through appropriate command channels. Airfield surveys will
address areas such as runways, ramps, taxiways, FP, communications, and
facilities. Completed surveys provide a recommendation to decision makers on the
suitability of future airfield operations (fixed- or rotary-wing). Team personnel should
meet with representatives of the airfield seizure forces, HN, and follow-on forces to
understand the supported commander’s mission for the airfield and proposed layout.
The ANG CRF1s maintain the same capabilities and can be used in the same
manner as an assessment team.
10. Joint Inspection
Joint inspection personnel deploy worldwide to support the air movement of hazardous 
cargo and equipment, in accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation 4500.9-R, 
Part III, Mobility, June 2016. Joint inspection personnel are specially trained and 
experienced aerial port personnel whose inspections ensure all documentation 
requirements are met and shipments are airworthy and safe for flight.

11. Air Traffic Control Squadrons (ATCSs) and Combat Communication
Squadrons
The 53d ATCS is an Air Combat Command unit based at Robins Air Force Base,
Georgia. The 53d ATCS provides combat-ready Airmen to enable airpower basing
maneuverability and total force engagement across the full range of military
operations through the deployable air traffic control and landing system (DATCALS)
enterprise.
The 1st Combat Communication Squadron in Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany
also possesses a DATCALS capability. However, the preponderance of DATCALS is
supported by the ANG within 10 ATCS. All 10 squadrons are equipped with control
towers, tactical air navigation systems, and approach radars. They are the USAF’s
interim airfield-opening response force and designed to provide an initial cadre of
associated maintenance personnel. As such, they continually engage in the
contingency planning process to help ease the transition from airbase opening
planning and execution to airbase sustainment.
The 53d ATCS, 1st Combat Communications Squadron, and ANG ATCSs can
provide a full range of ATC service and procedural and positive control capabilities.
For additional information, see Air Force Doctrine Annex 4-0, Combat Support,
Airbase Opening Forces and Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures 3-4-4,
Contingency Airfield Operations.
12. Special Tactics Squadron (STS)
The STS is a ground, special operations forces maneuver element consisting of several 
special tactics teams (STTs). The primary STS missions are global access,  personnel 
recovery, and battlefield surgical operations. 
Global access includes special reconnaissance or direct action in support of an 
airfield seizure to establish and control temporary lodgments for follow-on actions. 
STTs are comprised of combat controllers, pararescue, special reconnaissance (SR)
teams,  and are augmented with special operations surgical and evacuation teams. 
(For more information on STT augmentation, see Joint Publication 3-05, Special 
Operations.) 
The STT can reconnoiter, survey, establish, and control landing zones; provide 
weather observations and forecasting; and provide battlefield trauma care. These 
forces operate in hostile environments that may be beyond the range of survivability 
limitations of other specialized USAF elements.
Consider quick relief on station with ATC forces to ensure their availability for 
follow-on, emergent combat missions. They employ with airfield seizure forces, 
CRGs, or unilaterally to provide terminal control of an airfield. These teams can 
sustain themselves for limited amounts of time before needing a resupply. Many 
combat control personnel are also qualified as joint terminal attack controllers. The 
highest ranking combat controller or special tactics officer can perform SAA duties.

13. The 820th Base Defense Group
This unit can provide fully integrated, highly capable, FP and response forces to support 
an expeditionary airfield opening. The unit is capable of airborne, air land, or air mobile 
insertion operations for up to 30 days and has the organic capability to provide airfield 
security and an initial airfield security assessment. The unit can partner with initial entry 
or base seizure forces engineering battalion to provide a smooth transition to airfield 
opening and sustainment of forces. 
14. The Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) Airfield Pavement Evaluation
(APE) Team
This team conducts worldwide contingency, sustainment, and permanent level, airfield 
pavement evaluations. The team uses destructive and nondestructive techniques to 
assess pavement weight-bearing capacity and surface conditions. The team can rapidly 
deploy to provide pavement classification numbers and allowable gross load information 
for paved airfield surfaces, and certify airfield pavements up to 50,000 passes. 
Additionally, the team can proof load high-capacity aircraft anchoring systems; 
determine runway surface friction characteristics; and provide technical expertise and 
guidance for designing, repairing, and constructing airfield pavements in support of 
regional conflict operations. Operations support contingency operating locations, aerial 
ports, en route bases, or critical stateside bases; and include support for humanitarian

AIRFIELD ENGINEER FORCE CAPABILITIES
1. Overview
The United States Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force have expeditionary 
engineer capabilities which can construct, rebuild, or maintain airfields in support of a 
commander. This appendix portrays each of these Service’s engineer capabilities and 
how they can support airfield operations. 
2. United States Army Engineer Capabilities
Army Engineers. The Army provides robust engineering planning and command
capability ranging from theater engineer commands led by major generals, to
colonel-level engineer brigades, through engineer battalions organic to maneuver
brigade combat teams. Army engineer support to airfield openings ranges from
providing forward aviation combat engineering operations (as a part of combat
engineering) to planning, constructing or expanding, and maintaining airfields
executing large-scale general engineering tasks. This includes providing geospatial
information and services. Engineer units may be organic to a maneuver element or
part of an airfield seizure team. Combat engineers may provide the following:
Route or area clearance missions in support of airfield or forward arming and 
refueling point operations.
General horizontal and vertical engineering (i.e., runway repair, expansion, 
surveying, and maintenance; and support infrastructure construction and 
maintenance).
Special capabilities, including quarry operations, well drilling, power 
generation, structural firefighting, and diving operations.
 United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). USACE provides technical 
engineering assistance to the operational force using its field force engineering 
capability. Field force engineering draws on USACE capabilities from the engineer 
disciplines (primarily general engineering) to support operations through reachback 
and forward presence. Field force engineering forward presence includes deployable 
teams designed and trained to provide technical engineering support. The USACE 
provides field-force engineering that consists of deployable civilian technical support 
teams and reachback teams to provide base development and technical support 
provided by technically specialized personnel and assets. The USACE provides 
contract horizontal and construction services worldwide. Also, it provides 
contingency, real property estate support teams, procurement and lease program 
management, and environmental support teams.
3. United States Marine Corps (USMC) Engineer Capabilities
USMC engineer capabilities organic to a Marine wing support squadron (MWSS) 
support airfield services and base requirements of the aviation combat element 
(ACE) commander. The engineer company provides general engineering services, 
utilities services, heavy equipment, and material handling equipment services. The 
96

0$5
engineer company also includes a drafting and survey capability to assist in 
designing the layout of airbase facilities and expeditionary airfields. 
MWSS engineer personnel and equipment enable the MWSS commander to 
execute airfield and airbase requirements including:
Construction and maintenance of fuel storage revetments, bunkers, aircraft 
parking areas, and expedient roads. 
Construction, improvement, and maintenance of vertical takeoff and landing 
and vertical short takeoff and landing facilities. 
Technical and equipment assistance for erecting and constructing 
prefabricated structures. 
Repair, improvement, and maintenance of bare-base airfields (e.g., airfield 
damage repair [ADR] or existing roads). 
Mobile electric power, refrigeration, water supply, and hygiene services. 
Limited combat engineer services.  
Soil stabilization and dust mitigation. 
Reinforcement or augmentation become necessary when ACE engineering 
requirements exceed the capability or capacity of the MWSS. Primary augmentation 
will come from organic MAGTF assets including the engineer support battalion or the 
naval construction force (NCF) (e.g., naval mobile construction battalion [NMCB]).
4. United States Navy Engineer Forces
The NCF conducts contingency construction, engineering and combat service
support in support of operational, campaign and engineer support plans across the
spectrum of competition, crisis, and conflict in all environments. The NCF provides
multi-disciplined, general engineering units to the Fleet, Marine expeditionary force,
and JTF commanders capable of operational tactical level C2 of naval, joint and
coalition engineer formation. The NCF’s engineering and construction capabilities for
ADR are executed by the NMCB.
The Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command (NAVFAC) provides the 
NCF engineering reach back capability to obtain a wide range of NAVFAC design 
expertise and construction contracting capability beyond the organic capabilities 
of the NCF.  
The primary mission of the NCF is to provide general engineering 
construction and repair to critical infrastructure in any environment to enable 
freedom of maneuver and sustainment for the Fleet and Marine expeditionary 
force as well as joint and coalition forces. The ability to create or enhance key 
nodes around the globe facilitates sustainment, maneuver, sea control, sea 
denial, and enables projection of lethal combat power.

UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION COMMAND (USTRANSCOM)
JOINT TASK FORCE-PORT OPENING (JTF-PO) CAPABILITIES
“When a joint task force (JTF) arrives to respond to a disaster, it is a behemoth of 
capability compared to all other interagency, international, and nongovernmental 
agencies. The unique capability that makes a JTF valuable is the ability to 
organize and execute logistics operations in a chaotic environment.”
—Colonel James A. Vohr, United States Marine Corps, Director for 
Logistics, J-4, United States Southern Command
1. Overview
The JTF-PO is an enabling force capable of rapid deployment to establish and initially 
operate ports of debarkation, establish a forward distribution node, and optimize port 
throughput. It provides the supported combatant commander (CCDR), joint force 
commander (JFC), and CCDR with an expeditionary aerial port of debarkation (APOD) 
deployment and forward distribution node capability consistent with the single port 
manager concept. The JTF-PO’s capabilities are tailorable to support varying situations 
within the tasking authority’s operational area. For detailed information regarding JTF-
PO roles, responsibilities, and capabilities, see figure 6 for a diagram of JTF-PO 
command and control relationships. See figure 7 for JTF-PO composition.
2. Capabilities
Joint assessment team (JAT) and JTF-PO air and surface elements are ready to 
deploy within 12 hours of unit notification. Subsequent units will be prepared to 
deploy and entered into an alert posture to fulfill any additional taskings within 96 
hours. 
JTF-PO includes the following initial port opening and distribution capabilities: 
Establishes a forward node (FN) not exceeding 10 kilometers from the 
APOD.
Provides movement control, including coordination for onward movement of 
arriving cargo and passengers.
Works a maximum on ground of two C-17 aircraft loads during 24/7 
operations in no- or low-light conditions.
Provides aircraft maintenance support.
Establishes joint in-transit visibility and radio frequency identification network.
Receives, stages, and transloads 560 short tons in a 24-hour period.
Receives and processes 150 passengers every 6 hours.
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA): 
102
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
A DLA rapid deployment team travels with JTF-PO to provide expertise and 
assistance with strategic-level logistics, including warehousing and procurement 
for all classes of supply in support of the assigned mission.
If deployed with JTF-PO, DLA’s rapid deployment team can provide the team 
expeditionary contracting capability and expertise. When deployed with JTF-PO, 
DLA can leverage existing strategic-level contracts, within the theater, to support 
the JFC or help establish provisional contracts to support mission requirements.
JTF-PO Command and Control Relationships
103
JTF-PO Composition
JTF-PO JAT: 
The JAT is the first JTF-PO element to deploy and is responsible for 
conducting an assessment of opening a deployment and distribution network at a 
designated APOD.  
The JAT will provide a go/no-go report to the Commander, USTRANSCOM 
within 4 hours of arrival to the port of debarkation. Additionally, the JAT will work 
with supported forces and agencies to determine which JTF-PO capabilities are 
required to support the mission. The go/no-go report will identify:
(a) If the APOD is able to handle the distribution mission.
(b) If augmentation is required before operations can commence (i.e.,
additional security, runway repair, etc).
(c) If additional time is needed before a decision can be made.
3. Planning
Mission planners should note the following when planning for tasked JTF-PO 
APOD missions: 
JTF-PO forces are ready to deploy within 12 hours (36 hours for ANG).

ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
104
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
If the JAT deploys prior to the main body, it will work with the supported 
forces or agencies to identify the main-body JTF-PO airflow based on mission 
requirements.
JTF-PO is an expeditionary force that will operate for up to 60 days before 
requiring relief by follow-on forces. Therefore, JFC planners must plan for and 
request sufficient forces to replace the JTF-PO enabling capability to ensure 
timely notification and arrival of replacement forces.
Modular and scalable, JTF-PO APOD capabilities are tailored to meet the 
mission requirements and constraints.
The mission planning team should use imagery and work with security forces 
and intelligence sources, during mission analysis, to identify potential threat 
areas. JTF-PO mission planners identify security requirements for APOD access 
and egress, and routes to and from the FN and living areas. Force protection 
measures for JTF-PO are coordinated with the CCDR or JFC.
The JTF-PO APOD is not a standing force and should only be formed when 
the mission dictates. Information on its mission, capabilities, and design is 
located in the USTRANSCOM JTF-PO Standing Execute Order and
USTRANSCOM Instruction 10-27, Volume 2, Joint Task Force Port Opening. 
JTF-PO manages the entire mission: from planning, assessment, and execution 
to redeployment.
Initially, the JTF-PO APOD facilitates joint reception, staging, onward 
movement, integration, and theater distribution by providing near real-time, in-
transit visibility of arriving passengers and cargo and, expeditiously, clears the 
APOD. Such forward distribution node operations are critical components of 
CCDR efforts to establish an effective distribution network within a theater of 
operations.
The JAT will require two C-130s or one C-17 (or equivalent) to deploy into the
theater. Airflow requirements for the JTF-PO main body forces will be shaped by 
mission requirements and constraints.

SERVICE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) RATING AND CREDENTIALS 
1. Overview
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established the Air Traffic Safety Oversight 
Service under the Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety to provide independent 
oversight of the air traffic organization. A key component of this oversight is the 
credentialing program managed by air traffic oversight (AOV). This program covers 
personnel who perform direct safety-related ATC services or certify systems, 
subsystems, or services in support of the National Airspace System (NAS). 
2. Background
Since its origin, Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR), Aeronautics and 
Space, part 65 required ATC tower operators must hold a control tower operator (CTO) 
certificate. In February 2015, 14 CFR, part 65 was amended and persons who hold an 
FAA credential, for the performance of their duties, are no longer required to hold a 
CTO certificate. This amendment formally established the FAA’s transition from the 
CTO program. The purpose of the FAA credentialing and the CTO programs is to 
establish that air traffic controllers possess the requisite skills to do their jobs safely. 
However, the FAA AOV credentialing program is broader than the CTO program and 
includes tower and radar facility ratings. While an FAA credential is comparable to a 
CTO certificate, the two programs are different and require separate administrative 
activities. Credentials play a vital role in assuring the FAA provides the safest, most 
efficient NAS in the world. The credentialing system is a robust online data 
management system designed to maintain FAA credentials for nearly 20,000 air traffic 
controllers, airways transportation system specialists, and managers within air traffic 
organization. Table 14 shows the Service ATC credentials.

AIRFIELD LAYOUT AND CHARACTERISTICS
1. Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design Guidance
The Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) system provides planning, design,
construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization criteria, and applies to the
military departments, the defense agencies, and the Department of Defense (DoD)
field activities. All DoD projects employ UFC. All construction outside the United
States (US) is governed by status-of-forces agreements, host nation funded
construction agreements, and in some instances, bilateral infrastructure agreements.
Ensure compliance with the more stringent of the UFC, status-of-forces agreements,
and bilateral infrastructure agreements, as applicable.
UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, provides standardized
airfield, heliport, and airspace criteria for geometric layout, design, and construction
of runways, landing zones, helipads, taxiways, aprons, and related permanent
facilities to meet sustained operations.
In addition to a local terminal instrument procedures (TERPS) review, existing
facilities modifications, temporary construction, airfield surface modifications,
maintenance or construction requiring equipment on- or near-the-airfield flying
environment, and new facilities construction must be closely coordinated. Coordinate
with the US Air Force major command; US Army Aeronautical Services Agency and
US Army Aeronautical Services Detachment, Europe; and Naval Flight Information
Group to determine the impact to existing and planned instrument approach and
departure procedures. The criterion in UFC 3-260-01 does not address instrument
flight procedures. TERPS evaluations and processes are described in AFI 11-230,
Instrument Procedures; AFMAN 11-225, US Standard Flight Inspection Manual; and
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) JO 8260.3E, US Standard for Terminal
Instrument Procedures. Consider TERPS criteria when designing or modifying
airfields and facilities on instrument flight rules (IFR) airfields.
2. Airfield Facilities
An aviation facility consists of four land-use areas: two airside facilities (landing and 
takeoff areas, aircraft ground movement, and parking areas) and two landside facilities 
(aviation maintenance and aviation operations support areas).
Landing and Takeoff Areas. 
Runways and Helipads. Landing and takeoff areas require either a runway or 
helipad. The landing and takeoff areas consist of the runway and helipad 
surfaces, shoulders, and overruns; the approach slope surfaces, safety 
clearances, and other imaginary airspace surfaces.
(a) Number of Runways. Aviation facilities have only one runway. Additional
runways may be necessary to accommodate operational demands, minimize
adverse wind conditions, or overcome environmental impacts.
108
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
(b) Number of Helipads. Sometimes at airfields or heliports, a large number
of helicopters are parked on mass aprons or are in the process of takeoff and
landing. When this occurs, there is a requirement to provide landing and
takeoff facilities that permit more rapid launch and recovery operations than
can otherwise be provided by a single runway or helipad. Increase efficiency
by providing one or more of the following options. These are not the only
options.
x Multiple helipads, hover points, or runways.
x Rotary-wing runways in excess of 480 meters (1600 feet) long.
x Landing lanes.
Runway Location. Runway location is paramount to airport safety, efficiency, 
economics, practicality, and environmental impact. The degree of concern given 
to each factor influencing runway location greatly depends on obstructions to air 
navigation, airspace availability, and runway orientation, 
(a) Obstructions to Air Navigation. The runway must have approaches that
are free of obstructions. Plan runways so the ultimate airport development
provides unobstructed navigation. Conduct a survey of obstructions to identify
objects that may affect aircraft operations.
(b) Airspace Availability. Existing and planned instrument approach and
departure procedures, control zones, and special use airspace and traffic
patterns influence airfield layouts and runway locations. Construction projects
for new airfields and heliports, or construction projects on existing airfields,
have the potential to affect airspace. These projects require notification to the
applicable airspace control authority to examine feasibility for conformance
with, and acceptability into, the theater airspace system.
(c) Runway Orientation. Wind direction and velocity are major considerations
for determining runway sites. To be functional, efficient, and safe, the runway
should be oriented in alignment with the prevailing winds, to the greatest
extent practical, to provide favorable wind coverage. Use wind data (obtained
from local sources) for a period of not less than five years, as a basis for
developing the wind rose shown on the airfield general site plan.
Runway and Helipad Separation. The type of aircraft the runway serves 
dictates the lateral separation of a runway from a parallel runway, or parallel 
taxiway, helipad, or hover point. UFC 3-260-01 contains runway and helipad 
separation criteria.
Airfield Markings. Airfield marking is an invaluable form of nonverbal 
communication to aircrew and ground crew alike. Proper marking and lighting 
allows safe operation of aircraft and ground vehicles throughout the airfield.
Runway markings differ from a VFR only runway to an IFR runway to a precision 
approach runway. For more information, refer to UFC 3-260-04, Airfield and 
Heliport Markings.

(a) Airfield lighting is required for operations at night and complements
airfield markings. There are varying levels of airfield lighting including using
overt and covert lights. Standard tactical lighting schemes for airfields are
contained in  or DAFMAN 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations.
(b) For permanent, long term airfields refer to UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air
Navigation Facilities and FAA AC 150/5340-30J, Design and Installation
Details for Airport Visual Aids.
Runway Instrumentation Navigation Aids (NAVAIDs) are integral parts of an 
airfield. Consider NAVAID location,  and grading requirements of a NAVAID 
when locating and designing runways, taxiways, aprons, and other airfield 
facilities. UFC 3-260-01, includes a list of design documents governing NAVAIDs 
and lighting and the agency for obtaining site position and design information. 
(a) NAVAIDs require land areas of specific sizes, shapes, and grades to
function properly and remain clear of safety areas. NAVAIDs assist the pilot in
flight and during landing. Instrumented runway studies dictate the type of air
NAVAIDs installed at an aviation facility.
(b) Remote or standalone landing sites may require a lighting equipment
vault for airfields and heliport facilities with NAVAIDS.
(c) Airfields with NAVAIDs require a NAVAIDs building. A separate facility
houses each type of NAVAIDs equipment. UFC 3-260-01 lists technical
advice and guidance for air NAVAIDs.
Aircraft Ground Movement and Parking Areas. These consist of taxiways and 
aircraft parking aprons.
Taxiways. Taxiways provide free ground movement to and from runways, 
helipads, maintenance, cargo, passenger, and other areas of the aviation facility. 
The objective of taxiway system planning is to create a smooth traffic flow. This 
system allows unobstructed ground visibility; a minimum number of changes in 
aircraft taxiing speed; and, ideally, the shortest distance between the runways or 
helipads and apron areas.
(a) Taxiway System. The taxiway system is comprised of entrance and exit
taxiways; bypass, crossover taxiways; apron taxiways and taxi lanes; hangar
access taxiways; and partial-parallel, full-parallel, and dual-parallel taxiways.
UFC 3-260-01, chapter 5provides design and layout dimensions for various
taxiways.
(b) Taxiway Capacity. At airfields with high levels of activity, the capacity of
the taxiway system can become the limiting operational factor. Enhance or
improve runway capacity and access efficiency by installing parallel taxiways.
Provide a full-length parallel taxiway for a single runway, with connecting
lateral taxiways, to permit rapid entrance and exit of traffic between the apron
and the runway. At facilities with low air traffic density, a partial-parallel
taxiway or mid-length exit taxiway may suit local requirements. Develop plans
for construction of a full-parallel taxiway when such a taxiway is justified.

ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
(c) Runway Exit Criteria. The number, type, and location of exit taxiways are
functions of the required runway capacity. Provide exit taxiways at the ends
and in the center and midpoint on the runway. Provide additional locations, as
necessary, to allow landing aircraft to exit the runway quickly.
(d) Dual-Use Facility Taxiways. Apply fixed-wing criteria for taxiways at
airfields supporting fixed- and rotary-wing operations.
(e) Paved Taxiway Shoulders. Paved taxiway shoulders reduce the effects of
jet blast on areas adjacent to the taxiway. Paved taxiway shoulders help
reduce ingestion of foreign object debris into jet intakes.
(f) Traffic Deconfliction. Establish a controlled movement area to deconflict
ground and aircraft traffic.
Aircraft Parking Aprons. Aircraft parking aprons are the paved areas required 
for aircraft parking, loading, unloading, and servicing. They include the necessary 
maneuvering area for access into and exit out of parking positions. Design 
aprons to permit safe and controlled movement of aircraft under their own power. 
Mission requirements dictate aircraft apron dimensions and size. DAFMAN 32-
1084, Facility Requirements, Section D, Apron Criteria, provides additional 
information concerning Air Force aprons.
(a) Requirement. Individually design aprons to support specific aircraft and
missions at specific facilities. The size of a parking apron depends on the type
and number of aircraft authorized. UFC 3-260-01, chapter 6 provides
additional information on apron requirements.
(b) Location. Aircraft parking aprons are located between the parallel taxiway
and the hangar line. The apron location, with regard to airfield layout, will
adhere to the operations and safety clearances provided in UFC 3-260-01,
chapter 6.
(c) Capacity. Information in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 2; UFC 2-
000-05N, Facility Planning Criteria for Navy/Marine Corps Shore Installations,
Appendix E, Airfield Safety Clearances; and DAFMAN 32-1084, Standard
Facility Requirements, discuss aircraft parking capacity.
(d) Clearances. Provide lateral clearances for parking aprons from all sides
of aprons to fixed and mobile objects.
(e) Access Taxi Lanes, Entrances, and Exits. UFC 3-260-01, chapter 6
provides the dimensions for access taxi lanes on aircraft parking aprons. Two
should be the minimum number of exit and entrance taxiways provided for
any parking apron.
(f) Aircraft Parking Schemes. Park aircraft in rows on a mass parking apron.
The recommended tactical or fighter aircraft parking arrangement is to park
aircraft at 45-degree angles. This is the most economical parking method for
achieving the clearance needed to dissipate jet blast temperatures and
velocities to levels that will not endanger aircraft or personnel. (For the Navy,
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
111
these are 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) and 56 kilometers per 
hour (35 miles per hour) at breakaway (intermediate power).  
(g) Departure Sequencing. Establish formal aircraft egress patterns from
aircraft parking positions to the apron exit taxiways to prevent congestion at
the apron exits. For example, aircraft departing from one row of parking
positions should taxi to one exit taxiway; simultaneously, allowing other rows
to taxi to a different exit.
(h) Army and Navy Aprons. Three categories of aircraft parking aprons exist:
unit, general purpose, and special purpose. Base the category on the facility’s
mission support requirement. The following information explains the
categories.
x Unit Parking Apron. The unit parking category supports fixed- and
rotary-wing aircraft assigned to the facility.
x General Purpose Apron. This is an aviation facility anticipating
transient parking with no tenant units assigned and provides a
personnel loading apron or aircraft general-purpose apron in lieu of a
mass parking apron.
x Special Purpose Apron. Provide special purpose aprons for specific
operations, such as safe areas for arming and disarming aircraft and
other specific mission requirements that demand separation of, or
distinct handling procedures for, aircraft.
Aircraft Maintenance Area. An aircraft maintenance area is required when 
regularly performing aircraft maintenance at an aviation facility. Base the space 
requirements for maintenance facilities on aircraft type.
Aircraft Maintenance Facilities. The aircraft maintenance facility includes the 
following. (The aircraft maintenance areas include utilities, roadways, fencing, 
security facilities, and lighting.)
(a) Aircraft maintenance hangars.
(b) Special purpose hangars.
(c) Hangar access aprons.
(d) Weapons system support shops.
(e) Aircraft system testing and repair shops.
(f)
Aircraft parts storage.
(g) Corrosion control facilities.
(h) Special purpose maintenance pads.
Air Force and Navy Aviation Maintenance Buildings. For aviation
maintenance building information, see DAFMAN 32-1084 (Air Force), or UFC 4-
211-01, Aircraft Maintenance Hangars: Type I, Type II and Type III, (Navy).
112
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68
0$5
Army Aviation Maintenance Buildings. 
Apron Lighting. Provide apron area lighting (floodlights) when aircraft 
movement, maintenance, and security are required at night and during poor 
visibility. The amount of apron space or number of aircraft positions that receive 
active use during nighttime operations determines the type of lighting required.
Security. The hangar line represents the boundary of the airfield operations 
area. Maintenance buildings should be located close together to discourage 
unauthorized access and enhance facility security.
Aviation Operations Support Area.
Aviation Operations Support Facilities. Aviation operations support facilities 
include facilities that directly support the flying mission. Operations support 
includes the following.
(a) Air traffic control (ATC).
(b) Aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF).
(c) Fueling facilities.
(d) The airfield operations center and airfield management facility.
(e) Squadron operations and aircraft maintenance units.
(f) Munitions staging.
(g) Air mobility operations groups.
Location. Aviation operations support facilities should be located along the
hangar line, with the central area allocated to airfield operations (i.e., airfield 
management facility), ATC, ARFF, and flight simulation. Aircraft maintenance 
facilities should be located on one side of the runway to allow simplified access 
among maintenance areas, aircraft, and support areas.
Orientation of Facilities. Facilities located either parallel or perpendicular to 
the runway use space most efficiently. Diagonal and curved orientations tend to 
divide an area and result in awkward or unusable spaces.
Multiple Supporting Facilities. When multiple aviation units are located at one 
facility, retain their integrity by locating the units adjacent to each other.
Transient Facilities. Make provisions for transient and very important person 
aprons and buildings. These facilities should be located near the aviation 
operations supporting facilities.
Other Support Facilities. When required, site other support facilities (such as 
aviation fuel storage and dispensing, heating plants, water storage, consolidated 
parts storage, and motor pools) on the far side of an access road parallel to the 
hangar line.
Aircraft Fuel Storage and Dispensing.
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
113
(a) Location. Provide aircraft fuel storage and dispensing facilities at all
aviation facilities. Provide operating fuel storage tanks wherever dispensing
facilities are remotely located from bulk storage. Bulk fuel storage areas
require locations that are accessible by tanker truck, tanker rail car, or
watercraft. Provide space for parking and loading vehicles used to service
aircraft within the bulk and operating storage areas.
(b) Safety. Fuel storage and operating areas have requirements for minimum
clearances from buildings, aircraft parking, roadways, radar, and other
structures or areas, as established in Service directives. Aviation fuel storage
and operating areas also require lighting, fencing, and security alarms. All
liquid fuel storage facility locations must address spill containment and leak
protection and detection.
Roadways to Support Airfield Activities.
(a) General. Vehicular roads on airfields should not cross or be within the
lateral clearance distance for runways, high-speed taxiways, and dedicated
taxiways for alert pads. This will prevent normal vehicular traffic from
obstructing aircraft in transit. Roads should be located so surface vehicles will
not be hazards to air navigation and air navigation equipment.
(b) Rescue and Firefighting Roadways. Provide rescue and firefighting
access roads for unimpeded, two-way access for rescue and firefighting
equipment to potential mishap areas. Connecting these access roads to the
airfield operational surfaces and other airfield roads, to the greatest practical
extent, will enhance fire and rescue operations. Dedicated rescue and
firefighting access roads are all-weather roads designed to support vehicles
traveling at normal response speeds.
(c) Fuel Truck Access. Fuel truck access points to aircraft parking aprons
should be located to provide minimal disruptions and hazards to active aircraft
movement areas. Fuel truck access from the facility boundary to fuel storage
areas should be separate from other vehicular traffic. Park fuel trucks as
close to the flight line as is reasonably possible.
(d) Explosives and Munitions Transfer to Arm and Disarm Pads. Transfer
explosives and munitions from storage areas to arm and disarm pads on
dedicated transfer roads (i.e., roads used exclusively by explosives and
munitions transfer vehicles).
Navy and Marine Corps Exemptions from Waivers. Certain NAVAIDs and 
operational aids are placed at sites in violation of airspace clearance to operate 
effectively. The following aids are within this group and require no waiver if they 
are positioned at sites in accordance UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air Navigation 
Facilities, or UFC 3-535-02, Design Drawings for Visual Air Navigation Facilities. 
(a) Approach lighting systems.
(b) Visual approach slope indicator systems.
(c) Precision approach path indicator systems.

(d) Permanent optical lighting system and portable optical lighting system
(e) Runway distance markers.
(f) Arresting gear systems, including arresting gear signs.
(g) Taxiway guidance, holding, and orientation signs.
(h) All beacons and obstruction lights.
(i) Arming and de-arming pad.
3. Service Requirements
When criteria in UFC 3-260-01 differ among the Services, the criteria for the specific 
Service are noted in the following paragraphs. For the Air Force, the airfield manager 
must sign all work orders processed for work within the airfield environment before it 
may proceed, in accordance with UFC 3-260-01, paragraph 1-8, “USAF Work Order 
Coordination and Authorization.” 
Theater of Operations. Standards for theater-of-operations facilities are contained 
in US Army technical manual (TM) 3-34.48-1, Theater of Operations: Roads, 
Airfields, and Heliports-Road Design, TM 3-34-48-2, Theater of Operations: Roads, 
Airfields, and Heliports-Airfield and Heliport Design, and UFC 3-260-01, section 7 for 
C-17 and C-130 landing zones. The information in UFC 3-260-01, section 7
supersedes the information in the field manual.
Security Considerations for Design. Regulatory requirements for asset security 
can significantly influence airfield and heliport planning and design. The arms, 
ammunition, explosives, and electronic devices associated with aircraft, and the 
aircraft themselves, require varying types and levels of protection. Operational 
security of the airfield is also a consideration. 
Integrating Security Measures. Integrate protective features into the airfield 
planning and design process to minimize problems with aircraft operations and 
safety requirements. These include barriers, fences, lighting, access control, 
intrusion detection, and assessment. (UFC 3-260-01, chapter 2 and UFC 4-010-
01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, provide more 
discussion.) The protective measures should be included in the design based on 
risk and threat analyses with an appropriate level of protection, or should comply 
with security-related requirements. 
Security-Related Requirements. A detailed discussion of security-related 
requirements is beyond the scope of UFC 3-260-01. Designers should refer to 
Service security regulations for planning and design guidance. 
4. Bare-Base Airfields
A bare-base airfield is a site with a usable runway, taxiway, parking areas, and
source of potable water. It must be capable of supporting assigned aircraft and
providing other mission-essential resources, such as a logistical support and
services and an infrastructure composed of people, facilities, equipment, and
supplies. This concept requires mobile facilities, utilities, and support equipment that
can be deployed and installed rapidly.
0$5
ATP 3-17.2/MCRP 3-20B.1/NTTP 3-02.18/AFTTP 3-2.68 
115
The bare-base concept is more important than ever before. Many 
underdeveloped, foreign nations resist development of major fixed installations on 
their soil. However, these underdeveloped nations may have runways, taxiways, and 
air terminal facilities to offer US forces during contingency situations. US forces must 
be able to transform undeveloped real estate into an operational airbase virtually 
overnight.
There are approximately 1,200 bare-base airfields in the world that could support 
air operations, although many bare bases are limited and inadequate. Since most 
underdeveloped nations are subject to aggression, the military must be able to 
deploy and operate from their own facilities. 
During contingency operations, efficient and effective use of limited airfield 
capacity and resources is often critical to a successful military response. The task is 
complicated when foreign airfields are hosts to a variety of allied military, 
nongovernmental organizations, and commercial air activities. To achieve a unity of 
effort for airfield operations, there should always be a senior airfield authority 
appointed for each airfield.
Figure 7 is an example of a layout that depicts how airbase functions can be 
layered around an airfield to balance operations, support, and security 
considerations. The layout serves as a sketch and provides a guideline for setting up 
operations in a way that allows the mission to continue while minimizing disruptions 
as the base and airfield develop and expand.
