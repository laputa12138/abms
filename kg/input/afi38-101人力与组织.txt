      Washington, DC 20330-1040 
SUBJECT:  Air Force Guidance Memorandum (AFGM) to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 38-101, 
Manpower and Organization 
By order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance Memorandum (AFGM) 
immediately implements changes to AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization.  Compliance with this 
guidance memorandum is mandatory.  To the extent the guidance memorandum’s directions are 
inconsistent with other Department of the Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in 
accordance with DAFMAN 90-161, Publishing Processes and Procedures.  This guidance memorandum 
is applicable to Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard. 
This memorandum provides updated language in AFI 38-101 (see attachment) renaming all 
USAF Vice Commanders to Deputy Commanders.  This will improve the clarity of the USAF structure 
and result in the same title being used across all USAF organizational levels.  This change is effective 1 
Aug 23.  USSF Vice Commanders and USAF Vice Commanders assigned to USSF units are unaffected 
by this change. 
Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in 
accordance with AFI 33-322, Records Management and Information Governance Program, and disposed 
of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located in the Air Force Records 
Management System.   
This memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this memorandum, 
or upon incorporation by interim change to, or rewrite of AFI 38-101,  
whichever is earlier.

Attachment 
Renaming USAF Vice Commanders to Deputy Commanders 
(Replace) 25.3.1.2. Deputy Commander or Vice Commander. Department of the Air Force 
organizations will use these terms to denote an officer who shares a Commander's duties and 
acts for the Commander during the Commander's absence at group level and above (or USSF 
equivalent organizations). (T-1)  If eligible, and the officer properly assumes or is appointed to 
command under the provisions of AFI 51-509, a Deputy Commander or Vice Commander may 
exercise all command authority during the assigned Commander’s absence.  The office symbol 
code for Deputy Commander is CD and for Vice Commander (USSF only) is CV.  USAF will 
exclusively use the term “Deputy Commander” for officers assigned to USAF organizations. 
(T-1) 
(Replace) 25.3.1.2.1. Where the USAF or USSF is the “lead Service” at a joint base, the officer 
(irrespective of the branch of Military Service) designated the "Deputy Joint Base Commander" 
will perform the functions of the Vice Commander (USSF installations only) or Deputy 
Commander at wing level (or equivalent). (T-1) 
(Delete) 25.3.1.4.

MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS AND AUTHORIZATIONS 
1.1.  Overview directive principles and guidance.  Manpower is a resource and this instruction 
defines processes for planning and determining manpower requirements and authorizations.  It 
explains overseas ceilings, grade and end-strength constraints, and provides Air Force specific 
guidance on the proper utilization of manpower.  It provides guidance requirements and procedures 
for management and development of mission directives and clarifies Department of Defense 
guidance to ensure the efficient use of Air Force manpower resources.

program changes, responsive to crisis situations and new management strategies. (T-1). 
1.1.3.  AF/A1M will review new policies, including fiscal policy, to evaluate its impact on 
manpower and personnel performance. (T-1).  AF/A1M will periodically assess existing 
policies, procedures, and structures to ensure efficient and effective use of manpower 
resources. (T-1). 
1.1.4.  Manpower requirements are workload-driven and will be established at the minimum 
levels necessary to execute mission and performance objectives. (T-1). 
1.1.5.  Changes in manpower will be preceded by changes to the policies, programs, missions, 
and processes requiring manpower resources. (T-1). 
1.1.6.  Manpower requirements for business processes must be maintained at the lowest 
possible proportion of the Total Force structure. (T-1).  Manpower in support of war-fighting 
processes will be maintained at the lowest level practicable to optimize combat capability 
within the operating forces. (T-1). 
1.1.7.  Assigned missions must use the least costly mix of personnel (military, civilian, and 
contract) consistent with military requirements and needs of the Air Force. (T-1). 
1.1.8.  Inherently governmental functions will not be contracted. (T-1). 
1.1.9.  Manpower authorities must consider all available sources when determining workforce 
mix to include the Regular Air Force and Air Reserve Component (Air Reserve Component) 
military manpower, United States and foreign national civilian manpower, intragovernmental, 
contract, and host-nation support. (T-1). 
1.1.10.  Manpower will be designated as civilian except when military incumbency is required 
for reasons of law, Command and Control of crisis situations, combat readiness, or esprit de 
corps; when unusual working conditions are not conducive to civilian employment; or when 
military-unique knowledge and skills are required to perform the duties. (T-1).  Manpower 
authorities shall designate sufficient manpower to provide a rotation base for military 
personnel and for civilian employees assigned outside the United States. (T-1).  Furthermore, 
when designating management positions as military or civilian, career opportunities for both 
categories of personnel shall be considered. (T-1).

Chapter 3 
WORKFORCE MIX 
3.1.  Overview.  This chapter details the types of manpower used to carry out Air Force missions 
and provides the tools for determining the appropriate workforce mix and private sector support 
with applicable laws and policies.  DoDI 1100.22 provides guidance and procedures for 
determining the workforce mix of each function.  DoDI 1100.22 has a decision matrix for 
determining the workforce mix to the function level. 
3.2.  Types of Manpower.  The Air Force uses three kinds of manpower to do required work: (1) 
military personnel, (2) in-Service civilian employees, and (3) contracted services. 
3.3.  Military Essentiality. 
3.3.1.  Requires military-unique knowledge and skills needed for the performance of duties. 
3.3.2.  Requires military incumbency by law. 
3.3.3.  Requires military performance for command and control, risk mitigation, or esprit de 
corps. 
3.3.4.  Provides overseas rotation for career development, or wartime assignments. 
3.3.5.  Mitigates unusual working conditions or costs which are not conducive to civilian 
employment. 
3.4.  Non-Military Essential.  Use in-Service civilian employees or contract services for work 
that does not meet the requirements of military essentiality. 
3.5.  Workforce Mix. 
3.5.1.  Military Essentiality.  Military essentiality is the initial mission criteria considered to 
identify the correct workforce mix. 
3.5.2.  Military Essential Work.  If current authorized civilian positions become military 
essential, convert the civilian positions to military positions through attrition unless mission 
requirements dictate a faster conversion.  Coordinate any conversion in activities affecting 
ANG force training with the National Guard Bureau and Air Force Reserve conversions with 
Air Force Reserve Command. 
3.5.3.  Non-Military Essential Work.  Use in-Service civilian employees or contract services 
to perform work not requiring military personnel. Work center capability may be maintained 
by using the residual military, including individual mobilization augmentees, or by realigning 
other civilian positions. 
3.5.4.  In work centers where civilian authorizations have been abolished as a result of a 
civilian reduction in force, MAJCOMs may not re-assign permanent or overage military 
personnel to perform the tasks formerly accomplished by reduction-in-forced in-service 
civilian employees.

Chapter 4 
FACTORS AND ROUNDING RULES 
4.1.  Overview.  The Air Force uses various manpower availability factors to define and quantify 
the number of full-time equivalents a given activity requires regarding man-hours.  Dividing the 
man-hours earned from applying a manpower standard by the appropriate manpower availability 
factor and overload factor results in full-time equivalents. 
4.2.  Man-hour Availability Factor.  A manpower availability factor is an average number of 
man-hours a month an assigned individual is available to do primary duties.  The factor 
computations account for time away from the work center related to leave, medical care, education, 
and training (other than on the job training), permanent change of station, and organizational 
duties.  Foreign national factors reflect host nation–unique non availability.  Use Air Force–
approved foreign national manpower availability factors as appropriate to include special 
workweeks.  MAJCOM/A1Ms send requests for new factors to Air Force Manpower Analysis 
Agency for review.  Each request must contain detailed justification and supporting data for the 
new factor and describe the circumstances and personnel availability policies. (T-1). 
4.3.  Overload Factor.    The overload factor is usually applied along with specific manpower 
availability factors when applying manpower determinants and ensures efficient use of manpower 
authorizations.  The overload factor realizes Air Force leadership expectation that some overtime 
is a useful tool instead of adding more manpower requirements. 
4.4.  Various Overload Factors. 
4.4.1.  Overload factor of 7.7 is applied to all mixed work centers, all military work centers 
and civilian only work centers with one - six civilian positions. 
4.4.2.  Use the 4.0 percent overload factor for the extended overseas 48-hour workweek. 
4.4.3.  Use the 1.2 percent overload factor for the wartime sustained and wartime contingency 
60-hour workweek. 
4.4.4.  Do not apply the overload factors against wartime surge, firefighter, United States Air 
Force Academy faculty, or foreign national civilian workweeks. 
4.4.5.  Rounding rules for converting man-hours to fractional manpower. 
4.4.5.1.  For United States direct hire civilians in work centers with one to six civilian 
positions, apply the overload factor then round fractional manpower up to the next whole 
number. 
4.4.5.2.  For United States direct hire civilians in work centers with more than six civilian 
positions do not use overload factor and use normal rounding rules (less than .5 round 
down). 
4.4.5.3.  For military (use overload factor) and foreign national civilians, round manpower 
results to three decimal places and then round any fractional manpower up to the next 
whole number.

Chapter 5 
DETERMINING MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS 
5.1.  Overview.  By definition, manpower requirements quantify full-time equivalents needed to 
perform a job, mission, or program. 
5.1.1.  Manpower positions are documented as funded manpower authorizations or unfunded 
manpower requirements. 
5.1.2.  The Air Force considers manpower a resource to support approved programs.  
Manpower is not a program to manipulate apart from the programs it supports.  Manpower is 
a limited resource reflecting the minimum essential level to do required work. 
5.2.  General Information. 
5.2.1.  Regular Air Force manpower planning and programming activities are centralized at 
Headquarters Air Force where national security policy is translated into force structure 
programs. Execution is decentralized to Major Commands and certain field operating agencies 
where budget and resource allocations are translated into command programs and units.  The 
Management Engineering Program provides manpower determinants to help commanders 
determine manpower requirements. 
5.2.2.  Base manpower requirements are based on Air Force, Major Command, or National 
Guard Bureau directives. 
5.2.3.  Headquarters Air Force functional area managers and Air Force Career Field Managers 
will provide resources for manpower studies directed by the Air Force Corporate Structure. 
(T-1). Functional managers will not make manpower mix decisions without coordination from 
AF/A1M, this includes services provided by private sector contractors. (T-1).  For Major 
Command-level manpower studies, Major Command Functional Managers will provide 
resources for manpower studies directed by Air Force Corporate Structure or Major Command 
Commander (MAJCOM CC). (T-1). 
5.2.4.  Manpower study teams will not release preliminary results, manpower estimates, or 
manpower requirements without leadership approval from the Air Force Manpower Analysis 
Agency Commander (AFMAA/CC). (T-2). 
5.2.5.  AFMAA/CC approves manpower determinants applicable to the Regular Air Force and 
those that also apply to the Air Reserve Component, such as wartime manpower determinants, 
whether applicable to multiple commands, a single command, or a single location.  NGB/A1M 
and AFRC/A1M approve manpower determinants affecting the ANG and Air Force Reserve 
units. 
5.3.  Management Engineering Program. 
5.3.1.  The Management Engineering Program provides the framework for developing Air 
Force manpower determinants and analysis tools to identify the minimum manpower required 
to carry out approved missions. 
5.3.2.  Manpower determinants are developed per AFMAN 38-208 Vol. 1, Air Force 
Management Engineering (MEP) - Processes.

Chapter 6 
MANAGING MANPOWER POSITIONS 
6.1.  Overview.  Manpower activities maintain manpower positions by systematically applying 
available manpower determinants, process quality control, and various reviews. 
6.2.  A1M Staffs.    AF/A1M, AFRC/A1M, and NGB/A1M staff may independently execute these 
common activities. 
6.2.1.  Issues guidance for disposition of authorizations more than applied manpower 
determinants.  For the Regular Air Force, the applying wing may keep and redistribute excess 
authorizations unless otherwise specified in advance by their parent command or AF/A1M.  
For the ANG, excess resources will be returned per the ANG Corporate Process to be applied 
to ANG corporate priorities. (T-1). 
6.2.2.  Provides guidance or clarification on methods or procedures not otherwise specified in 
this instruction. 
6.2.3.  Prepares and disseminates a master study schedule for their respective Component.  The 
schedule forecasts studies for five fiscal years and is updated every six months. 
6.2.4.  Maintains an up-to-date web-based repository of all active and historical manpower 
determinants and studies for their respective Component. 
6.2.5.  Establishes internal controls to ensure all products in the active repository are current 
and usable. 
6.2.6.  Certifies all manpower determinants are current and usable at least every 5 years or 
removes them from the active repository. 
6.2.7.  Documents  the certification on the manpower determinants cover page. If notified 
products may be obsolete or incorrect, takes prompt action to resolve the status. 
6.2.8.  Posts all schedules on the respective Component’s website. 
6.2.9.  Provides guidance on methods and procedures not otherwise specified in this 
instruction. 
6.3.  Major Command Manpower and Organization (MAJCOM/A1M) will: 
6.3.1.  Ensure overall compliance, accuracy, and currency of all manpower data in the 
Manpower Programming and Execution System (see Attachment 2) for their Command. (T-
1). 
6.3.2.  Apply all manpower determinants at least once every three years per Air Force 
Manpower Analysis Agency or as directed by AF/A1M, or as significant mission changes 
warrant. (T-1). 
6.3.3.  Direct subordinate manpower activities to apply manpower determinants, but the 
Command keeps accountability for their completion. (T-1). 
6.4.  Servicing Manpower Activity will: 
6.4.1.  Apply manpower determinants as directed by their parent MAJCOM/A1Ms, or as 
significant mission changes warrant. (T-2). 
26 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
6.4.2.  Help supported units prepare manpower change requests. (T-2). 
6.4.3.  Evaluate manpower change requests for policy compliance, resource impact, unit type 
code impact, and possible impact on other position attributes and coordinates the request with 
local functional managers, as applicable. (T-2). 
6.5.  Applying Manpower Determinants. 
6.5.1.  Apply manpower determinants per instructions in the standard or as otherwise directed. 
6.5.2.  Make changes to unfunded positions and resource-neutral funded positions effective 
immediately. 
6.5.3.  If determinant application results in changes to authorized position populations, the 
Manpower Serving Activity will follow standing Command or AF/A1M guidance per 
Manpower Guidance Memorandum located on the AF/A1M SharePoint ™. (T-2). 
6.6.  Manpower Change Requests. 
6.6.1.  Manpower change requests affect the population, distribution, composition of 
manpower requirements, programs, and organization in the Manpower Programming and 
Execution System. 
6.6.2.  Authorities to send Manpower Change Requests.  Commanders or designated approval 
officials are the release authority to submit manpower change requests for their unit and any 
subordinate units.  If delegated, they will identify the subordinate authority to the servicing 
manpower activity. (T-1). 
6.6.3.  Authority for Change Action.  Air Force directives define manpower requirements. 
Program allocation, distribution, and risk management shape the requirements.  A valid 
requirement must drive all manpower changes. (T-1). 
6.6.4.  Follow this guidance to submit a Manpower Change Request: 
6.6.4.1.  Change Action.  Briefly describe the requested action. 
6.6.4.2.  Change Rationale.  The rationale is often the only information available to a 
reviewing and approving authority evaluating the request.  Provide enough justification 
that an independent party can adequately evaluate. 
6.6.4.3.  Coordination Requirements.  The proper functional authority must review changes 
affecting specific resources. (T-1). 
6.6.4.3.1.  Program Element Code.  The Department of Defense uses program elements 
in the Future Year Defense Program to budget for and control its resources.  Evaluate 
actions affecting this attribute for effect to the program. Some constraints could limit 
or prohibit changing this attribute.  For change requests initiated below the Command, 
servicing manpower activities contact the MAJCOM/A1M staff to coordinate the 
change request to the appropriate staff division to assess the feasibility of the action 
before sending the change request to the command.  MAJCOM/A1M staff reviews all 
other requests affecting this attribute. 
6.6.4.3.2.  Resource Identifier Code.  Apply the same considerations to evaluate the 
program element code. 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
27 
6.6.4.3.3.  Air Force Specialty Code.  Servicing manpower activities coordinate 
changes with local specialty functional, if applicable.  MAJCOM/A1Ms coordinate all 
specialty changes with the appropriate Major Command Functional Manager.  Also, 
include Air Force specialty code changes on civilian positions to assess the effect to 
any occupational series codes. 
6.6.4.3.4.  Military Grade.  MAJCOM/A1Ms coordinate all changes to military grades 
with the Major Command Functional Manager (for impact on specialty lifecycle 
management) for command grade limit compliance.  Servicing manpower activities 
will contact the MAJCOM/A1M to assess actions resulting in overall growth in any 
grade, regardless of specialty, for feasibility before sending the change request to the 
command. (T-1). 
6.6.4.3.5.  Funded Civilian Position.  Coordinate all change requests affecting unit, 
office symbol, Air Force specialty of funded civilian positions with the servicing 
civilian personnel activity for effect on position descriptions and the encumbered 
employees. 
6.6.4.3.6.  Resource Neutral Actions.  All manpower changes are resource neutral 
unless authorized by the MAJCOM/A1M.  Offset any action resulting in an increase or 
decrease of an accountable resource with a comparable resource.  Servicing manpower 
activities contact their parent MAJCOM/A1M for authority to send imbalance change 
requests. 
6.7.  Unit Manpower Document Maintenance. 
6.7.1.  MAJCOM/A1Ms will perform deliberate database review using various review 
processes. (T-1). 
6.7.1.1.  AF/A1M or Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency will schedule recurring review 
of high-interest attribute codes. (T-1). 
6.7.1.2.  Manpower activities at all levels will conduct attribute code reviews during the 
manpower change process. (T-1).  Review all position attributes for accuracy and currency 
when adding or changing manpower positions. 
6.7.1.3.  Manpower authority may perform targeted attribute reviews for specific 
specialties or units.

AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
Chapter 7 
MANAGING CIVILIAN POSITIONS 
7.1.  Overview.   Civilian positions are a result of workforce mix or budgetary decisions.  They 
balance mission needs with economy and efficiency of operations.  Civilian positions are not 
military essential but may be inherently governmental or exempt commercial activities.  (See DoDI 
1100.22 for guidelines on determining workforce mix.)   Civilian positions may exist in 
commercial activities because they are determined by a study or determined for in house cost 
effectiveness. 
7.1.1.  Civilian positions are a result of the statutory expenditure of civilian pay appropriations.  
The Future Years Defense Program allocations capture expenditure of appropriations.  All 
manpower activities must be deliberate and prudent in determining and managing civilian 
positions. (T-1).  (See AFI 36-1401, Civilian Position Classification, for other responsibilities 
for developing, managing, and classifying position descriptions.) 
7.1.2.  AF/A1M takes necessary actions to transfer civilian grade and occupation series data 
from civilian personnel to the Manpower Programming and Execution System (see Attachment 
2). 
7.1.3.  In accordance with AFI 36-129, Civilian Personnel Management and Administration, 
the Wing Commander/civilian equivalent (or designated representative) chairs the base level 
Human Capital Resource Management Board, which includes functional managers, and 
representatives from Civilian Personnel, Financial Management and Force Support Manpower 
and Organization Flight.  MAJCOM A1Ms likewise as an advising member support the Human 
Capital Resource Management Board at the MAJCOM level. 
7.1.4.  The servicing manpower activity is a member of the corporate board, and will assist 
with managing civilian positions on the Unit Manpower Document. In accordance with AFI 
36-129, the servicing manpower activity will: 
7.1.4.1.  Monitor civilian position data in the Manpower Programming and Execution 
System for their supported units. (T-2). 
7.1.4.2.  Coordinate manpower change actions that affect funded civilian positions with the 
servicing civilian personnel activity. (T-2). 
7.1.4.3.  Review new and revised position descriptions for consistency with the position’s 
Air Force specialty and skill level, function, organizational placement, and any other 
position-defining attribute. (T-2). 
7.1.4.4.  Work with supervisors and servicing civilian personnel activities to resolve 
disparities between position descriptions and position requirements. (T-2). 
7.1.5.  Servicing Civilian Personnel Activity. 
7.1.5.1.  Reviews and coordinates manpower change requests for impacts that may 
adversely affect position classification or encumbered positions. 
7.1.5.2.  Sends requests for personnel action that might affect position description 
classification to the servicing manpower activity for coordination before taking any 
classification or staffing actions. 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
29 
7.1.5.3.  Provides copies of position descriptions to the servicing manpower activity to 
support review and change processes. 
7.1.5.4.  Works with supervisors and the servicing manpower activity to resolve 
discrepancies between position descriptions and associated manpower positions. 
7.1.5.5.  Coordinates all requests for overhire and reimbursable civilian positions with the 
servicing manpower activity before classification and staffing. 
7.1.6.  Supervisors. 
7.1.6.1.  Send requests for new or revised position descriptions to the servicing manpower 
activity for coordination. 
7.1.6.2.  Works with their servicing manpower activity when developing or revising 
position descriptions.  The servicing manpower activity can provide information and 
advice to ensure the duties and responsibilities are within the scope of the position’s Air 
Force specialty, function, and organization. 
7.1.6.3.  Send requests for any new or revised position descriptions to the servicing civilian 
personnel activity for action only after receiving servicing manpower activity coordination. 
7.2.  Position Description Review. 
7.2.1.  Servicing manpower activity will work with servicing civilian activities to review 
position descriptions. (T-2). 
7.2.2.  Verify position descriptions do not include inferred work, assumed work, or work done 
by existing contracts.  Directed work defines manpower requirements.  Do not use civilian 
position descriptions to capture work not otherwise directed to the unit by higher headquarters 
directives. 
7.2.3.  Verify the occupational series and duties are consistent with the position’s Air Force 
specialty and skill level. 
7.3.  Overhire and Reimbursable Civilian Positions. 
7.3.1.  Overhire civilian positions are short-term solutions to short-term seasonal, cyclical, or 
surge workload requirements.  Overhires are not to resolve chronic staffing shortfalls.  Pursue 
permanent solutions if anticipating overhire requirements to last more than two years. They 
will not be validated and approved to replace or compensate for unfunded manpower 
requirements on the unit manpower document for long periods. (T-1).  Establish overhire 
positions in the Manpower Programming and Execution System when requirement lasts more 
than 1 year and set the position’s “through date” for no more than 24 fiscal quarters.  Review 
all overhire requirements every year and update the Manpower Programming and Execution 
System.  See Table 7.1 for specific Manpower Programming and Execution System position 
attributes. 
7.3.2.  Reimbursable civilian requirements are funded by non-Air Force sources (e.g., foreign 
military sales or service agreements).  The requirement duration is often undetermined.  
Manpower positions are established in the Manpower Programming and Execution System 
with an indefinite “through date.”  Reimbursable requirements are reviewed annually and the 
Manpower Programming and Execution System is updated as needed.  See Table 7.1 for 
specific manpower position attributes. 
30 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
7.4.  Civilian Position Data Attributes. 
7.4.1.  The Defense Civilian Personnel Data System is the system of record for classified 
civilian positions.  A direct feed updates occupational series codes and grades for civilian 
positions from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System.  Do not use alternate sources to 
update these fields in the Manpower Programming and Execution System.   Servicing 
manpower activities work with the appropriate servicing civilian personnel activities to resolve 
any discrepancies or omissions.  A direct feed from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data 
System updates the Manpower Programming and Execution System once discrepancies are 
resolved. 
7.4.2.  Air Force Specialty Code.  The Air Force specialty code reflects military specialties, 
not civilian specialties.  Occupational series codes reflect civilian specialties and are a result 
of the classification process.  There is no direct conversion from military specialty and skill 
level to civilian specialty and grade, but there must be a close correlation.  Military specialty 
and skill level initially define all Air Force manpower requirements.  If workforce mix or 
budgetary decisions warrant civilian positions, then a classification process determines an 
occupational series and grade equal to the position’s military specialty and skill level.  
Manpower and civilian personnel specialists and classifiers work together to maintain the 
intended specialty and skill level of the position through the final classification. 
7.4.3.  Occupational Series Code.  The occupational series code reflects a civilian positions 
specialty. 
7.4.3.1.  Supervisors, servicing manpower and civilian personnel activities work together 
to identify occupational series most appropriate to reflect relative equivalency to the Air 
Force specialty code requirements of positions. 
7.4.3.2.  The Manpower Programming and Execution System reflects occupational series 
codes of positions established in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System. 
7.4.3.3.  Civilian positions without an established position in the Defense Civilian 
Personnel Data System use occupational series code “0000.” 
7.4.4.  Civilian Grades.  Civilian grades are a result of the classification process. 
7.4.4.1.  The classified grade is both the required and authorized grade. 
7.4.4.2.  Positions classified with incremental grades reflect the highest target grade in the 
Manpower Programming and Execution System. 
7.4.4.3.  Required and authorized grades for civilian positions without a position 
description use code “TBD.” 
7.4.4.4.  Required and authorized grades for all foreign national civilian positions use code 
“CIV.”

CONTRACT MANPOWER 
8.1.  Overview.  Manpower authorities review contract purchase requests for services to verify the 
proposed contract work is not already done or paid for by programmed resources. 
8.2.  Contract Purchase Request Review. 
8.2.1.  Under Title 10 USC Section 2241, government and contract performance and funding 
of the same function may overlap for up to 1 year in order to implement an orderly transition 
plan between service providers.  The supported function, servicing contracting and manpower 
activities must promptly resolve any extenuating circumstances that require funding that 
extends beyond a year to bridge the transition. (T-1). 
8.2.2.  Requiring Activity.  Sends contract purchase requests, to include funding 
documentation, the independent government estimate, requirements approval document and 
the performance work statement, to the servicing manpower activity for validation.  The 
requiring activity also provides enough technical information to help the servicing manpower 
activity in reviewing the contract request. 
8.2.3.  Servicing Manpower Activity.  Reviews and coordinates on all service contract 
requests, modifications, or terminations which change contractor full-time equivalent 
requirements to ensure the proposed contract work does not duplicate or conflict with the 
existing government workforce. (T-1). 
8.2.4.  Servicing Contracting Activity.  Processes request for services, including changes, 
extensions, and terminations, once the servicing manpower activity has reviewed the request. 
8.3.  Documenting Contractor Full-Time Equivalents. 
8.3.1.  The need to record contractor full-time equivalents is an internal manpower enterprise 
determination. 
8.3.2.  Contractor full-time equivalents have worth in determining workforce mix, sizing 
organizations, applying specific manpower determinants, base support plans, and manpower 
estimates for major acquisition programs. 
8.3.3.  Until otherwise directed by AF/A1M, MAJCOM/A1M’s may use their discretion 
whether to document contractor full-time equivalents.  If recorded, MAJCOM/A1M’s will 
publish methods and procedures to include an annual review. (T-1).

REGULAR AIR FORCE MILITARY GRADES 
9.1.  Overview.  Military grade management is an integral process with the colonel and chief 
master sergeant grade review boards and officer and enlisted grade allocations.  Although each is 
a separate event, they occur in sequence to ensure top-down allocation and grade determination. 
9.1.1.  Each grade review is accomplished every two years on alternating years.  Grades must 
stay in balance with the funding accounts identified within the annual National Defense 
Authorization Act. (T-1). 
9.1.2.  Military Grade Allocation and Constraints. 
9.1.2.1.  Each year the National Defense Authorization Act defines the maximum number 
of officers and enlisted authorizations. 
9.1.2.2.  Congressional along with Air Force policy determine ceilings that constrain the 
number of Regular Air Force general officers, field grade officers, chief master sergeants, 
and senior master sergeants. 
9.1.2.3.  Colonel and chief master sergeant grade review boards validate and recommend 
those positions to fund to colonel or chief master sergeant. 
9.1.2.4.  The grades allocation process establishes percentages (factors) for the remaining 
officer and enlisted grades (i.e., lieutenant through lieutenant colonel and airman first class 
through senior master sergeant).  The Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency will provide 
a fair share distribution of limited grades to all commands and specialties by developing 
command grade factors and command specialties factors using the required grade of funded 
authorizations. (T-1). 
9.1.2.5.  The Manpower Programming and Execution System (see Attachment 2) 
documents all funded and unfunded manpower requirements.  Funded requirements 
contain required and authorized grades.  The required grade (unconstrained) data field in 
the Manpower Programming and Execution System reflects grades to do specific work.  
The authorized grade (constrained) data field reflects fiscal reality and defines those grades 
allowed by applying colonel and chief master sergeant allocations and applying officer and 
enlisted factors to authorized end strength. 
9.2.  Colonel and Chief Master Sergeant Grade Allocation Process. 
9.2.1.  Air Force Senior Leader Management (AF/A1L).

AIR RESERVE COMPONENT MANPOWER 
10.1.  Overview.  Air Reserve and National Guard Bureau Components manage their manpower 
in accordance with the following guidance. 
10.2.  AF/REX, AFRC/A1M and NGB/A1M will: 
10.2.1.  Establish manpower requirements for in-place mobilization and manage, support, and 
train units in a non-mobilized status when the Regular Air Force command does not provide 
this support.  Include these authorizations with the coordinating command’s mobilization 
manpower requirements and send the combined data to Headquarters Air Force, the 
coordinating Major Command, mobilization assistant, and the respective Air Force Reserve 
units. (T-1). 
10.2.2.  Oversee unit programming actions to ensure unit designations are valid and personnel 
accountability symbol codes are available.  Confirm and communicate unit designation and 
personnel accountability symbol codes to Regular Air Force commands when they complete 
programming actions. (T-1).  Only the National Guard Bureau shall allocate manpower 
resources, to include skill level and grade, and prepare manpower documents for ANG State 
headquarters per approved staffing guides. (T-1). 
10.2.3.  Validate all individual mobilization augmentee authorizations. (T-1). 
10.2.4.  Review Air Reserve Component authorization skill and grade distribution to ensure 
they follow current Air Force and Department of Defense guidance. (T-1). 
10.3.  Establishing Manpower Requirements. 
10.3.1.  Air Force approves manpower authorizations for Air Reserve Component units based 
on: 
10.3.1.1.  Established Air Reserve Component manpower determinants and guides, 
support agreements and programming documents. 
10.3.1.2.  Approved Unit Type Codes. 
10.3.1.3.  Information and automated manpower file extracts exchanged among Regular 
Air Force and host commands, the National Guard Bureau, Headquarters Air Force 
Reserve Command, and Headquarters Air Force. 
10.3.2.  Requirements for Reserve Component Gained Units.  Commands establish 
mobilization manpower requirements for gained ANG units whereas AFRC units mobilize, 
but are not gained to the Regular Air Force.  These requirements state the manpower resources 
needed to augment the active forces in wartime and contingencies.  Get NGB/A1M 
coordination before placing mobilization manpower requirements into the Manpower 
Programming and Execution System.  Use the required grade of the active force unit manpower 
document and manpower determinants for similar activities to determine Air Reserve 
Component required grades.  AF/A1M and NGB/A1M are the only offices authorized to 
update ANG mobilization manpower requirements into the Manpower Programming and 
Execution System. 
40 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
10.3.3.  Manpower Requirements for Full-Time In-Place and Nonmobilized Units.  The ANG 
and Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command determine manpower requirements needed for 
in-place mobilization and for managing, supporting, and training ANG and Air Force Reserve 
units in a non-mobilized status.  Air Force program guidance and the United States Air Force 
Programs, Installations, Units, and Priorities documents provide the numbers and types of Air 
Reserve Component units programmed by period and unit location.  AF/A1M uses the 
manpower transaction report to oversee manpower programs established for ANG and Air 
Force Reserve Command units.

Chapter 11 
INDIVIDUAL MOBILIZATION AUGMENTEE POSITIONS 
11.1.  Overview.  This chapter applies to individual mobilization augmentee authorizations below 
brigadier general in all program elements.  Individual mobilization augmentees are individual 
members of the Selected Reserve or Participating Individual Ready Reserve assigned to an Regular 
Air Force of the Department of Defense or other federal agency in war, contingency operations, 
and peacetime to meet national defense, strategic national interest, and domestic objectives. 
11.2.  Applicability.  Do not reallocate authorizations between controlled program elements 
without first obtaining approval from the appropriate program manager. (T-1). 
11.3.  Individual Mobilization Augmentees Categories.   
11.3.1.  Per DoDI 1235.11, Management of Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs), 
individual mobilization augmentee requirements may support mobilization, contingency 
operations, or other specialized or technical requirements to augment the Regular Air Force 
component structure.  Use the following guidelines when validating individual mobilization 
augmentee manpower requirements. (T-1). 
11.3.2.  Mobilization.  Individual mobilization augmentees are validated to backfill units that 
deploy in support of war plans when critical home station functions must continue.  Individual 
mobilization augmentees also may be validated under mobilization criteria to augment 
deployed-in-place units not adequately staffed to provide expanded hours of operation or other 
requirements defined in operational plans.  MAJCOM’s will review war plans when validating 
individual mobilization augmentee requests for in-place mobilization support. (T-1). 
11.3.3.  Contingency Operations.  Individual mobilization augmentees provide support to 
Regular Air Force expeditionary forces, backfill active personnel who deploy, or augment 
Headquarters Air Force, Major Command, and Numbered/Named Air Force staff activities 
that must expand operations during these operations.  Individual mobilization augmentees for 
contingency operations requires the position to either reduce the operations tempo of the active 
force, provide workload relief for units losing personnel on steady-state deployment 
requirements, or augment Major Command or Numbered/Named Air Force staffs not staffed 
to support the expanded hours associated with contingency operations. 
11.3.4.  Specialized, Technical, or Scientific.  Individual mobilization augmentees provide 
support to Regular Air Force when workload is mission essential and requires rare, highly-
specialized, scientific, or technical skills, degrees, or certifications otherwise unavailable in the 
Regular Air Force (examples: nuclear physicist, brain surgeon, etc). 
11.4.  Miscellaneous Information. 
11.4.1.  Individual Mobilization Augmentee Wartime Authorizations.  Before requesting 
individual mobilization augmentee authorizations to satisfy wartime requirements, identify 
manpower made available by planned reductions in wartime or peacetime workloads. 
11.4.2.  Central and Single Manager Programs.  Air Force Reserve Command centrally 
manages individual mobilization augmentees with specialties in the chaplain, medical, and 
legal career fields.  Base manpower activities coordinate all requests for new individual 
mobilization augmentee authorizations in these specialties with the appropriate Air Force 
42 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
Reserve Command functional area manager.  The Air Force Office of Special Investigations is 
the single manager for all individual mobilization augmentees in their community. 
11.4.3.  General Officer Requirements.  The Reserve General Officer Baseline Study 
periodically reviews and validates requirements and authorizations for general officers and 
mobilization assistants.  The study is the basis for changes in positions to the Regular Air Force 
command for inclusion in the Manpower Programming and Execution System (see Attachment 
2).  The Air Force Reserve Senior Leader Management Office (AF/REG) is responsible for the 
baseline study. 
11.5.  Restrictions. 
11.5.1.  Individual mobilization augmentees do not augment Air Reserve Component force 
structure.  Additionally, individual mobilization augmentees do not augment the Regular Air 
Force portion of an associate unit when the same capability is being provided by the Air Force 
Reserve or ANG portion of the association. 
11.5.2.  Individual mobilization augmentees do not augment ANG units. 
11.5.3.  Individual mobilization augmentees do not replace military personnel expected to be 
unavailable for duty because of leave, hospitalization, professional military education, or other 
temporary reasons. 
11.5.4.  Individual mobilization augmentees do not replace civilian employees who are Ready 
Reservists of the Military Services. 
11.5.5.  Individual mobilization augmentees do not manage and train Air Force Reserve 
Command personnel when that is the sole justification for an individual mobilization 
augmentee requirement. Major commands may use management and training of individual 
mobilization augmentee personnel as partial justification for an individual mobilization 
augmentee requirement providing the individual mobilization augmentee keeps proficiency in 
primary duties, using the individual mobilization augmentee is economical, and the individual 
mobilization augmentee exercises appropriate leadership and management skills for position 
and rank. Major commands may assign a senior individual mobilization augmentee position to 
administratively manage individual mobilization augmentees. Regular Air Force personnel 
within the Major Command keep primary responsibility for managing individual mobilization 
augmentee program operations. 
11.6.  Chief Air Force Reserve (AF/RE) will: 
11.6.1.  Ensure the most efficient and effective use of individual mobilization augmentee 
resources. (T-1). 
11.6.2.  Conduct a biennial review of individual mobilization augmentee positions below the 
rank of brigadier general. (T-1). 
11.6.3.  Manage external from USAF, such as Joint Staff, Combatant Commands and Defense 
Agencies and internal USAF Direct Reporting Units, FOAs, and MAJCOMs individual 
mobilization augmentee requirements. (T-1). 
11.6.4.  Establish and provide individual mobilization augmentee program guidance to 
servicing manpower offices and ensure requirements are validated per criteria and restrictions. 
(T-1).

AIR RESERVE COMPONENT MILITARY GRADES 
13.1.  Air National Guard Military Grades Process Overview. 
13.1.1.  This section establishes guidance for an Enlisted Grades Program for all ANG military 
positions at the unit-level and applies to all enlisted grades included in unit manpower 
document funded military end strength numbers.  However, it does not apply to organizations 
or specialties identified in advance by the National Guard Bureau Command Chief Master 
Sergeant or NGB/CF.  The ANG Enlisted Grades Program ensures grades are equitably 
distributed throughout all ANG field-level units.  The Enlisted Grades Program ensures 
compliance with established grade percentages and provides methods for distributing enlisted 
grades throughout all ANG field-level units equitably. 
13.1.2.  Enlisted Grades Council.  The Enlisted Grades Council will convene and review the 
enlisted grade structure every two years. (T-1). NGB/CF can direct an enlisted grade review 
board at any time. The major participants in the ANG Enlisted Grades Program are National 
Guard Bureau Command Chief Master Sergeant, Career Field Managers, Enlisted Grades 
Council representatives, NGB/A1M Chief Master Sergeant, and the Enlisted Field Advisory 
Council representatives.

13.1.8.  Implementation.  Career field managers and the Enlisted Grades Council work with 
NGB/A1M to revise the unit manpower document to reflect the grade changes generated by 
the ANG enlisted grades allocation process. 
13.2.  Air Force Reserve Military Grades Overview. 
13.2.1.  The Air Force Reserve Command officer and enlisted grades distribution process is 
designed to (1) optimize Air Force Reserve Command officer and enlisted force development, 
(2) adhere to officer and enlisted force structure principles, (3) provide a consistent method to 
equitably distribute limited grades throughout the command, (4) enhance unit standardization, 
(5) meet mission requirements, and (6) provide grade targets to functional and personnel 
communities to effectively manage limited personnel resources.  Air Guard Reserve 
promotions within the controlled grades of E-8 (SMSgt), E-9 (CMSgt), O-4 (Maj), O-5 (Lt 
Col), and O-6 (Col) must be IAW 10 U.S.C., §§ 12011 and 12012.  Note: (Individual 
Mobilization Augmentee and Regular Air Force authorizations are not part of this process.)  
AF/REXX provides oversight, executes, and validates new and existing Air Guard Reserve 
positions external to AFRC and ensures exterior AFRC Air Guard Reserve authorizations and 
requirements are updated in the Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES). 
13.2.2.  Air Force Reserve Command Officer and Enlisted Grade Percentages.  The Air Force 
Reserve Command Commander (AFRC/CC) approves the command’s officer and enlisted 
baseline grade percentages that are documented in Air Force Reserve Command guidance.  
Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command may opt to apply alternate grade percentages to 
specific positions (e.g., Air Force specialties, functions, units) that may result in an adjustment 
to the Air Force Reserve Command officer and enlisted baseline grade percentages for the 
remaining positions. 
13.2.3.  Officer and Enlisted Active Guard and Reserve Grades.  AFRC/A1M maintains Active 
Guard and Reserve authorizations within approved Active Guard and Reserve end strength and 
under 10 USC § 12012.  Factor enlisted Active Guard and Reserve grades into the overall Air 
Force Reserve Command enlisted grade percentages. 
13.3.  Grade Changes.   
13.3.1.  National Guard Bureau or Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command may specify 
military grades that differ from those specified in the Regular Air Force command’s manpower 
standard statement.  This flexibility enables them to respond to management problems inherent 
to the unit. 
13.3.2.  Keep all enlisted required grade changes within the required specialty and skill level 
spread shown in the governing directive manpower force detail by the Regular Air Force 
command.  Further, do not change the authorized skill level more than one skill level from the 
required skill level unless the unit type code allows. 
13.3.3.  Keep all officer changes within the required specialty and grade spread authorized in 
the governing directive for the Regular Air Force command required specialty.  Do not change 
authorized grades more than one grade level from the required grade unless the unit type code 
allows more than one grade. 
13.3.4.  Commands may not use this grade realignment guidance to shift grades between 
Regular Air Force command wartime requirements and Air Reserve Component additional 
48 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
requirements approved for in-place mobilization for managing, supporting, and training units 
in a non-mobilized status unless satisfying baseline enlisted and officer grade requirements.

AIRCREW POSITIONS 
14.1.  Overview.  The Manpower community determines and documents aircrew manpower 
requirements.  (See AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management, for aircrew management procedures) This 
chapter identifies key actions stakeholders may accomplish to effectively manage aircrew 
authorizations. 
14.2.  Air Force Directorate of Manpower, Organization and Resources (AF/A1M). 
14.2.1.  Determines and validates aircrew manpower requirements with AF/A3O, except for 
aircrew manpower requirements determined by Air Education and Training Command’s 
specialized undergraduate pilot training flying training resource allocation programming 
model. 
14.2.2.  Assigns aircrew specialties with applicable aircrew position indicator codes only to 
those positions where duties require aircrew skills.  Establishes aircrew positions at the lowest 
organizational level consistent with mission requirements and coordinates with the 
MAJCOM/A3 to validate aircrew requirement changes and the yearly aircrew authorizations 
review.  Updates aircrew position indicator codes in the Manpower Programming and 
Execution System (see Attachment 2) to reflect approved actions. 
14.3.  Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff Operations (AF/A3O). 
14.3.1.  Establishes the rated baselines for MAJCOM/A3s and provides an information copy 
to the MAJCOM/A1M using the end of fiscal year requirements.  The baseline sets each 
command’s maximum total pilots, combat systems officers, air battle managers, and remotely 
piloted aircraft pilots by category. 
14.3.2.  Evaluates requests for new positions and changes to existing authorizations and sends 
approval or disapproval to the requester.  Helps identify offsets to growth requirements, where 
appropriate and directed. 
14.3.3.  Updates AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, with crew ratio 
changes by 31st of December. 
14.3.4.  Updates aircrew authorizations estimate using funded aircrew ratios. 
14.3.5.  Analyzes yearly aircrew authorizations review from each MAJCOM/A1M and 
Department of Defense Component and returns comments or corrections. 
14.4.  Air 
Force 
Medical 
Support 
Agency 
Aerospace 
Operations 
Division 
(AFMSA/SG3P).  Evaluates requests for new aircrew position indicator code “5” positions or 
changes to existing authorizations and sends approval or disapproval to the originator. 
14.5.  Functional Authority Responsibility. 
14.5.1.  Assigns aircrew specialties only to those positions with duties requiring aircrew skills. 
Establishes aircrew positions at the lowest organizational level consistent with mission 
requirements. 
14.5.2.  Sends all changes and new requests in enough time to be approved by 1 year before 
the proposed requirement change date.  This date provides time to implement changes in 
50 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
aircrew production or manning levels to support the change.  Major commands manage non-
aircrew position indicator code “5” aircrew requirements within overall aircrew specialty and 
major weapons system category levels determined by AF/A3O.  All other organizations must 
coordinate any changes to aircrew authorizations with AF/A3O. (T-1).  Air Reserve 
Components must coordinate any change in Regular Air Force aircrew positions with AF/A3O. 
(T-1). 
14.5.3.  Sends all changes and new requests for rated flight surgeon positions directly to Air 
Force Medical Support Agency Aerospace  Division (AFMSA/SG3). 
14.5.4.  Identifies potential offsets for new aircrew requirements.  Additions or changes to 
aircrew requirements are possible only with offsets within the same aircrew specialty and 
major weapons system category.  Aircrew changes generated by new manpower determinants 
or reapplying existing manpower determinants require offsetting authorizations. 
14.6.  Major Command Operations Directorate (MAJCOM/A3).  Approves additions or 
changes to aircrew authorizations (except flight surgeon positions) and maintains the command’s 
baseline requirements.  AF/A3O approves in advance any change to the baseline requirements. 
14.7.  Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG).  Manages the justification process for flight 
surgeons with aircrew position indicator code “5” as described in AFMAN 11-402, Aviation and 
Parachutist Service. 
14.8.  Installation Functional Area Manager.  Sends requests for new authorizations and 
changes to existing authorizations to the servicing manpower activity, who in turn sends it to the 
MAJCOM/A1M for validation and coordination with the Major Command functional authority. 
Installation functional area managers must conduct a yearly aircrew authorization review as 
directed by the Major Command, provides supporting justification, and coordinates aircrew 
position requests with the servicing manpower activity. (T-1). 
14.9.  Servicing Manpower Activity.  Shall coordinate with the functional authority on aircrew 
data changes and the yearly aircrew authorizations review and send the Manpower Programming 
and Execution System changes to the MAJCOM/A1M. (T-1). 
14.10.  Crew Ratio or Crew Complements. 
14.10.1.  Existing Crew Ratios or Crew Complements.  MAJCOM/A3 must send proposed 
changes to  MAJCOM/A8 then sends proposed changes to existing crew ratios or crew 
complements to Air Force Director of Programs (AF/A8P), with a copy to AF/A3O.  AF/A8P 
coordinates the proposed change with AF/A1M and AF/A3O.  Once AF/A8P approves the 
proposed changes, they inform the MAJCOM/A1M for programming and AF/A3O who 
updates to AFI 65-503. 
14.10.2.  New Crew Ratios or Crew Complements.  Lead commands must send proposed crew 
ratios and crew complements with justification as part of the Operational Requirements 
Document for aircraft scheduled to enter the inventory. (T-1). These documents require 
AF/A3O coordination.  On Operational Requirements Document approval, AF/A8P informs 
AF/A3O, who updates AFI 65-503. 
14.11.  Programmed Flying Training Positions. 
14.11.1.  Send methods used to determine programmed flying training instructor requirements, 
including any method changes or deviations, to AF/A3O.  Document all programmed flying 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
51 
training methods in a directive-type publication, such as an instruction, manual, or operating 
instruction. 
14.11.2.  MAJCOM/A3, in coordination with their MAJCOM/A1M, sends advanced student 
requirements to AF/A3O.  Summarize these requirements by Mission Design Series, course 
number and crew position for each Future Year Defense Program year.  Determine all 
advanced student requirements by multiplying approved yearly student production or loads by 
course length in calendar days and dividing by the number of training days within a given year. 
14.11.3.  As the programmed flying training student load changes, instructor requirements also 
likely change.  Commands conducting formal aircrew training must send instructor aircrew 
change requests to AF/A1M who coordinates with AF/A3O for approval. (T-1). 
14.12.  Positions Based on Manpower Determinants.  For flying unit staff positions based on 
manpower determinants, MAJCOM/A1Ms must send proposed changes to existing aircrew 
manpower determinants or reapply existing manpower determinants with justification through Air 
Force Manpower Analysis Agency to AF/A1M for approval. (T-1).  Any aircrew staff changes 
generated by applying new or existing manpower determinants require offsetting authorizations. 
AF/A1M sends to AF/A3O for recommendation and coordination. 
14.13.  Other Aircrew Positions.  Staff positions include all aircrew positions not mentioned in 
paragraphs 14.1 through 14.5  The Major Command must provide offsetting authorizations for 
any new aircrew staff requirements.  Additions or changes are possible only with offsets for 
aircrew position indicator codes within the same aircrew specialty. 
14.14.  Aircrew Position Indicator Code.  All aircrew manpower authorizations require an 
aircrew position indicator code per AFMAN 11-402.

Chapter 15 
FOREIGN MILITARY SALES POSITIONS 
15.1.  Overview.  Chapter 39, Arms Export Control of Title 22 United States Code Section 2751, 
Foreign Relations and Intercourse, authorizes the sale of defense articles and services.  The yearly 
National Defense Authorization Act includes the Air Force end strength to support the Foreign 
Military Sales Program.  Although most Foreign Military Sales manpower is reimbursable, the Air 
Force programs the requirements to ensure coverage in the Future Year Defense Program.  
AF/A1M does not keep a pool of manpower authorizations available for new Foreign Military 
Sales programs. 
15.2.  Manpower Requirements Package.  MAJCOM/A1Ms prepare manpower requirements 
packages to justify support for a Foreign Military Sales case.  Use Regular Air Force manpower 
determinants when possible.  Use other approved methods to determine requirements if no Regular 
Air Force manpower determinants apply. 
15.3.  Manpower Classification. 
15.3.1.  Foreign Military Sales manpower authorizations are either full-time or part-time.  
Those positions doing less than 10 percent Foreign Military Sales work are not Foreign 
Military Sales.  Use the following information to classify required Foreign Military Sales 
positions: 
15.3.2.  Full-time positions do Foreign Military Sales duties 90 percent or more of the available 
time. 
15.3.3.  Part-time positions do both Foreign Military Sales and Air Force workload. Part-time 
authorizations spend more than 10 percent (but less than 90 percent) of their available time 
supporting Foreign Military Sales. 
15.3.4.  Use overhires for approved requirements when appropriate. Foreign Military Sales 
funding must be available. 
15.4.  Foreign Military Sales Position Codes. 
15.4.1.  Use program element code “A2002” for full-time manpower reimbursed by direct case 
funds. 
15.4.2.  Program the authorizations in the appropriate program element for commands using 
part-time manpower authorizations to do direct case workload. 
15.4.3.  Program manpower reimbursed by administrative surcharge funds in the appropriate 
major force program using a shred of "S.”  Use administrative surcharge funds to reimburse 
civilian and contractor positions. Military positions in a Foreign Military Sales administrative 
surcharge program element are Air Force funded.

MANPOWER ESTIMATE REPORT 
16.1.  Overview.  The Manpower Estimate Report satisfies the Department of Defense 
requirement to send major acquisition program manpower requirements to the Secretary of 
Defense.  This chapter identifies key actions stakeholders may accomplish to a Manpower 
Estimate Report. 
16.1.1.  The Secretary of Defense reviews the manpower requirements report before approving 
full-scale engineering development or production and deployment. 
16.1.2.  The Manpower Estimate Report is the source document for determining the manpower 
requirements part of the total costs of ownership for acquisition systems required by 
Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5000.01, Operation of The Defense Acquisition 
System. 
16.1.3.  Manpower authorities assess Manpower Estimate Reports for the following: 
16.1.3.1.  Estimates are comprehensive and accurate. 
16.1.3.2.  Estimates meet congressional controls and administrative restrictions on special 
programs. 
16.1.3.3.  Estimates meet manpower and personnel objectives or thresholds in the 
capabilities documents. 
16.1.4.  The Manpower Estimate Report accounts for the most likely level of performance and 
recommends post fielding verification of high-risk factors used for the estimate.  The 
Manpower Estimate Report summarizes critical personnel decisions or assumptions having a 
significant effect on manpower.

MANPOWER INPUTS INTO THE STRATEGY, PLANNING, PROGRAMMING, 
BUDGETING AND EXECUTION PROCESS 
17.1.  Overview.    AF/A1M performs oversight of manpower inputs into the Strategy, Planning, 
Programming, Budgeting, and Execution process. 
17.2.  Air Force Program Development Division (AF/A1MP).  Facilitates management of 
AF/A1M manpower inputs for the Strategy, Planning, Programing, Budgeting, and Execution 
process. 
17.2.1.  Compiles, records, allocates and administers the Air Force’s “top line” end strength 
changes for fiscal year Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution decisions.  
This end strength includes student, trainee, and personnel hold accounts (i.e., Individuals 
accounts) and the Air Force portion of joint- and defense-level activities and accounts centrally 
managed by Office of the Secretary of Defense and Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence.  (See special considerations outlined in Chapter 21.) AF/A1MP will advocate for 
manpower resources in support of the Individuals (non-unit) account. (T-1). (See Chapter 23.) 
17.2.2.  Assists the Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution responsible 
office in determining the manpower inputs in the Automated Schedule and Resource 
Allocation Program Information Decision System and records approved changes in the 
Manpower Programming and Execution System (see Attachment 2) that passes the manpower 
details into Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System or its replacement. (See 
Attachment 2 for a description of the Manpower Programming and Execution System.) 
17.2.3.  Ensures Total Force manpower adjustments are coordinated and validated by the 
respective component office of primary responsibility—namely Chief of Air Force Reserve 
Manpower Division (AF/REXX) for Air Force Reserve manpower issues and National Guard 
Bureau Programs Division (NGB/A1MP) for ANG manpower issues. 
17.2.4.  Coordinates manpower options affecting the acquisition workforce with Air Force 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Personnel and Acquisition Career Management Directorate 
(SAF/AQH) and Air Force Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management Policy and Program 
Integration (SAF/AQX). 
17.2.5.  Co-chairs manpower realignment working groups with AF/A8P during the Program 
Objective Memorandum to address the sourcing and redistribution of manpower resources 
during Program Objective Memorandum deliberations and facilitates sourcing of newly 
developed standards. 
17.2.6.  Responsible for providing to Office of the Secretary of Defense Headquarters Air 
Force manpower data on Air Force organizations covered in the congressional definition of 
Major Headquarters Activities.

Chapter 18 
DEFINING AND MANAGING AIR FORCE END STRENGTH 
18.1.  Overview.    Military personnel authorizations (end strength) are set by Congress and 
managed by DoD components within congressional limits.  During Program Objective 
Memorandum deliberations, manpower programming shall adhere to Office of the Secretary of 
Defense fiscal guidance, the Air Force Quadrennial Defense Review, and Annual Planning and 
Programming guidance. 
18.2.  Manpower Resource Accountability. 
18.2.1.  An Air Force program element code accounts for resources, to include end strength, 
needed to provide a specific capability. 
18.2.2.  Manpower Resource Identification Code.  An Air Force program element code may 
contain two manpower categories: (1) military and (2) civilian for each component of the Total 
Force. 
18.2.2.1.  Military end strength includes Regular Air Force officers, enlisted, and United 
States Air Force Academy cadets, Air Force Reserve officers and enlisted, and ANG 
officers and enlisted.  Air Force Reserve and ANG end strength is further identified in the 
Future Year Defense Program by resource identification code as drill officer, drill enlisted, 
and Active Guard and Reserve officer and enlisted.  The Air Force Reserve also has 
individual mobilization augmentee officer and enlisted resource identifier codes. 
18.2.2.2.  The civilian category contains six subcategories: (1) United States direct hire, (2) 
foreign national direct hire, (3) foreign national indirect hire, (4) United States direct hire-
Air Force (memo), (5) foreign national direct hire-Air Force (memo), and (6) foreign 
national indirect hire-Air Force (memo).  “Memo” entries are used to denote ANG and Air 
Force Reserve technicians that are a subset of the United States direct hire category, 
Defense Health Agency and special operations forces civilians managed by the Air Force, 
but funding remains in Defense Health Agency and special operations forces budget. 
18.3.  General Guidance. 
18.3.1.  Reimbursable Positions.  These are positions that perform work for an organization 
outside the Air Force (e.g., another Department of Defense Component, other federal agencies) 
for which the Air Force is reimbursed for personnel expenses.  Major commands and 
equivalents may adjust their number of reimbursable civilian positions above or below fiscal 
year program if agreed to by the functional office of primary responsibility and Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Air Force Financial Management and Comptroller, Directorate of 
Budget Operations Personnel (SAF/FMBO).  However, Major Commands and equivalents 
cannot keep strength associated with a decrease in reimbursable positions except through fiscal 
year programming actions, so as not to create year-of-execution costs for the Air Force. 
18.3.2.  End strength in program elements controlled by agencies and activities outside of the 
Air Force (e.g., Defense Health Agency, National Intelligence Program, joint agencies, special 
operations forces) will not be changed by AF/A1MP unless Office of the Secretary of Defense 
has approved a written agreement (e.g., memorandums of agreement or issue paper) between 
56 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
the Air Force and the affected activity or directed in Program Budget Review decision 
document. (T-1). 
 
 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019

Chapter 19 
PROGRAMMING TOOLS 
19.1.  Overview.  When available, manpower requirement estimates will be based on approved 
crew ratios, logistics composite models, manpower determinants, analysis of alternatives, 
command guides, or weapon system typical tools. (T-1).  For new and emerging missions, 
functional managers and manpower requirement experts will develop a manpower estimate. (T-
1). 
19.2.  Weapon System Zero Base Process. 
19.2.1.  A weapon system zero base process is designed to optimize the allocation of operations 
and maintenance manpower end strength, first within a Major Command mission set and 
secondly across the Air Force Future Year Defense Program. Weapon system zero base process 
matches authorized or fielded weapons in conjunction with annual budget cycles and produces 
a weapon system typical manpower determinant as a programming tool to estimate manpower 
impacts against proposed force structure changes.  The weapon system zero base process 
identifies all fixed (open-the-door costs) and variable costs (requirements as outlined in a 
typical) tied to a weapon system program element.  The Weapon system zero base process does 
not take the place of program change requests or funding of new requirements. 
19.2.2.  Each year in preparation for the Program Objective Memorandum cycle, AF/A1MP 
will provide a weapon systems zero base template and detailed instructions to the 
MAJCOM/A1Ms. (T-1). 
19.2.3.  Within 60 calendar days after the President’s budget allocation is received by the 
Major Commands or equivalents, functional managers and manpower requirement experts will 
annotate any changes to the previously submitted requirement using a separate line item for 
each change. (T-1). 
19.3.  Base Support Tail Factors. 
19.3.1.  Mission and capability changes affect installation support requirements; so, 
programmed changes in mission manpower affect installation support manpower requirements 
and may affect service levels for private sector contract support.  The relative effect of these 
changes is represented as Air Force base support tail factors.  (See Attachment 3)  These base 
support tail factors are to be used in conjunction with other tools when determining manpower 
effects of mission capability changes and are not applicable to Air Reserve Component bases. 
19.3.2.  The base support tail factor estimates the incremental impact in installation support 
manpower generated by a change in mission manpower requirements or tenant population. Its 
use assumes the presence of a full support infrastructure before making the proposed mission 
manpower changes. 
19.3.3.  The different factors recognize the required levels of support vary.  Refer to attachment 
3 to determine which base support tail factor to use.  Manpower activities below Major 
Command level will not use these factors to adjust authorizations on the unit manpower 
document based on mission and force structure changes without a change to programmed end 
strength. (T-1). 
19.4.  Major Department of Defense Headquarters Activity Factor. 
58 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
19.4.1.  As missions and force structure change, so may the size of the major Department of 
Defense headquarters activity manpower element.  Headquarters Air Force, Major Commands, 
and ANG headquarters element may establish an internal engineered factor based on units, 
dollars, end strength, number of weapons systems, the number of different countries where 
geographically separated units are located, or a combination of creditable factors and evaluate 
the headquarters strength relative to the factor every year concurrently with fiscal year budget 
decisions that change allocated force structure.  The factor is subject to peer review by another 
Major Command or AF/A1M if used for Program Objective Memorandum or Program Budget 
Review mission transfer or force structure increase or decrease. 
19.4.2.  For new missions and force structure, Air Force Corporate Structure will determine 
the relative change to major Department of Defense headquarters activity manpower. (T-1). 
19.4.3.  For mission and force structure transfers, divestitures, and changes, Admin Assistant 
to the Secretary of the Air Force, Resources Directorate (SAF/AAR) and MAJCOM/A1M staff 
will determine the relative impact to their major Department of Defense headquarters activity 
elements. (T-1).  In the case of intercommand transfers where affected SAF/AAR and 
MAJCOM/A1Ms cannot agree on the requisite headquarters activity manpower adjustments, 
a factor of 2.65 percent times full-time end strength (Regular Air Force and Active Guard and 
Reserve) will be used. (T-1). 
19.5.  Individuals Account Manpower Programming Tools. 
19.5.1.  The manpower associated with the Individuals Account is quantified through the 
development and application of mathematical models to identify and validate student man-year 
requirements.  (See Chapter 23, Figure 1)  The student man-year requirements are determined 
by multiplying student entry data and course length and then dividing the result by the average 
number of academic calendar days.  The results are programmed in designated program 
elements by AF/A1MP who develops and maintains the student man-year models. 
19.5.2.  Students shall include all active military personnel who are attending non-initial entry 
course of instruction in a permanent change of station status (normally combined course length 
of 20 weeks or more at one location ) or in temporary duty status while executing a permanent 
change of station.

Chapter 20 
ADJUSTING END STRENGTH 
20.1.  Overview.    Manpower adjustments in Programming Inputs and Budgeting Inputs are 
identified by an Air Force Corporate Structure change control number within the Resource 
Allocation Programming Information Decision System. 
20.2.  Air Force Corporate Structure Change Control Number.  The Air Force Corporate 
Structure change control number records approved actions implementing offsets, disconnects, and 
initiatives. AF/A1MP creates a corresponding Manpower change control number in the Manpower 
Programming and Execution System (see Attachment 2) for each approved Air Force Corporate 
Structure change control number. (See Attachment 2). 
20.3.  Manpower Zero-Balance Transfers.  Zero-balance transfers are manpower adjustments 
designed to facilitate intercommand transfers and to correct minor deviations in program execution 
within a single command.  A zero-balance transfer is an exact reallocation of resources, normally 
within a single program.  A zero-balance transfer is not to be used for reprogramming actions (i.e., 
transferring resources from one mission or capability to another).  Zero-balance transfers must 
follow the business rules in the fiscal year Program Objective Memorandum preparation 
instruction. 
20.3.1.  Manpower zero-balance transfers cannot increase end strength (buy end strength with 
a funding offset), cross appropriations, or create costs for the Air Force.  Manpower Servicing 
Activity will submit balance zero-balance transfers by manpower category, appropriation, and 
dollars for each fiscal year. (T-1).  If a zero-balance transfer is necessary to fix database errors 
from a previous programming event, the Manpower Servicing Activity must provide enough 
rationale. (T-1). 
20.3.2.  Major commands and equivalents will submit zero-balance transfers to AF/A1MP 
manpower programmers at the same time all other zero-balance transfers are submitted to 
AF/A8P. (T-1). 
20.3.3.  Manpower actions that are country and state code cleanup actions are considered zero-
balance transfers. 
20.3.4.  Inter-command transfers that do not transfer systems are considered manpower only 
zero-balance transfers.  If the intercommand transfer is the result of weapon system transfer, 
the action is not considered a pure manpower intercommand transfer and must be approved by 
the appropriate Air Force Corporate structure mission or mission support panels (e.g. Personnel 
and Training, Space Superiority, Nuclear Deterrence Operations). (T-1). 
20.3.5.  Manpower actions that cross appropriations, end strength categories, Budget 
Activities, or budget sub-activity, or drive a cost to the Air Force Corporate Structure are not 
considered manpower zero-balance transfers. 
20.3.6.  Air Force Reserve and ANG Technician (memo) resource identification codes (“0160” 
and “0170”) may be increased or decreased in a zero-balance transfer.  However, their civilian 
resource identification codes (“0160”) must zero-balance. 
 
60 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
20.4.  Major commands and Equivalents will: 
20.4.1.  Coordinate the details of the zero-balance transfer, prepare their respective portions of 
the manpower zero-balance transfer the Manpower Programming and Execution System (see 
Attachment 2) project, and submit it to AF/A1MP in the Manpower Programming and 
Execution System (both the gaining and losing commands). (T-1). 
20.4.2.  Review all manpower files or manpower zero-balance transfers before submission to 
ensure non Air Force positions are not affected (i.e., the United States Special Operations 
Command, Defense Health Agency, or National Intelligence Program.) (T-1). 
20.4.3.  Make changes to reimbursable positions if agreed to by the functional office of primary 
responsibility and SAF/FMBOP.  Major commands and equivalents may not create zero-
balance transfers between reimbursable positions and direct-funded positions. (T-1). 
20.5.  Air Force Corporate Structure Air Force Program Development Division (AF/A1MP), 
Chief of Air Force Reserve Manpower Division (AF/REXX), National Guard Bureau 
Programs Division (NGB/A1MP).    Manpower programmers will: 
20.5.1.  Review all manpower zero-balance transfer requests for compliance with current 
Program Objective Memorandum preparation instruction guidance. (T-1). 
20.5.2.  Work noncompliance issues with affected Major Commands and equivalents. (T-1). 
20.5.3.  Coordinate zero-balance transfers with SAF/FMBO (or appropriate Air Reserve 
Component Financial Management office).  If Major Commands and equivalents propose zero-
balance transfer actions that result in added (unsourced) costs to the Air Force, the action is 
disapproved and they have the option to bring the action forward with an offset identified. (T-
1). 
20.5.4.  Host-Tenant Support Agreements.  MAJCOM and equivalent who initiate a workload 
on another Major Command and equivalent must coordinate host-tenant manpower actions 
with the affected command and will prepare documents in accordance with AFI 25-201, Intra-
Service, Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support Agreements Procedures. (T-1). 
20.5.4.1.  The supported command will give the supporting command the information it 
needs to determine its manpower requirements. (T-1). 
20.5.4.2.  The supported command must negotiate with the supporting command regarding 
the availability of existing resources to support the requirement. (T-1). 
20.5.4.3.  The supported command will program required manpower actions in the first 
available exercise of the Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution cycle 
after the support agreement has been finalized. (T-1). 
20.6.  Out of Cycle End Strength Changes.  These changes include program change request and 
host-tenant actions. 
20.6.1.  A program change request is used to realign Air Force resources outside of the normal 
Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution and consists of changes in the 
current execution and budget years.  Because program change requests require changing the 
Air Force Program of Record, they are vetted through the Air Force Corporate Structure 
process and approved by the Secretary of the Air Force. 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
61 
20.6.1.1.  Fiscal realignment approved as part of a program change request is typically 
finalized through intercommand transfer by Deputy Assistant Secretary for Air Force 
Financial Management and Comptroller Director of Plans (SAF/FMBP).  An 
intercommand transfer is the realignment of funding between Major Commands and 
appropriations. 
20.6.1.2.  AF/A1MP and MAJCOMs track changes to force structure items in execution or 
budget year within the Force Structure Data Management database (i.e., aircraft, 
munitions). 
20.6.1.3.  Special oversight is necessary when reprogramming between appropriations, 
over specific funding level dollar thresholds, or special interest items involving 
congressional special interest line items.  Headquarters Air Force, Office of the Secretary 
of Defense, or Congress can deny reprogramming actions of this nature. 
20.6.1.4.  All military and civilian manpower addressed in program change requests must 
zero-balance and may consider required adjustments in private sector contract support. 
20.6.1.4.1.  If a program change request proposes manpower changes, it must be broken 
out by officers, enlisted, and civilians; the request may display the manpower of the 
current and proposed programs. (T-1).  If the program change request proposes to 
change or transfer billets, the request must display the impact of these changes by 
category and fiscal year, including out years. (T-1). 
20.6.1.4.2.  If the request is to change manpower only (e.g., no forces, flying hours), 
the requesting office may first consult AF/A1MP to see if the change can be 
reprogrammed  by an intercommand transfer or other manpower change vehicle, 
without preparing a program change request.

Chapter 21 
ADJUSTING END STRENGTH-SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
21.1.  Overview.  End strength levels within a program or theater may be dictated or limited by 
legislative and Office of the Secretary of Defense policy.  These constraints include ceilings and 
floors (e.g., overseas and major Department of Defense headquarters activity elements) or 
protected budget activities whose funding levels cannot be adjusted without consent from the 
owning activity (e.g., Defense Health Agency and special operations forces). 
21.2.  Overseas Ceilings and Floors.  United States activities in foreign countries are of special 
political and economic interest to the United States and foreign governments.  Office of the 
Secretary of Defense, working with higher authorities, establishes overseas ceilings and floors to 
control Department of Defense activities in various areas, regions, and countries.  Unless 
Headquarters Air Force or a higher authority specifies otherwise, overseas manpower ceilings and 
floors include all permanent party military authorizations. 
21.2.1.  AF/A1M designates the manpower office within the Air Force component, to the 
Combatant Command for the geographic area, as the Air Force executive or support agent. 
21.2.2.  AF/A1MP notifies executive agents of ceiling and floor limitations. 
21.2.3.  AF/A1MP, AF/REXX, and NGB/A1MP are End Strength Resource Managers. 
21.2.3.1.  Administer and monitor the Regular Air Force and Air Force Reserve portions 
of the ceiling and floor. 
21.2.3.2.  Notify other Major Commands and equivalents of their portion of the ceiling and 
floor. 
21.2.3.3.  Ensure Major Commands and equivalents do not exceed ceiling and floor limits 
unless a higher authority so authorizes.  Ensure major command, and equivalent, unit 
manpower documents affected by manpower ceilings and floors, do not exceed limitations.  
(See Department of Defense 7000.14-R volume 2A, Budget Formulation and Presentation, 
Chapter 3, page 374 for adjusting joint accounts for undistributed congressional and Office 
of the Secretary of Defense general reductions.) 
21.2.3.4.  Ensures that limitations provide only the minimum manpower needed for 
assigned missions. 
21.2.4.  Executive and support agents and Major Commands and equivalents may directly 
communicate on ceiling and floor limitations. Executive and support agents may directly 
communicate with the Combatant Command staff that controls the limitation they administer. 
21.3.  Overseas Ceiling and Floor Change Requests. 
21.3.1.  To make changes to an Air Force ceiling and floor, the executive or support agent 
sends a written explanation of the requirement to the appropriate Combatant Command, with 
an information copy to AF/A1MP. 
21.3.2.  To increase or decrease a Major Command limitation, the Major Command or 
equivalent sends a written explanation of the requirement to the executive agent, with an 
information copy to AF/A1MP.  The executive or support agent approves the Major Command 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
63 
or equivalent request if it falls within the established Air Force limitation or disapproves if it 
falls outside of limitation. 
21.4.  Major Department of Defense Headquarters Activity.  Major Department of Defense 
headquarters activities are described and defined by statute, and organizations and functions 
considered major Department of Defense headquarters activity are in DoDI 5100.73, Major DoD 
Headquarters Activities.  In the Office of the Secretary of Defense Future Year Defense Program 
Resource Structure Management System, program elements are flagged in specified headquarters 
categories (giving Office of the Secretary of Defense and Congress visibility on changes to Air 
Force total major Department of Defense headquarters activity strength and by headquarters type.  
Office of the Secretary of Defense and Congress require an explanation for increases in Regular 
Air Force and Active Guard and Reserve major Department of Defense headquarters activity 
resources between fiscal years; so, any increases require Air Force Corporate Structure approval 
during Program Objective Memorandum or Program Budget Review.  Manpower zero-balance 
transfer increasing the amount of Regular Air Force and Active Guard or Reserve Air Force major 
Department of Defense headquarters activity resources cannot be in the balanced submission.  
Manpower category changes must be at a cost saving or cost neutral to stay within fiscal year 
major Department of Defense headquarters activity costs targets. 
21.5.  Joint Manpower.  Adjustment to Air Force programmed support to joint organizations can 
occur only through memorandums of agreement or program or budget issue papers during Program 
Decision Memorandum action during Program Budget Review.  Refer to Chairman Joint Chief of 
Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 1001.01B for further guidance on managing Joint and Combatant 
Command end strength and authorizations. 
21.6.  Special Access Program.  AF/A1M will appoint a point of contact to support manpower 
programming for special access programs. (T-1). 
21.7.  Defense Health Agency.  AF/A1M will coordinate Defense Health Agency manpower 
programming changes with Air Force Surgeon General Medical Manpower Personnel and 
Resourcing (AF/SG1/8). (T-1). 
21.8.  Special Operations Forces.  AF/A1M will coordinate special operations forces manpower 
programming changes with Air Force Special Operations Command Manpower, Personnel and 
Services Director (AFSOC/A1) and United States Special Operations Command Force Structure 
Requirements and Strategic Assessments Directorate (USSOCOM/J8). (T-1). 
21.9.  Intelligence.  AF/A1M will coordinate Consolidated Cryptologic Program (budget 
subactivity “330”), General Defense Intelligence Program (budget subactivity “331”), National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (budget subactivity “336”), and Military Intelligence Program 
(budget subactivity “365”) manpower programming changes with Deputy Chief of Staff 
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AF/A2). (T-1).  AF/A1M will coordinate National 
Reconnaissance Program (budget subactivity “333”) manpower programming changes with the 
National Reconnaissance Office and Air Force Space Command Manpower, Personnel and 
Services Director (AFSPC/A1). (T-1). 
21.10.  Foreign Military Sales.    AF/A1M will coordinate Foreign Military Sales manpower 
programming changes with Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force International Affairs 
(SAF/IA). (T-1).

AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
Chapter 22 
MANPOWER ALLOCATION AND UNIT MANPOWER DOCUMENT EXECUTION 
22.1.  Overview.   AF/A1MP allocates programmed manpower resources by program element 
code, resource identification code, and country state code to the commands directing 
implementation of approved programs.  Major commands and equivalents translate these 
manpower resources into manpower authorizations by updating the unit manpower document. Air 
Force Manpower, Organization and Resources Directorate, Organization Division (AF/A1MO) 
provides the Air Force Personnel Center the Manpower Programming and Execution System (see 
Attachment 2) data on military and civilian authorization changes to begin the actions necessary 
to recruit, train, and assign people.  Comparable detail is provided to Air Force Reserve and ANG 
personnel organizations by their respective Air Force Reserve and ANG manpower organizations 
so they may also begin the actions necessary to recruit, train, and assign personnel. 
22.2.  General Guidance.  Manpower authorizations will be added or deleted from the unit 
manpower document effective the fiscal quarter of an associated mission change. (T-1).  However, 
when a mission is extended 1 or more fiscal years, the MAJCOM/A1M (or equivalent) will submit 
a request to the applicable end strength resource manager (AF/A1MP, AF/REXX, NGB/A1MP) 
to over or under execute manpower on the Major Command unit manpower document to match 
the mission change or submit the requirement through the Air Force Corporate Structure process 
as a program disconnect. (T-1).  AF/A1M will coordinate these requests with the appropriate 
Headquarters Air Force stakeholder. (T-1). 
22.3.  Air Force Manpower, Organization and Resources Directorate Programming Division 
(AF/A1MP) will: 
22.3.1.  Allocate manpower resources to the commands as required, typically at the end of each 
Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution cycle, but making out-of-cycle 
allocations as necessary. (T-1). 
22.3.2.  Transmit manpower resources to the commands in the Manpower Programming and 
Execution System (see Attachment 2).  Resources are allocated by command, country state 
code, program element code, and resource identification code for all fiscal years in the Future 
Year Defense Program. (T-1). 
22.3.3.  Provide guidance regarding which fiscal years are to be updated on the unit manpower 
document and when these unit manpower document changes can be published. (T-1). 
22.4.  Major Command Manpower and Organization (MAJCOM/A1M) will: 
22.4.1.  Review allocation from AF/A1MP. (T-1). 
22.4.2.  Using the Manpower Programming and Execution System, implement changes on the 
unit manpower document per AF/A1MP instructions. (T-1). 
22.4.3.  Request extension or exception to timeline from AF/A1MP as required. (T-1). 
22.4.4.  Ensure authorizations on the unit manpower document match total allocated Future 
Year Defense Program by the Department of Defense program element. (T-1). 
22.4.4.1.  Deviations within military resource identification codes of more than 0.5 percent 
for a program element are noncompliant. (T-1). 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
65 
22.4.4.2.  Deviations in civilian resource identification codes of more than 0.5 percent are 
allowable if the Major Command or equivalent is executing within its civilian work year 
allocation. (T-1). 
22.5.  Major Command Unit Manpower Document Management. 
22.5.1.  Military Manpower Increases. Major commands will ensure the addition of military 
manpower authorizations or changes to grades and skills are made effective no earlier than the 
current quarter plus two. (T-1). 
22.5.1.1.  For example, if the manpower change request is received in the first quarter of 
the year, the effective date of the approved change may be no earlier than the third quarter 
of that year. 
22.5.1.2.  Coordinate deviations from this time-phasing with Major Command and 
equivalent personnel directorate activities to confirm the shorter lead time does not 
negatively affect the personnel assignments process. 
22.5.2.  Manpower Reductions.  Major commands will make effective military and civilian 
manpower authorization reductions tied to workload and mission decreases per the higher 
authority’s direction (e.g., program action directive, program guidance letter, and 
programming actions). (T-1).  Reductions that are not related to the loss of a specific workload 
or mission take effect when a higher authority levies the reduction. 
22.5.3.  Inter-command Transfer of Functions and Related Authorizations.  Since 
intercommand transfers often involve manpower realignment among major force programs, 
the constraints associated with crossing budget appropriations and major force programs may 
limit the timing of civilian realignments among Department of Defense program elements.  
Losing and gaining commands may work closely together to facilitate these transfers. 
22.5.3.1.  Once intercommand transfer negotiations begin, the losing command no longer 
adjusts manpower authorizations on the unit manpower document in the functions 
proposed for transfer. Also, the losing command must provide an associated manpower 
display for the two-year period before the proposed transfer date. 
22.5.3.2.  Manpower quantities are based on the losing command’s funded manpower 
authorizations by the fourth quarter for each fiscal year. 
22.5.3.3.  To prevent duplicate end strength reporting, Major Commands will ensure 
manpower authorization transfers between commands are completed within the Manpower 
Programming and Execution System (see Attachment 2) during the same month, and with 
the same effective date. (T-1).

INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTS-STUDENT, TRAINEE, AND PERSONNEL HOLD 
PROGRAM 
23.1.  Overview.  The Air Force Student, Trainee, and Personnel (STP) Hold Program provides a 
deliberate and defendable methodology to develop, program, and execute the Individuals accounts 
as outlined in DoDI 1120.11, Programming and Accounting for Active Component Military 
Manpower.  The supporting manpower (i.e., Training units) includes instructors, recruiters, 
overhead, support manpower, and is not part of the Individuals accounts. 
Figure 23.1.  Total Active Military End Strength. 
 
Note:  Permanent Change of Station (PCS); Temporary Duty (TDY). 
23.2.  Air Force Manpower, Organization and Resources Directorate (AF/A1M) will:  
23.2.1.  Serve as the Air Force office of primary responsibility for the individuals accounts and 
determines, justifies, defends, and plans its manpower programming. (T-1). 
23.2.2.  Determine the criteria by which the Air Force Personnel Center collects and reports 
individual manpower requirements data. (T-1).  
23.2.3.  Serve as the manpower program manager for the individuals accounts. (T-1). 
23.2.4.  Ensure centrally managed individuals manpower and supporting manpower is 
developed and funded in relationship to adjustments in overall Air Force accession levels. (T-
1). 
23.3.  Air Force Personnel Center Research Analysis and Data Division (AFPC/DSY) will: 
23.3.1.  Develop and maintain personnel data practice and procedures to support accurate 
accounting of members in “individuals” status. (T-1). 
23.3.2.  Ensure personnel functional category coding complies with the Individuals Account 
program funding established by AF/A1M. (T-1). 
23.3.3.  Justify the Transient, Personnel Holdee, Patient, and Separatee Program within the 
Military Personnel Program. (T-1). 
23.3.4.  Provide AF/A1M permanent change of station move requirements and other functions 
required for the development of transient, personnel holdee, patient, and separatee account 
man-years. (T-1).

AIR FORCE ORGANIZATION OBJECTIVES, PRINCIPLES AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
24.1.  Organization Objectives.  Air Force organizations are designed to achieve characteristics 
outlined in AFPD 38-1. 
24.2.  Organization Principles.  Air Force organizational structure follows these management 
principles: 
24.2.1.  Emphasis on Wartime Tasks.  Structure organizations to accomplish wartime tasks 
without reorganizing. (T-1). 
24.2.2.  Functional Grouping.  Structure organizations to have a clear-cut purpose, goal, and 
scope, with one individual in charge; parts that form a logical, separable activity; a close 
relationship among the parts, constituting a complete entity; and natural divisions of work that 
clearly define where responsibility begins and ends. (T-1). 
24.2.3.  Lean Organizational Structures.  Structure organizations to encourage rapid decision 
making, and reflect flat structures without intermediate levels unless mission requirements 
cannot otherwise be met. (T-1). When used, structure intermediate organizations consist of 
tactical functions only, without a full range of staff functions. (T-1). Organizational levels that 
exist only to review and transmit information or taskings may be eliminated.  Both the number 
of supervisors and the number of internal subdivisions within organizations will be designed 
to minimize layers and maximize worker-to-supervisor ratios. (T-1). 
24.2.4.  Skip Echelon Structure.  Structure organizations with appropriate staff based on their 
role. (T-1).  A Major Command sits on top of a skip echelon staffing structure.  Major 
commands, wings, and squadrons possess the full range of staff functions needed to perform 
required tasks.  Numbered and Named Air Forces, groups and flights have no or minimal staff.  
These tactical echelons are designed to increase operational effectiveness rather than to review 
and transmit paperwork.  The chain of command and responsibility for mission 
accomplishment runs through commanders at all levels.  Problems, however, often are solved 
by staff communication through the functional chain, bypassing echelons where the function 
is not found.  Component Numbered Air Forces possess a broader staff to support the Air Force 
Component Commander.  (See paragraph 25.2.5.1 and Figure 26.2) 
24.2.5.  Standard Levels. Use the standard levels described in Chapter 25 to design 
organizations. (T-1).  Establish organizations at the lowest level required to accomplish the 
primary mission. (T-1). Factors such as the scope of responsibility, span of control, and 
functional grouping of related missions and activities are the predominant factors that 
determine the organizational type. 
24.3.  Additional Responsibilities Assigned. 
24.3.1.  Headquarters Air Force and the Major Commands, Field Operating Agency, and 
Direct Reporting Units work toward meeting Air Force organizational goals.  AF/A1M leads 
and monitors progress.  Headquarters Air Force functional chiefs assist in their functional 
areas. 
68 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
24.3.2.  AF/A1M is responsible for the administrative control of all units in the Air Force.  It 
publishes Department of the Air Force (DAF)/A1M letters, which are the legal authority for a 
unit and authorize such actions as unit activations, redesignations, and inactivations. 
24.3.3.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units must follow 
the organizational procedures and standard structures described here. (T-1).  A Major 
Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit must have AF/A1M approval to 
deviate from a standard structure and to activate, redesignate, or inactivate units (see Chapter 
29 for procedures). (T-1). Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting 
Units approve nonstandard organizational structures while adhering to applicable guidance. 
(T-1).  Headquarters Air Force offices, designated field operating agencies, and other 
supported organizations work with the SAF/AAR for approval of nonstandard organizational 
structures.  (T-1). 
24.3.4.  Individual unit commanders must use the standard organizational structures found in 
this instruction. (T-1). If a unit's unique mission or location requires a different structure, a 
waiver to the standard structure can be requested using the organizational change procedures 
found in Chapter 29.  Units work with their servicing manpower activity on such requests.  
Note:  For most field units, this activity is in the Manpower and Organization Flight of the 
base Force Support Squadron.

Chapter 25 
STANDARD LEVELS AND STANDARD ELEMENTS OF AIR FORCE 
ORGANIZATION 
25.1.  Organizational Entities.  Air Force organizations will organize their component parts as 
establishments, units, and nonunits using the below guidance. (T-1). 
25.1.1.  Establishment. Air Force organizations will use the term to denote an organizational 
entity consisting of a headquarters unit and its subordinate units. (T-1).  Headquarters Air 
Force, Major Commands, Field Operating Agencies and Direct Reporting Units will put the 
name of the establishment in the name of the headquarters unit. (T-1).  For example, Air 
Mobility Command is an establishment; Headquarters Air Mobility Command is its 
headquarters.  Major Commands, Field Operating Agencies and Direct Reporting Units assign 
subordinate units to the establishment and not to the headquarters unit. (T-1). 
25.1.1.1.  Major Commands, Field Operating Agencies and Direct Reporting Units will 
have groups with subordinate squadrons as the lowest level establishment in their 
structures. (T-1). Headquarters Air Force, Major Commands, Field Operating Agencies 
and Direct Reporting Units will assign lower level establishments to higher level ones (e.g., 
groups to wings, wings to Numbered and Named Air Forces, Numbered and Named Air 
Forces to Major Commands, and Major Commands to the United States Air Force). (T-1).  
This arrangement (units reporting to establishments, subordinate establishments to superior 
ones) sets up the chain of command, through which all control and accountability flow. 
25.1.1.2.  Establishments facilitate organizational actions.  For example, the reassignment 
of a wing (establishment) from one Numbered Force to another automatically reassigns the 
wing's subordinate units. 
25.1.2.  Unit.  All Air Force organizations will use the following as the formal definition of a 
unit:  a military organization constituted by Headquarters Air Force or, for provisional units 
only, designated by a Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit. (T-
1).  A unit is either named or numbered. 
25.1.2.1.  A unit helps provide for an unbroken chain of command since military personnel 
are always assigned to a unit.  A unit will be headed by a “Commander” or, under approved 
circumstances, a civilian “Director.” (T-1).   Appointment of a civilian to lead a unit 
designates that unit as civilian-led.  When a civilian is appointed to lead a unit, that 
individual is the director of that unit.  (In the case of a civilian-led unit, the chain of 
command is maintained by having it reside with the first military unit Commander above 
the civilian-led unit.) 
25.1.2.1.1.  While civilians may provide supervision to military and civilian personnel 
in a unit, civilians cannot assume military command or exercise command over military 
members within the unit.  Units designated to be led by directors will not have 
commanders, because command authority will lie with the Commander of a superior 
unit, and alternative arrangements for functions, which are performed by commanders, 
are required (not waiverable). (T-1). (See AFI 51-509, Appointment to and Assumption 
of Command) 
70 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
25.1.2.1.2.  A civilian director of a unit may perform all functions normally performed 
by a unit Commander of similar position and authority except as required by law (e.g., 
Uniform Code of Military Justice) or controlling superior authority (e.g., Department 
of Defense guidance, instruction by a superior Commander).  For guidance concerning 
whether an authority or action is explicitly reserved for military commanders, contact 
the servicing staff Judge Advocate. 
25.1.2.2.  Air Force organizations will apply the following terms to units: 
25.1.2.2.1.  Active Unit. Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a Major 
Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit constituted and activated 
by Headquarters Air Force; or a subordinate unit constituted by Headquarters Air 
Force, assigned to a Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting 
Unit and activated by special order. (T-1). 
25.1.2.2.2.  Inactive Unit.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a unit 
constituted by Headquarters Air Force but not activated or a unit constituted, activated, 
and subsequently inactivated. (T-1). 
25.1.2.2.3.  Disbanded Unit.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a unit 
whose legal authority for existence is withdrawn by Headquarters Air Force.  Its 
designation is retired and preserved in historical records.  (T-1). 
25.1.2.2.4.  Parent Unit.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote an 
organization that directly administers units, detachments, or operating locations 
assigned to it. (T-1). 
25.1.2.2.5.  Provisional Unit.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a 
temporary unit organized to perform a specific task. (T-1). (See Chapter 31 for 
guidance on provisional units.) 
25.1.2.2.6.  Attached Unit.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a unit, 
or part of a unit, placed under the control of another organization for a specific purpose 
such as operational control, administrative control, or logistic support. (T-1).  It is still 
assigned to the parent unit. 
25.1.2.2.7.  Detached Unit.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a unit 
serving away from its organization of assignment. (T-1).  It may function 
independently, or may be attached to another organization. 
25.1.2.2.8.  Primary Subordinate Unit.  Air Force organizations will use this term to 
denote a unit that performs part or all of the primary mission of the organization to 
which it assigned. (T-1). The unit will report to the Commander of the parent 
organization and have full authority to execute its assigned mission. (T-1).  A primary 
subordinate unit’s purpose will be to perform part of its parent organization’s main 
mission and not to provide support functions for its parent headquarters. (T-1).  Under 
a Major Command, examples include Numbered Air Forces, Air University, and the 
Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. Similarly, under a wing, squadrons are 
primary subordinate units of their group and the groups are primary subordinate units 
of the wing. 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
71 
25.1.3.  Nonunit.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote an organizational entity 
that is not constituted by Headquarters Air Force as a unit. (T-1). Air Force organizations will 
apply the following terms to nonunit organizations: 
25.1.3.1.  Named Activity.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a part of a 
unit whose mission can be identified better by assigning it a definitive name that is 
designated in a DAF/A1M letter (e.g., the Civil Engineer School is part of a unit, the Air 
Force Institute of Technology).  (T-1). Headquarters Air Force administers the designation, 
redesignation, and inactivation of named activities and authorizes them by issuing 
DAF/A1M letters.  Every three years, AF/A1MO conducts a review with the Major 
Commands, field operating agencies, Direct Reporting Units, and SAF/AAR to validate 
the continuing requirement and proper alignment of named activities.   To avoid confusion 
with named activities (which are nonunits), do not include the word “Activity” in unit 
designations. (T-1). 
25.1.3.2.  Detachment.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a part of a unit 
that is separated geographically from its parent unit and that, although not a unit for 
organizational purposes, may have a Commander. (T-1).  If a commissioned officer is 
assigned and appointed on G-Series orders as a Commander, the Commander has 
nonjudicial punishment authority under the Uniform Code of Military Justice unless 
withheld by superior competent authority. (See AFI 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment.) 
25.1.3.3.  Operating Location.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a part 
of a unit that is separated geographically from its parent unit and that cannot have a 
commander. (T-1).  It is used to account for personnel by location.  Personnel remain 
assigned to the parent unit.  An operating location has none of the administrative attributes 
of a unit and does not have nonjudicial punishment authority under the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice. 
25.1.3.4.  Squadron Section.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a function 
responsible for the administrative control of all members assigned to a unit and that is 
created by appointing a Section Commander on special orders in accordance with guidance 
in AFI 51-509. (T-1). A Squadron Section Commander has nonjudicial punishment 
authority under the Uniform Code of Military Justice unless withheld by superior 
competent authority.  (See AFI 51-202.) Section commanders at other organizational levels 
may use a term reflecting their unit level (e.g., Group Section Commander). 
25.1.3.5.  Commander's Support Staff.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote 
a function responsible for providing direct support for a unit or Section Commander, 
primarily in administering unit personnel and administrative programs. (T-1).  In 
squadrons, the function uses the office symbol code (OSC) of “CCQ” and office symbol 
code title “Orderly Room.”  Above the squadron level, the office symbol code is “CSS” 
and the office title is “Commander's Support Staff.”  When a squadron section exists, this 
function falls under it. 
25.1.3.6.  Air Force Element.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a nonunit 
nomenclature used to account for manpower authorizations and to identify Air Force 
personnel on duty with organizations outside the Air Force, such as defense Agencies, 
defense field activities, and ANG units not in federal service. (T-1).   Although not a unit 
for organizational purposes, an Air Force Element may function as a unit if so designated 
72 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
by the competent authority, an eligible commissioned officer either assumes command or 
is appointed to command and Air Force members are assigned or attached to the Air Force 
Element. (See paragraph 27.3.3.5) 
25.2.  Standard Levels of Air Force Organization.  Air Force organizations will use the 
following terms to denote standard levels of organization used in structuring and designating Air 
Force units. (T-1). 
25.2.1.  Headquarters Air Force.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote the senior 
headquarters of the Air Force, consisting of the Secretariat (including the Secretary of the Air 
Force and the Secretary's principal staff) and the Air Staff, headed by the Chief of Staff of the 
Air Force. (T-1).  Detailed information on Headquarters Air Force’s mission, command 
structure, and responsibilities can be found in AFMD 1, Headquarters Air Force (HAF). 
25.2.2.  Major Command.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a major 
subdivision of the Air Force that is assigned a major part of the Air Force mission. (T-1).  A 
Major Command is directly subordinate to Headquarters Air Force. Most Major Commands 
have the word Command as part of their designation.  Do not include the word “Command” in 
the designation of any organization that is not a Major Command. (T-1).  Major command 
headquarters have the full range of functional staff (excluding functions that have been 
centralized elsewhere for Air Force-wide execution).  Major commands, in turn, may be 
subdivided per either of the organizational schemes shown in Figure 25.1  The levels in each 
scheme are in descending order and represent levels of assignment.  A unit cannot be assigned 
to an organization of equivalent or lower level. (T-1).   For example, a group can be assigned 
to any organization listed above it, but a group cannot be assigned to another group or a 
squadron.

25.2.2.1.  Lead Major Command.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a 
type of Major Command that consolidates responsibilities for a function in a single Major 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
73 
Command, supporting the entire Air Force as applicable. (T-1).  For example, Air 
Education and Training Command is the lead Major Command for education and training. 
25.2.2.2.  Component Major Command.  Air Force organizations will use this term to 
denote a type of Major Command that is the Air Force component to a Combatant 
Command. (T-1).  For example, Pacific Air Forces is a component Major Command that 
is the Air Force component to the United States Pacific Command.  A component Major 
Command is commanded by the Commander,  Air Force Forces and includes supporting 
staff and all assigned and attached forces.  A component Major Command may have one 
or more component Numbered or Named Air Force through which it presents its forces to 
the Combatant Commander.  The component Major Command integrates, at the strategic 
level, component activities across all phases of conflict.  The component Major Command 
staff should not duplicate the functions of the component Numbered Air Force Air Force 
Forces staff or air operations center. (See Figure 26.2)  The component Major Command 
Commander is the Combatant Commander’s theater Commander, Air Force Forces and 
may function as a theater Joint Force Air Component Commander when required.  Refer 
to Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) Volume 3, Command, for more information on 
component relationships and roles.  A Major Command can be both a component Major 
Command and a lead Major Command. 
25.2.3.  Direct Reporting Unit.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a 
subdivision of the Air Force, directly subordinate to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force that 
performs a mission that does not fit into any Major Command. (T-1).  A Direct Reporting Unit 
has many of the same administrative and organizational responsibilities as a Major Command.  
(See paragraph 29.2.4 for more guidance on the establishment of Direct Reporting Units.) 
25.2.3.1.  Major Command Direct Reporting Unit.  Direct reporting unit also applies to a 
subdivision of a Major Command.  A Major Command Direct Reporting Unit reports 
directly to the Major Command Commander and performs a mission that does not fit into 
any of the Major Command's primary subordinate units.  (See paragraph 29.2.4 for more 
guidance on the establishment of Major Command Direct Reporting Units.) 
25.2.4.  Field Operating Agency (FOA).  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote 
a subdivision of the Air Force, directly subordinate to a Headquarters Air Force functional 
manager. (T-1).  A Field Operating Agency performs field activities beyond the scope of any 
Major Command.  The activities are specialized or associated with an Air Force-wide mission.  
Field operating agencies will minimize staff functions. (T-2).  Air Force field operating 
agencies usually have the word Agency as part of their designation.  Do not include the word 
“Agency” in the designation of any organization that is not a Field Operating Agency directly 
under Headquarters Air Force. (T-1).  Organization guidance for Major Commands also 
applies to large Air Force field operating agencies that are structured along Major Command 
lines.   (See paragraph 29.2.4 for more guidance on the establishment of field operating 
agencies.) 
25.2.4.1.  Major Command Field Operating Agency.  Field operating agency also applies 
to a subdivision of a Major Command.  A Major Command Field Operating Agency reports 
directly to a Major Command functional principal (e.g., two-letter office such as “director”) 
and performs specialized field activities beyond the scope of any of the Major Command's 
primary subordinate units.  The activities are specialized and are associated with the Major 
74 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
Command or theater-wide missions that transcend the scope of routine wing functions.  
Major command field operating agencies minimize staff functions.  (See paragraph 29.2.4 
for more guidance on the establishment of Major Command field operating agencies.) 
25.2.5.  Numbered or Named Air Force (NAF).  Air Force organizations will use this term to 
denote a level of command directly under a Major Command providing operational leadership 
and supervision. (T-1).  A NAF is assigned subordinate units, such as wings, groups, and 
squadrons.  They do not have complete functional staffs. 
25.2.5.1.  Numbered or Named Air Forces designated as “Component Numbered Air 
Forces” (C-NAF) provide support at the operational and tactical level.  When designated 
as the Air Force component to a Combatant Command, the component Numbered Air 
Force functions at the strategic, operational, and tactical level.  A component Numbered 
Air Force is authorized a broader staff as depicted in Figure 26.2 
25.2.5.2.  The number of persons assigned to a Numbered or Named Air Force 
headquarters varies from case to case, but, except for component Numbered Air Forces, 
will not exceed 99 manpower authorizations without an approved waiver from AF/A1M. 
(T-1).  The size of the component Numbered or Named Air Force headquarters staff is not 
limited to 99 manpower authorizations. 
25.2.6.  Wing.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a level of command below 
the Numbered or Named Air Force or higher headquarters with a distinct mission with 
significant scope and usually composed of a primary mission group (e.g., operations, training) 
and the necessary supporting groups. (T-1).  By pulling together the mission and support 
elements, a wing provides a significant capability under a single commander.  It is often 
responsible for maintaining the installation.  A wing will have several squadrons in more than 
one dependent group. (T-1).  Wings will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 1,000 
per paragraph 25.2.15 (See Table 25.1 for waiver approval authorities). A wing may be either 
an operational wing, an air base wing, or a specialized mission wing. 
25.2.6.1.  Operational Wing.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a wing 
that has an operations group and related operational mission activity assigned to it. (T-1).  
When an operational wing performs the primary mission of the base, it usually maintains 
and operates the base.  Also, an operational wing is capable of self-support in functional 
areas such as maintenance, supply, and conventional munitions, as needed. When an 
operational wing is a tenant organization, the host organization provides it with varying 
degrees of base and logistics support. 
25.2.6.2.  Air Base Wing.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a wing that 
performs support rather than an operational mission that maintains and operates a base. (T-
1).  An air base wing sometimes provides functional support to a Major Command 
headquarters. 
25.2.6.3.  Specialized Mission Wing.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote 
a wing that performs a specialized mission and usually does not have aircraft or missiles 
assigned to it (e.g., intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance wing; training wing). (T-
1).  This wing may be either a host wing or a tenant wing, depending on whether it 
maintains and operates the base. 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
75 
25.2.7.  Group.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a level of command 
between wings and squadrons. (T-1).  Groups bring together multiple squadrons or other lower 
echelon units to provide a broader capability.  For instance, a mission support group pulls 
together several squadrons in a variety of areas to provide a full spectrum mission support 
capability.  A group is generally a tactical echelon without significant staff support.  A group 
has two or more subordinate units. (T-1). Groups will have a minimum adjusted population of 
at least 400 per paragraph 25.2.15 (See Table 25.1 for waiver approval authorities). 
25.2.7.1.  Dependent Group.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a 
dependent group is a mission, maintenance, mission support, medical, or large functional 
unit (e.g., civil engineer) that encompasses a number of related squadrons to provide the 
specified capability to a parent wing. (T-1).  Such groups may possess small supporting 
staff elements, such as standardization and evaluation or quality control that are organized 
as sections. 
25.2.7.2.  Independent Group.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote an 
independent group has the same functions and responsibilities as a similar wing, but its 
scope and size do not warrant wing-level designation and associated overhead costs. (T-
1). 
25.2.8.  Squadron.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote the basic unit in the 
Air Force that is the basic building block organization in the Air Force, providing a specific 
operational or support capability. (T-1).  A squadron may be either a mission unit, such as an 
operational flying squadron, or a functional unit, such as a civil engineer, security forces, or 
maintenance squadron.  A squadron has a substantive mission of its own that warrants 
organization as a separate unit based on factors such as unity of command, functional grouping, 
and administrative control, balanced with the efficient use of resources.  Squadrons vary in 
size according to their responsibility but will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 
35 per paragraph 25.2.15 (See Table 25.1 for waiver approval authorities).  Do not fragment 
a capability into multiple squadrons when a single squadron provides a parent wing or group 
commander the best approach regarding a coordinated, focused capability under single 
direction.  In extreme cases, when squadron population exceeds 700 manpower authorizations, 
Major Commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units may request the 
establishment of two squadrons. Functional squadrons will employ the 7-series numbering 
convention in these instances (i.e., “XX” and “7XX” Squadrons). (T-1). 
25.2.9.  Flight.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a level of organization 
lower than a squadron.  (T-1).  If an internal subdivision is required, a flight may consist of 
sections, then elements.  A flight may be either a Numbered or Named Flight, alpha flight, or 
a functional flight. 
25.2.9.1.  Numbered or Named Flight.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote 
the lowest level unit in the Air Force. (T-1).  A Numbered or Named Flight primarily 
incorporates smaller elements into an organized unit that is constituted by a DAF/A1M 
letter.  Its administrative characteristics, such as strength reporting, are like those of a 
squadron.  As a unit, it is authorized a Commander.  Functions requiring unit status that 
are not large enough to be squadrons may be considered for Numbered and Named Flight 
level.  Because a Numbered or Named Flight is a unit, it is assigned to an establishment at 
76 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
the group level or higher rather than to a squadron.  Examples of this type of flight are the 
497th Combat Training Flight and Air Mobility Command Safety Flight. 
25.2.9.2.  Alpha Flight.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a part of a 
squadron (usually a mission squadron) and composed of several elements performing 
identical missions. (T-1).   Because an alpha flight is not a unit, it is not subject to unit 
reporting.  An example of this type of flight is an “A” flight in an operations squadron. 
25.2.9.3.  Functional Flight.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a 
squadron composed of elements performing specific missions. (T-1).  Because a functional 
flight is not a unit, it is not subject to unit reporting.  An example of this type of flight is a 
Manpower and Organization Flight in a Force Support Squadron. 
25.2.10.  Center.  Air Force organizations will use this term to denote a named unit that 
performs a specialized mission, typically for a larger function that performs most of its mission 
at one location and has few subordinate units such as the Space and Missile Systems Center. 
(T-1).  However, extremely large centers such as those for sustainment, life cycle management, 
and test may have multiple subordinate units and nonunits at several locations. 
25.2.11.  Laboratory.  Air Force organizations may use this term to denote an organization that 
performs research or advanced development missions. 
25.2.12.  Region.   Air Force organizations may use this term to denote a unit whose 
organization is geographic. 
25.2.13.  Complex.  Air Force organizations may use this term to denote a named unit that 
performs a related set of missions within some specialized facilities predominantly on one 
installation.  Predominantly used for sustainment, research, or development missions (e.g., the 
air logistics complexes and the Arnold Engineering Development Complex). 
25.2.14.  Named Component Headquarters.  Air Force organizations will use this term to 
denote a named unit that serves as an Air Force component to a Combatant Command. (T-1). 
It is a command echelon under a Major Command.  Named component headquarters plan, 
command, control, execute, and assess air, space, and information operations across the full 
range of military operations.  Air Force forces and units are assigned or attached as required to 
support the Combatant Command. 
25.2.15.  Organization Size Guidance for Wings, Groups, and Squadrons. 
25.2.15.1.  Adjusted population minimums shall be 1,000 for wings, 400 for groups and 35 
for squadrons (See Table 25.1 for waiver approval authorities).  Adjusted populations 
include: 
25.2.15.1.1.  Funded manpower authorizations as reflected in the Manpower 
Programming and Execution System (See Attachment 2). 
25.2.15.1.2.  Average daily student load (ADSL) or, for the United States Air Force 
Academy, cadets or preparatory school cadet candidates.  Compute ADSL for adjusted 
populations per this instruction as follows:  Multiply the number of course days by the 
total number of students and then divide that result by 246 (the annual available days 
for training in line with similar AETC computations).  Round to the nearest whole 
number (round up for .5 and above and round down for .49 and below).  ADSL can be 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
77 
included only for training courses approved at Major Command level or higher and for 
which the unit has significant student oversight responsibilities. 
25.2.15.1.3.  A percentage of the contractor workforce.  Specifically, one-third of the 
contractor full-time equivalent reflected in the Manpower Programming and Execution 
System for a unit may be counted when: 
25.2.15.1.3.1.  The contractor full-time equivalent portion counts for no more than 
30 percent of the adjusted population used to meet unit size minimums.  In other 
words, before contractor full-time equivalents may be considered, adjusted 
populations are at least 700 for wings, 280 for groups and 25 for squadrons. 
25.2.15.1.3.2.  This guidance recognizes the role of contractors in mission 
accomplishment while reflecting the reduced supervisory responsibilities.  It also 
ensures Air Force units are made up of predominantly Air Force assets. 
25.2.15.2.  Additional Specialized Guidance. 
25.2.15.2.1.  A unit reflected as a squadron in the Force Tabs may maintain its squadron 
status regardless of size.  (SAF/FMP maintains the Force Tabs as part of the Program 
Data System per AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, 
Distribution, Accounting and Termination.) 
25.2.15.2.2.  A wing with other dependent groups may have an operations group if it 
has multiple squadrons reflected in the Force Tabs, regardless of the operations group’s 
size. 
25.2.15.2.3.  An Associate unit may be a squadron if the unit whose weapons system(s) 
it shares is a squadron.  Refer to AFI 90-1001, Planning Total Force Associations 
(TFAs), for further information on associated units. 
25.2.15.2.4.  Additional Specialized Guidance for ANG and Air Force Reserve 
Command units.  Using standard wing and group organization structures in the Air 
Reserve Component enhances their ability to transition smoothly to the expeditionary 
environment and interface with Regular Air Force organizations, although Air Reserve 
Component wings and groups are often smaller because of factors such as a more 
experienced workforce with a smaller trainee population, fewer aircraft at a location, 
and smaller installation support infrastructure.  Air Reserve Component units follow 
standard unit size and organizational guidance in all other respects, except for: 
25.2.15.2.4.1.  Specialized adjusted population minimums for ANG and Air Force 
Reserve Command units shall be 750 for wings and 200 for groups (See Table 25.1 
for waiver approval authorities). 
25.2.15.2.4.2.  An ANG or Air Force Reserve Command wing with other 
dependent groups may have an operations group if it has at least one operations 
squadron that is reflected in the Force Tabs or is an associate squadron, plus at least 
one other unit (e.g., operations support squadron).  This is like the guidance for 
Regular Air Force operations groups but reflects that many Air Reserve Component 
wings have only one flying unit. 
25.2.15.2.4.3.  Adjusted populations for ANG units may include a percentage of 
the State employees.  This recognizes the contribution of State employees while 
78 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
reflecting the differing roles and supervisory aspects.   Specifically, one-third of the 
State employees for a unit may be counted when the State employee portion counts 
for no more than 30 percent of the adjusted population used to meet unit size 
minimums.  In other words, before State employees may be considered, adjusted 
populations (excluding contractor full-time equivalents) are at least 525 for wings, 
140 for groups and 25 for squadrons.   Contractor full-time equivalents are excluded 
from the adjusted population when assessing if the State employee portion counts 
for no more than 30 percent to ensure units are made up predominantly of assets 
directly associated with Air Force.  The specified percentages of State employees 
and contractor full-time equivalents may be included in the final total adjusted 
population if the minimums have been met. 
25.2.15.2.5.  Additional Specialized Guidance for Medical Units. 
25.2.15.2.5.1.  Medical squadrons will follow the standard size guidance and 
applicable standard structures in this instruction (See Table 25.1 for waiver 
approval authorities). 
25.2.15.2.5.2.  Regardless of size, medical groups are authorized when all the 
following are met:  the organization reports to a wing per Figure 26.3, Wing 
Structure, in this instruction; the organization is structured per the medical group 
standard structures in this instruction; and the organization has multiple subordinate 
squadrons that meet standard size guidance and follow the standard structures in 
this instruction. 
25.2.15.2.5.3.  Medical wings will follow the standard size guidance for wings and 
have multiple subordinate groups (See Table 25.1 for waiver approval authorities). 
25.2.15.2.5.4.  The specialized medical unit guidance does not apply to Air Reserve 
Component units per paragraph 26.27.4 which specifies the standard medical 
group structures do not apply to the Air Reserve Component.  Because of the 
organization threshold review of medical units, AF/SG addresses the Air Reserve 
Component medical units and their structure in the Medical Flight Path. 
25.2.15.2.6.  Additional Specialized Guidance for Comptroller Squadrons.  This 
guidance applies to comptroller squadrons to recognize their fiduciary requirements 
and responsibility for wing staff administration.  Comptroller squadrons that provide 
administrative and Uniform Code of Military Justice support to their parent wing 
headquarters staff per paragraph 26.4.2, may adjust their population to include one-
third of that wing staff’s funded military manpower authorizations.  This additional 
population can account for no more than 30 percent of the adjusted population needed 
to meet squadron size minimums. In other words, before wing staff may be considered, 
a comptroller squadron has at least 25 funded manpower authorizations. 
25.2.15.2.7.  Additional Specialized Guidance for Overseas Units with Foreign 
National Indirect Hire Civilian Employees.  Adjusted populations for overseas units 
may include a percentage of foreign national indirect hire employees.  This recognizes 
the contribution of those employees while reflecting the differing roles and supervisory 
aspects. 
25.2.15.2.7.1.  Specifically, one-third of foreign national indirect hire employees 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
79 
for a unit may be counted when the foreign national indirect hire employee portion 
counts for no more than 30 percent of the adjusted population used to meet unit size 
minimums.  In other words, before they may be considered, adjusted populations 
(excluding contractor full-time equivalents) are at least 700 for wings, 280 for 
groups and 25 for squadrons. 
25.2.15.2.7.2.  Contractor full-time equivalents are excluded from the adjusted 
population when assessing if the foreign national indirect hire employee portion 
counts for no more than 30 percent to ensure units are made up predominantly of 
assets directly associated with the Air Force. The specified percentages of foreign 
national indirect hire employees and contractor full-time equivalents may be 
included in the final total adjusted population if the minimums have been met. 
25.2.15.3.  MAJCOM/A1Ms will monitor unit sizes on an ongoing basis to ensure units 
are named and organized per the guidance in this instruction. (T-1). 
25.2.15.4.  AF/A1M reviews wing, group, and squadron sizes every two years to ensure 
compliance with organization size guidance.  Approval levels for waivers to wing, group 
and squadron size guidance are shown in Table 25.1 AF/A1M provides guidance on how 
to submit waiver requests during the biennial reviews.  Paragraph 29.2.2.4 provides 
guidance on requesting wing, group, and squadron size waivers that are needed as part of 
an organization change request at other times.

25.2.15.5.  Expeditionary Units.  Major commands will strive to organize expeditionary 
units per the organization size guidance but may authorize variances when necessary 
because of factors such as operational needs, relationships with other Service or coalition 
forces, or to avoid turbulence because of population fluctuations. (T-1).  (See Chapter 31 
for general guidance on provisional units.) 
25.3.  Standard Elements of Air Force Organization.   Air Force organizations will use the 
following terms to denote organizational elements within command and staff functions: 
25.3.1.  Command. 
25.3.1.1.  Air Force organizations will use the term Commander to denote an officer who 
occupies a position of command under orders of appointment or by the assumption of 
command per AFI 51-509. (T-1).  This designation is used in all Air Force units except 
for: 
25.3.1.1.1.  The United States Air Force Academy, which is commanded by a 
superintendent. 
80 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
25.3.1.1.2.  Other school organizations, which may be commanded by commandants. 
Commandants of nonunit school organizations are not commanders. 
25.3.1.1.3.  A unit with a civilian leader.  When a civilian is appointed to lead a unit, 
that individual is the director of the unit.  A unit designated to be led by a civilian 
director will not have a Commander, Section Commander or detachment Commander 
(this is not waiverable).  Internal functional flight heads using the duty title of “flight 
commander” may continue to use this title since they are not unit commanders with 
corresponding legal command authority. (T-1). 
25.3.1.1.3.1.  Major command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit 
headquarters may approve the designation of a unit to be led by a civilian director 
instead of a military Commander subject to the restrictions within this instruction 
or other applicable guidance.  Headquarters Air Force approval under the waiver 
process in this instruction is required for approval under any other circumstances. 
25.3.1.1.3.2.  Civilian unit directors must be full-time Department of the Air Force 
appropriated fund employees who have completed any applicable probationary 
periods. (T-1). Civilian unit directors must be United States citizens. (T-1). 
25.3.1.1.3.3.  A unit will not have a civilian unit director and must have a military 
Commander if:  the unit is committed as a unit to a combat mission or to fill a 
mobility requirement; the unit or an organization subordinate to the unit has a flying 
mission; the unit has a medical mission; the unit is above wing level (Exception:  
This restriction does not apply to Air Force Field Operating Agency and Major 
Command Field Operating Agency headquarters units); the unit is one whose leader 
may normally function as an installation Commander; the unit is an expeditionary 
or provisional unit; or the unit is in the Air Force Reserve Command or ANG (this 
restriction does not limit traditional Reserve and ANG Technician arrangements; 
see AFI 51-509 for more guidance specific to Air Reserve Component 
commanders). (T-1). 
25.3.1.1.3.4.  Since civilians cannot exercise command over military members, and 
no member of the unit or subordinate unit can assume command of the unit, it is 
advisable to establish a succession plan for leadership of the unit so it is prepared 
for the possibility that the civilian leader might become incapacitated.  Refer to AFI 
51-509 for guidance on command authority matters for units led by civilian 
directors. 
25.3.1.1.3.5.  Civilian unit leaders will use an office symbol code of “CL” (Civilian 
Unit Leader). (T-1).  Civilian unit leaders will not use the title “Commander” nor 
an office symbol code of “CC” (Commander). (T-1). 
25.3.1.1.3.5.1.  Since units with civilian leaders do not have commanders, the 
titles and office symbol codes for Vice Commander (CV) and Deputy 
Commander (CD) cannot be used for either military or civilian members in such 
units.  When authorized, a primary subordinate who shares the civilian 
director’s duties and acts for the director in the director’s absence will use the 
title “Deputy Director” and the office symbol code of “DD.” (T-1).  The title 
“Vice Director” and office symbol code of “DV” will be used for such a primary 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019

Chapter 26 
STANDARD ORGANIZATIONS 
26.1.  Organization Structure.   
26.1.1.  This chapter prescribes standard organizational structures for use to the lowest level 
shown.  Illustrative figures include approved organizational titles.  (See Figures 26.1 through 
26.36)  Organization structures are illustrated to the lowest mandatory levels. Headquarters Air 
Force and Major Command functional and manpower, organization, and resources focal points 
are authorized to develop standard organization structures below the mandatory level.  This 
chapter also reflects standard office symbol codes. 
26.1.2.  Organizational Variations.  Each figure depicts a standard organizational structure for 
a unit or function.  AF/A1M must approve any variations from the standard structure. (T-1).  
Variations from standard structures should have a clear, overriding purpose that has easily 
recognizable and defensible organizational and cost benefits.  Major commands, field 
operating agencies and Direct Reporting Units submit variation requests as described in 
Chapter 29 of this instruction when a standard function does not exist at a location, when 
functions are combined because of small size, or when units are responsible for activities not 
accounted for in standard structures. 
26.1.3.  Functions and Responsibilities.  Each figure depicts the standard organizational 
structure and accompanying paragraphs list typical functions and responsibilities performed 
by an organization.  These functions and responsibilities are not comprehensive but are 
intended to give an understanding of activity that fits in each organizational block. 
26.1.4.  The standard squadron organizational structures prescribed in Chapter 26 also apply 
to units with the respective unit kinds that are organized as Numbered Flights because of 
organization size guidance.  When the unit is a Numbered Flight, the internal subdivisions are 
sections. 
26.1.5.  The standard organizational structures prescribed in Chapter 26 also apply to 
similarly named units that include “Special Operations” in their designations. 
26.2.  Numbered and Named Air Force.  The Numbered and Named Air Force is a command 
echelon directly under a Major Command that is focused on ensuring the readiness of assigned 
forces.  It prepares forces for deployment and employment. 
26.2.1.  Basic Numbered and Named Air Force Structure.  The basic Numbered and Named 
Air Force structure is in Figure 26.1 
84 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
Figure 26.1.  Basic Numbered and Named Air Force Structure (Does not apply to 
component Numbered Air Forces). 
 
26.2.2.  Component Numbered Air Force Structure. The component Numbered Air Force 
structure is in Figure 26.2 
Figure 26.2.  Component Numbered Air Force Structure. 
 
26.2.2.1.  A component Numbered Air Force is a specialized category of Numbered and 
Named Air Force that is structured to perform an operational and warfighting mission in 
support of a Combatant Command.  The component Numbered and Named Air Force is a 
command echelon directly under a Major Command.  The component Numbered Air Force 
plans, commands, controls, executes, and assesses air, space, and information operation 
capabilities across the full range of military operations.  The component Numbered Air 
Force normally consists of an Air Force Forces staff and an air operations center as depicted 
in Figure 26.2  Air Force Forces and units are assigned or attached as required to support 
the Combatant Command. 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
85 
26.2.2.2.  Organization Variations.  Elements of personal staff may be reduced or 
eliminated as much as practical through support agreements and reach back.  The personal 
staff may include Protocol (CCP), Political and Military Advisor (CCT), Judge Advocate 
(JA), Public Affairs (PA), Historian (HO), Chaplain (HC), Safety (SE), Surgeon (SG), 
Financial Management (FM), Reserve Affairs (RE), Information Protection (IP), and 
Inspector General (IG).  The rest of the component Numbered Air Force staff consists of 
the standard Air Force A1–A9 staff functions.   (See Figure 27.1 and paragraph 27.4.4 
for information on A-staff office symbol codes.)  A-staff two-digit functions may be linked 
(e.g., A3 and A5 as A3/5), but separate functional staffs are maintained.  Component 
Numbered Air Forces are authorized to use the “Chief of Staff” (CS) title as a variance to 
paragraph 25.3.2.1 of this instruction. Component Numbered Air Force responsibilities 
may vary depending on the capabilities provided by the Major Command. 26.3 Standard 
Wing. 
Figure 26.3.  Wing Structure. 
 
26.3.1.  Standard Wing Structure and Responsibilities.  The standard wing generates and 
employs combat capability.  One Commander has the authority and responsibility to command 
the wing.  The standard operational wing structure is a wing with four dependent groups 
(Operations, Maintenance, Mission Support, and Medical) with related functions and 
disciplines aligned under the appropriate group.  Generally, only the wing staff, comptroller 
unit, and the four group commanders report directly to the wing Commander.  So, the wing 
86 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
Commander concentrates on the wing's primary mission and delegates authority to 
subordinates so they can accomplish their responsibilities.  Major wing functions are divided 
among a few principal subordinates, each accountable for carrying out a specific part of the 
wing mission. Responsibilities are clearly defined, and duplication is avoided.  While the 
standard wing is organized for combat operations, its basic structure is applied to all types of 
wings (for instance, air base and specialized mission wings). 
26.3.2.  Organization Variations. 
26.3.2.1.  Where applicable, air control squadrons are part of the Operations Group. 
26.3.2.2.  Where applicable, munitions squadrons are part of the Maintenance Group. 
26.3.2.3.  Where applicable, aerial port squadrons are part of the Mission Support Group.  
Aerial port squadron alignment is under review. 
26.3.3.  Staffing of a Standard Wing.  A wing is organized as an operational unit with 
manpower requirements set at those levels required for mission success.  A standard or core 
manpower level exists for each organization defined in this instruction. 
Figure 26.4.  Wing Staff Structure. 
 
26.4.1.  Wing Staff Organization.  Wing staff functions report to the wing Commander.  A 
wing staff function may be referred to as an office, e.g., a Public Affairs Office.  The senior 
staff member is referred to as the Chief.  Figure 26.4 and the related descriptions in the 
subparagraphs under 26.4.1 reflect separate wing staff functional offices.  This does not include 
individual positions or activities immediately under the “CC” or “CV” as reflected by “CC” or 
“CV” office symbol codes, such as the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (CVS), Drug 
Demand Reduction Program (CVD), or Installation Resilience Program (CVB). 
26.4.1.1.  Public

currently shown in this AFI will still be retained at some locations.  However, at most 
installations in the continental United States, Aerospace Medicine Squadrons and Medical 
Operations Squadrons will be replaced by Operational Medical Readiness Squadrons and 
Healthcare Operations Squadrons, with the goal of transitioning most Medical Groups to have 
one unit focused on Airmen medical readiness and separate units focused on all other beneficiary 
categories and support functions.  Dental Squadrons and some Medical Support Squadrons will 
inactivate at AF/SG identified locations in the continental United States.  Medical Support 
Squadrons at larger locations and other specialized medical squadrons will be retained at specific

squadrons based on group size and mission.  Medical Groups typically have two or three 
squadrons, including Medical Operations and Medical Support Squadrons and, if required 
because of special mission requirements, one or more of these squadrons: Aerospace 
Medicine, Dental, Inpatient Operations, or Surgical Operations.  Medical Groups with 
more than 1,000 authorizations may also have a Diagnostics and Therapeutics Squadron if 
required. 
26.27.3.2.  Figures 26.28.  through 26.34 depict the authorized squadron and flight 
variations. Major commands may approve changes to a Medical Group’s squadron or flight 
configuration that are per Figures 26.28 through 26.34 and unit size guidance.  To receive 
a DAF/A1M letter for such actions involving squadron activations, inactivations or 
redesignations, Major Commands submit them on a DAF/A1M letter request sheet per 
paragraph 30.1.2.2 at least two months before implementation and annotate the 
appropriate rationale for the action in the remarks section.  Major commands submit 
requests for variances to these figures to AF/A1MO under this instruction. 
26.27.3.3.  Medical Squadrons are authorized at small locations or when the medical unit 
is assigned to an Air Base Group and may include but are not limited to these functional 
flights: Medical Support, Medical Operations, Aerospace Medicine, and Dental.  Limited-
scope medical treatment facilities are authorized as Medical functional flights or small 
Medical Squadrons assigned to an Air Base Squadron, Air Base Group or a support group

Chapter 27 
TERMINOLOGY AND PROCEDURES FOR ORGANIZATION ACTIONS 
27.1.  Organization Actions. 
27.1.1.  Use the terminology and related procedures outlined in this chapter to make an 
organization change.  Implementation of organization actions is to be per applicable provisions 
of AFI 10-503, Strategic Basing.  Procedures and responsibilities in this chapter apply to Major 
Commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units.  SAF/AAR may perform 
these functions for their supported organizations.  See Chapter 29 for the organization change 
request process. 
27.2.  Organization Terminology. 
27.2.1.  Constitute. Provide the legal authority for a new unit by designating it in a DAF/A1M 
letter. 
27.2.2.  Disband.  Withdraw the legal authority for a unit.  The designation of the unit is retired 
and preserved in historical records. 
27.2.3.  Reconstitute.  Renew legal authorization of a disbanded unit. 
27.2.4.  Activate.  Bring into existence a constituted unit, a detachment of a unit, or a 
provisional unit.  An active unit can legally function as specified by directives. 
27.2.5.  Inactivate.  End the existence of a unit, detachment of a unit, or provisional unit.  An 
inactive unit keeps its lineage, history, honors, and is available for activation when needed 
again (applies to non-provisional units; see Chapter 31 for information on provisional units). 
Inactivate units when their mission ceases to exist and all resources are withdrawn. (T-1). 
27.2.6.  Designate.  Give an official name (or a number and name). 
27.2.7.  Redesignate.  Change the name or number. 
27.2.8.  Consolidate.  To permanently combine two or more organizations by merging their 
lineage into a single line to form a single organization.  Consolidation usually applies to 
organizations that were active at different times but have the same numerical designations or 
similar functions.  Units that have been active concurrently cannot be consolidated.  A 
consolidated unit cannot subsequently be separated. 
27.2.9.  Assign.  Place a unit with an existing military organization. 
27.2.10.  Attach.  Place a unit, or part of a unit, with a military organization other than its parent 
organization, without making it a part of that organization.  A unit, or part of a unit, may be 
attached for operational control, administrative control, and logistic support. 
27.2.10.1.  Operational Control.  The authority of a Commander over subordinate forces to 
organize and employ commands and forces, assign tasks, designate objectives, and give 
direction necessary to accomplish the mission.  This is applicable at Combatant Command 
echelon and below. 
27.2.10.2.  Administrative Control.  Direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or 
other organizations concerning administration and support.  Examples of administrative 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
129 
control are the Uniform Code of Military Justice authority, personnel classification, 
effectiveness reports, and granting leaves and so on. 
27.2.10.3.  Logistic Support.  The support provided by one organization to another, 
enabling that organization to carry out operations.  Examples include supply, maintenance, 
logistics planning, transportation, and contracting.  An order that states a unit is attached 
for logistic support only clearly means operational control and administrative control are 
not responsibilities of the Commander to which the unit is attached.  The order itself does 
not detail the extent and kind of logistic support, as this support is clarified through separate 
documents, such as host-tenant support agreements. 
27.2.11.  Allot.  Authorize a unit to be part of the ANG.  DAF/A1M letters allot units to the 
National Guard Bureau that in turn assigns them to the appropriate state, territory, or the 
District of Columbia. 
27.2.12.  Status Change.  Change the organizational status of a Major Command, Field 
Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit.  A DAF/A1M letter accomplishes a status 
change.  A redesignation often accompanies status changes.  For example, the status change of 
the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency from a Field Operating 
Agency to a subordinate organization of Air Combat Command was accompanied by its 
redesignation to Twenty-Fifth Air Force. 
27.3.  Organization Procedures.  The following procedures apply to organizational entities 
within the Air Force: 
27.3.1.  Establishments. 
27.3.1.1.  An establishment is automatically created when its headquarters unit is activated. 
27.3.1.2.  An establishment is controlled through its headquarters.  However, subordinate 
units are assigned to the establishment, not to the headquarters unit.  This enables each unit 
within an establishment to have a separate identity.  The fact that the headquarters unit 
controls the establishment places the other units subordinate to it.  Personnel are assigned 
to a unit, not to an establishment. 
27.3.1.3.  The assignment of any establishment assigns all its components at the same time 
unless otherwise specified.  For example, when a wing is assigned to a Numbered Air 
Force, the assignment of the wing's groups and squadrons also is to the Numbered Air 
Force.  The separation of units by location does not affect their assignment to the 
establishment. 
27.3.1.4.  Inactivation of a headquarters unit automatically inactivates the establishment.  
Units assigned to the establishment automatically revert, unless otherwise directed, to the 
next higher level. 
27.3.2.  Units. 
27.3.2.1.  Headquarters Air Force issues a DAF/A1M letter to constitute and activate Major 
Commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units.  For a unit subordinate 
to a Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit, Headquarters Air 
Force constitutes the unit and assigns it to the Major Command, Field Operating Agency, 
or Direct Reporting Unit for activation.  The Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or 
Direct Reporting Unit will activate and assign the unit by issuing a G-series order citing 
130 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
the DAF/A1M letter as authority. (T-1).  A DAF/A1M letter also can authorize a Major 
Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit to redesignate or inactivate 
a unit.  An inactivated unit reverts to the control of Headquarters Air Force.  DAF/A1M 
letters and G-series orders follow the formats prescribed in Chapter 30 and illustrated in 
Attachment 4. 
27.3.2.2.  A Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit may 
reassign a unit internally unless the unit's assignment is specified in a DAF/A1M letter or 
by a standard structure prescribed in this instruction. 
27.3.2.3.  A unit may be reassigned from one Major Command, Field Operating Agency, 
or Direct Reporting Unit to another.  In this case, the losing Major Command, Field 
Operating Agency or Direct Reporting Unit (after coordinating with the receiving Major 
Command, Field Operating Agency or Direct Reporting Unit) requests AF/A1M approve 
the reassignment on a date agreed to by both commands (if agreed to by both parties, the 
receiving command may make the request, or the commands may make a joint request).  A 
DAF/A1M letter directs the reassignment of such units and copies are sent to both 
commands. 
27.3.2.4.  The effective date of an organization action (e.g., activation, inactivation, or 
redesignation) is published either in the DAF/A1M letter or orders issued by the Major 
Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit.  When a DAF/A1M letter 
allows the effective date to be on or about a certain date, the organization action must occur 
no more than 30 calendar days before or after that date. (T-1). 
27.3.2.5.  Numbered Flights are units and require the same organization procedures as 
other units. Alpha and functional flights, however, are not units and are not subject to this 
chapter's procedures. 
27.3.3.  Nonunits.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units 
have the approval authority to activate, inactivate, and redesignate detachments and operating 
locations. (See below for specifics such as how to designate them and restrictions on 
redesignations.)  The above organizations and Admin Assistant to the Secretary of the Air 
Force, Manpower (SAF/AARM), (for serviced organizations) may approve variances to 
paragraphs 27.3.3.1.2 and 27.3.3.2.6 regarding sequencing of detachment and operating 
location designations when warranted.  Examples of circumstances that might warrant a 
variance include operational needs, to maintain continuity, or to identify with a particular 
related organization or location (such as joint bases).  In all cases, detachments must remain 
numeric and operating locations remain alphabetical. (T-1).  MAJCOM/A1M focal points will 
conduct an annual detachment and operating location review to validate the continuing 
requirement for the activity. (T-1). 
27.3.3.1.  Detachments. 
27.3.3.1.1.  A Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit may 
activate a detachment for a function that is geographically separated from its parent 
unit.  A detachment is activated to fill a need for command or supervision, or for other 
reasons, such as to facilitate unit movement.  If there is a need for command authority, 
the senior officer on duty with a detachment is appointed on orders as detachment 
Commander.  Normally, a geographically separated organization is designated an 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
131 
operating location unless on-site command authority is required.  Then, it is designated 
as a detachment. 
27.3.3.1.2.  Detachments are numbered in sequence, beginning with “1.” 
27.3.3.1.3.  A detachment can be redesignated to another number within the same unit.  
The new number cannot duplicate a currently active detachment number within that 
unit. 
27.3.3.1.4.  The following redesignations cannot be made: 
27.3.3.1.4.1.  A detachment of one parent unit to a detachment of another parent 
unit. 
27.3.3.1.4.2.  A detachment to a unit. 
27.3.3.1.4.3.  A unit to a detachment. 
27.3.3.1.4.4.  A detachment to an operating location. 
27.3.3.1.4.5.  An operating location to a detachment. 
27.3.3.1.5.  The inactivation of a parent unit automatically inactivates its detachments. 
27.3.3.1.6.  Detachments are designated as part of a unit, not an establishment (e.g., 
Detachment 1, 1st Fighter Squadron, or Detachment 4, Headquarters 1st Operations 
Group). 
27.3.3.1.7.  If a gap in sequential numbering occurs because of actions such as 
inactivation of a detachment, it is not necessary to take actions to change the numbers 
of the other detachments in the unit to fill in the gap. 
27.3.3.2.  Operating Location. 
27.3.3.2.1.  An operating location may be activated by a Major Command, Field 
Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit. 
27.3.3.2.2.  An operating location is a geographically separated location where persons 
are required to perform permanent duty, and the command supervision or other features 
provided by a detachment are not needed. 
27.3.3.2.3.  An operating location is not a location separated from an installation to 
which persons are transported to work. 
27.3.3.2.4.  Detachment guidelines in paragraphs 27.3.3.1.3 to 27.3.3.1.7 also apply 
to operating location actions (with the understanding that operating locations are 
designated alphabetically instead of numerically). 
27.3.3.2.5.  Manpower authorizations for an operating location are reported with the 
location where duty is being performed. 
27.3.3.2.6.  Operating locations are designated in alphabetical sequence, beginning 
with A. 
27.3.3.3.  Coding Personnel Accounting Symbol Data 
132 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
27.3.3.3.1.  The personnel accounting symbol code contains data fields for designating 
detachments, operating locations, and staff elements.  The following coding rules 
apply: 
27.3.3.3.2.  Operating locations are designated with a maximum of three alphabetic 
characters in a four-character field.  The first character of the operating location field 
is zero.  The first two characters of the operating location field are always zero for 
operating locations designated with two letters.  The first three characters of the 
operating location field are always zero for operating location designations with a 
single letter (e.g., operating location code “000A” for operating location “A,” operating 
location code “00ZZ” for operating location “ZZ,” operating location code “0ABC” for 
operating location “ABC”). 
27.3.3.3.3.  If the operating location is not subordinate to the detachment, the 
detachment code is designated with zeroes (e.g., detachment code “0000” and operating 
location code “000A” means operating location “A” and parent is not a detachment). 
27.3.3.3.4.  If the operating location is subordinate to the detachment, both fields are 
designated independently (e.g., detachment code “0001” and operating location code 
“000A” equals operating location “A” of Detachment “1”). 
27.3.3.3.5.  Detachment and operating location data fields (four characters each) are 
combined in the personnel system. So, total nonzero characters cannot exceed four 
characters. 
27.3.3.3.5.1.  An operating location can be up to three characters if the detachment 
number designation is one digit (1–9). 
27.3.3.3.5.2.  An operating location can be one or two characters if the detachment 
number designation is two digits (10–99). 
27.3.3.3.5.3.  An operating location can be only one character if the detachment 
number designation is three digits (100–999). 
27.3.3.3.5.4.  An operating location cannot be assigned to a detachment numbered 
greater than “999.”  If it becomes necessary to establish an operating location, the 
detachment is redesignated using not more than three digits for identification. 
27.3.3.3.5.5.  The first character of an operating location or staff element data field 
is alphabetic if used for anything other than an operating location (e.g., when 
establishing a separate personnel accounting symbol for a senior rater). 
27.3.3.3.5.6.  General guidance on the personnel accounting symbol system is in 
Air Force Computer Systems Manual (AFCSM) 36-699, Volume 4, Personnel 
Accounting Symbol System Users Manual. 
27.3.3.4.  Squadron Sections.  A Commander of a large unit (235 or more military 
authorized), squadron or above, may delegate administrative control of all assigned 
members by appointing a section Commander on special orders per the guidance in AFI 
51-509.  If a full-time section Commander is not authorized under a manpower standard, 
unit commanders may appoint a section Commander who performs these functions as an 
additional duty.  Commanders exercise discretion to ensure this is done only when 
warranted by the span of control factors. (See AFI 51-509 for legal guidance on the 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
133 
appointment of section commanders and AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel 
(Officer and Enlisted) for guidance on Air Force specialty code and duty title matters.) 
27.3.3.5.  Air Force Elements. 
27.3.3.5.1.  An Air Force Element may be designated to function as a unit by a 
designating officer (described in paragraphs 27.3.3.5.1.1 through 27.3.3.5.1.3).  The 
designating officer attaches the Air Force members on duty with an organization 
outside the Air Force to the Air Force Element.  (Refer to AFI 51-509 for the 
determination of an Air Force Element Commander and the appointment of Air Force 
Element section Commanders.)  These officers have authority to designate an Air Force 
Element to function as a unit: 
27.3.3.5.1.1.  The senior Air Force officer in a defense Agency, defense field 
activity, Combatant Command, joint task force, combined task force, coalition 
forces, or activity outside the Air Force that exercises operational control over the 
Air Force Element. 
27.3.3.5.1.2.  The Commander of the Major Command for Regular Air Force 
members within that command detailed to a unit of the ANG not in federal service; 
detailed to an organization outside the Air Force for which the Secretary of the Air 
Force serves as the Executive Agent per DoDDs; or similar circumstances. 
27.3.3.5.1.3.  The Commander, Air Force District of Washington for Air Force 
Elements not within such commands, agencies, or activities. 
27.3.3.5.2.  In appropriate circumstances (such as a geographically dispersed Air Force 
Element), an Air Force Element may be divided into sections, and an Air Force Element 
section Commander appointed to each section.  In these cases, the Air Force Element 
Commander designates which members are attached to each section. 
27.4.  Office Symbol Codes. 
27.4.1.  Office symbol codes identify the organizational structure and functional 
responsibilities within a unit.  For instance, “HO” is the office symbol code for the History 
Office in the wing headquarters.  These specifically address office symbol codes as used in the 
Manpower Programming and Execution System (see Attachment 2) and related manpower 
documentation. 
27.4.2.  General Characteristics of Office Symbol Codes. 
27.4.2.1.  Major functions have two-letter symbols (e.g., the surgeon is “SG.” Since basic 
functions report to major functions, basic functions have three-letter [or more] symbols, 
e.g., dental is “SGD”).  A basic function’s office symbol starts with the same letters as the 
parent function’s office symbol and adds one more letter. 
27.4.2.2.  Each major function within the Air Force is assigned a two-letter office symbol; 
wing staff, group, and squadrons within the Operations group and Mission Support Group 
have two-letter office symbols.  Basic functions are assigned three-letter (or more) office 
symbols.  Some major functions include basic functions that are similar in title and function 
to another major function (e.g., the major function of Manpower, Personnel, and Services, 
“A1,” may have a basic function of Plans).  Since all office symbols within a function start 
134 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
with the same two characters, the Personnel Plans function uses the office symbol “A1X” 
rather than “XP” so the basic function is not confused with a major function. 
27.4.2.3.  The office symbol code “CC” may be used for organizational commanders 
instead of the functional office symbol code.  Major commands, field operating agencies 
and Direct Reporting Units should be consistent among their similar organizations in use 
of “CC” or the functional office symbol code in the Manpower Programming and 
Execution System. 
27.4.2.4.  As much as possible, office symbol codes use the same letters and titles at 
Headquarters Air Force, Major Command, and base level. 
27.4.2.5.  Two Types of Office Symbol Codes. 
27.4.2.5.1.  Air Force standard office symbol codes are available for use by more than 
one command.  These types of office symbol codes are established for standard 
organization structures such as those previously listed in Chapters 26 and 27 of this 
instruction or a functional instruction and to promote standardization and ease of 
communication.    These office symbol codes are identified by a command code of 
“AF” in the Manpower Programming and Execution System office symbol code 
reference table. 
27.4.2.5.2.  Command-unique office symbol codes are used by a single command, as 
identified in the Manpower Programming and Execution System office symbol code 
reference table. Command-unique office symbol codes cannot duplicate or conflict 
with standard office symbol codes. (T-1). Do not create a command-unique office 
symbol code if an Air Force standard office symbol code exists for an organization 
(e.g., if a Civil Engineer Squadron has an Operations Flight, it uses an office symbol 
code of “CEO” as reflected previously Chapter 26). (T-1). 
27.4.3.  Procedures for the Manpower Programming and Execution System Office Symbol 
Codes. 
27.4.3.1.  The Manpower Programming and Execution System office symbol codes are 
limited to seven alphanumeric characters.  Though special characters such as dashes or 
slashes may be acceptable when office symbol codes are used for communication or 
identification purposes, they cannot be included in office symbol codes as reflected in the 
Manpower Programming and Execution System because they create problems in some data 
systems that interface with the Manpower Programming and Execution System. 
27.4.3.2.  The Manpower Programming and Execution System office symbol code titles 
are limited to 40 characters for Air Force systems and a 100-character title for interface 
with Department of Defense systems.  To facilitate interface with the Department of 
Defense systems, the 100-character title are spelled out as much as possible, avoiding 
acronyms and other abbreviations. Special characters cannot be used in the Manpower 
Programming and Execution System office symbol code titles because they create 
problems in some data systems that interface with the Manpower Programming and 
Execution System. 
27.4.3.3.  The organizational level is not normally included in the office symbol code title 
(i.e., do not include words such as “division,” “directorate,” “squadron,” “flight,” 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
135 
“section,” etc., in the title).  This allows the same office symbol code to be used at different 
organizational levels. 
27.4.3.4.  Using organizations will request deletion of office symbol codes that are no 
longer required. (T-1).  The deletions cannot occur until no manpower authorizations 
remain using the office symbol code. 
27.4.3.5.  Use existing office symbol codes when possible. 
27.4.3.6.  Headquarters Air Force functional managers should maintain standard office 
symbol codes and structures down to the division or equivalent level (i.e., offices with 
three-digit office symbol codes) for Major Command and Numbered and Named Air Force 
headquarters to facilitate communications and minimize personnel transition time.  The 
Headquarters Air Force functional manager must approve all deviations to these 
established three-letter office symbols. (T-1).  (See paragraph 29.1.4) 
27.4.3.7.  Do not use proposed office symbol codes until approved. 
27.4.4.  A-Staff Office Symbol Codes.  A-staff office symbol codes are used to identify certain 
major staff elements in Headquarters Air Force, Major Command headquarters, and 
component Numbered and Named Air Force headquarters.  These office symbol codes are 
patterned on the J-staff structure used in joint organizations and are designed to improve 
communication within the Air Force and with other Department of Defense organizations.  
Base-level organizations do not use A-Staff office symbol codes. (T-1). Functions not covered 
by the standardized A-staff structure maintain their current office symbols (e.g., “FM,” “JA,” 
“SG,” “PA”).  Standard two-digit A-staff office symbol codes are shown in Figure 27.1  Major 
commands may request to link A-staff two-digit functions (e.g., A3 and A5 as A3/5) in their 
Major Command headquarters using the organization change request procedures in Chapter 
29.  Major commands are authorized to approve linking A-staff two-digit functions in their 
component Numbered Air Forces if they follow the guidance in Figure 26.2  Major commands 
may return to the standard A-staff structure in Figure 27.1 without using the organization 
change request procedures in Chapter 29, but they notify AF/A1M of the return to the standard 
structure. 
Figure 27.1.  Standard Two-Digit A-Staff Office Symbol Codes. 
 
27.4.5.  Requests for the Manpower Programming and Execution System Office Symbol Code 
Actions. 
136 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
27.4.5.1.  If an office symbol code change is needed because of an organization change 
request, requesters include the associated office symbol code actions in question five of the 
organization change request per the procedures in Chapter 29 of this instruction. 
27.4.5.2.  Major commands, field operating agencies, Direct Reporting Units, and 
SAF/AAR will send other office symbol code requests for the Manpower Programming 
and Execution System actions by e-mail to the AF/A1MO Workflow mailbox. (T-1).  
When possible, use a distinct e-mail subject that reflects the request and requester (e.g., 
subject: “OSC Request-ACC OS Add” or “OSC Request-Air Force Material Command 
“PK” Actions”).  Include the specific office symbol code, office symbol code titles, action 
(i.e., add, delete, or change), a short rationale for the request, and whether requesting a 
standard or command-unique office symbol code (identify command code, as appropriate).  
A spreadsheet request template is available from AF/A1MO, their Air Force Portal site or 
Microsoft SharePoint ™ site.  AF/A1MO obtains functional coordination within 
Headquarters Air Force, as required, and forwards approved requests to be loaded into the 
Manpower Programming and Execution System (See Attachment 2).  Send office symbol 
code requests for organizations outside the Air Force (e.g., Air Force Elements) to 
AF/A1MP instead of AF/A1MO.

Chapter 28 
PROCEDURES FOR NAMING AND NUMBERING UNITS 
28.1.  Nomenclature.  Standardize organization titles, when possible.  When activating a unit, 
designate it using the procedures in this instruction and guidance in AFPD 38-1. 
28.2.  General Guidelines.   Apply these guidelines when naming a unit: 
28.2.1.  Generally, units require a specific organization title or designation made up of a 
number or name, a "kind" (nomenclature) and a "type" (organizational level) indicator.  
Examples of Numbered and Named unit designations are in Figure 28.1 
Figure 28.1.  Unit Designation Examples. 
 
28.3.  Heritage.  Heritage is an important element in unit prestige, pride, and morale.  It, therefore, 
impacts readiness and operational effectiveness.  The Air Force regularly activates and inactivates 
units as a result of force structure and organizational changes.  Throughout this process, we take 
care to preserve those units with the richest heritage by keeping them in active status.  This may 
require transferring a unit designation from one location to another (follow procedures in AFI 10-
503). 
28.4.  Unit Number. 
28.4.1.  A numbered unit is assigned a number with no more than three numerals (e.g., 305th 
Air Mobility Wing). 
28.4.2.  The Air Force designates Numbered Air Forces in a single series beginning with 
"First."  Do not use Arabic or Roman numerals in designating Numbered Air Forces. 
Component Numbered Air Forces have a parenthetical designation indicating their component 
role consisting of "(Air Forces XXXXX)" where "XXXXX" is the functional or geographic 
designation of the associated Combatant Command [e.g., Seventh Air Force (Air Forces 
Korea)].  Numbered and Named Air Forces that are not component Numbered Air Forces 
cannot have a parenthetical designation (e.g., Second Air Force). 
28.4.3.  Use unit numbers as low in sequence as possible. 
28.4.4.  Reserve numbers 101 through 299 for ANG units. 
138 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
28.4.5.  Do not duplicate wing and independent group numerical designations.  In other words, 
there is only one 325th wing (presently a fighter wing) or one 720th group (presently a special 
tactics group).  Since these numbers are taken, no other 325th or 720th wing or group is 
authorized.  AF/A1M manages active wing designations. 
28.4.6.  Give dependent groups and support squadrons the same number as their parent 
organizations, when possible.  If you cannot give groups their parent organization's number 
(e.g., because of duplication) do not use a number already assigned to another wing.  Assign 
to these groups or squadrons a number that bears a logical relationship to the parent.  When 
feasible, number duplicate units “7XX” or “8XX” (where “XX” is the wing number).  For 
example, duplicate squadrons under the 96th Civil Engineer Group would be the 96th Civil 
Engineer Squadron and 796th Civil Engineer Squadron. 
28.4.7.  Do not normally give mission squadrons assigned to groups or wings the same number 
as their parent organizations.  When otherwise convenient, use sequential numbers for mission 
squadrons within the same wing.  Examples of mission squadrons include operational 
squadrons in a flying wing, training squadrons in a training wing, and electronics maintenance 
squadrons in a maintenance wing. 
28.4.8.  You do not normally redesignate a unit numerically.  For example, if the host wing at 
an installation changes, the support units are not redesignated from the old host wing number 
to the new host wing number.  Instead, the support units under the old host wing are inactivated, 
and support units with the new host wing number are activated.  This ensures that the previous 
host wing has similarly numbered support units available for activation if needed. 
28.4.9.  Normally number units subordinate to a Numbered Air Force “6XX” (where “XX” is 
the number).  Do not use “6XX” numbers for units not assigned to “XX NAF” (where “XX” 
is the Numbered Air Force number). 
28.4.10.  Priorities.  Use the following priorities to assign unit numerical designations for 
wings, independent groups, and operational squadrons. Give: 
28.4.10.1.  First priority to preserving units that trace their heritage to the original (pre-
1939) Air Force formations. 
28.4.10.2.  Second priority to units with records of unique historical achievements. 
28.4.10.3.  Third priority to units which have gained the most years of service, unit 
decorations, and specific accomplishments. 
28.4.10.4.  The Air Force Historical Research Agency maintains, updates, and distributes 
annual master heritage rankings based on these priorities. 
28.5.  Unit Kind. 
28.5.1.  Assign a unit a designation that describes its assigned mission.  Use the same 
nomenclature for organizations with the same responsibilities.  Do not construct unit titles that 
restrict another unit with a similar mission from using that nomenclature. 
28.5.2.  Do not designate composite wings or composite independent groups by "kind" 
designation (e.g., 3d Wing). 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
139 
28.5.3.  Keep unit "kinds" (nomenclature) and type attributes short and simple.  Use more 
specific nomenclature at lower organizational levels, but keep the number of different titles to 
a minimum. 
28.5.4.  Use current, approved nomenclature for units.  For available unit "kinds" 
(nomenclatures) see the organization kind code reference table in the Manpower Programming 
and Execution System.  Units must have approval from AF/A1M for any deviations to 
approved nomenclature. 
28.6.  Unit Type.  Use Chapter 25 of this instruction to determine appropriate unit types. 
28.7.  New Nomenclature. 
28.7.1.  If an unusual factor such as a special mission suggests a deviation from the standard 
organization nomenclature, a Major Command may request new nomenclature from AF/A1M.  
Include in these requests the proposed nomenclature (unit kind), type (level), and command to 
which restricted (if any) and a short definition of the mission implied by the nomenclature.  
Also, include the justification or rationale for the proposed nomenclature.  Include this 
information in Question 5a of an organization change request per the procedures in paragraph 
29.2.2 of this instruction.  For example: 
Proposed Unit Kind: Fighter Training 
Proposed Unit Type: Squadron 
Restriction: None 
Definition: Provides flying training in fighter type aircraft. 
Justification: Provide rationale for new nomenclature 
28.8.  Procedures for Unit Designation.  
28.8.1.  Units are regularly activated, inactivated, or redesignated because of force structure 
and organizational changes.  Designation actions will conform to policy criteria in AFPD 38-
1 and procedural criteria documented in this instruction. (T-1). 
28.8.2.  Do not designate or redesignate a unit with the exact number, name, and type of 
another active or inactive unit. 
28.8.3.  When a new unit is needed, you may re-activate an inactive unit of the same number 
or name and similar function.  It may be redesignated before activation to reflect current 
nomenclature when needed.  The unit that is activated again keeps its lineage, honors, history, 
and emblem.  When proposing a unit activation, Major Commands should contact the Air 
Force Historical Research Agency as early in the process as possible for identification of 
appropriate inactive units that are available.  “Similar function” for inactive flying units means 
re-activation as a unit whose members operate aircraft, spacecraft or other flying equipment 
operating in the air or space environments.  Other types of mission units and support units do 
not use the heritage of former flying units. 
28.8.4.  A unit keeps its lineage, honors, and history through all activations, inactivations, and 
redesignations.  AFI 84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry, describes the 
effect an organizational action has on inheriting the lineage, honors, and history of a unit.  On 
request, the Air Force Historical Research Agency provides Major Commands with a list of 
qualified inactive units for possible activation. 
140 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
28.8.5.  Major commands, field operating agencies and Direct Reporting Units will use 
approved nomenclature and heritage lists to propose unit designations. (T-1).  Submit these 
proposals to AF/A1M for evaluation and certification of compliance with guidance in AFPD 
38-1 and this instruction per procedures in Chapter 29.  If Major Commands wish to deviate 
from the guidance, they provide explicit justification in a request for approval of an 
organizational variance.  AF/A1M sends proposals to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force for 
approval. 
28.8.6.  Requests to memorialize a named unit or named activity are to follow the guidelines 
in  AFMAN 36-2806, Awards and Memorialization Program.  Major commands submit these 
requests per the procedures in Chapter 29 and include a biography of the individual, 
explanation of why the Major Command wishes to memorialize the organization for this 
individual, and certification that appropriate quality force reviews or background checks have 
been conducted.

Chapter 29 
ORGANIZATION CHANGES 
29.1.  Actions Requiring AF/A1M Approval.  Major commands, field operating agencies, Direct 
Reporting Units, and their subordinate units (through their servicing manpower activity) must have 
AF/A1M approval to: 
29.1.1.  Activate, inactivate, or redesignate a unit or to vary from any policy, guidance, 
procedure, or standard organization depicted in this instruction or AFPD 38-1. (T-1). A 
variation includes any addition, deletion, or merger of functions shown in a standard 
organization. AF/A1M staffs these requests to appropriate approval authorities within 
Headquarters Air Force as shown in Table 29.1 
29.1.2.  Change major staff elements (i.e., directorate or equivalent level [i.e., offices with two-
digit office symbols]) in a Major Command headquarters. 
29.1.3.  Headquarters Air Force functional managers must also approve changes to Major 
Command headquarters at the division or equivalent level (i.e., offices with three-digit office 
symbols).   Major commands submit these requests to either:  (1) the appropriate Headquarters 
Air Force functional manager with an information copy to AF/A1MO or (2) to AF/A1M using 
the procedures in this chapter.

29.2.  Organization Change Request. 
29.2.1.  A request for an action such as unit activation, inactivation, redesignation, or variation 
to a standard structure must include answers to the Organization Change Request Questions, 
as they apply. (T-1.)  Answer “not applicable” when appropriate.  AF/A1M reviews 
organization change requests and, on approval, directs Major Commands, field operating 
agencies, Direct Reporting Units, or SAF/AAR to reflect the action in a DAF/A1M letter 
request sheet per paragraph 30.1.2.2  Also, AFI 84-105 requires Major Commands, field 
operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units to submit to the Air Force Historical Research 
Agency a monthly report of any changes in organizations using RCS: HAF-HO(M)7401.  
Implementation of actions is subject to applicable provisions in AFI 10-503. 
29.2.2.  Organization Change Request Questions.  Major commands should edit submissions 
from their base-level organizations before forwarding requests to Headquarters Air Force to 
ensure questions are answered, and that information extraneous to Headquarters Air Force 
review is deleted. 
29.2.2.1.  Question 1.  What is the proposed action (list specific actions, such as activation, 
inactivation, nomenclature change, reorganization, or variation request)? 
29.2.2.2.  Question 2.  Why is the action needed?  What are the expected benefits? (Identity 
factors driving the need for the action [e.g., changes to instructions, missions, or concepts 
of operations]); attach any substantiating Air Force directives. In describing expected 
benefits, identify improvements, examples of increased mission capability and so on. 
Generalized statements such as increases mission capability or reduces the span of control 
are not adequate as justifications.) 
29.2.2.3.  Question 3.  What is the structure of the new organization?  (Include current and 
proposed organization and function charts showing authorized and proposed manpower by 
officer, enlisted and civilian.  Also include the ADSL, where applicable.  Contractor 
numbers are not required in an OCR unless they are necessary to explain the particular 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
143 
situation; if showing contractor numbers, show them as a separate item not added into 
organization chart totals nor the Officer/Enlisted/Civilian/Total numbers.  Explain 
manpower changes.  To assist in the identification of potential Congressional or community 
concerns, identify the number of manpower authorization changes for each affected 
installation, using a table if needed.) 
29.2.2.4.  Question 4.  Explain how the proposed structure compares with standard 
structures in Chapter 26, nomenclature guidance, and size guidance, and provide rationale 
for any requested deviations. Explain any requested variances, citing affected portions of 
this AFI, and explaining why the organization wishes to vary from the guidance.  Using 
the guidance in Chapter 25, include computation of adjusted populations for wings, 
groups, or squadrons with manpower authorizations under the unit size thresholds.  If there 
are no variances involved, answer “Not applicable.” 
29.2.2.5.  Question 5.   Because of this request, are any changes needed to add or delete 
organization nomenclature codes or office symbol codes or to change the title for an office 
symbol code?  If so, provide the following information.  Strive to use existing codes rather 
than creating new ones.  Avoid special characters because of data system interface 
problems. (When submitting a request to Headquarters Air Force for approval, only include 
code requests that require Headquarters Air Force action; do not include code actions that 
are handled at the command or base level.)  (See Chapter 27 for more information on 
office symbol codes.) 
29.2.2.5.1.  Question 5a. Organization Nomenclature Code Change. 
Action:  [Add or Delete; titles cannot be changed] 
Title: 
Requested 3-character code: 
Requested 18-character code:  
Requested 38-character code:  
Requested 100-character code:  [to facilitate interface with systems outside of the Air Force, 
spell out full nomenclature to the maximum extent possible, avoiding acronyms and other 
abbreviations] 
Description:  [Provide a short one to two sentence description of the mission for this type of unit.  
Make descriptions mission-focused and generic enough to allow other similar units to use this 
nomenclature.] 
29.2.2.5.2.  Question 5b. Office Symbol Code Change. 
Action:  [Add, Delete, Change Title] 
Requested code:  [Can be no more than 7 alphanumeric characters] 
Requested 40-character title:  
Requested 100-character title:  [to facilitate interface with systems outside of the Air Force, spell 
out full nomenclature to the maximum extent possible, avoiding acronyms and other 
abbreviations] 
29.2.2.6.  Question 6.  For unit activations or redesignations, explain why the proposed unit 
designation was chosen.  Identify any inactive historical units you are proposing to use and 
explain why you want to use these units.  If the proposed approach varies from guidance 
144 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
regarding unit heritage or nomenclature, provide specific rationale for the requested 
deviation.  Coordinate proposals with the appropriate history office. 
29.2.2.7.  Question 7.  What is the cost of the request regarding dollars and resources?  
(Document cost regarding dollars and manpower.  Include administrative costs such as 
flags and signs, as well as manpower increases, or other monetary costs the requested 
reorganization action directly drives.  Do not include costs that may be from related force 
structure actions, e.g., runway construction costs for bedding down programmed aircraft 
may not be included in the organization change request to activate an associated flying 
squadron.  If there are any changes in controlled grades (e.g., colonel, chief master 
sergeant), explain those.   If the action cannot be implemented from within currently 
programmed Major Command, Field Operating Agency or Direct Reporting Unit resources 
see paragraph 29.2.2.7.1) 
29.2.2.7.1.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units 
normally implement actions approved under the organization change request process 
using currently programmed manpower and budgetary resources.  In the rare cases 
when this is not possible, they submit an initiative for the resources needed for the Air 
Force Corporate Structure during a budget exercise, following guidance in AFPD 90-
6, Air Force Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (SPPBE) 
Process, and any related instructions.  They do this before or concurrent with the 
organization change request submission.  AF/A1M holds the organization change 
request without action until the resources are approved.  AF/A1M returns the 
organization change request without action if the resource approval does not occur 
within 30 calendar days of receipt of the organization change request.  For 
reconsideration, the Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting 
Unit resubmits the organization change request following approval of the resources. 
29.2.2.8.  Question 8.  Provide a mission directive, statement, or description for 
organizations proposed for activation, inactivation, redesignation, or reorganization. 
29.2.3.  Major command, Field Operating Agency, and Direct Reporting Unit A1Ms and 
SAF/AARM (for serviced organizations) submit organization change requests requiring 
AF/A1M action using a request memorandum from the A1M or SAF/AARM to AF/A1MO.  
These submissions reflect their commands’ position and are to have been staffed with 
appropriate offices internal to the command (including affected command functional points of 
contact) before submission to Headquarters Air Force.  AF/A1MO coordinates the 
organization change requests with appropriate Headquarters Air Force offices and staffs the 
organization change request to the approval authorities reflected in Table 29.1 for a decision 
on approval or disapproval. 
29.2.3.1.  If approval authority is the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of 
the Air Force or Secretary of the Air Force, the submitting Major Command, Field 
Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit includes documentation reflecting approval to 
release the organization change request by their Commander, director, deputy Commander 
or equivalent.  A copy of the command staff summary sheet for the action is the preferred 
documentation and is included as an attachment to the organization change request 
submission memorandum. 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
145 
29.2.3.2.  Organization change requests for  ANG units include coordination by the gaining 
commands for the affected units.  NGB/A1M obtains the coordination from the gaining 
command A1Ms who staff the requests within their command, including appropriate 
functional coordination.  The gaining command A1Ms obtain coordination from their 
Commander or deputy Commander if the approval authority for the action per Table 29.1 
is the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force or Secretary of 
the Air Force. The Major Command Commander or deputy Commander may delegate the 
coordination of these organization change requests to the command A1M; the command 
A1M provides a copy of the delegation to AF/A1MO and NGB/A1M and updates the 
delegation at least every five years.  (See AFPD 10-3, Operational Utilization of the Air 
Reserve Component Forces; and AFI 10-301, Managing Operational Utilization 
Requirements of the Air Force Reserve Component Forces, for further discussion of 
gaining commands.) 
29.2.4.  Major commands, field operating agencies, Direct Reporting Units, and SAF/AARM 
are encouraged to use supplements to this instruction or similar documents to guide their 
organizations on organization change requests that do not require Headquarters Air Force 
approval, as well as command-unique organization structures, terms, and processes. 
29.2.5.  A request for organization action is not required in the following instances: 
29.2.5.1.  For units inactivating because of an approved force structure action.  Actions 
subject to legislative action or related studies are not considered approved until satisfactory 
completion of the legislative requirements.  If actions are not per heritage priority guidance 
in AFPD 38-1 and this instruction, an organization change request is required. 
29.2.5.2.  When specific unit actions are directed in a Program Action Directive, Program 
Guidance Letter, Program Change Request, or similar directive issued by Headquarters Air 
Force. 
29.2.6.  A Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit, after notifying 
AF/A1M, may return a changed organization to a prescribed configuration. 
29.2.7.  Further requirements may need to be met for the establishment of a new Field 
Operating Agency, Direct Reporting Unit, Major Command Field Operating Agency, or Major 
Command Direct Reporting Unit.  The annual Defense Appropriations Act usually contains a 
provision prohibiting the expenditure of funds for the establishment of such organizations.  The 
provision permits the Secretary of the Air Force to grant a waiver if the Secretary of the Air 
Force certifies to Congress that the establishment results in personnel or financial savings to 
the Department of the Air Force.  Existing field operating agencies, Direct Reporting Units, 
Major Command field operating agencies, and Major Command Direct Reporting Units are 
not redesignated or re-missioned to an unrelated mission area to circumvent this legal direction.  
Contact AF/A1MO for the current guidance when considering the establishment of one of these 
organizations. 
29.2.8.  Units will not take actions such as scheduling ceremonies, inviting dignitaries, or 
making public announcements before appropriate Headquarters Air Force approval of 
organization changes. (T-2). 
29.2.9.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units ensure all 
notification requirements are followed for organization actions. (T-0).  Consult current 
146 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
guidance including Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Instruction 2300.02J, Coordination of 
Overseas Force Structure Changes and Host-Nation Notification; AFI 10-503; AFI 10-504, 
Overseas Force Structure Changes and Host Nation Notification; AFI 16-601,  
Implementation of, and Compliance with, International Arms Control and Nonproliferation 
Agreements; and current Congressional notification and public announcement requirements 
(as applicable).  Consider these requirements when planning implementation timing.  For 
instance, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty requires the United States make 
notifications on affected organization changes 42 calendar days in advance of the 
implementation date and more time needs to be allowed for processing the notification through 
the United States European Command, the Joint Staff, and the State Department after 
organization change request approval.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct 
Reporting Units work Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty notifications with 
Headquarters Air Force per guidance in AFI 16-601. 
29.2.10.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units will also use 
the organization change request procedures for reassignment of units or named activities to 
another Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit. (T-1).  The losing 
command normally prepares the organization change request.  If agreed to by both parties, the 
gaining command may prepare the organization change request or the commands may submit 
a joint organization change request.  In all cases, the submitting command will coordinate the 
organization change request with the other command before submission and include this 
coordination with their organization change request submittal to AF/A1M. (T-1). 
29.3.  Testing New Organizations.  
29.3.1.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units may develop 
and test new organizations.  An organization test evaluates the new organization's effectiveness 
under actual working conditions and resolves most common problems before committing 
affected functions to change.  A test involving an organization structure found in this 
instruction must have AF/A1M approval. (T-1).  Submit test plans for approval at least 120 
calendar days before the proposed start of the test.  The Major Command, Field Operating 
Agency, Direct Reporting Unit or SAF/AAR will submit a test plan including: 
29.3.1.1.  Answers to the questions in paragraph 29.2.1, as they apply. (T-1). 
29.3.1.2.  Dates of the test period (not to exceed 1 year). (T-1). 
29.3.1.3.  Objective measures to assist in the evaluation of the test. (T-1). 
29.3.2.  After completing the test period, the Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or 
Direct Reporting Unit sends results and recommendations to AF/A1M.  They must include a 
waiver request if a permanent organization change is desired. (T-1). 
 
 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
147 
Chapter 30 
ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTATION 
30.1.  Implementation Authority. 
30.1.1.  Headquarters Air Force, MAJCOM/A1Ms, Field Operating Agency, and Direct 
Reporting Unit manpower staff functions are responsible for publishing the legal and 
authoritative documents needed to implement organization actions. 
30.1.2.  DAF/A1M Letters.  DAF/A1M letters constitute, reconstitute, disband, consolidate, 
activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign, and reassign (between Major Commands, field 
operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units) Air Force units.  Also, DAF/A1M letters 
designate, redesignate, inactivate, assign, and reassign (between Major Commands, field 
operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units) named activities.  DAF/A1M letters serve as 
authority for Major Command, Field Operating Agency, and Direct Reporting Unit named 
activity and unit organization actions.  DAF/A1M letters will follow the formats outlined in 
Attachment 4. (T-1). 
30.1.2.1.  Effective Date.  The effective date of an organizational action is published either 
in the DAF/A1M letter or the order issued by a Major Command, Field Operating Agency, 
Direct Reporting Unit or SAF/AARM.  When a DAF/A1M letter allows the effective date 
to be on or about a certain date, the organization action must occur no more than 30 
calendar days before or after that date. (T-1). 
30.1.2.1.1.  Major commands, field operating agencies, Direct Reporting Units, and 
SAF/AARM will notify AF/A1MO of their desired effective dates by providing a 
DAF/A1M letter request sheet (see paragraph 30.1.2.2). (T-1).  Project the desired 
effective dates at least two months in advance but no less than one day in advance and 
no more than one year in advance.  When MAJCOMs have a unit that is being 
inactivated and replaced with the activation of another unit, both actions (activation 
and inactivation) take place on the same day.  Strive to provide maximum lead time. 
30.1.2.1.2.  An on-or-about date in a DAF/A1M letter is at least 30 calendar days from 
the date of the letter.  This provides the maximum flexibility for commands submitting 
their desired effective dates with less than one month notice while preventing the final 
effective dates from being earlier than the date the DAF/A1M letter is issued. 
30.1.2.1.3.  If a Major Command, Field Operating Agency, Direct Reporting Unit, or 
SAF/AARM needs to change an effective date outside the dates allowed by a 
DAF/A1M letter on or about date, it will submit the new desired date and reason for 
the change in an amendment to its DAF/A1M letter request sheet. (T-1).  They must 
submit the amendment before the last possible effective date provided for by the 
original DAF/A1M letter. (T-1). 
30.1.2.1.4.  If a DAF/A1M letter allows an effective date to be on or about a certain 
date and the Major Command, Field Operating Agency, Direct Reporting Unit or 
SAF/AARM fails to issue a special order providing the final date within the on or about 
period, then the on or about date in the DAF/A1M letter becomes the final effective 
date. 
148 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
30.1.2.1.5.  DAF/A1M letters activating, inactivating, redesignating, or changing the 
status of Major Commands, field operating agencies and Direct Reporting Units 
provide a specific effective date and do not have on or about dates.  This is because 
these types of organizations are directly subordinate to Headquarters Air Force, which 
is the issuing authority for DAF/A1M letters. 
30.1.2.2.  DAF/A1M Letter Request Sheets.  These spreadsheets provide the information 
needed for AF/A1MO to prepare a DAF/A1M letter for approved actions as described in 
this AFI.  Specific information includes official unit designations, requested 
implementation dates, and identification of the HQ USAF approval reference for the action.  
MAJCOM, FOA or Direct Reporting Unit manpower and organization functions and 
SAF/AARM prepare the request sheets and submit them to AF/A1MO any time following 
HQ USAF approval of the action.  The current request sheet templates are available on the 
AF/A1MO AF Portal site or may be obtained from AF/A1MO or the AF/A1M SharePoint 
™ site (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-DP-00-53). 
30.1.3.  G-Series Orders.  Major commands, field operating agencies, Direct Reporting Units 
and SAF/AAR will publish these orders to activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign, and re-
assign units, detachments and named activities; and to attach one organization to another. (T-
1).  Major Command, Field Operating Agency, and Direct Reporting Unit manpower staff will 
authenticate and publish G-series orders using the guidelines below and the formats in Figures 
A4.6 through A4.12 in Attachment 4. (T-1).  SAF/AAR may perform these functions for their 
supported organizations.  ANG units also follow any additional guidance provided by the 
National Guard Bureau.  (Note: Consult AFI 10-503 regarding unit moves; they are not 
covered by this AFI.) 
30.1.3.1.  Guidelines for G-Series Orders. 
30.1.3.1.1.  Numbering G-Series Orders.  Number G-series orders in sequence starting 
with number one (e.g., GS-1, GS-2).  Begin a new sequence with the first order issued 
each fiscal year.  For the first order of a year, cite the number of the last order published 
the previous year above the heading of the first order of a year.  If no orders were 
published during the preceding year(s), state that “no orders were published in this 
series in (year(s)).” 
30.1.3.1.2.  Effective Date.  Specify the effective date of the action in the order.  The 
effective date is the date of the order if a different effective date is not specified. 
30.1.3.1.3.  Date orders to reflect the issuance date.  Do not postdate or antedate orders. 
30.1.3.1.4.  Distribution. Send all organizations affected by the order a copy.  Use 
standard distribution lists when possible.  Orders involving medical units include the 
Air Force Medical Support Agency on distribution.  Major commands, Field Operating 
Agency, Direct Reporting Units and SAF /AAR send copies of all orders to the Air 
Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) address AFHRA/RSO, 600 Chennault 
Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424, or e-mail: afhra.rs@us.af.mil.  AF/A1MO 
sends copies of all DAF/A1M letters to AFHRA/RSO. 
30.1.3.2.  G-Series Order Organization Actions. 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
149 
30.1.3.2.1.  Activation and Assignment.  Include the title of organization, station, unit, 
or establishment of assignment, effective date, and authority (Figures A4.6 and A4.9). 
30.1.3.2.2.  Redesignation. Include the old and new unit or detachment designation; the 
station, unit, and the establishment of assignment, as applicable; the effective date; and 
the authority (Figures A4.7 and A4.9).  (See paragraph 27.3.3.1.4 for more guidance 
regarding redesignation of detachments.) 
30.1.3.2.3.  Inactivation.  Include the designation of the organization being inactivated, 
the station, the effective date, the disposition of personnel and equipment, statement 
that funds are to be disposed of per Air Force directives and the authority (Figures 
A4.8 and A4.9). 
30.1.3.2.4.  Reassignment.  Include the designation of the establishment from which 
the unit is relieved, the establishment to which the unit is assigned, the effective date 
of transfer and the authority (Figures A4.9 through A4.11). 
30.1.3.2.5.  Attachment of One Unit to Another.  Include the unit and Major Command 
to which attached, the effective date of attachment, the purpose of attachment, and the 
authority. (See sample orders in Attachment 4.) 
30.1.3.2.6.  Detachments and Operating Locations (Figure A4.12).  Designate 
detachments and operating locations as parts of a unit, not as part of an establishment 
(e.g., Detachment 1, 1st Fighter Squadron, or Operating Location A, Headquarters 1st 
Operations Group).  The rationale for this is that detachments and operating locations 
are parts of a unit, not separate units.  Special orders are not required for operating 
location actions because there is no associated Uniform Code of Military Justice 
authority; however, Major Commands may publish orders for announcement or 
accountability purposes. 
30.1.3.3.  Changes to G-Series Orders.  Orders issuing authorities make changes by issuing 
amendments, revocations, or corrected copies. 
30.1.3.3.1.  Publish amendments and revocations in the same series as the original 
order. 
30.1.3.3.2.  Only the organization that published the original order may make a change 
to it. 
30.1.3.3.3.  Amendments.  Publish an amendment to add, delete, change or correct 
items in the body of the order. 
30.1.3.3.4.  Revocations.  Revocations cancel an action.  Revoke an order before it goes 
into effect.  A new order may announce the revocation if an organization revokes an 
order and immediately replaces it with another.  Add the statement: "This order revokes 
(order number and date)" at the beginning of the order.  Do not revoke a revocation; 
publish a new order. 
30.1.3.3.5.  Corrected Copies.  Publish a corrected copy of an order only to correct an 
error in the heading, close or approving official’s part of the original order.  Enter 
"Corrected Copy-Destroy All Others" and the incorrect number and date at the top of 
the corrected copy. Use the same heading and close as on the original order, correcting 
150 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
only those portions that need it. Double underscore the corrected portion when possible; 
and make sure the distribution matches the original order. 
30.2.  Distribution Requirements. 
30.2.1.  Each MAJCOM/A1M ensures AF/A1MO is on distribution to receive special orders, 
Major Command organization charts, mission directives, and instructions relating to 
organizations within their command. 
30.3.  Headquarters Air Force Organization Chart. 
30.3.1.  This publication prescribes Air Force Visual Aid (AFVA) 38-104, HQ USAF 
Organization Chart. AFVA 38-104 shows Headquarters Air Force offices under the Secretariat 
and the Air Staff down to the three-letter level, along with their respective field operating 
agencies. SAF/AAR prepares this Air Force visual aid semiannually or as needed.

Chapter 31 
ORGANIZING PROVISIONAL UNITS 
31.1.  Provisional Unit.  
31.1.1.  A provisional unit is temporary in nature and created when a specific organization is 
required for a temporary mission, and no organization exists to attach forces (including 
personnel).  All personnel are attached to the provisional unit and remain assigned to their 
permanent unit. 
31.1.2.  References to assigned and attached units in this chapter refer to the organizational 
structure of the provisional organization that establishes the Air Force chain of command. 
Assigned and attached units are not synonymous assigned and attached forces. 
31.1.3.  Provisional units are organized in the same manner as permanent units.  Establish 
provisional organizations at the organization level required to meet mission requirements (i.e., 
Numbered Air Force, wing, group, squadron, flight, detachment, and operating location).  
Organize provisional Operations, Maintenance, Mission Support, Medical Groups, and 
subordinate squadrons under a provisional wing, as needed.  Related functions may be 
consolidated into a single unit if more efficient because of size, oversight, or other factors (e.g., 
all maintenance functions can be combined into a Maintenance Squadron when the size of the 
functions do not warrant separate Maintenance and Aircraft Maintenance Squadrons).  If only 
a portion of a squadron is required, those functions may be added to an existing provisional 
squadron or the next higher provisional unit.  For example, if an entire expeditionary Force 
Support Squadron is not required, manpower, personnel, and services functions could be 
assigned into an Expeditionary Mission Support Group. 
31.1.4.  A provisional unit is attached rather than assigned to a permanent unit.  Conversely, a 
permanent unit cannot be assigned to a provisional unit, but it may be attached to a provisional 
unit.  A subordinate provisional unit is assigned to a higher provisional unit. 
31.2.  Two Types of Provisional Units. 
31.2.1.  Traditional.  When a need exists for a temporary organization not associated with a 
contingency type situation.  An organization change request to Headquarters Air Force or 
DAF/A1M letter is not required for this type of provisional unit.  For example: 
31.2.1.1.  When two or more organizations merge, and the need exists to create a temporary 
organization pending final disposition of resources from the merging organizations. 
31.2.1.2.  When an organization is needed for a short-term requirement such as a temporary 
headquarters until a location is selected for the permanent headquarters.  Do not establish 
a provisional unit to presuppose approval of a permanent basing decision. (T-1). 
31.2.2.  Expeditionary.  Provisional organizations established in support of a contingency or 
exercise operation.  There are two types of expeditionary units (major force provider and 
rainbow). 
31.2.2.1.  Major Force Provider.  An expeditionary unit that draws the preponderance of 
its forces or command element from a single active unit.  This wartime or contingency 
organization uses the unit designation of the unit providing the preponderance of forces 
152 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
(major force provider) or the command element.  (Discussed further in paragraph 
31.7.3.1) 
31.2.2.2.  Rainbow.  An expeditionary unit formed from multiple force providers.  This 
wartime or contingency organization does not have an identifiable major force provider.  
These organizations are inactive historical units converted to provisional status and 
assigned to, and activated by Major Commands as expeditionary organizations.  (Discussed 
further in paragraph 31.7.3.2) 
31.2.2.3.  MAJCOM/A1Ms establish procedures for requesting the establishment of 
expeditionary units assigned or attached to subordinate Air Expeditionary Task Forces. 
31.2.3.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units forward copies 
of G-series orders to AF/A1MO, the Air Force Historical Research Agency (address 
AFHRA/RSO, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424, or e-mail: 
afhra.rs@us.af.mil), all units mentioned in the order, and other offices and units as needed. 
(Discussed further in paragraph 31.11) 
31.3.  Personnel Accounting Symbol Codes.  Provisional units have the same command 
relationship characteristics and personnel accounting symbol code requirements as permanent 
units.  Major commands request provisional personnel accounting symbol codes per current 
instructions.  Personnel accounting symbol codes are assigned and registered in the personnel 
accounting symbol system.  The personnel accounting symbol code for provisional units is 
represented by an "H" in the fifth digit of the eight-digit personnel accounting symbol instead of 
an "F" (i.e., "EP2CHR9C" vs. "EP2CFR9C").  The letter "H" serves two primary purposes: (1) 
provides a distinction between provisional units and regular units; and (2) keeps the provisional 
personnel accounting symbol code compatible with the joint reporting systems. 
31.4.  History. 
31.4.1.  Traditional provisional organizations as described in 31.2.1 are temporary and once 
inactivated, their lineage ceases and cannot be revived.  Any provisional unit of this type using 
the same nomenclature as a previous provisional or permanent unit cannot claim the lineage, 
history, or honors of that unit. 
31.4.2.  Major force provider expeditionary organizations as described in paragraph 31.2.2.1 
are temporary and once inactivated, their lineage ceases and cannot be revived; however, any 
honors earned by this type of expeditionary provisional organization are conferred on its single 
major force provider of the same organizational level (e.g., squadron to squadron; group to 
group) per AFI 84-105.  For this purpose, wings are considered on the same organizational 
level as groups and squadrons on the same organizational level as Numbered Flights. 
31.4.3.  Rainbow expeditionary organizations temporarily converted from permanent to 
provisional organizations as described in 31.2.2.2 keep all lineage, history, and honors of the 
permanent unit and, when returned to permanent status, keep all lineage, history, and honors 
earned while in provisional status.  Honors earned by a rainbow unit are kept by the rainbow 
unit and are not shared with units that provided personnel for the expeditionary organization. 
31.4.4.  For specifics on lineage, honors, and heraldry refer to AFI 84-105. 
31.5.  Designations.  Major commands title provisional units to reflect their functional mission.  
As much as possible, use existing nomenclature.  Traditional provisional units include the term 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
153 
provisional in the unit designation to indicate the unit is provisional, e.g., Headquarters 849th 
Mission Support Group (Provisional) or HQ 849 MSG (P). Major commands submit an 
organization change request to AF/A1M per Chapter 29 of this instruction for approval to create 
new unit nomenclatures (organization kind). 
31.5.1.  For traditional provisional units, Major Commands select a unit designation that 
cannot be confused with another unit and does not have the same designation as an active unit. 
31.5.2.  Designate expeditionary units as directed in paragraph 31.7 and Figure 31.1 
31.6.  Air Expeditionary Task Force.  An Air Expeditionary Task Force may be established as 
an Air Force service component to a joint task force, or as a subordinate task force within a larger 
Air Force service component to address specific internal tasks.  If an Air Expeditionary Task Force 
is formed as the former, the Air Expeditionary Task Force Commander is also a Commander, Air 
Force Forces (“AFFOR”).  Otherwise, the Air Expeditionary Task Force Commander is not a 
Commander, Air Force Forces, but reports to a Commander, Air Force Forces.  An Air 
Expeditionary Task Force has a Commander, a staff, appropriate Command and Control 
mechanisms, and tailored and fully supported forces to meet specific mission requirements.  The 
Air Expeditionary Task Force is organized into a Numbered Expeditionary Air Force, Air 
Expeditionary Wings, Air Expeditionary Groups, Air Expeditionary Squadrons, or other 
organizations, as necessary to provide reasonable spans of control.  When directly supporting a 
Combatant Command, the Air Expeditionary Task Force is attached to the Air Force component.  
When an Air Expeditionary Task Force is established to support a joint task force subordinate to 
a Combatant Command, the Air Expeditionary Task Force may be attached for administrative 
control directly to the Air Force component to the Combatant Command, or it may be assigned to 
an Air Expeditionary Task Force established at the Combatant Command level. 
31.6.1.  An Air Expeditionary Task Force is named based on the unit providing the senior 
command headquarters, its size (Numbered Expeditionary Air Force, Air Expeditionary Wing, 
Air Expeditionary Group), and the operation name. 
31.6.1.1.  For a numbered expeditionary Air Force level Air Expeditionary Task Force, use 
the numerical designation of the engaged Numbered and Named Air Force, followed by 
the expeditionary Air Force, then the name of the operation.  For example, a Numbered 
Expeditionary Air Force–sized Air Expeditionary Task Force established under 12 AF 
(AFSOUTH) may be designated as “12 EAF-[OPERATION NAME]”. 
31.6.1.2.  In rare circumstances, a provisional command headquarters may be needed 
between a Numbered Expeditionary Air Force and its assigned and attached forces.  These 
headquarters are designated as a Numbered Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) 
followed by an operation or location identifier, e.g., 9th AETF-Iraq (9 AETF-I).  The 9 
AETF-I would be assigned to the 9th Expeditionary Air Force (9 EAF). 
31.6.1.3.  For wing- or group-sized Air Expeditionary Task Forces, use the numerical 
designation of the engaged wing or group, followed by Air Expeditionary Wing or Air 
Expeditionary Group, then the name of the operation.  For example, a wing or group-sized 
Air Expeditionary Task Force established under 12 AF (AFSOUTH) would be designated 
the 345 AEW-OPERATION NAME or the 345 AEG-OPERATION NAME. 
154 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
31.6.1.4.  While not normally established, a squadron-sized Air Expeditionary Task Force 
would use the designation of the engaged expeditionary squadron followed by the 
operation name. 
31.6.2.  Refer to appropriate Air Force and Joint doctrine for more guidance on organization 
and command relationships. 
31.7.  Air and Space Expeditionary Force Organization. 
31.7.1.  Expeditionary units are established to operate with an Air Expeditionary Task Force. 
In the following paragraphs, the term “supported command” refers to the Major Command the 
Air Force Component command is administratively assigned to and which is receiving support 
(i.e., forces) from other Major Commands.  “Supporting command” refers to the Air Force 
Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit providing forces to the 
supported command. 
31.7.2.  Permanent units supporting or participating in an Air Expeditionary Task Force from 
their permanent locations are not redesignated as expeditionary units nor are major force 
provider expeditionary units established at the same location as the corresponding permanent 
unit. In-place permanent units supporting or participating in an Air Expeditionary Task Force 
can be attached to the expeditionary unit they are supporting. 
31.7.3.  Expeditionary units are numbered. (See Figure 31.1 for detailed guidelines on air and 
space expeditionary force unit naming and numbering.) 
31.7.3.1.  Except for support units, the numerical designation for expeditionary units that 
have a major force provider reflects the designation of the unit that provides the 
preponderance of forces or the command element to the expeditionary organization.  For 
example, if the 4th Fighter Wing were the major force provider of an air expeditionary 
wing, then the nomenclature would be 4th Expeditionary Fighter Wing.  If there were a 
mix of forces (e.g., fighter, mobility), then the nomenclature would be the 4th Air 
Expeditionary Wing.  The organizational level of the expeditionary unit is the same as the 
unit providing the preponderance of forces, except for the situations in paragraphs 
31.7.3.1.1 and 31.7.3.1.2 
31.7.3.1.1.  If size and scope of an operation do not warrant the establishment of a wing, 
a group nomenclature may be used.  For example, if the 4th Fighter Wing is the major 
force provider of an air expeditionary activity that does not have the appropriate scope 
or size to be designated a wing, a major force provider unit designated the 4 EFG or 
4th Air Expeditionary Group could be established. 
31.7.3.1.2.  If the size and scope of an operation do not warrant the establishment of a 
squadron, a Numbered Flight nomenclature may be used.  For example, if the 4th Civil 
Engineer Squadron is the major force provider for an expeditionary mission, but size 
does not warrant a squadron designation, a major force provider unit designated 4th 
Expeditionary Civil Engineer Flight could be established. 
31.7.3.2.  The numerical designation for expeditionary units that do not have a major force 
provider reflects the designation of a historical unit activated to form a rainbow unit.  In 
cases where multiple Major Commands deploy forces to the same location, but a single 
major force provider cannot be identified, the supported Major Command creates 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
155 
expeditionary units using historical “rainbow” units allocated for their use by AF/A1MO.  
The numerical designation for expeditionary rainbow units keeps the numerical 
designation of the historical unit converted from permanent to provisional status.  Major 
commands work with their Historians and the Air Force Historical Research Agency to 
identify inactivated units to fill rainbow expeditionary unit requirements to meet highest 
projected demand and provide those units to AF/A1MO. AF/A1MO issues Department of 
the Air Force numbered letters to convert inactive historical units to provisional units and 
assign them to Major Commands to activate or inactivate in provisional unit status as 
needed (Figure A4.13). 
31.7.3.3.  All subordinate, dependent groups and support units carry the same numerical 
designation as the parent expeditionary organization.  For example, support units under the 
4th Expeditionary Fighter Wing would be designated the 4th Expeditionary Operations 
Group, 4th Expeditionary Maintenance Group, 4th Expeditionary Maintenance Squadron, 
4th Expeditionary Mission Support Group, 4th Expeditionary Logistics Readiness 
Squadron, and 4th Expeditionary Medical Group. 
31.7.3.4.  If portions of an organization are deployed to different locations, Major 
Commands are authorized to include the name of the operation and location in the unit 
designation (e.g., 71st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron-NOBLE ANVIL, Location Name).

xx Air 
Expeditionary 
Group (AEG) 
Temporary independent group 
assigned to an Air Expeditionary 
Task Force.  An independent group 
has the same functions and 
responsibilities as a like-type wing, 
but its scope and size do not 
warrant wing-level designation.   
Use the numerical 
designation of the major 
force provider unit or an 
authorized rainbow unit, as 
appropriate (e.g., 4th Air 
Expeditionary Group) 
xx Expeditionary 
[functional-kind] 
Group 
 
Temporary group assigned to an

A dependent group is a mission, 
maintenance, mission support, 
medical or large functional unit 
(e.g. communications) that 
provides the specified capability to 
a parent wing.  
 
 
An independent functional group is 
a large functional unit that does not 
report to a wing; e.g., the 1st 
Expeditionary Civil Engineer 
Group under the 9th Air 
Expeditionary Task Force. 
 
 
A dependent group uses the 
numerical designation of its 
parent expeditionary wing 
(e.g., 4th Expeditionary 
Operations Group, 4th

Detachment x, xx 
Expeditionary 
[functional-kind] 
[unit type] 
Temporary dependent detachment 
of an expeditionary unit.   
Number in sequence starting

Alphabetized in sequence 
starting with A.  Use the unit 
designation of its parent unit 
(e.g., OL-A, 24th 
Expeditionary Special 
Tactics Squadron) 
 
31.8.  Attaching and Assigning Provisional Units.   Provisional units are assigned to a higher 
echelon provisional unit or attached to a higher or same echelon permanent unit.  All expeditionary 
units are assigned to an Air Expeditionary Task Force or attached under a component Numbered 
Air Force and under the administrative control of the Air Force Component for the geographic 
region in which forces are based.  If a deployed expeditionary unit is not assigned or attached to 
the regional Commander, Air Force Forces (Secretary of Defense orders does not formally transfer, 
i.e., the forces, and the owning Combatant Command keeps control) then a host-tenant support 
agreement is required to define support requirements. 
31.9.  Administrative Control.   The administrative control responsibilities of the gaining 
Commander can vary by scenario; specify these in G-Series orders when possible.  The supporting 
and supported Major Commands work together to ensure the degree of administrative control 
responsibilities is clearly understood.  Specified administrative control responsibilities are 
included in AFDD Volume 1, Basic Doctrine. 
31.10.  Uniform Code of Military Justice.   Authority resides concurrently with the commanders 
in the assigned and attached units and does not need to be explicitly stated in G-series orders. (See 
51-series AFIs for specific information on disciplinary and Uniform Code of Military Justice 
matters.) 
31.11.  G-Series Orders.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting Units 
publish G-series orders to activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign, or attach provisional (including 
expeditionary) units.  The G-Series order provides the legal authority for provisional units. 
Examples of G-Series orders for provisional and expeditionary units are shown in Figures A4.14 
through A4.18 in Attachment 4.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting 
158 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
Units forward copies of unclassified and classified orders to AF/A1MO, the Air Force Historical 
Research Agency (HQ AFHRA/RSO, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell, AFB AL 36112-6424), and 
all units mentioned in the order.  Major commands, field operating agencies, and Direct Reporting 
Units use RCS: HAF-HO (M) 7401 to document the organizational changes to provisional units 
per AFI 84-105. 
31.11.1.  G-series orders for expeditionary units are prepared by the supported Major 
Command (reference paragraph 31.7.1) or in cases where forces are not attached, by the 
Major Command keeping operational control.  The supporting and supported Major 
Commands work closely together on drafting the G-series orders to ensure administrative 
control responsibilities are spelled out, and the Air Expeditionary Task Force commander’s 
concept for organization and unity of command are understood. 
31.11.2.  Command Relationships.  The supported and supporting command work closely 
together to develop the best organization structure to support mission requirements and build 
a clear chain of command.  For more information on command relationships, see Joint 
Publication (JP) 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States, and AFDD Volume 1. 
31.11.3.  Activation and inactivation dates may be specified in the same G-series order. 
31.11.4.  Major commands may add the name of the operation and location to any unit in the 
G-series orders. 
31.11.5.  Classify and declassified G-series orders per the classification guidance published for 
the exercise or operation.  Classified orders have appropriate paragraph marking, classified by, 
and declassification guidance.  Declassify the orders as soon as permissible or use a specific 
event (i.e., activation date) as the declassification date. 
31.11.6.  G-series orders for recurring and major exercise (when required) units follow the 
same basic conventions as those used for expeditionary units. 
31.11.7.  A G-series order is not required to establish a provisional or permanent Major 
Command headquarters.  A DAF/A1M letter is the authority and establishes the specific Major 
Command headquarters activation date.

Chapter 32 
MISSION DIRECTIVES 
32.1.  General Guidelines.  
32.1.1.  Mission directives provide general guidance about an organization's mission and 
communicate the unit's mission and responsibilities to the Commander and unit personnel.  
Mission directives describe what an organization does, not how it does it, and are at the 
executive level.  A checklist of specific tasks is not appropriate for the general guidance 
commanders provide in mission directives. 
32.1.2.  Every unit in the Air Force will have a mission directive. (T-1). 
32.1.2.1.  Detachments and other activities below squadron level do not require a mission 
directive unless directed by the Major Command, Direct Reporting Unit, or Field Operating 
Agency Commander. 
32.1.2.2.  When two or more subordinate units have the same mission, the Major 
Command, Direct Reporting Unit, or Field Operating Agency may issue a single mission 
directive.  For example, when several wings have the same mission, only one mission 
directive is necessary for those wings. 
32.1.2.3.  At their discretion, Major Commands may waive the requirement for a mission 
directive for units below the Numbered and Named Air Force level that have a current 
designed operational capability (DOC) statement per AFI 10-201, Force Readiness 
Reporting. 
32.1.3.  Major commands, Direct Reporting Units, and field operating agencies will issue 
mission directives for each directly assigned and Air Reserve Component gained or associate 
unit.  (T-1).  Major commands may delegate the authority to issue mission directives to 
subordinate units. 
32.1.4.  The office of primary responsibility, certifying authority, and approving authority for 
an organization’s mission directive must be in a higher-level organization within its chain of 
command. (T-1). 
32.2.  AFMDs.  AFMDs are a special publication type and provide the missions for the Air Force’s 
major subdivisions that report directly to Headquarters Air Force (Major Commands, Direct 
Reporting Units and field operating agencies).  Headquarters Air Force offices of primary 
responsibility use these guidelines to develop AFMDs for each Major Command, Direct Reporting 
Unit, and Field Operating Agency.  The Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force approves AFMDs for 
Major Commands and Direct Reporting Units.  The appropriate Headquarters Air Force two-digit 
official (e.g., SAF/IG, AF/A3) approves AFMDs for their field operating agencies. 
32.2.1.  AF/A1: 
32.2.1.1.  Maintains a focal point for matters about AFMDs (AF/A1MO). 
32.2.1.2.  Determines the certifying authority for each Major Command, Direct Reporting 
Unit, and Field Operating Agency AFMD (See Table 32.1).  The certifying authority, in 
turn, appoints an office of primary responsibility (e.g., three or four-digit staff office). 
160 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
During the AFMD’s review every four years or as necessary, certifying officials review 
the office of primary responsibility designation to ensure it is up-to-date. 
32.2.2.  Each AFMD office of primary responsibility: 
32.2.2.1.  Prepares assigned AFMDs. 
32.2.2.2.  Revises the AFMD when the mission changes. 
32.2.2.3.  Coordinates new and revised AFMDs at the Headquarters Air Force level per 
AFI 33-360. 
32.3.  Major command, Direct Reporting Unit, and Field Operating Agency commanders: 
32.3.1.  Issue and control mission directives for their subordinate units. (T-1).  These are 
command publications. 
32.3.2.  Appoint offices of primary responsibility to prepare individual mission directives. (T-
1). 
32.3.3.  Appoint a focal point and maintainer of a central repository of mission directives. (T-
1). 
32.4.  Preparing a Mission Directive.  Offices of primary responsibility at every level will use 
these guidelines and the sample (Figure 32.1) when preparing mission directives. (T-1). 
32.4.1.  Create a broad outline of the principal components of the organization's mission, but 
provide enough detail to clarify the following: 
32.4.1.1.  Mission.  Include all necessary elements of the organization's mission and duties. 
32.4.1.2.  Command.  Specify the relationships, if applicable, between: 
32.4.1.2.1.  Headquarters Air Force and commanders of Major Commands, Direct 
Reporting Units, field operating agencies, or selected offices. 
32.4.1.2.2.  The organization and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
32.4.1.2.3.  The Air Force components and the Combatant Command of assignment. 
32.4.1.2.4.  The organization and other Air Force organizations, government agencies, 
United States Military Services and the armed forces and government agencies of other 
nations. 
32.4.1.3.  Responsibilities. Identify the mission elements assigned by Combatant 
Commanders or higher authorities.  Define the Commander's responsibility for executing 
those elements of the mission. 
32.4.2.  Legal or higher headquarters direction.  Cite any laws or higher headquarter directives 
that provide specific direction regarding the organization’s mission, responsibilities, and 
command relationships. 
32.4.3.  Length.  Be brief; if possible, limit to no more than two pages. 
32.4.4.  Language and Tone.  The mission directive is an order from a superior Commander to 
a subordinate Commander.  The mission directive directs action.  Use simple, clear, and direct 
language to make mission directives easy to understand. 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
161 
32.4.5.  Subparagraphs.  The nature of the organization determines the headings for 
subparagraphs.  Keep the focus at the executive level rather than on specifics. 
32.4.6.  Security Classification.  Do not classify mission directives.  Classified supplements 
may be prepared, if necessary, to describe a unit's mission. 
32.5.  Mission Directive Numbering. 
32.5.1.  Major command, Direct Reporting Unit, and Field Operating Agency AFMDs have 
the numbers in Table 32.1 AF/A1 assigns, deletes, or changes AFMD numbers as necessary.  
AF/A1MO is AF/A1’s contact office for this. 
32.5.2.  Unit-Level Mission Directives.  Mission directive numbers for units below a Major 
Command, Direct Reporting Unit, and Field Operating Agency begin with the parent 
organization's abbreviation followed by three digits, assigned at the organization's discretion 
(e.g., Air Combat Command mission directives would be Numbered ACCMD XXX).  Each 
Major Command, Direct Reporting Unit, and Field Operating Agency will publish a list of all 
organization mission directives. (T-1).

Terms 
Attribute Code—Data code in the Manpower Execution Programming System which can impact 
manpower requirement/authorization position information related to the manpower type code, 
programming element code, grade and Air Force specialty codes. 
Authorized End Strength—The count of Air Force military and civilian positions the Air Force 
needs to have funded and cannot exceed, in each year of the FYDP to accomplish all approved 
missions. FYDP end strength is allocated to Commands by program element code (PEC) and 
category (officer, enlisted and civilian). 
Commander—For the purposes of the directions in this instruction, collectively refers to 
commanders and civilian leaders of established units. Do not construe to confer any 
responsibilities or authorities reserved for military commanders to civilian leaders. 
Centrally Managed—Functions with Individual Mobilization Augmentees in Chaplain (HC), 
medical (SG) or legal (JA) career fields, in which all Individual Mobilization Augmentee 
requirements are ‘centrally’ managed HQ AFRC functional manager.  Any request to add or 
eliminate one of these Individual Mobilization Augmentee specialties must be coordinated with 
the appropriate HQ AFRC functional manager. 
Contract Full—Time Equivalent— It is a calculated based on a 2080 annual hours as mandated 
in The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-272, April 7, 
1986) which amended 5 USC 5504(b). Prior to then an hourly rate of basic pay was computed by 
dividing the employee's annual rate of basic pay by 2,080 hours (the number of hours in 52 
workweeks of 40 hours) and rounding to the nearest cent. This formula presumes a calendar year 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
169 
consisting of exactly 52 weeks or 364 calendar days. However, a calendar year actually consists 
of either 365 or 366 calendar days. Thus, a calendar year may have more paid work days than a 
52-week year. A General Accounting Office study published in 1981 demonstrated that over a 28-
year period (the period of time it takes for the calendar to repeat itself) there are, on average, 2,087 
work hours per calendar year. This average results from the fact there are usually 4 years with 262 
work days (2,096 hours), 17 years with 261 work days (2,088 hours), and 7 years with 260 work 
days (2,080 hours). The 2,087 divisor is derived from the following formula: (2,096 hours*4 years) 
+ (2,088 hours*17 years) + (2,080 hours*7 years) / 28 years = 2,087.143 hours. Using 2,087 as the 
average number of work hours in a calendar year reasonably accommodates the year-to-year 
fluctuations in work hours. 
Controlled Program Element—Any program that is funded outside of AFRC and controlled by 
a separate agency, such as Special Operations Forces or Military Intelligence Program. 
Department of Defense Component—Refers to any Department of Defense activity other than 
the Department of the Air Force and Air Reserve Components. 
Full—Time Equivalent—A FTE is a measure of workload; a daily work allocation is 8 hours, 
and a yearly allocation may be 2080 hours (40 hours per week for 52 weeks).  An individual’s 
work duration may be determined based on the person's FTE in the following way, for a given 
period of two work days: 0.75 FTE (assumed) x 2 work days (given) x 8 hours per workday (typical 
allocation rate) = 12 hours work duration. 
Headquarters Air Force—Refers to the Secretariat and Air Staff. 
Inherently Governmental/Commercial Activity—Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) 
Act of 1998, Public Law 105-270, mandates that all functions within the federal government be 
coded into one of three categories, Inherently Governmental (IG) , Commercial Activity Exempt 
(CE), or Commercial Activity (CA).  This act serves two primary functions, ensure IG functions 
remain in-house and to achieve savings and effectiveness of CAs through cost analysis. The act 
further mandates that the coding of all Air Force authorizations, with the exception of Non-
appropriated Fund (NAF) and some intelligence authorizations, be reported to Congress on an 
annual basis. 
Inventory for Contract Services—As required by USC Title 10, Section 2330a, the intent of the 
ICS is for the Department of Defense to provide an inventory of contract service support, to include 
the contractor labor hours expended, and report this by the end of the 3rd quarter of the next fiscal 
year. This includes a service-level review of the inventory to ensure contractors are not performing 
inherently governmental work; that to the maximum extent, contractors are not performing close 
to inherently governmental work; that any personal service contracts being performed are within 
statutory and regulatory guidance; and to identify any support contractor activities that may be 
considered for conversion to government performance. 
Major Command—For the purposes of directions in this instruction, collectively refers to Major 
Commands, Direct Reporting Units, field operating agencies and SAF/AAR and the National 
Guard Bureau (NGB).  The term “Command” may also be used instead of “Major Command” 
(e.g., “command grade factor” instead of “Major Command grade factor”). 
MAJCOM/A1M Staff—Refers to Major Command, Direct Reporting Unit, Field Operating 
Agency manpower staffs, NGB/A1M and SAF/AARM. 
170 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
Man-hour Availability Factor—This factor is the average number of man-hours per month an 
assigned individual is available to do assigned duties. Required man-hours are divided by the Man-
hour Availability Factor times the overload factor to determine the manpower requirements. 
Man-hour—A unit of measuring work. It is equivalent to one person working at a normal pace 
for 60 minutes, two people working at a normal pace for 30 minutes, or a similar combination of 
people working at a normal pace for a period of time equal to 60 minutes. 
Manpower Authorization—A funded manpower requirement with detail that defines the position 
in its function, organization, location, skill, grade, and other appropriate characteristics which 
commands use to extend end strength resources to units. May appear as a “funded” or “unfunded” 
authorization on the Unit Manpower Document and in the Manpower Programming and Execution 
System. 
Manpower Requirement—Joint Publication 1 defines manpower requirements as human 
resources needed to accomplish a specific job, workload, mission, or program. There are two types 
of manpower requirements: funded and unfunded. Funded manpower requirements are those that 
have been validated and allocated. Unfunded requirements are validated manpower needs that have 
been deferred because of budgetary constraints. Manpower requirements are generally determined 
by an Air Force Manpower Standard or other management decision. 
Manpower Standard—The basic tool used to determine the most effective and efficient level of 
manpower required to support a function. It is a quantitative expression that represents a work 
center's man-hour requirements in response to varying levels of workload. 
Mission/Mission Support Panel—Air Force Corporate structure group subject matter experts 
which include MAJCOM representation to begin the resource allocation process by conducting 
baseline reviews of programs contained in their portfolios.  Panels review and develop options for 
presentation to intermediate level review.  They analyze and assess all programs and program 
elements vice integrated priority lists.  Panels validate and recommend MAJCOM, DRU, and FOA 
program adjustments (e.g. Personnel and Training, Rapid Global Mobility, Space Superiority, 
Nuclear Deterrence Operations).  They advocate their core competency and address 
standardization, rationalization, and interoperability requirements and capabilities. 
Non-Air Force Activity—Collectively refers to any activity outside the Department of the Air 
Force. 
Non—Department of Defense Government Activity - Collectively refers to any federal, state, 
or local government activity not part of the Department of Defense. 
Out of Cycle Request—Outside the annual Individual Mobilization Augmentee Program Review. 
Overload Factor—The overload factor is applied in conjunction with certain Man-hour 
Availability Factors during the manpower determinants application and ensures effective use of 
Air Force manpower authorizations. The overload factor realizes Air Force leadership’s 
expectation that some overtime is an effective tool instead of adding additional manpower 
requirements. 
Unfunded Manpower Requirement—An approved manpower requirement on the Unit 
Manpower Document that reflects recognized and/or necessary workload, however which is not 
funded—meaning no individual can be assigned to, or receive a permanent change of station order 
to the position. 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
171 
Unit Manpower Document—The Unit Manpower Document report is a computer generated 
product from the Manpower Programming and Execution System or Business Objects (BO) 
business intelligence reporting tool that contains Regular Air Force military, civilian, traditional 
reservists (TR), Active Guard Reserve, Air Reserve Technician (ART), and Individual 
Mobilization Augmentee authorizations. The Unit Manpower Document report reflects total force

THE MANPOWER PROGRAMMING AND EXECUTION SYSTEM 
A2.1.  Overview.  The Manpower Programming and Execution System is the family of 
applications that support manpower budgeting, unit manpower requirements, personnel and 
position management, manpower modeling, and reporting and analysis for the Regular Air Force, 
ANG, Air Force Reserve, and civilian workforce.  It is the authoritative data source for all funded 
Air Force end strength and associated Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution 
manpower changes.  Within the Manpower Programming and Execution System, specific 
manpower change control numbers and change control numbers are used to validate manpower 
requirement changes.  Manpower requirement changes are then loaded into the system per 
validated program element requirements and projected funding. 
A2.2.  Future Year Defense Program Key the Manpower Programming and Execution 
System Data Elements. 
A2.2.1.  Change Control Number.  A change control number is assigned to an initiative, 
offset, or disconnect option under consideration.  Change control numbers are used in all the 
various Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution databases and tools to 
ensure all the pieces of the option are tracked and priced together.  One primary function of 
the change control number is to enforce accountability and input control of the database.  The 
author of the change control number must be consulted before any changes are made. 
A2.2.2.  Command Identifier.  An attribute used to represent the Major Command, Field 
Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit that will receive the manpower resource allocation 
for the authorization. 
A2.2.3.  Manpower Change Request.  Consists of a two-digit “command identification” 
code, a four-digit exercise code, and a four-digit “sequence” manpower change control 
number. Manpower change control number consists of the following: the first character is the 
major force program, the second character is the last digit of exercise year, the third character 
is the type of exercise, fourth and fifth characters is for “super-tracking,” and the sixth, seventh, 
and eighth characters are open to programmer’s discretion. 
A2.2.4.  Program Element Code.  This code is directly related to a parent program element 
with cost data related to a weapon system or support function as shown in the United States 
Air Force and Financial Program. 
A2.2.5.  Resource Identification Code.  This code identifies categories of resources such as 
treasury codes for funds, component, and category of personnel for manpower, and type of unit 
for forces.  Each resource identification code has only one appropriation; the resource 
identification code is a four-position code that identifies the type of resources assigned to each 
program element. 
A2.2.6.  Country State Code.  For manpower programming, the value for states within the 
continental United States is “A0”; states outside the continental United States are numbers. All 
others countries values are letters and numbers.

BASE SUPPORT TAIL (BST) FACTORS 
A3.1.  Overview.  Mission and capability changes affect installation support requirements; 
therefore, programmed changes in mission manpower affect installation support manpower 
requirements and may impact service levels for private-sector contract support. The relative effect 
of these changes is represented as Air Force BST factors. 
A3.2.  Base Support Tail Factor Use.    BST factors are to be used in conjunction with other tools 
when determining manpower impacts of mission capability changes and are not applicable to Air 
Reserve Component bases. 
A3.2.1.  Weapons System Base Support Tail.  Developed to include general base support 
tail, this factor of 7.0% estimates common installation support requirements as well as those 
that indirectly support aircraft or other weapons system operations (e.g., vehicle maintenance 
and fuels management).  This factor may be used to determine base support tail associated with 
the mission and operational unit moves. 
A3.2.2.  General Base Support Tail.  The factor of 5.4% is used to estimate common 
installation support for activities moving into or from an installation.  Examples include field 
operating agencies, Numbered and Named Air Forces, or headquarters units. 
A3.3.  Mission Transfers.  For mission transfers between Regular Air Force, ANG or Air Force 
Reserve, or new ANG or Air Force Reserve missions on a Regular Air Force base, AF/A1MP will 
compute installation support impacts as follows: 
A3.3.1.  For Active Guard and Reserve.  AF/A1MP will compute installation support 
impacts using the same approved continental United States general support factor (5.4 percent) 
used for Regular Air Force full-time military. 
A3.3.2.  For drill spaces.  AF/A1MP will compute installation support by applying a 2 percent 
factor to total drill spaces. 
A3.4.  Installation Support Reductions.  AF/A1MP will keep any installation support manpower 
savings associated with a base closure or realignment, or Program Objective Memorandum or 
President’s Budget force structure decisions as program savings for use in the future programming 
cycles.  The allocation of any retained manpower savings will be per Air Force Corporate Structure 
decisions on manpower priorities.  Any resulting increases in installation support manpower 
associated with mission transfers are to be programmed as part of the mission transfer and offset 
by the activity proposing the transfer. 
A3.4.1.  Major commands must internally offset self-initiated changes that change base 
support population at their bases or that of another command (including host-tenant support 
agreements in intercommand transfers) if the resulting population changes drive an installation 
support increase at other commands installations.  AF/A1MP does not provide offsets for 
installation support resources in such cases. 
A3.4.2.  For actions affecting the Air Reserve Component, the tasking command, including the 
ANG or Air Force Reserve, must develop manpower agreements and work with the affected 
commands on transfers of base support resources to support unit moves. 
174 
AFI38-101  29 AUGUST 2019 
A3.4.3.  The tasking command provides or programs for, required base support resources when 
a prime function or tenant organization of that command is moved. 
A3.4.3.1.  Refer any disagreement between losing and gaining commands to AF/A1MP. 
A3.4.4.  AF/A1MP normally does not program installation support manpower tail to support 
changes to other installation support functions or non-mission areas. 
A3.4.5.  AF/SG determines medical support requirements in a separate medical annual 
planning and programming guidance exercise.  Their requirements are typically made known 
during the Program Budget Review and codified in memorandums of agreement. 
A3.4.6.  AF/A4 determines real property requirements during the Program Objective 
Memorandum process.  AF/A4 uses total square footage of floor space, not population, as the 
primary driver to determine their manpower requirements.  Mission changes and resulting 
population changes do not necessarily drive changes in real property requirements. 
A3.4.7.  The Defense Commissary Agency determines commissary support requirements 
generated by a change in mission manpower requirements.  Their requirements are identified 
through the corporate process. 
A3.4.8.  Air Force organizations tasked by other government departments or Department of 
Defense agencies must develop manpower and funding agreements using the inter-Service 
support agreement and work with AF/A1M, SAF/FMP, and respective functional staff to 
ensure that required out-year manpower programming actions are addressed.
