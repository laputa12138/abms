SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This publication is new and consistent with the publication reduction effort objectives; it 
consolidates five instructions in the Intelligence series of publications.  This manual should be 
completely reviewed.  To encourage innovation at all echelons, members may refer to DoD 
issuances instead of specific direction provided in the superseded AFIs. 
1.  OVERVIEW. 
1.1.  Purpose.  This guidance contains 10 tiered compliance statements:  7 (T-0); 2 (T-1); 1 
(T-2); 0 (T-3).  It includes guidance for conducting multi-source, multi-discipline ISR 
operations to enable the Air Force ISR Enterprise’s continuing transformation into an 
integrated, flattened organization.  This manual provides decision makers within the National 
Command Authority, combatant commands, Intelligence Community, and warfighters with 
the most complete intelligence picture through next-generation ISR dominance across 
multiple domains.  Also, this manual promotes commanders’ good judgment to empower 
Airmen at all levels, within the limits of the law, ethics, morality, and their experience.  
Provisions of this publication do not apply to persons who conduct law enforcement and/or 
counterintelligence activities. 
1.2.  Intelligence Oversight and Operations Security.  All Airmen involved in the conduct 
of ISR activities also comply with AFI 14-404, Intelligence Oversight and AFI 10-701, 
Operations Security, in the execution of mission and duties.  For cryptologic matters, Airmen 
coordinate Intelligence Oversight reports to the Air Force Cryptologic Office.  Airmen must 
comply to protect the constitutional/legal rights and the privacy/civil liberties of U.S. Persons 
as defined by AFI 14-404 (T-0). 
1.3.  Multi-INT  is integrated multi-source and collaborative multi-discipline (i.e. geospatial 
intelligence (GEOINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), etc.) 
ISR that enables sensing, identification, attribution and sharing of intelligence, in turn 
providing decision advantage across all domains. 
1.4.  Domains  . 
1.4.1.  ISR from/for the Air domain synchronizes and integrates the planning and 
operation of sensors; assets; and processing, exploitation, and dissemination systems in 
order to produce intelligence products that support the mission of the Air Force. 
1.4.2.  ISR from/for the Cyberspace domain is an integrated intelligence and operations 
function, focusing on tactical and operational information gathering and mapping of 
enemy and adversary networks, systems, capabilities, and activity to support military 
planning, as described in Joint Publication 3-12, Cyberspace Operations. 
1.4.3.  ISR from/for the Space domain provides an ISR collection vantage point and is a 
warfighting domain that requires ISR support to ensure space superiority as described in 
Joint Publication 3-14, Space Operations.  The Air Force conducts space ISR IAW 
DoDD 3100.10, Space Policy. 
1.4.4.  ISR from/for the Land and Maritime domains provides additional vantage points 
to characterize the battlespace.

should there be questions with regard to mission-related exceptions (T-0). 
2.12.3.  In order to meet audit obligations outlined in DoDM 5240.01 prohibit members 
from using non-DoD-controlled information systems or devices to conduct research on 
behalf of an assigned mission or other duty-related reason.  Research conducted on non-
DoD-controlled information systems or devices for personal interests and/or professional 
development shall be permitted.  Members may not misrepresent research conducted on 
non-DoD-controlled information systems or devices on behalf of an assigned mission or 
other duty-related reason as research conducted for personal interests and/or professional 
development (T-0).

and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict 
physical features and geographically referenced activities on the earth.  All intelligence 
8 
AFMAN14-405  11 MAY 2020 
integrates with GEOINT.  GEOINT consists of imagery, imagery intelligence, and geospatial 
information. 
3.1.1.  GEOINT activities are conducted by personnel assigned, attached, or supporting 
units with authorized GEOINT missions IAW:

Information and Services Supplemental Instruction to Joint Strategic Capabilities 
Plan (JSCP); and 
3.1.1.8.  Joint Publication 2-03, Geospatial Intelligence Support in Joint Operations. 
3.1.2.  The AFGE is the community of Air Force users and producers of geospatial 
products and data at all levels of command and functions.  These include ISR, logistics, 
engineering, force protection, NASIC, Air Force Flight Standards Agency, and the 557th 
Weather Wing.  The AFGE ensures that data and services comply with policies specified 
in NSGD 3201.  AFGE develops and resources the GEOINT sensor, systems, and 
tradecraft that leverages machine learning to synchronize ISR collection and exploitation 
across the enterprise, leading to fusion of data and information at the point of need. 
3.2.  Human Intelligence (HUMINT)  is an ISR collection activity in which humans are 
both the source and collection platform for information.  HUMINT is a key capability 
undergirding nearly all foundational intelligence collections and understanding of the 
battlespace.  The Air Force is authorized and directed to conduct HUMINT collection 
operations, reporting, and related intelligence activities IAW DoDD S-5200.37, Management 
and Execution of Defense Human Intelligence.  HUMINT activities are conducted by 
personnel assigned, attached or supporting units with authorized HUMINT missions and 
appropriate training, qualifications, and leadership IAW:

quantitative and qualitative analysis of physical attributes of targets and events to detect, 
identify, locate, and characterize them.  Advanced MASINT analysis provides algorithms 
supporting missions and platforms operating across the Air, Land, Sea, and Space domains.  
Personnel assigned or attached to, or otherwise supporting units with authorized missions 
IAW DoDI 5105.58, conduct MASINT activities in a manner to optimize sensing, 
identification, attribution and sharing, aircraft, and space systems in support of mission sets. 
3.4.  Publicly Available Information (PAI) and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).  PAI 
is “information that has been published or broadcast for public consumption, is available on 
request to the public, is accessible on-line or otherwise to the public, is available to the public 
by subscription or purchase, could be seen or heard by any casual observer, is made available 
at a meeting open to the public, or is obtained by visiting any place or attending any event 
that is open to the public.  Publicly available information includes information generally 
available to persons in a military community even though the military community is not open 
to the civilian general public” as stated in DoDM 5240.01. 
3.4.1.  Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is intelligence that is produced from PAI that is 
collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for 
the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement as stated in DoDI 3115.12, 
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). 
3.4.2.  Intelligence organizations and personnel are authorized to conduct PAI research 
and collection to produce intelligence IAW their mission, DoDD 3115.18, DoD Access to 
and Use of Publicly Available Information (PAI) and DoDM 5240.01.  Integrating PAI 
into analytic workflows supports fusion of information at the speed and point of need.
