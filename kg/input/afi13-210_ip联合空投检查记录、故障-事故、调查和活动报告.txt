Chapter 1
Introduction
1–1. Purpose
This regulation provides policies and assigns responsibilities for initial notification, investigation, reporting, and
submitting reports of parachute and airdrop load malfunctions/incidents. In addition, it standardizes Joint airdrop
inspections, responsibilities and duties of the malfunction officer (MO), malfunction/incident investigation procedures,
and activity reporting for all Department of Defense (DOD) components engaged in premeditated airdrop operations.
Department of Defense component test agencies in authorized testing are exempt from malfunction and incident
reporting for the item under test, but are not exempt from malfunction/incident reporting for any fielded/type classified
parachute component or event outside the scope of the test.
1–2. References
Required and related publications and prescribed and referenced forms are listed in appendix A.
1–3. Explanation of abbreviations and terms
Abbreviations and special terms used in this regulation are explained in the glossary.
1–4. Responsibilities
a. The Commander, U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center (USACRC) will maintain a record of intentional and/or
unintentional malfunctions/incidents that result in a serious injury or death during the conduct of an airborne operation.
Accidents that involve the use of U.S. Army aircraft will be investigated, reported, and recorded in accordance with
AR 385–10 and DA Pam 385–40.
b. The Commander, U.S. Army Quartermaster Center and School (USAQMC&S) will develop, maintain, validate,
and publish both a program of instruction (POI) and lesson plans covering the duties and responsibilities of the
malfunction officer (MO).
c. Commanders at all levels of command will—
(1) Ensure malfunction investigations receive the highest priority, secondary only to medical aid for the injured,
which will supersede all other aspects of the operation, including ground tactical play. Prompt and accurate investiga-
tions and reporting can and will save lives and equipment.
(2) Ensure that qualified personnel are ready and available for the purpose of recording the Joint airdrop inspection,
conducting malfunction/incident investigations, and providing timely and accurate reporting of airdrop malfunctions
and activities.
(3) Ensure standards of onsite investigations and chain of custody are strictly enforced as outlined in this regulation.
(4) Appoint, in writing (of units owning airdrop equipment), a unit subject matter expert (SME) who is a parachute
rigger such as an airdrop systems technician (military occupational specialty (MOS) 921A), a MOS 92R4P, or other
Service-specific rigger personnel. The appointed SME may assist the designated MO in the event of a serious incident,
malfunction, or fatality.
d. Air Force (AF) operations group commanders will appoint an aerial delivery review panel (ADRP) to investigate
airdrop malfunctions, incidents, and off drop zone (DZ) airdrops occurring within their command area of responsibility.
(1) The ADRP chairperson will determine panel composition based on the nature of the situation under review.
(2) Panel members will include the chief of tactics (chairperson), tactics pilot, navigator, loadmaster, standardization
pilot, Joint airdrop inspector (JAI) loadmaster, flying safety officer, maintenance representative, aerial port representa-
tive, crewmembers from the incident aircraft and drop zone control officer.
(3) Aerial delivery review panel members (except maintenance representatives) will be airdrop qualified where
appropriate. A special tactics squadron (STS) ADRP will consist of the unit commander, the MO, and the chief of
standardization.
(4) The review panel will convene the next duty day after the airdrop if the malfunction or incident occurs in the
local area. If the incident occurs away from home station, the panel will convene within five duty days (10 days for the
Air Reserve component) after the aircrew returns to home station. In the event of a Class A or B mishap, the aircrew
will remain on station until the aircraft has been eliminated as a potential causal factor for the mishap by the
Malfunction Officer.
(5) Results of the review panel will be sent to Headquarters (HQ) Air Mobility Command (AMC)/A3DT through the
parent AF major command (MAJCOM) and, if applicable, to the command having command and control of that
aircraft, with an information copy to the Director, Aerial Delivery and Field Services Department (ADFSD) (ATTN:
ATSM–ADFSD), 710 Adams Avenue, Fort Lee, VA 23801–1502.
e. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps units will convene local review boards at the next higher command level to
evaluate malfunctions or other airdrop related incidents within their commands.
(1) Army. The review panel will convene the next duty day or sooner if the malfunction/incident occurs in the local
area. If the incident occurs away from home station, the panel will convene within five duty days. The panel will be
1
AR 59–4/OPNAVINST 4630.24D/AFJ 13–210(I)/MCO 13480.1D • 8 April 2008
chaired by a parachute rigger qualified officer or warrant officer (MOS 92D or 921A). The chairperson will determine
the composition of the board. At minimum, it will include an MOS 921A, the MO, and a recorder. Results of the
review panel will be sent through the Army Command (ACOM)/Army Service Component Command (ASCC)/Direct
Reporting Unit (DRU) to the Army transported force, the U.S. Army airdrop support unit, and the Director, ADFSD
(ATTN: ATSM–ADFSD), 710 Adams Avenue, Fort Lee, VA 23801–1502.
(2) Navy and Marine Corps. The composition of the board will be determined by the severity of the malfunction or
incident. At minimum, it will include a Marine MOS 0451/Navy enlisted classification 7353 parachute rigger and an
MO.
f. The airlift unit will secure all airdrop loads and personnel in the aircraft, complete rigging the aircraft, and
accomplish the extraction or release of personnel, supplies, and equipment from aircraft in flight. A JAI will be
completed for all loads rigged for airdrop from all aircraft in accordance with this regulation. The loadmaster will make
available the specific cargo loading manual (AF TO 1C–XXX–9) for that particular aircraft during the JAI.
g. The transported force will prepare and deliver supplies and equipment to be airdropped to the airdrop support unit
and assist with rigging and transportation. The transported force will request AF Joint airdrop inspector support.
h. Members of the airdrop support unit will—
(1) Rig, deliver, and assist with airdrop cargo in accordance with applicable Service directives and/or as outlined in
DOD 4500.9–R, Part 3, Appendix Z. For Services supporting their own unilateral training, the aerial delivery function
will assume the responsibilities of the transported force. For personnel airdrops, the jumpmaster’s (JM’s) unit of
assignment will assume the responsibilities of the transported force.
(2) Ensure that the JM, drop zone safety officer (DZSO), JAI, MO, and safety and medical personnel are appointed
as required in accordance with Service regulations.
(3) Ensure a MO is present on the DZ during all airborne operations. This MO will maintain constant contact (may
be by radio) with the DZ control party and the Air Force combat control team, if present.
(4) Ensure the applicable field manual (FM), AF technical order (AFTO), or Naval Air Systems Command
(NAVAIR)/Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) publication is available to all JAIs. Digital format is preferred
(hard copy is acceptable).
(5) Provide Joint airdrop inspection records to be used as a checklist for Joint airdrop inspections.
(6) Provide information on combat and humanitarian airdrop operations. Ensure every effort is made by the airdrop
support unit officer in charge/noncommissioned officer (NCO) in charge to collect this information through any and all
means possible (such as strike reports, flash reports, after action reports, camera footage, and so forth). This informa-
tion will be submitted in accordance with the reporting requirements in chapter 5 of this regulation.
Note. Under certain circumstances, the transported force and airdrop support unit are the same.
1–5. Use of reported data
a. Accurate and timely reports are essential for proper analysis to improve existing procedures and technology as
rapidly as possible.
b. The USAQMC&S, ADFSD, Fort Lee, VA, will publish all reported malfunction/incident activity data for review
and analysis during the triannual airdrop malfunction and safety analysis review board meeting. The USAQMC&S,
ADFSD is the proponent activity responsible for receiving, tabulating, and developing airdrop malfunctions/incidents
for review and analysis.
1–6. Triannual airdrop malfunction and safety analysis review board
a. The USAQMC&S, ADFSD, will host a triannual airdrop malfunction and safety analysis review board. Airdrop
units throughout DOD are strongly encouraged to send representatives.
b. The board will include—

USAQMC&S resident or mobile training team Airdrop Load Inspector Certification Course (ALICC) presented by the
ADFSD at Fort Lee, VA.
2–2. Inspection procedures
a. Prior to airdrop, loads or containers rigged for airdrop will be inspected three times separately. An airdrop load
will not be accepted unless it is rigged in accordance with specific FMs/TOs distributed by USAQMC&S, ADFSD, or
the Joint Special Operations Command. Nonstandard and free-drop door bundles will be rigged and inspected in
accordance with the appropriate FM/TO and/or manufacturer instructions. Waivers for nonstandard airdrop loads
dropped from AF aircraft will be submitted to HQ AMC/A3DT through the applicable Army ACOM/ASCC/DRU or
Air Force MAJCOM. Do not accept an airdrop load unless it has been rigged by a qualified rigger or under the
supervision of a qualified rigger. Air Force riggers fall into two categories—
(1) Air transportation specialists (AF specialty code (AFSC) 2T2X1), Aircrew Flight equipment specialist (AFSC
1P0X1), or aircraft loadmasters (AFSC 1A2X1) who have successfully completed the USAQMC&S Fabrication of
Aerial Delivery Loads Course (FADLC).
(2) Airdrop specialists of the Parachute Rigger Course who are considered qualified riggers may rig any AF-owned
equipment for airdrop.
b. Individuals holding any of the above AFSCs and completing the AMC version of FADLC are authorized to rig
only unilateral airdrop training loads as defined in paragraph 2–2e.
c. Inspection criteria are detailed below.
(1) The first inspection is the shop final inspection, which is conducted when the rigging is complete. This
inspection is in accordance with the FM, TO, or NAVSEA publication for the specific piece of equipment or load. The
inspector will use the applicable DD Form 1748–series form for this inspection, which will be performed by a rigger
other than the one who supervised the rigging of the load. The inspector does not need to be JAI qualified.
(2) The second inspection is the before-loading inspection. An airdrop support unit JAI and an AFJAI will conduct
it Jointly. Both inspectors will complete the applicable DD Form 1748–series form, and both will sign the appropriate
blocks to certify correct rigging of the load. Both inspectors must be JAI qualified.
(a) The AFJAI will focus on safety of flight; aircrew safety; dimensions of rigged airdrop loads in accordance with
applicable rigging FMs/TOs; extraction/deployment systems; platform/skid condition; lashings and load restraint;
emergency aft restraint provisions; weight, type, and number of recovery parachutes; hazardous cargo certification; and
locks.
(b) The AFJAI will bring to the attention of the airdrop support unit JAI, any items other than those listed in
paragraph (a), above that are found to be incorrect or in question. If the airdrop support unit JAI accepts the condition
of the item, the discrepancy will be annotated in the "Remarks" section of the appropriate inspection form. Upon
delivery, the aircraft loadmaster will review the DD Form 1748–series form verifying that the inspections are complete.
(c) If the AFJAI rejects the rigged load or any portion of the load, the AFJAI will annotate the reason in the
"Remarks" section of the appropriate inspection form.
(3) The third inspection is the after-loading inspection. After the aircraft loadmaster completes the loading and in-
aircraft rigging, the AFJAI, an airdrop support unit JAI, and the aircrew loadmaster together will accomplish this
inspection. The AFJAI and the airdrop support unit inspectors must be JAI qualified. The aircraft loadmaster does not
need to be JAI qualified.
(a) After completion of the after-loading inspection, the two inspectors and the aircrew loadmaster will sign the
form certifying that the load is ready for airdrop. The aircraft loadmaster, the AFJAI, and the support unit JAI will
retain copies and forward a copy to the transported force’s appropriate command headquarters.
Note. When authorized by the AF MAJCOM Director of Operations, an airdrop-qualified loadmaster (qualified on the specific type
of aircraft and associated airdrop system) who is not assigned to the aircrew or performing aircrew duties may conduct the after-
loading inspection as the aircraft loadmaster.
(b) If the aircraft loadmaster or AFJAI rejects the load for any reason, the reason(s) for rejection will be annotated
in the “Remarks” block of the appropriate DA Form 1748–series form and a copy will be retained. The loadmaster or
inspector will submit the copy to the wing tactics function the next duty day or on return to home station. Wing tactics
3
AR 59–4/OPNAVINST 4630.24D/AFJ 13–210(I)/MCO 13480.1D • 8 April 2008
will forward an info copy to the group standardization/evaluation office. Wing tactics will develop a trend/metrics tool
to monitor the number and type of rejections as well as the corrective actions taken. When trends are identified, the
wing tactics organization will work with the airdrop support unit to rectify the problem.
(c) Items that cannot be inspected during the after-loading inspection will be annotated in the “Remarks” section of
the appropriate DD Form 1748 or overprint (for example, multiple airdrop passes from a single aircraft). An asterisk
will be placed in the applicable block(s) of the DA Form 1748–series form. The inspection items that will be rigged in-
flight are listed in the “Remarks” block. The aircraft loadmaster and AFJAI will initial the remarks block indicating
that the aircraft loadmaster is responsible for rigging and inspecting these items in-flight.
d. The before- and after-loading inspections ensure compliance with appropriate rigging instructions, FMs, TOs, and
this regulation. The airdrop support unit will furnish an up-to-date copy of the appropriate FM, TO, or NAVAIR/
NAVSEA publication (in either digital format or hard copy) to the inspectors during the inspection. The aircraft
loadmaster will also make available the applicable aircraft TO (commonly referred to as the -9).
e. Air Force unilateral training operations augment the Joint Airdrop/Air Transportability Training Program and are
essential to maintaining mission-ready, airdrop-qualified aircrew members. A unilateral airdrop training load is defined
as any airdrop load owned by the same Service that operates the aircraft and is dropped solely for the purpose of
training. These loads are low cost and may consist of ballast material, such as ammo cans. Unilateral training loads
must be rigged in accordance with the specific rigging manual. Any exceptions for unilateral training loads will be
annotated in the applicable FM, TO, or NAVAIR/NAVSEA publication. Airdrop load inspection procedures are
essentially the same as Joint operations, with the following exceptions:
(1) Individuals listed in paragraph 2–2b perform the shop final inspection.
(2) The transported force does not need to be present during the before and after-loading inspections. A signature in
the transported force signature block is not required.
(3) Air National Guard (ANG) and AF Reserve Command units, air transportation specialists (AFSC 2T2X1),
survival equipment specialists (AFSC 2A7X4), or aircraft loadmasters (AFSC 1A2X1) who have successfully com-
pleted the USAQMC&S FADLC or airdrop specialist phase of the Parachute Rigger Course may perform the before-
loading inspection as the AFJAI and sign the before-loading inspection Air Force’s inspector block. A certified AFJAI
(AFSC 1A2X1) must accomplish the after-loading inspection and sign the after-loading Air Force’s inspector block.
(4) The aircrew secondary loadmaster and the primary loadmaster, with MAJCOM approval, can accomplish the
after-loading inspection on rigged alternate method, zodiac loads only. The primary loadmaster does the loading and in-
aircraft rigging. The secondary loadmaster will sign the Air Force’s inspector block on the Joint inspection record. This
will be done only as an absolute necessity when there is no certified AFJAI available to conduct the after-loading
inspection.
(5) Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) flying units conducting training missions with special tactics
units will consider all loads as training unless identified as a real world mission or conducting operations in a forward
deployed location.
2–3. Inspection records
The Joint airdrop inspection forms listed below will be used as a guide for Joint airdrop inspections. Completion
instructions are printed on the reverse side of the forms. Each form will be filled out in triplicate (two copies for
unilateral training loads): the airdrop support unit JAI retains the first copy, the AFJAI retains the second copy, and the
aircraft loadmaster from the aircraft that performs the airdrop retains the third copy. The airdrop support unit provides
the following forms:
a. DD Form 1748 (Joint Airdrop Inspection Record (Platforms)). Complete one form for each low-velocity platform
load to be air dropped.
b. DD Form 1748–1 (Joint Airdrop Inspection Record (Containers)). Complete one set of forms for each load of
containers rigged for airdrop. Use only one form per aircraft when multiple containers will be dropped during one pass.
c. DD Forms 1748 and 1748–1. These do not outline or specify the proper inspection sequence for all loads peculiar
to special operations. Inspectors must refer to the appropriate rigging manual for the proper inspection procedures.
Annotate any deviations to set procedures in the "Remarks" section of DD Form 1748.
2–4. Disposition instructions
a. If a malfunction or incident occurs, retain the inspection form for use during the investigation or analysis. Dispose
of investigative documents in accordance with the appropriate Service directives listed in paragraph 3–2d.
b. If there are no malfunctions or incidents, dispose of the form according to appropriate Service directives. For the
AF, DD 1748-series forms will be maintained and disposed of in accordance with the AF Records and Information
Management System (https://afrims.amc.af.mil).
2–5. Exceptions
a. Door bundle loads rigged for paratroop doors or the aircraft ramp using A7A straps or A21 containers (weighing
500 pounds or less) and manually ejected/released from the aircraft, do not require a before-loading or after-loading
4
AR 59–4/OPNAVINST 4630.24D/AFJ 13–210(I)/MCO 13480.1D • 8 April 2008
inspection. The JM of the airdrop unit and the aircraft loadmaster will perform an inspection to ensure the bundle is
properly rigged for either breakaway or nonbreakaway (in accordance with FM 3–21.220), connection to aircraft
equipment, and clear route of exit.
b. All equipment and supplies airdropped from the aircraft ramp will have an inspection as required by this
regulation, using procedures approved by the MAJCOM and the USAQMC&S, ADFSD, and be integrated into basic
aircrew training.

3–2. Investigating malfunctions and incidents
a. The onsite investigation of personnel parachutes and equipment malfunctions/incidents will receive the highest
priority, secondary only to medical aid for the injured. It will supersede all other aspects of the operation, including
ground tactical play. Prompt and accurate investigation and reporting could save lives and equipment. Efficient and
effective measures must be taken without delay to document the malfunction/incident and complete the onsite
investigation. At no time will the onsite investigation interfere with any medical support required. In all situations
involving a malfunction or incident, the MO will—
(1) Immediately place the impact area off limits, post guards, and initiate an onsite investigation to determine if
possible, the causes of the malfunction/incident using the checklists in the appendix B of this regulation.
(2) Immediately notify the DZ safety team leader (DZSTL)/DZSO and the unit appointed SME.
(3) Determine whether the preliminary investigation reveals suspected or intentional acts of tampering or sabotage.
(a) If suspected or intentional acts of tampering or sabotage are present, terminate the investigation. Ensure all
evidence—including reports, findings, statements, photographs, videos, and area sketches—is released (as annotated on
the evidence log/chain of custody) to the criminal investigator(s).
(b) Ensure the military police are immediately notified by the DZSTL or DZSO.
(c) Upon arrival of the responding criminal investigation organization (for example, Criminal Investigation Divi-
sion), brief the status of the investigation and actions taken, to include whether or not a suspected or intentional act of
tampering or sabotage exists.
(d) If the criminal investigator accepts a recommendation of no tampering or sabotage, retain the evidence.
(e) If the decision is made that the physical evidence will be retained, secure it in accordance with AR 195–5 (or
Service specific security regulations) and maintain a chain of custody, per DA Form 4137 (Evidence/Property Custody
Document) (or Service specific chain of custody regulatory guidance).
(f) Secure all physical evidence and other items involved in the malfunction/incident. Some items are extremely
perishable and must be protected from the environment and/or from tampering.
b. Partial or total malfunctions/incidents during personnel parachute jumps where there are no serious injuries, the
MO will—
(1) Ensure requirements in paragraph 3–2a have been met.
(2) Investigate the malfunction/incident in accordance with appendix B.
(3) Ensure the scene is thoroughly documented using photographs and sketches.
(4) Ensure items of physical evidence that are collected are released only to the appropriate SME appointed to assist
in the investigation and members of an appointed safety investigation review board (SIRB), if applicable.
(5) Ensure the chain of custody (MO and SME) is established and the appropriate security measures for all
equipment involved in the parachute malfunction is maintained in accordance with AR 195–5 (or Service specific
security regulations).
(6) Carry out any subsequent investigations as required and limit access to the evidence and equipment (MO and
designated SME). Determine if the preliminary investigation reveals suspected or intentional acts of tampering or
sabotage, and if it does, ensure the DZSTL/DZSO immediately notifies the military police.
(7) Upon arrival of the responding criminal investigation organization, brief the status of the investigation and
actions taken. In this instance, the evidence will be released to the investigating organization. The investigative activity
will interfere as little as possible with the post jump; however, the criminal investigation will take priority.
c. For partial or total malfunctions/incidents during personnel parachute jumps where there are serious injuries or
death resulting from a parachute jump, the MO will—
(1) Ensure requirements in paragraph 3–2a have been met.
(2) Investigate the malfunction/incident in accordance with appendix B.
(3) Immediately place the impact site off limits and post guards to ensure the integrity of the accident scene. Limit
6
AR 59–4/OPNAVINST 4630.24D/AFJ 13–210(I)/MCO 13480.1D • 8 April 2008
access to the scene to the MO, the unit SME assisting the MO, the responding criminal investigating organization, the
SIRB, and medical personnel. Ensure the security of the scene does not interfere with medical support or delay
lifesaving measures.
(4) Ensure the DZSTL/DZSO notifies military/security police in the event of death.
(5) Document the scene and collect evidence as required in paragraph 3–2b.
(6) Immediately initiate an investigation prior to the investigating organization’s arrival and ensure that the scene is
not altered. If failure to immediately collect items of evidence would result in degradation or destruction, properly
document and secure that evidence. If possible, the evidence will not be disturbed until the appropriate SIRB is on the
scene.
(7) Upon arrival of the investigating organization, brief the status of the investigations on actions taken and whether
the MO believes that suspected or intentional acts of tampering or sabotage exists. If the criminal investigator accepts a
recommendation of no tampering or sabotage, the MO will retain the evidence for the SIRB.
(8) Terminate the examination and investigation if tampering or sabotage is suspected or determined. The evidence,
along with all copies of reports, findings, and statements, to include photographs, will then be released to the criminal
investigator. If the decision has been made that the physical evidence will remain with the MO, physical evidence and
security will be maintained by the personnel responsible for the chain of custody (MO and SME appointed by the
investigating safety board).
d. Airdrop load malfunctions/incidents require the MO to—
(1) Ensure requirements in paragraph 3–2a have been met.
(2) Investigate the malfunction/incident in accordance with appendix B.
(3) Ensure the scene is thoroughly documented (photographs, video, and a sketch).
Note. The MO and/or unit SME conducts/assists with any subsequent investigation as required.
e. Safety investigations may be initiated in accordance with the Joint safety memorandum of understanding among
the Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. All mishaps that meet the following criteria will be reported and
investigated in accordance with DODI 6055.7, AR 385–10, MCO P5102.1B, OPNAVINST 5102.1D, and/or AFI
91–204—
(1) Class A: Fatality, permanent total disability or mishap cost $1,000,000 or more.
(2) Class B: Permanent partial disability, accidents involving three or more personnel that are hospitalized with
inpatient care or mishap cost $200,000 to $1,000,000.
(3) Class C: A nonfatal injury that causes any loss of time from work beyond the day or shift on which it occurred
or mishap cost $20,000 to $200,000.
(4) Class D: No lost time injury but mishap cost $2,000 to $200,000.
Note. See the above Service regulations and unit safety office for reporting investigation requirements and instructions of all Class
A, B, C, and D mishaps.
3–3. Reporting malfunctions and incidents
DD Form 1748–2 (Airdrop Malfunction Report, Joint (Personnel–Cargo)) will be used to report all airdrop malfunc-
tions and incidents. The MO/aircrew initiates this report. A malfunction is defined as “the failure of an airdrop item or
component of an airdrop system to function as it was intended or designed,” whether the equipment failed because of
human error or emergency procedures used. An airdrop incident is defined as any “procedure that prevented the
successful completion of any planned airdrop operation.” Some examples of airdrop incidents include, but are not
limited to, towed jumpers (cutaway or retrieved), dual deployments of parachutes, entanglements resulting in reserve
parachute deployment, and inadvertent automatic activation device actuations. Any incident or malfunction that
happens to a parachutist, airdrop drop load, or container delivery system bundle must be reported. DD Form 1748–2
will be reviewed by a unit SME prior to submission to the USAQMC&S.
Note. Injuries related to parachute landing falls will not be reported via DD Form 1748–2 to the USAQMC&S. Services will follow
procedures in their appropriate AFI, AR, MCO, or NAVAIR/NAVSEA publications.
Chapter 4
Investigations
4–1. Investigations by the malfunction officer
a. Malfunction investigations cover two areas: personnel parachute malfunctions/incidents and airdrop load malfunc-
tions/incidents. The depth of any investigation will vary according to the severity of the malfunction/incident and
resulting injuries/loss.
b. In cases apparently not involving deliberate misconduct, or not meeting the safety review board definitions for
class A or B mishaps or incidents not involving serious injury, the MO will conduct the onsite investigation solely to
7
AR 59–4/OPNAVINST 4630.24D/AFJ 13–210(I)/MCO 13480.1D • 8 April 2008/RAR 23 June 2009
determine the cause of the malfunction or incident and actions required to prevent future occurrences. Findings will be
submitted through the ACOM/ASCC/DRU or parent unit to the USAQMC&S, ADFSD for further analysis/action.
c. In cases apparently involving deliberate misconduct, serious incident, injury, or death, or meets the requirements
of a class A or B accident or mishap, an SME will be appointed to assist in the conduct of the follow-on investigation
according to service directives and this regulation until such time as one is appointed by the investigative agency. The
investigations may include but are not limited to AR 15-6, AR 735-5, the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),
JAG Instruction 5800.7E, Naval Criminal Investigative Services/Criminal Investigation Division/Office of Special
Investigation, and the SIRB. The MO will make investigative notes, insights, reports, and physical evidence available
to these investigations. The MO will exercise great care so the government avoids compromising the rights of
personnel involved. During the investigation, the MO gathers items, information, and evidence that are sensitive in
nature. In cases when the equipment is not able to remain at the malfunction/incident site and the SIRB is not present,
the MO will conduct a component-by-component investigation on site. The MO will ensure that after the component-
by-component examination is completed, the equipment involved in the malfunction/incident is secured and accessible
to only the investigating SME. The MO will turn over all evidence to the SME and the SIRB. The MO will exercise
great care to release information to only authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis.
d. For the Navy and the United States Marine Corps, during malfunctions or incidents that meet the definition of an
on-duty class A or B mishap, the MO will preserve the mishap scene (medical treatment has priority) and ensure all
evidence is secured until the appointed SIRB arrives. An SME will be appointed from the Naval Safety Center. The
MO will photograph the mishap scene and all angles of components using a still/digital camera and/or video tape. The
MO will not disturb the evidence by taking out inversions, turns, tangles, or twists, or taking any of the components
apart. The SME assigned to the SIRB will conduct the component-by-component technical/rigger-type inspection and
analysis.
4–2. Priority of malfunction and incident investigations
The investigation of personnel parachute and equipment malfunctions/incidents will receive the highest priority,
secondary only to medical aid for the injured. It will supersede all other aspects of the operation, including any tactical
exercise planned in conjunction with the airborne operation. Prompt and accurate investigation and reporting could save
lives and equipment. Data gathered can help determine whether a system change is necessary to prevent future
occurrences. The MO should enlist as many personnel as needed to investigate for possible causes of the malfunctions.
These personnel will identify any unusual occurrences to the MO, who will take actions as directed in this regulation.
4–3. General guidance on malfunction and incident investigations
a. The MO will investigate and report all airdrop malfunctions through the appropriate DOD component to the
USAQMC&S and conduct the investigation as expeditiously as possible after the malfunction or incident to preclude
confusion of facts and loss of data. In all cases, the MO who is on location at the time of the malfunction plays a key
role in the overall investigation as a direct source of information. The MO provides his or her onsite and follow-on
investigation reports to the investigating agency. See appendix B for guidance on both onsite and follow-on investiga-
tions. This appendix is not all inclusive, and a specific investigation can disclose other items that should be checked.
b. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy units involving class A or B mishaps (see para 3-2e), off DZ drops, aircraft
airdrop systems, malfunctions, or aircraft damage will notify the appropriate service military airfield. The aviation unit
will not derig the aircraft or reprogram navigation aids used in determining the load release point unless safety of flight
is compromised. After landing, the appropriate tactics and maintenance representatives will inspect the aircraft before it
is released for subsequent flights. For missions away from home station, the command and control center having
operational control of the mission will be notified to determine the recovery airfield where the aircraft can be
inspected. If operational requirements prevent recovery and inspection by an appropriate Air Force, Marine Corps, or
Navy unit, then the aircrew will submit a detailed report to their unit of assignment to help in analysis of the
malfunction or incident. If applicable, notify the owning MAJCOM, nearest command post, or the Command and
Control Center.
4–4. Disposition of air items
All air items involved in a fatality will be secured until released by the Judge Advocate General (JAG) after
completion of the investigation and upon submission of all reports required by this regulation. At that time, the
appropriate supply officer will prepare supply documentation to remove these items from accountability. The supply
officer will attach an unsigned certificate of destruction. This certificate will list the date, time, method of destruction,
and witnesses present. Allow 30 days for processing the supply documents before setting the destruction date. When
the documentation is approved, the supply officer will destroy the air items on the preset destruction date. FM
4–20–102/Air Force Technical Order (TO) 13C7–5 and applicable NAVAIR or Marine Corps publication series may
state that the items should be burned. Other methods may be used but only those that guarantee total destruction. After
completing the destruction, the designated destruction officer signs the certificate of destruction and furnishes copies to
the appropriate supply activities and to the investigation file. The hand-receipt holder is the destruction officer.

4–5. Airdrop load malfunction categories
The MO will categorize malfunctions by the phase in which they occur and also restrict the investigations to factors
that could have caused or contributed to the malfunction/incident to conserve time and effort. Observing the malfunc-
tion/incident can normally determine the phase of the occurrence. Phases are defined as follows:
a. Extraction phase. The period of time that begins with the activation of the aerial delivery system and continues
until the extraction force transfers to recovery parachute deployment.
b. Deployment recovery phase. The period of time that begins with the transfer of force from extraction to recovery
parachute deployment and continues until load impact.
c. Release phase. This phase necessarily overlaps the deployment recovery phase, but concerns only the functioning
of the release assembly. It commences when the timer mechanism should actuate and continues until load impact when
the parachute release should occur.
Chapter 5
Report Requirements
5–1. General reporting requirements
All malfunctions, incidents or damage to air dropped equipment and/or aircraft will be reported through the command
channels of the owning unit immediately.
a. a. Air Force units will immediately report all airdrop malfunctions or incidents involving injury or death, damage

6–1. 
a. Air Force. The AFJAI must be an airdrop-qualified and current loadmaster (1A2X1), SRA (E-4) or higher, with
at least 1 year of airdrop experience. Prior experience with airdrop as a 2T2X1 or 1P0X1 may count toward the 1 year
of experience. Individuals must have completed the USAQMC&S Air Drop Load Inspector Certification Course
(ALICC) and be designated in writing by the group commander. Completion of the FADLC is highly encouraged prior
to attending ALICC. Exceptions are listed in paragraphs 6–1a(2) and (3).
(1) AFJAI qualification is not aircraft specific. Individuals who have successfully completed the USAQMC&S
ALICC are authorized to perform AFJAI duties (before- and after-load) on any aircraft. Individuals tasked to perform
AFJAI duties on unfamiliar aircraft should make every attempt to familiarize themselves with the aircraft aerial
delivery system or unique rigging procedures. This information is found in the specific aircraft TO 1C-XXX-9 series
and in applicable field manuals/technical orders and technical manuals/technical orders.
(2) Loadmasters who are not currently qualified in their respective model aircraft because of extended duties not
including flying, professional schools, or other circumstances beyond their control may continue to perform JAI
functions with concurrence of unit commander for up to 6 months from time of disqualification. Extensions beyond 6
months require MAJCOM approval. Submit waiver requests along with detailed circumstance to the following:
