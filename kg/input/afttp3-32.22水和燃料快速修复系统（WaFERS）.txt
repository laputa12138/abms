Chapter 1 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. Overview. The Water and Fuel Expedient Repair System (WaFERS) is a 
modular and scalable set of capability-based Unit Type Codes (UTCs) configured 
to enable expedient repair or recovery of mission essential water and fuel distri-
bution systems and associated infrastructure. 
 
1.1.1. Following a conventional airfield attack where the water or fuel infra-
structure becomes damaged or inoperative, the resumption of fuel supply to 
support flying operations is a top priority. Engineer forces must be prepared 
to locate and assess water or fuel system damage and unexploded explosive 
ordnance (UXO) hazards, mitigate UXO that threaten WaFERS personnel 
and/or flying operations, and repair the infrastructure sufficiently to resume 
flying operations within timelines specified by Joint Force Commanders.  
 
1.1.2. The scope of WaFERS requirements during airfield recovery will vary 
proportionally to the intensity of the attack. It could range from minor pipe 
puncture repairs to bypassing an entire pump house and manifold system to 
get fuel to a hydrant loop system or intermediate transfer tanks. It is this latter 
possibility AF engineers must be prepared to perform swiftly, adeptly and 
efficiently. In addition, high operational tempos mandate more durable and 
sustainable repairs to minimize system downtime that may negatively affect 
sortie rates. 
 
1.1.3. WaFERS are War Reserve Materiel (WRM) UTCs. The system pro-
vides the tools, equipment and consumables to repair a variety of anticipated 
damage to water and fuel systems. Vehicles will normally be postured at in-
stallations for use with the required WaFERS capability. Vehicles may be 
WRM assets or assigned to the Civil Engineer (CE) Unit as joint-use assets 
for normal day-to-day shop use. 
 
1.1.4. The manufacture’s operations manuals provide required maintenance 
instructions for the power equipment, specialized tools and general hand 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          15 
 
tools. This publication will reference these manuals in lieu of duplicating in-
structions within this publication. Use instructions and procedures within the 
manuals for scheduled inspections, operational checks, preventive mainte-
nance and repair to sustain assets while stored in WRM and for unit level 
maintenance when in use. 
 
1.1.5. The WaFERS UTCs are packaged and stored in Tricon containers. 
These containers are suitable for transport by ship, rail, truck, or airlift. All 
intermodal containers will be managed in accordance with Defense Trans-
portation Regulation 4500.9-R, Part VI. The intermodal container manage-
ment chapters of this regulation have specific requirements that govern cod-
ing, marking, inspection, re-inspection, maintenance, repair, movement re-
porting, tracking and inventory. 
 
1.2. Capability Descriptions. The system encompasses capabilities required to 
repair and recover water or fuel infrastructure at U.S. or allied airfields. Depend-
ing upon the damage, use a single UTC, or a combination of two or more, to re-
store water or fuel system operations. The modularity and scalability of WaFERS 
allows UTC selection based on the installation’s unique infrastructure and allows 
flexible repair and recovery capability. Input and output connection points for all 
components are standard DOD configuration allowing use of quick-connect type 
fittings and couplers to the maximum extent possible. Capabilities include, but are 
not limited to, pipe repair or bypass, valve/manifold repair or bypass, hydrant cap-
ping, tank patching, fuel and water pumping, and fuel filtering. The system con-
sists of capabilities as summarized below. 
 
1.2.1. Consolidated Tools and Equipment (4FWCT). This UTC consolidates, 
organizes and provides easy accessibility of consumables, general hand tools, 
special-use tools and power equipment to support expedient repair and recov-
ery of water or fuel distribution and storage systems. The assets within this 
UTC support, and prevents duplication within, the remaining WaFERS UTCs 
to accomplish repairs.  
 
1.2.2. Repair and Bypass (4FWRB). This UTC offers several capabilities to 
include repairing small and large leaks and punctures in a pipeline, fitting or 
16                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
valve; inline repair; valve replacement; and hydrant capping. The term bypass 
refers to rerouting the flow through a hose or pipe in order to bypass a dam-
aged system or to go around an area due to hazards, traffic patterns/paths, or 
congestion. When this UTC is combined with other WaFERS UTCs (such as 
the pump and filter UTCs), the capability is greatly enhanced. 
 
1.2.3. Layflat Hose (4FWLH). Use the Layflat Hose UTC to replace signifi-
cant sections of damaged pipe above grade quickly, or to bypass damaged/in-
operable infrastructure, such as a pump house. Use this UTC up to the Amer-
ican National Standards Institute (ANSI) 150 class pressures. 
 
1.2.4. Tank Patch (4FWTP). This UTC has the capability to repair a leak from 
a penetrating hole, puncture or small tear in the wall of a bulk-fuel storage 
tank. This capability has several methods of repair to include wooden plugs 
driven into the leaking hole with a hammer and the umbrella patch used on 
larger penetrations. Depending upon the chosen method, repairs are capable 
on damages between a small pinhole up to large repairs of 23 inches in diam-
eter. 
 
1.2.5. Water and Fuel Pump (4FWFP). The Water and Fuel Pump UTC con-
sists of a trailer mounted diesel engine driven pump capable of pumping liq-
uid from approximately 50 feet below grade with discharge flow of 600-gal-
lons per minute (GPM) and an outlet pressure of 150-pounds per square inch 
(PSI). This pump is capable of series (higher pressure) and parallel (addi-
tional flow rate) configurations. Approved pump engine fuels are JP-5, JP-8, 
Jet-A, kerosene and diesel fuel, potentially scavenged from the pumped flow 
to fuel the engine. A dedicated hydraulic power unit enables hydraulic tooling 
and extracting fuel from cut and cover fuel tanks with the down-hole turbine 
pump. This capability works in combination with the Fuel Filter UTC. When 
combined with the Layflat Hose UTC, use in series or parallel to meet flow 
or pressure demands of a hydrant loop or other fuel configurations. 
 
1.2.6. Fuel Filter (4FWFF). This UTC consists of a trailer mounted filter sys-
tem with two 600-GPM filter separators. The capability has numerous hose 
connection adapters to facilitate connection to Fuels Operational Readiness 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          17 
 
Capability Equipment or other systems providing lateral support. Assets in-
clude inlet strainers, eductor system to vacate one filter for quick filter 
change, spare filters and a grounding reel with rod.  
 
Note: The following tools, vehicles and equipment (assumed available within the 
in-garrison unit) are NOT provided with WaFERS, but may be required for re-
pairs:  
• 
Vapor toxicity meter 
• 
Backhoe/Excavator 
• 
Truck, ½ Ton, w/pintle hook 
• 
Individual personal protective equipment (PPE) such as hardhat, 
gloves, safety-toed boots, safety glasses, hearing protection, etc. 
 
1.3. Damage Scenarios and WaFERS Employment. Based on threat, there are 
approximately 16 types of water and fuel infrastructure damage likely to occur 
during attack within WaFERS capabilities to repair. Table 1.1 provides a sum-
mary of these scenarios and related WaFERS repair capabilities. The scenarios do 
not attempt to capture small details, but represent an assessment based solely on 
the specific threat. Because of the modular and scalable capability of WaFERS, 
technicians may select several options, depending on the situation, to optimize 
repairs. 
 
1.4. UXO Mitigation. Expedient repair and recovery of water or fuel systems 
may require an Explosive Ordnance Disposal capability to effectively identify and 
assess hazards associated with UXO prior to repairing damaged infrastructure. 
Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technicians support WaFERS by assessing the 
UXO, then remove, render safe, or detonate UXO affecting the recovery process. 
 
1.5. Manpower and Equipment. Each Water and Fuel Systems Maintenance 
Team will typically be comprised of three personnel capable of accomplishing all 
types of repairs within the scope of WaFERS. Source personnel from CE person-
nel UTCs employed at home station (fight-in-place), augmented by UTCs from 
other locations, or UTCs tasked through the Joint Operation Planning and Execu-
tion System at contingency bases.

2.1. Overview. This chapter provides safety, operation and installation procedures 
of the various special-use tools and power equipment included in this UTC. The 
consolidated general hand tools, special-use tools and power equipment are orga-
nized to make them easily accessible and allow technicians to select only what is 
needed for a repair. The Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC supports the 
other WaFERS UTCs.  
 
2.2. Contents. The following paragraphs describe the main UTC contents. At-
tachment 2 provides a complete inventory of the UTC. 
 
2.2.1. Common Hand Tools. The general hand tools include various 
wrenches, screwdrivers, sockets, hammers and other tools used for typical 
mechanic work.  
 
2.2.2. Special-Use Tools. The special-use tools include the cutter-groover, 
guillotine saw, mini-guillotine saw, alignment bar, ventilators and brick 
lights.  
 
2.2.3. Power Equipment. The power equipment consists of a hydraulic power 
unit, generator and air compressor needed to power some of the special-use 
tools.   
 
2.3. Tool Operating Procedures. Special-use tools in this UTC require operators 
to use PPE and have knowledge of additional supplemental tools to operate the 
special-use tools safely and properly. The manufacturer’s operating manual 
should be always used and adhered to when using this equipment. 
 
2.3.1. Pneumatic Reciprocating Saw. The reciprocating saw cuts steel, wood, 
building materials, fiberglass and many other materials (Figure 2.1). The tool 
is commonly found in the oil and gas industry and fire and rescue services. 
Its application to WaFERS is to cut small pipelines, typically 4-inches and 
22                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
smaller, remove jagged hole penetrations in metal, and cut any other metal 
that may require cutting. The air compressor within the UTC provides the air 
to operate the saw. 
 
Figure 2.1. Reciprocating Saw. 
 
2.3.1.1. General Safety. Wear eye protection, hearing protection, safety-
toe boots and work gloves while performing cutting operations. 
 
2.3.1.2. Operating Procedures. 
 
Step 1. Ensure the pipe, or part, to cut is secure to prevent back and 
forth movement or saw kickback. Support the loose end to prevent 
it from causing injury when it falls or springs. 
 
Step 2. Start the air compressor using procedures in the operator’s 
manual. 
 
Step 3. Lubricate the saw’s internal moving parts by squirting a few 
drops of the accompanying oil into the air hose fitting before con-
necting the air hose. 
 
Step 4. Connect the hose from the air compressor to the air caddy 
(Figure 2.2), and then connect a hose from the air caddy to the saw. 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          23 
 
Ensure the air caddy oil reservoir is at the proper level before oper-
ation. 
 
Figure 2.2. Air Caddy. 
 
 
Step 5. Cut pipe or part with the saw. While cutting, cool the cutting 
blade with lubricating oil from the UTC or soapy water to prolong 
life of the blade and allow for smoother cutting operation. 
 
Note: If the blade becomes jammed or wedged, let go of the squeeze grip, or 
depress the red emergency stop knob on top of the handgrip, and carefully free 
the blade before continuing. 
 
2.3.2. Bristle Sander. The pneumatic bristle sander tool roughs up surfaces 
and removes coatings where adhesives or epoxy materials will be used (Fig-
ure 2.3). The key to making the tool effective is the bent bristles pass over 
the stationary roller accelerator bar causing the bristles to spring back into 
place stabbing the surface with the end of each wire bristle.

2.3.5. Guillotine Saw. The portable guillotine saw (Figure 2.7) can cold cut 
6-inch through 14-inch pipe of all materials, as well as solid stock such as 
bars and rails. The saw provides cold cutting of pipe in preparation of either 
installation of couplings or machining a straight cut. The mini-guillotine Saw 
can cut 2-inch to 6-inch material. The primary use of this saw is to cut hydrant 
outlets but can be used anywhere required.  
 
Figure 2.7. Guillotine and Mini-Guillotine Saws. 
 
 
2.3.5.1. General Safety. Wear eye protection, hearing protection and

saw weighs approximately 300 pounds; utilize material handling equip-
ment when moving and/or positioning the saw.  
 
2.3.5.2. Mounting the saw. Mount the saw without the blade installed to 
avoid damaging the blade. 
 
Step 1. Turn the feed handle to retract the bow to its full upward 
travel. 
 
Step 2. Set the saw securely on the pipe at the cutting location. Place 
the saw on the supported side of the cutting location. 
 
Step 3. Wrap the mounting chain around the pipe. Pull it snug and 
insert the last link you can get into the slot in the saddle as seen in 
the Figure 2.8.  
 
Figure 2.8. Securing Mounting Chain. 
 
 
Step 4. Make sure chain tension nut is properly oriented (rounded 
part on bottom) and then tighten the chain tension nut securely to 
hold the saw in place as seen in Figure 2.9. Ensure the saddle is in 
firm contact with the pipe surface.

Figure 2.15. Adjusting the Hydraulic Motor Control Lever. 
 
 
Step 3. Slowly turn the feed handle on top of the saw to feed the 
blade into the pipe. 
 
Note: Feed the blade slowly through the crown of the pipe, where the cut begins 
and ends. Increase the speed of the cut towards the center of the pipe if desired. 
Adjust speed to achieve the smoothest cutting. While cutting, cool cutting blade 
with lubricating oil, provided with the UTC, or soapy water to prolong life of the 
blade and allow for a smoother and cooler cutting operation. 
 
Step 4. Support the unsecured end of the pipe when approaching end 
of the cut to prevent the blade from being pinched or injury to per-
sonnel. 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          35 
 
 
Step 5. When the cut is complete, position the motor control lever 
to the OFF position and fully raise the bow to the top of the saw. 
 
Step 6. Disengage and disconnect the power source from the saw. 
 
Caution: The hydraulic motor hose connections will be hot after con-
tinuous use. Use gloves when disconnecting hoses and removing the 
motor. 
 
Step 7. Loosen the mounting chain and remove the saw. 
 
2.3.6. Fuel Extraction Kit.  The fuel extraction kit can tap an existing intact 
piping system in order to drain or extract the fuel to allow necessary repairs 
to the pipeline. The kit contains a tapping machine with pneumatic driver, 
service saddles ranging in sizes from 6-inch to 12-inch, and a 2-inch corpo-
ration valve and suction tube assembly. Figure 2.16 provides an example of 
the tapping machine.

AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          37 
 
Step 2. Loosen the brake handle and collapse the square tubes to 
exposes the end of the shaft. Attach the hole-saw and arbor to the 
shaft (Figure 2.18). Hold the square end of the shaft with a crescent 
wrench and thread the cutting tool onto the shaft. DO NOT use a 
pipe wrench on the shaft.  
 
Note: Check hole-saw to ensure saw is sharp and not filled with plugs (coupons) 
from previous cuts. Replace hole-saw if required. 
 
Figure 2.18. Exposing the Adapter Shaft to Attach the Hole-saw and Arbor. 
 
 
Step 3. Retract the shaft and cutting tool back into the adapter by 
extending the square tubes to its full travel (approximately 6.5 
inches). Thread the lead nut in reverse to show the number “0” on 
the milled scale in the lead tube (Figure 2.19).

2.3.6.3. Mounting the Tapping Machine. 
 
Step 1. Thread the machine and adapter onto the 2-inch valve until 
tight (Figure 2.21). Use a pipe wrench on the adapter to tighten the 
machine and adapter onto the 2-inch valve; it may leak if left loose. 
 
Step 2. Loosen the brake handle and slowly collapse the two square 
tubes, advancing the cutting tool until it contacts the pipe wall (Fig-
ure 2.22). Avoid heavy contact with the pipe, as this may damage 
the pilot drill.

2.3.6.4. Pneumatic Driver Operating Instruction. 
 
Step 1. Start air compressor, provided with this UTC, using proce-
dures in the operator’s manual.  
 
Note: Use compressor’s pressure regulator, or the in-line pressure regulator, to 
prevent air pressure from exceeding 90 psi. 
 
Step 2. Connect hose from the air compressor to the air caddy (Fig-
ure 2.2). 
 
Step 3. Place a few drops of oil, provided with the UTC, into the air 
hose fitting to lubricate the power head’s internal components. 
 
Step 4. Attach the pneumatic power head square tube over the tap-
ping machine and engage the square drive.  
 
Step 3. Ensure power head air valve is in the OFF position and con-
nect the air hose from the air caddy to the power head. 
 
Step 4. Slowly open the power head’s air valve until the cutting bit 
begins cutting into the pipe. 
 
Note: If the air motor fails to rotate when air is applied, manually rotate the air 
motor shaft to ensure the shaft turns freely. If the power head fails, cut the fuel 
extractor hole manually using the ratchet handle over the drive socket. 
 
Step 5. Slowly turn the feed handle clockwise (avoid binding the 
blade) until it reaches the locking nuts (Figure 2.25). 
 
Note: Feed about 1/8th of a turn on the feed nut for every two revolutions of the 
hole-saw. Do not overfeed the hole-saw. 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          43

unit, or generator) to the drive motor. Remove the frame locking 
pins from the cutter/groover before operating the machine. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          61 
 
Step 2. Loosen the trip release handle and engage the trip to the op-
erating position (Figure 2.50).  
 
Figure 2.50. Trip Operating Position. 
 
 
Step 3. Turn on the power source. Operate the drive motor at a slow 
speed through one rotation to make sure the trip turns the star-wheel. 
 
Step 4. Adjust the drive motor to the desired operating speed. As the 
tool slide advances, the parting tool will begin to cut. Spray soapy 
water onto cutting surface to cool/lubricate the parting tool. Operate 
the cutter/groover until the cut is complete. 
 
Caution: Support the piece to be cutoff before reaching the end of the parting cut. 
 
Note: To reduce operating time, turn the star-wheel counter-clockwise to advance 
the combination tool slide to set the grooving tool close to the pipe surface (Fig-
ure 2.51).

Figure 2.51. Parting/Grooving Slide Adjustment. 
 
 
Step 5. Turn on the drive motor and adjust to desired speed. As the 
tool slide advances, the grooving tool will begin to cut. Spray soapy 
water onto cutting surface to cool/ lubricate the grooving tool. 
 
Step 6. Operate the cutter/groover until the combination tool slide 
grooving is complete and has advanced to the hard stop position. 
The spring-loaded trip assembly will not turn the star-wheel, which 
prevents the slide tool advancement. Operate the cutter/ groover 
through two more rotations to clean the groove; then, turn off the 
drive motor. 
 
Step 7. Turn power source off and disconnect the drive motor from 
the power source. 
 
Caution: The hydraulic drive motor hose connection will be hot after continuous 
use. Use gloves when removing the hoses and motor. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          63 
 
Step 8. Remove the drive motor from the cutter/groover. 
 
Step 9. Using a hex wrench in the star-wheel, turn the star-wheel 
clockwise to retract the slide. 
 
Step 10. Turn the jacking screws on the slides clockwise until the 
tracking wheels no longer touch the pipe surface. 
 
Step 11. Remove the trip from the stationary ring of the cut-
ter/groover. 
 
Step 12. Loosen the screws in the toe clamps. Be sure to hold the 
slide if it is at the bottom of the machine so that it does not fall when 
releasing the toe clamps. Remove the slides from the cutter/groover. 
 
Step 13. Loosen the adjustable clamping legs and remove the cut-
ter/groover from the pipe. If necessary, separate the ring halves to 
remove the cutter/groover. 
 
2.3.8.8. Splitting the Cutter/Groover Ring. To mount the cutter/groover 
on a continuous run of pipe, split the machine into halves by loosening 
the frame locking screws at the split points. 
 
Note: Before mounting the machine on the pipe, have the clamp pads configured 
for the pipe size as required. 
 
Step 1. Place machine on a secure surface with the rotating ring up.  
 
Step 2. Insert the two frame locking pins to keep the rotating and 
stationary rings together (Figure 2.52). 
 
Step 3. Using the 19 mm socket wrench, loosen nuts on the swing 
bolts in the rotating ring. Lift the bolts out of the blocks (Figure 
2.53).

Chapter 3 
 
REPAIR AND BYPASS UTC (4FWRB) 
 
3.1. Overview. This chapter provides procedures to perform expedient or semi-
permanent repair and bypass operations to mission critical water and fuel pipe-
lines, valves, manifolds, hydrant systems, and pump houses. Damage to these sys-
tems can effectively shut down operations and have a critical effect on combat 
sortie generation. Having the capability to quickly repair or bypass these systems 
is an essential capability to ensure the Air Force mission continues despite damage 
inflicted by adversaries. 
 
3.2. Description. The Repair and Bypass UTC provides expedient repair and by-
pass capability for a damaged water or fuel system pipeline, valve, manifold, hy-
drant, or pump house. Repairs include using pipe or layflat hose, valve replace-
ment, or hydrant riser capping. The Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC sup-
ports this UTC. 
 
3.3. UTC Components and Performance Capability. Repair and Bypass is the 
largest and most versatile WaFERS UTC and offers several solutions to address 
a wide range of damages. Key components include various valves; thrust and 
quick connect couplings; clamps, crosses, elbows, end caps; hose ends for cut-to-
fit; hoses with pre-installed fittings; pre-grooved aluminum pipe; reducers; and 
high-pressure stoppers. Attachment 2 lists all components of this UTC.  
 
3.4. Installation and Operating Procedures. Knowledge and understanding of 
the existing piping system will facilitate an expedient repair. The Layflat Hose 
UTC supports repairs requiring long runs with additional hose length. The general 
capabilities and procedures of the Repair and Bypass UTC have two categories: 
Line Patch Repair, and Repair and Bypass. 
 
3.5. Line Patch Repair. This UTC can repair four types of minor damage that 
may occur to a pipeline: 
 
3.5.1. Hole. A single penetration made in a pipe wall (Figure 3.1).  
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          75

3.6. Line Patch Repair Procedures. The UTC provides several options for re-
pairing different types of damages that may occur on a pipe wall or fitting. These 
damages typically include small holes similar to bullet holes and slices usually 
caused by shrapnel. Damage may occur on different diameters of straight run pipe 
or on a pipe fitting, such as an elbow or tee. A thorough understanding of the 
different damage types, as well as the available repair methods, will facilitate 
proper expedient repair methods. The decision matrix in Table 3.1 can aid in de-
termining the proper repair procedure for given scenarios. Take into account pipe 
surface preparation and UTC hardware and material quantities when selecting a 
repair method.

Table 3.1. Line Patch Decision Matrix. 
 
3.6.1. Wrap Kit. For ANSI 150 Class pipelines, use the wrap kit to repair 
holes, slices and entrance/exit holes in both straight pipe sections and fittings 
such as elbows or tees. The general procedure to perform this type of repair 
follows. 
 
Caution: When using the wrap kit, do not allow the epoxy to contact skin. Wear 
nitrile gloves when working with epoxy.

Step 1. Obtain the wrap kit from the Repair and Bypass UTC and the 
bristle sander from the Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC. Check 
the condition of the wrap kit components and ensure all parts are in-
cluded and epoxy material is in a usable form (not hardened). 
 
Step 2.  Measure and mark 4 inches from each side of the defect area. 
Place painters’ tape, or equivalent, around the pipe circumference four 
inches from edge of the damaged area. 
 
Step 3. Remove any pipe coating, rust, or debris from the entire defect 
area (inside the taped area) using pipe surface preparation tools such as 
the bristle sander (Figure 3.5). Refer to Chapter 2 for proper operation 
of the surface preparation tools and the air compressor. Clean the inside 
pipe surface around the defect area with the provided emery cloth. 
 
Step 4. Put on the provided nitrile gloves and clean the pipe using the 
provided cleaning wipes. Clean off any lint remaining with a clean brush 
or nitrile gloved hands. 
 
Figure 3.5. Pipe Surface Preparation. 
 
 
Step 5. Place a corner of the yellow fiberglass sheet over the defect and 
trace a ring on the fiberglass sheet 0.5-inch in diameter larger than the 
defect for 4-inch diameter or smaller pipe, or 1-inch in diameter larger 
than the defect for 6-inch diameter or larger pipe. 
 
80                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Step 6. Cut out the ring traced on the fiberglass sheet with scissors.  
 
Step 7. Cut a small slit into the center of the fiberglass patch.  Place a flat 
washer onto the provided retaining bolt and insert the bolt with washer 
into the patch (Figure 3.6).  
 
Figure 3.6. Fiberglass Patch with Retaining Bolt. 
 
 
Step 9. Test patch size by carefully folding the patch and inserting into 
the pipe while being careful not to drop the patch or contaminate with 
fuel, water or other debris. 
 
Step 10. Remove patch from the pipe and sand the patch surface where 
the patch will contact the pipe surface. 
 
Step 11. Mix equal parts of epoxy. Immediately stir the two-part epoxy 
with a mixing stick until it is uniformly gray. 
 
Step 12. Install patch in the pipe leaving room to apply the epoxy on 
inside pipe surface and the patch (Figure 3.7).  
 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          81 
 
Figure 3.7. Patch Installed in Pipe. 
 
 
Step 13. Apply mixed epoxy to the rough side of the patch with the mix-
ing stick and apply the epoxy around the inside edge of the defect. 
 
Step 14. Pull up on the patch and rotate the patch allowing the epoxy to 
spread on the entire patch and pipe surface.  
 
Step 15. While holding the patch in place with the retaining bolt, apply 
the remaining mixed epoxy into the defect area, filling the void around 
the bolt and spreading the epoxy outward, away from the defect area 
(Figure 3.8). 
 
82                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Figure 3.8. Void Filled around Bolt. 
 
 
Step 16. Place repair bridge over the retaining bolt and repair area mak-
ing sure the bridge feet contact the pipe, not the defect area or epoxy. 
Lock retaining bolt into the repair bridge with the provided wing nut. 
 
Note: The wing nut does not need to be tight, just thread the wing nut until it 
contacts the bridge. Overtightening will pull the patch into the defect area and 
separate the patch surface from the pipe surface. 
 
Step 17. Let epoxy set for approximately five minutes. After setting, re-
move the wing nut and repair bridge. Cut the retaining bolt at the repair 
surface and lightly sand the epxoy surface (Figure 3.9). Then, clean with 
provided cleaning wipes. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          83 
 
Figure 3.9. Epoxy Set and Retaining Bolt Cut. 
 
 
Step 18. Open wrap packaging. If wrap feels hard to the touch, discard 
and use a different package. 
 
Step 19. Submerge roll of wrap in water and let soak for roughly 30 sec-
onds. 
 
Step 20. Remove and unroll. Starting in center of repair area, place start 
of roll on the pipe surface and wrap over defect area. Two people tightly 
wrap the pipe overlapping each wrap by half the width of the wrap (Fig-
ure 3.10). Spray water during application of the wrap to keep material 
wet. 
 
Step 21. Continue wrapping pipe until reaching end of prepared surface. 
Make a full wrap on the end and continue wrapping back towards the 
84                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
other end of the repair area overlapping each wrap by half the width of 
the wrap. 
 
Step 22. Repeat this process until applying three total wraps on repair 
area. If repair is longer than 12 inches, add one wrap over entire repair 
for every additional four inches. 
 
Figure 3.10. Applying Wrap. 
 
 
Step 23. Using the compression film, perform same wrapping procedures 
starting where the wrap was completed and work in opposite direction 
as the wrapping was installed (Figure 3.11).  
 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          85 
 
Figure 3.11. Applying the Compression Wrap. 
 
 
Step 24. Wrap the pipe twice with the compression film and perforate 
(Figure 3.12). 
 
Figure 3.12. Perforating Compression Film. 
 
 
Step 25. Wait 30 minutes for the completed repair (Figure 3.13) to cure 
before pressurizing the pipe. 
 
86                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Figure 3.13. Completed Wrap Repair. 
 
 
Step 26. After repair is set (hard/dry to the touch), begin fueling opera-
tions. Continuously monitor repair for leaks as the system pressure in-
creases.  
 
Step 27. If minor leaks occur, stop fueling operation and remove the wrap 
and plastic seal. Check surface conditions, re-surface pipe and install a 
new wrap repair following steps above.  
 
3.6.2. Wood Plugs. For ANSI 150 Class pipelines, use wood plugs to repair 
holes up to five inches in diameter on straight pipe sections, or in some cases 
the straight section of large fittings if size allows. The general procedure to 
perform this repair follows. 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          87 
 
 
Step 1. Obtain wood plugs (Figure 3.14) in the appropriate size, and 
mallet from the Repair and Bypass UTC. Obtain the 3-pound sledgeham-
mer and water bucket from the Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC.  
 
Figure 3.14. Wood Plugs. 
 
 
Step 2. Fill bucket with water and soak wood plugs for approximately 30 
minutes. 
 
Step 3. While plugs are soaking, remove any burrs or protrusions on the 
edges of the damage with a file.   
 
Note: Coat wood plugs with epoxy from the wrap kit to ensure fuel does not soak 
into the wood plug. 
 
Step 4. Insert appropriately sized wood plug into hole and use the mallet 
or sledgehammer to secure the plug (Figure 3.15). Drive the wood plug 
into the hole until the leak is sealed. 
 
88                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Figure 3.15. Inserting a Wood Plug into Hole. 
 
 
Note: Use ratchet straps from the Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC to 
strap the plug into the pipe after installation to improve holding strength (Figure 
3.16). 
 
Figure 3.16. Ratchet Strap Increasing Holding Strength of Wood Plugs. 
 
 
Step 5. Begin fueling operations and continuously monitor repair for 
leaks as the system pressure increases. If minor leaks occur, place a con-
tainer underneath repaired pipe and monitor for increased leakage.  
 
3.6.3. Clamp Repair. For ANSI 150 Class pipelines, use the clamp repair to 
repair holes up to three-quarters inch on straight pipe sections, or in some 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          89 
 
cases the straight section of large fittings, if size allows. The general proce-
dure to perform this repair follows: 
 
Step 1. Obtain clamp (Figure 3.17) in appropriate pipe size from the 
Repair and Bypass UTC and necessary tools required for the specific job 
from the Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC.  
 
Figure 3.17. Various Size Clamps. 
 
 
Step 2. Using surface preparation tools from the Consolidated Tools and 
Equipment UTC, remove all coating, rust and scale from the pipe surface 
around the defect.   
 
Step 3. Adjust pilot pin so it protrudes one quarter-inch beyond packing 
cone. Adjust force screw until the tip of packing cone is flush with inside 
surface of the clamp (Figure 3.18). 
90                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
 
Figure 3.18. Clamp Diagram. 
 
 
Step 4. Open clamp to fit around the pipe and position near the hole to 
repair. 
 
Step 5. Use the pilot pin to locate the hole and position the clamp. 
 
Step 6. Hold clamp firmly in position until the draw-bolt and thrust nuts 
are hand tightened. 
 
Step 7. Tighten draw-bolt to the specified torque value as shown in Table 
3.2. 
 
Table 3.2. Draw-bolt Torque Specifications. 
Draw Bolt Size (in.) 
Torque (ft-lbs.) 
Torque (Nm) 
1/2 – 13 
25 – 35 
34 – 47  
5/8 – 11  
50 – 60  
68 – 81  
 
Step 8. Remove the pilot pin (Figure 3.19). Be aware if the line is pres-
surized the pin may become a projectile. 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          91 
 
Figure 3.19. Removing the Pilot Pin. 
 
 
Step 9. Tighten the force screw until the hole is sealed. The pilot pinhole 
will collapse on itself while tightening the force screw. 
 
Step 10. Begin fueling operations and continuously monitor repair for 
leaks as the system pressure increases. If minor leaks occur, tighten the 
force screw again until the leak stops. If the leak will not stop, discon-
tinue fueling operations and remove the clamp. Check the hole for irreg-
ularities, file down if necessary, and re-install the clamp as described 
above. 
 
5.4.4. Universal Clamp Coupling. For ANSI 150 Class pipelines, use the uni-
versal clamp coupling to repair holes, slices, or entrance/exit holes in straight 
pipe sections. The general procedure to perform this repair follows. 
 
Step 1. Obtain the appropriately sized universal clamp coupling (Figure 
3.20) from the Repair and Bypass UTC and the necessary tools required 
for the specific job from the Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC.  
 
92                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Figure 3.20. Universal Clamp Coupling. 
 
 
Step 2. With surface preparation tools from the Consolidated Tools and 
Equipment UTC, clean and scrape the damaged pipe section. Remove 
any scale, pipe wrap, coating, debris or dirt that may interfere with the 
gasket sealing.   
 
Step 3. Inspect pipe for integrity, size, outside diameter, and surface ir-
regularities. Confirm the diameter of the repair clamp.   
 
Step 4. Verify the damage does not exceed the width of the clamp. Mark 
width of clamp on the pipe to help center the clamp during installation.  
 
Step 5. Lubricate pipe and clamp gasket with soapy water. DO NOT USE 
OIL BASED PIPE LUBRICANTS. 
 
Step 6. Place clamp over the damaged area and hand-tighten bolts to hold 
clamp in place.  
 
Step 7. Tighten bolts (5/8-inch bolts to 70 ft-lbs and 3/4-inch bolts to 90 
ft-lbs) evenly with the torque wrench. 
 
Step 8. Begin fueling operations and continuously monitor the repair for 
leaks as the system pressure increases. Tighten bolts if minor leaks occur. 
If leaks persist, an irregularity on the pipe surface may require additional

surface preparation or the clamp position requires adjustment to correct 
the issue. 
 
Step 9. Continue to monitor repair for leaks. 
 
3.7. Bypass Repair. After an attack or natural disaster, it is highly possible a sec-
tion of fuel system piping would be damaged or destroyed and would need to be 
placed back in service as quickly as possible. In certain circumstances, UXO or 
other hazardous conditions may prevent reinstalling the pipe in the same location. 
The Repair and Bypass UTC provides the capability to redirect fuel around the 
hazardous areas and then reconnect into intact piping downstream (Figure 3.21). 
To minimize repair time, simultaneously perform many of the following steps 
where applicable. The following procedures are for 6-inch through 12-inch pipe-
line. 
 
Figure 3.21. Typical Bypass Repair. 
 
 
3.7.1. Safety. Adhere to the following safety precautions when bypassing 
UXO or other hazardous conditions. A vapor toxicity monitor is not included 
in WaFERS. Obtain from shop equipment and bring to work site. 
 
94                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
3.7.1.1. Safety hazards such as UXO and explosive fuel vapors may ex-
ist. No one shall enter work area until directed by the Team Chief and 
LEL is below 1%.  
 
3.7.1.2. Wires, airlines and hoses present tripping hazards. Be aware of 
these hazards or serious injury to personnel may happen. 
 
3.7.1.3. Personnel will not enter a work area, and will leave the work 
area, when LEL is above 1%. LEL greater than 1% presents a breathing 
hazard. 
 
3.7.1.4. Monitor LEL until repair is complete. Toxic fuel vapors could 
cause serious injury to personnel. Position vapor toxicity monitor sam-
pling hose end at lowest point in work area. Set to ALARM position. 
 
3.7.1.5. If LEL goes above 1% and/or alarm sounds, evacuate work area 
and start ventilator. Reenter work area when LEL is below 1%. 
 
3.7.2. Operating Procedures. 
 
Step 1. Expose a minimum of 20 inches of undamaged pipe that is free 
of debris, earth and obstructions to position tools and equipment for re-
pair.  
 
Step 2. Remove coating material from pipe using the pipe prep tool (par-
agraph 2.3.7) or bristle sander (paragraph 2.3.2). For yellow jacket 
coating, use a linoleum knife to remove the polyethylene outer layer and 
use the drawknife to remove heavy adhesive. Use mineral spirits to clean 
exposed metal as needed. Find knives and mineral spirits in the Consol-
idated Tools and Equipment UTC. 
 
Note: The cutter/groover, guillotine pipe saw and the thrust couplings can typi-
cally handle hard surface coatings such as Fusion-Bonded Epoxy or paint if the 
surface is intact. Remove damaged coating to bare metal if it causes misalignment 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          95 
 
while mounting equipment. Remove soft coatings such as insulation and lagging 
prior to repairs. 
 
Note: Remove approximately nine inches of coating to mount the cutter/groover. 
Remove 12 inches of coating to mount the guillotine pipe saw. 
 
Step 3. Visually inspect pipeline. Select and mark cut locations on both 
sides of damage where pipeline appears to be round and straight. 
 
Step 4. Remove pipe coating and install ground clamp on exposed pipe. 
 
Step 5. If necessary, drain pipeline of fuel using the fuel extraction kit 
(paragraph 2.3.6). 
 
Step 6. Use the cutter/groover to cut and install a groove on the pipes. If 
pipe stresses are a concern, use the guillotine pipe saw to first sever the 
pipe, and then use the cutter/groover to make the groove. Refer to Chap-
ter 2 for tool operating procedures.  
 
Step 7. Use rags to clean and remove debris from inside and outside the 
pipe. 
 
Caution: Cut edges are extremely sharp and may have burrs. Use a hand file to 
smooth edges if necessary. 
 
Step 8. Lay material out for the new bypass line. Use elbows and hard 
hoses to bring bypass line out of the hazardous area. Use layflat hose to 
reconnect the line. Provide enough room for fittings, valves, reducers, 
pipes and hoses as needed. 
 
Note: Multiple hard hoses may be required to connect the layflat hose safely to 
the prepared pipe. Assemble hard hoses outside the crater, then, if available, use 
the excavation equipment to put assembled hoses into the crater to make the pipe 
connection.   
 
96                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Note: Avoid running bypass in high traffic areas unless properly bridged.  
 
Step 9. Cut Layflat hose to fit the repair, install the hose barb and install 
hose-clamping ring with bonding according to the procedures described 
in Chapter 4.  
 
Note: Be aware layflat hoses may straighten when pressurized and may move 
until reaching a settling point. Remove any debris, equipment and tools from im-
mediate vicinity of layflat hose before pressurizing to prevent damage. 
 
Step 10. Assemble the bypass line between cut ends of the pipe using 
grooved couplings. Tighten the grooved coupling bolts until the cou-
pling’s end surfaces meet. 
 
Note: If grooved couplings run short, use thrust couplings (capable of installing 
on grooved pipe ends) as a replacement. Table 3.3 identifies torque requirements 
for the thrust couplings.

3.7.3. Test Repair. Do not stand within 50 feet of the repair when being pres-
surized. If repair fails, serious injury to personnel could result. 
 
Step 1. Notify the CE Unit Control Center (UCC) of repair completion 
and coordinate pressure test. 
 
Step 2. Pressurize the pipeline. Stop fuel flow immediately if the repair 
fails or leaks a steady flow of fuel. 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          97 
 
 
Step 3. Report any leakage to the CE UCC and request further instruc-
tion. 
 
Note: If repair leaks, the CE UCC will determine if further action is required. 
 
3.8. Bypass a Damaged Manifold. Utilize the Repair and Bypass UTC to con-
tinue fueling operations as quickly as possible after damage to, or destruction of, 
a piping manifold system (Figure 3.22). The following procedures cover repairs 
for 6-inch through 12-inch pipelines. To minimize repair time, perform many 
steps of the following procedures simultaneously. Follow steps shown in para-
graph 3.7.2 for each pipeline in the manifold system that requires repair. Expect 
installation of several bypasses to return the manifold back to operation.  
 
Figure 3.22. Typical Pump House Manifold. 
 
 
Note: Pay particular attention to each bypass layout. Organize lines to prevent 
tangling, overlaying, or interfering with other bypasses during pressurization. 
98                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
 
Note: In certain circumstances, a main line may require branching into multiple 
outlet lines. Utilize grooved tees, crosses, reducers and elbows as needed to con-
figure the pipe layout accordingly (Figure 3.23). Install grooved valves where 
necessary to control flow operations.  
 
3.9. Bypass Damaged Pump House. Use this UTC in combination with the Wa-
ter and Fuel Pump UTC and the Fuel Filter UTC to bypass a damaged or destroyed 
pump house and re-establish pumping capabilities (Figure 3.24).  
 
3.9.1. Use the following general procedures to re-route fuel around a dam-
aged or destroyed pump house. Reconnect to intact piping downstream with 
a pump and filter. The following procedures cover 6-inch through 12-inch 
pipelines. To minimize repair time, perform many steps in the following pro-
cedures simultaneously. 
 
Figure 3.23. Multiple Bypass Lines and Branch Lines Example. 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          99 
 
Figure 3.24. Typical Connected Fuel Pump and Fuel Filter. 
 
 
3.9.2. Follow steps shown in paragraph 3.7.2 to install the bypass line 
around the damaged pump house. Plan to connect the fuel pump and fuel 
filter at a suitable location in the line. Refer to Chapter 5 for proper fuel 
pump setup and operation. Refer to Chapter 6 for proper fuel filter setup and 
operation.  
 
3.9.3. Hard hoses are required for the pump suction side. Use layflat hoses 
for the discharge side. 
 
3.9.4. The fuel pump and fuel filter can be set up for 4-inch or 6-inch connec-
tions. If required, utilize reducer fittings to match. 
 
3.10. Inline Repair. This repair replaces a damaged section of pipe with hard 
pipes or layflat hoses. The following procedures cover 6-inch through 12-inch 
pipelines. To minimize repair time, perform many steps in the following proce-
dures simultaneously.  
 
3.10.1. Safety. Adhere to the following safety precautions when performing 
an inline repair. 
100                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
 
3.10.1.1. No one shall enter the work area until directed by the Team 
Chief and the LEL is below 1%. Safety hazards such as UXO and explo-
sive fuel vapors may exist. 
 
3.10.1.2. Wires, airlines and hoses present tripping hazards. Failure to 
exercise caution could cause serious injury to personnel. 
 
3.10.1.3. Personnel will not enter a work area, or will leave a work area, 
when the LEL is above 1%. LEL greater than 1% will present a breathing 
hazard. 
 
3.10.1.4. Monitor LEL until repair is complete. Toxic fuel vapors may 
cause serious injury to personnel. 
 
3.10.1.5. Position vapor toxicity monitor sampling hose end at lowest 
point in the work area. Set to ALARM position. 
 
Note: A vapor toxicity monitor is not included with WaFERS. Obtain from shop 
equipment and bring to work site. 
 
3.10.1.6. If LEL goes above 1% and/or alarm sounds, evacuate work 
area and start ventilator. 
 
3.10.1.7. Reenter crater when LEL is below 1%. 
 
3.10.2. Inline Repair Procedures with Layflat Hose. Make typical inline re-
pairs using a grooved coupling on one end and a thrust coupling on the other. 
This allows simultaneous cuts using the cutter/groover and guillotine saw, as 
well as allowing for small clearance/fit issues on the thrust coupling side 
(Figure 3.25). 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          101 
 
Figure 3.25. Typical Inline Repair with Hose. 
 
 
3.10.2.1. Operating Procedures. 
 
Step 1. Expose a minimum of 20 inches of undamaged pipeline. En-
sure pipe is clear of debris, earth, and obstructions to allow position-
ing of repair tools and equipment. 
 
Step 2. To remove typical pipe coating material, see procedures in 
paragraph 2.3.7 for pipe prep tool, or paragraph 2.3.2 for bristle 
sander instructions. For yellow jacket coating, use a linoleum knife 
to remove the polyethylene outer layer and use the drawknife to re-
move the heavy adhesive. Use mineral spirits to clean exposed metal 
as needed. Locate knives and mineral spirits in Consolidated Tools 
and Equipment UTC. 
 
Note: The cutter/groover, guillotine pipe saw, and the thrust couplings can typi-
cally handle hard surface coatings such as Fusion Bonded Epoxy, or paint, if the 
surface is intact. Remove damaged coating to bare metal if it causes misalignment 
while mounting equipment. Remove soft coatings such as insulation and lagging 
prior to making repairs. 
 
Note: Remove approximately nine inches of coating to mount the cutter/groover. 
For the guillotine pipe saw, remove 12 inches of coating for mounting.

Step 3. Visually inspect pipeline. Select and mark cut locations on 
both sides of the damage, where the pipeline appears to be straight 
and round. 
 
Note: Minimum distance between the ends of the cut pipes should be no less than 
24 inches. Misaligned pipe ends may require a slightly longer hose. Maximum 
repair length is dependent upon the amount of hose available. 
 
Step 4. Install ground clamp.  
 
Step 5. Drain fuel from pipeline into a suitable tank/container; use 
the fuel extraction kit if necessary. Refer to paragraph 2.3.6 for 
operating procedures. 
 
Step 6. Cut pipeline using the guillotine pipe saw or the cut-
ter/groover. Use thrust couplings for guillotine pipe saw cuts and 
grooved couplings for cutter/groover cuts. Refer to Chapter 2 for 
operating procedures of both tools.  
 
Step 7. Use rags to clean and remove debris from inside and outside 
pipeline. 
 
Caution: Cut edges are extremely sharp and may have burrs. Use a hand file to 
smooth edges if necessary. 
 
Step 8. Measure distance between the cut ends. 
 
Step 9. Cut the layflat hose to fit the length measured in Step 8, and 
then install the hose barb and hose clamping ring with bonding ac-
cording to procedures described in Chapter 4. Repeat for other end 
of hose if necessary. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          103 
 
Step 10. Assemble the pipeline repair section with layflat hose be-
tween the cut ends of the pipe. Use thrust couplings, grooved cou-
plings, or a combination of both to attach the hose to the pipe. Table 
3.3 identifies torque requirements for the thrust couplings. Tighten 
the grooved coupling bolts until the coupling surfaces meet. 
 
Note: Both ends of the layflat hose will have grooved ends. Use the thrust cou-
pling on a grooved pipe end if necessary. 
 
Note: Recommend NOT using an inline repair with layflat hose in areas requiring 
backfill.  
 
Step 11. Inform the CE UCC that the repair is complete and coordi-
nate pressure test. 
 
Warning: Do not stand within 50 feet when pressurizing a repair. If the repair 
fails, serious injury to personnel could result. 
 
Step 12. Pressurize the pipeline. Stop fuel flow immediately if repair 
fails or leaks a steady flow of fuel. 
 
Step 13. Report any leakage to the CE UCC and request further in-
struction. 
 
Note: If repair is leaking, the UCC will determine if further action is required. 
 
3.10.3. Inline Repair Procedures with Aluminum Pipe. The Repair and By-
pass UTC contains 8-inch and 10-inch aluminum pipe for inline pipe repair. 
This UTC also contains 6-inch by 8-inch reducers and 10-inch by 12-inch 
reducers. With these components, repairs can be made on 6-inch through 12-
inch pipeline (Figure 3.26). To minimize repair time, perform many steps in 
the following procedures simultaneously. Typically, make inline repairs us-
ing a grooved coupling on one end and a thrust coupling on the other. This 
allows cutting with both the cutter/groover and the guillotine saw simultane-
ously and tolerates small clearance/fit issues on the thrust coupling side. 
104                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
 
Figure 3.26. Typical Inline Repair with Aluminum Pipe. 
 
 
3.10.3.1. Operating Procedures. 
 
Step 1. Expose a minimum of 20 inches of undamaged pipeline. En-
sure pipe is clear of debris, earth, and obstructions to allow position-
ing of repair tools and equipment. 
 
Step 2. Remove coating material from pipe; see procedures in par-
agraph 2.3.7 for pipe prep tool, or paragraph 2.3.2 for the bristle 
sander instructions. For yellow jacket coating, use a linoleum knife 
to remove the polyethylene outer layer and use the drawknife to re-
move the heavy adhesive. Use mineral spirits to clean the exposed 
metal as needed. Locate the knives and mineral spirits in the Con-
solidated Tools and Equipment UTC. 
 
Note: Use the cutter/groover, guillotine pipe saw and the thrust couplings on hard 
surface coatings, such as Fusion Bonded Epoxy or paint, if the surface is intact. 
Remove damaged coating to bare metal if misalignment occurs when mounting 
equipment. Always remove soft coatings, such as insulation and lagging, prior to 
making repairs. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          105 
 
Note: Remove approximately nine inches of coating to mount the cutter/groover. 
For the guillotine pipe saw, remove 12 inches of coating to mount equipment. 
 
Step 3. Visually inspect pipeline and select/mark cut locations where 
pipeline appears to be round and straight on both sides of damage. 
 
Note: if pipe is not 8 inches in diameter, account for the additional space required 
to accommodate the necessary reducer fittings. 
 
Note: Minimum distance between pipe ends is 12 inches. Distances less than 12 
inches increases the difficulty when using the cutter/groover or guillotine saw. 
Combine the 7-foot sections of aluminum pipe for repairs longer than seven feet. 
Make distance between cuts divisible by seven, if possible, plus the length re-
quired for reducers, to minimize cutting and expedite the repair. 
 
Step 4. Measure distance between selected cut locations.  
 
Step 5. Install ground clamp. 
 
Step 6. If necessary, drain pipeline of fuel using the fuel extraction 
kit. Refer to paragraph 2.3.6 for operating procedures. 
 
Step 7. Cut pipeline using the guillotine pipe saw or the cut-
ter/groover. Use thrust couplings for guillotine pipe saw cuts, and 
use grooved couplings for cutter/groover cuts. Refer to Chapter 2 
for operating procedures of both tools.  
 
Step 8. Use rags to clean and remove debris from inside and outside 
pipe adjacent to the cuts. 
 
Caution: Cut edges are extremely sharp and may have burrs. Use a hand file to 
smooth edges if necessary. 
 
Step 9. Cut aluminum pipe to the required length. 
 
106                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Note: The supplied aluminum pipes have a pre-cut groove at each end. Mount the 
pipe on the pipe stand and use the guillotine saw to cut the pipe at the proper 
length. When cut is complete, the pipe will have one grooved end and one plain 
end. 
 
Note: If the pipe length required is more than the supplied 6-foot 8-inch section, 
multiple sections can be combined using grooved couplings and then cut to fit. 
 
Step 10. Assemble repair section between the cut ends of the pipe. 
Use a grooved coupling to connect the grooved end to the pipe pre-
viously cut by the cutter/groover. Use a thrust coupling to connect 
the plain end to the pipe previously cut by the guillotine saw. If nec-
essary, use a thrust coupling on the grooved pipe end. Table 3.3 
identifies the torque requirements for the thrust couplings. Tighten 
the grooved coupling bolts until the coupling’s surfaces meet. 
 
Step 11. Notify the CE UCC of repair completion and coordinate 
pressure test. 
 
Warning: Do not stand within 50 feet when initially pressurizing a repair. Other-
wise, serious injury to personnel could result if the repair fails. 
 
Step 12. Have the pipeline pressurized. Stop fuel flow immediately 
if the repair fails or leaks a steady flow of fuel. Report any leakage 
to the CE UCC and request further instruction. 
 
Step 13. If repair is successful, backfill repaired pipeline. 
 
Warning: Adequately support pipe section(s) with bedding or fill material prior 
to backfilling. Failure to support the repaired pipeline could result in a cata-
strophic failure of the repair. 
 
3.11. Cap Repair of Damaged Hydrant Valve. A destroyed aircraft refueling 
hydrant valve may require valve removal, and then plugging the standpipe to al-
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          107 
 
low the intact sections of the hydrant loop to continue operating. Use this capa-
bility to make two 4-inch and two 6-inch hydrant cap repairs. 
 
Warning: Valve pit areas are normally classified as confined space entries and 
require specialized procedures and equipment to safely work in. Refer to AFMAN 
91-203, Air Force Occupational Safety, Fire, and Health Standards for confined 
space entry requirements before any personnel attempt entry. Utilize the tripod, 
winch, and safety harness for safe access into and emergency egress out of the 
valve pit (Figure 3.27). 
 
Figure 3.27. Safely Accessing Valve Pit. 
 
 
3.11.1. Operating Procedures. 
 
Step 1. Assess the damaged area. Identify hydrant valves that require 
removal and capping to maintain system integrity.  
 
108                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Step 2. Secure the damaged hydrant valve to a backhoe with lifting straps 
or other material handling equipment to prepare for removal. If accessi-
ble, stuff a rag in the pipe to prevent metal shavings and other debris 
from entering the system. 
 
Step 3. Use the reciprocating saw, or the mini guillotine saw, to cut the 
standpipe below the damaged hydrant valve. Keep saw blades lubricated 
during cutting. See paragraph 2.3.1 for the reciprocating saw, and par-
agraph 2.3.5 for the mini guillotine saw, operating procedures. 
 
Step 4. Lift damaged hydrant valve out of the valve pit and properly dis-
card (Figure 3.28).  
 
Figure 3.28. Removing Damaged Hydrant from Valve Pit. 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          109 
 
Step 5. Check remaining pipe stub for surface conditions and dents (Fig-
ure 3.29). Remove burrs or jagged edges. If necessary, cut pipe at a 
lower height for better pipe conditions. Use the mini guillotine saw or 
reciprocating saw to cut the pipe. See Chapter 2 for saw operating pro-
cedures. Remove the rag previously placed inside the pipe and clean out 
any excess metal shavings inside the pipe.  
 
Step 6. Install high-pressure pipe plug (Figure 3.30) and tighten with the 
pneumatic or manual impact wrench. Use the vent valve on the plug to 
release any trapped air within the system during system pressurization. 
 
Warning: Ensure proper installation and torque of the plug; otherwise, this repair 
could become a projectile during system pressurization and surge.

Step 7. Notify the CE UCC of repair completion and coordinate a pres-
sure test. 
 
Warning: Do not stand within 50 feet of repair during pressurization. If the repair 
fails, serious injury to personnel could result. 
 
Step 8. Have the pipeline pressurized. Stop fuel flow immediately if the 
repair fails or leaks a steady flow of fuel. Report any leakage to the CE 
UCC and request further instruction. 
 
Note: If leaks are present, the CE UCC will determine if further action is required. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          111 
 
3.12. Special Considerations.  
 
3.12.1. Standard material handling equipment, obtained from the base civil 
engineer shops or rented locally, will be required to move or position equip-
ment and material.  
 
3.12.2. Ventilation equipment may be required for confined space areas and 
is available in the Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC. 
 
3.12.3. Site preparation equipment is situationally dependent on items such 
as lighting and electrical generators, which are available in the Consolidated 
Tools and Equipment UTC. 
 
3.12.4. Properly ground and/or bond all operating electrical equipment. Ref-
erence the Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC for equipment specifica-
tions. 
 
3.12.5. Ensure personnel use appropriate PPE when performing repairs. 
 
3.12.6. Repairs require cutting metal pipes and may result in metal shavings 
remaining in the system, which may require flushing specific systems.  
 
3.12.7. Atmospheric monitoring equipment is NOT contained in WaFERS. 
Utilize shop equipment for this function. 
 
3.13. After Repair Actions. Check connections and hoses for leaks. Ensure hoses 
are not twisted and remain clear of sharp objects. Finally, check the overall con-
dition of hoses and pipes. 
 
3.14. Periodic Inspection. Perform frequent inspections of hoses, pipes and con-
nections and monitor for leaks. 
 
3.15. Reconstitution of Consumables. Immediately reorder all items consumed

LAYFLAT HOSE UTC (4FWLH) 
 
4.1. Overview. The Layflat Hose UTC is a collection of hoses, couplings and 
clamps to replace above grade pipe (Figure 4.1). Layflat hose is primarily a sup-
plemental capability that provides extra hose required for long runs such as by-
passing a pump house to get fuel to a hydrant system. The UTC contains 50-foot 
lengths of 6-inch, 8-inch and 10-inch diameter hoses and couplings to address the 
most common pipe sizes across the installation enterprise. Each hose has prein-
stalled end fittings to expedite installation. Also, use layflat hose for cut-to-length 
inline repairs. Find a full list of UTC components in Attachment 2. The Consol-
idated Tools and Equipment UTC support this UTC. 
 
Figure 4.1. Assembling Layflat Hose. 
 
 
Note: One 50-foot x 12-inch layflat hose is available in the Repair and Bypass 
UTC (4FWRB). Find additional couplings and fittings in the Repair and Bypass 
UTC.

4.2. Description. Use this UTC to replace long pipe runs and provide additional 
layflat hose with connectors to support bypass repair capabilities for a damaged 
water or fuel system pipeline, valve, manifold, hydrant, pump house, or hazardous 
area. Use layflat hoses to: 
 
4.2.1. Temporarily replacing damaged pipe in above grade applications. 
 
4.2.2. Bypass damaged areas with significant sections of above-grade pipe. 
 
4.2.3. Create custom repair lengths with “cut-to-size” capability. 
 
4.2.4 Repair systems with piping diameters of 6-inch, 8-inch and 10-inch. 
 
4.2.5 Replace piping in pressurized systems as listed in Table 4.1. 
 
4.3. General Safety. Be aware of hazardous conditions when installing layflat 
hose and adhere to the following safety guidelines. 
 
4.3.1. Use of knives and shears pose slicing and cutting hazards.  
 
4.3.2. Snap-on hose fittings pose pinching and crushing hazards.  
 
4.3.3. Stand clear of hose while pressurizing.  
 
4.3.4. When possible, avoid placing layflat hose across pedestrian walkways; 
an inflated hose poses an unexpected trip hazard.  
 
4.3.5. Do not bury layflat hose. 
 
4.3.6. Do not place hose in areas where vehicle traffic is required to pass over 
the hose unless a bridge is protecting the hose. 
 
4.3.7. Do not use layflat hose in pump suction applications.

Note: Find 12-inch hose in the Repair and Bypass UTC. 
 
Note: Layflat fuel hose has small conductive copper wires molded within to pro-
vide a method to bond both ends of the hose electrically. 
 
Note: The following procedure assumes a preinstalled, electrically bonded to at 
least one bond wire, hose end. If installation of both ends is required, add six extra 
inches to the required hose length, three inches for each end. 
 
Step 1. Measure the required length of hose and add three inches. Cut the 
hose squarely to this length. 
 
Step 2. Locate the electrical bonding wire electrically connected to the in-
stalled end and mark its location. Draw another line squarely 3 inches from 
the hose cut end (Figure 4.2). 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          115 
 
Note: If multiple bonding wires are present, use the same wire at each end to 
ensure electrical connection; use an electrical continuity meter to verify. Bonding 
wires typically run parallel with the hose length. 
 
Step 3. Expose three inches of the electrical bonding wire from the hose wall.  
 
Figure 4.2. Squarely Marking the Layflat Hose. 
 
 
Step 4. Cut off the previously marked three inches of hose using care not to 
cut off the bonding wire. The outcome should look like (Figure 4.3).

Figure 4.3. Layflat Hose with Bonding Wire Exposed. 
 
 
Step 5. Initiate inserting the correct size hose end fitting (Figure 4.4) into the 
end of the layflat hose as shown in Figure 4.5. This may require reaching 
into the hose end to push the hose wall out while pushing the hose end in as 
straight as possible. A rubber hammer may be required to assist in the initial 
insertion.

Figure 4.5. Inserting Hose End Fitting into the Layflat Hose End 
 
 
Step 6. Once the hose end starts to enter the hose, lift hose with the end down-
ward and pound the hose, with the fitting partially inserted, onto a piece of 
wood as shown in Figure 4.6. If needed, spray hose and hose end fitting with 
soapy water to ease the insertion process. 
 
Note: If the hose end fitting is powder coated or anodized, remove approximately 
1-inch of coating from the surface where the bond wire will make contact before 
completely inserting and seating the hose end.

Figure 4.6. Installing Hose End Fitting. 
 
 
Step 7. After completely inserting the hose end fitting, coil the bonding wire 
so that it will remain approximately ½-inch in diameter. Lift the hose end and 
carefully slide the coil between the hose and the end fitting using a small 
screwdriver or other instrument. It should look like Figure 4.7 when finished.

Step 8. Perform a continuity test, using a multi-meter, on fittings of each hose 
end to ensure continuity (Figure 4.8). WaFERS UTCs do not include a multi-
meter, shop equipment must be used for this test. 
 
Figure 4.8. Performing Continuity Test on Hose End Fittings. 
 
 
4.5. Hose End Fitting Clamp Installation Procedures. Clamp the layflat hose 
end fittings with either the Mine-Flex original hose end clamp (Figure 4.9), or the 
snap clamp (Figure 4.10). 
 
120                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024

AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          121 
 
Note: Two clamps are required to hold one hose end fitting on the 6-, 8-, and 12-
inch MineFlex hose ends. One wide clamp made up of several segments is re-
quired for the 10-inch MineFlex layflat hose. 
 
Step 1. Loosely assemble two clamp segments using the hex head cap 
screws and nylon locking nuts. Place the loosely assembled pieces 
around hose end fitting nearest hose end.  
 
Note: Place hex head cap screws into the clamp segments, captivate the nylon hex 
nuts in a slot such that a wrench will not be required.  
 
Note: The clamp segments are directional. Face tapered edges to the outside to 
ease dragging or moving the hose. The single band 10-inch segments are also 
directional with the longer end facing the hose. 
 
Step 2. Complete the loose assembly of the clamps around the hose in 
the same fashion as the initial segments. Start tightening the hex head 
clamp cap screws. 
 
Caution: Clamp segments must be equally spaced around hose. If clamp seg-
ments are unequally spaced, hose slippage may occur, resulting in significant loss 
of fuel and/or injury to personnel. 
 
Step 3. Torque each bolt to 25 ft.-lbs. until tightening all bolt assemblies 
per coupling. 
 
Step 4. Then, alternately torque each bolt assembly to 30 ft.-lbs while 
keeping equal space between clamp segments. Repeat alternate torque 
sequence above to verify each assembly has 40 ft.-lbs of torque on the 
6”, 8”, and 12” hose, or 50 ft.-lbs. on the 10” clamp. 
 
Step 5. Assemble the second set of clamp segments around hose end fit-
ting next to the first clamp and install by following steps 2 through 4.

Step 6. Mark a line on the layflat hose adjacent to both sides of the clamp 
rings to facilitate inspection and easily recognize hose end movement or 
slippage (Figure 4.11). Write date of installation on the hose. 
 
Caution: Stop system fuel flow if hose end slippage occurs. Install a hose pincher, 
located in the 4FWLF or 4FWRB UTCs, and repair the end ensuring torque and 
spacing are correct.   
 
Figure 4.11. Completed OEM Hose End with Both Clamps Installed and 
Lines Drawn. 
 
 
4.5.2. Layflat Hose End Snap Clamp Procedures. Two hose end snap clamps 
are required to hold one hose end fitting on a layflat hose. 
 
Step 1. Without having the clamp on the hose, close the clamp and ensure 
both levers are snug, or somewhat snug, when closed. The clamps will 
apply pressure to hold the top and bottom halves of the clamp together 
as in Figure 4.10 above.  
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          123 
 
 
Note: Tighten or loosen a lever by turning clockwise or counter-clockwise on the 
ball-joint rod ends.   
 
Step 2. Open the clamp and fully tighten both levers. Then, loosen both 
levers 10 full turns to keep both sides even. 
 
Step 3. Set the hose on the bottom clamp half nearest the hose end with 
the hinge pin heads facing away from the hose end as shown in Figure 
4.12. Position top half of the clamp on the hose such that end gaps be-
tween the top and bottom clamp halves are equal on both sides. The cot-
ter pins will be toward the hose end. 
 
Figure 4.12. Position the Snap Clamp on the Installed Hose End Fitting. 
 
 
Step 4. Hook/Grip both clamp handle indents to the top half of the clamp 
notch ridges, as shown in Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14, and depress both 
handles at the same time enough so that they are both resisting.   
 
Note: The two lever arms have a slight notch machined into them to assist in 
hooking them onto the clamp notch ridge. Each of the two levers has a unique 
124                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
lever rate as can be seen by looking at the lever notch end. The two levers are a 
different length beyond their fulcrum hinge.  
 
Figure 4.13. Snap Clamp Hook and Notch 
 
 
Figure 4.14. Hooking the Clamp Levers in the Notches. 
 
 
Note: Do not depress a handle until both levers are hooked on their starting notch 
and gripping the clamp. The more you depress one handle, the less slack the op-
posite handle has. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          125 
 
Step 5. While keeping the second lever heavily resisted, snap down the 
first lever. This will press the hose into the groove of the hose end fitting.  
 
Step 6. Compress second lever to further press the hose into the groove 
on the end fitting. 
 
Note: If needed, back off the second lever just enough to allow the first lever to 
clamp down. Snap down the second lever to further press the hose into the groove 
on the end fitting. 
 
Step 7. Unclamp both the first and second levers but, keep pressure on 
the clamp handles to prevent the hose from unsettling. 
 
Step 8. Holding the clamp tight by hand, tighten the ball joint rod end on 
both the first and second levers 1 turn. Then, repeat steps 4 through 7. 
Wait at least 10 seconds between each cycle. Continue this process until 
training the hose material to stay in the grooves on the hose end fitting; 
the snap clamp levers will feel rigid. 
 
Note: It is not necessary to snap down the second lever to settle the hose. 
Depress the second lever enough until right before it snaps into place as 
shown in Figure 4.15. Keep it there for at least 10 seconds.

Figure 4.15. First Lever Clamped and Second Lever Partially Clamped. 
 
 
Step 8. After training hose material into the groove, slightly lift the first 
lever while keeping it hooked and gripping the notch. Tighten second 
lever’s ball joint rod end. 
 
Note: Ensure gaps on each side of the clamp are even throughout installation. If 
at any time a clamp upper and lower half come in contact (typically on the second 
lever side), loosen that side and tighten the opposite side ball joint rod end 3 to 4 
turns and continue the steps described above. 
 
Step 9. Once the second lever clamp requires serious force to snap it 
closed, the clamp is tight (Figure 4.16). Overcoming the resistance may 
require standing on the lever. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          127 
 
Figure 4.16. First Snap Clamp Installed. 
 
 
Step 10. Place second snap clamp on other hose end fitting slot with pin-
head side of clamp facing towards the first clamp (Figure 4.17). Install 
second snap clamp following steps 4 through 9 above.  
 
 
128                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Figure 4.17. Second Snap Clamp Placement. 
 
 
Step 11. Once both clamps are secure, (Figure 4.18) use cable ties to tie 
the levers together using the cable tie slot under the first lever (Figure 
4.19).

Figure 4.19. Installing Cable Ties on Both Snap Clamps. 
 
 
 
Step 12. With a permanent marker, mark a circle around the hose and 
adjacent to the clamp in order to facilitate inspection of the fitting for 
slippage.  
 
4.6. Special Considerations. In addition to compatible fittings (couplings and 
clamps), the Repair and Bypass UTC contains reducers to combine two hose sizes 
to lengthen the run of hose when necessary.  
 
4.7. After Repair Action. Monitor for leaks. When operating above 150 PSI, 
continuously monitor the hose during pumping. 
 
4.8. Periodic Inspection. Once the system is pressurized, check for leaks and 
ensure the layflat hose is free of kinks and clear of sharp and thin metal edges and 
pinch points. 
 
4.9. Reconstitution of Consumables. Through base supply, immediately reorder 
all items consumed to ensure the UTC is in mission ready status.

WATER AND FUEL PUMP UTC (4FWFP) 
 
5.1. Overview. The Water and Fuel Pump UTC is a system comprised of a 600-
GPM pump along with accessories for use in several configurations. These con-
figurations range from pumping liquids between two points, removing hazardous 
fuel from a work location, or as a pump house replacement including hydrant, 
transfer, and cut and cover tanks. Attach the pump (Figure 5.1) to in-place infra-
structure using various hoses, piping and fittings.  
 
Figure 5.1. WaFERS Pump. 
 
WARNING: If pump has been used to process fuel, it cannot be used 
to pump water. 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          131 
 
 
5.2. Description. This UTC provides up to 600 GPM of water or fuel pumping 
capability when water and/or fuel systems are damaged by attack, natural disaster 
or catastrophic failure. Connect the pumps in series or parallel to meet flow re-
quirements. A 10K gallon fuel bladder is required to store fuel and the Fuel Filter 
UTC is required for fuel filtering. The Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC 
support the Water and Fuel Pump UTC. A full list of all UTC components is in 
Attachment 2. 
 
5.3. General Capability of the Water and Fuel Pump UTC. There are five gen-
eral capabilities for this UTC: 
 
5.3.1. Water and Fuel Evacuation (piping, berms, puddles, spills, etc.). Evac-
uate water and fuel from an area to allow safe operations.  
 
5.3.2. Water and Fuel Recovery. Recover usable water and fuel from dam-
aged infrastructure such as tanks, large diameter piping, containments, etc. 
 
5.3.3. Pump House Bypass. Provide pumping capability to bypass a damaged 
or inoperable pump house. 
 
5.3.4. Bulk Water or Fuel Transfer. Transfer water or fuel from a point of 
origin to a destination or point of use. 
 
5.3.5. Cut and Cover Tanks. Recover usable fuel from damaged cut and cover 
or below grade tanks. 
 
5.4. General Safety.  
 
5.4.1. Keep fingers away from rotating shafts. 
 
5.4.2. To prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, operate the engine in a well-
ventilated area. If the area is enclosed, vent exhaust fumes to the outside.  
 
132                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
5.4.3. Utilize the ventilator from the Consolidated Tools and Equipment UTC 
in locations where excess fuel vapors are present. 
 
5.4.4. The maximum highway trailer speed is 55 MPH. 
 
5.5. WaFERS Pump General Quick Start and Operation Sequence. The pro-
cedures below briefly describe setup, start and operation procedures. See the Op-
erations Manual for detailed operation and maintenance procedures. 
 
Note: RPM approximately relates to GPM output (e.g., 600 RPM ≈ 600 GPM). 
 
Note: Downstream system resistance to flow and pump settings influences dis-
charge pressure. 
 
Note: Priming is typically not required for suction hose lengths shorter than 30 
feet.  
 
Note: Do not run pump more than 2 minutes without fluid. Running the pump dry 
will damage pump seals and vanes. 
 
Step 1. Position the pump as close to the source as possible with the suction 
(inlet) side of the pump towards the source. Then, place wheel chocks, set 
parking brake, and disconnect tow vehicle. 
 
Step 2. Drive the attached ground rod to the appropriate depth (see Table 5.1 
for recommended grounding rod depths). Connect the ground rod cable to the 
ground rod, or to an adequately grounded system such as piping. 
 
Note: Ensure underground utilities are not present when driving the ground rod.   
 
Step 3. Remove the basket strainer cover and clean debris from the strainer 
screen. Inspect the O-ring and re-install the strainer screen and cover. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          133 
 
Step 4. Connect hard hoses to the pump inlet (suction side with the rectangu-
lar lid strainer). Connect the layflat hose to the pump outlet as required (Fig-
ure 5.2).

Step 10. Place Down Hole Pump Switch in the OFF position. 
 
Step 11. Move pump Hydraulic Drive Engagement handle to ON. 
 
Step 12. Rotate Engine Throttle to achieve 2,350 RPM. 
 
Step 13. Rotate Maximum Pressure control to required Pressure or Flow Rate. 
 
5.6. Water and Fuel Evacuation, Recovery, and Transfer; and Pump House 
Bypass.  
 
5.6.1. Water and fuel evacuation is the process of removing liquid from areas 
where liquid may hinder repair efforts. 
 
5.6.2. Water and fuel recovery is the process of collecting usable liquid from 
damaged infrastructure such as tanks, large diameter piping, etc. 
 
5.6.3. Water and fuel transfer is the process of pumping usable liquid from 
one location, such as tank, to another usable location. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          135 
 
5.6.4. Use the pump-house bypass capability to replace a damaged pump 
house. The Fuel Filter UTC supports the pump-house bypass capability. 
 
5.6.5. Using the pump Quick Start and Setup Procedures in paragraph 5.5, 
perform the following procedures for water and fuel evacuation, recovery, 
and transfer. 
 
Note: Discharge location can vary depending on the urgency of the repair/opera-
tion; examples include a bladder, containment area, or truck. Contact the CE UCC 
for further direction if these options are not available. 
 
Note: Any recovered jet fuel requires filtering (use Fuel Filter UTC), followed by 
testing and compliance with the base fuels operations office before fueling an air-
craft with recovered fuel, or blended with a clean store of jet fuel. 
 
Note: For additional or longer hose runs, acquire hoses from the Layflat Hose 
UTC.  
 
Step 1. Position pump as close to the liquid as possible while avoiding 
potentially hazardous areas. 
 
Step 2. Lower and pin the jacks, and vertical stabilizers, in place while 
keeping the pump as level as possible. 
 
Step 3. Check diesel engine and hydraulic system fluids to ensure proper 
levels. 
 
Step 4. Install the ground rod and cable when pumping fuel (ensure un-
derground utilities are not present when driving the ground rod). Follow 
the depth recommendations in Table 5.1.  
 
Step 5. Connect one end of a hard suction hose to the suction strainer and 
the other end to the pump inlet. Use as many of the five provided hard 
hoses as needed to span the distance between the liquid and pump inlet.

Step 6. Connect one end of a 6-inch layflat hose to the pump outlet and 
the other end to the system desired to receive the liquid.   
 
Step 7. Start and monitor the pump until evacuation is completed. 
 
5.7. Cut and Cover Tanks. Pumping from a below grade tank requires the hy-
draulically driven booster pump to lift fuel into the inlet of the WaFERS pump 
when the elevation difference between the pump inlet and the fuel level is more 
than 15 feet. Perform the following procedures for pumping from cut and cover 
tanks: 
 
Step 1. Position the WaFERS pump as close to the tank’s top manway, or 
liquid access point, as possible while avoiding potentially hazardous areas. 
 
Step 2. Lower and pin the trailer jacks and vertical stabilizers in place while 
keeping the pump as level as possible. 
 
Step 3. Place wheel chocks under both trailer tires. 
 
Step 4. Disconnect the pump trailer from the tow vehicle. 
 
Step 5. Install the ground rod and cable when pumping fuel (ensure under-
ground utilities are not present while driving the ground rod). Follow the 
depth recommendations in Table 5.1. 
 
Step 6. Connect one end of a 6-inch layflat hose to the outlet of the booster 
(Figure 5.3) pump and the other to the inlet of the discharge head fitting 
(Figure 5.4).  
 
Step 7. Using another section of layflat or hard hose, connect the outlet of the 
discharge head fitting to the inlet of the WaFERS pump. 
 
Step 8. Use a third 6-inch layflat hose (from Repair and Bypass UTC or Lay-
flat Hose UTC) to connect the WaFERS pump outlet to the desired system to 
receive the fuel or water.

Step 9. Connect the booster pump’s three hydraulic lines to both the booster 
pump and the WaFERS pump hydraulic drive quick disconnect fittings.   
 
Note: When fittings will not connect, loosen the fittings on one end of a hydraulic 
hose to allow relief of internal pressure before the. This should allow fittings to 
connect.

Step 10. Lower the booster pump into the manway of the cut and cover tank 
using the tripod provided in this UTC. Lower until the pump is on the bottom, 
the 6-inch hose is supporting the weight of the pump or the winch cable is 
fully unwound. 
 
Step 11. Tie off the discharge head fitting to the side of the tank manway to 
take the weight of the pump off the aluminum WaFERS pump inlet manifold. 
 
Step 12. Start booster pump using the WaFERS pump control panel (Figure 
5.5). The control panel door has a placard on its inner side outlining the basic 
start sequence (Figure 5.6).

sure Gauge.  
 
Step 17. Throttle engine up to operating speed (2,450 RPM).  
 
Step 18. Adjust Maximum Pressure Control knob to achieve the pressure or 
flow rate required by the application.  
 
Step 19. Adjust the Auxiliary Hydraulic Flow Control knob to maintain be-
tween 10- and 15-psi on the Intake Pressure Gauge. 
 
Note: Control product discharge rate with the Maximum Pressure Control knob. 
Diesel engine must be at max rated RPM to achieve 600 GPM at 150 PSI. If 
reaching maximum pressure stop on the Maximum Pressure Control, but not 
achieving maximum pumping rate, ensure diesel engine speed is at its 2,450-RPM 
maximum. 
 
Note: To begin operations, refer to the WaFERS pump O&M manual for setup 
and startup of pumping trailer unit.  
 
Caution: Never run booster pump dry; otherwise, serious damage to the booster 
pump will occur. 
 
Note: Refer to fuel or water performance curve charts on inside of control panel 
door for guidance in making adjustments in engine RPM to affect flow rate.

FUEL FILTER UTC (4FWFF) 
 
6.1. Introduction. The Fuel Filter UTC consists of two 600-GPM filter separators 
mounted on an all-terrain trailer. This fuel filtering capability comes with numer-
ous hose connection adapters to facilitate connection to various systems, includ-
ing Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment. Attachment 2 provides 
a detailed inventory of this UTC. 
 
6.2. Description. This UTC provides expedient filtering of stored or recovered 
fuel from pipelines, berms, craters and storage tanks damaged by attack, natural 
disaster, or catastrophic failure. Fuel filtering provides suitable advanced filtration 
for contaminated fuels reintroduced into fuel storage or distribution systems. Two 
10K fuel bladders are required for temporary fuel storage and the Water and Fuel 
Pump UTC is required for pumping. In addition, the Consolidated Tools and 
Equipment UTC support this UTC. 
 
6.2.1. The filter has the capability to filter heavily contaminated fuel from 
earthen craters, containment areas and damaged storage tanks. The two 600 
GPM horizontal filter separators are designed to meet American Petroleum 
Institute/Energy Institute 1581-5th edition, category M standards and is in-
tended for use with aviation jet fuels including JP-8. Each horizontal filter 
separator is equipped with a sight gauge, differential pressure gauge and air 
eliminator. Each filter separator contains two stages of filtration. The first 
stage contains consumable filter coalescer elements that filters the solids and 
coalesces water from the fuel. The second stage contains cleanable separator 
elements to separate water from the fuel and allows water to drain into the 
sump. 
 
6.2.2. The filter trailer has a hitch for towing and jack mounts for stabilization 
(Figure 6.1). The filter fits within a tricon container for storage and shipment.  
 
 
146                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Figure 6.1. Fuel Filter and Trailer. 
 
6.2.3. The filtration system is capable of four configurations as listed below: 
 
6.2.3.1. Duplex Configuration. Using the duplex single filter filtration 
configuration, either separator can be in service at 600 GPM to clean up 
heavily contaminated fuel. In this operation mode, one separator can be 
out of service to change the filter elements while the other one remains 
operational. 
 
6.2.3.2. Independent Configuration. The independent configuration fil-
ters two independent 600 GPM flows from two independent sources go-
ing to two independent stores.  
 
6.2.3.3. Parallel Configuration. In a parallel configuration, both filters 
work together to filter up to 1200 GPM with output going to a single 
location. 
 
6.2.3.4. Double (Series) Configuration. In a double filtration configura-
tion, separators plumbed in series provide one double filtered 600 GPM 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          147 
 
flow rate. This provides mandated filtrations requirements when fueling 
aircraft directly.  
 
6.3. General Uses of Fuel Filter UTC. The fuel filter has many different capac-
ities and configurations, depending on the situation for recovering fuel or filtering 
fuel. Listed below are the three main uses for the fuel filter. 
 
6.3.1. Filter Dirty Fuel for Reclamation. This configuration filters spilled fuel 
from secondary containments, puddles, trucks, sumps and anywhere substan-
tial amount of fuel is pooled and suitable for reuse. In this situation, a duplex 
filter configuration is typical. 
 
6.3.2. Inline Filtering. The purpose of inline filtering is to satisfy require-
ments for aircraft or other fueling trucks (e.g., R-11 and R-12). In this situa-
tion, use a double (series) configuration. 
 
6.3.3. Pump House Bypass. Provides filtering capability while bypassing an 
unserviceable, or damaged beyond repair, pump house. In this situation, an 
independent configuration is typical for routing to different systems or use a 
parallel configuration to handle large flow rates up to 1200 GPM. 
 
6.4. General Safety. All personnel must practice proper safety procedures when 
repairing water and fuel systems. Individuals should guard against electrical, fire, 
tripping, falling, engulfment, and explosion hazards. In particular, flammable 
fuels, hazardous atmospheric conditions, pressurized piping and explosive condi-
tions are considerable hazards. Failure to comply with safety instructions and 
warnings in this publication may result in injury or death. Wear appropriate PPE 
according to applicable technical information and standards. 
 
Note: Drain water more frequently when operating in freezing weather to avoid 
freezing, which could rupture the filter separator vessel. 
 
Note: Filter separators must be empty before towing the cart at more than 10 MPH 
due to high center of gravity.

6.5. Fuel Filter Basic Setup and Operating Procedures. The line diagram in 
Figure 6.2 shows the filter trailer piping and component arrangement. Setup in-
structions for each of the four configurations follows.

AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          149 
 
6.5.1. Trailer Set Up. Use the following procedures to setup the Fuel Filter 
Trailer. 
 
Step 1. Park the trailer on level ground, apply brakes, and chock the 
wheels. 
 
Step 2. Lower and set the four stabilizer jacks. 
 
Step 3. Drive the attached ground rod into the ground (see Table 5.1 for 
recommended grounding rod depths). Connect the ground rod cable to 
the ground rod. 
 
Step 4. Slowly fill both separator vessels with fuel. 
 
Step 5. Align valves in the configuration required for the filter applica-
tion. 
 
6.5.2. Filling Filter Vessels. Use the following procedures to fill both filter 
separator vessels with fuel safely. 
 
Warning: An explosion could occur when filling the vessel rapidly. Slow filling 
is the only authorized method for refilling a filter separator. The rule of thumb is 
“never fill a vessel in less than ten minutes.” 
 
Step 1. Connect a 6-inch hose to inlet (C1-1). 
 
Step 2. Connect a 6-inch hose to outlet (C9-1). 
 
Step 3. Open Fuel Separator (FS)-1 inlet valve (V3-1) and FS-1 outlet 
valve (V6-1). 
 
Step 4. Open inlet block valve (V10), outlet block valve (V11), and 
crossover manual valve (V13). 
 
150                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Step 5. Open eductor supply manual valve (V14-1), eductor strainer 
shut-off valve (V14-3) and eductor shut-off manual valve (V17). 
 
Step 6. Open filter evacuation valves (V19-1) and (V19-2).   
 
Step 7. Open the air eliminator valves (V23-1) and (V23-2). 
 
Step 8. Open vacuum breaker shut-off valves (V24-1) and (V24-2). 
 
Step 9. Briefly open manual thermal relief valves (V28-1) and (V28-2) 
to relieve any thermal pressure build up. 
 
Step 10. Start fuel flow to the filter trailer with the WaFERS pump.   
 
Step 11. To fill the trailer slowly, perform the following actions on the 
WaFERS pump. 
1. Start the WaFERS pump. 
2. Adjust WaFERS pump engine speed to 1,200 RPM. 
3. Turn hydraulic drive engagement lever to the on posi-
tion. 
4. While watching the outlet pressure gauge, slowly turn 
the maximum pressure control knob clockwise to in-
crease hydraulic pump speed. Once the gauge needle 
moves, stop turning the control knob. This will allow 
sufficient hydraulic pressure for the pump to operate 
at the lowest speed and flow rate. 
 
Step 9. Partially open inlet valve (V2-1) to fill the vessel slowly. 
 
Note: Air will be coming out of the air vent located on recovery tank (T26). The 
filter is not full of fuel if air is escaping from the air vent located on recovery tank 
(T26). 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          151 
 
Note: During initial start-up, test the water slug-control pilot-valve(s) and flow 
control valve(s).  Refer to the operation’s manual for test procedures. 
 
Step 10. Once the filter separator is full and no air is discharging from 
the air vent on recovery tank (T26), close inlet valve (V2-1) and shut 
down WaFERS pump. 
 
6.5.3. Duplex Filter Configuration using only Fuel Separator-1 (FS-1). When 
placed in this configuration, place either filter in service for continued fueling 
operation; the other filter is available for maintenance. In this example, FS-1 
provides single filter filtration at 600 GPM. Figure 6.3 shows the open and 
closed valve arrangement when the filters are in a duplex configuration with 
arrows indicating the flow path. In this arrangement, the second separator 
(FS-2) is out of service. After filling the filter vessels with fuel (paragraph 
6.5.2) and all valves on the filter trailer are closed, perform the steps that 
follow. 
 
Step 1. Connect a 6-inch hose to the inlet (C1-1). 
 
Note: Use a hard-wall or layflat hose for the inlet(s) and outlet(s). Recommend 
using a hard-wall hose on the filter connections to ease in positioning hoses and 
alleviate potential kinks when using layflat hose. 
 
Step 2. Connect a 6-inch hose to the outlet (C9-1). 
 
Step 3. Open the air eliminator valves (V23-1) and (V23-2). 
 
Step 4. Open vacuum breaker shut-off valves (V24-1) and (V24-2). 
 
Step 5. Open outlet valve (V8-1). 
 
Step 6. Open the FS-1 inlet valve (V3). 
 
Step 7. Open FS-1 outlet valve (V6).

Warning: Before fueling operations start, fill the filter vessel with fuel. If not 
previously filled with fuel, use the procedures in paragraph 6.5.2 to fill both ves-
sels with fuel safely. 
 
Step 10. Monitor the differential pressure gauge across the separator. If 
the differential pressure exceeds 15 psi, change the elements. 
 
Step 11. Monitor the recovery tank level to prevent overflow/fuel spill-
age.   
 
6.5.4. Duplex Filter Configuration Using FS-2 Only. When placed in this 
configuration, place either filter in service for continued fueling operation, 
and when necessary, take the other filter out of service for maintenance. Fig-
ure 6.4 shows single filter filtration with FS-2 in operation at 600 GPM and 
the open and closed valve arrangement with arrows indicating the path of 
flow. In this arrangement, the second separator FS-1 is out of service. After 
filling the filter vessels with fuel (see paragraph 6.5.2), and all valves on the 
filter trailer are closed, perform the steps that follow.

the differential pressure exceeds 15 psi, change the elements.  
 
Step 10. Monitor the recovery tank level to prevent overflow/fuel spill-
age. 
 
6.5.5. Independent Filter Configuration. This configuration provides two in-
dependent 600 GPM filter flows from two independent sources going to two 
independent locations. Figure 6.5 shows the open and closed valve arrange-
ment with arrows indicating the path of flow. In this arrangement, both sep-
arators are in service with output going to two independent connections. After 
filling the filter vessels with fuel (paragraph 6.5.2), and all valves on the 
filter trailer are closed, perform the steps that follow. 
 
Step 1. Connect a 6-inch hose to FS-1 inlet (C1-1).  
 
Note: Use hard-wall or layflat hose for inlet(s) and outlet(s). Recommended using 
a hard-wall hose on filter connections to ease hose positioning and alleviate po-
tential kinks when using layflat hose. 
 
Step 2. Connect a 6-inch hose to FS-2 inlet (C1-2).

Step 11. Slowly start fuel flow to the filter trailer with the WaFERS pump 
until achieving desired flow rate. 
 
Warning: Before fueling operations start, fill the filter vessel with fuel. If not 
previously filled with fuel, use procedures in paragraph 6.5.2 to fill both vessels 
with fuel safely. 
 
Step 12. Monitor the differential pressure gauge across each separator. If 
the differential pressure exceeds 15 psi, change the elements.  
 
Step 13. Monitor the recovery tank level to prevent overflow/fuel spill-
age. 
 
6.5.6. Parallel Filter Configuration. When using both filters in parallel 
(paired), a single location may receive a 1,200 GPM output. Figure 6.6 shows 
the open and closed valve arrangement with arrows indicating the path of 
flow. In this arrangement, both separators are in parallel at 600 GPM service 
each, with a combined output going to a single connection at 1,200 GPM. 
After filling the filter vessels with fuel (paragraph 6.5.2), and all valves on 
the filter trailer are closed, perform the steps that follow.

6.5.10. Cleaning Strainer Baskets. Perform the following steps to check or 
clean the strainer baskets: 
 
Step 1. Close inlet and outlet isolation valves on the basket to clean. 
 
Caution: Use a small container to catch any released fuel during the following 
step. 
 
Step 2. Open drain on the strainer to clean; this vents any trapped pres-
sure and drains the strainer. 
 
Step 3. Loosen nuts on top to the strainer.  
 
Step 4. Pull up on the front and back of the cover; then, rotate to gain 
access to the strainer basket. 
166                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
 
Step 5. Clean the basket (refer to the equipment manual).  
 
Step 6. Once baskets are clean, return to strainer and properly seat in the 
housing. 
 
Step 7. Inspect the cover O-ring (replace if damaged) and then place the 
cover over the opening. Carefully align the cover and then press into 
housing to avoid damage to the O-ring. 
 
Step 8. Tighten the retaining nuts. 
 
Step 9. Close the vent valve on top of the housing. 
 
6.5.11. Actions during Filter Separator Operation. Make a visual inspection 
of all connections, joints and piping components for visible leaks. Drain wa-
ter as needed, by opening the water drain valve. 
 
Caution: Stop fueling operations and change the elements if the differential pres-
sure gauge indicates above 15 psi when the system is flowing fuel at full flow rate 
and pressure. See paragraph 6.5.8 for eductor evacuation operation.

when replacing the filter elements. Follow procedures in paragraph 6.5.14 
to open the vessel cover. 
 
Step 1. Remove nuts and separator retainer. 
 
Step 2. Remove seal bolts to release the separator elements. 
 
Caution: Do NOT touch the screen with bare hands or any oily material. Oil or 
grease will disarm the separator and reduce effectiveness. 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          169 
 
 
Step 3. Clean separator elements by submerging them in clean fuel and 
gently brushing the screen surfaces with a soft bristle brush. Inspect ex-
terior surfaces for tears or other damage. Inspect rubber gaskets. 
 
Step 4. Replace separator elements in the vessel. Correctly seat rubber 
gaskets on the knife-edge of the separator seat. 
 
Step 5. Reinstall the seal bolts and tighten to 5 ft-lbs of torque. 
 
Step 6. Inspect the O-ring to ensure it is in good condition and properly 
seated in the groove. Tighten cover bolts, in a cross pattern, to the spec-
ified torque values listed in Table 6.2. 
 
Step 7. Place the filter separator back in service as described in para-
graph 6.5. 
 
6.5.16. Recommended Flange Tightening Process. Ensure flange faces are 
clean and free of imperfections before tightening flanges. Table 6.2 provides 
recommended tightening torques for filter monitors and filter water separa-
tors. 
 
Step 1. Carefully remove any solid residue from the flanges using scrap-
ers, wire brush, or both. 
 
Step 2. Carefully fit gasket into position taking care not to damage the 
gasket surface. 
 
Step 3. Install studs/bolts hand-tighten in turn.  
 
Step 4. Initially torque bolts to 30% of the final torque in a cross-pattern 
sequence. 
 
Step 5. Next, torque to 60% of the final torque value using the same 
tightening sequence.

Step 6. Torque to the final torque value using the same tightening se-
quence. 
 
Step 7. Continue with one final pass tightening the bolts/studs in a clock-
wise sequence to the final torque value. 
 
6.6. Special Considerations. 
 
6.6.1. Filter separators must be empty before towing the cart at more than 10 
MPH due to high center of gravity. 
 
6.6.2. Filter separator elements will not filter water. The filter separator ele-
ments are approved to filter only JP-5, JP-8, Jet-A, kerosene and diesel fuel.  
 
6.7. After Repair Actions. Clean and inspect tools and equipment per Attach-
ment 3. 
 
6.8. Periodic Inspection. Perform frequent inspections of hose connections, mon-
itor for leaks, operational checks (water level and differential pressure). Verify 
correct valve alignment. 
 
6.9. Reconstitution of Consumables. Immediately reorder all consumed items 
through base supply to keep the UTC in mission ready status. 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          171 
 
Chapter 7 
 
RECONSTITUTION AND RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATIONS 
 
7.1. Reconstitution. All consumable items (e.g., gaskets, filter elements, layflat 
hose, etc.) used should be replenished through base supply as quickly as the mis-
sion allows to ensure each UTC is kept in mission ready status. If reconstituted at 
the WRM storage location, the process may add more time to the UTC being in a 
non-deployable status. Clean, lubricate and inspect all equipment and tools after 
use. Store equipment and tools in the appropriate place in the storage container. 
 
7.2. Return to Normal Operations. This phase begins when an appropriate au-
thority directs the return to normal operations. During this phase, begin imple-
menting plans to reconstitute WaFERS equipment, materials and vehicles. Re-
turning to normal operations requires permanent repairs to be scheduled and fi-
nancially programed to allow the removal of temporary repairs and replacement 
with permanent system components, pieces and parts. Depending upon recovery 
actions after the attack(s), the shop’s normal operations may include additional 
tasks. The following information discusses those added tasks (not all-inclusive). 
 
7.2.1. Reusable Items. Reusable items removed during permanent repair 
should be reconstituted and returned to the appropriate UTC. Costs should 
determine repair or replacement of repairable items removed from the sys-
tem. If a damaged item is beyond feasible repair, procure a new replacement 
item. 
 
7.2.2. Restock for WRM. When returning UTCs to WRM status, accomplish 
a complete inventory of every component. Replace any item taken from a 
UTC for repairs before declaring the UTC mission capable.  
 
7.2.3. Establishing a Permanent Repair. Initiate contracts to replace WaFERS 
temporary repairs with permanent repairs. Continue routine inspections on 
temporary repairs until replaced. 
 
172                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
Note: Certain repairs utilizing WaFERS assets may be equivalent to semi-perma-
nent repairs. For example, weld the PLIDCO® Smith+Sleeve in place once the 
environment is safe to do so. Capping of the hydrant outlet and the inline pipe 
replacement using mechanical clamps are other examples.  
 
Note: Layflat hoses and epoxy wrap repairs are examples of temporary repairs 
made to a system. Closely monitor and verify condition while temporary repairs 
are in place.

DAMAGE SCENARIOS 
 
8.1. Overview. To demonstrate the capability of WaFERS, this chapter uses a 
fictitious fuel system as an example to discuss possible repair solutions. The ex-
ample portrays possible damages and facilitates a discussion to determine repair 
solutions that apply to real military base fuel systems. The repairs presented here 
are suggestions that may require modifications depending on local conditions. 
 
8.2. Fictitious Fuel System. Figure 8.1 portrays a fictitious fuel system having 
components similar to those found in a typical airbase fuel system. Component 
descriptions follow. 
 
A. Bulk JP-8 Fuel Storage Facility. The fuel storage facility includes three 
aboveground storage tanks (AST) and one underground storage (UST) tank. 
The UST has a turbine pump installed which is the only method to transfer 
fuel to the Hydrant Loop Storage Tanks from this tank. The ASTs are con-
tained in a concrete containment berm and a downstream pump house at an 
independent location. 
 
B. Bulk transfer Fuel Pump and Filter House. This facility is used to transfer 
fuel from the ASTs to the Hydrant Loop Storage Tanks. 
 
C. Transfer piping. This piping transfers fuel from the ASTs to the Bulk trans-
fer Fuel Pump and Filter House. This piping is both above and below grade. 
 
D. Transfer piping from the UST turbine pump. This piping is the transpor-
tation route to the hydrant pump-house storage tanks. This piping is both 
above and below grade. In this example, the piping connects above ground at 
a valve run with the Bulk Transfer Fuel Pump and Filter House to Point B 
piping. 
 
E. Hydrant Loop Storage Tanks. This facility consists of two hydrant Loop 
ASTs contained in a concrete berm. 
174                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
 
F. Hydrant Loop Pump House. The Hydrant loop Pump House is used to 
pressurize the Hydrant Loop to approximately 100 PSI. This pump house has 
an automatic variable flow rate to ensure the hydrant loop maintains the set 
pressure, regardless of the number of aircraft fueling simultaneously. 
 
G. Hydrant Loop. The hydrant loop is a manifold of large piping used to carry 
fuel to the R-12 Fueling truck. The truck connects the hydrant loop to the 
aircraft via the hydrant outlet. 
 
H. JP-8 Transfer Line Junction Valve Pit. This Valve Pit controls the source 
of fuel from either the ASTs and bulk-transfer pump house or the UST.

8.3. Damages to Fictitious Fuel System and UTC Selection. The following par-
agraphs describe the damage done to the fuel system portrayed in Figure 8.1 and 
discusses the preferred UTC(s) used to repair each of the damages described. In 
all cases, the Consolidated Tools UTC will be required in addition to those men-
tioned in each scenario. 
 
8.3.1. Damage Scenario 1. Bulk JP-8 Storage Tank has a 12-inch diameter 
hole located one-third of the way up the tank shell. Fuel has spilled into the 
berm. 
 
8.3.1.1. In order to perform a repair on this compromised tank, relocate 
fuel in the berm first. The fuel in the tank berm is slightly contaminated, 
but usable since it is contained in a concrete containment. Filter this fuel 
with the Fuel Filter UTC. Use the Water and Fuel Pump UTC to pump 
fuel through the filter. A storage location could be any tank with capacity 
to accept the fuel, or request fuel bladders. Follow steps in Chapters 5 
and 6 for using the Water and Fuel Pump UTC and Fuel Filter UTC.  
 
8.3.1.2. Once access to the tank is possible, evaluate the tank to deter-
mine if repair is feasible. If so, follow steps in Chapter 5 to install a tank 
patch over the 12-inch hole. If a repair is not feasible, isolate connections 
to and from the tank and place it out of service. 
 
8.3.2. Damage Scenario 2. JP-8 UST Pump House destroyed. There is usable 
fuel in the tank to fuel aircraft, but the pump is beyond repair. 
 
8.3.2.1. In this scenario, there is usable fuel in the below grade storage 
tank needed to prevent disruption of the Air Tasking Order (ATO). One 
solution is to pump fuel from the tank using the Water and Fuel Pump 
UTC with the booster pump. The booster pump will be lowered into the 
below grade tank to push fuel up to the WaFERS pump, which will be 
connected to the pipeline leading to the airfield fuel tanks. Connect the 
Fuel Filter UTC inline to ensure the aircraft fuel is clean.  
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          177 
 
8.3.2.2. Follow steps in Chapters 5 and 6 for instructions on the Water 
and Fuel Pump UTC and Fuel Filter UTC.  
 
8.3.3. Damage Scenario 3. Bulk JP-8 1,800 GPM Pump House and Filter 
House severely damaged. Multiple UXO in the area are preventing repair. 
 
8.3.3.1. This pump and filter house is the primary means by which the 
base moves fuel from bulk storage to the various points of use on base. 
The solution to restore this capability is to bypass the filter/pump house 
using multiple fuel filters and three 600 GPM WaFERS Pumps.  
 
8.3.3.2. The Fuel Filter UTC has the capability of filtering 1,200 GPM 
as described in Chapter 5. Each WaFERS pump is capable of pumping 
600 GPM; therefore, use two Fuel Filter UTCs, and Water and Fuel 
Pump UTCs for this scenario. Follow steps in Chapters 5 and 6 for using 
the Water and Fuel Pump UTC and Fuel Filter UTC. 
 
8.3.3.3. It may be necessary to bypass the unsafe UXO area with the Re-
pair and Bypass UTC, as described in Chapter 3, by relocating fuel lines 
to a safe staging area for the WaFERS pump and fuel filter setup.  
 
8.3.4. Damage Scenario 4. JP-8 12-inch transfer pipeline from the Bulk Fuel 
Pump House and Filter House severely damaged. There is a crater and a sus-
pected UXO along the pipeline route to the hydrant tanks. 
 
8.3.4.1. Before repairs to this pipeline can occur, Explosive Ordnance 
Disposal personnel must mitigate the UXO. However, removing or ren-
dering the UXO safe will take extensive time.  
 
8.3.4.2. The best option is to bypass the damage and explosive hazard 
area using a 10- or 12-inch layflat hose. Follow steps in Chapter 3 for 
utilizing the Repair and Bypass UTC.  
 
8.3.4.3. Pump fuel through a filter (Fuel Filter UTC) to a usable storage 
point. 
178                                                             AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024 
 
 
8.3.5. Damage Scenario 5. Three JP-8 hydrant outlets have damage and spew-
ing fuel. Five outlets are required to continue operations. 
 
8.3.5.1. The entire hydrant loop becomes unusable due to leaking hy-
drant outlets, as the loop requires continuous pressure. In order to use the 
undamaged hydrants, plug the leaking outlets.  
 
8.3.5.2. Plug the hydrants by using one of two methods: capping with a 
pipe cap or plugging with a pipe plug. In both repair types, make a 
straight cut through the pipe. The components required are contained in 
the Repair and Bypass UTC. Refer to Chapter 3 for instruction on cap-
ping or plugging a pipe. 
 
8.3.6. Damage Scenario 6. The 12-inch hydrant return line is damaged and 
the system cannot maintain required pressure. Additionally, fuel is spewing 
from a crater. 
 
8.3.6.1. As described in Damage Scenario 5, the hydrant requires contin-
uous pressure for proper operation; consequently, rapidly repair the leak 
in the hydrant loop by using one of the several methods described below.   
 
8.3.6.2. For a pipe penetration, available repair methods include epoxy-
based wrap, line clamps and hole plugs. Refer to Chapter 3 for instruc-
tions on the use of the various types of line patches. 
 
8.3.6.3. For severely damaged pipes perform an in-line repair by using 
aluminum pipe sections (below grade) or layflat hose (above grade). Fol-
low steps in Chapter 3 for repair instructions. 
 
8.3.7. Damage Scenario 7. JP-8 transfer-line junction valve pit damaged to 
the point that valves are not salvageable. The Hydrant Loop Storage Tanks 
need the fuel coming from both the ASTs and the UST for refueling opera-
tions. 
 
AFTTP3-32.22  12 FEBRUARY 2024                                                          179 
 
8.3.7.1. In some cases, it may not be feasible to repair an entire valve pit; 
make decisions using available information at the point of repair.  
 
8.3.7.2. A valve pit is similar to a piping manifold and can be replaced 
with temporary connections and valves. Refer to Chapter 3 for instruc-
tions on bypassing a damaged manifold.
