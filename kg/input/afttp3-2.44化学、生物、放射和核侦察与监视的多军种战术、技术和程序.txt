Introduction 
Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran are examples of CBRN-capable threats that represent a challenge to the 
readiness of United States (U.S.) forces across the range of military operations. It is highly anticipated that 
these threats will use multiple approaches in different phases to leverage CBRN to their advantage. CBRN 
R&S exists to provide the freedom of action for U.S. forces operating in CBRN environments. CBRN R&S 
capabilities across the Services provide an agile, adaptive team that enables these forces to fight and win in 
a complex CBRN environment. ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 presents 
principles and tactical-level tactics, techniques, and procedures related to CBRN R&S and describes how to 
employ CBRN R&S capabilities in support of operations. The tactical and technical guidance provided also 
support sound decision making for forces operating in CBRN environments.   
The CBRN threats and hazards that are the subject of this publication are those that could create adverse 
effects due to accidental or deliberate release or intentional employment. CBRN hazards include toxic 
industrial chemicals, biologicals, and radiologicals collectively known as toxic industrial materials (TIMs). 
The use of a trade or brand name in the provided text does not constitute endorsement of the product. ATP 
3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 contains the following seven chapters and seven
supporting appendixes:

Chapter 1 provides an understanding of the fundamentals of CBRN R&S operations and how
they integrate with intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and with joint warfighting
functions.

Chapter 2 defines the Department of Defense (DOD) four-tiered identification levels, provides a
comparison to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) identification levels, and addresses
special considerations and decision-making linkages to CBRN identification.

Chapter 3 describes the relationship between the commander, the operations process, and CBRN
R&S; highlights how CBRN R&S support large-scale combat operations; and describes the
planning fundamentals and processes of CBRN R&S.

Chapter 4 describes preparation activities for conducting CBRN R&S, including troop-leading
procedures.

Chapter 5 provides an overview of selecting and executing the approach, methods, types, forms,
and tasks to conduct CBRN R&S.

Chapter 6 defines the requirements, roles, and responsibilities to conduct sample collection,
management, and processing.

Chapter 7 describes the requirements and processes to conduct marking and reporting of hazards
assessed during CBRN R&S.


Chapter 1 
Fundamentals 
This chapter introduces the joint ISR process and CBRN R&S tasks. It provides the 
fundamentals for how CBRN R&S is applied through the joint ISR process and CBRN 
operational planning and defines CBRN R&S principles. 
JOINT INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE 
1-1. Intelligence is the product resulting from the collection, processing, integration, evaluation, analysis,
and interpretation of available information concerning foreign nations, hostile or potentially hostile forces or
elements, or areas of actual or potential operations. (JP 2-0) The joint intelligence preparation of the
operational environment (JIPOE) process or intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB), managed by the
joint intelligence staff (J-2)/major subordinate command (G-2)/brigade or below intelligence staff officer
(S-2), is designed to account for probable, confirmed, and plausible enemy and adversary capabilities,
actions, and intentions.
1-2. The intelligence function, influenced by the J-2/G-2/S-2 and with the direction of commanders,
allocates and synchronizes intelligence assets and joint ISR to continuously determine the locations,
strengths, and probable intentions of enemy forces. Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance is an
integrated operations and intelligence activity that synchronizes and integrates the planning and operation of
sensors, assets, and processing, exploitation, and dissemination systems in direct support of current and future 
operations. (JP 2-01)
1-3. Joint ISR is an integrated intelligence and operations function that synchronizes and integrates the
placement of sensors and assets. Joint ISR involves the processing, exploitation, and dissemination of
information in direct support of current and future operations. The J-2/G-2/S-2 is responsible for identifying
potential collection targets based on operational trends and prioritized collection requirements that are used
to drive reconnaissance and security mission planning. The CBRN staff collaborates with the intelligence
section to assess enemy CBRN capabilities and potential courses of action, the impact of current and
projected weather, and the enemy intent to use CBRN weapons. Intelligence analysis is the key function that
enables understanding of the area of operations (AO) and threat capabilities and of the critical operational
impacts of these factors. Information collection and intelligence analysis supports the CBRN staff in
preparing accurate threat assessments.
1-4. Medical, engineer, CBRN, civil affairs forces, and staff sections contribute to the joint ISR process
through the reporting of analysis of the operational environment (OE) and variables relevant to their
functions. The products of the CBRN staff analysis feed into IPB, the overall joint ISR process, and other
staff section mission analysis results.
Note. For additional information regarding joint ISR and optimization, see ATP 3-55.3/MCRP 
2-10A.8/NTTP 2-01.3/AFTTP 3-2.88.
1-5. Joint ISR capabilities support countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD) by enabling the
command to locate, identify, characterize, and assess weapons of mass destruction (WMD) networks and
activities. It is supported by an information collection plan that identifies areas for collection that leverage
integrated sensors/unmanned systems, electronic warfare, cyberspace, aircraft, and CBRN units that lead to
real-time understanding of the CBRN environment during decisive action. Knowledge about the OE requires
proactive and continuous R&S to acquire information. All source analysis of information from multiple
sources becomes intelligence that provides answers to commander’s critical information requirements
Chapter 1 
1-2
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
(CCIRs) concerning the enemy or adversary, weather, terrain, and civil considerations. It is critical that 
CBRN staffs contribute to joint ISR synchronization and integration planning, providing technical and 
subject matter expertise in collaboration with the J-2/G-2/S-2, operations directorate of a joint staff 
(J-3)/battalion or brigade operations staff officer (S-3), and civil-military operations directorate of a joint 
staff (J-9)/battalion or brigade civil affairs operations staff officer (S-9) to maximize CBRN-specific joint 
ISR coverage.  
1-6. During the phases of the joint ISR process, the CBRN staff ensures the integration of CBRN R&S
forces, their activities, and information collected when there is a CBRN threat or hazard. The CBRN staff
provides input to the overall joint ISR process through collaboration. The staff ensures that CBRN priorities
of effort are depicted in the collection plans to satisfy the information requirements, determine the best
method(s) and asset(s) to collect the information, and maintain situational awareness of ongoing information
collection.
1-7. This publication focuses on CBRN R&S. The terms R&S are, in many cases, used synonymously, yet
they are two separate tasks of joint ISR operations:

Reconnaissance is a mission undertaken to obtain, by visual observation or other detection
methods, information about the activities and resources of an enemy or adversary, or to secure
data concerning the meteorological, hydrographic, or geographic characteristics of a particular
area. (JP 2-0)

Surveillance is the systematic observation of aerospace, cyberspace, surface, or subsurface areas,
places, persons, or things by visual, aural, electronic, photographic, or other means. (JP 3-0)
1-8. The purpose of CBRN R&S is to provide commanders with detailed, timely, and accurate information
to inform commander’s decisions or answer CCIRs. As information is collected from multiple CBRN R&S
capabilities, it is analyzed and yields intelligence that supports answering the CCIRs concerning CBRN
impacts to the commander’s scheme of maneuver.
1-9. CBRN staffs contribute to the development of the CCIRs and, with the J-3/S-3 and upon the
commander’s approval, recommend CBRN named areas of interest (NAIs). The named area of interest is a
geospatial area or systems node or link against which information that will satisfy a specific information
requirement can be collected, usually to capture indications of adversary courses of action. (JP 2-01.3) CCIRs
can be collected. NAIs typically indicate the selection of an enemy course of action or planned CBRN usage.
1-10. CBRN R&S capabilities detect hazards or anomalies from a sequential approach. Where possible,
sensors and observation devices are used to detect hazards from stand-off distances. Stand-off detection then
cues reconnaissance leaders to gather further detail on a specific location, potentially involving autonomous
or semiautonomous unmanned systems to further interrogate the hazard or anomaly. These can be launched
from modular payloads capable of being integrated with CBRN R&S units. If greater fidelity of information
or sampling operations is required, CBRN R&S units directly provide assessment, characterization, and
exploitation of hazards to provide information to CBRN staffs.
1-11. Once CBRN R&S collects information on CBRN-specific NAIs, the CBRN staffs process and interpret 
data provided from CBRN R&S elements to provide clarity to attain hazard awareness and understanding for
commanders and staffs. The end state of CBRN R&S operations is intelligence that reduces ambiguity to
enable the commander’s decision making.
RELEVANCE TO JOINT AND SERVICE WARFIGHTING 
FUNCTIONS 
1-12. While this manual focuses on CBRN R&S, the CBRN staff planner must understand how CBRN R&S
is relevant to the joint and Service warfighting functions. A warfighting function is a group of tasks and
systems united by a common purpose that commanders use to accomplish missions and training objectives.
(ADP 3-0) Warfighting functions are the physical means that commanders use to execute operations and
accomplish missions. Their purpose is to provide an intellectual organization for common critical capabilities 
relevant to all echelons and levels of warfare.

1-3
1-13. The joint and Service warfighting functions are—

Command and control (C2).

Intelligence.

Fires.

Movement and maneuver.

Protection.

Sustainment.

Information (joint).
Note. For more information on the joint and Service warfighting functions, see JP 3-0. 
1-14. To execute operations, commanders conceptualize capabilities that generate combat power. The
warfighting functions make up the elements of combat power. CBRN R&S provides relevant data and
information to support decision making across all warfighting functions.
COMMAND AND CONTROL 
1-15. C2 encompasses the exercise of authority and direction by a commander over assigned and attached
forces to accomplish the mission. Command includes both the authority and responsibility to use resources
to accomplish assigned missions. Command at all levels is the art of motivating and directing people and
organizations to accomplish missions. The C2 function consists of the architecture, organization, and system
that support an efficient decision-making process.
1-16. Reconnaissance operations are essential to successful operations. Commanders at all levels rely on
reconnaissance to achieve situational understanding; visualize operations in the context of mission and
operational variables; develop the situation; and identify and create options to seize, retain, and exploit the
initiative. CBRN R&S planning and operations must be integrated and congruent within overall
reconnaissance operations, complementing maneuver reconnaissance operations while addressing CBRN-
related CCIRs and rapidly cueing CBRN R&S operations against reports from traditional reconnaissance
operations.
1-17. CBRN staff members are critical to supporting C2 by supporting the mission analysis, identifying
critical facts and assumptions that aid in the development of the initial CCIR. The CCIRs are composed of
priority intelligence requirements (PIRs) and friendly force information requirements, which facilitate timely
decision making. PIRs are an information requirement necessary to understand the adversary or OE. PIRs
identify information about the enemy, terrain, weather, and civil considerations that the commander considers
most important and that will impact future decisions. Friendly force information requirements identify
information about friendly forces and supporting capabilities; it is information that affects future courses of
action and decisions from a friendly perspective.
1-18. Based on identified information requirements, staffs assign tasks to prioritize, manage, and develop
the collection of information requirements leading to future decisions. As staffs identify the requirements
necessary for successful execution, they recommend and assign tasks for units to conduct reconnaissance and
provide answers that allow the commander to make decisions and capitalize on opportunities.
SUPPORT TO INTELLIGENCE 
1-19. CBRN R&S directly supports the joint and Service warfighting function of intelligence. Intelligence
provides commanders with an understanding of the OE. The intelligence function includes planning and
direction, to include managing counterintelligence activities, collection, processing, exploitation, analysis,
production, dissemination, integration, evaluation, and feedback. CBRN R&S provides raw data and, in some
cases, processed information to inform military decision making across a broad range of tasks.
1-20. CBRN staffs use all available intelligence provided by the J-2/G-2/S-2 to conduct CBRN threat
assessments to determine if units will confront CBRN threats and hazards. When CBRN staffs conduct threat
assessments, they use all available collection platforms in conjunction with CBRN R&S forces to provide

layered, redundant coverage that identifies enemy capabilities, opportunities, and intentions. See 
ATP 3-11.36/MCRP 10-10E.1/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70 for more information on threat assessments.  
1-21. CBRN R&S feeds into intelligence fusion (see JP 2-0), providing the most accurate and complete
depiction of what is known about an activity in the OE. CBRN forces can contribute to intelligence through
site exploitation. Site exploitation is a series of activities to recognize, collect, process, preserve, and analyze
information, personnel and/or materiel found during the conduct of operations. (JP 3-31) CBRN R&S
elements and supporting/supported explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), engineer, or intelligence elements
provide weapons technical information of WMD to staffs. CBRN R&S forces provide intelligence staffs
technical and forensic information recovered from sensitive sites to support analysis. During processing and
exploitation, raw data collected from CBRN R&S is converted into intelligence that can be readily used by
commanders, staffs, and decision makers at all levels.
1-22. CBRN staffs must integrate with the J-2/G-2/S-2 intelligence staffs and be able to conduct their own
analysis from multiple intelligence sources to support the information collection plan and confirm logical
placements of CBRN R&S capabilities to answer CCIRs. Table 1-1 describes the types of intelligence and
examples of how CBRN staffs may utilize them during joint ISR planning.

CBRN R&S contribution 
GEOINT 
The exploitation and analysis of imagery 
and geospatial information to describe, 
assess, and visually depict physical features 
and geographically referenced activities on 
the Earth (JP 2-03). 
GEOINT assists CBRN planners in 
understanding terrain effects on CBRN 
hazards and the downstream effects that 
make attack locations lucrative for enemy 
CBRN targeting. Furthermore, terrain analysis 
from GEOINT can provide insight into CBRN 
transfer and loading locations of agents onto 
projectile and missile warheads. 
HUMINT 
A category of intelligence derived from 
information collected and provided by 
human sources (JP 2-0). 
Intelligence interrogation and source 
operations may provide critical details for 
WMD pathways, networks, capabilities, and 
delivery systems to friendly forces. HUMINT 
can be gained from understanding populations 
via nonlethal engagements through 
information operations. 
SIGINT 
Intelligence produced by exploiting foreign 
communications systems and 
noncommunication emitters (JP 2-0). 
SIGINT provides CBRN staffs with unique 
opportunities to provide early warning and 
protection from CBRN attacks through the 
interception of critical enemy communications 
directing the transfer, load, or launch of enemy 
CBRN attacks.

TECHINT 
Intelligence derived from the collection, 
processing, analysis, and exploitation of 
data and information pertaining to foreign 
equipment and materiel for the purposes of 
preventing technological surprise, assessing 
foreign scientific and technical capabilities, 
and developing countermeasures designed 
to neutralize an adversary’s technological 
advantages (JP 2-0). 
Assets from the National Ground Intelligence 
Center, Weapons of Mass Destruction 
Division, Asymmetric Warfare Group, Dugway 
Proving Ground, United States Army Combat 
Capabilities Development Command Chemical 
Biological Center, Edgewood, and other 
governmental agencies can provide 
substantial TECHINT on enemy CBRN 
development, tactics, techniques, procedures, 
and delivery systems. TECHINT is processed 
and disseminated through Army CBRNE 
companies as they conduct site exploitation 
operations. 
MEDINT 
Intelligence resulting from collection, 
evaluation, analysis, and interpretation of 
foreign medical, bio-scientific, and 
environmental information that is of interest 
to strategic planning and to military medical 
planning and can provide medical staffs with 
information to support medical CBRN 
planning (JP 2-01). 
The National Center for Medical Intelligence is 
the only authorized organization that 
processes medical information into a finished 
MEDINT product. MEDINT assists CBRN 
planners in understanding potential dual-use 
medical and bio-scientific expertise, 
equipment, and facilities; endemic biological 
agents; and environmental and occupational 
conditions that may factor into threat 
assessments of the area of operations.

1-23. CBRN staff members are encouraged to utilize Department of Army Intelligence Information Systems
and the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) OE Data Integration Network
(ODIN) Web site to conduct a thorough intelligence analysis in support of R&S planning. Additional
information for the Marine Corps through the Marine Corps Intelligence Agency is available at the Intel link
Web site. Resources available to the Air Force are the Intelink Web site and the local installation Intel Flight
or Office of Special Investigations detachment. CBRN R&S should always integrate all-source intelligence
analysis into planning to inform and answer CCIRs or to direct capabilities toward answering PIRs.
SUPPORT TO FIRES 
1-24. The fires warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that create and converge effects in all
domains against the adversary or enemy to enable operations across the range of military operations. (ADP
3-0) It includes tasks associated with integrating and synchronizing the effects of the types of fires with the
effects of other warfighting functions. CBRN R&S is most closely nested with the fires warfighting function
through the operations and targeting processes.
1-25. During the course of operations, CBRN R&S may identify high-payoff targets (HPTs). A high-payoff
target is a target whose loss to the enemy will significantly contribute to the success of the friendly course of
action. (JP 3-60) CBRN-specific HPTs are targets that could significantly shape the OE by degrading the
enemy’s freedom of action, enabling friendly forces, or preventing the use or access to CBRN, including
TIMs and other WMD or supporting networks or items. CBRN HPTs are not limited to CBRN-dedicated
weapon systems or stockpiles of CBRN agents or materials; however, they may include personnel, C2
systems, or logistical stockpiles.

1-6
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
1-26. CBRN-specific HPTs are differentiated from other targets due to their operational or strategic
importance, including increased risk to friendly forces, destructive effects on strategic or operationally key
terrain, and unique mitigation requirements. CBRN HPTs are identified and prioritized, driving the
development of reconnaissance and targeting guidance and the allocation of reconnaissance and fire assets
against prioritized targets. Through the joint targeting cycle or Service-specific targeting procedures,
subsequent decisions are made on how to engage the target to meet the desired effect. (See
ATP 3-60 or JP 3-60 for more information.) Targeting working groups analyze CBRN HPTs and develop
options to engage them. The options to engage CBRN targets include the full range of air or surface fires,
electromagnetic warfare, and cyber operations.
1-27. CBRN HPTs should be templated in time and space that is consistent with the latest known reporting
requirements (such as assembly, staging, transportation, and maintenance), enemy doctrines and practices,
and assessed enemy COAs. Target areas of interest are the geographical area where high-value targets can
be acquired and engaged by friendly forces. (JP 2-01.3) By providing CBRN HPTs to the targeting group
and emplacing target areas of interest during planning capabilities, the opportunity for fires or aviation assets
to interdict CBRN attacks increases dramatically. Extreme caution should be exercised when targeting
CBRN/WMD facilities, stockpiles of bulk materials, or large weapons stores because the consequence of
execution could create a significant downwind hazard that might affect local populations or friendly forces.
1-28. The targeting process is used to identify, target, and exploit sensitive sites. It is analogous to, and can
be embedded in, the process used by a fires cell in planning, preparing, and executing other time-sensitive or
HPTs. Information collected from effective tactical site exploitation and technical exploitation supports
follow-on operations and targeting and enhances force protection. For example, conducting a cordon and
search or raid supported by CBRN R&S capabilities can produce information and intelligence that facilitates
subsequent attacks targeting threat networks (see ATP 3-90.15).
SUPPORT TO MOVEMENT AND MANEUVER 
1-29. CBRN R&S capabilities are force multipliers that maneuver units throughout all phases of operations,
providing early warning and situational awareness under CBRN conditions. Throughout operations, CBRN
R&S elements are placed in the appropriate command/support relationships, in consideration of threat
reporting and weighting maneuver formations according to the commander’s intent.
1-30. CBRN R&S supports the offense as part of a larger maneuver force or as a specialty unit directed by
their respective headquarters. These assets, which are normally organized, allocated, and assigned at the
platoon level, primarily perform information collection tasks directed at CBRN PIRs.
1-31. During defensive operations, CBRN R&S capabilities are assigned to deep and close areas to answer
specific CBRN PIRs about enemy COAs. CBRN capabilities in friendly support areas monitor key lines of
communication and logistics or sustainment nodes, including aerial ports of debarkation (APODs) and
seaports of debarkation (SPODs).
1-32. CBRN R&S capabilities may provide early warning of CBRN attacks to the force. They allow
maneuver units to rapidly exploit CBRN environments. CBRN R&S forces operate within the supporting
range (within the maximum effective range of direct-fire systems) of maneuver elements to ensure that they
are not quickly destroyed by the first engagement with the enemy.
1-33. Some CBRN R&S forces are capable of performing general reconnaissance, security, and tactical
enabling tasks, such as route reconnaissance and the forward passage of lines. The ability to provide unit
freedom of action increases with the amount of training and exercise integration with CBRN capabilities and
the supported maneuver element. CBRN R&S forces execute local security for themselves, but they are more
vulnerable to direct fires. As the forward line of troops (FLOT) advances and defeats enemy forces, small
pockets of resistance may be bypassed or left behind. CBRN weapons caches, underground facilities (UGF),
and WMD production facilities may be seized and require follow-on CBRN assessment or exploitation
support by CBRN R&S forces. For example, CWMD task forces conduct small-scale control, defeat, disable,
and dispose activities to defeat enemy protracted CBRN activities. Special reconnaissance of CBRN targets
of interest may include site exploitation. If the tactical situation dictates, special reconnaissance may be
conducted by follow-on forces.

1-7
Note. Combined Arms CWMD operations at the tactical level are described in ATP 3-90.40. 
SUPPORT TO PROTECTION 
1-34. In joint operations, protection is the preservation of the effectiveness and survivability of mission-
related military and nonmilitary personnel, equipment, facilities, information, and infrastructure deployed or
located within or outside the boundaries of a given operational area. (JP 3-0) Protection efforts must consider
and account for threats and hazards in all directions, at all times, and in all environments. Protection integrates 
all protection capabilities to safeguard the force, personnel (combatants and noncombatants), systems, and
physical assets of the United States and its mission partners. In addition to the primary protection task,
commanders and staffs must coordinate, synchronize, and integrate additional protection capabilities and
resources of unified action partners. The protection warfighting function enables the commander to maintain
force integrity and combat power and mitigate risk to mission success.
1-35. Protection is a unique warfighting function because its tasks and systems have a collaborative and
cumulative effect on actions across the levels of war and range of military operations. Service members
conduct CBRN and non-CBRN tasks that contribute to the overall protection effort across a wide range of
formations and echelons. Information collected by CBRN R&S operations is vital to overall protection
efforts. Although primarily a protection function, the reconnaissance objectives for CBRN R&S and other
reconnaissance organizations are frequently close or have the same objectives; therefore, CBRN R&S
capabilities are usually task-organized to direct support of maneuver formations and support formations that
are assigned maneuver tasks as their primary tasks.
1-36. CBRN R&S supports protection efforts by providing information on the scale, location, and type of
CBRN strikes or TIM releases. CBRN surveillance throughout the AO enables rapid mitigation efforts to
protect friendly forces. CBRN R&S complements maneuver reconnaissance efforts in the recon/counter
reconnaissance fight, disrupting enemy targeting processes in the near fight while enabling friendly
movement and maneuver to disrupt, degrade, and destroy enemy capabilities, to include CBRN-capable
weapon systems.
1-37. Protection is a collaborative function that is reliant on both lateral and vertical coordination to execute
comprehensive, integrated, layered, redundant, and enduring protection. CBRN staff members and CBRN
R&S leaders must be cognizant of the support that CBRN R&S provides to protection activities. They must
also contribute to the holistic execution of protection through actions, such as—

Supporting JIPOE, including projected enemy courses of action.

Supporting the development of protection priorities, critical asset and defended asset lists, and
protection plans.

Coordinating protection with partners.
1-38. The above actions drive information requirements. Reconnaissance will later validate the information
requirements.
SUPPORT TO SUSTAINMENT 
1-39. Robust sustainment capabilities are vital to the expeditionary, maneuver-centric manner in which U.S.
forces fight. CBRN R&S supports sustainment efforts by conducting reconnaissance of potential logistic sites 
and routes, enabling the rapid establishment of support areas and contingency plans for alternate sites. CBRN
R&S operations support situational awareness throughout the AO with respect to reported contamination,
enabling route selection for logistic movement. CBRN R&S operations further support logistics by providing
additional information on the type of CBRN hazard, thereby enabling medical treatment and medical support
operations.

ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
1-40. CBRN R&S elements play a role in the strategically vital task of theater entry by supporting
APOD/SPOD openings, allowing the buildup of combat power and logistics to execute theater campaign
plans. Historically, theater entry is a period of high risk for enemy employment of CBRN weaponry to prevent 
the establishment of significant friendly combat power.
1-41. CBRN R&S enables mobility and, where possible, supports the reconnaissance/counterreconnaissance
fight and the fires/counterfight. Establishing friendly dominance in these areas disrupts and degrades the
enemy fires operations and capabilities, reducing the risk to sustainment operations throughout the AO.
SUPPORT TO INFORMATION 
1-42. In joint operations, information encompasses the management and application of information,
integrating information with other functions to change or maintain perceptions, attitudes, and other elements
that drive desired behaviors and support decision making. The human and automated systems whose behavior 
the commander wants to affect are referred to as relevant actors; these individuals, groups, populations, or
systems can help or hinder the success of an operation.
1-43. The information aspect of the suspected or confirmed use of CBRN weaponry can easily cause changes
in the OE that far exceed the OE impacts of a conventional weapon system employment with equal or greater
destructive or lethal effects. CBRN weapons can create strategic and political-level challenges through
relatively limited employment.
1-44. In a complex and ambiguous OE, the attribution of CBRN use becomes very difficult, especially if
deployed in an unconventional manner or by a proxy force supported by an aggressive deception campaign.
An opposing force that is willing to violate international norms and conventions may see great opportunities
in using CBRN weapons—specifically if they can be used to overwhelm government and civilian systems.
1-45. Effective CBRN strikes on friendly forces can demoralize troops, resulting in panic and a loss of
confidence in the ability of their unit to defeat enemy forces. Historically, even disciplined troops have
panicked and fled CBRN attacks after withstanding significant conventional combat. Psychosomatic
casualties can overwhelm medical support, and service members may refuse to cross potentially
contaminated terrain or leave positions of relative security.
1-46. The threat of CBRN attacks on civilian areas may be used to disrupt logistic activity, clog ground lines
of communication, overwhelm resources that support friendly military operations, and achieve strategic
effects by challenging civilian support of allied objectives in the AO. Enemy information activities directed
toward achieving such objectives could amplify the civilian population’s fear of CBRN strikes.
1-47. Two key ways in which CBRN R&S provides information support to friendly forces are by enhancing
the commander’s understanding of the OE and bolstering the confidence of friendly forces through accurate
and timely reporting on the scope and scale of the CBRN hazard. This information enables maneuver and
fires to counterattack, demonstrating that friendly forces can operate through and retaliate against enemy
CBRN attacks. CBRN R&S supports friendly information activities by enabling conclusive attribution of
CBRN attacks to enemy forces, capitalizing on global condemnation of CBRN usage to influence adversary
perceptions and behavior. These capabilities, coupled with support to operational and strategic tasks designed
to attribute responsibility for WMD employment, contribute to the information warfighting function by
influencing adversary perceptions and behavior.
RELEVANCE TO CBRN FUNCTIONS 
1-48. CBRN core functions are assess, protect, and mitigate and the integrating activity of hazard awareness
and understanding. CBRN R&S principally relates to the CBRN assess function, but it also mutually supports
the protect and mitigate functions. Operational environment is the composite of the conditions,
circumstances, and influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the
commander. (JP 3-0)
1-49. The assess function encompasses all of the capabilities to evaluate the potential for CBRN threats and
hazards in the OE, detect and model CBRN hazards, and determine the characteristics and parameters of
hazards throughout the OE that bear on operational and tactical decisions. Tasks conducted in the assess

ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
1-9
function provide necessary information for making proactive decisions in the OE. Through information 
collection and dissemination, CBRN R&S provides hazard awareness and understanding, allowing the 
commander to make proactive, risk-based decisions. The assess function addresses the progression of CBRN 
capabilities, from sensing hazards to assessing them at a distance to enable freedom of maneuver. 
1-50. CBRN R&S enables the protect function by providing the commander with an understanding of threats
and hazards within the AO, facilitating sufficient protective posture, and enabling freedom of maneuver.
1-51. CBRN R&S enables the mitigation function by correctly identifying the hazards, marking them to
prevent cross contamination, identifying the extent of the contamination, and determining the presence on
personnel and equipment before and after decontamination operations. Health surveillance (medical
surveillance and occupational and environmental health) also enables the protection function by advising
commanders on the health risks of CBRN hazards and medical countermeasures.
Note. See AFMAN 10-2503 and FM 3-11 for more information on CBRN functions. 
CBRN RECONNAISSANCE OPERATIONS 
1-52. CBRN reconnaissance are those missions undertaken to obtain, by visual observation or other detection 
methods, information on the suspected or confirmed chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats and
hazards in an AO. It is performed to support the commander’s situational understanding. CBRN
reconnaissance can provide a range of capabilities—from confirming or denying the presence of CBRN
hazards to exploitation tasks. The capabilities required are driven by the priorities’ dictated information
requirements, requirements of the supported maneuver command, engagement/disengagement criteria, and
tempo of operations. CBRN reconnaissance is a focused collection effort. It is performed in support of
operations to provide information used in the intelligence preparation of the OE/IPB process and in support
of the commander’s ability to formulate, confirm, or modify the COA.
SUPPORT OF LARGE-SCALE COMBAT OPERATIONS 
1-53. The enemy employment of CBRN relies on mechanisms and processes similar to conventional fires
and effects. Weapon systems still require transportation, staging, placement, targeting, and employment.
CBRN reconnaissance elements must be capable of integrating with and supporting the
reconnaissance/counterreconnaissance fight, shaping the battlespace, and denying the enemy the opportunity
to most effectively employ weapon systems.
1-54. CBRN reconnaissance efforts in counterinsurgency operations have focused on postdelivery
assessment without a significant tactical threat. CBRN reconnaissance in support of LSCO may be executed
in a high-threat environment, often in close vicinity to enemy forces with air capabilities and long-range fires.
CBRN reconnaissance capabilities include specialized technologies and skills to collect CBRN information
requirements, facilitating situational understanding to support follow-on decision-making efforts. They may
also collect against other relevant information requirements.
1-55. CBRN reconnaissance efforts—from the individual Service member and section conducting actions
on the objective to staff cells at theater and higher headquarters—must seamlessly integrate their unique
technical capabilities and subject-matter expertise with the reconnaissance executed by CBRN R&S capable
forces. Identifying the unique attributes of enemy activities associated with staging CBRN weapons and
disrupting the deployment and targeting required support the disruption of enemy threat capabilities.
SUPPORT TO DISTRIBUTED OPERATIONS 
1-56. Distributed operations describe an operating approach that requires new ways in which to educate and
train forces and guide forces in the use of emerging technologies, enabling small units to function with greater
operational initiative and independence. Adaptive enemies and a more complex environment are thought to
require conventional forces to maintain the ability to decentralize decision making and distribute forces. The
overarching goal of distributed operations is to maximize a commander’s ability to employ tactical units

across the depth and breadth of a nonlinear battlespace while creating an advantage over an adversary through 
the deliberate use of separate, coordinated, and interdependent actions. 
1-57. Greater force distribution, necessitated by the development of adversary long-range precision fires,
increases the likelihood of simultaneous, geographically distinct encounters with CBRN hazards. Compared
to LSCO, distributed forces must remain agile and highly mobile, requiring smaller footprints and reduced
sustainment burdens. CBRN R&S, in the form of task-organized CBRN enablers deployed forward with
distributed forces, enables rapid confirmation (or denial) of suspected CBRN hazards. This influences
immediate tactical and follow-on actions, such as force protection, scheme of maneuver planning, and
resource allocation decisions.
PRINCIPLES OF RECONNAISSANCE 
1-58. The CBRN fundamentals of reconnaissance, nested with the Army principles of reconnaissance,
include the following:

Ensure continuous CBRN reconnaissance. CBRN reconnaissance is conducted before, during,
and after operations. Before an operation, CBRN reconnaissance focuses on filling information
gaps about an adversary’s CBRN capabilities, specific hazard considerations, and the terrain.
During an operation, CBRN reconnaissance focuses on providing the commander updated CBRN
information that verifies the presence of hazards. This information may include the location, type,
persistence, extent, and other characteristics that may support situational understanding of the
hazard. This provides commanders confirmation of which enemy course of action has been
selected and whether or not the current friendly course of action is valid based on events in the
OE. After an operation, CBRN R&S focuses on providing situational awareness regarding the
area, extent, and duration of CBRN threats and hazards in the AO for planning forward movement,
subsequent CBRN mitigation, and CWMD operations. CBRN R&S facilitates understanding of
the extent and duration of hazards that impact the lines of communication and operations and
affects operational reach and operational tempo. Through the surveying of decontamination
operations, friendly units can quickly identify, segregate, decontaminate, and reconstitute combat
power. Providing CBRN reconnaissance over extended distances and in multiple unit areas of
operation requires unity of effort, to include synchronization across unit lines of communication,
clear unit boundaries, and sustainment planning. The commander must determine where and when
the maximum CBRN reconnaissance effort is required to pace the commitment of CBRN R&S
forces.

Do not keep reconnaissance assets in reserve. To provide layered, integrated, and echeloned
coverage, CBRN reconnaissance assets should not be kept in reserve. Units maintained in the
reserve are not responsive enough to answer CCIRs and retain the initiative. When committed,
CBRN reconnaissance assets are applied in an economy of force to maximize coverage. CBRN
staffs must understand and synchronize the relationship between asset availability, coverage area,
operational reach, and operational need to achieve the maximum effect of CBRN R&S. At times,
this requires commanders to withhold or position CBRN reconnaissance assets so that they are
available at critical times and places. CBRN reconnaissance cannot be appropriately achieved
when CBRN reconnaissance capabilities have been placed in the reserve. However, CBRN
reconnaissance assets should be treated as committed assets with specific, assigned missions.

Orient on the reconnaissance objective. Commanders orient their reconnaissance assets by
identifying a reconnaissance objective in the AO. The reconnaissance objective is a terrain feature, 
geographic area, enemy force, adversary, or other mission or operational variable about which the
commander wants to obtain additional information. (ADP 3-90) For CBRN reconnaissance, this
applies to focusing sensors and assets on the critical, prioritized NAIs first, before cuing on
secondary NAIs that support the scheme of maneuver during the current phase of operation.

Report information rapidly and accurately. CBRN reconnaissance assets must acquire and
report accurate and timely information on CBRN threats and hazards and other relevant
information observed while performing their principle task of CBRN reconnaissance. Information
may quickly lose its value. CBRN R&S elements report exactly what they see and, if appropriate,
what they do not see. Seemingly unimportant information may be extremely important when
combined with other information. Negative reports should be forwarded to higher headquarters
Fundamentals

for review or collaboration because they may fill in gaps of the overall joint ISR picture. The 
CBRN R&S element uses communication protocols established in the supported unit standard 
operating procedure (SOP) to ensure timely and accurate information. CBRN R&S elements must 
have the proper communication equipment to support the integrated joint ISR.  

Retain freedom of action. CBRN reconnaissance assets must retain mobility to successfully
complete their missions. If CBRN forces are decisively engaged, CBRN reconnaissance stops and
they engage with direct fires, indirect fires, and close air support or they break contact. CBRN
reconnaissance forces must have a clear engagement criteria that supports the commander’s intent.
They must employ proper movement and CBRN reconnaissance techniques and use overwatching
fires and SOPs. Initiative and knowledge of the terrain and the adversary reduce the likelihood of
decisive engagement and help maintain freedom of movement. When conducting CBRN
reconnaissance, the CBRN R&S element adopts a combat formation designed to limit exposure to
CBRN hazards. This provides the R&S element the maximum opportunity to move across terrain
without the entire R&S element becoming contaminated. CBRN hazards are assessed by using a
sequential, progressive method that minimizes exposure to hazards and mitigates cross
contamination. CBRN R&S utilizes stand-off detection capabilities first. If more information is
required within the contamination area, unmanned remote systems monitor the NAI. CBRN R&S
personnel purposefully enter contaminated areas to assess threats and hazards when standoff or
unmanned capabilities are exhausted or when the terrain is restrictive. The JIPOE/IPB process can
identify anticipated CBRN hazard areas/locations.

Gain and maintain CBRN hazard understanding. When an R&S element conducting CBRN
reconnaissance detects or locates a CBRN hazard, it works to gather and maintain information
about the hazard for reporting to its higher headquarters. CBRN reconnaissance provides detailed
information about the risk associated with the hazard and provides the commander understanding
to make informed decisions. CBRN R&S, with sufficient CBRN hazard understanding, finds
routes that minimize cross contamination and expose assailable enemy flanks in offensive and
defensive operations.

Develop the situation rapidly. When a CBRN reconnaissance asset encounters a CBRN hazard,
it must quickly determine the threat it faces. CBRN R&S rapidly marks contamination and
develops bypass routes or seams in contamination to exploit the CBRN environment. For a new
CBRN hazard, it must determine the type of hazard, CCIR, and PIR relevance and assess the extent
of the hazard and its impacts on maneuver.

Integrate with and enable maneuver. CBRN R&S elements frequently integrate with maneuver
forces as an enabler to support decisive action. Marine Corps enhanced CBRN R&S sections are
organic to major subordinate commands and Marine expeditionary units. CBRN reconnaissance
operates in a capacity that, with dependencies from the supported unit, supports the higher
command’s mission. Maneuver elements integrate CBRN elements within their tactical formation
scheme of maneuver and provide area security for CBRN R&S during missions. CBRN
reconnaissance assets can conduct local security. The supported unit provides additional security
to CBRN reconnaissance assets within the supporting range. CBRN units do not own AOs, but
they maneuver through land-owning unit AOs to link up with and mutually support units. CBRN
reconnaissance provides detection and early warning of enemy CBRN-related activities, enabling
the commander’s decision-making process and exploitation of the CBRN environment to support
the commander’s decisions. During security operations, CBRN reconnaissance mutually supports
screens, guards, and cover forces within the scope of their capabilities.
1-59. The capability required is driven by the priorities dictated by the CCIR, supported maneuver command
requirements, engagement/disengagement criteria, and tempo of operations.
SPECIAL OPERATIONS RECONNAISSANCE 
1-60. The United States Army Special Operations Command possesses a limited capability to conduct CBRN
reconnaissance and detection. The Army common equipment issued to each unit is used to detect the presence
of most military chemical compounds and high levels of beta and gamma radiation. This equipment alerts
the unit to the presence of significant levels of military chemical compounds and radiation (which may show
false-positive readings) and maintains extremely high detection thresholds. Only the chemical reconnaissance
Chapter 1 
1-12
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
detachment, chemical decontamination detachment, and decontamination and reconnaissance team possess 
the specialized equipment and training to deliver a presumptive analysis of a potential CBRN substance. It is 
this presumptive analysis that provides the commander data of such quality that operational decisions can be 
made by relying on this data (see ATP 3-05.11 for more information).  
1-61. The United States Marine Forces Special Operations Command possesses a limited CBRN capability
that primarily employs dismounted reconnaissance sets, kits, and outfits to fulfill their CBRN R&S capability
conducted by Marine Forces Special Operations Command Explosive Ordnance Disposal (MARSOFEOD)
operators supported by critical skills operators and special operations officers. The dismounted
reconnaissance sets, kits, and outfits is located within the Marine Special Operations Company and is
distributed to the Marine Special Operations Team level, enabling operators to conduct short duration
chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) operations, as needed. The United
States Marine Forces Special Operations Command employs this capability with organic MARSOFEOD
operators, special operations capabilities specialist–EOD. MARSOFEOD operators are capable of providing
CBRNE/counter-WMD support via detect, locate, identify, triage, nonintrusive threat assessment, intrusive
threat assessment, and render-safe procedures for scenarios, including high-yield explosives, TIMs, chemical
and biological warfare agents, nuclear materials of concern, and suspected WMDs. The MARSOFEOD
operators are trained to conduct CBRNE threat mitigation against state-sponsored laboratories, conventional
weapons, improvised weapons, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). This mitigation includes special
reconnaissance techniques, threat assessments, render-safe procedures, leak seals, and the packaging of
ordnance and CBRNE-contaminated devices and containers (see MCO 3571.2H for more information).
1-62. Special reconnaissance (SR) is the reconnaissance and surveillance actions conducted as a special
operation in hostile, denied, or diplomatically and/or politically sensitive environments to collect or verify
information of strategic or operational significance, employing military capabilities not normally found in
conventional forces. (JP 3-05) Special reconnaissance provides an additional capability with the collection
of more refined information. Special reconnaissance may also include an assessment of chemical, biological,
residual radiological, or environmental hazards in a denied area (see JP 3-05 for more information). Special
reconnaissance missions can help obtain information that was previously unknown, or they can help refute
or confirm specific information about a target that does not necessarily fall under the category of surveillance.
Examples of these types of special reconnaissance missions include CBRNE agent confirmation; soil, water,
or air surveys or samplings; mute reconnaissance drop zone or landing zone surveys; and any other specific
data requirements. In most instances, such a mission is limited to the specific data or indicators required.
Often, these missions require the operational detachment ALPHA to conduct mission-specific skill training
or to accept augmentation by nonspecial forces subject matter experts (SMEs). Augmentation may entail a
CBRNE team, topographic or civil engineers, and EOD or scientific specialists (such as toxicologists or
meteorologists). When enablers (attached or organic) conduct a mission, special permission training is
required for both the operational detachment ALPHA and the augmenters. Regardless of the brand of enablers
(attached or organic), the operational detachment ALPHA is responsible for safe infiltration, security,
exfiltration, and reactions to contingencies. Specialists focus on their specialty, whereas the operational
detachment ALPHA supports them (see ATP 3-18.4 for more information).
Note. See ATP 3-05.11 and ATP 3-18.4 for more information on special operations forces CBRN 
and SR. 
RECONNAISSANCE-PULL VERSUS RECONNAISSANCE-PUSH 
1-63. Reconnaissance-pull is reconnaissance that determines which routes are suitable for maneuver, where
the enemy is strong and weak, and where gaps exist, thus pulling the main body toward and along the path
of least resistance. This facilitates the commander’s initiative and agility. (FM 3-90-2) The commander uses
the products of the IPB process in an interactive and repetitive way. The commander obtains combat
information from available reconnaissance assets to determine a preferred course of action for the tactical
situation presented by the mission variables of mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support
available, time available, civil considerations (METT-TC), or mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops
and support available-time available (METT-T). CBRN reconnaissance in support of offensive operations in
the deep and close area are usually reconnaissance-pull focused. They rapidly identify CBRN hazards and

mark only minimum essential areas to provide the maneuver commander flexibility and tempo to exploit the 
environment to their force’s relative advantage. 
1-64. Reconnaissance-push is reconnaissance that refines the common operational picture, enabling the
commander to finalize the plan and support shaping and decisive operations. It is normally used once the
commander commits to a scheme of maneuver or course of action (FM 3-90-2). The commander uses the
products of the IPB process in an interactive way with combat information from reconnaissance assets in
support of a COA. The main reason for preferring one method over the other is the time available. CBRN
reconnaissance-push operations are executed to refine information regarding CBRN hazards, provide
sufficient data to target enemy CBRN and delivery capabilities, or conduct CWMD missions.
1-65. CBRN reconnaissance operations involving the exploitation of sensitive sites fall underneath the
subcategory of special reconnaissance. Even with long-range sensors, unmanned platforms, and aerial
platforms, some CBRN-specific information can only be obtained via direct visual observation or other
collection methods. CBRN enablers can be paired with special operations forces or task-organized maneuver
forces in a CWMD role. CBRN site exploitation falls under the subcategory of poststrike reconnaissance as
described in JP 3-05. Site exploitation is described in greater detail in ATP 3-90.15.
CBRN SURVEILLANCE OPERATIONS 
1-66. CBRN surveillance is systematic observation used to confirm the initial and continued presence of
CBRN hazards. CBRN surveillance facilitates situational understanding and maintenance of an accurate,
high-fidelity, real-time picture of the OE as changes occur. When complimented by CBRN surveillance, all-
source intelligence analysis provides a more complete assessment to assist commanders with their decision
making. CBRN surveillance contributes to broader biosurveillance activities, supporting the timely detection
of health-related hazards that impact the availability of combat power.
1-67. The principles of CBRN surveillance include—

Maintaining continuous CBRN surveillance on CBRN NAIs. Once the CBRN surveillance of
an NAI commences, CBRN surveillance must be maintained until the mission is completed or
terminated by the higher commander. Commanders designate to whom the CBRN information
will be reported and the means of communication that will be used. Continuous CBRN
surveillance of NAIs requires multiple collection assets, a purpose (PIRs), and a location (NAI or
TAI) for each CBRN capability. To provide layered, integrated, and echeloned coverage, CBRN
surveillance is not kept in reserve. During information collection synchronization, CBRN
collection capabilities that can best answer the CBRN-specific PIRs are selected. During
integration, specific capabilities are tasked to perform these missions by using the tools developed
during joint ISR synchronization to ensure continuous coverage.

Avoiding designating too many CBRN NAIs. Continuous CBRN surveillance suffers as a result
of excessive NAIs. Coordinators for surveillance assets should be present at joint ISR rehearsals
to determine the appropriate tasking and ability to cover particular NAIs. CBRN staffs should
provide CBRN surveillance assets a clear priority of NAIs by phase and change-of-mission
requirements.

Providing continuous observation before, during, and after operations. Within present
capabilities, commanders strive to maximize CBRN capabilities—including processing and
analyzing—to provide persistent observation before, during, and after operations. Before initial
entry into a theater of operations, national assets are the major sources of CBRN information.
Once in the AO, CBRN surveillance is deployed as early as possible to help focus CBRN
reconnaissance efforts and provide early warning. During operations, CBRN surveillance supports
target acquisition and contamination area boundaries and discovers information that cues CBRN
reconnaissance, answers CBRN CCIRs, and assists the commander and staff in assessing
operations. CBRN surveillance helps search for remnants of adversary CBRN capabilities or
activity and provides information to begin subsequent CBRN planning.

31 March 2021 

Orienting CBRN surveillance to provide early and accurate warning. One of the main
purposes of CBRN surveillance is to provide early warning of imminent CBRN hazards. Together
with JIPOE and IPB, commanders use CBRN surveillance to assess the most dangerous and most
probable threats and hazards and ascertain the most likely location or direction from which these
will come. They then orient CBRN surveillance assets to observe these locations for indicators of
threat to friendly forces. Reports about the enemy or adversary must be timely, relevant, and
accurate, with timely processing and dissemination. CBRN surveillance reports hazard indications
to the medical staff, decreasing distribution times for effective prophylaxis. Units employ internal
CBRN defense arrays to protect the force, especially at C2 and sustainment nodes.

Tracking and assessing key CBRN threats and hazards. CBRN surveillance support for
targeting includes tracking and assessing. Once a CBRN threat or hazard is detected, planning
cells must consider the need to maintain visibility on the hazard or to leverage fires to interdict a
CBRN attack before it is launched. Available intelligence and information collection abilities may
be used to provide direct observation and tracking of threats and hazards.

Providing continuous, redundant, and overlapping coverage on critical locations.
Commanders integrate the capabilities of limited CBRN surveillance assets to provide continuous
coverage of critical locations identified during planning. Commanders and staff continuously
assess CBRN surveillance results to determine changes in critical locations requiring this level of
coverage. The intelligence and operations staff work together to achieve balance in the use of
CBRN capabilities with cueing, mixing, and redundancy in an attempt to use limited assets most
effectively and collect the most critical information with the fewest assets as quickly as possible.

Cueing is the integration of one or more types of reconnaissance and surveillance systems to
provide information that directs follow-on collecting of more detailed information by another
system. (FM 3-90-2) Cueing helps to focus limited surveillance assets, especially limited
ground CBRN R&S, which can seldom closely examine every part of a large area or location.
Electronic, thermal, visual, audio, and other technical assets with wide-area surveillance
capabilities that often work from space or aerial platforms can quickly determine areas of
adversary concentration or areas in which there is no adversary presence. These assets may
cue ground and air reconnaissance assets to investigate specific locations to confirm and
amplify information developed by technical assets. For example, aerial capabilities can cover
large areas and cue CBRN ground reconnaissance or unmanned aerial systems (UASs) once
a CBRN hazard is identified. The commander may dispatch CBRN ground reconnaissance to
verify the information and mark the area, or he may dispatch a UAS to verify the information
for operational purposes. Similarly, a CBRN ground reconnaissance capability can cue CBRN
surveillance capabilities. The key point is to use CBRN reconnaissance assets based on their
capabilities and to use the complementary capabilities of other assets to verify and expand
available information.

Mixing is using two or more different assets to collect against the same intelligence
requirement. (FM 3-90-2) Mixing provides an increased probability of detection and
confidence. Employing a mix of systems not only increases the probability of detection, but
also tends to provide more complete information. For example, a standoff capability may
detect and locate a CBRN hazard while the intelligence analysis and control element uses
organic and supporting assets to determine its identity and threat to military forces and future
plans. Employing a mix of systems is always desirable if the situation and available resources
permit. Mixing systems can help uncover deception attempts by revealing discrepancies in
information reported by different CBRN teams.

1-15

Redundancy is using two or more like assets to collect against the same intelligence
requirement. (FM 3-90-2) Redundancy provides an increased probability of detection and
confidence. Based on the PIR, the commander must decide which NAI justifies having more
than one asset covering it. When more than one asset covers the same NAI, a backup is
available. In the event that one asset cannot reach the NAI in time, the first asset suffers
mechanical failure, or the adversary detects and engages the first asset, the backup asset is
used to address the gap in coverage. Redundancy improves the probability of detecting and
collecting the required information.

Reporting information rapidly and accurately. Commanders may base their planning and
tactical decisions on information obtained through CBRN surveillance efforts. Intelligence loses
its relevance as it ages. Commanders establish the latest time information is of value (LTIOV) to
guide timely reporting. The R&S element or other asset must accurately report what it observes,
and they must report it in a timely manner. Using digital systems speeds the process and assists in
accuracy, but the information should be redundantly reported with other systems to ensure rapid
dissemination using the CBRN Warning and Reporting System (CBRNWRS). Speed is critical
when conducting early warning and reporting of a CBRN incident.

Identification of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and 
Nuclear Hazards 
CBRN R&S operations provide commanders and staffs critical information concerning 
the identity, area/location, and duration of CBRN hazards to assist in situational 
understanding that enables the commander to make informed decisions. This chapter 
provides details on the DOD four-tier system for determining the identity of CBRN 
hazards and describes the difference in NATO levels of identification. The four 
identification levels are—presumptive, field confirmatory, theater validation, and 
definitive. This chapter discusses the implications of CBRN identification and 
describes the potential tactical-through-strategic decisions that may result.  
IDENTIFICATION LEVELS 
 CBRN hazard detection uses commonly fielded CBRN detectors distributed throughout the force to 
alert personnel to the presence of hazards and initiate immediate survival actions. Although these detections 
influence decisions, they are performed as a reactive action and do not constitute CBRN R&S. Commanders 
and staffs must assess the immediacy with which tactical decisions must be made based on the OE, 
operational tempo, and current situation. In some cases, the impacted unit continues operations in elevated 
protective posture; in other situations, a more formal assessment of the hazard, to confirm or deny its 
presence, is performed as a follow-on action by CBRN R&S forces.   
 CBRN hazard identification is the process of locating, recognizing, and describing CBRN hazards 
through information collection using intelligence, health surveillance, survey and sampling procedures, and 
analytical equipment. The detection of hazards is implied throughout all levels of identification. The 
confidence and quality of CBRN hazard identification will depend on the— 

Quality of information from the detection or analytical equipment.

Confirmation from different technologies’ methodology.

Analysis of supporting intelligence and indicators.

Training of individuals using the detector or sensor.

Time from release to detection.

Purity of the sample.

Environmental factors, such as a controlled laboratory versus a field environment.
The DOD uses four tiers to describe the different levels of identification that have the unique
characteristics of who, where, why, and how. The four levels of identification for CBRN hazards are— 

Presumptive.

Field confirmatory.

Theater validation.

Definitive.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION LEVELS 
 The DOD four-tiered identification levels are a sequential, scientifically rigorous means to positively 
identify CBRN and TIM hazards. (See figure 2-1, page 2-2.) The higher the level of identification completed 
on a CBRN hazard, the higher the confidence the command has that a CBRN attack or incident has occurred. 
Identification levels articulate the technology requirements, personnel, and training levels of those identifying

CBRN and TIM hazards and the location at which identification occurs. Technology has to meet the 
specificity, sensitivity, controls, and protocols to meet higher thresholds of identification levels. For specific 
technology requirements per identification level, refer to tables 2-1 to 2-4, pages 2-3 to 2-7.  
 Forces that can identify agents are stratified based on their purpose, level of training, available 
equipment, and capability to conduct sampling and analysis operations at the higher levels of identification. 
At the lowest level (presumptive), all forces have the equipment and training to conduct the basic level of 
identification. Technical forces are specially trained and equipped forces that possess a higher degree of 
CBRN detection and sampling capability compared to conventional forces. Specific examples of the technical 
forces that are able to provide field confirmatory identification are in table 2-2, page 2-6.  
 Even though some personnel may have the requisite knowledge and equipment sets to sample CBRN 
agents, they may not have the correct packing, transportation means, or emergency decontamination support 
to be able to collect samples for laboratory submission. A sample identified in a field environment may have 
other materials within it that can confuse the results of identification. A sample identified in a controlled 
laboratory environment will help reduce the influence of external factors on results; therefore, it is critical 
for commanders and staffs to recognize organizational CBRN identification capabilities and limitations 
during decision making.  
Notes. 
1. Samples may not require analysis at all identification levels, depending on the agent and the
decisions and actions taken after identification.
2. In figure 2-1, technical forces are specially trained and equipped forces that possess a higher
degree of CBRN detection and sampling capability compared to conventional forces.

PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION 
 Presumptive identification is the employment of technologies with limited specificity and 
sensitivity by all forces in a field environment to detect the presence of chemical, biological, 
radiological, and/or nuclear hazards with a low, but sufficient level of confidence to support immediate 
tactical decisions.  
 Presumptive identification is obtained by using a single, commonly fielded device, material, or 
technology available to all U.S. forces to provide initial indications of a CBRN threat or hazard presence 
within minutes to one hour of detection. It is one of the first steps in providing commanders and staffs hazard 
awareness and understanding and in initiating force protective measures against CBRN threats, such as 
increasing protective posture. It is the only level of identification that does not involve sampling and 
collection. Although using multiple technologies is not required to presumptively detect a hazard, it is highly 
encouraged to prevent false positives that quickly overwhelm unit resources. To prevent the higher risk of 
false-positive identification, it is imperative that units train frequently on detection equipment. Table 2-1 
provides further presumptive identification descriptors.

FIELD CONFIRMATORY IDENTIFICATION 
 Field confirmatory identification is the employment of technologies with increased specificity and 
sensitivity by technical forces in a field environment to identify chemical, biological, radiological, 
and/or nuclear hazards with a moderate level of confidence and the degree of certainty necessary to 
support follow-on tactical and operational decisions.  
 Field confirmatory identification is obtained by using two or more technologies (see table 2-2) that use 
different analysis processes and are available to specially trained personnel and units in a field environment. 
The analysis of information (symptoms, source, physical form, odor, intelligence on the enemy’s offensive 
CBRN capabilities, TIM facility intelligence) provides a higher degree of confidence in the identification of 
CBRN hazards. It may include the collection and analysis of samples, with the intent to find results within 
1–48 hours of detection.  
 Field confirmatory identification can be used to prove or disprove previous presumptive results. It 
results in higher confidence levels to support future operations. This may include follow-on tactical decisions 
to exploit CBRN environments, mitigate risk to forces, or pursue a higher level of identification by collecting 
evidence for attribution purposes. Table 2-2 provides further field confirmatory identification descriptors.

THEATER VALIDATION IDENTIFICATION 
 Theater validation identification is the employment of multiple independent, established protocols 
and technologies by scientific experts in the controlled environment of a fixed or mobile/transportable 
laboratory to characterize a chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear hazard with a high level 
of confidence and the degree of certainty necessary to support operational to strategic-level decisions.  
 Using accepted quality assurance measures, theater validation quantifies the CBRN sample. It provides 
additional, critical information to support timely and effective decisions regarding assessment, protection, 
and mitigation measures and medical prophylaxis and treatment for affected units and personnel within 
48–72 hours of detection. It can support preliminary attribution to implicate or support trace analytics for the 
source of the identified CBRN material. Table 2-3 provides further theater validation identification 
descriptors.

DEFINITIVE IDENTIFICATION 
 Definitive identification is the employment of multiple state-of-the-art, independent, established 
protocols and technologies by scientific experts in a nationally recognized laboratory to determine the 
unambiguous identity of a chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear hazard with the highest 
level of confidence and degree of certainty necessary to support strategic-level decisions.  
 Specific, quantified results—even at low levels with high data confidence and accuracy—are often the 
most critical data requirements at strategic decision-making levels. Definitive identification supports 
attribution to help implicate or point to the source of the identified material. It uses the highest level of quality 
assurance measures to achieve identification within 72 hours to 30 days of detection. The time-to-result may 
be the least-critical element. However, equipment sensitivity is significant at this level when given 
established requirements to identify and document exact hazard levels that pose potential acute or long-term 
health risks to forces and enable health surveillance. While some materiel solutions at tactical units can detect 
CBRN substances at extremely high sensitivity levels, laboratory-specific controls and higher-sensitivity 
materiel capabilities are needed to detect and identify low-level exposures to achieve the intent for strategic 
decisions and deployment health policies. Even if such exposures cannot be mitigated, if detected they can 
at least be appropriately documented per DODD 6490.02E and DODI 6490.03 requirements. Table 2-4 
provides further definitive identification descriptors.

CBRN IDENTIFICATION CONSIDERATIONS 
 The requirement for a specific command decision is the primary factor that determines the level of 
CBRN identification required for a sample. Additional factors that potentially influence the command staff 
as they determine the types and numbers of samples required and the level of CBRN analysis needed on each 
sample include— 

Higher identification levels that require support from low-density, highly-trained, technical CBRN
units or assets.

Higher identification levels that require more time to complete.

The command/support relationship with supported and supporting units.

CBRNWRS protocols.

The type of CBRN reconnaissance and/or surveillance mission that will be performed to equip the
R&S element with the right detection and identification devices.

Logistics support, sample transfer, and technical escort requirements.

Follow-on CBRN R&S missions.

Sample management and collection plan maintenance.
When there is a need to identify possible treaty violations, the collection of evidence and the analysis
of samples may require protocols that can withstand international scrutiny (procedures that establish a 
forensic trail). Although such evidence is required quickly, proof of the use of these agents must be so that it 
cannot be refuted. 
TACTICAL DECISIONS 
 Tactical leaders must make sound and timely decisions in the heat of combat. Immediate actions, such 
as increasing mission-oriented protective posture, immediate decontamination, and self/buddy aid, are 
performed without prompting upon recognizing the employment, presence, or effects of CBRN agents. These 
actions are essential to protecting the force and are performed within seconds of recognizing CBRN hazard 
indicators.  
 Timely information, in the order of minutes to hours, is needed in tactical decision making. Tactical 
decisions are divided into two categories—immediate and follow-on. 
 Immediate tactical decisions build on immediate actions taken and address immediate force protection 
requirements and maneuver decisions that seek to exploit the CBRN environment to maintain an advantage 
over the adversary. Immediate tactical decisions are not risk-averse; instead, they seek to exploit immediate 
tactical opportunities. Examples of immediate tactical decisions include— 

The employment of the CBRNWRS to warn units.

Tactical dispersion and contamination avoidance requirements.

The evacuation and treatment of casualties.

Additional medical resources.

Maneuver decisions that allow units to retain the initiative (for example, changing from a frontal
attack to an envelopment around a chemically contaminated area).

The execution of immediate decontamination procedures.

The employment of contamination mitigation equipment and/or strategies to limit the
contamination of personnel and equipment operating in the contaminated area.
 Follow-on tactical decisions are required when the technical force identification capability is required 
to exploit CBRN environments and mitigate risk to forces. Follow-on tactical decision examples include— 

Confirming or denying CBRN protection required for follow-on and flow-through forces.

Task-organizing CBRN teams with specialized equipment and training.

Establishing the length/duration of the stay time in a contaminated environment.

Making decisions to exploit known or suspected WMD sites.

Meeting requirements to detect and analyze a broader range of hazards, including traditional
chemical warfare agents, TIMs, and nontraditional agents.

OPERATIONAL DECISIONS 
 At the operational level of warfare, campaigns and major operations are planned, conducted, and 
sustained to achieve strategic objectives within theaters or other operational areas. The operational level links 
the tactical employment of forces to national strategic objectives. At this level, CBRN defense-related 
decisions include, but are not limited to— 

The verification of hazard reduction so that troops can reduce, modify, or eliminate the mission-
oriented protective posture level.

The commitment of a specially trained and equipped task-organized formation to support site
exploitation, including forensics for evidence and attribution in pursuit of CWMD objectives.

Contamination mitigation, including contamination control and decontamination.

Revisions or updates to operational exposure guidance (OEG).

Coordination with local or host-nation emergency first responders to mitigate hazards.

The logistics and planning of casualty evacuation.

Continuous monitoring and surveillance of deployed personnel for emerging or routine
environmental hazards.

Coordination with medical personnel to administer pre- or postexposure medical countermeasures
or treatment.

Meeting clearance decontamination verification and requirements.
STRATEGIC DECISIONS 
 The strategic level of warfare is the level at which a nation determines national or multinational 
strategic security objectives and then develops and uses national resources to achieve those objectives. 
Strategic decision making requires the highest standards of intelligence fidelity and accuracy. CBRN defense-
related applications and decisions at the strategic level include, but are not limited to— 

Strategic-level deterrence decisions.

The commitment of CWMD task forces or multinational CBRN capabilities for support to rear
areas to conduct site exploitation, including forensics for evidence and attribution.

Forensic analysis of collected evidence for attribution purposes.

The identification of agent variants that require different treatment protocols.

Chapter 3 
Planning Activities 
This chapter focuses on joint ISR planning activities and the key aspects and challenges 
of integrating CBRN information requirements and CBRN R&S elements into the 
joint ISR plan or information collection plan. Whether being executed by CBRN R&S 
leadership or by CBRN staff within a maneuver or intelligence unit, CBRN R&S 
planning is not an isolated effort; it is a subordinate aspect of planning for the supported 
maneuver command that is carried out by CBRN staff and the CBRN R&S leader. This 
chapter describes key considerations that must be addressed to ensure that CBRN R&S 
is complementary to, and synchronized with, other collection efforts. The demand for 
intelligence almost always exceeds the capability of available information collection 
assets. CBRN staffs work with intelligence staff collection managers and the 
operations section to ensure the best use of limited CBRN R&S assets. A good ISR 
plan must fit into and support the overall operations plan. As it is developed from the 
initial commander’s guidance through the operations process, it is never an isolated 
effort; instead, it is synchronized within the overall collection and targeting efforts. The 
CBRN ISR plan positions and tasks CBRN R&S elements so they can collect the right 
information while sustaining or reconstituting them for follow-on operations. Plans 
must be flexible enough to handle shifts in priorities and to support branches and 
sequels, as required by the commander. This chapter provides critical planning 
fundamentals, the CBRN R&S planning process, CBRN R&S planning for large-scale 
combat operations, and special considerations for planning.  
ROLE OF THE COMMANDER 
3-1.  The commander’s objective is to gain and maintain a position of relative advantage against adaptive,
capable, and determined enemies. Timely and accurate information provided by R&S operations is critical
to allowing commanders to execute effective mission command. Commanders use the information gained
from R&S operations to modify existing plans, develop new plans, and reallocate assets as they refine their
direction, leadership, and assessment of reconnaissance and other operations.
3-2. Mission command is the conduct of military operations through decentralized execution based upon
mission-type orders. (JP 3-31) Mission command requires visualizing the current situation and the desired
end state and formulating an operational approach and concept of operations that are feasible, acceptable,
and suitable in terms of available forces, the risk to forces and the mission, and operational and strategic
guidance. Commanders and staffs use mission command by allowing and encouraging prompt action in
uncertain environments. Commanders must recognize that tactical opportunities are brief moments that can
only be seized and exploited by the subordinate leader at the point of action. Mission command is based on
(and builds the mutual trust and shared understanding between) commanders, staffs, subordinates, and
partners. The principles of mission command are competence, mutual trust, shared understanding, the
commander’s intent, mission orders, disciplined initiative, and risk acceptance.
3-3. The nature of military operations requires decisiveness at the point of action. Leaders should adapt
their thinking, formation, and employment techniques to the specific situation they face. Agile, adaptive, and
aggressive reconnaissance help develop the situation to set the conditions for future success.
3-4. CBRN leaders and staffs enable the supported commander’s exercise of mission command by
developing information requirements and indicators, supporting the task organization of reconnaissance
Chapter 3 
3-2
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
assets immediately upon receipt of the commander’s guidance. CBRN R&S elements take action to develop 
the situation; answer information requirements; identify, create, and exploit opportunities; anticipate change; 
and coordinate without requiring new orders. 
THE OPERATIONS PROCESS 
3-5. Commanders and staffs use the operations process to integrate tasks executed by organic and attached
reconnaissance formations. CBRN R&S is a unique capability that is often not fully understood by maneuver
leadership. As a result, units are frequently task-organized rather than employed as organic formations. It is
imperative that CBRN R&S leaders and staffs are proactive at all phases of the operation process and that
they seek collaboration with supported, higher, and adjacent units. In addition to the principles of mission
command, commanders and staffs consider the following principles for the effective employment of the
operations process:

Commanders drive the operations process.

Commanders and staffs collaborate to plan, prepare, execute, and assess operations.

Commanders and staffs build and maintain situational understanding.

Commanders and staffs encourage collaboration and dialogue.
3-6. Commanders drive the operations process. While the staff performs essential functions that amplify
the effectiveness of operations, the commander is ultimately responsible for accomplishing assigned
missions. Commanders encourage disciplined initiative through a clear commander’s intent while providing
enough direction to integrate and synchronize the force during decisive phases of the operation.
3-7. Understanding is fundamental to the commander’s ability to establish the context of a situation. As
part of the information collection efforts, reconnaissance operations are indispensable to building and
improving the commander’s understanding of the situation. As commanders refine their understanding, they
must quickly formulate the CCIRs and keep them current, determine where to place key personnel, and
arrange for liaison teams to contribute further toward improving their understanding.
3-8. As commanders begin to understand their OE and the tactical problem, they visualize potential
solutions and their desired end state. The commander’s visualization is the mental process of developing
situational understanding, determining a desired end state, and envisioning an operational approach through
which the force will achieve that end state. Assigning reconnaissance formations, including CBRN R&S
elements, to collect the most pressing information requirements provides early situational understanding and
provides the basis for developing plans and orders.
3-9. After commanders visualize an operation, they describe it to their staffs and subordinates to facilitate
shared understanding and purpose. During planning, commanders ensure that subordinates understand their
visualization well enough to begin course-of-action development. During execution, continuous
reconnaissance and security tasks influence the commander’s visualization. The commander describes
modifications to their visualization in updated planning guidance and directives. These modifications result
in fragmentary orders that adjust the unit mission. Commanders describe their visualization in doctrinal
terms, refining and clarifying their visualization as circumstances require. Commanders express their
visualization in terms of—

The commander’s intent.

Planning guidance.

CCIRs.

Essential element of friendly information (EEFI).

Reconnaissance guidance.
3-10. Commander’s intent is a clear and concise expression of the purpose of the operation and the desired
military end state that supports mission command, provides focus to the staff, and helps subordinate and
supporting commanders act to achieve the commander’s desired results without further orders, even when
the operation does not unfold as planned. (JP 3-0) For reconnaissance operations, the commander’s intent
statement describes what constitutes success for the reconnaissance operation. This intent statement also
includes the purpose, key tasks, and conditions that define the end state. Intent links the mission, concept of
operations, and tasks to subordinate units. A clear commander’s intent facilitates a shared understanding and

ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44

focuses on the overall conditions that represent mission accomplishment. The commander’s intent must be 
easy to remember and clearly understood by commanders and staffs two echelons lower in the chain of 
command. The more concise the commander’s intent, the easier it is to recall and understand.  
3-11. When describing the expanded purpose of the reconnaissance operation, the commander’s intent does
not restate the "why" of the mission statement. Rather, it addresses the broader purpose of the operation and
its relationship to the force as a whole. (Often, incorporating how the operation relates to one or more of the
fundamentals of reconnaissance can clearly convey the expanded purpose of an operation.)
3-12. Commanders provide planning guidance to the staff based on their visualization of the current
situation, their experience, and their professional military judgment. Planning guidance uses context, clarity,
and key details to reflect how the commander sees the operation unfolding. It broadly describes when, where,
and how the commander intends to employ combat power to accomplish the mission within the higher
commander’s intent. Broad and general guidance give staffs and subordinate leaders maximum latitude,
allowing subordinate echelon staffs to develop flexible and effective options in parallel, simultaneous, and
complimentary efforts. Reconnaissance leaders must clearly understand the commander’s planning guidance
so they know what and when to report as they identify combat information, fill information gaps, and answer
PIRs.
3-13. Based on their initial understanding of the OE and tactical situation, commanders and staffs develop
information requirements for reconnaissance assets. Commanders visualize how reconnaissance capabilities
will synchronize with national-level assets, partner forces, and special reconnaissance to contribute to the
mission accomplishment of assigned missions while supporting the higher-level commander’s intent.
Accordingly, commanders direct reconnaissance and craft reconnaissance guidance to set conditions for
mission success.
COMMANDER’S CRITICAL INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS 
3-14. A commander’s critical information requirement is an information requirement identified by the
commander as being critical to facilitating timely decision making. (JP 3-0) The two key elements are PIRs
and friendly force information requirements. A CCIR directly influences decision making and facilitates the
successful execution of flexible military operations or the actions a commander takes at a decision point.
Commanders decide to designate an information requirement as a CCIR based on likely decisions and their
visualization of the course of the operation. During planning, staffs recommend information requirements for
commanders to designate as CCIRs. During preparation and execution, staffs may recommend changes to
CCIRs based on assessment. A CCIR is—

Specified by a commander for a specific operation.

Applicable only to the commander who specifies it (or his subordinates executing reconnaissance
operations in support of the commander).

Situation-dependent (directly linked to a current mission or to a decision that will create a new
mission, branch, or sequel to the current mission).

Time-sensitive.
3-15. Commanders establish the CCIR and update information requirements based on changing conditions.
Commanders and their staffs first identify information gaps and continuously assess, adapt, add, and delete
requirements throughout the operation. As they continuously plan, task, and employ collection assets to
answer the commander’s CCIR and other information requirements, commanders and staffs must—

Develop and continuously update a list of intelligence requirements.

Identify and update the CCIR.

Tie the CCIR directly to the scheme of maneuver and decision points.

Limit the CCIR to only the most critical intelligence and combat information needs.

Seek higher echelon collections of (and answers to) information requirements.

Ensure that the CCIR includes the LTIOV to ensure timely reporting and decision making.
3-16. A priority intelligence requirement is an intelligence requirement that the commander and staff need
to understand the threat and other aspects of the operational environment. (JP 2-01) PIRs determine the
priority for reconnaissance operations and information collection, providing information that the commander
Chapter 3 
3-4
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
needs to understand about a threat, enemy, or adversary or about the OE (such as terrain or civil 
considerations). PIRs become the central focus for CBRN R&S elements, and the staff normally ties PIRs to 
an NAI or a TAI.  
3-17. A friendly force information requirement is information the commander and staff need to understand
the status of friendly force and supporting capabilities. (JP 3-0) Friendly force information requirements
identify the information about the mission, troops, and support available, and time available for friendly
forces that the commander considers most important.
3-18. Commanders limit the number of CCIRs of their organic reconnaissance assets or task-organized teams
who conduct reconnaissance tasks. With fewer prioritized CCIRs, subordinate units can apply greater
concentrations of combat power and reconnaissance focus to each information requirement. At the same time,
fewer prioritized CCIRs facilitate timely and accurate reporting and provide the commander the required
information sooner than it would otherwise be provided.
3-19. The list of CCIRs constantly change throughout an operation. Through their staffs, effective liaison
teams, the tactical network, and direct communications with their subordinate commanders, commanders
constantly refine and develop their information requirements throughout the operations process as they add
and delete CCIRs based on the information needed for specific decisions.
3-20. Commanders refer to information they want protected as EEFI. An EEFI is a critical aspect of a friendly 
operation that, if known by the enemy, would subsequently compromise, lead to the failure of, or limit the
success of an operation and is therefore protected from enemy detection. Although EEFIs are not CCIRs,
they have the same priority. EEFIs establish elements of information to protect rather than seek or collect.
EEFI identification is central to prioritizing units, information, or activities, which allows security tasks to
focus on the priorities. See figure 3-1.

3-21. Staff further refines the commander’s PIR into essential elements of information (EEI) (see figure
3-2). In turn, subordinate staffs and commanders designate EEIs that nest with the higher commander’s PIR.
After establishing EEIs, the squadron staff and troop commanders may establish indicators. Indicators are
items of information that reflect the intention or capability of an adversary to adopt or reject a course of
action. See JP 2-0 for more information.

COMMANDER’S RECONNAISSANCE GUIDANCE 
3-22. Reconnaissance tasks precede main body movement, minimizing the time available for troop-leading
procedures for the CBRN R&S unit (including planning and rehearsal times, precombat checks and
inspections, and maintenance); therefore, the commander sets reconnaissance priorities early. The
commander sets priorities in the warning order (WARNORD), establishing focus, tempo,
engagement/disengagement criteria, and displacement criteria. Missions without focus misallocate the
collection capabilities of the CBRN R&S element. Wasting CBRN R&S elements can cause an enemy
vulnerability or a catastrophic threat to remain undiscovered. Properly employing CBRN R&S requires
CBRN R&S leadership and the CBRN staff of the supported maneuver commander to integrate
considerations of CBRN threats and CBRN R&S assets into the joint ISR planning process.
3-23. Commanders provide clear reconnaissance guidance that offers freedom of action to develop the
situation. They also provide adequate direction to ensure that their organic and attached reconnaissance
organizations can accomplish stated reconnaissance objectives within the required timeframe. The
commander’s reconnaissance planning guidance provides a clear understanding of the organization task,
purpose, and objective. Reconnaissance and security guidance explains focus; levels of detail required; levels
of covertness; and guidelines for engagement, disengagement, and displacement of the organization. The
commander develops his planning guidance based on the mission, timeline, and intent to satisfy information
requirements and identify opportunities to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. The commander specifies
different reconnaissance guidance for each phase of an operation and adjusts the components of his guidance,
when appropriate.

3-24. The commander’s guidance consists of the following four elements:

Focus.

Tempo of reconnaissance.

Engagement/disengagement criteria (if any), both lethal and nonlethal.

Displacement criteria.
3-25. Focus defines the reconnaissance organization area of emphasis and prioritizes resources and time to
support the commander’s decision points. Focus helps balance the width and detail of reconnaissance
operations to provide viable and useful information collection. Commanders and staffs assign reconnaissance
objectives that directly support the commander’s end state.
3-26. Tempo describes the level of detail and covertness required to accomplish reconnaissance operations.
Tempo is described by four terms: rapid, deliberate, stealthy, and forceful. Rapid and deliberate are levels of
detail and are mutually exclusive in all cases because one cannot be rapid and deliberate at the same time.
However, reconnaissance organizations can oscillate between the two from phase to phase or even within
subphases of an operation. Stealthy and forceful indicate mutually exclusive levels of covertness.
Commanders choose the appropriate form of reconnaissance to accomplish the mission balanced with the
other mission variables of METT-T/METT-TC.
3-27. Engagement criteria are protocols that specify the circumstances for initiating engagement with an
enemy force. They can be either restrictive or permissive. The commander visualizes engagement criteria
through analysis of the mission variables (METT-TC/METT-T). Engagement criteria should be defined using 
precise doctrinal terms. CBRN staff and CBRN R&S formations attached to maneuver elements must be
proactive to ensure that the concept for conducting mitigation, render safe (with attached or organic EOD, as
necessary), and sampling and for entering contaminated areas nests with the commander’s intent and the
tactical reconnaissance guidance of the supported reconnaissance echelon.
3-28. Displacement criteria define triggers for planned withdrawal, passage of lines, or reconnaissance
handover (RHO) between units. As with engagement and disengagement criteria, the conditions and
parameters set out in displacement criteria integrate the commander’s intent with tactical feasibility.
Conditions are either event-driven (for example, associated PIR are met, threat contact is not expected in the
area, and observed NAIs or avenues of approach are denied to the enemy), time-driven (for example, LTIOV
time triggers are met), or threat-driven (observation posts [OPs] are compromised). Failure to specifically
dictate conditions of displacement, nested within the higher scheme of maneuver, will likely result in
ineffective reconnaissance.
3-29. Commanders direct all aspects of operations by establishing the commander’s intent, setting achievable
objectives, and issuing clear tasks to subordinate units. Throughout the operations process, commanders
direct forces by preparing and approving plans and orders; establishing command and support relationships;
assigning and adjusting tasks, control measures, and task organization; positioning units to maximize combat
power; positioning key leaders at critical places and times to ensure effective C2; allocating resources to
exploit developing opportunities and to counter emerging threats; and committing reserves, as required.
3-30. Through leadership, commanders provide purpose, direction, and motivation to subordinate
commanders, their staffs, and Service members. The commander’s physical presence is necessary to lead
effectively. During reconnaissance operations, the battalion and higher-level commander balances their time
between leading the staff through the operations process and providing purpose, direction, and motivation to
subordinate commanders and personnel forward of the command post.
3-31. Commanders continuously assess the situation to better understand current conditions and determine
how the operation is progressing. Continuous assessment helps commanders anticipate and adapt the force
to changing circumstances. Commanders incorporate the assessment of the staff, subordinate commander,
and unified action partners into their personal assessment of the situation. Based on their assessment,
commanders modify plans and orders to adapt the force to changing circumstances.

CBRN R&S SUPPORT TO COMMAND AND CONTROL 
3-32. CBRN leaders and staffs enable the supported commander’s exercise of mission command by rapidly
fulfilling information requirements. The information obtained by CBRN R&S elements helps clarify the
situation; answer information requirements; and assist the commander in identifying, creating, and exploiting
opportunities and in anticipating change. The results of such operations improve the commander’s
understanding, visualization, and description of the operating environment, the terrain, local populations, and
the enemy. Through effective information collection and continuous reconnaissance operations nested within
the higher concept of operations, commanders develop the understanding required to achieve and maintain
advantage over the enemy. Reconnaissance improves the commander’s understanding and enables him to—

Understand the tactical, human, and political dynamics within an AO.

Visualize operations in the context of operational and mission variables (METT-TC/METT-T).

Describe the commander’s decisive operations in time, space, and purpose with a greater degree
of detail, accuracy, and fidelity.

Concentrate friendly strengths against enemy weaknesses.

Assess progress through continuous reconnaissance, monitoring, and evaluation.

Modify existing or developing plans and reallocate assets based on changing tactical situations.

Achieve tactical depth.

Identify and create options to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative.
3-33. Reconnaissance leaders must understand the overall OE and their commander’s intent at least two
echelons higher in the chain of command, be decisive, make plans quickly, exercise disciplined initiative
(even disciplined disobedience), pass available information to subordinates, report to higher headquarters
accurately and rapidly, and be responsive to changing conditions on the battlefield.
CBRN R&S PLANNING FUNDAMENTALS 
3-34. The CBRN R&S information collection planning fundamentals provide CBRN staffs and planners the
basic guidelines for how to employ CBRN R&S capabilities to optimize their use in support of joint ISR.
The joint services use these planning fundamentals to mutually support one another and to synchronize
CBRN R&S across multiple domains in the theater of operations. The following are the CBRN R&S planning 
fundamentals:

Support the JIPOE/IPB process and retain flexibility to answer multiple PIRs. CBRN R&S
is the process of using refined intelligence from multiple information platforms (resulting from
intelligence analysis) to answer CBRN-focused critical information requirements. This process
must be integrated with the overall JIPOE/IPB and joint ISR endeavors of the supported maneuver
command. Every CBRN R&S mission is first and fundamentally an R&S mission. A CBRN R&S
element, operating independently or as an attachment with a cavalry, infantry, special operations
force, or other reconnaissance element, is responsible for conducting the range of fundamental
reconnaissance tasks to support the commander’s situational awareness. CBRN R&S provides
support to measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT), technical intelligence, and other
intelligence disciplines and may support answering a wide range of PIRs—not just CBRN-related
PIRs. Throughout the course of a CBRN R&S mission, information is reported through standard
mission command networks and postmission reporting. During the course of JIPOE/IPB, CBRN-
related PIRs are integrated into the joint ISR planning process, ensuring that the allocation of joint
ISR assets reflects the commander’s priorities. As information is collected, it must be shared with
the J-2/G-2/S-2 to provide a complete picture of enemy intent and possible CBRN employment.
CBRN R&S capabilities are critical and extremely limited assets that must be postured to collect
information on multiple NAIs or to target areas of interest, as required by the commander.

Task-organize and allocate CBRN capabilities by using the operational framework. An
operational framework is a cognitive tool used to assist commanders and staffs in clearly
visualizing and describing the application of combat power in time, space, purpose, and resources
during the concept of operations. It is imperative to CBRN staffs to plan and position CBRN
capabilities to rapidly respond to CBRN incidents to develop combat information at the

31 March 2021 
deep/close/consolidation/support operational framework during Joint Operation Planning and 
Execution System/military decision-making process (MDMP)/Marine Corps Planning Process 
(MCPP), CBRN staffs plan for the capabilities needed to achieve the appropriate level of 
identification. Most initial contact with CBRN and TIM hazards is made through conventional 
forces (such as infantry, armor, or cavalry formations) while conducting movement and maneuver. 
Technical CBRN support forces provide an increased detection and identification capability to 
refine the information that answers CCIRs and guides the commander’s decision making. It is 
important that CBRN staffs clearly articulate, in mission orders, the locations at which the forces 
that are capable of each level of identification—and the locations at which essential elements of 
the sample management—reside. This establishes the framework for the sequential chain of 
custody after sampling operations are executed. Through backwards planning, CBRN staffs must 
account for the correct asset for detection with the requisite technology, sample media, supporting 
decontamination requirements, and transportation requirements to execute sample management 
procedures correctly. At the brigade/regiment/Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) level and 
higher, commanders and staffs plan CBRN R&S to execute missions by using the 
deep/close/consolidation/support framework to broadly describe force allocation, organization, 
and capability. At battalion/squadron levels or lower, the decisive/shaping/sustaining or main and 
supporting effort frameworks are used within the concepts of operations to describe (in greater 
detail to the tactical commander) how CBRN capabilities support the scheme of maneuver.  

Plan force allocations to meet CBRN R&S requirements across the range of military
operations. To maintain operational reach against a CBRN-capable adversary, CBRN R&S
capabilities are planned to arrive early into theater to provide mission-essential CBRN assessment
capabilities to the force. CBRN R&S units are placed in the time-phased force and deployment
database to support the plan. The sustainable readiness model is used to determine unit readiness
for deployment and accounts for the time that it takes for the Army National Guard, Air National
Guard, and Reserve forces to constitute and deploy. Planners should project CBRN R&S
capabilities to account for information collection requirements during joint reception, staging,
onward movement, and integration (JRSOI); lodgment expansion; LSCO; and limited contingency 
and stability operations. Planners should coordinate with interagency, multi-Service,
multinational, and coalition planners to address force requirements and capabilities.

Plan for command and support relationships that support maneuver and sustain CBRN
R&S over extended distances and in multiple areas of operation. CBRN capabilities are not
allocated organic sustainment capabilities. When CBRN R&S elements are task-organized with
maneuver formations during CBRN incidents, it allows commanders the freedom of action to
retain operational tempo and to maneuver forces into positions of relative advantage. Conversely,
during CWMD missions, maneuver provides security for the CBRN R&S to detect, identify, and
exploit CBRN environments. CBRN units do not own AOs, but they must move and execute
missions across multiple AOs to support commanders. Planners must account for the appropriate
C2 and sustainment of CBRN R&S, especially in deep areas and across extended lines of
communication.

Know the OE, and leverage it to the advantage of the R&S asset. Understanding the strengths
and weaknesses of each respective CBRN R&S asset is critical for planners at all levels. Mounted
CBRN R&S platoons can move rapidly to identify and mark contaminated areas over large areas
while maintaining tempo with mechanized forces. Dismounted reconnaissance assets can execute
missions in restrictive terrain and in dense urban and subterranean environments, but at a slower
tempo than mounted units. The use of unmanned reconnaissance is valuable when terrain is
canalizing, in a low oxygen or hazardous environment, or favorable to enemy direct fires, such as
urban terrain and subterranean facilities. Unmanned reconnaissance is of particular value when
supporting breaching of contaminated obstacles. Aerial reconnaissance is effective at providing
coverage across wide areas of open terrain while minimizing the risk from CBRN exposure and
enemy direct and indirect fires. During aerial reconnaissance, the time in the area is limited by
distance of travel and the operational capabilities of the platform. Planners must position CBRN
R&S capabilities in positions of advantage to maximize their effects.


Maximize standoff capabilities from NAIs and target areas of interest to detect and identify
at a distance. CBRN R&S detects and identifies hazards outside of the contaminated area to the
greatest extent possible. The optimization of standoff detection capabilities minimizes mitigation
requirements and maximizes the early warning of CBRN hazards or attacks to commanders,
allowing greater decisions space.

Provide layered surveillance coverage of areas in which CBRN attacks are probable.
Although CBRN detection arrays are viewed as mutually exclusive, when integrated, they
reinforce and amplify the detection capability for the entire force. CBRN surveillance sensors are
arrayed with both integrated and redundant coverages from CBRN and non-CBRN units. Non-
CBRN units employ organic CBRN detection at probable sites of attack. CBRN unit sensor arrays
augment detection and identification capabilities to provide greater area coverage.

Visualize where CBRN R&S capabilities are in time and space, and recognize where
acceptable risk is assumed in information gaps. There are never enough CBRN capabilities to
provide coverage for every portion of the AO simultaneously. Through the orders production
process, commanders and staffs prioritize, synchronize, and accept risk to place CBRN R&S
capabilities where they are needed most.

Communicate with higher and lower echelons to mitigate coverage gaps and leverage
multiple intelligence capabilities. Commanders and staffs must articulate operational coverage
and information gaps for synchronization and deconfliction at higher echelons. CBRN staff
planners provide requests for forces to theater CBRN planners to leverage unified action partner
capabilities. Planners must account for the effects of space and cyber domains to provide alternate
collection means.

Establish a supporting mitigation plan before CBRN R&S missions begin. A key planning
assumption is that CBRN R&S capabilities are at greater risk for contamination. This requires an
overall contamination mitigation plan that encompasses contamination control (limiting the
spread) and decontamination (technical decontamination of sampling teams). CBRN R&S units
use stand-off and remote identification capabilities to the greatest degree possible to identify
contamination while minimizing the risk to forces. CBRN R&S capabilities that are in deep and
close areas have greater risk to direct and indirect fires. Therefore, commanders (in conjunction
with support staff) must make an informed, risk-based analysis on whether to continue to fight
while contaminated or to mitigate hazards during an operational pause. A key consideration is the
operational tempo of the supported unit.
CBRN R&S PLANNING PROCESSES 
3-35. ISR planning (with CBRN R&S as a consideration) is executed simultaneously with the JIPOE/IPB,
the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System process, and the development of CCIRs and PIRs with
the J-2/G-2/S-2 (intelligence) staff. CBRN R&S planning follows a chronological process that incorporates
several elements of the JIPOE/IPB process. The purpose of the overall joint ISR plan is to prioritize and
assign missions to CBRN R&S capabilities to answer the commander’s PIRs. PIRs are intelligence
requirements, stated as a priority for intelligence support, that the commander and staff need in order to
understand the adversary or other aspects of the OE. PIRs can be phase-based, are usually associated with a
decision point, and are based on an adversary action or inaction or on the operational area that affects the
overall success of the mission. The staff drafts PIRs for recommended additions to the commander’s initial
guidance during mission analysis. The JIPOE/IPB process refines the commander’s information requirements
about the adversary (to include CBRN capabilities), the adversary’s purpose, and terrain and weather
considerations. Figure 3-3, page 3-10, shows the work flow of how MDMP/MCPP and information collection 
planning run concurrently.

RECEIVE THE MISSION AND MISSION ANALYSIS 
3-36. During the receipt of a mission, the commander provides the staff guidance that he considers critical.
The entire staff analyzes the CCIRs and then submits requests for information to higher echelons and
WARNORDs to subordinate units. This information is maintained on running estimates and common
operational pictures to ensure that all staffs maintain awareness of current CBRN information gaps. The staff
then begins the process of mission analysis and JIPOE/IPB.

CBRN usage, advise and assist the J-2/G-2/S-2 and command surgeon’s medical staff. This includes
recommended guidance for CBRN collection assets to address information gaps. Commanders must consider
risks for the placement of CBRN R&S capabilities as a collection platform and understand the acceptable
level of risk for R&S activities. CBRN staffs and planners inform and advise the commander on how to best

assess and mitigate CBRN hazards during operations. To initiate the planning effort, it is critical that the staff 
receives the commander’s initial guidance on the— 

Initial approved CCIRs, to include PIRs staffed with the J-2/G-2/S-2.

Initial timeline for collection planning and product development.

Initial information collection focus to address information gaps and CBRN attack indicators.

Commander’s authorized movements to place CBRN R&S capabilities where they can best
support information collection.
3-38.  Upon conclusion of receiving the commander’s initial guidance, the staff develops a WARNORD to
initiate movement of R&S assets and follows up on information requests previously submitted to higher
echelons during mission analysis. The staff seeks to answer as many of the commander’s PIRs as possible.
The PIRs that cannot be answered immediately are tracked on the draft ISR/information collection plan.
DEFINE THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT 
3-39. The OE is defined by identifying the AO and area of influence. The area of operations is an operational
area defined by the commander for land and maritime forces that should be large enough to accomplish their
missions and protect their forces. (JP 3-0) The area of influence is a geographical area wherein a commander
is directly capable of influencing operations by maneuver or fire support systems normally under the
commander’s command or control. (JP 3-0) The AO and area of influence become the boundaries for joint
ISR planning purposes. Coordination between adjacent units is required, along with a situational
understanding of what the higher echelon is conducting in deep areas. To better synchronize all joint ISR
efforts within the AO, CBRN staffs use the deep-close-support-consolidation framework.
DESCRIBE THE EFFECTS OF THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT 
3-40. During JIPOE/IPB, the planning staff identifies the operational and mission variables. Part of that
process is describing the OE effects through the terrain analysis, civil considerations, and weather
analysis/projected conditions that impact joint ISR/information collection. The output of this step in
JIPOE/IPB is a modified combined obstacle overlay that describes the OE effects. Planners use the modified
combined obstacle overlay to efficiently place CBRN mounted, dismounted, unmanned, and standoff
capabilities to support situational understanding and freedom of maneuver.
CONDUCT THE CBRN THREAT ASSESSMENT 
3-41. During JIPOE/IPB, the CBRN staff assists the J-2/G-2/S-2 in evaluating the CBRN capabilities of the
adversary. The J-2/G-2/S-2 tends to focus their efforts on understanding the enemy scheme of maneuver. It
is imperative that CBRN staffs provide subject matter expertise to describe how enemy CBRN use will shape
friendly forces. The J-2/G-2/S-2, with the supporting staffs, create an adversary doctrinal template and
situation template that show adversary force dispositions at a time and place relative to each course of action
developed by the staff. CBRN staffs should provide substantive support to their conclusions with
understanding of enemy CBRN systems, capabilities, and doctrine through a CBRN threat assessment that is
shared with, or briefed to, the J-2/G-2/S-2 staff.
3-42. As described in ATP 3-11.36/MCRP 10-10E.1/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, CBRN threat
assessments address the following to direct CBRN-focused information collection:

Addresses all CBRN threats and hazards in a who, what, where, when, why, and how
methodology.

Differentiates threats versus hazards. If the threat is considered a deliberate adversarial CBRN
threat, CBRN staffs determine the adversary’s capabilities, including preferred and likely delivery
methods.

Develops an assessment strategy for potential TIM hazards, if required. If TIM sites are damaged
by friendly direct and indirect fires, an assessment and mitigation strategy is developed by the
staff.


Identifies opportunities to deliver, including where and when friendly forces are vulnerable.

Determines enemy delivery intent, describing the enemy’s desired tactical task. JP 6-0 provides
joint standard, to refine that understanding see FM 6-0 for developing a proposed mission
statement (chapter 9). It is important to understand which C2 level CBRN deployment/release
authority decisions are made by the adversary as it may direct where intelligence operations focus
efforts.
COMPLETE OPERATIONAL PLANNING 
3-43. CBRN staffs and planners apply the CBRN threat assessment as each adversary course of action is
developed and war-gamed. Enemy intent with CBRN attacks are described using tactical tasks or desired
effects to maneuver commanders and staffs. During war gaming, planners describe how the allocation of
CBRN R&S capabilities throughout the OE facilitate early warning and enable the interdiction of enemy
CBRN usage. Upon completion of the operation order (OPORD), the CBRN annex should clearly articulate
the adversary’s planned use of CBRN and how joint ISR operations inform and provide indicators for use.
Units tasked to support joint ISR operations must understand what they are looking for. CBRN planners
develop an information collection plan that provides this information to tasked assets.
DEVELOP AN INFORMATION COLLECTION PLAN 
3-44. The information collection plan is part of the parallel planning that is executed simultaneously with
MDMP or MCPP. CBRN staff planners support the JIPOE or IPB process by answering the commander’s
PIRs. The process systematically analyzes the enemy’s actions and intent. Some PIRs are satisfied during
mission analysis, and others are unanswered. Unanswered PIRs are then delineated as EEIs, indicators, and
specific information requirements, which is tracked via joint ISR planning. Requests for information or
requests for support are sent to higher echelons if required collection capabilities are not organic to the unit.
CBRN staffs determine CBRN-related information requirements and share them with the
J-2/G-2/S-2. The output of information collection planning is an R&S collection matrix that—

Identifies the PIRs, EEIs, and SIRs that need to be answered.

Determines which specific type of CBRN threat or hazard is being collected.

Determines the indicators (specific weapon systems, enemy actions, OE factors that increase
likelihood of use) and SIRs (report location and/or message traffic regarding release authority or
fire instructions over R-173M frequency modulation (commonly known as FM)-very high
frequency (known as VHF) radios at 30 to 80 megahertz at a 20-watt output).

Identifies non-CBRN and CBRN R&S units or capabilities tasked to answer the requirement.

Provides an LTIOV for each SIR. LTIOV is critical for leveraging long-range fires to interdict
CBRN attacks before launch.

Prioritizes each SIR. This is particularly important when there is a lack of collection assets to
address EEIs and SIRs. Subordinate units must understand where they can best utilize information
collection assets to optimize their placement and synchronize them.

Identifies and marks NAIs, as described in chapter 1, on the operations map by using the military
grid reference system. Anticipated times and locations of enemy activity indicators are derived
through the JIPOE/IPB process and portrayed as NAIs. These geographic areas and times of
interest become focal points for collection requirements. The J-2/G-2/S-2, operations, and
supporting staffs use the assessment of indicators to articulate and justify collection
requirements/requests for forces to higher headquarters and to help subordinate commands
understand where best to place listening posts (LPs)/OPs.

3-46.  After CBRN staff planners have developed a collection matrix, they ensure that it is nested with the
J-2/G-2/S-2 staff’s overall collection strategy. The matrix provides an objective method to task CBRN R&S
capabilities; it also provides a tracking mechanism for ensuring that information requirements are satisfied.
Understanding the tasking authority and command relationships is critical for planners to integrate CBRN
units into R&S plans. There should be synchronization and parallel planning between higher units and units
that control R&S collection assets. The CBRN staff are critical to ensuring that CBRN-related PIR and EEI
are incorporated into the operations of the collective information collection enterprise. CBRN R&S
leadership must ensure that their formations not only observe the narrow, technical indicators that are related
to CBRN, but also that they maximize their contribution to the commander’s intent by reporting all EEI
within their AO.
COLLABORATION AND DIALOGUE 
3-47.  Throughout the operations process, commanders encourage continuous collaboration and dialogue
among the staff and with unified action partners. Collaboration and dialogue aids in developing shared
understanding throughout the force. To accomplish the requisite degree of collaboration and dialogue and to
assist the commander in planning, executing, and assessing reconnaissance and security tasks, the staff should
organize into an operations and intelligence working group.
3-48. The operations and intelligence working group is comprised of designated staff officers who coordinate
and integrate information collection activities and provide recommendations to the commander and the S-
3/assistant chief of staff, operations (G-3)/J-3. The operations and intelligence working group develops and
refines the information collection plan as part of reconnaissance operations.
3-49. The exclusive use of organizational CBRN sensors limits hazard awareness and understanding.
Integration across the spectrum of sensors (CBRN and non-CBRN) provides a more effective understanding
of the CBRN OE. Situational understanding can only be achieved through the integration of capabilities
across the warfighting functions. When operating in a CBRN environment, the tactical commander is
challenged to make timely and informed risk-based decisions, supported by awareness and understanding, to
ensure survivability while retaining freedom of action in accomplishing the mission.
3-50. The integration, collaboration, and synchronization of the warfighting functions primarily occur within
the staffs. The integration of all-source intelligence and information incorporating CBRN sensing and
detection capabilities provides a better picture of the OE and facilitation of situational understanding. The
other staff sections coordinate and integrate the requirements of the CBRN staff.
3-51. The CBRN staff collaborates with the personnel section (assistant chief of staff, personnel [G-1]/
battalion or brigade personnel staff officer [S-1]) for the status of CBRN personnel and CBRN personnel
assignments and by using advanced hazard prediction modeling for predicting CBRN casualties. Because of
the fear and stress associated with CBRN operations, the chaplain section (echelons above brigade) or unit
ministry team (brigade and battalion) should be contacted to provide religious support to military members,
DOD employees, and authorized civilians and to provide advice on ethics and morale following a CBRN
incident.
3-52. The assistant chief of staff, civil affairs operations (G-9), and associated civil affairs forces can provide
civil environment considerations and analysis into the planning, operations, and targeting process. Civil
affairs planners using CIM products and analysis can provide nonlethal targeting options to support the
commander’s end state when appropriate, and they can support lethal targeting with analysis of second and
third order effects and mitigate the effects of lethal targeting on the civil environment and local population.
3-53. The command surgeon and medical staff should participate in the CBRN and intelligence staff working
groups and meetings to execute health surveillance and coordinate behavioral/mental health support
throughout the joint/allied force. All of this information feeds into the CBRN staff ability to prepare accurate
threat assessments. The CBRN staff must be actively involved with G-2 staff analysis and planning in all
phases of MDMP or joint planning by supporting CCIRs based on the commander’s initial guidance and by
nominating areas of interest and providing technical SME for likely enemy actions.

SPECIAL PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
3-55. As with subterranean and dense urban environments, OEs present challenges that require specific
planning. Special planning considerations provide commanders and staffs with planning guidance for unique
environmental conditions and CBRN R&S missions that pose increased risk to forces.
SUBTERRANEAN ENVIRONMENTS 
3-56. CBRN reconnaissance of subterranean environments, particularly in UGF, is generally conducted in
conjunction with a larger mission, operation, or campaign during which the majority of combat occurs on the
surface. Most subsurface operations are conducted at the company level and below. Battalions and brigades
must support forces that defend and control the terrain above subterranean environments. They must also
support the smaller, tactical forces that exploit the inside of subterranean facilities, to include CBRN
dismounted and unmanned systems. CBRN R&S forces enhance the ability for maneuver units to execute
clearing operations in UGFs, supporting site exploitation operations while simultaneously monitoring oxygen 
quality, the presence of explosives, or poisonous gases.
3-57. UGFs are unpredictable hazards to CBRN R&S forces because of their complexity, depth, and
construction. UGFs have the tendency to flood during rainy seasons and are frequently booby-trapped to
prevent exploitation. UGFs may have multiple unknown access ports, increasing the risk of ambush to CBRN
R&S elements. Planners must account for the expected degraded communications and navigation abilities
associated with UGFs. UGFs have the increased risk of overpressure, peak pressure, and impulse pressure
during explosive usage and small arms fire, as described in ATP 3-21.51. The blasts from pressure waves
can damage CBRN protection equipment and severely injure personnel clearing UGFs. Without ventilation,
CBRN hazards may linger or leach into the surrounding underground material, posing long-term hazards to
forces. If the potential for contamination of a UGF exists or if it is a known WMD site, planners must ensure
that technical decontamination support is established before entry and plan for use of protective masks or
supplemental oxygen. Ultimately, commanders and staffs make an informed risk decision on whether to
exploit UGFs or to secure them from the surface, preventing further use.

31 March 2021 
DENSE URBAN ENVIRONMENTS
3-58. Dense urban environments pose an increased risk to CBRN R&S forces due to terrain that supports
enemy freedom of maneuver, troop concentration, and the canalizing effect of roads and alleyways. CBRN
hazards have a tendency to linger longer in urban structures, such as parking garages and sewage drains,
where the air is cooler and circulates through streets unpredictably. There is also an increased risk of collateral 
damage due to the large presence of noncombatant personnel and industrial facilities. Because of the risk to
noncombatants and friendly forces, CBRN R&S forces must analyze and understand civil considerations
(areas, structures, capabilities, organization, people, and events [ASCOPE]) to conduct centralized planning
and decentralized execution in urban terrain. WMD facilities and TIM hazards should be identified during
mission analysis of the orders process.
3-59. Using CBRN R&S forces in combination with maneuver forces affords the commander a significant
force multiplier for survivability in dense urban terrain. CBRN R&S forces should be task-organized with
supporting mounted and dismounted maneuver capabilities to execute missions in urban terrain. Mounted
forces possess the speed, agility, and firepower to rapidly isolate CBRN sites, establishing an outer cordon.
However, mounted CBRN R&S may be constrained by terrain (limiting stand-off detection capabilities) and
are more vulnerable to targeting by enemy light forces.
3-60. Dismounted maneuver forces can effectively clear objectives of enemy personnel, establishing the
essential security required for CBRN site exploitation operations. Organic dismounted CBRN platoons to
infantry brigades and MAGTFs are best-trained and equipped to conduct CBRN R&S in dense urban terrain
due to habitually established training relationships. However, dismounted CBRN R&S elements lack stand-
off detection capability and have a slower movement and rate of identification. Additionally, host-nation
emergency first responders may reduce the risk of the unintentional release of TIMs and minimize CBRN
R&S requirements during stability operations. For more information on combined arms operations in urban
terrain, see ATP 3-06/MCTP 12-10B.
COMMUNICATION 
3-61. Communications are vital to reconnaissance operations. Reconnaissance elements conduct effective
reconnaissance, but if they are unable to report their findings to their supported command, they are a wasted
resource. Leaders must place the same emphasis in their communications plan as any of the other warfighter
functions. Because of the extended frontages and distances over which reconnaissance elements operate, they
must be experts at operating communication equipment, troubleshooting and improvising communication
systems, and integrating with multi-Service or allied communication networks. Leaders must be capable of
managing communication across multiple networks simultaneously.
3-62. The lowest element radio networks (typically platoons, sections, or crews) are critical to effective
platoon C2. All elements within the platoon must have the ability to monitor and transmit on the radio
network at all times. All reconnaissance elements in the platoon (sections, squads, or crews) must also have
the ability to rapidly change to any other platoon network as required to coordinate contact points or hand
over reconnaissance responsibilities.
3-63. The company-level (squadron or wing) radio networks are critical to company-level C2. The command
post is the network control station, and the subordinate leaders send routine reports to the executive officer.
Subordinate leaders converse with each other and coordinate key tactical actions of their elements; however,
they use subordinate radio networks to pass routine messages that are of no interest to the commander.
3-64. Fires networks are frequently used to send calls for fire to the appropriate fire support officer or fires
cell or directly to the supporting mortars. All reconnaissance elements must have the ability to switch to this
network and coordinate indirect fires. Reconnaissance elements must also be ready to change to the networks
of supporting elements, such as tank and mobile gun systems, to coordinate support by fire.
3-65. Administrative networks are used as required to send routine administrative and logistics/reports. This
network also coordinates the resupply and evacuation of casualties.
3-66. Retransmission networks are required to support operations over extended distances. Retransmission
networks should be established to support all missions requiring frequency modulation communications at
extended ranges.

3-67. The primary, alternate, contingency, and emergency (PACE) plan is a communication plan that exists
for a specific mission or task—not a specific unit—because the plan considers both intraunit and interunit
sharing of information. The PACE plan designates the order in which an element moves through available
communications systems until contact with the desired distant element is reestablished.
VISIT, BOARD, SEARCH, AND SEIZURE 
3-68. Maritime visit, board, search, and seizure operations are conducted onboard designated vessels to that
are to be visited or boarded. Specific tactics, techniques, and procedures are used to search for evidence of
contraband. See NTTP 3-07.11M for additional details.
LITTORAL AREAS 
3-69. Littoral areas are described as geographical areas from the ocean through the shore area, 14 miles
inland. During joint forcible entry operations, littoral areas provide joint force commanders (JFCs) with
opportunities to gain and maintain the initiative, placing friendly forces in positions of relative advantage
through operational maneuver from the sea. These operations introduce significant-size forces into the rear
or flanks of enemy forces. Littoral areas are described as having two parts: seaward areas controlled by naval
assets from the open ocean to the shore and landward area inland from the shore that can be supported and
defended directly from the sea.
3-70. Enemy CBRN capabilities may be employed against Navy and Marine forces as part of the enemy’s
antiaccess/area denial plan. Enemy CBRN attacks disrupt the synchronization of beachhead establishment
and follow-on operations. United States Marine Corps CBRN R&S teams support freedom of maneuver in
the littoral area, providing early warning and identification of CBRN hazards that impede Marine force
freedom of action and flexibility. Planners integrate United States Marine Corps CBRN R&S elements with
Marine maneuver elements as a combat multiplier before missions.
SAMPLING IMPACTS TO TEMPO 
3-71. CBRN sampling supports follow-on decisions, such as mitigation strategies and medical treatment.
Sampling is an essential element to attribution, providing legally sufficient evidence of the use of WMDs by
adversaries. Collecting CBRN samples for exploitation is a deliberate operation that requires multiechelon
coordination and synchronization. Site exploitation is costly in terms of time and security requirements.
CBRN R&S forces that are in support of maneuver elements in enemy contact cannot overcommit time and
efforts to sampling without the cost of operational tempo. The transportation of samples to analytical labs
may be well out of range for most CBRN R&S capabilities operating in close and deep areas, and may further
compromise security while operating in close proximity to enemy forces.
3-72. CBRN R&S (in a direct support role to maneuver in deep and close areas) provide agility to offensive
maneuvers, rapidly confirming CBRN usage and identifying bypass routes around CBRN hazards. As a
combat enabler, CBRN R&S facilitates a maneuver commander’s risk decisions in and around CBRN hazards
to retain the initiative. Commanders and staffs ensure that CBRN R&S elements understand when and where
to collect a CBRN sample.
REPORTS 
3-73. Reconnaissance elements communicate according to the established reconnaissance order or SOP,
either at specified times in designated communications windows or immediately upon observation of a
designated EEI. The decision to transmit is dependent on METT-TC. Frequent transmission may place
reconnaissance elements at risk, while reporting too seldom can reduce the relevance of time-sensitive
intelligence. To accomplish their missions, reports must be properly formatted. Even a partially received
report is better understood if it is transmitted by using standard formats.

3-74. Code words or letters are used by transmitting stations to send vital information quickly, briefly, and
securely. These letters and code words are identified during mission planning. They inform the receiving
station of the situation on the ground without using long descriptions. Code words are also used to send vital
information in a secure manner. Without knowledge of the meaning of the code words/code letters, the
meaning of the message will not be known to any intercepting station or person.
3-75. Reports that must be standardized by CBRN R&S elements (if not already standard in their assigned
formations) include, but are not limited to, the—

Initial entry report.

SITREP.

Intelligence report.

Battle damage report.
ELECTRONIC WARFARE
3-76. Electronic warfare is defined as the use of electromagnetic energy, directed energy, or antiradiation
weapons to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment, with the intent of degrading, neutralizing, or destroying
enemy combat capability and is considered a form of fires.
3-77. Electronic protection is critical to avoid compromising reconnaissance operations. Key tasks include—

Using brevity lists.

Masking antenna locations.

Using directional antennas.

Using the lowest possible output power.

Using voice communication only when essential.

Minimizing transmission time.

Planning messages.

Encrypting messages.

Executing a destruction SOP in the event of compromise.
3-78. An electromagnetic pulse is a burst of electromagnetic energy moving out from the nuclear detonation
that may interact with the earth’s magnetic field to generate strong electromagnetic fields capable of causing
damage to unprotected electrical or electronic equipment. The most susceptible systems are those using
integrated circuits and transistors (such as computers, transmitters, receivers, intercom systems, satellite
communications systems, and electronic countermeasures pods). The effects of an electromagnetic pulse will
varies, depending on the altitude and location of the detonation.
3-79. An electromagnetic pulse induces current flow in all conductive materials in its path. Excessive
currents are generated in unhardened antennas, long wire and cables, metal objects, radios, and electronic
equipment, causing effects that range from temporary to permanent circuit disturbances to complete burnout.

CBRN R&S SUPPORT TO LARGE-SCALE COMBAT OPERATIONS 
3-80. When LSCO begin, the JFC immediately exploits friendly capabilities across multiple domains and
the information environment to gain the initiative. The JFC seeks decisive advantage by using all available
elements of combat power to exploit the initiative, deny enemy objectives, defeat enemy capabilities to resist,
and compel desired behavior. Within the joint combat operation model described in JP 3-0, offense, defense,
and stability may occur simultaneously in the same AO. LSCO and campaigns normally include both
offensive and defensive components. The defense is stronger, but the offense is decisive in LSCO. For the
purposes of this manual, discussions are focused on how CBRN R&S forces adapt capabilities in support of
each activity associated with LSCO.

CBRN RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE DURING JOINT RECEPTION, STAGING, AND
ONWARD INTEGRATION  
3-81. Attaining operational reach often requires seizing and retaining access in the face of enemy opposition.
The intent of JRSOI is to project force, rapidly accumulating combat power as forces surge into the theater
of operations. Force projection is differentiated between opposed and unopposed operations. Unopposed, the
JFC retains more flexibility to assume risk for CBRN R&S coverage during the early stages of operations.
3-82. During opposed force projection, a CBRN-capable adversary may employ WMDs as part of their
antiaccess/area denial plan. Conducting CBRN R&S during JRSOI is a challenge because CBRN R&S forces
are extremely limited until all ground forces arrive into theater. The most important nodes that must be
protected during JRSOI are APOD, SPOD, and assembly areas where forces occupy for follow-on operations.
The synchronization of joint forces CBRN R&S capabilities is essential to the successful early warning of
CBRN attacks on the key nodes that could potentially constrain force projection. The United States Air Force
and United States Navy have localized organic CBRN R&S capability. It is important for JFC planners to
provide an early initial CBRN R&S force package to the AO in which an adversary will actively contest force
projection by using WMDs.
3-83. Figure 3-5 shows an example of how planners can use a CBRN area support company, hazard response
company (HRC), and an Air Force survey team to support JRSOI. The HRC and area support company were
templated early in the time-phased force and deployment data by JFC planners to support a contested JRSOI
against a CBRN-capable adversary. The HRC has deployed its platoons for decentralized CBRN R&S
operations, while the company command post is near the corps headquarters to ensure synchronized planning
and CBRN R&S coverage with corps staff. The HRC mounted CBRN platoon protects the lines of
communication along vulnerable routes, particularly between the SPOD and corps support area. The two
hazard assessment platoons have established surveillance at division support areas, but they retain the
flexibility to conduct CBRN dismounted reconnaissance at brigade AA. Each unit within the support areas
and assembly area has deployed its organic CBRN capabilities to provide early warning of CBRN attacks.
The area support company’s primary mission is to ensure that enemy CBRN attacks do not impact the force
flow from strategic support areas into the seaport. The area support company uses dismounted CBRN R&S
platoons in a surveillance role. An Air Force survey team can conduct surveillance operations to ensure
uninhibited JRSOI operations are executed. Upon request, the Air Force team can receive immediate
assistance from Army area support or hazard response companies. JFC planners ensure that the United States
Air Force survey teams retain CBRN planning and coordination responsibilities for operations at their
respective APODs.

3-84. Planners must also consider CBRN R&S support during JRSOI for multinational operations. It is
important to consider available host-nation first responder capabilities and responsibilities for APODs and
SPODs. Host-nations first responders typically have more familiarity with the terrain and supporting
capabilities available.
CBRN RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE IN OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS 
3-85. Offensive operations focus on breaking the enemy’s will to resist and establishing control of the OE.
JFC’s leverage the full breadth of air, sea, and naval combat power to impose their will on adversaries.
Offensive tasks are characterized by surprise, concentration, tempo, and audacity, leveraging all available
combat power from the joint force. Forces in the offense employ the appropriate forms of maneuver to close
with and destroy enemy forces and seize decisive terrain, with effective air and naval power supporting those
efforts. Successful offensive operations depend on creating conditions for overmatching the adversary’s
weakness and exploiting areas of operational success. Effective offensive action capitalizes on accurate and
timely joint ISR operations relative to enemy forces, weather, and terrain.
3-86. Marine and Army CBRN R&S capabilities, placed in appropriate command and support relationships,
conduct movement and maneuver alongside ground forces to provide warning, identification, and technical
advice regarding CBRN attacks. These actions provide reaction time and space to exploit the CBRN
environment to the commander’s advantage. CBRN staff planners and R&S capabilities thoroughly assess
CBRN employment by adversary forces, leading to informed commander’s decisions through hazard
awareness and understanding.
3-87. Planners and staffs prioritize CBRN R&S efforts, particularly during offensive operations, to ensure
that they can keep pace with the rapid movement and tempo of supported maneuver forces. Operational
tempo in the offense is critical as CBRN hazards are employed to fix, disrupt, block, and defeat friendly
forces. Enemy CBRN attacks, if effective, may set the conditions for enemy long-range artillery strikes that
destroy friendly combat power. CBRN R&S capabilities seldom have time to conduct site characterizations
and exploitations while in direct support of offensive operations, but may conduct site assessments when
time is available. CBRN R&S elements may conduct small-scale exploitation and disablement operations in
support of special operations forces that can quickly attack and withdrawal in a CWMD role.
3-88. Planners focus CBRN R&S capabilities on when and where CBRN hazards will disrupt decisive and
shaping operations. Then planners consider which lines of communication to reconnaissance or survey to
prevent early culmination of offensive operations due to loss of sustainment. Another consideration for
CBRN R&S support is sustainment hubs such as support areas and forward arming and refueling points for
aircraft.
3-89. As the FLOT advances, enemy CBRN weapons caches or WMD facilities may be abandoned or
bypassed, leaving small defense pockets of resistance. The JFC should consider incorporation of CBRN R&S
elements into CWMD task forces to support maneuver in the defeat of remaining enemy forces in rear areas.
CBRN R&S forces, especially CBRNE companies, execute site exploitations to consolidate gains, preventing 
loss of WMD material to adversaries. Planners coordinate with host-nation emergency responders for TIM
hazards that may impact the scheme of maneuver and local populations.
3-90. In figure 3-6, the JFC initiates offensive operations, with the decisive operation being an amphibious
landing by a MAGTF and follow-on attack on the enemy southern flank. Shaping operations include an
infantry brigade combat team conducting a feint in support of the amphibious landing and suppression of
enemy air defense conducted by long-range fires and national assets. The Air Force and Navy shape the OE
with targeted strikes against enemy high-value targets, artillery systems, and massed formations of armor and
infantry. In the north, two Army divisions attack along the enemy front on two separate axis of attack, setting
the conditions for the MAGTF’s amphibious landing and subsequent attack along the southern flank. For
CBRN R&S support, an Army CBRN brigade establishes a headquarters, conducts parallel planning with the
corps staff, and operates in the corps support area. An Air Force survey team is tasked to support the APOD.
An Army area support company provides support to the SPOD. A WMD coordination team augments the
staff at the theater headquarters to provide technical subject matter expertise and coordination for CBRN
R&S capabilities in support of CWMD. Each division is allocated a CBRN battalion, providing CBRN R&S
planning, tasking, and logistical support to detached CBRN maneuver elements. Each Army brigade combat

team uses their organic CBRN reconnaissance platoons and detection capability. The brigade combat teams 
are task-organized with a HRC, typically attached, that provides an additional mounted CBRN R&S platoon 
and two dismounted CBRN R&S platoons to support offensive operations. The MAGTF CBRN R&S 
capabilities provide early warning and situational understanding for Marine units and to the joint force.

Figure 3-6. CBRN R&S support to offensive operations 
3-91. In figure 3-7, page 3-22, the joint force’s offensive operations are successful in driving enemy forces
further east while simultaneously defeating adversary long-range strike and CBRN delivery capability. The
FLOT has advanced to Country X River and the ground and air lines of communication have extended over
a large tract of land that is critical to the sustainment of forces. At this point, JFCs must maintain logistical
support for multiple wet-gap crossings across a large front. Some units may have been successful at seizing
existing bridges and other forces may be air assaulted across the river, particularly in support of the MAGTF’s
operations. The divisions have relocated their support areas closer to maneuver forces to sustain them. CBRN
R&S elements support the tactical enabling task of gap crossing, described further in the chapter. A major
concern is the expanding rear area. Forces in the rear area are principally focused on missions that retain
tempo for forces in contact. Other missions in the rear area focus on setting conditions to return areas to
legitimate civilian authorities. In the rear areas, CBRN R&S elements conduct characterizations and
exploitations of TIM facilities damaged throughout operations that may hinder freedom of action. Abandoned
enemy CBRN weapon caches are secured or moved to controlled locations where they are exploited by
CBRN R&S forces. Captured WMD production facilities that are out of range of enemy direct and indirect
fires are cleared of enemy personnel. Small-scale disablement operations are executed by CBRN R&S forces.
However, larger WMD or TIM facilities that the JFC considers beyond their scope of control are sequenced
operations, initially secured for later stability operations.

CBRN RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE IN DEFENSIVE OPERATIONS
3-92. Defensive operations are executed to defeat enemy attacks, gain time, economize forces, and develop
conditions favorable for offensive or stability operations. While the offense is decisive, the defense is the
stronger element and is persistently seeking ways to attrite and weaken enemy forces. Defensive operations
are marked by intense preparation requiring effective logistical support to sustain over long durations.
3-93. The joint force’s ability to maintain flexibility and mass effects are two characteristics of the defense
that primarily concern CBRN planners. The most important friendly element to protect in a defensive
operation is the reserve in an area defense or the mobile strike force in a mobile defense. The reserve or
mobile strike force elements tend to be the decisive factor in a defense. They are the JFC’s flexible force that
positions and masses friendly combat power at critical points on the battlefield, causing the defeat of enemy
offensive efforts. To protect this effort, CBRN R&S elements are incorporated into the reserve or mobile
strike force to identify enemy CBRN attacks and aggressively exploit known CBRN environments to the
JFC’s advantage.
3-94. Survivability of forces in contamination areas are of vital importance during the defense. CBRN
planners address the preservation of combat power through organic detection capabilities and focused
surveillance efforts. CBRN R&S capabilities determine the type and extent of contamination from enemy
CBRN strikes to inform the JFC’s risk-based decisions on how long units can fight in CBRN conditions or
how soon units must be reconstituted. CBRN R&S elements are trained and equipped to conduct surveillance
in the defensive area most vulnerable to CBRN attacks. Forces that are in static defensive positions, support
areas, and C2 nodes that give large electronic signatures provide the enemy with lucrative CBRN targets
from long-range fires and asymmetric attacks. Mounted CBRN R&S elements conduct route reconnaissance
along lines of communication to prevent the isolation of defending forces and the cut of crucial supply lines.
The following are defensive tasks—

Retrograde is a type of defensive operation that involves organized movement away from the
enemy (ADP 3-90). The enemy may force these operations, or a commander may execute them
voluntarily. The retrograde is a transitional operation that is not conducted in isolation. It is part
of a larger maneuver scheme designed to regain the initiative and defeat the enemy. The three
retrograde tasks are delay, withdrawal, and retirement.

A delay is when a force under pressure trades space for time by slowing down the enemy’s
momentum and inflicting maximum damage on enemy forces without becoming decisively
engaged (ADP 3-90). The JFC establishes delay lines and maneuvers units from one defensive
position to subsequent positions back from the FLOT, slowing the enemy’s approach.

A withdrawal operation is a planned retrograde operation in which a force in contact disengages
from an enemy force and moves in a direction away from the enemy. The JFC may or may not
conduct a withdrawal under enemy pressure. Subordinate units may withdraw while the principle
force remains in contact with enemy forces. Typically, this operation occurs after a tactical reverse
or after a unit reaches its culminating point. Withdrawals are inherently dangerous because they
involve moving units away from what is usually a stronger enemy force.

Retirement is when a force out of contact moves away from the enemy (ADP 3-90). A retiring unit
organizes for combat, but does not anticipate interference with enemy ground forces.
3-95. In delay or withdrawal operations, the friendly force must maintain a mobility advantage over the
enemy attacker to successfully conduct retrograde operations. Planners should anticipate enemy CBRN
attacks to fix friendly forces in place so that they can be decisively engaged or attacks that isolate one element
from the main force so it can be destroyed piecemeal. CBRN R&S elements supporting retrograde operations
reconnaissance areas to find bypasses around contamination, allowing the force in retrograde to escape.
CBRN RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE DURING STABILITY OPERATIONS 
3-96. Stability operations may occur simultaneously with offensive and defensive operations. The joint force 
may be conducting major offensive operations, while forces in rear areas mitigate collateral damage and
restore essential services. Until the defeat of enemy conventional forces, the joint force conducts minimum
essential stability activities. Minimum essential stability activities should focus on protecting and facilitating
personal security and the well-being of the population. Stability operations typically begin with large military 
force support and eventually transition civil authority and infrastructure back to legitimate authorities.
Remaining pockets of enemy resistance are defeated and international and intergovernmental agencies assist
in returning the OE to reestablishing essential services and infrastructure.
3-97. With the exception of CBRN R&S support to special operations forces, CBRN R&S capabilities
conduct area reconnaissance that supports site assessment, characterization, and exploitation operations in
the AO where there is a reduced risk of direct and indirect fires. Area reconnaissance operations for site
exploitation are timely and require a security element to control access and clear structures of enemy forces
prior to CBRN R&S entry. Sample management and technical decontamination requirements are planning
considerations to ensure successful CBRN site exploitation.
3-98. Planners should clearly articulate in mission orders the locations where each level of identification for
CBRN samples can occur, laying the framework for the sequential chain of custody once sampling operations
are executed. CBRNE commands establish chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives
analytical and remediation activity (CARA) laboratories to conduct analytical support to all operational units.
Planning staffs must account for the correct CBRN R&S asset for detection and identification, with the
requisite of technology, sample media, supporting decontamination requirements, and transportation
requirements to execute sample management procedures correctly.
3-99. CBRN R&S capabilities may be applied in stability operations to assess damages to TIM facilities that
pose immediate risk to populations and support economic recovery. CBRN R&S capability provides
additional support to emergency first responders during stability operations.

CBRN RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE DURING TACTICAL ENABLING TASKS 
3-100. The following sections are a discussion on tasks that are part of offensive operations and tactical
enabling tasks. Not all tasks are included and some are specialized variations that are directly influenced by
CBRN R&S.
Security Tasks─Screen, Guard, Cover 
3-101. Security operations are those operations undertaken by a commander to provide early warning of
enemy operations, and to provide the force being protected with time and maneuver space to react to the
enemy. CBRN planners use the common security control measures described in FM 3-90-2 to depict the
execution of security operations in LSCO. Ultimately, security operations protect the main force from
surprise and reduce unknowns through joint ISR or information collection.
3-102. CBRN R&S supports security operations through the following security operation tasks of screen,
guard, and cover:

Screen. A screen is a type of security operations that primarily provides early warning to the
protected force (ADP 3-90). The area of a screen tends to be larger and more permissive than a
guard or cover operation. A screening force may be expected to—maintain continuous
surveillance into the AO; maintain contact with enemy forces and report their activities; allow no
enemy ground element to pass through the screen undetected and unreported; and impede, harass,
repel, or destroy all enemy reconnaissance patrols within its capabilities. Screens may be moving,
using methods described in FM 3-90-2 to execute them.

Guard. A guard is a type of security operations done to protect the main body by fighting to gain
time while observing and reporting information and preventing enemy ground observation of and
direct fire against the main body (ADP 3-90). Units conducting guard missions cannot operate
independently because they require additional support. A guard force may be expected to—
maintain continuous surveillance into the AO; maintain contact with enemy forces; allow no
enemy ground element to pass through the security area, impede and harass enemy forces; destroy
the enemy advanced guard; cause the withdrawal of enemy reconnaissance patrols; or deploy the
enemy main body.

Cover. Cover is a type of security operation done independently of the main body to protect them
by fighting to gain time while observing and reporting information and preventing enemy ground
observation of and direct fire against the main body (ADP 3-90). Cover operations may operate
out of range of the protected force so units must be organized within the enabling capabilities for
independent operations.
3-103. The JFC will identify the boundaries of the security area, phase lines, screen or delay lines, and
checkpoints to control operations. Contact points are established to facilitate coordination with flank units.
NAIs developed by CBRN and intelligence staffs assist in the determination of the placement and use of
CBRN R&S elements within maneuver formations. The JFC will determine initial LP/OP locations along or
behind the screen line to ensure effective surveillance of NAIs. Displacement locations and criteria should
be provided by the JFC. The JFC provides the time parameters for the security force, including when security
missions begin, move into position, execute mission task, and end. Engagement criteria is provided to the
security force, including CBRN R&S elements. Special requirements or constraints are provided by the JFC,
such as guidance for CBRN R&S elements operating within the supporting range of maneuver units. Local
security requirements are the tactical responsibility of CBRN R&S elements.
3-104. CBRN R&S capabilities, such as individually issued detection equipment and CBRN elements, are
placed in forward positions with other Cavalry formations to detect CBRN hazards and provide early warning
of CBRN attacks. Enemy CBRN attacks are anticipated to shape friendly forces (fix, disrupt, defeat) and the
OE (block), creating favorable conditions for the adversary. Placing CBRN R&S capabilities in deep areas
enables cavalry formations and other maneuver elements to exploit CBRN environments and expose enemy
assailable flanks.

ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
3-25
3-105. Prudent risk is a key factor in placing CBRN R&S capabilities in positions where they may be
engaged through enemy direct fire. All units and systems performing R&S in forward areas are vulnerable
to detection, engagement, and destruction by the enemy. When this occurs for CBRN R&S capabilities, it is
difficult to reconstitute them without significant resources. Prudent tactical decisions for mission preparation
in support of reconnaissance and security are further discussed in chapter 4.
Gap Crossing 
3-106. Gap crossing in support of maneuver elements is similar to breaching in that ground forces are
particularly vulnerable to CBRN attacks while moving through a breach lane or crossing at a bridge. The
vulnerability of CBRN attack on wet-gap crossing operations is typically increased due to the static nature
of bridging operations, making them targets for long-range fires and the use of CBRN to isolate the assault
force that has already crossed the gap from the remaining force on the nearside. A CBRN attack on wet-gap
crossings severs existing ground lines of communication, placing the assault force at risk of being cut off
from logistic lines. The flow of fuel, ammunition, and logistical supplies may be halted until CBRN R&S
can quickly assess the type and extent of contamination.
3-107. Figure 3-8 shows an example wet-gap crossing that would be managed at the division level or higher.
The assembly area is established to the west, where a unit could be initially staged for crossing the gap by
phase. Traffic control points are managed by military police and other elements to limit essential traffic along
the two routes to each respective area and finally the crossing site. Subsequent holding areas and staging
areas are created to sequence units as they cross according to the JFC’s priorities. The final area before
crossing the gap is the call forward area, where units conduct final staging and preparations for crossing.
Engineer equipment parks and engineer regulating points are used by engineers to further manage the wet-
gap crossing site and traffic flow.
3-108. Two CBRN dismounted platoons are positioned within the engineer equipment park, near the gap
crossing in a surveillance role. They are positioned close to gap crossings to alert forces that are staging in
the event of a CBRN attack, reduce the hazard by early warning. A third CBRN dismounted platoon supports
surveillance in the AA. During CBRN attacks, they determine the limits of contamination along the routes.
In the event of an attack, the CBRN platoons reconnaissance the routes across the wet-gap crossing from the
assembly area and along the routes to the far side traffic control point to determine the area, type, and duration
of hazard. They determine potential clean routes with the support of the engineer assets. Mounted CBRN
platoons execute route reconnaissance faster, but dismounted platoons provide better point detection on the
bridge and engineering equipment. For more information on gap-crossing sites, see ATP 3-90.4/MCWP
3-17.8.

Combined Arms Breaching Operations 
3-109. Combined arms breaching under CBRN conditions are high-risk operations and conducted by a
brigade or battalion-size task force. Combined arms breaching operations are extremely vulnerable to CBRN
attacks due to frequent enemy observation and increased complexity of an already hazardous OE. During the
breaching of an obstacle, engineers and other maneuver elements assault through an obstacle that may
constitute several explosive hazards, tank ditches, wire obstacles, and incorporated terrain to deny freedom
of maneuver. The acronym SOSRA (suppress, obscure, secure, reduce, assault) describes the fundamentals
of breaching an obstacle. CBRN attacks on an obstacle limits the maneuver force’s ability to secure the
obstacle, reduce a lane (thereby creating an opening for ground movement), and assault a larger ground force
through it. Engineer elements are limited in reducing, proofing, and marking an obstacle lane if it is
contaminated due to the increased CBRN risk to forces during dismounted operations. CBRN attacks are
likely to be used to disrupt mobility operations transitions between obstacles.
3-110. Figure 3-9 illustrates how CBRN R&S elements can be placed into combined arms teams to
aggressively exploit CBRN environments and penetrate enemy defensive obstacles. When prudent tactical
risk has been accepted, CBRN R&S supports breaching to expose enemy assailable flanks and weak points.
They can provide CBRN surveillance to combined arms breaching assets while securing the obstacle. When
CBRN attacks occur during breaching operations, CBRN R&S capabilities identify the type and duration of
contamination used on the obstacle, providing the maneuver commander with hazard awareness and
understanding. Upon successful penetration of the obstacle, CBRN R&S assists in identifying the extent of
contamination on friendly equipment and personnel, minimizing decontamination requirements.
3-111. An enemy mechanized infantry platoon is established on OBJ EAGLE and represents an enemy
weak point along a larger obstacle belt. The battalion commander task organizes two combined arms teams
with mechanized infantry, armor, engineer, and mounted CBRN R&S sections to breach the enemy obstacle,
setting the conditions for follow-on forces to penetrate deep into enemy held terrain. CBRN R&S elements
conduct surveillance on the nearside of the obstacle, using a stand-off or remote detection capability. In this
scenario, the enemy recognizes the weakness in the defensive perimeter and deploys a persistent nerve agent
strike using 122-millimeter rockets launched from a supporting enemy Prima rocket battery.
3-112. One CBRN R&S section follows and supports the main effort assaulting through the reduced lane
onto OBJ Eagle and assesses contamination on the assault element on the far side. The second CBRN R&S
section monitors the nearside of the obstacle. The CBRN R&S elements on the far side and nearside of the
objective push data to the battalion CBRN cell to provide an understanding of the extent of the contamination
and implied impacts to follow-on forces. Both elements help minimize cross contamination and allow the
commander to assess prudent risk in fighting in a contaminated environment. The JFC’s force is able to
SOSRA into OBJ EAGLE, opening a penetration in the enemy obstacle.

Preparation Activities 
This chapter provides CBRN R&S preparation activities for CBRN leaders and units 
at the tactical level. CBRN R&S preparation includes those activities undertaken by 
the R&S element after they receive a mission from their higher headquarters, and prior 
to mission execution to improve their ability to conduct the operation. CBRN R&S 
preparation may include troop leading procedures, precombat checks and inspections, 
rehearsals, reconnaissance, coordination, and linkup with supported units.  
CBRN RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE MISSION 
PREPARATION 
4-1. Planning and preparation overlap to ensure effective time management and synchronized efforts. As
the higher headquarters commander and staff plan missions, CBRN units with R&S elements conduct
preparations to execute missions. Joint force commands that control CBRN R&S forces execute the following 
tasks to support preparations:

Issue WARNORD as incoming updates to the mission are received.

Develop and issue OPORDs, giving the tactical unit two-thirds of the time available for
preparation.

Issue fragmentary orders to adjust the plan as necessary.

Update and refine running estimates, troop to task matrixes, CBRN common operational pictures.

Receive, submit, and track requests for information.

Provide refined intelligence briefings to inform the most accurate enemy actions, locations,
dispositions, and impacts to the CBRN R&S element.

Coordinate for sustainment requirements to support CBRN R&S missions with the gaining unit
staff.

Receive confirmation briefs and issue the final approval of CBRN R&S element plans.

Coordinate with command surgeon and medical staff for education/training, administration, and
distribution of medical CBRN countermeasures and information on signs and symptoms of
exposures to CBRN hazard.
4-2. Leaders ensure that all subordinate echelons have sufficient time for their own planning and
preparation needs. Generally, leaders at all levels use no more than one-third of the available time for
planning and issuing the OPORD. Leaders allocate the remaining two-thirds of it to subordinates.
4-3. CBRN R&S elements receive planned missions from their parent headquarters, or their supported
command. CBRN R&S leadership use the troop leading procedures when they receive OPORDs from parent
or supported units. TLPs provide leaders with a framework for tactical planning and preparation that works
in parallel with MDMP/MCPP. Because of this, it is important for the higher headquarters to deliver the
WARNORD to subordinates as soon as possible to facilitate parallel planning and synchronized execution.
The importance of parallel planning is highlighted by figure 4-1, page 4-2, which shows the parallel
sequences of MDMP/MCPP to the TLPs.

4-4. TLPs are supported by risk management. TLP consist of the following eight steps, as described in a
CBRN R&S preparation context.
STEP 1: RECEIVE THE MISSION 
4-5. The receipt of the mission may occur in several ways. Ideally, CBRN R&S forces receive a series of
WARNORDs, the OPORD, and a mission briefing from their commander. CBRN R&S, as part of a larger
information collection plan, usually receive missions during WARNORD 1, before the final OPORD arrives
from a higher headquarters. Then they must take immediate action to conduct a tactical movement,
establishing contact with the supported unit if they are not already collocated with them. Information in
WARNORD 1 may only have the essential information to linkup the CBRN R&S element and supported unit
for an upcoming CBRN R&S mission. WARNORD 2 follows from either the parent or the supported unit,
(for example, a brigade combat team) providing the essential details of the mission to be executed.
4-6. After receiving an OPORD, CBRN R&S leaders give a confirmation brief to the supported unit
commander, ensuring a clear understanding of the commander’s intent and support requirements. TLPs may
begin when a fragmentary orders is received via communication system, requiring the unit to adjust their
plan in stride.
4-7. Upon receipt of the mission, leaders perform an initial assessment of the situation and allocate time
available for preparations. Leaders identify critical times specified by higher headquarters and work back
from them, estimating how much time each event will consume. Leaders then identify the times they must
complete major planning and preparation events, including rehearsals using reverse planning. Preparations
include unit load plans, logistical preparation, rehearsals, and initial movement.

4-3
4-8. Critical times might include times to load aircraft, cross the line of departure, the start point for
movement, or linkup with security elements. Leaders ensure that all subordinate troops have sufficient time
for their own planning and preparation needs.
4-9. Lastly, CBRN R&S leaders submit requests for information addressing questions or information gaps
regarding the mission variables METT-TC/METT-T to the higher headquarters staff. This represents one of
the last opportunities for the higher headquarters to push valuable updated intelligence about the enemy or
OE to CBRN R&S forces prior to the start of the mission.
STEP 2: ISSUE THE WARNING ORDER 
4-10. As soon as CBRN R&S leaders finish their initial assessment of the situation and available time, they
issue a WARNORD to subordinates. Leaders do not wait for more information, but act on disciplined
initiative until requests for information fill information gaps. They issue the best WARNORD possible with
the information at hand and update subordinates as needed with additional WARNORDs. The WARNORD
contains as much information as possible, providing the leader’s planning timeline and follows the 5-
paragraph OPORD format. For more information regarding WARNORD and OPORD formats, see FM 6-0.
STEP 3: MAKE A TENTATIVE PLAN 
4-11. Once leaders issue the first WARNORD, CBRN R&S leaders develop a tentative plan that combines
the mission variables and terrain analysis. To frame the tentative plan, leaders use the METT-TC/METT-T
format, continuing the initial assessment performed in step 1.

Mission. The mission is the task, together with the purpose, that clearly articulates actions to be
taken and the reasons therefore. It is always the first variable commanders consider during decision
making. A mission statement contains the who, what, when, where, and why of an operation.

Enemy. The second variable to consider is the enemy. With the most up-to-date intelligence
possible, CBRN R&S should understand enemy organizations, troop strength, equipment
(especially equipment that may help positively identify agents at an NAI), known and suspected
enemy locations, capabilities, vulnerabilities, and probable courses of action. CBRN R&S leaders
should have a thorough understanding of enemy doctrine, systems, and the most recent tactics,
techniques, and procedures. CBRN R&S leaders may set conditions for overmatch of enemy
forces through understanding enemy weapon types, weapon system ranges and armor penetration
in direct fire engagements. Leaders should understand how to defeat enemy capabilities through
tactical dispersion, deception, electronic warfare, and camouflage systems.

Terrain and weather. Terrain includes dominant natural features and man-made features that
have direct influence or impacts on the mission. Leaders analyze terrain using the five military
aspects of terrain expressed in the memory aid OAKOC:

Observation and fields of fire. R&S leaders consider movement to and from listening post
/OP or NAIs. Leaders should determine whether R&S assets can maximize observation and
sensing of NAIs from their LP/OP without revealing their positions or the deployment of
unmanned systems that are within range. Tactical leaders ensure that CBRN R&S forces are
able to execute missions within the supporting range of other maneuver or security elements
should they become decisively engaged by enemy systems beyond their capability.

Avenues of approach. Leaders determine where the enemy may approach the NAI from. If
in an urban environment, it is important to consider where the enemy may attack from using
the population and structures to mask movement and maneuver. If an inner and outer cordon
or hot/warm/cold zone is required for the mission, determine how it will impede movement
by security elements and reinforcing units. During forward or rear passage of lines, all leaders
in the CBRN R&S element should know the location and condition of the infiltration lane
from the release point to the LP/OP, if applicable. Avenues of approach should be selected
based upon minimizing friendly forces exposure to enemy observation, fields of fire, and
possible ambush locations.

4-4
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 

Key terrain. Leaders identify terrain that can be used for navigation that identifies PLs, the
line of departure, and the limit of advance (LOA). Boundaries of the route, area, or zone to
reconnoiter should be clearly identifiable and understood. A plan should identify primary and
alternate fighting positions, using lines of sight, low ground, and reverse slopes to their
advantage. Leaders should identify rally points, casualty collection points, and planned
decontamination points near water sources.

Obstacles. Leaders identify natural and man-made obstacles that may restrict movement
during missions. This may include local traffic along routes and water obstacles that must be
forded. CBRN strikes are likely to be used at breaks and ends of enemy obstacle belts to
surprise friendly forces attempting to reduce obstacles. Canalizing terrain that constricts
maneuver through smaller roads, trails, and valleys are favorable for enemy CBRN attacks.

Cover and concealment. Successful CBRN R&S relies heavily on blending into the terrain.
Plans should maximize the use of covered and concealed terrain features such as wadis, draws,
and spurs and prepared fighting positions. CBRN R&S forces use wood lines with heavy
vegetation and existing terrain to protect themselves from direct and indirect fires. The
enemy’s optical capabilities must be taken into consideration, particularly if thermal imaging
is used for target acquisition.
4-12. Weather should be accounted for using the higher command’s chemical downwind message. Wind
direction has a bearing on unmanned capability use, optic and sensor efficiency, downwind detection, spread
of contamination, and decontamination efforts. Variables to consider include—

Troops and support available. The need for close coordination with the supported unit is critical
in the preparation phase. CBRN R&S capabilities operate in another unit’s AO. It is imperative
that CBRN R&S units maintain communications during movement and maneuver with the land
owning unit and operate inside the supporting range of their direct or indirect fires. CBRN R&S
capabilities operating forward of the supported unit’s FLOT must understand the scheme of
maneuver for the security force to reduce the possibility of fratricide. The CBRN R&S leaders
coordinate movements with the supported unit, with a clear understanding of friendly obstacle
emplacement, passage lanes, and friendly battle positions. CBRN R&S must be trained in calling
for fire and requesting air support to defeat threats beyond their capabilities. The leader of the
CBRN R&S asset should obtain a copy of the fire support overlay before departure or coordinate
with the fire support officer to call for fire. CBRN R&S leaders must know which units can receive
resupply for all classes of sustainment. They should know where they can recover damaged
equipment and vehicles for repair or replacement. CBRN brigades, battalions, and companies may
have to develop a supply push of unique CBRN sustainment items to support CBRN R&S
elements that execute missions decentralized.

Time available. CBRN R&S leaders assess the time available for planning, preparing, and
executing tasks and operations. This includes the time required to assemble, rehearse, deploy, and
maneuver units in relationship to the enemy and conditions on the battlefield. For radiological
hazards, leaders consider turn back dose rate and OEG in determining time available in the hazard
area. If a CBRN R&S asset is dismounted, greater dose-rates and exposure to radiation hazards
may accumulate. For biological hazards, leaders should consider the potential for a time delay
between biological hazard exposure and CBRN R&S personnel demonstrating signs and
symptoms from biological hazard exposure.

Civil considerations. Civil considerations are the influence of manmade infrastructure, civilian
institutions, and attitudes and activities of the civilian leaders, populations, and organizations
within an area of operations on the conduct of military operations. (ADP 6-0) The memory aid
ASCOPE is used to address areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events to
address civil considerations. CBRN R&S elements may be asked to assist host-nation emergency
first responders or industrial hazardous materials (HAZMAT) teams in mitigating hazards. CBRN
R&S element requires the characteristics of industrial facilities that may impact freedom of
maneuver or require site assessment. CBRN R&S leaders must be aware of how receptive local
populations are to friendly forces to address local security concerns and compromise of LP/OP
positions, infiltration points, or rally points.

4-5
STEP 4: START NECESSARY MOVEMENT 
4-13. Upon completion of the tentative plan, CBRN R&S leaders may have already moved to their supported 
unit locations or may still be with their respective CBRN headquarters. Several preparation activities are
executed at the assembly area prior to movement. In the event that CBRN R&S units must move to a linkup
site to liaison with their supported unit, they may conduct a tactical road march from the friendly assembly
area to the gaining unit via movement control.
STEP 5: CONDUCT RECONNAISSANCE 
4-14. When time and circumstances allow, or as directed by the higher headquarters, leaders personally
observe the AO for the mission prior to execution. No amount of information from higher headquarters can
substitute firsthand assessment of the mission variables from within the AO. If on ground reconnaissance is
not possible, CBRN R&S leaders may leverage unmanned system video feeds and map reconnaissance
supplemented by images and geospatial intelligence products.
Note. It is important to operate any unmanned systems within the proper frequency bandwidth 
established by the joint restricted frequency list in the higher OPORD. CBRN R&S should 
coordinate with the brigade aviation element or joint tactical air controller to establish or operate 
within a restricted operation zone to adhere to airspace coordination measures when utilizing UAS. 
4-15. As directed, subordinate or other elements (such as scouts and CBRN R&S elements) may conduct
reconnaissance while the leader completes other TLP steps.
STEP 6. COMPLETE THE PLAN 
4-16. During this step, CBRN R&S leaders incorporate the results of reconnaissance into their selected plan
to complete the order. This includes preparing tactical overlays to share with subordinate CBRN R&S leaders, 
refining the indirect fire target list, close air support, cyber and electronic warfare coverage, coordinating
communications and signal requirements using PACE, and updating the tentative plan because of
reconnaissance. At lower levels, this step may entail only confirming or updating information contained in
the tentative plan. If time allows, leaders make final coordination with adjacent units and higher headquarters
before issuing the order.
STEP 7: ISSUE THE ORDER 
4-17. Small-unit orders are normally issued verbally and supplemented by digital and analogue tactical
overlays, a sand table, geospatial intelligence, and other means. An order follows the standard five-paragraph
OPORD format. Typically, leaders below company level do not issue a commander’s intent. They reiterate
the intent of their higher and next higher commanders.
4-18. The ideal location for issuing the order is a point in the AO with a view of the objective and other
aspects of the terrain. The leader may perform a leader’s reconnaissance, complete the order, and then
summon subordinates to a specified location to receive it. Sometimes security or other constraints make it
impractical to issue the order on the terrain.
STEP 8: SUPERVISE AND REFINE 
4-19. Throughout TLP, leaders supervise mission preparations, refine the plan, coordinate with adjacent
units, and supervise and assess preparations. Normally, unit SOPs state individual responsibilities and the
sequence of preparation activities. To ensure that the unit is ready for the mission, leaders supervise
subordinates and inspect their personnel and equipment.

Precombat Checks and Inspections 
4-20. CBRN R&S leadership conducts precombat checks/precombat inspections) and readies equipment and
personnel for the upcoming mission. The following are examples, but not exhaustive of important precombat
checks/precombat inspections for CBRN R&S units prior to start of mission:

Conduct before operations preventive maintenance checks and services for all equipment being
taken on the mission to include protective masks and vehicle overpressure systems.

Clean and lubricate all weapons, along with headspace and timing and/or test fire for weapons.

Upload digital maps and overlays with physical alternatives in the event of cyberattack.

Replenishment of all classes of supply to execute missions based upon days of supply mission
requirements. Replenishment of CBRN sampling expendable items and decontamination supplies
are critical.

Execute communications checks for all digital, radio systems and communications security fill
and timing.

Conduct systems checks for any tactical electronic warfare equipment, ensuring that it does not
interfere with communications.

Ensure that IPE and decontamination requirements are met based upon the possible CBRN or TIM 
hazard.

Review contaminated casualty collection plans and requisition human remains pouches for the
contaminated casualty collection point.

Clean all optics and sensor surfaces that may be used.

Camouflage vehicles and tie-down vehicle antennas.
Rehearsals 
4-21. A crucial component of preparation is the rehearsal. Rehearsals allow leaders to assess their
subordinates’ preparations. They may identify areas that require more supervision. Leaders conduct
rehearsals to—

Practice essential tasks and actions on the objective.

Identify weaknesses or problems in the plan.

Coordinate subordinate element actions (especially if executing with another unit or maneuver
element).

Improve Service member understanding of the concept of operations.

Foster confidence among Service members.
4-22. Company and smaller sized units use the four types of rehearsals described in FM 6-0. Rehearsals
include—

Back brief.

Combined arms rehearsal.

Support rehearsal.

Battle drill or SOP rehearsal.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
4-23. CBRN R&S forces must consider command relationships and account for the nuances of working for
a supported unit to avoid becoming a burden for the supported headquarters. Movement control also needs
to be considered.
COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS
4-24. Establishing clear command and support relationships is a key task in task organizing for any joint
CBRN R&S operation. These relationships establish clear responsibilities and authorities between
subordinate and supporting units. Some command and support relationships limit the commander’s authority
to prescribe additional relationships. Knowing the inherent responsibilities of each command and support

4-7
relationship allows commanders to effectively organize CBRN R&S forces and helps supporting CBRN R&S 
leaders understand their unit’s role in the organizational structure. 
4-25. Army commanders build combined arms organizations using Army command and support
relationships. Command relationships define command responsibility and authority. Support relationships
define the desired purpose, scope, and effect when one capability supports another. JP 1 specifies joint
command relationships and FM 6-0 specifies Army command relationships.
4-26. It is important for JFCs and CBRN leadership to understand joint command relationships and how
these relationships impact R&S operations. For the purposes of this manual we will focus on operational
control, tactical control, and support.
4-27. Operational control is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces
involving—

Organizing and employing CBRN R&S capabilities.

Assigning tasks.

Designating objectives.

Giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish missions.
4-28. Operational control normally includes authority over all aspects of operations and joint training
necessary to accomplish missions. It does not include directive authority for logistics or matters of
administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
4-29. Tactical control is the authority over forces that is limited to the detailed direction and control of
movements or maneuvers within the operational area necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned.
(JP 1) Tactical control allows commanders below combatant command (CCMD) level to apply force and
direct tactical use of logistic assets, but does not provide authority to change organizational structure or direct
administrative and logistical support.
4-30. Support is a command authority in joint doctrine. A supported and supporting relationship is
established by a superior commander between subordinate commanders when one organization should aid,
protect, complement, or sustain another force. Designating supporting relationships is important. It conveys
priorities to commanders and staffs planning or executing joint operations. Designating a support relationship
does not provide authority to organize and employ commands and forces, nor does it include authoritative
direction for administrative and logistic support.
4-31. Direct support is the most common support category used by CBRN R&S. The CBRN brigade,
battalion, or company will allocate their CBRN R&S platoons or teams to support a gaining unit (such as a
cavalry squadron or brigade combat team). For more information regarding joint command and support
relationships, refer to JP 3-0. For Army specific command and support relationships, refer to FM 6-0.
MOVEMENT CONTROL
4-32. Movement control is the planning, routing, scheduling, and control of personnel and cargo movements
over lines of communications; includes maintaining in-transit visibility of forces and material through the
deployment and/or redeployment process. (JP 4-01.5) As the next higher echelon (typically a battalion or
company) plans and coordinates movement from assembly areas along designated routes, CBRN R&S forces
denote start points, LDs, check points, traffic control points, and release points as graphic control measures
on a map. The higher headquarters and the gaining unit should share the concept of movement sketch and
track the subordinate element’s movement until the unit has completed movement.
4-33. A tactical road march is a rapid movement used to relocate units within an AO to prepare for combat
operations. CBRN R&S units must understand all unit boundaries they cross during tactical road marches to
provide higher echelons an understanding of vehicle movement within their respective AO and to prevent
fratricide.

4-34. CBRN R&S leaders use tactical graphics to provide mutual understanding of the OE, mission, and the
locations of enemy or adversary and friendly forces in relation to themselves. Tactical graphics are depicted
with graphic control measures specific to the mission. It is critical to mission success for CBRN R&S forces
to be able to understand operational terms and graphics, and to plan missions using tactical graphics. The
minimum essential graphics for a tactical road march are depicted in figure 4-2.

4-35. In figure 4-2 the CBRN R&S unit begins movement from the southern AA. The start point is a location 
on a route where the marching elements fall under control of a designated march commander, such as a
security force that escorts the movement. A line of departure, in land warfare, is a line designated to
coordinate the departure of attack elements. In this case, CBRN R&S elements are not attacking, but the use
of the line of departure is used to report to the higher CBRN headquarters and gaining unit that initial
movement has begun. The main route (route [RTE] CHEVY) is marked by a solid line, and the alternate
route (RTE DODGE) is marked with a dotted line. The CBRN R&S leader or unit commander may designate
checkpoints along the route to assist marching units in complying with the mission timetable. This allows
tactical operations centers to track unit movement throughout the unit AOs. Checkpoints are established
along the route where interference with movement might occur. Traffic control points are placed along the
route where congestion, gap crossings, or confusion may occur. A release point is used, denoting the location
on the route where marching elements are released from centralized control, typically at the end of the tactical
movement.

4-36. If required, the CBRN R&S element’s controlling headquarters coordinates with the supported unit to
establish a predesignated contact point. In land warfare, a contact point (a point on the terrain that is easily
identifiable) is where two or more units are required to make contact. This is particularly important if the
gaining unit is in contact with enemy forces and may inadvertently engage the CBRN R&S element moving
towards them.

Chapter 5 
Execution Activities 
Chapter 5 provides an overview of CBRN R&S forms, modes, methods, tasks, and 
techniques used to conduct CBRN R&S missions. When conducting CBRN R&S 
missions, multiple variations of the types, methods, and CBRN R&S tasks and 
techniques can be used. CBRN R&S leaders plan and prepare their elements for 
missions, using execution activities as a guideline for actions on the reconnaissance 
objective or throughout the course of surveillance. There is no standard set or 
combination of execution activities that must be used. METT-C and METT-T is used 
during planning and preparation to determine the best course of action for their use. 
Specific guidance, acceptable risks, and time/terrain constraints are also factors that 
affect CBRN R&S mission execution. CBRN staffs and commanders use mission 
analysis and METT-TC/METT-T to determine when and where the different execution 
activities are appropriate to accomplish the mission. The operational tempo of 
supported forces, enemy disposition, level of sampling or detail at sites; available 
CBRN R&S forces, size of the area, zone, or route/location; type of terrain; and 
environmental conditions are all critical details that shape how a CBRN R&S mission 
is executed. 
CBRN RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE APPROACH 
5-1. CBRN R&S is executed with a progressive approach to maximize usage of all available information
collection assets, minimize risk to forces, and create greater certainty of CBRN hazard presence. The tiers do
not have to be executed sequentially, although they are designed to economize CBRN R&S capabilities and
place them where increased CBRN threats are likely. Note that the four tiers provide incremental information
fidelity through multiple technologies and sensors. See figure 5-1, page 5-2, for the CBRN R&S execution
framework. The four tiers of the CBRN R&S approach are─

Indirect. Indirect CBRN R&S describes the employment of technologies, sensors, and
intelligence platforms that are not directly in the physical domain of the potential CBRN hazards.
Indirect CBRN R&S is reconnaissance or surveillance that minimizes immediate risk to forces
and provides information about an NAI that might cue follow-on CBRN R&S. An example of
indirect CBRN R&S includes multispectral and hyper-spectral satellite imagery which is not in
the direct physical environment, but can provide data on ground, water, and air conditions of the
NAI without risk of contamination. A nuclear detonation can also be detected by space assets
which are less likely to be affected by the nuclear detonation than ground based sensors. This
minimizes risk, and provides sufficient details to cue a follow-on CBRN R&S mission in the
physical environment.

Standoff. Standoff CBRN R&S is the employment of technologies and sensors in the direct
physical domain, within direct view of the potential CBRN hazard, while maintaining sufficient
distance, time, and shielding to minimize risk to forces. Crucial to standoff capabilities is the
weather and environment effects such as dust, fog, and vegetation that may obscure the line of
sight for sensors. An example of standoff CBRN R&S is the use of the nuclear, biological, and
chemical reconnaissance vehicle from an LP/OP on a potential CBRN hazard.

31 March 2021 

Remote. Remote CBRN R&S is the employment of unmanned technologies and sensors in the
direct physical domain of the CBRN hazard to gather information within a potentially
contaminated area. The benefit of the remote CBRN R&S tier is that it provides greater fidelity of
information from a more direct line of sight for optics and sensor employment, while not
endangering forces to enemy fires or contamination. It also facilitates a more rapid assessment of
the CBRN hazard over a large area. The downside of remote CBRN R&S is that the equipment,
once potentially contaminated, may not be able to return to the controlling element until
decontamination of the unmanned system is conducted. Unmanned ground or air sensors,
stationary or mounted on unmanned vehicles can provide a remote approach to providing CBRN
hazard information. An example of remote CBRN R&S is the employment of unmanned ground
or air sensors, stationary or mounted on unmanned vehicles to gain CBRN hazard information on
a particular area.

Direct. Direct CBRN R&S provides the greatest fidelity of information about the CBRN hazard.
However, the risk of CBRN R&S forces is greatest during direct CBRN R&S due to exposure to
enemy fires and potential contamination. Often, direct CBRN R&S capability requires a dedicated
security force and preplanned decontamination capability to mitigate risk. The time on NAIs and
the proximity of enemy forces heavily impacts the risk decision to employ direct CBRN R&S.
Direct CBRN R&S is the means for forces to conduct CBRN site exploitation and sampling
operations. An example of direct CBRN R&S is the employment of a joint dismounted capability
to conduct a site survey of potential contamination.

METHODS OF CBRN RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE 
5-2. CBRN R&S within the physical domain of the hazard is executed through four primary methods. They 
are discussed in the paragraphs below.
MOUNTED 
5-3. Mounted CBRN R&S operations are usually performed to rapidly gather information across large areas
of terrain, keeping pace with maneuver forces, while minimizing the exposure of personnel to CBRN hazards.
Many vehicles used to conduct mounted CBRN R&S have existing shielding and onboard air filtration
systems. They may employ standoff, remote, and direct CBRN R&S capabilities to gather information on
NAIs. See ATP 3-11.36/MCRP 10-10E.1/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70 for further descriptions of these
assets and unit designations. See appendix C for more information on the execution of mounted CBRN R&S
in support of the joint force.
DISMOUNTED 
5-4. Dismounted CBRN R&S are operations conducted mainly on foot, with limited vehicular support.
They facilitate greater employment of technologies within a hazard area to conduct CBRN supporting tasks
such as detect, locate, and sample. They require greater time, security, and assumption of risk than mounted
CBRN R&S operations. The following conditions may require dismounted CBRN R&S:

Dense urban environments, restrictive terrain, or subterranean facilities are in the AO that would
limit and encumber mounted operations.

The employment of CBRN R&S forces to conduct area reconnaissance on an NAI of operational
or strategic importance, requiring multiple samples and technologies.

Assessment, characterization, and site exploitation in support of a larger combined arms CWMD
operation.

Potential presence of an enemy WMD weapons cache, transloading site, or production site.
AERIAL 
5-5. Typically, aerial CBRN R&S operations are conducted during radiological surveys of large areas, such
as dense urban environments where a nuclear strike has occurred. Aerial R&S operations cover a larger area
in a shorter period than ground mounted and dismounted operations. It provides added protection for military
personnel by limiting distance and time of exposure to take readings that can be converted into actual ground
readings using an air-ground correlation factor. (See appendix D for more information on aerial CBRN R&S.) 
UNMANNED 
5-6. Unmanned CBRN R&S are conducted by leveraging technologies and sensors controlled from a
different location within the AO through a communications infrastructure such as a link or electronic tether
to detect and monitor potential CBRN hazards. These UASs and UGVs are typically recoverable. These
systems minimize exposure of personnel to enemy direct and indirect fires and potential CBRN hazards.
CBRN R&S elements may employ these systems from LP/OPs, maintaining their respective hide and
defensive positions. Multiple unmanned sensors may be employed at multiple positions or vehicles in
sustainment nodes to provide hazard awareness and understanding of eminent CBRN threats to personnel,
supplies, and equipment.
CBRN RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE COMMON 
SUPPORTING TASKS 
5-7. CBRN R&S elements are first and fundamentally reconnaissance formations, operating in contested
terrain, in close proximity to enemy forces, and part of a limited, critical number of assets providing
information to the commander and a critical operational phase. CBRN R&S elements are capable of many of
the same reconnaissance tasks as cavalry, infantry, or armor reconnaissance elements. While conducting

reconnaissance operations, CBRN R&S elements will capitalize on their observation of NAIs to answer all 
PIRs, in addition to their CBRN-specific tasks, CBRN R&S units may— 

Find and report all enemy forces within the zone.

Engage or support engagement of enemy forces in the designated AO within the capability of the
unit conducting reconnaissance, based on engagement criteria.

Determine the trafficability of all terrain in the zone, including built-up areas.

Locate and determine the extent of all contaminated areas in the zone.

Inspect and classify bridges within the zone.

Locate fords or crossing sites within the zone.

Inspect and classify overpasses, underpasses, and culverts.

Locate mines, obstacles, and barriers in the zone.

Report reconnaissance information.
5-8. Based on priority the commander may direct the following:

Reconnoiter all terrain within the zone.

Reconnoiter specific terrain within the zone.

Locate bypass around built-up area, obstacles, and contaminated areas.
5-9. The following describe the common CBRN supporting tasks executed in support of both R&S
missions:

Detect CBRN hazards. Detecting CBRN hazards is described as determining the presence of a
CBRN hazard in the environment.

Identify CBRN hazards. Identifying CBRN hazards is described as determining the specific
CBRN hazard present in the environment. The identification levels are presumptive, field
confirmatory, theater validation, and definitive. Further details on CBRN identification levels can
be found in chapter 2.

Quantify CBRN hazards. Quantifying CBRN hazards is described as determining the amount of
the specific CBRN hazard present in the environment.

Sampling CBRN materials. Collecting CBRN samples is described as obtaining a representative
amount of the CBRN hazard for subsequent analysis. Environmental samples include air, water,
soil, food, vegetation, and insects. They can include liquids, solids, or vapors. Clinical/medical
specimens are collected only by medical providers. Further details on sampling can be found in
chapter 6.

Report CBRN hazards. Reporting is described as providing relevant information about the
CBRN hazard and other related data. The commander’s information requirements drive CBRN
R&S. Reporting information derived from CBRN R&S provides answers to the commander’s
information requirements. Reporting must be timely, accurate, and as complete as possible to
ensure effective and informed operational decision making and to support medical assessment and
surveillance determinations.
SECTION I: RECONNAISSANCE TYPES AND TASKS 
5-10. The three types of CBRN reconnaissance are route, zone, and area. This section describes each type as
well as the unique tasks of CBRN reconnaissance-locate, survey, and mark.
ROUTE RECONNAISSANCE 
5-11. Route reconnaissance is a type of reconnaissance operation to obtain detailed information of a
specified route and all terrain from which the enemy could influence movement along that route (ADP
3-90). It is a type of reconnaissance that focuses along a specific line of communications, logistics, and travel
(a road, railway, or cross-country mobility corridor). CBRN route reconnaissance provides new or updated
information on route conditions such as obstacles and bridge classifications, and adversary and civilian
activity along the route. A route reconnaissance includes not only the route itself, but also all terrain along
the route from which the adversary could influence the movement of friendly forces. The commander

normally assigns this mission when wanting to use a specific route for friendly movement or when 
information collection assets determine possible CBRN usage along a line of communication. 
5-12. When the commander’s JIPOE/IPB indicates that there is a high likelihood of contamination along the
route, a unit (particularly a CBRN R&S element) is given the specific mission to conduct a CBRN route
reconnaissance. The CBRN route reconnaissance proceeds faster than a CBRN zone reconnaissance. Once
contamination is detected, the R&S element has the following options:

Conduct a CBRN survey to define the boundaries of the contamination to determine the extent of
contamination.

Locate and mark clear bypass routes. (This does not require determining the entire extent of
contamination.)

Report and mark CBRN hazards along the route.
5-13. The following critical tasks are conducted during a route reconnaissance:

Reconnoiter terrain along the route.

Locate and mark the nearside and far side of contamination on the route.

Report all information.
5-14. Typical CBRN route reconnaissance procedures are—

Locate, survey, and report contamination that can influence movement along the route.

Reconnoiter terrain that the adversary can use to dominate movement along the route, such as,
choke points and ambush sites within the CBRN hazard area.

Reconnoiter built-up areas, contaminated areas, and lateral routes along the route.

Locate any fords, crossing sites, or bypasses for existing and reinforcing obstacles (including built-
up areas) along the route that can be used to avoid or bypass the CBRN hazard.

Identify obstacles in the execution of CBRN route reconnaissance.

Report and mark CBRN hazards along the route.

Conduct a CBRN survey to define the boundaries of the contamination.

Report information according to the communication plan when initiating the CBRN route
reconnaissance mission, including a sketch and a CBRN 4 report.

Mark the contaminated area.

Request decontamination support if necessary.
5-15. The minimum essential graphics for CBRN route reconnaissance include the area boundaries,
providing situational understanding of adjacent unit operations. Unlike a tactical road march, phase lines are
used for synchronization and movement control from the line of departure to the RP. Checkpoints are
established along the route being reconnoitered or the CBRN R&S leader may use an identifiable terrain
feature to maintain orientation and keep the higher headquarters abreast of the unit location. NAIs are
established and enumerated where information, specific to the mission, is to be collected. Targets for field
artillery may be placed on the tactical graphics where the CBRN R&S element may acquire enemy forces.
The target numbers should be coordinated with and tracked by the higher headquarters fire support
coordination officer. Figure 5-2, page 5-6, shows an example of what graphic control measures should be
utilized by CBRN R&S elements conducting route reconnaissance.

ZONE RECONNAISSANCE 
5-16. Zone reconnaissance is a type of reconnaissance operation that involves a directed effort to obtain
detailed information on all routes, obstacles (existing and reinforcing), terrain, and enemy forces within a
zone defined by boundaries. CBRN contaminated areas should be considered obstacles. The commander
assigns a zone reconnaissance mission when the commander needs additional information on a zone before
committing other forces in the zone. It is appropriate when the enemy situation is vague, existing knowledge
of the terrain is limited, or combat operations have altered the terrain. See ADP 3-90 for more information
on zone reconnaissance.
5-17. A zone reconnaissance is a deliberate, time-consuming process that requires a substantial commitment
of resources. A zone reconnaissance may include several route or area reconnaissance missions assigned to
subordinate units. A zone reconnaissance is normally conducted over an extended distance and starts from a
line of departure. It requires all ground elements executing the zone reconnaissance to be employed abreast
of each other. A reconnaissance unit cannot disregard terrain when focusing on the enemy. However, it
minimizes its terrain reconnaissance to that which may influence an NAI, such as CBRN reconnaissance.

5-7
5-18. Previous reports or intelligence may indicate a high probability of past CBRN attacks within the zone.
Once contamination is detected, the R&S element has the following options:

Conduct a CBRN survey to define the boundaries of the contamination.

Locate and mark clean bypass routes around the contaminated area within the zone.

Terminate the mission and move to the coordinated decontamination point.
5-19. Unless specifically directed by the commander, critical tasks must be accomplished during a zone
reconnaissance. The commander may direct the reconnaissance toward specific information requirement
only, based on the time available and his intent. The following critical tasks are conducted during a zone
reconnaissance:

Reconnoiter terrain within the zone for CBRN contamination.

Locate previously reported CBRN attack areas and determine if there is still a hazard.

Locate possible contamination within the zone.

Verify the location of commercial TIM facilities.

Report information.

Mark contaminated areas.

Locate routes to bypass contamination.
5-20. The typical zone reconnaissance procedures are─

Locate all previously reported CBRN attack areas and determine if there is still a hazard.

Reconnoiter all terrain within the zone for contamination.

Locate any fords, crossing sites, or bypasses for existing and reinforcing obstacles (including built-
up areas) within the zone to avoid or bypass CBRN hazards.

Identify and report all enemy CBRN delivery and storage capabilities within the zone.

Identify and report all obstacles in the execution of CBRN zone reconnaissance.

Report and mark all CBRN hazards within the zone.

Locate and mark bypass routes for other forces if contamination is encountered.

Conduct a CBRN survey to define the boundaries of the contamination.

Report information according to the communication plan when initiating the CBRN zone
reconnaissance mission, including a sketch and photographs if available, and CBRN 4 report.

Mark contaminated areas.

Request decontamination support if necessary.
5-21. The commander controls a zone reconnaissance by assigning an AO to the unit conducting the
reconnaissance. (See figure 5-3, page 5-8.) The lateral boundaries, a line of departure, and a limit of advance
define this AO. Within the AO, the force conducting the zone reconnaissance further divides the AO with
additional lateral boundaries to define subordinate unit AOs. CBRN R&S elements are integrated with a unit
that controls the AO. Subordinate AOs are not necessarily the same size. Phase lines and contact points,
located where the commander determines that it is necessary for adjacent units to make physical contact, are
used to coordinate the movement of elements operating abreast. The commander may further designate the
time that this physical contact takes place. Checkpoints indicate critical terrain features and help to coordinate
air-ground integration. The commander may use fire support coordination measures to control direct and
indirect fires and use additional control measures as necessary. In addition, the commander assigning the
zone reconnaissance mission must specify the route the reconnaissance unit uses to enter the AO. All control
measures are on recognizable terrain when possible.

AREA RECONNAISSANCE 
5-22. Area reconnaissance is a type of reconnaissance operation that focuses on obtaining detailed
information about the terrain or enemy activity within a prescribed area (ADP 3-90). This area may include
a town, a ridgeline, woods, an airhead, or any other critical operational feature. The area may consist of a
single point, such as a bridge or an installation. The primary difference between an area reconnaissance and
a zone reconnaissance is that in an area reconnaissance, units first move to the designated area in which the
area reconnaissance will occur. However, when the reconnaissance objective is the enemy force, a
commander may forgo a detailed reconnaissance of the zone and focus assets on those NAI that would reveal
enemy dispositions and intentions. In a zone reconnaissance the units start from a line of departure. Areas
are normally smaller than zones and are not usually contiguous to other friendly areas targeted for
reconnaissance. Because the area is smaller, an area reconnaissance typically takes less time to complete than
a zone reconnaissance.

5-23. Examples of area reconnaissance missions assigned to a CBRN R&S elements are─

Reconnaissance of a site where WMDs are being manufactured, filled, or stored; or precursors
and components of WMDs are manufactured or stored.

Contaminated areas whether intentional, accidental, or through collateral damage.

During fixed-site operations (naval seaports, airfields, land component operations).
5-24. If contamination is detected, the CBRN R&S element performs a survey to define the boundaries of
the contamination. If the CBRN R&S asset is supporting an offensive or defensive operations in the close or
deep areas, locate and mark the hazard area and report the site, providing sufficient information to pass the
site to another unit. If there is no contamination determined, the unit requests to terminate the mission.
5-25. The following critical tasks are conducted during an area reconnaissance:

Locate and mark CBRN hazards within the area.

Conduct a site survey (if required).

Conduct sampling operations (if required).

Locate bypass routes around identified contaminated areas.

Report all information to higher and adjacent units.
5-26. The commander assigning an area reconnaissance specifies the area for reconnaissance with a single
continuous line to enclose the area to reconnoiter. In figure 5-4, AO LEAVENWORTH represents the area
the commander wants reconnoitered. Alternatively, the commander may designate the area by marking lateral
boundaries, a LD, and a LOA. An area reconnaissance mission specifies the route to take in moving to the
area. Upon completion of the area reconnaissance, the unit normally departs the area on a different route. The
commander of the unit conducting the area reconnaissance mission uses control measures for a zone
reconnaissance in the AO to control subordinate element operations. Figure 5-4 shows an example of an area

5-27. In special circumstances the CBRN R&S element may be required to undertake reconnaissance of a
specific location of interest to the commander. These are generally called site assessments, characterizations,
and exploitations. For more information, see ATP 3-90.15 and ATP 3-90.40.
CBRN RECONNAISSANCE UNIQUE SUPPORTING TASKS 
5-28. CBRN R&S operations are executed, using the forms of R&S to describe the mission statement. There
are unique CBRN R&S supporting tasks to execute missions. These support tasks may be specified or implied 
by JFCs within the OPORD or fragmentary order. When the commander requires detailed information on a
suspected contaminated area, a CBRN survey may be directed. A CBRN survey determines the type, nature
and extent of the CBRN hazards. This may include measuring radiation and concentration of chemical
hazards, determining the presence of biological hazards, and sampling.
5-29. The tasks are─

Locate CBRN hazards. Locating CBRN hazards is described as finding the place where the
CBRN hazard exists. To locate CBRN hazards, the zigzag, lane, cloverleaf, or grid techniques can
be used. Further details on these techniques are provided later in this chapter.

Survey CBRN hazards. Surveying CBRN hazards is described as the active effort to determine
the extent of contamination of CBRN hazards. This is typically in open terrain, where other units
require freedom of maneuver. Both mounted and dismounted CBRN R&S units can execute this
task. However, mounted CBRN R&S elements can conduct this task much faster when operational
tempo is critical. When conducting a CBRN survey the nearside-far side, box, star, bounce and
bypass, course leg, or preselected dose rate techniques can be used.

Mark CBRN hazards. Marking CBRN hazards is described as the use of visual or other
indicators to warn others of the presence of a CBRN agent in a particular area/location. When
marking a CBRN hazard, hasty or deliberate techniques are used. The methods of marking are
contingent upon specific unit SOPs and should address the possibility of marking a contaminated
area within an obstacle or with unexploded explosive ordnance present. Further details on these
techniques are provided later in this chapter.
RECONNAISSANCE TECHNIQUES 
5-30. The CBRN reconnaissance techniques provide recommended and proven tactics they may apply to
both mounted and dismounted CBRN reconnaissance. Appendix B and appendix C provide guidance specific
to mounted and dismounted operations for each technique. The CBRN reconnaissance techniques are─

Zigzag. The zigzag CBRN reconnaissance technique is used to locate contamination areas during
route, zone, and area reconnaissance missions. The zigzag technique involves many turns, and a
high level of maneuverability is required when conducting this technique.

Star. The star survey technique is a very quick way to determine the rough limits of a contaminated
area.

Cloverleaf. The cloverleaf CBRN reconnaissance technique is used during mounted and
dismounted operations. The R&S element moves in a cloverleaf pattern, with each leaf extending
50 to 200 meters from the starting point. This technique is not used in radiological contaminated
areas due to the lack of shielding.

Bounce and bypass. The bounce and bypass technique is used to locate the general boundaries of
a contaminated area.

Nearside-far side. The nearside-far side survey technique is normally used by an R&S element
to determine the beginning and end of contamination along a route.

Triangulation. The triangulation CBRN reconnaissance technique is employed by R&S elements
to locate radiological contamination sources while dismounted.

Lane. The lane CBRN reconnaissance technique is used to locate contamination areas during
route, zone, and area reconnaissance missions. The lane technique requires traversing an area,
searching for contamination. It delivers a very detailed coverage of an area in a short period.

Course leg. The course leg technique is used to conduct an aerial reconnaissance survey mission
to define the extent of a radiological hazard. The pilot flies a straight line between two checkpoints

(for example, from Point A [top of a hill] to Point B [top of another hill]). The aircraft only lands 
to obtain the air-ground correlation factor data. 

Box. The box survey technique is used to determine the general dimensions (length and width) of
a contaminated area. It is best employed by three teams, and the process starts once a team enters
the contaminated area.

Grid. The grid CBRN reconnaissance technique is employed by R&S elements where speed and
accuracy are important. It is employed by superimposing a grid over the R&S element maps, which
enables them to rapidly communicate locations of contaminants, the location of where samples
were collected, locations of casualties, and other pertinent information.

Preselected dose rate. The preselected dose rate technique is used to determine the boundaries of
radiological contamination while limiting and controlling exposure to R&S elements. Useful in
surveying the presence of residual radiological contamination and neutron-induced radiation, this
technique also permits the R&S element to avoid excessive radioactive hazard levels. When
conducting a preselected dose rate technique, the element must be given OEG by the commander,
with advice from the CBRN staff or health physicist, which includes a turn-back dose and turn-
back dose rate.
CBRN RECONNAISSANCE EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS 
5-31. Consider the following for CBRN reconnaissance missions:

Time available. A key factor in CBRN R&S execution is the time available to conduct missions.
CBRN R&S elements that are in support of maneuver must keep pace with the movement and
maneuver of the supported unit. The time required to conduct an assessment versus an exploitation
during area reconnaissance must be understood and conveyed by CBRN subject matter experts to
leaders and planners. Because of this consideration, forces may be tasked to only assess CBRN
threats, marking and reporting them for follow-on forces to characterize and exploit.

Key travel and execution times. Estimate the time requirements for moving to the objective,
reconnoitering the objective, establishing security and surveillance, completing assigned tasks
while on the objective, moving to and through friendly lines, and conducting operational
debriefings.

Security force requirements. If conducting dismounted reconnaissance missions in locations
where enemy direct fire is likely and individual protective equipment (IPE) is required due to a
possible CBRN threat, JFCs task organize security forces to support CBRN area reconnaissance.
At a minimum, CBRN reconnaissance assets execute the mission in supporting range of adjacent
maneuver elements.

Essential and supporting tasks. Ensure the assignment of all essential tasks to be performed on
the objective, at danger areas, at security or surveillance locations, along routes, and during the
passage of lines.

Technical decontamination requirements. CBRN R&S elements execute missions based upon
the planning assumption that they will be required to conduct the mission in a contaminated
environment. Technical decontamination coordination is part of mission planning.

Sampling coordination. If sampling is a task requirement to support CBRN reconnaissance,
CBRN R&S force must know where to transport the sample to for safety, control, and increased
identification requirements.

Primary and alternate routes. Determine primary and alternate routes to and from the objective.

Supported unit link-up. Determine the location where and when CBRN R&S will liaison with
supported maneuver units.


Communications. Consider the communications plan (PACE) and ensure that it supports
communication with both the parent unit and gaining unit. If working with multinational partners,
determine which communication means will work while maintaining communications security
protocols. If working in subterranean or concrete structures, look at alternative means to
communicate, such as landline communications, hand-and-arm signals, chemical lights, voice,
whistles, radios, and infrared equipment such as strobes or infrared aiming lasers.

Logistical support. CBRN reconnaissance assets may operate in deep and close areas with other
units, detached from their parent unit for many days. Coordination for all classes of supply and
replenishment are critical.
SECTION II: SURVEILLANCE FORMS AND TASKS 
5-32. This section describes the types of CBRN surveillance (point, area, and health surveillance). It also
describes the unique tasks associated with CBRN surveillance.
POINT SURVEILLANCE 
5-33. The purpose of point surveillance is to provide intermittent or continuous observation of a specific
place, structure, person, or object for a specified amount of time. This can be associated with, but is not
limited to, a target area of interest or a NAI. Point surveillance ensures that time-sensitive critical operations
can be conducted without unwarned encounters with CBRN hazards. It is important to note that detection of
a hazard may occur before or after exposure to personnel. Point surveillance is most limited in the geographic
scope of all forms of surveillance.
5-34. Point surveillance systems may be dismounted, fixed, shipboard mounted, or placed on mobile
platforms. The technology used for point surveillance requires the agent or hazard to be directly in contact
with the detector and equipment decontamination is a planning consideration. Point surveillance may require
the detector to be within the hazard area to obtain readings. The reading may be routed to another output
source remotely for analysis of the initial reading. In either case, a positive reading during point or area
surveillance drives initiation of the CBRNWRS.
5-35. Operational examples of point surveillance systems include—

Dismounted surveillance: an infantryman wearing a sensor while performing squad rushes to an
objective.

Fixed surveillance: a dry filter unit stationed at a control point on a forward operating base.

Shipboard surveillance: an amphibious ship running sensors while launching amphibious assault
vehicles.

Mobile platform surveillance: a sensor mounted on a vehicle conducting operations in the
vicinity of an NAI.
5-36. The sensors in point or area surveillance are usually focused into the wind or toward an area of concern.
Warning of an upwind attack may come from a force’s organic detection capability or from other assets
monitoring the upwind area. When a unit lacks the necessary point or area surveillance capabilities, CBRN
staffs inform commanders when the possibility of attack warrants an increased protective posture based on
intelligence indications.
5-37. Tripod-mounted surveillance systems can be used in and around fixed-site installations to optimize the
sensor field of view and to overcome obstructions from buildings and equipment. Consider using the roofs
of existing buildings or structures to elevate the system. Key definitions that must be understood for fixed-
site elevation include—

Sensor height. Sensor height is the elevation at which the sensor is placed on the ground, building,
or equipment to provide an unimpeded flow of air.

Ground intersect. Ground intersect is the distance from the system that the lower tangent of 10
degrees will intersect the ground. The ground intersect is representative of the distance from the
detector that will not be viewable in the field of regard. Always consider the ground intersect when
elevating the system.

5-38. Shipboard operations provide a capability to alert, collect, and identify chemical, radiological, and
biological agents to support maritime operations. Biological detection technology continuously monitors the
air for a significant rise in particulate concentrations and/or biological mass. If a significant rise over the
background is detected, the instruments will automatically collect an aerosol sample and alert the ship
damage control central of the need to collect the sample and screen it using a handheld assay for a possible
presumptive identification.
5-39. The maritime biological detection technology detects and identifies biological agents. It contains or
connects to navigation, meteorological, and communications equipment that is used to identify the location
and sense the conditions under which the agent was detected. The maritime biological detection technology
has the ability to detect and identify many agents (bacteria, viruses, toxins) during a mission. Biological agent
identification is limited by the available agent reactive assay strips housed within the identifier, the ability to
collect enough material to reach the identification thresholds of the assay strips, and reagent interferents. It
provides the ability to collect and save biological agent samples for later laboratory analysis.
5-40. The symbol for CBRN point surveillance uses the circular equipment sensor symbol descriptor
provided in FM 1-02.2 with the type of sensor denoted to the right of the symbol and relevant staff
information. The duration of the sensors use can be added to the left of the symbol showing a start and stop
date time group. A status of the sensor may be provided on the bottom based upon unit SOP. For example,
GREEN may mean fully operational, YELLOW may mean at location (but not currently monitoring) and
RED may indicate detection of a CBRN hazard. A directional arrow is used to denote the exact location on
the map where the sensor is located. An example of an individual point of surveillance has been provided in
figure 5-5.

AREA SURVEILLANCE 
5-41. The purpose of CBRN area surveillance is to provide a greater detection capability in large areas
leveraging sensors, optics, and detectors. The first warning of missile attack will come from space-based
sensors, and will estimate a probable impact location. Area surveillance also provides warning of CBRN
attacks and informs units when to increase protective posture. For sustainment nodes, area surveillance
informs the direction of CBRN plumes, allowing units to avoid contamination before logistics assets are cross
contaminated. CBRN area surveillance may also be redundant, temporary, or continuous observation of a
specific prescribed geographic area. It can be associated with, but is not limited to, a CBRN target area of
interest or a CBRN NAI. This area may include a town, neighborhood, cluster or group of buildings, or other
man-made or geographic features. Unlike area reconnaissance, it does not include individual structures, such
as a bridge or single building. The use of sensors (deployed in arrays) and standoff detection capabilities are
key to the coverage of larger areas.
Chapter 5 
5-14
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
5-42. Area surveillance provides warning to friendly units, allowing them to avoid contaminated areas before 
they pose a hazard to resources. It may be conducted while positioned around the perimeter of a fixed site,
such as an airbase. During the fixed site employment of sensors in support of area surveillance, the CBRN
R&S asset considers the installation size as only one factor in determining the required number of detectors.
The airflow is another factor that could affect the number of detectors required. Tall or large structures
(dormitories, hangars, fuel tanks) can obstruct airflow. Terrain features (mountains, hills, valleys) may also
obstruct or affect how the prevailing winds flow throughout the fixed site. Simulation and modeling
capabilities aid in and maximize the positioning of detectors throughout the perimeter.
5-43. The CBRN threat also plays a major role in detector placement. For instance, if there is a threat of a
line release upwind, then the sensors may be placed in the upwind side of an installation in a picket line. If
the threat is from artillery, then the detectors could be placed in a box technique to ensure uniform coverage
across the entire installation. These factors must be considered when emplacing the detector so that blind
areas are minimized and the overlapping of detectors is maximized to ensure adequate coverage of the fixed
site through point or area surveillance.
5-44. Vehicle-mounted employment can also be used in and around fixed sites and temporary perimeters.
The advantages of vehicle-mounted systems are that they can be easily repositioned as needed to adjust to
changing environmental conditions and threat. A single system provides a circular ring of coverage around
an employed location. In this situation, the system should be located as close as possible to the center of the
location with an unobstructed field of regard. If there is a high probability that an attack will occur because
of an upwind release of a CBRN agent, the system could be placed on the upwind edge of the target to provide
warning to other forces. Layered, redundant systems may be positioned around the location, providing
coverage in depth within the perimeter.
5-45. In figure 5-6, a biological detection company has been tasked to provide area surveillance within a
division support area. Using a picket line, systems have been emplaced along the northeastern portion of the
division support area, understanding that the wind direction and air flow from higher ground will impact
sensor efficiency. Note that not all of the biological sensors are running at once, allowing for phased
maintenance and sensor coverage. The company has also emplaced chemical detector sensors that are
collocated with biological detection, fostering dual threat hazard awareness and understanding. A CBRN
unmanned aerial system has also been employed providing layered coverage across the southwestern portion
of the division support area, where most logistical activities are occurring.

HEALTH SURVEILLANCE 
5-46. According to DODD 6490.02E, comprehensive, continuous, and consistent health surveillance shall
be conducted by the Military Services to implement early intervention and control strategies using
technologies, practices, and procedures in a consistent manner. Health surveillance includes medical
surveillance and occupational and environmental health surveillance. Medical surveillance is the ongoing,
systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data derived from instances of medical care or medical
evaluation, and the reporting of population-based information for characterizing and countering threats to a
population’s health, well-being, and performance (JP 4-02). Occupational and environmental health
surveillance is the regular or repeated collection, analysis, archiving, interpretation, and dissemination of
occupational and environmental health-related data for monitoring the health of, or potential health hazard
impact on, a population and individual personnel, and for intervening in a timely manner to prevent, treat, or
control the occurrence of disease or injury when determined necessary. (DODD 6490.02E) CBRN R&S
elements must integrate with the medical community, sharing information on CBRN and TIM hazards
identified in the environment or that CBRN R&S teams may have been or were exposed to so that their
exposure can be documented in the Service members’ medical records. Sharing information on CBRN
hazards facilitates early medical intervention of and potentially prevents the negative acute, latent, and
chronic term physical effects of any HAZMAT exposures.
5-47.  CBRN surveillance includes the integration of health surveillance. Health surveillance is the regular
or repeated collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data and the dissemination of information
to monitor the health of a population and to identify potential health risks, thereby enabling timely
interventions to prevent, treat, reduce, or control disease and injury, which includes occupational and
environmental health surveillance and medical surveillance subcomponents. (JP 4-02) Medical surveillance
is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data derived from instances of medical
care or medical evaluation, and the reporting of population-based information for characterizing and
countering threats to a population’s health, well-being, and performance. (JP 4-02)
5-48. The systematic collection of health care information is essential to the surveillance process. Health
surveillance includes medical, occupational, and environmental surveillance. This information is used to
monitor the health of a population and to identify potential risks to health, disease, and injury, thereby
enabling timely interventions to prevent, treat, or control exposure. The foundation of a health surveillance
program is the determination of unit-specific illness and injury rates of public health significance.
5-49. Medical surveillance, derived from instances of medical care or medical evaluation, may provide the
first indicator that a CBRN incident has occurred. If an incident is not detected directly, the first indication
may be an increase of illness among the affected population. Some hazards induce symptoms after an
incubation period (biological) or prolonged exposure (radiation and chemical). An influx of patients reporting
similar symptoms may indicate that an incident has occurred. CBRN and medical staffs must synchronize
efforts and establish a seamless, shared understanding of when CBRN threats and hazards are impacting force
health.

5-50. The first evidence of a biological attack may be recognized by the medical community due to the
number of patients with similar signs and symptoms seeking treatment. CBRN R&S capabilities may detect
a biological incident during R&S activities before Service members show signs and symptoms due to time
delay between biological hazard exposure and signs and symptoms developing. The sharing of information
between CBRN staffs and the medical community is critical to identify CBRN hazards that may not have
been identified through traditional (sensor) means and to inform the medical community so that medical
treatment plans can be adjusted for the CBRN hazard.

CBRN SURVEILLANCE TASKS 
5-51. The CBRN surveillance tasks are—

Monitor CBRN hazards. Monitoring CBRN hazards is described as checking the environment
for the presence of CBRN hazards. When monitoring for CBRN hazards, periodic or continuous
techniques are used. Further details on these techniques are provided later in this chapter.

Observe CBRN hazards. Observing CBRN hazards is described as watching a specific location
or unit to determine the potential for the presence of a CBRN hazard using visual means.
CBRN SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES 
5-52. The CBRN surveillance techniques are—

Periodic. The periodic CBRN monitoring technique during CBRN surveillance missions consists
of frequent checks of the environment for the arrival or presence of CBRN hazards.

Continuous. The continuous monitoring technique during CBRN surveillance missions involves
uninterrupted checking for CBRN hazards at a given location over a specified period of time.
Note. Both periodic and continuous can be conducted on the move. Maneuver forces observe and 
monitor their proximal location to detect CBRN hazards to support immediate protective action 
while in the assault and other maneuver missions. 

Critical node. The critical-node technique uses a set of detectors and/or monitors positioned
around and throughout a specific high-value target to provide for the detection and early warning
of a CBRN attack. Examples include aerial port of debarkation, SPOD, and mission command/C2
locations.

Area array. The area array technique uses a set of CBRN detectors and/or monitors positioned
within a given geographic space to provide for detection and early warning of a CBRN incident.
They are positioned to complement and overlap each other in such a way as to increase the
probability of detection of a CBRN hazard.
EMPLOYMENT TACTICS 
5-53. The CBRN surveillance employment tactics are different between mounted and dismounted
capabilities. Refer to mounted and dismounted appendixes for employment tactics (see appendixes B and C).
CBRN SURVEILLANCE CONSIDERATIONS 
5-54. Consider the following for CBRN surveillance missions:

Determine the number of detection and/or collection assets that are available and required. Land-
force CBRN surveillance assets are employed in arrays designed to optimize the probability of
detection consistent with large areas and critical sustainment nodes. Assets will be located based
on METT-TC/METT-T factors, ability of the sensors, and the size of the critical asset to be
protected.

Place fixed-site CBRN surveillance assets on high ground or upwind of a location to provide
CBRN detection and confirm or deny the presence of CBRN agents. Fixed-site CBRN operations
focus on specified targets to include ports, aerial port of debarkation, or SPODs. CBRN detection
assets are placed anywhere upwind or within the location to confirm or deny the presence of a
CBRN agent. METT-TC/METT-T analysis will determine the number of systems required as
point detectors for critical nodes such as logistics bases or major airfields and/or air bases, naval
bases, or ports. CBRN detection systems can also be placed on ships for improved operational
dispersion. Detectors and collection devices can be placed inside critical facilities to monitor for
CBRN agents.

Determine the size of the operational area to be covered and maximize the distance of the sensor
to the alarm, allowing personnel to have maximum early warning of CBRN attack to don IPE/PPE.


Examine the environment’s effects on the sensor. CBRN R&S leaders account for proximity of
objects that may impede air flow, such as buildings, and the proximity of activities that may distort 
air flow, such as helicopter and aircraft operations.

Ensure that the sensor employment strategy accounts for the most likely means of enemy delivery
to include delivery systems and delivery tactics.

For naval operations, use CBRN sensors to monitor the AO while ships are underway, in port, and
operating close to land masses.
SECTION III: BASIC RECONNAISSANCE SKILLS AND PRACTICES 
5-55. CBRN R&S elements must be highly proficient in tactical fundamentals and able to seamlessly
integrate with maneuver reconnaissance formations in order to successfully answer CBRN related PIR.
Personnel or formations that are highly technically qualified on CBRN specific tasks, but a tactical liability
or unable to accomplish the arduous tasks associated with the reconnaissance enterprise have little use in the
challenging and dangerous environment in which reconnaissance is executed. These skills must be mastered
by all CBRN R&S personnel and be rapidly executed in enemy contact.
MOVEMENT FUNDAMENTALS 
5-56. Movement and maneuver techniques are selected based on the type of reconnaissance element
conducting the operation, enemy expectations, the specific mission objectives for the reconnaissance
operation, and METT-TC/METT-T. Mastery of movement and maneuver is critical to successfully getting
to the reconnaissance objective, conducting reconnaissance of the assigned NAI, and safely returning to
friendly lines.
INSERTION AND EXTRACTION METHODS 
5-57. CBRN R&S elements can conduct waterborne insertion by inland and coastal waterways to provide
speed, stealth, and flexibility in order to arrive at the reconnaissance objective. Key factors of waterborne
reconnaissance include the beach landing site, environmental factors (such as waves, tide, fog) available drop 
site from debarking larger craft. Additional flexibility may be gained by conducting helocasting of assault
craft.
5-58. Helicopters provide a variety of methods for inserting and extracting CBRN R&S elements. These
methods include special purpose insertion and extraction system, fast rope insertion and extraction system,
and air assault. Helicopter operations provide range and speed, but sacrifice stealth, impose weight/space
limitation compared to vehicle operations, and are vulnerable against robust air defense systems.
5-59. Airborne operations are the fastest method of infiltration, but require detailed planning and significant
coordination of resources. Units must plan for suppression of enemy air defenses, coordination of air
platform, and contingency plans for in-flight emergencies. Airborne operations are highly vulnerable upon
hitting the drop zone, and a suspected airborne infiltration often draws an aggressive response from enemy
forces.
5-60. Vehicle operations allow the use of a wider range of CBRN R&S systems, which would not be feasible
for dismounted operations. Vehicle operations allow for CBRN R&S to conduct reconnaissance ahead of
rapidly moving armor or mounted formations, and cover large areas of terrain. Planning and preparation for
a mounted mission starts long before a mission is assigned. Preparations include training and rehearsals such
as mounted battle drills, laager/hide sites and vehicle maintenance. The distance from a base to the
operational area, or even the staging (launch) site may require additional transportation. Various infiltration
combinations of aircraft, rail line, or surface ships may be required to get the CBRN R&S element positioned
to insert into an operational area. These infiltration combinations may also be used to increase the operational
range of the mounted CBRN R&S element by decreasing the required distance for overland insertion.

TACTICAL MOVEMENT 
5-61. Sound tactical movement is the essence of all CBRN R&S missions. The CBRN R&S element
maneuvers in a way to accomplish the mission but minimize casualties and retains freedom of maneuver.
Effectively employed, the guidelines in this section can help see the enemy first and observe them undetected.
This helps to achieve a number of tactical goals, including retaining the initiative, confirming or denying the
CCIR, and retaining freedom of movement to gain information. Tactical movement involves movement of a
unit assigned a mission under combat conditions when not in direct ground contact with the enemy.
5-62. Leaders look at the terrain, foliage, structures, and other features along avenues of approach (and on
objectives or key terrain) to identify sites offering cover (protection from the effects of direct and indirect
fire) and concealment (protection from observation). Cover and concealment is just as vital as clear fields of
fire. Terrain offers concealment from enemy observation and cover from enemy fires. Make maximum use
of natural protection to accomplish their mission and avoid enemy detection. Use cover when possible. When
no cover is available, use the concealment offered by trees, shadows, brush, and man-made structures.
5-63. Reduce the major signatures (audible, thermal, and visual) by shutting off vehicle engines and related
systems such as heaters or older thermal sights when the vehicle is not moving or when not using the system
(normally referred to as a short count). Further reduce visual and thermal signatures by erecting camouflage
networks, and use foliage found in the AO to alter the natural box shape of the vehicle which helps hide a
stationary vehicle visually and thermally. Networks tied to the vehicle reduce dust and exhaust signatures,
and reduce the thermal signature while moving.
5-64. During the execution of reconnaissance, specific types of terrain features or regions will be
encountered that increase risk to enemy fire. Identify and highlight enemy cover, concealment, and
observation danger areas when conducting map reconnaissance, and analysis during TLPs. There is no perfect 
way to counter every danger area so leaders at all levels need to use disciplined initiative when reacting to
danger areas.
5-65. As the CBRN R&S element executes reconnaissance and security missions, routes, or mobility
corridors that provide access into the terrain between friendly elements to its flanks and rear are to be
expected. These lateral mobility corridors pose a security threat by allowing the enemy to move into the
terrain around the flanks unobserved. Leaders coordinate missions with adjacent units to prevent confusion,
fratricide, or possible enemy exploitation. Lateral routes beyond one-half the distance of the maximum
effective range of overwatching weapon systems should be avoided. It is critical that continuous surveillance
of these mobility corridors to protect against infiltrating enemy forces be maintained.
CAMOUFLAGE 
5-66. CBRN R&S elements need to stay undetected to complete the mission. In any terrain or environment,
a key to remaining undetected is to use proper camouflage measures. The CBRN R&S elements ability to
conceal itself is only limited by its imagination. The biggest threat during reconnaissance is detection.
5-67. Detection can be by direct observation (where the observer sees the subject with his eyes, either aided
or unaided) or by indirect observation (where the observer sees an image of the subject and not the subject
itself.) Indirect observation uses photography, radar, infrared, thermal imaging, and televideo.
5-68. Regardless of the method of observation, certain factors help the eye and brain identify an object. The
six factors of recognition are—

Position. This factor relates to the position of the object in relation to its surroundings. In addition,
position is space relative to one object and another.

Shape. Experience teaches people to associate an object with its shape or outline. At a distance,
the outline of objects can be recognized long before the details of its makeup can be determined.
Trucks, guns, tanks, and other common military items all have distinctive outlines that help to
identify them.


Shadow. Shadow may be even more revealing than the object itself. This fact is true when viewed
from the air. Sometimes it may be more important to break up or disrupt the shadow than the
object itself.

Texture. Texture refers to the ability of an object to reflect, absorb, and diffuse light. It may be
defined as the relative smoothness or roughness of a surface. A rough surface reflects little light
and will usually appear dark to the eye or in a photo. A smooth surface such as an airstrip, although 
it might be painted the same color as its surroundings, would show up as a lighter tone on a photo.
One of the most revealing breaches of camouflage discipline is shine. Shine attracts attention by
reflecting light such as sunlight or moonlight.

Contrast. Color is an aid to an observer when there is a contrast between the object and its
background. The greater the contrast in color, the more visible the object is. Usually darker shades
of a given color will be less likely to attract an observer’s attention than the lighter shades.

Movement. The last factor of recognition is movement. Although this factor seldom reveals the
identity of an object, it is the most important one of revealing location. Movement is detected
easily and usually through the observer’s peripheral vision.
5-69. CBRN R&S elements avoid detection by concealment by some form of physical screen. Examples
include—

Hiding. Using thick vegetation or terrain features that screen vehicles from ground observation.
In some cases, the screen itself can be invisible to detection and, at times, it is the overt screen that
protects the activity or equipment from observation.

Blending. Arranging or applying camouflage materials on, over, or around an object so that it
appears to be part of the background. Blending distinctly man-made objects into a natural terrain
pattern is necessary to maintain a normal and natural appearance.

Disguising. Simulating an object or activity so that it looks like something else. Clever disguises
will mislead the enemy as to identity, strength, and intention.
OBSERVATION 
5-70. The timely and accurate collection and transmission of reports, imagery, video, sensor reporting, or
hand drawn pictures of the objective, plays a key role in the success of follow-on missions. The purpose of
reconnaissance is to provide an accurate description of enemy strengths, positions and capabilities so that the
commander can make informed decisions.
5-71. Imagery principles to ensure maximum value of R&S are—

Placement of letters or numbers on the image to correspond with the legend.

Placing appropriate arrows and other graphics where needed.

Ensuring the image has a title, including a name, DTG, and grid, for example,

North-seeking arrow.

Size of the picture (from east to west, north to south).

Remarks page for details about what each number or letter means.
5-72. In the case of loss of communication or enemy compromise, an objective sketch may be the only piece
of information about that objective available. The ability to draft a proper objective sketch is an extremely
important skill. It is important to understand the basics of objective sketch production. Understanding the
basics allows a novice or nonartist to draw an understandable objective sketch. Objective sketches may be
panoramic or topographic.

TERRAIN ANALYSIS 
5-73. Terrain analysis is the study and interpretation of natural and manmade features of an area, their effects
on military operations, and the effects of weather and climate on these features. Terrain analysis is a
continuous process. Changes in the OE may change the analysis of its effects on the operation or on threat
COA.
5-74. Ideally, analysis of the military aspects of terrain is based on reconnaissance of the AO and area of
interest. This starts with a map and imagery reconnaissance. Automated digital terrain tools can assist in the
analysis of environmental factors and can display data over maps. These tools are generally held in the
intelligence fusion cell. CBRN specific modeling may be used to assess potential hazard areas to complement
terrain analysis. Terrain may be analyzed through the aspects of OAKOC described in chapter 4. CBRN staff
must also consider terrain effects on CBRN usage, for example, porous soil and vegetation will absorb
contamination at a higher rate than rocky or barren terrain, minimizing initial effects of a CBRN strike.
However, changing weather conditions or vehicle or foot movement can later cause contamination in the soil
to be released. The products of terrain analysis include—

Cross-country mobility.

Lines of communication.

Vegetation types and distributions.

Surface drainages and configurations.

Surface materials.

Subsurface (bedrock) materials.

Obstacles.

Infrastructures.

Flood zones.

Potential helicopter landing zones.

Potential amphibious landing zones.
SECTION IV: RECONNAISSANCE HANDOVER AND PASSAGE OF LINES 
5-75. RHO is the process of planning, preparing, and executing transfer of responsibility and information
from one element to another to facilitate continued observation or surveillance of enemy contact or an
assigned area. It may cover an area or zone, such as an AO NAI, TAI, AA, or any enemy elements. It involves
transferring physical, visual, electronic, or digital observation in any number of combinations. Assets such
as ground sensors and UAS may transfer. Scout platoons execute a handover with a designated RHO
coordination point, phase line where reconnaissance responsibility transitions from one element to another
known as the RHO line, or trigger such as visual contact with threat forces outside of the reconnaissance
element’s engagement criteria.
5-76. A successful RHO ensures that there are no violations of any of the fundamentals of reconnaissance.
This transfer of responsibility and information prevents gaps or seams from emerging that the enemy can
exploit. If conducting target handover, the receiving unit acquires the target before handover is complete.
5-77. Once the handover is complete during reconnaissance, the element transferring control either conducts
a rearward passage of lines as the passing unit through the main body receiving responsibility, acts as the
stationary unit in a forward passage of lines for the element receiving responsibility, or continues further into
zone to continue their reconnaissance mission.
5-78. Reconnaissance and security tasks require the element conducting the handover to effectively
coordinate with higher, lower, and adjacent units. Planning for these tasks requires the RHO coordination to
start at the higher echelons and execute at the lowest element.

Chapter 6 
Sample Collection, Management, and Processing 
This chapter describes the purpose and tasks of CBRN sample collection and 
management. Samples may be collected in CBRN environments, during site 
characterization, or exploitation following the forensic science functions. The decision 
to collect a sample must be determined by the specific purpose—answering the CCIR, 
field confirmatory identification, attribution or mitigation, and the time required to 
apply the processes with the skill that will ensure the integrity of the sample. The 
decision to sample should be based on the deliberate planning that creates the sample 
management plan and guided by the forensic functions.  
PURPOSE 
6-1. The decision to collect samples should be made with a specific intent associated with answering CCIR.
Many factors will influence the requirement to take samples and determine what level of identification is
needed. Information about the levels of identification and the decisions impacted can be found in chapter 2.
6-2. Sampling allows the commander to make timely, informed decisions concerning the positioning,
operating posture, radiation exposure management, tempo, and maneuver ability of his units and to select
adapted protective measures (mission-oriented protective posture level, collective protection activation,
restriction of movement). Sampling is conducted for tactical and/or operational purposes and it is also
necessary to allow the medical services to provide the most appropriate health care, and guide the commander
in selecting the most appropriate protective actions to implement for force health protection.
6-3. For strategic, military, and/or political purposes, there may also be a need to confirm, the definitive
use of CBRN substance by an adversary or his intention to do so. Although such evidence is required quickly,
the proof of use of these agents must be such that it cannot be refuted. This degree of certainty cannot be
achieved by information obtained solely from the battlefield such as radiation detection, indication, and
computation (RADIAC) detector responses or unusual numbers of casualties. In such cases, additional
forensic sampling at the scene of incident may be required.
6-4. The tasks of site assessment, characterization, and exploitation take place within a greater tactical
mission. These tasks use forensic functions and are tiered based on time and resources.

Site assessment. A site assessment detects WMD and related materials, delivery systems,
associated material, and technologies. A site assessment requires less time and resources. Site
assessment may occur concurrent with tactical enabling tasks such as search and attack.

Site characterization. Site characterization is a complete description and inventory of all
personnel, equipment, material, and information discovered. It assists in determining the need for
exploitation.

Site exploitation. Site exploitation is a time-, resource-, and capability-intensive task. It is a series
of activities to recognize, collect, process, preserve, and analyze information, personnel, and/or
material found during the conduct of operations. It will require additional enablers that are not
organic to the unit to exploit data, information, and materials obtained during the operation. This
is most likely to be executed during operations to consolidate gains. Site exploitation supports the
CWMD activities of defeat, disable, and dispose.
Note. See STANAG 4701 (AEP-66) for more information on sampling of biological, chemical, 
and radiological for NATO missions.

6-5. CBRN sample management is explained in paragraph 6-17. The need to evacuate samples to fulfill the
commander’s information, CCIRs, and PIRs drives the sample management process. Proper identification of
CBRN hazards affect decisions such as the administration of effective medical countermeasures, troop
movements, individual and collective protective postures, and selection of decontamination methods.
EXPEDITIONARY FORENSICS 
6-6. In support of answering the commander’s CCIR, CBRN R&S elements may be required to sample
materials for site characterization or site exploitation. CBRN sampling and collection for forensics are
essentially the same─following procedures to ensure the quality and integrity of what is collected and to
establish facts. Forensic science should be applied at any level of sampling. In-theater agent identification
may be done at the presumptive, field confirmatory and theater validation levels depending on the time
available and the confidence required in the result. This chapter provides information for sample management
conducted by CBRN R&S elements at the tactical level.
6-7. Forensic science is the application of multidisciplinary scientific processes to establish facts (see
DODD 5205.15E). Applying forensic standards when detecting, collecting, processing, and analyzing
materiel improves and standardizes processes and increases confidence in the answers discovered. While
forensic science was originally oriented towards laboratory sciences, joint forces use the application of
expeditionary forensics for many purposes, including site exploitation, support to intelligence, law
enforcement, medical activities, protection, and survivability.
6-8. The decision to collect materials during site assessment or characterization should be made with
consideration to time available and security of the site. Collected materials should be exploited at the lowest
level possible to provide relevant information to the commander.
FORENSIC FUNCTIONS
6-9. Six forensic functions provide a framework for the tasks conducted during CBRN sampling. They are─

Recognize.

Preserve.

Collect.

Analyze.

Store.

Share.
6-10. These functions can be conducted in sequence, in parallel, or in any combination based on mission
variables. CBRN sample management establishes procedures, guidelines, and constraints to protect and
preserve the integrity of the samples that may have tactical, operational, or strategic implications.
Recognize 
6-11. The recognize function of forensics is an important component of CBRN sampling. It involves locating
and scrutinizing materials and determining if the materials have potential information value. CBRN R&S
elements can capitalize on the information from earlier site assessments or characterization to plan what items
of information value require sampling. Sketches and photographs from earlier entries assist in conducting
systematic searches at the point of collection, to recognize the best location for a sample that will provide the
most information value.
6-12. Information and materials potentially linked to the enemy are considered materials of interest and
collected on-site. Forensic analysis establishes specific facts that can potentially be used to answer
commander’s information requirements, inform decision making, and promote greater situational
understanding. Special procedures must be followed when materials identified for collection are CBRN
materials or precursors.
6-13. During CBRN R&S, items of potential value are recognized as targets and directed for sampling.
Recognizing what is of value for CBRN sampling must take into account sample collection priorities that
may be established in the sample management plan. Samples fall under three priority categories—
Sample Collection, Management, and Processing 
31 March 2021 
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
6-3

Priority 1. Bulk unitary agent, bulk binary and/or other precursor materials (such as drums,
barrels, final laboratory products), to include munitions or other delivery devices/systems.

Priority 2. Environmental samples (such as air, water, soil, food, vegetation, and insects) and
medical specimens (for example, vomit) from areas of alleged CBRN use.

Priority 3. CBRN defensive materials (such as IPE/personal protective equipment (PPE), antidote
kits, decontamination equipment, detection equipment), CBRN research and development
facilities/equipment, or CBRN test and evaluation facilities/equipment.
Preserve and Collect 
6-14. The preserve and collect functions take into account the protection of materials and data beginning
once those items are recognized as holding potential value through the process of acquiring the samples.
Maintaining the integrity of any samples taken ensures purity for analysis or to be of value for attribution.
Specific procedures must be followed to preserve any samples. Every effort should be made to process,
collect, and package samples following guidance to ensure the integrity and quality of the sample (see
appendix G for specific techniques for sample collection).
Analyze, Store, and Share 
6-15. Analyze, store, and share can occur at various echelons for more detailed exploitation. The commander 
and staff must ensure that the CBRN R&S element is trained and equipped to perform the key tasks of
conducting the sample collection and management. In some circumstances, commanders may require
technical-level expertise (CBRN specialists, preventive medicine [PVNTMED]/public health personnel) in
contrast to tactical forces that are CBRN-capable. PVNTMED/public health and CBRN R&S elements are
responsible for environmental sample collection, but PVNTMED/public health is responsible for
occupational and environment health sample collection and exposure surveillance.
6-16. The sample management database is a permissions-based, interoperable, web-based system used to
consolidate all sampling and analysis results from site exploitation or other activities requiring laboratory
analysis. It provides a means to catalog, store, and share all documentation and reporting associated with
samples or collected enemy material, including photographs, videos, storyboards, laboratory reports,
intelligence, and chain of custody. DD Form 3108 (CBRN Sample Documentation and Chain of Custody)
provides information on the CBRN sample and the chain of custody (see figure F-6, page F-52). Laboratories
input all sample collection, and custody tracking documents (to include sample splitting information) into
the sample management database. Results of laboratory analysis results are recorded in the database and
reported back to the JFC. The first entry point for the database may be at the theater level laboratory or a
sample management facility if established. In the absence of a sample management database, each laboratory
at every level must maintain a system or method to track, catalog, and store their respective data.
SAMPLING TASKS 
6-17. The sampling tasks support sample management. Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
(CBRN) sample management is the process whereby CBRN samples are collected, packaged, transported,
stored, transferred, analyzed, reported, safeguarded, tracked, and disposed. It begins with the decision to
collect CBRN samples and continues to the reporting of information produced by the final analysis of that
sample. This process includes safeguarding and prioritizing CBRN samples, tracking their movements and
analytical status, and reporting the end result of sample analysis. The CBRN sample management process
establishes procedures, guidelines, and constraints at staff and unit levels to protect and preserve the integrity
of CBRN samples that may have tactical, operational, and/or strategic implications. (See figure 6-1, page
6-4.) CBRN R&S sample management priorities may be established by the commander to coincide with PIR.
Sample management feeds into joint ISR planning. At each level of command, sample management
operations must be precisely defined within the area or responsibility (AOR). Sample transport across an
AOR must be deliberately planned, controlled, tracked, and executed at all levels.

6-18. The key CBRN sampling tasks form a process whereby samples are collected, packaged, transported,
stored, transferred, analyzed, tracked, and disposed of. CBRN sampling tasks are nested within the forensic
functions.
Collect 
6-19. The decision to collect CBRN or precursor samples must be made with forethought of purpose. Some
examples of questions that must be considered are—

What materials may be available as grab samples such as prepackaged vials or petri dishes?

How much material is available?

Will the sample be for field identification or transferred to a laboratory?

Where in the chemical or biological process is the best representative sample to be taken?

What specific requirements are there for quantity or type based on supporting laboratory
requirements or requirements of field identification equipment used?

Are control, background, or split samples required?
6-20. Preparation of a sample collection order requires detailed coordination and careful execution. Unit
missions, capabilities, and authorized equipment cause differences in how samples are collected and
processed. The quality of any analytical evaluation is directly related to the quality of the sample or specimen
and the degree of sample degradation that occurs before testing.
Package 
6-21. Once the sample has been collected, proper packaging is based on what the collected material is
(C-B-R or N, precursor or trace) and its state of matter (liquid, solid, or gas). Decontamination of each layer
of packaging is instrumental to ensure the safety of those handling the package at each additional stage, and
prevent cross contamination. Samples submitted for analysis must be properly packaged, labeled, and shipped 
so that they arrive in an analytically acceptable condition and according to any specific laboratory
requirements. The sample label should be affixed to the sample container and each layer of packaging.
Packaging procedures can be found in appendix G.

Transport 
6-22. There are specific requirements to effectively transport a sample to the appropriate agency or transfer
point. Collected samples may be transported to a sample transfer point, which may also be the
decontamination point. Samples are generally escorted during the entire evacuation process to ensure safety
and to maintain the chain of custody. CBRN sample escort by chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and
explosives response team (CRT) personnel is preferred during the transport process, but may not always be
practical due to the limited number of personnel. Other properly trained personnel can escort CBRN samples
if equipped properly.
6-23. The transport task follows specific guidance established in the 42 CFR and 49 CFR parts 171-177,
AFMAN 24-604/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/DLAI 4145.3, the International Air Transportation
Association (IATA) regulations, and domestic and international transportation laws governing the
transportation of HAZMAT.
6-24. Sample evacuation within the joint operations area (JOA) shall be coordinated by the maneuver task
force through the CCMD office for technical analysis and conducted using ground transportation or rotary- 
or fixed-wing aviation assets depending on sample priority and distance to sample collection points and/or
the laboratory. Sample evacuation outside the JOA for definitive analysis should be coordinated through the
joint task force (JTF) and conducted using United States Transportation Command strategic airlift assets,
according to international HAZMAT transportation regulations. Upon arrival at a continental United States
(CONUS) APOD, the sample escort team transloads the cargo onto CARA ground or rotary- or fixed-wing
assets for movement to the final disposition laboratory designated by the CCMD or intelligence community.
Store 
6-25. Those samples specifically designated for transport/delivery to theater or CONUS laboratories must
be stored properly until they can be delivered to the laboratory. Biological samples or specimens must be
kept cold (4-10° Celsius [C]), but never frozen.
Transfer 
6-26. When samples are transferred from one unit or agency to another, a custody transfer occurs. The chain
of custody (DD Form 3108) is critical because it provides an auditable trail of when and where the sample
was taken. A custody transfer also occurs when supervision of the sample changes. Sample transfers or
custody changes are documented. Each time the sample is transferred to another unit or agency, the receiving
unit or agency must sign the document to show that they have received the sample. The least number of
transfers maintains the integrity of the sample and minimizes the chance of the sample being compromised.
Generally, at the minimum the—

Transfer of samples occurs between the CBRN R&S element and the sample courier, between
sample couriers at different levels, and between the sample courier and the receiving laboratory
for first or subsequent analysis.

Transfer of samples occurs between the escort team and the supporting laboratory or the
destination designated by the commander (for example, sample transfer point in an adjoining
AOR).
Analyze 
6-27. Analyzing samples produces the information a commander requires to make decisions. Analyzing a
sample to identify its characteristics begins on initial collection and can continue after it arrives at CONUS
laboratories.
Report 
6-28. Information is reported at every stage of assessment, characterization, and exploitation. Reporting
should occur at the first recognition that material of value may need to be collected, when samples leave the
collection site, when custody changes from the sample collection team to the escort team, when handed off
at sample transfer point or turned over to a laboratory, and when results of analysis are available. Reporting

31 March 2021 
results of collection on-site or the results of analysis of suspect CBRN samples can fulfill the CCIR. 
Reporting should occur as new information is discovered about a suspected CBRN hazard and its associated 
samples. Reports must include the totality of information about events leading up to the need for collection, 
description or photographs of the site, environmental conditions, weather conditions, and any other of a 
number of details that may be relevant to analysis of the samples. 
6-29. Initial reports will not contain the depth of information that a commander needs to make long-term
decisions. Initial reports can provide sufficient information to make immediate decisions needed to save lives
and prevent further injuries. See examples of report forms in chapter 7.
Safeguard 
6-30. Samples must be safeguarded during collection, transport, and storage. CBRN samples are hazardous.
If released inadvertently, they could cause injury or death to those that are exposed to them. A sample must
be safeguarded so that it is maintained to the standards that will ensure its viability until it can be analyzed
at its destination laboratory.
6-31. Applying the aseptic techniques from biology is useful for the purposes of safeguarding CBRN
samples. Aseptic techniques are practices and procedures to prevent transfer of contamination while
collecting or analyzing samples. It involves applying the strictest rules to minimize risks to collection and
handling teams.
Track 
6-32. Sample tracking, reporting, and documentation begins at the point of collection and continues until
final disposition of the sample. Samples must be properly labeled and marked to meet standards and should
be accompanied by a strict chain of custody (DD Form 3108) maintained for every sample collected. The
chain-of-custody document must accompany the sample during transport from the point of collection,
through stopover locations, the receiving laboratory, and to final disposition of the sample. The chain of
custody is critical because it provides an audit trail of when and where the sample was taken and by whom
the sample was taken. Other supporting information such as the type of facility, terrain and weather, casualty
symptom, and description of the sample should be kept with the sample. This may include notes and
photographs from the collection. The sample collection team assigns an identification number and affixes it
to the sample or its container to aid in identification and records the number on the chain-of custody form.
6-33. Continually throughout the sample management process, the sample must be tracked to ensure positive
chain of custody, accountability, integrity of the sample, adherence to time schedules, and visibility of
analytical status updates. The task of tracking is critical to supporting objectives established in the sample
management plan.
Dispose 
6-34. CBRN samples must be disposed of properly so that exposure does not occur to unprotected personnel.
Once a sample is no longer required, it must be neutralized by the proper decontaminants or taken to an
effective storage facility designed to safeguard the sample from inadvertent release. Disposal is documented
and witnessed is accordance with local or Service policies.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
6-35. The JFC responsible for the CBRN sample collection and identification, performs deliberate planning
to develop the sample management plan and assign responsibilities when operations involve a known or
likely requirement for sample collections.
SERVICE COMPONENT OR COMBATANT COMMAND 
6-36. The Service component command or CCMD should specify, through an annex to the orders, a sample
management plan that details samples for movement and transfer of samples. The geographic combatant
commander identifies a theater sample manager to manage the movement of samples within theater and to
definitive laboratories outside the theater based on feedback from the command surgeon, CBRN staff, and
supporting laboratories. The sample management plan defines—

CCIR and reporting requirements.

Required analytical information requirements and coordination with the appropriate theater
laboratory to identify any laboratory-specific requirements.

Sample evacuation and movement guidance. Identify supporting sample transfer points or
locations to deliver the sample.

If a sample requires analysis at a definitive laboratory, the lead CBRN organization in the JOA
coordinates with CCMD, intelligence community, United States Transportation Command, and
JTF for intertheater movement. It coordinates the final disposition location (CONUS laboratory)
with CCMD or the intelligence community for incoming samples.

Final disposition instructions and ownership of materials collected.
6-37. The CCMD is responsible for the transfer of those samples requiring definitive identification analysis
to a laboratory capable of conducting such. These laboratories may be outside the JOA (CONUS). The
CCMD is also responsible for requesting and coordinating inter-theater HAZMAT packaging and
compatibility waiver(s) as required. HAZMAT packaging waiver(s) and compatibility waiver(s) through its
Service focal point (see AFMAN 24-604/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/DLAI 4145.3, para 1.2.2).
COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE/SERVICE COMPONENT COMMAND
6-38. The combined JTF or Service component command is responsible for the expedient transfer of samples
requiring theater validation analysis to the nearest laboratory supporting theater validation inside the
combined JOA. The command requests and coordinates intratheater HAZMAT packaging waiver(s). They
coordinate hazardous diplomatic clearance for movement of samples across international borders/airspace.
6-39. The combined JTF or Service component command ensure that the HAZMAT declaration and
hazardous diplomatic clearance are uploaded into Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (96 hours
in advance) to ensure aircraft/aircrew meet the requirements. Requirements for packaging and movement are
specified in AFMAN 24-604/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/DLAI 4145.3. The combined JTF or Service
component command coordinate transportation control number and build unit line number in the Joint
Operation Planning and Execution System. The combined JTF or Service component command route the
request through the Intratheater Airlift Request System. They then coordinate temporary climate-controlled
storage (in theater) for samples awaiting transportation to theater validation laboratory or to CONUS for
definitive identification.
UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION COMMAND 
6-40. United States Transportation Command is responsible for coordinating strategic airlift from
intratheater aerial port of embarkation (APOEs) to CONUS-designated APODs. They also ensure
aircraft/aircrew selected meet the requirements specified in AFMAN 24-604/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB
505/DLAI 4145.3.

Exposure guidance. OEG, military exposure guidelines, and individual protection guidance (see
ATP 3-11.32/MCWP 10-10E.8/NTTP 3-11.37/AFTTP 3-2.46 further guidance).

Allocation of operational resources. Missions may result in contamination of equipment,
vehicles, and aircraft.

Intended use of host-nation assets. The plan may require liaison with diplomats, firefighters,
police, laboratories, medical personnel, and other host-nation assets.

Information management. Media issues, such as rules for engaging the media regarding
missions and explaining technical information. The requirement for secure communications,
reporting chains, and reachback resources.

Logistics. Designation of logistics priorities regarding safe handling and transport of samples and
escort elements.
CBRN STAFF 
6-42. The CBRN staff develops and implements the sample management plans for CBRN R&S elements.
The preparation of this plan should be coordinated with medical and intelligence staffs to support the unity
of effort for CCIRs. The CBRN staff may conduct or acquire the results of manual and/or computer-assisted
modeling of potential area/location and downwind hazards. When practical, the modeling will be completed
before the teams deploy. Depending on the type of mission, supporting tasks, and the resources available, the
plan should address—

The information requirement and level of analysis needed to achieve it. Not all of the samples
taken in a JOA are meant to be evacuated to CONUS. Many factors will influence the requirement
to take samples and determine what level of identification is needed. The commander’s PIR will
drive the prioritization of CBRN sample collection within the AOR.

SME support. Augmentation to the staff with on-site military or civilian scientific advisors or
off-site technical reachback capability to contact required subject matter experts.

Supporting laboratory and sample transport requirements. The requirement to transport
CBRN samples to supporting laboratories, while maintaining a chain of custody is of significant
importance. Depending on the proximity of the supporting laboratory, the CBRN R&S element
may be required to evacuate the sample directly to the laboratory. The need for air assets (for rapid
transport of samples) must also be considered. The command must ensure that it has an executable
plan to get the samples to the supporting laboratories. In some cases, dedicated assets are used to
escort the samples. The priority for dedicated assets will likely go to escorting the samples from
the theater back to the CONUS-based national laboratories for definitive analysis and
identification.

The CCMDs sample management plan. The sample management plan must include the escort
of samples within the AOR. This may require using other available assets as sample couriers. At
all times, the chain of custody must be maintained to ensure accurate reporting of the sample
collection operation results. Safety and security for the courier and the sample package must be
ensured.
Sample Collection, Management, and Processing

6-43. It is important that CBRN staffs clearly communicate in mission orders the level of identification
required which lays the framework for what collection efforts must be planned on-site, what CBRN R&S
forces are capable to provide these answers, and plans for transfer and laboratory analysis of the samples.
The commander may designate and allocate the necessary military assets to carry out the sample collection
missions. The commander’s staff serves as the nerve center and will command, coordinate, and control the
operations associated with sample collection.
6-44. The responsibilities of the unit staff may include—

Developing, implementing, and integrating the sample management plan with the higher
headquarters plan to support CBRN R&S elements.

Supporting CBRN R&S elements with transportation, interpreters, security, navigation and
communications equipment, food, shelter, medical care, decontamination, hazardous waste
disposal, and other functions needed to carry out the mission.

Establishing report protocols with the higher CBRN staff and command.

Maintaining reports.

Routinely updating downwind modeling.

Providing status reports to the operational commander and subordinate units affected by sample
collection operations.

Coordinating the escort of samples to regional and national identification laboratories for detailed
analysis.

Coordinating special storage, packaging, and handling requirements to ensure the integrity of
samples and the safety of personnel escorting or handling the samples.
CBRN ELEMENTS 
6-45. The CBRN R&S element is determined by the task assigned (for example, site characterization or
exploitation), the time available, security of the site, and level of analysis required. A CBRN R&S element
can be employed in subordinate teams such as decontamination teams, an initial entry team, an emergency
backup team, and sample collection teams. The number or size of the CBRN R&S element is based on the
size of the area/location, amount of personnel available, number of samples to be taken, transportation
method, available seating/storage space, and the time available for sample collection.
6-46. The primary objective of sample collection during site exploitation is to acquire sufficient agents,
precursors, and/or degradation products for laboratory identification. CBRN R&S elements may be
augmented with personnel who are experts in related specialist areas, such as—

A medical person who can assess health risks and address potential exposures before, during, and
after site exploitation.

An EOD technician.

An intelligence expert familiar with CBRN programs of the target country.

An interpreter.

A technical scientist related to the type of CBRN threat encountered (biological, chemical,
radiological).
6-47. Samples generated from CBRN R&S elements may be routed to a single sample control site (for
example, area medical laboratory) that is responsible for receiving samples and providing theater validation
identification. If necessary, the supporting laboratory prepares the sample for shipment to a CONUS
laboratory for definitive identification. See figure 6-2, page 6-10.

6-48. CBRN R&S elements conduct, record, and report surveys of known or suspected CBRN sites and
related incidents. They provide prompt estimates of the severity and extent of hazards using a CBRN warning
and reporting message. GTA 03-06-008 provides an easy reference aid for CBRN warning and reporting
messages. Additional responsibilities include—

Collecting, documenting, and initially packaging any samples taken.

Making prior coordination with intelligence and medical units.

Adhering to special sample collection tasks provided by the unit commander in the OPORD.

Coordinating and preparing for decontamination operations before beginning sample collection
missions.
SAMPLE COLLECTION PERSONNEL 
6-49. Generally, 
the 
collection 
of 
environmental 
samples 
is 
conducted 
by 
PVNTMED
detachment/personnel, CBRN personnel, damage control personnel, veterinary personnel, public health
officers, technical intelligence collection teams, bioenvironmental engineering officers, or other specially
trained personnel. Trained personnel ensure uniformity, viability, safety, and accountability in sample
collection procedures.
Note. Medical specimens are collected by medical providers. (See ATP 4-02.7/MCRP 
3-40A.6/NTTP 4-02.7/AFTTP 3-42.3 and ATP 4-02.84/MCRP 3-40A.3/NTRP 4-02.23/AFMAN

6-11
6-50. Before the decision to collect a sample has ever been made, key decisions must be based on─

The security of the site.

Any results and information from previous entry teams as to what materials might require
sampling, or equipment for analysis on site.

Any specific items of intelligence value that must be looked for.
6-51. Collecting samples and subsequent identification can provide the commander with information that
supports the CCIR, indicates the enemy’s or adversary’s intentions or actions and potential impacts to current
and future operations. While specific procedures vary, there are common guidelines that apply to any sample
collection operation. Safety is the foremost concern during a sample collection operation. The sample
area/location may be inherently dangerous and contaminated. The following common guidelines should be
considered when CBRN R&S elements collect samples:

Identify threats/hazards that could impact the sample collection operation. Develop a plan for
minimizing or avoiding the threat/hazard, to include environmental and other threats/hazards in
the immediate area (heat, cold, slipping, noise, electrical shock, venomous snakes, bug bites,
rodents).

Ensure that personnel involved in the operation are dressed in the appropriate level of protection
for the associated threats/hazards.

Ensure that the sample collection area/location is clear of secondary devices or triggered
mechanisms that could destroy the sample or cause harm to the CBRN R&S element before the
operation. Remain vigilant for the potential that these devices may be present. If any devices are
found, immediately clear the area/location and inform the higher headquarters so that they can
contact EOD assets to render the devices safe. Do not proceed with sample collection operations
until notified that it is safe to do so.

Ensure that backup personnel are dressed in the appropriate IPE/PPE, have monitoring devices,
and are prepared to enter the area/location as an emergency rescue team.
SAMPLE ESCORT TEAMS 
6-52. The sample escort team must be properly trained for the type of HAZMAT being transported (for
example, CBRN agents, precursors, contaminated materials, or explosives).
Note. United States Army technical escort teams should be comprised of a minimum of two 
personnel. At least one team member should be certified in AMMO-62 Technical Transportation 
of Hazardous Materials, if samples contain HAZMAT. The team should be certified in AMMO-
67, Hazardous Materials Familiarization and Safety in Transportation.  
6-53. Sample courier duties will be AOR dependent. Sample courier duties are as follows:

Conduct coordination.

Obtain quick reaction force coverage.

Obtain movement clearance.

Obtain and carry detection and identification kits and equipment.

Obtain appropriate IPE.

Ensure that immunizations are up to date.

Begin prophylaxis if required.

Obtain approved decontaminant solution.

Establish a linkup point with the CBRN sample element.

Understand the rules of engagement.

Conduct linkup.

Don IPE prior to the linkup.

Report the linkup to higher headquarters.


Ensure package integrity.

Use detection and identification equipment to determine if the outside of the package is
contaminated.

Ensure that the package is packed according to applicable guidance in AFMAN 24-604/TM
38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/DLAI 4145.3.

Place in an additional transport bag/container as appropriate.

Conduct a surface wipe-down of the package.

Conduct self-decontamination if required.
Note. Once the package integrity is verified, ocular and respiratory protection is no longer 
required. 

Maintain the chain of custody.

Transfer the sample package using the appropriate chain-of-custody forms and procedures.

Report the transfer of custody to higher headquarters.

Coordinate movement.

Report the departure and start of movement.

Coordinate with the applicable operations elements as required (for example, movement
through unit sectors).

Provide a convoy/aircrew mission and safety briefing.

Safeguard and transport the sample.

Be prepared to mitigate the effects of any potential inadvertent package breach.

Ensure that IPE/PPE is on hand during movement.

Maintain the sample at 1°C to 4°C.

Seal and repackage, if required.

Conduct decontamination of the package, if required.

Report any package breach.
TECHNICAL REACHBACK 
6-54. Technical assistance is drawn from military/civilian national assets (on-site or through technical
reachback). They will have detailed knowledge of the agents such as agent behavior, agent fate, signs and
symptoms, and information on detection identification and personal protection and decontamination. Their
expertise can be used for—

Risk management.

Interpretation of detection or analytical results.

Decontamination and waste management.

Risk communication and public affairs.

Transportation of HAZMAT.

Medical management of CBRN contaminated casualties.
6-55. The Laboratory Response Network and military environmental/medical laboratories will be identified
to support sample management operations. These laboratories support theater validation identification and/or
definitive 
identification 
as 
required.

SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PLAN 
6-56. The sample management plan is a product of a deliberate planning effort based on expected need to
collect samples due to enemy capabilities. The command must ensure that executable plans are integrated
from theater down to tactical collection elements, delegating appropriate elements to the task, execution of
the task (when and where), and providing guidance for getting the samples to the supporting laboratories.
The CCMD’s sample management plan must include the escort of samples within the AOR or back to the
CONUS-based national laboratories for definitive analysis and identification. This plan should include
safeguarding and prioritizing CBRN samples, tracking their movements and analytical status, escorting the
samples, and reporting the end result of the sample analysis. The CBRN sample management process
establishes procedures, guidelines, and constraints at staff and unit levels to protect and preserve the integrity
of CBRN samples that may have tactical, operational, and/or strategic implications.
6-57. At the operational level a sample management plan defines the strategies and methods to best fulfill
the objectives of the commander. Each mission is unique; therefore, it requires a plan that is individually
tailored to mission requirements. It accounts for the integration of the units conducting the collections,
escorts, communication, and laboratories.
6-58. The sample management plan is drafted to contain the minimum considerations critical to the success
of collecting samples to meet the commander’s objectives. It includes the—

Coordination with the theater surgeon or medical officer.

Purpose and scope of the CBRN R&S operation, including the objectives, limitations, who should
conduct the sample collection (CBRN personnel, PVNTMED personnel, tactical forces), and
pertinent background information.

Priority of the transport/evacuation of all samples to a laboratory for analysis.

Appropriately trained personnel or forces to escort the samples to transfer point or laboratory.

Movement clearances and rules of engagement for sample transport teams.

Coordination between appropriate command and staff transportation authorities to help transport
and transfer a sample across international borders or to another government agency.
Note. Such clearances and coordination should include consultation with the command servicing 
legal office to ensure compliance with international, U.S., and host-nation laws and with 
compliance with any agreements or arrangements established between the U.S. and the nations 
from and to which the sample is to be transported.  The command should also coordinate with 
higher headquarters to obtain verification that the intended activities have already been 
coordinated with, or do not require coordination with, the U.S. Department of State. 

Specific sample requirements of supporting laboratories including—the number of duplicates
required of each sample, the number of quality assurance/quality control and background samples
to be taken, and the different laboratory requirements for processing (theater laboratory, host-
nation laboratory).

Time schedule (how long the sample collection mission will last).

Documentation and disposition of samples.

Supporting sample transfer point locations or locations to deliver the sample.

Supporting assets (for example, security, decontamination, and medical).
6-59. At the tactical level, it becomes imperative that a sample management plan establishes priorities of
collection to ensure that the most important samples are taken first. The most important consideration is that
the sample accurately reflects the scene and that it has not been contaminated by the collection or handling
process. A sample management plan that will yield the most accurate results must be constructed for each
CBRN R&S operation—with considerations given to the sample media, associated key tasks, and sample
collection techniques required to support a successful operation.

31 March 2021 
SAMPLE TRANSFER 
6-60. The requirement to transport CBRN samples to supporting laboratories while maintaining a chain of
custody is of significant importance. Under normal circumstances, the CBRN sampling element is
responsible for the evacuation of their samples to a designated sample transfer point. However, depending
on the proximity of the supporting laboratory, the CBRN sampling element may be required to evacuate the
sample directly to the laboratory.
6-61. If a decision is made to transfer the sample(s) from one custodian to another, procedures established
in the sample management plans or orders should be followed with appropriate documentation recording the
details of the surrounding conditions that the sample was taken from, labeling, and chain of custody. If the
transfer is to be made out of theater, a request for movement support is forwarded through the chain of
command to the joint staff for validation. Once validated, an order is issued and the military services and
DOD departments and agencies are tasked to provide support. Depending on the importance of the sample
(for example, national security, MASINT, attribution), National Command Authority or joint staff directives
will determine the type of airlift provided. Based on the requesting office (J-2 or J-3), coordination is made
with the DOD and intelligence community to determine which definitive identification laboratory the
samples will be taken to for further analysis.
6-62. The United States Transportation Command coordinates the intertheater airlift and identifies the
APOE/APOD. Samples are packaged by the theater validation laboratory. The JTF personnel escort the
samples to the APOE and onward to final disposition. The CARA coordinates the receipt of the sample(s) at
the receiving APOD, and with each designated laboratory scheduled to receive the samples. A CARA
advanced team deploys to the receiving APOD for final airfield coordination, and CARA aviation detachment
deploys to the receiving APOD. Samples are transloaded from strategic airlift to CARA aircraft for
movement to final disposition. The CARA advanced team deploys and makes final coordination at the
receiving APOD closest to the designated laboratory and with local and state law enforcement agencies.
Samples arrive at the APOD near the laboratory and are transloaded to ground escort vehicles for movement
to the designated laboratory. After samples are turned over to the laboratory, the mission is complete.
LABELING AND CHAIN OF CUSTODY 
6-63. Samples must be properly labeled and marked to meet the standards and should be accompanied by a
strict chain of custody form that is maintained for every sample collected. The chain-of-custody document
must accompany the sample during transport from the point of collection, to the receiving laboratory, and to
the final disposition of the sample. The chain of custody will—

Provide answers about the sample: When was it collected? Who has maintained custody of it?
What has been done with it at each change of custody? What happened to it while in custody?

Show each time that the sample is transferred to another individual, element, unit, or agency. The
receiving person must sign the document to show that he received the sample.
6-64. To prevent confusion, a sample identification number is assigned to the sample. The identification
number format should be established in theater sample management plans or SOPs. For more information on
the sample identification number see appendix F.
Note. See appendix F for the new DD Form 3108 (CBRN Sample Documentation and Chain of 
Custody) for custody and transfer procedures.

Chapter 7 
Marking and Reporting 
This chapter provides information for marking and reporting CBRN hazard areas and 
contaminated materials. It also provides information managing CBRN information 
through the CBRNWRS and other tactical and medical reports. Both physical and 
digital marking is necessary to adequately warn forces of contaminated areas. 
SECTION I: MARKING 
MARKING CONTAMINATED AREAS 
7-1. Once an area has been surveyed and contamination is located, the area is marked and a report is
submitted to the requesting headquarters. Marking a contaminated area or equipment designates a hazard. A
more detailed survey determines the extent and intensity of the contamination. Markings warn individuals
and units visually, identify routes through or around contamination to maximize freedom of maneuver, and
identify any other specific hazards that are dangerous to operators and maintenance personnel.
7-2. All forces use standard contamination marking signs to indicate the type of contamination. Markers
are placed where they are most likely to be seen by approaching individuals and units. To prevent forces from 
missing posted markers and inadvertently entering contaminated areas, place adjacent marking signs at
intervals of 10 to 50 meters, depending on the terrain. Through CBRN 4 reports, contaminated areas can be
digitally marked on the common operating picture.
CONSIDERATIONS 
7-3. Any Service member discovering contamination should place contamination markers where the
markers are most likely to be seen by approaching military personnel and friendly forces. CBRN R&S forces
that locate contamination will place the markers creating a buffer from contamination.
7-4. The CBRN signs should be placed at waist height, right-angled apex downward, with the front of the
sign facing away from the contaminated area being marked and spaced at intervals of 10 to 50 meters
depending on the terrain. Place the CBRN signs on fences, trees, rocks, poles, supplied marking sign poles,
and other appropriate mounting mediums, or by putting the apex into the ground if a solid sign. This latter
method should not be used if the other methods can be adopted, as the signs might be obscured by grass and
other undergrowth and may be readily knocked down. Make sure the signs are clearly visible to the eye at a
distance of approximately 50 meters in most conditions of visibility. If the signs are placed within a CBRN-
contaminated area, the signs are to face away from the area of higher dose rate or higher concentration if
such can be determined. The marking will indicate the general area of ground contamination but will take no
account of downwind CBRN hazards. CBRN-contaminated areas may be of such extent that complete
marking of the whole perimeter will be impracticable. Military units should therefore take into consideration
that such areas might be marked only in the area of immediate concern.
7-5. Following a nuclear incident, radiological signs are to be placed on all probable routes leading into
radiologically contaminated areas. When the dose rate is above 1 centigray per hour, radiological
contamination signs showing the actual dose rate are to be placed on all probable route boundaries leading
into the contaminated area. Lower radiation contamination levels normally are not marked even though long
stays in areas of old contamination might produce significant doses. Military forces planning prolonged stays
in an area during a nuclear attack should check the area with RADIAC instruments regardless of whether it
is marked.
Chapter 7 
7-2
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
7-6. In the case of toxic industrial radiologicals, radiological signs are to be placed on all probable routes
leading into contaminated areas. When the dose rate is above 2 micrograys per hour, signs showing the actual
dose rate are to be placed. Also, move or correct the radiological sign periodically as radioactivity decays
over a period of time.
CONTAMINATION MARKERS DESCRIPTION 
7-7. Color. The primary and secondary colors of the CBRN marking signs are used to indicate the nature
of the contamination hazard. The primary color refers to the color used for the background of the front surface
of the marking sign. The secondary color refers to the color used for any markings and/or inscriptions
(preferably on the front surface of the sign). In the case of danger due to CBRN contamination, the primary
color, and the pattern of the signs by themselves will be the principal means of recognizing the type of
contamination. As a safeguard, the words ATOM (for nuclear contamination), BIO (for biological
contamination), or GAS (for chemical contamination), with the optional addition of a symbol where required
by national authorities, is painted or written with the secondary color on the front surface. The language used
for these inscriptions is selected by the forces erecting the sign. During joint operations, the language for
inscriptions is English. The inscriptions are written parallel to the longer side of the sign.
7-8. Shapes and sizes. CBRN signs should be—

The shape of the sign will be a right-angled isosceles triangle.

The base of the triangle will be approximately 28 centimeters (11 inches) and the opposite sides
will be approximately 20 centimeters (8 inches).

Triangles will be made of metal, wood, plastic, composition board, adhesive material, or any
adequate material available.

Existing stocks of colored triangular signs of slightly divergent shapes and sizes will be retained
and used until stocks are exhausted.
Note. Infrared and visual beacons can also be used to assist in marking CBRN-contaminated areas. 
Beacons may be visible at night over a range of up to 1,500 meters. Chemical lights can be attached 
to flag clips and placed between the beacons. 
7-9. Table 7-1 identifies symbols and markers used for marking contaminated areas.

The perimeter of a contaminated area should be marked by a fence 
placed on all probable routes leading into the contaminated area at 
about 20 meters (66 feet) before the point where the presence of 
contamination was detected. Ten to 50 meters may be between signs 
based on the terrain. In the case of toxic industrial chemicals, mark the 
boundaries of the exclusion or isolation zones (see TM 3-11.91/MCRP 
10-10E.5/NTRP 3-11.32/AFTTP 3-2.55).
Warning signs may be attached waist high to a fence or using the

INSCRIPTIONS 
7-10. Additional details concerning the CBRN contamination, if known, are to be inscribed on each marking
sign, preferably on the front surface. The extra details inscribed depend on the kind of CBRN contamination.
Multiple CBRN contamination may exist in some operational areas. In this case, the contaminated area would
be marked with the relevant marking signs, which would be placed adjacent to each other. Military forces
follow CCMD or JOA standards for marking CBRN hazards. When those standards are not provided or when
standard markers are unavailable, military forces conducting reconnaissance operations may use expedient
markers. Contamination marking signs are annotated with important information that include─

Chemical. Post the name of the agent, if known, and the date and time of detection.

Biological. Post the name of the agent, if known, and the date and time of detection.

Radiological. Post the dose rate, the date and time of the reading, and the date and time of the
burst, if known.
MARKING PASSAGE LANES AND BYPASS LANES 
7-11. The purpose of a CBRN zone, area, or route reconnaissance is to identify and mark areas of
contamination, to establish and mark clean lanes, and to sustain mobility for maneuver forces. Once an area
is searched and contamination is located, the area is surveyed (if required), marked, and reported to requesting 
headquarters. A detailed survey determines the extent and intensity of the contamination to maximize
freedom of action. Depending on the type of contamination (liquid, persistent, nuclear fallout), clean routes
around contamination may create unacceptable delays for maneuver forces. Contamination is not necessarily
uniformly distributed over an area and clean routes through the contamination may need to be identified.
Whether using mounted or dismounted techniques, lanes are checked for the existence of contamination and
marked.
7-12. Coordination should be made between movement control planners and enablers (such as CBRN and
engineer) to identify critical aspects of mobility through contaminated areas. SOPs are updated with standard
practices during combined arms operations. Marking of lanes is based on existing procedures established for
clearing obstacles. These markers may be combined or replaced by contamination markers. Lane markers are
spaced the width of the lane and in intervals of approximately 30 meters from the lane entrance to the exit as
shown in figure 7-1. During periods of low visibility, lane markers may be identified according to the SOPs.
Note. See ATP 3-90.4/MCWP 3-17.8 for more information on combined arms mobility.

7-13. Once routes are identified as uncontaminated or the contamination has been mitigated, the movement
lane can be marked using standard lane-marking patterns to help a unit through a lane. Appropriate CBRN
marking signs (chemical, biological, radiological) may be used along with standard lane markings. Far-
recognition and final-approach markers in a standard lane-marking pattern help commanders smoothly
change assault and follow-on forces into a column formation before passing through the lane. Lane marking
requirements include the─

Entrance funnel markers. Entrance funnel markers augment entrance marking. The V formed
by the funnel markers forces approaching elements into a column formation and assists drivers
and tank commanders in making last-minute adjustments before entering the lane.

Entrance markers. Entrance markers indicate the start of a lane through a contaminated area.
They signify the uncontaminated-side boundary of the contaminated area and the point at which
movement is restricted by the lane width and path. Entrance markers also indicate the lane width.
Therefore, it is critical for a maneuvering force to distinguish the entrance point clearly, since it
signifies the point at which passing vehicles can no longer adjust their movement in reaction to
the situation (direct and indirect fires) without jeopardizing the force. Entrance markers must be
visually different from handrail markers to help a force distinguish this critical point in the lane.
The distance between entrance markers must be the same as the width of the created lane. Entrance
markers placed a minimum of 4.5 meters apart indicate a lane capable of supporting mounted
movement, while markers placed a minimum of 1 meter apart indicate a dismounted lane.

Exit markers. Exit markers indicate the far side limit of a lane through a contaminated area. For
a passing force, the exit marker signifies the point at which movement is no longer confined to the
lane path. Like entrance markers, exit markers must be distinguishably different from handrail
markers; however, the exit may be marked the same as the entrance. Exit markers are placed to
the left and right of an exit point and spaced the width of the reduced lane. This visual reference
is critical when only a left handrail is marked. The combination of entrance, left handrail, and exit

markers gives the driver and the tank commander visual cues (entrance and exit points, lane width, 
and path) to pass safely along a lane. 

Far-recognition markers. Far recognition markers are highly visible markers located between
the final approach marker and the friendly element. They are primarily used when passing large-
sized (for example, Army battalion-size) forces through a lane where direct observation of the
final approach marker is denied due to distance, visibility, or terrain. Far recognition markers
should be different from the final approach marker. Far recognition markers indicate the point at
which forces begin changing their formation to posture for the passage. A single far recognition
marker may serve up to two lanes when located 200 to 400 meters apart. Once lanes are upgraded
to two-way traffic, far recognition markers are required for each two-way lane. Far recognition
markers should be visually alterable so that they can be distinguished from the far recognition
marker of an adjacent lane. This assists the mission command/C2 of large formations when passing 
on several adjacent lanes. When a far recognition marker serves more than one lane, a guide or a
traffic control point/post is collocated with the far recognition marker nearest the obstacle.

Final-approach markers. Final approach markers are highly visible, more robust markers that
augment the visual signature of entrance funnel markers. Units must be able to see the entrance
funnel and/or the entrance funnel markers from the final approach marker. The final approach
marker—

Provides the element commander with a highly visible reference point toward which to
maneuver his formation.

Signals element commanders to begin changing to a column formation.

Handrail markers. Handrail markers define the lane path through a contaminated area and
indicate the limits of the lane width. As a minimum, mounted and dismounted lanes have a left
handrail. Mounted and dismounted forces moving through a lane should keep the left handrail
immediately to the left of their vehicle or person. The lane width is defined by the entrance
markers. Therefore, when only the left handrail is marked, drivers use entrance and handrail
markers to gauge the lane width and path. As the operation progresses, lane marking may be
upgraded to include left and right handrails.
LEVELS OF LANE MARKING AND PATTERNS 
7-14. There are two levels of lane marking for CBRN hazards-initial and intermediate. Each lane-marking
level provides an increase in lane signature and capability. Lane requirements change over time as operations
mature from the passage of the assault force to the passage of larger follow-on forces. Initial lane-marking
requirements are driven by the nature of the fight through the CBRN hazard area. Initially, marking must be
rapid, providing only the bare minimum signature needed to safely pass initial small units (company teams,
platoons). This contrasts with lane requirements during later phases of an operation where larger units
(battalion and above) require improvements to existing initial hasty marked lanes. Two-way traffic becomes
a priority for the simultaneous forward passage of combat units and return traffic (ambulances, empty supply
vehicles) necessary to sustain the force. With the increase in traffic, volume comes more diverse forces and
levels of driver experience. Lane-marking limits must be clear to the most inexperienced driver or
crewmember; do not assume they have knowledge of the unit SOP.
7-15. Commanders must be aware of how the lane needs of a force change with the operation so that they
can anticipate lane marking and lane capability requirements. Integrating the levels of lane marking into the
overall CBRN defense plan ensures that a unit’s needs are satisfied. The forces necessary to mark and upgrade 
lanes must be allocated and tasked with that mission. The scheme of maneuver and the service support plan
are the basis for analyzing lane requirements. The following paragraphs describe lane- marking patterns in
detail and provide guidelines on when a commander should upgrade lane marking and lane capability.

Initial Lane Marking 
7-16. The CBRN R&S element emplaces the initial lane-marking pattern (see figure 7-2) immediately after
a clear path is identified through the CBRN hazard is determined. This is a signal to the supported unit
commander that the lane is ready for traffic. Initial lane marking is kept to a minimum, focusing on the
markings needed to pass immediate forces (company teams and smaller) through the lane to secure the point
of penetration on the far side if needed. Normally, a security force observes the lane as it is being marked
and does not need the greater visual signature for lane marking.
Note. The distance between markers is driven by mission 
variables. Distances shown are a recommendation.

Figure 7-2. Initial lane marking 
Intermediate Lane Marking 
7-17. Intermediate lane marking has two goals, increasing the lane signature to assist in the passage of larger
combat forces, and providing sufficient marking for two-way, single-lane traffic. Upgrading initial lane
marking to intermediate lane marking is triggered by one of two key events:

Commitment of larger combat forces that are unable to directly observe the CBRN-hazard area as
it was marked.

Rearward passage of sustainment traffic (casualty evacuation and vehicle recovery).
7-18. Intermediate lane marking builds on the initial lane-marking pattern by adding right handrail markers,
exit funnel markers, far recognition markers, and a far side final approach marker, see figure
7-1, page 7-5.

BYPASS MARKING 
7-19. Bypasses are marked using the same lane-marking patterns, marking signs, and visual cues as a lane.
However, marking a bypass around a CBRN hazard is much different from marking a lane through a CBRN
hazard because the amount of room available for forces to maneuver must be determined. While lanes through
a CBRN hazard are normally expanded to the left, bypasses are expanded away from the CBRN hazard.
7-20. Bypasses must show where it is safe to rapidly pass around a CBRN hazard, without unnecessarily
restricting the force’s ability to maneuver. To accomplish this, the marking unit will mark the bypass with a
bypass-marking pattern (modified initial lane-marking pattern with right handrail markers added). The unit
will perform reconnaissance and initially mark the bypass 500 meters wide to allow platoons to maneuver
around the CBRN hazard. The width of the bypass is increased as time allows further reconnaissance. Limited
visibility or additional CBRN hazards discovered at the flank of the CBRN hazard that is being bypassed
may constrain the marked width of the path to less than 500 meters. (The right handrail markers must be
visible from the left handrail markers.) In addition to bypass marking, units should consider establishing
mobile guards on the friendly side of the CBRN hazard to prevent vehicles/personnel from entering it. Figure
7-3 provides an illustration of bypass marking.
Note. The distance between markers is driven by mission 
variables. Distances shown are a recommendation.

ENHANCED MARKING 
7-21. In times of reduced visibility (for example, darkness, fog, rain) enhanced visual marking can be used.
Enhanced visual marking occurs by attaching sources of light where the actual marker is placed. The
additional lights are attached using various means such as clips, wire, ties, and string. This includes—

Infrared markers (nonvisible spectrum). Infrared markers cannot be seen unless using night-
vision devices with infrared capability. They are attached to actual contamination markers. They
can be used when friendly forces are equipped with night-vision devices that can see infrared.
Marking with infrared markers may occur when a military advantage would be obtained, such as
when an adversary does not have night vision infrared capability.

Visual spectrum lights. These lights can include chemical lights or battery operated lights placed
along with the actual contamination markers. They ensure markers can be seen in reduced
visibility using the naked eye.
7-22. Another form of marking can occur by transmitting marker placement on shared digital formats for
others to see on their various virtual maps. Examples of these include the use of overlay systems and various
Service mission command/C2 suites.

URBAN AREA MARKING CONSIDERATIONS 
7-23. When marking CBRN hazards in urban areas, additional steps should be considered. METT-
TC/METT-T will drive how CBRN hazards are marked. Additional marking considerations are—

Additional marking requirements may be required by the host country.

Entryways of suspect buildings and other facilities that may be contaminated with CBRN
agents/materials must be marked at critical points, for example, doorways and windows.

Additional marking at intersections of roads leading to CBRN hazards may be required to funnel
or steer traffic away from the hazard area.
MARKING CONTAMINATED EQUIPMENT 
7-24. Mark equipment and material to protect personnel from accidental contamination. Place contamination
markers on any unmarked equipment present in the attack area. Personnel using equipment after
decontamination must take precautions against vapor, particulate, and liquid contamination that may be
trapped inside filters, assemblies, and joints. The contamination could pose a hazard while equipment is being
used or maintained. Figure 7-4 shows an example hazard warning tag that may be used.

SECTION II: REPORTING 
CBRN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND REPORT FLOW 
7-25. CBRN information management focuses on obtaining relevant data about the operational area, which
can be processed by the CBRN staff into operationally significant information. To be useful, CBRN
information must be collected, reported, and evaluated. Once the CBRN information is evaluated, it can be
used to update intelligence, plan force protection measures, initiate exploitation operations, or conduct WMD
elimination planning. The volume of information collected and relayed disrupts communications and tactical
operations if not properly managed.
7-26. CBRN collection, reporting, and evaluation are crucial to the mission. Service members and unit
reconnaissance teams report observations, including postattack information through operations or control
centers by the fastest available means of communication. Reporting potential CBRN incidents serves two
critical functions, either of which permit dynamic retasking of forces to reduce or prevent exposure. The
critical functions of reporting are—

Informing the next level of command of the incident or potential incident.

Informing the elements at risk within the unit or within the area affected by the potential hazard.
RECORDING OF CBRN R&S INFORMATION

reconnaissance teams. This information from a survey or monitoring mission discovering chemical or

CBRNWRS 
7-28. During R&S activities, the CBRNWRS is used to speed communications using established systems
and preformatted messages. CBRNWRS is an information management function that entails collecting and
analyzing data from assessments within the operational area to support tactical operations. It provides quality
information to the right person at the right time in a usable form to simplify understanding and decision
making, which allows commanders and CBRN staffs to determine requirements on protective measures and
plan CBRN operations.
Note. The NATO conducts CBRNWRS activities according to STANAG 2103/Allied Tactical 
Publication (ATP)-45, and U.S. forces have implemented this agreement in TM 3-11.32/MCRP 
10-10E.5/NTRP 3-11.25/AFTTP 3-2.56.
7-29. The CBRNWRS is most effective when visualized and implemented as a collective system of
premission, mission execution, and postmission reports and messages. Sufficient information should be
available before execution of R&S missions. Information supports the rapid and effective execution of
tactical missions and reduces the impact of uncertainty. During the execution of R&S operations, collect
valuable information to better assess the overall CBRN threat or hazard to the force and the execution of
exploitation or WMD elimination operations. Table 7-2 represents reports and/or messages made at first
contact, in reaction to contact, and at summaries of postmission activities.

7-30. CBRNWRS capabilities include manual and automated processes in the creation; collection and
control; dissemination; and storage and retrieval of information obtained from affected forces, coalition
partners, and appropriate nongovernmental organizations and indigenous agencies. Capabilities may range
from detectors and alarms that are not integrated to fully integrated sensors at selected locations, allowing
the commander and CBRN staffs to anticipate future conditions and accurately assess risks. The vertical and
horizontal exchange of CBRN-related information relayed through the CBRNWRS keeps different
commands, agencies, coalition partners, and functional/staff personnel informed. The CBRN staff determines
the need for specific types of CBRN information (for example, when and where the CBRN attack occurred).
OTHER TACTICAL REPORTS 
7-31. Other tactical reports include unexploded explosive ordnance, spot reports, and size, activity, location,
unit, time, and equipment (SALUTE) reports and system-specific reports. Any force may provide a spot or
SALUTE report that includes information on contamination, locating CBRN ordnance, HAZMAT, or other
suspicious activities (for example, clandestine laboratory). Sensor suites provide system specific reports
containing component- and system-level detection and identification results.
TYPES OF CBRN REPORTS 
7-32. The CBRNWRS consists of six standard reports for reporting CBRN incidents or attacks, or locating
and reporting CBRN hazards within the OE. (See TM 3-11.32/MCRP 10-10E.5/NTRP 3-11.25/AFTTP 3-
2.56 for detailed information on each report.) The CBRN 4 reconnaissance, monitoring, and survey report is
the primary report format used by CBRN R&S elements to report information on located CBRN hazards.
Note. The following is unique to the United States Army: In addition to the standard CBRN 
reports, other reports may be used to provide additional details regarding a CBRN attack or 
locating CBRN weapons or materials. These reports are specialized CBRN reports. Specialized 
CBRN reports are used by units to provide situational awareness to the supported command and 
staff during execution of operations or in support of CBRN exploitation. 
MEDICAL CBRN REPORTS 
7-33. Information from CBRN surveys may be used in reporting to PVNTMED or public health personnel
CBRN medical incidents. Information is collected and provided to medical channels in a timely and adequate
manner. The documentation and archiving of actual or potential CBRN exposures is required for health
surveillance of potentially exposed personnel and to address future investigation.
7-34. An initial field account survey (IFAS) is documentation of on-site field information regarding CBRN
hazards, detection results, exposures, symptoms, visual and witness information, and other details. The IFAS
is available as electronic data fields in the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness
System (DOEHRS).
7-35. The IFAS should be completed by PVNTMED or public health personnel and the chain of command
involved in the incident. CBRN survey teams should work with PVNTMED to accurately report any hazards
and exposures potentially received during surveys. The IFAS ensures that CBRN incident details and a roster
of exposed and medically treated personnel are adequately captured. Details in the IFAS and the underlying
reports (such as significant activities and roster) may be classified. Unit security personnel must review the
IFAS and determine the classification.
7-36. The information in the IFAS is especially critical for documenting exposures to CBRN hazards and
will typically need to be collected by units involved in an attack, and CBRN units or personnel involved in
CBRN R&S or collection of CBRN samples. There may be multiple units completing separate IFASs. It is
essential that CBRN personnel provide specific R&S results to appropriate force health protection personnel
to complete the IFAS. Figure 7-6 is a sample document from the DOEHRS to capture information for the
IFAS. This figure only shows a portion of the information on the IFAS that CBRN R&S personnel might
submit to force health protection personnel.

investigate the exposure and work with medical providers so that appropriate medical follow-up and health
surveillance is conducted. In addition, the information can provide valuable lessons learned that could help
mitigate future health impacts from similar incidents. The form is completed as thoroughly as possible and
submitted to the command surgeon/ PVNTMED or public health officer within 24 hours of an incident.

documents, when documenting a health-risk assessment summary of the incident.

Appendix B 
Dismounted CBRN Reconnaissance and Surveillance 
This appendix provides doctrinal guidance on how to tactically employ CBRN 
capabilities for dismounted CBRN R&S operations. It discusses advantages and 
disadvantages of dismounted CBRN R&S versus other methods.  
OVERVIEW 
B-1. Commanders, informed by the operational and mission variables, decide when to employ CBRN
dismounted reconnaissance versus mounted reconnaissance. The commander must understand that a CBRN
R&S capability is most vulnerable to CBRN hazards and enemy actions when conducting missions using the
dismounted method. Dismounted CBRN R&S incurs greater risk to forces that can be mitigated by time,
sufficient security, tactical considerations, and preplanned means to address contaminated equipment and
possible casualties.
B-2. Dismounted CBRN operations maximize movement to objectives by using mounted platforms. The
intent of movement platforms is to reduce the overall work-stress and increase efficiency for operations.
Mounted and dismounted operations are frequently intermingled to support the overall reconnaissance
objective. The vignette, page B-2, and figures B-1 and B-2, pages B-3 and B-4, provide an example of
employment of dismounted CBRN R&S capabilities.
ADVANTAGES 
B-3. Advantages of dismounted CBRN reconnaissance missions include─

Permitting elements to benefit from the concealment offered by vegetation and terrain.

Providing maneuver forces the capability to exploit narrow gaps between CBRN contamination,
and enabling penetration of forces at an enemy’s perceived denied terrain.

Increasing distribution of CBRN sensors throughout formations to improve the likelihood of
hazard detection.

Retaining mobility, particularly in dense terrain and urban areas.

Reducing visual or audio signature.

Providing the ability to conduct reconnaissance operations when the CBRN hazard is in close
proximity to adversary positions.

Conducting reconnaissance operations in restricted terrain, such as dense urban environments and
subterranean facilities.

Providing the commander with more refined, tailored information collection capabilities that
answer specific PIRs with a higher confidence.

Manipulating and employing existing control mechanisms directly to reduce hazards, especially
in TIM facilities.

Making logistical support requirements easier due to no large equipment decontamination
requirements.
DISADVANTAGES 
B-4. Disadvantages of dismounted CBRN reconnaissance missions include─

A slow rate of movement and increased time to complete the mission.

A greater work/rest requirement and oxygen consumption rates to execute operations.

An extensive requirement for detailed preliminary planning and coordination.

Increased risks from conventional forces, weapon systems, and working in direct contact with
CBRN threats/hazards.
CBRN R&S Vignette 
The 61st Chemical Company (Hazard Response) is direct support to the brigade 
engineer battalion (BEB) of the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team/4th Infantry 
Division. The company’s mounted nuclear, biological, chemical, reconnaissance 
vehicle platoon is operational control to the armored brigade combat team cavalry 
squadron, but it still retains its two organic hazard assessment platoons. The company 
is tasked to conduct area reconnaissance of a possible theater ballistic missile 
transporter erector launcher that was interdicted by close air support elements. The 
3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team must maneuver in vicinity of the interdicted theater 
ballistic missile. The S-2 and brigade CBRN officer believe that the theater ballistic 
missile has been filled with VX due to several indicators, including the confirmed 
presence of an enemy decontamination truck at the theater ballistic missile location. A 
CBRN 3 report has already been completed by the brigade staff, predicting the possible 
hazard area so that units in the vicinity can be warned. The 61st Chemical Company 
(Hazard Response) is tasked by the brigade engineer battalion to execute area 
reconnaissance to determine the extent of possible CBRN contamination, providing 
freedom of maneuver to the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team. The company 
commander receives the order from the BEB S-3 and an intelligence brief from the 
battalion S-2. The company commander notifies the BEB commander and S-3 of the 
security and time requirements for the mission. One platoon of mechanized infantry 
and one engineer reconnaissance team are operational control to the 61st Chemical 
Company to provide security during the CBRN area reconnaissance. When the 
company team is formed and all key leaders are present, the company commander 
provides a WARNORD to the platoons. The latest intelligence and the mission and 
operational variables are communicated to the leaders; particular emphasis is placed 
on 
individual 
protective 
equipment, 
hot/warm/cold 
zone 
requirements, 
decontamination, and contaminated casualty treatment and evacuation. The main 
effort is assigned one hazard assessment platoon that conducts actions on the 
objective, 
including 
conducting 
the 
area 
reconnaissance 
and 
technical 
decontamination of personnel in the hot zone. The supporting efforts are the 
mechanized infantry platoon and engineer reconnaissance team that provide security 
in the cold zone. Another hazard assessment platoon will coordinate with the BEB 
decontamination team to provide operational decontamination support to the company 
team in the warm zone. All elements of the company team are given sufficient time to 
prepare before the line of departure. The details of the operation order are finalized 
and briefed to all elements of the company team. The company team conducts 
rehearsals, including a rehearsal of concept, clarifying actions on objective, and hazard 
mitigation. The company team crosses the line of departure and establishes an 
objective rally point and command post in the cold zone.

CBRN R&S Vignette (continued) 
Simultaneously, the security element sweeps across the objective, using weapon 
optics to provide visual confirmation that no enemy personnel are present and 
minimizing cross contamination. Security positions isolate the objective from enemy 
forces. CBRN detectors within the security elements show no indication of VX. The 
hazard assessment platoon establishes the warm zone, hot zone, entry/exit locations, 
and technical decontamination station and is in constant communication with the 
company command post that relays all information to the BEB operations section. The 
area reconnaissance element conducts a site survey, confirming that the theater 
ballistic missile was filled with VX, but the dispersion of the contents was localized to 
the destroyed theater ballistic missile area and 150 meters toward the east of the 
objective. The hazard assessment platoon sends a CBRN 4 report, including each 
point at which positive detection was made. This information is immediately 
communicated from the objective through the company team and BEB operations 
section to the armored brigade combat team commander. The tactical decision is made 
to mark the contamination and bypass it. The hazard assessment platoon does not 
take a sample, but it marks the contaminated area with assistance from the engineer 
reconnaissance team and conducts technical decontamination. The company team 
then returns to the objective rally point and returns to the assembly area for debrief.

mission.

UNDERSTANDING THE MISSION 
B-5. When given the mission, it is imperative that the dismounted CBRN R&S element fully understands
the mission and the tasks associated with it. Many times a single word in a mission statement implies very
complex troop-leading procedures. The mission statement often uses the forms to describe the mission task.
When discussing the purpose, words such as confirm or deny can be insignificant when compared to words
such as exploit and characterize. For example, At 091600JUN27, 1/61 CM CO conducts area reconnaissance
at OBJ ZULU (LM 1234 5678) to exploit suspected enemy WMD cache. A thorough task analysis to
understand specified and implied tasks is imperative when planning dismounted CBRN reconnaissance
operations.
PRIORITY INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS 
B-6. Dismounted CBRN R&S, beyond any other CBRN R&S method, is the best-suited CBRN R&S
method for gathering specific information at an NAI. Dismounted CBRN R&S elements must understand
what information is essential to meet the commander’s intent. Information has value to various organizations.
The CBRN R&S element must understand the information the commander has deemed a priority for
collection. The dismounted CBRN R&S element must also understand its specific information collection role
in large-scale ground combat operations. Not every dismounted CBRN R&S element should conduct site
exploitation, even though they may have the equipment to do so. For instance, a CBRN dismounted R&S
element could be sent into a bunker facility to conduct a preliminary survey and provide information about
the number of CBRN rounds, type of rounds, and their markings.
B-7. The commander provides success criteria for each mission, providing the LTIOV that correlates with
a no later than time. A CBRN reconnaissance mission can be considered successful when the CBRN R&S
element reports what it has found prior to the LTIOV.
B-8. Coordination with other elements, especially those that have the capability and mission to sample and
package CBRN material, is critical to a successful mission. Capabilities such as security, decontamination,
communications, sample transfer and transport, chain of custody, and the ability to escort samples play an
important role in the success of a dismounted CBRN reconnaissance mission.

B-5
EQUIPMENT PREPARATION 
B-9. Effective selection of key equipment to perform the CBRN reconnaissance mission can change the
success or failure of a mission. Examples of criteria that can cause a CBRN mission to fail include—

Taking the wrong equipment.

Taking too much equipment.

Failing to properly prepare the equipment (such as improper calibration, no air in the self-
contained breathing apparatus, no batteries).

Lacking enough sample collection containers.

Having inappropriate decontaminants.
B-10. Determining if a CBRN R&S element is prepared for its mission is the tactical leader’s responsibility
and is verified by the commander, based on the level of acceptable risk. Noncommissioned officers are
paramount to ensure equipment readiness and conduct individual and team training to execute missions.
CBRN warrant officers inform the commander on the technical capabilities and limitations of equipment.
Very rarely is an element completely prepared for every aspect of a mission. With the best intelligence
available and an understanding of the operational and mission variables, equipment is employed to maximize
CBRN R&S asset capability while minimizing risk.
EXECUTING DISMOUNTED CBRN RECONNAISSANCE 
OPERATIONS 
B-11. Executing dismounted CBRN R&S should be conducted in a deliberate and controlled manner to
ensure safety and success of the mission. Table B-1 provides an example of some procedures associated with
executing dismounted CBRN R&S operations. The steps are divided into phases for easier understanding
and, eventually, execution.
Note. Not all of the steps and supporting tasks in table B-1 are required to complete the

TACTICAL MOVEMENT DURING MISSIONS 
B-12. When the situation permits, dismounted CBRN elements conduct tactical movement to and from the
objectives by using available vehicles to expedite ground movements. Vehicle movement also enables the
dismounted element to bring a larger array of equipment to increase available capabilities at objectives. It is
important for the dismounted CBRN element leadership to discuss what essential pieces of equipment must
be taken on the mission. They must also determine where secondary pieces can be maintained to minimize
space and weight during load planning. This is of particular importance if the dismounted element must
conduct ground movement on foot for any substantial portion of the mission.
B-13. If the tactical situation requires a security force, the headquarters unit with areas of operations
responsibility assigns security, with sufficient command and support relationships to accomplish the mission.
One option is to establish a company team, with the dismounted CBRN R&S element as part of the team.
For example, an infantry company has overall mission control but has a dismounted CBRN reconnaissance
platoon task-organized for a specific mission. The critical planning factor is that the CBRN R&S element has
tactical control of all actions in vicinity of the area of contamination. The security lead element controls the
tactical placement of the security forces encompassing the exterior of the contaminated area to protect the
dismounted CBRN R&S element. It is recommended that the link-up between security forces and the
dismounted CBRN R&S element occur during deliberate mission planning.

OCCUPY AN OBJECTIVE RALLY POINT IN VICINITY OF TARGET AREA 
B-14. A CBRN R&S element should approach a CBRN survey area from upwind. The CBRN R&S
leadership determines the initial predicted hazard/exclusion area. The element stops prior to actually entering
the suspect area or point at which to set up an objective rally point. The distance from the actual site is
determined by various factors, such as local weather data/conditions and geography (altitude), terrain,
suspected agents, security concerns, and size of the site. Guidance may be given by the higher command, but
normally this distance is provided in element SOPs. It may also be based on a safe standoff distance provided
in the Emergency Response Guidebook or other such documents.
B-15. Once the safe standoff distance is determined, the R&S element establishes 360 degrees of security
around the objective rally point. The lead element solicits, from higher headquarters, last-minute intelligence
updates on the objective. A command post is established to provide C2 of both the security and dismounted
CBRN R&S elements from the objective rally point. The command post location will also serve as the
element staging area for all actions on the objective.
B-16. To track downrange personnel and equipment, a log must be maintained of personnel and equipment
that are in the hot zone or warm zone or that have been left in the hot zone or warm zone. At the command
post, a log is kept concerning area operations and events, including entry times and expected exit times. The
sample collection element keeps a log in the hot zone.
CONDUCT AREA SURVEY 
B-17. The CBRN R&S leadership assesses the initial IPE required for actions in and around the objective.
The guidance may change as information is refined during the leader’s reconnaissance. A map reconnaissance 
is the minimum requirement to conduct operations in a possibly contaminated environment, which incurs
significant risk to troops and mission. Ideally, dismounted CBRN R&S leaders have a full common operating
picture with supporting intelligence about the objective, known contaminants, and risk to forces.
B-18. The dismounted CBRN R&S element conducts a leader’s reconnaissance to refine the plan and
establish an initial assessment of activity at the NAI or objective. The key task during this reconnaissance is
to determine the general location of the working zones (cold, warm, and hot). The CBRN R&S element leader
identifies a general area for the entry control point, technical decontamination point, and entry and exit
corridor or route. The leader templates the hot and cold zones and clearly communicates the zone meanings
to supporting elements. Details include─

Identifying the potentially safe route to the objective, void of physical hazards.

Identifying the target area.

Identifying contaminated and uncontaminated casualty collection points.

Describing the area (types and the number of buildings, obstacles, types of containers, azimuths
and locations in the area, potential hazards) by using photographs, sketches, and distances.
B-19. The CBRN R&S element assesses the exterior of the objective or NAI to ensure that they are at the
proper location and to determine potential enemy resistance. The security element then isolates the outside
of the objective by using the mission parameters to maintain safe distances from the objective; they also
conduct monitoring of security forces. Security forces control internal and external movement inside the
isolated area. The use of force and engagement criteria should already be established during mission planning.
B-20. Before entry, the entry/exit corridor is established and communicated to all elements. An emergency
decontamination point is established to provide a hasty means of decontamination and emergency extraction.
A back-up entry element must be ready to conduct rescue. The back-up entry element serves as an emergency 
extraction element and a relief element, should assessment be extensive and the operation take more time
than expected. At a minimum, a backup element will enter the area of suspected contamination in the same
level of protection as the element in the hot zone.
B-21. Plan completion includes validating the initial planning guidance or modifying the plan to better fit the
on-ground truth at the objective. Security or CBRN R&S forces may be repositioned to fit the OE. The CBRN
R&S leaders determine the exact location for the entrance and exit corridor or route. A specific entry control
point is established between the cold zone and warm zone. At the entry control point, a final check of
personnel and equipment is conducted to ensure readiness before entry into the warm zone. If enemy presence

31 March 2021 
at the objective exceeds the security force capacity, a decision should be made to displace or increase security 
forces at the objective.  
B-22. The technical decontamination lane is set up in the designated exit route. The R&S element is self-
sufficient in using technical decontamination. Technical decontamination allows the R&S element to rapidly
process through a decontamination process, removing their contaminated IPE/PPE and equipment brought
into the hot zone. Contaminated IPE/PPE and equipment taken into the hot zone is packaged for processing
(monitoring/decontamination) at a supported decontamination site located away from the site.
B-23. A hot line is established to identify the transition between the hot zone and warm zone. This line may
also be referred to as the liquid control line. The area between the cold zone and the hot zone is considered
the warm zone. The line that transitions from the warm zone to the cold zone may also be referred to as the
vapor control line. All of the decontamination processes occur in the warm zone. After the establishment of
the hot, warm, and cold zones, anything in the hot or warm zone is considered potentially contaminated and
must be checked. If contamination is detected, it must be decontaminated and rechecked for cleanliness
before passing into the cold zone. In dense urban environments, the plan is adjusted using existing structures
to establish the zones. In figure B-3, the suspected structure aboveground is the warm zone. A hot zone is
established after determining that liquid contamination may exist in the underground portion of the suspected
structure. The entry and exit corridors are located just outside the main entrance, as shown in figure B-3.
Note. When dealing with underground contaminated areas, exercise caution when establishing a 
vapor control line above the hot zone. If the contamination is lighter than the air, it will rise out of 
the underground facility.

B-24. Security forces then conduct a sweep through the objective and use optics to maximize standoff
distances. They maintain safe distances from suspected contamination and establish an inner cordon. Enemy
or civilian personnel should be neutralized or detained according to the rules of engagement. Dismounted
CBRN R&S should not be executed until the inner cordon is established. The inner cordon security force
element must establish local security for dismounted CBRN R&S elements throughout the objective.

Engagement of enemy forces fleeing or counterattacking from the objective is extremely likely. If needed, 
security forces and detained personnel are decontaminated at the technical decontamination point.  
B-25. An initial entry element is sent in to conduct a thorough initial area survey. The following are key tasks
(in priority order) accomplished during the initial area survey:

Determine radiological levels.

Determine pH levels. (High pH levels will damage upper explosive limit/lower explosive limit
and oxygen sensors).

Monitor for upper explosive limit and lower explosive limit.

Determine oxygen levels.

Determine volatile organic compound levels.

Reevaluate the appropriate IPE/PPE.

Identify all structures in the area that are to be assessed.

Determine priority of effort.

Prepare an area sketch to include determining the Global Positioning System coordinates and other 
location identifying information (such as street addresses).

Designate buildings by numbers and rooms by letters, or according to the SOP. (This is important
later when assessing the material collected from the site).
B-26. Before entering a structure, a Global Positioning System coordinate of the structure will be taken and
entered on a diagram/sketch form (see figure B-4). If there are streets located near the structure, the names
of the streets and the proper address, if known, will be entered.

B-27. The initial entry element consists of a minimum of two personnel. When unexploded explosive
ordnance and IEDs exist, EOD personnel must be the initial entry element to render safe the devices. EOD
personnel ensure that the area is clear of additional IEDs or booby traps. In the case of open areas (fields), a
preliminary sweep is conducted to ensure the same. When it is not practical to clear all IEDs, booby traps, or
similar devices from the area, the EOD element clears and marks a path to the sample collection area if
sample collection is required. The initial entry element leader determines the best placement for the path.
Duties are divided up among the element members to record the area, monitor the site for hazards, and
communicate. If possible and manpower is available, additional personnel should be added to conduct the
initial area survey.
B-28. In unknown environments, the initial entry element wears a level of protection determined by the
element leader based on the expected enemy, CBRN hazard, and situation. If the use of Level A or Level B
PPE using supplied air is required, multiple entries into the site may be necessary to conduct the initial area
survey. This is driven by the capacity (time) of the air supply available and if decontamination is required
after each entry.
B-29. The initial area survey varies between a rapid task or a drawn-out task, depending on the size and
complexity of the objective or NAI. This is primarily a walk around the area and maximized visual
observation of the internal contents of structures without entry. If possible, the survey R&S element should
sketch out the structure as they move through it. If the structure is complex, this may be difficult but it will
allow the R&S element to better document their findings and develop the sample collection plan. It also
provides better clarity to those reading the assessment report.
B-30. As previously discussed, the element approaches the area from upwind. They use designated entry and
exit corridors or routes when entering and leaving the hot and cold zones. To reduce the risk of becoming
contaminated by an element coming from the contaminated environment, the team will not use the same
route for entry and exit. See figure B-5.

B-31. The recorder, with guidance from the initial entry team leader, prepares the area sketch (see figure
B-6). Once the area has been properly surveyed (when oxygen levels, upper and lower explosive limits,
volatile organic compound levels, liquid/vapor hazards, and radiation levels have been determined), decisions
can be made regarding the appropriate level of IPE/PPE for follow-on elements collecting samples or
conducting presumptive or field confirmatory identification.
Figure B-6. Example initial building sketch 
B-32. Unit SOPs should establish standardized methods (numbering/lettering buildings and rooms) for entry
teams to use for recording and reporting information on sketches. For example, to assist in the initial area
survey, all buildings in the area will be assigned a numeric designator (such as a grid reference graphic from
higher headquarters). Within each building, all floors (including subfloors, rooms, and voids) are identified
by numbering or lettering floors and rooms according to an established SOP. Entrances to each building are
noted on the area sketch, along with the number of floors and if the building extends belowground. Each
sketch needs a legend to define symbols used on the sketch. The sketch provides a structure for tracking
collected material (samples, documents, and other items of interest).
B-33. The entry element marks the door with a slash. This indicates that an element has entered through that
doorway. When they exit, they mark the same door, leaving an X. This indicates that an element has entered
and exited. They will also place the room designation on the door. See table B-2, page B-12, for the marking
scheme.

Table B-2. Door and entrance marking 
Location 
When marking doors, place the markings on the door, if possible. This avoids confusion if doors are close to each 
other.  
The second location is on either side of the door. If there is a potential for confusion as to which door is being 
marked, an arrow in the information section of the marking can be used. 
The third location is on the floor immediately in front of the door in question. 
Route markings that indicate direction are placed on the walls at eye level to indicate the direction an element 
has moved. 
Colored chalk, tape, or permanent marker can be used to mark. 
When possible, markings will be large, clearly legible, and made at eye level.  
Additional information (unit searching, time in/time out) may be added. 
NFPA 1670 establishes marking systems for search and rescue incidents similar to examples in this table. 
The element has entered a room/passed through a doorway and has not exited. A single slash 
is placed on the door. 
The element has entered/passed through and has exited. This marking is a continuation of the 
original slash placed on a door where entry was made. 
The element has cleared the room and needs to be reviewed by follow-on elements. This could 
mean that there are potential samples or other items of interest to follow-on elements. 
Information provided at the base of the marking is reserved for things of immediate importance 
to an element making an entry, such as UXO, booby traps, flammable atmosphere readings, 
other possible dangers, or other information important to follow-on elements. 
The element has moved in the direction indicated. The design of the arrow is of little 
importance, as long as it clearly shows the direction of movement by the element.

B-34. The initial entry element conducts first-entry monitoring of the area for the presence of a hazardous
environment. First-entry monitoring can also assist in determining sample priorities. For confined space or
limited ventilation areas, the initial entry element uses an appropriate detector to check the air quality for
explosive hazards or a lack of oxygen. Before opening the door, the entry element uses the detector with the
sampling probe, if equipped. The probe is slipped under the doorframe, if possible. If not, the element
carefully cracks open the door, observes for booby traps, and inserts the probe into the room. The element
uses the detector to determine the oxygen level in the room, to check if combustible gases are present, and to
check if volatile organic compounds are present in the atmosphere. The element will also check radiation
levels. A lack of oxygen (not applicable if the element is using self-contained breathing apparatus systems)
or the presence of combustible gases or radiation above a predesignated level would cause the element to
abort entry. If volatile organic compounds are present, the element will determine which compounds are
present before making a determination if it is safe to enter and if a change in IPE/PPE is necessary.
B-35. If the detector readings are acceptable, the element proceeds. The element continues to check for booby 
traps as they open the door and carefully enter the structure. Once inside, the element gains situational
awareness. The element should survey and assess the structure according to the sampling plan.

B-36. The initial entry element moves through the structure according to the tactical situation. While in the
structure, the element makes radio checks with the command at regular intervals. During this radio check,
the element apprises the CP of their location and actions. If the element loses communication with the
command post, they will retrace their movement until communications can be reestablished. If
communications cannot be reestablished, the element will execute their contingency for communications
loss, such as sending the back-up entry element to reestablish communication.
CAUTION 
 In no instance should a single person be sent into the hot zone. 
B-37. The initial entry element will use a search pattern to survey the room. The room should be divided into
quadrants. The element should search the room by starting at the door and working from left to right. The
initial sweep of the room is to observe for key items of interest and hazards. The element designates the room
walls with numbers to better record what they see (see figure B-7 and figure B-8). The element will be alert
to the presence of radiation (using a RADIAC detector) and chemical warfare agents (using chemical
detectors such as the lightweight chemical detector/joint chemical agent detector). The element members
continually check the device for readings.

B-38. The initial entry element should be alert for the presence of booby traps. The element should touch
nothing during the initial sweep. They should note the location of closed containers and items of key interest.
The initial sweep is to obtain information to facilitate detection and identification operations. The second
element member documents the room with a digital camera or video.

B-39. The initial entry element marks safety hazards, access and egress areas, and challenges that may affect
the operational effort of the sample collection element. Marking may be used according to the unit SOP. Each
CBRN R&S element should have internal marking procedures in its SOP.
Note. Area survey rule of thumb─turn nothing off that is on, and turn nothing on that is off. 
B-40. During the initial sweep of the room, the initial entry element should locate items of interest (warning
signs, added or extra ventilation, markings on containers, chemical symbols or notation, paperwork,
drawings, sketches). The element should look for items relating to CBRN, such as the following:

Containment.

Processing equipment.

Waste disposal.

Signs of release.

Safety equipment.
B-41. The equipment can be varied and may never have been intended for the purposes for which it is now
being used. Additionally, the safety considerations for handling and storing material may be very different
from those of a western nation. Initial survey observations are to—

Look for anything obvious while securing and during the initial survey of area.

Determine if CBRN agents are being produced, stored, or weaponized at that location.

Be alert for booby traps/IEDs.

Note instrument readings and/or detections.

Consider if the layout of the area is consistent with the facility (false walls/rooms).
B-42. When a suspicious item is encountered, the entry element must first assess the big picture, look for all
hazards before proceeding, document its location and the surrounding area, and determine if it is an item of
interest. The entry element should answer the following questions:

Is this item CBRN-related and was it expected or unexpected?

If it is not CBRN-related, is it hazardous and does it pose a threat?
B-43. The entry element looks for items of information value that may be taken as grab samples. When
approaching the item of interest—

Photograph/document the undisturbed item.

Determine if the item is recognizable.

Move toward the item.

Watch for dangers.

Record all actions with the item.

Initiate detection procedures.
B-44. When the initial sweep of the room is complete, the entry element should proceed to the next room.
Once the entire building has been surveyed, the entry element should move to the element control point.
Depending on the size and complexity of the site, the initial surveys may take a short period of time or require
a substantial amount of time. Depending on the IPE/PPE and detection equipment (based on the hazard)
requirements, multiple trips may be required to complete the initial survey.
B-45. If possible, the R&S element should sketch out the structure as they move through it. This may be
difficult if given a complex structure, but it will allow the element to better document their findings and
develop the sample collection plan. It also provides better clarity to those reading the assessment report.
B-46. The initial entry element leader marks possible sample collection points by priority, but the priorities
are subject to change based on METT-TC/METT-T. The preferred method is to use 3- by 5-inch cards, with
number one as the top priority.

B-15
B-47. Using the diagram/sketch form, the sample element leader starts to sketch the layout of the area at
which the sample collection is to take place. This is done in each room/area where sample collection is
projected to occur. Particular attention is given to determining potential sample collection locations. Sketches
should be made of the layout of the room/field, including the dimensions, measurements, and items that may
be of interest. The diagram/sketch form may be used to brief the sample collection element and will be used
for further analysis of the sample collection area. The sample collection element may use this form when
conducting sample management operations. Relevant reference points, hazards, and control areas should be
annotated on the form. Numbered index cards that are indicated in the diagram/sketch form can be linked
with the photographic log, enabling sample collection locations to have a commonality throughout the
operation.
B-48. On completion of photographing, filming, and surveying, the R&S element places documentation (with
information facing outward so that it can be read) into a large zip-top bag. Photographic equipment is bagged
unless equipment was placed in an underwater camera case before entering the contaminated area and was
processed through technical decontamination. Care must be exercised when handling possibly contaminated
equipment that contains sensitive electronics. If contamination is suspected on the device, use liquid crystal
displays on video cameras and digital cameras to review area information without removing the photographic
equipment from clear overpacks, a 6-milliliter bag, or zip-top bags.
B-49. After processing through technical decontamination, the initial entry team leader briefs the sample
collection element members about the objective. They review digital photographs, video, and the
diagram/sketch form. As part of the area overview, the initial entry team leader identifies all hazards noted.
The initial entry element leader reviews possible sample collection points with the sample collection leaders
to eliminate confusion on site about the potential sample.
B-50. Based on the initial area assessment, the element leader revises his plan for assessment and collection.
The R&S element leader makes IPE/PPE adjustments based on the detection and identification of agents, as
required. A priority of effort for sample collection may be developed. The dismounted CBRN R&S leader
sends a CBRN 4 report to the higher headquarters and determines actions on the objective.
B-51. Based on METT-TC/METT-T, the R&S element leader may execute one of the following COAs:

The element leader will call forward the sample collection element and begin sample collection
operations. Ensure that the sample team brings all required equipment to the sample area. The
sample collection team leader briefs his personnel on the sample collection plan. This occurs when
limited time is available and adequate protection is available for the R&S element to stay longer.
This method allows the leader to actually be present and show further sample collection and
exploitation elements where to collect samples. A drawback is that the guidance and briefing to
the arriving element is done while in protective posture. Providing an effective briefing in this
type of situation is challenging for the R&S leader. This includes additional entry teams continuing
the area assessment and rest periods per entry element.

The sample collection team leader will process through technical decontamination with the EOD
element and recorder. The sample collection team leader formulates the sample collection plan
based on intelligence, photographs, and area sketches of the sample area. This method is used
when there is enough time and equipment (such as IPE/PPE, dosimetry devices, and
decontaminants) available.
CONDUCT SAMPLE COLLECTION
B-52. The dismounted CBRN R&S element conducts sampling, as required. The developments of a sample
management plan and sample collection are further discussed in chapter 6 and appendix F.
Appendix B 
B-16
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
CLEAR AREA 
B-53. Before exiting the area, the R&S element must communicate ahead to the decontamination station in
the warm zone so that decontamination personnel are prepared to receive them. The contamination area and
waste should be marked for future remediation.
B-54. The method of decontamination is determined based on the time available, threat level, and hazard
agent and on the IPE/PPE worn. It is possible that no contamination was encountered in the hot zone and the
R&S element leader can therefore forego conducting decontamination based on the findings of the entry
elements and field analysis conducted. Before decontamination, a check is conducted of all personnel who
were in the hot zone. Technical decontamination is then conducted for all applicable elements.
B-55. If the situation is permissive and the R&S element is supported by a decontamination unit, a thorough
decontamination operation should be undertaken at or near the objective. Doing so limits the possible spread
of contamination and negates the need for further decontamination operations.
B-56. An initial closure report, including the essential facts and findings, is sent to the higher or supported
headquarters. This information should include sufficient information for immediate tactical implications or
decision making. The potential duration of the hazard and the impact of contamination on the freedom of
maneuver are priority.
RETURN TO ASSEMBLY AREA 
B-57. Upon decontamination and displacement of the inner cordon elements, the CBRN R&S element
notifies the outer cordon tactical leader to displace and link up at the ORP. The CBRN R&S and inner cordon
security element conduct tactical movement back to the ORP. Upon link-up with all elements, the CBRN
R&S element prepares for movement back to the assembly area.
RECOVERY 
B-58. Service members should be evaluated by medical personnel, especially if they are suspected to have
been exposed to HAZMAT. In the case of an infectious biological agent, consider quarantining personnel for
the length of the incubation period for the suspected agent to prevent spreading.
B-59. All samples collected are transferred to designated collection points according to the theater sample
management plan. The dismounted CBRN R&S element conducts postoperations preventive checks and
services on equipment per the SOP. If any equipment requires additional decontamination, it is conducted as
required. The dismounted CBRN R&S element leader should complete a final closure report of actions on
the objective, facts, findings, and recommendations to the supported commander.
DISMOUNTED LOCATE TASK 
B-60. To find suspected or actual CBRN hazards, the CBRN locate task is used. The staff passes information
collected from the suspected or actual incident to the CBRN R&S element. When conducting dismounted
CBRN reconnaissance, the CBRN R&S element assumes the appropriate protective posture according to
current intelligence. The CBRN dismounted locate task requires more time and possible exposure to
contamination than mounted operations. The CBRN locate task requires applied judgment based on METT-
TC/METT-T. The mission, terrain, and adversary indicate the technique that should be used. Additional
considerations for dismounted CBRN locate tasks include unexpected encounters, such as the adversary
situation, type of agent, and need for decontamination operations. Upon locating the hazard, the CBRN R&S
element reports findings and awaits follow-on orders, such as conducting survey operations.
B-61. There are five techniques used to locate possible contamination in the AOR. The techniques are zigzag,
lane, cloverleaf, grid, and triangulation.

ZIGZAG 
B-62. The zigzag technique is used to locate contaminated areas during route, zone, or area reconnaissance
missions. Depending on the terrain, the distances could be large or small. The zigzag technique has a higher
probability of detecting contamination because the surface area not traversed is less than that of other search
techniques. The following are procedures for the dismounted zigzag technique (see figure B-9):

The CBRN R&S element begins its search at the line of departure (start line), maintaining at least
25-meter intervals between personnel.

The CBRN R&S element moves forward along a line that is oriented 45 degrees from the start
line.

The CBRN R&S element monitors identification equipment for indications of contamination.

After the CBRN R&S element has moved 100 meters along the first zig, it turns 90 degrees and
zags taking readings at each turn and repeating the process until the end.

The distances could be larger or smaller depending on the terrain.

The CBRN R&S element continues to zigzag until the CBRN R&S element has reached its limit
of advance.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results once the entire mission area has been searched.

If the CBRN R&S element did not search the entire mission area, it begins a new sweep.

The CBRN R&S element repeats the process until contamination is detected or the entire mission
area is searched.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results normally using CBRN 4 report.

The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination and medical support as required.

The CBRN R&S element may transition to a CBRN survey if contamination is detected.

LANE 
B-63. The lane technique is used to locate contaminated areas. It is very similar to the zigzag technique, but
it is primarily used during route reconnaissance missions. It can also be used for area reconnaissance of long,
narrow pieces of terrain (such as defiles). (See figure B-10.) The following are procedures for the lane
technique:

The CBRN R&S element begins its search at the line of departure, maintaining an interval of less
than 50 meters between personnel.

The CBRN R&S element follows an azimuth for a designated distance.

For narrow routes, the CBRN R&S element moves in a staggered column. Each CBRN R&S
element moves along a line until it reaches the limit of advance.

If the CBRN R&S element does not search the entire mission area, it begins a new sweep and
repeats the process until contamination is detected or the entire mission area is searched.

If contamination is detected on a route, the CBRN R&S element creates/submits a CBRN 4 report
and moves on to the next lane.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results after the entire mission area has been searched.

The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination and medical support, as required.

The CBRN R&S element may transition to a CBRN survey if contamination is detected.

CLOVERLEAF 
B-64.  The dismounted cloverleaf technique (see figure B-11) is time-consuming; however, it provides
detailed coverage and information about an area. The following are procedures for the dismounted cloverleaf
technique:

The CBRN R&S element begins its cloverleaf at a starting point central to the area to be checked.

The CBRN R&S element moves in a figure-8 pattern by using the start point as the center of the
8. If a second element is used, the second element conducts the same pattern by moving in a 90-
degree direction from the first element. If only one element is conducting the cloverleaf, it
completes one figure 8 and then conducts a second figure 8 at a 90-degree angle from the first
figure 8.

The CBRN R&S element monitors identification equipment for indications of contamination.

The CBRN R&S element conducts a check at set intervals along its route or performs continuous
monitoring for a radiological locate technique.
Note. Depending on the terrain, the distances could be large or small. 

If the CBRN R&S element does not search the entire mission area, it begins a new cloverleaf
within the area not checked.

The CBRN R&S element repeats the process until contamination is detected or the entire mission
area is searched.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results, normally by using a CBRN 4 report.

The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination and medical support, as required.

The CBRN R&S element may transition to a CBRN survey if contamination is detected.

GRID 
B-65. When accuracy is important, the grid technique is employed by R&S elements that conduct dismounted
reconnaissance. It is employed by superimposing a grid over the R&S team maps, which enables the team to
rapidly communicate locations of detections, casualties, and areas at which samples were collected. Numbers
and/or letters are assigned to each detection point, and each detection point is associated with a predetermined
Global Positioning System location. (See figure B-12.) The grid technique may also be used for a site survey,
such as within a building. (See figure B-13.) The following are procedures for the grid technique:

The CBRN R&S element establishes the boundaries of the area to be checked.

The CBRN R&S element preselects points within the area that it will check for contamination.
(Normally the points to be checked are laid out in an evenly spaced grid pattern.)

The CBRN R&S element conducts checks at each point within the grid.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results, normally by using a CBRN 4 report.

The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination and medical support, as required.

The CBRN R&S element may transition to a CBRN survey if contamination is detected.

TRIANGULATION 
B-66. The triangulation search technique is used to locate radiological sources that have been detected by
some form of dosimeter or detector. (See figure B-14.) The triangulation technique strengths in locating
radioactive sources lie with the small number of personnel (three) needed to accomplish the procedure. This
ensures that personnel exposures remain as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA); it also ensures the ability 
to rapidly locate the radioactive source, even if buildings or other shielding materials are in the area.
B-67. Shielding effects from buildings may produce confusing dose-rate readings. The following procedures
are used when obstacles are encountered along the triangulation legs:

At the location of initial hazard recognition, the element leader takes readings in a semicircular
sweep method, noting the directional heading of maximum exposure.

From this heading, two additional personnel are sent out 100 meters in directions of +45 degrees
and -45 degrees from the initial heading.

The sweep method is performed by personnel to determine the direction heading of maximum
exposure.

If readings are less than 0.02 centigray per hour, personnel reverse their heading, travel back 60
meters, and perform the sweep method again.

After three readings above 0.02 centigray per hour are obtained and plotted, an indication of which
area contains the radiological source should be evident.
B-68. The following procedures are used for triangulation with obstacles:

Walk along the obstacle, staying 10 meters away at all times. Take readings every 5 to 10 meters
while facing the obstacle.

Upon reaching the end of the obstacle, travel beyond the obstacle 20 meters, assume the direction
of the original heading, and take the next set of dose rate readings by using the semicircular sweep
method.

If the largest dose rate reading does not point back toward the obstacle, provide the directional
heading toward the largest reading. However, if the largest dose rate reading does point back
toward the direction of the obstacle, provide the directional heading associated with the largest
reading taken from behind the obstacle.

In some situations, element members may reach the end of the obstacle and see that all dose rate
readings were the same. Under these circumstances, personnel should continue to take readings at
10-meter intervals along the entire obstacle perimeter. If exposure readings in the direction of the
obstacle remain constant, the source is located in the obstacle. However, if the dose rate readings
do not remain constant, provide the directional heading (facing away from the obstacle) at the
location of the largest dose rate reading.
B-69. The projected area at which the radiological source is located is used as the focal point for a cordon
declaration by the incident commander.
Note. If at any time the dose rate is above 1 centigray per hour, stop immediately, note the location 
and direction of the reading, and leave the area. Adjustments to the triangulation legs must be 
made so that personnel exposure remains ALARA.

DISMOUNTED SURVEY TASK 
B-71. The CBRN R&S elements conduct a survey to determine the extent of contamination of the CBRN
hazard. The CBRN survey defines the boundaries of contaminated areas. The CBRN reconnaissance survey
task used for dismounted reconnaissance is similar to that used for mounted operations, except for the
distances covered and the duration of time spent in an area. A dismounted survey is configured in a minimum
of two-man elements for personnel safety. One person conducts the survey, while the other person remains
in overwatch as security.
B-72. Dismounted CBRN reconnaissance provides the tactical commander with accurate information
pertaining to CBRN activity in the OE. This prepares forces to operate in the CBRN environment or, if
possible, to avoid contamination. The commander considers the factors of METT-TC/METT-T to determine
whether to conduct a dismounted survey.
B-73. A dismounted CBRN survey may be conducted upwind, downwind, or crosswind of the suspected area
of contamination. The survey element remains mounted until, based on the assessed hazard, a point is
determined according to the unit SOP. At that point, members of the survey element dismount, don the
appropriate level of IPE/PPE and dosimetry devices, and initiate the predetermined dismounted technique.
B-74. Using an upwind approach, the members of the survey element reach the expected point of release
(source) of the hazard quickly and are not exposed to the hazard until they are close to the release point. They
do run the risk of being exposed to greater levels of contamination because the concentration of the CBRN
agent or materials is greater at the release point. This is especially true for radioactive sources.
B-75. CBRN survey techniques require applied judgment based on METT-TC/METT-T. The mission,
terrain, and adversary indicate the technique that should be used. There are six dismounted survey techniques
that can be employed when contamination is located: nearside-far side, box, star, bounce-and-bypass, course
leg, and preselected dose rate. The following are CBRN survey procedures:

Locate the general boundaries of the contaminated area.

Place warning markers at specified intervals around the contaminated area and at all entry points.

Determine the intensity of the contamination.

Report information by using a CBRN 4 report.

NEARSIDE-FAR SIDE
B-76. The nearside-far side dismounted survey technique (see figure B-15) is used by an R&S element when
they enter a contaminated area. The nearside-far side survey technique employed by a dismounted element
is similar to the technique used by the mounted element. The following are procedures for the dismounted
nearside-far side survey technique:

Each CBRN R&S element determines if they are in the contaminated area.

If a CBRN R&S element is in the contaminated area, it moves back along its original path,
checking for contamination every 50 meters until CBRN contamination is no longer detected.

Once out of the contaminated area, the element moves away from the contaminated area an
additional 20 to 50 meters and emplaces appropriate warning markers.

Once the initial element has found the nearside boundary of contamination, it moves forward
across the contaminated area, testing every 50 meters.

When contamination is no longer detected, the R&S element moves forward another 20 to 50
meters and checks again.

If no contamination is detected, it places a CBRN warning marker.

This process is repeated until it is clear of the contamination.

Each R&S element executes this process to determine the nearside and far side boundaries of the
contamination.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results, normally by using a CBRN 4 report.

The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination and medical support, as required.
Figure B-15. Dismounted, nearside-farside survey technique 
BOX
B-77. The dismounted box survey technique (see figure B-16) is used to determine the general dimensions
(length and width) of a contaminated area. The dismounted box survey technique is best employed by three
teams, and the process starts once a team enters the contaminated area. The following are procedures for a
dismounted box survey technique:

All teams in the reconnaissance element stop and check for contamination in their immediate
areas.

The first team to report contamination becomes the base element. If any other teams in the element
are located in the contaminated area, they must back out of the contamination.


All teams in the element should orient on the base team. At least one team should be to the left
and one team to the right of the base team.

The base team moves forward and finds the farside of the contamination. The crew continues to
check for contamination every 50 meters.

When the crew fails to get a positive reading, they proceed another 50 meters and establish the
initial farside line.

The team to the right of the base team places a CBRN warning marker to indicate the initial
nearside line, moves forward 50 meters, and checks for contamination.

The crew can determine two things at this point—contamination or no contamination. If
contamination is detected, the team turns 90° to the right, moves 50 meters, and checks again.

If no contamination is found, the team turns 90° to the left, moves forward 50 meters, and checks
again. This process of going straight or turning continues in a boxlike movement until the team
has crossed the initial farside line; this is the initial right limit of the contamination. The movement
of the team depends on the orientation of the contaminated area.

Once the team has reached the initial farside line, the team moves toward the base team while
checking for contamination.

The team to the left of the base vehicle executes the same movement as the team to the right,
except its first turn will be to the left.
B-78. While the dismounted box survey technique may sound complicated, it is not difficult to execute. The
reconnaissance unit leader must receive continuous reports from the other teams on their positive or negative
findings. After reviewing these reports, the CBRN reconnaissance unit leader plots the findings to determine
the contamination layout. When the CBRN reconnaissance unit leader is satisfied that the limits of the
contamination have been determined, the unit locates the best route to bypass the contamination. Warning
markers are erected around the contamination and along trails that lead into the contaminated area so that the
bypass route is clearly marked.

STAR 
B-79. The dismounted star survey technique (see figure B-17) is a quick way to determine the rough limits
of a contaminated area. The following are dismounted star survey technique procedures:

The CBRN R&S element that encounters the contamination moves back from the contaminated
area 50 meters from the initial positive reading. (This point is the base of the star.)

The CBRN R&S element posts a warning marker and proceeds forward to find the far side,
detecting every 50 meters until no contamination is detected.

The CBRN R&S element proceeds another 50 meters, checks again so that no contamination is
detected, and posts a warning marker.

This ends the first leg of the star.

The element turns about 135 degrees and travels in that direction, detecting every 50 meters.

If no contamination is detected on this leg, the element does not travel any longer than the length
of the initial leg.

The element repeats this process until it arrives at or near the base of the star.

This technique can be used by two or more elements to obtain more detecting points, increasing
the accuracy of the survey.

BOUNCE-AND-BYPASS
B-80. The bounce-and-bypass dismounted survey technique (see figure B-18) is used to locate the general
boundaries of a CBRN contaminated area. The following are procedures for the dismounted bounce-and-
bypass survey technique:

The CBRN R&S element stops and checks for contamination in their immediate areas.

If no contamination is detected, the CBRN R&S element proceeds forward, checking for
contamination every 50 meters.

When contamination is detected, the CBRN R&S element proceeds out of the contaminated area,
checks for contamination every 50 meters, and places a CBRN marker 50 meters after no
contamination is detected.

The CBRN R&S element then turns in the cardinal direction toward the contaminated area,
checking for contamination every 50 meters until contamination is detected again.

Once contamination is detected, the CBRN R&S element proceeds out of the contaminated area
and places a CBRN marker 50 meters after no contamination is detected.

This process continues until no contamination is detected.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results, normally by using a CBRN 4 report.

The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination and medical support, as required.

COURSE LEG
B-81. The course leg technique (see figure B-19) is used to find the extent and intensity of radiological
contamination. The CBRN R&S element moves between two checkpoints; for example, from point A (the
top of a hill) to point B (the top of another hill). Readings are taken at given intervals along the route between
the two checkpoints. When conducting a dismounted radiological course leg, the element must be given a
turn-back dose and a turn-back dose rate. Reporting the results of dismounted course leg techniques may be
done in various ways. Normally, a survey data sheet (DD Form 3038) can be filled out and turned in to the
tasking headquarters at the end of the mission, or the data can be sent via a CBRN 4 report. The following
procedures outline the course leg technique:

The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at the start point of the
course leg.

The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at each preselected
interval along the course leg. Under no circumstances should the element continue further into a
contaminated area if it reaches its turn-back dose or turn-back dose rate.

The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at the end point of the
course leg.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results, normally by using a CBRN 4 report.

The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination and medical support, as required.

The CBRN R&S element rechecks and zeros the RADIAC meter before each course leg to ensure
proper operation.
Note. Conducting dismounted radiological course legs versus mounted or aerial radiological 
course legs results in higher radiation doses to personnel. Further guidance on the radiological 
aspect of conducting a course leg technique can be found in TM 3-11.32/MCRP 10-10E.5/NTRP 
3-11.25/AFTTP 3-2.56.

PRESELECTED DOSE RATE
B-82. The dismounted R&S element looks for a given dose rate or multiple given dose rates designated by
the commander. This technique (see figure B-20) is used for old contamination and neutron-induced
radiation. For old contamination that is greater than the time of attack (for example, H+48), the CBRN R&S
element moves along a route or designated straight line in an area until it finds 1 centigray per hour and/or
its designated dose rates. When conducting a dismounted radiological preselected dose rate technique, the
element must be given OEG, which includes a turn-back dose and turn-back dose rate. Reporting the results
of dismounted preselected dose rate techniques may be done in various ways. Normally, a survey data sheet
(DD Form 3038) can be filled out and turned in to the tasking headquarters at the end of the mission, or the
data can be sent via a CBRN 4 report. The following procedures outline and illustrate the preselected dose
rate technique (see figure B-20, page B-28):

The CBRN R&S element departs its start point and constantly monitors the survey meter while
moving along its designated route. Under no circumstances should the element continue further
into a contaminated area if it reaches its turn-back dose or turn-back dose rate.

Upon locating a reading of 1 centigray and/or its designated dose rates, the CBRN R&S element
records the dose rate and drops a radiological marker, if directed.

The CBRN R&S element records its final reading upon reaching the end point of its route, its
highest preselected dose rate, or the turn-back dose rate.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results, normally by using a CBRN 4 report.

The CBRN R&S element reports personnel exposure to its command for recording and annotation
in their medical records.

The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination and medical support, as required.

The CBRN R&S element rechecks and zeros the RADIAC meter before each mission to ensure
proper operation.
Note. Conducting dismounted radiological preselected dose rate missions (versus mounted or 
aerial radiological preselected dose rate missions) results in higher radiation doses to personnel. 
Further guidance on the radiological aspects of conducting a preselected dose rate technique can 
be found in TM 3-11.32/MCRP 10-10E.5/NTRP 3-11.25/AFTTP 3-2.56.

DISMOUNTED CBRN SURVEILLANCE 
B-83. Dismounted CBRN surveillance operations are generally conducted in the same manner as mounted
operations. Although the term dismounted defines this section, there will be times when the CBRN R&S
element uses vehicles to get to or near the location at which the dismounted CBRN surveillance operations
take place. Consideration must be given to the mode of travel, OP selection, sustainment and relief, security,
and follow-on mission of CBRN surveillance operations.
B-84. Generally, a dismounted CBRN surveillance operation requires the CBRN R&S element to travel on
foot to conduct operations. This is due to the close proximity of the area, buildings, roads, or personnel that
the surveillance operation is targeting and to the METT-TC/METT-T factors that are favorable for the
operation. When the CBRN surveillance operation is located at distances too far to travel on foot, another
mode of transportation is used. Based on METT-TC/METT-T factors, the CBRN R&S element may travel
by land vehicles, amphibious craft, or aircraft such as helicopters. When traveling by watercraft or airframe,
the CBRN R&S element is dropped off at a predesignated location and then travels by foot from the drop-
off point to the specified location. In that case, the need to protect and possibly conceal a vehicle is not an
issue. However, when the CBRN R&S element is not being dropped off, vehicle safety and concealment
must be considered. Additional considerations include—

Providing additional security for vehicles.

Taking caution to not be heard or seen by the adversary or others who may communicate arrival
to the adversary.

Dismounting at distances that will not alert the adversary to the arrival of the CBRN R&S element.

Being compromised by civilians in the mission area.
B-85. CBRN surveillance provides observation of a specific area for indications of a CBRN incident. Based
on JIPOE/IPB and vulnerability planning, these designated areas are typically NAIs. The commander
prioritizes the use of available CBRN R&S elements against designated NAIs. The CBRN R&S elements
monitor, watch, and listen to areas for indications of a CBRN incident. Surveillance may be conducted from
OPs—positions occupied to observe a designated area. The CBRN R&S element occupying the OP reports
indications of a CBRN incident or adversary activity. Surveillance may also be conducted by routine patrols
through the operational area. This type of surveillance is normally conducted in rear areas along main supply
routes (MSRs) and road networks.
SUPPORT AREAS 
B-86. The areas of greatest vulnerability that require increased CBRN surveillance are large, fixed sites (for
example, ports of debarkation); staging and marshaling areas; hubs; bases, assembly areas; MSRs; and sites
involved in early force buildup activities, such as─

APODs. Aerial port of debarkation fixed sites may be targeted to disrupt or inhibit U.S. military
deployments. Because it is unlikely that the operational areas of an aerial port of debarkation will
be contaminated at any one time, it is particularly important that the commander know the
locations of hazard areas, working and parking area requirements, and the availability of runways
and taxiways.

SPODs. SPODs may also be attractive targets for CBRN attacks. CBRN attacks may result in the
contamination of some operating surfaces, but the size of the contaminated area may be small
compared to the size of the port. Conducting area reconnaissance at facilities within the port is
important to sustaining throughput operations.

Gap crossing sites. Gap crossing sites and the far and near sides of obstacles are viable targets
for CBRN attacks due to their ability for the enemy to employ CBRN to isolate one portion of the
force from another. The enemy can then defeat friendly forces in detail. CBRN R&S, particularly
in a surveillance role, is used near these sites to provide rapid hazard identification and mitigation
strategies that support engineer and sustainment operations, with the intent of reestablishment of
ground lines of communication.

OBSERVATION POST SITE SELECTION 
B-87. The supported unit leader or the CBRN R&S element leader selects the general location for the OP.
The leader considers METT-TC/METT-T factors and the information collection plan when determining the
general positioning of the OP site.
LOCATION SURVEILLANCE 
B-88. Reconnaissance is the first step in location selection. Begin with a map reconnaissance. Use the map
reconnaissance to determine initial surveillance areas that support the employment tactic; and then select
primary, alternate, and supplemental surveillance locations within each surveillance area. Some rules of
thumb for the CBRN surveillance include the following:

Reconnoiter the detection areas and potential locations firsthand, if possible.

Coordinate with the terrain owner before conducting the surveillance operation.

Ensure that the CBRN R&S element includes the designated serial leaders.

Select the location that provides the greatest concealment.
DISMOUNTED OBSERVE TASK 
B-89. The CBRN surveillance task of observing is accomplished by two techniques─critical node and area
array. Figure 5-5, page 5-13, and figure 5-6, page 5-14, depict what these two techniques look like using
graphic control measures.
CRITICAL NODE 
B-90. In support areas, dismounted CBRN R&S elements may be assigned CBRN surveillance missions to
observe designated areas for CBRN incidents. MSRs and areas to be occupied by logistics and mission
command/C2 facilities may also be checked for CBRN threats/hazards before their occupation. The following 
are critical-node technique procedures:

Occupy observation points to overwatch the designated NAIs.

Report all indications of a CBRN incident.

Employ monitoring capabilities at NAIs, such as large sustainment areas, gap crossing sites, or on
the far or near side of obstacles.

Operate and perform operator maintenance on CBRN monitoring equipment.

Conduct CBRN monitoring operations with multiple capabilities, providing redundant coverage.

Provide data for the completion of CBRN reports.
B-91. The primary means of surveillance may be from OPs. An OP is a position occupied to observe a
designated area. The mounted CBRN R&S element reports any indication of a CBRN incident or adversary
activity. Another means of mounted CBRN surveillance is conducting routine patrols through the operational
area. This is normally conducted in support areas along MSRs and road networks.
AREA ARRAY 
B-92. An area array is established in order to maximize the probability of CBRN hazard detection over a
large area of interest. The primary objective is to detect a hazard upwind of the operational area of concern
and to provide the greatest potential warning to those in the hazard area. The specific architecture of the array
is designed by the CBRN staff in close coordination with operations, intelligence and medical staffs. The
following are procedures for conducting the area array observation technique:

Consider the enemy situation, terrain, weather conditions, performance characteristics, and
quantity of CBRN detector assets.

Determine the appropriate separation distances between CBRN detectors.

Operate and perform operator maintenance on CBRN monitoring equipment.

Report all indications of a CBRN incident.

Conduct CBRN monitoring operations.

31 March 2021 
DISMOUNTED MONITOR TASK 
B-93. The CBRN surveillance task of monitoring is accomplished by two techniques─periodic and
continuous. Following a CBRN incident, the periodic monitoring technique may be utilized over an extended
period to determine whether hazardous effects remain in the area. The continuous monitoring technique is
accomplished by employing CBRN detector assets uninterrupted over the duration of the monitoring
operations.

Periodic. As the name implies, periodic monitoring is accomplished by employing CBRN detector
assets at predetermined intervals of time. Before an incident, the time between monitoring is based
primarily on the threat assessment. When intelligence estimates deem that there is a reduced
likelihood of a CBRN incident, the commander is more apt to call for periodic monitoring of the
area of concern. In doing so, CBRN resources (equipment and personnel) are conserved and power
consumption (fuel and batteries) is reduced.

Continuous. Similar to periodic monitoring, the threat assessment is the prime factor in deciding
to apply the continuous monitoring technique. When an incident is anticipated, continuous
monitoring provides the greatest opportunity for warning the area of concern of impending
hazardous conditions. During and immediately following a CBRN incident, the continuous
monitoring technique is employed to note either the dissipation or proliferation of the hazard area
and to estimate the duration of CBRN effects. Continuous monitoring places a much heavier
burden on personnel (operators and maintainers) and logistics (detectors, batteries, fuel). These
factors should be considered and adequately coordinated throughout the staff.

C-1
Appendix C 
Mounted CBRN Reconnaissance and Surveillance 
This appendix provides guidance and doctrinal recommendations for the execution of 
mounted CBRN R&S operations. 
OVERVIEW 
C-1. The CBRN R&S element must understand the tactical, operational, strategic mission, and end states.
This understanding provides the R&S leader the background to recognize how the assigned information
collection efforts fit into the CCIR. The CBRN R&S element must focus on the information the commander
has deemed priority. Army CBRN R&S elements that integrate with other maneuver elements for security
missions must be familiar with ATP 3-20.98, which provides specific guidance for tactical actions on contact
with enemy forces. To integrate effectively with maneuver forces, habitual training relationships should be
established before combat so that CBRN R&S elements can execute battle drills and maneuver in
coordination with combat arms elements.
C-2. The mobility of mounted CBRN R&S elements makes them most effective in conducting zone, area,
and route reconnaissance. Mounted CBRN R&S elements may also conduct point and area surveillance, but
their use in surveillance does not capitalize on their mobility and protection from enemy fires. Some of the
dismounted CBRN R&S methods and techniques disclosed in appendix B may be applied to mounted CBRN
R&S operations, but at great expense to the mounted asset’s advantages. Mounted CBRN R&S maximizes
the mobility, protection, and speed at the expense of more definitive analytics and ease of sampling. Mounted
CBRN R&S has the mobility to keep pace with maneuver forces along major frontages and to rapidly shift
reconnaissance capabilities from one position to another. When given the mission, it is imperative that the
CBRN R&S element fully understands the type of unit and mission it is supporting and the tasks associated
with it. Mounted CBRN R&S elements may be attached to cavalry, armored, and infantry formations to
provide early warning of enemy CBRN threats during security operations. To effectively execute mounted
CBRN reconnaissance, they must understand the reconnaissance objective and how to use the full breadth of
capabilities to answer information requirements. A thorough task analysis is imperative when planning
mounted CBRN R&S operations.
C-3. Cavalry squadrons and armored or infantry battalions request mounted CBRN R&S support through
their higher headquarters when staff analysis templates CBRN attacks by the enemy to block, disrupt, fix, or
deny key terrain to friendly forces. The staff may also determine that the WMD-launching transporter erector
launcher, multiple rocket launchers, or enemy CBRN units in the AO may contaminate significant maneuver
areas when destroyed. Mounted CBRN R&S elements allow the maneuver commander to quickly confirm
or deny CBRN presence at pace with the force and allow the commander to exploit opportunities where the
enemy perceives a situational advantage. Mounted CBRN R&S capabilities execute missions in the deep and
close areas where maneuver forces seek to retain the initiative, especially in offensive operations.
C-4. A key factor in mounted CBRN R&S execution is the time available to conduct the mission. The
commander must recognize that there is increased risk to the R&S element and the main body when the pace
of the reconnaissance is accelerated. Speed and momentum are typically critical to the successful execution
of operations that the CBRN reconnaissance mission may support. Commanders must know when to employ
mounted CBRN R&S over dismounted reconnaissance based on task-organized assets and the advantages
and disadvantages of either asset. Mounted CBRN reconnaissance provides the tactical commander the
ability to retain operational tempo.
C-5. The key tasks for mounted CBRN reconnaissance are detect, locate, identify, survey, sample, mark,
and report. (Detailed information on sample collection is located in Appendix F; additional information on
reporting and marking is located in Chapter 7.)

31 March 2021 
C-6. The commander considers the factors of METT-TC/METT-T to determine whether to conduct
mounted reconnaissance. A mounted reconnaissance operation is conducted when—

Operational tempo and time constraints based on METT-TC/METT-T are required for immediate
tactical decisions. Mounted CBRN R&S provides rapid information about contamination to the
maneuver commanders to adjust their plan based on presumptive identification (supporting
immediate tactical decisions).

Sample collection and site exploitation are not a priority. Although the mounted CBRN R&S asset
has the capability to conduct sampling, a determination needs to be made on whether this is priority 
to support the immediate tactical needs of the JFC.

The required reconnaissance is not constrained by terrain, such as dense urban terrain or
subterranean environments.

Terrain is relatively open (for example, the roadways or axis is capable of sustaining the type and
weight of the vehicle used for the reconnaissance).

Environmental conditions permit this type of reconnaissance. (Deep snow and muddy terrain
greatly hinder mounted reconnaissance.)
ADVANTAGES 
C-7. The following are advantages of mounted CBRN R&S:

Speed. When time is limited, conducting the reconnaissance mission mounted without exiting the
vehicle provides the commander faster feedback and the capability to cover large areas. Vehicles
offer increased mobility in open terrain. Mounted reconnaissance may be conducted in high-
mobility, multipurpose wheeled vehicles or nuclear, biological, and chemical reconnaissance
vehicles. Remaining mounted allows the R&S element to conduct detailed CBRN reconnaissance
at a speed greater than dismounted CBRN R&S could achieve.

Protection. Vehicles provide the R&S element additional protection from CBRN and
conventional hazards. These advantages depend on the specific vehicle employed. Reconnaissance
vehicles may include the following:

Armor protection.

Enhanced navigation and communications capability.

Enhanced optics providing stand-off detection before entering contamination.

Firepower to defeat light-skinned armor vehicles and some infantry fighting vehicles.

Vehicle collective protection.

Meteorological data.
DISADVANTAGES 
C-8. The following are disadvantages of mounted CBRN R&S:

Loss of stealth due to the visual, noise, and thermal signatures of vehicles.

Loss of accuracy to pinpoint actual contamination.

Higher probability of false positives.

Higher probability of false negatives.

Decontamination requirements for personnel and vehicles.

CBRN reconnaissance vehicles are often not equipped with dismounted reconnaissance
capabilities for buildings or other places not accessible by vehicles.
COORDINATION 
C-9. Coordination with other elements is critical to making the mission successful. Capabilities such as
security, decontamination, sample transfer (when required) and transport, and communications can all play
an important role in the success of a mounted CBRN reconnaissance mission. More information about
coordination with security, including link-up points, passage of lines, and other planning requirements, are
described in Chapter 4. Coordinate for contingencies, such as encountering hazards (IEDs) and medical

evacuation. CBRN R&S crews should also know and understand the personnel recovery escape and evasion 
plan, casualty evacuation plan, and vehicle recovery plan in case their equipment is disabled in a combat 
environment.  
EQUIPMENT PREPARATION 
C-10. Effective identification of key equipment to perform the mounted CBRN reconnaissance mission is
critical to the success of the CBRN R&S operation. Examples of equipment preparation considerations
include—

Weapon calibration, lubrication, head space, and timing.

Ammunition distribution.

Tie-down vehicle antennas.

Night-vision system checks.

Cleaning all optic lenses and sensor detection surfaces.

Equipment preparation (for example, performing preventive maintenance checks and services on
CBRN R&S platforms and calibrations on CBRN sensors).

Proper and complete protective equipment.

Air filters for vehicles.

A sufficient supply of sample collection equipment, assays, detection equipment, and
decontamination supplies.

Adequate medical countermeasures (such as having antidote treatment nerve agent autoinjectors).
C-11. The commander determines if a CBRN R&S element is prepared for its mission. The commander bases
the decision to employ the element on the level of acceptable risk. Rarely is an element completely prepared
for every aspect of a mission. If any perceived risks that exist are acceptable to the commander, the mission
should be executed.
EXECUTING MOUNTED CBRN RECONNAISSANCE OPERATIONS 
C-12. During mounted reconnaissance operations, the commander may direct a CBRN R&S element to
conduct a route, zone, or area reconnaissance mission. Mounted reconnaissance generally requires more
decontamination assets to accomplish operational decontamination. Decontamination can be a resource-
intensive operation and is typically conducted in a permissive environment. The aim is to gather information
on the actual extent of the contamination to aid commanders in their decisions and to prevent U.S. and allied
forces from unknowingly entering the contaminated area. Surveys require applied judgment based on METT-
TC/METT-T. The mission, the terrain, and the adversary dictate which survey technique should be used. The
detection equipment used to conduct surveys varies based on the CBRN threat or hazard. Equipment and
system operating instructions are found in applicable operator, crew service, and technical publications. A
complete survey occurs when the entire extent of the contamination has been identified. An incomplete
survey occurs when the entire extent of the contamination has not been identified, such as when a survey to
find a bypass route is conducted.
C-13. Executing mounted CBRN R&S operations should be conducted in a deliberate and controlled manner
to ensure safety and success of the mission. Table C-1, page C-4, provides an example of some procedures
associated with executing mounted CBRN R&S operations. These steps are divided into phases for ease in
understanding and, eventually, execution.
Note. Not all of the steps and supporting tasks in table C-1 are required in support of CBRN R&S 
procedures.

INTEGRATE WITH MANEUVER UNITS 
C-14. Before mounted CBRN R&S operations, the CBRN unit should integrate with the supported maneuver
unit. Mounted CBRN R&S supports the offense, defense, and stability operations by increasing the supported 
force capability of early warning of CBRN attacks and by facilitating rapid decision making by the
commander to exploit opportunities in CBRN environments at tempo. Because CBRN units do not own or
manage operational areas, mounted CBRN R&S elements must coordinate all activities with the headquarters
that manages the operational area in which they conduct missions. This ensures that the mounted CBRN R&S
asset is supporting the unit scheme of maneuver and prevents fratricide from friendly fires.
C-15. Integration should begin with the troop-leading procedures as soon as the mounted CBRN R&S
leadership receives the mission. Contact and frequent communication with the gaining headquarters are
critical to mission success. Before necessary movement to the gaining headquarters, the mounted CBRN
R&S leadership should know the route, unit boundaries, radio frequencies, digital communications linkages,
enemy disposition in operational areas, friendly unit locations/actions, and link-up points to ensure a
successful link-up with the supported unit. When tactical movement is complete and link-up is achieved, the
mounted CBRN R&S leadership refine the plan with essential information from the gaining unit.

leadership determines the CBRN R&S techniques and tactics that support the commander’s desired end state. 
If time is available, the CBRN R&S leadership should back brief the supported unit commander on how they 
will support the scheme of maneuver and attend rehearsals of concept drills. If not already completed, the 
mounted CBRN R&S leadership issues the final order; conducts rehearsals of actions on the objective; and 
reviews the reconnaissance objective, engagement criteria, communications PACE plan, personnel recovery 
plan, casualty evacuation, and decontamination plans. 
C-17. Throughout maneuvers, the mounted CBRN R&S element may integrate tactical formations with other
units. For example, if supporting a cavalry or armored task force, the mounted CBRN R&S element would
integrate into their respective tactical formation where they can best provide early warning of CBRN attacks.
Examples of integration with maneuver formations are displayed in figures C-5 and C-6, pages C-10 and
C-11, and figure C-7, pages C-11.  Leader-to-leader cross talk, planning, and rehearsals through battle drills
are critical to successful integration. Not every leader understands the capabilities of mounted CBRN
elements. It is highly encouraged to provide clarity on the mounted CBRN R&S platforms capabilities,
limitations, and best employment tactics to create unity of effort.
C-18. The mounted CBRN R&S element are required to integrate into the supported unit PACE plan;
therefore, communication is critical to mission success. The mounted CBRN R&S leadership should have
the frequencies and call signs of surrounding units. The CBRN R&S asset should also be synchronized with
the maneuver unit communications network to support integration, early warning, and mission agility if the
supported commander requires dynamic tasking of the mounted CBRN R&S elements.
SUPPORT MANEUVER DURING DECISIVE ACTION 
C-19. During security operations, mounted CBRN R&S elements use LP/OPs to protect against enemy
observation and engagement. The mounted CBRN R&S leadership should identify primary, alternate, and
tertiary fighting positions because the unit may be required to move backward to break contact with enemy
forces. Egress routes should be established, maximizing cover and concealment from enemy locations during
displacement. Maneuver commanders should understand that the employment of mounted CBRN R&S
elements is an informed, risk-based decision that may incur the loss of a critical asset if placed in a vulnerable
position.
C-20. To support the commander, mounted CBRN R&S elements maximize their capability to maneuver and
use the terrain to their advantage. Intervisibility lines, low ground, and cover and concealment are used to
minimize the mounted CBRN R&S element signature. Mounted CBRN vehicle crews engage targets from
hull defilade positions, using weapons systems to identify and engage enemy systems. Mounted CBRN R&S
elements use vegetation and camouflage to break up their silhouette to enemy targeting. Vehicle antennas are
tied down to prevent enemy observation in hide positions. The light line delineates where light discipline is
enforced, and all elements will begin using night vision systems. Noise discipline is also mitigated using
short count procedures during the start-up and shutdown of vehicle engines. Radio and electronic
communications are minimized to prevent enemy identification. CBRN R&S leadership may communicate
using hand and arm signals or flag systems to minimize electronic signatures.
C-21. Supported maneuver elements and mounted CBRN R&S elements should cross coordinate engagement 
areas with interlocking sectors of fire and target reference points. Mounted CBRN R&S units fight in tandem
with, and complementary to, other maneuver forces. To maintain security, CBRN R&S capabilities execute
missions within the maximum effective range (supporting range) of adjacent maneuver elements. Mounted
CBRN R&S leaders must also be able to call for fire and coordinate for close air support to protect
themselves.
C-22. During offensive operations, mounted CBRN R&S units blend capabilities with maneuver unit
formations to screen the flanks of larger maneuver formations, support the decisive operation along an axis
of attack, or conduct route reconnaissance along ground lines of communication. Mounted CBRN elements
are best placed where the commander anticipates enemy CBRN attacks to deny key terrain. When the enemy
force employs CBRN, the mounted CBRN R&S element rapidly develops the commander’s hazard
awareness and understanding, providing an exploitable route through or around contamination and exposing
assailable enemy flanks. Mounted CBRN reconnaissance forces are also capable of conducting small-scale
offensive tasks against Level II threats (small tactical units) and nonarmored bypassed forces in rear areas.
Appendix C 
C-6

31 March 2021 
C-23. In the defense, mounted CBRN reconnaissance forces can conduct limited defensive tasks to provide
early warning of enemy attacks, fight to gain time, and provide bypass routes to maintain force sustainment.
During defensive operations, mounted CBRN R&S elements maximize stand-off distances, engaging enemy
formations to bait them into friendly engagement areas. When the engaged enemy formation is lured into the
engagement area, armor, cavalry, and infantry forces defeat the enemy.
C-24. Throughout decisive action, mounted CBRN reconnaissance elements in LPs/OPs detect the enemy
and use fire support channels to direct engagement of the enemy at maximum range. This helps the unit at
the LP/OP avoid detection and prevents the enemy from penetrating screen lines. As part of the security
force, mounted CBRN R&S elements must be able to call for fire support and close air support to defeat
enemy assets.
CONDUCT CBRN SURVEY 
C-25. During potential CBRN attacks, mounted CBRN R&S capabilities provide an idea of where CBRN
contamination may be based on staff-generated, projected downwind hazard plumes and existing warning
and reporting data. Conducting an area reconnaissance and survey of detected contamination provides the
JFC a more realistic hazard awareness and understanding of the extent of contamination.
C-26. The key tasks accomplished during the CBRN survey are listed below in priority order:

Establish security for the CBRN R&S element.

Detect and identify CBRN contamination.

Locate the general boundaries of the contaminated area.

Place warning markers at specified intervals around the contaminated area and along bypass
routes.

Report information by using the CBRN 4 report.

Perform necessary decontamination.
C-27. The initial area survey could be a relatively rapid task or a more prolonged task, depending on the size
and complexity of the area. Decisions can be made regarding the appropriate level of IPE/PPE for follow-on
R&S elements collecting samples or conducting presumptive or field confirmatory identification.
C-28. During the CBRN survey, the mounted CBRN R&S element uses the survey techniques described in
paragraph C-56 and marks the contaminated area according to unit SOPs. Markings should clearly delineate
contaminated terrain from uncontaminated terrain and should be recognizable for other units while in IPE
and overpressure. Marking contaminated grid locations (via a Global Positioning System) and potential
bypass routes should be communicated to the supported commander. The CBRN 4 report format described
in TM 3-11.32/MCRP 10-10E.5/NTTP 3-11.25/AFTTP 3-2.56 should be used to communicate the extent of
contamination and bypass criteria.
C-29. If the situation is permissive and the CBRN R&S element is supported by a decontamination unit, a
decontamination operation should be undertaken based on the extent of contamination on the vehicles. This
limits the possible spread of contamination and negates the need for further decontamination operations.
CONDUCT SAMPLE COLLECTION (IF REQUIRED) 
C-30. The mounted CBRN R&S element conducts sampling operations, as required. For more information
on sample collection, refer to Chapter 6 of this manual.
RECOVERY 
C-31. Upon completion of sampling operations, the mounted CBRN R&S element conducts decontamination
operations to the extent required to minimize the risk of spreading contamination while balancing the tactical
risk of enemy forces in the vicinity. CBRN R&S forces may displace to a secured fighting position before
decontamination or may even be withdrawn from forward positions to undertake thorough decontamination
operations, if necessary. It is important that the CBRN R&S leader communicate the hazard to friendly forces
if the CBRN R&S element is suspected to be contaminated. The CBRN R&S element may also have to find
a nonprimary, dirty route to take that mitigates the spread of contamination.

C-7
C-32. When required decontamination is complete, the CBRN R&S element may proceed to an assembly
area and conduct postoperation preventive maintenance check and services. Upon completion of
reconstitution and rearming, the mounted CBRN R&S element notifies the supported commander of their
status and reintegrates with maneuver elements, as required.
MOUNTED CBRN RECONNAISSANCE TACTICAL FORMATIONS 
C-33. The CBRN R&S element uses the most standard movement formations and techniques, consistent with
ATP 3-20.98, to conduct tactical maneuver. Once at the mission area, the R&S element selects the appropriate 
CBRN survey technique (such as box or star) to perform its mission. CBRN reconnaissance leaders must
exercise C2, maximize the use of terrain, and apply the following fundamentals of movement:

Move on covered and concealed routes.

Do not move directly forward from covered and concealed positions.

Avoid likely ambush sites and other danger areas.

Enforce camouflage, noise, and light discipline.

Maintain all-around security, including air guards.

Use terrain for protection.

Avoid possible kill zones.

Maximize vehicle capabilities, such as collective protection and standoff detections systems.
C-34. The flexible mounted reconnaissance platoon formations are: line, Vee, column, staggered column,
wedge, echelon (left or right), coil, and herringbone. The selection of a ground movement technique is
primarily based on terrain considerations and the likelihood of adversary contact. In large-scale ground
combat, CBRN R&S elements integrate for security with larger combat arms formations. The CBRN R&S
element mutually supports the task force or company team, providing early warning and facilitating
immediate tactical decisions in a contested CBRN environment. The following tactical ground movement
techniques provide a standard method of movement, but the CBRN R&S element must use unit SOPs and
common sense in employing these techniques as they perform their missions and encounter different
situations. The following rules apply to military personnel on foot and/or to vehicle crews using terrain for
protection:

Do not silhouette against the skyline; use intervisibility lines to conceal maneuver.

Cross open areas quickly, with overwatch provided from other security elements.

Maximize the use of cover and concealment; use low ground, prepared fighting positions, and
secured routes as much as possible.

Do not move directly forward from a concealed firing position.

Avoid possible enemy engagement areas because it is easier to cross difficult terrain than fight the
adversary on unfavorable terms.

Avoid large, open areas, especially when they are dominated by high ground or by terrain that can
cover and conceal the adversary.

Use countermeasures, such as smoke and direct and indirect fire, to suppress or obscure suspected
adversary positions.
C-35. Regardless of which technique is used, the leader provides the CBRN R&S element an order explaining 
what each member of the element will do. This becomes more critical as the likelihood of adversary contact
increases. If possible, the CBRN R&S element leader should provide his element with the following
information:

The adversary situation as he knows or suspects it to be.

The route or axis to be used and which vehicle will be the lead vehicle.

used).

What the overwatch does after the bounding element gets to the next position.
LINE 
C-36. The line formation (see figure C-1) is applicable to most mounted platoon missions. It allows maximum
reconnaissance forward and covers a wider AO. It requires the platoon to have some form of overwatch
because vehicles only provide local security.
Figure C-1. Line formation 
VEE FORMATION 
C-37. The Vee formation (see figure C-2) affords good security, speed, and C2. This formation is used when
contact is possible, but the unit must maneuver around canalizing terrain (such as hills, heavily wooded areas,
and ridges) with speed. The lead of the Vee should be the more armored protected and lethal element, with
the R&S element following in support. Both sides of the Vee move along covered and concealed routes for
protection. The trail element provides observation of both sides of the Vee, allowing for greater C2 and
overwatch of the forward elements. In the event of overwhelming enemy contact, the trail element establishes
a base of fire, drawing fire away from the lead element, while the lead Vee element tactically withdraws from
enemy engagement capabilities. The trail element of the Vee should always maintain visual contact with the
lead element and may stop periodically to observe.

C-9
COLUMN 
C-38. The column formation (see figure C-3) is used for rapid movement when time is limited; however, it
offers good fields of fire to the flanks but little to the front and rear. This formation is primarily used when
no adversary contact is expected and time is critical. The column formation is used for road marches, for
reconnaissance movement during limited visibility, and when passing through defiles or other restrictive
terrain. The unit can deploy rapidly from the column formation into other formations, and the column
formation simplifies control and provides good security.
Figure C-3. Column formation 
STAGGERED COLUMN 
C-39. The staggered column formation (see figure C-4) is used for rapid movement across open terrain. It
affords all-round observation and fields of fire. The unit leader positions himself to best control the unit.
Reconnaissance vehicles should maintain 25–100 meter intervals and lateral dispersion. Each vehicle
commander maintains observation of his designated sector. The exact distance between vehicles depends on
METT-TC/METT-T, weather conditions, and visibility.

WEDGE
C-40. The wedge formation (see figure C-5) is one of the most frequently used unit movement formations. It
maximizes firepower and security forward, allowing for flexibility throughout maneuver. It also facilitates
C2, particularly in the offense. Mounted CBRN R&S elements typically integrate with combat arms
formations in a wedge to mutually support one another. Vehicle dispersion and intervals depend on METT-
TC/METT-T and visibility. When spreading out in open, flat terrain, each vehicle operator must maintain
visibility of the vehicle in front of him. Each vehicle maintains observation of predetermined sectors of fire,
providing 360-degree security for the entire element. When enemy contact occurs, the lead maneuver force
may establish a base of fire. Based on tactical considerations and assumed risk, the CBRN R&S element may
support the offensive effort, providing limited firepower forward. A column of wedge formations is used
when adversary contact is possible. It is best employed when traveling or when traveling overwatch
conditions are warranted.
Figure C-5. Wedge formation 
ECHELON (LEFT OR RIGHT) 
C-41. The echelon formation (see figure C-6) provides coverage of an area. It provides flexibility and speed,
but it does not provide sufficient security if adversary contact is possible without integration with another
maneuver formation echelon. In figure C-6, the mounted CBRN R&S element is integrated with a platoon of
infantry fighting vehicles to provide sufficient protection forward while enabling the CBRN R&S elements
to provide early warning of CBRN attacks to adjacent units. Tactical dispersion is typically 25–100 meters,
but is METT-TC/METT-T-dependent.
Note. Echelon right mirrors the formation of echelon left.

COIL 
C-42. The coil formation (see figure C-7) provides 360-degree security and observation when the mounted
CBRN R&S element is stationary. It is useful for tactical refueling and resupply and when issuing element
orders. Security, including air guards and dismounted personnel, is posted during the execution of CBRN
reconnaissance tasks. The coil formation is used as follows:

When visibility is limited, the element leader forms the coil. When the coil is complete, all vehicles
stop, adjust for cover and concealment, turn 90° outward, and post security.

During daylight, or when speed is essential, the element leader signals for vehicles to move into
position and stop. All vehicles move directly to their assigned positions (as stated in the element
SOP), seek cover and concealment, and provide security with interlocking sectors of fire.

HERRINGBONE 
C-43. The herringbone formation (see figure C-8) is used to disperse the mounted CBRN R&S element when
it is traveling in a column formation. The herringbone formation may be used during air attacks, when the
element must stop during movement, or when personnel must dismount to conduct other CBRN
reconnaissance tasks. The herringbone formation allows the mounted CBRN R&S element to move to
covered and concealed positions from a road or an open area, and it establishes all-around security without
requiring detailed instructions. Vehicles are repositioned as necessary to take advantage of the best cover,
concealment, and fields of fire.
Figure C-8. Herringbone formation at the halt 
MOUNTED CBRN RECONNAISSANCE MOVEMENT TECHNIQUES 
C-44. In the conduct of most tactical missions, the CBRN R&S element moves under the mission
command/C2 of the element leader. The CBRN R&S element may use one of three movement techniques to
reach their objective—traveling, traveling overwatch, or bounding overwatch.
C-45.  The selection of a movement technique is primarily based on terrain considerations and the likelihood
of adversary contact. These techniques provide a standard method of movement, but the CBRN R&S element
must use common sense in employing these techniques as they perform their missions and encounter different
situations. The following rules apply to military personnel on foot and/or to vehicle crews using terrain for
protection:

Do not silhouette against the skyline.

Cross open areas quickly.

Do not move directly forward from a concealed firing position.

Avoid possible kill zones because it is easier to cross difficult terrain than fight the adversary on
unfavorable terms.

Avoid large, open areas, especially when they are dominated by high ground or by terrain that can
cover and conceal the adversary.

Use active countermeasures, such as smoke or direct and indirect fire, to suppress or obscure
suspected adversary positions.
TRAVELING 
C-46. The traveling technique is employed when speed is necessary and adversary contact is not likely. The
CBRN R&S element moves in a column formation, using the appropriate intervals based on visibility, terrain,
and weapons ranges. When using vehicles, the CBRN R&S element moves continuously at a maximum safe
speed. When the column stops, vehicles move into a herringbone or coil formation and dismount. The CBRN
R&S element moves along covered and concealed routes, automatically contracting and expanding based on

C-13
terrain and visibility. Local security is maintained according to the element SOP. Each vehicle posts an air 
guard. The CBRN R&S element leader locates where he can best exercise control.  
TRAVELING OVERWATCH 
C-47. The traveling overwatch technique is employed when adversary contact is likely (possible). The CBRN
R&S element moves in a column formation, using the appropriate intervals and designated lead and trail
elements. The trail CBRN R&S element moves continuously, following covered and concealed routes. When
using vehicles, the lead element is approximately 50–100 meters ahead of the trail element, depending on
terrain and vegetation. The trail CBRN R&S element moves at varying speeds, stopping as required to
overwatch the lead element. Visual contact is maintained with the lead CBRN R&S element at all times. The
trail CBRN R&S element overwatches at a distance that will allow it to fire or move to support the lead
CBRN R&S element, if necessary. In wooded areas or restricted terrain, elements reduce the speed and
intervals. In adverse weather conditions, the crew of the lead vehicle dismounts to verify route trafficability
and maneuverability, and the trail CBRN R&S element provides overwatch. The CBRN R&S element
maintains local security according to the element SOP.
BOUNDING OVERWATCH 
C-48. The bounding overwatch technique is employed when adversary contact is expected. The intent of this
technique is for the element to deploy before contact, giving it the ability to protect the bounding CBRN R&S
element by immediately suppressing an adversary force. Considerations when using bounding overwatch
include the following:

The staggered column formation is the standard movement formation.

When using the bounding overwatch technique, the overwatch element is assigned sectors to scan.
The lead CBRN R&S element bounds forward, following a covered and concealed route.

The bounding CBRN R&S element should avoid masking the direct fires of the overwatch CBRN
R&S element, and it must not move beyond the effective supporting range of the overwatch CBRN
R&S element. The bounding CBRN R&S element may be a single element or multiple CBRN
R&S elements.

The overwatching CBRN R&S element covers the progress of the bounding element from covered
and concealed positions, offering observation and fields of fire against suspected adversary
positions.

Visual contact is maintained at all times. The length of a bound is based on terrain analysis and
the ranges and fields of fire from the overwatching vehicles.

When cresting a hill, entering an open area, exiting a defile, or moving through restrictive terrain,
a crewmember dismounts from the vehicle. He moves forward on foot to a point from which he
can observe all suspected and likely adversary firing positions.

The CBRN R&S element maintains local security according to the element SOP.
C-49. Regardless of which technique is used, the leader gives the CBRN R&S element an order explaining
what each member of the element will do. This becomes more critical as the likelihood of adversary contact
increases. If possible, the CBRN R&S element leader should provide his element with the following
information:

The adversary situation as he knows or suspects it to be.

The next overwatch position (the objective for the bounding element).

The route of the bounding element to that position.

What the overwatch does after the bounding element gets to the next position.

MOUNTED LOCATE TECHNIQUES 
C-50. CBRN locate techniques are conducted to locate suspected or actual CBRN agents or hazards from an
attack within the AOR. CBRN locate is conducted on a continuous basis to detect hazards along routes, in
areas, or in selected zones or sectors of interest. Locate techniques can use standoff or unmanned capabilities
to find contaminated areas. CBRN locate techniques require applied judgment based on METT-TC/METT-
T. The terrain and the adversary dictate which technique to use and the level of detail possible. More than
one technique may be executed during a single mission.
C-51. The CBRN R&S element chooses the mounted technique best suited to the terrain and mission
objectives. Mounted CBRN reconnaissance techniques provide advantages and disadvantages. Table C-2
provides an overview of those advantages and disadvantages.

ZIGZAG 
C-52. The zigzag locate technique (see figure C-9) is used to locate contaminated areas during route, zone,
or area reconnaissance missions. Depending on the terrain, the distances could be large or small. The zigzag
technique may not be appropriate in urban areas. The zigzag locate technique has a higher probability of
detecting contamination because the surface area not traversed by the R&S element is less than that of other
locate techniques. The following are procedures for the zigzag locate technique:

At the LD (mission start location), R&S elements come on line 200 meters apart and verify that
there is no presence of ground contamination via point monitoring.

The R&S elements start a parallel course toward the suspected contamination based on METT-T
at a 45° angle to the left if the mission begins on the left flank area of concern boundary, or at a
45° angle to the right if the mission begins on the right flank area of concern boundary.

The R&S elements move 500 meters along the first leg (zig). Upon completion of the first leg,
elements turn 90° away from their direction of travel, remain on a parallel course, maintain a 200-
meter interval, and complete the second leg (zag).
Note. The length of the zigzag legs can increase or decrease based on METT-T. 

When the R&S elements reach the LOA without finding contamination, both elements stop; the
outer element bounds 200 meters around the inner element, toward the area of concern, and stops
on line with the inner element at 180° from the inner vehicle’s heading. Once the outer element is
set in place, the inner element conducts the same bounding procedures. Both elements proceed in
their direction of travel, continuing the process until the entire area of concern is covered or
contamination is detected.

Once ground contamination is detected by an R&S element, the other element stops and checks
for ground contamination at their current location via point monitoring. The element that detected
contamination conducts sample collection as required and sends a CBRN 4 report to higher
headquarters.

The R&S elements transition from the zigzag locate technique to the appropriate survey technique.
Note. Figure C-9 depicts a two-R&S element concept, but the zigzag locate technique can be 
executed with any number of vehicles based on their availability and the size of the area to be 
reconnoitered.

LANE 
C-53. The lane locate technique (see figure C-10, page C-16) is used to locate contaminated areas. It is very
similar to the zigzag locate technique, but it is primarily used during CBRN route reconnaissance missions.
It can also be used for area reconnaissance of long, narrow pieces of terrain, such as defiles. The lane locate
technique allows the CBRN R&S element to use roadways that are generally parallel. The following are
procedures for the lane locate technique:

At the LD (mission start location), R&S elements come on line 200 meters apart and verify that
there is no presence of ground contamination via point monitoring.

The R&S elements start a parallel course toward the suspected contamination based on METT-T.

When the R&S elements reach the LOA without finding contamination, both elements stop; the
outer element bounds 200 meters around the inner element, toward the area of concern, and stops
on line with the inner element facing the original start location (180°). Once the outer element is
set in place, the inner element conducts the same bounding procedures. Both elements proceed in
their direction of travel, continuing the process until the entire area of concern is covered or
contamination is detected.

Once ground contamination is detected by an R&S element, the other element stops and checks
for ground contamination at their current location via point monitoring. The element that detected
contamination conducts sample collection as required and then sends a CBRN 4 report to higher
headquarters.

The R&S elements transition from the lane locate technique to the appropriate survey technique.
Note. Figure C-10 depicts a two-R&S element concept, but the zigzag locate technique can be 
executed with any number of vehicles based on their availability and the size of the area to be 
reconnoitered.

CLOVERLEAF 
C-54. The cloverleaf locate technique (see figure C-11) is primarily used in restricted access or terrain or so
that sites for high-value facilities (command and control centers) are free of contamination. The cloverleaf
locate technique is time-consuming; however, it provides detailed coverage and information about an area.
The following are procedures for the cloverleaf locate technique:

The R&S element begins its cloverleaf at a starting point of the area of concern. This location can
be identified by an existing feature (such as a tree, bush, large rock, hill, or structure) or a reference
marker placed by the R&S element.

At the reference start location, the R&S element verifies that there is no presence of ground
contamination via point monitoring.

Using the reference as the center of the figure 8, the element moves in a figure 8 pattern while
conducting point monitoring every 50–200 meters, based on METT-T. Once the element
completes one figure 8 pattern, it continues to use the reference as the center and conducts a second
figure 8 pattern that is perpendicular to the first pattern.

If the entire area of concern was not covered, the R&S element conducts a subsequent cloverleaf
locate technique.

Once ground contamination is detected by the R&S element via point detection, the element
conducts sample collection as required and then sends a CBRN 4 report to higher headquarters.

The R&S element transitions from the cloverleaf locate technique to the appropriate survey
technique.
Note. Figure C-11 depicts one R&S element, but the cloverleaf locate technique can be executed 
with two elements, with each element conducting one of the figure 8 patterns.

GRID 
C-55. The grid locate technique (see figure C-12) is employed by R&S elements conducting mounted
reconnaissance, when accuracy is most important. It is employed by superimposing a grid overlay on a map
of an area of concern, which enables rapid communication of detection locations, sample collection locations,
and casualty locations. Numbers and/or letters are assigned to each detection location 100–500 meters apart
in a uniformed pattern that is associated with predetermined grid locations. The following are procedures for
the grid locate technique:

The R&S elements coordinate grid boundaries and predetermined locations to be assessed for
contamination with the supported command.

The R&S elements conduct point monitoring at numbered/lettered detection locations assigned by 
the command.

Once ground contamination is detected via point monitoring, elements conduct sample collection
as required and then send CBRN 4 reports to higher headquarters.

R&S elements notify the command of verified, noncontaminated casualty locations, as required.

The R&S element transitions from the grid locate technique to the appropriate survey technique.

MOUNTED SURVEY TASKS 
C-56. CBRN surveys define the boundaries of contaminated areas. CBRN surveys require applied judgment
based on METT-TC/METT-T. The mission, terrain, time, and adversary situation indicate the technique that
should be used. There are six survey techniques that can be employed once the contamination is located—
nearside-farside, box, star, bounce-and-bypass, course leg, and preselected dose rate.
C-57. CBRN survey techniques can be conducted by mounted or dismounted R&S elements. The distances
suggested for each technique vary depending on METT-TC/METT-T.
NEARSIDE-FARSIDE 
C-58. The nearside-farside survey technique (see figure C-13) is used by R&S elements to quickly determine
the nearside and farside boundaries (length/depth) of a contaminated area, but the left and right limits (width)

of contamination are not identified. This technique gets the R&S element in and out of the contaminated area 
in the shortest possible time. Based on command requirements and METT-T, R&S elements can shift to the 
left or right to determine the left/right side boundaries (width) of a contaminated area. The lateral spacing 
between R&S elements is important to quickly locate the boundaries of the contaminated area. Once the 
boundaries are located, clear bypass routes can be easily established. This survey technique is also used to 
determine the nearside, farside, and adjacent boundaries for routes. The following are procedures for the 
nearside-farside survey technique: 

The process starts once the R&S element detects the presence of ground contamination.

Upon detection of ground contamination, the element conducts sample collection as required and
then sends a CBRN 4 report to higher headquarters.

The element backs up 200 meters and checks for ground contamination via point monitoring. If
the result is a negative detection, the element backs up another 200 meters and checks for ground
contamination via point monitoring.

If the result is a negative detection, the element drops a CBRN warning marker to indicate the
nearside line and then sends a CBRN 4 marker report to higher headquarters.

The element moves forward and finds the farside of the contamination, checking for ground
contamination every 200 meters via point monitoring.

When the element obtains two consecutive negative detections (400 meters), the element drops a
CBRN warning marker to indicate the farside line and then sends a CBRN 4 marker report to
higher headquarters.

The element has completed the nearside-farside survey technique given a requirement to find the
left and right boundaries.

The element determines the left and right boundaries by replicating the same procedures as for the
nearside-farside across the width of the area of concern, approaching from either the left or the
right side. (METT-T-dependent.)
Note. Figure C-13 depicts a one-element (vehicle) execution. When more than one element is 
used, spacing between elements is 200 meters, and actions are conducted concurrently.

BOX 
C-59. The box survey technique is used to determine the general dimensions (length and width) of a
contaminated area and to provide detailed information on the extent of ground contamination, but it is very
time-consuming. At the LD (mission start location), R&S elements come on line 200 meters apart and verify
that there is no presence of ground contamination via point detection. The R&S elements start a parallel
course toward the suspected contamination by using the appropriate location technique (land, zig-zag, grid)
based on METT-T. If the length of the reconnaissance area is covered without finding contamination, each
R&S element increases the distance between vehicles by 200 meters and then returns toward the original start
location. This process continues until the entire area of concern is covered or contamination is detected. Once
contamination is detected, the R&S elements transition from the locate technique to the box survey technique.
Three-Element Survey 
C-60. Using three vehicles (see figure C-14) requires the least amount of time to complete the survey process
(dependent on vehicle availability).

The process begins once an R&S element detects the presence of ground contamination. When
ground contamination is detected by an element, the other two elements stop and check for ground
contamination at their current location via point monitoring. The element that detected
contamination is the base element.

The base element conducts sample collection as required and then sends a CBRN 4 report to higher 
headquarters. If the other two elements did not detect the presence of contamination, they orient
200 meters to the left/right and on line with the base element, as appropriate. If another element
detected contamination, they must back out of the contamination prior to orienting to the left/right
of the base element.
Notes. 
1. Element actions are identified independently, but they are conducted concurrently. Figure C-14
identifies the center element as detecting initial contamination; therefore, they are the base
element. The base element, right side element, and left side element procedures describe the
actions depicted in figure C-14.
2. Elements drop CBRN warning markers and then send CBRN 4 marker reports to higher
headquarters at each negative detection location.

C-61. The base element establishes the initial nearside and initial farside lines.

Upon detection of ground contamination, the element confirms via point monitoring (unless
already using this protocol), conducts sample collection as required, and sends a CBRN 4 report
to higher headquarters.

The element backs up 200 meters and checks for ground contamination via point monitoring. If
the result is a negative detection, the element drops a CBRN warning marker to indicate the initial
nearside line and then sends a CBRN 4 marker report to higher headquarters.

The element moves forward and finds the farside of the contamination, checking for ground
contamination every 200 meters via point monitoring, dropping CBRN warning markers, and
sending CBRN 4 marker reports to higher headquarters at each negative detection location. When
the element obtains two consecutive negative detections (400 meters), the element drops a CBRN
warning marker to indicate the initial farside line, sends a CBRN 4 marker report to higher
headquarters, and provides overwatch for the other R&S elements.
Right Side Element 
C-62. The element turns right for positive detections or left for negative detections (except for the first CBRN
marker drop. The element makes directional left turns toward the contamination. Upon three consecutive
negative detections (400 meters), if the element is moving toward the farside, they will not make directional
left-hand turns; they will continue forward toward the farside. For consecutive positive detections that direct
an element to a previously checked location, the element continues forward in lieu of turning right.

When the base element detects contamination, the element stops and checks for ground
contamination at their current location via point monitoring. (The element may have had to orient
to the right of the base element.)

Upon verification of a negative detection, the element drops a CBRN warning marker, sends a

area of concern, they continue to move forward, checking for ground contamination every 200
meters via point monitoring. The element drops CBRN warning markers and sends CBRN 4
marker reports to higher headquarters at each negative detection location until they reach the initial 
farside line.

Once the element has reached the initial farside line, the element turns left toward the base element, 
continuing to check for ground contamination every 200 meters via point monitoring, dropping
CBRN 4 warning markers and sending CBRN 4 marker reports to higher headquarters at each
negative detection location until they are within 200 meters of the base element.

The base element comes on line within 200 meters of the right side element.

If the element surveys the entirety of the area of concern, the right side LOA is defined and element 
actions are complete. If there is remaining terrain to survey, the element must continue survey
actions to discern if an adjustment to the right side LOA is required.
Notes. 
1. If contamination takes the left side element past either the initial nearside or initial farisde lines,
the process continues until contamination boundaries are defined and the result is an adjusted
nearside line and/or adjusted farside line.

right turns; they will continue forward toward the farside. For consecutive positive detections that direct an

STAR 
C-68. The star survey technique (see figure C-17) is a quick way to determine the rough limits of a
contaminated area. The star technique is used to obtain contamination limits while providing commanders
optimal time to make tactical decisions necessary for their operational execution and success. This technique
can be used by two or more R&S elements to obtain more detecting points, increasing the accuracy of the
survey. The following are procedures for the star survey technique:

The process starts once the R&S element detects the presence of ground contamination.

Upon detection of ground contamination, the element confirms via point monitoring (unless
already using this protocol), conducts sample collection as required, and sends a CBRN 4 report
to higher headquarters.

The element backs up 200 meters and checks for ground contamination via point monitoring. If
the result is a negative detection, the element backs up another 200 meters and checks for ground
contamination via point monitoring.

If the result is a negative detection, the element drops a CBRN warning marker to indicate the
base (starting location of the star) and sends a CBRN 4 marker report to higher headquarters.

The element moves forward, checking for ground contamination every 200 meters via point
monitoring.

When the element obtains two consecutive negative detections (400 meters), the element drops a
CBRN warning marker to indicate the first leg of the star and sends a CBRN 4 marker report to
higher headquarters.
Note. If no additional contamination is detected along the first leg, subsequent legs must be at least 
the length of the first leg. 

Based on METT-T, the element turns +/-135° of current heading orienting on the dropped CBRN
warning marker and moves forward, checking for ground contamination every 200 meters via
point monitoring.

Note. Whichever direction (+/-135°) the element turns based on METT-T, all subsequent turns for 
the legs of the star must be in the same direction. (Direction movements must be consistent for the 
survey process to work correctly.) 

When the element obtains two consecutive negative detections (400 meters), the element drops a
CBRN warning marker to indicate the second leg of the star and sends a CBRN 4 marker report
to higher headquarters.

The element turns +/-135° of current heading orienting on the dropped CBRN warning marker
and moves forward, checking for ground contamination every 200 meters via point monitoring.

When the element obtains two consecutive negative detections (400 meters), the element drops a
CBRN warning marker to indicate the third leg of the star and sends a CBRN 4 marker report to
higher headquarters.

The element turns +/-135° of current heading orienting on the dropped CBRN warning marker
and moves forward, checking for ground contamination every 200 meters via point monitoring.



The element turns +/-135° of current heading orienting on the dropped CBRN warning marker
and moves forward, checking for ground contamination every 200 meters via point monitoring.
Note. If the process is conducted correctly, the element will be headed in the direction of the base 
(starting location of the star). 

When the element obtains two consecutive negative detections (400 meters), the element drops a
CBRN warning marker to indicate the completion of the star and sends a CBRN 4 marker report
to higher headquarters.
Notes. 
1. Based on contamination, the element may drop a sixth CBRN warning marker and send a CBRN 
4 marker report to higher headquarters. If the second negative detection in within 200 meters of
the base CBRN warning marker, there is no requirement for additional CBRN warning markers
or CBRN 4 reports. Once the element is within 200 meters of the base CBRN marker, it is
considered a complete survey.
2. Figure C-16 identifies a one-element (vehicle) execution. When the area of concern exceeds the
capabilities of one element, additional elements can execute concurrent stars where this technique
is used to obtain more detection points, increasing the accuracy of the survey.

BOUNCE-AND-BYPASS 
C-69. The bounce-and-bypass survey technique (see figure C-18) is used to locate the general boundaries of
a CBRN contaminated area. The R&S element places CBRN markers at specified intervals around the
contaminated area and at all entry points. This technique can also be used to support a radiological survey.
The R&S element reports the intensity of radiation at the contamination boundary. The following are
procedures for the bounce-and-bypass survey technique:

The R&S element stops and checks for contamination in their immediate area.

If no contamination is detected, the R&S element proceeds forward, checking for contamination
every 50 meters.

Once contamination is detected, the R&S element proceeds out of the contaminated area, checking
for contamination every 50 meters and placing a CBRN marker 50 meters after no contamination
is detected.

The R&S element then turns in the cardinal direction toward the contaminated area, checking for
contamination every 50 meters until contamination is detected again.

Once contamination is detected, the R&S element proceeds out of the contaminated area and
places a CBRN marker 50 meters after no contamination is detected.

This process continues until no contamination is detected.

of a hill) to Point B (top of another hill). Readings are taken at given intervals along the route between the
two checkpoints. When conducting a mounted radiological course leg, the element must be given a turn-back
dose and turn-back dose rate. Reports of the results of mounted course leg techniques may be submitted in
various ways. Normally, a survey data sheet (DD Form 3038) is filled out and turned in to the tasking
headquarters at the end of the mission, or the data is sent via a CBRN 4 report. Figure C-19 outlines and
illustrates the course leg technique.
Note. Conducting mounted versus aerial radiological course legs results in higher radiation doses 
to personnel. 
C-71. The following are procedures for the course leg survey technique:

The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at the start point of the
course leg.

The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at each preselected
interval along the course leg. Under no circumstances should the element continue further into a
contaminated area if it reaches its turn-back dose or turn-back dose rate.

The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at the end point of the
course leg.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results by using the CBRN 4 report.

The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination and medical support, as required.

The CBRN R&S element rechecks and zeros the RADIAC meter before each course leg to ensure
proper operation.

PRESELECTED DOSE RATE 
C-72. The preselected dose rate technique (see figure C-20) is used as a form of route technique when the
R&S element is sent along a route and told to report and/or mark at preselected dose rates. This is used for
radiological surveys and, once multiple preselected dose routes have been conducted, the points can be
correlated to show the contour lines of radiological contamination fallout.

MOUNTED CBRN SURVEILLANCE 
C-73. Reconnaissance is the first step in CBRN surveillance site selection. Begin with a map reconnaissance.
Use the map reconnaissance to determine initial surveillance areas that support the employment tactic, and
then select primary, alternate, and supplemental surveillance sites within each surveillance area. Some rules
of thumb for the reconnaissance include—

Reconnoiter the detection and surveillance areas and potential sites firsthand, if possible.

Coordinate with the terrain owner before conducting the reconnaissance.

Ensure that the CBRN R&S element includes the designated serial leaders, including—

OP site selection. The supported unit leader or CBRN R&S element leader selects the general
location for the OP. The leader considers METT-TC/METT-T factors and the information
collection plan when determining the general positioning of the OP site.

Attack indicators. Agents can be disseminated by using overt or covert methods. Explosive
delivery systems or spray tanks (artillery, rockets, and detonating missiles) have a distinctive
visual signature during the day and at night. Aircraft spraying agents have distinctive flight
patterns and a signature of the liquid being released. While these indicators are not positive
proof that an attack has occurred, they indicate an increased probability that it has. Depending
on METT-TC/METT-T, the CBRN R&S element occupying the OP can survey the NAI to
confirm or deny the presence of contamination.

C-74. CBRN surveillance is the systematic observation of aerospace, surface, and subsurface areas, places,
persons, and things by visual, aural, electronic, or other means to detect CBRN incidents and hazards. The
key tasks for CBRN surveillance are—observe, monitor, detect, identify, and report. Detailed information on
sample collection is located in Chapter 6 and on reporting information in Chapter 7. CBRN R&S elements
monitor their areas directly or indirectly by using detection capabilities to provide early warning. CBRN
R&S elements, when given the mission to perform CBRN surveillance, observe specified areas for
indications of CBRN incidents. This can be accomplished through direct visual means or the use of sensor
and standoff capabilities.
C-75. All units are trained to perform CBRN surveillance operations (for example, detector emplacement
within the unit perimeter). They can also be given the mission to perform CBRN surveillance by observing
specified areas, such as NAIs, for indications of an attack. The goal of CBRN surveillance operations is to
report information accurately and rapidly, including answering the requirements that prompted the
surveillance operation.
C-76. CBRN surveillance can be supported by several systems equipped with umanned systems, remote
sensing, standoff chemical agent detectors, and biological point detectors that can be integrated to form a
detection network. After observing the indications of a CBRN attack during CBRN surveillance, the CBRN
R&S element has the following options:

Locate and mark clear bypass routes.

Terminate the mission, and move to the coordinated decontamination point.

Continue the mission.

Depending on the duration of the mission, the commander must consider sustainment of the
CBRN R&S element by providing and maintaining levels of personnel and materiel required
while continuing the operation throughout its duration.

Personnel considerations include replacing individuals for extended durations or providing
food, water, and other perishables to replenish the CBRN R&S element.

Materiel considerations include the use of standoff and remote capabilities.
MOUNTED OBSERVE TECHNIQUES 
C-77. The CBRN surveillance task of observing is accomplished by two techniques: critical node and area
array.
CRITICAL NODE 
C-78. In support areas, mounted CBRN R&S elements may be assigned CBRN surveillance missions to
observe designated areas for CBRN attacks. MSRs and areas to be occupied by logistics and mission
command/C2 facilities may also be checked for CBRN hazards before their occupation. The following are
procedures for the critical-node technique:

Occupy observation points to overwatch the designated area.

Report all indications of a CBRN attack.

Employ monitoring capabilities.

Operate and perform operator maintenance on CBRN monitoring equipment.

Conduct CBRN monitoring operations.

Provide data for the completion of CBRN reports.
C-79. Mounted CBRN R&S elements observe specified areas or NAIs for indications of a CBRN attack.
Based on JIPOE/IPB and vulnerability planning, the commander prioritizes the use of available collection
assets against designated NAIs, and R&S elements employ observation and detection procedures on
designated areas for indications of an attack.
C-80. The primary means of surveillance may be from OPs. Another means of mounted CBRN surveillance
is conducted in support areas, assembly areas, and at the far and near side of gap crossings.

ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
C-33
AREA ARRAY 
C-81. An area array is established to maximize the probability of CBRN hazard detection over a large area
of interest. The primary objective is to detect a hazard upwind of the operational area of concern and to
provide the greatest potential warning to those in the hazard area. The specific architecture of the array is
designed by the CBRN staff in close coordination with operations, intelligence, and medical staffs. Refer to
Chapter 4 for more specific information on surveillance planning considerations and detector employment
tactics. The following are procedures for the area array technique:

Consider the enemy situation and capabilities, terrain, weather conditions, performance
characteristics, and quantity of CBRN detector assets.

Determine the appropriate separation distances between CBRN detectors.

Operate and perform operator maintenance on CBRN monitoring equipment.

Report all indications of a CBRN attack.

Conduct CBRN monitoring operations.

Provide data for the completion of CBRN reports.
MOUNTED MONITOR TECHNIQUES 
C-82. The CBRN surveillance task of monitoring is accomplished by two techniques: periodic and
continuous. Monitoring techniques are more commonly used for the surveillance of radiological hazards, but
they may also be used for the surveillance of chemical hazards.
PERIODIC 
C-83.  As the name implies, periodic monitoring is accomplished by employing CBRN detector assets at
predetermined intervals of time. Before an incident, the time between monitoring is determined based
primarily on the threat assessment. When intelligence estimates deem that there is a reduced likelihood of a
CBRN incident, the commander is more apt to call for periodic monitoring of the area of concern. In doing
so, CBRN resources (equipment and personnel) are conserved and power consumption (fuel and batteries) is
reduced.
C-84. Following a CBRN incident, the periodic monitoring technique may be used over an extended period
of time to determine if hazardous effects remain in the area.
CONTINUOUS 
C-85. Conversely, the continuous monitoring technique is accomplished by employing CBRN detector assets
uninterrupted over the duration of the monitoring operations. Similar to periodic monitoring, the threat
assessment is the prime determinant in deciding to apply the continuous monitoring technique. When an
incident is anticipated, continuous monitoring provides the greatest opportunity for warning the area of
concern of impending hazardous conditions.
C-86. During and immediately following a CBRN incident, the continuous monitoring technique is employed 
to note the dissipation or proliferation of the hazard area and to estimate the duration of CBRN effects.
C-87. Continuous monitoring places a much heavier burden on personnel (operators and maintainers) and
logistics (detectors, batteries, fuel). These factors should be considered and adequately coordinated
throughout the staff.

Appendix D 
Aerial Radiological Reconnaissance 
This appendix provides aerial radiological reconnaissance tactics, techniques, and 
procedures. The aerial mode of reconnaissance provides speed and added protection to 
CBRN R&S elements when conducting their mission. Aerial radiological 
reconnaissance operations support commanders and their staffs by increasing 
situational awareness as they plan, coordinate, and execute follow-on CBRN R&S 
missions. Aerial reconnaissance enhances missions by providing rapid area 
assessments, obtaining combat information about indigenous population activities and 
resources, and providing meteorological and geographical characteristics of key 
terrain. 
MANNED AERIAL RADIOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE 
D-1. There is one form used to conduct manned aerial radiological reconnaissance—the route form. There
are also two techniques used when conducting an aerial route—the course leg and preselected dose rate
techniques. The joint CBRN staff briefs the pilot and the R&S element. All information concerning the
mission (survey height, ground speed, routes, course legs, checkpoints) comes from the joint CBRN staff.
The survey team leader and the instrument operator sit beside each other to aid in communications. The
survey team leader must have communication with the pilot.
D-2. The aircraft flies to, and lands at, a specified area. The aircraft must land near the point of interest. The
monitor dismounts, proceeds to the selected point, and takes the reading by using normal ground-monitoring
procedures. When high dose rates do not permit this procedure, aerial dose rates are taken using an air-ground
correlation factor. There are two methods for obtaining the air-ground correlation factor—direct
determination and the use of standardized tables.
D-3. Direct determination is the preferred method and is accomplished as follows:

An aerial dose rate is taken at a given point and height during the survey.

The aircraft lands, and a ground dose rate is obtained at the same area.

The air-ground correlation factor is obtained by dividing the ground dose rate by the aerial dose
rate.

New data must be obtained when the height changes 15 meters or more or when ground foliage or
surface conditions vary significantly.
ROUTE 
D-4. The aircraft flies between two checkpoints, following the route of a predominant terrain feature (a road, 
riverbank, railroad track) that connects the two checkpoints. The aircraft lands only to get the air-ground
correlation factor data needed by the joint CBRN staff. The procedures are identical to those for a course leg
survey; however, a straight flight direction may or may not be required. The following are the aerial route
procedures:

Determine the appropriate level of protection.

Obtain OEG (turn-back dose and turn-back dose rate).

Reconnoiter the route, and determine locations of contaminated areas along the route.

Report all CBRN threats and hazards along the route.

31 March 2021 
COURSE LEG TECHNIQUE 
D-5. The aircraft flies a straight line between two checkpoints; for example, from point A (top of a hill) to
point B (top of another hill). The aircraft only lands to obtain the air-ground correlation factor data. The
following are the course leg procedures:

The pilot maintains (as near as possible) a constant height aboveground, a constant ground speed,
and a straight flight direction between the start and end checkpoints of each course leg.

The pilot flies the aircraft on the proper course over the start checkpoint and on a straight path to
the end checkpoint. Shortly before reaching the start checkpoint, the pilot alerts the monitor and
gives the monitor the height aboveground.

The monitor records the time and height aboveground. The monitor then rechecks and zeros the
RADIAC meter before each course leg to ensure proper operation.

The pilot gives the command “MARK” when the aircraft is directly over the start checkpoint. The
monitor reads the survey meter, records the dose rate, and begins timing preselected time intervals.

The monitor reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at each preselected time interval; for
example, every ten seconds.

The pilot alerts the monitor again when the aircraft approaches the end checkpoint. The pilot then
gives the command “MARK” when the aircraft is directly over the end checkpoint.

The monitor reads and records the final dose rate.
PRESELECTED DOSE RATE TECHNIQUE 
D-6. The R&S element looks for a given dose rate or multiple given dose rates designated by the control
center team. This technique is used for old contamination and neutron-induced radiation. For old
contamination that is greater than the time of attack (for example, (H)+48), the team moves along a route or
designated straight line in an area until it finds 1 centigray per hour and/or its designated dose rates. When
conducting a radiological preselected dose rate technique, the element must be given a turn-back dose and
turn-back dose rate. Reports of the results of preselected dose rate techniques may be submitted in various
ways. Normally, a survey data sheet (DD Form 3038) can be filled out and turned in to the tasking
headquarters at the end of the mission or the data can be sent via a CBRN 4 report. The following are
preselected dose rate technique procedures:

The pilot maintains (as near as possible) a constant height aboveground, a constant ground speed,
and a straight flight direction between the start and end checkpoints of each route.

The pilot flies the aircraft on the proper route over the start checkpoint and on a path to the end of
the checkpoint. Shortly before reaching the start checkpoint, the pilot alerts the monitor and gives
the monitor the height aboveground.

The monitor records the time and height aboveground. The monitor then rechecks and zeros the
RADIAC meter before each route to ensure proper operation.

The monitor constantly monitors the survey meter while moving along its designated route. Under
no circumstances should the element continue further into a contaminated area if it reaches its
turn-back dose or turn-back dose rate.

Upon locating a reading of 1 centigray and/or its designated dose rates, the monitor records the
dose rate and area.

The pilot alerts the monitor again when the aircraft approaches the end checkpoint. The pilot then
gives the command “MARK” when the aircraft is directly over the end checkpoint.

The monitor reads and records the final dose rate.

The CBRN R&S element reports the results, normally using a CBRN 4 report.

The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination and medical support as required.

The CBRN R&S element rechecks and zeros the RADIAC meter before each mission to assure
proper operation.

D-3
D-7. There are advantages and disadvantages of aerial reconnaissance versus ground reconnaissance for
detecting radiological threats/hazards. The following are aerial radiological survey advantages:

A large area can be surveyed quickly.

Speed and flexibility enable surveys to be conducted over large unoccupied areas, adversary
occupied areas, and areas not easily accessible to ground troops.

Surveys can be conducted of areas at which dose rates exceed the commander’s operational
exposure guide and are dangerous to ground survey parties.

Personnel are exposed to lower dose rates because of the distance the aircraft flies aboveground.

Less equipment and personnel are required.

A helicopter and a survey team can cover more terrain than ten trucks with ground survey teams.
D-8. The following are aerial radiological survey disadvantages:

Dose rate readings are not as accurate as those obtained by ground surveys.

Weather conditions, such as high winds and extreme temperatures, impact flight operations.

Dose rates for specific points on the ground are not provided by aerial surveys.

Resources must be coordinated between pilots and CBRN survey team members.

Aerial radiological surveys may impact external operations (such as artillery missions).

The availability of aviation assets are required to conduct operations.

Vulnerability to adversary fires is increased.

Terrain restrictions may impede landing to take ground readings to calculate the air-ground
correlation factor.
D-9. Once collected, aerial survey data must be processed in real time, to include data validation, spectral
analysis, and mapping, so that results can be obtained within the first few hours or sooner after landing. This
is necessary due to the time constraints for effective response in the early stages of an incident or accident.
Planning to collect and record aerial survey data includes defining survey parameters, such as the following:

Sample time.

Ground clearance.

Speed.

Line spacing on a grid map.
RECORD AND REPORT MANNED AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE 
MISSIONS 
D-10. The joint CBRN staff relies on reports to construct and update contamination overlays, including the
common operating picture. The CBRN R&S element must accurately record aerial radiological data because
it may be used as evidence of violations of treaties and agreements. The CBRN R&S element uses DD Form
3038. Examples of nuclear data sheets can be found in TM 3-11.32/MCRP 10-10E.5/NTRP 3-11.25/AFTTP

Appendix E 
Unmanned CBRN Reconnaissance and Surveillance 
As force modernization efforts develop robotics and other technologies, CBRN 
reconnaissance elements add unmanned air and ground systems that enhance 
information collection capabilities. This appendix provides unmanned CBRN R&S 
troop leading procedures. Unmanned CBRN R&S provides hazard awareness and 
understanding without directly exposing forces to contamination. During offensive 
missions, CBRN R&S elements employ unmanned capabilities to provide early 
warning. In the defense, chemical and biological standoff and remote R&S technology 
provide detection capabilities to warn commanders of an approaching chemical or 
biological aerosol or vapor cloud or enemy indirect fire delivery of CBRN in sufficient 
time to implement protective measures before the actual contamination arrives. This 
appendix discusses the considerations, employment, and functions of standoff and 
remote capabilities.  
OVERVIEW 
E-1. The use of unmanned systems does not negate the need for the human involvement of reconnaissance,
but it serves as a force multiplier and enables the speed, standoff, and accuracy of reconnaissance operations
while expanding the depth of multidomain reconnaissance. Depending on the sensors employed, robotics can
cue other robotics or troops to collect more detailed information through differing forms of contact. They can
also provide redundancy by employing various forms of contact, such as electronic and visual, to collect
information.
MISSION PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
E-2. During a zone or area reconnaissance, the CBRN reconnaissance element integrates with cavalry,
special reconnaissance, aerial, and intelligence to gain required information. During zone reconnaissance
execution, UAS may fly in advance of the reconnaissance ground element to assist in developing the
situation, increasing the tempo of reconnaissance, and reducing risk to the force. The dispersion of the
reconnaissance element, limitations of unmanned air or ground systems speed, endurance, or range and size
of the zone reconnaissance may prevent unmanned systems from covering the entire zone. As a result, the
command element focuses the unmanned system collection on specific areas where unmanned system
applications provide advantage over manned systems based on METT-TC/METT-T factors.
E-3. Mounted CBRN reconnaissance elements may use unmanned systems to conduct detection of CBRN
hazards without increasing the risk of contamination inside vehicles or exposing vehicles to enemy fires.
Unmanned CBRN reconnaissance elements may use unmanned systems to assess urban or subterranean
structures, reducing the risk to troops from CBRN threats, enemy direct fire, and IEDs while maintaining the
tempo of reconnaissance operations.
E-4. The use of CBRN sensors employed on unmanned systems can also enable a single crew or section
with supporting robotic systems to accomplish missions that would otherwise require multiple CBRN
reconnaissance elements. This capability enhancement provides flexibility to the supported maneuver
commander in developing the task organization. Manned and unmanned teaming during initial site
characterizations maximizes the capability of a reconnaissance team. A robot can be used to make initial
entry in unknown conditions, such as in a subterranean environment that may have low oxygen. Initial
readings from sensors attached to an unmanned system allow CBRN R&S teams to make IPE/PPE decisions
that minimize the impact on Service members and the mission.

EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS 
E-5. Unmanned systems provide an additional tool for accomplishing R&S missions while reducing the
risk to Service members. The equipment limitations should be considered during mission planning.
Unmanned systems can range from large vehicles that carry a sensor equivalent (or nearly equivalent) to
manned platforms down to handheld devices with limited sensor payloads or unmanned ground sensors.
E-6. Unmanned CBRN R&S is conducted by leveraging technologies and sensors controlled from a
different location within the AO through a communications link or electronic tether to detect and monitor
potential CBRN hazards. Using an unmanned system, such as an UAS or unmanned ground vehicle, can
provide standoff or remote sensing for CBRN hazards. This allows information collection to be conducted at
a lower risk to personnel. CBRN R&S elements may gather all necessary/pertinent information to research
and determine the positive identification of hazards without having to place CBRN elements at risk. Forces
pair unmanned method of reconnaissance with mounted or dismounted methods to maximize information
collection efforts and minimize risk to forces.
Note. Airspace control is a critical consideration for the employment of UASs. See ATP 3-52.1 
and FM 3-52 for more information. 
E-7. Many unmanned systems are fielded to different enablers or are in development. The type of system
employed for a specific mission is oriented on the capabilities of the system, the availability of an unmanned
system, and the OE. Examples of available systems include—

Aerial systems.

Wireless radio-operated robots.

Fiber optic robots.

Unmanned ground sensors.
E-8. CBRN R&S elements may employ unmanned systems from LPs/OPs, maintaining their respective
hide and defensive positions. Multiple unmanned sensors may be employed at multiple positions or vehicles
in sustainment nodes. This provides hazard awareness and understanding of eminent CBRN threats to
personnel, supplies, and equipment. Unmanned sensors may be employed using techniques similar to those
of mounted or dismounted CBRN R&S elements. The following common CBRN supporting tasks may be
executed by unmanned systems:

Detect the presence or absence of CBRN hazards. (The detection accomplished by unmanned
systems can aid decision making for IPE decisions for exploitation teams.)

Identify CBRN hazards (determine the specific CBRN hazards present). (This information could
fulfill information requirements, allowing limited resources to focus on other information
requirements.)

Report CBRN hazards (automatic communications links or video feeds).
E-9. Although unmanned systems may be used for many R&S tasks, considerations of challenges and
capabilities of available systems must be considered. Some of the considerations for employing unmanned
systems include the—

System capability to navigate in the AO (for example doors, stairs, rough terrain, high winds).

Operational range of the system, including battery life.

Time/protection benefit over a human team.

Operator skill with the unmanned system.

Hazards created by the unmanned system itself, such as electrical interference of radio operations.

Line of sight and wired employment limitations.

Use of a spotter and control operator.

System ability to be decontaminated.

Communication system limitations.

Appendix F 
Sample Collection and Processing 
This appendix provides basic information for CBRN sample collection and techniques 
for sample collection and processing. Some of the steps provided within each of the 
CBRN sample collection sections are very similar. This redundancy allows these 
sections to be removed and used individually with complete information. 
SECTION I – OVERVIEW OF SAMPLE COLLECTION 
F-1. The sample management plan described in Chapter 6 outlines the basic considerations for managing
all of the actions related to collecting CBRN samples, from the point of collection to the final disposition. A
variation of the plan should exist at each level of command, from the CBRN R&S unit through the CCMD.
At the CBRN R&S element, the sample collection plan focuses on the planning conducted immediately
before actual sample collection operations at a specific area. The plan is normally finalized by the R&S
element leader after the execution of an initial area survey. At the CCMD, the plan should include the
synchronization of resources, from the collection elements through the transfer of samples to the laboratory.
F-2. The CBRN R&S unit develops a sample collection plan that incorporates guidance from the higher
headquarters sample management plan and that is specific to the mission. Because each CBRN sample
collection is unique, each mission requires a specific plan and should be done in concert with the site
assessment and characterization planning efforts and with consideration of the expected results of the sample
collection. Proper sampling requires time and resources that might not be available at the current time. The
following items are considerations for the sample collection plan:

Mission, purpose and scope of the sample collection, including the objectives, limitations, and
pertinent background information.

Coordination with adjacent elements that may be on-site to support or to conduct similar or
supporting sampling to deconflict operations, eliminate redundant activities, and reduce time on
the objective. Other entities may include EOD, medical, and decontamination.

Sample collection scheme including priority of samples, sample type, collection techniques, and
number.

CBRN materials, precursors, or types of contaminants expected to be encountered based on current
intelligence. Expected sample collection sizes based on the material to be collected.

Number of duplicates or splits required of each sample. In some cases, samples are sent to different
laboratories for processing (theater laboratory, host nation laboratory).

Determine number samples required (for example, blank/control, and background).

Identify a blank/control sample. Blank/control samples do not accompany the sample
collection team to the target.

Identify a background sample. The background sample should not contain target analyte,
yet still be geographically close enough to the sample site to be representative of
environmental contaminants. Background sample is an opportunity to employ a composite
sample (see section III).

Identify a sample. Procedurally, it should appear to be a repetition of background sample
(same tool, same primary container, same matrix) and taken after background sample.

31 March 2021 
Notes. 
1. It is advisable that priority 1 samples be collected after background samples to reduce the risk
of contaminating the background sample with the target analyte.
2. A matrix is whatever substance the target analyte resides in (soil, water, leaves, solvent, painted
surfaces).

Projection of the amount of time the sample collection mission will require.

Any specific requirements for sampling and/or packaging from the receiving laboratory.

Sample documentation requirements. DD Form 3108 captures important information regarding
the conditions during the sample collection, provides chain-of-custody tracking, and documents
final disposition of the sample.

Waste disposal plan, including if and how waste produced when collecting samples should be
handled. For instance, waste could be left in the area or be collected, containerized, marked, and
transferred to the decontamination or support element for proper disposal.
TYPES OF SAMPLES 
F-3. The type of CBRN sample collection may vary based on the nature, source, type, and method of
dissemination and location of the area. Normally, the best area for CBRN sample collection is where
casualties have occurred, plants are wilted or discolored, or there are dead animals (fish or birds). This is not
always the case when dealing with biological agents due to an incubation time period or with radiation due
to the dose and time needed to cause signs and symptoms. There are several different types of samples, some
of which may overlap. This section describes the types and its purpose.
CBRN 
F-4. CBRN compounds include chemical and biological warfare agents, binary/precursor materials,
radiological materials, and other TIMs associated with a CBRN program or industrial process. These samples
include both bulk and trace level samples. Each of the C-B-R and -N categories may require unique sampling
protocols described further in the section IV through section VII of this appendix.

Bulk. Bulk samples may consist of solids, liquids, and powders taken from containers, tubs, or
drums. They may also include materials such as stones, fixed structures (for example, buildings,
paved surfaces), pastes, metals, carpet, or gels that are in the same room or structure that is being
exploited (see paragraph F-6).

Trace. Trace samples consist of wipe samples taken from potentially contaminated surfaces,
fragments from munitions, empty laboratory vessels/containers, and so forth. Trace samples have
little to no visible material from which to collect a sample.

Neat. A neat sample represents a laboratory grade sample without any solvent. These samples
would have a purity higher than can be expected in an improvised laboratory.
EXPLOSIVES 
F-5. Many explosives are very sensitive and will detonate with very small amounts of friction and impact
as well as being detonated by the static electricity stored up in the human body. In the case of homemade
explosives precursor products may create a substantial safety hazard when they come into contact with other
materials. Collecting samples of suspected explosive or energetic materials is inherently dangerous and
should only be done by trained EOD personnel.
ENVIRONMENTAL 
F-6. Environmental samples (air, water, soil, food, vegetation, and insects) are removed from common,
natural materials, such as air, water, soil, or vegetation. Solid samples (powders, paints, metals) may be useful

if collected at an incident scene, impact area, blast zone, operating facilities, and areas where runoff may 
collect. 

Air. Air sample collection is typically conducted to determine the presence of contamination. Air
sample collection is also conducted to determine the background for comparison purposes.
Considerations are—

The concentration of contaminants at a sample area depends upon the flow rate of the
contaminant into the environment, the wind speed, and the physical state of the contaminant,
the terrain contours, and temperature as a variable.

Natural and man-made terrain features such as hills, valleys, and rows of buildings, sometimes 
aid the CBRN sample collection team by channeling emissions.

When associated with a particular facility, the downwind side from the release point is a
suitable place to collect a sample.

Aerosols may leave little residue. Water, vegetation, PPE (especially filters), and dosimetry
devices downwind from the sample collection area may provide useful samples.

Water. In the event of a CBRN incident, water sample collection may be necessary to determine
that water supply sources have not become contaminated. Take a minimum of four samples; three
samples of the suspected contamination and one control sample from a nearby unaffected
(uncontaminated) area for reference. The additional samples allow for greater analysis of the
contamination.

Collect samples at various depths to obtain the most complete assessment of the
contamination. The upper layers of water may have lesser amounts of contaminants, due to
higher temperatures that promote evaporation and decomposition.

At a minimum, collect samples from the water’s surface and near the bottom of the water
source. If an oil film, globules of organic materials, or a powder-like material is visible on the
water’s surface, ensure this material is sampled.

Snow samples should be collected from the layer of suspected exposure to chemical or
biological agents. Coordinate with the weather officer to determine how much new snow has
fallen to aid in determining how much snow should be removed before coming into contact
with possible contamination. Snow sample surface area is 9 x 9 centimeters to a depth of no
more than 1.3 centimeters.

Soil. Soil samples are used to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to identify
hazardous substance source areas.

Soil samples should be taken over a surface area 9 x 9 centimeters to a depth of no more than
1.3 centimeters (true required depth depends on absorption of substance into soil).

Samples should be taken as close to the center of contamination as possible. Samples may be
taken near CBRN fatalities.

Vegetation. Vegetables, plants, seeds, leaves, grasses, and grain matter should never be touched.
These require using scissors and tweezers, forceps, or hemostat and should be collected in separate 
containers. Particular attention should be paid to the discoloration or withering of the matter.
BULK SAMPLE COLLECTION 
F-7. A bulk sample is a quantity of material, sufficient to run laboratory analysis to determine the
composition. The volume or quantity needed is dependent on the type of material and the type of analysis
required. A bulk sample consists of suspicious powders, liquids, and solids. Bulk samples of building
materials such as sections of carpet, office equipment, and supplies can also be taken. Coordinate with the
receiving laboratory as to the bulk sample size, quantity, and type that can be processed and accepted. Other
considerations include the hazard severity of the sample, the sample collection expertise, and transport
requirements. Factors include—

Sample size. Sealing and packaging large samples may become difficult.

Fabrics such as clothing and upholstery may be another source for sample collection. Using
a scalpel, personnel should cut a piece no more than 9 x 9 centimeters. For carpeting, the
sample should be no more than 3.8 x 3.8 centimeters. Attention should be paid when securing
Appendix F 
F-4
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.9/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
this type of sample. If a fabric, upholstery, or carpet is stained or contaminated, limit the 
sample size to that required for follow-on analysis. Fabrics sample should consist of part of 
the stained area and part of the unstained area.  

Samples from walls, vehicles, or other types of immovable objects should be taken by
scraping the contaminated surface and collecting the scrapings into a sample container.

Sample quantity. Collecting too much or too large of a sample may exceed the limit for laboratory 
personnel to process and their ability to properly dispose of unused contaminated portion of
sample.

Filters from casualties, are of potential value due to the entrapment of agent inside the filter.
Filters should be individually placed in sample collection bags. Each filter should be
separately bagged and noted. When removing the filter from casualty ensure the casualty is
deceased prior to removing filter from mask.

Stones should be no more than 6 to 13 millimeters. These samples should be placed in a plastic 
freezer bag. The volume of stones should be approximately 200 to 300 milliliters.

Sample safety. Opening some containers may cause more harm when exposed to other elements
in the immediate environment.

Sample collection expertise. Collecting suspicious material may require higher levels of expertise
and capacity to collect, contain, and limit further damage, harm, or contamination.

Sample transport. Establishing and maintaining chain of custody of bulk materials when sample
is transported by other means than the R&S element.
MEDICAL 
F-8. Medical specimens are taken from animals or humans suspected of being infected/exposed to a
biological or chemical agent/materials. Medical specimens may consist of, but are not limited to,
physiological fluids (blood, urine, and saliva) from a patient or blood/urine/organ specimens from human or
animals. Medical specimens collected from U.S. personnel should be done in accordance with joint or Service 
specific guidance for CBRN exposure, and only collected by qualified medical personnel.
F-9. Tissue specimens will only be collected when directed. If medical personnel augment the sampling
team, then only medical personnel will secure the specimens. When involved in domestic operations the
sampling team will not secure tissue specimens.
F-10. Where medical specimens cannot be taken then swipes will be taken of casualties. Sterile swabs are
used to swipe nasal passage, ear, and the gum line.
F-11. Small dead animals (such as birds and rodents) are also sources of samples. Personnel should ensure
the animal is dead prior to handling. Personnel will not handle carcasses by hand. Heavy tweezers, tongs, or
forceps should be used to place the sample in a plastic bag. Air should be purged from the plastic bag, without
damaging the sample, prior to closing it. Be aware of temperature requirements when processing biological
hazard. Environmental samples suspected of containing a biological hazard and medical specimens must be
stored and transported in a manner in order to maintain at temperature between 1-4 ºC.
SURFACE SAMPLE 
F-12. The surface sample is primarily associated with contact hazards and consists of metals, dust particles,
and/or unseen materials that collect on surfaces. These surfaces may include floors, windowsills, ledges, or
automobiles. Due to the physical state of the surface, the sample collection team must be properly equipped
should they encounter the following types of surfaces:

Hard and smooth nonporous surfaces (the ideal surface).

Soft rough porous substrates.

Fragile substrates (a surface on which an organism grows or is attached).

Oily and/or grossly contaminated surfaces.

Dermal (pertaining to the skin) sample collection.

F-5
QUALITY CONTROL (BACKGROUND AND BLANK) 
F-13. Quality control samples are intended to ensure that the target agent in the sample is specific to the
operation location and is not a result of cross contamination or naturally occurring background components.

Background. Background samples are required to identify any contaminants inadvertently
introduced onto the collected sample by the sample team. These samples are collected away from
the source area (upwind or uphill for environmental type samples) to isolate the effects of the
source or site on the sampling process, to determine if the contamination is naturally occurring or
not. Nonenvironmental background (wipe) samples (for example, inside room or facility) serve
the same purpose and also provide additional information on other processes that may have been
conducted in the same space.

The sample collection team collects at least two samples of soil, water, air, or vegetation from
areas that are approximately 500 meters upwind of an alleged incident area to ensure no
downwind hazards have contaminated the source or area where the background sample is
taken. Clearly mark background and contaminated samples.

Background samples must closely resemble or be similar to those presumed to be
contaminated and collected at an incident area. For example, if a CBRN sample collection
team collects leaves from a tree in an incident area, the sample collection team should collect
sample leaves from a tree of the same type outside the contaminated area. Background
information for each collected CBRN sample must be detailed and clearly stated.

As a matter of practice, the background/control sample should be standardized as the first
sample number during a sample collection mission.

Blank/control materials. Collectors must submit unopened, pristine collection tools, materials,
and containers from the same manufactures lot in order to rule out any intrinsic target signatures
that may be present as an artifact from the manufacturing, storage, or transport process.
Blank/control samples should be new/unused collection materials not taken into the collection
area. If using non-standard/off-the-shelf/over-the-counter/non-sterile tools or primary containers
it may be necessary to purchase duplicates. The blank sample will be the unopened version of
whatever is employed.

Non-environmental background samples must be taken inside the same room as the primary
sample(s) are collected. The background sample is typically a wipe sample from a wall, back of a
door, computer monitor, and opposite of where the pay sample is to be collected. A background
sample should be collected from each different room/facility than the primary samples are to be
collected from. This background sample provides indications of any additional contaminants
present in the same working space, and can assist in determining what additional work may have
been performed in the same space previously.
DUPLICATE SAMPLES/SPLITS 
F-14. Sample splits may be required for a variety of reasons and should be considered during mission
planning. The requirement for sample splits should be codified in the CCMD or JTF sample management
plan or OPORD. If sufficient sample material/matrix is available, then splits may be requested, or directed
by the chain of command. Coordinate with the theater validation laboratory to determine if duplicate samples
must be taken on site, or if splits will be done by the laboratory. Sample splits enable multiple levels of
analysis concurrently in order to obtain lesser confidence results quickly while waiting for higher level
confirmation. Additional reasons for sample splits include, but are not limited to the following:

Force protection analysis.

Intelligence.

Coalition Partners and host-nation sharing.

International regulatory body (for example, Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons, International Atomic Energy Agency, World Health Organization).

Archive samples.

As directed by the CCMD or JTF commander.

31 March 2021 
PRIORITIES 
F-15. Sampling priorities are established by the JFC consistent with force protection requirements and
priority information requirements established by the CCMD. Samples fall under three priority categories
based on where the samples were collected. These priorities are subject to change based on the tactical,
operational, or strategic situation or intelligence requirements.

Priority 1. Bulk agent, bulk binary and/or other precursor materials (such as drums, barrels, final
laboratory products), to include munitions or other delivery devices/systems.

Priority 2: Environmental samples (such as air, water, soil, food, vegetation, and insects) and
medical specimens (for example, blood, tissue, nasal secretions, vomit, and urine) from areas of
alleged CBRN use.

Priority 3: CBRN defense materials (for example PPE, antidote kits, decontamination equipment,
detection equipment) CBRN research and development facilities/equipment, or CBRN test and
evaluation facilities/equipment.
SECTION II – SAMPLING PROTOCOLS 
F-16. This section provides information on sample collection procedures for CBRN environmental samples
in liquid, solid, or gas form and the associated requirements to package the sample for shipment to a
supporting theater laboratory or evacuation to a CONUS-based laboratory. Sample collection is a key step in
determining and documenting the presence of CBRN threats/hazards. Sample collection supports intelligence
requirements, and the results are used to confirm or deny that an incident or an outbreak has occurred. The
goal of CBRN sample collection is to collect a series of samples of suspected CBRN agents or materials that
represent the original source, thus permitting CBRN incident analysis. Information collected while
conducting CBRN sample collection is used to support protection, prevention, and treatment decisions.
Sample collection, in support of military operations, is primarily for tactical use but may be used as evidence
in an international criminal investigation if personnel are trained and the proper protocols are followed.
SAMPLE COLLECTION CONSIDERATIONS 
F-17. Once the CBRN sample collection type has been determined, the number of CBRN samples that must
be taken and the number of available personnel to support the sample collection operation are determined.
The number of samples that must be taken and personnel available to support the sample collection operation
are key factors in determining the technique to be used. Time constraints on the completion of objectives
must also be adhered to. Three basic strategies for sample collection at a given target area are random,
systematic, and judgmental.

Random. Random, nonsystematic sample collection of the target or a portion of the target may be
used when the specific area of concentration is unknown or when a suspicion drives area selection.

Systematic. Systematic (or grid) sample collection is an objective strategy where samples are
taken at predetermined intervals. Regular patterns of samples can rely on a grid structure or other
type of regulated pattern that is superimposed on the target area. In some cases, the grid can
literally be demarcated with string or stakes.

Judgmental. Judgmental (or selective) sample collection is a subjective strategy where areas are
selected based on the assessment or determination of the sample collection team. Often,
judgmental sample collection is employed to take a series of grab samples from the areas
considered to be the most likely areas of contamination.
F-18. The sample collection team should have enough sample collection equipment and consumables to take
the assessed number of samples including the necessary types (vapor, soil, vegetation, snow, or water) and
blank, background and duplicates. The appropriate sampling equipment for the different types of samples
(chemical, biological, radiological, explosive, or fissile). At least one clean, unused version of any sample
container should also be provided to each laboratory for use as a blank or negative control. For air samples,
an unused air filter or cartridge should be provided to the laboratory as a blank. For surface samples, an
unused swab, wipe, cloth tape, or vacuum filter should be provided as a blank. In addition, sample collection
teams should be equipped with digital photography capability. Digital photographs of the suspect agent or
scene are critical and may be sent electronically.

F-7
PLANNING 
F-19. A sample collection plan is developed prior to initiating any sampling operation on a suspected CBRN
facility, and is done in concert with the site assessment and characterization planning efforts. Sampling team
personnel should make every attempt to coordinate with the appropriate laboratory prior to initiating sample
collection operations to identify specific requirements for sample collection if not identified in the sample
management plan. Requirements may include minimum quantity, container type and reporting requirements.
The sample collection plan defines the following:

Receive the mission, purpose, and scope of the sampling operation, to include: objectives,
limitations, who should conduct the sample collection operation (CBRN personnel, PVNTMED
personnel, tactical forces), and pertinent background information.

Collect and review available intelligence (for example, imagery, mission/tactical support folder,
incident reports, CBRN spot reports, EOD robot video) on the target site. Contact unit on-site for
site-specific details such as current mission-oriented protective posture level.

Review the CCIR, PIR, and reporting requirements.

Identify available resources (for example, unit, point of contact), frequency and call-sign, or role
name); on-site maneuver and/or security element, decontamination unit, combat engineer unit,
signal and medical support, and EOD).

Determine location and type of facility(ies) (for example, UGF, production, storage).
PREPARATION 
F-20. While leaders plan and coordinate, subordinate leaders conduct precombat checks of personnel, their
IPE/PPE (mask, filters, suits, boots, and gloves), individual equipment, and mission equipment. The sample
collection team prepares sample identification labels, and any other documentation required. Prepare
prepackaged sample collection tools in the cold zone. The goal is to maximize the quantity of time the R&S
element is able to spend collecting samples in the hot zone by preparing the sample collection gear in the
cold zone.
ACTIONS ON OBJECTIVE 
F-21. Actions on the objective should be established by SOPs and the sample management plan. Actions
may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Link up with on-site security and EOD element.

Conduct and external survey, internal survey (initial entry).

Reevaluate PPE based on assessment of hazards identified during initial survey.

Document the site through photos, videos, and sketches.

Monitor equipment.

Establish clean space outside of sampling space.

Document actions in log and through communications to TOC.
F-22. Although specific sample collection procedures may vary, there are common guidelines that apply to
any sample collection operation. Safety is the foremost concern during any sample collection operation as
the sample area may be inherently dangerous and contaminated. Table B-1, page B-5, provides a list as an
example for tasks that should be completed for actions on the objective. The following are examples of some
of the minimum safety considerations:

Do not conduct operations in a contaminated area without backup personnel present, who are
partially dressed in the appropriate PPE, prepared to don complete PPE, and enter the area as an
emergency extraction team.

Identify physical/mechanical hazards that may affect the sample collection operations and adjust
the plan accordingly to mitigate the hazard.

F-8
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.9/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 

Establish a decontamination area in the warm zone for personnel and equipment. Decontaminate
sample collection R&S element members and sample containers according to applicable
guidelines. Decontaminant may need to be adjusted based off finding of the sample collection
R&S element (for example, a contaminant that reacts with standard decontaminants).

Collect critical samples and those that are most likely to be lost, destroyed, altered, or overlooked
first; and then move them to the staging area.
SECTION III – SAMPLE COLLECTION TECHNIQUES 
F-23. Sample collection techniques are the methods in which the sample is removed from its original area
and transferred to the sample container. The techniques are discrete, composite, grab, and surface. These
techniques are associated with the physical state of the sample media.

Discrete. The discrete technique is used when the sample media is soil. A discrete sample is
collected from a single point to obtain a sample that accurately portrays the soil conditions at a
specific area. Discrete samples are routinely collected to accurately portray the soil conditions at
an area where a chemical spill has occurred and the spill is isolated to a very small area.

Composite. The composite technique is a mixture of multiple samples collected from a defined
area. The samples that make up the composite sample are called aliquots (an exact fraction of the
whole). Composite samples are collected to accurately portray contaminants in soil in an area that
may or may not be contaminated. Multiple aliquots are collected from the sample collection area
identified from the sample plan, homogenized in a large mixing bowl, and treated as one soil
sample. Composite sample collection produces an average value of an area when analyzed.
Composite sample collection is commonly employed when analyzing environmental areas for
pollutants or screening large numbers of samples, such as soil and bulk sample collection at
multiple places within a specified area. This technique may be used when sample collection occurs
at the point of a chemical-biological incident to increase the probability of obtaining a positive
sample. A disadvantage to this approach is the risk of dilution of the chemical-biological agent to
a concentration that is below the detection limit of analytical platforms.

Grab. The grab technique is the basic and preferred collection technique in sample collection
operations. Grab sample collection is defined as a single sample that is removed at a single point
in time from one area. Grab samples are an optimal opportunity to collect containerized samples
that can be expeditiously collected, for example Petri dishes of bacterial growth or vials of sample
agents.

Surface. Any sample taken from a surface, to analyze any potential loose particulate or liquid as
a component of any ambient air flow or processes in the vicinity of the sample area.
COLLECTION ELEMENT STRUCTURE 
F-24. Sample collection elements may be structured as either of two basic organizations. It is the
responsibility of the persons involved in sample collection to work aseptically. The two R&S elements are—

Three-person sample collection element. A three-person collection team is the optimum
organization. It allows distribution of responsibilities between clean person, the sampler and a
recorder. The sample team leaders provides initial quality assurance/quality control and efficient
documentation of the sample collection operations that occur.

Two-person sample collection element. A two-person sample collection team is the minimum
size. It places a large load on the clean person to document and supply the sampler with the sample
collection equipment needed, when needed. Using two people is more time and labor intensive
than a team with three and requires slow and methodical actions to ensure sample integrity, safety,
and proper documentation. The sample team leader will perform the duties as both recorder and
clean person.
F-25. Basic procedures for each of this techniques are explained in the following paragraphs. Table F-1
references the specific sections where procedures for different samples are provided.

THREE-PERSON SAMPLE COLLECTION ELEMENT 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
F-26. The three-person sample collection team consists of a sample team leader (recorder) (see table F-2),
the sample collector (sampler) (see table F-3, page F-10), and the assistant sample collector (clean person)
(see table F-4, page F-11). The following procedures are provided for three-person sample collection
elements.
Table F-2. Sample team leader (recorder) actions 
Before entering the 
actual sampling site 
the sample team 
leader will do the 
following 
Develop a sampling plan to support the overall operational objectives after reviewing all 
reconnaissance information (such as sketches, photographic and video evidence, and verbal 
briefings). If possible, the sample team leader will review photos and video with lab personnel in 
person or using reachback capability, to prioritize and identify critical sampling locations and 
specific protocols to use.  
Make team assignments (sampler, assistant sampler). 
Brief the sampling plan to the sampling team. 
Ensure that PCIs and rehearsals have been properly completed. 
The sample team leader is next in the chain of custody. The sample team leader my pre-sign the 
chain of custody form (DD Form 3108 [CBRN Sample Documentation and Chain of Custody]) from 
the sampler or before the sampling mission or immediately after decontamination. 
During sampling 
mission, the sample 
team leader will do 
the following 
Exercises overall control, QA, and QC of sample collection. 
If mission dictates collect important information at the site. Such information might include, but is 
not limited to, notebooks with chemical formulas, computer hard drives, textbooks, photos. 
Determine search pattern of the site to identify all sampling points and to confirm sampling 
precedence. Sampling points may be marked by SOP such as with numbered index cards. The 
sample team leader will take the entire team on a walk-through of the site/scene to ensure all 
members know all the hazards, what needs to be sampled, and in what order. 
Direct where the sump and clean tarp are to be placed. 
Monitor team members for proper sampling techniques, quality control, packaging of samples, 
marking of samples, and safety. 
Sample team leader will avoid touching, moving, opening and/or rearranging objects/items in a 
target to avoid being contaminated. 
Maintains sample log notebook of samples and communication with C2 node. Annotates and 
maintains the sample, photograph, and video log if required. 
Periodically check other team members PPE during sampling operations; look for cuts/rips/tears, 
open seams, or gaps in PPE ensemble components (for example, jacket and trousers). 
Constantly monitor the sampling site (working area) for atmospheric changes, using vapor sampling 
detectors. 
After sampling 
mission, the sample 
team leader will do 
the following. 
Process LAST through decontamination station, unless an emergency situation exists such as 
potential contamination, heat injury, or low air supply. 
Transfer samples, collected documents and all logs and documentation to transload personnel for 
final packaging. 
Make sure all sampling team members safely process through decontamination line. 
Ensure chain of custody form is competed correctly and signed. 
Debrief sampling team.

Table F-3. Sample collector (sampler) actions 
Sampler will do the 
following before the 
sampling mission. 
Receive mission brief from sample team leader. 
Check PPE and assist sampler with PCI on sampling bag. 
Have at least two layers of nitrile gloves over PPE ensemble gloves. 
Be knowledgeable in sampling techniques and conduct rehearsals in accordance with 
sampling plan.  
The sample collector is the first person in the chain of custody. The sample collector must 
prefill chain of custody documents prior to the sampling mission or sign chain of custody 
form immediately after decontamination. 
Sampler will do the 
following during the 
sampling mission. 
Walk through scene/site with sample team leader to identify sampling points and hazards. 
Sampler will place his decontamination bucket (sometimes known as a kill bucket) and 
garbage bag away from the assistant sampler’s set-up area. 
Assists clean person with setup. Sampler is considered clean unless they have touched 
anything at the target. Sampler may continue to assist clean person until the first sample 
is taken or they touch anything within the site. 
Identifies what will be needed to successfully collect samples. Informs clean person 
exactly what is needed to collect the sample using appropriate procedures. 
Uses laboratory film so that sample container caps will not come off. After the sample 
containers are decontaminated, the sampler will receive laboratory film from clean person 
and wrap the laboratory film around the cap of the container, ensuring the laboratory film 
covers the top of the container and the cap. Wrap in a clockwise direction, gently 
stretching the Laboratory film for a tight seal. The clockwise direction will tighten screw 
top caps more firmly.  
Places sample into an overpack held by the clean person. Be sure not to touch the 
outside of the overpack or the clean person. 
Never holds or moves a sample over the clean tarp. The sampler will never transfer a 
sample from sample collection utensil to initial package over the clean tarp. Takes 
samples as close to the original spot as possible to reduce spread of contamination. 
Removes the outer layer gloves, using proper glove removal technique, and secures a 
clean pair from the clean person. Sample collectors may wear several layers of gloves to 
save time, by peeling a layer off, but personnel’s dexterity suffers with multiple layers. 
Glove removal will be done after each sample is taken, and before taking the next 
sample. Used gloves and used sample collection equipment will be discarded. Another 
technique that can be used when a limited supply of gloves exists, is to decontaminate 
gloves and hands after each sample collection iteration. Caution must be used when 
reusing decontaminated gloves as they may have become damaged or worn through 
physical use or interaction with the chemical being sampled. 
When material is identified by sample team leader for information collection, only the 
sampler will pick up the material, and place it in an appropriately sized sample collection 
bag. The assistant sampler will hold open the bag and sampler will place the collected 
material inside the bag, ensuring not to touch outside of the bag, or the assistant sampler. 
All materials shall be triple-bagged. 
Small containerized samples like Petri dishes may be taken as grab samples. The 
sampler will use laboratory film on the lid of the container, and then place sample inside 
appropriately sized plastic bag. 
Sampler will do the 
following after the 
sampling mission. 
Separate trash from equipment that can be reused if properly decontaminated. Evacuate 
contaminated trash for disposal. The sampler will NOT touch samples, or anything that 
stayed on the clean tarp during the mission. 
Sampler will be the last person through the sump, and will place trash 
bag/decontamination bucket inside sump/large 6 mil bag, and depending of mission 
requirements, leave them there, or take them to the personnel decontamination station. 
Note. The sample team leader ensures the used sample collection equipment, decontaminate wipes, used gloves, 
and other trash from sampling are collected and placed in a hazardous materials container or marked plastic bag 
or trash can to prevent the spreading of CBRN contamination and for final disposal

Set up a decontamination bucket off of the clean tarp surface. This bucket will be used as 
a place to decontaminate hands if needed. 
Prepare any and all equipment needed to collect samples and conduct down range 
identification and analysis. 
Hand all sampling tools to the sampler, ensuring not to touch any portion of the tools that 
will actually come in contact with the sample. Never touch the sampler while handing 
equipment to him/her. Never take any equipment back from the sampler to avoid cross 
contamination. If assistant sampler’s hands come into contact with sampler or a 
suspected dirty surface, the assistant sampler will change gloves using proper glove 
removal technique. 
Receive sample in initial container from sampler. Sampler places sample in an over pack 
without touching the outside of the over pack, or touching the assistant sampler. Sampler 
announces “Sample XXX (sample number) Taken” The time will be annotated by the 
sampling team leader on the sampling log. 
Place sample in a secondary plastic bag, spray the overpacked sample with 
decontamination solution and seal the plastic bag. Repeat, so sample is triple-bagged. 
Assistant sampler removes all air from bag and seals the bag with tape. 
Annotate sample serial number on plastic bag, or most outer layer of package. Seal the 
most outer container/overpack with tamper-proof tape, not laboratory film. 
Announce, “Sample XXX Complete.” The time will be annotated by the sample team 
leader on the sampling log. 
Prepare for the next sample. 
Continue providing sampling supplies to the sampler while packaging samples. 
Assistant sampler 
will do the following 
after the sampling 
mission. 
Gather all samples, bag and seal all documents/video recorders/cameras. Then collect 
samples, preparing for movement to transload site.  
Transfer samples, collected documents and all logs and documentation to transload 
personnel for final packaging. 
Process through decontamination line after the sampler.

TWO-PERSON SAMPLE COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITIES 
F-27. The two-person sample collection team consists of a sample collector (sampler) (see table F-5, page
F-12) and the assistant sample collector (clean person) (see table F-6, page F-12). The following list provides
the basic responsibilities of each person of the two-person sample collection team and may not be all-
inclusive.

Two-Person Team Sample Collector Actions 
Exercises overall control of sample collection. 
Assists clean person with setup. Sampler is considered clean unless they have touched anything at the target. 
Sampler may continue to assist the assistant sampler until they take their first sample. 
Identifies what will be needed to successfully collect samples. Informs the assistant sampler of exactly what is 
needed and collects the sample using appropriate procedures. 
Uses laboratory film to ensure that the sample collection container cap will not come off. After the sample 
containers are decontaminated, he will receive laboratory film from the assistant sampler and wrap the 
laboratory film around the cap of the container, ensuring that the laboratory film covers the top of the container 
and the cap. Wrap in a clockwise direction, gently stretching the laboratory film for a tight seal. The clockwise 
direction will tighten screw top caps more firmly. 
Places sample into an overpack held by the assistant sampler. Be sure not to touch the outside of the 
overpack or the assistant sampler. 
Never holds or moves a sample over the clean tarp. The sampler will never transfer a sample from sample 
collection utensil to initial package over the clean tarp. Takes samples as close to the original spot as possible 
to reduce spread of contamination. 
Removes the outer layer gloves, using proper glove removal technique, and secures a clean pair from the 
assistant sampler. Samplers may wear several layers of gloves to save time, by just peeling a layer off, but 
personnel’s dexterity suffers with multiple layers. Glove removal will be done after each sample is taken, and 
before taking the next sample. All used gloves and used sample collection equipment will be discarded. 
Another technique that can be used when a limited supply of gloves exists is to decontaminate gloves and 
hands after each iteration of sample collection. Caution must be used when reusing decontaminated gloves as 
they may have become damaged or worn through physical use or interaction with the chemical being 
sampled. 
The sample collector is the first person in the chain of custody. The sample collector must sign chain of 
custody form immediately after decontamination or prefill chain of custody documents prior to the sampling 
mission. 
Table F-6. Assistant sample collector/recorder (two-person team) 
Two-Person Team Assistant Sampler Actions 
Prepares the equipment that is needed to collect samples. 
Hands all sample collection tools to the sampler, ensuring not to touch any portion of the tools that will actually 
come in contact with the sample. Never touches the sampler while handing equipment to them. Never takes 
any equipment back from the sampler. This keeps the assistant sampler clean. If assistant sampler comes into 
contact with the sampler or a suspected dirty surface, the assistant sampler will change gloves using proper 
glove removal technique. 
Maintains the sample log notebook. 
Documents the collection effort with still and video recordings. 
Is responsible for QA/QC. 
Transfer samples, collected materials and all logs and documentation to transload personnel for final 
packaging. 
The assistant sampler is next in the chain of custody. The assistant sampler may pre-sign the chain of custody 
form from the sampler before the sampling mission or immediately after decontamination.

TRANSLOAD 
F-29. Transload is the process of transferring any CBRN samples collected on a site, through the
decontamination line and preparing them for transfer to a laboratory for further analysis. Transload occurs at
the decontamination line. If available, a dedicated transload person inspects, decontaminates, and processes
collected samples from a site. Transload personnel are the chain-of-custody link between the sample team
and the recipient of the samples or a sample escort.
F-30. Transload personnel place the primary container inside a secondary container for transport to the cold
zone where it is packaged and shipped to a laboratory for analysis. The transload personnel fills in the chain
of custody form, assuming responsibility from the sample collection team. The transload personnel also signs
the chain of custody form when transferring responsibility to the escort team or directly to receiving
laboratory.
SAMPLE COLLECTION MEDIA TECHNIQUES AND GUIDELINES 
F-31. Materials on site include vapor, liquids, solids or mixtures. These materials may be collected at the site
to take representative samples to determine the nature of the hazard. The following sections provide
techniques to take in several different media.
AIR/VAPOR SAMPLE COLLECTION 
F-32. Air/vapor is a good sample matrix since it is a well-mixed medium. Air/vapor from a sample area
contains a variable concentration of contaminants. The concentration of contaminants depends on the flow
rate of the contaminant into the environment, the wind speed, the physical state of the contaminant, the terrain 
contours, and temperature as a variable. (See table F-7, page F-14.)
Appendix F 
F-14
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.9/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 
Table F-7. General procedures for air/vapor samples 
When to sample 
Perform sample collection as soon as possible after alleged use of a chemical, biological, and 
radiological agent. 
Where to sample 
The optimum place to obtain samples is as close to the emission source as possible. 
The farther away from the point of release, the more diluted the sample becomes from mixing 
with water, air, or environmental pollutants. 
Natural and man-made terrain features, such as hills, rows of buildings, and valleys, channel 
(concentrate) emissions. When these features are close to a particular facility, use the 
downwind side (if possible), as emissions remain concentrated due to the channeling affect.  
The sample collection reconnaissance and surveillance element determines the downwind 
area and collects environmental samples from that area. 
For collection in a possibly contaminated area, use a chemical agent detector kit to determine if 
a vapor hazard exists. 
Collect an air sample for laboratory analysis when a vapor, aerosol, or airborne particle hazard 
is unknown or suspected. 
Air samplers enable the reconnaissance and surveillance element to obtain vapor, aerosol, or 
airborne particle samples.  
How to sample 
Contaminants are sampled for later identification by using devices that draw air through filter 
material.  
Sample collection personnel should not use cologne, perfume, insect repellent, medical 
creams, or strong soaps while taking an air sample. These fragrances mimic volatile organic 
compounds that can be absorbed on the filter and skew analytical results.  
Smoke products can also interfere with air sample collection; therefore, avoid cigarette, vehicle 
exhaust, and campfire smoke. 
Shipboard sample collection operations must consider the products (for example, fuels, 
solvents, and gases) that are present and can cause false readings.  
Another method for collecting air samples is with devices such as automatic air samplers. 
Employ device for three to four minutes, when possible. Upon completion of sample collection, 
place the tube in a sealable bag and seal the bag with pressure-sensitive tape. Place the bag 
into a second bag, and use any type of tape to secure it. Decontaminate each layer of 
packaging with a 5 percent chlorine solution. Whatever is used (for example, sodium 
hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite) the strength should be measured to create 5 percent 
chlorine solution. (See ATP 3-11.32/MCRP 10-10E.8/NTTP 3-11.37/AFTTP 3-2.46 or Naval 
Ships’ Technical Manual, Chapter 470 – Shipboard BW/CW Defense and Countermeasures for 
directions on how to mix a 5 percent chlorine solution.) 
When possible, record the ambient temperature, barometric pressure, wind direction, and wind 
velocity when air sample collection is begun and when the sample collection ends.

WATER SAMPLE COLLECTION 
F-33. The collection of water (see table F-8) involves the collection of a sufficient number of samples to
properly analyze the source with regard to contaminants. Water samples may be collected by CBRN R&S
elements if suspected source of information on CBRN contamination. Water samples are collected by
PVNTMED personnel/bioenvironmental engineers for identification or verification of biological
contamination. At least four samples should be taken-three samples of the suspected contamination and one
control sample-from a nearby, uncontaminated area for reference.

F-15
Table F-8. General procedures for water samples 
When to sample 
Water from a facility should be sampled when intelligence or local reports suggest that 
possible production or storage occurs at the facility or an incident has occurred there. 
Intelligence assets will provide information on the presence of indicators that may show the 
need for sample collection (such as higher than normal amounts of security, increased flow of 
smoke from a facility chimney, or water from water discharge pipes).  
Collect water samples from allegedly contaminated areas just after the start of a rainstorm 
when runoff is beginning. Natural surface drainage will concentrate any remnants of toxic 
compounds in depressions, streams, or ditches. Because of their large surface area and the 
potential for collecting runoff from an incident area, ponds, streams, reservoirs, or puddles in 
the immediate area of a suspected incident are potential sources of useful samples. 
Where to sample 
Water discharge pipes from suspected facilities should be sampled directly. 
Drainage areas are ideal sample collection areas since contamination and dilution from other 
sources is minimized. Samples should be collected as close to the potential contamination 
area as possible since mixing may not have occurred. 
Multiple samples should be taken, one from the water surface and several from different 
depths. At a minimum, samples should be collected from the water surface and at the bottom 
of the water column in slow moving areas. 
Preferably, the R&S element should sample various parts of a stream to capture different 
water velocities, water body depth, and other variables.  
Avoid extremely turbulent and rapidly moving areas as this may affect contaminant 
concentration and detection. 
If an oil stain-like fan, globules of organic materials, or an unnatural-looking powder is visible 
on surface water, take surface samples. Most chemicals of interest are denser than water and 
usually sink to lower levels. However, high water temperatures promote decomposition and 
may cause the upper layers of water to harbor contaminants (blister agent [mustard] may float 
on the surface of water due to surface tension, even though it is heavier than water). 
The R&S element may also collect samples from stagnant pools of water if the pools of water 
are part of chemical waste areas (a landfill, a chemical disposal area). Chemicals may 
percolate into stagnant pools or dumps close to the area. 
How to sample 
If deemed safe enough to collect samples, then use one of the following methods to collect 
samples: 
•
The samples can be taken with a 50- to 100-milliliter pipette (or syringe) from the
source surface. Use one pipette per sample, transfer the contents into a separate
clean sample bottle (retaining any material suspended in the water), and close the
bottle (airtight). A sample size of at least 50 milliliters is needed.
•
If the sample container is not preserved, collect the sample by immersing a capped
container or a container with a stopper to the desired depth, removing the cap or
stopper, letting the container fill, and then recapping the container.
•
An alternate method for deep-water sample collection is to use a plastic, pump-
operated siphon to pump water from a specific depth.
Besides water samples, surface scum and bottom sediment can also be sampled and 
forwarded for analysis. 
If there is a belief that the adversary has used chemical agents during an incident, use a 
chemical-agent water test kit for sample collection. This kit will provide gross-level detection of 
chemical agents but is not an alternative to collecting samples for laboratory analysis. 
If the collector believes that radiological particles are present, he should use RADIAC 
equipment to confirm contamination.

F-34. When uncapping the bottle or container, hold the bottle or container near the bottom and the cap near
the top edge. Do not allow anything to touch the inside of the cap. Do not set the cap down. Do not rinse the
bottle or cap. If the bottle becomes contaminated (for example, if the threads are touched or hit on the stream
bottom), discard it.

Step 1. Hold the bottle near its base and plunge it below the water surface with the opening
pointing downward. Collect the sample from the desired depth. See figure F-2.

Step 2. Turn the bottle underwater into the current, and ensure that is it turned away. In slow
moving streams, push the bottle underneath the surface, and ensure that it is pointed away and in
an upstream direction.

Step 3. Remove the bottle from the water when it is filled to the shoulder. Two-thirds of the way
full is also acceptable.
Note. Do not discard the sample if the sample collection container contains a preservative. If a 
preservative is present, the sampler must choose a sample collection method that conserves the 
preservative. If the water level in the bottle is over full (there is no air pocket), quickly flick the 
bottle until the sample level falls enough to create headspace. If more than a few seconds pass, 
cap and shake the bottle before flicking. 

Step 4. Recap the bottle carefully without touching the sample inside.

SOIL SAMPLE COLLECTION 
F-35. Soil is a good medium to sample (see table F-9) for toxic organic compounds. Soil may contain large
amounts of compounds of interest. For best results, it is essential that the collector from the R&S element
sample at the precise area of compound deposition. Soil is a good medium to collect radiological particles
(dust or pellets). It is essential that the sample collector monitor the sample before collecting it to ensure that
the sample is contaminated with low enough levels of radiation to be safe for transport and will not exceed
the OEG.

Table F-9. General procedures for soil samples 
When to sample 
The R&S element should sample as soon as possible after the alleged chemical or biological 
incident. 
Where to sample 
Contamination may be recognized by discoloration or apparent deposition of material on the 
soil’s surface. If discoloration or deposition of material is evident, use a garden trowel or 
wooden tongue depressor to scrape up the soil. Collect only discolored soil or deposited 
materials, if possible. Multiple samples should be taken at different depths. 
Collect radiological agent samples from any place where RADIAC equipment indicates 
contamination (hot). If radiological deposits or material are evident, use a garden trowel or the 
scoop provided in the soil sample collection kit to scrape up the soil. Collect only 
contaminated (hot) soil, if possible. 
How to sample 
The R&S element may take soil samples using a knife, spoon, spatula, or similar item by 
scraping into a collection container the top 2 to 5 centimeters of soil from areas that appear to 
be contaminated. If the R&S element samples chunks or clods of earth, select those that are 
no larger than 10 x 5 x 1 centimeters.  
Collect a control sample from a sample control point of the same soil type or texture from a 
nearby, uncontaminated area. Normally 500 meters from actual sample point.  
Use a glass bottle, container, or nonstick container as a container when available. Plastic 
bags may also be used. When using glass bottles, containers, or nonstick plastic containers, 
seal the cap with pressure-sensitive tape and mark for identification.  
Place the soil sample in one bag, purge excess air, and seal by folding over open end two to 
three times and wrapping with any tape when using plastic bags. Insert the first bag into a 
second bag, seal, tape, and mark for identification. If possible, place samples in a shielded 
container.  
Ensure that each layer of packaging is decontaminated using a 5 percent chlorine solution. 
Whatever is used (for example, sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite), the strength 
should be measured to create a 5 percent chlorine solution. See ATP 3-11.32/MCRP  
10-10E.8/NTTP 3-11.37/AFTTP 3-2.46. Place the soil sample in one bag, purge excess air,
and seal by folding over open end two to three times and wrapping with any tape when using
plastic bags. Insert the first bag into a second bag, seal, tape, and mark for identification. If
possible, place samples in a shielded container.

VEGETATION SAMPLE COLLECTION 
F-36. Although not categorized as media, vegetation provides an excellent means for collecting CBRN
samples. Collect samples of vegetation that are not consistent with healthy plants or plant material that is in
the process of natural decay. See table F-10, page F-18.

Table F-10. General procedures for vegetation samples 
When to sample 
The R&S element should sample as soon as possible after the alleged chemical, biological, 
or radiological incident. 
Where to sample 
When the center of the incident in an area has been determined, collect a control sample of 
similar material from and unaffected area at a sample control point normally 500 meters 
away (upwind) from the sample collection area. The control should be taken before entering 
the contaminated area.  
Collect the sample from the center of the contaminated area, and at several 100-meter 
increments downwind of the area. If the R&S element can discern a contamination pattern in 
the area, this should be reported. 
How to sample 
Select leaves that have wilted or appear to have been chemically burned. 
Collect vegetation that has liquid or solid substances deposited on its surfaces. This may 
appear as a shiny or moist area.  
Collect vegetation at several places within the suspected contaminated area. Horizontal 
surfaces are the preferred sample collection areas. Use a cutting tool or any sharp object 
and cut several contaminated leaves or a handful of grass when possible. Collect enough 
vegetation to fill a one-gallon zipper lock storage bag. Do not crush the sample. Triple-bag 
the sample. Place the vegetation sample into a zipper lock bag. Purge excess air out of the 
bag and seal. Fold opened end of the bag two to three times and wrap with tape.  
Mark the bag for identification. Take a control sample of similar material from an unaffected 
area. Seal, tape, and mark the control sample. Ensure that each layer of packaging is 
decontaminated using a 5 percent chlorine solution.

SURFACE SAMPLE COLLECTION 
F-37. Surface sample collection technique is the process of wiping surfaces with approved material that will
capture the suspected contamination. The surface technique of sample collection varies with the agent and
purpose of the sample. It is recommended that the analytical laboratory processing the samples be consulted
when selecting a sample procedure for a specific chemical or contaminant to ensure the lab’s ability to analyze
off the matrix selected (for example, thermal desorption), as well as the availability of appropriate analytical
instrumentation. Surface sample collection techniques also involve properly using the appropriate wiping
materials of a particular surface such as a filter or cloth, which is then submitted to a laboratory for analysis.
Typical materials used in surface sample collection include—

Glass fiber filters. Glass fiber filters are recommended for chemicals that are analyzed by using
gas chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography. Also used for radiological
wipes (for carbon-14 and tritium) being analyzed with a liquid scintillation counter.

Cloth sample collection smears (4.5 centimeters). Cloth sample collection smears (4.5
centimeters) are used for surface wipe sample collection for radiological material.

Paper filters. Paper filters are generally used for collection of metals. Mixed cellulose ester filter
discs or smear tabs or their equivalent, are most often recommended.

Polyvinyl chloride filters. Polyvinyl chloride is available for substances unstable on paper-type
filters.

Gauze squares. Gauze squares may be used for organic substances. More durable than filter
media, especially when wiping rough surfaces.

Charcoal-impregnated pads. Charcoal-impregnated pads may be used for collection of volatile
solvents from surfaces. Work by trapping solvent on activated charcoal.

Swabs. Swabs are ideal for areas that are obviously contaminated and are easier to package for
transport as well as process in most laboratories when compared to wipes and filters. Swabs should
consist of natural fibers for suspect chemical or radiological materials and preferably consist of
sterile synthetic fibers for biological materials.

GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR WIPING
F-38. Two techniques are commonly used for wiping-S-pattern and decreasing concentric squares. For each
technique, firm pressure should be applied when wiping.

S-pattern. Place filter flat at one end of the sample and wipe in an S-pattern over the entire surface.
Without allowing the filter to come in contact with any other surface, fold the filter in half with
the exposed side in. If possible, for chemical/radiological sample collection use the same filter to
rewipe the area at 90° from the first wipe, again using the S-pattern, and then fold it inward again
(see figure F-3). Place the filter in a sample vial or container, cap, and place identifying data on
the container. Place the same identifying data on the area sketch and sample collection form.
Include notes with the sketch and sample collection form giving any further description of the
sample, for example, tabletop or baseboard.
Figure F-3. S-pattern surface technique 

Decreasing concentric squares. Start at the outside edge and progress toward the center of the
surface area by wiping in concentric squares of decreasing size. Without allowing the filter to
come in contact with any other surface, fold the filter with the exposed side inward. If possible,
for chemical/radiological sample collection use the same filter to repeat sample collection of the
same area, and then fold it inward again (see figure F-4, page F-20). Place the filter in a sample
vial or container, cap and place identifying data on the container. Place the same identifying data
on the area sketch and sample collection form. Include notes with the sketch and sample collection
form giving any further description of the sample, for example, tabletop or baseboard.

GENERAL SAMPLE SUBMISSION PROCEDURES 
F-39. Samples submitted for analysis must be properly packaged, labeled, and shipped so that they arrive in
an analytically acceptable condition. Chain of custody must be documented tracking accountability of the
sample from sample collector through each change of hands. The samples should be maintained at 1°C to
4°C. Priority of cooling goes to biological samples and any sort of vegetation. Prechilled refrigeration packs
and dry ice wrapped in paper may be used to keep samples cool. Where dry ice is used, ensure a sufficient
opening is created in order to let gas escape and not cause pressure. Exercise caution when using dry ice in
an enclosed environment (such as aircraft, confined space), as carbon dioxide (CO2) displaces the oxygen.
Carbon dioxide, solid, or dry ice is part of the hazardous cargo manifest, Class 9, UN1845, when the
applicable regulations apply to this item.
F-40. The general sample submission procedure are as follows:

Obtain information for the analytical laboratory about adding solvent to the container containing
the swipe sample. Samples for some substances should have solvent added to the vial or other
container as soon as the swipe sample is placed inside the container.

Submit the samples to the analytical laboratory with appropriate documentation, which includes a
chain-of-custody form (DD Form 3108). (Sample shipment procedures are not covered under this
reference document.)

Follow 42 CFR and 49 CFR, AFMAN 24-604/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/DLAI 4145.3, and
IATA regulations when packaging for all intra- and inter-theater.

Submit control standards and samples (for example, field blanks, background samples, spike
samples, split samples, duplicates, laboratory blanks) as required by the sample collection plan or
analytical laboratory’s protocol.
SECTION IV – CHEMICAL SAMPLE COLLECTION 
F-41. Table F-11 provides additional guidance for determining the size or amount of the recommended

The assistant sampler removes all identified sample collection tools from kit and lays them out on clean ground 
tarp. The sampler determines which tool he will use and tells assistant sampler. 
2 
(Optional) The assistant sampler hands the sampler the small tarp (for chemical analysis), which the sampler 
places near where the samples will be obtained. 
3 
(If analytic equipment utilized.) The assistant sampler hands the sampler the chemical analysis equipment and 
pH paper/meter, which the sampler places on the small tarp and ensures are ready for analysis. 
4 
The assistant sampler hands sample collection spoon or sample collection scoop and scoop handle or scalpel 
to assistant sampler. 
Note. Use the sample collection scoop for sample collection of fine particulates. Use the spoon for sample collection of coarse 
particulates. Use the scalpel for scrapping wood, paint, or crusted/coated material.

10 
The assistant sampler opens sample container and hands it to the sampler. 
11 
The sampler scrapes or scoops the solid material/soil into the sample container until the container is at least 
two-thirds full while assistant sampler takes a picture of the sample collection. (If conducting analysis on site, 
sampler will collect a small amount of material and deposit the sampled material onto appropriate analysis 
equipment.) When possible, sample containers should be completely filled, leaving no head space to minimize 
possible volatilization. 
12 
(If analytic equipment utilized.) The sampler scrapes or scoops the solid material for transfer onto appropriate 
analysis equipment.

containment bag (for example, Poly-bag or antistatic bag); decontaminates with 5 percent chlorine solution; seals 
the bag. 
21 
Place sample and secondary containment bag into a tertiary containment bag, so there is three layers of 
containment; decontaminates with 5 percent chlorine solution; seals the bag. Assistant sampler announces 
“Sample XXX (sample sequence number) complete.” 
22 
The sample collection team members dispose of used sample collection equipment; remove nitrile gloves. 
Note. Chemicals that are contained in a glovebox should be sampled, analyzed, and packaged (inner package) inside that 
glovebox. This is due to the potential for violent reactions of the chemicals with oxygen or other chemicals in the air. All 
materials required for sampling and analysis should be passed into the glovebox through existing pass-through/airlocks, 
and any equipment that is pulled out of the glovebox (such as chemical analysis equipment or pH meters) should be 
decontaminated both before they leave the glovebox (before they are placed in the pass-through/airlock) and after they are 
removed from the pass-through/airlock.

SECTION VI – RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION SAMPLE COLLECTION 
F-53. Radiological sample collection operations are important to determine if and where an enemy uses a
radiological agent. The collection of samples and background information must be as detailed and
comprehensive as possible. Each sample must be processed and analyzed to provide refined data for further
analysis. Sample processing includes the collection, packaging, storing, transporting, transferring, and
tracking of the sample. The following are included in the sample process:

An enemy may scatter radiological agents as radionuclide dust or as pellets of radioactive
materials. Radioactive dust will cover vegetation, soil, and water surfaces. Radioactive pellets will
not cover vegetation surfaces like a dust, but will remain on the surface of the soil. Also, pellets
will sink to the bottom of bodies of water. The R&S element can take samples of vegetation, soil,
or water to collect the pellets or dust.

Ensure that personnel involved in the operation have dosimetry devices and are dressed in the
appropriate level of PPE according to Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations.

The R&S element conducts a ground radiological search to locate the contamination. If the
purpose of the sample mission is only to collect radioactive samples, not survey, terminate the
search after the radioactive area is found. The safety of the R&S element is a constant concern for
the commander. The contaminated area may emit high dose rates of radiation; therefore, the R&S
element monitors the radiation throughout the radiological sample collection mission and does not
exceed the commander’s OEG turn-back dose and turn-back dose rate.

The R&S element collects radiological contaminated environmental samples. It chooses the
sample media based on the measurements the collector makes with RADIAC equipment. Ground
contamination may vary significantly from place to place. Local dose rate averages are helpful in
choosing a representative sample collection area. Conduct soil sample collection after the release
has ended. Be aware of the commander’s turn-back dose and turn-back dose rate guidance and of
the hazards that may be encountered.
Note. The radiological sample collection described in this section is provided as a guide. Technical 
units may use more detailed procedures found in references, such as AEP-66. 
F-54. Monitoring for removable radioactive contamination should be conducted using conventional large-
area wiping for qualitative analyses using a filter paper or equivalent over 100 square centimeters of the
surface. Large-area sample collection is performed by wiping cheesecloth, muslin, or an oil-impregnated dust
cloth over the surface. If tritium contamination is likely, collection should be done using wet glass fiber filters
meant to be analyzed with a liquid scintillation counter. Under certain conditions, radioactive (tritium)
contamination may penetrate the contaminated surface and then return to the surface over an extended period
of time. The following are procedures for surface sample collection for radioactive contamination:

Ensure that the collected samples are representative of the entire surface, with special attention
paid to likely points for collection of contamination.

Sample the following points of contamination:

Leakage points.

Rough surface areas.

Infrequently cleaned areas.

Work areas.

High-traffic areas.
F-55. Table F-23 provides additional guidance for determining the size or amount of the recommended
sample for radiological materials. Background samples should be about the same size as contaminated sample 
taken from an incident area.

Note. Special consideration is given to protection against both the radiological and chemical 
hazards that might be present. This is especially relevant if the sampled chemicals are (or are 
suspected to be) fluorine-based, such as uranium hexafluoride and material dissolved in 
hydrofluoric acid, as most conventional PPE, especially over-garments and filters, do not provide 
adequate protection. 
CRITICALITY/EXCURSION RISK
CAUTION 
CBRN R&S sampling teams must consider the possible presence of 
fissile material when receiving a positive reading of radioactivity. CBRN 
R&S elements must understand the unique risks of criticality, when 
interacting with fissile materials. See Section VII for more information on 
fissile material.  
Some fissile materials have dangerous chemical properties. Sampling 
should only be done by CBRN R&S teams who have received special 
training for these materials. 
F-56. Any time radioactive material is handled, the sampling team must consider the likelihood that the
system from which the sample is taken or the sample itself may contain fissile material and therefore result
in an unregulated excursion. If the potential for an excursion of the system containing fissile material is
suspected, the sampling team will not approach the system until—

Criticality mitigation procedures have been identified by subject matter experts (SMEs) such as
nuclear disablement teams or Department of Energy.

Identified procedures have been implemented.

Mitigation procedures have had the desired risk mitigation effects.

IONIZING RADIATION EXPOSURE CONCERNS. 
F-57. Exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation (alpha, beta, gamma, x-ray) can result in injury, illness,
or death. When radioactive material is handled, care must be taken to ensure that individuals do not exceed
prescribed radiation dose limits, OEG. See TM 3-11.91/MCRP 10-10E.4/NTRP 3-11.32/AFTTP
3-2.55, and DA PAM 385-24.
F-58. In addition to adhering to guidance and regulations, all operations involving radioactive material will
follow the principle of ALARA. Following this principle, the sample team will develop a plan that allows for
as little exposure to radiation as possible. This plan will include radiation reduction measures that incorporate
the three methods of dose reduction: time, distance, and shielding.

Time. The time a person is exposed to elevated levels of radiation will be kept as short as possible.
This can be accomplished through detailed rehearsals, the use of multiple people staged to follow
another in order to accomplish a task, or other methods as approved by leadership.

Distance. Radiation levels are reduced by the square of the distance; in other words, doubling the
distance from radioactive source will reduce the radiation levels by a factor of 4. Keeping this in
mind, personnel will actively ensure that they remain outside of any elevated radiation fields until
it is necessary to enter them, and will maintain a maximum distance from radioactive sources when 
in their radiation fields.

Shielding. Shielding radiation reduces radiation exposure by physically blocking the radiation
from reaching personnel or equipment. The type and quantity of shielding varies by radiation type
(alpha/beta/gamma/x-ray), intensity, and energy. Shielding, such as buildings and earthen
mounds, should be utilized to reduce exposure. Actively employing shielding for personnel using
items such as lead blankets should not be employed unless radiation safety experts are consulted,
as the resulting radioactive interactions can cause more damage to tissue than the original radiation 
the user was attempting to shield.
PACKAGING OF RADIOACTIVE SAMPLES 
CAUTION 
Water and packed earth (sandbags) will never be used to shield uranium 
or plutonium due to the interaction of neutrons with water. If shielding 
uranium or plutonium, the shielding must be no closer than one meter 
from the sample container. 
F-59. Once a sample is obtained, the radioactivity of that sample becomes a critical concern. Prolonged
exposure to even relatively low levels of radiation (for example 100 milliroentgen per hour in air at contact
with the outer sample container), as could occur when the sample is handled, stored, or prepared for transport, 
can cause health concerns that can be avoided.
F-60. The primary container for radiological samples should mitigate any chemical risk the sample may pose
(for example, be resistant to hydrofluoric acid); the secondary or even tertiary container (as necessary) must
ensure that the residual radioactivity is reduced to a manageable level. This outside packaging can be purpose-
built lead containers (a pig), appropriate Type-B containers, or a container that is constructed on-site that
meets the criteria for shielding. Whatever type of shielded container is used, the type of radiation that is
posing the threat must be considered; shielding for gamma radiation, such as lead, has little to no effect on
neutron radiation.
F-61. If an appropriately shielded container is not available, the sample will be stored in a manner and
location that reduces or eliminates radiological exposure from the sample. This storage means or location
will follow the Time, Distance, and Shielding concepts listed above. For example, radioactive samples can
be stored in a separate room away from personnel, surrounded by lead bricks of sufficient quantity, or well
away from personnel.

F-35
F-62. Common materials that can be used for shielding gamma/x-ray include lead, steel, aluminum, packed
earth and water (properly packaged samples that emit alpha and beta radiation alone are not a threat). In
general, high-Z materials (materials with a large quantities of protons in their nucleus, such as lead (82
protons) are good for shielding gamma/x-ray radiation.
F-63. Thickness of the shielding material is critical and varies by the type of shielding material being used.
The below tables outline how much shielding is required for varying gamma radiation dose rates and differing 
radioactive isotopes. The next section contains instructions for using tables F-24 and F-25, with an example
of calculating how much shielding is required following immediately thereafter.
CALCULATING REQUIRED SHIELDING THICKNESS 
F-64. To determine the required shielding thickness for specific radioactive isotopes the following steps are
followed:

Step 1. Determine the radioactive isotope that is to be shielded from table F-24. If the isotope is
unknown or is not listed in the table, use Cobalt-60.

Step 2. Determine what type of shielding material will be used from table F-24. Note that water
and packed earth will never be used to shield uranium or plutonium.

Step 3. Record the value at the intersection of the radioactive isotope and the type of shielding.

Step 5. Determine what the target dose rate is, after shielding. This target dose rate should take
OEG and exposure time into account.



Step 7. Multiply the value from step 3 with the value from step 6. This is the thickness of the
required shielding in centimeters.

Step 8. After constructing the shielding around the radioactive sample, measure the residual
radiation (outside of the shielding) to confirm the desired dose rate was reached.
Example 
Staff Sergeant Jones is tasked with packaging Cesium-137. She determines that the 
dose rate of the sample, taken one meter from the sample, is 10 roentgens/hour. The 
shielding material Staff Sergeant Jones will be using is sandbags. She will be storing 
the sample for four hours, and does not want to receive more than a 400 milliroentgen 
dose. Using the steps provided she determines a minimum of 48 centimeters of 
sandbags are required for shielding. 
Radioactive isotope: Cs-137 
Shielding: packed earth (sandbags) 
Value from table F-24: 24 
Dose rate at one meter from sample: 10 roentgens/hour 
Target dose rate: 100 milliroentgen/hour 
Value from table F-25: 2.00 
Calculated thickness of sandbags: 24 x 2.00 = 48 centimeters of sandbags (minimum) 
After stacking sandbags around the cesium source to a thickness of 48 centimeters, 
Staff Sergeant Jones measures the resulting dose rate (outside of the sandbag 
shielding) to ensure that the desired dose rate has been reached. 
LIQUID RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL SAMPLE

designated as clean work area.  
2 
The assistant sampler hands the sampler the small tarp for chemical analysis, which the sampler places near 
where the samples will be obtained. 
3 
The assistant sampler hands the sampler the chemical analysis equipment and pH paper/meter, which the 
sampler places on the small tarp and ensures are ready for analysis. 
4 
The assistant sampler opens laboratory film; cuts an adequate section length, and places on ground tarp. 
5 
The assistant sampler opens sample container packaging, removes identification labels and affixes one label 
to the sample container. If a three-person team, the recorder affixes the label to the sample container. 
6 
The assistant sampler verifies sample container number matches sample number on outer container, affixes 
sample number label to sample log notebook; records information in sample log notebook. If using a three-
person team, the recorder completes this step. 
7 
The assistant sampler (or recorder if a 3-person team) takes pictures of the sampling setup. 
8 
The assistant sampler opens syringe package exposing the back end and presents to the sampler. 
9 
The sampler removes syringe from packing and collects liquid sample from just below the surface. 
10 
The assistant sampler opens inner sample container and hands to sampler. 
11 
The sampler expresses collected liquid into inner sample container and discards syringe in dirty area. When 
possible, sample containers should be completely filled, leaving no head space to minimize possible 
volatilization. 
12 
(If analytic equipment utilized.) The sampler expresses drops of collected liquid onto appropriate analysis 
equipment and begins analysis process. The sampler expresses 1-2 drops of collected liquid onto the pH 
paper/meter and reads results to the recorder. 
Note. Do not completely empty the syringe; leave at least 5 milliliters of liquid in the syringe. Otherwise, some of the liquid 
may be aerosolized, creating a contamination hazard.

13 
The assistant sampler places cap on sample container, screws tight, and verifies that the cap is secure while 
the sampler holds the container.  
14 
The assistant sampler opens a decontamination wipe and hands wipe to the sampler. 
15 
The sampler decontaminates his hands and the sample container with the decontamination wipe. 
16 
The assistant sampler retrieves laboratory film from tarp and hands an adequate section length to sampler. 
17 
The sampler places laboratory film around the sample container closure to seal the cap to container. 
18 
The assistant sampler retrieves the outer container, opens it, and holds it open to the sampler. 
19 
The sampler places sealed container into outer container held by the assistant sampler, ensuring that he does 
not touch the outer container. Sampler announces “Sample XXX (sample sequence number) taken.” 
20 
The assistant sampler places cap on outer container and screws tight, places tamper seal tape across the cap 
with the ends contacting the sides of the outer container (forming a seal that will be broken if the cap is 
removed) and places outer container into secondary containment bag and seals the bag. Sample and 
secondary containment bag placed into a tertiary containment bag; resulting in three layers of containment. 
Assistant sampler announces “Sample XXX (sample sequence number) complete.” 
21 
The sampler uses the decontamination wipe to decontaminate the chemical analysis equipment, as necessary, 
and prepares the equipment for the next sample.  
22 
The sample collection team members dispose of used sample collection equipment and removes nitrile gloves. 
23 
The outer sample package will be wipe tested before it passes through the decontamination line. If 
contamination is detected, the outer package will either be decontaminated or placed in another outer package, 
which will then be wipe tested. This process will continue until no contamination is detected. 
Note. Moisture can block alpha contamination–the outer sample bag must be dry when conducting this procedure. 
Note. Chemicals that are contained in a glovebox should be sampled, analyzed, and packaged (inner package) inside that 
glovebox. This is due to the potential for violent reactions of the chemicals with oxygen or other chemicals in the air. All 
materials required for sampling and analysis should be passed into the glovebox through existing pass-through/airlocks, 
and any equipment that is pulled out of the glovebox (such as chemical analysis equipment or pH meters) should be 
decontaminated both before they leave the glovebox (before they are placed in the pass-through/airlock) and after they are 
removed from the pass-through/airlock. 
LIQUID RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL SAMPLING USING TUBING

5 
The assistant sampler opens tubing package; pulls out one end of tubing and removes end cap. 
6 
The assistant sampler partially opens blunt tip needle package at the attachment end, removes blunt tip 
needle, and inserts needle into tubing for at least one-half inch. 
7 
The assistant sampler pulls tubing out of package to the desired length for sample collection. Using the 
scissors cuts the tubing at the desired length, allowing excess tubing to fall to the ground. Tubing may be set 
on clean ground tarp. 
8 
The assistant sampler opens the tubing weight packages and slides tubing weights onto far end of the tubing, 
ensuring that at least one inch of tubing extends past the last tubing weight. 
Note. The number of tubing weights on sample end of tubing is determined by length of tubing. 1–3 weights can be used.

Steps 
Process 
11 
The assistant sampler opens laboratory film; cuts an adequate section length, and places on ground tarp. 
12 
The assistant sampler opens sample container from kit, removes sample container and sample labels, and 
places them on the ground tarp. 
13 
The assistant sampler opens sample container packaging, removes identification labels and affixes one label to 
the sample container. If a three-person team, the recorder affixes the label to the sample container. 
14 
The assistant sampler verifies sample container number matches sample number on outer container, affixes 
sample number label to sample log notebook; records information in sample log notebook. If using a three-
person team, the recorder completes this step.  
15 
The assistant sampler (or recorder if a 3-person team) takes pictures of the sampling setup. 
16 
The sampler carefully lowers the weighted end of the tubing into the object to be sampled until it is below the 
liquid level while maintaining at least 4 inches of tubing above the object being sampled. 
17 
The sampler carefully draws back on the syringe plunger until the syringe fills with liquid. 
18 
The sampler unlocks the needle from the syringe and discards, once the sample is taken. 
19 
The assistant sampler opens inner sample container and hands to sampler. 
20 
The sampler expresses collected liquid into inner sample container and discards syringe in dirty area. When 
possible, sample containers should be completely filled, leaving no head space to minimize possible 
volatilization. 
21 
(If analytic equipment utilized.) The sampler expresses drops of collected liquid onto appropriate analysis 
equipment and begins analysis process. The sampler expresses 1-2 drops of collected liquid onto the pH 
paper/meter and reads results to the recorder. 
Note. Do not completely empty the syringe; leave at least 5 milliliters of liquid in the syringe. Otherwise, some of the liquid 
may be aerosolized, creating a contamination hazard. 
22 
The assistant sampler places cap on sample container, screws tight, and verifies that the cap is secure while 
the sampler holds the container. 
23 
The assistant sampler opens a decontamination wipe and hands wipe to the sampler. 
24 
The sampler decontaminates his hands and the inner sample container with the decontamination wipe. 
25 
The assistant sampler retrieves laboratory film from tarp and hands an adequate section length to sampler. 
26 
The sampler places laboratory film around the inner sample container closure to seal the cap to container. 
27 
The assistant sampler retrieves the outer container, opens it, and holds it open to the sampler. 
28 
The sampler places sealed container into outer container held by the assistant sampler, ensuring that he does 
not touch the outer container. Sampler announces “Sample XXX (sample sequence number) taken.” 
29 
The assistant sampler places cap on outer container and screws tight, places tamper seal tape across the cap 
with the ends contacting the sides of the outer container (forming a seal that will be broken if the cap is 
removed) and places into secondary containment bag and seals the bag. Sample and secondary containment 
bag placed into a tertiary containment bag; resulting in three layers of containment. Assistant sampler 
announces “Sample XXX (sample sequence number) complete.” 
30 
The sampler uses the decontamination wipe to decontaminate the chemical analysis equipment, as necessary, 
and prepares the equipment for the next sample. 
31 
The sample collection team members dispose of used sample collection equipment and removes nitrile gloves. 
32 
The outer sample package will be wipe tested before it passes through the decontamination line. If 
contamination is detected, the outer package will either be decontaminated or placed in another outer package, 
which will then be wipe tested. This process will continue until no contamination is detected. 
Note. Moisture can block alpha contamination–the outer sample bag must be dry when conducting this procedure. 
POWDERED RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL SAMPLE 
F-67. The steps in table F-28 provide example procedures for collecting powdered radioactive material
sample collection. While powdered material is, by definition, a solid, it is being treated differently from bulk
solids due to the special considerations, such as chemical reactivity, changing of geometry within a sample
package, powdered material entails.

Note. Special consideration must be given to PPE requirements. This is especially relevant if the 
sampled chemicals are (or are suspected to be) fluorine-based, such as uranium hexafluoride and 
material dissolved in hydrofluoric acid. Most conventional PPE, especially overgarments and 
filters, do not provide adequate protection.

outer sample vial or container cap (forming a seal that will be broken if the cap is removed) and places into 
secondary containment bag and seals the bag. Sample and secondary containment bag placed into a tertiary 
containment bag; resulting in three layers of containment. Assistant sampler announces “Sample XXX (sample 
sequence number) complete.” 
19 
The sample collection team members dispose of used sample collection equipment; remove nitrile gloves. 
20 
The outer sample package will be wipe tested before it passes through the decontamination line. If 
contamination is detected, the outer package will either be decontaminated or placed in another outer package, 
which will then be wipe tested. This process will continue until no contamination is detected. 
Note. Moisture can block alpha contamination–the outer sample bag must be dry when conducting this procedure. 
SOLID RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL SAMPLE 
F-68. This section addresses bulk solid radiological material, as opposed to powdered radiological material.
By definition, they are both solids; however, special considerations and sampling techniques exist for the
sampling and packaging of each, and thus they are treated separately. Sampling of solid radiological material
is based off of the grab technique, which is the basic and preferred collection technique in sample collection
operations. Grab sample collection is defined as a single sample that is removed at a single point in time from
one area. Additionally, the probability that such samples will be required as evidence in legal proceedings
substantiates this approach as the preferred technique. The steps in table F-29, page F-40, provide example
procedures for solid radiological material sample collection.

which will then be wipe tested. This process will continue until no contamination is detected. 
Note. Moisture can block alpha contamination–the outer sample bag must be dry when conducting this procedure. 
RADIOACTIVE SAMPLE LABELING 
F-69. In addition to the sample label, the outermost package/container will be labeled with the level of
radioactivity, with the reading taken at 1 meter from the sample. For intra-theater shipping during combat
conditions, this can be any firmly affixed label with the following information clearly visible from one meter
from the outermost packaging.
F-70. This label must be clearly visible to anyone approaching the sample. Therefore, if shielding material
is placed around the sample, this label must be both on the outermost sample container and on the outside of
the shielding. For example, if a radioactive sample is surrounded by sandbags for shielding, the radioactivity
label must be on the outermost sample container and on the outside layer of the sandbags where it can be
seen by anyone approaching the sample. Figure F-5 is an example of an intra-theater radioactivity label.

SECTION VII – FISSILE MATERIAL SAMPLING 
F-71. If there is suspected system containing fissile material on site, the CBRN R&S team will not approach
the system until—

A criticality risk assessment has been conducted and approved with criticality mitigation
procedures identified by SMEs. DD Form 2977 (Deliberate Risk Assessment Worksheet) may be
used. See table F-30, page F-42, for example tasks that should be considered.

Identified procedures have been implemented.

Mitigation procedures have had the desired risk mitigation effects.
CAUTION 
CBRN R&S elements must understand the unique risks of criticality, 
when interacting with fissile materials. A system becomes critical when 
a chain of fission events is self-sustaining. An excursion is when a 
system becomes unintentionally critical, and may happen as a result of 
changes in quantity, geometry, concentration, or surroundings. This 
may happen when fissile materials are consolidated in a close area, the 
flow of liquid containing fissile materials, the removal of neutron 
absorbers, or by placing a neutron moderator or reflector (including a 
human body) near a system already close to criticality. 
If a possibility for nuclear excursion exists, CBRN R&S units should not 
attempt to handle, package, or transport the materials without first 
consulting technical experts, such as nuclear disablement teams, United 
States Army Nuclear and Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction 
Agency, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or Department of Energy. 
Indicators of a potential for excursion include the presence of plutonium 
or enrichment of uranium above natural levels (greater than 1 percent 
U-235).
Scenario 
A U.S. Army nuclear disablement team is tasked to exploit a spent nuclear fuel 
reprocessing site in order to determine the method, quality, and quantity of extracted 
plutonium-239 and uranium 235/238. The process being exploited relies on dilution for 
criticality control, and the process has been running without supervision for seven days 
(due to the evacuation of personnel by the adversarial host nation). See table F-30.

Note. Special consideration must be given to PPE requirements. This is especially relevant if the 
sampled chemicals are (or are suspected to be) fluorine-based, such as uranium hexafluoride and 
material dissolved in hydrofluoric acid. Most conventional PPE, especially over-garments and 
filters, do not provide adequate protection.

Steps 
Process 
1 
The assistant sampler removes all identified sample collection tools from kit and lays them out on clean ground 
tarp.  
2 
The assistant sampler opens protective packing and allows the sampler to remove the required tool. 
3 
The assistant sampler opens sterile inner sample vial assembly bag or sample jar bag and lays out on tarp. 
4 
The assistant sampler removes identification labels and affixes one label to the sample bag. 
5 
The assistant sampler (or recorder if using a three-person team) verifies that sample numbers match and 
affixes the other sample number label to sample log notebook. 
6 
The assistant sampler (or recorder if using a 3-person team) takes pictures of the sampling setup. 
7 
The assistant sampler opens inner sample container and hands to sampler. 
8 
The sampler carefully collects the sample so that the sample collection end of the tool touches nothing but the 
sample, and transfers it to the inner sample container. 
9 
(If analytic equipment utilized.) The sampler places a small amount of the collected material onto the chemical 
analysis equipment and begins analysis process. The sampler reads the results of the chemical analysis 
equipment to the recorder. 
10 
The sampler holds the inner sample container, when finished collecting the sample, while the assistant sampler 
puts on the cap. 
11 
The assistant sampler screws the cap on the inner sample container while the sampler holds the vial. 
12 
The assistant sampler removes decontamination wipe and gives it to the sampler. 
13 
The sampler decontaminates his hands and the inner sample container with the decontamination wipe. 
14 
The assistant sampler removes laboratory film from package; cuts enough to wrap once around the sample 
container top and gives it to the sampler. 
15 
The sampler uses the laboratory film to seal the cap to the inner sample container. 
16 
The assistant sampler holds outer sample container. 
17 
The sampler places the inner sample vial assembly into the outer sample container. Sampler announces 
“Sample XXX (sample sequence number) taken.” 
18 
The assistant sampler places the cap on the outer sample container, and places tamper seal tape over the 
outer sample vial or container cap (forming a seal that will be broken if the cap is removed) and places into 
secondary containment bag and seals the bag. Sample and secondary containment bag placed into a tertiary 
containment bag; resulting in three layers of containment. Assistant sampler announces “Sample XXX (sample 
sequence number) complete.” 
19 
The sample collection team members dispose of used sample collection equipment; remove nitrile gloves. 
20 
The outer sample package will be wipe tested before it passes through the decontamination line. If 
contamination is detected, the outer package will either be decontaminated or placed in another outer package, 
which will then be wipe tested. This process will continue until no contamination is detected. 
Note. Moisture can block alpha contamination–the outer sample bag must be dry when conducting this procedure. 
SOLID FISSILE MATERIAL SAMPLE 
F-76. This section addresses bulk solid fissile material, as opposed to powdered fissile material. By
definition, they are both solids; however, special considerations and sampling techniques exist for the
sampling and packaging of each, and thus they are treated separately. Sampling of solid fissile material, such
as fissile material pucks, weapon pits, or criticality testing special nuclear material hemispheres, is based off
of the grab technique, which is the basic and preferred collection technique in sample collection operations.
Grab sample collection is defined as a single sample that is removed at a single point in time from one area.
Additionally, the probability that such samples will be required as evidence in legal proceedings substantiates
this approach as the preferred technique. The steps in table F-34 provide example procedures for solid fissile
material sample collection.

Note. Moisture can block alpha contamination–the outer sample bag must be dry when conducting this procedure 
SECTION VIII – PACKAGING AND LABELING SAMPLES 
F-77. Packaging and labeling samples is as critical as the actual collection of the sample. All samples must
be packaged in three layers of containment to meet air transport regulations (primary container, secondary
container, and outer packaging). Package the primary container in absorbent material within a secondary
container, which is carried within an outer packaging or double-wrap or double-bag the primary container
for less hazardous samples. The label will be affixed to the sample container and will also be affixed to the
outermost package/container.
F-78. To prevent confusion, a sample identification number is assigned to the sample. The identification
number format should be established in theater sample management plans or SOPs and contain─

Date acquired. This six-digit numerical code represents the year, month, and day that the collector
took the sample.

Sample sequence number. The collector assigns this 3-digit numerical code. It begins anew each
collection day.

Sample collection unit identification or sampler identity code. This two to three digit code
represents the sample collection element or abbreviation of the sampler’s first and last name. (See
the examples below.)

F-79. There are several physical and chemical characteristics that must be considered when selecting a
suitable container for shipping and sample collection. Important characteristics include the container
material, size, shape, and sealing method. Generally, a container should be made of material that is chemically 
nonreactive with the sample and it should maintain physical integrity during normal handling and shipment.
The container must have sufficient volume to contain enough samples for all analyses required of the sample
and for several repeat analyses. It should have an opening that allows for easy filling and emptying of the
container and that minimizes external contamination of the container. All containers should be new and
unused. Containers should be able to be written on or able to have marking tags or labels affixed to them.
F-80. Depending on the sample media and the sample collection technique, the container selection must
protect the sample and avoid further contamination. Container considerations are—

Collection bags. A leakproof, clear, plastic collection bag can be used as the initial container for
samples, such as protective masks and filter canisters, individual antidote and decontamination
kits, ammunition fragments, and other items that are too large to place in a sample container. It
can also be used to package containers, which ensures a vapor barrier in case the container is
broken in transit. It acts as an initial or secondary vapor barrier that prevents air from leaking in
and toxic material from leaking out. The following are the recommended steps for using leakproof,
clear, plastic collection bags:

Step 1. Verify that the item has a command designated sample number if the sample or sample 
container is being packaged.

Step 2. Carefully place the sample in a bottom corner of the bag.

Step 3. Ensure that each layer of packaging is decontaminated using five percent chlorine
solution

Step 4. Purge air out of the bag and seal it.

Containers and tubes. Glass, spun Teflon®, or polypropylene sample containers and tubes can
be used for collection; however, do not store biological samples in polypropylene containers
because proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) may adhere to them. Use glass containers to
hold small environmental samples. Use sterile polypropylene tubes to hold biological samples if
no other alternative is available (such as glass). Use glass containers instead of plastic because
toxic agents may leach chemicals from plastics into a sample, introducing contamination and
complicating analysis efforts.

Shipping containers. Place samples in commercial, biohazard shipping containers for shipping.

Commercial air shipment containers. When the samples must be transported on commercial
aircraft, IATA-approved sample transport containers must be used for shipment and delivery to
the designated location.
Sample Collection and Processing 
31 March 2021 
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.9/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
F-49
F-81.  Samples submitted for analysis must be properly packaged, decontaminated, labeled, and shipped
so that they arrive in an analytically acceptable condition. The samples should be maintained at 1°C to 4°C.
Ideally, samples should arrive at the laboratory within six hours of collection. The samples should be
delivered to the NATO, theater designated laboratory, or CONUS laboratory within 24 to 48 hours. If the
biological samples cannot be delivered to NATO, theater designated laboratory, or CONUS within 48 hours,
the supporting laboratories should subculture the samples and send the subculture to the CONUS laboratory.
F-82. Standard polyethylene or metal ice chests are the most easily procured items that can be used to ship
chemical-biological samples. Even though an ice chest provides good insulation for samples and the coolant,
place extra insulation and cushioning around the metal cans inside the ice chest. Plastic bubble wrap or foam
rubber can be used with good results.
F-83. For double-bagging or double-wrapping, the plastic bags or plastic container containing the sample
should be placed into a second bag. Excess air should be removed from the bag. The sample bags should be
carried within an outer container packed with absorbent material.
F-84. Any breakable containers should be placed in more rigid containers to protect them from puncture or
breakage. Commercially manufactured packs, specifically designed for the transport of dangerous pathogens
and approved by the IATA, are widely available. The following should be considered when transporting
materials:

Material is placed in a securely closed, watertight container, which is then enclosed in a second,
durable, watertight container. Several primary containers may be enclosed in a single secondary
container, if the total volume of the primary containers enclosed does not exceed 50 milliliters.

Packaging of material in volumes of 50 milliliters or more will comply with specified requirements
based on the type of sample collected.
F-85. Supporting documents must accompany the sample with clear labeling on the outside of the package.
When samples are sent to a laboratory for theater validation or definitive identification, they must be properly 
packed and shipped to maintain security and chain-of-custody requirements. Evidence should be tagged at
the scene as it is collected or at the place where it is received by attaching a locally-produced adhesive label
or its equivalent. If evidence is placed in a heat sealed bag, the tag on the bag may replace the adhesive label.
Tagging, often referred to as a shoe tag may be used when labels disrupt the original state of evidence. In the
absence of tags or labels, ensure that supporting documentation, at a minimum, contains the information
shown in figure F-6, page F-52. To prevent confusion, the sampler uses the sample identification number
when referring to the sample or to information concerning its acquisition.
F-86. The following are steps for preparing a sample for shipment:

Step 1. Obtain the primary container that contains the sample.

Step 2. Mark the primary container with the sample identification number using an adhesive label
or by marking the container.

Step 3. Seal the primary container first with laboratory film, decontaminate, and then seal with
tamper-resistant tape. If applicable, apply two strips of tape across the top of the container in an
X-pattern ensuring that the tape reaches down both sides of the container. Ensure that the tape
covers a portion of the label on the container, but does not cover the sample identification number.

Step 4. Place the container inside a plastic bag or International Air Transport Association container
containing absorbent material. Decontaminate the container. If using a plastic bag, remove excess
air, twist the neck of the bag until it forms a tight coil with the bag snug around the container, and
seal it with a strip bag tie.

Step 5. Place an adhesive label containing the sample identification number on the International
Air Transport Association container or plastic bag.

Step 6. Place the tube inside a second bag or an International Air Transport Association container.
Decontaminate the second bag. If using a plastic bag, remove the excess air, twist the neck of the
second bag until it forms a tight coil, and seal it with a strip bag tie.

Step 7. Place an adhesive label containing the sample identification number on the outer
packaging.

Step 8. Place the package inside the sample transfer case.


Step 9. Complete the chain-of-custody document. Ensure that the operator handling the sample
signs the initial signature block immediately.
Note. After steps 3, 4, and 6, spray and wipe the package with a 5 percent hypochlorite solution. 
SECTION IX – SAMPLE TRANSFER EXECUTION 
F-87. In preparing for the execution of a sample evacuation, the commander prioritizes the samples that
should be evacuated with the help of the command surgeon and CBRN officer and staff. The commander
considers the following when determining the priority of samples:

What is the time sensitivity for a specific sample evacuation package?

Where the sample was collected (the proximity of transportation or courier assets for sample
transport)?

What is the role of the sample in the overall process of the operation (is it being used to support
detect to treat or verification of agent or release decisions)?

How many resources (consumables) are needed to support analysis and testing?
F-88. The personnel packaging, transporting, and storing samples must ensure the integrity of the sample
from the time it is first taken until it is delivered to the supporting laboratory. The temperature at which the
sample is stored and transported is crucial to its viability. Samples should be transported and stored at 1°C to
4°C. The sample courier should be able to periodically check the temperature within the sample transfer case
to ensure continued sample viability.
F-89. Designated samples are evacuated to laboratories for theater validation identification. Laboratories will
prioritize sample analyses based on critical background information (for example, time sensitivity and role
of the sample). The laboratory commander will determine the number and types of samples to be analyzed.
F-90. Sample evacuation execution relies on an effective means to evacuate the sample. Specialized assets
may be available; however, if specialized assets are not available, additional courier personnel can be trained
to perform escort responsibilities.
F-91. Sample evacuation packages from CBRN elements may require field confirmatory or theater validation 
identification support. The applicable Service component prepares the sample, and an escort element
transports the sample. The supporting medical and/or environmental laboratory destination for theater
validation testing could be a ship-based laboratory, United States Air Force laboratory, or United States Army
medical laboratory.
THEATER SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
F-92. The geographic combatant commander identifies a theater sample manager to manage the movement
of samples within theater and to definitive laboratories outside the theater based on feedback from the
geographic combatant commander command surgeon, CBRN staff, and supporting laboratories. The decision 
to return a sample to a CONUS definitive laboratory for further analysis is made by the field
confirmatory/theater validation laboratory, geographic combatant commander surgeon, theater commander,
and/or CONUS higher commands.
F-93. Before a CBRN sample is evacuated to a specific laboratory there are detailed requirements that must
be met. As discussed in chapter 1, the need to evacuate samples to fulfill the commander’s information and
PIRs will drive the sample management process. Proper identification of CBRN hazards affect decisions such
as the administration of effective prophylaxis, troop movements, individual and collective protective
postures, and selection of proper decontamination methods. These decisions are critical to the success of
operations in a CBRN environment. Issues to be considered prior to the movement of CBRN samples include
the following:

Coordinate actions with the theater surgeon or medical officer.

Ensure that proper chain-of-custody procedures are being followed.

Prioritize the transport and analysis of samples.

ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.9/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
F-51

Provide appropriately trained personnel or forces to escort samples to the transfer point or
laboratory.

Coordinate with the appropriate command and staff transportation authorities to help so that the
transport and transfer of a sample is uninterrupted across international borders or to another
government agency. The intent is unimpeded and controlled sample flow.

Evacuate background samples to a laboratory for analysis.

Maintain sample tracking and visibility.
CHAIN OF CUSTODY AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION 
F-94. A strict chain of custody needs to be initiated and maintained for every sample collected. When filled
out properly, the chain of custody provides uninterrupted chronological documentation of the collection,
custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of a sample. It provides a documented record of
information pertaining to a specific sample during transport from the point of collection, to the receiving
medical laboratory, to the final disposition of the sample. Individuals receiving a sample from another
individual or courier must sign the document transferring custody of the sample and then annotate in writing
what happened to the sample while in their custody. This includes the custody transfer that occurs when
supervision of the sample changes, such as the operator changes shifts. The document will provide answers
to the following questions about the sample:

When was it collected?

Who has maintained custody of it?

What has been done with it at each change of custody?

What was collected?

How much was collected?

How was it packaged?
F-95. The documents that support the evacuated sample are integral components of the evacuation package
and must accompany the sample. There is only one complete sample evacuation package for each sample.
DD Form 3108 captures important information regarding the conditions during the sample collection and
provides chain-of-custody tracking. Each completed sample evacuation package is comprised of the—

Sealed and packaged sample container.

Sealed document mailer.

Chain-of-custody form (the completed chain-of-custody form is hand-carried by the sample
courier). See figure F-6, page F-52, for a sample chain-of-custody DD Form 3108.

F-96. A complete history of the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of each sample must be
documented and provided to the analyzing agency. These documents should also accompany shipments to
the confirmatory laboratory. Critical information includes the—

Date and location. Provide the dated time group sample collected and the grid coordinate where
sample collected.

Reason for collection. Provide reason for collection such as routine surveillance, potential hazard,
known hazard, confirmation of attack. State the estimated length of time after the alleged incident
to when sample was taken.

Environmental conditions. Describe the terrain and meteorological conditions at the time of
sample collection and at the time of the alleged incident.

Other information. Describe any other information such as—

Circumstances of the acquisition. Describe how the sample was obtained and indicate the
source of the sample.

Physical description. Describe the physical state (solid, liquid, powder, viscosity), color,
approximate size, weight or volume, identity (military nomenclature, dirt, leaves), and dose
rate (if radiologically contaminated).

Circumstances of the agent deposition. Describe the type of delivery system; how the
system or weapon functioned; how the agent acted on release; sounds heard during
dissemination; a description of craters or shrapnel found associated with the burst; and colors
of smoke, flames, or mist that may be associated with the incident.

Agent effects on vegetation. Describe the general area (jungle, mountain, and grassland) and
changes in the vegetation after agent deposition (that is, color change, wilting, drying, and
dead) in the main incident and fringe areas.

Agent effects on humans. Describe how the agent affected personnel in the main incident
area versus the fringe areas; the duration of agent effects; peculiar odors that may have been
noticed in the area before, during, and after the incident; measures taken that alleviated or
worsened the effects; and the approximate number of fatalities and survivors (include age and
gender).

Agent effects on animals. Describe the types of animals that were and were not affected by
the incident and a description of how they were affected.
SPECIAL TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS 
F-97. Transporting of radioactive material requires the consideration of radiological, chemical, and tactical
factors. These factors to be considered include (but are not limited to) the following:

Does the sample (or do the samples) have to be transported, or can they be secured on-site?

Are there SMEs outside of the team that can be consulted (such as Department of Energy)?

Can appropriate radiation monitors be emplaced?

Can appropriate chemical monitors be emplaced?

What is the expected dose the transportation team is expected to receive? This expected dose must
be calculated for all mission phases, including loading, transport, and unloading of the material.

If the sample packaging is damaged during transport, will the resulting chemical interactions be a
risk to the transportation team or any other people in the area? If so, can the samples be segregated
onto different vehicles, based on potential chemical reactions?

Does the transportation team have the appropriate PPE?

Has special packaging and shielding been employed during sampling?

If so, are these containers safe from all directions (top, sides, and bottom) or only from one
direction, thus requiring transportation arrangements that maintain appropriate geometries?

What effect would rough handling have on the samples?

Can it/they withstand driving over rough terrain, enemy contact, and so forth, without posing a
radiation exposure concern?

How can risk to the transportation team be minimized?

F-56
ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.9/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 
31 March 2021 

If an incident that results in radiological contamination occurs, how will this affect the routes,
airfields, etc. being used?

For example, could radiological contamination close vital MSRs, contaminate an airfield, or
inhibit maneuver forces? This assessment must include staging areas, routes, and temporary rest
areas.

What is the consequences if the transport vehicle falls into enemy hands? For example, if highly
radioactive samples are transported on the same vehicle, would the capture of this vehicle by
enemy forces enable the enemy to quickly produce a radiation dispersal device? Can, or should,
the load be divided into multiple convoys or lifts?

Is it possible for the transportation team, which are unlikely to be radiation SMEs, to deliver the
samples without SME support?

In other words, can the transportation team safely load, transport, and unload the samples without
requiring additional skillsets?

Are reacting to radiological incident procedures known and rehearsed by the transport team?

Is the transportation team and higher-level medical personnel prepared to handle casualties from
radiological exposure?

Are there intermediate / temporary storage facilities where the samples will be housed? If so, does
the storage facility have expertise on the storage/handling of radiological material, including the
ability to calculate expected accumulated dose and keep that dose ALARA and to assess the effects
of any chemical reactions that could occur?
SAMPLE ESCORT TEAMS 
F-98. A sample escort team is comprised of a minimum of 2 personnel to maintain proper chain of custody,
one of whom will be designated the team leader. At a minimum, one team member must be certified in the
following:

Certified in AMMO-62, Technical Transportation of Hazardous Materials, is required if samples
contain hazardous materials (for example, CBRN agents, precursors, or contaminated materials).

Certified in AMMO-67, Hazardous Materials Familiarization and Safety in Transportation, is
required if samples contain munitions or explosives.
F-99. The sample escort team is responsible for recognizing, detecting, responding to, and mitigating any
leaks or other hazards discovered during transit. The team must be prepared to conduct emergency procedures
to prevent loss, theft, or capture of materials during transit.
F-100. All samples will be accompanied by the appropriate paperwork, including a Shippers Declaration
for Dangerous Goods and chain of custody (DD Form 3108). The aircraft loadmaster may request a copy of
the HAZMAT training certification.
MONITORING EQUIPMENT, PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, AND DECONTAMINATION 
F-101. Monitoring equipment that is capable of detecting the transported material will be carried and used
by the sample escort team. Each member of the sample team, to include security personnel, will carry
adequate PPE.
F-102. For samples for which conventional PPE (for example, Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit
Technology and M50 protective mask) provides adequate protection, each supplying unit will supply their
own members with PPE. If specialized PPE (non- Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology and
M50 protective mask) is required to protect personnel, it will be provided by the unit who collected the
sample.
F-103. Decontamination assets (equipment, chemicals, and so forth) that can mitigate spills and other
potential hazards of the escorted substance will be on-hand with the escort team during transport.

disciplines, observing an assigned NAI, can use a series of observed events to support confirmation/denial of
a PIR in conjunction with the joint ISR enterprise.
G-2. Observation of the pattern of life of enemy forces on an assigned NAI provides additional nuance and
detail to support analysis beyond observation for only brief periods of time.
ENVIRONMENTAL CBRN INDICATORS 
G-3. The following are environmental indicators of CBRN activities or hazard: 

Dead animals, animals exhibiting unusual symptoms.

Discarded CBRN protective equipment.

Personnel suddenly exhibiting runny nose, salivation, miosis (pinpointed pupils), difficulty
breathing, vomiting, convulsion, blistering, hoarseness, or a hacking cough.

Dead personnel without conventional wounding (bullet, blast, fragmentation, incendiary).
ENEMY ACTIVITY INDICATORS 
G-4. The following enemy activities are potential indicators of a CBRN attack:

Increase in CBRN protection.

Vacating areas templated for enemy CBRN strike.

Increased meteorological surveys in conjunction with enemy fires observers or reconnaissance.

Movement of additional support personnel for CBRN weapon systems. Observation of personnel,
including ranks, unit insignia on uniforms or vehicles, and the specific equipment of observed
enemy forces will support analysis to answer multiple PIRs, including those related to enemy
CBRN capability, activities, or intent.
CHEMICAL AGENT PRODUCTION OR HANDLING INDICATORS 
G-5. The following items and systems are potential indicators of chemical agent production or handling:

Chemical process stations. Chemical process stations are systems made by the arrangement of
industrial or improvised chemical production devices to produce a desired chemical product.
Chemical processes include synthesis, distillation, reflux, separation, extraction, and filtration.

Chemical production equipment. Chemical production equipment may be industrial or
improvised. Chemical production equipment includes heating mantles, cooling baths, grinders,
centrifuges, glassware (flasks, funnels, cylinders, beakers), and accessories such as measuring
devices, industrial vacuums, and modular piping and clamp arrays to facilitate use of glassware.
Production equipment may range from process-specific industrial scale facilities to improvised,

BILOGICAL AGENT PRODUCTION OR HANDLING INDICATORS 
G-7. The following items and systems are potential indicators of biological agent production or handling:
biological process stations, biological production equipment, and biological media, cultures and packaging.
G-8. Biological process stations are made by the arrangement of industrial, laboratory, or improvised
systems to allow the growth, harvesting, and final processing of a selected bacteria or virus. Biological
process used in the production of biological warfare agent include incubation, fermentation,
harvesting/drying, filtration, milling, and areosolization.
G-9. Biological production equipment may be industrial or improvised. Biological production equipment
includes agar or growth medias, petri dishes, fermenters, bioreactors, incubators, grinders, filters, glassware
(flasks, funnels, cylinders, beakers), and accessories such as measuring devices, industrial vacuums, and
modular piping and clamp arrays to facilitate use of glassware. Like chemical agent processes, biological
production equipment may range from process-specific industrial scale facilities to improvised, clandestine
facilities made of repurposed kitchen and food storage items. Figures G-4, G-5, and G-6, pages G-4 and
G-5, provide examples of equipment for biological production.

WEAPON AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS 
G-10. CBRN munitions may be marked with a combination of red, yellow, green, white, black bands, and
stripes. They may contain nerve, blister, choking, blood, vomiting or riot control agents, and they may differ
very little in appearance from conventional munitions. Common attributes of CBRN munitions include fill
ports or plugs, and bursting charges to disperse CBRN agent. When tactically feasible, suspected CBRN
munitions be examined and photographed to enable technical and weapons intelligence teams to provide
more thorough analysis. See figure G-7 and figure G-8, page G-6, for examples of chemical munitions.
G-11. Identification of the specific weapons systems ranging from ballistic missiles or long-range artillery to
tactical mortar systems are equipped with CBRN weapons will often require the collaboration of multiple
intelligence collection efforts. CBRN R&S elements operating in assigned NAIs must be familiar with
relevant threat weapon systems, including artillery, multiple-launch rocket system, and missile platforms and
the enemy’s supporting C2 and joint ISR activities, capabilities, and systems.
