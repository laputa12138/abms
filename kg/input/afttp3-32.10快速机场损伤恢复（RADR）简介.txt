Chapter 1 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. Overview. The ability to conduct uncontested aerial warfare and airlift 
operations within proximity to the theater of operations has been, until recently, 
an assumed ability—this assumption is no longer valid in all potential joint 
mission scenarios. This assumed ability becomes increasingly invalid as potential 
adversaries continue to increase their long range offensive capabilities. Joint 
forces will conduct operations in the face of significant anti-access area denial 
weapons, and the United States Air Force will be required to support combat sortie 
generation within this environment. Accordingly, the ability to repair aircraft 
operating surfaces after an anti-access area denial attack is crucial. 
 
1.1.1. Rapid Airfield Damage Recovery (RADR) is an essential element of 
enabling air base resiliency and continuation of airfield operations to ensure the 
rapid projection and application of United States military power around the globe. 
RADR encompasses all actions required to rapidly repair aircraft operating 
surfaces and localized infrastructure to recover operations at an airfield after 
attack, whether the airfield is offered for use by a host nation or established as a 
United States operating location. 
 
1.1.2. Preplanning should consider the scalability of the RADR capability to 
support the Combatant Commander’s (CCDR) critical needs at various airfield 
locations as RADR operations may differ by airfield and aircraft configurations. 
 
1.1.3. RADR may be conducted under multiple conditions such as non-permissive 
environments, all weather conditions, chemical, biological, radiological and in a 
degraded environment. 
 
1.1.4. RADR forces, equipment, and operational concepts should be identified in 
the appropriate annex and attachments to the Installation Emergency Management 
Plan 10-2 and in other installation response plans for post-attack activities. See 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
7 
 
 
Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 10-2501 for more information on 
the Installation Emergency Management Plan 10-2. 
 
1.1.5. RADR is only one phase of recovery after an attack, which is only one 
function within Airfield Damage Repair (ADR). In addition to RADR, which 
rapidly establishes a minimum airfield operating surface (MAOS), other recovery 
phases include: MAOS sustainment, MAOS expansion, and reconstitution of the 
airfield. This AFTTP focuses only on RADR operations. 
 
1.2. Integration of Overlapping Phases. After an attack on the airfield, hundreds 
of craters, camouflets, spalls, and various quantities of unexploded explosive 
ordnance (UXO) could be expected. RADR capability requires multiple critical 
tasks be accomplished with seamless integration. These are often accomplished 
within overlapping and simultaneous timeframes; otherwise, there is risk of 
failing to meet time compression goals while keeping attrition of recovery 
personnel, equipment, and vehicles within the CCDR’s acceptable levels. These 
tasks include rapid airfield damage assessment, rapid mitigation of explosive 
hazards, and rapid repair of damaged surfaces and critical infrastructure. Effective 
damage assessment enables engineers to identify, assess, and analyze airfield 
damage and hazards. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel must then 
mitigate the identified explosive hazards on the access routes, equipment and 
material staging areas, and the selected MAOS. Finally, once explosive hazards 
within repair areas are mitigated, teams begin repairing the MAOS and associated 
critical infrastructure. 
 
1.3. Scalability. Due to various installations, threats, and missions, RADR 
capabilities are adaptive and scalable; a one-size, one-solution RADR capability 
will not support this broad spectrum. RADR capabilities can support thousands of 
combat sorties for all airframes, provide temporary to semi-permanent repair 
options in all pavement conditions, and support employ-in-place and 
expeditionary capabilities. 
 
1.4. Capability. RADR equipment, material, personnel, and vehicles necessary 
to recover an airfield following an attack are similar to those required for airfield 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
8 
 
 
opening and operation. However, airfield recovery likely requires far more assets 
in order to reestablish flying operations during day or night within acceptable 
timeframes. These capabilities are tailored to address specific installation or threat 
requirements. Commanders must be cognizant that RADR capabilities are directly 
impacted by attrition, environmental conditions, the chemical, biological, 
radiological and nuclear environment, and threat environment.  
 
1.4.1. The RADR capability establishes a MAOS, including a Minimum 
Operating Strip (MOS) up to 150 ft. x 10,000 ft., and associated taxiways, ramps, 
access routes, and critical infrastructure. The resulting durable repairs provide an 
acceptable number of passes for any combination of US aircraft types before 
requiring sustainment maintenance. 
 
1.4.2. As previously stated, RADR consists of three overlapping and 
interdependent phases: 
 
1.4.2.1. Rapid Damage Assessment to identify and characterize the damage and 
hazards.  
 
1.4.2.2. Rapid Explosive Hazard Mitigation (REHM) to neutralize UXO within 
and in close proximity to repair zones. 
 
1.4.2.3. Rapid Damage Repair (RDR) to repair selected pavement damage and 
establish the MAOS. Each phase is critical to the RADR capability with the 
coordinated REHM and RDR phases conducted concurrently to maximize time 
compression. 
 
1.5. Rapid Damage Assessment. This phase focuses on collecting and analyzing 
data to determine the presence of hazards and overall airfield condition to include 
the number, location and type of craters, UXO, and other damage characteristics 
such as camouflets (cavities formed from a deep underground burst with minimal 
surface rupture) and spalls (surface damage which does not penetrate the 
pavement base course). Assessment is accomplished using a combination of 
manual and automated data collection systems. Automated systems reduce the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
9 
 
 
UXO threat to Airmen and the assessment timeline. Data collected during this 
phase is used to select the most appropriate MAOS to repair (see AFTTP 3-32.12, 
Minimum Airfield Operating Surface (MAOS) Selection and Repair Quality 
Criteria (RQC), for MAOS selection procedures). Airfield damage assessment 
procedures are described in AFTTP 3-32.11, Airfield Damage Assessment after 
Attack. 
 
1.6. Rapid Explosive Hazards Mitigation (REHM). Expedient recovery of 
airfields requires an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) capability that can 
effectively remove hazards associated with UXO prior to the start of repairing 
aircraft operating surfaces and repairing damaged infrastructure. EOD technicians 
support RADR by removing, rendering safe, or detonating UXO impacting the 
recovery process. A family of UXO assessment and mitigation tools, platforms, 
and systems provides EOD technicians the capability to safely and rapidly 
mitigate the UXO threat. These platforms and systems, operated (or supervised) 
by EOD personnel, allow surface and subsurface UXO positive identification, 
neutralization, collection, removal, and ultimate disposal on and off the airfield 
operating surfaces, access routes, and equipment and material staging areas. See 
AFTTP 3-32.5V10, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Rapid Airfield Damage 
Recovery (RADR) And Explosive Hazards Mitigation (EHM), for general 
guidance on planning, training, equipping, and developing policy for RADR and 
recovery of airbases denied by ordnance (RADBO) directed energy operations. 
 
1.6.1. Process. UXO mitigation within the RADR program is allotted sixty 
minutes from reception of the MAOS candidate to the recovery crews starting 
restoration activities. This includes team and material staging areas, convoy 
routes, and repair zones. Mitigation activities continue to clear the remaining 
threats to the MAOS throughout the entire recovery process. 
 
1.6.2. REHM Capabilities. REHM is a family of systems and techniques used to 
locate, identify, and mitigate UXO threats. Each capability is packaged as a Unit 
Type Code (UTC). 
 
1.6.2.1. Manned Operations: 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
10 
 
 
 
1.6.2.1.1. Commonly known as blow-and-gos or in-and-outs. Blow and go 
involves walking a sweep line while setting charges to clear the maximum amount 
of ground rapidly. In and outs involves deliberately setting charges in sweep line 
and then initiating those charges while exiting the area.  The primary 
consideration when choosing between the two is the safe area location in relation 
to the starting point.  This process uses other munitions to detonate the extremely 
small UXO. This process creates a spall per mitigated munition.   
 
1.6.2.1.2. Multiple techniques for removing ordnance from the runway exist.  The 
most common of these is using rope or chain as a drag line to move the ordnance 
while maintaining a safe standoff during the move.  These techniques require 
much more time than the explosive or heavy equipment methods, but still have a 
role. 
 
1.6.2.2. 4F9RD EOD Recovery of Airbases Denied by Ordnance (RADBO) 
Vehicle: Large tactical vehicle with a laser. Intent is to eliminate small UXO by 
forcing a low-order detonation. 
 
1.6.2.3. Mass Mechanical Clearance (MMC): 
 
1.6.2.3.1. EOD personnel will be the primary operators of the MMC vehicles. 
Other licensed operators can be used to augment the driver pool. However, a 
qualified EOD person should manage the MMC team due to their knowledge of 
the UXO hazards. Driver augmentees should be provided additional UXO 
familiarization by EOD personnel upon selection. 
 
1.6.2.3.2. 4F9XL EOD REHM Loader and Large Clearance Blade Assembly. A 
front-end loader with a specialized blade attached to the front of the vehicle. The 
blade is designed to protect the operator from blast and fragmentation hazards 
when pushing bomblet sized munitions to the side of the MAOS without causing 
detonations or additional damage to the runway. Munitions are to be mitigated at 
a later date or when time permits. This UTC is currently being fielded. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
11 
 
 
1.6.2.4. Munitions Reval Team (MRT). MRT can be formed to augment the EOD 
team. Once EOD has rendered safe a UXO for transport, the bomb removal team 
lifts, secures, and transports the UXO to a predetermined safe holding area. A 
MRT should be considered if the local threat includes larger ordnance items such 
as aircraft bombs or missiles. 
 
1.6.2.4.1. Equipment commonly used for the MRT task are dump trucks and Front 
End Loaders (FEL). Both vehicles and heavy equipment should be reinforced with 
sandbags or sand to help cushion the UXO and provide protection in case of an 
inadvertent detonation. 
 
1.6.2.4.2. Operators do not have to be engineers since Civil Engineer (CE) will 
more than likely be stretched to the limit. To the greatest extent possible, 
personnel should be volunteers from the installation augmentation pool. See 
AFTTP 3-32.5V10 for instructions on properly marking ordnance for the MRT. 
 
1.6.2.4.3. The MRT will be trained by EOD personnel in accordance with AFTTP 
3-32.5V10 during pre-attack actions. 
 
1.6.3. Stockpiling/Marking. All munitions left adjacent to the MAOS must be 
dealt with as both debris and as an explosive hazard. 
 
1.6.3.1. Small and medium munitions must be pushed at least 30-ft from the edge 
of the MAOS, and piled no higher than 36-in. However, due to the risk of 
explosion; the munitions are not to be pushed off the paved surfaces. Note: This 
may affect the MAOS selection process in that the pavement may be reserved for 
stockpiled munitions. 
 
1.6.3.2. EOD personnel will dictate the number of munitions allowed to be in a 
single stockpile and the separation of the stockpiles. These calculations are based 
on the combined net explosive weight of the piled munitions. The UXO should 
be collected either on one side of the paved surface or on designated taxiways. 
This decision should be made in conjunction with the MAOS selection team. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
12 
 
 
1.6.3.3. Each UXO stockpile will be marked with survey tape to highlight the piles 
containing UXO and not just debris. Marking materials are being added to the 
4FWCR, Crater Repair Vehicle UTC. The marking kit will be stored in the tool 
trailer and consist of plastic buckets, a marking rod, and survey tape. Until fielded, 
the survey tape can be attached to something within or near the stockpile. Note: 
For more guidance on REHM procedures see AFTTP 3-32.5V10. 
 
1.7. Rapid Damage Repair Phase. Once the explosive hazard threat has been 
sufficiently mitigated in a repair zone, RDR teams begin repairing craters, 
camouflets, spalls, and other damage impeding flying operations on the MAOS. 
In some scenarios, hundreds of craters could require repair within acceptable time 
frames to meet the commander’s Air Tasking Order. This requires multiple teams, 
each using an assembly line process to achieve repair objectives. Where logistics 
supply/resupply cannot support the repair in a timely manner, repair capabilities 
are prepositioned.  
 
1.7.1. Optimized techniques and advanced, rapid-setting materials are used to 
minimize the Mean Time to Repair for both asphalt-concrete and Portland Cement 
Concrete (PCC) surfaces. Materials and procedures provide pavement repair 
supporting the range and intensity of joint aircraft traffic required to meet 
airpower objectives. Rapid crater repair processes are listed below. See AFTTP 
3-32.17, Rapid Airfield Crater and Spall Repair, for detailed descriptions of the 
damage repair processes that follow. 
 
1.7.1.1. Debris Removal. This process clears debris at least 15 feet from around 
each crater to allow subsequent processes to proceed. After debris is removed 
from around each crater, it is then pushed at least 30 feet from the edge of the 
MAOS.  
 
1.7.1.2. Upheaval Determination and Marking. The explosion from munitions 
hitting the runway creates upheaved pavement around the crater. Upheaved 
pavement is not always visible to the eye; therefore, upheaval determination is 
accomplished through crater profile measurements to ensure all damaged 
pavement is identified and removed. Unremoved upheaval will most likely fail 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
13 
 
 
under traffic and create foreign object debris (FOD) hazards. Conversely, 
removing more pavement than necessary increases repair times and uses more 
repair material than necessary, possibly depleting repair material before all repairs 
are complete. Identify extent of upheaval as described in Technical Order (T.O.) 
35E2-5-1, Crushed-Stone Crater Repair and Line-of-Sight Profile Measurement 
for Rapid Runway Repair for craters with an apparent size of 20 feet in diameter 
or larger (Note: Marks should form square or rectangle pavement cut marks). Use 
procedures in AFTTP 3-32.17 when apparent crater size is less than 20 feet in 
diameter. 
 
1.7.1.3. Pavement Cutting. In regard to time, pavement cutting is the most critical 
step in the repair process. Two compact track loaders (CTL) with wheel saw 
attachments cut pavement around craters by following the marks created during 
the upheaval marking process. The conventional walk behind concrete saw may 
be required in conjunction with the wheel saws when dowels or rebar are in the 
saw path. 
 
1.7.1.4. Pavement Breaking and Excavation. This process includes breaking the 
damaged pavement within the cut lines with an excavator and hammer attachment 
and removing the disturbed subsurface material from the repair using a separate 
excavator with a bucket attachment. The Debris Removal Crew assists with 
removing the excavated debris from the MAOS. 
 
1.7.1.5. Backfilling Repair. This process utilizes a medium strength, high 
viscosity, excavatable, rapid-setting, cementitious backfill material, known as 
flowable fill, in place of traditional crushed stone. Prior to capping the repair with 
PCC, the repair is backfilled with flowable fill using the dry placement technique 
commonly known as “slash and splash.” This is accomplished by suspending a 
3,000 pound super sack of flowable fill over the excavated area, “slashing” the 
bottom of the sack to release the material into the repair, and then “splashing” the 
backfill with 50 gallons of water until reaching the prescribed depth. The process 
for backfilling beneath an asphalt cap is accomplished with the same flowable fill 
material but mixed with a volumetric mixer and using a wet placement technique.  
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
14 
 
 
Note: Crushed stone may be used in lieu of flowable fill; however, additional 
time, equipment, and personnel may be required to haul, place, and compact the 
stone. 
 
1.7.1.6. Capping Repair. Capping material should match the existing material, but 
when material is short or when a team is repairing craters in both existing PCC 
and Asphalt-Concrete, mix-matching capping material and existing material is 
allowable; however, life expectancy of the repairs may be diminished. A concrete 
cap is placed using the volumetric mixer and a rapid-setting concrete mix 
provided in 3,000 pound super sacks. The asphalt cap is placed with asphalt 
produced by the asphalt recyclers and compacted with rollers. 
 
Note: Airfield Matting (AM-2) may be used as a cap on aprons and taxiways, 
with the exception of high-speed taxiways and intersections. Fiber-reinforced 
Polymer (FRP) mat panels may be used as a cap depending on the aircraft type, 
operations, and location on the airfield. Use of these materials as caps may require 
additional monitoring and maintenance and will also require additional backfill 
materials. Furthermore, they will not be as durable as asphalt or Concrete caps. 
 
1.7.1.7. Spall Repair. Spalls are defined as pavement damage that does not 
penetrate the full pavement thickness to the underlying base course, is not larger 
than five feet in diameter, and does not cause upheaval in surrounding pavements. 
Thousands of spalls will be expected after an attack with possibly hundreds 
requiring repairs. Spalls are expediently repaired by first removing debris and 
loose material from in and around them. Then, place rapid setting repair material 
in the spalls ensuring the final repair is level with the surrounding pavement. 
 
1.7.2. Foreign object debris is removed from the MAOS by scraping, sweeping, 
and vacuuming all surfaces until accepted by Airfield Operations. As needed, 
airfield marking, aircraft arresting systems, and airfield lighting teams work 
simultaneously to restore required capability.

Chapter 2 
 
POSTURING RAPID AIRFIELD DAMAGE RECOVERY (RADR) 
CAPABILITIES 
 
2.1. Overview. RADR capabilities are scalable and modular and postured as 
primary and enabler UTCs. The baseline RADR capability (4FWCR) provides the 
tools, equipment, and vehicles to repair 18 small craters (8.5 ft x 8.5 ft x 2 ft), or 
two large craters (30 ft x 30 ft x 2 ft), within 6.5 hours utilizing flowable fill and 
rapid-setting concrete, or flowable fill and asphalt materials, depending upon the 
parent surface. Capabilities are typically considered “employ-in-place” UTCs and 
postured primarily as Medium (4FWCR x 3), Large (4FWCR x 5), or Very Large 
(4FWCR x 7) capabilities depending upon the local threat. In addition to the 
4FWCR UTC, supporting UTCs (i.e. 4FWFD-FOD Removal, 4FWWH-
Warehouse Operations, 4FWAE-Asphalt Batch Plant, and 4FWSR-Spall Repair) 
are required to provide the full RADR capability. 
 
2.1.1. While the smallest capability is known as the “Small Capability,” the name 
is somewhat a misnomer. The Small Capability has a fairly large footprint 
requiring approximately 93 personnel, 47 vehicles, and associated equipment and 
tools to execute the full capability. 
 
2.1.2. If an expeditionary airfield recovery capability is desired, the Small 
Capability may be tailored to meet requirements. Transportation requirements can 
be considerably reduced if repair materials (i.e. crushed stone, PCC, asphalt, rapid 
setting concrete, or flowable fill) are available at the deployed location.  
 
Note: If flowable fill, rapid-setting concrete, and/or asphalt materials are depleted, 
legacy repair materials (i.e., crushed stone, FOD covers) are utilized to complete 
repairs. 
 
2.2. Vehicle UTCs. Vehicles listed in Table 2.1 will normally be postured at 
installations with a required RADR capability (some major commands/combatant 
commanders [CCDRs] may centrally store assets). In accordance with AFI 24-
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
16 
 
 
302, Vehicle Management, vehicles within RADR UTCs are considered War 
Reserve Materiel (WRM) assets; however, with coordination with the 441 Vehicle 
Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) some may be assigned to the CE 
unit as joint-use assets for normal day-to-day shop use.  
 
2.3. Crater Repair Equipment. The equipment listed in Table 2.2 will be 
postured at applicable installations with a particular RADR capability. Equipment 
is considered WRM assets, but some may be assigned to the CE unit as joint-use 
assets for normal day-to-day shop use.

Note: Spall Repair Crew(s) requires a truck(s) to haul personnel, repair 
material and tools, but is not included in the RADR vehicle UTCs. A 
dedicated vehicle(s) from the installation vehicle fleet should be identified for 
the spall crew(s) prior to commencement of hostilities (this situation holds true 
for the aircraft arresting system, airfield lighting, airfield marking, and water 
and fuel system repair teams). 
 
Note: At the time of this writing, some volumetric mixers have experienced seized 
water pumps while stored in WRM. Recommend full operational test of all units 
before accepting from WRM. If pump is seized, WRM maintenance personnel 
should perform corrective action by disassembling pump, replacing the shear pin, 
and lubricating all lubrication points.

Note: Installations should stockpile appropriate quantities (depending on the 
RADR capability) of choke ballast, crushed stone, and sand. 
 
2.5. Spall Repair Kit (4FWSR). The Spall Repair Kit contains all necessary tools 
and material in three shipping containers (8-ft L x 6.5-ft W x 8-ft H) to 
expeditiously repair up to 200 spalls with an average size of 24-inches in diameter 
and 6-inches deep. Provide one 4FWSR per every 4FWCR tasked. A vehicle is 
required, but not provided in UTC (see AFTTP 3-32.18, Rapid Airfield Damage 
Recovery Warehouse and Ground Transportation Operations). 
 
2.6. Ramp and Taxiway Expansion (4FWAM). Provides AM-2 matting, 
specialized components and assembly tools to cover damaged pavement and/or 
semi-improved airfield surfaces to expand/create a 216-ft x 198-ft aircraft parking 
apron or a 72-ft x 200-ft taxiway (taxiway is limited to this distance due to limited 
number of six foot panels). This capability consists of 98 bundles of 12-ft x 2-ft 
AM-2 mat, and six bundles of 6-ft x 2-ft mat, eight ramp assembly kits (a bundle 
contains nine ramp ends), one cruciform stake kit (56 stakes and edge clamps per 
kit), three Y-connector kits (36 Y-connectors per kit), one keylock kit (63 12-ft 
starter and typical keylocks per kit), one pavement anchor kit (400 concrete 
expansion bolts and tri-talon earth anchors, and 84 five-gallon buckets of rapid-
set grout), one AM-2 tool component chest. This capability facilitates expansion 
of airfield operating surfaces.  
 
2.7. AM-2 FOD Cover (4FWFC). Provides AM-2 matting, specialized 
components and tools to assemble and cover 31 each 10-ft craters, nine 15-ft 
craters, or three 30-ft craters. Package consists of nine bundles of 12-ft x 2-ft mat, 
11 bundles of 6-ft x 2-ft mat, 14 ramp assembly kits (nine ramp ends per kit), one 
pavement anchor kit (400 expansion bolts and tri-talon earth anchors, and 84 five-
gallon bucket of rapid-set grout), one AM-2 tool/component kit, and one AM-2 
tow kit.  
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
21 
 
 
Note: Combining one 4FWFC with one 4FWAM will allow construction of a 72-
ft x 612-ft taxiway and combining two 4FWFCs with one 4FWAM will allow 
construction of a 72-ft x 780-ft or 54-ft x 1008-ft taxiway. 
 
2.8. Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Matting FOD Cover (4FWFR). Each kit 
provides matting and tools capable of providing a FOD cover for twenty 10-ft 
craters, three 30-ft craters, or one large crater up to 50-ft diameter. The kit includes 
35 full-size panels, 30 half-size panels, 15 full-size anchor panels, 20 half-size 
anchor panels, 760 lower joining bushings, 875 upper joining bushings, and 625 
anchor bushings. 
 
Note: The use of FRP may not be compatible with some aircraft or operations. 
 
2.9. Asphalt Batching. Asphalt batching requires space for storing asphalt 
products (i.e. asphalt cookie stockpiles or reclaimed asphalt pavement [RAP]), 
operational space for two recyclers, and space to load dump trucks. If batching 
occurs indoors (e.g., inside a hangar) during inclement weather, provide proper 
ventilation. See AFTTP 3-32.19, Rapid Airfield Damage Recovery-Asphalt Batch 
Plant Operations, for more information on batching asphalt. 
 
2.10. Warehouse. In the context of RADR, the term warehouse (and warehouse 
operations) relates to the process, not a physical space. See AFTTP 3-32.18, Rapid 
Airfield Damage Recovery Warehouse and Ground Transportation Operations, 
for a complete description of warehouse operations. 
 
2.10.1. Warehouse operations require semi-prepared areas, not actual facilities. 
Flowable fill and rapid-set super sacks are delivered to WRM in containers that 
may be double-stacked and centrally stored or dispersed. Stockpile(s) of 
traditional repair materials (i.e., crushed stone and choke ballast) should be 
located within seven minutes driving time to the runway. 
 
2.10.2. When indications and warnings are observed, containers are unstacked (if 
applicable), dispersed within 7 minutes driving time to the airfield, and laid out to 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
22 
 
 
support recovery operations. Once the containers are unloaded, they may be 
arranged to provide splinter protection for high priority assets. 
 
2.10.3. Asphalt batching can be located near, or next to, warehouse operations to 
facilitate movement of hot mixed asphalt to the repair area via dump trucks.  
 
2.11. Dispersal Areas. When RADR assets are released from WRM and placed 
in an operational configuration, several points should be considered: 
 
Note: WRM long term storage locations should not be confused with RADR asset 
dispersal areas. As determined by the Installation WRM Manager, RADR assets 
residing within WRM during peacetime will most likely be stored in existing base 
supply consolidated storage locations, or CE storage areas if WRM space is an 
issue. In accordance with AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM), the 
Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander, or equivalent, will assist in 
development and execution of plans to move WRM when threat of attack is 
heightened, or an attack is imminent, including movement to dispersed 
operational locations.  
 
2.11.1. Dispersal and operating locations should be congruent with defense 
sectors, road barrier plans, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear zones, 
etc. 
 
2.11.2. Dispersal areas should be relatively level, but slightly sloped to provide 
adequate drainage. Storing loaded shipping containers on uneven surfaces may 
cause damage to contents or injury to personnel when opening and unloading 
containers.  
 
2.11.3. The area should be at least semi-prepared to prevent standing water and 
muddy conditions.  
 
2.11.4. Single capabilities should be stored in multiple locations for survivability 
purposes (i.e., FOD assets dispersed in multiple locations). 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
23 
 
 
2.11.5. At locations with greater than a small capability, a single Crater Repair 
Team may be staged together since other teams replicate this capability. 
 
2.11.6. Maximize materiel shipping containers as splinter protection for dispersed 
equipment, materials, and vehicles. 
 
2.11.7. Staging areas are not more than seven minutes driving time from the 
airfield, with a primary and alternate route pre-identified. 
 
2.11.8. Equipment and materials are preloaded/attached (i.e., water tanks filled, 
attachment and warehouse trailers loaded, 2 of 3 dump trucks per warehouse 
loaded with crushed stone). Fill volumetric mixer’s water tanks, but do not load 
material until repair types (i.e., concrete or asphalt cap) are assigned following 
MAOS selection. 
 
2.12. Water Storage. Flowable fill and rapid-setting concrete perform best when 
mixed with water between 70 and 80°F. Indoor storage or mechanical heating 
devices may be required to keep water at this temperature. During winter 
operations maintain the water temperature above 50°F to avoid the need for 
accelerants or longer cure times. 
 
2.13. Water and Fuel Expedient Repair System (WaFERS) Overview. 
WaFERS is a modular and scalable set of capability-based UTCs configured to 
enable expedient repair or recovery of mission essential water and fuel 
distribution systems. Repair and recovery capability includes but is not limited to 
pipe repair and bypass; valves/manifold repair and bypass; hydrant capping; 
storage tank patching; fuel or water pumping; fuel filtering, and fuel storage. The 
UTCs may standalone or may be combined to provide sufficient repair capability 
and restore water or fuel system operations. The modularity and scalability of 
WaFERS also allows individualization or selection based on the installation’s 
unique infrastructure and required specific contingency support planning. Input 
and output connection points for all modules are standardized to a pre- existing 
Department of Defense (DOD) configuration and allow for the use of quick-
connect type fittings and couplers to the maximum extent possible.

COMMAND AND CONTROL 
 
3.1. Overview. Effective Command and Control (C2) is critical to recover an 
airfield as effectively and rapidly as possible. RADR C2 occurs at four distinct, 
yet interrelated, echelons: 1) the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), 2) Civil 
Engineer Unit Control Center (CE-UCC), 3) repair material stockpiles/storage 
locations (warehouse) and asphalt production locations located near the airfield, 
and 4) repair teams on the airfield. The organizational structure shown in Figure 
3.1 is recommended to orchestrate the RADR process. Note: Each Crater Repair 
Team includes and controls one spall repair crew. 
 
Figure 3.1. RADR Command and Control Overview. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
25 
 
 
3.2. Communications Flow. Although RADR is performed by many specialized 
teams (e.g., Crater Repair, FOD Removal, Marking, and Lighting), teams are very 
codependent; personnel and equipment are shared between teams  and often teams 
contend for the same space on the MAOS; therefore, close coordination between 
all teams is critical. Figure 3.2 illustrates the communications flow required to 
effectively manage RADR operations once repairs commence.

3.3. Communications Equipment. The Engineer UTC 4F9ER supports 
communication requirements for RADR. Table 3.1 identifies the recommended 
number and type of radios for RADR operations. Figure 4.2 identifies 
recommended positions that should have radios during RADR operations. 
 
Note: See AFPAM 10-219V3, Civil Engineer Contingency Response and 
Recovery Procedures, for using alternative communications when primary 
communications are inoperative.

3.4. Installation Recovery after Attack (IRAA) Tool. The purpose of the IRAA 
tool is to develop a database for Civil Engineer equipment, materials, personnel, 
and vehicles. It provides tools to manage these assets and timelines used during 
the recovery of an installation after attack. The tool is interoperable with other 
geospatial applications such as Geospatial Expeditionary Planning Tool 
(GeoExPT) and Joint Construction Management System. It allows input and data 
storage capabilities to include creating domain values, equipment, materials, 
personnel, and vehicle data. In addition, multi-user capabilities are provided so 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
27 
 
 
users can synchronize changes to other IRAA application instances for data 
sharing purposes. IRAA will be extended to mobile devices to enable real-time 
field data to be entered and visualized at all command echelons. 
 
3.5. Emergency Operations Center. The EOC is the C2 support element that 
coordinates information and resources to support the installation’s enemy attack 
preparation, response, and recovery actions. The EOC provides C2 functions 
necessary to place multiple recovery plans into action and implement them as 
needed. The EOC communication capabilities must include exchanging data with 
First/Emergency Responders, the Incident Command Post, and installation UCCs. 
Through Emergency Support Function (ESF)-3 (Public Works [CE]), they also 
direct the Airfield Damage Assessment Team (ADAT), UXO mitigation teams, 
and the MAOS Selection Team. 
 
3.6. Civil Engineer Unit Control Center (CE-UCC). UCCs provide a focal 
point within an organization to maintain unit C2, and to relay information to and 
from unit personnel and the EOC. They provide expertise to the EOC or Incident 
Commander, and leverage unit resources to respond to, and mitigate the attack. In 
regard to RADR, the CE-UCC is charged with controlling all CE airfield recovery 
actions. With considerable increases in equipment, manpower, and vehicles, asset 
tracking is more crucial than during the legacy Rapid Runway Repair operations. 
The EOC Director advises the CE representative of installation mission resource 
priorities as personnel and equipment are now shared across recovery teams and 
recovery operations are not limited to the confines of the airfield.  
 
3.7. RADR Officer in Charge (OIC). The RADR OIC is the primary facilitator 
between the CE-UCC Commander, Logistics Chief, Crater Chief, and the Support 
Chief. The OIC assists RADR teams by addressing problems they cannot resolve 
themselves. The OIC does this by requesting support from other RADR teams, or 
through the CE UCC Commander when support is required from sources external 
to CE. The RADR OIC must work closely with Operations Personnel (3E6X1) to 
track personnel, vehicles, equipment, and materials (materials will be tracked by 
the Logistics Chief and updates reported to the RADR OIC) and ensure resupply 
actions happen in a timely manner to support future requirements. The OIC is 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
28 
 
 
typically located in the CE-UCC or alternate UCC but may travel to the airfield 
to observe or assist RADR operations. The RADR OIC notifies the airfield 
manager when all recovery actions are complete and the MAOS is ready to be 
opened. 
 
3.8. Logistics Chief. The Logistics Chief manages operations of the warehouses 
and batch plants. The Logistics Chief’s primary responsibility is to make certain 
logistics teams (i.e., warehouse and batch teams) are completing their assigned 
tasks as effectively as possible and to help remove obstacles that negatively 
impact their operations. The Logistics Chief is typically located in the CE-UCC 
or Alternate UCC but may travel to the warehouses and/or batch plants to observe 
or assist operations. The Logistics Chief directly contacts the Crater or Support 
Chiefs when logistics teams require their assistance. The Logistics Chief contacts 
the RADR OIC when support is needed from external organizations (e.g., fuels, 
vehicle maintenance, etc.). In addition to tracking repair materials (e.g., backfill 
material, capping material, FOD covers, etc.), the Logistics Chief also manages 
asphalt production including reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) stockpiles, batch 
start times, batched hot mix quantities, hot mix maximum hold times, and delivery 
schedules. Finally, the Logistics Chief notifies the RADR OIC when logistics 
teams have completed their primary tasks and are available to assist elsewhere. 
 
3.9. Warehouse Leads. Warehouse Leads manage the delivery of repair materials 
(e.g., flowable fill, crushed stone backfill, rapid-set concrete) to the crater repair 
teams and keep track of materiel usage within their warehouse. Sufficient repair 
material must be on hand, produced, and/or delivered on-time to meet rigid repair 
timelines. 
 
3.9.1. The initial material requirements are generated from damage inputs 
processed through GeoExPT. Repair teams report the pavement upheaval marking 
dimensions to the supporting Warehouse Lead for comparison with the GeoExPT 
reports. After debris is excavated, the excavation spotter reports actual crater 
volume to the supporting Warehouse Lead. Material procurement, production and 
delivery must be adjusted accordingly to ensure sufficient repair materials are 
available. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
29 
 
 
3.9.2. Warehouse Leads report material quantities, usage, and shortages to the 
Logistics Chief so actions may be initiated to share, acquire, or produce additional 
materiel if shortages are expected. Warehouse Leads inform the Logistics Chief 
when warehouse members have completed their primary tasks and are available 
to assist elsewhere. 
 
3.9.3. Warehouse 1 Lead manages the start of asphalt batching, production, hold 
times (trucks and stockpiles), deliveries, and reports status to the Logistics Chief. 
 
3.10. Batch Plant Team Lead. The Batch Plant Leads manage asphalt production 
for applicable repairs and ensures produced asphalt is loaded in warehouse dump 
trucks to be delivered to the airfield at appropriate times. Each plant supports two 
repair teams and receives directions from the Warehouse 1 Lead on when to begin 
and stop production. Raw asphalt material (e.g., cookies or RAP) inventory, 
production, hold times, and deliveries are reported to the Logistics Chief so 
actions may be initiated as needed to share material with other batch plants, 
acquire, or produce additional materiel if shortages are expected. 
 
3.11. Crater Chief. The Crater Chief actively manages all MAOS crater and spall 
repair operations. The Crater Chief is responsible for the overall convoy brief and 
works with the RADR OIC and Logistics and Support Chiefs to determine convoy 
lineup. The Crater Chief’s primary responsibility is ensuring the crater and spall 
repair crews are progressing in a timely manner and to address disruptions such 
as equipment breakdowns, material shortages, or personnel problems. The Crater 
Chief typically is located on the airfield to monitor and assist RADR operations. 
The Crater Chief communicates with the Logistics Chief and Support Chief when 
support is required from, or needed by, logistics and support teams. The Crater 
Chief communicates with the Logistics Chief when support is needed from the 
Warehouses or Batch Plants. The Crater Chief contacts the RADR OIC when 
support may be needed from external organizations (e.g., fuels, additional vehicle 
or manning requests). Finally, the Crater Chief notifies the RADR OIC when 
crater team crews have completed their primary tasks and are available to assist 
elsewhere. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024

3.12. Support Chief. The Support Chief manages the five support teams’ 
operations (i.e., FOD, Marking, Emergency Airfield Lighting System [EALS], 
aircraft arresting system [AAS], and Water and Fuel Expedient Repair System 
[WaFERS]) and informs them when they should proceed to the airfield to begin 
work. The Support Chief’s primary responsibility is to make certain the support 
teams complete their assigned tasks as effectively as possible and to help remove 
obstacles that negatively impact their operations. The Support Chief is typically 
located on the airfield to monitor and/or assist the support teams. The Support 
Chief directly contacts the Crater Chief or Logistics Chief when support teams 
require their assistance. The Support Chief contacts the RADR OIC when support 
is needed from external organizations (e.g., fuels, vehicle maintenance, etc.). 
Finally, the Support Chief notifies the RADR OIC when support teams have 
completed their primary tasks and are available to assist elsewhere.

MANNING 
 
4.1. Overview. Personnel UTCs to perform RADR also perform beddown or Base 
Operating Support-Integrator missions. See the CE Supplement to the War and 
Mobilization Plan-1 (WMP-1) for personnel UTCs required to perform the RADR 
mission. Table 4.1 identifies manning required for each RADR capability to 
finish repairs in 6.5 hours (not counting Damage Assessment and Response 
Teams [DARTs], 3E7, 3E8, or 3E9 personnel). Personnel are not counted twice 
where individuals transfer to other teams after initial duties have been completed 
(their radios are distributed as needed). The 16-person (not counting DARTs, 3E7, 
3E8, or 3E9 personnel) control center manning is depicted in Figure 4.1. An 
additional two RADR C2 personnel (Crater Chief and Support Chief), totaling 18, 
are identified in Figure 4.2, which illustrates an example of the 75 person Small 
RADR Capability. In total,  93 persons are required for a Small RADR Capability 
(minus ADATs, DARTs, 3E7, 3E8, or 3E9). Table 4.2 identifies approximate 
time to complete repairs with different number of teams. 
 
4.2. Force Presentation. RADR force presentation is provided through Civil 
Engineer beddown UTCs whether employed at home station (fight-in-place) and 
augmented by UTCs from other locations, or UTCs tasked through the Joint 
Operation Planning and Execution System at forward operating bases. Therefore, 
all traditional CE personnel will receive airfield damage repair/RADR training to 
ensure required skill sets are available when needed. In addition, EOD manning 
is determined by enemy threat and risk, and therefore may not necessarily be 
adequate for the RADR mission at a particular location. In these instances, 
additional EOD UTCs should be tasked to support the RADR mission. 
 
4.2.2. See the Civil Engineer Supplement to the WMP-1, Attachment 1, for a full 
listing of CE personnel UTCs that may be tasked to execute RADR capabilities. 
 
4.2.3. Where RADR capabilities are postured (whether at contingency locations 
or main operating bases), use Functional Force Module tables in the WMP-1,

needed to support the RADR mission. 
 
Note: RADR Warehouse manning includes Ground Transportation (2T1XX) 
personnel to operate forklifts and tractor-trailers (see Figure 4.2).

STATUS REPORTING 
 
5.1. Overview. Status reports are initiated to keep leadership apprised of 
personnel accountability and progress of recovery actions. Example status 
reporting and personnel tracking sheets are provided in Attachment 3. 
 
5.2. Personnel Status. To keep radio traffic to a minimum, RADR personnel use 
the following procedures to report personnel status: 
 
5.2.1. When RADR personnel permanently transfer, or are temporarily loaned, to 
another RADR team, the losing Team Lead contacts the gaining Team Lead to 
notify them personnel are transferred to their team. When the personnel arrive, 
the gaining Team Lead notifies the losing Team Lead the personnel have safely 
arrived. In this scenario, the personnel status change is not up channeled to the 
RADR OIC/UCC as all RADR personnel are still accounted for and still assigned 
to RADR. 
 
5.2.2. However, if personnel are injured, killed, or become missing, the status is 
reported up the chain to the RADR OIC as soon as discovered. The RADR OIC 
keeps the personnel status updated on his/her status sheet (see Attachment 3) as 
called in by the RADR Chiefs and immediately reports the status changes to the 
UCC. 
 
5.2.3. If/when the UCC requests a periodic dead/injured/missing/extra (DIME) 
report (NOT initiated after a significant event such as an attack) the RADR OIC 
reports the latest status change documented on his/her status sheet. 
 
5.2.4. After a significant event (such as an attack) the RADR Chiefs initiate a 
DIME report from their respective Team Leads, using a personnel status sheet 
such as the one provided in Attachment 3, and report the results to the RADR 
OIC. The RADR OIC reports the RADR totals to the UCC. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
38 
 
 
5.2.5. Use the “Extra” column in the DIME report to document when personnel 
from other units shelter-in-place or engineers are transferred or loaned to complete 
tasks other than RADR (e.g., sent to respond to a non-RADR emergency tasking 
such as isolating a fallen high voltage electrical cable posing danger to base 
personnel), or when non-CE personnel from another unit are loaned to support 
RADR operations. For example: if three non-RADR persons were added to a 
team, the “E” would be reported as “plus” (+) 3 followed by the Personnel Support 
to Contingency Operations (PERSCO) numbers of the extra persons. Conversely, 
if three persons were removed (i.e., transferred or loaned outside RADR 
operations) from a team, the “E” would be reported as “minus” (-) 3 followed by 
the PERSCO numbers of the three persons removed and their new location if 
known. When reporting is complete, numbers in the “E” column are summed and, 
if they balance (i.e. “0”) all personnel are accounted for. When figures do not 
balance, a review of all reports should identify where extra personnel are located 
and a call is made to determine if the extra personnel are the missing persons. If 
applicable, use the remarks column to document when individuals are expected 
to return to their RADR duties. 
 
5.3. Recovery Status. Again, to keep radio traffic to a minimum and to provide a 
better overall picture of the recovery picture, recovery status reporting is task-
based, not percentage-based as in legacy Rapid Runway Repair procedures. See 
Attachment 3 for an example RADR Progress Report Worksheet. 
 
5.3.1. Each Crater Repair Team Lead reports to the Crater Chief as each repair 
crew completes their primary task. 
 
5.3.2. Support Teams with a continual mission give status updates as milestones 
are completed (e.g., trailer loading complete or material hauling complete). It may 
not be possible to complete support processes in order (e.g., Emergency Airfield 
Lighting System (EALS) team could report “Delta” before “Charlie”, etc.). 
 
5.3.3. The Support, Logistics, and Crater Chiefs pass along the status to the RADR 
OIC in the CE UCC where status boards/IRAA are updated.

FIELD FUELING STATIONS 
 
6.1. Overview. Repair and ancillary teams are expected to conduct recovery 
operations for up to seven hours; therefore, many of the vehicles involved in the 
process will require refueling before operations are complete (see Table 6.1 for 
RADR vehicle fuel consumption rates). If available, select suitable locations to 
stage fuel trucks for refueling RADR vehicles during the recovery process. If fuel 
trucks are not available, develop a refueling plan to be supported by the Logistics 
Readiness Squadron (LRS). See Attachment 2 for an example of a refueling plan.

RADR VEHICLE MAINTENANCE WHILE IN WRM 
 
7.1. General Information. War Reserve Materiel vehicle assets are managed in 
accordance with AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM), and AFI 24-302.  In 
addition to requirements identified in those publications, below are maintenance 
actions for RADR-unique equipment and vehicles in WRM.   
 
7.2. Vehicle Maintenance Requirements while Stored in WRM. The following 
maintenance actions should be performed on RADR-unique equipment and 
vehicles while stored in WRM, as coordinated with the 441st Vehicle Support 
Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS). 
 
7.2.1. If no technical order or manufacturer guidance for operational inspections 
exist for equipment stored, the following guidance applies. Perform a pre-
operational inspection that consists of, at a minimum, a check of and/or adding 
engine oil/pump oil, coolant, and hydraulic fluid. Inspect tire conditions and air 
pressures; check operation of lights, horns, alarms, and perform corrosion control 
as necessary. Correct any discrepancies prior to operating the equipment. 
Functionally operate all vehicle/equipment and conduct a general condition 
inspection for overall condition, leaks, and damage. Once operational 
inspection/checkout actions are complete, document and prepare for storage. 
Equipment will not be returned to storage until all discrepancies/malfunctions 
have been corrected and documented. 
 
7.2.2. Refer to individual equipment technical orders or manufacturer’s manuals 
for guidance in preparing equipment for storage. If technical orders or manuals 
do not include guidance for storage preparation, prepare the equipment in the 
following manner. Drain all fuel from unit’s engine fuel tank. Leave engine oil in 
crankcase at operating level. Disconnect batteries, remove and maintain batteries 
in a ready state by periodic charging and rotating use during inspection/ 
operational checkout. Open air valves, grease exposed cylinders, and cover assets 
to protect from environment conditions if possible. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
42 
 
 
7.2.3. Vehicles maintained in active storage should be functionally tested semi-
annually by CE personnel with assistance of vehicle maintenance personnel. 
 
7.2.4. To assist with compact track loader and excavator attachment maintenance 
while in storage, attachments may be configured on RADR attachment trailers as 
shown in Figure A4.2; however, trailers must be reloaded in the survivability 
configuration during pre-attack actions as shown in Figure A4.1. 
 
7.2.5. Perform the following when equipment is stored in freezing temperatures: 
 
7.2.5.1. Drain water from tanks and plumbing, leave water valves open, and use 
compressed air to remove water that does not drain by gravity.  
 
7.2.5.2. Verify battery electrolyte is filled to the indicated level. Ensure battery 
terminals are free of debris and rust. Consider removing batteries from equipment, 
store them inside a building or warehouse, and keep batteries charged using a 
trickle charger. Avoid charging a frozen battery as it will normally explode. 
 
7.2.5.3. Maintain proper tire pressures. 
 
7.2.5.4. Keep fuel tanks full to prevent condensation inside the tanks (Exception: 
drain volumetric mixer fuel tanks). Consider using an approved diesel fuel 
treatment/stabilizer to keep fuel liquefied and to remove moisture from lines. 
After adding the fuel treatment/stabilizer, run the engine for a few minutes to 
circulate the additives to the pump and fuel injectors. 
 
7.2.5.5. Properly grease all lubrication points to prevent moisture from building 
up. Remember to use low-temp lube as recommended by manufacturers. 
 
7.2.5.6. Monthly, check all fluid levels and add enough fuel to start the machine 
and run it until the engine reaches working temperature. Remove grease from the 
hydraulic cylinder pistons, and carefully operate the hydraulic controls, making 
sure they function properly. When finished, lightly recoat the hydraulic cylinder 
pistons with grease and drain remaining fuel.

PREPARATORY ACTIONS 
 
8.1. Pre-Threat Actions. These are actions that may require days to complete and 
therefore should be accomplished before an immediate threat is recognized. 
 
8.1.1. Conduct an airfield survey using as-built drawings and on-site inspections 
to determine pavement types and thicknesses, whether or not load transfer devices 
(dowels) or reinforcing bars are present within concrete pavement, and 
shoulder/overrun construction features. Document location and depth of any 
utility, pipe, drain or structural element that are beneath any airfield pavements. 
If as-built drawings are unavailable locally, request airfield survey data from the 
Air Force Civil Engineer Center Reach Back Center at DSN 523-6995, 
Commercial 850-283-6995, or afcec.rbc@us.af.mil. If no survey data is found, 
airfield damage may reveal whether or not load transfer devices are present. 
Otherwise, treat the first repair as if load transfer devices are not present and adjust 
if necessary. 
 
8.1.2. Conduct airfield profile measurements and dynamic cone penetrometer 
readings every 200-feet along the runway edges to determine locations with 
suitable slope and California Bearing Ratio for aircraft arresting system 
installations and suitable locations for Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) 
installations. Perform the measurements from the runway edges out to 300-feet 
from the runway’s centerline. 
 
8.1.3. Obtain a dozen cans each of red and black spray marking paint (and lumber 
crayons for inclement weather, located in the RADR tool trailer) to be used by the 
Upheaval Marking Crew to mark pavement cut lines. It is also used by the 
Excavation Crew to mark lines for backfill levels within a repair, and to mark the 
excavation level on the excavator’s bucket to assist the spotter in determining 
when excavation has reached the appropriate depth. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
44 
 
 
8.1.4. Obtain a dozen tubes of construction adhesive to be used by the Capping 
Crew to attach expansion joint board to adjacent slabs of a rapid large crater 
repair. 
 
8.1.5. Acquire a case of two-cycle oil for power equipment (e.g., blowers in 
inclement weather kit) and store in RADR Tool Trailer. 
 
8.1.6. If an asphalt capability is going to be utilized at the location, locally obtain 
at least 40 tons of asphalt (RAP, cookies, etc.) when the airfield includes asphalt 
pavement. 
 
8.1.7. Ensure crushed stone stockpiles are sufficient. 
 
8.1.8. Ensure line-of-sight measurement devices (Figure 8.1) are in the RADR 
Tool Trailer upon receiving UTC 4FWCR. If devices are missing or damaged, 
construct devices using specifications found in T.O. 35E2-5-1. 
 
Figure 8.1. Profile Measurement Devices. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
45 
 
 
8.1.9. Marry prime movers with the designated item to be towed to ensure there 
is no coupling or clearance issues. Also, ensure light and brake connections are 
compatible. Implement corrective actions as necessary. 
 
8.1.10. If the installation supports heavy airframes (e.g. airlift, tankers) and has 
soil that makes driving cruciform stakes extremely difficult (e.g. coral, rock, 
caliche), consider constructing concrete pads (aligned with pads constructed at the 
runway shoulder for Mobile Runway Edge Sheave [MRES] installations) for 
anchoring Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS) trailers for setback 
installations (see Figure 8.2 for example configurations). Make these pads the 
same dimensions and aligned with pads along runway’s edges. For design 
considerations, consult the Air Force Civil Engineer Reach Back Center at DSN 
523-6995, Commercial 850-283-6995, or afcec.rbc@us.af.mil.

AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024 
46 
 
 
8.1.11. RADR asphalt recyclers have the ability to utilize RAP to create asphalt 
crater capping materials. All peacetime paving projects at installations with a 
RADR requirement should consider utilizing airfield mix in normal peacetime 
construction projects so it can be milled or recycled if needed for RADR. For 
design considerations, consult the Air Force Civil Engineer Reach Back Center at 
DSN 523-6995, Commercial 850-283-6995, or afcec.rbc@us.af.mil. 
 
8.1.12. There are not enough prime movers in the RADR vehicle sets to tow all 
trailers and towable equipment to the airfield when convoying to the repair areas 
after attack. Therefore, work with the unit vehicle control officer to coordinate 
with LRS to develop a memorandum of agreement to provide a tractor-trailer and 
driver to assist with delivering trailers and equipment to the airfield and dedicated 
vehicle mechanics to assist with RADR operations after an attack. 
 
8.1.13. Coordinate with airfield management to determine potential aircraft types 
that may use the airfield, aircraft operational weights, and aircraft operations 
modes (e.g. arrestment, take-off only, evacuation, short take-off, vertical landing), 
and aircraft dispersal plans as these impact MAOS selection and may affect 
RADR preposition layouts.  
 
8.1.14. Coordinate with Security Forces on RADR dispersal locations and 
potential haul routes to prevent friendly-fire incidents.  
 
Note: Routes may require breaching of a fence or other barrier to the flightline. 
 
8.1.15. Coordinate with Transportation for vehicle maintenance support 
protocols. 
 
8.1.16. Coordinate RADR refueling plans with Fuels. 
 
8.1.17. Coordinate with all units, including LRS, that may supply manpower, 
equipment/vehicles, or materials to augment CE during recovery efforts to ensure 
accounting, marshaling, and transfers are efficient and effective. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024

8.2. Attack Preparation Actions. These are actions taken when indications and 
warnings inform the commander of an adversary’s preparation and intent to 
conduct offensive operations. 
 
8.2.1. Retrieve line-of-sight measurement devices (see Figure 8.1) in the RADR 
Tool Trailer and load devices in vehicle designated to transport Upheaval Marking 
Crew to the airfield. 
 
8.2.2. Load work-tool attachment trailers as illustrated in Figure A4.1. 
 
8.2.3. Retrieve fuel cans and two-cycle oil from RADR Tool Trailer, fill fuel cans, 
and place fuel cans and oil in Inclement Weather and Spall Kits. 
 
8.2.4. Fill water trailers, water skids, and volumetric mixer water tank(s). Do NOT 
load mixer with repair material until repair types are known (i.e., concrete or 
asphalt caps).  
 
Note: Flowable fill and rapid-setting concrete perform best when mixed with 
water between 70°F and 80°F. Indoor storage or mechanical heating devices may 
be required to keep water at this temperature. Maintain water at or above 50°F in 
cold weather locations in order to eliminate the need to use accelerants or to 
increase cure times. Currently, fresh water is required, however, testing using sea 
water is ongoing and may be a viable option in the future. Stay informed. 
 
8.2.5. Inspect vehicles and equipment for serviceability and fill fuel tanks. 
 
8.2.6. Disperse vehicles and equipment per installation dispersal plan to include 
dispersing repair materials to warehouse operating locations. 
 
8.2.7. Repeated attacks should be anticipated. The probability of these continued 
attacks will diminish as Allied air superiority is obtained. Proper planning should 
include the protection of repair personnel, material, vehicles, and equipment 
against repeated attacks on the airfield. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.10, 29 November 2024

8.2.8. Run a minimum of one yard of material through the volumetric mixer to 
ensure proper operation and correct settings; thoroughly clean mixer afterwards. 
Also, stock the mixer catwalk with any required admixtures. 
 
Note: Some volumetric mixers have experienced seized water pumps upon 
removal from WRM. Recommend full operational test of all volumetric mixers 
(and asphalt recyclers) before accepting from WRM. If pump is seized, WRM 
maintenance personnel should perform corrective action by disassembling pump, 
replacing the shear pin, and lubricating all lubrication points.  
 
8.2.9. Break 2.5-inch-thick stockpiled asphalt cookies to a size less than 15 inches 
by 15 inches. 
 
8.2.10. If stockpiled sand is wet, move a bucket load where it can dry, and stay 
dry, for use with the sand spreader in the inclement weather kit. 
 
8.2.11. See AFTTP 3-32.17 for attack recovery action and mobilizing the repair 
force.

Terms 
Adversary—A party acknowledged as potentially hostile to a friendly party and 
against which the use of force may be envisaged. 
Airfield—An area prepared to accommodate (including any buildings, 
installations, and equipment) landing, and takeoff of aircraft. 
Air Tasking Order—A method used to task and disseminate to components, 
subordinate units, and command and control agencies projected sorties, 
capabilities and/or forces to targets and specific missions. Normally provides 
specific instructions to include call signs, targets, controlling agencies, etc., as 
well as general instructions. Source: JP 3-30. 
Airfield Damage Assessment—Locating, classifying, and measuring the damage 
(camouflet, crater, spall, and UXO) on the airfield operating surfaces. 
Airfield Damage Assessment Team (ADAT)—An airfield recovery team, 
typically located in or near the EOC and directed by the ESF 3, used to identify 
and locate airfield damage and UXO following an attack. Their initial efforts are 
normally targeted towards the airfield proper; but can also be employed elsewhere 
as deemed necessary. The ADAT usually consists of one engineering technician 
and two EOD technicians. A CE member trained as an EOD assistant may replace 
one of the EOD technicians when two are unavailable for ADAT. The ADAT 
should be equipped with an armored vehicle and communications enabling them 
to report their observations to the MAOS Selection Cell. The ADAT damage 
reports must be as accurate as possible as this information is used in MAOS 
selection.

requirements for operating assigned and/or allocated aircraft types on a particular 
airfield at maximum or combat gross weight. 2. The MOS is the smallest amount 
of area to be repaired to launch and recover aircraft after an attack. Selection of 
this MOS will depend upon mission requirements, taxi access, resources 
available, and estimated time to repair. For fighter aircraft, the typically accepted 
dimensions are 5,000 feet long by 50 feet wide. 
Mission—1. The task, together with the purpose, that clearly indicates the action 
to be taken and the reason therefore. (JP 3-0) 2. In common usage, especially when 
applied to lower military units, a duty assigned to an individual or unit; a task. (JP 
3-0) 3. The dispatching of one or more aircraft to accomplish one particular task.

periods of time. 
Response—Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. 
Response includes immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and meet 
basic human needs. Response also includes the execution of emergency 
operations plans and of incident mitigation activities designed to limit the loss of 
life, personal injury, property damage, and other unfavorable outcomes. As 
indicated by the situation, response activities include: applying intelligence and 
other information to lessen the effects or consequences of an incident; increased 
security operations; continuing investigations into the nature and source of the 
threat; ongoing public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; 
immunizations, isolation or quarantine; and specific law enforcement operations 
aimed at preempting, interdicting or disrupting illegal activity and apprehending 
actual perpetrators and bringing them to justice. 
Runway—A defined rectangular area of an airfield, prepared for the landing and 
takeoff run of aircraft along its length. A runway is measured from the outer edge 
of the thresholds from one end of the runway to the others. The width of the 
runway is typically measured from the outer edge of the load-bearing pavement 
on one side to the outer edge of the load-bearing pavement on the other side. In 
some cases the runway may be measured from the outside edge of the runway 
marking line on one side to the outside edge of the marking line on the other side 
and any remaining load bearing pavement is considered shoulder.
