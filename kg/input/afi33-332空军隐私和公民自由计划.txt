Chapter 1 
PRIVACY OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Privacy Overview. 
1.1.1.  What is privacy? Although there is not an official government definition of privacy, it 
generally refers to the notion of individuals maintaining control over their own information. 
For the Air Force, the framework of privacy requirements includes the Privacy Act of 1974, 
Title 5 United States Code (USC) Section 552a, Public Law 107-347, Section 208, The E-
Government Act of 2002, Office of Management and Budget policy, Department of Defense 
(DoD) policy, and Air Force policy. Failure to protect privacy can bring about risks to the 
individual, such as identity theft, and risks to the Air Force, such as lawsuits for inappropriate 
disclosure that divert critical resources away from our mission. 
1.1.2.  What information must be protected? The information protected by the various 
components of the privacy framework is discussed using multiple terms. 
1.2.  Civil Liberties Overview. 
1.2.1.  Civil liberties are fundamental rights and freedoms protected by The Constitution of 
the United States. These freedoms, which include the right to privacy, are concentrated 
primarily in the Bill of Rights. 
1.2.2.  Individuals who feel any of the following provided examples (the list is not 
exhaustive) has been violated shall seek direction through their servicing Inspector General 
office; (See AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution). 
1.3.  Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 
1.3.1.  Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-17-12, Preparing for and 
Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable Information – “The term PII refers to 
information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or 
when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. PII 
may range from common data elements such as names, addresses, dates of birth, and places 
of employment, to identity documents, Social Security numbers (SSN) or other government-
issued identity, precise location information, medical history, and biometrics. Because there 
are many different types of information that can be used to distinguish or trace an 
individual’s identity the term PII is necessarily broad.. 
1.3.2.  Office of Management and Budget Memorandum 10-22, Guidance for Online Use of 
Web Measurement and Customization Technologies - The definition of PII is not anchored to 
any single category of information or technology. Rather, it demands a case-by-case 
assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified. In performing this 
assessment, it is important for an agency to recognize that non-PII can become PII whenever 
additional information is made publicly available – in any medium and from any source – 
that, when combined with other available information, could be used to identify an 
individual. 
1.3.3.  For safeguarding of Personal Identifiable Information, please refer to DoD 5400.11-R, 
Department of Defense Privacy Program (C1.4, C4 and Appendix 1). 
AFI33-332  10 MARCH 2020CORRECTIVEACTIONSAPPLIED12MAY2020 
7 
1.3.4.  PII maintained in a System of Record accessed or handled by contractors. It is 
imperative that contractors, required to access or handle PII on behalf of the Air Force, 
follow this instruction. For this reason, organizations with contractors that access and handle 
PII will coordinate with contracting officials to ensure that contract require compliance with 
this instruction. (T-1).  Additionally, organizations will coordinate with contracting officers 
to ensure contracts contain the proper Privacy Act clauses: 52.224-1, Privacy Act 
Notification, and 52.224-2, Privacy Act as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
(See website at: https://www.acquisition.gov/browse/index/far .) Contracting Officers will 
also require non-disclosure agreements for contractors who will have access to sensitive PII. 
(T-0). Note: All contracts either need the Network Penetration or Cloud DFAR clauses to 
comply with the requirements for contractors protecting PII in OMB Memo 17-12. 
1.3.5.  Contracts will be reviewed annually by the Contracting Officer Representative to 
ensure compliance with this instruction. (T-0).  
1.3.6.  Disclosure of PII maintained in a System of Records to contractors for use in the 
performance of an Air Force contract is considered an official use disclosure within the 
agency under exception (b)(1) of the Privacy Act and protected as an inter/intra-Agency 
disclosure per Freedom of Information Act exemption (b)(5).

4.5.2.  Privacy Act Advisory Statements in Publications. Include a Privacy Act Advisory 
Statement in each AF publication that requires collecting or keeping personal information in 
a SOR. Also include a statement when publications direct collection from the individual of 
any part or form of the Social Security Number (SSN). The statement shall refer to the legal 
authority for collecting the information and SORN number and title as follows:  This 
instruction requires the collection and or maintenance of information protected by the 
Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by [set forth the legal authority such as the federal 
statute, executive order, and regulation]. The applicable System of Records Notice(s) 
[number and title] is (are) available at: https://dpcld.defense.gov/privacy/SORNS.aspx 
(T-0). 
4.5.3.  Label: Air Force Visual Aid (AFVA) 33-276, Air Force Privacy Act Label. Use is 
mandatory to assist in identifying Privacy Act information by placing the label on the covers 
of removable electronic storage media such as laptops, Government hard drives, DVDs, CDs, 
diskettes, tapes and may be used for deployment folders. The label is not authorized for use 
on file drawers, file cabinets, mailing envelopes, or other stationary equipment or materials in 
accordance with AFI 33-322, Records Management and Information Governance Program. 
(T-1). 
4.5.4.  The Privacy Act requires agencies to provide safeguards to ensure the security and 
confidentiality of SOR and to protect individuals against an invasion of personal privacy. 
4.6.  Publishing System of Records Notices (SORNs).  The AF Privacy Officer will submit 
SORNs to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Transparency Division (DPLTD) to be 
published in the Federal Register for new, changed or deleted SOR. When published, the public 
will be allowed 30 days to comment. Collection of this information is not authorized until the 
SORN is final, including during this 30 day review period. If comments are received that result 
in a contrary determination, this could further delay the time until a final SORN is published and 
collection may occur. Any collection conducted prior to finalizing the SORN is an illegal 
collection and can result in civil penalties under the Privacy Act of 1974 5 USC § 552a as 
amended,  (i)(1) Criminal Penalties. (T-0). 
4.6.1.  When is a SORN required? A SORN is required when personal information is 
maintained on an individual and is regularly retrieved by a name, number (DoD ID number, 
Social Security number, etc.), symbol, or other identifying particular (data element) assigned 
to the individual.   The Privacy Act requires submission of new or significantly changed 
SORNs to the OMB and both houses of Congress before publication in the Federal Register. 
There are 3 types of SORN Action requests (new, modification, and rescindment) that can be 
submitted. Refer to DoD SORN Reference Guide located at AF Privacy SharePoint® site: 
https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10440/InfoAcc/Privacy/Risk%20Management%20Framework
%20(RMF)%20Privacy%20Process/3.%20SORN%20REFERENCE%20GUIDE,%20
Version%20II,%20May%202018.pdf 
4.6.2.  Other Systems. National Security SORs require a SORN. While some or many of 
these systems may be classified, the SORN is written in an unclassified manner describing 
the nature of the collection of PII. (See DoD 5400.11-R, for the use and establishment of 
exemptions that may apply to these systems). 
4.6.3.  Adopting Existing SORN. A new or existing SOR may be incorporated into an 
existing SORN published in the Federal Register: 
24 
AFI33-332  10 MARCH 2020CORRECTIVEACTIONSAPPLIED12MAY2020 
4.6.3.1.  First, research current SORNs, including those that cover systems of records 
government-wide and DoD-wide on the Defense Privacy Notices website at 
https://dpcld.defense.gov/privacy/SORNS.aspx for one that matches well with the new 
SOR at all points, i.e., Category of Individuals Covered, Category of Records, Authority, 
Purposes, Routine Uses, Policies, etc. 
4.6.3.2.  Second, if necessary, contact the current SORN owner through the POC 
information on the SORN to discuss altering or amending their SORN to include the new 
AF SOR and POC information. 
4.6.4.  Provide the system owner the altered or amended SORN for their review and 
processing. 
4.6.5.  Updating SORNs. Examples for Adding, Altering, Amending, and Deleting a SORN 
are available on the AF Information Access SharePoint® and the AF Privacy Website. 
4.6.6.  Submitting SORNs for publication in the Federal Register. The Program/Project 
Manager must submit the proposed SORN through their MAJCOM Privacy Manager at a 
minimum of 120 days before the planned implementation date of a new SOR or a change to 
an existing SOR subject to this instruction. The Privacy Manager shall review for accuracy 
and completeness and send electronically to the AF Privacy Office usaf.pentagon.saf-
cn.mbx.af-privacy@mail.mil. The AF Privacy Office shall review and forward to Defense 
Privacy, Civil Liberties, and Transparency Division for review and publishing in the Federal 
Register, as appropriate. (T-1). 
4.6.7.  Requirement for continuous monitoring review of published SORNs. Program/Project 
Managers shall ensure that no system of records includes information about an individual 
that is not relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute or executive 
order (Appendix I to OMB Circular A-108), (Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, 
Reporting, and Publication under the Privacy Act). PMs review and submit any changes 
through the process described in this chapter and promptly update appropriate answers to 
Information Technology Investment Portfolio Suite questions. (T-0). 
4.6.8.  Rescindment of SORNs. If an IT system is being decommissioned or closed and has a 
published SORN that is no longer required, comply with DoD SORN Reference Guide and 
OMB A-108, Appendix IV Office of the Federal Register SORN template - Notice of 
Rescindment and submit appropriate deletion request to the AF Privacy Office, 
usaf.pentagon.saf-cn.mbx.af-privacy@mail.mil    to be forward to DoD to have the SORN 
deleted from the Federal Register. (T-1). 
4.7.  Privacy Act Records Request.  Persons or their designated representatives may ask for a 
copy of their records maintained in a SOR. Requesters need not state why they want access to 
their records. Personnel who receive requests must verify the identity of the requester to avoid 
unauthorized disclosures. How their identity is verified will depend on the sensitivity of the 
requested records. Identity can be verified in a number of ways, to include visually, personal 
knowledge of the requester, a signed letter, or a request via telephone as appropriate or e-mail, a 
notarized statement, or an unsworn statement. An unsworn declaration or notarized statement 
should be obtained in the following format: 
4.7.1.  Requesting Access to Records in a SOR.  
AFI33-332  10 MARCH 2020CORRECTIVEACTIONSAPPLIED12MAY2020 
25 
4.7.1.1.  Contents of Request. “I declare under penalty of perjury (if outside the United 
States, add “under the laws of the United States of America”) that the foregoing is true 
and correct. Executed on (date) (Signature).” 
4.7.1.1.1.  Description of Records. The requester must adequately describe the 
records they want. The requester is not required to name a SOR, but they should at 
least name a type of record or functional area. For requests that ask for “all records 
about me,” the requester should be asked for more information about the types of 
records they are seeking and informed as to how their input can help the AF respond 
as quickly as possible. If the requester needs help identifying types of systems or 
records, provide them information to review the government-wide systems of records 
published in the Federal Register and AF specific SORNs published at 
https://dpcld.defense.gov/privacy/SORNS.aspx. Ensure they understand that 
identifying the relevant SORN(s) will make the AF review more efficient. If the 
requester is truly requesting all records pertaining to themselves or an individual, 
inform the requester they must make a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. 
(T-0). 
4.7.1.1.2.  Provide Verification of Identity. (T-0). 
4.7.1.2.  Use of a Government Resource to make a request is prohibited. (T-0). 
4.7.2.  Processing a Request for Access to Records in a SOR. Immediately consult the local 
Privacy Manager, if necessary, to ensure timely response to the request. When individuals 
request information about themselves, they are not required to cite either the Privacy Act or 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The individual who processes the request will apply the 
Privacy Act when records are contained in a SOR and will apply the FOIA to all other 
records. (T-0).4.7.2.1. Acknowledge Request. As a good practice SOR owner should send 
the requester an acknowledgement letter within 10 workdays informing them of an 
approximate completion date. (T-0). 
4.7.2.1.  Required Response. As a good practice SOR owner should provide a copy of the 
record(s) to the requester within 20 workdays of receiving the request. If the SOR has an 
exemption, inform the requestor of those exemptions in a format the requester can 
understand. If the system is exempt from disclosure under the Privacy Act, follow the 
procedures addressed in paragraph 4.7.3 (T-0). 
4.7.3.  Denying or Limiting Access. When information protected under the Privacy Act may 
not be released under the Privacy Act, the request must be processed under the FOIA. If any 
part of the record is denied under the FOIA, the procedures in DoDM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-
302, Freedom of Information Act Program, are followed. For Privacy Act denials also 
processed under the FOIA (Note: This should be an extremely rare circumstance), send a 
copy of the request, the record copy, and why access has been denied (include the applicable 
exemption) to the denial authority through the legal office and the Privacy Office. The 
servicing legal office shall include a written legal opinion. The legal opinion shall not merely 
state that the decision is “legally sufficient,” but shall provide factual details and an analysis 
of the law and applicable regulations. The Privacy Manager reviews the file, and makes a 
recommendation to the denial authority. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with 
the decision. If the denial authority grants access, release the record copy. If the denial 
authority refuses access, tell the requester why and explain pertinent appeal rights.

AFI33-332  10 MARCH 2020CORRECTIVEACTIONSAPPLIED12MAY2020 
4.7.3.1.  Before a request for access to a Privacy Act System of Records from the subject 
is denied that was not processed under the FOIA, the SOR owner shall ensure that: 
4.7.3.1.1.  The system has an exemption published in the Federal Register as a final 
rule. (T-0). 
4.7.3.1.2.  The exemption covers each document. All parts of a system are not 
automatically exempt. (T-0). 
4.7.3.1.3.  The FOIA does not require release of any part of the record. (T-0). 
4.7.3.1.4.  Nonexempt parts are segregated. (T-0). 
4.7.4.  Third Party Information in a SOR. A first party requester is not entitled to receive 
information that does not directly pertain to him or her that is contained in their record; for 
example, the home address or SSN of a third party that is contained in their system of record 
solely for ease of identification of the third party. Servicing legal offices should be consulted 
prior to the release of a third party’s sensitive personal information to a first party requester 
that is contained in the first party requester’s SOR. (T-0). 
4.8.  Amending a Privacy Act Record. 
4.8.1.  Amendment Reasons. Individuals may ask to have their personal information in a 
SOR amended to make such information accurate, timely, relevant, and complete. System 
managers shall routinely correct a record if the requester can show that it is factually 
incorrect (e.g., date of birth is wrong). (T-0). 
4.8.2.  Responding to Amendment Requests. 
4.8.2.1.  The individual may request simple corrections orally. Requests for complicated 
and detailed corrections must be in writing to ensure clarity. (T-0). 
4.8.2.2.  After verifying the identity of the requester, the receiving agency shall make the 
change if appropriate, notify all known recipients of the record, and inform the affected 
individual. (T-0). 
4.8.2.3.  Acknowledge requests within 10 workdays of receipt. Give an expected 
completion date unless the change is completed within that time. Final decisions must, 
unless extended by the appropriate authority, take no longer than 30 workdays after the 
date of receipt. (T-0). 
4.9.  Approving or Denying a Record to be Amended.  The AF does not usually amend a 
record when the change is based on opinion, interpretation, or subjective official judgment. 
Determination not to amend such records constitutes a denial, and the requester may: 
4.9.1.  If the SOR owner decides not to amend the record then a copy of the request, the 
record, and the recommended denial reasons shall be sent to their servicing legal and Privacy 
Office. Legal office shall include a written legal opinion. The legal opinion shall not merely 
state that the decision is “legally sufficient,” but will provide factual details and an analysis 
of the law and applicable regulations. (T-0). 
4.9.2.  The SOR owner shall send the requester a letter with the decision. (T-0). 
4.9.3.  If the SOR owner denies the request to amend the records, the requester may file a 
concise statement of disagreement with the Air Force Privacy Officer.

4.10.  Contents of Privacy Act Processing Case Files.  Copies of disputed records shall not be 
kept in Privacy Act Processing case files. Disputed records shall be filed under their appropriate 
series. Use the Privacy Act Processing case files solely for statistics and to process requests. 
Such case files shall not be used to make any kind of determination about an individual. The 
reasons for untimely responses shall be documented in the Privacy Act Processing case files and 
may include the following: 
4.10.1.  Requests from and replies to individuals on whether a SOR contains records about 
them. (T-0). 
4.10.2.  Requests for access or amendment. (T-0). 
4.10.3.  Approvals, denials, appeals, and final review actions. (T-0). 
4.11.  First Party Appeal Process for Denial to Access or Amendment of a Privacy Act 
Record. 
4.11.1.  Appeals Procedures. Individuals who receive a denial to their access or amendment 
request may request a denial review (appeal) within 60 calendar days of the date of the denial 
letter. 
4.11.2.  The SOR owner shall promptly send a complete appeal package to the Air Force 
Privacy Officer. The package must include the following: 
4.11.2.1.  The original appeal letter; (T-0). 
4.11.2.2.  The initial request; (T-0). 
4.11.2.3.  The initial denial; (T-0). 
4.11.2.4.  A copy of the record; (T-0). 
4.11.2.5.  Any internal records or coordination actions relating to the denial and the 
denial authority’s comments on the appellant’s arguments and the legal reviews. (T-0). 
4.11.3.  If the SOR owner reverses their decision on an earlier denial and grants access or 
amendment, notify the requester immediately. 
4.11.4.  The SOR owner may include a brief summary of the reasons for not amending the 
record. 
4.11.5.  The Air Force Privacy Officer will review the denial and provide a final 
recommendation to the SOR owner along with providing the requester with the final AF 
decision and explanation of judicial review rights. (T-0). 
4.11.6.  The records will clearly show that a statement of disagreement is filed with the 
record or separately, if applicable. (T-0). 
4.11.7.  The disputed part of the record must show that the requester filed a statement of 
disagreement. (T-0). 
4.11.8.  Give copies of the statement of disagreement to the record’s previous recipients. 
Inform subsequent record users about the dispute and give them a copy of the statement with 
the record.

4.12.  Disclosing Information. 
4.12.1.  In all cases, use the following guidelines to decide whether to release information 
without consent: 
4.12.1.1.  Would the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information 
requested? 
4.12.1.2.  Is disclosing the information in the public interest? The public interest relates to 
how the AF carries out its statutory and regulatory duties. 
4.12.1.3.  Balance the public interest against the individual’s privacy interest. Do not 
consider the requester’s purpose, circumstances, or proposed use. 
4.12.2.  Rules for Releasing personal information without Consent of the Subject. The 
Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of personal information within a SOR without the prior 
written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. There are twelve exceptions to 
the “no disclosure without consent” rule. (See https://www.privacy.af.mil/Home/Privacy-
Act-Exceptions/.) 
4.12.3.  Disclosing the Medical Records of Minors. AF personnel may disclose the medical 
records of minors to their parents or legal guardians in conjunction with applicable Federal 
laws and guidelines. The laws of each state define the age of majority and/or circumstances 
under which minors are consider emancipated. Consult with the servicing legal office’s 
medical liaison and Military Treatment Facility for guidance to the age of majority, 
especially in overseas locations. 
4.12.4.  Disclosure Accountings. System managers must keep an accurate record of all 
disclosures made from any SOR except disclosures to DoD personnel for a valid official use 
or disclosures under the FOIA. System managers may use AF Form 771, Accounting of 
Disclosures. Retain disclosure accountings for 5 years after the disclosure, or for the life of 
the record, whichever is longer. 
4.12.4.1.  System managers shall file the Accounting of Disclosure record and give it to 
the data subject on request, send corrected or disputed information to previous record 
recipients, explain any disclosures, and provide an audit trail for reviews. Include in each 
accounting: 
4.12.4.1.1.  Release date. (T-0). 
4.12.4.1.2.  Description of information. (T-0). 
4.12.4.1.3.  Reason for release. (T-0). 
4.12.4.1.4.  Name and address of recipient. (T-0). 
4.12.4.1.5.  Some exempt systems let you withhold the accounting record from the 
subject. (T-0). 
4.12.4.1.6.  Withhold information about disclosure accountings for law enforcement 
purposes at the law enforcement agency’s request. (T-0).

4.13.  Computer Matching.  Computer matching programs electronically compare records from 
two or more automated systems, one from the DoD and the other from a Federal agency, or a 
state or local government in order to make a decision that affects an individual’s rights, benefits 
and/or privileges. 
4.13.1.  A system manager proposing a match that could result in an adverse action against a 
Federal employee must meet the following requirements of the Privacy Act: 
4.13.1.1.  Prepare a written agreement between participants; (T-0). 
4.13.1.2.  Secure approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board; (T-0). 
4.13.1.3.  Publish a matching notice in the Federal Register before matching begins; (T-

4.13.1.4.  Ensure full investigation and due process; and (T-0). 
4.13.1.5.  Act on the information, as necessary. (T-0). 
4.13.2.  The Privacy Act applies to matching programs that use records from Federal 
personnel or payroll systems and Federal benefit programs where matching: 
4.13.2.1.  Determines Federal benefit eligibility; 
4.13.2.2.  Checks on compliance with benefit program requirements; or 
4.13.2.3.  Recovers improper payments or delinquent debts from current or former 
beneficiaries. 
4.13.3.  Matches used for statistics, pilot programs, law enforcement, tax administration, 
routine administration, background checks and foreign counterintelligence, and internal 
matching that will not cause any adverse action are exempt from Privacy Act matching 
requirements. 
4.13.4.  Any activity that expects to participate in a matching program must contact the AF 
Privacy Officer immediately. System managers must prepare a Computer System Matching 
Agreement notice for publication in the Federal Register, which explains the routine uses that 
permit the processing of personal information to the AF Privacy Officer. Allow 180 days for 
processing requests for a new matching program. (T-0). 
4.13.5.  Individuals must receive notice when they are asked to provide personal information 
that will be used in a matching program as a routine use. The most appropriate method of 
providing notice is to include the Privacy Act Statement on the form used when an individual 
applies for benefits. When the individual completes and submits the form and has been 
provided adequate notice, they are consenting to the routine uses associated with the notice. 
Coordinate appropriate statements with the MAJCOM Privacy Manager and AF Privacy 
Officer. (T-0). 
4.14.  Privacy Act Exemptions. 
4.14.1.  Exemption Types. This section contains the most current exemptions that have been 
published as final rules for the listed SOR as of the date of this instruction. The Information 
System Owners should ensure that a more recent final rule has not been published. There are 
two types of exemptions from release or disclosure permitted by the Privacy Act: 
30 
AFI33-332  10 MARCH 2020CORRECTIVEACTIONSAPPLIED12MAY2020 
4.14.1.1.  A General exemption authorizes the exemption of a SOR from most parts of 
the Privacy Act. 
4.14.1.2.  A Specific exemption authorizes the exemption of a SOR from only a few parts 
of the Privacy Act. 
4.14.2.  Authorizing Exemptions. Denial authorities may withhold release or disclosure of 
records to the first party requesters using Privacy Act exemptions only when an exemption 
for the SOR has been published in the Federal Register as a final rule. (See 
https://dpcld.defense.gov/privacy/SORNS.aspx; exemptions are noted in the right column.) 
4.14.3.  Requesting an Exemption. An ISO who believes that a system requires an exemption 
from some or all of the requirements of the Privacy Act shall send a request through the 
Wing Privacy Office, the MAJCOM Privacy Office, and to AF Privacy Office. Final 
approval is granted by Defense Privacy, Civil Liberties, and Transparency Division. The 
request will detail the reasons why the exemption applies, the section of the Act that allows 
the exemption, and the specific subsections of the Privacy Act from which the system is to be 
exempted, with justification for each subsection. 
4.14.4.  Exemptions. Exemptions permissible under the Privacy Act are searchable at

by law enforcement activities whose principal function is criminal law enforcement. 
4.14.4.2.  The (k)(1) exemption. Applies to information specifically authorized to be 
classified according to DoDM 5200.01. 
4.14.4.3.  The (k)(2) exemption. Applies to investigatory information compiled for law- 
enforcement purposes by non-law enforcement activities and which is not within the 
scope of the (j)(2) exemption. However, the AF must allow an individual access to any 
record that is used to deny rights, privileges or benefits to which he or she would 
otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he or she would otherwise be eligible as 
a result of the maintenance of the information (unless doing so would reveal a 
confidential source). (T-0). 
4.14.4.4.  The (k)(3) exemption. Applies to records maintained in connection with 
providing protective services to the President and other individuals under Title 18 United 
States Code Section 3056; Powers, authorities, and duties of United States Secret Service. 
4.14.4.5.  The (k)(4) exemption. Applies to records maintained solely for statistical 
research or program evaluation purposes and which are not used to make decisions on the 
rights, benefits, or entitlement of an individual except for census records which may be 
disclosed under Title 13 United States Code Section 8; Authenticated transcripts or 
copies of certain returns; other data; restriction on use; disposition of fees received. 
4.14.4.6.  The (k)(5) exemption. Applies to investigatory material compiled solely for the 
purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for U.S. civilian 
employment, military service, U.S. contracts, or access to classified information, but only 
to the extent such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source. This 
provision allows protection of confidential sources used in background investigations,

4.14.4.7.  The (k)(6) exemption. Applies to testing or examination material used solely to 
determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal or 
military service, if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test 
or examination process. 
4.14.4.8.  The (k)(7) exemption. Applies to evaluation material used to determine 
potential for promotion in the Military Services, but only to the extent that the disclosure 
of such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.

Chapter 5 
E-GOVERNMENT ACT 
5.1.  Overview of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 USC § 3601. 
5.1.1.  The E-Government Act of 2002 establishes business processes to “provide enhanced 
access to Government information and services in a manner consistent with laws regarding 
protection of personal privacy, national security, records retention, and access for persons 
with disabilities, and other relevant laws.” The Act inserted the Privacy Impact Assessment 
(PIA) into the government IT lifecycle.  PIAs are required for all IT systems that collect, 
maintain, or disseminate information in identifiable form or that make substantial changes to 
existing information technology that manages information in identifiable form.  PIA 
implementation for DoD IT investments is defined in DoDI 5400.16. 
5.2.  Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA). 
5.2.1.  Evaluate Information Systems Risk Management Framework. Information System 
owner (ISO), Information System Security Manager (ISSM), Information System Security 
Officer (ISSO), Portfolio Managers, and Program Managers/Project Managers shall address 
risks assessment on PII in an IT system and plan the integration of privacy protections with 
appropriate Information Assurance (IA) controls into the development life cycle of an 
information system. A PIA shall be completed in accordance with DoDI 5400.16. (T-0). 
5.2.2.  What is a PIA?  A PIA is an analysis of how information in identifiable form is 
collected, stored, protected, shared, and managed. The purpose of a PIA is to demonstrate 
that system owners and developers have incorporated privacy protections throughout the 
entire life cycle of a system. 
5.2.3.  When must a PIA be conducted? 
5.2.3.1.  The E-Government Act of 2002 and DoDI 5400.16 require PIAs to be conducted 
before developing or procuring IT systems or projects that collect, maintain, or 
disseminate information in identifiable form from or about individuals as defined in DoD 
5400.11-R. 
5.2.3.2.  PIAs are required to be performed, approved and/or updated as necessary when a 
system change exposes a new privacy risk for which an IA control must be identified and 
tested before re-deployment or re-release of the system to include National Security 
System and systems that do not contain PII. (T-1).

Chapter 6 
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN) REDUCTION PLAN 
6.1.  Social Security Number (SSN) Reduction Plan.  The stated intention of the Social 
Security Reduction Plan is to reduce or eliminate the use of SSN in DoD and AF systems of 
records, IT systems and forms in accordance with DoDI 1000.30, Reduction of Social Security 
Number (SSN) Use Within DoD. The Functional office that owns the record for which SSNs are 
required to be collected is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for submitting a SSN 
Justification memorandum with respect to the collection of SSNs for those records. Records 
Professional, Privacy Manager, and Forms Manager will assist to ensure compliance with the 
SSN reduction plan requirements. As such there is no need to use the SSN for individuals to 
authenticate themselves as part of every transaction. DoDI 1000.30, is in effect and establishes 
the following: 
6.1.1.  Acceptable Uses. Use of the SSN includes the SSN in any form, including, but not 
limited to truncated, masked, partially masked, encrypted, or disguised SSN. The acceptable 
uses of the SSN are those that are provided for by law, require interoperability with 
organizations beyond the DoD, or are required by operational necessities. Such operational 
necessities may be the result of the inability to alter systems, processes, or forms due to cost 
or unacceptable levels of risk. Those systems, processes, or forms that claim “operational 
necessity” shall be closely scrutinized. Ease of use and unwillingness to change are not 
acceptable justifications for continuing to collect SSNs. (T-0). 
6.1.2.  Documenting Acceptable Uses of SSN and other PII specifically. The authorization 
for use of PII is governed through DoD 5400.11-R. The method by which SSN use is 
documented shall be consistent with existing Privacy Program requirements for forms, 
processes, IT systems, and systems of records, to include any locally created applications. 
(T-0). 
6.1.3.  In addition to the documentation required for the use of PII in the PIA and/or SORN, 
the use of the SSN in any form as part of any collection, transfer, or retention, including 
locally created user applications, must be specifically documented and justified. 
Documentation of the SSN justification shall be retained and available upon request. (T-0). 
6.2.  The Specific Requirement for Use of the SSN. 
6.2.1.  Forms that collect SSN must have a completed AF Form 673 and a justification 
memorandum stating the justification for use of the SSN that is addressed to and approved by 
AF Privacy Officer. Submit items to appropriate Forms Manager in accordance with AFI 33-
360. (T-1). 
6.2.2.  A senior official (flag officer or SES equivalent) shall sign the SSN Justification 
Memorandum stating the justification for use of the SSN. It is unacceptable to collect, retain, 
use or transfer SSN without an approved justification. (T-1). 
6.2.3.  The SSN Justification Memo that approves collection of SSN in an IT System shall be 
forwarded with the PIA and/or SORN to the AF Privacy Officer. The justification memo will 
be addressed to Defense Privacy Office for approval/disapproval. (See Attachment 5.) (T-1). 
36 
AFI33-332  10 MARCH 2020CORRECTIVEACTIONSAPPLIED12MAY2020 
6.2.4.  The Defense Privacy, Civil Liberties, and Transparency Division reviews SSN 
justifications for IT systems as an adjunct to the biennial PII review process. When 
justification for SSN use is rejected, the action officer will prepare a plan, to include 
milestones and a timeline, for the elimination of SSN usage. (T-0). 
6.2.5.  Periodic Review of SSN Use and Justification. SSN use and justification memo 
review is a responsibility under the biennial review process for all forms. IT systems 
Justification memos shall be reviewed in conjunction with the FISMA Annual review. (T-0). 
6.2.6.  Requesting the Social Security Number (SSN). When requesting an individual’s SSN 
always provide a Privacy Act Statement or Privacy Advisory, as applicable. (T-1). 
6.3.  Alternative Means of Identifying Records.  When law, executive order, or regulation does 
not require disclosing the SSN or if the SOR was created after January 1, 1975, a SSN may be 
requested, but the individual is not required to disclose it. If the individual refuses to provide 
their information, use alternative means of identifying records. Executive Order (E.O.) 9397, 
Numbering System for Federal Accounts Relating to Individual Persons, November 22, 1943, 
was amended by E.O. 13478, Amendments to Executive Order 9397 Relating to Federal Agency 
Use of Social Security Numbers, November 18, 2008, which emphasizes the need to protect PII 
and deletes the mandatory requirement to collecting SSNs. E.O. 9397 (SSN), as amended (E.O. 
13478) shall be referenced when cited in a Privacy Act Statement, Privacy Advisory, PIA and 
SORN whenever a SSN is collected, used, stored, or disseminated for acceptable uses within AF 
IT systems, on AF Forms, or in other physical media systems of records. IT systems, AF Forms, 
and AF records OPRs should also consult DoDI 1000.30, enclosure 2, paragraph 2, Acceptable 
Uses. Contact the OPR’s organizational Privacy Office for assistance. (T-0). 
6.4.  Protection of SSN.  SSNs are personal and unique to each individual. The SSN in any 
form, including, but not limited to truncated (last 4 or 5), masked, partially masked, encrypted, or 
disguised SSN will be Protected as High Impact PII and marked FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 
(FOUO). Within DoD, do not disclose a person’s SSN to another person without an official 
need-to-know or consent of the individual. Release of SSNs outside of the DoD is not permitted 
without the person’s consent or unless authorized under one of the twelve exceptions to the 
Privacy Act (See https://www.privacy.af.mil/Home/Privacy-Act-Exceptions/.) (T-0). 
6.5.  Reporting Results of Social Security Number Reduction. 
6.5.1.  New Departmental Forms. The AF Departmental Forms Management Officer shall 
maintain a database to produce an annual report every July 1st. This report shall be an input 
into the Privacy Act section of the annual FISMA Report as required by Title 44 United 
States Code, Chapter 35, and Subchapter III. The annual report shall contain the following 
elements: 
6.5.1.1.  Number of forms reviewed. (T-1). 
6.5.1.2.  Number of forms requesting SSNs. (T-1). 
6.5.1.3.  Number of SSN justifications accepted and rejected. (T-1).

6.5.1.8.  For existing forms issued below departmental level (MAJCOM, Wing, etc.), no 
reports are required at command and or base levels, with the exception of sharing best 
practices of specific examples where SSNs were eliminated or better masked, or for 
metrics collection at the AF level. (T-1).

considered alterations unless they truly alter the character and purpose of the system. Increases 
that change significantly the scope of population covered (for example, expansion of a SOR 
covering a single command’s enlisted personnel to include all of the Component’s enlisted 
personnel would be considered an alteration). A reduction in the number of individuals covered 
is not an alteration, but only an amendment. Changes that add new categories of individuals to 
system coverage require a change to the “Categories of individuals covered by the system” 
caption of the notice and may require changes to the “Purpose(s)” caption. 
Biometric—Physiological and/or behavioral characteristics that are measurable and can be used 
to verify the identity of an individual. 
Civil Liberties—Fundamental rights and freedoms protected by The Constitution of the United 
States.

RISK ASSESSMENT 
A3.1.  Risk Notification.  Factors are used when determining if an agency is required to notify 
those who may have been affected by a PII breach. Agencies should take the time to determine 
the risk of harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or unfairness surrounding the breach. The 
factors used in assessing the likely risk of harm are: 
A3.1.1.  Nature of Data Elements Breached. Consider context of the data involved and the 
potential harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or unfairness that might be generated by its 
exposure to unauthorized individuals. 
A3.1.2.  Likelihood the Information is Accessible and Useable. Upon discovery of a breach, 
agencies should assess the likelihood the personally identifiable information has been or will 
be used by unauthorized individuals. The greater the risk that the information may be used 
unlawfully should influence an agency’s decision to provide notification to the individual(s). 
A3.1.3.  Likelihood the breach may lead to harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or 
unfairness to an individual. 
A3.1.3.1.  Broad Reach of Potential Harm, Embarrassment, Inconvenience or Unfairness. 
Consider the possible harm associated with the loss or compromise of the PII, i.e., loss of 
self- esteem, mental pain or emotional stress. 
A3.1.3.2.  Likelihood Harm, Embarrassment, Inconvenience or Unfairness Will Occur. 
Agencies must determine the type of data has been compromised and the manner the 
breach occurred. 
A3.1.4.  Ability of the Agencies to Mitigate the Risk of Harm, Embarrassment, 
Inconvenience or Unfairness. In addition to containing the breach, agencies must determine 
what countermeasures will be used to prevent further compromise of the system’s PII.

EXAMPLE PRIVACY BREACH NOTIFICATION LETTER OFFICIAL LETTERHEAD 
Figure A4.1.  Example Privacy Breach Notification Letter Official Letterhead 
Dear Mr. John Miller: 
 
On 3 January 2020, an individual assigned to XXX unit, sent an e-mail with an attachment (alpha 
roster, recall roster, and information document) containing your Personal Information which may 
be protected under the Privacy Act of 1974 from their government e-mail to their personal e-mail 
account. i.e. Yahoo, Gmail, or Hotmail. The e-mail contained your name, social security number, 
residential address, date of birth, personal e-mail address, and home telephone numbers. 
Based on the preliminary investigation, we have determined there was no malicious intent. 
We recommend you visit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on its website at 
http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0275-place-fraud-alert. 
The 
FTC 
urges 
that 
you 
immediately place an initial fraud alert on your credit file. The fraud alert is for a period of 90 
days, during which, creditors are required to contact you before a new credit card is issued or an 
existing card changed. The site also provides other valuable information that can be taken now or 
in the future if problems should develop. The Air Force does not endorse this site or provide 
fraud credit protection. 
As the commander of xxxxxx, I take this loss very seriously and I am reviewing our current 
policies and practices to determine what must be changed to preclude a similar occurrence in the 
future. At a minimum, I will be providing additional training to personnel to ensure that they 
understand the importance of safeguarding individual’s Personal Information at all times and 
must be treated in a manner that preserves and protects the confidentiality of the individual. 
I deeply regret and apologize for any inconvenience and concern this may cause you. 
Should you have any questions, please call. 
Sincerely, Signature Block 
(Directorate level or higher)

NOTIONAL COMPLAINT VIGNETTES 
Figure A7.1.  Notional Complaint Vignettes 
Disclaimer: Vignettes are provided for the instructional purpose of teaching how to identify Civil 
Liberties related issues only. They do not reflect official policies or positions of the Department 
of Defense. 
1. Religion. 
a. Scenario: During the work day, a military unit attended a religious themed movie at the base 
theater. Members were given the choice of watching the movie or cleaning the barracks while the 
unit watched the movie. A week later a member of the unit submitted a complaint. In his 
complaint, he said he chose to watch the movie because he viewed cleaning the barracks as 
punishment, but now he feels like his religious freedom was violated. He does not think a 
punishment, like cleaning the barracks, should be an alternative to watching a religious themed 
movie. 
b. Civil Liberties Issue: First Amendment; Freedom of Religion. A service member should not be 
punished for participating or not participating in a religious activity. If the service member's 
belief that he faced a punishment for not attending the movie is accurate, his unit leadership 
should be counseled about the necessity of allowing for unit member religious freedom without 
the threat of punishment. 
2. Social Media Use & Operational Security. 
a. Scenario: A deployed service member posted a photograph on Facebook. The caption 
indicated that his team had just returned from a patrol, and the date/time stamp on the photo 
showed exactly when it was taken. The service member’s chain of command told him to take 
down the photograph, to protect operational security. However, the service member stated that he 
was using his personal Facebook account, during his personal time (not while on duty), and not 
claiming to represent or speak for the military. 
b. Civil Liberties Issue: Freedom of Speech/Expression. While individuals have a right to 
express themselves through online social media outlets, such expression must not compromise 
operational security. DTM 09-026, “Responsible and Effective Use of Internet-based 
Capabilities,” Attachment 2, section 5, states that “when accessing Internet-based capabilities 
using Federal Government resources in an authorized personal or unofficial capacity, individuals 
shall employ sound operations security (OPSEC) measures.” Other regulations, like the “Joint 
Ethics Regulation and the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive 
Branch,” prohibit the release of non-public information, require appropriate disclaimers of 
opinions being expressed, and restrict the use of government computers to access and to manage 
personal sites during official duty time. 
3. Service Members’ Political Involvement. 
a. Scenario: An active-duty service member placed a bumper sticker on his privately owned 
vehicle. The chain of command told the service member to remove the sticker, but the service 
member refused, citing his Constitutional right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression. 
b. Civil Liberties Issue: Freedom of Speech/Expression/Assembly (to the extent that showcasing 
one’s political affiliation constitutes assembly). In keeping with the traditional concept that 
service members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity, and that service 
members not on active duty should avoid inferences that their political activities imply or appear 
58 
AFI33-332  10 MARCH 2020CORRECTIVEACTIONSAPPLIED12MAY2020 
to imply official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement, the military may regulate service 
members’ participation in political activities. According to DoDD 1344.10, Political Activities by 
Members of the Armed Forces, Sec 4.1.1.8. “A member of the Armed Forces on active duty may: 
display a political bumper sticker on the member’s private vehicle.” In this case, the Directive 
regulating such participation allows the service member to display the bumper sticker. Unit 
leadership should be counseled about DoD policies regulating service members’ participation in 
political activities. 
4. Search and Seizure. 
a. Scenario: A DoD civilian, employed at a CONUS Air Force base, was randomly selected to 
have his vehicle searched at the gate. The gate guard inspected the engine compartment, exterior 
and undercarriage of the vehicle, and the interior of the vehicle, including the glove box and 
consoles. The employee submitted a complaint to the base Civil Liberties Officer, alleging that a 
search of the glove box and consoles was excessive and unreasonable. 
b. Civil Liberties Issue: Right to be Secure against Unreasonable Searches and Seizures. 
Installation commanders issue regulations for the protection and security of property or places 
under their command. The search followed established procedures for vehicle searches, per 
direction provided in AFI 31-218, Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision. In evaluating this type of 
case, consider whether a command authorizes the search of glove boxes and consoles. For 
example, the AFI instructs officials conducting searches of vehicles entering a military 
installation to “look under all seats, under/behind dash, glove box, consoles, visors, ashtrays and 
any packages and briefcases.” 
5. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell – With Speech/Religion Implications. 
a. Scenario: A service member speaks with a friend, informally on base, about the repeal of 
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. The service member, consistent with her religion, expressed opposition to 
homosexuality. The service member’s senior overheard comments and told her to stop 
expressing these views on base. The service member filed a Civil Liberties complaint, alleging 
that her freedom of speech/religion was violated when she was told to stop expressing her 
religious views on base. 
b. Civil Liberties Issue: Freedom of Speech/Religion. Service members may express moral or 
religious beliefs, so long as service members do NOT make statements detrimental to good order 
and discipline, and so long as service members obey lawful orders. Whether or not the service 
member’s Civil Liberties were, in fact, violated is dependent upon whether or not her comments 
fall within the constraints articulated in the direction above. 
6. Carrying Privately Owned Weapons on Military Installations. 
a. Scenario: Service member living in family housing on a Marine Corps base is required to 
report to the Provost Marshall that she possesses a firearm and stores it at her home. The service 
member filed a complaint with the Civil Liberties POC arguing that the Provost Marshall should 
not be keeping records on how she exercises her right to keep and bear arms. 
b. Civil Liberties Issue: Right to Keep and Bear Arms. In reviewing the service member's 
complaint, consider whether the Provost Marshall’s requirement to report the firearm is 
authorized by a base order or other regulation. 
7. Civilian Employment Complaint. 
a. Scenario: A DoD civilian supervisor typically allows overtime for all employees who 
volunteer. However, a civilian employee in that office submitted a complaint, alleging that he 
has not been allowed to work overtime because the supervisor saw him at an anti-war protest on 
a Saturday last year. His complaint letter alleged that because his supervisor will not allow him 
AFI33-332  10 MARCH 2020CORRECTIVEACTIONSAPPLIED12MAY2020 
59 
to work overtime, his Civil Liberties are being violated. 
b. Civil Liberties Issue: Right to Due Process. His complaint about not being allowed to work 
overtime, when other workers are encouraged to work overtime, could be a recognized employee 
grievance. Direct him to consider the use of his agency's existing employee grievance process. 
8. Member of Public, Pentagon Protests, and Suspicious Activity Reporting. 
a. Scenario: A member of the public attended a protest at the Pentagon. He followed all rules and 
procedures governing the protest, including not making threatening statements or displaying 
threatening behavior, and complied with instructions from Pentagon Police Officers. The 
individual submitted a complaint alleging that a civilian employee, employed at the Pentagon, 
asked each of the protestors to identify themselves and subsequently stated that he was going to 
identify them in a suspicious activity report, due to their participation in the protest. 
b. Civil Liberties Issue: Freedom of Speech, Peaceable Assembly. Consider whether the Privacy 
Act is implicated by the Pentagon employee’s actions. According to the Privacy Act (5 USC § 
552a(e)(7)), “no information shall be maintained on how an individual exercises rights protected 
by the First Amendment to The Constitution of the United States, including the freedoms of 
speech, assembly, press and religion, except as follows: 
i. When specifically authorized by statute. 
ii. When expressly authorized by the individual, group of individuals, or association on whom 
the record is maintained. 
iii. When the record is pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement 
activity.

CIVIL LIBERTIES COMPLAINT REPORT INSTRUCTIONS 
Figure A8.1.  Civil Liberties Complaint Report Instructions 
Introduction: 
 
Public Law 110-53, Section 803, Privacy and Civil Liberties Officers, Implementing requires the 
Department of Defense to report its Civil Liberties activities to Congress. In order to comply 
with that requirement, each DoD Component must submit a semi-annual Component Privacy and 
Civil Liberties Report, DD Form 2984 to the Defense Privacy, Civil Liberties, and Transparency 
Division. Defense Privacy, Civil Liberties, and Transparency Division will consolidate 
Component data and submit the Department's reports to Congress.

Semi-Annual reports are due by the 10th day of the month following the closing of each fiscal 
year quarter to the AF Civil Liberties POC: usaf.pentagon.saf-cn.mbx.af-privacy@mail.mil  
Component Points of Contact (POCs) Reporting Responsibilities  
POCs are responsible for establishing procedures to report Civil Liberties complaints for their

Component reporting procedures should capture Civil Liberties complaints that may be received 
by offices such as the Inspector General (IG), Equal Employment Opportunity, and Labor 
Management Employee Relations (LMER). Component reporting procedures should also ensure 
that there is no duplicate reporting within the Component.
