Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1.  Purpose.  This publication provides general operational and planning guidance for the 
Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) and Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH) platforms.  It 
provides a source document for developing standardized policies, operating procedures, training 
programs, and allowance standards.  Operation plans and regional guidance provide mission-
specific information that amplify and tailor the guidance contained in this publication. 
1.2.  Background.  The EMEDS platform delivers light, lean, and life-saving medical support to 
deployed forces through the full range of military operations.  EMEDS deploys in capability-based 
modules composed of personnel and equipment unit type code (UTC) building blocks.  EMEDS 
modules are sized to provide the appropriate level of health service support and force health 
protection for each phase of an operation while balancing resource, time, and transportation 
constraints.  Each EMEDS module provides an incremental and interoperable buildup of capability 
that can be tailored on execution.  Since its inception, the EMEDS platform has been the Air Force 
Medical Service’s (AFMS) main deployable medical asset for a variety of ground-based 
contingencies to include combat support operations, domestic disaster relief, and global 
humanitarian crisis assistance. 
1.3.  EMEDS Configuration Updates.  EMEDS capabilities continuously evolve based on 
national defense strategies, Air Force strategic direction, combatant command requirements, 
programmed lifecycle reviews, and lessons learned from real-world operations.  Key configuration 
changes from previous versions include the following: 
1.3.1.  FFGST, Ground Surgical Team, replaces personnel UTCs FFMFS, Mobile Field 
Surgical Team, and FFEP1, Critical Care Team, in the EMEDS Health Response Team (HRT) 
module.  A second Ground Surgical Team is added in the EMEDS+25 module, replacing 
FFEP5, Surgical Augmentation Team.  Several positions were shifted to other EMEDS UTCs.  
See Chapter 2, EXPEDITIONARY GROUND MEDICAL SUPPORT CAPABILITIES, 
for more information on the composition of each module. 
1.3.2.  EMEDS equipment from FFMF1, Mobile Field Surgical Equipment, and FFEPE, 
Critical Care Equipment, moved to FFHR1, EMEDS HRT Equipment.  A separate equipment 
set (FFGS1, Ground Surgical Equipment) was developed to support ground surgical teams that 
have a stand-alone mission in austere environments.  FFGS1 is separate and distinct from the 
EMEDS equipment set.  See AFTTP 3-42.77, Ground Surgical Team (GST), for more 
information on the ground surgical team’s stand-alone capabilities. 
1.3.3.  The transition to the EMEDS HRT equipment set is complete to include adoption of 
shelters with chemical and biological collective protection infused into the fabric (single-skin 
shelters). 
1.3.4.  Key equipment changes to the allowance standards since the last program review 
include modernization of the digital radiation system, sterilizer, and defibrillators. 
1.3.5.  The baseline configuration for the deployable AFTH has changed from 58 beds to 87 
based on the revised Medical Resourcing Letter (MRL).  Several specialty UTCs were 
combined to simplify planning and minimize the number of single-person UTCs.

1.4.  Medical Threat Environment.  The health threat to bed-down populations varies 
considerably within the range of military operations.  Disease and injury resulting from the total 
force environment (such as endemic disease, food and water contamination, environmental 
extremes, hazardous exposures, and occupational accidents) have historically accounted for the 
majority of hospitalizations in deployed environments (Source:  Joint Publication [JP] 4-02, Joint 
Health Services).  The current National Defense Strategy and supporting Joint and Air Force 
doctrine outline a security environment marked by complex interactions between a rapidly 
changing global balance of military capabilities, emerging technologies, and competitor doctrines 
that threaten strategic stability.  Strategic competitors and non-state actors possess the means, 
ranging from cyber tools to weapons of mass destruction, to disrupt operations and inflict scalable 
harm to deployed forces.  A key impact for medical support is that the range, quantity, and lethality 
of these systems threaten the U.S. network of fixed forward bases, putting at risk the traditional 
continuum of care.  Besides treating routine illness and injury, expeditionary ground medical 
facilities could encounter potentially larger casualty streams and patients exposed to chemical, 
biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents, directed energy weapons, and other offensive 
capabilities. 
1.4.1.  Disease and injury induced by operational conditions are a consistent threat to air 
expeditionary forces.  This threat varies depending on endemic disease, climate, terrain, 
socioeconomic conditions, and other occupational and environmental health hazards 
associated with the deployed environment.  Managing this threat involves a combination of 
preventative medicine, theater epidemiology, diagnostics, proper sanitation and waste 
management, and medical intelligence data. 
1.4.2.  Conventional and unconventional weapons have the potential to inflict varying degrees 
of trauma, damage or destruction of critical equipment, systems, and infrastructure, and 
widespread collateral damage.  A strike can come with little to no warning, producing a 
casualty stream that quickly overwhelms the medical facility.  Airfield battle damage could 
drive longer patient hold times.  Effective traumatic injury therapy relies on equipment and 
techniques that meet the current standard of care, access to advanced diagnostic and testing 
capabilities, real-time telemedicine support, and patient movement support. 
1.4.3.  The release of CBRN agents has the potential to significantly burden or overwhelm the 
medical system.  These agents can cause early clinical symptoms that mimic routine medical 
conditions and delay detection.  Physically healthy personnel fearing possible exposure might 
overwhelm the medical treatment facility to seek treatment (known as worried well).  These 
incidents could force personnel to operate in a restrictive, protective environment for days.  
Platforms and materiel might become contaminated and present a health risk to personnel or 
cross-contamination risk.  Managing this threat involves an overarching and robust force health 
protection strategy that includes passive defense, surveillance, detection, identification, and 
consequence management.  Effective treatment requires appropriate supply levels and medical 
support personnel, ability to process tests and data rapidly, access to medical intelligence and 
information management systems, advanced diagnostic capabilities, real-time telemedicine 
support, and patient movement support.

Chapter 2 
EXPEDITIONARY GROUND MEDICAL SUPPORT CAPABILITIES 
2.1.  Mission.  The EMEDS platform provides individual bed-down and theater-level medical 
services for deployed forces and select population groups.  The primary mission is to provide 
essential health service support, force health protection, and stabilization to ensure a fit and healthy 
force, optimize return to duty, and improve survivability.  Core capabilities include forward 
resuscitative care, primary care, dental services, and preventive medicine.  Its modular and scalable 
design allows the Air Force to deploy medical capabilities ranging from small teams that provide 
highly skilled medical care for a small number of casualties to a large medical system that can 
provide specialized care to a population at risk over 6,500.  EMEDS capabilities are grouped into 
distinct medical support packages that provide an incremental buildup of capability:  EMEDS 
HRT, EMEDS+10, and EMEDS+25.  AFTHs are built by adding medical specialty and support 
UTCs to an EMEDS+25 foundation. 
2.2.  Scope of Care.  Expeditionary ground medical facilities provide essential care focused on 
treating casualties for return to duty or stabilization for movement to a higher level of care.  
Deployed medical facilities normally do not provide definitive care, such as reconstructive 
surgery, rehabilitation, or convalescent care. 
2.3.  Planning Assumptions.  The EMEDS platform provides a rapidly deployable, tailored 
medical response designed to minimize forward footprint and airlift requirements.  Medical 
support requirements for a deployed location are based on several factors such as patient 
population, anticipated force health protection threats, projected patient streams, and strategic 
airlift availability.  Configuration of medical support packages, estimated operational timelines, 
and other employment concepts are based on the following planning assumptions. 
• 
Transportation is available to move personnel, equipment, and supplies. 
• 
Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) or base operating support (BOS) is available.  
• 
The patient population consists of military personnel, emergency essential civilians and 
contractors, additive forces, and mobilization augmentees on base. 
• 
Local nationals are not factored into the population at risk.  In humanitarian assistance, 
disaster relief, and stability operations, patient throughput projections are based on estimated 
injury and regional disease rates. 
• 
The supported U.S. military population has received pre-deployment medical screening, 
prophylaxis, immunizations, Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) training, and applicable 
reporting instructions. 
• 
Military personnel are either returned to duty or evacuated in accordance with theater 
policy. 
• 
In humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and stability operations, medical personnel 
coordinate movement of civilian patients with host nation and local hospitals. 
• 
Members deploy with, or have pre-positioned, adequate chemical warfare defense 
ensembles in accordance with reporting instructions. 
2.4.  EMEDS Health Response Team (HRT).  EMEDS HRT is the first increment of EMEDS 
capability.  It provides Role 2E capabilities for a population at risk up to 3,000.  EMEDS HRT is 
equipped to stabilize and hold 4 patients for 24 hours.  Core capabilities generally include medical 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
9 
command and control, health administration, medical logistics, health information systems 
management, damage control surgery and resuscitation, surgical and post-operative critical care, 
flight medicine, dental, bioenvironmental engineering, and public health.  Specialty care 
capabilities typically include internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN), and pediatrics.  
Designed for rapid response, EMEDS HRT can deploy within 24 hours of notification and quickly 
establish essential medical capabilities upon arrival:  emergency room within 2 hours, operating 
room within 4 hours, and critical care within 6 hours.  It can reach full operational capability within 
12 hours of arrival.  EMEDS HRT typically supports the early phases of military operations in 
austere environments and requires reinforcement of personnel and equipment after 10 days.  Table 
2.1 provides the personnel details and Table 2.2 lists the equipment packages for the EMEDS 
HRT module.

2E capabilities for a population at risk of 3,000-5,000.  EMEDS+10 maintains a similar scope of 
care as EMEDS HRT with increased staffing, holding capacity, diagnostic capabilities, and 
medical materiel to support a larger population.  It can hold 10 patients (4 critical) for 24 hours.  
Added capabilities include advanced cardiac life support, advanced trauma life support, oxygen 
generation, lab, and limited blood banking.  When deployed as a whole module, EMEDS+10 can 
reach full operational capability within 36 hours of arrival.  Table 2.3 provides the personnel 
details and Table 2.4 lists the equipment for the EMEDS+10 module.

2.7.  Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH).  AFTHs provide dedicated in-theater and en-route 
Role 3 medical support to a population at risk of 6,500 and above.  They are usually located at 
strategic air hubs to facilitate patient movement to definitive care facilities in the continental 
United States (CONUS) and designated facilities outside the continental United States 
(OCONUS).  Deployable AFTHs are built by adding medical support and expansion UTCs to an 
EMEDS+25 foundation.  AFTH expansion packages are modular and can be added in multiple 
sets to expand medical ward capability in 25-bed increments, critical care capability in 4-bed 
increments, and operating room capability in 2-bed increments.  Medical and surgical 
subspecialties can be added as needed.  AFTHs are the largest of the Air Force deployed ground 
medical facilities.  The baseline configuration starts at 87 beds, which includes 75 medical/surgical 
beds and 16 critical care beds.  It has 3 operating rooms and 6 operating tables.  Table 2.7 lists the 
personnel and equipment UTCs typically included in an 87-bed AFTH.

2.9.  Collectively Protected EMEDS (CP-EMEDS).  CP-EMEDS provides the equipment to 
chemically and biologically harden an EMEDS facility.  When properly configured and 
maintained, it allows up to 72 hours of continued, enclosed operations following a chemical or 
biological incident.  These equipment sets can be added to any EMEDS configuration deploying 
to areas with a CBRN threat.  CP-EMEDS equipment consists of chemically hardened 
environmental control units, filtered air blowers, airlocks, pressure alarms, and a water distribution 
system.  The water distribution system provides potable water flow and wastewater recovery to all 
areas of the medical facility.  It requires ECS/BOS for potable water supply and wastewater 
disposal.  EMEDS shelters have a chemical-biological barrier infused into the fabric (single-skin 
protection).  See the UTS Systems Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) Single Skin 
Operators Manual for instructions on shelter assembly and maintenance.  This document and other 
reference materials are available on the Air Combat Command Surgeon (ACC/SG) Ground 
Medical UTC Management website’s Biomedical Equipment and Logistics page at 
https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/12173/SitePages/BMET.aspx or by request from the ACC/SGXM 
Ground Medical UTC Management Branch (acc.sgxm@us.af.mil).  Table 2.9 lists the CP-
EMEDS components for each EMEDS module.

2.10.  Initial Operational Capability Timelines.  EMEDS HRT establishes the initial operational 
capability for the EMEDS platform.  Equipment packaging and load plans prioritize rapid setup 
and provision of stabilizing medical care.  Initial capabilities include essential and emergent care, 
damage control surgery, damage control resuscitation, limited post-operative critical care, and 
initial health assessments of the area.  Table 2.10 lists the key functions that need to be in place 
and target timelines to achieve this milestone.  These timelines assume delivery of EMEDS HRT 
equipment and arrival of personnel at the operating site. 
Table 2.10.  Initial Operational Capability Timelines.

2.11.  Full Operational Capability Timelines.  Each EMEDS module provides an incremental 
buildup of capability.  As the size and scope of capability increases, so does the timeline required 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
19 
to reach full operational capability:  12 hours for EMEDS HRT, 36 hours for EMEDS+10, and 60 
hours for EMEDS+25.  These timelines have been tested in numerous field development exercises.  
Many factors can impact these timelines in real-world deployments such as weather conditions, 
terrain, delivery of equipment, and availability of ECS/BOS.  (Note:  AFTH operational capability 
timelines have not been tested.)  The following functions need to be in place to achieve full 
operational capability. 
• 
Shelters and full infrastructure are installed and operational (such as, power, lights, 
environmental control units, heating, ventilation, air conditioning [HVAC], water, sanitation). 
• 
Command and control functions are in place to include medical control center operations, 
administration, patient movement coordination, operational reporting, and communications 
systems. 
• 
All medical/surgical functions are in place and ready to provide their full scope of care. 
• 
All mission-essential equipment and instrumentation are in place and functional. 
• 
All medical support functions are in place. 
• 
Initial occupational, environmental, and public health site assessments are complete, a 
safe source of water and food have been procured, and the health risk baseline has been 
established.  
2.12.  EMEDS Functional Area Descriptions and Buildup.  EMEDS functional areas mirror the 
organization and structure of in-garrison operations to the extent possible.  In the early phases of 
operations and during surges, team members may need to provide cross-functional surge support 
commensurate with their skills and scope of practice. 
2.12.1.  Ambulance Services.  EMEDS facilities rely on pre-positioned ambulances, vehicles 
of opportunity, or rental vehicles for emergency transport.  These vehicles are base 
transportation assets.  Two vehicles are normally required to support flight line and emergency 
medical service response.  The EMEDS equipment package provides life-support equipment 
and supplies to support two ambulances.  An ambulance support equipment package (FFAMB) 
can be requested if additional supplies are needed (for example, to support an additional 
vehicle).  AFTHs include an ambulance support team (FFGLE) and additional ambulance 
support equipment. 
2.12.2.  Critical Care.  EMEDS provides critical care, respiratory therapy, and post-anesthesia 
care to a variety of trauma, surgical, and medical patients.  EMEDS HRT provides a critical 
care surge capability that can hold four critical care patients for 24 hours.  The Ground Surgical 
Team (FFGST) provides the core critical care staffing for EMEDS.  When their specialty skills 
are not in demand, the critical care staff can provide surge support in the emergency room and 
medical ward.  At the EMEDS HRT level, all clinical functions share equipment and supplies 
from the EMEDS HRT equipment package (FFHR1).  This equipment includes vital-sign 
monitoring devices, ventilators, defibrillators, and suction machines.  The EMEDS+10 
(FFEE2) and EMEDS+25 (FFEE3) equipment sets provide dedicated critical care supplies and 
equipment.  The EMEDS+10 personnel package (FFEP3) provides additional critical care 
nursing personnel to support the increased patient population.  EMEDS+25 includes two 
Ground Surgical Teams.  An AFTH typically has a minimum of 16 critical care beds (4 beds 
from FFHR1 plus 3 FFCC1s [12 beds]) with dedicated critical care staff.  The 4-Bed Intensive 
Care Unit (FFCCU) provides critical care physician, nursing, and respiratory care staff.  The 
4-Bed Intensive Care Expansion Team (FFCCV) provides additional nursing support staff for 
20 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
expansions beyond 4 beds.  Table 2.11 lists the typical personnel and equipment mapping for 
critical care expansions up to 16 additional beds (20 total).  For guidance on the equipment and 
personnel laydown for larger expansions, contact ACC/SGXM at acc.sgxm@us.af.mil.

OPERATIONS 
3.1.  EMEDS UTC Posturing.  EMEDS UTCs are postured against units in the Unit Type Code 
Availability database and MRL.  EMEDS equipment and facility infrastructure packages might be 
pre-positioned in theater based on requirements from geographic combatant commanders and the 
Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR). 
3.2.  Deployment Planning.  Planners consider many factors, such as operational environment, 
pre-positioned materiel, host nation support agreements, contingency contracts, and acquisition 
cross-service agreements, in planning deployments and tailoring unit-level personnel and 
equipment requirements.  Time-phased force deployment data (TPFDD) is built by the air 
component and flowed through the major commands to the wing plans and operations centers for 
action. 
3.3.  Pre-Deployment Preparations.  Upon receipt of an alert, prepare to deploy, warning order, 
or other notification from higher headquarters, the medical readiness office provides a pre-
deployment briefing to review key documents and responsibilities with the deploying EMEDS 
commander and UTC team chiefs.  This information typically includes the deployment order, 
TPFDD, pre-deployment training requirements, force protection threats, and intelligence reports.  
EMEDS commanders are responsible for ensuring that all deploying personnel and equipment 
meet the tasking requirements defined by the supported command.  EMEDS commanders should 
review Attachment 15, EMEDS COMMANDER PRE-DEPLOYMENT AND POST 
ARRIVAL CHECKLIST, for general pre-deployment guidelines and recommendations.  Many 
of these guidelines are based on commander feedback and lessons learned.  Individual deploying 
personnel follow the pre-deployment requirements in AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and 
Execution.  
3.3.1.  Provider Credentialing.  To expedite privileging action, deploying medical units should 
provide an interfacility credentials transfer brief at least 15 days before the unit’s arrival date 
when possible.  Some host nations may require copies of various credentials such as licenses 
or Basic Life Support or Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support certification.  All clinical 
providers should have a copy of their interfacility credentials transfer brief and current 
privilege list. 
3.3.2.  Equipment and Cargo.  UTC team chiefs should assess the deployability of assigned 
equipment UTCs with medical logistics personnel and identify shortfalls.  Deploying EMEDS 
commanders should ensure an adequate number of personnel are qualified in pallet build-up 
and cargo handling procedures (to include hazardous, protected, and classified cargo) to serve 
as cargo increment monitors during deployment and redeployment in accordance with AFI 10-
403. 
3.3.2.1.  Hazardous cargo is subject to Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9-
R Part III, Mobility, AFMAN 24-604, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air 
Shipments, and host nation requirements.  EMEDS commanders should ensure an adequate 
number of EMEDS personnel are appointed and trained as packers, handlers, inspectors, 
and certifying officials. 
28 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
3.3.2.2.  Protected cargo includes controlled substances, items vulnerable to theft, and 
weapons and ammunition.  A controlled medical item custodian should witness and verify 
the packaging of medically controlled items.  At the deployed location, controlled items 
should be stored in locked rooms or containers and managed in accordance with AFMAN 
41-209.  Units are responsible for assigning primary and alternate weapons and 
ammunition couriers to ensure security and accountability during transit in accordance with 
Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 31-101, Integrated Defense (ID), and 
Department of the Air Force Manual (DAFMAN) 21-201, Munitions Management. 
3.3.2.3.  Classified material should be packaged, marked, safeguarded, and transported in 
accordance with DAFI 24-602, Volume 2, Cargo Movement.  Units are responsible for 
assigning appropriately cleared and trained couriers to accompany classified material. 
3.3.2.4.  The medical logistics lead should coordinate with the Air Force Medical Logistics 
Operations Center (AFMLOC) before deployment to formalize resupply and equipment 
repair channels.  They should track outbound equipment UTCs, and upon arrival at the 
bed-down location, verify that all equipment has arrived. 
3.4.  Employment.  EMEDS typically deploys as part of an air expeditionary task force and is an 
integral component of the support elements required to open, establish, and operate an airbase.  In 
the early phase of an operation, priorities are to establish medical command and control, provide 
limited, essential and emergent clinical care, and provide medical input into site selection and 
facility layout based on initial occupational, environmental, and public health assessments.  Many 
of these activities are critical to the mission’s success and should occur within the first 48 hours.  
See Attachment 15, EMEDS COMMANDER PRE-DEPLOYMENT AND POST ARRIVAL 
CHECKLIST, for general guidelines and recommendations. 
3.4.1.  Patient Movement.  EMEDS has limited patient holding capacity and relies on patient 
movement support for mission success.  Casualties are typically reported for evacuation from 
EMEDS to the next appropriate level of care when they are not expected to return to duty 
within the timeframe prescribed in the theater evacuation policy.  EMEDS health services 
administrators submit patient movement requests to the United States Transportation 
Command Patient Movement Requirements Center (TPMRC) in accordance with theater 
policy and DAFI 48-107, Volume 1, En Route Care and Aeromedical Evacuation Medical 
Operations.  Casualties should be transported with their medical records, personal effects, and 
medically essential items. 
3.4.1.1.  EMEDS commanders should coordinate requirements for patient movement items 
(PMI) with the En Route Care system in advance of sending and receiving patients to 
ensure adequate quantities are available.  Otherwise, the EMEDS facility may be 
responsible for supplying these items. 
3.4.1.2.  The attending physician is responsible for ensuring that all necessary forms (such 
as Air Force [AF] Form 3899, Patient Movement Record, or DD Form 1380, Tactical 
Combat Casualty Care [TCCC] Card) are completed in accordance with DAFI 48-107, 
Volume 3, En Route Care Documentation.  EMEDS personnel should consult with the 
Aeromedical Evacuation Liaison Team (AELT) for fixed wing evacuation requests to 
ensure documentation, patient safety, equipment, medication, and other logistical 
requirements are met. 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024

3.4.2.  Patient Safety and Ready Reliable Care.  The Chief of Medical Staff (SGH) appointed 
by the EMEDS commander oversees clinical quality operations, patient safety program 
management, and sustainment of a ready reliable care culture.  The designated Patient Safety 
Manager manages the EMEDS facility’s patient safety program and promotion of Ready 
Reliable Care in accordance with Defense Health Agency-Procedures Manual (DHA-PM) 
Clinical Quality Management in the Military Health System, Volume 1:  General Clinical 
Quality Management, and AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations.  The EMEDS Patient 
Safety Manager position is an additional duty assignment and is typically assigned to a clinical 
nurse.  A trained aerospace medical services technician from the hospital expansion support 
team provides additional support at the AFTH level.  All EMEDS clinical and administrative 
personnel should understand the DOD Patient Safety Program guidance and National Patient 
Safety Goals (NPSG) for hospitals and their application in deployed settings.  Patient safety 
guidelines for EMEDS facilities are available in the Deployed Patient Safety Program Guide.

personnel in accordance with Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 6490.03, Deployment 
Health, AFMAN 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient Administration, and theater 
surgeon policy.  Patient encounter data should be filed electronically through the Theater 
Medical Information Program (TMIP) if network access is available.  If access to TMIP is not 
available, medical personnel should use paper forms.  Examples include Standard Form (SF) 
600, Chronological Record of Medical Care, DD Form 1380, DD Form 3019, Resuscitation 
Record, and AF Form 3899. 
3.4.4.  Health Surveillance and Exposure Tracking.  Throughout the deployment, the PAM 
team is responsible for ongoing health surveillance, including weekly and monthly disease and 
injury reports, entomology, and occupational and environmental health site assessments.  The 
public health officer and bioenvironmental engineer should participate in the Threat Working 
Group to ensure threats and vulnerabilities are adequately addressed and corrective actions are 
identified and implemented.  PAM personnel are responsible for recording and tracking patient 
encounters, occupational and environmental health exposures, and health surveillance data in 
accordance with DODI 6055.05, Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH), DODI 
6490.03, and theater surgeon policy.  TMIP provides the system of record for recording this 
data. 
3.4.5.  Operational Reports.  EMEDS commanders are responsible for submitting required 
operational reports in accordance with AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting (OPREP), and 
specific combatant commander, joint force commander, and commander, Air Force forces 
requirements.  After-action reports and lessons learned are submitted in accordance with AFI 
10-204, Air Force Service Exercise Program and Support to Joint and National Exercise 
Program, and AFI 10-1302, Air Force Lessons Learned Program. 
3.4.6.  Maintenance and Disposition of Records.  Records associated with EMEDS operations 
are maintained and disposed in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule.  
Patient medical records, personally identifiable information, and protected health information 
are managed and protected in accordance with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy and Civil 
Liberties Program, and AFMAN 41-210.  Medical personnel comply with Public Law 93-579 
30 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
(as amended) Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 104-191 (as amended) Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, Freedom of Information Act, Drug 
Abuse and Treatment Act, and Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse amendments. 
3.4.7.  Care for Enemy Prisoners of War.  If tasked to treat an enemy prisoner of war, EMEDS 
commanders should coordinate with security forces or equivalent authority to provide armed 
guards for prisoners.  Following essential care, enemy prisoners of war are transferred to host 
nation or U.S. Army prisoner of war management authorities. 
3.4.8.  Care for Civilians and Non-U.S. Personnel.  The theater combatant commander has 
approval authority to allow treatment at an EMEDS facility for local nationals and non-U.S. 
personnel who become injured as a direct result of U.S. Government operations.  This 
treatment is in accordance with State Department guidance, standardized treaties, and 
agreements with coalition forces.  See Chapter 11, FOREIGN HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE AND STABILITY OPERATIONS, for more information on treatment of 
civilians and non-U.S. personnel as part of a humanitarian assistance or disaster relief 
operation. 
3.4.9.  Mortuary Affairs.  EMEDS is not organized, trained, or equipped for mortuary 
operations and relies on ECS/BOS.  EMEDS personnel should coordinate with mortuary affairs 
for guidance on the transfer of deceased human remains and personal effects in accordance 
with DAFI 34-160, Mortuary Affairs Program, and local procedures.  The EMEDS allowance 
standard includes a small quantity of human remains pouches.  EMEDS is not equipped to 
decontaminate human remains.  EMEDS commanders in conjunction with bioenvironmental 
engineering and public health personnel can provide guidance on medical safety precautions 
for handling contaminated remains. 
3.4.10.  CBRN Threat Environments.  When mission requirements and threat assessments 
warrant, EMEDS deploys with collective protection equipment (CP-EMEDS) to harden the 
facility against chemical and biological contamination.  When properly configured and 
maintained, CP-EMEDS allows up to 72 hours of continued, enclosed operations following a 
chemical or biological incident.  Medical care at EMEDS facilities operating in a contaminated 
environment without collective protection is limited to those functions that can be performed 
while wearing individual protective equipment.  EMEDS personnel should be familiar with the 
CBRN passive defense and consequence management procedures outlined in DAFI 10-2501, 
Emergency Management Program, and DAFI 10-2503, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, 
Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Program.  For guidance on medical operations, see ATP 4-
02.7/MCRP 4-11.1F/NTTP 4-02.7/AFTTP 3-42.3, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and 
Procedures for Health Service Support in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear 
Environment. 
3.4.10.1.  The PAM Counter-CBRN Team (FFPM6) and equipment set (FFPM7) is 
typically force packaged with FFPM1-5 in operating locations with a moderate to high 
CBRN threat.  The team provides bioenvironmental engineering and biomedical laboratory 
personnel for medical CBRN defense, consequence management, and recovery activities.  
See AFTTP 3-42.23 for more information about PAM Counter-CBRN capabilities and 
CBRN defense tasks. 
3.4.10.2.  The Expeditionary Medical Decontamination Team (FFGLB) and equipment 
package (FFGLC) typically deploy with CP-EMEDS to CBRN threat environments.  The 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
31 
team works to remove or neutralize to the extent possible surface CBRN agents from 
combat casualties before entry into the EMEDS/AFTH facility or patient movement.  See 
AFTTP 3-42.33 for patient decontamination procedures.  At EMEDS/AFTH facilities 
where the Expeditionary Medical Decontamination Team is not employed, 
decontamination capabilities are limited to expedient decontamination with soap and 
water. 
3.4.10.3.  Operational decontamination of equipment, environmental control units, 
generators, and shelters depends on the contaminating agent involved and the availability 
of replacement equipment.  Decontamination may not be practical for some equipment (for 
example, uncoated painted equipment). 
3.4.11.  Contagious Casualty Management.  During a contagious disease outbreak or biological 
event, EMEDS commanders should work with the wing or group commander to acquire 
additional space for housing contagious casualties.  It is imperative that contagious casualties 
remain isolated from the non-contagious population.  EMEDS staff should use separate triage 
locations for potentially contagious patients to reduce potential exposure.  In the event of a 
large-scale contagious casualty incident, EMEDS commanders should contact the Air Force 
Forces Surgeon (AFFOR/SG) to request additional resources to contain and manage 
contagious patients.  EMEDS facilities should be prepared to support a contagious casualty 
incident without support from the patient movement system.  See AFTTP 3-42.22 for more 
information on contagious casualty management capabilities and procedures. 
3.5.  EMEDS Redeployment.  EMEDS commanders should actively participate in redeployment 
planning to ensure a time-phased reduction in medical services consistent with the deactivation of 
the deployed location, change in mission, or change in threat scenario.  Most EMEDS personnel 
and equipment typically depart with the bulk of the air expeditionary force.  The EMEDS HRT, 
or a portion thereof, remains to provide emergency medical and surgical capability during the 
ramp-down phase.  EMEDS personnel are responsible for disassembling the EMEDS 
infrastructure and providing loading assistance.  Medical logistics personnel are responsible for 
load plans and shipping manifests in accordance with theater and host nation requirements.  
Equipment and supplies should be decontaminated in accordance with theater policy and 
applicable U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines.  Items not suitable for redeployment (such 
as pharmaceuticals, blood and biological waste, and sterile supplies) should be appropriately 
redirected within the theater or disposed of.

Chapter 4 
COMMAND AND CONTROL RELATIONSHIPS 
4.1.  Command and Control of Expeditionary Ground Medical Teams.  Command and control 
for expeditionary medical units is through line of the Air Force commanders.  Air Force elements 
deployed into a theater are typically aligned under the command of the COMAFFOR.  The 
COMAFFOR exercises administrative control responsibilities for assigned and attached Air Force 
forces.  (Source: Air Force Doctrine Publication [AFDP] 3-30, Command and Control.)  EMEDS 
personnel normally operate under the local direction of the deployed expeditionary unit 
commander (usually the EMEDS or AFTH commander).  Deploying personnel should receive a 
chain of command briefing to ensure a clear understanding of the command structure.  Figure 4.1 
depicts a notional command structure for EMEDS units attached to an air expeditionary wing or 
group for combat support operations. 
Figure 4.1.  Notional Command Structure in Combat Support Operations. 
 
4.1.1.  Air Expeditionary Task Force.  Conventional ground medical units typically deploy as 
expeditionary medical groups or squadrons within an air expeditionary task force attached to 
an air expeditionary wing or group.  The wing or group commander exercises administrative 
control of all attached air expeditionary wing or group assets.  A medical group commander is 
typically a member of the wing or group commander’s staff.  (Source:  AFDP 4-02, Health 
Services.) 
4.1.2.  Air Force Forces Surgeon (AFFOR/SG).  Within an air expeditionary task force, the 
AFFOR/SG is a member of the COMAFFOR’s special staff and is the Director of Medical 
Operations.  The AFFOR/SG is the COMAFFOR’s designed coordinating authority with all 
agencies affecting medical operations.  (Source: AFDP 4-02.) 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
33 
4.1.3.  Expeditionary Medical Group Commander.  The expeditionary medical group 
commander is designated on G-series orders specifically for the deployment and is accountable 
to the air expeditionary wing or group commander.  The expeditionary medical group 
commander is responsible for installation medical services, including oversight and integration 
of non-EMEDS medical assets into a consolidated installation medical support and disaster 
response program.  The expeditionary medical group commander communicates and 
coordinates with the AFFOR/SG on theater medical support issues and with other joint medical 
units at the location. 
4.2.  Joint and Multinational Operations.  EMEDS units deployed to support joint, 
multinational, or United Nations operations operate under the command structure established by 
the air expeditionary task force or joint task force to which they are assigned.  Command and 
control relationships are usually defined in the warning, execution, operations, or task order. 
4.3.  Air Combat Command Surgeon (ACC/SG) Responsibility.  ACC/SG is the Manpower 
and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) Responsible Agency (MRA) for medical ground-
based UTCs.  ACC/SG has overall responsibility for EMEDS tactical doctrine, serves as the 
medical consultant for EMEDS operations, and provides technical guidance and planning.

COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
5.1.  EMEDS Communications Equipment.  EMEDS communications equipment includes 
DOD-approved radios, computer systems, and peripherals.  ACC/SG determines the requirements 
for EMEDS communication and information system assets in partnership with the pilot units, 
ACC/A6 and the Air Force Operational Medicine Information Systems (AFOMIS) Program 
Office.  Responsibilities and processes for acquisition, maintenance, and configuration 
management of deployable medical information management and technology assets are outlined 
in the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP) for USAF Medical 
Equipment War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Information Management/Information Technology 
(IM/IT).  The supported combatant command is responsible for associated upgrades and 
sustainment costs for deployed EMEDS communication and information system equipment and 
for ensuring that maintenance releases are applied. 
5.1.1.  Radios.  EMEDS equipment includes Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) compliant 
wideband and multiband land mobile radios (LMRs).  These radios are interoperable with 
existing DOD radio systems and joint networking waveforms and enable secure voice, data, 
and video communication over mobile, ad-hoc internet protocol based networks.  They support 
line of sight and beyond line of sight communications such as convoy, ambulance to airfield 
operations, patient movement units, security, and local command and control networks.  
Radios are allocated according to the allowance standard and operational specific 
requirements.  These assets primarily support communications during deployment and 
redeployment phases and in austere environments where an established communications 
infrastructure is not available. 
5.1.2.  Computer Systems.  The Air Force Medical Logistics and Industrial Operations 
Division (AFMRA/SG4W), with support from the AFOMIS Program Office and deploying 
units, is responsible for ensuring that EMEDS communication and computer systems 
scheduled for deployment are current and compliant with deployed force information system 
naming conventions, information assurance requirements, and published theater minimum 
hardware standards.  Computers issued to EMEDS teams include the DOD standard desktop 
configuration and TMIP applications. 
5.2.  Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP).  TMIP is a suite of DOD standard medical 
information systems for theater health service support.  It provides applications for medical 
command and control, health care delivery, patient tracking, occupational and environmental 
health exposure tracking and surveillance, medical logistics, and blood management.  TMIP 
applications are provided through the AFOMIS Program Office.  Contact the chief information 
officer, major command, or manpower and equipment force packaging responsible agency for the 
current list of applications included in the TMIP suite. 
5.3.  Network Support.  Network Operations and Security Centers (NOSCs) at the theater level 
ensure the theater’s operational and support systems remain fully capable.  EMEDS facilities rely 
on the communications focal point at the deployed location for core network administration, 
network management, and information assurance at the local level.  See Attachment 5, EMEDS 
HRT NETWORK CONFIGURATION, Attachment 8, EMEDS+10 NETWORK

Chapter 6 
INTEGRATION AND INTEROPERABILITY 
6.1.  Integration and Interoperability with Other Systems.  Deployed medical personnel in a 
theater or area of operation may support elements of an air expeditionary force, components of the 
en route care system, joint medical counterparts, Special Operations Forces (SOF) medical 
components, and other federal and civilian agencies.  In some instances, theater planners might 
request medical support for bed-down locations not associated with a typical air expeditionary 
force or ECS/BOS infrastructure. 
6.2.  Expeditionary 
Combat 
Support/Base 
Operating 
Support 
(ECS/BOS) 
Requirements.  EMEDS assets deploy with limited organic capability and require ECS/BOS.  
ECS/BOS requirements include (but are not limited to) billeting, messing and other consumable 
materials, power, water, ice, latrines, showers, laundry, waste management, exterior lighting, 
transportation (to include ambulances and general purpose vehicles), fuels, vehicle maintenance, 
equipment maintenance, general supplies, contracting, information and communications systems 
support, mortuary affairs, public affairs, chaplain, linguist, personnel and vehicle decontamination, 
and security.  ECS/BOS services for EMEDS facilities and personnel are provided through the 
host base’s capabilities, deployable bare base systems, and contracted civilian support.  ECS/BOS 
requirements for humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and stability operations are tailored to the 
mission.  See Attachment 2, EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS, 
for quantified estimates on required support. 
6.2.1.  Civil Engineering Support.  EMEDS teams require civil engineering assistance for 
shelter and equipment siting, shelter setup, and to connect the EMEDS facility to the base 
infrastructure.  EMEDS personnel and civil engineers install and connect electrical power 
utilities, environment control units, and waste and water management utility systems, as 
appropriate.  EMEDS facilities rely on civil engineering forces for facility maintenance and 
maintenance of non-medical equipment (such as generators and environmental control units).  
Servicing and repair of non-medical equipment beyond the scope of civil engineering 
capabilities might be contracted out.  See Attachment 3, EMEDS HRT LAYOUT, 
Attachment 6, EMEDS+10 LAYOUT, Attachment 9, EMEDS+25 LAYOUT, for 
recommended EMEDS site layout configurations. 
6.2.2.  Billeting, Food, and Personal Hygiene Provisions.  Provisions for billeting, meals, 
showers, and latrines for EMEDS personnel should be commensurate with that provided for 
other deployed personnel at the bed-down location. 
6.2.3.  Communications and Information Systems Support.  EMEDS does not deploy with the 
communication infrastructure needed for independent operation.  EMEDS facilities rely on the 
host base’s communication units for support.  EMEDS personnel require access to the Defense 
Switched Network (DSN), secure voice communication, Non-classified Internet Protocol 
Router Network (NIPRNET), and SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) for 
data collection, reporting, and reachback purposes.  EMEDS equipment packages include 
computers, peripheral devices, a satellite phone, and radios.  It does not include phone 
equipment. 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
37 
6.2.4.  Equipment Movement.  EMEDS personnel require assistance from base personnel for 
moving and positioning EMEDS equipment at the deployed location. 
6.2.5.  Ice and Water.  Potable water (bottled/bulk), ice, and dry ice are normally obtained on 
a contract basis.  Depending on the operation, a reverse osmosis water purification unit may 
be deployed.  EMEDS public health and bioenvironmental engineering personnel provide 
consultation on the procurement or in-house treatment of potable water and ice. 
6.2.6.  Fire and Emergency Services.  Fire and emergency services for EMEDS personnel and 
facilities should be commensurate with that provided for other deployed personnel and 
resources. 
6.2.7.  Laundry.  Laundry support is normally obtained on a contract basis but may be provided 
by ECS/BOS services. 
6.2.8.  Oxygen.  EMEDS HRT includes mobile oxygen storage tanks, which provide a finite 
oxygen capability.  Medically approved oxygen and other gases may be obtained on a contract 
basis when necessary.  EMEDS+10 includes a deployable oxygen generation system.  A 
second oxygen generation system is added at the EMEDS+25 level.  The 87-bed AFTH 
includes four oxygen generation systems. 
6.2.9.  Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL).  Fuel for vehicles, generators, and other 
equipment is normally obtained on a contract basis along with other base requirements. 
6.2.10.  Power.  Base electrical power systems provide primary power generation.  EMEDS 
commanders, in consultation with EMEDS biomedical equipment technicians or civil 
engineering, ensure that power is rationed appropriately.  EMEDS+10 and above include 
generators, which are intended for initial operating capability and emergency backup power 
only.  ECS/BOS provides ground power equipment specialists to connect EMEDS power 
distribution panels to commercial or base power.  See Attachment 4, EMEDS HRT POWER 
GRID, Attachment 7, EMEDS+10 POWER GRID, and Attachment 10, EMEDS+25 
POWER GRID, for recommended power grid configurations. 
6.2.11.  Transportation Support.  EMEDS relies on ECS/BOS for access to vehicles for patient 
movement, personnel movement, equipment movement, and vehicle maintenance.  These 
vehicles are base transportation assets and might not be permanently assigned to the EMEDS 
facility.  Note:  Ambulances typically are not deployed at the EMEDS HRT level. 
6.2.12.  Waste Disposal.  Medical and other waste disposal services will normally be obtained 
on a contract basis or will be provided as part of other base waste disposal services.

AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
Chapter 7 
SECURITY AND FORCE PROTECTION 
7.1.  Security Roles and Responsibilities.  Medical personnel and equipment are non-combatant 
assets and have protected status under the Geneva Conventions and the broader Law of War.  
Arming requirements for deploying EMEDS personnel are mission and operating location specific 
and are provided in reporting instructions and theater guidance.  Current threat assessments 
provided by the combatant commander and local threat conditions established by the joint task 
force, air expeditionary wing, or air expeditionary group commander dictate local security 
measures.  EMEDS commanders are responsible for ensuring security measures are in place to 
protect patients and personnel at the EMEDS facility.  EMEDS personnel are responsible for 
following the personal protection measures outlined in DAFI 31-101, area of responsibility 
security briefings, established force protection requirements, and local guidance.  The EMEDS 
commander or appointed representative should be a member of the Integrated Defense Council. 
7.2.  Physical Security.  Security forces guard medical facilities only if deemed necessary as part 
of the Integrated Defense Plan.  If the threat changes, security forces may appoint an augmented 
detail to provide force protection and entry control (for example, a mass casualty event).  The 
supported unit provides security for any patient determined to require a security detail or escort.  
EMEDS facilities are not manned to provide this layer of security. 
7.3.  Medical Convoy Protection.  EMEDS commanders should coordinate with the defense 
force commander for tactical security element support for medical convoys outside the base 
perimeter and to local host nation medical facilities. 
7.4.  Operations Security.  EMEDS personnel are responsible for protecting mission-critical 
information (to include medical or casualty information) in accordance with theater policy and 
AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC).  Classified information should be transmitted by 
secure means and protected in accordance with Department of Defense Manual (DODM) 5200.01, 
Volume 3_DAFMAN 16-1404, Volume 3, Information Security Program:  Protection of 
Classified Information.  Situation reports, medical surveillance, site locations, and compiled 
patient data are examples of information that may be classified and require protection. 
7.5.  Security of Weapons and Ammunition.  Weapons and ammunition should be secured in 
accordance with DAFI 31-101 and local procedures.  Normally, base security forces provide 
weapons handling guidance and an armory.  In austere locations where access to an armory might 
not be available, EMEDS personnel are responsible for the safe storage of weapons and 
ammunition until the patient’s unit or armory can assume responsibility.  EMEDS commanders 
should coordinate with base security forces or the supported unit on local weapons handling 
guidance.  Considerations include rules of engagement on searching and clearing patients of 
weapons and explosives, who is allowed to carry weapons into the medical treatment facility, 
weapons clearing procedures for personnel entering the facility, and safety measures for handling 
the discovery of unauthorized weapons or explosives.

the ACC/SG MEFPAK Playbook (https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/12173/SitePages/ACC-SG-
Ground-Medical-UTC-Management.aspx) or from the ACC Exercise and Training Branch. 
8.5.  Joint Senior Medical Leaders Course (JSMLC).  The JSMLC prepares senior medical 
leaders to serve as joint task surgeons and senior staff members.  Completion of this course or an 
equivalent is highly recommended for EMEDS commanders and deputy commanders.  This course 
is offered through the Defense Medical Readiness Training Institute (DMRTI) at Ft. Sam Houston 
in San Antonio, TX. 
8.6.  Vehicle Operation Training.  Operators of material handling equipment, ambulances, and 
other government motor vehicles must have a government driver’s license and appropriate 
certification in accordance with AFI 24-301, Ground Transportation.  Certain vehicles (such as 
ambulances and materiel handling equipment) require completion of additional training, 
certification, and licensing.  This training is a unit responsibility and should occur before 
deployment.  Ground Transportation can assist units with reviewing training requirements and 
training options.  Operators should document completion of required additional training and 
certification on AF Form 171, Request for Driver Training and Addition to U.S. Government 
Driver’s License.  
8.6.1.  Medical materiel personnel (4A1XX) assigned to an EMEDS UTC should be fully 
trained on powered industrial trucks and all-terrain capacity materiel handling equipment in 
accordance with CMRP Category II, Readiness Skills Training for AFSC 4A1X1 – Medical 
Materiel.

AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
8.6.2.  Aerospace medical service technicians (4N0XX) assigned to FFEP3 and all members 
of FFGLE should be trained in ambulance operation in accordance with their UTC mission 
capability statements. 
8.7.  Weapons Training.  EMEDS personnel follow the weapons qualification training 
requirements outlined in AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms Program, and DAFMAN 36-2655, USAF 
Small Arms and Light Weapons Qualification Programs, for Arming Group C.  Theater combatant 
commands may impose additional or more stringent requirements, which are generally specified 
in the operation’s execution order or reporting instructions.  See the AFMS Arming Requirements 
document (also known as the Weapons and Munitions Forecasting Table) for weapons 
authorizations for EMEDS UTCs.  This document is available on the ACC/SG MEFPAK Playbook 
(https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/12173/SitePages/Playbooks.aspx) or by request from the ACC 
Ground Medical UTC Management Branch. 
8.8.  Communications and Information Systems Training.  EMEDS personnel should be 
trained in the proper use of the communications and information systems included in their 
equipment packages.  See the CMRP Category III Training Guide for more information on the 
training platform, attendance, and currency requirements. 
8.9.  CBRN Response Force Training.  EMEDS personnel allocated to the CBRN Response 
Enterprise participate in Defense CBRN Response Force (DCRF) and C2 CBRN Response 
Element (C2CRE) training, exercises, and evaluations in accordance with the Joint Mission 
Essential Task List.  Joint training plans, schedules, and training records are maintained in the

Chapter 9 
LOGISTICS 
9.1.  Expeditionary Medical Logistics (EML) System.  The EML system provides global 
support and sustainment to air expeditionary force medical forces across the full spectrum of 
operations.  The EML system uses a pull process for resupply and a repair-and-return process for 
medical equipment maintenance to minimize inventory and airlift requirements.  Each combatant 
command has a supporting Theater Lead Agent for Medical Materiel (TLAMM).  The TLAMM 
serves as a major theater medical distribution node and becomes the deployed unit’s primary point 
of contact for materiel and equipment support in theater.  For early phase operations and 
emergency situations in which a TLAMM is not able to provide support, the AFFOR/SG staff in 
coordination with the AFMLOC may designate a sustaining base to provide reachback support.  
Upon notification of activation, the logistics lead should contact the AFMLOC for guidance on 
the appropriate theater supply chain and points of contact.  See DAFTTP 3-42.8 for more 
information on expeditionary medical logistics support capabilities, infrastructure, and supply 
chain management. 
9.2.  Supplies and Equipment.  Most expeditionary medical equipment based in the continental 
United States is managed and deployed through designated storage and deployment centers.  
Equipment UTCs may also be pre-positioned in theater based on requirements from geographic 
combatant commanders and the COMAFFOR.  EMEDS typically deploys with 30 days of supplies 
(an initial 10-day supply package and two 10-day resupply packages).  UTC team chiefs should 
be aware of the contents of their equipment packages before deployment and should contact their 
medical logistics office for assistance with reviewing their allowance standards.  At the deployed 
location, UTC team chiefs coordinate subsequent resupply through their medical logistics function.  
See Chapter 2, EXPEDITIONARY GROUND MEDICAL SUPPORT CAPABILITIES, for 
more information on the equipment UTCs included in each EMEDS module and the corresponding 
allowance standard. 
9.3.  Medical Equipment Maintenance and Repair.  EMEDS biomedical equipment technicians 
provide routine maintenance and repair of medical equipment at the deployed location.  Equipment 
repairs and calibrations that cannot be done on site may be provided by an Air Force Medical 
Equipment Repair Center (MERC). 
9.4.  Equipment Upgrades and Modernization.  Changes to the EMEDS assemblage may result 
from technology advances and lessons learned feedback.  MRAs typically budget and plan for 
major equipment reviews every five years.

national disaster or emergency when directed by higher headquarters.  The primary mission is to 
provide health services support for the response force, assist the medical relief efforts of 
overburdened domestic civilian agencies, and provide vital medical services.  EMEDS personnel 
supporting these missions continue to operate under a military chain of command regardless of the 
lead agency.  Command and control typically reside under a joint force command structure where 
the EMEDS commander reports through a line chain of command or through the joint force 
surgeon.  Specific command and control relationships are usually defined in the warning, 
execution, operations, or task order. 
10.2.  Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) Response Packages.  Some EMEDS UTCs 
are allocated to the combatant commands to support DSCA operations under the National 
Response Framework and National Incident Management System.  The combatant commanders 
determine which EMEDS personnel and equipment UTCs support the domestic civil support 
mission within their areas of responsibility based on mission scope, threat assessment, and 
availability of forces.  Specific UTCs are identified in the TPFDD.  Historically, Air Force ground 
medical support for domestic civil support missions has been built on an augmented EMEDS+25 
platform.  ECS/BOS requirements will vary depending on the assemblage.  See Attachment 2, 
EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS, for baseline ECS/BOS 
requirements. 
10.3.  CBRN Response Force.  The DOD maintains a dedicated, scalable, and readily available 
CBRN response force (known as the CBRN Response Enterprise) to provide a rapid and flexible 
response in the event of a domestic CBRN incident.  When directed by higher headquarters, the 
CBRN Response Enterprise deploys to support the consequence management efforts of civilian 
authorities overwhelmed by a significant or catastrophic radiological or nuclear incident to the 
extent allowed by law to save lives, reduce suffering, and protect the environment.  The CBRN 
Response Enterprise consists of state and federal military response forces.  Federal military 
response forces consist of the Defense CBRN Response Force (DCRF) and Command and Control 
CBRN Response Elements (C2CRE A and B).  Air Force UTCs allocated to this mission are part 
of the DCRF and include EMEDS, AFRAT, and the Theater Epidemiology Team.  Additional 
medical support for the C2CREs is handled through a request for forces process.

FOREIGN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND STABILITY OPERATIONS 
11.1.  Mission.  Upon direction by higher headquarters, EMEDS and associated ECS/BOS 
components deploy to support foreign humanitarian assistance (which includes disaster relief) and 
stability operations.  The primary mission is to provide rapid, initial medical response, provide 
health services support for the response force, and help restore vital medical services.  The 
military’s role in these operations is intended to be limited in scope and duration.  EMEDS 
augments the medical relief efforts of partner nations, intergovernmental agencies, and civilian 
relief agencies.  The typical mission duration for EMEDS personnel is less than 30 days.  Figure 
11.1 shows a notional EMEDS response timeline. 
Figure 11.1.  Notional EMEDS Response. 
 
11.2.  Support Capabilities.  Medical support capabilities focus on estimated throughput and are 
not linked to a population at risk.  EMEDS HRT provides the initial response capabilities and 
generally includes medical C2 and support services, surgical and critical care, primary care, dental, 
bioenvironmental engineering, public health, OB/GYN, pediatrics, and internal medicine.  
EMEDS HRT can triage and treat 350 patients per day with a surge capacity of 500.  The 
preexisting health status of the affected population and the scope and severity of the event will 
impact patient throughput and supply duration.  Due to anticipated high patient volumes, the 
estimate for initial supply duration is 5 days.  If the anticipated patient throughput exceeds EMEDS 
HRT capabilities, an EMEDS+10 or EMEDS+25 may be deployed.  Additional specialty UTCs, 
such as pediatrics (FFPED/FFPE1) and OB/GYN (FFGYN/FFGY1) can also be added. 
11.3.  Operational Assumptions.  EMEDS response is based on the following assumptions about 
the operational environment: 
• 
Civilian authorities are in control of their government and the operational environment. 
• 
U.S. forces are not responsible for host nation patient movement, including rotary wing 
or ground evacuation. 
• 
EMEDS will likely deploy to austere conditions with limited logistical support.  
• 
U.S. forces will be self-billeted. 
44 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
• 
Food, potable water, electrical power, transportation, and fuel may not be locally 
available.  U.S. forces bring their own capability. 
• 
The host nation has airfield control, and a runway is available to U.S. forces. 
• 
Local communication systems are not available within the area of operations.  The 
operating site will require communications setup and maintenance support. 
• 
A Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) or appropriate diplomatic notes exist. 
• 
Humanitarian Assistance Survey Teams (HAST), Global Health Engagement, and 
Defense Institute for Medical Operations (DIMO) resources may be employed.  
11.4.  Medical Planning Factors.  The supported population may include U.S. and partner nation 
forces, personnel from governmental agencies and non-government organizations, and local 
nationals.  Medical rules of engagement should define the scope and level of care, types of patients 
who will be treated, plans for moving stabilized patients to the next level of care, patient referral 
policies, and other medical considerations.  JP 3-29, Foreign Humanitarian Assistance, and JP 4-
02 provide joint planning guidance. 
11.4.1.  Participants may include U.S. and coalition military forces; U.S., state, or host nation 
government agencies; multinational partners; and private sector relief organizations.  EMEDS 
personnel should understand the key organizations involved and their interrelationships, roles, 
and responsibilities, as well as formal coordination requirements, rules of engagement, and 
reporting instructions. 
11.4.2.  Medical providers may encounter cultural and language barriers in providing medical 
triage and care.  EMEDS commanders should explore basic language and cultural orientation 
for the medical staff before deployment.  EMEDS personnel might have limited access to 
effective interpreters. 
11.4.3.  EMEDS commanders should be provided with public affairs guidance on theater and 
combatant command strategic themes and messages before departure from home station, if 
possible.  All assigned personnel should follow active public affairs guidance.  Communication 
on EMEDS capabilities should be realistic and specific.  For example, the AFMS is not 
organized, trained, equipped, or mobilized to treat medical conditions that require extended 
hospitalization or prolonged nursing care. 
11.4.4.  Patient care documentation requirements for non-U.S. personnel (for example, non-
government organization personnel, partner nation forces) treated at an EMEDS facility is 
determined by State Department guidance, standardized treaties, and partner nation 
agreements.  Patient care documentation and records disposition requirements for local 
nationals should be negotiated with the host nation.  This documentation is typically paper 
based so it can be shared with the host nation. 
11.4.5.  The EMEDS allowance standard is designed for the medical care needs of a 
predominately healthy active duty population and may not be appropriate for the host nation 
patient population.  Providers should ensure that treatment options can be sustained locally.  In 
emergent situations where there is no time to identify the regional availability of standard 
medications and supplies, medical personnel and planners can reference the World Health 
Organization’s recommended Essential Medicines List and Interagency Emergency Health Kit 
for guidance. 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
45 
11.4.6.  ECS/BOS requirements depend on operational conditions and mission directives.  ECS/BOS 
requirements typically include airfield operations, security forces, civil engineering, power production, 
transportation, and logistics support.  The U.S. military is responsible for EMEDS site security and the 
protection of EMEDS personnel and equipment on and off site.  A host nation may provide security 
augmentation or impose limitations on security operations outside the EMEDS area, as determined by 
agreements between the host nation and U.S. forces.  Additional ECS/BOS requirements may include 
political advisory, judge advocate, civil affairs, linguist, and chaplain support. 
11.5.  Command Relationships.  The State Department or the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance (OFDA) 
within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the U.S. government lead in foreign 
response.  DOD military personnel operate under a military chain of command regardless of the lead 
agency.  Command and control typically reside under a joint force command structure where the EMEDS 
commander reports through a line chain of command or through the joint force surgeon.  Specific command 
and control relationships are usually defined in the warning, execution, or operation order. 
11.6.  Standard of Care.  EMEDS providers should apply U.S. medical standards when treating American 
forces.  The medical rules of engagement define the scope of care and triage guidelines for host nation 
patients based on the situation, other available health support capabilities, patient movement capabilities, 
and the host nation’s request for support.  Medical interventions typically are limited to procedures and 
therapies that are low risk, can be performed quickly, require limited follow-up, and do not undermine the 
host nation medical system. 
11.7.  Patient Movement.  EMEDS may be employed with an En Route Patient Staging System (ERPSS) 
facility that can facilitate the intra-country movement of host nation patients.  Due to Secretarial Designee 
status requirements, OCONUS host nation patients are not typically entered into the aeromedical evacuation 
system for movement outside their nation. 
11.8.  Interoperability with Host Nation and Partner Providers.  Healthcare professionals and 
volunteers from the host nation or other partner may assist EMEDS personnel in providing health support 
if they meet mutually agreed upon requirements for proof of credentials. 
11.9.  Blood Supply.  Blood products are generally used for the direct support of military forces supporting 
the mission.  EMEDS facilities should use DOD sourced or DOD collected blood products.  If supply or 
resupply is not available from DOD sources, consult the Area Joint Blood Program Office for direction.  
Blood policies for host nation patients are in accordance with the established medical rules of engagement. 
11.10.  Property Donation.  Serviceable medical equipment and supplies (Class VIII A medical materiel) 
may be made available to the host nation or non-government organizations in accordance with combatant 
command policy and direction.  Property donations typically require coordination with logistics personnel, 
public affairs, legal, and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Requests for property should be forwarded 
to the DOD for approval and funding authorization.  Transfer and distribution of the property is the 
responsibility of the State Department in accordance with Title 10 United States Code (USC), Section 2557.  
Donated equipment or materiel should be appropriate and interoperable with host nation standards, 
maintainable by host nation capabilities and resources, and have a measurable positive impact on host 
nation health capacity.

EMEDS COMMANDER PRE-DEPLOYMENT AND POST ARRIVAL CHECKLIST 
Table A15.1.  Pre-Deployment and Initial Operations Key Tasks. 
Done 
Task 
Recommendations 
 
Pre-Deployment Activities 
 
Establish lines of communication with 
EMEDS team members. 
Deploying members might not be 
stationed together.  Establish a means to 
share information and build rapport. 
 
To the extent possible, meet with team 
members in person or virtually using 
secure communication methods as 
necessary. 
 
Document events, key resources, contact 
information, recall rosters, and other 
reference materials for continuity records. 
 
Establish command structure. 
Identify key leaders and establish a 
command structure.  Ensure team 
members are aware of the chain of 
command and organizational structure. 
 
Review pre-deployment documentation. 
Review pre-deployment documents, such 
as the warning order, operation order, 
deployment order, reporting instructions, 
and intelligence briefings.  Review 
personnel rosters and cargo lists. 
 
Conduct personnel assessment. 
Work closely with the medical readiness 
office and Personnel Support for 
Contingency Operations to verify that all 
assigned personnel are eligible for 
deployment and meet mission training, 
pre-deployment health screening, and 
immunization requirements. 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
71 
Done 
Task 
Recommendations 
 
Gather information on destination. 
Contact the AFFOR/SG office for current 
medical and environmental intelligence 
about the deployed location. 
 
Contact communications, intelligence, 
logistics, and security force units for 
information about the services and 
capabilities available.  If available, obtain 
base support plans and area maps. 
 
Consult with public health staff for 
information on local health threats. 
 
Consult with global health engagement 
staff for information about the regional 
health structure, cultural considerations, 
language cards with common medical 
phrases and international symbols, and 
points of contact for the U.S. embassy, 
host nation military, and non-
governmental agencies. 
 
Review deployment schedules. 
The Deployment Control Center 
publishes a deployment schedule of 
events to prepare units, personnel, and 
cargo to meet required delivery dates in 
theater. 
 
Contact the medical readiness office for 
information on personnel chalks, troop 
commanders, and transportation 
schedules. 
 
Coordinate ECS/BOS. 
Ensure that ECS/BOS needs are 
coordinated with the appropriate agencies 
before deployment.  To the extent 
possible, coordinate with supplying units 
in advance to exchange contact 
information, communicate arrival times, 
and negotiate support. 
 
Initial Arrival and Early-Phase Activities 
72 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
Done 
Task 
Recommendations 
 
Assess existing medical capabilities at the 
operating location. 
Determine what level of health care and 
health care facilities already exist at the 
location.   
 
Determine which EMEDS components, 
other ground medical UTCs, and 
aeromedical evacuation resources are in 
place and the timeline for arrival of 
additional support.   
 
Determine what medical resources are 
available from other services and 
coalition forces. 
 
Recommend site location. 
If necessary, find a location to house 
immediate clinical care (tent, building of 
opportunity) until the EMEDS 
infrastructure is in place.   
 
Recommend a proposed site for the 
EMEDS facility to the expeditionary 
wing or group commander based on input 
from civil engineers and 
bioenvironmental engineering.  Consider 
security (central location), flight-line 
access, accessibility to the patient 
population, proximity to environmental 
hazards (flight-line noise, sewage plant, 
power, and communication lines), 
orientation to wind and weather patterns, 
and terrain.   
 
Identify areas for mass casualty triage, 
patient decontamination, and contagious 
casualty management. 
 
Be prepared to relocate as the base 
expands or operational conditions 
warrant.  Consider alternate sites and 
have a relocation plan in place. 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
73 
Done 
Task 
Recommendations 
 
Secure essential services.  
Work with ECS/BOS resources to obtain 
food, water, shelter, and transportation for 
the medical staff.  Secure power for the 
medical facility. 
 
If necessary, secure temporary 
refrigeration for medications, 
immunizations, and other medical 
supplies that require temperature control 
until the medical facility is set up. 
 
Establish medical command and control. 
Identify and establish contact with the 
local and theater chain of command.   
 
Brief the expeditionary wing/group 
commander on medical assets and 
capabilities and understand the 
commander’s expectations for health 
service support.   
 
Garner support for force health protection 
measures to maintain the health of 
deployed forces. 
 
Determine force protection condition and 
security threat. 
Consult with intelligence, security forces, 
and civil engineering to assess the 
security threat and obtain information on 
the current force protection condition, 
alarm signals and responses, shelter 
locations and procedures, and personal 
protective equipment requirements (mask, 
chemical gear, etc.). 
 
Account for equipment and supplies. 
Ensure that supplies and equipment 
required to establish medical capability 
have arrived.  Pallets might be repacked 
during transit to maximize space, so 
packing lists on the outside of pallets 
might not reflect the actual contents. 
 
Medical logistics personnel are 
responsible for storing and safeguarding 
equipment and supplies. 
74 
AFTTP3-42.71  17 SEPTEMBER 2024 
Done 
Task 
Recommendations 
 
Establish communications capability. 
Identify voice and data connectivity 
requirements and relay needs to base 
communications.   
 
Request support to establish Secret 
Internet Protocol Router Network 
(SIPRNET) and Non-classified Internet 
Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) 
access. 
 
Report arrival. 
Contact the AFFOR/SG to report your 
arrival, current medical capability, 
limiting factors, and shortfalls.  This 
should be accomplished automatically 
with the first situation report. 
 
Establish contact with squadron medical 
elements. 
Squadron medical elements belong to 
operational squadrons but can integrate 
into medical operations as appropriate for 
mission and manning considerations. 
 
Meet with the local flying unit 
commanders to determine their medical 
support needs and a command and control 
mechanism for coordinating medical 
services between the squadron medical 
element and the deployed medical unit.
