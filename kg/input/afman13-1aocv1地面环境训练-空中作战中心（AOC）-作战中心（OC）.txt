This Air Force Manual (AFMAN) implements Department of the Air Force Policy Directive 
(DAFPD) 13-1, Command and Control (C2) Enterprise. This publication provides guidance to Air 
Force (AF) Air Operations Centers (AOCs) that support Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), 
including Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) AOC 
augmentation units.  It also establishes required training for specialty teams, liaison personnel, and 
augmentees.  This publication applies to all civilians employees and uniformed members of the 
regular AF, the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard who are filling AOC positions, as 
mutually agreed upon by the local Commander, Air Force Forces (AFFOR) and those contractors 
who are filling such positions who are contractually obliged to comply with Department of the Air 
Force publications. This publication does not apply to Space Force. Ensure all records generated 
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication adhere to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-322, 
Records Management and Information Governance Program, and are disposed in accordance with 
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, which is located in the Air Force Records Information 
Management System.  Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the 
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Department of the Air Force (DAF) Form 847, 
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route DAF Forms 847 from the field through the 
appropriate functional chain of command.  Parent major commands (MAJCOMs), Component 
Numbered Air Force (C-NAF), geographic AOCs, functional AOCs and Air Reserve Components 
(ARC) aligned units may supplement this AFMAN.  Parent MAJCOMs of global/functional AOCs

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This document is substantially revised and must be thoroughly reviewed.  It corrects office 
symbols for various organizations including OPR and implements waiver authority (tiering) 
guidance in DAFMAN 90-161.  The document has evolved from an AFI to an AFMAN.  It 
describes the Initial Qualification Training (IQT) scheduling process, requirements for Mission 
Qualification Training (MQT), Continuation Training (CT) and Theater Orientation Training.  It 
provided guidance on the roles and responsibilities of the Chief of Training and establishes a list 
of mandatory reporting items.  Finally, the Course Attendance Matrix identifies courses available 
based on AOC position and assigned responsibilities.

Chapter 1 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1.  General.  This publication provides guidance for training programs developed and 
maintained by geographic and global/functional AOC units, and AOC-aligned ARC supporting 
units. 
1.1.1.  Throughout this manual, unless otherwise specified, the term “AOC” will refer to 
geographic and global/functional AOCs, OCs, and Support Units. 
1.1.2.  The parent MAJCOM of ARC units will be that of their aligned AOC unless otherwise 
specified. 
1.1.3.  AOC Air Communications Squadrons (ACOMS) are not required to comply with this 
publication. However, ACOMS personnel supporting AOC networks administration and 
system administration will attend the AOC Formal Training Unit (FTU) for AOC IQT 
Networks or System Administration course, as appropriate.  All other ACOMS personnel (e.g., 
unit commanders, flight commanders, plans and programs, Communications Focal Point, etc.) 
will attend the IQT Communications course.  (T-2) 
1.1.4.  Due to individual AOC’s unique organizational structure and differing processes, unit-
specific supplements to this AFMAN should address unique training program requirements.  
AFRC units will coordinate any unit-specific supplements with respective AFRC Director of 
Operations, Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration (AFRC/A3-10) Functional Area 
Managers (FAMs) for approval. (T-2) 
1.1.5.  Due to AOC manning constraints and unique theater or global/functional requirements, 
AOC units may require locally developed positions not discussed in AFMAN 13-1 AOC 
Volume 3, Operational Procedures-Air Operations Center (AOC)/Operations Center (OC). 
Units will identify unique positions and training associated with these positions in a 
supplement to this publication.  (T-2) 
1.1.6.  This AFMAN applies to personnel assigned to crewmember positions as discussed in 
AFMAN 13-1 AOCV3 and establishes requirements for theater orientation training for liaison 
officers and augmentees. 
1.1.6.1.  AOC specialty teams may be military, civilian, or contractor personnel (if part of 
the contract performance work statement and approved by the AOC commander 
(AOC/CC)) and fill operational, mission-essential positions in the AOC. 
1.1.6.2.  Liaison officers and AOC augmentation personnel may represent other weapons 
systems (WSs), components, commands, government agencies, or coalition partners.  They 
are administratively subordinate to their parent organizations while working within the 
AOC and will receive theater orientation and limited positional training from the 
component AOC or designated training organization. (T-2)  Paragraph 4.1 outlines the 
theater orientation training specifics. Note: AOC training outlined in this AFMAN is 
separate from AF On-the-Job Training.  On-the-Job Training is governed by DAFMAN 
36-2689, Training Program and documented in DAF Form 623, Individual Training 
Record Folder or another AF approved system (for enlisted members only).  Although 
6 
AFMAN13-1AOCV1  15 MAY 2024 
there is a potential overlap of training requirements and events, AOC training and career 
field training documentation are separate programs. 
1.1.7.  AOC personnel will attain Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status once IQT and Mission 
Qualification Training (MQT) are accomplished and designated by the AOC/CC. (T-2) (Note: 
CMR is defined as a status indicating an AOC crewmember has successfully completed IQT 
and MQT and been approved by their AOC/CC.) 
1.1.8.  AOC personnel will accomplish Continuation Training (CT) as a requirement for 
maintenance of CMR status. (T-2) 
1.1.9.  All training will be documented as described in Chapter 7.  (T-2) 
1.1.10.  Any reference to FTU, unless stated otherwise, refers to the AOC FTU at Hurlburt 
Field, FL, operated by the 505th Command and Control Wing (505 CCW) and 505th Training 
Squadron (505 TRS).

Chapter 2 
INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT) 
2.1.  Introduction.  IQT provides foundational knowledge, skills, and context for follow-on 
training of AOC processes and is required for all AOC crewmembers and members of 
combined/merged Air Component staffs. IQT does not provide in depth positional and theater 
specific training.  The primary method of IQT is to attend and complete the appropriate formal 
training course at the AOC FTU.  The crewmember duty position determines which AOC FTU 
course is attended.  (T-2)  See Attachment 6, AOC Course Attendance Matrix. 
2.1.1.  IQT (FTU or IU-IQT) must begin within 60 days of arriving on station (180 days for 
ARC personnel).  (T-2) All personnel are required to meet IQT syllabus standards. 
2.1.2.  Upon completing IQT, AOC personnel attain basic qualified status and receive the 
appropriate AOC SEI.  Basic qualification (BQ) crewmembers will not be allowed to perform 
designated operational capability (DOC) statement missions unsupervised.  (T-3) 
2.2.  Authority. 
2.2.1.  ACC-approved syllabi contain IQT requirements for each duty position.  Course syllabi 
do not take precedence over the guidance in this manual, unless otherwise stated. 
2.2.1.1.  IQT and IU-IQT will adhere to the grading criteria, academic/performance 
training standards, and instructions within the ACC/A3 approved syllabus.  (T-2) 
2.2.1.2.  IQT syllabi and course training documents are jointly developed by ACC, ACC 
TRSS, and the FTU (505 TRS). 
2.2.2.  FTU in-residence courses do not accommodate all AOC duty positions (list located on 
AOC InteLink site - See Attachment 2).  For those positions that are standard but not taught 
at the FTU, units will develop IU-IQT with guidance and support from the parent MAJCOM 
(See Attachment 4, In-Unit Training Plan Template). (T-2)  For those non-AFMAN 13-1 
AOCV3 positions unique to their AOC, IQT development is a unit responsibility.  Units will 
submit for the AOC SEI upon completion of IU-IQT, six months CMR in the duty position 
(two years for ARC), and unit commander recommendation.  (T-2) 
2.2.3.  AOC/CCs will develop and maintain an IU-IQT training plan.  (T-2) 
2.2.3.1.  IU-IQT training plans will contain IQT materials developed and provided by the 
505 TRS and 39 IOS in addition to locally developed unit specific training. (T-2) 
2.2.3.2.  IU-IQT training plans will be reviewed annually and submitted to parent 
MAJCOM/A3 OPR for final approval. (T-2) 
2.2.3.3.  MAJCOM approved IU-IQT training plans will be forwarded to ACC/A3CO. 
(T-2) 
2.2.4.  AOC/CCs will request IU-IQT waiver for individuals unable to attend FTU to 
MAJCOM. (T-2)  The respective MAJCOM OPR is the final authority to approve and 
disapprove IU-IQT waiver requests. 
AFMAN13-1AOCV1  15 MAY 2024 
15 
2.2.4.1.  Reasons for IU-IQT should be significant and include, but not be limited to, severe 
mission impact due to an Airman’s absence for IQT or an expected delay in IQT 
availability. 
2.2.4.2.  505 TRS will provide FTU training materials to support IU-IQT to include course 
materials and lesson plans, as appropriate or allow access to materials via on-line means. 
(T-2) 
2.2.4.3.  IU-IQT requests will be forwarded to respective MAJCOM OPR for review and 
final FTU waiver approval. (T-2) 
2.2.4.4.  MAJCOM approved IU-IQT requests will be forwarded to ACC/A3CO and 505 
TRS Quota Manager for awareness. (T-2) 
2.2.5.  Requesting and scheduling IQT with the 505 TRS is the responsibility of gaining 
AOCT.  Training enroute to the permanent change of station (PCS) location will be utilized to 
the maximum extent possible.  Gaining units will coordinate with 505 TRS/705 TRS Quota 
Management personnel to schedule all FTU courses.  (T-2) Use the AOC FTU attendance 
matrix when determining which course to request (Attachment 6).  Note: Funding for families 
is not provided/authorized. 
2.2.6.  Timeline:  Maximum training time for IU-IQT is 120 days (18 months for ARC 
personnel) from start to finish.  IU-IQT must be started no-later-than 60 days (180 days for 
ARC personnel) following date arrived station (DAS). (T-2) 
2.2.7.  Exemptions to the IQT timeline may occur via extension IAW paragraph 2.2.8. 
2.2.7.1.  Individuals returning to an AOC assignment who have previously accomplished 
IQT need not re-accomplish IQT, do not require a waiver, and their original completion 
date remains in effect.  AOC training managers will conduct a records review of the 
individuals record and assign any necessary refresher training. (T-2) 
2.2.7.2.  Individuals assigned to a new AOC position may require a different IQT or FTU 
class and may re-accomplish IQT for the new position.  Attendance in a new FTU class 
will require AOCT request, MAJCOM POC, and ACC/A3CO approval.  If FTU attendance 
is not mandated, CMR status will be achieved through the successful completion of IU-
IQT, MQT and designation from the AOC/CC. (T-2) 
2.2.8.  Extension:  AOC/CCs may grant two sequential 30-day extensions (total of an 
additional 60 days) for completing IU-IQT.  ARC AOC/CCs may grant two sequential 120-
day extensions for a (240 days total) for completion of IU-IQT.  Include any training extensions 
in the quarterly report as outlined in paragraph 7.9.2.  Following the AOC/CC or ARC 
commander extensions, the commander, upon review of the individual’s training to date, may 
request an additional extension from MAJCOM OPR of 30 days or 120 days for ARC 
personnel as appropriate.  (T-2) 
2.2.9.  Incomplete:  Students unable to finish an FTU course for other than performance issues 
(e.g., medical reasons) may enter a subsequent class with 505 TRS Commander (505 TRS/CC) 
recommendation, unit commander approval, and gaining MAJCOM and ACC/A3CO review. 
2.2.10.  FTU IQT Failure:  FTU IQT failure is a mandatory reporting item by the 505 TRS to 
the gaining unit, the MAJCOM OPR, ACC/A3CO and ACC, Command and Control Mission 
Systems Branch (ACC/A6OC) for all communication/cyber course failures.  (T-2) 
16 
AFMAN13-1AOCV1  15 MAY 2024 
2.2.10.1.  Failing students may return to IQT with 505 TRS/CC recommendation, gaining 
unit commander and MAJCOM OPR approval, and ACC/A3CO review.  (T-2) 
2.2.10.2.  Students who fail FTU may not be enrolled in IU-IQT. (T-2) 
2.2.11.  IU-IQT Failure:  IU-IQT failure is a mandatory reporting items to the MAJCOM OPR.  
If after the AOC/CC and/or MAJCOM OPR extensions, training is still not complete, the 
commander may opt to reenter the individual into training (restart the clock).  (T-2) 
2.2.12.  Commanders may end the training of failing students and place individual in a position 
designated by MAJCOM AFSC OPR.  Unit commanders may place an individual in a non-
AOC position until coordination with MAJCOM AFSC OPR is completed.  (T-2) 
2.2.13.  AFRC unit commanders will remove members unable to start or complete training 
from primary AOC crewmember position. (T-2)

Chapter 3 
MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT) 
3.1.  Introduction.  Mission Qualification Training (MQT).  MQT provides positional and 
theater specific training necessary to qualify or requalify AOC crewmembers in a duty position to 
perform the missions assigned to a specific AOC.  MQT is a unit responsibility.  AOC personnel 
maintain BQ status until they complete MQT, and any additional requirements outlined in 
AFMAN 13-1AOCV2.  (T-2) 
3.2.  Purpose.  The purpose of MQT is to prepare a crewmember for mission qualification and 
obtain CMR status in an AOC duty position. 
3.3.  Method.  MQT normally involves tailored training with an instructor, plus applicable 
classroom academics, self-study, and performance tasks as necessary.  Each AOC will determine 
the best mix of methods to meet all MQT needs. (T-2)  ACC/A3C and parent MAJCOM will 
manage the development and use of MQT course materials. (T-2)  ACC/A3C must approve and 
standardize master WS TTLs for AFMAN 13-1AOC, Volume 3, Nuclear, Space, Missile, 
Command and Control Operational Procedures-Air Operations Centers (AOC)/Operations 
Centers (OC)  positions in coordination with appropriate theater or functional MAJCOM. (T-2) 
AOC training managers in the field will develop MQT programs, based on the aforementioned 
lists that meet the mission training requirements as directed by the AOC/CC. (T-2) 
3.4.  Timeline. 
3.4.1.  Members must begin MQT within 45 days of IQT completion (90 days for ARC 
personnel). (T-3) 
3.4.2.  Members who accomplish IU-IQT must begin MQT upon completion of their final IQT 
evaluation. (T-3) 
3.4.3.  First term Airmen will begin MQT no later than 30 days of completing the First Term 
Airmen Course (30 days for ARC personnel). (T-3) 
3.4.4.  All members must complete MQT within 90 days of MQT start date (365 days for ARC 
personnel). (T-3) 
3.4.5.  If MQT cannot be started within the required time period, training managers will 
annotate it in the individual’s training records and notify AOCT, the commander and 
MAJCOM OPR as soon as possible. (T-2) 
3.4.6.  MQT is complete when the individual has been released by the COT and met all 
performance requirements as determined by unit AOCV. 
3.4.7.  Individuals may accomplish portions of MQT before formal entry into MQT; however, 
they may not complete MQT out of sequence (i.e., before IQT completion). (T-3) 
3.4.8.  Extensions:  Unit commanders may approve two sequential 30-day extensions (ARC 
units will have two sequential 180-day extension for ARC personnel). (T-2)  Report all 
extensions to MAJCOM OPRs in the unit’s quarterly report IAW paragraph 2.2.8. (T-2)  
MAJCOM OPR may grant a 30-day (180-day for ARC units) extension in addition to 
commander extensions. 
18 
AFMAN13-1AOCV1  15 MAY 2024 
3.5.  Incomplete/Failure to Progress.  If crewmember fails to complete MQT within the 
prescribed timeline commanders may restart their MQT or remove and reassign the individual to 
a non-AOC position coordinated by MAJCOM OPR (ACC/A3CO) and AFSC Functional Area 
Manager. (T-3) 
3.5.1.  Upon approval to restart MQT member must complete a remedial training plan designed 
to address discrepancies previously identified. (T-2) 
3.5.2.  Upon completion of remedial training member will be signed off by primary instructor 
indicating member is ready for evaluation. (T-2) 
3.6.  Combat Mission Ready (CMR). 
3.6.1.  CMR status is achieved when all Standardization and Evaluation (Stan/Eval) 
requirements are completed IAW AFMAN 13-1 AOCV2 and the AOC/CC, ARC AOC/CC, 
or their designated representative approve the CMR designation.  (T-2) 
3.6.2.  Upon CMR status the COT will ensure SEI codes are added to reflect the applicable 
AOC CMR team or division SEI. (T-2)  IU-IQT trained personnel will receive the AOC general 
SEI IAW the USAF Officer or Enlisted Classification Directory and paragraph 1.2.4.5. above.

THEATER ORIENTATION TRAINING 
4.1.  Introduction.  All AOCs must provide Theater Orientation training for AOC crewmembers, 
specialty team members, liaisons, and augmentees to aid their integration.  Tailor and base this 
training on expected duties, previous experience, and AOC knowledge. (T-2) The gaining AOC is 
responsible for developing content and presenting Theater Orientation training. (T-2)  Note: A 
CMR rating in any AFMAN 13-1 AOCV3 position is transferrable among the geographic and 
global/functional AOCs in the same CMR duty position upon completion of the unit’s Theater 
Orientation training and theater specific MQT items. (T-3) 
4.2.  Purpose.  Theater Orientation training is a menu of training modules consisting of any 
combination of e-learning lessons, briefings, or directed self-study.  The AOC training manager 
designs the menu with tailoring to the individual.  The AOC/CC or Division Chief approves the 
menu if the commander delegates approval authority. (T-3) 
4.3.  Method.  Each AOC will present a Theater Orientation training program containing 
individual requirements. (T-3) The requirements may include the following subject areas: 
4.3.1.  AOC fundamentals. 
4.3.2.  Unit mission or Theater Orientation. 
4.3.3.  Chain of command/command relationships. 
4.3.4.  Applicable planning and execution documents. 
4.3.5.  Augmentee positional responsibilities.

Chapter 5 
CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT) 
5.1.  Introduction.  CT provides crewmembers with the volume, frequency, and mix of training 
necessary to maintain CMR proficiency.  CT is an annual requirement that begins after a 
crewmember receives CMR status and should be a deliberate process throughout the year.  Units 
are responsible for developing a CT plan as part of their ATP, focusing on the unit’s mission or 
support for any upcoming major exercises or Operation Plan development.  Note: Mandatory AF 
training, generally referred to as ancillary training, may not count toward CT.  (T-2) 
5.1.1.  Content: AOCs have common CT requirements levied by MAJCOM OPR; however, 
each AOC will add their unique CT requirements to their ATP.  (T-2)  In addition to common 
CT requirements, each AOC crewmember will participate, to the maximum extent possible, in 
an exercise (at a minimum, once per year for active duty personnel and once every two years 
for ARC personnel). (T-2) 
5.1.1.1.  Exercise participation will be in primary or secondary duty positions. (T-2) 
5.1.1.2.  Exercise participation may accomplish other CT requirements. 
5.1.1.3.  AOCT will report AOC personnel without participation in an annual exercise to 
MAJCOM OPR annually (bi-annually for ARC personnel).  (T-2) 
5.1.1.4.  Deployment as an AOC crewmember will satisfy the exercise requirement for all 
personnel.  See Attachment 3, AOC CT Requirements. (T-2) 
5.1.1.5.  AOCs have CT requirements in the following five primary categories: 
5.1.1.5.1.  Doctrine.  (T-2) 
5.1.1.5.2.  Theater Guidance.  (T-2) 
5.1.1.5.3.  AOC System/Applications.  (T-2) 
5.1.1.5.4.  Understanding of the Operational Environment.  (T-2) 
5.1.1.5.5.  AOC Process/positional training.  (T-2) 
5.1.2.  Purpose:  CT maintains AOC process/positional qualification (CMR status) and 
expands operational C2 level knowledge and skills.  CT is the Commander’s and Division 
Chief’s tool to ensure that personnel are always ready to support the CCDR, JFACC, and Area 
Air Defense Commander.  AOC crewmembers with qualifications in more than one position 
must meet CT requirements for each position.  (T-3)  Dual-qualified crewmembers with like 
CT requirements that are the same for each position only need to perform the specific CT 
requirement for one position. 
5.1.3.  Method:  CT may consist of any combination of mass academics, e-learning, directed 
self-study, systems training, positional refresher training, or exercises. 
5.1.4.  Timeline:  CT requirements begin the first duty day of the following month after the 
individual is designated CMR.  (T-2)  Attachment 3 and unit ATPs contain examples of CT 
requirements.  Unit/MAJCOM supplements will address CT requirements specific to their 
global/functional AOCs.  (T-2) Units may prorate CT. Waivers should be the exception and 
must be submitted for MAJCOM approval and copied to ACC/A3CO (T-2). The AOC/ARC 
AFMAN13-1AOCV1  15 MAY 2024 
21 
Commander will evaluate and approve waivers on a case-by-case basis.  (T-3)  CT waivers are 
a reportable item in MAJCOM quarterly report.  (T-2) 
5.1.4.1.  ARC units will accomplish CT (IAW Attachment 3) over a two-year, vice one-
year period.  (T-2) Thus, quarterly requirements become semi-annual, semi-annual become 
annual requirements, and annual requirements become biennial for ARC units.  (T-3) 
5.1.4.2.  AFRC Individual Mobilization Augmentees who qualify as CMR in geographic 
AOCs assume CT timelines in paragraph 5.1.4.1. 
5.1.4.3.  Proration:  Units may prorate CT requirements based on initial CMR date, 
temporary duty (TDYs), deployments, or periods of non-AOC duty (e.g., honor guard, 
medical leave).  Unit must ensure training requirements account for time supporting 
contingencies.  (T-3)  Units will prorate fiscal year CT requirements on a one-for-one basis.  
(T-3) 
5.1.4.4.  Failure to meet CT requirements willresult in regression to non-Combat Mission 
Ready (N-CMR) status.  (T-3) AOC/CCs may allow up to a 30-day grace period to 
accomplish CT requirements.  ARC unit commanders may allow up to a 180-day grace 
period. 
5.1.4.5.  Certified Instructors must supervise N-CMR crewmembers performing AOC  
DOC statement mission duties. (T-2) AOC personnel in IQT and initial duty position MQT 
are not N-CMR.  (T-2) 
5.1.4.6.  To regain CMR status, a crewmember must accomplish the delinquent CT. (T-2)  
The individual’s training records must reflect both the regression to N-CMR and the 
reacquisition of CMR status.  (T-2) 
5.1.4.7.  Failure to regain CMR within 6 months (18 months for ARC) results in regression 
to unqualified status.  To regain CMR status, the crewmember must complete a 
commander-approved requalification training program.  (T-2)

Terms 
Ancillary Training—Universal training, guidance, or instruction, regardless of AFSC, that 
contributes to mission accomplishment. 
AOC Personnel—AOC personnel fill operational, mission-essential positions in AOC core 
divisions and specialty teams. These positions are described in AFMAN 13-1AOCV3. AOC 
personnel may be military, civilian, or contractor personnel and are permanently assigned to active 
duty or ARC AOC units. Additionally, due to AOC manning constraints and unique theater or 
functional requirements, AOC units may require locally developed personnel positions supporting 
30 
AFMAN13-1AOCV1  15 MAY 2024 
a CCDR that are not identified in AFMAN 13-1AOCV3. Unique positions and training associated 
with these positions will be identified in a unit supplement to this AFMAN. 
AOC Support Units—Facilities which provide mission essential information or support to the 
AOC Enterprise.  They include SPO Production Center, 505 CCW, 363 ISR Group, and 
Operational Support Center HD. 
Augmentee—Personnel filling AOC positions on a temporary basis (e.g., TDY or exercises).  
Augmentees require tailored Theater Orientation training and may require positional training.  
Augmentee training is the responsibility of the gaining AOC. 
Basic Qualification (BQ)—An AOC crewmember who has completed IQT but not completed 
MQT. 
Certification—Procedure used to document competency in a particular task.  Not interchangeable 
with “qualification” which requires AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification or AF Form 
4350, Certificate of Intelligence Qualification documentation.  It is also the designation of an 
individual by the unit commander or division chief as having completed required training and 
being capable of performing a specific duty. 
Combat Mission Ready (CMR—)—The status of individuals who successfully complete IQT 
and MQT, pass a mission qualification, and is approved by the AOC/CC. 
Global/functional AOC/OC—An AOC/OC which has function-specific missions that are 
worldwide in support of a Combatant Command or a subordinate Unified Command with a 
functional mission.  They include:  AFSOC OC, 608 AOC (Global/functional Strike), 618 AOC 
(Mobility), and 616 OC (Cyber). 
Geographic AOC—An AOC which has broad-ranging missions constrained to a geographic Area 
of Responsibility, in support of a geographic unified (or sub-unified) combatant command with an 
assigned operational area.  The geographic AOCs include:  601, 603, 607, 609, 611, 612, and 613 
AOCs. 
Liaison Officer—In the context of this document, a liaison officer is a representative working for 
their own respective commander while providing planning/tasking expertise and coordination 
capability in support of the AOC.  A liaison officer may represent an allied nation, sister service, 
other government agencies, or a unique major WS/mission.  AOCs will provide and document 
theater orientation training to liaison officers to facilitate integration. 
Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR)—This is the status of an individual who does not meet 
training cycle CT requirements, or at unit commander or division chief direction.  N-CMR 
crewmembers require direct supervision by an instructor. 
Requalification Training—Tailored training for formerly-CMR AOC personnel that have 
become unqualified.  The objective is to return to CMR status.  Completion will be followed by 
positional re-evaluation and accomplishment of recurring qualification examination. 
Instructor—AOC personnel, authorized via AOC instructor upgrade program and AOC/CC 
approval, to conduct AOC crewmember training.  Instructor may also be contractors with subject 
matter expertise. 
In-Unit Initial Qualification Training (IU-IQT)—Initial Qualification Training conducted by 
the respective unit. IU-IQT is to be used only under extreme circumstances when a member is 
AFMAN13-1AOCV1  15 MAY 2024 
31 
unable to attend training at the FTU. An approved IU-IQT waiver is required PRIOR to the 
member beginning training. 
Training Task List (TTL)—Documentation of total training tasks developed for a prime mission 
system and its respective mission.  It includes the entire spectrum of tasks in each functional area 
requiring training.  The TTL provides the training task baseline for all acquisition, modification, 
support, management, and funding actions through comparison with predecessor or future prime 
mission systems (AFI 10-217, Management of Air Force Operational Training and 
Undergraduate Aircrew Training Systems).  MAJCOMs with their respective AOCs develop AOC 
TTLs.  AF/A3T must approve AOC TTLs.  ACC/A3C will standardize all AFMAN 13-1 AOCV3 
listed duty positions in their Combat Air Forces TTLs.  ACC/A3C will post TTLs to the AOC 
Intelink site. 
Type 1-Training—Contract training by civilian industrial institutions, supporting initial cadre 
operators and systems/network administrators to be instructors for new or modified AOC systems 
(often referred to as “train the trainer”).  The AOC training manager will coordinate this training 
with AFMC/AFLCMC specifically the AOC PMO (Air Force Life Cycle Management 
Center/HSGB).  Type 1 Training should be documented as such IAW pertinent AOC Type chapter 
of this publication. 
Unqualified—Previously CMR AOC personnel whose CMR status has lapsed due to any of the 
following reasons:  N-CMR in excess of six months, PCS/permanent change of assignment out of 
AOC assignment, or AOC/CC-directed.  See Requalification Training.  Note:  AOC crewmember-
trainees in IQT are not “unqualified,” they are “not qualified.”  In addition, those in MQT status 
are not unqualified, but rather basic qualified. 
Weapon System—A combination of one or more weapons with all related equipment, materials, 
services, personnel, and means of delivery and deployment (if applicable) required for self 
sufficiency.
