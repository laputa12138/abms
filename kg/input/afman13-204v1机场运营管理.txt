(Add) A7.1. AO-CV Overview. The AO-CV evaluates the ability of the air traffic system (e.g., 
AOM, ATC, AM, RAWS) to meet safety standards and operational requirements of military and 
civil users. The objective is to analyze and evaluate pertinent Airfield Operations functional 
areas for safety and operational compliance. The AO-CV provides the means to resolve 
identified deficiencies at the appropriate command echelons and offers MAJCOMs and units a 
means of self-evaluation and improvement. MAJCOMs can then analyze trend data derived to 
continuously improve AO policies or procedures.  
(Add) A7.1.1. Guiding Regulations 
(Add) A7.1.1.1. Memorandum of Agreement Between the DOT, Federal Aviation 
Administration, and the U.S. Army-Navy-Air Force (Appendix 4-2) located within FAAO 
7610.14, Non-Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations.  
(Add) A7.1.1.2. USAF ATC (e.g., staffing, qualifications, certifications, performance, 
procedures) is governed by FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, FAAO 7610.14 and

(Add) A7.1.1.4. USAF Radar, Airfield, and Weather Systems (e.g., equipment, staffing, 
qualifications, performance, procedures) are governed by FAAO 7610.14, FAAO 8200.1D, 
United States Flight Inspection Manual, and implemented through portions of DAFMAN 13-
204V4, Radar, Airfield and Weather Systems.  
(Add) A7.1.1.5. USAF Airfield Operations (e.g., equipment, staffing, qualifications, 
performance, procedures) are governed by AFMAN 13-204V1. 
(Add) A7.1.2. Program Objectives  
(Add) A7.1.3. Evaluate from an operational viewpoint, Airfield Operations for safety, 
compatibility, and adequacy.  
(Add) A7.1.4. Evaluate functional areas within the air traffic system for compliance with USAF, 
FAA, MAJCOM, or applicable host nation (e.g., International Civil Aviation Organization and 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization) requirements, as applicable. 
 (Add) A7.1.5. Identify negative trends and oversee corrective actions.  
(Add) A7.1.6. Identify positive trends and successful practices for benchmark and cross-
utilization. 
 (Add) A7.1.7. Identify shortfalls in compliance of Air Force policies or previously implemented 
corrective actions.  
(Add) A7.2. Scheduling Inspections. 
(Add) A7.2.1. MAJCOMs will conduct AO-CV evaluations where they have functional 
responsibility (to include host nation locations) for AOM, ATC, AM or RAWS. (T-2) Forward a 
copy of MAJCOM annual (fiscal year) AO-CV schedule and augmentation requests to AFFSA 
and subordinate units by 01 August each year and provide schedule changes as they occur. Note: 
AO-CV inspections for expeditionary units will be at the discretion of the applicable MAJCOM and DAFI 
90-302 guidance. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.2.2. MAJCOM AO-CV Team Chief will coordinate inspections with the MAJCOM 
IG Gatekeeper not later than 60 days prior to an event or as soon as possible when an AO-CV is 
required, based on negative safety trend requirements. (T-2) This coordination includes any 
visits to conduct a Staff Assist Visit, audit, certify, accredit, or evaluate a unit. Gatekeeper 
scheduling requirements can be found in DAFI 90-302.  
(Add) A7.2.3. After coordinating with Gatekeeper, the Team Chief may work with the AOF/CC 
to provide a list of AO-CV team requirements (e.g., office space, computer support, and phones), 
a request for any locally identified items requiring special attention and AO-CV questionnaires 
(as determined and created by the MAJCOMs) along with instructions for their distribution, 
completion, and collection. Note: MAJCOMs will make all efforts to not add additional 
workload on the units for items that are already available via other means (SharePoint®, MICT, 
etc). (T-2) 
(Add) A7.2.4. Evaluations will follow a 24-month cycle for Department of the Air Force 
locations and a 48-month cycle for each ANG Wing. (T-2) When able, MAJCOMs will 
minimize operational impact by conducting evaluations concurrently with other evaluations and 
inspections (e.g., IG or FAA inspections). Evaluation frequency may be adjusted plus or minus 6 
months to support reducing the evaluation team footprint if the AO-CV is combined with other 
inspection/evaluation programs. A MAJCOM waiver (from AO Branch Chief) is required to go 
beyond 48 months (ANG) if not being combined with another inspection. No waiver is required 
6 
 
to perform inspection prior to 48 (ANG) months. Note: ANG will conduct their own AO-CV 
inspections. 
(Add) A7.2.5. MAJCOMs can conduct an AO-CV at any time based on negative safety trends or 
unsafe conditions identified through trend and analysis, such as mishap reports, Near Mid-Air 
Collison, HATRs, runway incursions/CMAV violations, loss of required ATC separation events, 
controller rating suspensions, and/or Aircrew Safety Action Program reports. 
(Add) A7.3. Conducting the Evaluation. AO-CV evaluations consist of two distinct, but 
related, components that are normally conducted simultaneously: a system evaluation for safety 
of operations and a compliance evaluation for conformity to checklist criteria based on written 
instructions. Evaluators will observe airfield operations, review local airfield procedures, 
readiness of units (AFFORGEN) and evaluate safety compliance. (T-2) A system evaluation is 
appropriate to contracted locations or functions, whereas a compliance evaluation should only be 
applied in accordance with the performance work standard or statement of work. If MAJCOMs 
have direct functional (AOM, ATC, AM or RAWS) oversight of Quality Assurance Evaluators 
(QAEs) and those QAEs periodically conduct on-site evaluations using MAJCOM-approved 
checklists, this meets the intent of the evaluation program, and a formal system evaluation is not 
required. Alternatively, MAJCOMs may seek cooperative agreements with the FAA Air Traffic 
Evaluations Division, AAT-100, to evaluate ATC service contracts. MAJCOMs will determine 
whether AO-CV or quality assurance visits by a Subject Matter Expert (SME) quality assurance 
evaluator is appropriate at contracted locations. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.3.1. Inspection Findings Management: 
(Add) A7.3.1.1. Purpose. Evaluators will ensure inspection reports document primary and non-
primary inspection activity findings, including safety, and surety. (T-2) These concerns may 
directly affect an overall inspection rating at the discretion of the inspection Team Chief. 
Recommended Improvement Areas are used to identify areas where a more efficient or effective 
course of action is available. Do not use Recommended Improvement Areas to document 
procedural deviations or non-compliance. 
(Add) A7.3.1.2. Self-identified findings. Critical self-assessments foster a continuous 
improvement process and reduce reliance on external inspection teams. Holistically, self-
assessments build cohesive bonds of trust between commanders, Airmen, and evaluators. This 
trust begins with the shared goal of improving the unit’s effectiveness. A key component to 
building and sustaining trust in the Air Force Inspection System is creating an environment 
where Airmen feel they can safely report the ground truth with accuracy, underpinning a 
professional AO enterprise. Evaluators may duplicate deficiencies or observations in Inspector 
General Enterprise Management System (IGEMS), MICT, or other self-assessment 
documentation/tracking methods by the inspected organization if the inspected organization has 
not accurately identified the nature, validity, or severity of the deficiency; an acceptable 
corrective action plan with a practical suspense; or for the purpose of identifying a repeat 
deficiency.  
(Add) A7.3.1.3. Validation. MAJCOM evaluators will establish and document a validation 
process providing the inspected unit or the organization with the deficiency an opportunity to 
clarify any findings identified during the inspection in a timely manner. (T-2) Prior to the 
inspection being finalized, inspectors will coordinate with the inspected unit on CRITICAL, 
SIGNIFICANT, MINOR, and off-checklist deficiencies identified during the inspection and 
document collaboration. 
7 
 
(Add) A7.3.2.4. Format will follow DAFI 90-302 specifications for write-ups and overall 
inspection ratings. Sample reports and template can be found at the AFFSA/XA SharePoint® 
(https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/affsa/SitePages/Airfield-Operations.aspx). AO-CV reports must be 
completed and distributed within 30 days of evaluation to AFFSA/XA (hqaffsa.xa@us.af.mil), 
Wing IGs (for IGEMS tracking), applicable Operations Group(s) and Operation Support 
Squadron(s). (T-2) 
(Add) A7.3.2.4.1. Evaluators will describe deficiencies in detailed, factual narrative to clearly 
report areas requiring resolution. The written description alone should be adequate for the 
inspected organization to begin corrective action planning.  (T-2)   
(Add) A7.3.2.4.2. Reference to the applicable instruction, technical order, or other source 
documentation from which the requirement is derived. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.3.2.4.3. A severity (CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, or MINOR) based on impact to the 
organization’s mission.  (T-2) 
(Add) A7.3.2.4.4. Overall assessment of the air traffic system. Make specific note of strengths 
and weaknesses. Final inspection ratings: HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, EFFECTIVE, 
MARGINALLY-EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE. Note: An overall INEFFECTIVE rating 
will generate a Follow-up Inspection. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.3.2.4.5.1. INEFFECTIVE Rating and re-inspection will be accomplished within 12 
months of initial inspection.  
(Add) A7.3.2.4.5. Identify the Office of Primary Responsibility charged with resolving the 
deficiency and any Offices of Coordinating Responsibility charged with assisting in resolving the 
deficiency. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.3.2.4.6. For deficiencies involving host/tenant organizations outside the inspected 
unit’s chain of command or non-Air Force entities, categorize as higher headquarters/Support 
Agency Deficiencies. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.3.2.4.7. List the functional area (AOM, AM, ATC, or RAWS) for all findings to 
enable functional analysis and feedback. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.4. Briefings.  
(Add) A7.4.1. Team In-brief and daily briefings. It is recommended that the AOF/CC coordinate 
and schedule an AOB on the first day of the AO-CV as an In-Brief. The In-Brief is still required 
if the AOB is not utilized for the WG/CV or designated representative; not to be delegated lower 
than the senior operations commander or equivalent. (T-2) The AOF/CC will coordinate any 
additional meetings as requested by MAJCOM/Team Chief. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.4.2. Team Out brief. The AOF/CC will coordinate and schedule the final out-brief 
with the WG/CV or designated representative; not to be delegated lower than the senior 
operations commander or equivalent. (T-2) The following information must be briefed by the 
MAJCOM AO Team Chief (as a minimum) (T-2)  
(Add) A7.4.2.1. Overall assessment of the air traffic system. Make specific note of strengths and 
weaknesses. Final inspection ratings: HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, EFFECTIVE, MARGINALLY-
EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE. Note: An overall ineffective rating will generate a Follow-
Up Inspection. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.4.2.1.1. HIGHLY EFFECTIVE – The rating given to indicate performance or 
operations exceed mission requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in a superior 
8 
 
manner. Resources and programs are very efficiently managed and mostly deficiency-free. Risk-
based criteria are often applied when allocating resources and making decisions. Root-Cause 
Analysis is often used to find and fix problems. Processes in place are mature and well 
established. Deficiencies are rare. 
(Add) A7.4.2.1.2. EFFECTIVE – The rating given to indicate performance or operations meet 
expectations and mission requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in an effective 
and efficient manner. Resources and programs are managed with few deficiencies. Risk- based 
criteria are usually applied when allocating resources and making decisions. Root-Cause 
Analysis is usually used to find and fix problems. Processes in place are sufficient to meet 
mission requirements. Deficiencies exist which do not impede or limit mission accomplishment. 
(Add) A7.4.2.1.3. MARGINALLY-EFFECTIVE – The rating given to indicate performance or 
operations barely meeting expectations and mission requirements. Procedures and activities are 
carried out, but not in an effective or efficient manner. Resources and programs are insufficiently 
managed with some deficiencies. Risk and resource scarcity is sometimes considered in 
decision-making. Little effort is given to increasing efficiency or reliability or use of root-cause 
analysis. Processes are not well-established causing inconsistent results. Deficiencies exist which 
may impede or limit mission accomplishment. 
(Add) A7.4.2.1.4. INEFFECTIVE – The rating given to indicate performance or operation needs 
significant improvement. Procedures and activities are not carried out in a competent manner or 
produce unreliable results. Resources and programs are not well-managed. Risk and resource 
scarcity is rarely considered in decision-making processes. No effort at increasing efficiency or 
reliability is evident. Deficiencies exist which impede or limit mission accomplishment. 
(Add) A7.4.2.3. Results of SIIs evaluated. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.4.2.4. Findings/deficiencies. Identify all findings/deficiencies and indicate urgency of 
resolution. Indicate severity as (CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, or MINOR) based on impact to the 
organization’s mission. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.4.2.5. Off Checklist Problems. Identify the number of problems found and define 
relative impact of noncompliance, i.e., aircraft separation errors vs. minor administrative 
oversight. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.4.2.6. Required follow-up actions. Specify when the unit should expect the report, the 
contents of the report, reply instructions and the tracking and closing processes. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.5. Checklists. Evaluators will use the downloadable Self-Assessment Checklists 
(SAC) available on the AFFSA XA Airfield Operations Directorate SharePoint® 
(https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/affsa/SitePages/Airfield-Operations.aspx) to evaluate compliance with 
established guidance and standards. (T-2) MICT will be used to track checklists. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.5.1. Off-Checklist Problems. MAJCOM supplemental requirements are deficiencies 
related to non-compliance with regulatory guidance not found in HAF/MAJCOM SACs. 
AFFSA/XA will analyze off-checklist problems for trends and may add related checklist items to 
SACs. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.6. Special Interest Items. SIIs focus management’s attention on negative trends or 
emergent compliance updates that require particular attention to prevent significant AO safety 
challenges. MAJCOM staff identify annual AO-CV SIIs using trend data from the previous year’s 
AO-CV reports and by anticipating emergent issues with potential mission impact within their 
command. Recognizing the subjectivity of SII checklists, one or more unsatisfactory item(s) does 
9 
 
not automatically render the entire SII unsatisfactory. The SII would only be unsatisfactory if the 
extent and gravity of deficiencies have mission impact or safety of flight implications, i.e., justify 
a CRITICAL write-up. 
(Add) A7.7. Deficiency Resolution Instructions. The OG/CC or equivalent will ensure AO-
CV findings and actions taken to resolve deficiencies are addressed per this AFMAN and 
MAJCOM supplemental guidance. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.7.1. Findings Resolution. MAJCOM Airfield Operations Branch is the closure 
authority for CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, and MINOR deficiencies. The closure authority for 
critical, significant, and minor deficiencies may be delegated to Wing/CC to expedite the closure 
process and will be delegated in the associated AO-CV report, as applicable to each specific 
deficiency. The MAJCOM airfield operations staff will notify the wing in writing of CRITICAL, 
SIGNIFICANT, and MINOR findings for closure via IGEMS and forward a copy (written or 
electronic) to AFFSA/XA. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.7.2. MAJCOM evaluation teams will provide the inspected unit with closure 
instructions. (T-2) The inspected unit will provide associated corrective action plans to 
MAJCOM Airfield Operations Branch, no later than 45 calendar days (90 calendar days for Air 
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units after being assigned in IGEMS or tracked through AOBs, 
if IGEMS is not available. (T-2) MAJCOM Airfield Operations evaluators will assign any 
Deficiency Cause Codes required to describe the deficiency (use only one Root Cause per 
deficiency). (T-2) 
(Add) A.7.7.3. Additional guidance on closing deficiencies in IGEMS or MICT are listed in 
DAFI 90-302.  
(Add) A7.7.4. Corrective action plans will include Root-Cause(s), Deficiency Cause Codes. (T-
2) Deficiency Cause Codes explanations can be found in DAFI 90-302, corrective action plan 
Offices of Primary Responsibility, and estimated closure dates. Corrective action plans are 
required for CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies; IGs will ensure this data is 
documented in IGEMS or tracked through AOBs, if IGEMS is not available. (T-1) The 
corrective action plan approval authority (owning MAJCOM) must approve, modify, or reject 
(with associated constructive comments) within 15 calendar days of receipt (30 calendar days for 
ARC units). (T-2) 
(Add) A7.7.5. Squadron Commanders and AOF/CCs, or civilian equivalent, will ensure Root-
Cause Analysis is completed for CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies using the problem-
solving approach/tool and level of effort best suited to the situation. (T-2) Note: This does not 
include Off-Checklist Problems. 
(Add) A7.7.6. MAJCOM Airfield Operations Branch may close the deficiency (CRITICAL and 
SIGNIFICANT) when the corrective action plan is entered in IGEMS, is fully implemented, and 
the results of the plan have been validated by the MAJCOM evaluation team.  
(Add) A7.7.7. Deficiencies should be closed within 12 months (18 months for ANG) from the 
date of the write-up listed in the AO-CV report, if all applicable corrective actions are 
completed. 
(Add) A7.8. Follow-up Evaluations. A follow-up evaluation may be conducted as deemed 
necessary by MAJCOM AO staff. Normally, this determination will be based on the number and 
potential/actual impact of system deficiencies identified during the AO-CV. An overall ineffective 
rating will generate a follow-up inspection. 
10 
 
 (Add) A7.8.1. Team members will assess wing/unit progress in correcting deficiencies and offer 
further recommendations, as applicable, to assist with the finding's resolutions process. (T-2) 
Evaluators will review documented action taken to correct previously identified deficiencies and 
confirm closure for those deficiencies that have been resolved. (T-2) Note: Should a functional 
area follow-up evaluation be required, only the specific functional area will be re-evaluated. (T-
2) 
(Add) A7.8.2. Follow-up evaluations, if necessary, will be completed within 12 months of the 
AO-CV and will be accomplished by an on-site visit or virtual inspection. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.8.3. Completion of a follow-up evaluation does not reset the AO-CV cycle; next AO-
CV will be conducted IAW timelines outlined in paragraph A7.2.4. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.8.4. MAJCOMs will advise the Wing Gatekeeper at least 30 days prior to conducting 
an on-site follow-up evaluation. (T-2) 
(Add) A7.9. Benchmarks. A Benchmark is a process, procedure, or activity which clearly 
establishes a superior standard of service or performance. Benchmarks have a high potential to 
apply to a broader organizational spectrum than where the process, program, or technique was 
originally employed. Inspection teams process benchmarks as follows: 
(Add) A7.9.1. Any inspector may identify potential benchmarks during the normal course of 
conducting inspections. The author of a benchmark will include the name and contact 
information of the individual at the applicable Pertinent Oversight Authority for the submission, 
a description of whether the benchmark was accepted, and any concerns will be listed in the 
narrative portion of the IGEMS report. After the MAJCOM Team Chief approves a benchmark, 
it becomes part of the final inspection report. 
(Add) A7.9.2. Units or individuals who developed Benchmarks identified by inspectors may 
further submit them for formal approval through the Airmen Powered by Innovation process 
outlined in DAFI 38-402, Airmen Powered by Innovation and Suggestion Program. 
(Add) A7.10. Superior Performers. MAJCOM Airfield Operations Inspection Team should 
highlight superior performers during the AO-CV. Members of the Airfield Operations Flight that 
demonstrate superior performance in carrying out their duty, professionalism, created innovative 
programs or processes etc... should be highlighted by the MAJCOM Airfield Operations 
Inspection Team. There is no limit to the number of Superior Performers; it will be at the 
discretion of the Airfield Operations Inspection Team to select. (T-2)

This Air Force Manual (AFMAN) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD), 13-2, Air 
Traffic Control, Airfield, Airspace, and Range Management.  It applies to all Regular Air Force 
(RegAF) and including the US Space Force until further notice, Air National Guard (ANG) and 
Air Force Reserve (AFR) organizations (to include contracted locations) who operate or 
administer functions and facilities for airfield operations.  At joint, shared-use, and overseas 
airfields, this manual applies to the facilities controlled and used exclusively by the Department 
of the Air Force, as outlined in international agreements, real estate documents or other written 
agreements.  This manual outlines key duties and responsibilities of airfield operations officers.  
This manual also provides detailed guidance, procedures and programs for managing airfield 
operations where the Air Force has functional oversight responsibility.  This manual may be 
supplemented at any level; however, all Major Command (MAJCOM) supplements to include 
interim changes to previously approved supplements must be routed to Air Force Flight 
Standards Agency, Director of Airfield Operations (AFFSA/XA) for coordination prior to 
certification and approval.  References to MAJCOM within this publication refer to the 
MAJCOM Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for Airfield Operations.  Unit (wing or base) 
level supplements to this publication must be routed to the responsible MAJCOM OPR for 
Airfield Operations for coordination prior to certification and approval.  The authorities to waive 
wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) 
number following the compliance statement.  See Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-360,

Chapter 1 
GENERAL 
1.1.  Overview.  This manual provides guidance for managing airfield operations personnel (to 
include DoD civilians, contractors), facilities and airfields.  Within the context of this manual, 
airfield operations is comprised of air traffic control (ATC); airfield management (AM); and 
radar, airfield and weather system (RAWS) services where the Air Force has functional oversight 
responsibility.  Exception:  Airfield operations officers do not have oversight responsibility over 
RAWS where RAWS is a stand-alone flight (i.e. when RAWS works directly for the Operations 
Support Squardron Commander (OSS/CC).  This manual is complemented by AFMAN 13-204, 
Volume 2, Airfield Management, AFMAN 13-204 Volume 3, Air Traffic Control and AFMAN 
13-204 Volume 4, Radar, Airfield and Weather Systems.  
1.2.  The Military and Civilian Aviation Integration Division.  The Military and Civilian 
Aviation Integration Division, Career Field Management is responsible for Air Force Specialty 
Codes (AFSCs) 13MX, Airfield Operations officer; 1C1X1, Air Traffic Control (ATC); and 
1C7X1, Airfield Management (AM), 1C8X3, Radar, Airfield and Weather Systems (RAWS).  
Career Field Manager (CFM) duties will be executed in accordance with AFI 36-2101, 
Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), AFI 36-2670, Total Force Development, 
and AFI 38-201, Management of Manpower Requirements and Authorizations.  This list is not 
exclusive. 
1.3.  Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA).  Air Force Flight Standards Agency is 
responsible for terminal area airfield operations (i.e., ATC, AM and RAWS) matters.  In this 
capacity, AFFSA executes responsibilities as outlined in AFMD 27, Air Force Flight Standards 
Agency (AFFSA), in keeping with policy guidance provided by the Air Staff.  For the purpose of 
addressing specific procedural, training, standardization, architecture and integration issues 
directly related to airfield operations, AFFSA may have cause to interact with the MAJCOMs, 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and other military services. 
1.4.  Operations at Contingency Locations.  Contingency is defined as a situation requiring 
military operations in response to natural disasters, terrorists, subversives, or as otherwise 
directed by appropriate authority to protect United States interests.  At contingency locations, 
outside the United States, the senior airfield authority (SAA) may waive airfield operations 
procedures outlined in this manual to support tactical or combat operations.  This authority must 
not be exercised below the SAA level. (T-1).  Prior to issuance of such a waiver, the following 
actions must be accomplished: 
1.4.1.  Conduct a risk management assessment with the rationale for the waiver and explain 
(1) how complying with the requirement/compliance item impacts mission accomplishment, 
OR (2) cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower) 
creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; OR (3) expected cost of compliance 
outweighs the benefit; OR (4) personnel cannot comply with the requirement due to a lack of  
 
 
AFMAN13-204V1  22 JULY 2020 
7 
resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower).  NOTE: SAA 
waiver period must not exceed requested waiver period or 30 calendar days after the 
approving commander’s deployment length, whichever is shorter.  (T-1).  Because waivers 
are the expression of a specific commander’s risk acceptance, approved waivers 
automatically expire 30 calendar days after a change in commander, unless the new 
commander renews the waiver. 
1.4.2.  Forward proposed waivers to the Air Force Forces staff or equivalent for an 
operational review if time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA. 
1.4.3.  Refer to Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-4.4, Contingency 
Airfield Operations for additional information.  This AFTTP outlines how Air Force Forces 
open and operate a deployed or contingency airfield.  This AFTTP volume also contains 
planning considerations for airfield management, ATC, and deployable air traffic control and 
landing systems capabilities, procedures, forces, and equipment. 
1.5.  Airfields Operated Pursuant to Contract.  This manual applies to locations where DoD 
or Air Force access is pursuant to contract, to the extent specifically outlined in the contract 
statement of work (SOW) and/or performance work statement (PWS).  Locations unable to 
comply with this criteria due to pre-existing SOWs are exempt until such time that the current 
contract expires.  Locations that exclude this manual, shall specifically state rationale for the 
exclusion in the SOW.  (T-2). 
1.6.  Overseas Locations.  Any host nation procedures, or procedures based on otherwise 
inapplicable international regulations that are being implemented to fulfill basing or similar 
agreements should be implemented consistent with this manual to the extent possible.  While 
agreed practices adopted for Air Force use in overseas areas take precedence, every effort should 
be made to conform to this manual. 
1.6.1.  MAJCOMs must identify any special procedures agreed with host nations in their 
supplement to this manual.  Refer conflicting procedures to HQ AFFSA prior to 
implementation. 
1.6.2.  Airfield operations personnel augmenting a facility operated by another branch of the 
U.S. military will comply with their regulations and procedures as applicable.  (T-0). 
1.7.  Waivers. 
1.7.1.  Units shall use the AF Form 679, Air Force Publication Compliance Item Waiver 
Request/Approval to process waivers to this manual.  (T-1).  
1.7.2.  Unit waiver request must include the following: 
1.7.2.1.  A paragraph reference or text of the specific requirement for which the 
commander/director is requesting a waiver.  (T-1).  
1.7.2.2.  Rationale for the waiver. (T-1).  Explain which one of the following reasons 
apply and why: (1) How complying with the requirement/compliance item impacts 
mission accomplishment, (2) Cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, 
guidance or manpower) creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; or (3) 
Expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit; OR (4) personnel cannot comply 
with the requirement due to a lack of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, 
guidance or manpower). 
8 
AFMAN13-204V1  22 JULY 2020 
1.7.2.3.  Time period or circumstance the waiver is needed.  (T-1).  NOTE:  Tier 1, 2, 
and 3 waivers may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver period or 
90 calendar after the approving commander’s tour length, whichever is shorter.  Because 
waiver are the expression of a specific commander’s risk acceptance, approved waivers 
automatically expire 90 calendar days after a change in commander unless the new 
commander renews the waiver. 
1.7.2.4.  Risk mitigation measures to be implemented, if necessary, by the requesting 
commander during the waiver period.  (T-1). 
1.7.2.5.  Impact if waiver is disapproved.  (T-1). 
1.7.3.  If deemed necessary, submit additional data (e.g., letters of procedure, airspace maps, 
traffic patterns, airfield diagrams) to substantiate the waiver request. 
1.7.4.  Units must provide an informational copy of all Tier 3 approved waivers to MAJCOM 
OPR for airfield operations.  (T-2).  
1.7.5.  Units will submit waivers to applicable FAA publications through their respective 
commander for coordination from the MAJCOM OPR for airfield operations, AFFSA/XA 
and the appropriate Air Force representative (AFREP). (T-0).  The AFREP submits the 
request to FAA and notifies the requesting unit, MAJCOM OPR for airfield operations, and 
AFFSA/XA of the results. 
1.7.6.  The requestor’s unit commander must forward a copy of the approved waiver to the 
AFFSA/XA workflow at hqaffsa.xa@us.af.mil within 30 calendar days of approval for 
situational awareness and process improvement considerations.  (T-1).   
1.7.7.  Approved waivers become part of the approver’s and requestor’s official records and 
are appropriately filed in accordance with AFI 33-322. (T-1).  
1.8.  Governing Directives.  Airfield operations services are governed by AFIs, AFMANs, and, 
to the extent applicable, FAA orders, parts of the Code of Federal Regulations, and any host 
nation procedures which have been adopted for Air Force use, unless specifically exempted or 
waived. Unit commanders may contact AFFSA through their respective MAJCOM OPR for 
assistance determining the applicability of directives. 
1.9.  Issuing New Air Force Airfield Operations Policy or Procedures.  New policies or 
procedures are sent out via message and posted on the AFFSA Airfield Operations SharePoint® 
website.  Airfield operations staff personnel are required to utilize the AFFSA Airfield 
Operations SharePoint® website to download and/or view messages. 
1.10.  Duty Titles.  Duty Titles are determined by the unit manpower document (UMD) 
authorizations earned through the 13E1 Capabilities-Based Manpower Determinant. Failure to 
use authorizations as described and earned on the UMD could result in the reduction of 
authorizations or removal of personnel (not applicable to ANG and AFR).  Request a variance to 
the manpower standard when additional related responsibilities and/or workload levied on the 
AOF merit increased manpower authorizations.

AFMAN13-204V1  22 JULY 2020 
3.8.2.6.  AFM coordinates with base support agencies such as Civil Engineering (CE), 
Fire Department, Security Forces, Wing Safety, Aircraft Maintenance, Fuels Control and 
Wing Plans Office to determine if a modification is required to aircraft parking plans, taxi 
routes, and other support facilities (e.g., pavement and infrastructure additions, waivers).  
(T-2).  
3.9.  Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) Verification.  The AOF/CC identifies a single Airfield 
Operations facility, in writing, as the NOTAM monitor facility.  The NOTAM monitor facility 
coordinates with AM to ensure appropriate NOTAMs are sent to facilitate airfield operations.   
3.10.  Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operations.  Specific procedures for local UAS 
operations must be published in the Airfield Operations Instruction (AOI) and any other 
appropriate LOPs. (T-2).  Address the procedures listed, proposal, as well as site-specific 
procedures/data, NOTAM requirements, emergency recall of airspace or required landing of 
UAS, altitude caps, and other issues specific to base flying operations.  For AM and ATC UAS 
procedures see AFMANs 13-204 Volumes 2 and 3 respectively.  The SAA is the approval 
authority for UAS airfield operations. 
3.10.1.  The safety of manned aircraft will take precedence over unmanned aircraft in an 
emergency situation. 
3.10.2.  DoD UAS Categories (Groups 1 – 5) are defined in AFMAN 11-502, Small 
Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Attachment 2.  To the maximum extent possible, Airfield 
Operations personnel will handle Group 4 and 5 UAS operations in the same manner as 
manned flights.  (T-3).  Group 1, 2, and 3 UAS will generally have segregated airspace 
assigned to operate in that does not conflict with the normal flow of air and ground traffic.  
(T-2).  
3.10.3.  UAS Pilot/Operator Airfield Operations Familiarization.  When providing local 
Airfield Operations orientation training to UAS pilots/operators, consider the UAS 
pilot/operator qualifications when deciding on the length of training required.  NOTE:  
Group 4 and 5 UAS pilots/operators will generally be rated pilots and have a greater 
understanding of Airfield Operations procedures compared to Group 1, 2, and 3 UAS 
pilots/operators. 
3.10.4.  Locations that support UAS operations must publish a FLIP advisory to that effect. 
NOTE:  Example FLIP entry – “Use extreme caution for extensive UAS ops in the vicinity.”  
(T-2).  
3.10.5.  Airfield Markings and Signage.  All changes to airfield signage/markings along 
established UAS taxi routes will be coordinated with UAS units prior to implementation.  (T-
2).  
3.10.6.  Flight Planning.  A flight plan will be filed for UAS flights, as applicable.  (T-3).  
NOTE: UAS designations in the “Aircraft Type” section of DD 1801, International Flight 
Plan are not recognized by the Air Route Traffic Control (ARTCC) host computer.  
Therefore, include the UAS designation in the remarks section of all IFR flight plans.  For 
additional guidance, see the DoD Flight Information Publication, General Planning Guide 
available for download at National Geospatial Intelligence Agency website.

UAS, AOF/CC will include procedures in the AOI.  (T-2).  AOF/CC will accomplish the 
following: 
3.10.7.1.  Notify MAJCOM OPR for Airfield Operations if contacted to be an Emergency 
Divert Base.  (T-1). 
3.10.7.2.  Include procedures to notify the respective command post of any/all changes in 
airfield status.  (T-1).  
3.10.7.3.  Include towing procedures and coordination.  (T-2).  
3.10.8.  UAS pilots/operators will pre-coordinate all UAS missions with Airfield Operations 
unless addressed in an LOP.  (T-3).  UAS mission commanders, pilots, or SOFs will advise 
ATC of initiation and completion of flight operations.  (T-3).  
3.10.9.  Contingency Operations.  Establish procedures in accordance with published Special 
Instructions (SPINs).  (T-3).  NOTE:  A crash grid map should be used to develop flight 
sectors for UASs.  However, until a crash grid map is available, utilize the best data available 
for the contingency location. Additionally, traditional approach/departure corridors may not 
be used in a tactical environment. 
3.11.  Interruptions to ATCALS.  The AOF/CC ensures ATCALS are available to support the 
flying mission.  Maintenance personnel response times/actions and preventative maintenance 
schedule (PM) must be established in a LOP.  (T-3).  AM submits the base PM schedule for 
inclusion in the FLIPs.  The AOF/CC establishes procedures for reporting and coordinating 
ATCALS interruptions and malfunctions in a LOP.  NOTE:  Historical data shows that 
ATCALS performance can degrade over time in ways not detectable by normal preventive 
maintenance.  Units should advise their MAJCOM of system or operational deficiencies beyond 
local resolution to receive assistance from their regional maintenance center (RMC).  The 
ARTCCs provide remote maintenance functions, maintenance assistance, training, and 
engineering-level guidance.  Additionally they conduct special and commissioning system 
evaluations to determine the optimum system configuration (based on equipment capabilities, 
site limitations, mission requirements and environmental conditions).  AOF/CC will accomplish 
the following: 
3.11.1.  Obtain OG/CC approval for ATCALS downtime outside of the published PMI 
schedule.  Notify the AFM for appropriate NOTAM/airfield advisory action.  (T-3). 
Schedule no more than one ATCALS facility for maintenance at a time.  Exception:  
Multiple Instrument Landing System (ILS) facilities installed at opposite ends of the same 
runway. 
3.11.1.1.  Coordinate with the appropriate ARTCC, Terminal Radar Approach Control, 
and Flight Service Station when an ATCALS component is part of the NAS and verify 
appropriate NOTAM action is taken.  (T-2). 
3.11.1.2.  At multiple base complexes, coordinate PMI schedules so all bases do not 
remove similar ATCALS from service at the same time.  (T-3). 
3.11.1.3.  Request planned maintenance shutdown of ATCALS during periods of least 
activity, including nighttime, as much as possible.  (T-3).

Chapter 4 
AIRFIELD OPERATIONS FLIGHT MANAGEMENT AND PROGRAMS 
4.1.  Local Operating Procedures (LOPs).  AOF/CC must ensure all regulatory guidance 
describing local Airfield Operations services are published in a Letter of Agreement (LOA), 
Operations Letter (OL), flight or facility Operating Instruction (OI) or Operations Plan 
(OPLAN).  (T-2).  AOF/CC must ensure changes to existing LOAs, MOUs, and facility OIs are 
converted to or integrated into the applicable LOP within 180 calendar days after the date of the 
memorandum.  (T-3).  
4.1.1.  Approval Authority and Functional Review.  The level of signature depends on the 
type of LOP being written or negotiated.  The senior operations commander (normally the 
OG/CC) for the signatory agencies approves and signs for their organization. 
4.1.1.1.  MAJCOM OPR for Airfield Operations is a mandatory coordinator on LOPs 
(i.e. LOA, OI, OL, AOI) outlined in this chapter prior to implementation.  NOTE:  
MAJCOMs should identify timelines and determine which LOP reviews are optional in a 
supplement to this manual. 
4.1.1.2.  LOPs that address Airfield Operations services, training, and/or operations with 
host nation agencies must be coordinated through the MAJCOM OPR for Airfield 
Operations prior to implementation.  This review ensures LOPs are in compliance with 
federal, Air Force, MAJCOM, and host nation policies.  NOTE: Affected MAJCOMs 
must establish how this process will be conducted in the supplement to this manual.  
Additional guidance is provided in AFI 51-403, International Agreements.   
4.1.2.  Standard LOPs. 
4.1.2.1.  Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).  Refer to AFI 13-213 for additional 
information. 
4.1.2.2.  Airfield Operations Instruction (AOI).  The AOI provides guidance regarding 
airfield and terminal environment activities which directly affect flying operations.  It is 
the primary source document for describing local ATC, airfield, and flying operations 
applicable to base assigned aircrews, such as Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and radar traffic 
patterns, In-Flight Emergency response procedures and local aircraft priorities.  Guidance 
on format and content of AOIs is provided in Attachment 2.  The senior operations 
commander serves as the approval authority for the AOI.  NOTE:  MDS-specific 
instructions may direct information required in the AOI to also be published in a local 11-
series instruction.  AOF/CCs must work with flying standardization and evaluation 
offices to minimize duplication and ensure published procedures do not conflict.  (T-2).    
 
 
26 
AFMAN13-204V1  22 JULY 2020 
4.1.2.3.  Training OI  .  Training OI is developed to establish policy and procedures for 
implementing and defining AM, ATC and RAWS training program responsibilities.  The 
training OI must expand those areas where further explanation is required and standardize 
local training procedures.  (T-3).  Each unit must develop, implement, and administer 
each program in accordance with this manual and AFI 36-2670.  (T-3).  NOTE:  Units 
may develop a consolidated training OI.  The training OI should not restate training 
requirements, procedures, or responsibilities already published.  Additional requirements 
for the training OI can be found in AFMAN 13-204 Volumes 2 – 4. 
4.1.2.4.  LOAs.  LOAs are established between Air Force units or agencies on a 
particular base and a non-Air Force agency from the base or any unit or agency from 
another location.  Routinely, LOAs are established between a supported wing and an 
FAA Terminal Radar Approach Control or FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center 
(ARTCC).  LOAs with the FAA should be coordinated with the Air Traffic representative 
assigned as liaison with the Air Force facilities involved and when applicable at the 
Service Area office.  The AOF/CC is the approval authority for LOAs between Airfield 
Operations facilities; the unit commander (normally OSS/CC) is the approval authority 
for LOAs between Airfield Operations facilities and other base agencies; and the 
appropriate WG/CC (delegable to the senior operations commander) is the approval 
authority for LOAs between Air Force and non-Air Force agencies. 
4.1.2.5.  OPLANs.  OPLANs provide guidance for contingency/wartime operations.  
When applicable, Airfield Operations tasks are addressed in the OPLAN annex. 
Guidance on format and content of OPLANs is contained in AFI 10-401, Air Force 
Operations Planning and Execution.  OPLANs are normally managed by the Wing Plans 
Office though the AOF may be appointed as the OPR for certain OPLANs pertaining to 
airfield operations, e.g. snow removal or stop alert plan.  The AOF/CC should review all 
OPLANs for Airfield Operations tasks and prepare a plans brief that includes all Airfield 
Operations tasks in that OPLAN.  The WG/CC is the approval authority for OPLANS 
4.1.2.6.  Operations Letters.  Operations letters are established between Airfield 
Operations facilities or between an Airfield Operations facility and another base agency 
to supplement operational or procedural instructions and to standardize operations.  
Operations letters describe special operating conditions or Airfield Operations procedures 
that are unique to certain locations.  The AOF/CC shall ensure operations letters are 
established covering tower/radar coordination procedures and RAWS restoral and 
maintenance procedures. (T-3).  The AOF/CC is the approval authority for operations 
letters between Airfield Operations facilities; the unit commander (normally OSS/CC) is 
the approval authority for operations letters between Airfield Operations facilities and 
other base agencies; and the appropriate WG/CC (delegable to the senior operations 
commander) is the approval authority between Air Force and non-Air Force agencies. 
4.1.2.7.  Operating Instructions  (OIs).  OIs are considered as a directive publication 
and must comply with AFI 33-360 publication requirements (i.e. legal review, certifying 
official, approving official, and the statement “COMPLIANCE WITH THIS 
PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY”).  (T-1).

mission, the AOF/CC should consider the following recommendations to mitigate its impact 
after discussing with squadron and senior leadership (OG/CC or WG/CC). 
4.4.1.  Return medically qualified personnel assigned to other base/organizational duties 
(such as first sergeant or chief enlisted manager) to Airfield Operations facilities.   
4.4.2.  Curtail all additional duties, e.g. unit/organizational additional duties.   
4.4.3.  Exempt personnel from local exercise taskings not involving Airfield Operations 
services, e.g. facility evacuations, facility security guards, and damage assessment.   
4.4.4.  During known periods of low traffic density, combine ATC positions to reduce the 
number of controllers on shifts to afford adequate controller staffing during peak flying 
periods.   
4.4.5.  During periods of low flying activity, pursue a waiver to the AM shift-staffing 
requirement. 
4.4.6.  Use a senior controller concept where possible for all ATC facilities during periods of 
non-peak flying. 
4.4.7.  Reduce ATC staffing to one Watch Supervisor (WS)/Senior Controller (SC) per shift 
unless a variance requires more. 
4.4.8.  Extend the ATC duty day to 10-hour shifts; or use six-one duty day rotation schedule; 
or reduce the Wing flying schedule, commensurate with available ATC staffing.  Also, use 
either and extended AM duty day to 12-hour shifts; or use a six-one duty day rotation 
schedule.  NOTE:  To facilitate shift rotations and crew rest requirements, this activity 
should be forecasted at least 2 weeks in advance. 
4.4.9.  Utilize dual-certified personnel from other facilities, the facility chief controller, and 
all other personnel who hold certifications to work in the affected facility.

aircraft mishap, RAWS maintenance must be notified to record/document equipment 
performance and alignments.  NOTE:  Adjustments must not be made to ATCALS 
equipment during this inspection.  (T-1).  
4.6.5.1.  Radar equipment performance checks must include scope, cursor, and map 
alignment.  NOTE:  Not applicable to DTAS sites (i.e. STARS).  (T-1).  
4.6.5.2.  RAWS/RMC maintenance must perform an immediate and comprehensive 
ground check of equipment that remains in operation.  (T-1).  Since RAWS maintenance 
can only validate signals at ground level, a local flyability check should also be 
conducted to ensure appropriate airborne signal reception.   
4.6.5.3.  If equipment performance remains suspect, The AOF/CC will only return the 
facility to service after a successful FAA flight  inspection.  (T-1).  Return the facility to 
service, when it is suspected of contributing to a mishap incident, only after a successful 
FAA flight inspection.   
4.6.6.  Establish procedures to ensure AOF personnel do not release the names of individuals 
allegedly involved in an aircraft incident or accident to agencies outside Air Force channels.  
Procedures should ensure personnel do not discuss the accident/incident beyond what is 
necessary to accomplish duties via the crash phone. All inquiries from non-mishap response 
personnel must be directed to Public Affairs.  (T-0).

Airfield Operations facilities.   
5.1.1.  Retain all voice recorder tapes/cassettes and data extraction disc recordings for 45 
calendar days, or in accordance with guidance in Air Force Records Information 
Management System, Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Table 13-06, Rule 02.00, 
whichever is greater.  (T-2). 
5.1.2.  At facilities where the ATC automation system has the ability to record operations on 
the system, retain all electronically recorded media (e.g., Continuous Data Recording (CDR), 
Digital Audio Tapes (DAT), Digital Audio Legal Recorder (DALR) for 45 calendar days, or 
in accordance with guidance in AFRIMS, Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Table 
13-06, Rule 02.00, whichever is greater.  (T-2). 
5.1.3.  CDR data playback/data analysis tools may be used in the investigation of an incident, 
suspected separation loss, pilot deviation, controller error, TCAS event, miscellaneous 
incident, or accident. 
5.1.3.1.  CDR data reductions are time-consuming activities; therefore, their retrieval 
should be limited to those times deemed absolutely necessary, as determined by the 
AOF/CC. 
5.1.3.2.  Copies of CDR data analyses, playbacks/files, and playback software are 
releasable, but only at the discretion of the AOF/CC. 
5.1.3.3.  Playback release procedures. For multiple sensor systems, identify the sensor in 
use or filter all but the primary sensor in use. In addition, identify and/or provide an 
electronic copy of the radar map(s) most likely in use during the event. 
5.2.  Retaining Mishap Records. 
5.2.1.  AOF/CCs file and maintain official copies of written and recorded records pertinent to 
an alleged flying deviation, Military Flying Deviation or Hazardous Air Traffic Reports 
(HATRs) for six months.  File and maintain copies of written and recorded records about 
aircraft mishaps or accidents for two years, or on deactivation of the unit (if sooner), 
according to Air Force records disposition schedule (Table 91-5, rule 3) located in the 
AFRIMS.  This file may contain the originals or certified copies.  In addition, keep other data 
such as crew duty schedules, controller training records, AF Form 1042, Medical 
Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty/DD Form 2992 or applicable GS-
2152 medical clearance, medical waivers/profiles used in the investigation that the 
government might require for use in civil litigation.  This file should contain only factual data 
that is generated in the ordinary course of business; it should not contain un-sworn controller 
statements, summaries of events, opinions and recommendations, or privileged safety 
information.   
 
 
AFMAN13-204V1  22 JULY 2020 
35 
5.2.2.  CDR data of automated radar systems may be used in the investigation of reported 
incidents believed to be operational errors/deviations to determine the amount of separation 
that existed or position of the aircraft.  CDR data may not be used as the primary source for 
reporting an incident or commencing an investigation.  When CDR data is used in this 
capacity, the automated system clock shall be verified as being accurate at the time of the 
incident.  (T-0).  NOTE:  Protect CDR media, CDR hard-copy printouts and all other 
recorded records of aircraft mishaps, alleged deviations or HATR to the degree necessary to 
prevent unauthorized access. Locked receptacles (file cabinets, desks or safes) are adequate 
for storing this material.   
5.3.  Releasing Aircraft Mishap/Incident Related Information.  Persons conducting official 
safety investigations have access to all factual and non-factual information pertinent to an 
aircraft mishap.  These individuals may interview or request statements/testimony from 
personnel who were controlling air traffic at the time of the mishap or who observed the mishap 
incident.  These interviews, statements and testimony are not protected from public release in all 
cases.  See AFI 91-204, Chapters 4 and 6 for the types of investigation associated with aircraft 
mishaps and protected information. 
5.3.1.  AFI 91-204 and AFMAN 91-223 govern the SIB process.  The SIB is chartered to 
find causal factors and mishap prevention. 
5.3.1.1.  The SIB produces a two-part report.  Part I of the report contains non-privileged 
factual information that may be disclosed outside the Air Force in accordance with the 
Freedom of Information Act.  If requested and available, CDR data may be included in 
Part I, Tab M. Transcripts of recorded air-to-ground and aircraft-to-aircraft 
communications are included in Part I, Tab N. Part II contains the privileged 
information that will not be disclosed. Investigation, Analysis, Findings, and 
Recommendations; Statements and Testimony of Witnesses and Persons Involved; and 
Statements of Persons Cited in Finding (respectively) are included in Part II, Tabs T, U, 
and V. Refer to the Freedom of Information Act Program—DoD Manual 
5400.07_AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program for additional 
information. 
5.3.1.2.  Distribution of privileged reports is restricted to those with a need to know and 
must be protected for inter-base email transmission.  Refer to AFI 91-204, Chapter 3, for 
guidance on protecting privileged information.   
5.3.1.3.  Privileged information contained in Part II of the SIB report may not be used as 
evidence for punitive, disciplinary or adverse administrative actions, for determining the 
misconduct or line-of-duty status of any person, in flying evaluation board hearings or 
reviews, to determine liability or liability in claims for or against the United States, or in 
any other manner in any action by or against the United States.  The intent of this 
protection is to encourage open communication without fear of retribution, in order to 
expedite the discovery of causal factors and prevent future incidents.

AFMAN13-204V1  22 JULY 2020 
5.3.2.  AFI 51-307, Aerospace and Ground Accident Investigations governs the accident 
investigation board process.  An AIB conducts legal investigations of Air Force aircraft 
accidents to prepare a publicly-releasable report and to gather and preserve evidence for use 
in litigation, claims, disciplinary actions and administrative proceedings. AIB investigators 
have access to all non-privileged testimony and evidence (factual data) pertaining to the 
accident including evidence contained in Part I of the formal SIB report. 
5.3.2.1.  The AIB investigators are provided with a list of witnesses interviewed by the 
SIB.  The AIB may interview controllers (including SIB witnesses) and obtain controller 
statements or testimony.  SIB witnesses can only be interviewed by the AIB after they 
have been released by the SIB president. 
5.3.2.2.  AIB investigators can not have access to privileged testimony or statements 
provided to the SIB and contained in Part II of the formal SIB report.  Statements and 
testimony made during AIB investigations may be releasable to the public.  Controllers 
may seek legal counsel before making statements or providing testimony to the AIB. 
5.3.3.  FAA, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and Air Force investigators have 
access to factual records pertinent to an alleged violation of flying regulations.  Requests for 
specific information should be routed through military commanders.  These investigators 
may request controller statements or testimony.  Controller statements and testimony made 
during this type of investigation are releasable to the public.  Controllers may seek legal 
counsel before making statements or testimony to accident investigators.  Do not release 
names of individuals involved without the specific approval of AF/A3.  (T-0).  
5.3.4.  The Department of the Air Force discloses its records to the public, unless these 
records are exempt from public disclosure.  DoD Manual 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302, outlines 
procedures for disclosure of records and lists specific exemptions for withholding records.  
Process any non-governmental request that cites the FOIA through the Wing or base FOIA 
office.  (T-0).  
5.3.5.  All requests for release of safety information from foreign governments or their 
representatives, including host nation mishap investigation teams, should be referred to the 
Air Force Safety Center for staffing. 
5.4.  Removing Original Records.  With the exception of official safety investigations, do not 
release recorded or written records concerning mishaps without authority from the OG/CC (or 
designated representative/equivalent).  Requests for safety investigations must be made to Wing 
Safety.  Due to the potential for recording over or deleting original recordings, original recorded 
records shall be retained in the AOF files and a certified transcript or certified tape copy will be 
released to appropriate authorities.  (T-2).  Release transcripts/voice recordings “FOR 
OFFICIAL USE ONLY” to a recognized investigation authority.  To ensure custodial control, 
written and recorded records should not be released to an intermediary collection agency that is 
not a member of the investigation board.  If the original recording is released, keep a copy of the 
original recording with the custodian.  NOTE:  In accordance with FAA guidance, a DAT 
recording derived from the hard drive of the Digital Voice Recorder System is certified as an 
original recording.   
 
 
AFMAN13-204V1  22 JULY 2020 
37 
5.4.1.  At joint-use RAPCONs, where the Air Force has furnished recorder equipment, the 
FAA maintains custodial control of recordings.  If the Air Force requires access to a tape of 
one of its positions in the facility, the FAA plays back the recording.  If the mishap involves 
an FAA controller, the FAA provides a copy of the original voice recording for the use of 
investigators. 
5.4.2.  If there is a need for a transcript or an additional tape copy, make it from the original 
recording. Only two certified re-recordings of the original DAT recording should be made. 
Any additional re-recordings should be made from a certified copy of the original.  When 
making a tape copy include all transmissions from initial call-up to at least 5 minutes after 
last contact.  Use a speaker-to-microphone method to copy when the equipment will not 
electronically connect.  Preface the reproduction with “I certify this to be a true and exact 
(copy or transcript) of the original recording on file at this office at (base name)” (Name and 
Grade); (Title). Also include the date and time of reproduction, the name of the person 
supervising the reproduction and a certification that the reproduction is a true copy of the 
original recording.   
5.4.3.  The data extraction recordings of automated radar systems to a computer extraction 
disc are normally useless to a requesting party unless reduced to a printed hard-copy form.  
Therefore, when filling a request for computer data, the disc will be reduced to printed form 
unless the requesting party specifically requests the recorded data extraction.  After a 
successful reduction to printed form, the disc may be returned to service through the normal 
rotation cycle unless a specific request is received to retain the disc in its entirety.  The 
following disclaimer will be attached to any computer reproduction: “THIS DOCUMENT IS 
DERIVED 
FROM 
COMPUTER 
MAGNETIC 
RECORDINGS 
OF 
INTERNAL 
COMPUTER PROCESSING. IT IS NOT AN EXACT REPRESENTATION OF THE 
CONTROL POSITION DISPLAY.”  The printout data is considered an official record and 
shall be retained as part of the records identified in paragraph 5.2.1.1  (T-3).  
5.5.  How To Prepare Transcripts. 
5.5.1.  Include the following in the heading of the written transcript: 
5.5.1.1.  Subject. 
5.5.1.2.  Identity of the recording facility. 
5.5.1.3.  List of facilities and controller positions, and the abbreviation for each.

5.5.2.  Abbreviate each facility in the transcript by using the location designator, followed by 
the facility and control position.  Identify aircraft by an abbreviated call sign if confusion will 
not result.  Precede each transmission with the time the transmission began and identity of 
the transmitting source. When the source is unknown, use UNK.  Single-space the body of 
the transcription.  Double-space between each transmission.  Show unintelligible 
transmissions by a series of asterisks.  At the end of the transcript, center the statement, 
“END OF TRANSCRIPT”. 
5.5.3.  Certify copies of written records or tape transcripts as follows: "I certify this to be a

Chapter 8 
PROCEDURES FOR ESTABLISHING VFR FLYING AREAS AND TRAFFIC 
PATTERNS 
8.1.  VFR Traffic Patterns. 
8.1.1.  When designing traffic patterns, units must ensure the following: 
8.1.1.1.  They conform to the requirements of paragraphs 8.2 and 8.3 below except 
when safety or noise problems require adjustments.  (T-2).  
8.1.1.2.  No unusual or unnecessary maneuvering is required. (T-2).  
8.1.2.  When traffic patterns for two or more airfields are close together or overlap, units 
must coordinate LOAs regarding safe operations.  (T-2).  
8.1.3.  Units must coordinate revised traffic patterns with ATC agencies and the MAJCOM 
OPR for ATC.  (T-2).  
8.2.  VFR Traffic Pattern Types.  Units must:  
8.2.1.  Establish rectangular and overhead patterns at each Air Force airfield, joint-use 
airfield and overseas airfield controlled by the Air Force, as applicable to mission needs.  (T-
2).  Use LOAs to provide the desired traffic pattern at airfields under the control of foreign 
governments or agencies other than the Air Force.  (T-3). 
8.2.2.  Develop closed traffic procedures.  (T-2).  Closed traffic is a maneuver that allows an 
aircraft making successive patterns to stay in the normal traffic flow without exiting and 
reentering the pattern.   
8.2.3.  Bases may establish an additional rectangular pattern for light aircraft. This pattern 
provides adequate separation from normal rectangular and overhead pattern traffic.   
8.2.4.  Establish separate helicopter patterns.  (T-2).  These patterns are not necessary if the 
rectangular or light aircraft patterns meet operational needs without creating congestion.   
8.3.  VFR Traffic Pattern Altitudes.  Units must establish traffic pattern altitudes by rounding 
to the nearest 100-foot increment relative to the published field elevation.  (T-2).  Pattern 
altitudes must provide a minimum of 300-feet of obstruction clearance and must be established a 
minimum of 500 feet above ground level after rounding is applied.  (T-2).  For example, the 
traffic pattern altitude for a 1,000-foot traffic pattern with a published field elevation of 250 feet 
would be established at 1,300 feet above mean sea level (MSL), assuming a 1,300 foot MSL 
altitude would provide at least 300 feet of obstruction clearance.  It is recommended that units 
establish traffic pattern altitudes based on the following:  NOTE:  The traffic pattern airspace 
criteria depicted in FAAO JO 7400.2, Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters and JO 
7400.11, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, should be used to determine the area to be 
evaluated for obstacle clearance and pattern confines. 
8.3.1.  Rectangular pattern: 1,000 feet above highest field elevation (1,500 feet if a lower 
altitude causes a noise problem). 
 
 
44 
AFMAN13-204V1  22 JULY 2020 
8.3.2.  Overhead pattern: 1,500 feet above highest field elevation (2,000 feet if the 1,500 foot 
rectangular pattern is used or if a lower altitude causes a noise problem). 
8.3.3.  Light aircraft pattern: At least 500 feet above highest field elevation. In all cases, 
ensure adequate separation from normal rectangular pattern traffic. 
8.3.4.  Helicopter patterns: Establish specific altitudes that ensure adequate separation from 
traffic in other patterns. 
8.3.5.  Closed traffic:  Closed traffic operations: Normally conducted at an altitude 
corresponding to the applicable airframe’s pattern. 
8.4.  Environmental Impact Analysis and Air Installation Compatible Use Zone 
(AICUZ).  Before making changes to local VFR flying areas, VFR traffic patterns or altitudes, 
analyze proposals for impact based on the published AICUZ study and potential environmental

AIR FORCE RUNWAY SAFETY ACTION TEAM (AFRSAT) 
9.1.  Program Objectives.  AFRSATs provide an objective perspective on runway safety issues 
such as runway incursions/excursions to reduce negative trends or unsafe conditions identified 
through trend and analysis, mishap reports, HATR, or hazard reports. AFRSAT visits may be 
directed by HAF or MAJCOM, or may be requested by individual units. 
9.2.  Program Scope.  AFRSATs are used to analyze, report and determine corrective actions 
for Airfield Operations and support agencies for safety, compatibility and adequacy related to 
runway safety. AFRSAT functional experts evaluate all pertinent areas that are a part of, or 
affect, the negative trend or unsafe condition.  This program may also be used as a mechanism to 
conduct a site visit for other negative safety incidents or trends that involve airfield operations.  
Areas include but are not limited to: Near Midair Collision, Hazardous Air Traffic Reports, and 
Airman Safety Action Program. 
9.2.1.  Team Composition.  Team composition is based on the area(s) being evaluated. 
9.2.2.  Qualifications.  Individuals’ qualifications (i.e. Special Experience Identifier [SEI] or 
duty position) should be equivalent or one duty position higher of the area(s) being 
evaluated. 
9.2.3.  Scheduling AFRSAT Visits. 
9.2.3.1.  MAJCOM OPR for Airfield Operations schedule AFRSAT visits based on 
results of data analysis identifying negative trends or unsafe conditions at locations under 
their oversight.  Notify units a minimum of 45 calendar days prior to AFRSAT visits.  
Schedule changes will be provided as they occur. 
9.2.3.2.  Wing/CC may request AFRSAT visit at any time; however, a minimum of 45 
calendar days is needed to schedule the AFRSAT. 
9.2.3.3.  In preparation for the AFRSAT visit, the team lead will obtain all applicable 
documents from the unit being evaluated a minimum of 15 calendar days prior to the 
visit.  In addition, all data (MISHAP/Accident/CMAV reports) pertaining to the 
AFRSAT visit will be analyzed and evaluated for trends. 
9.2.3.4.  Prior to the AFRSAT departing, normally the team lead will hold a preliminary 
meeting with team members to discuss the AFRSAT visit and the strategy for the event. 
9.2.3.5.  The AFRSAT will include an in-brief and out-brief to the Wing/CV or their 
designated representative.  Members in attendance should include Airfield Operations 
(AOF/CC, Tower CCTLR, AFM) flight/ground safety, radio maintenance, flying unit 
representatives, and individual units as applicable. 
9.2.4.  Evaluation.  The AFRSAT will use the applicable checklist developed by AFFSA 
found on the AFFSA Airfield Operations SharePoint. 
9.2.5.  Plan.  The AFRSAT will help the unit develop a plan to correct the negative trend or 
unsafe condition within 15 calendar days of the visit.  The plan will include:

condition, as applicable. 
9.2.5.4.  A listing of problem areas and/or contributing causes to the individual events 
leading to the negative trend/unsafe condition. Each problem area discovered will include 
a recommendation to correct the problem. 
9.2.5.5.  The designated unit within the wing who is responsible for tracking and 
monitoring the action items and for providing a status update to MAJCOM OPR for 
Airfield Operations every 90 calendar days or as requested. 
9.2.5.6.  The plan will be properly designated:  “For Official Use Only.” 
9.2.5.7.  MAJCOM OPR for Airfield Operations will forward the plan to AFFSA within 
30 calendar days of completion of the AFRSAT’s visit. 
9.2.6.  MAJCOM OPR for Airfield Operations will conduct follow-up within 6 months after 
the AFRSAT visit.  A follow-up at a minimum will include a table-top review 
(teleconference) to discuss the status of all action items. If necessary, another site visit will 
be conducted. The table-top review will be documented and the results published to all 
attendees.

Senior Operations Commander—The senior group commander (or equivalent) responsible for 
Airfield Operations. 
Shared Use—An airfield used by both civil and military flight activities that are located at a 
civil airport under control of civil authorities. 
Skill Level—The level of qualification within an awarded Air Force specialty, shown by the 
fourth digit of the Air Force Specialty Code. 
Specialty Experience Identifier (SEI)—A three-character code that identifies special 
experience training identified in the personnel data system. Specialty Experience Identifiers may 
permit rapid identification of individuals with special qualifications to meet peacetime 
assignments.  They provide a means for identifying critical manning requirements during 
wartime or contingency operations when little lead time is available for training personnel in 
specific technical skills. 
Stop Training—When a trainee is unable to accomplish knowledge based (including classroom 
instruction), simulator (including static scenarios), and OJT due to unforeseen events or inability 
to meet standards. 
Supervisor of Flying (SOF)—A rated officer authorized by the flying unit commander to 
monitor and supervise current flight operations.  A Supervisor of Flying may perform duties 
from the control tower. 
Task—A unit of work activity or operation that forms a significant part of a duty.  A task usually 
has clear beginning and ending points and directly observable or measurable processes, 
frequently but not always resulting in a product that can be evaluated for quantity, quality or 
fitness in the work environment.  A task is performed for its own sake; that is, it is not dependent 
upon other tasks, although it may fall in a sequence with other tasks in a duty or job array.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (When filled) 
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE 
RUNWAY SAFETY ACTION TEAM REPORT 
Blank AFB, 27-31 July 2010 
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (When filled) 
Section I - Executive Summary 
Purpose and Scope: 
This AFRSAT visit was initiated as a result of Blank AFB having the third highest number of 
runway incursions in 2009. It included: an evaluation of management of the airfield driving 
program; air traffic and flight procedures; airfield infrastructure, Squadron Airfield Driving 
Program Manager (ADPM) and Wing Safety.  This report includes recommendations proposed 
to the Wing/CC to help reduce the number of runway incursions.  
Overview:  Blank AFB has adequate procedures in place to promote runway safety.  All units 
and agencies interviewed displayed a high level of experience and knowledge of the runway 
incursion problem.  Personnel expressed significant interest in reducing the number of runway 
incursions, and welcomed any inputs by the team.  Blank AFB is a 24/7 airfield, averaging 
more than 55K runway operations per a year.  There are multiple types of aircraft missions; 
helicopter operations, unmanned aircraft, fighter and mobility operations. Assigned aircraft 
include C-130s, and B-1s.  
Wing Leadership:  The Wing leadership is keenly aware of their runway incursion trend and 
have aggressively implemented several measures that have already shown progress in reducing 
the number of runway incursions. The following actions have been taken:  
1.  Installed runway guard lights at taxiway Hotel at Runway 36 and repainted airfield 
markings  
2.  Created a Runway Incursion Board to evaluate runway incursions and make 
recommendations for improvements.  
3.  Initiated project to build perimeter road around the approach end of Runway 24.  
 
AFMAN13-204V1  22 JULY 2020 
71 
Airfield Configuration:  Blank AFB has three runways: runways 18R/36L, 18L/36R and 
6/24. Runway 6/24 is the primary instrument runway.  Runway 6 and 36L cross each other at 
their approach end.  Aircraft must taxi across runway 36L on taxiway Hotel to get to the 
approach end of Runway 6 and normally taxi down Runway 6 to takeoff the full length of 
runway 36L.  This particular intersection (36L & Hotel) contributed to 45% of all runways.  
Another ― “Hot Spot” for runway incursions is access to the Army Ramp on the South side of 
the airfield.  For vehicles to get to where the Army helicopters are parked, drivers must cross 
the approach end of Runway 24.  This runway crossing contributed to 45% of all runway 
incursions.  See airfield diagram, Attachment 1.  
Air Traffic Control:  The control tower provides excellent view of all runways.  The height 
of the Control Tower, and its location from the runways are adequate. An almost constant flow 
of aircraft and vehicular traffic emphasize the need for positive control and keen situational 
awareness by the controllers.  Controllers received additional training on Controlled 
Movement Area Violations (CMAV)/Runway Incursions, and incorporated a ― “Lessons 
Learned” document for all controllers to review in the facilities Recent Information File.  
Controllers are keenly aware of the runway incursion potential and pay particular attention to 
runway crossing procedures to ensure the safety of operations while meeting the flying 
mission requirements.  
Airfield Management:  Airfield Management is effectively managing the Airfield Driving 
Training Program and airfield safety.  The airfield manager and deputy airfield manager have 
taken positive steps to improve training of airfield drivers and improve airfield markings and 
signs.  Runway incursions are briefed at the airfield operations board.  The Wing’s Airfield 
Driving Program is extremely large and challenging with 40 units.  Currently, airfield 
management tests all airfield drivers.  On average more than 200 personnel are tested each 
month.  There were several areas discovered should be improved on the airfield to include 
airfield markings and signs.  The Airfield Driving Training Program was adequate, however 
several changes are recommended to improve the overall management of the program and the 
training of airfield drivers.  
Airfield Driving Program Managers:  The team evaluated 20 unit airfield driving training 
programs and found that 20% were not managing their program in accordance with local 
guidance.  More than 50 drivers were checked for AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency 
and several drivers were discovered did not have them.  The units ADPMs were notified and 
an investigation into those organizations found several problems with personnel in-processing, 
lack of supervision involvement and program management.  
Section II – Trend Analysis  
A thorough analysis was conducted of all CMAVs and Hazardous Air Traffic Reports 
(HATRs) runway incursions that occurred over the past five years.  See Figure A6.1.  In 2009, 
Blank AFB had a 9% increase in the number of runway incursions from 2008. Thus far in 
2010, there have already been 12 runway incursions with five months left in this year.

AFMAN13-204V1  22 JULY 2020 
Figure A6.1.  Blank AFB Runway Incursion Trends. 
 
A6.1.  Historically:  The months of June, September, and November are peak months for 
runway incursions.  These time frames appear to be high traffic periods due to scheduled 
exercises and the influx of new and inexperienced airfield drivers significantly contributes to the 
increase in incursions.  See Figure A6.2  
Figure A6.2.  Runway Incursions by Month. 
 
A6.2.  Similar to Air Force trend data:  Aircraft Maintenance, Security Forces and Civil 
Engineering have committed the most runway incursions on the airfield (54%).  These 
organizations have the majority of the airfield drivers and due to the airfield layout are required 
to cross the runways at several locations to perform their duties.  There are currently no 
specialized briefings or training provided to these high risk AFSCs.  See Figure A6.3

Table A6.2.  Problems and Recommendations. 
Section III - Problems and Recommendations  
Airfield:  
1.  Problem:  Internal lighting for several runway hold position signs was inoperative for 
extended periods. Taxiway A1 is missing a runway hold sign.  Also, the runway hold sign is 
not collocated with the runway hold marking at several locations.  Work orders and NOTAMs 
are submitted to correct/mitigate these problems.  
Recommendation:  Immediately repair runway hold signs.  Ensure a bench stock of 
replacement parts is available to repair frequent outages.  Install runway hold sign on taxiway 
A1.  Ensure a runway hold sign is installed adjacent to all runway hold lines.  
2. Problem:  Several runway hold line markings are faded, non-reflective or barely visible on 
taxiways leading to runway 18L/36R.  In addition, several old runway hold lines have been 
blacked out instead of being removed, thus leading to confusion on where the actual hold 
lines are located.  In accordance with AFMAN 32-1040, Civil Engineer Airfield 
Infrastructure Systems, runway hold lines cannot be blacked out, they must be removed.  
Recommendation:  As required, repaint new runway hold lines and markings for Runway 
18L/36R and other taxiways and aprons. Immediately contract or gain the capability to 
remove old runway hold lines. Consider power washing runway hold line markings that are 
barely visible due to dirt obscuring the marking.  
Air Traffic Control:  
3.  Problem:  Several phraseology errors were consistently noted. Specifically, phraseology 
pertaining to observed abnormalities and intra-facility coordination for runway crossings.  
Recommendation:  Increased training and facility management oversight is required to 
reduce and identify these coordination and phraseology errors. Ensure phraseology used is in 
accordance with FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapters 2-7, 9 and10.  
4.  Problem:  Construction floodlights create a glare in the Control Tower reducing visibility 
of controllers.  
Recommendation:  CE and Airfield Operations must ensure there is close coordination with 
the Control Tower before starting construction projects using floodlights for night operations.  
Airfield Management:

Recommendation:  Ensure these procedures are delineated in airfield construction contracts.  
6.  Problem:  There is limited use of local resources to educate/inform airfield users on 
runway incursion prevention.  
Recommendation:  Utilize local resources, base paper, bulletins, commander’s channel, 
locally developed posters/advertisements to provide updates, promote runway incursion 
prevention and lessons learned information to airfield drivers.  
Airfield Driving:  
7.  Problem:  Training criteria and procedures for issuing AF Form 483s are not included in 
the current airfield driving instruction.  
Recommendation:  Immediately rewrite the airfield driving instruction and ensure 
compliance with AFI 13-213.  
8.  Problem:  Not all airfield drivers are completing all local training required by local 
Airfield Driving Instruction or supplemental messages.  The Blank AFB Airfield Driving 
PowerPoint slide presentation and training video are not clearly delineated as required 
training item for all airfield drivers.  
Recommendation:  Immediately provide all official training material to ADPMs.  Ensure all 
training requirements are specifically identified in Blank AFB Airfield Driving Instruction, to 
include any local video training, PowerPoint slides. 
9.  Problem:  Not all vehicles operating in the Controlled Movement Area (CMA) have 
mobile radios installed in the vehicle.  
Recommendation:  To the maximum extent possible, require the installation of mobile 
radios in all vehicles that routinely operate in the CMAs. Use handheld radios as a backup.  
Ensure all personnel who operate a vehicle on the runway and CMA are trained on how to 
operate radios and effectively communicate with ATC.  
10.  Problem:  No checklists are being used to complete the day and night orientations or 
practical airfield drivers test.  
Recommendation:  Develop and utilize a checklist for airfield driver trainers to use when 
conducting the airfield driving orientations and practical driving test.  A checklist will ensure 
all airfield drivers are shown all required areas of the airfield and complete all required 
training during practical drivers test.
