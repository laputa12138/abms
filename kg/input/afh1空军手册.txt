Fellow Airmen,  
The United States Air Force exists to Fly, Fight, and Win. We assure our allies and deter our 
adversaries by delivering Airpower, anytime, anywhere. Today’s Airmen have answered our 
Nation’s call, and we stand ready to defend our homeland against all enemies foreign and 
domestic. We are the world’s most lethal flying force thanks to aviation pioneers and air-minded 
thinkers, backstopped by a professional and empowered enlisted corps. Air Force leaders at all 
levels require a firm understanding of our history and heritage. We need leaders at all levels, 
educated in the art of air war, now more than ever.  
This handbook provides the keys for our Airmen to be successful as teammates and leaders. 
We serve today in an incredibly complex global security environment. We remain steadfast in 
defending our homeland, paced by the growing multi-domain threat presented by the People’s 
Republic of China. We are also focused on strengthening our international partnerships while 
deterring aggression from challengers like Russia, North Korea, and violent extremist 
organizations around the World. We have been here before. You will read about leaders like Col 
Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. and the Tuskegee Airmen. You will learn about heroes like CMSgt 
Richard L. Etchberger and pioneers like Staff Sgt. Esther McGowin Blake, the first woman to 
enlist in the Air Force. You’ll gain an understanding of innovators who brought about the Doolittle 
Raid, the Atomic bomb, and our high-end mission rehearsal capability with the advent of Red 
Flag. These lessons remind us we can overcome difficult challenges like those we face today. To 
do so, we must be mission ready. 
Like those who came before us, we exemplify a courageous spirit, bound by a shared commitment 
to defend our great Nation. Today, Airmen are rising to meet challenges across contested domains 
through ingenuity, perseverance, teamwork, and above all—trust. We are part of a winning team, 
we are Airmen serving in the Profession of Arms, united by our core values and a shared sense of 
purpose. Lead well…Make Every Day Count.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
Direct references to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion concepts and nomenclature have been 
removed in accordance with Executive Order, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI 
Programs and Preferencing, 20 January 2025.  Handbook users are cautioned that second-order 
effects of this change (e.g., a revised Table 3.14) will be implemented in subsequent, more 
comprehensive revisions to this publication and some material herein may be outdated.   
AFH 1 has undergone significant revisions and requires a comprehensive review. Key changes 
include the relocation of the "Professionalism" chapter to Chapter 1 (formerly Chapter 24 in the 
2021 edition), resulting in a renumbering of all subsequent chapters, which remain in the same 
order. This updated edition also incorporates references to the Space Force, updates to 
DAFI/DAFMAN/DODI policy and references, new illustrations, organizational name changes, 
and revised web links throughout, ensuring accuracy and relevance in accordance with the latest

PREFACE 
Air Force Handbook 1, Airman (AFH 1) is designed to be a useful force development tool for 
every Airman in today’s Air Force. AFH 1 serves as a collection of references and resources 
pertaining to a wide range of subject areas in the profession of arms. Whether you choose to use 
the handbook as a quick reference, as a source for professional development, or you solely consider 
this material to be essential for enlisted promotion testing, you will find the material is current, 
relevant, and applicable to the Air Force objective of maintaining Global Vigilance, Global 
Reach, and Global Power for America.  Updates to cited DoD or Air Force policy documents or 
regulations (DAFI/DAFMAN/DODI, etc.) are controlling and must be followed until this 
handbook is updated to reflect the relevant changes.” 
The Enlisted Promotion Study Guides are developed directly from the contents of the handbook 
and include material that is specifically identified as testable for each level of enlisted promotion 
testing. Refer to the appropriate Enlisted Promotion Reference and Requirements Catalog 
(https://www.studyguides.af.mil/) for the applicable promotion cycle to ensure you study the 
correct information. 
Enlisted promotion tests are designed to reflect each applicable Airman’s knowledge. Group study 
for the purpose of enlisted promotion testing is strictly prohibited in accordance with (IAW) 
Department of the Air Force Manual (DAFMAN) 36-2664, Personnel Assessment Program. 
Enlisted personnel who violate these prohibitions are subject to prosecution under Article 92 of 
the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violating a lawful general regulation.

AIRMAN STUDY REFERENCES AND PREPARATION 
Airman Development and Testing Chart (ADTC) 
The Airman Development and Testing Chart (ADTC) is used by the Air Force to identify the 
relevance of AFH 1 testable content for the PFE as well as to determine subject matter content for 
inclusion in applicable enlisted promotion study guides. Testable content comprehension levels 
were determined by survey of all RegAF chief master sergeants. 
The primary purpose of the ADTC is to relate test content relevant to promotion with desired 
comprehension levels. It is the primary measurement to ensure enlisted promotion tests are 
developed to the required AF-level of knowledge for enlisted promotion to the next grade. 
The ADTC is an outline of the subject matter content in AFH 1. For promotion testing purposes, 
the level of comprehension necessary for each section is identified by rank using a scale of A 
through D. Enlisted Airmen should use the chart to identify the levels of comprehension of subject 
matter content for the enlisted promotion exam and development expectations associated with each 
rank. 
Scale

TIPS FOR STUDYING 
Start Early. Start your study preparation well in advance, ideally two months to a year before 
your promotion exam window. This strategic approach allows you to delve deeper into the study 
material. Such an in-depth engagement facilitates comprehension and opens avenues for practical 
application.  
Develop Your Study Regimen. Carve out a well-defined study routine that aligns with your daily 
life. Cultivate a mindset that establishes your promotion preparation as integral to your 
professional journey. Remain flexible in your study plan so you can accommodate unforeseen 
situations.  
Create Your Study Environment. Create a study environment that minimizes distractions and 
optimizes your concentration. Identify a quiet, clutter-free space where you can immerse yourself 
in the material without interruptions.  
Break it Down. Dissect your study material into manageable chunks. Break your study sessions 
into focused intervals with short breaks in between. Time management structures such as the 
Pomodoro Technique can enhance productivity and minimize mental fatigue.  
Active Learning. Engage actively with the material. Rather than passively reading, involve 
yourself in summarizing, discussing, or teaching the concepts to someone else. Active 
engagement fosters better understanding and retention.  
Variety is Key. Rotate between different subjects or topics within your study plan. This prevents 
monotony and keeps your mind engaged and curious.  
Healthy Body, Sharp Mind. Prioritize your physical well-being. A regular regimen of exercise, 
dieting, and sufficient sleep can boost your energy levels and enhance your cognitive abilities.  
Practice, Practice, Practice. Test yourself regularly with mock exams, quizzes, or practice 
questions. This simulates exam conditions and helps you gauge your progress while identifying 
areas that require more attention.  
Reflect and Adjust. Periodically evaluate your study plan’s effectiveness. Are you making steady 
progress? Are there aspects that could be improved?  Adjust your approach as needed.  
The journey to promotion success is not just about reaching the destination; it’s about the growth, 
development, and skill enhancement you acquire along the way.

ADULT LEARNING STYLE PROFILE 
Determine your most preferred learning style. The Adult Learning Style Profile, developed by Dr. 
Ray Barsch, emphasizes three learning styles: visual, auditory, and tactile/kinesthetic. 
Auditory learners use hearing to process information. When given a choice, strong auditory 
learners will sit where they can easily hear information and where there are minimal noise 
distractions. For auditory learners, it may be most helpful to use audio versions of material to 
supplement written text, when available. 
Visual learners use their eyes to process information. For visual learners, it may be most helpful 
to establish a study environment where you can clearly see the material. You may choose to 
enhance your study routine with notes, flashcards, or highlighters. 
Tactile learners learn while being active. Having access to a variety of study materials will enable 
tactile learners to take a more active approach to learning and maintain focus on the material. 
Tactile learners may find it beneficial to study while exercising. 
Whether your goal is to engage in lifelong learning, become a more adept Airman, or get promoted, 
take pride in knowing that your efforts to align your professional goals with your personal goals 
will help you develop a better understanding of the Air Force through the material provided in this 
handbook.

FOREWORD 
We stand united as America’s Airmen—a force of unparalleled strength, determination, and 
courage. Within the vast expanse of the heavens, we soar as guardians of freedom, defenders of 
our great nation. 
In the tapestry of history, our Air Force shines as a beacon of innovation, a testament to the 
visionaries who dared to dream of flight. Today, as we navigate the intricate web of a rapidly 
changing world, we carry their legacy forward. Our wings slice through the currents of 
uncertainty, propelled by strategic agility and the power of unity. 
PARAGRAPH DELETED. 
Joining the ranks of Airmen who came before us, we inherit a tradition of honor and a legacy of 
valor. Each echo of a jet’s roar, each flutter of a flag in the breeze, pays homage to those who 
devoted their lives to the service of our nation. It is their dedication that propels us to new heights, 
their unwavering spirit that fuels our resolve. 
We are the embodiment of the promise that America holds. When darkness looms, we are the 
light that pierces through, the hope that remains unshaken. From the cockpit to the control room, 
hangars to the command centers, we stand undeterred and unyielding. 
The Department of the Air Force finds itself in a time of major challenges—one marked by 
significant and dangerous shifts in the strategic environment. Although we are still the strongest 
Air Force and Space Force in the world, deterrence and operational success are at risk. The DAF 
must change to effectively deter in an era of Great Power Competition (GPC) and win in a conflict 
should deterrence fail. To confront our nation’s strategic pacing challenge, the People’s Republic 
of China (PRC) or an aggressive Russia, we are launching a major effort to reoptimize the DAF. 
Reoptimizing for GPC focuses on mission readiness by eliminating stovepipes to deliver cross-
functional and lethal combat capabilities with the speed and agility required to meet the challenges 
of this era, now and for the foreseeable future. Although conflict is not inevitable, we must move 
forward with a sense of urgency to ensure we are ready for GPC. We are out of time. 
So, let us rise to the occasion; let our wings carry us to the farthest reaches of possibility. Let our 
actions define the legacy we leave behind for the generations that will follow in our wake. As 
America’s Airmen, we fly with valor, fight with integrity, and win with unwavering resolve. We 
answer whenever and wherever our nation calls, for we are the guardians of freedom and justice, 
and our Air Force is, and forever will be, the greatest in the world.

1.1. Professionalism 
The dictionary defines a professional as one who “engages in something specific as their main 
occupation rather than a pastime.” Other adjectives used to describe a professional are 
“competent,” “assured,” and “skillful.” Professionalism describes who we are as a service and 
how we conduct ourselves as Airmen and representatives of the USAF. It sets the standards all 
Airmen are expected to adhere to—and exceed. Professionalism within the USAF is framed by 
the requirements of trust, loyalty, dignity, and personal commitment. We must be dependable and 
responsible for our own actions while being good wingmen for fellow Airmen and colleagues. At 
the root of professionalism is respect. Respect is what bonds every Airman’s contribution to the 
mission with the collective understanding of what it means to serve with humility and respect for 
those we serve with. 
The USAF is a Total Force that effectively leverages the unique capabilities of officer, enlisted, 
and civilian Airmen across RegAF, Guard, Reserve, and Auxiliary Components. As a Total Force, 
we are a values-based, mission-focused, people-oriented air force. Professionalism is the heart 
and soul of who we are and who we aspire to be every day. Our sense of professionalism underlies 
the pride we feel when we say, “I am an American Airman.” 
Professional Obligation and Status. Every Airman has an obligation to be the very best 
professional possible. As stated in AFI 1-1, the USAF has a very important national defense 
mission; and you, as a member of the USAF, have serious responsibilities for carrying out that 
mission. You are responsible for following orders, performing specific daily tasks related to your 
duties, and living up to the high standards of the USAF. Maintaining good order and discipline is 
paramount for mission accomplishment.  
Professional status is expressed by attitudes and commitments, and by internalizing military 
values which can come to people at different times in their lives and careers. Studying and 
understanding these factors are vital to Airmen and the future of the USAF. Professional military 
members of today and tomorrow must accept responsibility for their actions, hold others 
accountable, and take appropriate action to never hide behind excuses. Focus must be directed 
toward devoted service to the nation, not on pay or the next assignment. Our Air Force is a critical 
part of the greatest fighting force the world has ever known. It is powered by the greatest Airmen 
the world has ever seen. 
Mission-Focused. As Airmen, we stand ready, performing selfless duty in defense of our nation. 
We, and our families, are dedicated to answering our nation’s call, making sacrifices for the good 
of the mission. We, as Airmen, must have the courage to take appropriate risks when necessary.  
People-Oriented. Our most important resource is people. Taking care of our wingmen is our 
duty. We are an integrated force—strong, able, and ready. We, as Airmen, value the contribution 
of every member and motivate each other to achieve excellence. We also have a duty to develop 
and empower leaders. We honor and respect all who serve, and when we strengthen our alliances— 
we are stronger together.

1.2. Profession of Arms 
No profession asks more of its members than the profession of arms. As stated in our Airman’s 
Creed, we have answered our nation’s call. It is a higher calling, and it comes with a higher 
standard. As the pacing threats of our strategic competitors continue to grow and evolve, it’s crucial 
all Airmen understand how their profession connects with our mission of national security and 
defense of the homeland. 
General Ronald Fogleman, our 15th Air Force Chief of Staff, once said, “We are not engaged in 
just another job; we are practitioners of the profession of arms. We are entrusted with the security 
of our nation, the protection of our citizens and the preservation of its way of life. In this capacity, 
we serve as guardians of America’s future. By its very nature, this responsibility requires us to 
place the needs of our service and our country before personal concerns.” That responsibility was 
given to each and every Airman who raised their right hand and swore to support and defend the 
Constitution of the United States. When we joined our USAF with a sacred oath, we accepted a 
sacred trust from the American people, one that goes beyond anything else in society. As members 
of a joint team, our profession is distinguished from others because of our expertise in the justified 
application of lethal military force and the willingness of those who pay the ultimate sacrifice for 
our nation. No other profession expects its members to lay down their lives for their friends, 
families, or freedoms...but it’s what our profession readily expects.

1.3.   Air Force Core Values 
At the heart and soul of our profession, the USAF recognizes our core values as universal, 
consistent standards used to evaluate the ethical climate of all USAF organizations. When needed 
in the cauldron of war, core values are the beacons that light the path of professional conduct and 
the highest ideals. 
Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do 
Values represent enduring, guiding principles for which we stand. Values, such as the USAF core 
values of integrity, service, and excellence, should motivate attitudes and actions on and off duty 
as essential moral principles or beliefs that are held in the highest regard. Our core values represent 
the USAF’s firm convictions about the nature of our personal character, our commitment to each 
other and our nation, and the manner in which we perform our service. Core values are so 
fundamental that they define our very identity through a common bond among all professional 
Airmen—past and present. Being a part of our proud USAF community requires a commitment 
to living by these values at all times. 
Reflecting the USAF core values in one’s personal and professional lives is a challenge that must 
be faced every day. In doing so, we honor the heritage and continue the legacy of those who served 
before us and sacrificed so much. It is through this alignment of our actions with these values that 
we, as a USAF, earn the public’s trust, strengthen our service, and accomplish our mission. This 
is the expectation of our profession and is the standard that our fellow service members and the 
American public hold us to. 
Virtues of Core Values 
Each of the USAF core values is further defined by virtues (desired behaviors and characteristics) 
we must practice and demonstrate in our daily lives, showing we truly do value integrity, service, 
and excellence. Consistently practicing these virtues results in habits of honorable thought and 
action, producing a USAF professional. USAF professionalism is a shared belief in, and a 
commitment to, honorable service based on our USAF core values. 
1.3.1. Integrity First 
Integrity provides the bedrock for our military endeavors and is fortified by service to country. 
Integrity encompasses many characteristics indispensable to Airmen and makes us who we are and 
what we stand for. It is the compass that keeps us on the right path when we are confronted with 
ethical challenges and personal temptations, and it is the foundation upon which trust, and respect 
are built. 
Integrity is simply doing the right thing, all the time, whether everyone is watching, or no one is 
watching. An individual realizes integrity when thoughts and actions align with what he or she 
knows to be right. Following principles, acting with honor, maintaining independent judgment, 
and performing duties with impartiality, help to maintain integrity and avoid conflicts of interest. 
“The foundation of our Profession of Arms is, and has always been, respect. 
That is a non-negotiable principle that supports the Integrity, Service and Excellence of 
our great Air Force. It is the cornerstone of the culture we need in our Air Force.”

CMSAF JoAnne S. Bass 
19th Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
Virtues of Integrity. The virtues of Integrity First are honesty, courage, and accountability. 
Honesty. Honesty is the hallmark of integrity. As public servants, we are trusted agents. Honesty 
requires us to evaluate our performance against standards, and to conscientiously and accurately 
report findings. Our word must be unquestionable. This is the only way to preserve the trust and 
respect that we hold so dear for one another and the population we serve. 
Courage. Courage is not the absence of fear but doing the right thing despite fear. Courage 
empowers us to take necessary personal or professional risks, make decisions that may be 
unpopular, and admit our mistakes. Having the courage to take these actions is crucial for the 
mission, the USAF, and the nation. 
Accountability. Accountability instills our responsibility while maintaining transparency and 
ownership for our actions, whether it is the American people, our units, our supervisors, our fellow 
Airmen, our families, our loved ones, and even ourselves. Accountable individuals maintain 
transparency, seek honest and constructive feedback, and take ownership of the outcomes of their 
actions and decisions.  
1.3.2. Service Before Self 
Service Before Self represents an abiding dedication to the age-old military virtue of selfless 
dedication to duty, including putting one’s life at risk if called to do so. Service Before Self tells 
us that professional duties take precedence over personal desires. Airmen are practitioners of the 
profession of arms, entrusted with the security of the nation, the protection of its citizens, and the 
preservation of their way of life. In this capacity, Airmen serve as guardians of America’s future, 
and this responsibility requires the needs of service and country to be placed before our own. In 
today’s world, service to country requires not only a high degree of skill, but also a willingness to 
make personal sacrifices. It requires having the heart and mindset for service that allows us to 
embrace expectations and requirements not levied on the American public or other professions. 
Virtues of Service Before Self. The virtues of Service Before Self are duty, loyalty, and respect. 
Duty. Duty is the obligation to perform what is required for the mission. While our responsibilities 
are determined by the law, the Department of Defense, and USAF instructions, directives, and 
guidance, our sense of duty is a personal one and bound by the oath of service we took as 
individuals. Duty sometimes calls for sacrifice in ways no other profession has or will. Airmen 
who truly embody Service Before Self consistently choose to make necessary sacrifices to 
accomplish the mission, and in doing so, we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice. 
Loyalty. Loyalty is an internal commitment to the success and preservation of something bigger 
than ourselves. Our loyalty is to the nation first, the values and commitments of our USAF second, 
and finally to the men and women with whom we serve. Loyalty to our leaders requires us to trust, 
follow, and execute their decisions, even when we disagree. We offer alternative solutions and 
innovative ideas most effectively through the chain of command. Leaders demonstrate loyalty by 
respecting those who serve and treating them with dignity, compassion, and true concern for their 
well-being and professional development. Ultimately, loyalty is demonstrated by helping each 
other act with respect and honor. 
Respect. Respect encompasses self-respect, mutual respect, and organizational respect. We must 
honor the USAF and others by following our words with actions.

1.3.3. Excellence In All We Do 
Excellence In All We Do directs us to develop a sustained passion for the continuous improvement 
and innovation that propels the USAF, as well as ourselves, beyond the capabilities of our 
adversaries. Excellence In All We Do does not mean that we demand perfection in everything from 
everyone. But rather, it means we continuously advance our craft and increase our knowledge as 
Airmen. 
Excellence In All We Do means that Airmen seek out opportunities and complete developmental 
education; constantly work hard to stay in physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and moral shape; 
continue to enhance professional competencies; and are diligent to maintain their job skills, 
knowledge, and personal readiness at the highest possible levels. We must have a passion for 
deliberate continuous improvement and innovation that propels the USAF to accelerate change or 
lose now. 
Virtues of Excellence In All We Do. The virtues of Excellence In All We Do are mission, 
discipline, and teamwork. 
Mission. Mission focus encompasses operations and excellence in stewardship. The complex 
undertaking of the USAF mission requires us to harness the ingenuity, expertise, and elbow grease 
of all Airmen. We approach it with the mindset of respect, pride, innovation, and a continued 
commitment to anticipate and embrace change. Our work areas, our processes, and our 
interpersonal interactions must be undeniably professional and positive. Our people are the 
platform for delivering continuous process improvements, innovative ideas, strategies, and 
technologies to the overall mission. 
Discipline. Discipline is an individual commitment to uphold the highest of personal and 
professional standards. We demonstrate it in attitude, work ethic, and effort directed at continuous 
improvement, whether pursuing professional military education or nurturing ourselves physically, 
intellectually, emotionally, or spiritually. Our appearance, actions, professionalism, and words, 
spoken and written, represent the USAF and shape our USAF culture and the reputation of the 
entire military profession. 
Teamwork. Teamwork is essential to triumph at every level. Airmen recognize the 
interdependency of every member’s contribution toward the mission and strive for organizational 
excellence. We not only give our personal best, but also challenge and motivate each other to give 
their best. We gain respect through our actions and strong work ethic to build team trust. We carry 
our own weight, and whenever necessary, help our wingmen carry theirs.

1.4. Code of Ethics 
As a member of the USAF, you must practice the highest standards of conduct and integrity, not 
only in your job, but also in your relationships, personal financial dealings, and interactions with 
the civilian community. Whereas moral values describe what we hold to be right and wrong, ethics 
is the systematic reflection of these values enabling us to live and act according to our beliefs. 
Although following the law is ethical, laws only tell us what we can and cannot do. Ethics, on the 
other hand, tells us what we should or shouldn’t do. Thus, Airmen must follow the law, but simply 
doing so is not enough. Airmen must also develop a code of ethics such that your behavior and 
motives do not create even the appearance of impropriety while providing a larger standard to live 
up to. Your commitment to integrity and excellence will lead the way for others to follow. 
Nonetheless, personal values, such as happiness or stability, while almost always present, must not 
take precedence over USAF’s ethical values. The key is to align ethical values with personal 
values and enhance the commitment we have made to the dedicated service of our nation. Our 
ethical code is prescribed in our core values, our oaths, the Airman’s Creed, Professions of Arms, 
DoD and USAF guidance, Joint Ethics Regulation, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
When faced with decisions related to mission, personal life, or the interest of peers, the choice 
can always be made with consideration for our ethical code. 
Principles and Guidelines. Embedded in our code of ethics, and driven by our competence and 
character, are key guidelines that help clarify acceptable and unacceptable behavior, but also 
aspirational values about who we want to be. Principles and ethical guidelines can be used to help 
identify what right looks like and continue to fortify our USAF culture. Title 5, CFR, Part 2635, 
Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, establishes the basic ethical 
principles and guidelines that must be followed by every government employee. A few examples 
of ethical expectations outlined in the regulation are provided here. 
Public service is a public trust, requiring employees to place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws, 
and ethical principles, above private gain. 
Employees shall not hold financial interests that conflict with the conscientious performance 
of duty. 
Employees shall not solicit or accept any gift or other item of monetary value from any person 
or entity seeking official action from, doing business with, or conducting activities regulated 
by the employee’s agency, or whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance 
or nonperformance of the employee’s duties. 
Employees shall not knowingly make unauthorized commitments or promises of any kind 
purporting to bind the government. 
Employees shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any non-Federal entity 
(including installation-recognized private organization) or individual. 
Employees shall protect and conserve federal property and shall not use it for other than 
authorized activities. 
Employees shall satisfy, in good faith, their obligations as citizens, including all just financial 
obligations, especially federal, state, or local taxes that are imposed by law.

Employees may generally not accept gifts from subordinates or employees that make less pay 
than themselves. 
Employees may not solicit a donation or a contribution from other personnel for a gift to a 
superior, make a donation for a gift to a superior official, or accept a gift from subordinate 
personnel, except for voluntary gifts or contributions of nominal value (not to exceed $10), on 
occasions of special personal significance (such as marriage or birth of a child), or occasions 
that terminate the superior-subordinate relationship, such as retirement, permanent change of 
station or assignment. 
1.4.1. Ethical Dilemma 
An ethical dilemma is a situation where one is forced to choose between at least two alternatives. 
Three general causes or sources of ethical dilemmas are: uncertainty, competing values, and 
potential harm. Uncertainty is the result of not having all the facts pertaining to a situation; not 
having enough experience for dealing with a situation; or not having a clearly established policy, 
procedure, or rules for deciding how to make an optimal decision. Competing values occur when 
our personal values conflict with those of our institution, subordinates, peers, or supervisors; 
however, the mark of a true professional is maintaining high professional standards despite 
conflicting values by locating the conflicting values, weighing one’s options, and deciding upon 
the best course of action. Potential harm relates to the intentional and unintentional short and long- 
term consequences caused by our actions. 
Decisions and Actions. As Airmen, we should always think through second and third order effects 
of our actions. We must apply a sense of order to our priorities, so we are able to overcome 
temptation to stray from our military norms and values. When contemplating what to do, consider 
possible courses of action by listing the best options and quality checking ideas to take the right 
path. When possible, take the decision process to the next level and put each course of action to 
the test. Dr. Robert M. Hicks, former Deputy Director of the Civil Air Patrol, Chaplain Services, 
identified three tests we can use to check the morality of our actions and decisions. 
The Network Test. The network test consists of asking yourself, “How would this decision look 
if it was aired on the news or social media?” If your actions were broadcast on the evening news, 
would you be proud of your actions or ashamed? Would your actions bring credit to yourself and 
the USAF or would they discredit yourself or those we owe? If you find yourself leaning toward 
a negative response to these questions, then your decision doesn’t pass the network test. 
The United States of America Test. The United States of America test focuses on asking 
yourself, “Is this decision good for the United States? Is this decision good for the USAF? Is this 
decision good for my unit (us)? Is this decision good for me?” If you take this course of action, 
are you properly ordering your priorities? If you can’t answer with a resounding yes, this might 
not be the best decision. 
The Divine Test. The divine test deals with asking yourself, “Would I feel good about the decision 
when I give account for my life?” When telling the story of your proud and honorable service to 
our country, would you include conversation about this decision? Would you feel guilt or loss of 
trust from this action? If you can’t confidently provide a positive response, the course of action 
fails the divine test. 
1.4.2. Honorable Characteristics 
Airmen share a history of valor, courage, and sacrifice. From the earliest days of airpower to the 
heights of space, Airmen have built an extraordinary heritage that forms the foundation for a 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
25 
 
 
 
boundless horizon. We are technology focused, we embrace change, and through transformation 
and innovation, we ensure a viable USAF for the future. 
Always keep focus on demonstrating honorable service and commitment to the profession of arms. 
Through skills, knowledge, and experience developed in the USAF, listen to your internal compass 
while fostering the same in your peers. Remind yourself and your peers of the reason you do what 
you do. Declare the importance of serving for a higher cause, adhering to established ethical codes, 
and embracing a USAF culture steeped in honor and tradition. Rely on what you know is true and 
what is right. Be the Airman who makes decisions and leads in a way you can be proud of. 
Airmen firmly grounded in the core values react to stresses, operational deployment pressures, 
and daily home station demands with valor, courage, and sacrifice. While many acts of valor, 
courage, or sacrifice go unseen, they should be recognized not only as part of USAF culture, but 
also to illustrate that any Airman may be called upon at any time to perform above and beyond in 
the profession of arms. 
Valor. Valor is the ability to face danger or hardship in a determined and resolute manner. Valor 
is commonly and rightly recognized as bravery, fearlessness, fortitude, gallantry, heart, and nerve. 
When acting with valor, one expresses the willingness to step outside the comfort zone to deal 
with unexpected situations. Such situations can happen almost anywhere. In addition to 
demonstrating valor on the battlefield, an Airman can exhibit valor when presented with unusual 
circumstances in the daily routine of life and take intelligent risks. 
Courage. Courage is about the ability to face fear, danger, or adversity. Three types of courage 
are critical in the profession of arms: personal, physical, and moral. Personal courage is about 
doing what’s right even when risking one’s career. Physical courage is the ability to overcome 
fears of bodily harm to get the job done, or willingness to risk harm to yourself for someone else’s 
sake in battle or the course of everyday life. Finally, moral courage is the ability to stand by the 
core values when moral courage may not be the popular thing to do. Integrity breeds courage when 
and where the behavior is most needed. Often, courage is manifested as an act of bravery on the 
battlefield when Airmen face the challenges present in combat. 
Sacrifice. Sacrifice involves a willingness to give your time, comfort, or life to meet others’ needs. 
Personal sacrifices occur whenever Airmen put others’ needs before individual wants, whether in 
combat, at home station, or in the local community. 
Call to Duty. When Americans commit to service, the USAF takes on the charge to develop them 
into Airmen. Over the next 30 years, the USAF’s ability to continue to adapt and respond faster 
than our potential adversaries will depend on the flexibility and adaptability of our current and 
next generation Airmen. We will recruit, develop, and retain exceptional Airmen through 
strategies and programs designed to develop and care for our Total Force, strengthen the USAF 
culture, and leverage development opportunities that employ creative concepts across the force. 
When faced with the call to duty, we must remember that we are Airmen. As Airmen, we 
understand the price that is paid for freedom and the sacrifices that come from willing service to 
our country. We understand the meaning of belonging to the profession of arms.

1.5. The Airman’s Creed 
The Airman’s Creed was presented to the USAF in 2007 by General T. Michael Moseley, 18th Air 
Force Chief of Staff. General Moseley introduced the creed as an aspect of one of his top priorities 
to reinvigorate the Total Force. The intent of the creed was to enhance the building of a warrior 
ethos among Airmen and establish a coherent bond between the members of the USAF. 
 
THE AIRMAN’S CREED 
 
I am an American Airman. 
I am a Warrior. 
I have answered my Nation’s call. 
 
I am an American Airman. 
My mission is to Fly, Fight, and Win. 
I am faithful to a Proud Heritage, A Tradition of Honor, 
And a Legacy of Valor. 
 
I am an American Airman. 
Guardian of Freedom and Justice, My Nation’s Sword and Shield, Its Sentry and Avenger. 
I defend my Country with my Life. 
 
I am an American Airman. Wingman, Leader, Warrior. 
I will never leave an Airman behind, I will never falter, 
And I will not fail.

2.1.  Introduction to Aviation History 
Aviation history, particularly the early years of aviation fundamentals, provides an understanding 
of the foundations of airpower. This chapter on aviation history contains information on the 
beginning of the aviation industry and the evolution of airpower in the early days. Material in this 
chapter examines how participation in wars and conflicts throughout our history helped drive 
innovation and technological advancements to develop the United States (U.S.) Air Force into the 
greatest Air Force in the world. Note: Several significant historical events associated with air and 
space flight, and most importantly, the legacy of the men and women of the USAF, are foundations 
of the Air Force of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Chapters 2 and 3 are designed in chronological 
order. Significant events may overlap or may have occurred simultaneously; therefore, dates are 
considered for the general purposes of providing a timeline of aviation history and Air Force 
heritage. Many military projects, exercises, and operations are identified by names or titles. Several 
factors are considered before establishing and publishing names for operations. Operational names 
are a combination of one or two separate unclassified words that are assigned an unclassified 
meaning and used for unclassified administrative, morale, or public information purposes. 
Typically, there are four general suggestions for naming operations: make them meaningful, target 
key audiences, avoid fashion, and make them memorable. 
2.2.  First Flights 
The dream of flight has nearly always existed. It was when two French brothers launched a hot air 
balloon in 1783, that man was able to fly. Approximately a decade later, military aviation became 
a noteworthy potential when, in 1794, the French Aerostatic Corps’ balloons accompanied the 
Armies of the French Revolution. European advancements in balloons, gliders, and aerodynamics 
continued to progress rapidly. By 1853, Britain’s Sir George Cayley created a glider with fixed 
wings, cambered airfoil, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers. These gliders eventually evolved 
into flying machines similar to today’s hang gliders. In 1861, a Balloon Corps provided aerial 
observation and reconnaissance for the Union Army during the American Civil War. The seven 
balloons in the inventory proved to be useful, but they were fragile and vulnerable to weather 
conditions. In 1863, the Army disbanded the Union Army Balloon Corps. 
Orville and Wilbur Wright. In the early 1900s, Orville and Wilbur 
Wright conducted more than 1,000 glides and achieved the first powered, 
sustained, controlled airplane flight, heralding the age of heavier-than-air 
aviation. When 
President 
Theodore 
Roosevelt established an 
Aeronautical Division in the U.S. Army’s Signal Corps on 1 August 1907, 
the Wright Brothers offered the only flyable aircraft that met specifications 
for its first military airplane. The flying machine had to carry two people 
with a combined weight of 350 pounds or less, and it needed to be able to 
fly for 125 miles at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. Despite a crash 
on 17 September 1908, seriously injuring Orville and killing passenger 
Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge, by 1909 the U.S. Army accepted its first 
of many aircraft, the Signal Corps No. 1, from the Wright Company. 
The Wright Brothers 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
28 
 
 
 
Subsequently, the Wright Brothers trained several U.S. Army pilots, including Henry H. “Hap” 
Arnold, future commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces. 
2.3.  Aeronautical Division, Signal Corps (1 August 1907 – 18 July 1914) 
When the Aeronautical Division, Signal Corps was established in 1907, the Army inevitably found 
itself in possession of several balloons that had been retained since the disbandment of the Balloon 
Corps. With that discovery, the Army realized the need for trained enlisted men to conduct balloon 
inflations and make necessary repairs. That year, Eddie Ward and Joseph Barrett reported in at the 
Leo Stevens’ Balloon Factory in New York, New York. They were the first enlisted men in the 
Aeronautical Division to be schooled in the rudiments of fabric handling, folding, and stitching. 
They were also taught the manufacturing of buoyant gases and became experts in the inflation and 
control of the Army’s aircraft. 
Developing an inventory and ensuring the safety of the pilots were two significant concerns 
regarding military aviation in the Signal Corps. Enlisted crews not only repaired the planes, but 
they also labored to make them safer to fly. They provided day-to-day support for a handful of 
officer pilots, learned new skills as airplane mechanicians (aircraft mechanics with skills and 
knowledge to maintain and repair aircraft engines, airframes, controls, and systems), and 
furthered skills as mechanics, riggers, and fitters. The enlisted detachment was a small band of 
enlisted Airmen who shared in the first steps of establishing military aviation as a permanent part 
of the nation’s defense. By October 1912, the Aeronautical Division consisted of 11 aircraft with 
14 flying officers and 39 enlisted mechanics, making it relatively equivalent to forces in Europe. 
In 1913, the 1st Aero Squadron was activated. It is recognized as the oldest squadron in the USAF. 
Wright Biplane Chief Mechanic, Frank Scott. Corporal Frank Scott 
enlisted in the Field Artillery branch of the U.S. Army in 1908 and cross-
trained into the Signal Corps in 1911. He was initially assigned to launching 
and releasing of hot air balloons and was soon transferred to work on the 
Type-B Wright biplane. As a chief mechanic, Corporal Scott was offered an 
opportunity to accompany the pilot, Lieutenant Rockwell, on a test flight. On 
28 September 1912, when the pilot attempted to land, the aircraft experienced 
engine trouble. It unfortunately became Scott’s first and only flight. Both 
Corporal Scott and Lieutenant Rockwell lost their lives that day. Corporal 
Frank Scott was the first enlisted person to die in an accident in a military 
aircraft. Scott Field, now Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, was named in his 
honor. 
First American Enlisted Pilot, Vernon L. Burge. The story of enlisted 
pilots began long before the official enlisted pilot training program was 
established. In the early 1900’s, Captain Frank P. Lahm commanded a 
newly opened air school in the Philippines. Lahm had trouble finding 
enough officers to train, so Corporal Vernon L. Burge, Lahm’s crew chief, 
volunteered and received his pilot's license in June 1912. He is recognized as 
the first American enlisted pilot, one of only a handful of World War I 
enlisted aviators. After 10 years as an enlisted man, Burge was 
commissioned during World War I and served the next 25 years as an 
officer.

Father of Blind Flight, William C. Ocker. Sergeant William C. Ocker 
entered the U.S. Army on 25 June 1898. He served in the Spanish- 
American and Philippine-American Wars with cavalry and artillery units. 
After requesting a transfer, on 20 April 1914 he officially joined Burge 
(the first enlisted pilot) and Lamkey (the second enlisted pilot) as the third 
enlisted pilot. During World War I, while instructing other pilots, Ocker 
addressed the hazards of flying into clouds, which invariably disoriented 
pilots. He developed a flight integrator, an electrically-driven gyroscope 
with a moving background scroll that depicted a sky with clouds and a 
miniature airplane silhouette that remained correctly oriented relative to the horizon. In June 
1930, Ocker flew approximately 900 miles from San Antonio, Texas to Scott Field, Illinois in an 
enclosed cockpit, earning him recognition as the “Father of Blind Flight.” In January 1955, the 
USAF posthumously awarded the Legion of Merit to Ocker for the many lives saved during World 
War II as a result of the training devices he pioneered. 
2.4.  Aviation Section, Signal Corps (18 July 1914 – 20 May 1918) 
On 18 July 1914, with the passage of U.S. House Resolution 5304, the bill authorized the Signal 
Corps to establish an aviation section. This new launch pad for aviation was officially designated 
as Aviation Section, Signal Corps, consisting of 60 officers and 260 enlisted men. The bill created 
an official military rating for the aviation mechanician, which called for a 50 percent pay increase 
for enlisted men who were instructed in the art of flying while on flying status. The total number 
of personnel was limited to 40, with no more than twelve enlisted men authorized by law, but it 
was a major breakthrough for enlisted aviators. The Aviation Section was a significant step toward 
establishing the Army Air Service. 
2.5.  Mexican Revolution and the Pancho Villa Expedition 
During the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1920, Francisco “Pancho” Villa’s forces raided 
Columbus, New Mexico. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered the 1st Aero Squadron to 
assist ground forces in protecting the border and apprehending Pancho Villa. Commanded by 
Captain Benjamin Foulois, 11 pilot officers, 82 enlisted men, and one civilian mechanic departed 
from San Antonio, Texas with eight Curtiss JN-3 Jennies, 10 trucks, and one automobile. On the 
way, Foulois picked up two enlisted hospital corpsmen and an engineering section consisting of 
one officer and 14 enlisted. Despite the 1st Aero Squadron’s successful reconnaissance flights and 
several dispatches, mountain weather, dust, extreme temperatures, and the 5,000-feet elevations of 
the Casa Grandes in Chihuahua, Mexico wreaked havoc with the aircraft. Within one month, only 
two of the eight airplanes were in working condition. 
In February, after almost a year of what was commonly referred to as the Punitive Expedition, the 
pursuit of Pancho Villa was called off. Villa continued to lead rebels in Northern Mexico until 
1920 when he successfully negotiated with the Mexican interim President for amnesty in exchange 
for a peace settlement on behalf of himself and his military. Captain Foulois commended his pilots 
for their bravery and their willingness to fly clearly dangerous aircraft. He also praised the enlisted 
personnel for their dedication and willingness to workday and night to keep the aircraft flying. 
Valuable lessons were learned about the realities of aviation under field conditions. Adequate 
maintenance was essential, as were plenty of backup aircraft while other airplanes were removed 
from the line and repaired.

A Man of Many Firsts, Benjamin D. Foulois. After enlisting in the Army at 
the time of the Spanish-American War, and being commissioned during his 
service in the Philippines, Benjamin D. “Benny” Foulois was assigned to the 
Office of the Chief Signal Officer, Washington D.C. in 1908, where he 
participated in the acceptance tests of the Army’s first semi-rigid dirigible and 
its first airplane, the Wright Flyer, Signal Corps No. 1. In 1910, he took the 
aircraft to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, where he conducted tests to demonstrate 
the aircraft’s military usefulness. After completing the organization of the 
1st Aero Squadron, Foulois commanded the Pancho Villa Expedition, 
and after the United States entered World War I, Foulois played a major role in planning and 
implementing the $640 million aviation program. In 1917, Brigadier General Foulois was named 
Chief of the Air Service for the American Expeditionary Force, moved to Washington, D.C. in 
1927 to become Assistant Chief of the Air Service, and in 1931 was promoted to Major General 
as Chief of the Air Corps.

2.6.  Air Power in World War I 
The Allies, often referred to as Entente Powers, initially consisted of three entities in 1907: the 
French Republic, the British Empire, and the Russian Empire. Eventually Italy and Japan joined 
the side of the Entente, as well as Belgium, Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, and Romania. The Central 
Powers on the opposing side, often referred to as the Quadruple Alliance, included the German 
Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and the Kingdom of Bulgaria. The lines were 
drawn by the time World War I began in July 1914, just days after Archduke Franz Ferdinand of 
Austria was assassinated by Yugoslav forces in Sarajevo. 
By 8 December 1913, the 1st Aero Squadron consisted of 15 officers, 61 enlisted men, 8 aircraft, 
16 tractors, and 6 motorcycles. By 1916, a second squadron and new training facilities were added 
with plans for 24 more squadrons with a dozen aircraft each. All 24 squadrons were formed by early 
1917, but only the 1st Aero Squadron was fully equipped, manned, and organized when the United 
States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917. The U.S. Army Aviation Section inventory 
included less than 250 airplanes and consisted of 131 officers (virtually all pilots or pilots-in-
training), and 1,087 enlisted men. 
Tradition dictated that pilots were drawn from the ranks of commissioned officers, but the Aviation 
Section realized the pressing need for trained enlisted personnel to perform duties in supply and 
construction and to serve specialized functions in the emerging aviation-related fields of photo- 
reconnaissance, communication, armament, welding, rigging, sail making, and most of all, 
mechanics. By November 1918, billions of dollars were spent, and over 70 million lives were lost. 
Battles ensued with victories and defeats of what some refer to as devastation, while others refer 
to as a revolutionary approach to military power. 
2.7.  The First Air War 
Aircraft and aerial warfare evolved during World War I between 1914 and 1918. Observation, 
artillery spotting, and reconnaissance emerged as the airplane’s most important wartime missions. 
By 1915, pursuit aircraft were developed to deny the enemy use of airspace. While flying missions 
evolved from information gathering to defense, using handguns to take down enemy aircraft left 
much to be desired. One of the most remarkable advancements in aviation technology was the 
arming of aircraft with machine guns that fired between the propeller blades. Using the deflector 
blade concept, French pilot, Roland Garros, attached steel plates to the propeller of his Morane- 
Saulnier Type L monoplane, enabling him to fire through the propeller arc of his aircraft. This 
innovative process enabled Garros to achieve the first aerial victory in history. Note: When engine 
trouble forced Garros to land behind enemy lines on 19 April 1915, the Germans captured him as 
a prisoner of war, but also studied the innovative concepts on his aircraft and created the first true 
fighter plane, the Fokker Eindecker, which was used ferociously on allied aircraft. 
Flying Aces. The concept of the ace emerged in 1915 during World War I at the same time as 
aerial dogfighting. A flying ace or “ace” is a military aviator credited with shooting down multiple 
enemy aircraft during aerial combat. Initially five or more aerial victories were required to be 
considered an ace, but that number varies throughout history. Public sentiment for the ace was 
based on a sense of pride and patriotism for war heroes in the skies. Allies and adversaries alike 
publicized aces to foster public support for the war effort. While aces are generally thought of 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
32 
 
 
 
exclusively as fighter pilots, enlisted aviators also earned the coveted title. Aerial gunners and 
observers, for example, were often referred to as aces for executing air-to-air victories on the 
enemy. 
Ace of Aces, Edward V. Rickenbacker. Captain Edward V. “Fast Eddie” 
Rickenbacker served in the U.S. Army Air Service from 1917 to 1919 and 
has been highly regarded as the most successful fighter ace in World War I. 
With 26 confirmed aerial victories, Rickenbacker became known as 
America’s “Ace of Aces” and held the American record for victories until 
World War II. He is considered to have received the most awards for valor, 
received the Distinguished Service Cross a record of eight times, and in 
1930, one of his Service Crosses was converted to the Medal of Honor. 
The Lafayette Escadrille. As early as 1915, Americans flew in the European war, both with the 
French and the British—though it was the American-manned Lafayette Escadrille of France that 
earned the greatest and most enduring fame. Named in honor of Marquis de Lafayette, Hero of the 
Two Worlds, the French Air Service established the Lafayette Escadrille in 1916. In 1918, 
American members of the Lafayette Escadrille transferred into the U.S. Army Air Service as the 
103d Aero Squadron while the French formed the Escadrille Jeanne d’Arc. 
First African American Military Pilot, Eugene Bullard. Corporal Eugene 
Bullard is one of the very few enlisted Americans to fly in the war, and the 
first African American military pilot. Bullard enlisted in 1914 and was 
assigned to the 3rd Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion. In World War 
I, Bullard flew as a machine gunner and served in over 20 air combat 
missions. As a member of the French Foreign Legion, he was awarded the 
French Croix de Guerre. He was wounded four times before the legion gave 
him a disability discharge. During his convalescence in Paris, he bet an 
American $2,000 that he could learn to fly and become a combat aviator. 
Corporal Bullard won the bet by completing training and joining the 
Lafayette Escadrille. Referred to as “The Black Swallow of Death,” he 
claimed two victories. 
2.8.  Division of Military Aeronautics (20 May 1918 – 24 May 1918)  
On 20 May 1918, President Wilson issued an Executive Order that transferred Army aviation 
control from the Signal Corps to the Secretary of War. This four-day transition existed long enough 
for the reorganization to take place and officially transfer recognition of responsibilities of aviation 
administration, assets, and personnel from the division of military aeronautics to the Air Service. 
2.9.  Air Service, U.S. Army (24 May 1918 – 2 July 1926) 
The U.S. Army Air Service was established in 1918 as a temporary branch of the U.S. War 
Department and was faced with budget cutbacks and resistance to establishing an independent Air 
Force. A drawdown was enacted in 1918 that called for a reduction in Air Service personnel from 
190,000 to fewer than 20,000. Likewise, the $952 million allocated for military aviation in 1919 
fell to $28 million in 1920. Another challenge came about when Congress demanded that new 
military aircraft use the surplus Liberty engines produced during the World War I buildup. 
Consequently, World War I vintage Curtiss JN-3 Jennies and Liberty DH-4 bombers remained in 
service until the 1930s, despite technological advances that had been made in airframe and engine 
design.

Father of the USAF, William Mitchell. After enlisting, joining the 
Aviation Section of the Signal Corps, and taking private flying lessons, 
William “Billy” Mitchell earned his private pilot’s license. He was 
convinced of airpower’s potential as the primary component of national 
defense against strategic bombardment and was a strong advocate for an 
independent Air Force. Mitchell’s claims ultimately led to bombing trials 
in June 1921. Under his leadership, the 1st Provisional Air Brigade sank 
the 27,000-ton former German battleship Ostfriesland. Officials turned 
over two World War I battleships for further testing, the United States 
Ship (USS) New Jersey and the USS Virginia, to punctuate the values of 
airpower. At the age of 32, Captain Mitchell was the youngest member to 
join the General Staff. For his efforts, Mitchell earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the 
Distinguished Service Medal, the World War I Victory Medal with eight campaign clasps, and 
several foreign decorations. Note: In 1924, Mitchell developed a 324-page report that predicted 
a future war with Japan, including the attack on Pearl Harbor. Mitchell believed a surprise attack 
on the Hawaiian Islands would be conducted by land- based aircraft operating from islands in the 
Pacific. His report was published as the book Winged Defense in 1925, about sixteen years prior 
to the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan in 1941. 
Demonstration of Airpower, Ulysses Nero. A young bombardier, 
Sergeant Ulysses “Sam” Nero, was 
selected 
to 
demonstrate the 
capabilities 
of 
airpower. Against established tactics, during the 
demonstration Nero and the Martin-Curtiss NBS-1 pilot approached the 
USS New Jersey at 85 miles per hour at an altitude of 6,900 feet, from 
about 15 degrees off the port beam. They scored two hits, and the USS 
New Jersey went down in just over three minutes. Having one bomb left, 
Nero’s aircraft proceeded to the floundering USS Virginia to administer 
the coup de grace on the stricken craft—the shot landed directly on the 
Virginia’s deck, putting it out of commission permanently. General 
Mitchell disqualified Nero and his pilot from further competition for 
disobeying instructions, but he reconsidered when the rest of the crews failed to hit the USS 
Virginia unless they dropped down to 1,500 feet. Nero was promoted during the next cycle. 
Note: The NBS in Martin-Curtis NBS-1 is an abbreviation for night bomber-short range. 
End of the Enlisted Pilot Era and George H. Holmes. George H. Holmes 
served in the Navy during World War I. After the war, he enlisted in the Army 
in 1919 as a mechanic. In 1921 Holmes became a pilot flying the Curtiss JN-
4D Jenny and other aircraft. When World War II ended, Lieutenant Colonel 
Holmes chose to revert back to his enlisted rank. Ending the era of enlisted 
pilots, Master Sergeant George H. Holmes was the last of about 2,500 men 
who graduated from enlisted pilot training. When he retired from the Air 
Force in 1957, he was the last of the enlisted pilots.  
World War I Armistice. Airpower clearly played an important role in the Allied victory of World 
War I. As of the Armistice on 11 November 1918, observation, reconnaissance, and artillery 
spotting remained significant missions, but close air support, interdiction, and strategic 
bombardment showed promise in the progress of airpower. Armistice Day may best be known as 
the signing of an agreement to end the war in the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day, of the eleventh 
month. Some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was 
signed in 1919 and many of the troops serving abroad finally returned to their home countries. In

the United States, Armistice is publicly recognized on Veterans Day in honor of military veterans. 
2.10. U.S. Army Air Corps (2 July 1926 – 20 June 1941) 
The U.S. Army Air Corps was established as a step toward recognizing the autonomy of aviation 
and its role in modern warfare. During this time, aviation was still a part of the U.S. Army 
command structure. Meanwhile, the Air Corps Tactical School and Air Corps Technical School 
evolved under the U.S. Army Air Corps. 
Air Corps Tactical School. Through a brief series of changes, in 1926 the Air Service Tactical 
School, designed for military officer professional development, was renamed the Air Corps 
Tactical School. Eventually the Air Corps Tactical School was relocated to Maxwell Field, 
Alabama, where it was later replaced as the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics. The school 
is now recognized as the Air University, and remains on Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. 
Air Corps Technical School. In 1926, the Air Corps Technical School was established at Chanute 
Field, Illinois. While other branches of the Army returned to the apprentice system of assignment 
and training, the Army Air Corps continued to use and develop a combination of the Army Alpha 
Test (reading and writing assessment), aptitude tests, and counseling. At the technical school, 
students participated in a range of experimental work, including altitude flights, blind flying, aerial 
photography, cosmic ray research, and the development of the parachute. Enlisted men who 
wanted to apply for technical training had to qualify as high school graduates, or the equivalent, 
and pass a mathematics proficiency test in addition to the Army Alpha Test. A trade test specialist 
familiar with the actual work personally interviewed each enlisted man. By 1938, the technical 
school branched out to Lowry Field, Colorado and Scott Field, Illinois. 
Aerial Refueling and Carl A. Spaatz. General Carl A. “Tooey” Spaatz, 
first Chief of Staff of the Air Force, was a member of the Fokker C-2 
aircrew that launched the legendary Question Mark mission on 1 January 
1929 to showcase aerial refueling potential. The mission was simple, 
determine how long the aircrew could keep the aircraft in the air. The crew 
flew the Question Mark for 150 hours and 40 minutes, taking on 5,600 
gallons of hand-pumped fuel during 37 air-to-air refuelings. They traveled 
11,000 miles on that journey, proving the relatively unlimited range 
available with air refueling capabilities. 
Operation Point Blank and Ira C. Eaker. General Ira C. Eaker was 
an aviation pioneer and articulate advocate of aerospace power. 
Commissioned in the Army Reserve after graduating flight school, he 
participated in the Pan-American Good Will Flight of 1926 and 1927, 
which is displayed at the National Museum of the USAF in Dayton, 
Ohio. Eaker also flew in the legendary Question Mark extended aerial 
refueling mission in 1929. As a strong advocate for daylight strategic 
bombardment, during Operation Point Blank, Eaker directed the 
daylight campaigns while the British conducted their night area 
bombing. The co-led operation struck the German military and industrial base of Nazi-
occupied territories around the clock, exhausting German strength, as well as its production 
capabilities. 
2.11. General Headquarters (GHQ) Air Force (1935 – 1939) 
Alongside the Army Air Corps, GHQ Air Force was set up to focus primarily on control of 
aviation combat units, while still being aligned under the Army Air Corps. This was a confusing 
Carl A. Spaatz 
Ira C. Eaker 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
35 
 
 
 
half-step toward an independent Air Force but proved to be the right direction for the conception 
of airpower. GHQ Air Force was established with the recognition that technological advances in 
aircraft would eventually propel airpower forward as a significant military force, beyond its early 
role of solely supporting ground troops. In 1938, when the United States first took the signs of 
war in Europe seriously, the Army’s Air Arm was still split into two cumbersome command 
organizations, the Army Air Corps and GHQ Air Force. In 1939, President Roosevelt asked for 
an appropriation of $300 million for military aviation. Before the outbreak of hostilities in Europe 
in the fall of 1939, GHQ Air Force had begun the massive expansion program that eventually 
evolved into the largest air organization in the nation’s history. 
2.12. U.S. Army Air Forces (20 June 1941 – 17 September 1947) 
The U.S. Army Air Forces was established in June 1941. It replaced both the U.S. Army Air Corps 
and the GHQ Air Force. Although still under command of the Army, the message was clear, unify 
command of all air elements, give total autonomy to air forces, and provide equality separate from 
ground forces. The U.S. Army Air Forces continued to exist as a branch of the Army (similar to 
the infantry, quartermaster, or artillery) until reorganization provisions of the Public Law 80-495, 
National Security Act of 1947, 18 September 1947. 
Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces, Henry H. Arnold. 
General Henry H. “Hap” Arnold was an aviation pioneer, a West Point 
graduate, and an infantryman. In 1911 he was taught to fly by Orville and 
Wilbur Wright. Arnold began his rise through the Army Air Corps during 
the interwar years, serving in Air Service Headquarters and in several of the 
most important operational flying commands in the field. After serving two 
years as the Chief of the Air Corps, in June 1941 he became Commanding 
General of the U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II. Under General 
Arnold’s command, the force expanded to nearly 2.5 million members and 
75,000 aircraft.

2.13. Airpower in World War II 
Allied Powers that existed at the onset of World War II in 1939 consisted of a long list of countries: 
France, Poland, the United Kingdom, British India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South 
Africa. Soon, the Balkans, Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, and Yugoslavia joined the alliance as 
well. By 1942, the countries emerged as the United Nations, and brought the United States, Russia, 
and China onboard to stop the Axis Powers. The Axis Powers consisted of Germany, Japan, and 
Italy. If World War I signaled airpower’s promise, World War II fulfilled the vision. In every 
aspect of aerial combat, airpower served as a force multiplier. Air superiority proved to be a 
prerequisite for successful land, sea, and air operations. 
2.14. Ramping Up 
Recognizing the need for a robust national defense, in 1940 President Franklin D. Roosevelt called 
for American industry to build 50,000 military aircraft a year in preparation for defending our 
nation’s interests. That same year, Congress passed the first peacetime conscription law in United 
States history, mandating that all able-bodied men join the service. At the time, the U.S. Army Air 
Corps inventory was merely 1,700 tactical and training aircraft, 1,600 Air Corps officers, and 
18,000 enlisted men. The Air Corps planned for 24 operational combat-ready groups by 1941, 
which called for greatly enhanced manpower, training, and equipment. Although American 
industry was ready to move forward with production, aeronautical designs, blueprints, tools, dies, 
airframes, engines, factories, skilled workers, and countless other components of an aviation 
industry, they would require time to develop. 
On 7 December 1941, “a date which will live in infamy,” Imperial Japan dealt a devastating blow 
to the United States at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii by sinking or heavily damaging several military 
battleships in two waves of approximately 350 Japanese aircraft. Also, our military aircraft made 
prime targets for Japanese aviators as they continued their attack that same day by destroying an 
entire fleet refueling on the ground in the Philippines. On 8 December 1941, the United States 
declared war on Japan. Three days later, we were at war with Germany and Italy as allies of Japan. 
Despite the fact that the attack on Pearl Harbor was what formally brought the United States into 
the war, the war in Europe and the defeat of Germany would take precedence. 
Reflecting on 1930s Air Corps Tactical School doctrine of using massive force to destroy the 
enemy’s will and capability to fight through long-range strategic bombardment, by 1942 American 
factories produced 33,304 aircraft, and by 1944 the inventory rose to 72,726. Also, by March 1944 
Air Force manpower reached over two million. During the war, the majority of enlisted Airmen 
served in roles that never took them into the air, but without their efforts, no bombs would have 
dropped, and no war could have been waged. Considering all the support personnel in the Army 
Air Corps, the ratio of Airmen to aircraft was about 27 to 1. American industrial production, 
strategic target bombing, new tactics, enhanced training, greater budgets, and new aircraft with 
greater range, speed, and maneuverability, all proved to be key factors to an Allied victory. 
2.15. Prohibition of Discrimination 
Executive Orders 8802 and 9981. In 1941, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802, 
prohibiting racial discrimination within the services. Civil rights activists saw promise for 
desegregation with Executive Order 8802, requiring vocational and training programs to be 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
37 
 
 
 
administered without discrimination for race, creed, color, or national origin. The order made 
progress but did not end segregation. When the USAF became a distinct service in 1947, 
segregation policies restricted black Airmen to all-black units or segregated service squadrons. In 
1948, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981 to abolish racial discrimination. 
On 11 May 1949, Air Force Letter 35.3 was published, mandating that black Airmen be reassigned 
to formerly all-white units according to qualifications.  
The Tuskegee Airmen. In 1944, the first Tuskegee Airmen to 
fight in World War II were members of the 99th Fighter 
Squadron, a unit commanded by black West Point graduate, 
Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. Soon after battling German 
aircraft over the skies of Anzio, Italy in their P-40 aircraft, they 
were joined by a second Tuskegee unit, the 332d Fighter Group 
with their P-39s. The Tuskegee Airmen’s obsolete aircraft were 
replaced later that year by P-47s and P-51s respectively, and the 
crews flew bomber escort missions until the German surrender 
in the spring of 1945. 
By the end of World War II, nearly 1,000 black Americans had proudly and rightfully earned their 
wings. The Tuskegee Airmen destroyed 112 enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat, losing 66 of their 
own aircraft. As a tribute to their skill, courage, and determination, the Tuskegee Airmen amassed 
a distinguished combat record on their 312 escort missions into Germany. The Tuskegee Airmen’s 
actions in the skies over North Africa, the Mediterranean, Sicily, Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia, 
France, Romania, and Germany dispelled myths, rewrote history, and prepared the USAF for 
being the first of the U.S. Armed Services to integrate racially. 
First African American General in the U.S. Air Force, Benjamin 
O. Davis, Jr. General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. was the commander of 
the famed World War II Tuskegee Airmen. He was also the son of 
General Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., the first black General in the U.S. 
Army. Davis graduated from West Point in 1936 and was 
commissioned as an infantry officer. He was a Reserve Officer 
Training Corp instructor at Tuskegee Institute from 1938 to 1941 and 
became one of the first African Americans admitted to pilot training. 
In 1970, Davis retired as the senior African American officer in the 
U.S. Armed Forces. Upon retirement he organized a special force of sky marshals to help combat 
aircraft hijacking, and in July 1971 he was appointed as Assistant Secretary of Transportation, 
where he remained until he retired in 1975. On 8 December 1998, in a ceremony at the White 
House, President William J. Clinton promoted Davis to the rank of four-star general. 
The First American Volunteer Group. In early 1941, the first American Volunteer Group, 
known as the Flying Tigers, was organized to reinforce Nationalist China’s efforts against 
Japanese invaders. Recruited under U.S. Presidential authority and led by Captain Claire Lee 
Chennault (who eventually rose to the rank of Lieutenant General), the Flying Tigers included 
pilots from the U.S. Army Air Corps, U.S. Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as a few civilians. 
The group of volunteers were officially members of the Chinese Air Force and had contracts with 
salaries ranging from $250 a month for mechanics to $750 for squadron commanders, roughly 
three times what they had been making previously.

The three Flying Tigers squadrons, consisting of the Adam & Eves, 
Panda Bears, and Hell's Angels, maintained around 30 aircraft each. 
The shark-faced nose art of the Flying Tigers remains among the 
most recognizable image of any individual combat aircraft or 
combat unit of World War II. The American Volunteer Group was 
credited with destroying almost 300 enemy aircraft but lost 14 
pilots in combat. In the book, Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and 
His American Volunteers, 1941–1942, the author, Daniel Ford, 
attributes the American Volunteer Group’s success to morale and 
group esprit de corps. He notes that the pilots were triple volunteers 
who had volunteered for service with the United States military, the 
American Volunteer Group, and engaged in brutal fighting in Burma. They were clearly a corps 
of experienced and skilled volunteer pilots who wanted to fight. On 4 July 1942, the Flying Tigers 
were disbanded and replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces. 
Enlisted Pilot Training Program. In June 1941, Congress passed Public Law 99, which 
authorized an enlisted pilot training program. The law permitted enlisted men between ages 18 
and 25 who graduated in the top half of their high school class to apply. By contrast, aviation 
cadets had to have two years of college and be at least 21 years old. Class 42-C, the first class of 
“flying sergeants” graduated as enlisted pilots on 7 March 1942. One half graduated from Kelly 
Field, Texas and the other half graduated from Ellington Field, Texas. All of Class 42-C went on 
to fly P-38s. Subsequent classes were assigned to various types of aircraft in both combat and 
support units. 
Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps. The Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps was created in May 1942 
and within a year became the Women’s Army Corps, which was essentially the women’s branch 
of the U.S. Army. Women served with distinction, replacing men who could then be reassigned to 
combat and other vital duties. What initially began with 800 women in training, eventually rose to 
150,000 during World War II. A top priority assignment for women was to serve at aircraft warning 
service stations. Many others were assigned as clerical and administrative assistants, topographers, 
medical specialists, chemists, and even aircraft mechanics.  
Greatest Female Aviator of All Time, Jacqueline Cochran. 
Jacqueline Cochran is remembered for competing in and winning 
several flying events and performing record-breaking missions 
with regard to altitude, distance, and speed. During World War II, 
Cochran organized efforts for 25 women to fly for Great Britain 
and she was the first woman to fly a bomber across the Atlantic 
Ocean. In 1943, she was appointed to the U.S. Army Air Forces 
and served as Director of the Women’s Air Force Service Pilots 
Training Program. Colonel Cochran received the Distinguished 
Service Medal for her service. In 1971, she was inducted into the 
National Aviation Hall of Fame. Her efforts helped her earn titles, such as “the most outstanding 
woman pilot in the world” and “the greatest female aviator of all time.” In 1975, Cochran was the 
first woman to be honored with a permanent display of her memorabilia at the USAF Academy.

Most Decorated Woman in United States Military History, Lillian K. 
Keil. A pioneer in passenger care, Captain Lillian K. Keil successfully 
combined two careers (flight attendant and flight nurse) to become the 
most decorated woman in our military history. Keil was one of the first 
stewardesses hired by United Airlines when the United States entered 
World War II. She later served in the U.S. Army Air Forces and treated 
wounded and frostbitten crewmen after bombing raids over Europe. 
During World War II, Keil made 250 evacuation flights, 23 of which 
were transatlantic. After World War II, Keil returned to United Airlines as 
an assistant chief stewardess. In 1950, she was called back to duty as a 
flight nurse during the Korean War, amassing 175 air evacuations and logging 1,400 flying hours. 
Overall, it is estimated she attended to more than 10,000 wounded. She was awarded 19 medals, 
including a European Theater Medal with 4 Battle Stars, a Korean Service Medal with 7 Battle 
Stars, 4 Air Medals, and a Presidential Citation from the Republic of Korea. 
2.16. Nazi Suppression 
Operation Argument. Armed with new aircraft, tactics, and superior numbers, Operation 
Argument, otherwise known as Big Week, was launched with the objective of winning air 
superiority and crippling Germany’s aircraft industry. The operation consisted of a series of attacks 
aimed against Nazi Germany from 20 - 25 February 1944. During this time, the 8th Air Force flew 
3,300 heavy bomber sorties, the 15th Air Force added 500 missions from Italy, and the Royal Air 
Force Bomber Command flew 2,750 night attacks aimed at German aircraft manufacturing plants. 
Nearly 4,000 fighter sorties were conducted as protective measures for operational assets. At a 
cost of 226 American bombers, 114 British heavies, and 28 U.S. Army Air Force fighters, 
Operation Argument damaged or destroyed an estimated 500 Luftwaffe fighters and killed 400 
pilots. 
Invasion of Normandy. Although the Luftwaffe managed to replace many downed aircraft, it 
could not replace the 2,262 experienced pilots killed in the five months preceding the invasion of 
Normandy. By 6 June 1944, Allied Air Forces dominated the skies of Europe. On the first day of 
the invasion, widely recognized as D-Day, the Allies directed 8,722 U.S. Army Air Force and 
5,676 Royal Air Force sorties against German defenses in France. In response, the Luftwaffe 
launched fewer than 100 sorties and only two German aircraft inflicted damage on the invasion 
beaches. Clearly, Allied bombers and fighters trumped the German integrated air defense network. 
Combined Bomber Offensive. After the Normandy invasion, the Combined Bomber Offensive 
devastated Germany’s forces. From 1942 to 1945, the Combined Bomber Offensive was the 
longest, bloodiest air campaign in history. According to the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, the 
Allies flew 1.44 million combat sorties and dropped 2.7 million tons of bombs. These missions 
killed and wounded over a million Germans and destroyed 3.6 million buildings. Inevitably, with 
the loss of over twenty percent of its forces, the Third Reich surrendered in May 1945 and General 
Spaatz declared a strategic air war victory against Germany. It was clear that airpower had emerged 
as a dominant weapon in Western Europe during World War II. 
Operation Chowhound. In conjunction with the British humanitarian mission referred to as 
Operation Mana, in May 1945 the U.S. Army Air Forces delivered four thousand tons of food to 
three million Dutch in the German-occupied Netherlands during Operation Chowhound. Ten 
groups of B-17 bombers flew 2,268 sorties, avoiding German anti-aircraft attacks and suffering 
minimal losses.

Notable Bravery and First Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Paul 
W. Airey. In 1944, at the age of 20, Technical Sergeant Paul W. 
Airey and his fellow crewmen were shot down on their 28th mission 
outside of Vienna, Austria. He was held as a prisoner of war for 10 months, 
surviving a 90- day, 400-mile march from the Baltic Sea to Berlin before 
being liberated by the British Army in 1945. During the Korean War, Airey 
served as a radio repairman. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for saving 
more than a million dollars in electronic equipment that would have 
deteriorated without the corrosion control assembly line he developed. 
Airey became the first Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force in 1967. 
Notably, in 1988, Chief Airey received the Air Force Prisoner of War Medal. 
B-17 Named in his Honor, Sator Sanchez. Enlisted personnel served with 
honor throughout World War II. Sergeant Sator “Smilin’ Sandy” Sanchez 
flew 44 missions as an aerial gunner with the 95th Bomb Group, 19 more 
missions than required to complete his tour. After returning home for a brief 
period, rather than accepting an assignment as a gunnery instructor, he 
returned to Europe. Flying with the 353d Bombardment Squadron in Italy, 
Sanchez’s aircraft was hit by ground fire. Nine of the 10-member crew bailed 
out successfully, but Sanchez never made it from the stricken aircraft. The 
raid against the last operational Nazi oil refinery on 15 March 1945 was 
successful, but it cost the life of one of the enlisted force’s most decorated 
Airmen. Sanchez was the only enlisted Airman to have a B-17 named in his honor. 
2.17. World War II Japanese Forces 
The Doolittle Raid. The Japanese forces appeared invincible during the first six months of conflict 
in World War II. However, on 18 April 1942, Lieutenant Colonel James H. “Jimmy” Doolittle led 
16 North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers, launching from the carrier USS Hornet in a 
bombing raid on military targets in Tokyo, Kobe, and Nagoya, Japan. While the Doolittle Raid 
inflicted little damage on Japanese efforts, and unfortunately destroyed almost the entire fleet of 
its own B-25s, the gesture shocked Japanese military leaders and boosted morale for the American 
public. 
Notable Bravery and Doolittle Raider, James Doolittle. General James 
H. “Jimmy” Doolittle’s professional accomplishments are legendary. He 
was an air leader, aeronautical engineer, airplane racer, businessman, 
commanding general, oil-company executive, special assistant to the 
Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and holder of the Medal of Honor. In 
1922, Lieutenant Doolittle flew 21 hours and 19 minutes across the 
United States in a DH-4, with one refueling stop. In 1925, he won the 
Schneider Trophy in an over–water seaplane race when he established a 
world seaplane record at 245.713 miles per hour. In 1929, he was 
awarded the Harmon Trophy for being the first pilot to take off, fly a set 
course, and land using instruments alone. After a break in service, he 
returned to lead the 18 April 1942 Doolittle Raid on Japan. In 1985, U.S. Congress promoted 
Doolittle to four-star general, the first person in the Air Force Reserve’s history to be promoted to 
that rank.

2.18. Atomic Era 
With great power comes great responsibility. Stemming as far back as 1896, when uranium was 
discovered to release an ‘unknown’ radiation, and radioactivity was related to the possibilities of 
atomic energy, the atomic era had begun. The potential uses for atomic energy ranged from nuclear 
medicine to fuel to weaponry. It wasn’t until 1945 that the use of atomic energy was used as a 
nuclear weapon with the intention of putting an end to World War II. 
In July 1945, following a successful atomic test of the first nuclear bomb, Trinity, the Allied 
Powers issued an ultimatum calling for the Japanese government to surrender or suffer “prompt 
and utter destruction.” Within a matter of weeks, specially modified B-29s delivered the first 
operational atomic bombs. On 6 August 1945, the B-29, Enola Gay dropped a uranium bomb 
known as “Little Boy” over Hiroshima. Nearly five square miles of the city were destroyed, and 
80,000 people were killed. Three days later, on 9 August 1945, the B-29, Bockscar, released a 
plutonium bomb called “Fat Man” on Nagasaki. Approximately 1.5 square miles were destroyed, 
60,000 people were severely injured, and 35,000 people were killed. Faced with defeated military 
forces, burned cities, and a declaration of war by the Soviet Union, the Japanese government 
surrendered on 14 August 1945. The use of atomic weapons of mass destruction proved to be an 
effective force in inflicting devastation on an enemy. Note: By June 1946, a United Nations- 
appointed commission completed a plan for the elimination of nuclear weaponry. It was proposed 
that inspectors would travel the globe to ensure no country was making atomic bombs, and to 
supervise the dismantling of existing weapons. Unfortunately, that plan was vetoed by the Soviet 
Union, resulting in almost five decades of the Cold War. 
2.19. Entering the Cold War 
In 1945, British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill; Soviet Premier, Josef Stalin; and American 
President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, met to discuss the postwar division of Europe. The meeting did 
not go well, but it was foundational for the establishment of the United Nations. Although the 
United States and our Western Allies had counted on the Soviet Union as a heroic nation struggling 
with them against Hitler, it was apparent even before World War II ended that the alliance would 
not survive the ideological gulf that separated capitalist democracies from the communist giant. 
After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union aimed at increasing their ideologies 
and influences throughout the world.

2.20. The Final Frontier 
The United States space program originated from the seminal experiments of American engineer 
Robert H. Goddard, whose ideas and early designs were further refined by the rocketry 
advancements of Nazi Germany. In 1944, after eight years of research, German scientists 
successfully launched the world’s first Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile, the V-2 rocket. This 
nascent threat of attack from hundreds of miles away made it clear that future warfare would not 
be limited to only land, sea, and sky. 
At the conclusion of World War II, almost 1,600 of the Nazi’s leading scientists, engineers, and 
technicians, under the direction of German scientist Wernher von Braun, surrendered to allied 
forces and were secretly moved to the United States. During the ensuing of the Cold War with the 
Soviet Union, they continued their groundbreaking work throughout the 1950s under the 
supervision of the United States Army, eventually laying the foundation for American ballistic 
missile technology, satellite development, and later, manned space missions. 
Following the war, Major General Curtis E. LeMay, then Deputy Chief of the Air Staff for 
Research and Development, envisioned space operations to be an extension of air operations. In 
1946, he tasked the Research and Development Corporation to propose a preliminary design for 
an experimental world-circling spaceship - what would later be known as satellites. 
In late 1953, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development convened a 
group of experts known as the Strategic Missiles Evaluation Group, code named the Teapot 
Committee, to examine the field of long-range missiles and accelerate intercontinental ballistic 
missile development. Based on the committee’s recommendations, Air Research and Development 
Command established the Western Development Division to develop and field test intercontinental 
ballistic missiles. On 2 August 1954, Brigadier General Bernard Schriever assumed command of 
the new organization. 
2.21. The Space Race 
While the focus of the late 1940s was the pursuit of rocket research and upper atmospheric sciences 
as a means of assuring American leadership in technology, a major step forward came when 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a plan to orbit a scientific satellite as part of the 
International Geophysical Year (IGY). IGY was a cooperative effort to gather scientific data about 
the Earth for the period of 1 July 1957 to 31 December 1958. 
On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the Sputnik I satellite into earth orbit. 
The Soviet success marked the beginning of the space age and sparked the space race between the 
United States and the Soviet Union. In response to the Sputnik I launch, President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower accelerated civil and military space efforts, a decision that would prove crucial 
throughout the Cold War. To counter the threat of a possible Soviet nuclear attack, President 
Eisenhower made development of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) a national priority. 
By the end of the decade, the Air Force accepted its first long-range Atlas ICBM, followed later 
by the Titan system. 
In 1958, the Air Force developed plans for a manned military presence in space, but President 
Eisenhower reserved manned missions for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
43 
 
 
 
(NASA). However, the Air Force’s plan formed the basis of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo 
Programs. The Space Transportation System, commonly known as the Space Shuttle, was born 
out of a desire by NASA to ferry astronauts to large space stations and a desire of the Air Force to 
put military astronauts into space. 
2.22. Maximizing Space Effects 
Concurrent with efforts to develop long-range missiles, the United States pursued space-based 
technology to reveal credible information on Soviet military intentions and capabilities. Following 
the recommendation of the Research and Development Corporation’s “Project Feedback” Report, 
senior Air Force leaders issued Weapon System Requirement No. 5, directing the development of 
an electro-optical reconnaissance satellite. This new era of space-based platforms was eventually 
broadened to include other missions such as missile warning, space awareness, and battlespace 
characterization. 
To support these new technologies, the Air Force developed the ground-based infrastructure to 
support, augment, and complement the space-based portions of satellite systems. Ground-based 
systems included the ballistic missile early warning system, space object surveillance, and the Air 
Force Satellite Control Network. In addition, the Air Force developed launch ranges necessary to 
get satellites into space – one at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the other at Vandenberg Air Force 
Base, California. Now under the direction of the United States Space Force, these launch bases 
provide support not only for Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored systems, but also for the 
NASA, other U.S. government agencies, and additional commercial enterprises. 
2.23. Space Reconnaissance 
In 1960 the National Reconnaissance Office was formed to take charge of highly classified 
reconnaissance satellites. President Eisenhower undertook several initiatives to help prevent a 
surprise nuclear attack against the United States, including establishing the classified Satellite 
Photo Reconnaissance Program, code named Corona. This system, known publicly as the 
Discoverer Research Program, achieved its first successful launch of the Discoverer XIII on 10 
August 1960. This early success acquired over 3,000 feet of reconnaissance film from space, 
heralding the beginning of America’s space-based photo reconnaissance capability. 
The Air Force concentrated on unmanned missions to fulfill national security needs. Space 
reconnaissance satellites, for instance, supported strategic deterrence throughout the Cold War, 
providing invaluable knowledge of the Soviet Union’s nuclear inventory and verifying compliance 
with weapons control treaties. Space systems provided early warning of ballistic missile attack on 
North America and set the stage for worldwide communications platforms for strategic command 
and control. 
Intelligence collected from space remains essential to United States national security. It is 
foundational to the formulation of foreign and defense policies, the capacity of the President to 
manage crises and conﬂicts, the conduct of military operations, and the development of military 
capabilities to assure the attainment of United States objectives. 
In the early 1990s, space came out of the ‘black world’ of secrecy and into the mainstream military 
during the Gulf War. Warfighters in the Gulf, soldiers in the foxholes, cargo aircraft flying people 
and equipment, and ships at sea, gained greater access to space-based information. This 
information helped military planners see what Saddam Hussein could not see and gave coalition 
forces the high ground to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.

2.24. Global Reliance on Space Capabilities 
Space-based technology revolutionized major aspects of commercial and social activity and will 
continue to do so as the capacity and capabilities of satellites increase through emerging 
technologies. Space enters homes, businesses, schools, hospitals, and government ofﬁces through 
its applications for transportation, health, the environment, telecommunications, education, 
commerce, agriculture, and energy. Much like highways and airways, water lines and electric 
grids, services supplied from space are already an important part of the United States and global 
infrastructures. 
Commercial space activity has become increasingly important to the global economy. Civil 
activity now involves more nations, international consortia, and non-state actors. Space-related 
capabilities help national leaders to implement American foreign policy and, when necessary, to 
use military power in ways never before possible. Because of space capabilities, the United States 
is better able to sustain and extend deterrence to its allies and friends in our highly complex 
international environment. 
In the year 2000, the United States recognized the increasing importance of Global Positioning 
System (GPS) to civil and commercial users by discontinuing the deliberate degradation of 
accuracy for non-military signals, known as Selective Availability. Since that time, commercial 
and civil applications of GPS have continued to multiply, and its importance has increased 
significantly. GPS is now a key component of the United States critical infrastructure. Services 
that depend on GPS are now an engine for economic growth and improved public safety. 
2.25. Space Commission 
In January 2001, a commission headed by then United States Defense Secretary-designate, Donald 
Rumsfeld, warned about a possible “space Pearl Harbor” in which a potential enemy would launch 
a surprise attack against United States-based military space assets, disabling them. The 
commission warned, “The United States is more dependent on space than any other nation. Yet 
the threat to the United States and its allies in and from space does not command the attention it 
merits.” 
Recognizing the importance of space to United States national interests, Congress chartered a 
review of national security space activities. Released in May 2001, “The Report of the Commission 
to Assess United States National Security, Space Management and Organization,” better known 
as the Space Commission Report, found that, “The security and economic well-being of the United 
States and its allies and friends depend on the nation’s ability to operate successfully in space. To 
be able to contribute to peace and stability in a distinctly different, but still dangerous and complex 
global environment, the United States needs to remain at the forefront in space, technologically, 
and operationally, as we have in the air, on land, and at sea. Specifically, the United States must 
have the capability to use space as an integral part of its ability to manage crises, deter conflicts, 
and if deterrence fails, to prevail in conflict.” 
2.26. The Ultimate High Ground 
Over the last decade, space has become competitive, congested, and contested. The opportunity to 
achieve and hold the high ground advantage in space is no longer limited to the United States. 
Many countries either conduct or participate in space programs dedicated to a variety of tasks, 
including communications and remote sensing. The United States will continue to be tested over 
time by competing programs or attempts to restrict United States space activities. 
On 11 January 2007, the world received a wake-up call when China conducted its first successful 
direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) test by destroying one of its own satellites. While there are 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
45 
 
 
 
long-term political and strategic implications to this test, satellites in low Earth orbit such as 
reconnaissance and weather satellites and manned space missions (including the International 
Space Station, space shuttle, and China’s manned flights) became vulnerable to the increase in 
space debris resulting from China’s satellite destruction.  
Due to the technical nature of space operations, the broadening diversity of threats and the 
complexity of the future battlespace and the development of space systems operations, it is 
essential to maintain superiority in the space domain. The space domain and the vertical 
environment is increasingly saturated with ‘near space peers.’ Our ability to operate freely through 
space, recognize when fighting extends to space, exploit space-based effects at a time and tempo 
of our choosing, and dictate the parameters of space access, are all challenged. 
2.27. The Space Imperative 
To come full circle, General LeMay’s 1946 Research and Development Corporation study 
concluded that, “We can see no more clearly all the utility and implications of the space ships 
than the Wright Brothers could see fleets of B-29s bombing Japan and air transports circling the 
globe.” For the next 70 years, our ability to maneuver to and through space has presented 
unlimited potential for prosperity and security, making continued Air Force dominance of the 
space domain a national imperative. 
Throughout the years, space has been a direct contributor to air, land, maritime, and cyberspace 
operations (CO). Space operations are conducted in all domains with terrestrial and sea-based 
platforms, aboard space lift vehicles, via persistent on-orbit constellations, and across the 
electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). That said, in 2017, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson 
told Congress that space no longer is just an enabler and force enhancer for United States military 
operations, it is a warfighting domain just like air, land, and sea. 
In 2018, Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein, doubled down in stating it was, “time 
for us as a service, regardless of specialty badge, to embrace space superiority with the same 
passion and sense of ownership as we apply to air superiority today.” He went on to exclaim, “I 
believe we’re going to be fighting from space in a matter of years. And we are the service that 
must lead joint war fighting in this new contested domain. This is what the nation demands.” 
2.28. The Space Force 
On December 20, 2019, Title 10 U.S.C., Ch. 908, U.S. Space Force Act, 1 January 2021, was 
signed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act by President Donald Trump. This act 
reorganized the Air Force Space Command into the U.S. Space Force and created the first new 
independent military service since the Army Air Forces were reorganized as the USAF in 1947. 
Along with its sister branch, the USAF, the Space Force is part of the Department of the Air 
Force, one of the three civilian-led military departments within the Department of Defense. It is 
the smallest branch within the U.S. Armed Forces with an active-duty end strength of 8,400 and its 
members are called Guardians. 
The USAF, however, originated the concept of a military space force 70 years before the U.S. 
Space Force was created when a visionary Air Force general, who was a physician-scientist, 
created an organization that became vital to the success of NASA’s manned space flight program. 
Dr. Harry Armstrong, who became the Air Force’s second Surgeon General, built his credibility 
as a scientific pioneer upon his earlier contributions to the viability of commercial air travel 
through his development of cabin pressurization. 
Dr. Armstrong did not scientifically subscribe to the old phrase “the sky’s the limit.” He had his 
sights set much higher – space travel. He leveraged his position as commander of the USAF School 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
46 
 
 
 
of Aviation Medicine (USAFSAM) to fulfill a dream. He had conceived the idea of building upon 
technological advances USAFSAM had made in aviation medicine since its inception in 1918 to 
promote the then new field of scientific research – space medicine. 
In 1949, Dr. Armstrong set in motion a juggernaut of scientific and medical 
achievement when he persuaded former German Luftwaffe scientists, 
engineers, and technicians, many of them experts in astrophysics and other 
scientific disciplines, to form the nucleus of the world’s first Department of 
Space Medicine at the USAFSAM at Randolph Air Force Base (AFB) in San 
Antonio, Texas. Recruited under the U.S. government’s post-World War II 
program “Operation Paper Clip”, the former German Air Force scientists were 
instrumental in advancing the concept of manned space travel years before 
NASA was created as the world’s first civilian space agency. Two of them, 
brothers Heinz and Fritz Haber, conceived and designed the world’s first 
space cabin simulator. Built in 1952, the low-pressure chamber was used for pioneering 
experiments to find the most survivable atmosphere for future space travelers confined in a space 
cabin, forerunner of a spaceship capsule. 
In 1955, the Haber brothers sought rudimentary knowledge of one of the then unknowns of space 
travel—microgravity or weightlessness. The Habers conducted preliminary analysis of the 
physiological effects experienced by pilots exposed to short periods of weightlessness. They 
gleaned important data about microgravity’s impact on humans through “weightlessness flights.” 
The Habers had conceived the idea of using Air Force fighters to produce momentary periods of 
weightlessness during parabolic trajectory flight maneuvers executed by F-100 Super Sabre jets 
flown from Randolph AFB. 
One of USAFSAM’s earliest achievements in space medicine development occurred shortly after 
the Soviet Union shocked the world with a milestone space event – having launched into Earth 
orbit Sputnik I on October 4, 1957. The event ushered in the space age and led to ‘the space race’ 
with the United States. Sensing the potential national security threat posed by the Soviets with 
Sputnik, a dramatic American response was required. However, with the U.S. ICBM missile 
program in its infancy, and untested rocket launches not a viable consideration to successfully 
demonstrate vis-à-vis a ‘space event’ to counter what the Soviets had done, the USAFSAM was 
tasked to showcase a space travel experiment based on earlier research. 
USAFSAM scientists came up with a bold idea – use the space cabin 
simulator to simulate sending an Airman volunteer to the moon. To make 
the journey, a human would be confined for the first time in history within 
a research chamber using 100 percent recyclable air. A1C Donald Farrell, a 
22-year-old overly confident and fearless Lackland AFB accounting 
specialist from the Bronx, N.Y., volunteered to become America’s first 
‘space traveler.’ Sequestered inside the two-and-a- half ton, 2x3 foot steel 
low pressure chamber at Randolph AFB, Farrell made the seven-day 
simulated lunar voyage in a device dubbed “Terrella I” (Latin for “Little 
Earth”) in February 1958. Waiting to greet Farrell upon his arrival back to 
Earth was future President Lyndon Johnson.  
The Farrell space expedition made international news and sparked America’s fascination with 
space. It even inspired TV producer Rod Serling to produce a “Twilight Zone” episode based 
upon the Air Force experiment. More important to the Air Force space force that Dr. Armstrong 
had inaugurated, USAFSAM became an important partner with NASA, the latter having been 
created only five months after Farrell’s lunar adventure. For the next 30 years NASA contracted 
Harry Armstrong 
Donald Farrell 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
47 
 
 
 
with the Air Force to support its manned space flight program, culminating with the six moon 
landings (1969-1972). USAFSAM’s Department of Space Medicine became a hub of support to 
NASA’s Project Mercury, an Air Force program that had been appropriated by the space agency 
shortly after the latter’s inception. Project Mercury’s success, and NASA’s subsequent Gemini 
and Apollo programs, would not have been fully achieved without USAFSAM research 
experiments conducted at Randolph AFB and later at Brooks AFB in San Antonio. NASA relied 
on Air Force scientists to test and study the physiological effects of space travel on primates 
before American astronauts could be launched into orbit. Three unknowns of space travel had to 
be addressed: acceleration, microgravity, and radiation. All three were analyzed through 
suborbital flights of America’s first space monkeys. 
Among the first primates trained at Randolph AFB were two rhesus monkeys named after the 
School of Aviation Medicine – “Sam Space” and “Miss Sam Space.” USAFSAM enlisted Airmen 
technicians helped train the monkeys, while “Operation Paper Clip” recruit Dr. Hans-Georg 
Clamman and his team designed and built space flight equipment needed to safely launch primates 
into suborbital flight. They created a cage-like device called a biopack that served a dual purpose: 
it monitored the primate’s physiological functions while confining it inside the nose cone of a 
ballistic missile. In 1959, less than a year after Farrell’s simulated moon trip, USAFSAM’s first 
trained and equipped space monkey had traveled in space aboard a ‘Little Joe’ rocket. 
The Air Force space force that began at Randolph AFB eventually moved to Brooks AFB in 1959. 
The foundational Air Force space medicine work that progressed at Brooks AFB led to White 
House recognition. During his visit to Brooks AFB on November 21, 1963, President John F. 
Kennedy delivered his famous “cap over the wall” speech on space exploration. He credited the 
contributions of Air Force space medicine research that played an integral role in the development 
of NASA’s manned space flight program. 
USAFSAM’s legacy as the Air Force’s inaugural space force was 
recognized by the new U.S. Space Force. In November 2020, U.S. Space 
Force’s first Chief Master Sergeant of the Space Force (CMSSF), CMSSF 
Roger Towberman, visited the Randolph AFB building 661 where the 
world’s first Department of Space Medicine had been headquartered. He 
was curious to see for himself where an Airman spent seven days in 
simulated space on a trip to the moon, and where two monkeys cavorted 
while dressed for success in specially designed space suits made from a 
USAFSAM scientist’s ironing board cover.

3.1. USAF (18 September 1947 – Present) 
Continuing the chronological events leading to our USAF of today and tomorrow, we recognize 
that Airmen have been breaking barriers for over 70 years. With victory in World War II, on 26 
July 1947 President Harry S. Truman signed into law the National Security Act of 1947, which 
created a separate and independent Department of the Air Force. After a century of significant 
advancements in aviation and after 40 years of operating under the U.S. Army, on 18 September 
1947 the USAF was officially established as an independent, equal branch of our military. Under 
the leadership of the first Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Carl A. Spaatz, the Air Force 
clarified roles and missions to meet the challenges of the growing Cold War. 
First Female in USAF, Esther McGowin Blake. In June 1948, the Public 
Law 80-625, Women's Armed Services Integration Act, 12 June 1948, gave 
women permanent status in the Regular and Reserve Forces of all branches 
of the military. On 8 July 1948, Esther McGowin Blake became the first 
woman in the USAF, enlisting the first minute of the first hour of the first 
day that USAF duty was authorized. Although it was not her first experience 
with the military, her driving force for serving was to free a soldier from 
clerical work to fight, with the hopes of ending the war sooner. 
3.2.The Berlin Blockade and Operation Vittles 
On 24 June 1948, the Soviet Union blockaded surface routes between Berlin and the Western 
occupation zones in Germany, exploiting the arrangements under which the United States, Great 
Britain, and France had occupied Germany. The Soviets blockaded railroad and road corridors to 
the 2.5 million residents of West Berlin, located deep within Communist East Germany. 
Two days after the Soviet Union blockade, the Allies worried that an attack against the blockade 
on the ground could precipitate World War III. Instead, an air bridge into Berlin was built, and for 
15 months the 2.5 million inhabitants of the Western sectors of Berlin were sustained by airpower. 
The Berlin Airlift, also known as Operation Vittles, delivered an abundance of supplies, food, 
medicine, and coal on C-47 and C-54 cargo aircraft. More than 2.3 million tons of supplies were 
delivered on over 277,000 flights, which equated to one flight every three minutes. 
When the Soviets finally lifted the blockade, the airlift’s success represented one of the great 
Western victories of the Cold War. The principles of rapid decision-making and adaptability that 
are central to the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop (DAF 8-step Practical Problem 
Solving Model/Method) were certainly demonstrated during the Berlin Airlift. The success of the 
operation was largely due to the ability of the Allied forces to quickly observe the situation, orient 
themselves to the changing conditions, decide on the best course of action, and act effectively to 
sustain the city of Berlin during the Soviet blockade. This process was iterative and continuous, 
which aligns with the OODA loop’s emphasis on agility and responsiveness. The Berlin Airlift 
was arguably airpower’s single-most decisive contribution to the Cold War, unquestionably 
achieving a profound strategic effect through the nonviolent use of airpower and defusing a 
potentially disastrous confrontation.

3.3.  The Korean War 
The Peninsula Divided. In the early 1900s, China had 
political interests in the Korean Peninsula, but through 
the early- and mid-1900s, Korea was ruled by Japan. 
After World War II ended, the Korean Peninsula was 
essentially divided into two fronts: the Soviet Union 
liberated North Korea (the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea) and the United States aligned with 
South Korea (the Republic of Korea). Separated at the 
38th parallel, the North and South Korean governments 
did not settle on an agreement to the terms of the 
separation. The feuding between the two sides escalated 
to a new level when Communist North Korea launched 
a massive invasion on South Korea on 25 June 1950. 
Geographically, Korea was of interest to the United 
States because of its proximity to Japan. Also, the rise 
of Communist parties was of concern that made 
intervention in the Korean War a challenging, yet 
compelling decision. President Truman emphasized the 
importance of the global containment of communism 
and advocated for sending military support in the 
Korean Peninsula. 
Battle of Osan. The United Nations, led heavily by the United States, quickly engaged in support 
of the South while China and the Soviet Union aligned with the North. Battles ensued in Korea 
from June through September in 1950, with severe gains and losses on both sides. The Battle of 
Osan was primarily fought by the U.S. Army in July 1950. Significant losses were experienced 
by the 24th Infantry Division and they were forced to retreat. The ruthless actions of the North 
Korean forces heightened our determination, but with less than adequate weaponry and armor, 
defense of the South only secured 10 percent of the Korean Peninsula. 
Battle of Pusan Perimeter. In August and September 1950, to prevent the North from furthering 
their advance, six weeks of relentless air, land, and sea attacks ran their forces underground, halting 
the Communist invaders in their tracks. Meanwhile, efforts were successful in reinforcing South 
Korea’s forces and supplies to defend the perimeter. By the battle’s end, North Korean forces were 
pushed back at all points along the perimeter. 
Battle of Inchon. In September 1950, President Truman authorized the pursuit of North Korea’s 
Army north of the 38th parallel. During the Battle of Inchon, although both air superiority and 
close air support missions were successful, a lengthy attempt to disrupt Communist supply lines 
by air attack failed. A new strategy of systematic campaigning was applied to inflict prolonged 
economic cost to North Korea and the Chinese forces as long as war persisted. 
Drawing the Line. The initial phase of the Korean War illustrated the dangers of being unprepared 
as Airmen struggled to relearn close air support and interdiction skills. As the Korean War ensued, 
air battles in the skies above Korea challenged our capabilities, but not our resolve. The United 
Nation’s efforts repelled two communist invasions of South Korea, and American airpower 
secured the skies against enemy air attack. Older USAF aircraft were replaced with the much 
needed, more dominating airpower of F-86 Sabre jet-engine fighters that battled over “MiG Alley” 
where superior training and experience prevailed. The Air Rescue Service medically evacuated 
Figure 3.1. The Korean Peninsula

more than 9,600 wounded soldiers and rescued nearly 1,000 personnel shot down over enemy 
territory during the Korean War. The fighting finally ended on 27 July 1953, when an armistice 
was signed. The agreement created the Korean demilitarized zone to separate North and South 
Korea by a strip of land approximately four kilometers (2.48 miles) wide, as shown in Figure 3.1. 
The demilitarized zone still exists today. With no peace treaty signed, the two Koreas are 
technically still at war. 
3.4.  Relief Operations in Mid-1900’s 
Hungarian Relief and Operations Safe Haven I & II. Following the Hungarian Revolution of 
1956, the humanitarian missions Operation Safe Haven I (1956) and II (1957) were initiated for 
Hungarian refugees. The USAF airlifted over 10,000 refugees to asylum who fled from Hungary 
after Soviet forces crushed the anti-communist uprising. 
Chilean Natural Disasters and Operation Amigos Airlift. In May 1960, earthquakes, volcanic 
eruptions, avalanches, and tidal waves ripped through southern Chile, leaving nearly 8,000 people 
dead or missing, 5,500 injured, and more than 240,000 homeless. The Department of Defense and 
State Department agreed to provide humanitarian assistance. During the month-long Amigos 
Airlift, the USAF airlifted over 1,000 tons of material to the stricken area. 
3.5.  Cuban Missile Crisis 
In 1959, Fidel Castro, a communist revolutionary, overthrew the dictator of Cuba, initially 
promising free elections, but instead, instituted a dictatorship. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans 
fled to the United States. In late 1960, President Eisenhower authorized the Central Intelligence 
Agency to plan an invasion using Cuban exiles as troops to overthrow Castro and install a pro- 
U.S. Government. In mid-April 1961, during John F. Kennedy’s presidency, the invasion was 
ordered to proceed. The Cuban exiles landed at the Bay of Pigs and suffered a crushing defeat. The 
Soviet Union almost immediately increased economic and military aid to Cuba. 
In August 1962, photographs from a U-2 aircraft from Strategic Air Command confirmed the 
construction of intermediate- and medium-range ballistic missile complexes on Cuba. Our military 
forces began preparations for an invasion, conducted low-level reconnaissance flights, deployed 
aircraft to numerous bases in Florida, dispersed nuclear-capable B-47 aircraft across the United 
States, and kept B-52 heavy bombers in the air ready to strike. Tensions escalated while President 
Kennedy, his national security advisors, and senior military officials discussed the most effective 
course of action against the Soviet Union. Many on the Joint Chiefs of Staff favored an invasion, 
but President Kennedy chose to impose a naval blockade of the island to prevent more materiel 
from reaching Cuba. Still technically an act of war, the blockade had the advantage of not 
escalating tensions of the Cold War. 
While military preparations continued, the United States agreed not to invade Cuba in exchange 
for removal of Soviet missiles from the island. Secretly, we also agreed to remove American 
missiles from Turkey. The Soviets turned their Cuban-bound ships around, packed up the missiles 
in Cuba, and dismantled the launch pads. As the work progressed, the USAF gradually deployed 
aircraft back to home bases and lowered the alert status. The Cuban missile crisis brought the 
United States and the Soviet Union dangerously close to nuclear war. Our strategic and tactical 
power, coupled with the will and ability to use it, provided the synergy to deter nuclear war and 
convince Soviet leaders to remove the nuclear weapons from Cuba. Note: In the early 1960s, the 
strategic doctrine of mutually assured destruction came to the forefront of national strategy. The 
doctrine was based on the theory that superpower strategic nuclear forces could be sized and 
protected to survive a nuclear attack and retaliate with sufficient force to destroy the other side. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
51 
 
 
 
Such retaliatory destruction was considered to be deterrent under the premise that no rational leader 
would start a nuclear war knowing the result would be nuclear destruction.  
In May 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) 
Treaty. The Treaty entered into force in October 1972 and originally permitted both parties to 
deploy two fixed, ground-based anti-ballistic missile sites. One site could protect the national 
capital, while the second could be located at an ICBM field. Subsequently, a July 1975 protocol 
halved the numbered of permitted ABM sites. The United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty 
in June 2002. 
3.6.  Vietnam Conflict 
The Vietnam Conflict was fought primarily between the North Vietnamese and the South 
Vietnamese over which side would govern Vietnam. North Vietnam, represented by the Viet Minh 
under Ho Chi Minh’s direction, gained support from China and Russia. South Vietnam, supported 
by the French as the official government of the country, was aided by the United States and Great 
Britain. In the 1950s, our involvement in Vietnam began as a cold war operation. The post-World 
War II policy of containment of communism prompted President Harry S. Truman to increase the 
military footprint, thus engaging in the conflict, but not declaring war. 
As offensive air operations increased, USAF presence in Southeast Asia increased even more. 
Airmen performed various duties, including support, combat, and rescue missions. Base Engineer 
Emergency Force Teams, often referred to as Prime BEEF, built revetments, barracks, and other 
facilities. Rapid Engineering Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineer Teams, 
often referred to as REDHORSE, provided more long-range civil engineer services. In addition, 
enlisted personnel served on gunships during the war as aerial gunners and loadmasters. 
Operation Farmgate. In 1961, in response to Communist efforts in Laos and South Vietnam, 
President Kennedy ordered Operation Farmgate. The operation involved the covert deployment of 
the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron (Jungle Jim) to provide training to the South 
Vietnamese Air Force. Flying T-28 Trojans, A-26 Invaders, and A-1E Skyraiders, American pilots 
launched attack missions under the umbrella of combat training. 
Operation Pierce Arrow. In 1964, the North Vietnamese fired on the USS Maddox and USS 
Turner Joy while patrolling in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. Following this incident, the Gulf 
of Tonkin Resolution was passed, authorizing President Lyndon B. Johnson to use conventional 
force in Southeast Asia without requiring a formal declaration of war by Congress. Our advisory 
role rapidly evolved into one of combat operations. The first bombing raids against North Vietnam 
occurred that same year when President Johnson lifted the shroud of secrecy over the operations 
being conducted. As a show of force, the United States orchestrated air attacks against the North 
Vietnamese and Communist forces in Cambodia. 
Operation Flaming Dart I & II. In 1965, the North Vietnamese Viet Cong attacked a small U.S. 
advisory detachment in II Corps, four-and one-half miles north of Pleiku. Moreover, they also 
struck Camp Holloway. The joint assaults killed eight Americans and wounded 104. The United 
States responded with Operation Flaming Dart I, a series of 49 air strikes against various military 
targets in North Vietnam. When the Viet Cong retaliated against the strikes by attacking a hotel 
where Americans were being housed, Operation Flaming Dart II was initiated with additional air 
attacks and reinforced with aircraft launches from three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers. 
Operation Arc Light. From 1965 to 1973, the USAF provided close air support, interdiction, 
reconnaissance, airlift, tanker support, and search-and-rescue capabilities to operations in 
Vietnam. Resources used during Operation Arc Light ranged from one-man Cessna O-1s used by 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

forward air controllers for marking enemy targets for strikers, to mammoth B-52Ds modified to 
drop as many as 27 750-pound bombs and 84 500-pound bombs. During this time, vintage World 
War II aircraft like AC-47 gunships joined the advanced terrain-following radar F-111 state-of- 
the-art platforms. Complementing operations over North Vietnam, this aspect of the air war over 
South Vietnam demonstrated the full-spectrum of airpower. 
Operation Rolling Thunder. In 1965, faced with a deteriorating political and military situation 
in South Vietnam, President Johnson ordered Operation Rolling Thunder as a sign of American 
support to South Vietnam and a signal of our resolve. Operation Rolling Thunder was implemented 
as a measured and limited approach against selected military targets in North Vietnam south of the 
19th parallel. The objective was to destroy the will of the North Vietnamese to fight, destroy 
industrial bases and air defenses, and stop the flow of men and supplies down the Ho Chi Minh 
Trail, while forcing North Vietnam into peace negotiations. In response, North Vietnamese air 
defenses multiplied, as well as their Soviet-made SA-2 surface-to-air missile inventory. Hanoi 
established an advanced radar-controlled air defense system that combined surface-to-air missiles, 
anti-aircraft artillery, and Soviet-produced MiG-17 and MiG-21 interceptors. 
Tet Offensive. In 1968, approximately 70,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces launched 
a coordinated series of fierce attacks on more than 100 cities in South Vietnam. The leader of the 
Communist People’s Army of Vietnam planned the offensive in an attempt to provoke rebellion 
among the South Vietnamese population and encourage the United States to scale back support of 
the Saigon regime. United States and South Vietnamese forces managed to hold off the Communist 
attacks during what is referred to as the Tet Offensive, named for the Lunar New Year (Tet). 
However, heavy casualties were suffered on both sides. News coverage shocked and dismayed the 
American public and further eroded support. North Vietnam achieved a strategic victory with the 
Tet Offensive, as the attacks marked a turning point in Vietnam and the beginning of the 
methodical American withdrawal from the region. 
By the fall of 1968, USAF tactical aircraft and Navy attack aircraft had flown over 300,000 sorties 
over North Vietnam. The enemy downed 526 aircraft, and personnel losses were equally heavy. 
Of the 745 USAF crew members shot down over North Vietnam, 145 were rescued, 255 were 
confirmed killed, 222 were captured, and 123 were classified as missing in action. USAF leaders 
found these results intolerable for an air campaign with virtually complete air superiority. 
Operation Niagara. In 1968, the siege of Khe Sanh displayed the potential of USAF close air 
support. When more than 20,000 North Vietnamese troops, protected by hilly, covered terrain, 
surrounded 6,000 U.S. Marines, the USAF applied massive firepower. A flight of three B-52s hit 
the enemy every 90 minutes for most of the 77-day siege. To prevent the enemy from overrunning 
the base, aircraft dropped 100,000 tons of bombs, two-thirds of those from B-52s. 
3.7.  Vietnamization 
In 1968, shortly after taking office, President Richard M. Nixon announced that a primary goal of 
his administration would be to end the United States combat role in Southeast Asia by helping 
empower the South Vietnamese with equipment and training. He charged the Secretary of Defense 
with making Vietnamization of the war a top priority. In 1969, Nixon initiated a phased withdrawal 
from the frustrating conflict in Vietnam. Dropping from nearly 536,000 troops in 1968, American 
personnel numbered fewer than 100,000 by 1972. As the Vietnamese took over air operations, 
their Air Force grew to become the fourth largest in the world. 
Operation Linebacker. In 1972, taking advantage of reduced American ground presence, 
Communist forces of the National Liberation Front crossed the demilitarized zone in Vietnam. 
President Nixon ordered to have the harbors mined, and peace talks broke down. Nixon resolved 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
53 
 
 
 
to achieve peace with honor, which made reinforcing ground troops politically impossible, so 
Nixon employed Operation Linebacker to blunt the Communist attack. 
Operation Linebacker demonstrated to both the North and South Vietnamese that even without 
significant U.S. Army ground forces, the United States could still influence the war. During 
Operation Linebacker military leaders were able to apply appropriate strategy and tactics with 
significantly reduced restrictions and advantages gained due to improvements in technology. 
Particularly, the acquisition of precision-guided munitions and laser-guided smart bombs 
dramatically increased strike accuracy. On 13 May 1972, 14 F-4 Phantoms hit the Thanh Hóa 
Bridge with 24 smart bombs, destroying a target that had eluded attack for years. From April to 
October 1972, our USAF and Navy aircraft dropped over 155,000 tons of bombs on North 
Vietnamese troops. When North Vietnamese negotiators accepted specific peace conditions, 
President Nixon terminated the air campaign. 
Operation Linebacker II. In December 1972, North Vietnamese resistance to submit to the terms 
of the final peace agreement prompted President Nixon to initiate Operation Linebacker II, an 
intense 11-day air campaign to pressure enemy compliance. Within two weeks, 729 B-52s dropped 
15,000 tons of bombs. Fighter-bombers added another 5,000 tons on industrial targets in North 
Vietnam. Operation Linebacker II succeeded in breaking the deadlock, and negotiations with 
North Vietnamese resumed. A comprehensive ceasefire was signed on 28 January 1973. On 29 
March 1974, the last of our troops left the country. 
Despite the ceasefire, fighting between the North and the South continued until April 22 when the 
President of South Vietnam resigned. During the Vietnam era, airpower demonstrated its 
versatility and wide-ranging impact, as well as its limitations. Despite an impressive military 
showing, the United States did not win decisively in Vietnam. Although the USAF flew more than 
five million sorties and dropped six million tons of bombs, the country of Vietnam was officially 
unified under a Communist regime on 2 July 1976. 
Notable Bravery During Vietnam Conflict, William H. Pitsenbarger. 
William H. Pitsenbarger joined the USAF on New Year’s Eve in 1962. 
After pararescue training in 1965, he reported to Detachment 6, 38th Air 
Rescue and Recovery Squadron, Bien Hoa Air Base, near Saigon, 
Republic of South Vietnam. His leadership referred to him as “one of a 
special breed, alert and always ready to go on any mission.” On 11 April 
1966, Airman Pitsenbarger was aboard a rescue helicopter responding to a 
call to evacuate casualties from an ongoing firefight. When he arrived at 
the site, he descended from the helicopter to coordinate rescue efforts, care 
for the wounded, prepare casualties for evacuation, and ensure the 
recovery operation was smooth and orderly.  
Several times he refused to evacuate and chose to remain with the Army troops on the ground. As 
the battle raged, Pitsenbarger repeatedly risked exposure to enemy fire while pulling the wounded 
to safety, caring for them, and returning fire when possible. During the fight, he was wounded 
three times. When others ran low on ammunition, he gathered ammo clips from the dead and 
distributed them to the living. Having administered aid, he picked up a rifle and joined the soldiers 
to help hold off the Viet Cong. Pitsenbarger was killed by Viet Cong snipers later that night. 
When his body was recovered the next day, one hand still held a rifle and the other clutched a 
medical kit. Nine men escaped the battle alive, thanks to Pitsenbarger’s courage and devotion to 
duty. Pitsenbarger flew almost 300 rescue missions in Vietnam, routinely risking his life to save 
others. He was posthumously promoted as Staff Sergeant Pitsenbarger, and for his bravery and 
sacrifice, he was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross. Also, on 8 December 2000,

Pitsenbarger’s parents accepted the posthumous upgrade to the Medal of Honor from the 
Secretary of the Air Force. Pitsenbarger was the first enlisted Airmen to receive both medals 
posthumously. 
Notable Bravery During Vietnam Conflict, Duane Hackney. Duane 
Hackney flew more than 200 combat missions in three and a half years of 
Vietnam duty. On 6 February 1967, Hackney descended from a HH-3E in 
search of a downed pilot. As he and the downed pilot were being extracted, 
their helicopter took a direct hit from a 37-mm anti-aircraft gun and burst 
into flames. Wounded by shell fragments and suffering third-degree burns, 
Hackney put his own parachute on the rescued pilot and got him out of the 
doomed chopper. Groping through dense smoke, he found an oil-soaked 
chute and slipped it on. Before he could buckle it, a second shell hit the 
helicopter, blowing him out the door, but he survived. In 1973, Hackney left 
the USAF and returned four years later as a pararescue instructor. He retired 
as Chief Master Sergeant Hackney, earned the Air Force Cross, four Distinguished Flying 
Crosses, the Silver Star, the Airman's Medal, the Purple Heart, 18 Air Medals, many for single 
acts of valor, and several foreign decorations. He received more than 70 awards and decorations in 
all, and received the Cheney Award for his actions in 1967, an honor presented for valor or self-
sacrifice. At one point (and often even now), he is referred to as the “most decorated enlisted 
Airman.” 
Notable Bravery During Vietnam Conflict, Richard L. Etchberger. As 
one of the USAF’s most highly trained radar technicians, Richard Loy 
“Dick” Etchberger volunteered for a highly classified mission at Lima Site 
85 in Laos. On 11 March 1968, Etchberger was the crew chief of a radar 
team when North Vietnamese forces overran his site. Under heavy fire, he 
defended his comrades, called in air strikes, and directed an air 
evacuation. When a rescue helicopter arrived, he put himself in the line of 
fire to load three Airmen into rescue slings. Etchberger was rescued after 
putting the other Airmen on the helicopter. While inside the helicopter and 
as they were departing the area, a round went through the belly of the helicopter, striking Etchberger 
and he bled out before they returned to the forward operating base. For extraordinary heroism and 
superb leadership, Etchberger was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross. On 21 
September 2010, Etchberger’s three sons accepted the posthumous upgrade to the Medal of 
Honor from President Barack H. Obama. Chief Master Sergeant Etchberger is the first E-9 in the 
Department of Defense to receive the nation’s highest award. 
Notable Bravery During Vietnam Conflict, John L. Levitow. On 24 
February 1969, flying combat missions as a loadmaster over Vietnam, 
John L. Levitow was handling Mark 24 magnesium flares when his pilot 
threw the aircraft and its eight-man crew into a turn to engage the Viet 
Cong. The AC-47 Skytrain, was jarred by a tremendous explosion and 
bathed in a blinding flash of light when an 82-millimeter mortar shell 
landed on the right wing. Despite 40 shrapnel wounds in his legs, side, and 
back, Levitow rescued a fellow crewmember who was perilously close to 
the open cargo door. When he saw a burning 27-pound magnesium flare 
rolling amid ammunition cans that contained 19,000 live rounds, through a 
haze of pain and shock, and fighting a 30-degree bank, Levitow crawled to the flare, hugged it to 
his body, and dragged himself to the rear of the aircraft. At the instant he hurled it through the 
open cargo door, the flare separated and ignited in the air.

The aircraft returned to base with more than 3,500 holes in the wings and fuselage, one more than 
three feet long. Levitow spent two and a half months recovering in the hospital before returning 
to Vietnam for another tour. He received the Medal of Honor from President Nixon during a 14 
May 1970 Armed Forces Day ceremony at the White House. He was honorably discharged four 
years later as Sergeant Levitow. On 22 January 1998, Air Mobility Command named one of its C-
17 Globemaster III aircraft, The Spirit of John Levitow. Levitow was buried with military 
honors 17 November 2000 at Arlington National Cemetery. He is the lowest ranking Airman 
ever to receive the Medal of Honor for exceptional heroism during wartime. The John L. Levitow 
Award is the top award presented during enlisted professional military education. 
Notable Bravery During Vietnam Conflict, Wayne Fisk. Wayne Fisk 
was directly involved in the famed Son Tay Prisoner of War Camp raid 
and the rescue of the crew of the USS Mayaquez. When the USS 
Mayaquez was hijacked by Cambodian Communist forces in May 1975, 
Fisk was a member of the assault force that successfully recovered the 
ship, the crew, and the entrapped U.S. Marines. Concluding the mission, 
he was recognized as the last American serviceman to engage Communist 
forces in ground combat in Southeast Asia. For his actions, Fisk was 
presented with his second Silver Star. In 1979, he was the first USAF 
enlisted recipient of the U.S. Jaycees 10 Outstanding Young Men of America. In 1986, Chief 
Master Sergeant Fisk became the first director of the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Hall on Maxwell 
Air Force Base-Gunter Annex, Alabama. 
3.8.  The Post-Vietnam Era 
The North Vietnamese captured Saigon in April 1975. The number of operations that ensued 
during the 1960s and 1970s, and the millions of casualties and devastation of the citizens of the 
countries involved, left a sinking void in the lost attempts to contain communism. After the war 
ended, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees required temporary relocation until 
permanent locations could be established. Many of these refugees were resettled in the United 
States. 
Red Flag. The Vietnam-era USAF included many members who entered the ranks during World 
War II. President Nixon ended the draft in 1973 in favor of an all-volunteer American military. 
The USAF attracted recruits and maintained enough Vietnam career veterans to allow significant 
changes, beginning with realistic, more dangerous, combat training. By 1975, training was being 
conducted during Red Flag at the USAF Weapons and Tactics Center, Nellis Air Force Base, 
Nevada. Aircrews flew individual sorties and formations in realistic situations to gain application 
experience before actual combat. Red Flag is credited for revolutionizing USAF training. 
Rebuilding. Post-Vietnam military service rebuilding included the application of technological 
improvements for air campaigns. Plans for the F-15 Eagle, followed soon after by the F-16 
Fighting Falcon, filled the need for highly maneuverable dogfighting aircraft armed with missiles 
and cannons. For conducting deep air attacks, isolating the enemy on the battlefield, conducting 
battlefield air interdiction, disrupting the movement of secondary forces to the front, and providing 
close air support to Army ground forces, the USAF procured the A-10 Thunderbolt. Additionally, 
the United States developed the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter to negate the dangers posed by 
radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles. When the F-117 was operationalized 
in 1980, stealth technology featured special paints, materials, and designs to reduce or eliminate 
aircraft radar, thermal, and electronic signatures. Laser-guided bombs, electro-optically-guided 
missiles, and other precision technologies changed the focus of USAF doctrine from strategic 
bombing to pinpoint bombing through economy of force.

3.9.  Iran Hostage Crisis and Operation Eagle Claw 
In April 1980, Operation Eagle Claw kicked off as an attempt to rescue 52 American hostages 
from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran. The Americans were held hostage for 444 days, from 4 
November 1979 to 20 January 1981 when a group of Iranian students who supported the Iranian 
Revolution took over the U.S. Embassy. In the United States, the hostage crisis united Americans 
to recognize the situation as a threat against diplomacy and ignited a sense of patriotism across our 
country. However, Operation Eagle Claw was ultimately aborted at the request of field 
commanders directly involved in the mission. They experienced too many obstacles and 
mechanical problems with the helicopter fleet for the rescue to be conducted successfully. The 
hostages were eventually released as a result of political negotiations and were returned home to 
the United States. The Iran Hostage Crisis is recognized as the longest hostage crisis in recorded 
history. 
3.10. Grenada Invasion and Operation Urgent Fury 
In October 1983, a military coup on the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada arrested and then 
assassinated Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, imposed a 24-hour shoot-on-sight curfew, and closed 
the airport. President Ronald W. Reagan, who did not want a repetition of the Iranian Hostage 
Crisis, considered military intervention to rescue the 600 American citizens who were attending 
medical school on the island. During Operation Urgent Fury, the bulk of USAF support consisted 
of airlift and special operations units. AC-130 gunships proved their worth repeatedly, showing 
more versatility and accuracy than naval bombardment and land artillery. Several USAF enlisted 
personnel were cited for special achievement and received praise for their efforts. 
The invasion to rescue the students and restore order to Grenada was strongly criticized by several 
countries and was described as a flagrant violation of international law by the United Nations 
General Assembly. However, there was strong public support for the mission in the United States 
and the date of the invasion is celebrated in Grenada annually. The operation resulted in the 
appointment of an interim government, followed by democratic elections in 1984, and has 
remained a democratic nation since. 
3.11. Overthrow of Libya and Operation Odyssey Dawn 
In 1969, a group of junior military officers led by Muammar al-Qaddafi (often spelled Gaddafi) 
overthrew the pro-Western Libyan Arab monarchy. Left virtually unchecked, by the mid-1980s 
Libya had taken several steps toward demonstrating support and sponsorship of worldwide 
terrorism. Qadhafi was involved in subversion; global assassinations of anti-Qadhafi Libyan exiles 
and other adversaries; sponsorship of terrorist training camps within Libya; as well as supply of 
funds, weapons, logistics, and safe haven establishments for numerous terrorist groups. 
With terrorism on the rise at alarming rates, National Security Decision Directive 138 was signed 
on 3 April 1984 by President Reagan to establish a national policy of preemptive and retaliatory 
strikes against terrorists. Unfortunately, despite strong evidence that connected Libya to a number 
of terrorist incidents, the United States did not have sufficient proof to order retaliatory strikes. In 
response, President Reagan chose to impose sanctions against Libya and publicly denounce 
Qadhafi, particularly for sponsoring attacks on the airports in Rome and Vienna, Italy. Two years 
after imposing sanctions, Libya was found responsible for the bombing of a popular discotheque, 
La Belle, in West Berlin. This time President Reagan had the evidence he sought, and he authorized 
air strikes against Libya. Within one week, air strikes were carried out by the USAF, Navy, and 
Marine Corps. Although the raid was supported in the United States, it was almost universally 
“regretted” by our European Allies for fear that it would spawn more violence. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

In 2011, the first Libyan Civil War, referred to as the Libyan Revolution, broke out between 
Qadhafi loyalists and those seeking to remove him from power. Under the United Nations Security 
Council Resolution 1973, in March the United States engaged in Operation Odyssey Dawn, 
implementing a no-fly zone. By the end of March, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO), under Operation Unified Protector, assumed control of the no-fly zone, conducted air 
strikes, and imposed additional actions, such as the arms embargo. Qadhafi was captured and killed 
by the opposing forces of the National Transitional Council on 20 October 2011. Due to continued 
conflict over rival governments, territory, and oil rights, the second Libyan Civil War began in 
2014. A United Nations assisted cease-fire was agreed to in December 2015 that led to a new 
‘unity government’ but with little confidence among its people. The country currently remains 
under the unity government. 
3.12. Panama Canal and Operation Just Cause 
In 1904, the Republic of Panama granted the United States occupation and control of an area 
referred to as the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal is a 40-mile-long canal that connects the 
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The canal was controlled by the United States until joint ownership 
was established with Panama in 1979 under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. In 1983, Central 
Intelligence Agency informant and military dictator, General Manuel Noriega, became the de facto 
Panamanian leader. Noriega continued furnishing information on Latin American drug trafficking 
and money laundering, while at the same time engaging in such activities. 
Noriega’s actions grew increasingly destructive and his relationship with the United States 
deteriorated. President George H.W. Bush decided to take action and invade Panama to safeguard 
the lives of 35,000 American citizens in Panama. Emphasis was also placed on defending 
democracy and human rights in Panama, combating drug trafficking, and protecting the integrity 
of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties. 
In 1989, Operation Just Cause tested air operations in Panama as the largest and most complex air 
operation since Vietnam, involving four branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and more than 250 
aircraft. The USAF primarily airlifted troops and supplies, but also debuted the F-117 Nighthawk. 
On the first night of the operation, 84 aircraft flying 500 feet above the ground dropped nearly 
5,000 troops, the largest nighttime airborne operation since World War II. The organized resistance 
was eliminated in just six days. Manuel Noriega surrendered on 3 January 1990 and was flown to 
Miami, Florida to face a federal grand jury for drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. 
The Panama Canal was fully turned over to Panama on 31 December 1999.

3.13. American-Soviet Relations 
In a 23 March 1983 address, President Ronald W. Reagan proposed replacing the doctrine of 
mutually assured destruction with one of assured survival, through implementation of the Strategic 
Defense Initiative. The Strategic Defense Initiative would include a combination of defensive 
systems, such as space-based lasers, particle beams, railguns, and fast ground-launched missiles 
to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles in the earth’s outer atmosphere and ballistic path in 
space. 
Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Beginning in March 1985, Soviet Communist Party 
General, Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, initiated major changes in Soviet-American relations. The 
United States and Soviet Union signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF 
Treaty) in December 1987. The treaty entered into force in June 1988 and eliminated an entire 
class of weapons, ground launched cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 500-5500 
kilometers. In February 2019 because of Russia’s non-compliance with the treaty, the United 
States declared suspension of U.S. obligations under the INF Treaty, in addition formally 
announcing its intention to withdraw from the treaty in six months. In March 2019, President 
Putin signed Russia’s suspension of the INF Treaty into law. The United States withdrew from 
the INF Treaty in August 2019. 
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties. American nuclear strategy changed significantly in response 
to post-Cold War policies and initiatives. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), signed 
by the United States and the Soviet Union in July 1991, entered into force in December 1994 and 
expired in December 2009. Under START I, the United States agreed to reduce arms to 6,000 total 
warheads on deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine launched ballistic missiles, 
and heavy bombers. The USAF, by presidential direction in September 1991, notified Strategic Air 
Command to remove heavy bombers from alert status. Strategic Air Command was subsequently 
inactivated in June 1992. U.S. Strategic Command replaced Strategic Air Command and assumed 
control of all remaining USAF and Navy strategic nuclear forces. 
START II, signed in January 1993 by the United States and Russia, would reduce total deployed 
warheads up to a range of 3,500 nautical miles, but the agreement never officially went into effect. 
In 1997, START III was initiated, but was never signed due to negotiations breaking down between 
the two countries. The New START Treaty, officially named The Treaty between the United 
States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the further Reduction and 
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, was signed in April 2010, and entered into force in 
February 2011. The treaty was extended for one-time five-year period in February 2021 and will 
expire in February 2026. 
3.14. Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait 
Operation Desert Shield. On 2 August 1990, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein ordered 100,000 
troops to invade oil-rich Kuwait, claiming Kuwait as Iraq’s 19th province. The invasion, with the 
fourth largest Army in the world and an extensive program to develop nuclear weapons, put Iraq 
on the doorstep of Saudi Arabia with vast petroleum reserves. If the Saudis were to fall to Iraq, the 
dictator would then control 50 percent of the world’s oil. The United States sought and received a 
United Nations sanction to act against Iraq and joined 35 other nations to launch Operation Desert 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
59 
 
 
 
Shield. The defensive deployment was an impressive accomplishment. On 8 August 1990, 24 F- 
15Cs landed in Saudi Arabia after departing 15 hours earlier from Langley Air Force Base, 
Virginia. Within one week, C-141 and C-5 transports delivered the Army 82d Airborne Division 
and elements of the Air Force 1st Tactical Fighter Wing to defend Saudi Arabia and the other 
Persian Gulf states against further aggression.  
Less than one month after mobilization, 1,220 Allied aircraft were in theater and combat ready, 
aimed first at deterring Saddam Hussein from aggression against the Saudis, then preparing for a 
counter invasion, if necessary. Operation Desert Shield eclipsed the Berlin Airlift as the greatest 
air deployment in history. Between August 1990 and January 1991, Military Airlift Command 
cargo planes conducted 20,500 strategic airlift missions, delivered 534,000 personnel, and carried 
542,000 tons of cargo to the theater. 
Operation Desert Storm. President George H.W. Bush demanded the immediate withdrawal of 
Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Believing that the American public lacked the stomach for war, for more 
than six months Saddam Hussein alternated between defiance and vague promises of compliance. 
When Saddam missed the final deadline to withdraw his troops from Kuwait, the United States 
lost patience with Saddam’s refusal to cooperate, and initiated Operation Desert Storm. At 0100, 
17 January 1991, three USAF Special Operations MH-53J Pave Low helicopters led nine Army 
Apaches on the first strike mission. Under the command of Lieutenant General Charles A. Horner, 
U.S. Central Command Air Forces, aircraft from 14 countries implemented the master attack plan. 
Within hours, the world watched live television coverage while Iraqi skies filled with anti-aircraft 
artillery fire. 
In response to Iraq’s modified Soviet scud missiles launched against Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the 
Persian Gulf States, the USAF commenced what became known as ‘the great scud hunt’ with a 
fleet of A-10s, F-16s, and F-15Es with low-altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night 
pods. The F-117As struck heavily defended targets with unprecedented precision and successfully 
evaded the sophisticated Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses. A flight of seven B-52Gs flew nonstop from 
Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana to strike Iraqi power stations and communications facilities. 
At 35 hours round-trip, the 14,000-mile raid was the longest combat mission up to that time, and 
proof of America’s global reach. The fleet shattered Iraqi Army morale with massive bomb drops. 
After establishing air dominance and destroying the enemy’s command and control system, 
coalition forces turned their attention to entrenched enemy ground forces, who were evidently 
willing to surrender to the first Allied troops they saw. When one Iraqi commander candidly 
asserted that he surrendered because of B-52 strikes, his interrogator pointed out that his position 
had never been attacked by the B-52. “That is true,” the Iraqi asserted, “but I saw one that had 
been attacked.” 
While coalition ground forces delivered General Schwarzkopf’s famous Hail Mary outflanking 
maneuver that applied the final blow to the Iraqi military forces, airpower set the stage for victory. 
As stated in the Gulf War Air Power Survey, “It was not the number of Iraqi tanks or artillery 
pieces destroyed, or the number of Iraqi soldiers killed that mattered. It was the effectiveness of 
the air campaign in breaking apart the organizational structure and cohesion of enemy military 
forces and in reaching the mind of the Iraqi soldier that counted.” On 28 February 1991, scarcely 
48 hours after the air war ended and the land invasion took center stage, Iraq surrendered to the 
coalition. Despite over 2,700 sorties (22 percent of the strategic air phase), the enemy managed 
to launch 88 scuds, including one that struck a U.S. Army Reserve unit at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 
killing 28 soldiers and wounding 98. Over the course of the air campaign, the coalition flew over 
118,000 sorties, of which the USAF flew 60 percent. In the 43-day war, the USAF was, for the 
first time in modern combat, the equal partner of land and sea power.

Gulf War Space Assets. The Gulf War represented the first extensive, broad-based employment 
of space support capabilities. Coalition forces employed more than 60 military satellites, as well 
as commercial and civil sector systems during the conflict. The defense meteorological satellite 
program provided dedicated meteorological support in theater, which helped facilitate safe, highly 
effective combat power planning and application in a harsh environment characterized by 
sandstorms and oil fires. Satellite-based systems delivered more than 90 percent of all 
communications to and from the theater due to the sheer volume and the lack of ground-based 
infrastructure. At the height of the conflict, 700,000 phone calls and 152,000 messages per day 
flowed over satellite links. 
USAF space assets provided precision positioning and navigation to joint and coalition forces with 
the combat debut of the global positioning system. Space forces also provided advanced Iraqi scud 
launch warnings that gave coalition partners sufficient time to engage the incoming missiles. Space 
force capabilities influenced Israel to remain neutral, thereby preserving the integrity of the 
coalition as well. The Persian Gulf War was the first conflict to highlight the force enhancement 
capabilities of space-based communications, intelligence, navigation, missile warning, weather 
satellites, and precision guided munitions in modern warfare with the joint community. 
Iraqi Kurd Population and Operation Provide Comfort I. In 1991, following the Persian Gulf 
War, Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, attacked the Kurdish population in Northern Iraq. Fearing a 
repeat of the previous threat of brutal suppression, chemical weapons, and massacres by Iraqi 
troops, more than a million Kurds fled to Iran and Turkey and hundreds of thousands more 
gathered on cold mountain slopes on the Iraqi-Turkish border. Lacking food, clean water, clothing, 
blankets, medical supplies, and shelter, the refugees suffered enormous mortality rates. In response 
to the unfolding tragedy, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 688 and 
authorized a humanitarian relief effort. The United States organized and combined a task force for 
Operation Provide Comfort that delivered 7,000 tons of supplies and airlifted thousands of 
displaced Kurds to safety. Operation Provide Comfort officially ended two months after it began. 
Iraqi Kurd Population and Operation Provide Comfort II. Operation Provide Comfort II began 
the day Operation Provide Comfort ended. The primary focus for this operation was to prevent 
Iraqi aggression against the Kurds once they returned to their country. The operation ended 
officially on 31 December 1996 at the request of the Turkish Government who wanted to improve 
relations with Iran and Iraq. To accommodate the request, while still providing support and 
security to the region, Operation Provide Comfort II was followed by Operation Northern Watch, 
which began on 1 January 1997, with the mission of enforcing the northern no-fly zone. 
No-Fly Zones over Iraq and Operations Southern and 
Northern Watch. Operation Southern Watch began on 27 
August 1992 and lasted until 19 March 2003. Operation 
Southern Watch began one day after President Bush announced 
a no-fly zone in Southern Iraq in support of United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 688, to discourage renewed Iraqi 
military activity near Kuwait. The resolution protected Shiite 
Muslims under aerial attack from the Iraqi regime. Operation 
Northern Watch was initiated by President William J. Clinton 
to establish no-fly zones north of the 36th parallel. The 
expansion meant that most of Iraqi airspace fell into no-fly 
zones. Operation Northern Watch lasted until 17 March 2003. 
It officially ended two days before Operation Iraqi Freedom 
began. Figure 3.2. is provided to show the northern and southern no-fly zones.

3.15. Military Support and Humanitarian Relief 
While engaged with the Gulf War, including participation in operations for many years in the 
region following the Gulf War, the USAF was also providing military support and humanitarian 
relief around the world. 
Bay of Bengal Typhoon and Operation Sea Angel. In addition to the Gulf War, the USAF 
performed a number of humanitarian missions to various countries around the world. In 1991, a 
typhoon swept over Bangladesh with thunderstorms and winds of up to 150 mph, causing damages 
estimated to be $1.5 billion. The typhoon caused a 20-foot storm surge over the country, killing 
138,000 people and destroying homes of more than 10 million others. In response to the 
devastation, the Airmen, Marines, and Sailors, delivered 3,000 tons of supplies to Bangladesh 
during Operation Sea Angel. 
Soviet Union Support and Operation Provide Hope. Operation Provide Hope began in 1992. 
The former Soviet Union was transitioning from a Communist country to a capitalist nation that 
left much of its population struggling for survival. Not only were people living in the capital cities 
suffering, but there was also dire need of support in the outlying cities as well. The Operation 
Provide Hope airlift mission lasted approximately two weeks, with the ongoing efforts of helping 
build sustainable medical services lasting almost two years. The operation ultimately provided 
25,000 tons of food, medicine, and other cargo to the former Soviet Union. 
Somalia Relief and Operation Provide Relief. In 1992, unrest in the wake of a two-year civil 
war contributed to a famine in Somalia that killed up to 350,000 people. As many as 80,000 
refugees fled the stricken country. The United Nations led a relief effort in July 1992 to address 
the suffering of refugees near the Kenya-Somalia border and in Somalia itself. The United States 
initiated Operation Provide Relief two months later. By December, 19,000 tons of food were 
airlifted into the region, often under the hail of small arms fire. Civil war and clan fighting 
prevented much of the supplies from getting into the hands of those who desperately needed them. 
Somalia Relief and Operations Impressive Lift & Restore Hope I. In September 1992, to 
address the issues of famine in Somalia, the United States initiated Operation Impressive Lift to 
airlift hundreds of Pakistani soldiers under the United Nations banner to provide aid in Somalia. 
Despite efforts and increased security from the United Nations, the problems continued. On 4 
December 1992, President Bush authorized Operation Restore Hope to establish order in Somalia 
so that food could reach those in need. With U.S. Marines on the ground and with control of the 
airport, flights were able to resume. During Operation Restore Hope, we airlifted 32,000 of our 
troops into Somalia. By 4 May 1993, fewer than 5,000 remained when it officially ended. 
Somalia Relief and Operation Restore Hope II. After Operation Restore Hope ended, factional 
fighting within Somalia continued, causing relief efforts to unravel yet again. On 3 October 1993, 
U.S. Special Forces, to capture members of a dangerous, disruptive clan, returned to Somalia. The 
team lost 18 personnel and suffered 84 wounded. In response, during Operation Restore Hope II 
we airlifted 1,700 of our troops and 3,100 tons of cargo into Mogadishu between 5 and 13 October 
1993 to stabilize the situation. President Clinton refused to commit the United States to nation 
building and Operation Restore Hope II officially ended 25 March 1994 when the last C-5 departed 
Mogadishu. While Operation Restore Hope II allowed our troops to get out of the country without 
further casualties, anarchy ruled, and the threat of famine remained in Somalia.

Notable Bravery in Somalia, Timothy A. Wilkinson. In the late 
afternoon of 3 October 1993, Timothy A. Wilkinson, a pararescueman 
with the 24th Special Tactics Squadron, responded with his crew to the 
downing of a UH-60 helicopter in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia. 
Wilkinson was repeatedly exposed to intense enemy small arms fire 
while extracting the injured and mortally wounded from the crashed 
helicopter. Despite his own injuries, he provided life-saving medical 
treatment to the crewmembers, then turned to the ranger security 
element engaged in an intense firefight across an open four-way 
intersection from his position where he began immediate medical treatment. His personal 
courage and bravery under heavy enemy fire were integral to the success of all casualty treatment 
and evacuation efforts conducted in the intense 18-hour combat engagement. Master Sergeant 
Wilkinson was awarded the Air Force Cross for his heroic actions. 
Eastern Europe Stabilization and Operation Provide Promise. Leading up to the initiation of 
Operation Provide Promise, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, coupled with the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union itself, dissolved the political bind that tied ethnically diverse 
Yugoslavia as a single nation. Roman Catholic Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence 
from the Yugoslav Federation that was dominated by Eastern Orthodox Serbia. In early 1992, 
predominantly Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina (Bosnia) also severed ties with the Federation. 
Fearing their minority status, Serbs within Bosnia reacted by enforcing their ethnic state, seizing 
territory, and besieging the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. In July 1992, the United States became 
involved with the United Nation’s efforts in Operation Provide Promise. C-130 crews on 3-week 
deployments flew out of Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany to deliver food and medical supplies to 
the region. The effort was supported by 15 additional countries also airlifting relief supplies to 
Sarajevo. Briefly, to supplement efforts, Operation Provide Santa kicked off in December 1993 
when C-130s dropped 50 tons of toys and children’s clothing and shoes. On 14 December 1995, 
warring factions signed peace accords at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, calling for an 
end to humanitarian air-land deliveries into Sarajevo. During Operation Provide Promise, aircraft 
supporting the United Nation’s relief operation withstood 279 incidents of ground fire and was the 
longest running humanitarian airlift in history, lasting over three and a half years. 
War in Bosnia and Operation Deny Flight. On 12 April 1993, Operation Deny Flight began as 
a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) effort to limit the war in Bosnia through imposition 
of a no-fly zone over the country and served to provide close air support for United Nation’s troops 
in Bosnia. The mission faced challenges, particularly when Bosnian Serbs took lightly armed 
United Nation’s forces hostage to use as leverage against continued airstrikes. The United Nations 
agreed to veto further strikes on the Serbs, but the mission was still taking strikes from Serb 
aggressors. Operation Deny Flight ended on 20 December 1995, bringing a close to the 100,000 
sorties flown in efforts of ending turmoil in the region. 
Haitian Control and Operation Uphold Democracy. On 8 September 1994, the United States 
launched Operation Uphold Democracy to remove the military regime that had overthrown Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The U.S. Atlantic Command developed two different plans, one 
for forcible entry and the other for passive entry. While USAF planners worked through variations 
of both invasion strategies, an aerial force of more than 200 aircraft were activated to bear an 
overwhelming force of strength, if needed. At nearly the last minute, a diplomatic proposal offered 
by former President James E. Carter, persuaded the military leader in Haiti to relinquish control. 
This move allowed the mission to be implemented as an insertion of a multinational peacekeeping 
force and application of the passive-entry plan. The successful adaptation to airlifting 
peacekeeping troops was a major indicator of the flexibility airpower offers military and political

leaders in fulfilling foreign policy objectives. U. S. Air Force involvement effectively ended 12 
October 1994. Three days later, the Haitian President returned to his country. 
Kuwaiti Border Protection and Operation Vigilant Warrior. In October 1994, Iraqi troops, 
including the elite Iraqi Republican Guard, massed at the Kuwaiti border. Saddam Hussein had 
begun aggressive posturing for power once again. The United States responded with Operation 
Vigilant Warrior. Thousands of additional U.S. Armed Forces personnel entered into the theater. 
As a result of the American response, Kuwait was not invaded, and Iraq recalled its ground forces 
away from the border. Operation Vigilant Warrior officially ended on 15 December 1994. 
Bosnian Serb Attacks and Operation Deliberate Force. In 1995, after a mortar shell killed 37 
civilians in Sarajevo, Operation Deliberate Force served notice to Bosnian Serb forces that they 
would be held accountable for their actions. Operation Deliberate Force airstrikes were launched 
against Bosnian Serb targets throughout the country. This was the first campaign in aerial warfare 
where precision munitions outweighed conventional bombs. The incessant air campaign garnered 
the desired results. Operation Deliberate Force played a key role in ending the war in Bosnia. On 
14 September that same year, the Serbs agreed to NATO terms and the bombing stopped. 
Operation Deliberate Force officially ended on 21 September 1995. 
Kurd Genocide Protection and Operation Desert Strike. In August 1996, Saddam Hussein 
ordered an attack on the city of Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan. This attack stoked American fears of a 
genocidal campaign against the Kurds, similar to the campaigns of 1988 and 1991. It also placed 
Saddam in clear violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, forbidding 
repression of Iraq’s ethnic minorities. Operation Desert Strike launched a series of strikes against 
Saddam. In that same timeframe, Operation Pacific Haven, often referred to as Operation Quick 
Transit, began a multi-stage effort to provide airlift for as many as 7,000 displaced Kurds to safe 
areas. 
Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction and Operation Desert Fox. Operation Desert Fox was a 
four-day bombing campaign in 1998, directed at facilities in Iraq believed to be used to produce 
weapons of mass destruction. The strike was initiated as a result of Saddam Hussein’s resistance 
to comply with United Nations Security Council and the inspection teams. Operation Desert Fox 
was the largest strike against Iraq in several years. Criticism was received on several accounts as 
to the extent, methods, intentions, and outcomes of the attack. Ultimately, the highly effective 
actions taken during the operation were deemed to be a success. 
Serb Ethnic Violence Prevention and Operation Allied Force. After the post-Cold War breakup 
of Yugoslavia, the Serbian government’s gradual oppression over the ethnic Albanian population 
for almost a decade eventually escalated to violence and mass killings. The international 
community began to negotiate with Serbian leaders in the spring of 1998 for a solution acceptable 
to all parties. The Serbs, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, considered the matter an internal 
one. A final effort to negotiate a settlement began in January 1999 at Rambouillet, France, but 
talks broke down soon after. When diplomacy failed, NATO worried about the possibility of a 
genocidal civil war and destabilization throughout the Balkan region in southeastern Europe. When 
President Milosevic unleashed a ruthless offensive designed to crush the Kosovo Liberation Army 
and drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo, the Allies, faced with a massive humanitarian crisis, 
turned to airpower. 
Operation Allied Force began on 24 March 1999 to force Serbia to accept terms to end the conflict 
in Kosovo and prevent a repeat of the ethnic cleansing that took place in Bosnia. The operation 
was initiated with three objectives: demonstrate opposition to aggression; deter Milosevic from 
escalating attacks on civilians; and damage Serbia’s capability to wage war against Kosovo. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

Unfortunately, Milosevic’s resolve was underestimated. What was believed to require a few days 
of airstrikes turned out to take 78 days, with 30,018 sorties to secure the objective. The primary 
factors that led to the conclusion of the operation were unity and resolve. The lesson was clear to 
Milosevic that NATO was tough and became progressively tougher throughout the campaign. 
The precision and persistence of the air campaign was fundamental in convincing Milosevic to 
end the fight.

3.16. Terrorist Attacks 
Khobar Towers. During the night of June 25, 1996, the 
bombing of building 131 in the Khobar Towers, Figure 3.3., 
complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia marked the 1st time that 
the USAF was directly targeted by terrorists and was the first 
time that the DoD issued purple hearts for a non-combat area. 
19 Airmen were killed (2 officers and 17 enlisted) and 
hundreds were injured. Unfortunately, this heinous attack 
wouldn’t be the last. 
Operation Noble Eagle. Terrorism 
struck home on 11 September 2001 
in a planned attack by Islamic 
extremists when Al Qaeda terrorists 
hijacked four airliners flying in 
United States airspace. Two aircraft 
were flown into the towers of the 
World Trade Center, one was flown 
into the Pentagon, and the fourth 
crashed in a remote field in 
Pennsylvania. Thousands of people 
were injured in those events, and 
2,996 people died, including the 19 
hijackers. In response, President 
George W. Bush declared a global war on terrorism. Figure 3.4. is provided to show the timing of 
each of the four attacks. 
These unprecedented acts of violence left thousands dead, thousands more grieving, and a nation 
unsure of its future vulnerabilities. One thing that was for certain was the depth and scope of radical 
Islamic hatred. The United States immediately focused on protecting our homeland from both 
internal and external air attacks, and fighter aircraft began flying combat air patrols in the skies 
over America in support of Operation Noble Eagle. Thousands of National Guard and Reserve 
personnel were mobilized to protect military and civilian assets, including airports, military 
installations, and infrastructure. USAF fighter, tanker, and surveillance air assets provided 24-hour 
intercept response coverage for virtually the entire country. 
Months later, North American Aerospace Defense Command, with more than 100 Air National 
Guard, USAF Reserve, and RegAF fighters from 26 locations, continued to monitor American 
airspace. Across the globe, nations offered support and solidarity as Americans tried to regroup 
and move forward in the aftermath of the events of 9/11(the attacks are colloquially referred to as 
“9/11”). Examples of bravery and sacrifice continue to circulate to this day of service members 
and civilians rescuing comrades from burning buildings, fighting fires, providing medical 
attention, comforting survivors, and volunteering to do whatever they could after the tragedy 
occurred.

3.17. War on Terror – Afghanistan 
Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, the United States reported that Osama bin Laden was 
behind the worst terrorist attacks in world history. President Bush demanded that the Taliban, 
Afghanistan’s ruling government, deliver all leaders of al-Qaeda to the U.S. Government, release 
all imprisoned foreign nationals, immediately close all terrorist training camps, hand over all 
terrorists and supporters to authorities, and allow inspectors full access to terrorist training camps. 
When the Taliban refused, President Bush ordered military forces to the region. 
Operation Enduring Freedom. Operation Enduring Freedom took the fight against terrorism to 
foreign soil, most notably to locations where terrorist organizations existed in Afghanistan. 
Operation Enduring Freedom was focused on forming and acting with an international coalition to 
remove Afghanistan’s Taliban government. The coalition primarily included forces from the 
United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan, Jordan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Spain, Turkey, 
and other nations. 
The United States sent approximately 350 aircraft to Afghanistan. Several B-1 and B-52 bombers, 
F-15 and F-16 fighters, special operations aircraft, RQ-1B and RQ-4A unmanned aerial vehicles, 
and Navy fighters deployed to bases throughout the country. On 7 October 2001, following 
continued Taliban refusal to hand over suspected terrorists, United States, British, and French 
aircraft began a sustained air campaign against terrorist targets in the country. Operation Enduring 
Freedom strikes began with USAF bombers, Navy carrier-strike aircraft, and sea-launched 
Tomahawk cruise missiles. The USAF B-52 bombers flew to engagement zones where ground- 
based forces directed attacks. Guided munitions were employed with great accuracy, enabling air 
planners to reduce the number of air sorties required to destroy a particular objective. In the 
opening days of the campaign, joint and combined efforts destroyed Taliban air defenses, 
command centers, and other fixed targets. 
Combat operations in Afghanistan began with small groups of elite American military forces 
deployed to support anti-Taliban Afghani fighters. Afghanistan’s rugged terrain, complex political 
relationships, and distance from operating bases challenged coalition forces. USAF combat 
controllers were among the 300 Army, Navy, and USAF special operations personnel augmenting 
the Afghan Northern Alliance. In November 2001, coalition forces took control of Kabul, 
Afghanistan’s capital. The Taliban resistance began to collapse, and in December 2001, Kandahar 
was abandoned, the last major town under Taliban control. Terrorist forces were run underground, 
but not eliminated, causing ongoing, extended counterinsurgency operations. In addition to being 
a combat operation, Operation Enduring Freedom served as a humanitarian mission. Service 
members provided humanitarian relief by dropping nearly 2.5 million rations to the oppressed 
Afghan people. 
Operation Enduring Freedom Expands. In January 2002, 1,200 members of U.S. Special 
Operations Command, Pacific were deployed to the Philippines to assist the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines in uprooting al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, such as Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu 
Sayyaf. The mission was to assist military operations against terrorist forces as well as support 
humanitarian operations for the Philippine island of Basilan, where most of the conflict was 
expected to take place. One American hostage was recovered during the mission, and the Abu 
Sayyaf Group was reduced from 800 to 100 members. Efforts from this engagement created 14 
schools, 7 clinics, 3 hospitals, and provided medical care to over 18,000 residents of Basilan. 
War on Terrorism in Africa. Attention was turned to the Horn of Africa in mid-2002, focused 
on disrupting and detecting terrorist activities in the region. The mission included humanitarian 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
67 
 
 
 
efforts for rebuilding schools and medical facilities, as well as training local forces in 
counterterrorism and counterinsurgency tactics throughout Djibouti, Kenya, and Ethiopia. 
Operation Anaconda. On 2 March 2002, Operation Anaconda was launched as one of the most 
crucial joint combat operations, designed to remove the Taliban resistance from Afghanistan. 
Operation Anaconda, conducted in the Shahikot Valley, was a complex battle fought in rugged 
mountainous terrain under difficult conditions. In the early morning hours, on a mountaintop called 
Takur Ghar in southeastern Afghanistan, al Qaeda soldiers fired on an MH-47E helicopter. The 
strike on the helicopter caused a Navy SEAL, Petty Officer First Class Neil C. Roberts, to fall 
through the open helicopter door to the ground. A chain of events followed during a 17-hour ordeal 
culminating in one of the most intense small-unit firefights of the war against terrorism. The press 
referred to Operation Anaconda as the battle at Shah-I-Kot Mountain, but the men who fought 
there called it the battle of Robert’s Ridge. 
U.S. Armed Forces involved in this fight distinguished themselves by conspicuous bravery. Their 
countless acts of heroism demonstrated America’s best as USAF, Army, and Navy special 
operators fought side by side, and in the process, secured the mountaintop and inflicted serious 
loss on al Qaeda. Operation Anaconda ended as an American victory, but not without the ultimate 
sacrifice of eight Americans and 80 wounded. The difficult early stages of the battle provided 
insights for thinking about how to organize, train, and equip military forces for future joint 
expeditionary operations and how to pursue transformation. 
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Jason D. Cunningham. In 2002, 
Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham was the primary USAF combat 
search and rescue medic, pararescueman assigned to a quick reaction force 
tasked to rescue two American servicemen from austere terrain occupied by 
Al Qaeda and Taliban forces. Shortly before landing near the village of 
Marzak, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, on 4 March Cunningham’s MH-
47E helicopter took rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire, severely 
disabling the aircraft. The assault force formed a hasty defense and the team 
immediately suffered three fatalities and five critical casualties. Facing 
enemy fire, risking his own life, Cunningham remained in the burning 
fuselage to treat the wounded. He moved his patients to a more secure 
location under mortar attack, disregarding extreme danger and exposing himself to enemy fire on 
seven separate occasions. When the second casualty collection point was compromised, 
Cunningham braved intense small arms and rocket-propelled grenade attacks to reposition the 
wounded to a third collection point. Mortally wounded and quickly fading, he continued to direct 
patient movement while transferring responsibilities to another medic. His selfless efforts resulted 
in the delivery of 10 gravely wounded Americans to life-saving medical care. The Secretary of 
the USAF posthumously awarded Senior Airman Cunningham the Air Force Cross for his 
extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force. 
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, John A. Chapman. On 4 March 2002, 
during Operation Anaconda, after being fired upon by al Qaeda and losing 
a Navy SEAL, John A. Chapman’s MH- 47E helicopter landed just under 
five miles away. Once on the ground, Chapman provided directions to 
another helicopter to pick them up, successfully rescuing their mission team 
member from the enemy stronghold. Chapman killed two enemy soldiers, 
and without regard for his own life, kept advancing toward a dug-in 
machinegun nest when the team came under fire from three directions. 
Chapman exchanged fire from minimal personal cover and succumbed to 
Jason D. Cunningham 
John A. Chapman

multiple wounds. His engagement and destruction of the first enemy position and advancement to 
the second enabled his team to take cover, break enemy contact, and save the lives of the entire 
rescue team. On 10 January 2003, the Secretary of the USAF posthumously awarded the Air Force 
Cross to Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman. On 22 August 2018, Chapman’s widow accepted 
the posthumous upgrade to the Medal of Honor from President Donald J. Trump. Chapman is 
the first USAF member to receive this award since the Vietnam Conflict. 
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Anissa Shero. Air Commando Anissa 
Shero served as a loadmaster aboard an MC-130 Combat Talon II, call sign 
Chariot-55, during Operation Enduring Freedom. On June 12, 2002, 
Chariot-55 was tasked with extracting a three-man U.S. Special Forces 
team from a dirt runway near the village of Sardeh Band, Afghanistan. 
Once on the ground, Shero, and fellow loadmaster Sean Corlew, both from 
the 15th Special Operations Squadron, performed an engine-running on-
load of the team and equipment. After an aborted takeoff attempt, Shero 
discovered two soldiers unrestrained and told them to buckle up. Shortly 
after, the aircraft took off again, this time crashing. Shero, Corlew, and 
U.S. Army Sergeant First Class Peter Tycz died. The two soldiers that 
Shero assisted both survived. She was the first female casualty in Operation Enduring 
Freedom/Afghanistan. 
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Kevin Whalen. On 19 July 
2003, Kevin Whalen, a Tactical Air Control Party Terminal 
Attack Controller was supporting an Afghan and U.S. combat 
patrol in the Gayan Valley, Afghanistan. The patrol was hit in 
a well-coordinated ambush. Whalen returned effective fire with 
an automatic grenade launcher and remained exposed to enemy 
fire while allowing the rest of the team to take cover. When the 
grenade launcher was hit and damaged, Whalen remained at his 
post and attempted to fix the launcher. He was hit three times. 
One bullet hit his body armor, another his Gerber tool, and the third struck him in the left arm. 
Whalen dropped out of the turret, began first aid to stop the bleeding, and recovered his radio to 
call in close air support. When the engagement was over, Whalen insisted that all other wounded 
be evacuated first. After two days in the hospital, he returned to his team to continue combat 
missions. For his actions, Technical Sergeant Whalen was awarded the Silver Star.  
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Ramon Colon-Lopez. Ramon Colon-
Lopez, a pararescueman, was deployed to Afghanistan on 11 March 2004, 
as part of an advanced force operations team serving alongside elements 
of the Afghan national strike unit. The mission was to capture a high- 
value target (a drug king-pin who was funding terrorism) and prevent the 
proliferation of chemical weapons. While conducting operations, Senior 
Master Sergeant Colon-Lopez was on the first of four helicopters that took 
sustained small-arms fire and was seriously damaged as they landed. With 
rounds impacting all around him and unsure of the size of the enemy force, 
he pressed forward, overrunning enemy positions. His actions suppressed 
enemy fire against the other three helicopters and drove the enemy away. The raid resulted in two 
enemy kills, 10 enemy apprehensions, and the destruction of rocket-propelled grenades and 
small caliber weapons. As a result of his actions, Colon-Lopez received the Bronze Star with Valor 
and became one of the first six recipients of, and only Hispanic American, to earn the Combat 
Action Medal. He was later promoted to Chief Master Sergeant and served in several leadership

positions, culminating in 2019 as the fourth Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. 
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Robert Guiterrez. Robert 
Guiterrez, deployed to Heart Province, Afghanistan as a combat 
controller assigned to an Army Special Forces Detachment. On 5 
October 2009, Gutierrez and his team conducted a high-risk nighttime 
raid to capture the number two Taliban leader in the region. During the 
initial assault, the team was attacked with a barrage of rifle and heavy 
machine-gun fire from a numerically superior and determined enemy 
force. Gutierrez was shot in the chest, his team leader was shot in the 
leg, and the ten-man element was pinned down in a building with no 
escape route. In great pain and confronting the very real possibility that he would die, Gutierrez 
seized the initiative and refused to relinquish his duties as joint terminal attack controller. Under 
intense fire, he engaged Taliban fighters with his M-4 rifle and brought airpower to bear, 
controlling three “danger close” A-10 strafing runs with exceptional precision against enemy 
forces just 30 feet away. After the first A-10 attack, the team medic performed a needle 
decompression to re-inflate Gutierrez’s collapsed lung, allowing him to direct the next two strafe 
runs which decimated the enemy force and allowed the team to escape the kill zone without 
additional casualties. Throughout the four-hour battle, Gutierrez’s valorous actions, at great risk 
to his own life, helped save the lives of his teammates and dealt a crushing blow to the regional 
Taliban network. For this action, Guiterrez was awarded the Air Force Cross. 
3.18. Afghanistan Troop Withdrawal 
In 2011, at the height of American involvement in Afghanistan, 101,000 service members were 
deployed to the country. In June 2013, Afghan forces formally took over combat operations. At 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) 
Headquarters in Kabul, a ceremony marked the end of ISAF’s mission and the transition to the 
NATO-led Resolute Support. For most, the war in Afghanistan came to an end in 2014. 
Throughout Operation Enduring Freedom, 7 October 2001–28 December 2014, coalition 
casualties totaled 3,486. Taliban and Al-Qaeda casualties ranged from 25,500 to 40,500. The troop 
withdrawal/declared end to war in Afghanistan happened on 31 August 2021. 
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Delorean Sheridan. In March 2013, 
Delorean Sheridan was completing a routine pre-brief for a combat control 
mission at his deployed location in Wardak Province, Afghanistan. While 
his team loaded gear into their vehicles, an Afghan police officer suddenly 
turned and opened fire with a truck-mounted machine gun 25 feet away. 
Simultaneously, 15 to 20 insurgents just outside the village engaged the 
base with heavy machine gunfire. With rounds striking and killing his 
teammates, Sheridan closed in on the gunman with a pistol and an M-4 
Rifle, neutralizing the immediate threat with deadly accuracy. Still under 
heavy attack from outside insurgents, Sheridan exposed himself to heavy machine gunfire 
three more times to drag his wounded teammates out of the line of fire to a protected casualty 
collection point. Sheridan directed close air support and surveillance aircraft to pinpoint, engage, 
and eliminate additional insurgents, and directed the entrance and exit of six medical evacuation 
helicopters. Sheridan’s calmness and leadership in the face of danger helped save 23 lives. For 
these actions, Technical Sergeant Sheridan was awarded the Silver Star. He also received one 
of the USAF’s most prestigious awards, the 2013 Lance P. Sijan USAF Leadership Award. 
Lastly, he was selected as one of the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year for 2014.

Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. After the deadline for troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, 
roughly 300 American Airmen stayed in Afghanistan to carry out operations against remnants of 
Al Qaeda and help stand up the Afghan Air Force. In 2015, combat operations of Operation 
Enduring Freedom were replaced by Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. Working with NATO’s 
Operation Resolute Support, 28 NATO nations, 14 partner nations, and 11,000 American troops 
continued the mission of training, advising, and assisting the Afghan Air Force to help it become 
fully independent. 
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Alexey Germanovich. Alexey 
Germanovich, a Joint Terminal Attack Controller, was deployed to 
the Nangarhar Province of Afghanistan as a part of the Afghanistan 
Combined Joint Special Operations Air Component. On the morning 
of 8 April 2017, Germanovich and his team came under intense 
machine gun and sniper fire. A ferocious firefight ensued, enveloping 
friendly forces with countless enemy fighting positions as insurgents 
continued to reinforce from all sides of the valley. Without hesitation, 
he deliberately placed himself in grave danger by sprinting towards 
his isolated teammates, traversing 70 meters of open terrain and a 
fusillade of machine gun fire. He directed multiple strafing runs, with 500-pound and 2,000-pound 
bomb strikes as close as 90 meters from his position. As his team member was mortally wounded, 
Germanovich placed himself between the enemy and the pinned down friendly forces, protecting 
them with his body and employing his own suppressive fire. As the team’s ammunition 
dwindled, Germanovich directed close air support as close as 20 meters from his position, 
neutralizing the enemy. Finally, he coordinated a medical evacuation of helicopters to extract the 
wounded and helped carry a Soldier 700 meters uphill to the landing zone as he continued to call 
for close air support. His actions directly resulted in the protection of over 150 friendly forces and 
the lethal engagement of 11 separate fighting positions. As a result of his actions, Alexey 
Germanovich was awarded the Air Force Cross. 
Notable Bravery in Afghanistan, Daniel Keller. Daniel Keller, a Joint 
Terminal Attack Controller attached to a combined joint special operations 
assault force at Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. On 16 August 2017, 
Keller embarked on a clearance operation against 350 Islamic State 
fighters. After fifteen hours of sustained contact, the assault force struck a 
house-borne improvised explosive device killing four personnel and 
wounding thirty-one. After being knocked over by the blast and struggling 
to his feet, he executed air to ground engagements while returning fire with 
his M4 rifle. Keller helped move thirteen critically wounded casualties to 
a helicopter landing zone under a hail of enemy fire. Upon noticing 
the medical evacuation helicopters were unable to identify the landing 
zone, he exposed himself to enemy fire in order to marshal in both aircraft. After the mission had 
been aborted and despite his injuries, Keller loaded wounded personnel into vehicles and 
volunteered to walk two and a half kilometers back to a combat outpost while escorting other 
wounded teammates. During this movement, Keller repulsed a three-sided enemy attack by 
returning fire and simultaneously passed enemy positions to another Joint Terminal Attack 
Controller, allowing friendly forces to break contact. As a result of his actions, Daniel Keller was 
awarded the Air Force Cross.

3.19. War on Terror – Iraq 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. In March 2003, after receiving intelligence reports that Saddam 
Hussein possessed or was building weapons of mass destruction, President Bush announced a 48- 
hour ultimatum for him and his sons to leave Iraq or face severe consequences. When Saddam 
refused to comply, a coalition of American and Allied forces entered Iraq to end the Hussein 
regime and free the Iraqi people. The primary goals of Operation Iraqi Freedom were to create a 
stable Iraq, empower a broad-based government that renounces weapons of mass destruction, and 
rebuke terrorism to neighboring countries. Combined force commanders carried out objectives to 
defeat or compel capitulation of Iraqi forces, neutralize regime leadership, and neutralize Iraqi 
theater ballistic missile/weapons of mass destruction delivery systems. 
More than 300,000 troops were deployed to the Gulf region to form a multinational coalition, and 
Operation Iraqi Freedom officially began on 20 March 2003. On the first day, while British forces 
took Basra, which was essential to delivering humanitarian aid, the United States unleashed air 
strikes so devastating that Saddam’s soldiers were left unable or unwilling to fight. Between 300 
and 400 cruise missiles were fired at targets, more than the number launched during the entire first 
Gulf War. On the second day, the battle plan called for launching another 300 to 400 missiles, 
what the National Defense University referred to as shock and awe. The plan was focused on the 
psychological destruction of the enemy’s will to fight rather than the physical destruction of the 
opposing military force. The concept relied on a large number of precision-guided weapons hitting 
the enemy simultaneously, an approach that takes minutes instead of days or weeks. 
By 9 April 2003, American commanders declared that Saddam’s regime was no longer in control 
of Baghdad. Before the city fell, jubilant crowds toppled a 40-foot statue of Saddam. Also, Iraq’s 
science advisor, the first on the 55 most-wanted leaders list issued by the coalition, surrendered. 
In less than one month, our military forces rolled past Iraq’s Republican Guard, seized bridges 
over the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and commandeered Saddam International Airport. With 
control of the airport, major operations were conducted to eliminate insurgent centers of activity.  
Notable Bravery in Iraq, Scott D. Sather. Scott D. Sather led a 
reconnaissance task force into Iraq on the first day of the ground war of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, breeching enemy fortifications during the border 
crossing. During the next several days, Sather covered countless miles 
conducting specialized reconnaissance in the Southwestern Iraqi desert in 
support of classified missions. Sather was then employed to an area of 
heavy enemy concentration, tasked to provide critical reconnaissance and 
intelligence on enemy movement, supporting direct action missions 
against enemy forces. Sather’s phenomenal leadership and bravery on the 
battlefield throughout his deployment were instrumental in the resounding 
successes of numerous combat missions by performing a significant role in the success of the war 
and the complete overthrow of the Iraqi regime. Staff Sergeant Scott Sather died on 8 April 2003. 
He was the first Airman killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He earned seven medals during his 
USAF career, including the Bronze Star.

Notable Bravery in Iraq, Elizabeth Jacobson. Three months into her 
deployment, security forces member, Elizabeth Jacobson, was guarding a 
convoy enroute from Camp Bucca, Iraq as a member of the off-base convoy 
support team. The convoy was hit by an improvised explosive device near 
Safwan, Iraq. On 28 September 2005, A1C Jacobson was the first security 
forces Airman and first female Airman to die in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
She served in the USAF two years. The Elizabeth N. Jacobson Award for 
Expeditionary Excellence was established in her honor. The award is given 
to Airmen for outstanding performance during a deployment. 
3.20. Operation Iraqi Freedom Continues 
The United States involvement in Iraq maintained focused on controlling insurgents and enabling 
the country to rebuild its constitution and government. Fifty-four USAF personnel died in the Iraq 
War. In 2003, Saddam Hussein was found and captured; he was tried and executed three years 
later. With instability raging out of control in the region, primarily between Shias and Sunnis, the 
country became a breeding-ground for terrorist activities once again. The United States intervened 
with a surge of force in 2007 to deescalate the situation. 
Operation New Dawn. On 1 September 2010, operations transitioned from Operation Iraqi 
Freedom to Operation New Dawn, signifying a formal end to United States involvement in the 
military combat operations. The transition to a supporting role and stability operations was made 
possible by increased capability of Iraqi security forces and their improved ability to combat 
terrorists and provide security for their people. As part of Operation New Dawn, our military had 
three primary missions: advising, assisting, and training the Iraqi security forces; conducting 
partnered counterterrorism operations; and providing support to provincial reconstruction teams 
and civilian partners as they helped build Iraq’s civil capacity. As mandated under the terms of a 
bilateral agreement signed in 2008 by President Bush, troop withdrawal from Iraq was completed 
on 18 December 2011. 
3.21. War on Terror – Libya 
Operation Odyssey Dawn. On 20 March 2011, under Operation Odyssey Dawn, a collection of 
aircraft was launched to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, centered on 
protecting Libyan citizens from further harm under Moammar Gadhafi’s regime. Following an 
initial launch of Tomahawk missiles, aircraft conducted strikes on a variety of strategic targets 
over Libya and created an airspace where no enemy forces could advance on Libyan opposition 
troops. On 31 March 2011, the United States passed complete military command of the operation 
and control of the no-fly zone to NATO and took up a supporting role for the remainder of the 
operation, which was carried out under the name Operation Unified Protector. 
3.22. War on Terror – Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant 
Operation Inherent Resolve. In 2014, a new and ominous threat emerged that resulted in the 
involvement of the United States in operations in the skies over Iraq once again. This time, the 
enemy, calling themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), was an extremist Sunni 
jihadist organization. Aided by a number of worldwide recruits and sympathizers, ISIL gained 
control of territory in Syria and Northern Iraq and left savage atrocities in their wake, including 
mass murders and ruthless executions of innocent civilians. ISIL was estimated to have an annual 
budget of more than $1,000,000,000 and a force of more than 30,000 fighters. Their brutality 
resulted in nearly universal condemnation—even Al Qaeda repudiated them. President Barack H. 
Obama authorized the use of force, in cooperation with partner nations, to conduct carefully 
targeted air strikes over Iraq and Syria and thwart their destructive agenda.

3.23. First Female Space Shuttle Commander, Eileen M. Collins. 
Eileen M. Collins, a USAF officer and NASA astronaut, was the first 
woman to command a space shuttle mission. She became an astronaut 
in 1991, was initially assigned to the orbiter engineering support team, 
and led several offices while working on the spacecraft program. On 3-
11 February 1995, aboard the spacecraft Discovery, Colonel Collins 
flew the first flight of the Russian-American space program. On 15-24 
May 1997, aboard the spacecraft Atlantis, Colonel Collins flew on 
NASAs sixth shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian 
Space Station, Mir. On 22-27 July 1999, aboard the spacecraft Columbia, Colonel Collins 
became the first woman to command a shuttle mission. On 26 July-9 August 2005, aboard 
the spacecraft Discovery, Colonel Collins was a member of the crew that conducted the return-
to- flight mission during which the shuttle docked with the International Space Station. By the 
time she retired from NASA in 2006, Colonel Collins logged more than 6,750 hours in 30 different 
types of aircraft and conducted four space flights, logging over 872 hours in space. Colonel Collins 
has been recognized as one of the top 300 women in history who has had an impact on changing 
the world. 
3.24. USAF Welcomes First and Only Enlisted Female Pilot 
On 4 August 2017, Courtney Farley became the first and only enlisted 
female pilot. She is one of 12 hand-picked individuals to enter pilot training 
since World War II. Farley has since commissioned and currently pilots 
the RQ-4 Global Hawk.

4.1.  Domains of Airpower 
Airpower can be applied from within, as well as across the domains of air and cyberspace. From 
an operational perspective, the air domain can be described as that region above the earth’s surface 
in which aerodynamics generally govern the planning and conduct of military operations. The 
space domain can be described as that region above the earth’s surface in which astrodynamics 
generally govern the planning and conduct of military operations. The cyberspace domain is a 
global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of 
information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, 
computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers. 
4.2.  Airpower Defined 
For the past 76 years, the USAF has been breaking barriers as a member of the finest joint 
warfighting team on the planet, providing Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power for 
America. In terms of Global Vigilance, Airmen have built a real-time global intelligence and 
command and control network that can find, fix, and finish the smallest of targets. Airmen operate 
multiple satellite constellations that range from ensuring situational awareness to nuclear warning. 
Cyber operators build, secure, operate, and defend our critical networks and mission systems, and 
are ready to take offensive actions in, from, and through cyberspace. In terms of Global Reach, 
the USAF ranges the globe rapidly to respond to crises and deliver critical supplies and personnel 
to any location on the planet. Mobility Airmen are in 23 countries at 77 locations operating a global 
system of airfields and enabling access for allies and joint partners. Persistent engagements by our 
highly skilled special operations forces enhance critical relationships and secure global access at 
a time and place of our choosing. In terms of Global Power, the USAF can strike an enemy on 
short notice anywhere in the world with American fighters, bombers, remotely piloted aircraft, and 
intercontinental ballistic missiles. USAF special operators conduct counter-terrorism missions 
daily, while our nuclear forces are the ultimate backstop to deter attacks on the homeland and our 
Allies and partners who rely on U.S. extended deterrence. As Airmen, we must ensure our mission 
is understood at all levels and appreciated for the capabilities airpower brings to the fight. 
Airpower is the ability to project military power or influence through the control and exploitation 
of air and cyberspace to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives. As the nation’s 
most comprehensive provider of military airpower, the USAF conducts continuous and 
concurrent air and cyberspace operations across the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of 
war. Airpower provides the versatile, wide-ranging means towards achieving national objectives 
with the ability to deter and respond immediately to crises anywhere in the world, while aligned 
with land and maritime power during operations against enemy forces, and when protecting and 
aiding friendly forces. 
4.3.  Cyberpower Defined 
Cyberspace is a global domain within the information environment (IE) consisting of the 
interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including 
the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
75 
 
 
 
controllers. This definition of cyberspace comes from Joint Publication (JP) 3-12, Cyberspace 
Operations, and AFDP 3-12, Cyberspace Operations. As further described by JP 3-12, 
cyberspace operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose 
to achieve objective in or through cyberspace. 
Three Components to Cyberspace. Electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum refer to the 
wave-particle duality of radiation that, when modulated with information, creates a signal. Data 
and networked systems refer to digital information and application programs and the computers 
and networks on which they exist. Three components to cyberspace are recognized as: (1) the 
“effectors” that encompass a broad range of signal-borne threats, analog and digital; (2) the 
“medium” that enables effectors to access the targets, wired and wireless, hardware and software; 
and (3) the “targets” to include weapons and systems that use computers or networks. Anticipating 
and avoiding threats eliminates the need to fight them and saves the concurrent cost to data and 
system integrity, making prevention an effective first line of defense against cyber threats. 
Anticipating a cyber threat includes setting up over-the-horizon early warning systems that detect 
anomalous activity, analyzing rapidly its forensic fingerprint to predict future behavior, and 
communicating through viable reach-back options to avoid the threat. 
Four Axioms of Offensive Cyberpower. The four axioms of offensive cyberpower are: 
misdirecting functionality, stealth access, exploiting vulnerabilities, and superior human cognition. 
From a war-fighting perspective, the internet has traditionally favored the defense over the offense. 
This inherent advantage to the attacker resulted from the design of the internet protocols for 
tolerance to failure rather than resilience to attack. Modifying the cyber domain may provide an 
effective method for attack avoidance. Just as a carrier battle group sails the oceans rather than 
sitting still in one location, so can a network or system move around the IP address space for 
deception and attack avoidance. The tenets of anti-tamper protection technologies seek to reduce 
vulnerability by reducing the scope of protection and focusing on critical components in a system, 
making them harder to access. This approach allows the defenders to impose high penalties on the 
attacker and deter the threat. Hence, offensive cyberpower is the exploitation of the unconceived 
vulnerability, where unknown cyber insecurity wins against known cybersecurity in a complex, 
interactive system of computers, networks, and humans.

4.4.  Identifying Aircraft 
Throughout military history, warriors 
have carried their unit colors into battle, 
raising 
them 
high 
to 
make 
an 
impression on their enemies and giving 
unit members a sense of belonging and 
pride. That tradition carries on to this 
day in the form of aircraft fin flashes or 
tail flashes. Information on standard tail 
flashes designates the base and unit the 
aircraft is from, as well as the tail 
number of the aircraft. Traditionally, units would select a single aircraft to be the unit flagship with 
a special fin flash that represented the specific squadron or wing and was the assigned airplane for 
the unit commander. The flagship was the airplane generally used for photos, air shows, and other 
public displays. Today, while tail flash designs, as shown in Figure 4.1., can include color, tail 
flashes are often done in various shades of gray to maintain a camouflage appearance. 
Aircraft Tail Markings. While similar, each branch of the military has unique aircraft in their 
inventory and their codes may vary slightly.  
Roundel. A roundel is a circular disc often used as a national or historic symbol. One place that 
roundels are most commonly seen on are on military aircraft or infrastructure. The French Air 
Service originated the use of roundels on military aircraft during World War I, most often using 
colors of red, white, and blue as representative of their national flag. Attachment 2, The Roundel, 
shows the evolution of the roundel throughout its use in the USAF. 
4.5.  Mission Design Series 
The mission design series designator is an official Department of Defense recognized alpha- 
numeric symbol used to designate military defense aerospace vehicles categorized as aircraft, 
guided missiles, rockets, probes, boosters, and satellites. The designator describes the aerospace 
vehicle in two components, separated by a dash. The first component, comprised only of alpha 
characters, describes the mission of the vehicle. The second component, comprised of alpha- 
numeric characters, describes the design number and design series of the vehicle. Also, some 
designators will have a letter following the two-part designator of the aircraft to indicate the model 
type or series, usually due to improved model designs. Over the years, the designations have 
changed, but much of the system has remained the same. Table 4.1. is provided to show a 
comprehensive list of mission design series designators for USAF aircraft.

4.6.  Aircraft System Capabilities 
The USAF is globally engaged in conducting missions every day to defeat adversaries. We support 
partner nations in countering trans-regional terrorism, ensure the joint military team can conduct 
missions across the globe, and defend the homeland. Currently, approximately 21,000 Airmen are 
deployed to 175 locations; 80,000 Airmen are forward based; and 27,000 Airmen conduct 
operations from within the United States. Also, the USAF produces more than 6,000 intelligence 
products per day, driving operations around the globe. Cyber operators have blocked billions of 
malicious connections, denying access against increasingly innovative adversaries. Air superiority 
ensures the safety of American citizens every day and enables Airmen stateside to operate remotely 
piloted aircraft, process intelligence, and stand watch at nuclear missile bases. And, in partnership 
with the North American Aerospace Defense Command, Airmen maintain aerospace warning and 
control systems to ensure air sovereignty and air defense of the airspace over Canada, Alaska, and 
the Continental United States.

Aircraft System Inventory. While a comprehensive list of USAF aircraft and detailed 
descriptions can be found on the USAF Portal Fact Sheets, generalized descriptions of several of 
the aircraft/weapon systems in the inventory are provided here. 
 
Aircraft Weapon Systems 
 
A-10, Thunderbolt II 
The A-10 is a close air support platform used to support 
troops in contact with enemy forces. The A-10 performs 
secondary roles of air interdiction, airborne forward air 
control, and combat search and rescue. This aircraft has 
excellent maneuverability at low air speeds and altitude 
and is a highly accurate and survivable weapons-delivery 
platform. 
B-1B, Lancer 
The B-1B is a multi-mission bomber carrying the largest 
payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the 
inventory. The B-1B's blended wing/body configuration, 
variable-geometry wings, and turbofan afterburning 
engines combine to provide long range, maneuverability, 
and high speed while enhancing survivability. 
 
 
B-2, Spirit 
The B-2 is a multi-role bomber capable of delivering both 
conventional and nuclear conventional munitions and 
nuclear weapons. The penetrating flexibility and 
effectiveness inherent in manned bombers is what the B-
2 provides. The low-observable, stealth characteristics 
give it the unique ability to penetrate an enemy’s most 
sophisticated defenses and threaten its most valued and 
heavily defended targets. This aircraft provides the only 
all-weather hard/deeply buried conventional strike 
capability. 
B-21, Raider 
The B-21 is designed to support the nuclear triad, providing 
a visible and flexible nuclear deterrent capability that will 
assure allies and partners. With the ability to penetrate 
modern air defenses, the B-21 can provide long-range, 
mixed payload and high survivability in support of national 
security objectives. The B-21 is designed to have an open 
architecture, able to integrate new technology and respond 
to future threats across the full-spectrum of operations. 
Note: The B-21 is still in the development phases and is not 
officially a part of the USAF inventory.

B-52, Stratofortress 
The B-52 is a long-range, heavy bomber that can perform 
a variety of conventional or nuclear missions including 
strategic attack, close-air support, air interdiction, and 
offensive counter-air. For more than 40 years, B-52 
Stratofortresses have been the backbone of the manned 
strategic bomber force. The B-52 is capable of dropping 
or launching the widest array of weapons in the inventory. 
C-5M, Super Galaxy 
The C-5M is one of the largest aircraft in the world. The C- 
5 is used for strategic intertheater delivery of outsized and 
oversized cargo and passengers. Ground crews are able to 
load and off-load simultaneously at the front and rear cargo 
openings, reducing cargo transfer times. 
 
 
C-17, Globemaster III 
The C-17 is capable of rapid strategic delivery of troops 
and cargo to main operating bases or directly to forward 
bases in the deployment area. The aircraft can perform 
tactical airlift and airdrop missions and can transport 
litters and ambulatory patients during aeromedical 
evacuations, when required.

5.1. Command Authority 
Since the birth of our nation, policies and directives have been made by civilians assigned to the 
military and to the executive and legislative branches of the government. Command authority is 
the established levels of responsibility for command, control, and communication throughout a 
chain of command. Responsibility and authority for the U.S. Armed Forces extends from the U.S. 
President, through the Secretary of Defense, through two distinct branches of command, and 
through each commander at every level in the branches of service. The various levels within the 
chain of command have different responsibilities and authority; however, each level in the chain 
is responsible for all lower levels and accountable to all higher levels. 
Commander in Chief. The U.S. Constitution establishes the basic principle of civilian control of 
the U.S. Armed Forces. As Commander in Chief, the U.S. President has final command authority; 
however, as head of the executive branch, the President is subject to the checks and balances 
system of the legislative and judicial branches. 
Chain of Command. By statute, the chain of command runs from the U.S. President, through the 
Secretary of Defense, to the Combatant Commanders (CCDR). For all forces not assigned to the 
CCDRs, the chain of command runs from the U.S. President, through the Secretary of Defense, 
to the Secretaries of the military departments. When forces are assigned to the CCDRs, 
administrative control over those forces still typically flows through their respective service 
branch. Note: A provision of the Public Law 99-433, Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense 
Reorganization Act of 1986, 1 October 1986, permits the U.S. President to authorize 
communications through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, placing the Chairman in the 
communications chain of command. 
5.2.  Department of Defense 
With over 1.3 million members in the Regular Forces, another 826,000 in the National Guard and 
Reserve Forces, and 742,000 civilian personnel, the Department of Defense is America’s largest 
government agency. The mission of the Department of Defense is to provide military forces to 
deter war and protect the security of our country. Headquartered at the Pentagon, the Department 
of Defense includes the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Joint 
Staff; and the Departments of the Army, Navy (including the Marine Corps), and Air Force 
(including the Space Force). Furthermore, the Department of Defense includes the unified 
combatant commands (CCMD) and forces dedicated to combined commands, defense agencies, 
and field activities. As the civilian head of the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense 
reports directly to the U.S. President. 
Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense (SecDef) is appointed by the U.S. President, with 
advice and consent of the Senate. The SecDef serves as principal defense policy advisor to the 
U.S. President and is responsible for the formulation of general defense policy, policy related to 
all matters of direct and primary concern to the Department of Defense, and for the execution of 
approved policy. In addition to exercising the operational chain of command between the U.S. 
President and the CCDRs, a specific responsibility of the SecDef is to provide written policy 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
90 
 
 
 
guidance for Department of Defense national security objectives and policies, military mission 
priorities, and projected levels for available resources. The SecDef also provides the Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff with written policy guidance regarding contingency plans. The Secretaries 
of the military departments and the CCDRs are provided written guidelines to direct the effective 
detection and monitoring of all potential aerial and maritime threats to the national security of the 
United States. 
The Armed Forces Policy Council. The Armed Forces Policy Council assists in matters requiring 
a long-range view, formulates broad defense policy, and advises the Secretary of Defense on 
policies, as requested. The Armed Forces Policy Council consists of the Secretary of Defense 
serving as the Chairman of the Council; the Deputy Secretary of Defense; Secretaries of the Army, 
Navy, and USAF; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Under Secretary of Defense for 
Acquisition and Sustainment, the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition 
and Technology, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the 
Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment; and the Service Chiefs. 
Under Secretaries of Defense. There are six Under Secretaries of Defense (Policy; Comptroller; 
Personnel and Readiness; Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S); 
Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering; and Intelligence) who assist the 
Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense receives staff assistance through a number of 
special agencies, such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Security Service, and Defense 
Logistics Agency, which provide special skills, expertise, and advice. 
5.3.  Joint Staff 
The Joint Staff assists members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in carrying out assigned responsibilities 
of strategic direction, unified operation of CCMD, and integration of all branches of the military 
into an efficient force. By law, the direction of the Joint Staff rests exclusively with the Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Chairman normally manages the Joint Staff through the Director 
of the Joint Staff. The Director is selected by the Chairman after consultation with other members 
of the Joint Chiefs and with the approval of the Secretary of Defense. The Joint Staff consists of 
more than 1,500 military and civilian personnel, composed of approximately equal numbers of 
officers from the Army, Navy, USAF, and USSF. Marines make up about 20 percent of the 
number allocated to the Navy. 
Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. Appointed by the U.S. President, by and with advice and 
consent of the Senate, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) holds the grade of General 
or Admiral. The CJCS outranks all other officers of the U.S. Armed Forces but may not exercise 
military command over the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the U.S. Armed Forces. The CJCS is the 
principal military advisor to the U.S. President, the National Security Council, and the Secretary 
of Defense. The Secretary of Defense may assign CJCS responsibility for overseeing the activities 
of the CCMDs. The CJCS presides over the Joint Chiefs of Staff and objectively furnishes 
recommendations and views of the Joint Chiefs to the U.S. President, National Security Council, 
or the Secretary of Defense. 
Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS), 
appointed by the U.S. President, by and with advice and consent of the Senate, is a member of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. The VCJCS performs duties prescribed by the Chairman, with the approval 
of the Secretary of Defense. The VCJCS cannot be from the same branch of service as the 
Chairman, serves a tour of two years, and may be reappointed for two additional terms. When 
required, the VCJCS assumes the role of Acting Chairman in the Chairman’s absence. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman. Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman (SEAC), is 
designated as the highest senior enlisted position in the U.S. Armed Forces. The SEAC is 
appointed to serve as an advisor to the Chairman and the Secretary of Defense on all matters 
involving Total Force integration, utilization, health of the force, and joint development for 
enlisted personnel. The SEAC also serves as a spokesperson to leaders and organizations on 
applicable issues affecting enlisted forces. 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the U.S. President and the 
Secretary of Defense, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff serve as advisors to the President, 
Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council. The Joint Chiefs provide the strategic 
direction of the U.S. Armed Forces, review major materiel and personnel requirements according 
to strategic and logistic requirements, and establish joint doctrine. Members of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff are also responsible for the assignment of logistic responsibilities to the military services, 
formulation of policies for joint training, and coordination of military education. Members of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff are the Chairman; Vice Chairman; Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army; Chief of 
Naval Operations; Chief of Staff of the USAF; Chief of Space Operations; Commandant of the 
Marine Corps; and Chief of the National Guard Bureau. For the Service Chiefs (Chief of Staff of 
the Army, Chief of Naval Operations, Chief of Staff of the USAF, Chief of Space Operations, 
Commandant of the Marine Corps), their Joint Chiefs of Staff duties take precedence over all 
other duties. Consequently, as the military heads of their respective services, the Joint Chiefs 
delegate many duties to their Vice Chiefs while retaining overall responsibility.

Corps will provide, as directed by proper authority, such missions, and detachments for service 
in foreign countries as may be required to support the national policies and interests of the United 
States and will assist the Army and the USAF in the accomplishment of their missions. 
Functions of the United States Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard is a military service and a 
branch of the U.S. Armed Forces at all times. It is a service in the Department of Homeland 
Security except when operating as part of the Navy on declaration of war or when the U.S. 
President directs. Major functions of the Coast Guard are to: (1) enforce or assist in the 
enforcement of all applicable federal laws on, under, and over the high seas and waters subject to 
the jurisdiction of the United States; (2) engage in maritime air surveillance or interdiction to 
enforce or assist in the enforcement of the laws of the United States; (3) administer laws and

United States; and (7) maintain a state of readiness to function as a specialized service in the Navy 
in time of war, including the fulfillment of Maritime Defense Zone command responsibilities. 
Functions of the USAF. The USAF includes all military aviation forces, both combat and service, 
not otherwise specifically assigned, and is organized, trained, and equipped primarily for prompt 
and sustained air offensive and defensive operations. The USAF is responsible for the preparation 
necessary for the effective prosecution of war except as otherwise assigned, and for the expansion 
of the peacetime components of the USAF to meet the needs of war. The USAF will provide the 
means for coordination of air defense among all services and will assist the Army and Navy in

weapons, tactics, technique, organization and equipment of USAF combat and service elements, 
coordinating with the Army and Navy on all aspects of joint concern, including those which pertain 
to amphibious and airborne operations. 
Functions of the United States Space Force. The Department of the Air Force is composed of 
air, space and cyberspace forces, both combat and support, not otherwise assigned. The USAF 
and Space Force are the nation’s principal air and space forces and are responsible for the 
preparation of forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war. The Department of the Air 
Force shall organize, train, equip, and provide air, space, and cyberspace forces for the conduct 
of prompt and sustained combat operations, military engagement, and security cooperation in 
defense of the nation, and to support the other Military Services and joint forces. The USAF and 
Space Force will provide the nation with global vigilance, global reach, and global power in the 
form of in-place, forward-based, and expeditionary forces possessing the capacity to deter 
aggression and violence by state, non-state, and individual actors to prevent conflict, and, should 
deterrence fail, prosecute the full range of military operations in support of U.S. national interests. 
The Space Force, within the Department of the Air Force, shall develop concepts, doctrine, tactics, 
techniques, and procedures and organize, train, equip, and provide forces to perform the following 
specific functions: (1) provide freedom of operation for the United States in, from, and to space.

5.6.  Combined Commands 
Combined commands consist of two or more forces or agencies of two or more allies operating 
together. Combined missions and responsibilities (including command responsibilities) must 
establish, assign, and conform to relevant multinational agreements. Normally, a combined 
command operates under the terms of a treaty, alliance, or bilateral agreement between or among 
the nations concerned. Examples of combined commands are: North American Aerospace 
Defense Command, Combined Forces Command Korea, and Allied Command Operations. 
5.7.  Unified Combatant Commands 
The U.S. President, assisted by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff through the Secretary of 
Defense, establishes unified CCMDs for the performance of military missions. Unified CCMDs 
have a broad, continuing mission composed of forces from two or more military departments. All 
units assigned or attached to a unified combatant command remain under the combatant command 
authority of the unified combatant command commander and the administrative control authority 
of the respective service component commander. Once assigned or attached to a unified 
combatant command, a force cannot be transferred except by authority of the Secretary of Defense 
or under special procedures with approval of the U.S. President. 
Unified Command Plan. The Unified Command Plan is a classified executive branch document 
prepared by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that assigns missions; planning, training, 
and operational responsibilities; and geographic areas of responsibilities to CCMDs. The Unified 
Command Plan has a significant impact on how CCMDs are organized, trained, and resourced—
areas over which Congress has constitutional authority. The plan is reviewed and updated every 
two years. 
5.8.  Combatant Command Organization 
There are currently 11 CCMDs, as 
shown in Figure 5.2. They are 
established 
by 
missions 
and 
responsibilities based on either a 
geographic area of responsibility 
(AOR) or function. CCDRs with an 
AOR operate in clearly delineated 
physical and geographic boundaries 
established by the UCP and have a 
distinctive regional military focus. 
Unified CCMDs with an AOR include U.S. Africa Command, U.S. Central Command, U.S. 
European Command, U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and U.S. Southern 
Command. CCMDs based solely on military functions without respect to a specific geographic 
region are called functional commands. These commands operate globally across geographic 
boundaries and provide unique capabilities to other CCDRs and the Services. The functional 
CCMDs include U.S. Special Operations Command, U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. Cyber 
Command, and U.S. Transportation Command.

5.10. One Team 
The USAF Total Force is one team—the USAF. It is comprised of military and civilian members 
(including contractors), serving within three components: the RegAF, USAF Reserve, and Air 
National Guard. Each component brings talents and capabilities that must be integrated to perform 
the USAF mission. Elevated requirements and the demands of recurring deployments of the Air 
National Guard and USAF Reserve over the past few decades have transformed a traditionally 
strategic Reserve Force into a force that provides operational capability, strategic depth, and surge 
capacity. Airpower cannot be applied efficiently and effectively without the contributions of each 
component working together. 
RegAF, Reserve, and Guard Airmen have deployed and fought as one team for decades and are 
nearly indistinguishable on the battlefield. Additionally, civilian Airmen work side by side daily 
with their military counterparts and are critical to mission success. Civilian employees provide 
invaluable experience, continuity, and leadership in all mission sets, and contribute a viewpoint 
that expands the USAF perspective and enhances our capability to solve problems, adapt to new 
challenges, and achieve mission success. 
Leveraging the strength of the Total Force maximizes the use and synergy of agile Airmen and 
resources. Organizations designed under Total Force integration share equipment, facilities, and 
resources to carry out a common mission. Under a classic association, the Regular Component is 
the host unit, retaining weapon system responsibility, while sharing the mission with a Reserve or 
Guard tenant unit. Under an active association, the Reserve or Guard unit is host, with a Regular 
Component tenant. Integrating with the Regular Component in this way yields numerous 
synergistic benefits to the USAF’s strength, including an improved ability to respond with surge 
capacity at a moment’s notice. 
5.11. Air Reserve Component 
The Air National Guard and USAF Reserve form a significant part of our aerospace capability as 
the Air Reserve Component. Forces are drawn from the Air Reserve Component when 
circumstances require the RegAF to rapidly deploy. Air Reserve Components are staffed and 
trained to meet the same training standards and readiness levels as RegAF Component Forces and 
are supplied with the same equipment on an equal priority. The RegAF can only withdraw, divert, 
or reassign equipment for other commitments with the Secretary of Defense’s written approval. 
To ensure responsiveness and combat readiness, Air Reserve Components are continuously 
evaluated and modernized. Air Reserve Component units are sometimes separated to take 
advantage of state or regional demographics and are not centralized at major, multi-squadron 
bases, as is the case with RegAF resources. This exception is beneficial because it implements a 
strong relationship with the civilian community and builds public support for the USAF as a whole. 
Command of non-mobilized USAF Reserve units is exercised through the Commander, USAF 
Reserve Command, who, in turn, is responsible to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Command 
of non-mobilized USAF Reserve Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs) is exercised 
concurrently through USAF Reserve Command and the unit of attachment. Whenever the 
President authorizes mobilization IAW Title 10 U.S. Code, the Secretary of Defense can delegate 
call-up authority to the service Secretaries. In that case, the Secretary of the Air Force would be 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
99 
 
 
 
authorized to call Air National Guard and USAF Reserve Forces to RegAF status. When activated, 
operational command of Air Reserve Components transfers to the gaining commander, who is also 
responsible for establishing training resources for all assigned or attached Air Reserve 
Components. Note: The seven Reserve Components of the U.S. Armed Forces are: Army 
National Guard, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air National Guard, USAF 
Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. 
Air National Guard. The National Guard Bureau is a joint activity of the Department of Defense, 
located in the Pentagon. As one of the Reserve Components of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Air 
National Guard (https://www.goang.com/) is often called upon to augment the RegAF 
Components in the performance of their missions. The Air National Guard has more than 105,000 
officers and enlisted members who serve in 90 flying units and 579 mission support units. The 
primary sources of full-time support for Air National Guard units are the dual-status military 
technicians. These personnel perform day- to-day organization, administration, recruitment, 
instruction, training, and maintenance support for the unit. By law, dual-status military technicians 
are civil service employees of the federal government who must be military members of the unit 
that employs them. Technicians train with the unit and are mobilized with the unit when 
federalized. 
Dual Federal and State Mission. The Air National Guard’s dual federal and state mission, a 
provision of the U.S. Constitution, results in each Guardsman holding membership in the National 
Guard of his or her state and in the U.S. National Guard. The Air National Guard's federal mission 
is to maintain well-trained, well-equipped units available for prompt mobilization during war, and 
provide assistance during national emergencies, such as natural disasters or civil disturbances. 
During peacetime, the combat-ready units and support units are assigned to most major commands 
to carry out missions compatible with training, mobilization readiness, humanitarian, and 
contingency operations. 
When Air National Guard units are not mobilized or under federal control, command jurisdiction 
for these units is vested in the governor of the state, commonwealth, or possession. As the 
Governor of the District of Columbia, the U.S. President has command jurisdiction over Air 
National Guard units. The U.S. President delegates this authority to the Secretary of the Army as 
Governor of the District of Columbia. Each of the 54 National Guard organizations is supervised 
by the adjutant general of the state or territory. Under state law, the Air National Guard provides 
protection of life and property, and preserves peace, order, and public safety. These missions are 
accomplished through emergency relief support during natural disasters; search and rescue 
operations; support to civil defense authorities; maintenance of vital public services; and 
counterdrug operations.  
USAF Reserve. The Chief of USAF Reserve, HAF, Pentagon, serves as the principal advisor on 
reserve matters to the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The USAF 
Reserve (https://www.airforce.com/ways-to-serve/air-force-reserve) consists of officers, enlisted, 
and civil servants who are tasked, by law, to fill the needs of the U.S. Armed Forces whenever 
more units and people are required than are available within the RegAF. More than 835,300 people 
make up the Ready, Standby, and Retired Reserve. This includes nearly 70,300 Selected 
Reservists who are “ready-now” for participating in every job specialty and on the front lines of 
daily military operations around the globe. The USAF Reserve is a combat-ready force, stationed 
at 66 locations throughout the United States, and serving globally for every CCMD in air and 
cyberspace. 
Today and in recent years, Reservists have supported every USAF core function and every CCDR 
around the world. USAF Reservists safeguard nuclear weapons and guide global positioning 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
100 
 
 
 
satellites. Reservists fly remotely piloted aircraft in combat half a world away, track hurricanes 
out at sea, and bring medical supplies and food into disaster areas to save lives. For more than 75 
years, the USAF Reserve has fulfilled the legacy of early air pioneers and exceeded the potential 
seen by the visionaries who created it.  
5.12. Civil Air Patrol/USAF Auxiliary 
The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is a congressionally chartered, non-profit corporation under 36 U.S.C. 
§ 40301. CAP is also designated the volunteer civilian auxiliary of the USAF when CAP services 
are utilized by any department or agency of the Federal government. The Secretary of the Air 
Force can employ the services of CAP in lieu of, or to supplement, USAF resources to fulfill the 
non-combat programs and missions of the USAF. As a Total Force partner, when approved and 
assigned by the USAF, CAP conducts missions as Airmen of the USAF Auxiliary, aligned under 
Air Combat Command for fiscal and operational oversight and utilization. CAP has over 55,000 
senior member and cadet volunteers, maintains a fleet of over 550 aircraft and over 1000 vehicles, 
manages multiple nationwide communications capabilities, and maintains a state-of-the-art cell 
phone forensics cell. 
Three primary programs managed by CAP involve emergency services and civil support, 
aerospace education, and cadet programs. The emergency services and civil support programs 
maintain the ability to meet USAF requirements to assist federal, state, local, and non- 
governmental organizations during routine and emergency situations in support of homeland 
security operations, consequence management, and search and rescue. Aerospace education 
provides aviation-focused materials for both senior and cadet members, as well as the general 
public. The cadet program is designed to motivate American youth to become responsible citizens 
through aviation-centered activities. 
CAP is organized into eight geographic regions led by regional commanders, and 52 state-level 
wings, to include the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico / U.S. Virgin Islands. Approximately 
1,400 total individual units comprise the lower-level echelons within the state-level wings. Note: 
The four civilian auxiliaries of the U.S. Armed Forces are: Civil Air Patrol, Coast Guard Auxiliary, 
Merchant Marine, and Military Auxiliary Radio System. 
5.13. Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps 
The Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) mission is to develop citizens 
of character dedicated to serving the nation and community. The AFJROTC program is a Title 10 
United States Code, Armed Forces, mandated citizenship training program open to 9th-12th grade 
students that provides leadership training and an aerospace science program for high school 
students to explore the historic and scientific aspects of aerospace technology and teaches self- 
reliance, self-discipline, and other characteristics found in good leaders. These objectives are 
achieved through classroom education and instruction in air and space fundamentals and hands-on 
learning opportunities in a number of fun and challenging extra-curricular activities. Secondary 
school students who enroll in the AFJROTC program are offered a wide variety of curricular and 
extra-curricular activities. 
The AFJROTC staff includes 31 personnel assigned to headquarters and more than 1,900 retired 
USAF officer and enlisted military instructors. There are 870 AFJROTC units representing the Air 
and Space Forces (approximately 860 represent the USAF while the other 10 represent the Space 
Force) with nearly 120,000 cadets in high schools across the United States and selected 
Department of Defense dependent schools in Europe and the Pacific, as well as public schools in 
Puerto Rico and Guam. The AFJROTC program is not a recruiting or accession tool for the military 
services as students who participate in the program incur no military service obligation.

5.14. Department of the Air Force (DAF) 
Title 10 United States Code, Armed Forces, provides specified duties, responsibilities, and legal 
obligations of the Department of the Air Force. The USAF’s mission is to fly, fight, and 
win…airpower anytime, anywhere. The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is comprised of the 
secretariat (including the Secretary of the Air Force and the Secretary’s principal staff), HAF and 
field units, and Headquarters Space Force and field units. It is responsible for preparing the air, 
space, and cyber forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war and military operations short 
of war for the expansion of the peacetime components of the USAF and Space Force to meet the 
needs of war. DAF consists of three major entities: the Secretariat (including the Secretary of the 
Air Force and the Secretary’s principal staff) and the Air Staff (headed by the Chief of Staff of the 
Air Force), and the Space Staff (headed by the Chief of Space Operations). Field units are the 
component organizations within the USAF and Space Force. 
USAF Primary Functions. In addition to general and specific functions of the military branches 
outlined in the Key West Agreement, there are also primary functions of the branches. The primary 
functions of the USAF include, but are not limited to organizing, training, equipping, and 
providing forces to conduct offensive and defensive operations, to include appropriate air and 
missile defense, to gain and maintain air superiority, and air supremacy as required, to enable, the 
conduct of operations by U.S. and allied land, sea, air, and special operations forces; conduct 
nuclear operations in support of strategic deterrence; conduct global precision attack, to include 
strategic attack, interdiction, close air support, and prompt global strike; provide timely, global 
integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability; provide rapid global mobility 
to employ and sustain organic air and space forces and other Military Services, to include airlift 
forces for airborne operations, air logistical support, tanker forces for in-flight refueling, and 
aeromedical evacuation; provide agile combat support to enhance the air and space campaign and 
the deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of air forces; conduct global 
personnel recovery operations including theater-wide combat and civil search and rescue; and 
conduct global integrated command and control for air and space operations. 
As stated in AFI 1-1, the USAF will be a trusted and reliable joint partner with our sister services 
known for integrity in all activities, including supporting the joint mission first and foremost. 
USAF provides compelling air and cyber capabilities for use by the CCDRs. USAF will excel as 
stewards of all USAF resources in service to the American people, while providing precise and 
reliable Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power for the nation.  
Secretary of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) is a civilian appointed by the 
U.S. President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The SecAF is the head of the 
Department of the Air Force and is subject to the authority, control, and direction of the Secretary 
of Defense. Responsibilities of the SecAF include recruiting, organizing, supplying, equipping 
(including research and development), training, servicing, mobilizing, demobilizing, and 
administering personnel (morale and welfare programs); maintaining, constructing, outfitting, and 
repairing military equipment; constructing, maintaining, and repairing buildings, structures, and 
utilities; and acquiring real property and interests in real property. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

5.15. Levels of Command and Responsibility 
Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) is a USAF General 
Officer appointed for four years by the U.S. President, by and with the advice and consent of the 
Senate. The CSAF is subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of the Air 
Force, and presides over the Air Staff. The CSAF acts as an agent in carrying out recommendations 
or plans by the Secretary, and exercises supervision consistent with the authority assigned to 
commanders of unified or specified CCMDs and organizations of the USAF. As a member of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CSAF informs the Secretary of the Air Force regarding military advice 
rendered by the Joint Chiefs of Staff on matters affecting the Department of the Air Force to the 
extent that such action does not impair the independence or performance of required duties as a 
member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Air Staff. The Air Staff supports the CSAF in carrying out his or her responsibilities. The Air 
Staff is composed of the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff, Deputy Chiefs of Staff, Assistant 
Chiefs of Staff, Surgeon General of the Air Force, The Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, 
Chief of the Air Force Reserve, and other USAF and civilian employees in the Department of the 
Air Force assigned or detailed to the Air Staff. Responsibilities are organized based on functional 
two-letter organizations. Some organizations can be merged under one commander/director and 
will have similarly merged office symbols. The USAF office symbol codes are provided here:  
A1 – Manpower, Personnel, and Services 
A2/6 – Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Cyber Effects Operations 
A3 – Operations 
A4 – Logistics, Engineering, and Force Protection  
A5/7 – Strategy, Integration, and Requirements 
A6 – Communications 
A8 – Strategic Plans and Programs 
A10 – Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration (as designated by USAF) 
Field Operating Agencies. Field Operating Agencies (FOA) are USAF subdivisions directly 
subordinate to a HAF functional manager. A FOA performs field activities beyond the scope of 
major commands. The activities are specialized or associated with a USAF-wide mission and do 
not include functions performed in management headquarters (such as Headquarters Air Mobility 
Command), unless specifically directed by a Department of Defense authority. Two examples of 
FOAs are the Air Force Personnel Center and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. 
Direct Reporting Units. Direct Reporting Units (DRU) are USAF subdivisions directly 
subordinate to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. A DRU performs a mission that does not fit into 
any of the major commands but has many of the same administrative and organizational 
responsibilities. Two examples of DRUs are the Air Force District of Washington and the USAF 
Academy. Note: The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), headquartered at Joint Base 
Andrews, Maryland, is a DRU to HAF, reporting to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. AFDW 
was reactivated in 2005 to address three broad objectives: align the USAF command structure in 
the National Capital Region (NCR) and abroad; improve USAF support to the Joint Force

AFDW serves as the USAF Service Component for coordination purposes to JFHQ-NCR and the 
supporting command to the Defense Health Agency National Capital Region Medical Directorate. 
When the JFHQ-NCR transitions to the Joint Task Force NCR (JTF-NCR), the 320th Air 
Expeditionary Wing (320 AEW) activates and becomes the USAF Service Component of JTF- 
NCR. When activated, the Commander of AFDW is dual hatted as the Commander, 320 AEW. 
Air Force Mission Directive 13 delineates missions and clarifies assigned duties applicable to 
AFDW in both its worldwide USAF role and its JTF-NCR USAF Service Component role. 
Major Commands. Major commands (MAJCOM) are organized functionally in the United States 
and geographically overseas. A MAJCOM, as shown in Figure 5.3., represents a major USAF 
subdivision having a specific portion of the USAF mission. Each MAJCOM is directly subordinate 
to HAF. MAJCOMs are interrelated and complementary, providing offensive, defensive, and 
support elements. An operational command consists (in whole or in part) of strategic, tactical, 
space, or defense forces, or of flying forces that directly support such forces. A support command 
may provide supplies, weapon systems, support systems, operational support equipment, combat 
material, maintenance, surface transportation, education and training, special services, and other 
supported organizations. Within the USAF MAJCOM structure, there are two specialized types of 
MAJCOMs: Lead MAJCOMs and Component MAJCOMs. 
 
 
 
Lead MAJCOM. A Lead MAJCOM is the type of MAJCOM that consolidates responsibilities 
for a particular function in a single MAJCOM, supporting the entire USAF, as applicable. For 
example, Air Education and Training Command is the Lead MAJCOM for education and training 
for the USAF. 
Component MAJCOM. A Component MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM) is the type of MAJCOM that 
is the USAF Component to a unified CCMD. A C-MAJCOM is commanded by the Commander 
of Air Force Forces and includes supporting staff, one or more Component Numbered Air Forces 
(through which it presents its forces to the CCDR), and all assigned and attached forces. The C-
MAJCOM integrates, at the strategic level, component activities across all phases of conflict. An 
example of a C-MAJCOM is Pacific Air Forces, the USAF Component to United States Indo-
Pacific Command. For additional information on component relationships and roles, refer to AF 
Doctrine Volume 1, Command, AF Doctrine Annex 3-30, Command and Control, and AFI 38-
101. Note: A MAJCOM can be both a Lead MAJCOM and a C-MAJCOM. 
Air Combat Command. Air Combat Command (ACC) was activated as a MAJCOM on 1 June 
1992, and is headquartered at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia. ACC is the primary provider of 
air combat forces to America's warfighting commanders. ACC’s mission is to support global 
implementation of the national security strategy by operating fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, 
battle-management, and electronic-combat aircraft. It also provides command, control, 
communications, and intelligence systems, and conducts global information operations. ACC 
organizes, trains, equips, and maintains combat-ready forces for rapid deployment and 
employment while ensuring strategic air defense forces are ready to meet the challenges of 
Figure 5.3. Major Commands

peacetime air sovereignty and wartime air defense. Additionally, ACC develops strategy, doctrine, 
concepts, tactics, and procedures for airpower employment. The command provides conventional 
and information warfare forces to all unified commands to ensure air and information superiority 
for warfighters and national decision-makers. The command can be called upon to assist national 
agencies with intelligence, surveillance, and crisis response capabilities. ACC also has 
responsibility for inland search and rescue operations in the 48 contiguous states. Overall, ACC 
operates more than 1,300 aircraft, 34 wings, 19 bases, and has more than 70 worldwide operating 
locations with 94,000 Total Force members. 
Air Mobility Command. Air Mobility Command (AMC) was activated as a MAJCOM on 1 June 
1992, is headquartered at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, and is the USAF Component to U.S. 
Transportation Command. AMC’s mission is to provide global air mobility, the right effects, right 
place, right time. The command plays a crucial role in providing humanitarian support at home 
and around the world and provides airlift and aerial refueling for all U.S. Armed Forces. Many 
special duty and operational support aircraft and stateside aeromedical evacuation missions are 
assigned to AMC. This rapid, flexible, and responsive force promotes stability in regions by 
keeping America’s capability and character highly visible. Overall, AMC has one Numbered Air 
Force, 17 wings, two airlift groups, and one air base group. AMC has nearly 133,700 Total Force 
members who make the command's rapid global mobility operations possible. 
Pacific Air Forces. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) was activated as a MAJCOM on 3 August 1944, 
is headquartered at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, and is the USAF Component of U.S. 
Indo-Pacific Command. PACAF’s mission is to deliver rapid and precise air and cyberspace 
capabilities to protect and defend the United States, its territories, allies, and partners; provide 
integrated air and missile warning and defense; promote interoperability throughout the area of 
responsibility; maintain strategic access and freedom of movement across all domains; and 
respond across the full spectrum of military contingencies to restore regional security. 
PACAF’s area of responsibility is home to 60 percent of the world’s population in 36 nations across 
52 percent of the Earth's surface and 16 time zones, with more than 1,000 languages spoken. The 
unique location of the strategic triangle (Hawaii-Guam-Alaska) gives our nation persistent 
presence and options to project airpower from sovereign territory. PACAF’s Airmen are postured 
to deploy at any given time in support of overseas contingency operations, many participating in 
non-traditional missions, such as convoy and detainee operations. Overall, PACAF has 
approximately 46,000 military and civilian personnel serving in nine strategic locations and 
numerous smaller facilities, primarily in Hawaii, Alaska, Japan, Guam, and the Republic of Korea. 
Approximately 320 fighter, tanker, cargo, air battle management, surveillance, rescue, and attack 
aircraft are assigned to the command with approximately 100 additional deployed aircraft rotating 
on Guam. 
United States Air Forces in Europe & Air Forces Africa. United States Air Forces in Europe & 
Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) was activated as a MAJCOM on 20 April 2012 and is 
headquartered at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. USAFE-AFAFRICA is a combined organization 
that provides two separate CCMDs. USAFE is the USAF Service Component to U.S. European 
Command, and AFAFRICA is the USAF Service Component to U.S. Africa Command. Both 
USAFE and AFAFRICA, which function together as a blended USAFE-AFAFRICA staff, are 
commanded by the same General Officer with two separate and distinct roles and authorities. 
USAFE-AFAFRICA plans, conducts, controls, coordinates, and supports air and space operations 
in Europe, parts of Asia, and all of Africa except for Egypt, to achieve United States and North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization objectives. As part of its mission, USAFE-AFAFRICA commands 
USAF units maintaining combat-ready wings based on Great Britain to Turkey. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

USAFE-AFAFRICA directs air operations in a theater spanning three continents, covering more 
than 19 million square miles, containing 104 independent states, possessing more than a quarter 
of the world's population, and producing more than a quarter of the world’s gross domestic product. 
Its role in Europe and Africa has expanded from warfighting to humanitarian and peacekeeping 
operations, as well as other non-traditional contingencies throughout its area of responsibility. 
Overall, USAFE-AFAFRICA consists of one Numbered Air Force, seven main operating bases, 
and 114 geographically separated locations. More than 35,000 Total Force members are assigned 
to USAFE-AFAFRICA. Equipment assets include about 217 aircraft and a full complement of 
conventional weapons. 
Air Education and Training Command. On 1 July 1993, the Air Education and Training 
Command (AETC) was activated as a MAJCOM and is headquartered at Joint Base San Antonio-
Randolph, Texas. AETC’s mission is to Recruit, train and educate exceptional Airmen. AETC 
develops America’s young men and women who have volunteered to serve their country, into 
Airmen, motivating them to embrace the USAF culture by teaching (by our example) the USAF 
and USSF core values. AETC’s training mission makes it the first command to touch the lives of 
nearly every USAF member. Over the years, more than 25 million students have graduated from 
AETC. Overall, AETC includes USAF Recruiting Service, two Numbered Air Forces and the Air 
University. AETC operates 12 major installations and supports tenant units on numerous bases 
across the globe. 
Air Force Materiel Command. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) was activated as a 
MAJCOM on 1 July 1992 and is headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. 
AFMC’s mission is to equip the USAF for world-dominant airpower. AFMC delivers war-winning 
expeditionary capabilities to the warfighter through development and transition of technology, 
professional acquisition management, exacting test and evaluation, and world-class sustainment 
of all USAF weapon systems. AFMC fulfills its mission of equipping the USAF with the best 
weapon systems through the Air Force Research Laboratory and several unique centers which are 
responsible for the “cradle-to-grave” oversight for aircraft, electronic systems, missiles, and 
munitions. AFMC employs a highly professional and skilled command work force of some 80,000 
Total Force members. 
Air Force Special Operations Command. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) 
was activated as a MAJCOM on 22 May 1990, is headquartered at Hurlburt Field, Florida, and is 
the USAF Component of U.S. Special Operations Command. AFSOC’s mission is to provide our 
nation’s specialized airpower, capable across the spectrum of conflict…any place, anytime, 
anywhere. AFSOC provides highly trained, rapidly deployable Airmen for global special 
operations missions ranging from precision application of firepower to infiltration, exfiltration, 
resupply, and refueling of operational elements for worldwide deployment and assignment to 
regional unified commands. The command's core missions include battlefield air operations; agile 
combat support; aviation foreign internal defense; information operations/military information 
support operations; precision strike; specialized air mobility; command and control; and 
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. AFSOC’s priorities are to ensure readiness to 
execute global special operations today, transform our force and fleet to maintain relevance 
tomorrow, and invest in the resiliency of our force, family, and relationships always. 
The Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center, headquartered at Hurlburt Field, Florida, 
organizes, trains, educates, and equips forces to conduct special operations missions; leads 
MAJCOM irregular warfare activities; executes special operations test and evaluation and lessons 
learned programs; and develops doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures for Air Force special 
operations missions. AFSOC’s special tactics squadrons combine combat controllers, special

reconnaissance, pararescuemen, and tactical air control party specialists with other services to 
form versatile joint special operations teams. AFSOC has more than 19,500 Total Force members 
assigned and operates multiple fixed-wing and rotary-wing assets. 
Air Force Global Strike Command. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) was activated 
as a MAJCOM on 7 August 2009, is headquartered at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, and 
is one of two USAF Service Components of U.S. Strategic Command. AFGSC’s mission is to 
provide strategic deterrence, global strike, and combat support…anytime, anywhere. AFGSC is 
responsible for the nation’s three intercontinental ballistic missile wings, the USAF’s entire 
bomber force, the Long Range Strike Bomber Program, and operational and maintenance support 
to organizations within the nuclear enterprise. AFGSC is the guardian of the most powerful 
weapons on the planet and is the force provider for two legs of the nuclear triad. AFGSC’s 
intercontinental ballistic missile force is postured around the clock to answer the U.S. President’s 
call, just as it has been for over 50 years. AFGSC’s bomber fleet remains prepared and equipped 
for nuclear deterrence and conventional global strike. Approximately 31,000 professionals are 
assigned to two Numbered Air Forces, nine wings, two geographically separated squadrons, one 
detachment in the Continental United States, and deployed around the globe. 
Air Force Reserve Command. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) was activated as a 
MAJCOM on 17 February 1997, and is headquartered at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. AFRC’s 
mission is to provide combat-ready forces to fly, fight, and win. AFRC provides the USAF 
approximately 20 percent of the Total Force for about 5 percent of the manpower budget. 
Capabilities include nuclear deterrence operations; air and cyberspace superiority; command and 
control; global integrated intelligence surveillance reconnaissance; global precision attack; special 
operations; rapid global mobility; and personnel recovery. AFRC also perform space operations, 
aircraft flight testing, aerial port operations, civil engineer, security forces, military training, 
communications, mobility support, transportation, and services missions. The commander of 
AFRC is responsible for organizing, training, and equipping all USAF Reserve units. Overall, 
AFRC is composed of three Numbered Air Forces, a Force Generation Center, the Air Reserve 
Personnel Center, 35 wings, 10 independent groups, various mission support units, and additional 
miscellaneous locations and ranges. AFRC has nearly 74,718 Total Force members assigned to 
accomplish the demands of its diverse mission. 
5.16. Subordinate Levels of Command and Responsibility 
Below MAJCOMs are several structured subordinate levels of command, each with an established 
purpose and assigned responsibilities to be carried out respectively, as briefly described here. For 
additional details on USAF levels of command, refer to AFI 38-101. 
Numbered Air Force. The Numbered Air Force (NAF) is an administrative level of command 
directly under a MAJCOM. NAFs provide intermediate level operational leadership and 
supervision. They do not have complete functional staffs. In non-component NAFs, the number of 
personnel assigned varies but should not exceed 99 manpower authorizations without an approved 
waiver. A NAF is assigned subordinate units, such as wings, groups, and squadrons. 
USAF Component Numbered/Named Air Forces. A Component NAF (C-NAF), nicknamed as 
warfighting headquarters, is structured to perform an operational and warfighting mission in 
support of a Joint Force Commander. The 10 USAF C-NAFs are the primary operational-level 
warfighting component commands. The C-NAF headquarters normally consists of an Air Force 
Forces staff and an assigned air and space operations center or operations center. They are 
dedicated to supporting the unified CCDR and subordinate Joint Force Commanders across the 
full range of military operations. The C-NAF commander, assigned as the Commander of Air 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
107 
 
 
 
Force Forces to a geographic CCMD, will normally also be designated as the theater Joint Force 
Air Component Commander. A C-NAF commander may also be designated by the component 
commander to command a joint task force, as required. 
Wing. The wing is a level of command below the Numbered Air Force and has a distinct mission 
with significant scope. A wing is responsible for maintaining the installation and may have several 
squadrons in more than one dependent group. Wings will have a minimum adjusted population of 
at least 1,000 (750 for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command), to include manpower 
authorizations, students, and a percentage of contractor workforces. The different types of wings 
are operational, air base, or specialized mission. 
Operational Wing. An operational wing is one that has an operations group and related 
operational mission activity assigned. When an operational wing performs the primary mission of 
the base, it usually maintains and operates the base. In addition, an operational wing is capable of 
self-support in functional areas, such as maintenance and munitions, as needed. When an 
operational wing is a tenant unit, the host command typically provides base and logistics support. 
Air Base Wing. An air base wing performs a support function rather than an operational mission. 
This type of wing maintains and operates a base. An air base wing often provides functional 
support to a MAJCOM headquarters. 
Specialized Mission Wing. A specialized mission wing performs a specialized mission and 
usually does not have aircraft or missiles assigned. Examples include intelligence wings, training 
wings, and so on. This wing is either a host or a tenant wing, depending on if it maintains and 
operates the base. 
Group. A group is a level of command below the wing. Like the Numbered Air Force, a group is 
a tactical echelon with minimal staff support. A group usually has two or more subordinate units. 
A dependent group is a mission, logistics, support, medical, or large functional unit, such as a civil 
engineer group. Dependent groups may possess small supporting staff elements that are organized 
as sections, such as standardization and evaluation or quality control. An independent group has 
the same functions and responsibilities as a like-type wing, but its scope and size do not warrant 
wing-level designation. Groups will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 400 (200 for 
Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command), to include manpower authorizations, 
students, and a percentage of contractor workforces. 
Squadron. A squadron is the basic unit, the nucleus, and the basic building block of the USAF. 
The different types of squadrons are either mission units, such as operational flying squadrons, or 
functional units, such as civil engineer, security forces, or logistics readiness squadrons. 
Squadrons vary in size according to responsibility and should be organized and resourced to allow 
Airmen to focus on the USAF mission. Squadrons will have a minimum adjusted population of at 
least 35 and can range up to several hundred personnel, which includes manpower authorizations, 
students, and a percentage of contractor workforces. 
Flight. If internal subdivision within a squadron is required, numbered/named, alpha, or functional 
flights may be established. Flights typically consist of 12 to 100 people. A numbered or named 
flight primarily incorporates smaller elements into an organized unit. The administrative 
characteristics for a numbered or named flight include, strength reporting, like those of a squadron. 
Alpha flights are part of a squadron (usually a mission squadron) and are composed of several 
elements that perform identical missions. Functional flights are usually part of a squadron and are 
composed of elements that perform specific missions.  
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

Element. Elements are subdivisions of flights. Typically, flights are broken into three or four 
evenly distributed elements, when necessary.

6.1.  Doctrine Defined 
Every Airman needs doctrine to fundamentally understand how he or she contributes to making 
our Air Force the best in the world. It tells us how to effectively and efficiently apply airpower to 
help defend our nation. We should understand that doctrine is the Airman's inheritance, passed 
down from Airmen before us. It is our warfighting legacy. Doctrine tells us who we are and why 
our Air Force exists. Doctrine is the distilled warfighting experience and knowledge of our Air 
Force heroes, leaders, theorists, and scholars. Most importantly, doctrine captures and crystallizes 
the warfighting lessons. It is our responsibility to continually improve USAF doctrine through 
experience and debate, so we can pass down our best practices and our lessons learned to 
tomorrow's Airmen.  
“I’m firmly convinced that leaders are not born; they’re educated, trained, and made, 
as in every other profession. To ensure a strong, ready USAF, we must always remain 
dedicated to this process.” 
General Curtis E. LeMay, CSAF, 1961-1965 
A general discussion of Air Force doctrine can be found in the Doctrine Primer on the LeMay 
Center’s doctrine https://www.doctrine.af.mil/. 
Fundamentals of Doctrine. Military service is based on values that experience has proven to be 
vital for operational success. The complexity of integrating fighting elements according to 
doctrine, and the uncertainty inherent in rapidly developing contingency operations, demands that 
planning and employment be understood and repeatable. Meeting the challenges of this rapidly 
changing world requires understanding and application of doctrine. Doctrine exists as joint 
doctrine, multinational doctrine, and Service doctrine. 
Joint Doctrine. The growing threats to United States and allied interests throughout the world 
demand U.S. Armed Forces be proficient across the competition continuum. The fundamental 
principles that guide joint operations are recorded in joint doctrine. The purpose of joint doctrine 
is to enhance the effectiveness of joint operations by providing fundamental principles that guide 
the employment and integration of the U.S. military to create unity of effort and unity of 
command. Joint doctrine promotes a common perspective from which to plan, train, and conduct 
joint military operations. The foundations of joint doctrine represent what is taught, believed, and 
advocated for (what is right and what works best). 
Joint operations are conducted routinely and efficiently in the current operational environment. To 
maintain and enhance this efficiency, joint leaders must diligently study, apply, teach, and 
ultimately provide insights to improve joint doctrine. JP 1 Volume 1, Joint Warfighting, 
Reference Copy, provides fundamental principles and overarching guidance for the U.S. Armed 
Forces and forms the core for our forces to be able to fight as a unified force—a joint team. Joint 
doctrine is official advice and will be followed, except when in the judgment of the commander 
or exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise. 
Multinational Doctrine. Some nations possess doctrine and training programs with a full 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
110 
 
 
 
treatment of strategic, operational, and tactical issues. Other nations have doctrine and training 
programs smaller in both scope and capability to match their national goals and objectives. 
Multinational doctrine, as it applies to airpower, describes the best way to integrate and employ 
USAFs with the forces of allies in coalition warfare. It establishes principles, organization, and 
fundamental procedures agreed upon between or among Allied Forces. When developed as a result 
of a treaty, as in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), multinational doctrine is directive. 
When the U.S. Armed Forces participate in multinational operations, our commanders follow 
multinational doctrine and ratified (approved) procedures. For multinational doctrine and 
procedures not ratified by the United States, commanders should evaluate and follow multinational 
command doctrine and procedures where applicable and consistent with law, policy, and guidance. 
Service Doctrine. Our service doctrine, USAF doctrine (https://www.doctrine.af.mil/), is 
developed by the Curtis E. LeMay Center for Doctrine Development and Education at Maxwell 
Air Force Base, Alabama. Our doctrine provides best practices for organization, planning, and 
employment of global airpower. As airpower capabilities improve, Airmen must also incorporate 
new concepts, lessons learned, and technologies into our development and application processes. 
Note: The LeMay Center traces its lineage to the Air Corps Tactical School at Langley Field, 
Virginia. Through a series of changes in name and location, the school evolved into the doctrine 
development center of the Air Corps and became a preparatory school for Air Corps officers 
aspiring to attend the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff College. In 1946, the Army Air 
Force created the Air University to continue with the Air Corps Tactical School objectives. Today, 
the LeMay Center serves as the CSAF’s Principal Agent for Doctrine and provides doctrine 
development expertise for the entire USAF. 
6.2.  Levels of USAF Doctrine 
Airpower is never prosecuted alone, and not one military contingency or operation, whether in 
peacetime or wartime, can optimize its objective without space or cyberspace. The proper 
application of airpower requires a comprehensive doctrine of employment and an Airman’s 
perspective. Information addressed in USAF doctrine, whether directly or indirectly, applies to 
Airmen on a daily basis. Lessons presented in doctrine, while written for the purpose of 
understanding warfighting, often can be applied under a range of contexts that enhance decision- 
making and strengthen leadership across the USAF. USAF doctrine is addressed at three levels: 
basic, operational, and tactical. These levels speak to the intellectual content of the doctrine. 
Basic Doctrine. Basic doctrine, contained in Air Force Doctrine Publication (AFDP) 1, The Air 
Force, is the USAF’s premier statement of our beliefs and the cornerstone upon which our Service 
identity is based. Basic doctrine states the most fundamental and enduring beliefs that describe 
and guide the proper use, presentation, and organization of forces in military action. Basic doctrine 
describes the “elemental properties” of airpower and provides the Airman’s perspective. Because 
of its fundamental and enduring character, basic doctrine provides broad and continuing guidance 
on how our USAF is organized, employed, equipped, and sustained. Because it expresses broad, 
enduring fundamentals, basic doctrine changes relatively slowly compared to the other levels of 
doctrine. The focal points of AFDP 1 are the reason we exist as a USAF (why we fight), Airmen 
as the leaders and innovators (who we are), airpower as the ability to project military power in, 
from and through the air (what we do), and the tenets of airpower which are the fundamental truths 
of how to apply airpower (how we do it). As the foundation of all doctrine, basic doctrine sets the 
tone and vision for doctrine development for the future. 
Operational Doctrine. Operational doctrine, contained in all the additional AFDPs, describes 
detailed organization of forces, and applies the principles of basic doctrine to military actions. 
The primary audience for operational doctrine COMAFFOR and their staff supporting a joint 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

force commander (JFC). Operational doctrine guides the proper organization and employment of 
airpower forces in the context of distinct objectives, force capabilities, broad functional areas, and 
operational environments. Operational doctrine provides the focus for developing the missions 
and tasks to be executed through tactical doctrine. Doctrine at this level is managed by the LeMay 
Center and changes are made IAW AFI 10-1301, Air Force Doctrine Development, and AFPD 
10-13, Air Force Doctrine. 
Tactical Doctrine. Tactical doctrine describes the proper employment of specific USAF assets, 
individually or in concert with other assets, to accomplish detailed objectives. Tactical doctrine 
considers particular objectives, such as stopping the advance of an armored column; conditions, 
such as threats, weather, and terrain; and employment of USAF assets. USAF tactical doctrine is 
codified as tactics, techniques, and procedures in Air Force -3 series manuals, many of which are 
classified due to their sensitive nature. Because tactical doctrine is closely associated with the 
employment of technology and emerging tactics, change will likely occur more rapidly than other 
levels of doctrine. Tactical doctrine is developed at multiple locations in the USAF: the 561st 
Weapons Squadron, the 423d Mobility Training Squadron, and the Air Land Sea Space 
Applications Center; it can also be developed by an Air Staff office or a major command. 
6.3.  Uses of Doctrine 
Understanding the underlying technique used to structure doctrine helps amplify the point that 
doctrine should be written robustly, but broadly, allowing decision-makers latitude in 
interpretation and flexibility in application, yet it should be specific enough to provide informed 
guidance. Understanding how doctrine is structured also illustrates the use of doctrine in 
explaining contentious issues and how doctrine can be used to focus thoughts and strategies more 
effectively through applying the best means of integrating various aspects of military power and 
organization. Key principles of doctrine are provided here. 
Warfighting, not Physics. The warfighting does not physic principle specifically addresses the 
perceived differences between operations in air and cyberspace. Air and cyberspace are separate 
domains requiring exploitation of different sets of physical laws but are linked by the effects they 
can produce when integrated. For example, Airmen should be more concerned with the best means 
of employing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, rather than whether a 
platform is airborne or in orbit. 
Effects, not Platforms. The effects, not platforms principle focuses on the desired outcome of a 
particular action more so than on the system or weapon that provides the effect. The effects-based 
approach to operations begins with clear military objectives and the statement of desired end- 
states. USAF doctrine does not explicitly tie specific weapon systems to specific tasks or effects. 
Whether a B-52 or an F-16 accomplishes a given task or whether a platform is manned or 
unmanned is not nearly as important as the outcome of the mission. 
Using Domains, not Owning Domains. The using domains, not owning domains principle 
illustrates the importance of properly conducting operations in a domain to obtain the best 
warfighting effects, not of carving up the battlespace based on Service or functional parochialism 
(narrow-mindedness). Focusing on using forces within a domain is a vital first step to integration 
of efforts. Arguments over ownership eventually lead to suboptimal application of efforts at the 
expense of the larger, total effort. 
 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
112 
 
 
 
Organization, not Organizations. The organization, not organizations principle refers to modern 
warfare demands that different Services, different nations, and differing functions within a single 
Service often need to be brought together intelligently to achieve unity of command and unity of 
effort. Doctrine explains why certain organizational structures are preferred over others and 
describes effective command relationships and command authorities; this facilitates the rapid 
standup of joint and Service organizations during rapidly evolving situations. Ultimately, doctrine 
is not about whether one particular element of a joint force is more decisive than another, nor about 
suggesting that one element serve as the centerpiece of joint operations: it’s the total, tailored force 
that’s decisive. 
Synergy, not Segregation. The synergy, not segregation principle acknowledges that segregation 
guarantees that the whole will never be greater than the sum of its parts. To allow synergy, Airmen 
should have access to the entire theater of operations to maximize the ability to achieve objectives; 
access should not be restricted from any area due to unnecessarily restrictive fire control measures. 
A synergistic mindset opens the battlespace areas of operation and allows maximization of use of 
scarce, high-demand, low-density capabilities and enhances combat effectiveness. 
Integration, not just Synchronization. The integration, not just synchronization principle 
addresses the value of integration over synchronization. Synchronization is defined as “the 
arrangement of military actions in time, space, and purpose to produce maximum relative combat 
power at a decisive place and time.” Integration, by comparison, is defined as “the arrangement of 
military forces and their actions to create a force that operates by engaging as a whole.” 
Synchronization emphasizes timing, while integration considers priority and effect to be both 
efficient and effective with scarce resources. 
The Right Force, not just Equal Shares of the Force. The right force, not just equal shares of 
the force principle address the JP 1 Volume 1 statement that the integration of Joint Forces is 
designed to address both functional and geographic vulnerabilities, but forces will be selected 
based on those who can provide the capabilities needed in each operation. As one senior USAF 
officer said, “Joint warfighting is not like Little League baseball, where everybody gets a chance 
to play.” Any given joint force should be tailored appropriately for the task at hand. Some 
operations will be land- centric, others air-centric, others maritime-, cyberspace-, or information-
centric. The composition of the joint force and the tasks assigned to various elements should reflect 
the needs of the mission. 
6.4.  Principles of Joint Operations 
Throughout the history of conflict, military leaders have noted certain principles that produce 
victory. Known today as the principles of joint operations, these aspects of warfare are found to 
be universally true and relevant. As members of the joint team, Airmen should appreciate how 
these principles apply to all forces but should most fully understand them as they pertain to the 
USAF. Airpower provides unique capabilities, no matter which Service operates the systems, and 
no matter which type of platform is used. These principles of joint operations serve as guidance 
for leaders to evaluate potential courses of action. No one principle should be considered without 
due consideration of the others. The principles of joint operations, combined with the additional 
tenets of airpower (addressed in the next section), provide the basis for a sound and enduring 
doctrine for the air and cyberspace forces of America’s joint force. The principles of joint 
operations, as discussed in JP 3-0, Joint Operations, are addressed here with a USAF perspective. 
The principles of joint operations are formed around the nine traditional principles of war. Three 
additional principles—restraint, perseverance, and legitimacy—are relevant to how the Armed 
Forces of the United States use combat power across the competition continuum. In addition, 
there is a specific principle of operations the USAF uses: unity of effort.

Unity of Command. Unity of command is vital in employing airpower as it ensures appropriate 
concentration and priority of effort by one responsible commander with the authority and the 
capability to direct force employment in pursuit of common objectives. The USAF’s operational- 
level perspective calls for unity of command to gain the most effective and efficient application of 
airpower. Airpower is the product of multiple capabilities, and centralized command is essential 
to effectively fuse these capabilities and provide unity of command. 
Economy of Force. Economy of force is the judicious employment and distribution of force by 
selecting the best mix of airpower capabilities. To ensure overwhelming combat power is 
available, appropriate effort should be devoted to primary objectives and allocate lesser essential 
resources to secondary efforts. Economy of force may require a commander to establish a balance 
in the application of airpower between attacking, defending, delaying, or conducting other 
operations, such as information operations, based on the priority of the objectives. Also, priorities 
may shift rapidly from one type of mission, such as interdiction, to another, such as close air 
support. Although the principle of economy of force suggests the use of overwhelming force in 
one sense, it also recommends against the use of more force than reasonably necessary. 
Maneuver. Maneuver places the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible 
application of combat power in a multidimensional combat space. Airpower’s ability to conduct 
maneuver is not only a product of its speed and range, but maneuverability is also obtained through 
flexibility and versatility established during the planning and execution of operations. The 
principle of maneuver allows potential engagement anywhere, from any direction, at any time, 
forcing the adversary to be on guard everywhere. Applying the principle of maneuver will force 
the enemy to react, allowing the exploitation of successful friendly operations and reducing 
friendly vulnerabilities. Forward deployment of airpower assets is one example of maneuver that, 
by its very presence, can reassure allies and deter aggressors. 
Objective. The principle of objective is to direct military operations toward a defined and 
attainable objective that contributes to established strategic, operational, and tactical goals. In a 
broad sense, the principle of objective holds that political and military goals should be aligned and 
clearly articulated. A clear national military strategy provides focus for defining campaign or 
theater objectives, while at the operational level, campaign or theater objectives determine military 
priorities. From the outset, airpower can pursue tactical, operational, or strategic objectives in any 
combination, or all three simultaneously. From an Airman’s perspective, the principle of objective 
shapes priorities to allow airpower to concentrate on theater or campaign priorities and seeks to 
avoid the siphoning of force elements to fragmented objectives. 
Security. The purpose of the principle of security is to never permit the enemy to acquire an 
unexpected advantage. Critical to security is understanding that it embraces physical, operations, 
and information security. Security may be obtained by staying beyond the enemy’s reach, 
physically and virtually, as airpower is uniquely suited to operate over the horizon. Security from 
physical and electronic intrusion conceals our capabilities and intentions, while allowing friendly 
forces to gather information on the adversary. Security through force protection is an integral part 
of protecting aircraft and fixed bases where they are especially vulnerable. Information is central 
to securing the outcome of a conflict, particularly with today’s advanced communications and 
computer technologies. Security ensures our capabilities of withstanding aerial, ground, and 
cyberspace attacks while sustaining airpower activities against the enemy. 
Offensive. The purpose of an offensive action is to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative, our 
initiative, as efficiently and effectively as possible. The offensive aim is to act rather than react 
and to dictate the time, place, purpose, scope, intensity, and pace of operations. While defensive 
measures may be required at times, success in war is generally attained while on the offensive. All 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
114 
 
 
 
military forces have offensive capabilities, and airpower’s ability to mass, maneuver, and operate 
independently or simultaneously at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of war, provides 
global reach to directly and rapidly take the offensive and seize the initiative. Once seized, the 
initiative should be retained and fully exploited. Through prompt and sustained offensive actions 
designed to attain operational and strategic objectives, airpower causes the enemy to react rather 
than act, denies them the offensive, and ultimately enables our forces to shape the conflict. 
Mass. Concentration of military power through mass is a fundamental consideration in all military 
operations. Today’s airpower is uniquely capable of launching an attack from widely dispersed 
locations and massing combat power at the objective, whether that objective is a single physical 
location or widely dispersed enemy systems. Airpower, with speed, range, and flexibility, 
complemented by accuracy and lethality of precision weapons and advances in information 
technologies, achieves mass through highly effective attack rather than overwhelming by 
necessarily large numbers of forces. USAF cyberspace capabilities, often enabled by space 
systems, allow dispersed forces to collaborate to rapidly find, fix, and track fleeting targets, and 
mass a response with precise effects around the globe. 
Surprise. Surprise is one of airpower’s strongest advantages. Surprise leverages the principle of 
security by attacking the enemy at a time, place, or in a manner for which they are not prepared. 
The speed and range of air and cyberspace capabilities, coupled with their flexibility and 
versatility, enable the element of surprise, and enhance and empower other forces to achieve 
surprise as well. The rapid global reach of airpower can enable surface forces to reach foreign 
destinations quickly, capitalizing on surprise and thus seizing the initiative. 
Simplicity. Simplicity calls for avoiding unnecessary complexity in organizing, preparing, 
planning, and conducting military operations. Simplicity ensures that guidance, plans, and orders 
are as simple and direct as a military objective allows. Simple guidance allows subordinate 
CCDRs the freedom to operate creatively within their portion of the operational environment, 
supporting the concept of decentralized execution. Common equipment, a common understanding 
of Service and joint doctrine, and familiarity with procedures through joint exercises and training, 
can help overcome complexity while implementing straightforward plans, providing 
unambiguous organization, and establishing clearly defined command relationships. 
Restraint. The purpose of restraint is to prevent the unnecessary use of force. Restraint requires 
the careful and disciplined balancing of the need for security, the conduct of military operations, 
and the achievement of national objectives. Excessive force antagonizes those parties involved, 
thereby damaging the legitimacy of the organization that uses it while potentially enhancing the 
legitimacy of the opposing party. Sufficiently detailed rules of engagement the commander tailors 
to the specific circumstances of the operation can help facilitate appropriate restraint. 
Perseverance. The purpose of perseverance is to ensure the commitment necessary to achieve 
national objectives. Perseverance involves preparation for measured, protracted military 
operations in pursuit of national objectives. Some joint operations may require years to reach the 
termination criteria. The patient, resolute, and persistent pursuit of national goals and objectives is 
essential to success. This will frequently involve diplomatic, economic, and informational 
measures to supplement military efforts. 
Legitimacy. The purpose of legitimacy is to maintain legal and moral authority in the conduct of 
operations. Legitimacy, which can be a decisive factor in operations, is based on the actual and 
perceived legality, morality, and rightness of the actions from the various perspectives of interested 
audiences. These audiences will include our national leadership and domestic population, 
governments and civilian populations in the operational area, partner nations and allies, and nations 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
115 
 
 
 
and organizations around the world. 
Unity of Effort (additional Air Force Principle, AFDP 1). The purpose of this principle is to 
ensure that a wide range of components, agencies, and partners operating during a contingency 
coordinate their actions and resources and focus on the same goal. This is a vital principle for the 
USAF, especially when working in an interagency and multinational environment. 
6.5.  Tenets of Airpower 
The application of airpower is refined by several fundamental guiding truths; these truths are 
known as the tenets of airpower. The tenets of airpower reflect a unique historical and doctrinal 
evolution of airpower, as well as a current appreciation for the nature of airpower. While 
complementing the principles of joint operations, which provide general guidance on the 
application of military forces, these tenets provide specific considerations for the employment of 
airpower. These tenets require informed judgment in application and a skillful blending to tailor 
them to the ever-changing operational environment. Airmen at all levels must accept the fact that 
war is incredibly complex, and no two operations are identical. The tenets of airpower, as defined 
in AFDP 1, are described here. 
Mission Command. The Airman’s philosophy for the command and control (C2) of airpower is 
mission command. Mission command is an approach to C2 that empowers subordinate decision- 
making for flexibility, initiative, and responsiveness in the accomplishment of commander’s 
intent. Mission command provides Airmen operating in environments of increasing uncertainty, 
complexity, and rapid change with the freedom of action needed to exploit emergent opportunities 
and succeed. Given the global reach and strategic effects of airpower, the USAF’s approach to 
mission command balances the need for tactical flexibility with the management of global risks. 
Airmen execute mission command through centralized command, distributed control, and 
decentralized execution. Centralized command is the organizing standard for the effective and 
efficient means of employing airpower; it enables the principle of mass while maintaining the 
principle of economy of force. Because of airpower’s potential to directly affect the strategic and 
operational levels of warfare, it should be commanded by a single Airman, the air component 
commander. Distributed control exploits airpower’s flexibility and versatility to ensure that it 
remains responsive, survivable, and sustainable. Decentralized execution is the delegation of 
authority to achieve effective span of control, foster disciplined initiative, and empower 
subordinates to exploit fleeting opportunities. 
Flexibility and Versatility. With flexibility and versatility, airpower has the potential to achieve 
unmatched synergy through asymmetric and parallel operations. Flexibility allows airpower to 
shift from one JFC objective to another, quickly and decisively; to re-role assets quickly from a 
preplanned mission to support an unanticipated need. Versatility is the ability to employ airpower 
effectively at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war and provide a wide variety of 
tasks in concert with other joint elements. Cyberspace capabilities are especially able to 
simultaneously support multiple taskings around the globe and support tasks at all levels of 
warfare. 
Synergistic Effects. The proper, synergistic application of a coordinated force across multiple 
domains can produce desired effects that exceed the contributions of forces otherwise employed 
individually. Rather than causing the destruction of a large number of targets through attrition 
warfare, the objective of achieving synergistic effects is the precise, coordinated application of the 
various elements of airpower and surface power to bring disproportionate pressure upon enemy 
leaders to comply with our national will (affecting their intent) or to cause functional defeat of the 
enemy forces (affecting their capability). Airpower is unique in its ability to dictate the tempo and 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
116 
 
 
 
direction of an entire warfighting effort regardless of the scale of the operation. 
Persistence. Airpower operations may be conducted continuously against a broad spectrum of 
targets, with persistence. Airpower’s exceptional speed and range allow its forces to visit and 
revisit wide ranges of targets or territories nearly at will, and with resolve. Airpower does not have 
to occupy terrain or remain constantly in proximity to areas of operation to bring a powerful 
response. Unmanned aircraft systems offer similar possibilities from the atmosphere. 
Persistence keeps pressure on and denies the enemy the ability to circumvent strategic effects. 
Demonstrations of persistent operations could range from maintaining a continuous flow of 
materiel to peacetime distressed areas; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities 
monitoring adversaries; assuring targets are kept continually out of commission; or ensuring 
resources and facilities are denied an enemy or provided to an ally during a specified time. The 
end result would be to deny the opponent an opportunity to seize the initiative and to directly 
accomplish assigned tasks. 
Concentration. One of the most constant and important trends throughout military history has 
been the effort of applying concentrated, overwhelming power at the decisive time and place. 
Because the versatility of airpower, with its lethality, speed, and persistence, makes it an attractive 
option for many tasks, the demand often exceeds the available forces. Without concentration of 
efforts, fragmentation of the integrated airpower effort could occur in attempts to fulfill the many 
demands of the mission. To prevent the triple risk of failing to achieve operational-level objectives, 
delaying, or diminishing the attainment of decisive effects, and increasing the attrition rate of the 
force, Airmen should guard against the inadvertent dilution of airpower effects resulting from high 
demand and maintain the capability of employing concentrated efforts when most applicable. 
Priority. The application of airpower should be balanced among its ability to conduct operations 
at all levels of war, often simultaneously. Commanders of all components and all levels should 
establish clear priorities for the use of airpower to effectively prioritize their requirements for 
coordinated airpower effects. The air component commander should assess the possible uses of 
component forces and their strengths and capabilities to support the overall joint campaign. 
Limited resources require that airpower be applied where it can make the greatest contribution to 
the most critical current joint force commander requirements. 
Balance. Much of the skill of an air component commander is reflected in the dynamic and correct 
balancing of the principles of joint operations and the tenets of airpower. An air component 
commander should balance combat opportunity, necessity, effectiveness, efficiency, and the 
impact on accomplishing assigned objectives against the associated risk to friendly forces. An 
Airman is uniquely and best suited to determine the proper theater-wide balance between offensive 
and defensive air operations, and among strategic, operational, and tactical applications. Airpower 
assets are normally available only in finite numbers; thus, balance is a crucial determinant for 
mission requirements.

6.6.  The Joint Team 
Airpower has demonstrated its success to meet our homeland and international security challenges 
by leveraging our respective joint capabilities and maximizing synergistic results. Capabilities 
such as cyberspace operations aim to guarantee our capability to operate in any contested 
cyberspace domain to support vital land, maritime, air, and space missions by employing 
capabilities to protect essential military cyberspace systems and to speed their recovery if an attack 
does occur. In the increasingly interdependent warfighting domains, the USAF possesses unique 
capabilities for ensuring global mobility; long-range strike; and effective intelligence, surveillance, 
and reconnaissance. 
We now rarely see any one Service or even any one country unilaterally plan, organize, or execute 
an operation. Instead, we see greater inclusiveness with joint, coalition, and sometimes interagency 
partners, whereby we depend on each other to succeed in today’s complex environment. Through 
this interdependence the joint force is able to select the right resources and capabilities from each 
partner. These capabilities are not just used when a contingency arises but are synergized and 
tested through such venues as exercises and peacetime operations to ensure all joint, interagency, 
and multinational partners can achieve the desired objectives at the right time and right place. 
Joint Operations. Although individual services may plan and conduct operations to accomplish 
tasks and missions in support of Department of Defense objectives, the Department of Defense 
more typically employs at least two services from at least two military departments in a single 
operation, particularly in combat, through joint operations. A joint operation is the general term 
used to describe military actions conducted by joint forces in specified command relationships. 
Joint operations include combat when necessary to achieve objectives at all levels of warfare. 
Based on the fundamental principles for joint command and control, joint forces are organized 
for effective and efficient operations, and commanders are delegated the necessary command 
authorities to plan, direct, and control their forces to accomplish assigned missions. 
Multinational Operations. As our nation and its armed forces are confronted with a multitude of 
priorities, we must be mindful to advance only the necessary resources to ensure that the right 
capabilities are integrated, and that they are interoperable across all domains. Competing priorities 
today must be carefully measured against all military capabilities, ensuring that quality—not 
necessarily quantity—smartly contributes to a faster, more flexible, and agile response force. As 
well, we must rely on the strengths of other national partners, while ensuring all capabilities are 
interoperable to ensure we can achieve our overarching objectives. 
One of the first successful operational actions of combining joint and multinational forces was 
experienced during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. These operations demonstrated 
the value and effectiveness of joint and coalition military operations. The unique capabilities of 
each of our military Services, and those of each of our partners, were exploited during various 
phases of both operations. The coalition force provided a synergistic combat capability which 
brought the greatest possible military power to bear against the opponent. Likewise, our experience 
also reaffirmed the importance of joint and multinational training, the value of forward presence, 
and the validity of sequencing for power-projection. 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
118 
 
 
 
Unity of Command and Unity of Effort. Unity of command means all forces operate under a 
single commander with the requisite authority to direct all forces employed in pursuit of a common 
purpose. Unity of effort, however, requires coordination and cooperation among all forces toward 
a commonly recognized objective, although they are not necessarily part of the same command 
structure. During multinational operations and interagency coordination, unity of command may 
not be possible, but the requirement for unity of effort becomes paramount. Unity of effort – 
coordination through cooperation and common interests – is an essential complement to unity of 
command. Note: One of the founding initiatives which addressed joint interdependence and joint 
interoperability was the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. 
6.7.  Command Authorities 
Combatant Command (Command Authority). Combatant command (command authority), 
abbreviated as COCOM, is the authority of a CCDR to perform functions of command over 
assigned forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, 
designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations, 
joint training (or in the case of U.S. Special Operations Command, training of assigned forces), 
and logistics necessary to accomplish the missions assigned to the command. It cannot be 
delegated or transferred. 
Operational Control. Operational control (OPCON) is inherent in COCOM and is the authority 
to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and 
employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative 
direction necessary to accomplish the mission. OPCON is the command authority that may be 
exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of CCMD and may be delegated 
within the command. While OPCON includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military 
operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command, it does 
not include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal 
organization, or unit training. 
Tactical Control. Tactical control (TACON) is inherent in OPCON and is the command authority 
over assigned or attached forces or commands, or military capability of forces made available for 
taskings that are limited to the detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers within 
the operational area necessary to accomplish assigned missions or tasks. TACON may be 
delegated to and exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of CCMD. 
Support. Support is a command authority and is established by a superior commander between 
subordinate commanders when one organization should aid, protect, complement, or sustain 
another force. The designation of supporting relationships is important as it conveys priorities to 
commanders and staffs who are planning or executing joint operations. The establishing authority 
(the common superior commander) is responsible for ensuring that both the supported commander 
and supporting commanders understand the degree of authority that the supported commander is 
granted. The supported commander should ensure that the supporting commanders understand the 
assistance required. The supporting commanders will then provide the assistance needed, subject 
to a supporting commander’s existing capabilities and other assigned tasks. 
Administrative Control. Administrative control (ADCON) is direction or exercise of authority 
over subordinate or other organizations in respect to administration and support. ADCON is a 
Service authority that flows through Service channels. This authority is not an operational 
command authority but provides the requisite authority for Services to execute their individual 
“organize, train, and equip” functions per Title 10, USC. ADCON may be delegated to and 
exercised by commanders of Service forces assigned to a CCDR at any echelon at or below the 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
119 
 
 
 
level of Service component command. ADCON is subject to the command authority of CCDRs. 
Service commanders exercising ADCON will not usurp the authorities assigned by a CCDR 
having COCOM over commanders of assigned Service forces. Note: When mobilized under Title 
10, USC, command of National Guard and Reserve Forces (except those specifically exempted) 
is assigned by the Secretary of Defense to the CCMDs. These forces are available for operational 
missions when mobilized for specific periods or when ordered to RegAF after being validated for 
employment by their parent Service. 
6.8.  Joint Force Organization 
A joint force is a force composed of elements, assigned, or attached, of two or more Military 
Departments operating under a single joint force commander. Joint forces are established at three 
levels: unified CCMDs, subordinate unified commands, and joint task forces. These organizations 
are commanded by a JFC. 
Joint Force Commander. A JFC is a term applied to a CCDR, subunified commander, or joint 
task force commander authorized to exercise COCOM or operational control over a joint force. 
JFC’s responsibilities are to provide a clear commander’s intent and timely communication of 
specified tasks, together with any required coordinating and reporting requirements. A JFC is 
responsible for the transfer of forces and other capabilities to designated subordinate commanders 
for accomplishing assigned tasks. A JFC will provide all available information to subordinate 
commanders that affect their assigned missions and objectives. 
Commander, Air Force Forces. The title of commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) is 
reserved to identify the USAF commander of a USAF component. This component could be 
assigned or attached to a joint force at the unified CCMD, subordinate unified CCMD, or joint 
task force level. Operationally, the COMAFFOR should be prepared to employ Air Force Forces 
as directed by the JFC, and if designated, be prepared to employ joint air forces as the joint force 
air component commander (JFACC). The COMAFFOR should normally be designated at a 
command level above the operating forces and should not be dual- hatted as commander of one 
of the subordinate operating units. This enables the COMAFFOR to focus at the operational level 
of war, while subordinate commanders lead their units at the tactical level. Since the COMAFFOR 
and JFACC are nearly always the same individual, the USAF prefers to use the term “air 
component commander” when referring to duties or functions that could be carried out by either 
or both, unless explicit use of the term “COMAFFOR” or “JFACC” is necessary for clarity. This 
duality of authorities is expressed in the axiom: Airmen work for Airmen and the senior Airman 
works for the JFC. 
Air Expeditionary Task Force. The air expeditionary task force (AETF) is the primary means by 
which the USAF presents forces to a JFC during contingency operations when no existing USAF 
component already exists, such as when a joint task force is established. AETFs are sized and 
tailored to meet the JFC’s specific mission requirements. When forming an AETF, the 
COMAFFOR should draw first from in-theater resources, if available. If augmentation is needed, 
or if in-theater forces are not available, the USAF will draw from the air expeditionary force 
currently on rotation. These forces, whether in-theater or deployed from out of theater, should be 
fully supported with the requisite maintenance, logistical support, health services, and 
administrative elements. These forces will form up within the air expeditionary task force as 
expeditionary wings, groups, squadrons, flights, detachments, or elements, to provide reasonable 
spans of command and control elements at appropriate levels, and to provide unit identity. 
Air Operations Center. The air operations center (AOC) is the senior agency of the COMAFFOR 
that provides command and control of Air Force Forces and coordinates with other components 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
120 
 
 
 
and Services. An AOC may be regional or functional, aligning with the purpose of the joint force 
they support. The AOC includes requisite planning, intelligence, employment, mobility, and 
assessment capabilities to plan and conduct air operations. If the COMAFFOR is also designated 
as the JFACC, the AOC will typically receive joint augmentation and become the joint AOC 
(JAOC). 
Air Force Forces Staff. The COMAFFOR needs a command entity responsible for the 
deployment, sustainment, and administration of Air Force Forces. The AFFOR staff is the 
mechanism through which the COMAFFOR exercises these Service responsibilities. These 
sustainment activities are commonly referred to as “beds, beans, and bullets.” The AFFOR staff is 
also responsible for the long-range planning and theater engagement operations that fall outside 
the AOC’s current operational focus. 
Joint Force Air Component Commander. If air assets from more than one Service are present 
within a joint force, the JFC normally will designate a JFACC to exploit the full capabilities of 
joint air operations. The JFACC is typically the Service component commander with the 
preponderance of air capabilities and the ability to plan, task, and control joint air operations. The 
JFACC recommends the proper employment of Air Force Forces from multiple components to the 
JFC. The JFACC also plans, coordinates, allocates, executes, and assesses air operations to 
accomplish assigned operational missions. Because of the wide scope of air operations, the JFACC 
will typically maintain the same joint operating area/theater-wide perspective as the JFC. The 
JFACC, as with any component commander, should not be dual hatted as the JFC. The 
COMAFFOR exercises operational control of Air Force Forces, and acting as a JFACC, normally 
exercises tactical control of any Navy, Army, Marine, and coalition air assets made available for 
tasking. As such, the term “air component commander” is the preferred term when the commander 
is so dual-hatted. If working with partner nations in a multinational operation, the JFACC may be 
designated as the combined/coalition force air component commander (CFACC), responsible for 
planning, coordinating, and tasking of all multinational air operations. Note: Historic experience 
has shown that in joint operations the COMAFFOR is normally designated as the JFACC, as the 
USAF typically has the preponderance of air capabilities. In anticipation of this, the Air Force 
plans, and trains to employ an air component commander to perform both roles, and the AOC plans 
and trains to be a JAOC.

6.9.  Joint Planning Process 
Joint planning consists of planning activities associated with joint military operations by CCDRs 
and their subordinate Joint Force Commanders in response to contingencies and crises. Joint 
planning is a means of preparing and managing Joint Forces for mobilization, deployment, 
employment, sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization. At the national level, joint planning 
ties the military instrument of national power to the achievement of national security goals and 
objectives and is essential to securing strategic end-states across the range of military operations. 
Planning begins with the end state in mind, providing a unifying purpose around which actions 
and resources are focused. Note: Military end state is the set of required conditions that defines 
achievement of military objectives. It normally represents a point in time or circumstances beyond 
which the U.S. President does not require the military as the primary means to achieve remaining 
national objectives. Aside from its obvious association with strategic or operational objectives, 
clearly defining the military end state promotes unity of effort, facilitates synchronization, helps 
clarify, and may reduce risk. 
Integrated Planning Process. While the focus of joint planning is at the CCDR level, planning 
is conducted at every echelon of command and across the range of military operations. Joint 
planning employs an integrated process for orderly, analytical, and coordinated problem solving 
and decision-making known as the joint planning process. In peacetime, the process is structured 
to support the thorough, fully coordinated development of contingency plans. In crisis, the process 
can be adapted to support the dynamic requirements of changing events. In wartime, the process 
is modified to accommodate greater decentralization of planning activities. 
Joint Planning Process Steps. The Joint Planning Process is a seven-step orderly, analytical set 
of logical steps to frame a problem; examine a mission; develop, analyze, and compare alternative 
COAs; select the best COA; and produce a plan or order. The joint planning process consists of 
seven steps identified here. 
Step 1: Planning Initiation. Joint planning begins when an appropriate authority recognizes 
potential for military capability to be employed in support of national objectives or in response to 
a potential or actual crisis. At the strategic level, that authority—the President, SecDef, or CJCS— 
initiates planning by deciding to develop military options. Presidential directives, the National 
Security Strategy (NSS), Unified Command Plan (UCP), Contingency Planning Guidance (CPG), 
National Defense Strategy (NDS), National Military Strategy (NMS), Joint Strategic Capabilities 
Plan (JSCP), and related strategic guidance documents serve as the primary guidance to begin 
planning. 
Step 2: Mission Analysis. The CCDR and staff develop a restated mission statement that allows 
subordinate and supporting commanders to begin their own estimates and planning efforts for 
higher headquarters’ concurrence. The joint force’s mission is the task or set of tasks, together 
with the purpose, that clearly indicates the action to be taken and the reason for doing so. Mission 
analysis is used to study the assigned tasks and to identify all other tasks necessary to accomplish 
the mission. Mission analysis focuses the commander and the staff on the problem at hand and 
lays a foundation for effective planning. 
 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
122 
 
 
 
Step 3: Course of Action Development. A COA is a potential way (solution, method) to 
accomplish the assigned mission. Staffs develop multiple COAs to provide commanders with 
options to attain the military end state. A good COA accomplishes the mission within the 
commander’s guidance, provides flexibility to meet unforeseen events during execution, and 
positions the joint force for future operations. It also gives components the maximum latitude for 
initiative. All COAs must be suitable, feasible, acceptable, distinguishable, and complete. 
Step 4: Course of Action Analysis and Wargaming. The COA analysis step closely examines 
potential COAs to reveal details that will allow the commander and staff to evaluate them and 
identify advantages and disadvantages. Wargaming is a primary means for COA analysis. 
Wargames are representations of conflict or competition in a synthetic environment, in which 
people make decisions and respond to the consequences of those decisions. COA wargaming is a 
conscious attempt to visualize the flow of the operation, given joint force strengths and 
dispositions, adversary capabilities and possible COAs, and other aspects of the Operating 
Environment (OE). Each critical event within a proposed COA should be wargamed based upon 
time available using the action, reaction, and counteraction method of friendly and/or opposing 
force interaction. 
Step 5: Course of Action Comparison. COA comparison is both a subjective and objective 
process, whereby COAs are considered independently and evaluated/compared against a set of 
criteria that are established by the staff and commander. The objective is to identify and 
recommend the COA that has the highest probability of accomplishing the mission and is 
acceptable. COA comparison facilitates the commander’s decision-making process by balancing 
the ends, means, ways, and risk of each COA. The end product of this task is a briefing to the 
commander on a COA recommendation and a decision by the commander. 
Step 6: Course of Action Approval. In the COA approval step, the staff briefs the commander 
on the COA comparison and wargaming results and recommends a COA for approval. The 
commander may approve the COA, modify it, or direct the staff to reiterate portions of the joint 
operation planning process. 
Step 7: Plan or Order Development. Planning results in a plan that is documented in the format 
of a plan or an order. If execution is imminent or in progress, the plan is typically documented in 
the format of an order. During plan or order development, the commander, and staff, in 
collaboration with subordinate and supporting components and organizations, expand the 
approved COA into a detailed plan or operations order (OPORD) by refining the initial concept of 
operations (CONOPS) associated with the approved COA. 
6.10.  Joint Planning 
Joint planning is the deliberate process of determining how to implement strategic guidance: how 
(the ways) to use military capabilities (the means) in time and space to achieve objectives (the 
ends) within an acceptable level of risk. Ideally, planning begins with specified national strategic 
objectives and military end states to provide a unifying purpose around which actions and 
resources are focused. Leaders conduct joint planning to understand the strategic and operational 
environments to determine the best methods for employing the Department of Defense’s 
capabilities to achieve national objectives. Joint planning identifies military ways and means the 
President can align with other instruments of national power (diplomatic, informational, and 
economic). In the process, joint planning frames the problem; aligns ends, ways, and means; 
develops operational approaches; accounts for risk; and gives leaders decision space with proposed 
military options. CCDRs may propose objectives for the President and Secretary of Defense’s 
(SecDef’s) consideration before beginning detailed planning. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
123 
 
 
 
Staff (CJCS), as the principal military advisor to the President and SecDef, may offer military 
advice on the proposed objectives and global prioritization. 
Campaign Plans. Campaign plans organize the day-to-day operations of the joint force to shape 
the OE and achieve national objectives. They establish objectives, conditions, and tasks under 
which the united or specified CCMD and Service components build operations, activities, and 
investments to achieve objectives (set conditions) in support of national policy. CCMD campaigns 
are proactive and rarely feature a single measure of military success implying victory in the 
traditional sense. A campaign is a series of related military operations to achieve strategic and 
operational objectives in a given time and space. Campaigns are planned when contemplated 
objectives exceed the scope of a single operation. Thus, campaigns are often the most extensive 
joint operations in terms of time and other resources. CCDRs document the full scope of their 
campaigns in plans that include the campaign plan and all of its subordinate and supporting plans. 
Contingency Plans. Contingency plans are typically prepared in advance to address an anticipated 
crisis and must be modified during execution to respond to conditions at the time. A contingency 
is a situation that likely would involve military forces in response to natural and man-made 
disasters, terrorists, subversives, military operations by foreign powers, or other situations as 
directed by the U.S. President or Secretary of Defense. The Joint Planning and Execution 
Community uses contingency planning to develop plans for a broad range of contingencies. 
Commanders and staffs prepare supporting plans that describe how supporting commanders intend 
to achieve their assigned objectives and/or tasks. Supporting commanders and staffs develop these 
plans responsively in collaboration with the supported commander’s planners. As part of this 
collaborative process, supported commanders specify the level of detail required and review and 
approve the resulting supporting plans. 
6.11.  Planning in Crisis 
A crisis is an incident or situation that creates a condition of such national security importance that 
the President or SecDef may consider a commitment of U.S. military forces and resources to 
achieve or defend national objectives. Crises may evolve over time (e.g., escalating civil war, 
humanitarian crisis) or develop quickly (e.g., hostage rescue, natural disaster) with little or no 
warning and require accelerated decision making. Sometimes a single crisis may generate other 
crises elsewhere. Multiple crises can also concurrently impact two or more CCDRs. Furthermore, 
there may be a single threat with transregional implications that simultaneously threatens two or 
more CCDRs. In these situations, supported and supporting command relationships may be fluid. 
Forces and capabilities committed to mitigate emergent threats will likely require dynamic 
reallocation or reprioritization. These situations, increasingly the norm, highlight the importance 
of integrated planning and making force management decisions from a risk-informed, global 
perspective. Planning in response to a crisis generally results in the publication of an order and 
the execution of an operation. Crisis planning should help senior leaders determine if a military 
response can help achieve the desired objective at acceptable cost and risk levels. 
Joint Planning and Execution Community. The Joint Planning and Execution Community 
(JPEC) monitor, plan, assess, and execute joint operations to ensure the Joint Force Commander’s 
seamless transition from planning to execution during times of crisis. This process spans across 
organizational levels, including the interaction between Secretary of Defense and CCDRs which 
ultimately helps the U.S. President and Secretary of Defense decide when, where, and how to 
commit U.S. Armed Forces. Clear strategic guidance and frequent interaction between senior 
leaders and planners promote early understanding and agreement for planning assumptions, 
considerations, risks, and other key factors.

6.12.  Joint Operation Orders 
Important aspects and types of joint operation orders are described here. 
Warning Order. A warning order (WARNORD), issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, is a planning directive that initiates the development and evaluation of military courses of 
action (COAs) by a supported commander and requests that the supported commander submit a 
commander’s estimate. 
Planning Order. A planning order (PLANORD) is a planning directive that provides essential 
planning guidance and directs the initiation of plan development before the directing authority 
approves a military COA. 
Alert Order. An alert order (ALERTORD) is a planning directive that provides essential planning 
guidance and directs the initiation of plan development after the directing authority approves a 
military COA. An ALERTORD does not authorize execution of the approved COA. 
Prepare to Deploy Order. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by the authority of and at 
the direction of the U.S. President or Secretary of Defense, issues a prepare to deploy order to 
increase or decrease the deployability posture of units; to deploy or redeploy forces; or to direct 
any other action that would signal planned military action or its termination in response to a 
particular crisis event or incident. 
Deployment/Redeployment Order. A deployment or redeployment order is a planning directive 
from the Secretary of Defense, issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which 
authorizes and directs the transfer of forces between CCMDs by reassignment or attachment. A 
deployment or redeployment order normally specifies the authority that the gaining CCDR will 
exercise over the transferred forces. 
Concept of Operations. A concept of operations (CONOPS) is a statement or outline used to 
present a commander’s assumptions or intent with regard to an operation or series of operations. 
CONOPS are designed to give an overall picture of an operation or emerging issue. 
Execution Order. Only the U.S. President and Secretary of Defense have the authority to approve 
and direct the initiation of military operations. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by the 
authority of and at the direction of the U.S. President or Secretary of Defense, may subsequently 
issue an execute order (EXORD) to initiate military operations. Supported and supporting 
commanders and subordinate Joint Force Commanders use an EXORD to implement the approved 
CONOPS. 
Operation Order. An operation order (OPORD) is a directive issued by a commander to 
subordinate commanders for the purpose of effecting the coordinated execution of an operation. 
Joint OPORDs are prepared under joint procedures in prescribed formats during crisis action 
planning. 
Fragmentary Order. A fragmentary order (FRAGORD) is an abbreviated form of a verbal, 
written, or digital operation order, which eliminates the need for restating information contained 
in a basic operation order while enabling dissemination of changes to previous orders. It is usually 
issued as needed or on a day-to-day basis.

7.1.  Commitment to Responsibility – A Team of Teams 
Many enlisted Airmen have officers or civilians as direct supervisors. There is a compelling need 
for officers, civilian personnel, and enlisted Airmen to have a deliberate and common approach to 
force development, career progression, and the assumption of increased supervisory and leadership 
responsibilities. Each day as we execute our missions, we should all be familiar with and 
understand these responsibilities and how they relate to the force structure. Our force structure, 
core values, foundational and occupational competencies, describe what makes us Airmen. 
Officer Responsibilities. The officer force structure is comprised of three distinct and separate 
tiers. The tiers are Company Grade Officer with grades O-1 thru O-3, Field Grade Officer with 
grades O-4 thru O-6, and General Officer, with grades of O-7 thru O-10. Progression through the 
tiers correlates to increased levels of leadership and managerial responsibilities, with each tier 
building on previous responsibilities and focusing on developing the appropriate tactical, 
operational, and strategic competencies associated with their rank and position. Therefore, General 
Officers are expected to have mastered Field Grade Officer responsibilities. Likewise, Field Grade 
Officers are expected to have mastered Company Grade Officer responsibilities. Above all, the 
focus of each tier is leadership, professionalism, and mission success in the profession of arms. 
Enlisted Responsibilities. Functionally, the USAF develops technical experts through career field 
progression and succession planning. Institutionally, the USAF strives to develop experienced 
leaders. From the earliest stages, Airmen and supervisors must comprehend the progression path 
for technical and professional development. As Airmen demonstrate expertise and potential, 
opportunities should be made available to encourage more responsibility and increased leadership 
roles. Developmental opportunities, such as deployments, exercises, joint assignments, special 
duty assignments, and headquarters staff assignments, offer unique perspectives on how the USAF 
functions. Effective career progression and development are dependent upon deliberate 
conversations between supervisors and subordinates regarding career field and USAF 
requirements, personal qualifications, and goals. 
Civilian Responsibilities. The USAF Civil Service consists of more than 180,000 professional 
civilians in over 35 countries. Within 11 personnel systems there are 22 career fields, 472 
occupational series, and 27 different pay plans. Civilians serve in critical positions, such as 
scientists, engineers, contract specialists, instructors, intelligence experts, mechanics, human 
resource professionals, firefighters, aircraft mechanics, childcare providers, and many others. They 
provide corporate knowledge and stability across the USAF and deploy to various contingency 
areas. Civilians are fundamental to the strength of our USAF, and like the enlisted and officer 
corps, have a compelling need for a deliberate and common approach to force development, career 
progression, and the assumption of increased supervisory and leadership responsibilities. 
7.2.  Continuum of Learning 
Force development generally results in leadership, management, and warrior ethos proficiency. 
The force development construct is a framework that links developmental needs with foundational 
competencies through the continuum of learning. Occupational competency development 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
126 
 
 
 
generally results in technical skill proficiency. The continuum of learning, along with the defined 
competencies, are aligned to ensure Airmen are qualified and ready to meet the challenges of 
current and future operating environments. The continuum of learning is a career-long process of 
development where challenging experiences are combined with education and training through a 
common taxonomy to produce Airmen who possess the tactical expertise, operational competence, 
and strategic vision to lead and execute the full-spectrum of USAF missions. 
The three distinct levels associated with leadership skills are: tactical expertise, operational 
competence, and strategic vision. These levels are recognized with varying emphasis across the 
foundational competencies. As Airmen progress from tactical expertise to strategic vision 
leadership levels, emphasis on the use of foundational competencies shifts to a broader focus. The 
nature and scope of leadership as well as preferred leadership methods differ based on the level of 
leadership and responsibilities. 
Tactical Expertise. Development at the tactical expertise level includes a general understanding 
of team leadership and an appreciation for organization leadership. It is a time to master core duty 
skills, gain experience in applying those skills, and begin acquiring knowledge and experience 
essential for demonstrating effective, ethical leadership. Airmen at the tactical expertise level learn 
to become the USAF’s primary technicians and specialists, assimilate into the USAF culture, and 
adopt the USAF core values. The tactical expertise level is a time for honing followership abilities, 
motivating subordinates, and influencing peers to accomplish the mission while developing a 
warrior ethos and exercising communication skills as effectively and efficiently as possible. 
Operational Competence. Development at the operational competence leadership level includes 
developing a broader understanding of the USAF perspective and the integration of diverse 
capabilities in operational execution. It is a time to transition from specialists to leaders with an 
understanding of themselves as leaders and followers, while applying an understanding of 
organizational and team dynamics. It is a time to lead teams by developing and inspiring others 
and taking care of people. It is a time to foster collaborative relationships through building teams 
and coalitions, especially within large organizations, and negotiating with others, often external to 
the organization. The majority of enlisted Airmen operate at the tactical expertise and operational 
competence levels. 
Strategic Vision. Development at the strategic vision level includes combining highly developed 
personal and people/team institutional competencies, applying broad organizational competencies, 
and leading and directing exceptionally complex and multi-tiered organizations. It is a time to 
develop a deep understanding of how Airmen achieve synergistic results and desired effects with 
their operational capabilities. It is a time when an Airman employs military capabilities, 
understands the operational and strategic arts, and has a thorough understanding of unit, USAF, 
joint, and coalition capabilities. Development at the strategic vision level includes an enterprise 
perspective with a thorough understanding of the structure and relationships needed to accomplish 
strategic objectives. The strategic vision level focuses on the effects an Airman can have across 
the USAF and on the Department of Defense. 
7.3.  Core Competencies 
Core competencies are about big picture concepts that the USAF does, or is expected to do or 
know, all the time. Being competent means that a person or organization has the necessary 
abilities or qualities to perform or function successfully. Core competencies are a key set of 
abilities or qualities at the heart of the organization’s reason for being. For the USAF, core 
competencies are those special abilities and qualities we collectively possess that enable us to 
function successfully and create airpower effects. Some core competencies are unique to the USAF 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
127 
 
 
 
and distinguish us from our sister services, while other core competencies are aligned across the 
branches of service. 
Occupational Competencies. Occupational competencies are required of Airmen within a 
specific workforce category or specialty. Occupational competencies describe technical/functional 
knowledge, skills and abilities needed to perform that function’s mission successfully. Refer to 
AFH 36-2647, Competency Modeling, for additional details. 
Airman’s Foundational Competencies. Foundational competencies prepare Airmen to operate 
successfully across the widest array of USAF tasks and requirements, and to adapt in a constantly 
changing operational environment. They are broadly applicable across (enlisted, officer, and 
civilian) USAF members, spanning all occupations, functions, and organizational levels, and form 
the framework for force development in the USAF. Foundational competencies are observable, 
measurable patterns of knowledge, skills and abilities needed to perform successfully across a 
USAF career. The Foundational competencies are enduring and encompass attributes the USAF 
believes are critical to mission success. The Foundational competencies are grouped into four 
major categories: Developing Self, Developing Others, Developing Ideas, and Developing 
Organizations. Each of these competency categories is addressed in subsequent chapters of AFH 
1. Refer to AFH 36-2647, Competency Modeling, for additional details.

7.4.  Enlisted Force Structure Framework 
To best leverage our resources, we must have a consistent, well-defined set of expectations, 
standards, and growth opportunities for all Airmen, regardless of rank or specialty. The enlisted 
force structure fulfills a compelling need for a deliberate and common approach to force 
development, career progression, increased supervisory, and leadership responsibilities. The 
enlisted force structure provides the framework to best meet mission requirements while 
developing foundational and occupational competencies. It is comprised of three distinct and 
separate tiers, each correlating to increased levels of education, training, and experience, which 
build increasing levels of proficiency, leadership, and managerial responsibilities. 
7.5.  Junior Enlisted Tier 
The junior enlisted tier consists of the ranks: Airman Basic, Airman, Airman First Class, and 
Senior Airman. Initial enlisted accessions enter the USAF in this tier and are introduced to the 
foundational competencies. They focus on adapting to the military, being part of the profession of 
arms, achieving occupational proficiency, and learning to be productive members of the USAF. In 
this tier, Airmen are trained, qualified, and ready to operate at home station and in an expeditionary 
environment, and they prepare for increased responsibilities. Junior enlisted Airmen will progress 
early in their career through the Airmanship Continuum of 100 (BMT), 200 (Technical Training) 
and 300 (First-Term Airmen Center). 
Airman Basic and Newly Enlisted Airmen. Airmen Basic, as well as Airmen who initially enlist 
in the USAF as Airman or Airman First Class, are primarily adapting to the military profession, 
acquiring knowledge of USAF standards, customs, courtesies, as well as striving to attain 
occupational proficiency under close supervision. The written abbreviation for Airman Basic is 
“AB” and the official term of address is “Airman Basic” or “Airman.” 
Airman. Airmen continue learning and adapting to the military profession and are expected to 
understand and conform to military standards, customs, and courtesies. An Airman begins to show 
occupational proficiency at basic tasks and still requires significant supervision and support. The 
written abbreviation is “Amn,” and the official term of address is “Airman.” 
Airman First Class. Airmen First Class fully comply with USAF standards and devote time to 
increasing skills in their career fields and the military profession while becoming effective team 
members. For the Airman First Class, continued supervision is essential to ongoing occupational 
and professional growth. Typically, the 5-skill level is earned at this grade. The written 
abbreviation is “A1C,” and the official term of address is “Airman First Class” or “Airman.” 
Senior Airman. Senior Airmen commonly perform as skilled technicians and trainers. They begin 
developing supervisory and leadership skills through progressive responsibility, individual study, 
and mentoring. Senior Airmen strive to establish themselves as effective trainers through the 
maximum use of guidance and assistance from officer and enlisted leaders. Senior Airman must 
complete Airman Leadership School before assuming the grade of Staff Sergeant. The written 
abbreviation is “SrA,” and the official term of address is “Senior Airman” or “Airman.” 
 
7.6.  Noncommissioned Officer Tier 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
129 
 
 
 
The Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) tier consists of the ranks: Staff Sergeant and Technical 
Sergeant. NCOs continue occupational growth and become expert technicians while developing 
as leaders, supervisors, managers, and mentors in the profession of arms. Additionally, NCOs 
ensure they keep themselves and subordinates trained, qualified, and ready to deploy and operate 
at home station and in an expeditionary environment. In this tier, NCOs understand and internalize 
foundational competencies in preparation for increased responsibilities while pursuing 
professional development through a variety of means, including the developmental special duty 
selection process and professional military education. 
Staff Sergeant. Staff Sergeants are skilled technicians with supervisory and training 
responsibilities. Typically, the 7-skill level is earned at this rank. Staff Sergeants ensure proper use 
of resources under their control for effective, efficient accomplishment of the mission. The written 
abbreviation is “SSgt,” and the official term of address is “Staff Sergeant” or “Sergeant.” 
Technical Sergeant. Technical Sergeants are often a unit’s technical experts. They continuously 
strive to develop as technicians, supervisors, leaders, and mentors through professional 
development opportunities, including professional military education. Technical Sergeants must 
complete the NCO Academy before assuming the grade of Master Sergeant. The written 
abbreviation is “TSgt,” and the official term of address is “Technical Sergeant,” “Tech Sergeant,” 
or “Sergeant.” 
7.7.  Senior Noncommissioned Officer Tier 
The Senior Noncommissioned Officer (SNCO) tier consists of the ranks: Master Sergeant, Senior 
Master Sergeant, and Chief Master Sergeant. SNCOs serve as leaders in the profession of arms. 
They advise, supervise, mentor, and develop junior enlisted Airmen and NCOs under their charge. 
In this tier, SNCOs continue professional development and participate in decision-making 
processes on a variety of technical, operational, and organizational issues. They have a great deal 
of leadership experience to leverage resources and personnel against a variety of mission 
requirements. They continue professional development through functional opportunities, 
professional military education, and may attend sister service or international SNCO courses. 
Master Sergeant. Master Sergeants are technical experts, transitioning from first-line supervisors 
to leaders of operational competence. This rank carries increased responsibilities for leadership, 
management, and team building. Master Sergeants should consider broadening opportunities 
through the developmental special duty selection process. Master Sergeants must complete the 
SNCO Academy before assuming the grade of Senior Master Sergeant. The written abbreviation 
is “MSgt,” and the official term of address is “Master Sergeant” or “Sergeant.” 
Senior Master Sergeant. Senior Master Sergeants are experienced, operational leaders, skilled at 
merging team talents, skills, and resources with other organizations. The written abbreviation is 
“SMSgt,” and the official term of address is “Senior Master Sergeant,” “Senior,” or “Sergeant.” 
Chief Master Sergeant. Chief Master Sergeants possess substantial operational and occupational 
experience and hold strategic leadership positions with tremendous influence. They are charged 
with mentoring and developing junior enlisted personnel and influencing the professional 
development of company grade officers. All newly selected RegAF chiefs will attend the Chief 
Leadership Course. Newly selected Reserve Component chiefs will attend either the Chief 
Leadership Course or their Chief Orientation Course. The written abbreviation is “CMSgt,” and 
the official term of address is “Chief Master Sergeant” or “Chief.”

7.8.  Enlisted Duty Titles 
When properly applied, duty titles facilitate a quick understanding of a person’s role and level 
of responsibility. Enlisted duty titles are assigned based upon the scope of responsibility and the 
duties being performed. The following duty titles are the official, authorized duty titles for the 
enlisted force. 
Supervisor. The title of Supervisor is used for NCO and some Senior Airmen who are first- line 
supervisors, such as heavy equipment supervisors and shift supervisors. Junior enlisted Airmen 
will not have the duty title of supervisor unless they are at least an Airman Leadership School 
graduate and supervise the work of others. 
Noncommissioned Officer in Charge. The title of Noncommissioned Officer In Charge 
(NCOIC), is used only for NCOs and SNCOs in charge of a work center or element. NCOICs 
typically have subordinate supervisors. The title of NCOIC is also used for those whose primary 
duty is a unit-wide program or management function, even if they do not directly supervise 
personnel. 
Section Chief. The title of Section Chief is used for NCOs and SNCOs in charge of a section with 
at least two subordinate work centers or elements. Section chiefs are typically SNCOs, and the rank 
will vary depending upon the size of the section. 
Flight Chief. The title of Flight Chief is used for NCOs and SNCOs who are the enlisted 
leaders of a flight. Flight chiefs are typically SNCOs, and the rank will vary depending upon the 
size of the flight. 
Manager. The title of Manager, in addition to the special SNCO positions of USAF career field 
managers and major command functional managers, is used for NCOs and SNCOs who are 
program, project, and policy managers at designated USAF levels. They may or may not have 
personnel working for them and may be the enlisted leader of the branch, division, or directorate. 
Chief. The title of Chief is used for Chief Master Sergeants who are program, project, or policy 
managers at designated USAF levels. They may or may not have personnel working for them and 
may be the enlisted leader of the branch, division, or directorate. 
7.9.  Selective Senior Enlisted Positions 
Airmen may serve in leadership or duty positions within or outside their functional specialty. For 
additional special duty positions, refer to the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory. 
Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force. The CMSAF is the senior enlisted leader of the USAF 
and takes precedence over all USAF enlisted members. The CMSAF provides leadership to the 
enlisted force and advises the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Secretary of the Air Force, Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense on enlisted matters for Airmen and their 
families. The CMSAF communicates with the force, serves on boards and committees for 
organizations affecting Airmen, testifies before Congress, and is the USAF career field manager 
for command chief master sergeants and group superintendents. The CMSAF consults with sister 
service senior enlisted advisors on issues affecting all enlisted members; engages with foreign 
military leaders regarding theater security cooperation and partner nation development efforts; 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
131 
 
 
 
represents the USAF to the American public, professional organizations, and media; and manages 
the Air Force Order of the Sword Program. The written abbreviation is “CMSAF,” and the official 
term of address is “Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force” or “Chief.” Note: Establishing a 
CMSAF position was initially proposed by the Air Force Association’s Airman Advisory Council 
in 1964. In 1966, Congressman Mendel Rivers introduced a bill that would mandate each of the 
services to appoint one senior enlisted member. The senior enlisted member for the USAF would 
serve as the senior enlisted advisor to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The Marine Corps had 
already created the position of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps in 1957, and the Army had 
already created the position of Sergeant Major of the Army in 1965. Although the Rivers bill never 
passed, the USAF recognized the tremendous support behind the proposal. In October 1966, Chief 
of Staff of the Air Force General John P. McConnell announced the newly created position of 
CMSAF. In April 1967, Chief Paul W. Airey became the first to wear the unique CMSAF insignia 
with the wreath around the star. See Attachment 5, Chief Master Sergeants of the Air Force, for 
a photo and brief biography of all CMSAFs. 
Command Chief Master Sergeant. The title of Command Chief Master Sergeant (CCM) applies 
to the senior enlisted leader in a designated USAF level – traditionally at wings, centers, numbered 
air forces (NAF), and major commands (MAJCOM). The command chief master sergeant provides 
general supervision to the command’s enlisted force and is responsible for advising commanders 
and staff on mission effectiveness, professional development, recognition, key enlisted Airmen 
nominations and hires, accelerated promotions, performance evaluations, military readiness, 
training, utilization, health, morale, and welfare of the organization’s enlisted, and takes action to 
address shortfalls or challenges. They also regularly visit Airmen, to include traveling to 
geographically separated units/elements; interact with sister service counterparts; serve as a liaison 
to and work closely with the local community and ensure the enlisted force is ready to meet mission 
requirements (both in-place and deployed). RegAF command chief master sergeants serve on the 
enlisted force distribution panel by advising their senior rater and panel membership on enlisted 
Airmen’s potential to serve in the next higher grade. They assist and advise in the selection and 
nomination of enlisted Airmen for positions of greater responsibility, to include developmental 
special duties. The command chief master sergeant is the functional manager for subordinate unit’s 
senior enlisted leaders and first sergeants in their organization, and performs other duties as 
required/directed by their commander. Note: The titles of Senior Enlisted Advisor (SEA), Senior 
Enlisted Leader (SEL), and Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) are only used when holding a 
designated and approved position. The equivalent to a command chief master sergeant in a 
COCOM or joint task force (JTF) is a CCMD or joint task force senior enlisted leader. Approved 
use of the titles of SEA and SEL are often used in joint and coalition organizational structures and 
are not always synonymous with the role of a command chief master sergeant. 
Senior Enlisted Leader. This position serves as a key advisor in every command team and unit. 
The title of SEL is used for SNCOs in charge of squadron, group, and headquarters levels. These 
enlisted leaders provide mentorship, guidance, experience, and expertise in organizing, equipping, 
training, and mobilizing the organization’s enlisted force to meet home station and expeditionary 
mission requirements. RegAF SELs may support and advise commanders, directors, and fellow 
enlisted leaders prior to the enlisted force distribution panel on promotion eligible Airmen’s 
performance and potential to serve in the next higher grade. They also assist and advise in the 
selection and nomination of enlisted Airmen for positions of greater responsibility, to include 
developmental special duties. Total Force SELs manage and direct resource activities, interpret 
and enforce policies and applicable directives, establish control procedures to meet mission goals 
and standards, and actively support and maintain robust recognition programs. They work in 
concert with other enlisted leaders, to oversee the readiness, training, health, morale, welfare, and 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
132 
 
 
 
quality of life of assigned personnel. They represent the commander on all matters to support 
mission and personnel readiness, to include maintaining the pulse of the enlisted force, 
participating on advisory councils and boards, interacting with sister-service counterparts, and 
performing other duties as required/directed by the commander. 
First Sergeant. The First sergeant is a key leader serving in a time-honored career-broadening 
position rich in custom and tradition. They epitomize the highest qualities of Air Force Senior 
Noncommissioned Officers. These qualities require the First Sergeant to always to remain 
perceptive and credible and to exemplify the core values of the United States Air Force. 
Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM). The title of Enlisted AFCFM typically applies to 
Chief Master Sergeants, normally located at HAF, responsible for organizing and managing one 
or more enlisted career fields. Their responsibilities include establishing career field entry 
requirements, managing trained personnel requirements, and developing and managing career- 
long training plan requirements and programs. They also construct viable career paths, evaluate 
training effectiveness, monitor health and manning of the career field, and provide input on 
manning, personnel policies, and programs. AFCFMs also regularly visit Airmen, to include 
traveling to geographically separated units/elements. Additionally, through the use of enlisted 
development teams, they execute progression and succession planning to ensure there are 
sufficient personnel and skillsets available to accomplish the mission. As functional experts, they 
ensure their career fields are responsive to both current and future needs of the USAF. They rely 
heavily on collaboration and communicate directly with other HAF offices on issues impacting 
their career field and with their respective major command and field operating agency enlisted 
career field representatives and training managers to disseminate USAF and career field policies 
and program requirements. 
Major Command Functional Manager (MFM). The title of Enlisted MFM applies to SNCOs 
who manage designated enlisted career fields and serve as the major command liaisons for their 
respective AFCFMs. They regularly visit organizations in the major command they oversee, 
monitor the health and manning of their career fields within their command, and elevate concerns 
to the AFCFMs. They manage command training for their career field and coordinate command 
training and personnel issues across their major command staff and with AFCFMs. They 
disseminate USAF and career field policies and program requirements affecting their career field 
throughout the major command. They coordinate with the Air Force Personnel Center (RegAF 
only), through their major command, to ensure proper command prioritization of allocated and 
assigned personnel resources. They provide functional and subject matter expertise to training 
managers to develop new or modify/improve existing training programs.

7.10. Enlisted Force Development Construct 
Enlisted force development combines training, education, and experience in a life-cycle approach 
to developing innovative Airmen prepared to accomplish the USAF mission and lead in a rapidly 
evolving global environment. Deliberate development is essential throughout an Airman’s career 
and is satisfied through education on foundational competencies, training on occupational 
competencies, seeking a varied array of experiential opportunities, and utilizing additional force 
developmental tools for continued growth to meet both personal and professional needs. As 
developing Airmen, it is essential to take full advantage of the abundant opportunities and 
resources that exist both in a specialty and across the USAF. What is imperative from an enterprise 
perspective, is looking at how Airmen progress through their careers to successfully assume the 
responsibilities required in operational and strategic leadership positions. 
Enlisted Development Teams. Enlisted development teams are designed to leverage the 
development of qualified Airmen with the leadership capacity and acculturation necessary to 
support current and projected mission requirements. Career field managers use enlisted 
development teams to perform progression and succession planning to place Airmen in key 
leadership and developmental positions based on defined education, training, experience, and 
performance requirements. Placing the right people in the right place at the right time is imperative. 
Enlisted Force Development Panel. The Enlisted Force Development Panel is responsible for 
guiding enlisted force development initiatives. The panel is charged with reviewing, evaluating, 
and making recommendations to senior USAF leaders regarding education, training, and 
experiences impacting enlisted development. Panel members include command chief master 
sergeants, career field managers, as well as representatives from Air Education and Training 
Command, Air Force Personnel Center, and HAF. 
Air Force Senior Enlisted Leadership Council. The Air Force Senior Enlisted Leadership 
Council is responsible for addressing deliberate development initiatives for Airmen with regard to 
opportunities for enhanced performance. The council is comprised of chief master sergeants 
serving in strategic/joint/combined commands, major command command chiefs, other senior 
enlisted leader, and selected advisors. Efforts of the council aim to elevate the caliber and 
performance of enlisted Airmen, develop solutions to the highest priority issues and opportunities 
for Airmen and families, counsel and advise the Secretary of the Air Force, the Chief of Staff of 
the Air Force, and senior USAF commanders and leaders. 
Air Force Enlisted Council. The Air Force Enlisted Council is comprised of the current 12 
Outstanding Airmen of the Year. With mentorship and oversight of the Air Force Senior Enlisted 
Leadership Council, the Air Force Enlisted Council serves as enlisted ambassadors for USAF 
enlisted recruiting and retention efforts. The council also actively engages with the Air Force 
Association, enlisted professional military education, and various enlisted USAF organizations. 
MyVECTOR. MyVECTOR is a Total Force, experience tracking, enterprise solution, that 
supports USAF development priorities. MyVECTOR is a web-based career planning and force 
development tool that allows individuals greater transparency into their development and career 
management. In addition to being the enterprise information technology tool used to support career 
field managers and development teams, MyVECTOR also offers robust mentoring capabilities. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
134 
 
 
 
The modern online platform offers configuration, supporting not only the traditional by-name 
method of requesting a mentor, but also providing a mentor-matching capability based on weighted 
characteristics identified by Airmen searching for a mentor. MyVECTOR offers a real-time 
mentoring plan, discussion forums, a bullet tracker to document accomplishments, and the ability 
to dialogue on-line with a mentor. 
MyVECTOR also includes a Developmental Special Experience (DSE) Catalog in the 
Development Plan section. DSEs provide hands-on experiences that are typically outside of AFSC 
or career series formal training, and help individuals gain or enhance competencies. Unlike 
assignment systems, the Catalog lists all DSEs, regardless of vacancies or application windows, to 
make users aware of all requirements or prerequisites. 
MyVECTOR additionally offers a developmental self-assessment that helps members identify 
their personal strengths and areas for improvement among the USAF Foundational Competencies. 
The self-assessment provides immediate feedback on recommended online resources (e.g., videos, 
articles, courses) based on a member’s identified areas for improvement. To further self- 
awareness, members also have the option to use the assessment tool to request confidential 
feedback from their supervisors and/or subordinates, peers, or higher-ranking members (360-
degree feedback). Airmen can access the full searchable library of online resources (e.g., videos, 
articles, courses) associated with each foundational competency (e.g., Teamwork, 
Communication, Resilience) at any time to further personal and professional development. 
Talent Management. Our USAF culture should attract the right Airmen, professionals ready to 
represent the world’s greatest USAF. Talent management begins with recruiting and is continued 
through training and education, where it is cultivated. The USAF’s ability to continue to respond 
faster than our adversaries rely on the flexibility and adaptability of our Airmen. Not only do we 
want to be innovators, but our nation also depends on it. The way we manage talent directly impacts 
the way we fight and win wars. The system that is designed to manage people must be as agile as 
we expect our Airmen to be. 
Competitive Edge. The USAF as an institution recognizes the importance of an innovative and 
agile work environment for maintaining a competitive edge and being considered an employer of 
choice for our nation’s best and brightest talent. Training and education are steadily becoming more 
aligned with capitalizing on talents of those within the USAF. USAF programs are designed to 
develop, manage, and execute realistic and flexible training and education to produce a highly 
skilled, motivated force that is capable of carrying out all tasks and functions in support of the 
USAF mission. Innovative Airmen power the force. To keep pace, we must continuously 
modernize our education and training to be relevant and responsive. The unpredictable landscape 
we operate in requires the USAF to continue to revisit, improve, and evolve our personnel 
management processes to ensure we retain our talented Airmen. While some initiatives are force- 
wide and others are more targeted, they all have the same objective - to increase our competitive 
position for top talent. 
7.11. Occupational Analysis Program 
Air Education and Training Command, Studies and Analysis Squadron, houses the USAF 
Occupational Analysis Program, governed by DAFMAN 36-2664, Personnel Assessment 
Program. The purpose of the program is to equip senior leaders and managers of USAF personnel 
and education and training programs with objective, fact-based information about USAF 
occupations and civilian occupational series. The role of occupational analysis is to conduct 
occupational studies, develop survey instruments, analyze data collected, and provide actionable 
USAF specialty information. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
135 
 
 
 
As noted in AFPD 36-26, the Occupational Analysis Program is the singularly unique USAF entity 
which collects, analyzes, and reports the job/occupational performance factors which are defined, 
measured, and applied within instructional system development. Consequently, the Occupational 
Analysis Program is integral to providing an objective and factual orientation for three force 
development tenets inherent in force development: training, utilization, and promotions. 
Training. Capabilities-based training is used to identify knowledge needed and specific tasks 
necessitating training to meet job performance requirements. 
Utilization. Personnel classification and utilization is used to identify tasks performed at each 
career stage and to validate occupational structures. 
Promotions. Promotion testing is used to identify operationally relevant content for test 
development and promoting and retaining the best Airmen. 
Occupational Analysis Process. Occupational Analysis conducts occupational studies on enlisted 
USAF specialties on a periodic basis, typically a three- to four-year cycle, and upon request if out 
of cycle. Special studies, such as officer USAF specialties and civilian occupational series, are also 
conducted upon request. Career field leaders and subject matter experts are key to the process in 
developing the content of occupational survey instruments. Occupational surveys are administered 
to all eligible personnel in the targeted specialty or civilian occupational series through direct e- 
mail (AFNet). 
Occupational Analysis Data. Occupational survey results are provided in occupational analysis 
reports that include information on the duties and responsibilities performed by career field 
members in the form of task statements and duty areas throughout each stage of their career. 
Decision-makers associated with training programs use the data obtained to establish, validate, 
adjust, or maintain training relative to USAF specialties and skill-levels, and to support decisions 
on what type of training is needed, who needs the training, and to what depth the training should be 
taught. 
All career field members have pivotal roles with the constructive outcomes of occupational studies. 
Airmen of a career field being surveyed must devote the necessary time and commitment in 
completing their assigned occupational surveys. The data collected from each survey participant 
translates into operationally relevant training programs for their USAF specialty, and fair and 
reliable promotion tests for their career field under Weighted Airman Promotion System. 
Occupational analysis serves as an external evaluation mechanism for USAF education and 
training programs. Occupational analysis data is used during specialty training requirements, team 
sessions, and utilization and training workshops to evaluate training requirements for relevancy 
and efficacy, and to determine if modifications are warranted to their Career Field Education and 
Training Plans; Career Development Course content; and the USAF specialty descriptions of 
duties, responsibilities, and qualifications. To view career field information and gain valuable 
insights into the duties and responsibilities of career fields across the USAF, visit the Occupational 
Analysis (https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/aetc-hq/A9/SAS/OA/) website. Additional 
information 
provided on the website includes job satisfaction information, work-life balance data, and the 
rationale behind why Airmen are reenlisting or separating from the USAF.

7.12. Training Opportunities 
Training is something every Airman needs throughout their career, from basic military training 
to technical training, to advanced skill level training, and beyond. This need costs the USAF 
millions of dollars annually, and for good reason. To accomplish the mission, whether that means 
sending satellites into orbit, planes in the air, reports to higher headquarters, or vehicles on the 
road, training is a must.  
7.13. Basic Military Training 
All enlisted Airmen are trained in the fundamental skills necessary to be successful in the USAF. 
These skills include basic combat skills, field training exercises, weapons training, military 
discipline, physical fitness, drill and ceremonies, dormitory inspections, history and heritage, core 
values, and a comprehensive range of subjects relating to USAF life, such as financial 
management, family issues, and alcohol/substance abuse. More than seven million young men and 
women have entered USAF basic military training. Basic military training begins with the 
receiving phase (zero week) and ends with graduation. Military training instructors are responsible 
for most of the training that takes place, and they accompany trainees throughout the training 
process. Following graduation, all Airmen proceed to the appropriate technical training school or 
their first duty assignment. Technical training typically lasts anywhere from one month to two 
years, depending on the Airman’s assigned Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). 
7.14. On-the-Job Training 
The USAF on-the-job training (OJT) provides personnel the opportunity to attain knowledge and 
skill qualifications required to perform duties in their specialty. Effective training, knowledge, 
proficiency, and experience are integral parts of a unit’s mission that will ultimately lead to a 
successful career and contribute to a solid national defense. An effective OJT program requires 
commander and supervisory involvement at all levels. While the supervisor’s primary 
responsibility is to plan OJT that outlines specific short-term, mission-related goals for the trainee, 
overall success depends on the supervisor’s ability to advise and actively assist Airmen in reaching 
their long-range career objectives. The USAF OJT program consists of three components: job 
knowledge, job proficiency, and job experience. 
Job Knowledge. Job knowledge is satisfied through a planned program of study involving Career 
Development Courses (CDC) or technical references listed in the Career Field Education and 
Training Plan (CFETP) or identified by the supervisor. 
Job Proficiency. Job proficiency is hands-on training provided on the job, allowing the trainee to 
gain proficiency in tasks performed in the work center. 
Job Experience. Job experience is gained during and after upgrade training to build confidence 
and competence. 
7.15. Upgrade Training 
Upgrade training leads to award of higher skill levels and is designed to increase skills and abilities. 
AFSC upgrade training requirements for award of 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels are outlined AFMAN 
36-2100, Military Utilization and Classification, DAFMAN 36-2689, Training Program, and the 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
137 
 
 
 
applicable CFETP. 
Apprentice. Airmen must complete an initial skills course for award of the 3-skill level. Retraining 
into an AFSC may be accomplished via OJT training alone, only when specified in the retraining 
instructions and as approved by the career field manager or the career field functional manager 
(Air Reserve Component). Personnel retraining via OJT may be awarded a 3-skill level when they 
complete knowledge training on all tasks taught in the initial skills course and other tasks and 
mandatory requirements. 
Journeyman. Airmen must complete mandatory CDCs, if available, and applicable mandatory 
core tasks identified in the CFETP. Award of the 5-skill level also requires completion of all 
mandatory requirements listed in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). 
Additionally, the member must be recommended by the supervisor and approved by the 
commander. Individuals in retraining status (Training Status Code F) are subject to the same 
training requirements. 
Craftsman. To be a craftsman, the member must be at least a Staff Sergeant Select; complete 
mandatory CDCs, if available, and complete applicable mandatory core tasks identified in the 
CFETP. Award of the 7-skill level also requires completion of a 7-skill level craftsman course (if 
career field requires it) and mandatory requirements listed in the AFECD. Additionally, the 
member must be recommended by the supervisor and approved by the commander. Individuals in 
retraining status (Training Status Code G) are subject to the same training requirements. 
Superintendent. For award of the 9-skill level, the member must be at least a Senior Master 
Sergeant, meet mandatory requirements listed in the AFECD, be recommended by the supervisor, 
and be approved by the commander. 
7.16. Unit Training Management 
The unit training program is designed to ensure all Airmen receive quality, standardized, 
comprehensive training. The trainee is the focal point of the training program, while at the 
forefront, unit training managers and supervisors work together to plan, conduct, and evaluate the 
trainees’ efforts to become qualified to perform in their USAF specialty. The success and quality 
of training greatly depends on the trainee’s active participation and understanding of the training 
program, as well as the relationship between the supervisor, trainer, and trainee. Basic 
requirements of the unit training program state that newly assigned personnel will be interviewed 
within 30 days (60 days for Air Reserve Component) to determine training status and issue CDCs 
upon confirmation within the Course Development Student Administration Record System. 
Work center training orientation will be conducted within 60 days of assignment (120 days for Air 
Reserve Component); a comprehensive trainee orientation will be conducted for trainees initially 
entering upgrade training within 60 days of assignment (90 days for Air Reserve Component); and 
a training progress review will be conducted with the unit training manager, supervisor, and trainee 
at the 24th month of upgrade training (36th month for ANG) and at least every 90 days thereafter 
until the trainee is upgraded or withdrawn from training. Before being submitted for upgrade, the 
trainee must meet all mandatory requirements as defined in the CFETP, AFECD, and the Air Force 
Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS). 
Unit Training Managers. Unit training managers are the commander’s key staff members 
responsible for overall management of the training program. Training managers serve as training 
consultants to all unit members and determine if quality training programs are in effect within all 
sections. Training managers develop, manage, and conduct training in support of in-garrison and 
expeditionary mission requirements; advise and assist commanders and unit personnel in executing 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
138 
 
 
 
their training responsibilities; and conduct a staff assistance visit of the unit’s training program to 
include geographically separated units, every two years (ARC three years), or sooner if requested 
by the unit commander. 
Supervisors. In addition to unit training managers, supervisors have the single greatest impact on 
mission accomplishment with regard to training. They must share their experiences and expertise 
with trainees to meet mission requirements and ensure a quality training program is provided. 
Supervisors develop one work center master task list (MTL) that ensures completion of all duty 
position requirements (i.e., 100 percent task coverage) and conduct a review annually. The 
supervisor must also integrate training with day-to-day work center operations and consider trainer 
and equipment availability, training opportunities, and schedules. 
Trainers. The trainer (often the trainee’s supervisor) is selected based on their experience and 
their ability to provide instruction to the trainee. Additionally, they must maintain task 
qualification and complete the USAF training course. Trainer responsibilities include planning, 
conducting, and documenting training; preparing and using teaching outlines or task breakdowns; 
developing evaluation tools; and briefing the trainee and supervisor on the training evaluation 
results. 
Task Certifiers. Task certifiers provide third-party certification and evaluation of progress in the 
training program. Certifiers must be at least a Staff Sergeant with a 5-skill level or civilian 
equivalent, complete the USAF training course, and be capable of evaluating the task being 
certified. Certifiers will develop evaluation tools or use established training evaluation methods to 
determine the trainee’s abilities and training program effectiveness, and will brief the trainee, 
supervisor, and trainer on evaluation results. 
7.17. Training Forms and Documentation 
Training documentation is important to personnel at all levels because it validates the status of 
training and task qualification. Documentation also helps managers assess mission capability and 
readiness, and it defines requirements for individual career progression. 
Department of the Air Force Form 623, Individual Training Record. The DAF Form 623, 
Individual Training Record Folder, six-part folder (when required by the career field manager), 
or approved electronic equivalent, is generated for all trainees entering upgrade training for the 
first time. The training record reflects past and current qualifications and is used to determine 
training requirements. Supervisors maintain the training record, and ensure it is available to 
applicable personnel in the chain of command, including the unit training manager, upon request. 
Unless classified, the training record is returned to the member upon separation, retirement, 
commissioning, promotion to Master Sergeant, or as otherwise directed by the career field 
manager. 
Department of the Air Force Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet. 
Use DAF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, or automated 
version, to document an individual’s training progress. The form reflects status, counseling, 
and breaks in training. 
Career Field Education and Training Plan. The CFETP is a comprehensive core document 
identifying life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, core and 
home station training, and deployment/unit type code task requirements for USAF specialties. 
Supervisors use the CFETP to plan, prioritize, manage, and execute training within the career field 
and to identify and certify all past and current qualifications. CFETP Part I provides information 
necessary for overall management of the specialty and is maintained as part of the work center 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
139 
 
 
 
master training plan. CFETP Part II contains the specialty training standard identifying the duties, 
tasks, and technical references to support training, core and home station training tasks, 
deployment/unit type code tasks, and CDC requirements. At least one copy of the entire CFETP 
(Part I and II), should be kept in the work center for general access. Electronic copy is authorized 
if CFETP is in automated system. 
AFCFMs are responsible to ensure their respective CFETP embodies Airmanship and 
incorporates the following competencies that align with the Air Force foundational competencies: 
communication, accountability, teamwork, analytical thinking, and resource management. 
Air Force Job Qualification Standard. The AFJQS is a training document approved by the career 
field manager for a particular job type or duty position within a USAF specialty. 
Department of the Air Force Form 803, Report of Task Evaluations. Evaluators use the DAF 
Form 803, Report of Task Evaluations, to conduct and document completion of task evaluations 
during training staff assistance visits, when directed by the commander, or when task certification 
requires validation. Completed evaluations conducted on a single trainee by the supervisor/trainer 
or task certifier are filed in DAF Form 623, Individual Training Record, until upgraded or no 
longer applicable. Unit training managers maintain task evaluations performed during SAVs with 
the completed report. 
Department of the Air Force Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command 
JQS. DAF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS, is a continuation 
of the CFETP Part II, or AFJQS. This form defines locally assigned duty position, home station 
training, and deployment/unit type code requirements not included in the CFETP, Part II. 
Department of the Air Force Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training. 
Supervisors use the DAF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, to 
document selected tasks requiring recurring training or evaluation. USAF and major command 
directives may identify tasks contained in the CFETP that require special certification, as well as 
recurring training or evaluations. 
7.18. Retraining Program 
The retraining program is designed to balance the number of personnel in specific grades and year 
groups of a USAF specialty. Once retraining is approved and the Airman has been assigned duty 
in the new specialty, upgrade training begins. With minor exceptions, training requirements are 
identical for retrainees and standard upgrade trainees. Refer to AFMAN 36-2100, Military 
Utilization and Classification, for additional details. 
7.19. Language Enabled Airman Program 
The Language Enabled Airman Program (LEAP) (https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/AFCLC/), 
designed and managed by the USAF Culture and Language Center at Air University, Maxwell 
Air Force Base, Alabama, provides opportunities for officers and enlisted Airmen in the general 
purpose force (GPF) who have outstanding service records and possess some level of skill in a 
foreign language, as measured by the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) or Oral 
Proficiency Interview (OPI). LEAP is a highly competitive, board-selected program that enables 
the USAF to sustain, deliberately develop, and posture Airmen for utilization in language 
designated positions, deployments, and other CCMD requirements. Selected members develop 
and professionalize their skills through an online synchronous platform called “eMentor” and 
through periodic overseas language immersions.

7.20. Education Opportunities 
Educational opportunities exist throughout an Airman’s career which contribute to individual 
overall development. Professional Military Education (PME) enhances performance in each phase 
of professional development and builds upon the foundation of leadership abilities developed 
during the earlier stages of an individual’s career. PME complements training, experience, and 
other educational programs to provide enlisted leaders a continuum of learning via progressive 
courses concentrated on developing leadership, Airmanship, and military professionalism. PME 
courses provide professional education to enlisted Airmen to ensure development of USAF 
institutional competencies and subcompetencies vital to the knowledge and skills required for 
critical thinking, sound decision-making, and a strategic mindset. For additional information about 
USAF PME programs and policies, refer to DAFI 36-2670. 
7.21. Enlisted Professional Military Education 
In 1955, enlisted PME schools were established across the USAF to provide non-commissioned 
officers leadership and management training required to assume day-to-day mission execution 
responsibilities. The stand-up of these schools coincided with the release of the first official 
enlisted force structure which established the leadership roles and responsibilities of enlisted 
Airmen at each grade. Operational control of stateside enlisted PME schools lies with Air 
Education and Training Command at the Thomas N. Barnes Center for Enlisted Education, located 
at Maxwell Air Force Base-Gunter Annex, Alabama. 
The Barnes Center, Academic Affairs is responsible for developing and providing enlisted PME 
program development, faculty development, and operational program management. Barnes Center 
programs consist of academic courses that use performance evaluations and objective 
examinations to determine how well students achieve instructional objectives. Courses are 
designed with principle instructional methods, experiential activities, problem-centered leadership 
laboratories, personal reflection, guided discussion, case study analysis, and writing assignments. 
Note: With the exception of the Chief Leadership Course, Airmen are awarded collegiate 
academic credit for completing enlisted PME courses through the Community College of the Air 
Force, which is accredited through Air University by the Southern Association of Colleges and 
Schools Commission on Colleges. 
Airman Leadership School Distance Learning. The Airman Leadership School Distance 
Learning (ALS-DL) Course provides PME to prepare Senior Airmen to supervise and foster a 
commitment to the military profession. The ALS-DL curriculum is designed to develop a mindset 
and associated skills with respect to four core attributes: (1) professional Airmen, (2) expeditionary 
Airmen, (3) supervisor of Airmen, and (4) supervisory communicator. The ALS-DL course is open 
to Air National Guard and USAF Reserve Senior Airmen and Staff Sergeants. The course is not 
available for RegAF personnel. Students must pass two course exams by attaining the minimum 
passing score on each exam. 
Airman Leadership School Blended Learning. In October 2016, the Airman Leadership School 
launched the Blended Learning Course (ALS-BLC), which combines distance learning principles 
with traditional classroom learning. ALS-BLC is divided into two phases. Phase I is eight weeks 
long and delivered by utilizing an online learning management system. Students complete core 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
141 
 
 
 
academic work in an asynchronous environment. Phase II is two weeks long and conducted at the 
Paul H. Lankford PME Center located on McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base, Tennessee. 
The ALS-BLC curriculum is designed to develop a mindset and associated skills with respect to 
four core attributes: (1) professional Airmen, (2) expeditionary Airmen, (3) supervisor of Airmen, 
and (4) supervisory communicator. 
Airman Leadership School. Airman Leadership School (ALS) is the first level of enlisted PME 
that Airmen complete as they progress through their USAF careers. ALS is offered at almost every 
installation across the USAF and is designed to prepare Senior Airmen to be professional 
warfighting Airmen, able to supervise and lead USAF teams to support the employment of air 
and cyberspace power. The first level of ALS is the distance learning course (ALS-DL). ALS-DL 
includes: (1) professional Airmen, (2) expeditionary Airmen, (3) supervisor of Airmen, and (4) 
supervisory communicator. The ALS curriculum includes: (1) mission, (2) leadership, (3) problem 
solving, and (4) USAF culture. 
Noncommissioned Officer Distance Learning. The Noncommissioned Officer Distance 
Learning (NCO-DL) course is open to Air Reserve Component Airmen. The NCO-DL Course 
provides PME for basic NCO institutional competency development required to prepare enlisted 
leaders to be professional, warfighting Airmen and Guardians who can lead and manage USAF 
units in the employment of air and space power. The NCO-DL course consists of three course 
modules: (1) course foundation, (2) leadership and management, and (3) operational Airman. The 
NCO-DL course is open to Air Reserve Component Airmen. To successfully complete this course, 
students are required to pass three course exams, demonstrating curriculum mastery by attaining 
the minimum passing score on each exam. Furthermore, EPME Distance Learning Courses (DLC) 
completion is no longer a prerequisite for resident attendance effective 26 April 2018. 
Additionally, Air University will no longer allow new enrollments for active component Airmen. 
Airmen may access EPME DLC for reference purposes only through the Air University Student 
Information System (AUSIS). 
Noncommissioned Officer Academy. The NCO Academy (NCOA) mission is to prepare enlisted 
leaders for current and future leadership and management opportunities to operate (think and act) 
critically in complex and ambiguous environments. The NCOA program encompasses the 
intermediate leadership experience, which includes guided discussions, experiential exercises, 
case study analysis, and immersive leadership development laboratories designed to improve an 
NCO’s competence, confidence, and will to exercise assigned leadership responsibilities. 
Senior Noncommissioned Officer Distance Learning. This course is open to Air Reserve 
Component Airmen. The Senior Noncommissioned Officer Distance Learning (SNCO-DL) 
Course provides institutional competency development required to prepare SNCOs to lead the 
enlisted force at the tactical and operational levels. The curriculum’s design heightens students’ 
appreciation and understanding of three attributes: (1) self-awareness, (2) leadership and 
management, and (3) joint warfighter. This course is open to Air Reserve Component Airmen. To 
successfully complete the course, students are required to demonstrate curriculum mastery by 
attaining the minimum passing score on each of three module exams. 
Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy. The SNCO Academy (SNCOA) trains up to 2,250 
USAF, Navy, Coast Guard, Marine, and international SNCOs, annually. The SNCOA mission is 
to develop joint and coalition senior enlisted leaders to influence mission success in dynamic 
service environments. The SNCOA program encompasses the advanced leadership experience, 
representing comprehensive institutional competency development. The SNCOA is designed to 
sharpen senior enlisted leader skills with education that helps prepare them for continued and 
increased relevant responsibilities in joint, combined, interagency, and strategic environments.

Chief Leadership Course. The Chief Leadership Course (CLC) is the capstone and pinnacle level 
of enlisted PME. Currently, the CLC provides newly selected Chief Master Sergeants with 
foundational, strategic-level leadership competencies. The CLC conducts seven classes per year, 
educating 750 Total Force Chief Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeant-selects annually. 
The CLC mission is to provide chiefs the education to bridge operational-to-strategic perspectives 
of the Air Force. The CLC vision is to develop chiefs into strategic level leaders and to inspire 
them to effectively lead, manage, and mentor today's Airmen. The CLC demands extensive self- 
study, critical creative thinking, communication, and interpersonal skills. 
7.22. Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education 
In addition to enlisted PME courses, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 
1805.01B, Enlisted Professional Military Education Policy, requires all enlisted personnel 
operating in joint, interagency, multinational, and coalition warfighting organizations to learn joint 
concepts. Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education (EJPME) provides SNCOs a 
comprehensive joint education to prepare them for assignments to joint billets at the senior 
enlisted leader or command senior enlisted leader level. EJPME is web-based and is designed to 
expose enlisted personnel to joint education, prepare them to succeed by improving their ability 
to operate effectively and supervise multiple service members. EJPME courses are offered online 
and are accessible from anywhere at any time. 
EJPME consists of two courses of instruction referred to as EJPME I and II. EJPME I emphasizes 
curriculum commensurate with E-5/E-7 joint assignment responsibilities. EJPME II is focused on 
preparing E-7/E-9 enlisted members for their senior leadership roles in joint assignments. EJPME 
I and II have learning areas and objectives in: (1) national strategic overview; (2) joint interagency, 
intergovernmental, and multinational capabilities; (3) foundations of joint operations; and (4) Joint 
Force leadership. Note: Students must complete rank-required service enlisted PME before 
enrolling in EJPME. 
7.23. International Professional Military Education 
Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Security cooperation, under the Department of Defense 
guidance, leads national security objective efforts to train, educate, advise, and equip foreign 
partners. Department of Defense policy states that security cooperation, as an important tool of 
national security and foreign policy, shall be planned, programmed, budgeted, and executed with 
the same high degree of attention and efficiency as other integral Department of Defense activities. 
Inter-American Air Forces Academy. In addition to enlisted and joint PME, Air Education and 
Training Command hosts the Inter-American Air Forces Academy (IAAFA), an organization 
designed to focus on education, training, and security cooperation. IAAFA was initially established 
as a training program on 15 March 1943, at the request of Peru's Minister of Aeronautics, General 
Fernando Melgar. The Academy trained 11 Peruvian students in support of Allied unity in the 
western hemisphere at Albrook Air Force Station, Panama Canal Zone, marking the first United 
States aeronautics training in Latin America. Today, as an element of the U.S. Security Assistance 
Program, and more specifically the International Military Education and Training Program, 
IAAFA has provided significant contributions to promote regional stability, encourage the growth 
of democracy, prevent low intensity conflicts, and counter foreign intervention in Central America. 
Since its inception, IAAFA has served as a military training center for Latin American Air Forces 
by training military forces, national police services, and civilian personnel from over 25 nations in 
areas ranging from PME for officers and enlisted personnel, security forces training, principles of 
logistics, aircraft maintenance, and pilot aviation training. IAAFA has served a variety of national 
interests in the Latin America region, ranging from support of United States-Allied efforts in 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
143 
 
 
 
World War II, to Counterinsurgency/Civic Action actions during the Alliance for Progress era, to 
current national and security policies in support of democracy, individual freedoms, and human 
rights. 
IAAFA’s mission is to provide military education and training to military personnel of the 
Americas and other eligible partner nations and its vision is to strengthen partnerships that advance 
shared interests and enable partner nations to act in support of aligned strategic objectives. The 
Academy integrates USAF and guest instructors from different partner nations as critical enablers 
to provide the highest quality of in-residence training, mobile training, and a virtual learning 
environment to support of our Latin American partners from Central, South America, and 
Caribbean nations. Currently located at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, IAAFA 
graduates an average of 900 students annually, it has graduated over 35,000 students in its 75-year 
history, and it allocates the only PME center in the USAF with the capability of offering the three 
enlisted tiers of professional military education (Airman Leadership School, Noncommissioned 
Officer Academy and Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy). 
Inter-European Air Forces Academy. The Inter-European Air Forces Academy (IEAFA) was 
passed into U.S. law in the Public Law 106-291, Section 1268, Carl Levin and Howard P. “Buck” 
McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, 19 December 2014. In 2017, 
IEAFA was codified as a permanent authority to train and educate partner nations. The purpose 
of IEAFA is to provide military education and training to military personnel of countries that are 
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or signatories to the Partnership for 
Peace (PfP) Framework Documents. IEAFA's mission is to enable combined, joint air operations 
by strengthening NATO and PfP air force capabilities and interoperability through targeted 
military education and training. 
The Academy was officially activated on 23 March 2016, and is subordinate to Headquarters, 
United States Air Forces in Europe & Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA), and the Warrior 
Preparation Center located at Einsiedlerhof Air Station, Germany. Since its establishment, IEAFA 
has educated and trained more than 500 students from 32 countries. With PME as the Academy's 
primary focus, IEAFA's unique approach develops officers and NCOs in a combined learning 
environment, integrating the learning experience between the ranks, thus showcasing the benefit 
of a professional working relationship and how it drives mission success. Additionally, IEAFA is 
expanding its technical training course offerings to boost partnership capacity in the European 
theater for specific disciplines, which in-turn strengthens NATO and enables successful combined 
air operations.

7.24. Community College of the Air Force Program 
The USAF has always recognized the positive effects of education on USAF personnel and 
continually established various programs to meet the needs of the USAF, its enlisted Airmen, and 
society as a whole. One of the most notable programs is the Community College of the Air Force 
(CCAF), https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Barnes/CCAF/. 
Legacy. The CCAF was activated in 1972 to gain academic recognition for formal technical 
training conducted by USAF schools. By the mid-1970s, many civilian consultants reported that 
CCAF standards exceeded the minimum requirements of civilian community college associate 
degree programs and the USAF sought degree-granting authority from Congress. President Gerald 
R. Ford signed Public Law 94-361, 94th Congress, An Act, on 14 July 1976 authorizing the 
Commander of Air Training Command (currently Air Education and Training Command) to 
confer the associate of applied science degree. The Commander of Air Education and Training 
Command remained CCAF’s degree-granting authority until 28 October 2004. On that date, 
degree-granting authority changed to the Commander of Air University when President George 
W. Bush signed the Public Law 108–375, Fiscal Year 2005 National Defense Authorization Act. 
The CCAF administrative center is located at Maxwell Air Force Base-Gunter Annex, Alabama. 
It is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 
community college system within the Department of Defense and two-year institution exclusively 
serving enlisted personnel. Over the years the College has grown both in numbers and recognition 
as the largest multi-campus community college system in the world. Today, more than 6,500 
CCAF faculty deliver more than 2,000 credit-awarding courses at more than 100 affiliated school 
campuses worldwide to more than 270,000 students. Each year more than 1.6 million semester 
hours of collegiate credit are earned in CCAF classrooms. More than one million official 
transcripts have been issued in the last 10 years. Since its first degree in 1977, more than 580,000 
CCAF associate of applied science degrees have been awarded. 
Mission. Provide enlisted professionals pathways to degrees and credentials through military 
education, training, and experience. CCAF awards the associate of applied science degree to total 
force enlisted Airmen. The college offers associate of applied science degree programs in four 
broad career groups: (1) operations, (2) logistics, (3) medical, and (4) support. 
Accreditation. The Department of Education defines accreditation as, “the recognition that an 
institution maintains standards requisite for its graduates to gain admission to other reputable 
institutions of higher learning or to achieve credentials for professional practice.” The goal of 
accreditation is to ensure that education provided by institutions of higher learning meets 
acceptable standards. In the United States, an institution’s accreditation is a major method for 
students, government officials, employers, and academic institutions to know that an institution 
provides quality education. 
CCAF is a part of Air University. Air University is accredited by the Southern Association of 
Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award the associate, master’s, and doctoral 
degrees. The associate degree from CCAF is awarded under the authority of Air University. 
Associate of Applied Science Degree. Associate degrees earned in professional, technical, or 
terminal programs are frequently called associate of applied science degrees. The educational 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
145 
 
 
 
standard for the associate of applied science degree is designed for students who plan to seek 
employment based upon the competencies and skills attained through these programs and to offer 
the academic, technical, and professional knowledge and skills required for job acquisition, 
retention, and advancement. While not designed to meet the needs of students who transfer to a 
four-year institution, portions of these programs often do so. 
The CCAF offers and awards the associate of applied science degree through a combination of 
collegiate credit earned through completed formal technical training courses delivered at CCAF 
affiliated schools and courses completed at accredited civilian colleges or credit by examination. 
Since enlisted Airmen are constantly relocating in performance of their duties, the CCAF provides 
a means of completing degree requirements regardless of location of assignment. 
Enlisted Airmen are automatically registered in the CCAF associated of applied science degree 
program designed for their USAF specialty near their completion of basic military training. 
Effective with the 2022-2024 CCAF General Catalog, degree graduates must complete the 60 
semester-hour academic requirements, hold at least the Journeyman 5-skill level or equivalent, 
have a minimum of 9 semester hours of CCAF institutional credit in degree-applicable Technical 
Education (non-Military Technology and Applied Sciences Management), and have a minimum 
of 15 semester hours of CCAF institutional credit applied overall. Commonly known as 
“Residency”, institutional credit is credit earned from CCAF credit-awarding courses. Table 7.1. 
specifies the educational requirements for the typical CCAF associate of applied science degree 
and the semester-hour requirements in each subject area.

Collegiate Credit. The CCAF awards collegiate academic credit for degree-applicable courses 
delivered at affiliated military schools. The College does accept credit in-transfer from other 
accredited colleges to be applied toward specific degree program requirements. General education 
courses accepted in-transfer must meet Southern Association of Colleges and School Commission 
on Colleges standards, and Air University and CCAF in-transfer policy. Students may also earn 
CCAF collegiate credit for specific national professional credentials (licensure or certification) 
that are approved by the College to satisfy applicable degree program technical education and

program elective requirements. Courses that are delivered at schools not affiliated with CCAF or 
by non-CCAF faculty are not certified by CCAF and are not awarded CCAF academic credit. The 
CCAF General Catalog (https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/CCAF/documents/2022-
2024_CCAF_General_Catalog-Change1.pdf) provides policy information concerning acceptance 
of course credit in- transfer from other accredited colleges and professional credentialing credit for 
application toward specific degree programs. 
Air University Student Information System (AUSIS). The AUSIS provides students with 
timely and accurate academic information pertaining to CCAF Associate of Applied Science 
degree program progression. This web-based resource is accessible via weblink or from the Air 
Force Virtual Education Center (AFVEC), enabling students to view their CCAF degree audit, 
also known as the student progress report. 
Air University Associate-to-Baccalaureate Cooperative Program. The Air University 
Associate-to-Baccalaureate Cooperative (AU-ABC) program (https://afvec.us.af.mil/afvec/au-
abc/welcome) links CCAF associate of applied science degree programs to accredited four-year 
colleges and universities that provide online bachelor degree opportunities to CCAF graduates. 
Each AU-ABC degree program is linked to one or more CCAF associate of applied science 
degrees. To participate in the AU-ABC Program, enlisted Airmen must be currently serving in 
the RegAF, Air Force Reserves, or Air National Guard. Once enrolled, the student may continue 
degree completion requirements after retirement or separation.

Professional Credentialing Programs. Just like higher-education, professional credentialing is 
an important element of force development as it provides up-to-date industry-recognized 
credentials applicable to USAF occupations. CCAF offers credentialing programs to assist 
enlisted Airmen in broadening their professional development. Credentialing directly supports the 
mission of the CCAF in that credentialing of enlisted Airmen enhances combat readiness, 
contributes to recruiting and retention, and supports career transitions. To support documentary 
evidence of training, skills, and practical experience, Airmen are highly encouraged to maintain 
records of all previous and current education, training, and qualifications.  
Joint Service Aviation Maintenance Technician Certification Council (JSAMTCC). The 
CCAF offers the JSAMTCC Airframe & Powerplant (A&P) program to Aviation Maintenance 
Technicians (AMT) in specific Military Occupational Classifications (MOC) across the DoD and 
the USCG, which streamlines the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) A&P certification 
process for military members who hold or have held those MOCs. The program is designed to 
bridge gaps between military AMT’s formal technical training, upgrade training, and experience 
and FAA certification eligibility requirements. Upon successful completion of the program, the 
CCAF provides the necessary documents to meet FAA eligibility and provides authorization to 
take the A&P exams, eliminating the FAA Flight Standards District Office preauthorization 
process. The program benefits the joint force by broadening the skillsets and professional 
development of military AMTs, producing a more well-rounded and diverse aircraft maintenance 
professional. Agreements with the FAA allow military testing sites to administer FAA certification 
knowledge exams free of charge to all who are eligible.

CCAF Instructional Systems Development (ISD) Certificate Program. CCAF offers the 
Instructional Systems Development Certificate Program for qualified curriculum writers and 
managers formally assigned to CCAF affiliated schools to develop and manage CCAF degree- 
applicable courses. This certificate program provides a professional credential that validates the 
education and training required to develop and manage CCAF collegiate-level courses and the 
practical experience gained in planning, developing, implementing, and managing instructional 
systems. 
CCAF Instructor Certification Program. CCAF offers the CCAF Instructor Certificate Program 
to qualified instructors assigned to affiliated schools to teach CCAF degree-applicable courses. 
This certificate program provides a professional credential that validates the instructor’s extensive 
faculty development training, education, qualification, and practical teaching experience required 
to teach a CCAF collegiate-level course. The program consists of three specific levels of 
achievement, and is offered to qualified officer, enlisted, civilian, and other service instructors. 
Air Force Credentialing Opportunities On-Line Program. Air Force Credentialing 
Opportunities On-Line Program. The Air Force Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (AFCOOL) 
program (https://afvec.us.af.mil/afvec/af-cool/welcome) provides funding for USAF DAF 
specialty-applicable credentials to enlisted Airmen members on Title 10 or Title 32 (502)f RegAF 
orders. The program funds a maximum of $4,500 during the Airman’s career, which pays for the 
exams, preparation courses, books, study materials, administrative fees, and recertification fees 
necessary to maintain the credential. CCAF manages the AFCOOL program, which aligns USAF 
DAF specialties with civilian industry professionally recognized credentials (certification and 
licensure). Alignment is based on evaluation and analysis of formal specialty-related technical 
training and occupational skills at the Journeyman (5-skill-level), taking into consideration 
industry credentials and requirements. Visit the AFCOOL website to determine eligibility for 
funding approval. The AFCOOL program website also contains additional information about 
civilian industry credentialing; eligibility requirements and resources to prepare for the exams; 
credentials relevant to USAF DAF specialties; filling gaps between USAF DAF technical 
training, experiences, and credentialing requirements; obtaining AFCOOL funding to pay for 
credentialing exams, preparatory courses, study materials, associated fees, and recertification; and 
civilian occupational equivalencies and job opportunities.

7.25. Enhanced Education Opportunities 
Certifications and post-secondary degrees, to include associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or other 
advanced academic degrees, are important for professional development to the extent that they 
enhance the degree holder’s job and professional qualifications. Members should focus on 
enhancing professional competence while expanding their operational employment of air and 
cyberspace knowledge. Certifications and degrees directly related to an individual’s primary 
specialty area or occupational series adds to the depth of job knowledge. More advanced degrees 
also enhance job performance for personnel reaching the highest grade levels where duties may 
require broader managerial skills. 
Enlisted-to-Air Force Institute of Technology Program. The Enlisted-to-Air Force Institute of 
Technology (AFIT) program (https://www.afit.edu/) is a unique element of enlisted force 
development that enhances the future Total Force. In conjunction with other professional education 
and training programs, AFIT science, engineering, and management graduate degrees further 
develop technical and managerial skills, enhance combat capability through career field core 
competency augmentation, and provide the USAF with highly proficient NCOs. Enlisted-to-AFIT 
degrees range from 18 to 24 months, depending upon a student’s undergraduate degree and 
prerequisite course work, and are limited to master’s degree programs offered at the resident 
campus, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. 
To be nominated for this program, a member must be a RegAF Staff Sergeant (or Staff Sergeant- 
select) or above with a minimum of five years of Total Active Federal Military Service. The 
nominee must have completed a 7-skill level upgrade, a Community College of the Air Force 
(CCAF) associated of applied science degree, and a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited 
institution.  
7.26. Air Force Virtual Education Center 
The Air Force Virtual Education Center (AFVEC) (https://afvec.us.af.mil/afvec/public/welcome) is 
the USAF’s website for all higher education and credentialing needs. Airmen may create their own 
AFVEC account and gain access to online customer service tools. Airmen can also view 
information about education benefits and personal education records, which include courses taken, 
tuition caps, and degree plans. This is the site for Airmen to apply online for military tuition 
assistance for civilian college courses and USAF Credentialing Opportunities On-line (AF COOL) 
funding for specialty-related and leadership/management credentials. 
Educational Financial Assistance. The Voluntary Education Program supports long-range USAF 
goals for maintaining a high-quality force and enhancing professional and personal development, 
recruitment, retention, and readiness. The USAF offers three programs for enlisted personnel to 
help defray the cost of obtaining off-duty education: Military Tuition Assistance, Montgomery GI 
Bill, and Post-9/11 GI Bill. 
Military Tuition Assistance. To assist individuals in furthering their education, the USAF 
provides a tuition assistance program (with some restrictions) to all eligible USAF members. The 
USAF pays the cost of tuition at regionally and nationally accredited institutions, not to exceed the 
hourly and annual caps established by DoD Instruction (DoDI) 1322.25, Voluntary Education 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
149 
 
 
 
Program, and DAFI 36-2670, Total Force Development. USAF members cannot use tuition 
assistance to purchase textbooks, e-books, reference/instructional materials, electronic 
equipment/supplies, certificate/license examinations, or fees, regardless of applicability to course 
enrollment or institutional reimbursement policy. Students using military tuition assistance whose 
tuition exceeds the semester hour cap may use the top-up benefit in their Montgomery GI Bill or 
Post-9/11 GI Bill to cover the remaining portion. 
Montgomery GI Bill. Eligible individuals who entered the service for the first time on or after 1 
July 1985 are enrolled in the Montgomery GI Bill. Members who participate have their pay 
reduced by $100 a month for the 12 months following the election window. Participants may also 
elect to contribute an additional $600, which adds a maximum of $5,400 to the total benefit 
package. In-service use of the Montgomery GI Bill is permitted after two years of continuous 
RegAF status. Benefits expire 10 years after separation or retirement. The amount of the total 
benefit is adjusted each year in relation to the cost of living index.  
Post-9/11 GI Bill. Eligible individuals who were on RegAF status on or after 11 September 2001 
may choose to enroll in the Post-9/11 GI Bill. This program allows Airmen to transfer GI Bill 
benefits to dependents if they have sufficient retainability. The details and benefits of the Post- 
9/11 GI Bill are different from the Montgomery GI Bill. The decision to move to this program is 
irrevocable, so Airmen are recommended to get full details from the Veteran Administration 
(https://www.va.gov/) prior to converting.  
7.27. College Credit by Examination 
The Credit-by-Examination program helps service members earn college credit for knowledge 
gained through previous experience. The program directly benefits service members by reducing 
course completion time, avoiding Military Tuition Assistance costs, and documenting scores on 
the Joint Services Transcript (JST) and Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) transcript. 
This no-cost program is managed by the Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support 
(DANTES). Service members can choose between the College-Level Examination Program 
(CLEP) and the Dantes Subject Standardized Test (DSST) exams. With more than 70 exam titles, 
the program provides options to suit most service members. Individuals may earn recommended 
college credits by passing the examinations. However, the amount of credits applied is dependent 
upon the policies of the accepting academic institution. 
DSST Program. The DSST exams are college subject tests service members can take to earn 
college credit for knowledge acquired outside of a traditional classroom. There are 38 subject 
exams from which to select in disciplines such as Business, Humanities, Mathematics, Physical 
Science, and more. Each DSST exam is based on several textbooks commonly used for a course 
of the same or similar title, and no-cost test preparation materials are listed on the DANTES 
(https://www.dantes.mil/) website. 
The CLEP Program. The CLEP exams are college subject tests service members can take to earn 
college credit for what they already know. There are 34 college exams, covering subject areas such 
as Composition and Literature, World Languages, History and Social Sciences, Science and 
Mathematics, and Business. Test takers who pass these exams earn 3-12 recommended lower-level 
college credits, based on the exam taken. No-cost test preparation content is outlined on the 
DANTES (https://www.dantes.mil/) website. 
7.28. Commissioning Programs 
Enlisted members can obtain a commission while on RegAF status through one of the various 
commissioning programs. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
150 
 
 
 
Officer Training School. Eligibility for a commission through Officer Training School requires 
military members to possess a baccalaureate or higher degree from an accredited college or 
university. DAFMAN 36-2032, Military Recruiting and Accessions, contains specific guidance. 
Additionally, the base education services office has information and can provide assistance. 
Leaders Encouraging Airmen Development. The Leaders Encouraging Airmen Development 
Program delegates authority to unit and wing commanders to nominate highly qualified Airmen to 
become USAF officers through USAF Academy attendance. Depending on level of qualifications, 
nominations may lead to direct entry to USAF Academy, entry to the USAF Academy Preparatory 
School, or referral to other programs. 
Scholarships for Outstanding Airmen to Reserve Officer Training Corps. The Scholarships 
for Outstanding Airmen to Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Program allocates scholarship 
quotas for outstanding Airmen. If qualified and selected by the USAF ROTC board, Airmen 
separate from the RegAF and join a USAF ROTC detachment to become full-time college 
students. The USAF provides a tuition and fees scholarship of up to $18,000 per year, an annual 
textbook allowance, and a monthly nontaxable stipend. Award of this scholarship is for two to four 
years, depending on how many years remain in the student’s degree program. Upon graduation 
and completion of the program, students are commissioned as Second Lieutenants and returned to 
RegAF status (typically within 60 days of commissioning) for at least four years. 
USAF Reserve Officer Training Corps Airman Scholarship and Commissioning. The USAF 
ROTC Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program allows military members to receive a 
USAF ROTC scholarship to attend a college or university of their choice, provided the college or 
university offers a USAF ROTC Program. Those selected separate from the RegAF, join a USAF 
ROTC detachment, and become a full-time college student. The USAF provides a tuition/fees 
scholarship of up to $18,000 per year, and annual textbook allowance, and a monthly nontaxable 
stipend. This scholarship will be awarded for two to four years, depending on how many years 
remain in the student’s bachelor’s degree program. Upon graduation and completion of the 
program, students are commissioned as Second Lieutenant and returned to RegAF status with a 
military obligation of four years in the active component and four years in the ready reserve. After 
graduation and commissioning as a new Second Lieutenant, there may be a wait of up to 365 days 
to enter RegAF. 
Nurse Enlisted Commissioning. The Nurse Enlisted Commissioning Program sponsors enlisted 
members to complete the upper division curriculum toward a baccalaureate degree in nursing. 
Maximum program participation may not exceed 24 months. Participants are administratively 
assigned to a USAF ROTC detachment while completing their degree. After graduation, the 
member must successfully pass the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses 
before attending Officer Training School. 
Enlisted to Medical Degree. The Enlisted to Medical Degree Preparatory Program offers enlisted 
personnel the opportunity to complete the preparatory coursework for admission to medical school 
while maintaining RegAF status. This is a 24-month program offered through Uniformed Services 
University of the Health Services in Bethesda, Maryland to candidates who demonstrate integrity 
and are dedicated to becoming future physicians, leaders, and scholars of the nation’s medical 
force. 
Interservice Physician Assistant. The 29-month Interservice Physician Assistant Program offers 
enlisted personnel the opportunity to complete requirements to earn a master’s degree from the 
University of Nebraska Medical Center and receive a commission as a Physician Assistant in the 
Biomedical Sciences Corps while maintaining RegAF status. Graduates must pass the Physician

8.1.  Performance Feedback Assessment 
The performance feedback assessment is a formal two-way communication between a rater and 
ratee to discuss standards, responsibilities, expectations, and goals. Raters document the feedback 
session to assess or discuss the objectives, standards, behavior, and performance with the ratee. 
Also, during feedback sessions, raters will provide the ratee information on Air Force benefits by 
referring them to MyAirForceBenefits website (https://www.myairforcebenefits.us.af.mil). The 
performance feedback assessment is designed to increase Airmen interaction and support at all 
levels, provide Airmen an opportunity to discuss personal and professional goals, and assist 
Airmen in achieving those goals. Once the performance feedback assessment has been completed, 
raters will give the original, completed, and signed worksheet to the ratee, and maintain copies of 
all completed performance feedback assessments and all signed performance feedback 
assessment notices, or appropriate statements (RegAF only). 
Unit commanders are responsible for developing a tracking mechanism for performance feedback 
assessments and ensuring they are conducted properly. Raters’ raters/reviewing officials of 
evaluations between the rater and the forced distributor/higher level reviewers (HLR) will monitor 
personnel to ensure performance feedback assessments are conducted, as required. When a lower-
level rater is not available due to unusual circumstances, or when officially assuming the 
subordinate rater’s responsibilities, the raters’ rater will conduct performance feedback 
assessment sessions in place of the rater. Ratees are responsible for knowing when their 
performance feedback assessment sessions are due. When a required or requested performance 
feedback assessment does not take place, ratees will notify the rater and, if necessary, the raters’ 
rater. 
Performance feedback assessments are mandatory for officers up through the grade of Colonel, 
and for all enlisted RegAF and Air Reserve Component personnel. For student officers receiving 
DAF Form 475, Education/Training Report, or for enlisted personnel in initial or advanced skills 
training, a performance feedback assessment is not required, but may be given at the discretion of 
school leadership. For performance evaluations completed on non-rated initial or advanced skills 
training students, documented academic progress reports, such as the AETC Form 156, Student 
Training Report, will serve in-lieu of the mandatory mid-term performance feedback assessment. 
The mid-term performance feedback assessment is a mandatory supporting document to be routed 
with the performance evaluation but will not be made a matter of official record. 
8.2.  Guidance for Conducting Performance Feedback Assessment Sessions 
Raters should be impartial and (may include video conferencing) provide honest, realistic 
feedback. The private, face-to-face feedback session is an opportunity to inform an individual of 
where they need improvement, determine if an individual needs more information, and set future 
expectations. It also lets the ratee know what needs to be done before the evaluation performance 
report is due. Feedback, whether positive or negative, needs to be specific. Specific positive 
comments reinforce the behavior, and specific negative comments focus the attention where the 
ratee needs improvement. Raters may only conduct sessions by telephone in unusual 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
153 
 
 
 
circumstances where face-to-face sessions are impractical. 
8.3.  Performance Feedback Assessment Worksheet 
Performance feedback assessment worksheets are used to document formal communication 
between raters and ratees and may be used on the ratee’s evaluation. Each section of the form 
should be filled out to the best of the ratee’s and rater’s ability. The ratee completes Section III 
on their own and reviews Section IX (AB thru Technical Sergeant) or VIII (Master Sergeant thru 
Chief Master Sergeant) prior to the feedback session. The areas following Section III are 
completed by the rater. Sections are broken into various categories to allow raters to objectively 
indicate the ratee’s level of performance in each area. There are three different performance 
feedback assessment worksheets, designated for use based on the ratee’s grade. 
AF Form 724, Airman Comprehensive Assessment Worksheet (2Lt thru Col) 
AF Form 931, Airman Comprehensive Assessment Worksheet (AB thru TSgt) 
AF Form 932, Airman Comprehensive Assessment Worksheet (MSgt thru CMSgt) 
In addition to the AF Form 724, raters are required to use the AF Form 724-A, Airman 
Comprehensive Assessment Addendum, for officers. It is optional for raters use the AF Form 724-
A for SNCOs as an informal guiding document to supplement the performance feedback. 
8.4.  When to Conduct the Airman Comprehensive Assessment 
In most cases, the military personnel flight will provide a computer-generated performance 
feedback assessment notice to raters and ratees within 30 days of when supervision begins 
(identifying initial or follow-up performance feedback assessment sessions, as required), and 
again halfway between the time supervision began and the projected performance report close-
out date (identifying mid-term performance feedback assessment session requirements). The 
notice serves to remind raters that a performance feedback assessment session is due; however, 
failure to receive a performance feedback assessment notice does not justify failing to hold a 
required session. The Air National Guard does not currently have an automated process for 
performance feedback assessment notices and may use an alternate form of communication to 
notify raters and ratees of performance feedback assessment schedules. 
All initial performance feedback assessment sessions must be conducted within the first 60 days 
of when supervision begins. This will be the ratee’s only initial feedback until there is a change 
of reporting official. The rater must conduct a mid-term performance feedback assessment session 
midway between the date supervision begins and the next evaluation projected close-out date. For 
the end-of-reporting period, the rater conducts the performance feedback assessment session 
within 60 days after the evaluation has been accomplished. Note: Ratees may request feedback 
as long as 60 days have passed since the last session. For Chief Master Sergeants and colonels, 
the initial performance feedback assessment is the only feedback required. If the ratee is due an 
annual evaluation and the period of supervision is less than 150 days, the rater conducts the 
performance feedback assessment approximately 60 days before the projected evaluation close-
out date. For Lieutenant through Captain only, if an evaluation is due to a change of reporting 
official, the new rater will do initial feedback. This feedback may be accomplished using the 
performance feedback assessment worksheet, but documentation is not required. For Airman Basic, 
Airman, or Airman First Class (with less than 20 months of Total Active Federal Military 
Service), after the initial feedback, a mid-term performance feedback assessment session is 
conducted every 180 days until the rater writes a performance report or a change of reporting 
official occurs.

8.5.  Performance Evaluation Administration 
The performance evaluation system is designed to provide a reliable, long-term, cumulative 
record of performance and potential. The key aspects associated with the evaluation system are 
how well the individual does his or her job. It is important for supervisors to help subordinates 
understand their strengths and weaknesses and how their efforts contribute to the mission. 
Supervisors must understand how and when to employ the officer and enlisted evaluation systems 
and the civilian performance program. 
Access to Evaluations. Evaluations are “Controlled Unclassified Information” forms and must 
be marked, protected, and accessed accordingly. The office with custodial responsibility is 
responsible for determining if a requestor’s official duties require access.  
Classified Information and Security Classification. Do not enter classified information in any 
section of the evaluation; this includes attachments to evaluations, referral documents, and 
endorsements to referral documents. If an entry would result in the release of classified 
information, use the word “Data Masked” in place of that entry. In cases where the evaluator is 
assigned to a classified organization or location, enter “Data Masked” for organization 
nomenclature and nothing more. Specific instructions for completing evaluations, with reference 
to proper formatting, appropriate raters/evaluators, HLR and Senior Raters, content, acronym use, 
classified information, and other details, are found in AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted 
Evaluation Systems. 
8.6.  Performance Evaluation Uses 
The officer and enlisted evaluation systems should be used with the following objectives in mind: 
Effectively communicate performance standards and expectations and provide meaningful 
feedback on how those standards and expectations are being upheld. 
Provide a reliable, long-term, cumulative record of performance and promotion potential based 
on that performance. 
Provide sound information to assist in making talent management decisions. 
Document in the permanent record any substantiated allegation of a sex-related offense against 
an Airman, regardless of grade, that results in conviction by court-martial, non- judicial 
punishment, or other adverse administrative action. 
8.7.  Performance Evaluation Forms and Documentation 
There are a number of forms/briefs, as listed below, used to document performance and potential 
over the course of a ratee’s career. These forms are considered when making promotion 
recommendations, selections or propriety actions, selective continuations, involuntary 
separations, selective early retirements, assignments, school nominations and selections, and 
other management decisions. Note: The ratee’s grade or projected grade on the static close-out 
date is used to determine the appropriate performance report form.

8.8.  Performance Evaluation Responsibilities 
Unit commanders will ensure supervisors are properly trained and educated on how to write a 
performance evaluation. Unit commanders must conduct a record review of all personnel assigned 
to and/or transferred into his or her command to ensure knowledge of and familiarization with the 
Airman’s history of sex-related offenses resulting in conviction by courts-martial, non-judicial 
punishment, or other adverse administrative action. This is accomplished to reduce the likelihood 
that repeat offenses will escape the notice of current, subsequent, or higher-level commanders. 
Review of the record will be conducted by the immediate commander of the Airman at the lowest 
unit level. These responsibilities will not be delegated. 
Raters, reviewers, Senior Rater, and HLRs must consider the contents of Unfavorable Information 
Files or Personal Information Files when preparing a performance evaluation. They must assess 
the ratee’s performance, what the ratee did, how well he or she did it, and the ratee’s potential 
based on that performance throughout the rating period. 
Ratees must review evaluations prior to them becoming a matter of record. This is the time to 
bring typos, spelling errors, and inaccurate data to the attention of the rater. When the ratee signs 
the evaluation, he or she is not concurring with the content, but rather acknowledging receipt of 
the completed evaluation, and certifying they have reviewed the evaluation for administrative 
errors. If the ratee disagrees with any comments and/or ratings on the report, the ratee may file an 
appeal after the evaluation becomes a matter of record. 
8.9.  Documenting Performance 
Include at least one performance statement in each section of the evaluation being accomplished. 
A performance statement is a standalone sentence that must include two elements:  1) the behavior 
or action taken by an Airman; and 2) the impact, results, or outcome of that behavior or action.  
Adverse Information. The expectation for performance evaluations is fair and equal treatment of 
all, and enforcement of the same behavior in subordinates. The goal is for fair and accurate 
evaluations to help ensure the best qualified members are identified for positions of higher 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
156 
 
 
 
responsibility. Failure to document misconduct that deviates from the core values of the USAF is 
a disservice to all Airmen who serve with honor and distinction. Situations involving convictions 
or violations of criminal law must be handled appropriately and in accordance with required 
timelines and procedures. 
In all cases, when comments are included in performance evaluations, they must be specific, 
outlining the event and any corrective action taken. Comments, such as “conduct unbecoming…” 
or “an error in judgment led to an off-duty incident…,” are too vague. Examples of valid comments 
are “Master Sergeant Smith drove while intoxicated, for which he received an Article 15” and 
“Captain Jones made improper sexually suggestive and harassing comments to a squadron 
member, for which he received a Letter of Reprimand.” Some aspects of performance that may 
need to be considered when preparing an accurate assessment of behavior include: 
Impact of the misconduct on the USAF as an institution (Did it bring discredit on the USAF?). 
Impact of the misconduct on, and its relationship to, the ratee’s duties (Did it affect the ratee’s 
ability to fulfill assigned duties?). 
Impact of the misconduct on the USAF mission (Did the mission suffer in any way? Was unit 
morale affected?). 
Grade, assignment, and experience of the ratee (Is the ratee in a sensitive job? Did the ratee know 
better?). 
Number of separate violations and frequency of the misconduct (Is this an isolated or repeated 
incident?). 
Consequences of the misconduct (Did it result in death, injury, or loss of/damage to military 
or civilian property?). 
Other dissimilar acts of misconduct during the reporting period (Is the ratee establishing a 
pattern of misconduct?). 
Existence of unique, unusual, or extenuating circumstances (Was the misconduct willful and 
unprovoked or were there aggravating factors or events?). 
Adverse Actions. For the purpose of this policy, an adverse action includes reportable civilian 
offenses or convictions, other than convictions for motor vehicle violations that do not require a 
court appearance. Specifically, convictions required to be reported include: 1) any finding of guilt; 
2) any plea of guilty; 3) any plea of no contest or nolo contendere; 4) any plea of guilty in exchange 
for a deferred prosecution or diversion program; or 5) any other similar disposition of civilian 
criminal charges. 
In the event a commander or military law-enforcement official receives information that a member 
of the USAF, under the jurisdiction of another military department, has become subject to a 
conviction for which a report is required by this section, the commander or military law- 
enforcement official receiving such information shall forward it to the member’s immediate 
commander. 
Complaints of sex-related offenses against a member, regardless of grade, resulting in conviction 
by court-martial, non-judicial punishment, or adverse administrative action, require a mandatory 
notation on the member’s next performance report or training report and promotion 
recommendation form (if not already documented on an evaluation or court-martial in the selection 
record). Sex-related offenses include violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice or attempts 
to commit related offenses. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
157 
 
 
 
If a member has been convicted by a court-martial or if the senior rater decides to file any adverse 
information in an Airman’s selection record, comments relating to the ratee’s behavior are 
mandatory on the ratee’s next performance or training report and promotion recommendation form 
(if not already documented on an evaluation or court-martial in the selection record). The 
evaluation becomes a referral for the performance report or training report. 
Extraordinary Cases. Raters may request a waiver of the mandatory requirement to document 
civilian convictions for good cause. The waiver request will route from the rater, through any 
required additional rater and the ratee’s commander, to the ratee’s senior rater, and, if endorsed, 
be forwarded to the major command commander, or authorized final approval authority.

8.10. Selective Reenlistment Program 
The Selective Reenlistment Program applies to all enlisted personnel by which 
commanders/civilians, directors, and supervisors evaluate first-term, second-term, and career 
Airmen to ensure the USAF retains those who consistently demonstrate the capability and 
willingness of maintaining high professional standards. First-term Airmen receive selective 
reenlistment consideration when they are within 15 months of their expiration of term of service. 
Second-term and career Airmen with less than 19 years of total active federal military service are 
considered within 13 months of the original expiration of term of service. Career Airmen receive 
selective reenlistment consideration within 13 months of completing 20 years of total active federal 
military service. Career Airmen who have served beyond 20 years of total active federal military 
service receive selective reenlistment consideration each time they are within 13 months of their 
original expiration of term of service. 
8.11. Selective Reenlistment Program Considerations 
Commanders and civilian directors consider enlisted performance report ratings, unfavorable 
information from any substantiated source, the Airman’s willingness to comply with USAF 
standards, and the Airman’s ability (or lack thereof) to meet required training and duty 
performance levels when determining if a member may reenlist. Supervisors should carefully 
evaluate the Airman’s duty performance and review the Airman’s personnel records, to include 
the DAF Form 1137, Unfavorable Information File Summary, if applicable, before making a 
recommendation to unit commanders and civilian directors concerning the Airman’s career 
potential. 
Non-Selectee. If an Airman is not selected for reenlistment, an DAF Form 418, Selective 
Reenlistment Program (SRP) Consideration/Denial of Continued Service for Airmen, is 
completed, and the Airman is informed of the decision. The commander sends the completed form 
to the military personnel flight after the Airman signs and initials the appropriate blocks. The 
commander must make sure the Airman understands the right to appeal the decision. The Airman 
has up to three calendar days to render an appeal intent. The Airman must submit the appeal to the 
military personnel flight within 10 calendar days of the date he or she renders the appeal intent on 
the form. 
Appeal Authority. The specific appeal authority is based on an Airman’s total active federal 
military service. The appeal authority for first-term Airmen and career Airmen who will complete 
at least 20 years of total active federal military service on their current expiration of term of service 
appeal selective reenlistment program non-selection is the respective group commander. The 
appeal authority for second-term and career Airmen who will complete fewer than 16 years of total 
active federal military service on their current expiration of term of service is the respective wing 
commander. The appeal authority for second-term and career Airmen who will complete at least 
16 years of total active federal military service but fewer than 20 years of total active federal 
military service on their current expiration of term of service, is the Secretary of the Air Force. 
The decision of the appeal authority is final. The appeal authority’s decision is documented, and 
the Airman is advised of the outcome. Commanders may also conduct selective reenlistment 
consideration at any time outside the standardized window. 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

8.12. Noncommissioned Officer Career Status Program 
The Noncommissioned Officer Career Status Program extends the length of reenlistments for 
RegAF Airmen. All Airmen who have been selected for continued service by their 
commander/civilian director (to include those with approved waivers), and who have at least 12 
years total active federal military service on date of discharge (day prior to reenlistment) will be 
reenlisted for an unspecified period. These Airmen will serve up to their High Year of Tenure 
based on current grade, or if promoted, projected grade unless sooner separated by USAF policy 
or law under the NCO Career Status Program. Airmen who serve 20 or more years of total active 
federal military service may retire, if otherwise eligible, no later than the first day of the month 
following High Year of Tenure. 
This program streamlines the reenlistment and extension process and alleviates unnecessary 
administrative actions for Airmen, supervisor chains, and military personnel flights. 
8.13. Career Job Reservation Program 
Because of various career force size and composition restrictions, there are times when the USAF 
must place a limit on the number of authorized first-term Airmen who may reenlist. The Career 
Job Reservation (CJR) Program exists to assist in the management of first-term Airmen 
reenlistments by AFSC prevent surpluses and shortages. All eligible first-term Airmen must have 
an approved CJR to reenlist. Airmen are automatically placed on the career job applicant list on 
the first duty day of the month during which they complete 35 months on their current enlistment 
(59 months for six-year enlistees), but no later than the last duty day of the month during which 
they complete 43 months on their current enlistment (67 months for six- year enlistees). To keep 
their approved CJR, Airmen must reenlist on or before the CJR expiration date. CJRs may be 
constrained (limited) quotas or unconstrained (unlimited) quotas. 
Constrained: First-term Airmen in constrained AFSCs have limited quotas, when available and 
compete for a CJR. Commanders or civilian directors recommend award of CJRs to Airmen in 
constrained AFSCs where an allocation has been awarded. Approval of CJRs are made at the group 
commander level or equivalent. Commanders or civilian directors may recommend First Term 
Airmen for award of a CJR anytime during the Airman’s CJR window. Airmen outside their CJR 
window are not eligible for award of a CJR. Airmen’s evaluations must reflect that the member 
has met the minimum expectation and not have an unfavorable information file, lost time, or 
record of active nonjudicial punishment on their current enlistment in order to be considered for a 
CJR. The Airman’s job performance, demonstrated leadership, how the Airmen exemplifies 
USAF core values, and ability to succeed in the AFSC should also be considered. Upon Airmen 
entering their CJR window, commanders or civilian directors are encouraged to advise Airmen 
on their potential for a CJR and when appropriate, encourage retraining. 
When constrained AFSCs are implemented, Air Force Personnel Center issues CJR quotas on a 
fiscal year basis and selection authorities may consider Airmen by board, nomination packages, 
etc. Airmen who are on the CJR waiting list and whose AFSC is removed from the constrained list 
will receive a CJR. Airmen who are removed from the waiting list prior to the AFSC being 
removed, will not receive supplemental consideration. If eligible, Airmen qualify for award of a 
CJR when an allocation exists, and the Airman is in their CJR eligibility window. When the group 
commander (or equivalent) approves an Airman for award of a CJR, Air Force Personnel Center 
will verify an allocation exists and will reduce the number of remaining CJRs accordingly. Note: 
Approved CJRs do not expire until the Airman’s date of separation. 
Unconstrained: Airmen in unconstrained AFSCs do not compete for a CJR. Airmen are 
automatically awarded the CJR on the first duty day of the month during which they complete 35 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
160 
 
 
 
months on their current enlistment (59 months for six-year enlistees), but no later than the last duty 
day of the month during which they complete 43 months on their current enlistment (67 months 
for six-year enlistees), provided they have been selected for continued service by their 
commander/civilian director under the selective reenlistment program. 
8.14. Enlistment Extensions 
Airmen serving on an active enlistment may request an enlistment extension if he or she has a 
service-directed retainability reason and the extension is in the best interest of the USAF. 
Extensions are granted in whole-month increments. For example, if the individual needs 15½ 
months of retainability for an assignment, the individual must request a full 16-month extension. 
Voluntary extensions for all Airmen are limited to a maximum of 48 months per enlistment. In the 
event that USAF specialties are constrained, the Air Staff may limit first-term Airmen extensions 
to a specified period. Certain situations (such as citizenship pending) may warrant exceptions to 
policy. Airmen may be eligible to request an extension of enlistment to establish a date of 
separation at high year of tenure to separate or retire. Normally, Airmen must be within two years 
of their high year of tenure before they can extend. Note: Once approved, an extension has the 
legal effect of the enlistment agreement by extending the Airman’s period of obligated service. 
Enlistment extensions can only be canceled when the reason for the extension no longer exists, as 
long as the Airman has not already entered into the extension. 
8.15. Selective Retention Bonus 
The Selective Retention Bonus (SRB) Program is a monetary incentive paid to Airmen serving in 
certain selected critical military skills who reenlist for additional obligated service. The bonus is 
intended to encourage the reenlistment of sufficient numbers of qualified enlisted personnel in 
military skills with either demonstrated retention shortfalls or high training costs. Airmen in SRB 
skills who reenlist or extend their enlistment in the active duty for at least three years are eligible 
for an SRB provided they meet all criteria listed in DAFI 36-2606, Reenlistment and Extension 
of Enlistment in the United States Air Force. Airmen can expect to serve in the SRB specialty for 
the entire enlistment for which the bonus was paid. 
SRB designations are established by zones, which are determined by the total active federal 
military service of Airmen at the time of reenlistment or the date they enter the extension. Eligible 
Airmen may receive an SRB in each zone (A, B, C or E), but only one SRB per zone. 
Zone A applies to Airmen reenlisting between 17 months and 6 years.  
Zone B applies to Airmen reenlisting between 6 and 10 years. 
Zone C applies to Airmen reenlisting between 10 and 14 years.  
Zone E applies to Airmen reenlisting between 18 and 20 years. 
SRBs are calculated using one month's base pay, multiplied by the number of years reenlisting or 
extending, multiplied by the SRB multiple as listed on the authorized SRB listing. The maximum 
SRB per zone is $100,000. Note: The Airman's base pay on the date of discharge is used to 
calculate the SRB. Therefore, if an Airman was promoted to Staff Sergeant on 1 May and reenlisted 
on 1 May, the SRB would be calculated on the base pay of the day prior to the reenlistment as 
Senior Airman. 
8.16. USAF Retraining Program 
Retraining is a force management tool used primarily to balance career fields (officer and enlisted) 
across all AFSCs, and to ensure sustainability of career fields. Retraining also provides a means to 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
161 
 
 
 
return disqualified Airmen to a productive status. Although Airmen may be selected for 
involuntary retraining based on USAF needs, the retraining program allows a limited number of 
Airmen the opportunity to pursue other career paths in the USAF. The Online Retraining Advisory 
is a living document found on myFSS, maintained by the Air Force Personnel Center as a key tool 
used to advise members of retraining opportunities. For additional information on retraining 
eligibility and application procedures, refer to: AFMAN 36-2100. 
First-Term Airmen Retraining Program. First-term Airmen assigned to the Continental United 
States may apply not earlier than the first duty day of the month during which they complete 35 
months of their current enlistment (59 months for six-year enlistees), but not later than the last 
duty day of the 43rd month of their current enlistment (67 months for six-year enlistees). 
First-term Airmen assigned outside the Continental United States may apply for retraining nine to 
15 months prior to the date they are eligible to return from overseas if serving within their normal 
first-term window (35th month for four-year enlistees or 59th month for six-year enlistees). 
Airmen with an indefinite return from overseas date must complete the original tour length before 
departing for retraining. 
On the last duty day of each month, the Air Force Personnel Center selects the most eligible 
Airmen for retraining based on quality indicators of most recent performance report rating, current 
grade, projected grade, previous two performance report ratings, date of rank, total active federal 
military service date, aptitude qualification examination score (electrical, mechanical, 
administrative, general), Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, Part II, and requested AFSC 
preferences. 
Noncommissioned Officer Retraining Program. The NCO retraining program is designed to 
retrain second-term and career Airmen from overage USAF specialties into shortage specialties to 
optimize the enlisted force and to best meet current and future mission needs. Airmen possessing 
a secondary or additional AFSC in a shortage skill may be returned to the shortage skill if in the 
best interest of the USAF. 
Phases I and II. The NCO retraining program consists of two phases. The objective of Phase I is 
to obtain volunteer applicants from identified overage AFSCs to fill requirements in shortage 
specialty codes. All Airmen with retraining ‘out’ objectives may apply for any available specialty 
codes with retraining ‘in’ objectives for which they qualify. During Phase I, if sufficient 
applications are not received and retraining objectives for the fiscal year are not met, 
implementation of Phase II is necessary. In Phase II, Airmen will be selected for mandatory 
retraining based on USAF needs to balance the force. The master vulnerability list is used to select 
Airmen for mandatory retraining. 
8.17. Officer Crossflow and Reclassification Programs 
Tools and procedures are available to address career field manning imbalances and shape the 
officer force within authorized, funded end-strength. The Nonrated Line Crossflow Program 
addresses manning shortages and overages by conducting a crossflow panel when needed to select 
the best qualified officers to fill the required vacancies. The Missileer Crossflow Program is a 
process ensuring the Nuclear and Missile Operations (13N) Air Force specialty remains balanced 
for sustainment by crossflowing excess officers at the four-year point back to donor career fields. 
Out-of-cycle crossflow requests, as well as initial skills training reclassification, are additional 
programs to ensure the balance of officer career fields.

8.18. Awards and Decorations Program 
USAF members make many personal and professional sacrifices to ensure the USAF accomplishes 
its mission. Acts of valor, heroism, exceptional service, and outstanding achievement deserve 
special recognition. The Department of the Air Force Military Awards and Decorations Program, 
as outlined in DAFMAN 36-2806, Military Awards: Criteria and Procedures, is designed to 
recognize units, organizations, and individuals, and to foster morale, provide incentive, and instill 
esprit de corps. Individuals or units considered for awards and decorations under this program must 
clearly demonstrate sustained and superior performance.  
8.19. DoD Campaign, Expeditionary, and Service Awards 
DoD campaign, expeditionary, and service awards recognize participation in military campaigns and

8.20. Unit Awards 
These awards are presented to military units that distinguish themselves during peacetime or in 
action against hostile forces or an armed enemy of the United States. To preserve the integrity of 
unit awards, they are approved only to recognize acts or services clearly and distinctly outstanding 
by nature and magnitude. The acts or services recognized must place the unit’s performance above 
that of other units similar in composition and mission and be of such importance that they cannot 
be appropriately recognized in any other way. Only one unit award is awarded for the same 
achievement or service. The unit’s entire service must have been honorable during the 
distinguished act. An organization may display the award elements of a unit award. Designated 
subordinate units of the organization (except foreign units) may also share in the award; however, 
higher organizations may not. All assigned or attached people who served with a unit during a 
period for which a unit award was awarded are authorized the appropriate ribbon if they directly 
contributed to the mission and accomplishments of the unit. The five most common unit awards 
worn by USAF members today are the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Gallant Unit Citation, 
the Meritorious Unit Award, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, and the Air Force 
Organizational Excellence Award. 
Presidential Unit Citation. The Presidential Unit Citation is the nation’s highest unit award. It is 
awarded to units of the U.S. Armed Forces and cobelligerent nations, for extraordinary heroism in 
action against an armed enemy on or after 7 December 1941. The unit must have displayed such 
gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult 
and hazardous conditions to have set it apart and above other units participating in the same 
campaign. The degree of heroism required is the same as that which would be required of an Air 
Force C to an individual. 
Joint Meritorious Unit Award. The Joint Meritorious Unit Award recognizes joint units and 
activities, such as a joint task force for meritorious achievement or service superior to that normally 
expected. USAF members assigned or attached to the joint unit or joint task force awarded a Joint 
Meritorious Unit Award may be eligible to wear the Joint Meritorious Unit Award ribbon. 
Gallant Unit Citation. The Gallant Unit Citation was approved by the Secretary of the Air Force 
in March 2004 and is awarded to USAF units for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed 
enemy of the United States while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an 
opposing foreign force on or after 11 September 2001. The unit must have performed with marked 
distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission so as to set it 
apart from and above other units participating in the same conflict. The Gallant Unit Citation will 
normally be earned by units that have participated in single or successive actions covering 
relatively brief time spans. 
Meritorious Unit Award. The Meritorious Unit Award was approved by the Secretary of the Air 
Force in March 2004 and is awarded to USAF units for exceptionally meritorious conduct in 
performance of outstanding achievement or service in direct support of combat operations for at 
least 90 continuous days during the period of military operations against an armed enemy of the 
United States on or after 11 September 2001. Superior performance of normal missions alone will 
not justify award of the Meritorious Unit Award. Service in a combat zone is not required, but 
service must be directly related to the combat effort. The Meritorious Unit Award is not awarded 
to any unit or component previously awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, Air Force 
Organizational Excellence Award, or unit awards from other service components for the same act, 
achievement, or service. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award was established and 
awarded in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force on 6 January 1954. The Air Force 
Outstanding Unit Award is awarded only to numbered units or Numbered Air Forces, air divisions, 
wings, groups, and squadrons. To be awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, an 
organization must have performed meritorious service or outstanding achievements that clearly set 
the unit above and apart from similar units. Commanders must annually review the 
accomplishments of their eligible subordinate units and recommend only those units that are truly 
exceptional. Commanders send Air Force Outstanding Unit Award recommendations to their major 
commands for consideration. Certain recommendations for the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award 
are exempt from annual submission, such as recommendations for specific achievements, combat 
operations, or conflict with hostile forces. Only 10 percent of similar units assigned to a command 
are recommended annually. 
Air Force Organizational Excellence Award. The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award 
was established and awarded in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force on 6 January 1954. The 
Air Force Organizational Excellence Award has the same guidelines and approval authority as the 
Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award is awarded 
to unnumbered organizations, such as a major command, a field operating agency, a direct reporting 
unit, the Office of the Chief of Staff, other Air Staff, and deputy assistant chief of staff agencies. 
Only 10 percent of similar units assigned to a command are recommended annually. 
8.21. DAF DoD Campaign, Expeditionary, and Service Awards

the ribbon may be awarded to USSF members. 
8.22. Decorations 
A decoration is the formal recognition for personal excellence that requires individual nomination 
and USAF or Department of Defense approval. Decorations are awarded in recognition for acts of 
valor, heroism, courage, exceptional service, meritorious service, or outstanding achievement that 
clearly place members above their peers and of such importance that the person cannot receive 
proper recognition in any other way. When being considered for a decoration, the determining 
factors involve the member’s level of responsibility, achievements, accomplishments, manner of 
performance, and the impact of the accomplishment. Each decoration has specific performance 
requirements for award, and an individual may receive only one decoration for any act, 
achievement, or period of service. 
Preparing a Decoration Recommendation. Although responsibility for submitting decoration 
recommendations primarily falls on the immediate supervisor, any person, other than the 
individual being recommended, having firsthand knowledge of the act, achievement, or service, 
may recommend or contribute to a decoration recommendation by providing evidence or 
statements through the supervisor and chain of command of the member being recommended. Do 
not include any, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), classified, highly sensitive, or special 
category 
information 
requiring 
special 
handling 
procedures 
in 
regular 
decoration 
recommendations. 
A memorandum or letter of justification may accompany the decoration recommendation to 
include concrete examples describing the action that was performed. When a decoration 
recommendation is being submitted for foreign military, separated, or retired veterans, or for 
members of another branch of service, a memorandum or letter must be provided. 
Top USAF Decorations. The top USAF decorations, as shown in Figure 8.1., are briefly 
described here.

Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is the highest decoration for heroism in military action that 
can be awarded to a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. The Medal of Honor is awarded for 
conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty while 
engaged in action against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations 
involving conflict with an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces 
engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a 
belligerent party. 
The Medal of Honor is generally presented by the U.S. President to the recipient or the recipient’s 
primary next of kin. Along with the prestige of being awarded the Medal of Honor for 
distinguished acts of valor, recipients, by law, also receive special benefits under the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs, additional privileges, and entitlements. One example, although 
not required by law or military regulation, is that members of the uniformed services are 
encouraged to render salutes to recipients of the Medal of Honor as a matter of respect and 
courtesy, whether or not they are in uniform, and regardless of rank or status. See Attachment 7, 
USAF Medal of Honor Recipients (and official record of location of birth, and date of death). 
Note: According to the U.S. Medal of Honor Historical Society, the first USAF recipient of the 
Medal of Honor was presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 19, 1967, to Major 
Bernard F. Fisher for action in South Vietnam. There are three versions of the Medal of Honor, 
one for each of the military departments of the Department of Defense:  Department of the Army, 
Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force, with slight variations in design. 
Members of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Department of the Navy 
version and members of the Space Force are eligible to receive the Department of the Air Force 
version. 
Air Force Cross. The Air Force Cross is the second highest decoration that can be awarded to a 
member of the U.S. Armed Forces. The Air Force Cross is awarded for extraordinary heroism while 
engaged in action against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations 
involving conflict with an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces 
engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a 
belligerent party. Actions that merit award of the Air Force Cross must be of such a high degree 
that they are above those required for all other combat decorations, but do not merit award of the 
Medal of Honor. 
Distinguished Service Medal. The Distinguished Service Medal is awarded for exceptionally 
meritorious service to the nation in a duty of great responsibility. In wartime, a duty of great 
responsibility is one that involves the exercise of authority or judgment in matters that decide the 
successful operation of a major command, activity, installation, or major program. The discharge 
of such duty must involve the acceptance and fulfillment of the obligation so as to greatly benefit 
the interests of the United States. 
Silver Star. The Silver Star is the third-highest military combat decoration that can be awarded to 
a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. It is awarded for gallantry in action while engaged in action 
against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations involving conflict with 
an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed 
conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. 
Actions that merit the Silver Star must be of such a high degree that they are above those required 
for all other combat decorations, but do not merit award of the Medal of Honor or an Air Force 
Cross. 
Legion of Merit. The Legion of Merit is awarded to U.S. Armed Forces personnel for 
exceptionally meritorious conduct in performance of outstanding duties. Duties must have been 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
169 
 
 
 
performed in a clearly exceptional manner. Foreign military personnel may be awarded the Legion 
of Merit for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the 
United States. 
Distinguished Flying Cross. The Distinguished Flying Cross is awarded for heroism or 
extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight for actions that are entirely 
distinctive, involving operations that are not routine. 
Airman’s Medal. The Airman’s Medal is awarded for heroism involving voluntary risk of life 
under conditions other than those of conflict with an armed enemy of the United States. 
Bronze Star Medal. The Bronze Star Medal is awarded for heroism, valor, or meritorious 
achievement or service (not involving participation in aerial flight) while engaged in an action 
against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations involving conflict with 
an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed 
conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. The 
Bronze Star Medal is awarded for valor in combat to a lesser degree than required for award of the 
Silver Star or the Legion of Merit. 
Purple Heart. The Purple Heart, as shown in Figure 8.2., is awarded for 
wounds received or death after being wounded in any action against an enemy 
of the United States, in any action with an opposing force of a foreign country 
in which the U.S. Armed Forces are or have been engaged, while serving with 
friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed 
force in which the United States is not a belligerent party, as a result of an act 
of any such enemy or opposing armed force, or as a result of an act of any 
hostile foreign force. The Purple Heart is a decoration that a member earns 
entitlement to rather than being awarded through recommendation. Note: 
Since 11 September 2001, the Purple Heart may be awarded  to a service 
member on active duty who is attacked by a foreign terrorist organization that 
targeted a member of the U.S. Armed Forces due to such member’s status as 
a member of the Armed Forces, unless the wound is the result of willful 
misconduct of the member, may be awarded the Purple Heart. An attack by an 
individual or entity shall be considered to be a foreign terrorist organization attack if the individual 
or entity was in communication with the foreign terrorist organization before the attack, and the 
attack was inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization.  
Air Medal. The Air Medal is awarded for heroism or meritorious achievement while participating 
in aerial flight. The Air Medal is awarded to acts accomplished with distinction above and beyond 
that expected of professional Airmen, but not of that warranting award of the Distinguished Flying 
Cross. 
Aerial Achievement Medal. The Aerial Achievement Medal is awarded for sustained meritorious 
achievement while participating in aerial flight. 
Meritorious Service Medal. The Meritorious Service Medal is awarded for outstanding 
meritorious achievement. 
Air and Space Commendation Medal. The Air and Space Commendation medal is awarded for 
distinctive meritorious achievement and service. 
Air and Space Achievement Medal. The Air and Space Achievement Medal is awarded for 
outstanding achievement or meritorious service.

8.23. Special Trophies and Awards 
The USAF sponsors various special trophies and awards programs. Special trophies and awards 
are unique in that the commanders of major commands, field operating agencies, and direct 
reporting units must nominate individuals to compete for these awards. In most cases, commanders 
submit nominations annually. The competition among the nominees is keen. The commander’s 
nomination alone serves as a meaningful recognition because nomination places the individual in 
competition with the best in the USAF or the nation. Two examples of special trophies and awards 
are the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year Award and the Lance P. Sijan Award. DAFMAN 36- 
2806, lists various special trophies and awards programs. 
8.24. Foreign Decorations, Unit Awards, and Service and Campaign Awards 
The DAF does not issue certificates, medals, ribbons, emblems, devices, and badges awarded by 
foreign governments. These items may be available commercially at the individual’s expense. 
DAFMAN 36-2806 provides additional guidance for accepting foreign decorations, unit awards, 
and service and campaign awards. 
Foreign Decorations. Decorations from foreign governments may be accepted only in recognition 
of combat service or for outstanding or unusually meritorious performance. 
Foreign Unit Awards. Foreign unit awards are only authorized after the award has been officially 
accepted by Department of Defense. 
Foreign Service and Campaign Awards. Several foreign campaign and service awards, to 
include North Atlantic Treaty Organization awards, exist as recognition from a foreign 
governmental authority for active combat service or outstanding or unusually meritorious 
performance. Foreign campaign and service awards are only authorized after the award has been 
officially accepted by Department of Defense. 
8.25. Non-Military Awards 
Non-military awards may consist of a certificate, decoration, or award in recognition of death, 
injury, exceptional performance, or meritorious public service awarded by a non-Federal entity. 
Non-military awards and decorations may only be accepted after receiving approval from an 
official approval authority.

Chapter 9 
ENLISTED PROMOTIONS 
Section 9A—Promotion Systems and Programs 
9.1.  Enlisted Promotion Systems 
The enlisted promotion system supports DoD Directive 1304.20, Enlisted Personnel Management 
System (EPMS), by providing visible, relatively stable career progression opportunities; attracting, 
retaining, and motivating the people the military needs; and ensuring a uniform application of the 
principle of equal pay for equal work among the services. While many significant changes have 
taken place with the enlisted promotion systems in recent years, there are some standardized, 
consistent aspects that Airmen recognize and rely on for fair and accurate consideration for 
promotion. AFI 36-2502, Enlisted Airman Promotion and Demotion Programs, provides detailed 
information regarding enlisted promotion systems. Note: This chapter applies to RegAF enlisted 
promotions. 
9.2.  Promotion Quotas 
The Department of Defense limits the number of Airmen the RegAF may have in the top five 
enlisted grades. Promotion quotas for Staff Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant are tied to 
fiscal year-end strength and are affected by funding limits, regulatory limits, and the number of 
projected vacancies in specific grades. Public law, as outlined in Title 10, U.S.C., Armed Forces, 
Chapter 36, Promotion, Separation, and Involuntary Retirement of Officers on the Active Duty 
List, limits the number of Airmen who may serve in the RegAF in the top two enlisted grades. The 
authorized average of enlisted members on RegAF status (other than for training) in pay grades E- 
8 and E-9 in a fiscal year may not be more than 2.5 percent and 1.25 percent, respectively. 
9.3.  Enlisted Promotion Opportunities 
While the USAF promotion system is designed to promote eligible Airmen recommended by their 
commander on a noncompetitive basis, there are additional opportunities and factors for Airmen 
to consider regarding promotions. 
Senior Airman Below-the-Zone Promotion Program. Under the Senior Airman Below-the-
Zone Program, Airmen in the grade of Airman First Class may be considered one time for early 
advancement to Senior Airman if they meet the minimum eligibility criteria. If promoted to Senior 
Airman below-the-zone, the promotion effective date is six months before their fully qualified date. 
Airmen are considered for below-the-zone promotion in the month (December, March, June, or 
September) before the quarter (January - March, April - June, July - September, or October - 
December) that they are eligible. 
Stripes for Exceptional Performers Program. The Stripes for Exceptional Performers (STEP) 
Program is designed to meet those unique circumstances that, in a commander’s judgment, clearly 
warrant promotion. The STEP Program is intended to promote Airmen for compelling, although 
perhaps not quantifiable, reasons. Isolated acts or specific achievements should not be the sole 
basis for promotion under this program. 
Under the STEP Program, commanders at various organizational levels may promote a limited 
number of exemplary performing Airmen with exceptional potential to the ranks of Staff Sergeant 
and Technical Sergeant. An individual may not receive more than one promotion under any

combination of promotion programs within a 12-month period. One exception is that Senior 
Airmen must serve six months of time in grade before being promoted to Staff Sergeant. 
Commanders must ensure personnel who are promoted meet eligibility requirements. 
Weighted Airman Promotion System. NCOs and SNCOs compete for promotion and test under 
the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) in the control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC) 
held on the promotion eligibility cutoff date. Contributing factors are “weighted” or assigned 
points based on the importance relative to promotion. The Promotion Fitness Exam (PFE) contains 
a wide range of USAF knowledge, while the Specialty Knowledge Test (SKT) covers AFSC broad 
technical knowledge. The USAF makes promotion selections under the WAPS within each AFSC, 
not across all AFSCs. This means those who are eligible will compete for promotion with those 
individuals currently working in their AFSC. Selectees are individuals with the highest scores in 
each AFSC, within the quota limitations. If more than one individual has the same total score at 
the cutoff point, the USAF promotes everyone with that score. 
Senior Noncommissioned Officer Promotions. Airmen compete, and are selected for 
promotion, to MSgt in their control AF specialty code, to SMSgt in the superintendent level of 
their control AF specialty code, and to CMSgt in the chief enlisted manager code of their control 
AF specialty code as of promotion eligibility cutoff date. Individuals with a reporting indicator or 
special duty indicator designated as their control AF specialty code on the promotion eligibility 
cutoff date will compete within that reporting indicator or special duty indicator. SNCO 
promotions are accomplished via a central board.  
In-System Supplemental Promotion Process. The in-system supplemental action is typically 
processed on a monthly basis. Eligible Staff Sergeants through Senior Master Sergeants whose 
weighable data changes in their promotion file compete monthly for promotion consideration. In- 
system supplemental consideration also applies to Airmen who test after initial selects have been 
made, such as deployed Airmen, or anyone who was unable to test during their normal testing 
window. 
Senior Noncommissioned Officer Supplemental Promotion Process. The SNCO supplemental 
board is for those members promotion-eligible to Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant, or 
Chief Master Sergeant. Supplemental evaluation boards are conducted on a semiannual basis. 
SNCOs may request to meet the supplemental board if they believe they have a valid request. With 
the exception of a missing static closeout date evaluation, there are no automatic approvals for 
supplemental board consideration when a record did not meet a previous board for which they 
were eligible. Supplemental promotion consideration may not be granted if an error or omission 
appeared on the data verification record or in the SNCO selection record located in the personnel 
records display application, and the individual did not take the necessary steps to correct the error 
prior to promotion selection or prior to the evaluation board. Fully documented supplemental 
consideration requests, to include proof of corrective or follow-up actions taken by the individual 
to correct the error, are submitted to the military personnel flight in writing with the 
recommendation of the individual’s unit commander. The military personnel flight forwards the 
request to Air Force Personnel Center for final approval.

9.4.  Promotion Cycles and Eligibility 
The USAF establishes promotion cycles to ensure timely periodic promotions and to permit 
accurate forecasting of vacancies. Promotion cycles also balance the promotion administrative 
workload and provide promotion eligibility cutoff dates (PECD). Factors for promotion eligibility 
may include proper skill level, sufficient time in grade, sufficient time in service, commander 
recommendation, completion of enlisted professional military education (PME), completion of a 
college degree, cumulative years of enlisted service, and high year of tenure. Note: Air Reserve 
Components promotions are based on a combination of position vacancy, time-in-grade, time-in- 
service, fitness, and completion of appropriate professional military education. 
9.5.  Basic Promotion Guidelines 
The basic promotion guidelines for enlisted members are provided here. 
Promotion to Airman. Airman Basic may be promotion eligible to Airman at six months of time 
in grade. 
Promotion to Airman First Class. Airman may be promotion eligible to Airman First Class at 
10 months of time in grade. Airmen initially enlisting for a period of six years are promoted from 
Airman Basic to Airman First Class upon completion of either technical training or 20 weeks of 
technical training after graduation from basic military training (whichever occurs first). The date 
of rank for Airman First Class is then adjusted to the signatory date on the basic military training 
certificate, without back pay and allowances. 
Promotion to Senior Airman. Airmen may be promotion eligible to Senior Airman upon 
completion of 36 months of time in service and 20 months of time in grade or 28 months of time 
in grade (whichever occurs first). Required skill level in primary AFSC is 3-level. Senior Airman 
below-the-zone is a one-time promotion consideration to advance to Senior Airman six months 
earlier than basic promotion timelines to Senior Airman. 
Promotion to Staff Sergeant. Senior Airmen may be promotion eligible to Staff Sergeant upon 
completion of three years of time in service and six months of time in grade. The PECD for 
promotion to Staff Sergeant is 31 March. The test cycle is May – June. Required skill level in 
primary AFSC is 5-level. 
Promotion to Technical Sergeant. Staff Sergeants may be promotion eligible to Technical 
Sergeant upon completion of five years of time in service and 23 months of time in grade. The 
PECD for promotion to Technical Sergeant is 31 January. The test cycle is February – March. 
Required skill level in primary AFSC is 7-level. 
Promotion to Master Sergeant. Technical Sergeants may be promotion eligible to Master 
Sergeant upon completion of eight years of time in service and 24 months of time in grade. The 
PECD for promotion to Master Sergeant is 30 November. Required skill level in primary AFSC is 
7-level. 
Promotion to Senior Master Sergeant. Master Sergeants may be promotion eligible to Senior 
Master Sergeant upon completion of 11 years of time in service and 20 months of time in grade. 
The PECD for promotion to Senior Master Sergeant is 30 September. Required skill level in 
primary AFSC is 7-level. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
174 
 
 
 
Promotion to Chief Master Sergeant. Senior Master Sergeants may be promotion eligible to 
Chief Master Sergeant upon completion of 14 years of time in service and 21 months of time in 
grade. The PECD for promotion to Chief Master Sergeant is 31 July. Required skill level in primary 
AFSC is 9-level. 
9.6. Accepting Promotion 
Selects to the grade of Master Sergeant and Senior Master Sergeant with more than 18 years Total 
Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) by effective date of promotion will sign a Promotion 
Statement of Understanding within 10 duty days after selections are confirmed. In addition, all 
Chief Master Sergeant-selects, regardless of TAFMS, will sign a Promotion Statement of 
Understanding within 10 duty days after selections are confirmed. The form will acknowledge that 
Master Sergeant-selects and Senior Master Sergeant-selects must obtain two years of service 
retainability and incur a two-year active duty service commitment (ADSC) from the effective date 
of promotion. Chief Master Sergeant-selects must acknowledge and obtain three years of service 
retainability and incur a three-year ADSC from the effective date of promotion. Failure to 
withdraw an existing retirement application (approved or pending) within 10 duty days from 
presentation of the Promotion Statement of Understanding will result in removal from the selection 
list. 
9.7.  Promotion Sequence Numbers 
The Air Force Personnel Center assigns promotion sequence numbers to Airmen selected for 
promotion to Staff Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant based on date of rank, TAFMS, and 
date of birth. Supplemental selectees are assigned promotion sequence numbers of .9 (increment 
previously announced) or .5 (unannounced future increment). 
9.8.  Declining Promotion 
Airmen may decline a promotion in writing by submitting a letter to the military personnel flight 
(MPF). This may be accomplished any time prior to the promotion effective date. The declination 
letter must include name, social security number, promotion cycle, promotion sequence number if 
already selected, and a statement of understanding that reinstatement will not be authorized. MPF 
will ensure Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) is updated and forwards a copy of the 
declination letter to AFPC to be filed in the member’s Automated Records Management System 
(ARMS). 
9.9.  Promotion Ineligibility 
There are many reasons why an Airman may be considered ineligible for promotion, such as 
approved retirement, declination for extension or reenlistment, court-martial conviction, control 
roster action, no commander recommendation, failure to appear for scheduled testing without a 
valid reason and absent without leave. When individuals are ineligible for promotion, they cannot 
test, cannot be considered if already tested, and the projected promotion, if already selected, will 
be canceled.

9.10. Individual Responsibilities 
Preparing for promotion testing is an individual responsibility. All promotion eligible individuals 
must know their eligibility status, maintain specialty and military qualifications, initiate a self- 
study plan, obtain all applicable study references as outlined in the Enlisted Promotions References 
and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC), ensure their selection folder is accurate if it will be reviewed 
by the central evaluation board, and be prepared to test on the beginning of the testing window. 
The importance of individual responsibility cannot be overemphasized. Members who will be 
unavailable during the entire testing cycle must be prepared to test prior to their departure, even if 
that is before the first day of the testing cycle. Airmen may opt to test early provided the correct 
test booklets are available. 
9.11.  Enlisted Promotion Test Compromise 
Airmen must use a self-initiated program of individual study and effort under the Weighted Airman 
Promotion System (WAPS). Group study (two or more people) for the purposes of enlisted 
promotion testing is strictly prohibited. This prohibition protects the integrity of the promotion 
testing program by ensuring promotion test scores are a reflection of each member’s individual 
knowledge. Enlisted personnel who violate these prohibitions are subject to prosecution under 
Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for violating a lawful general regulation. 
Conviction can result in a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and 
confinement for up to two years. Information concerning enlisted promotion test compromise is 
contained in DAFMAN 36-2664. Note: Training designed to improve general military knowledge 
does not constitute group study as long as the intent of the training is not to study for promotion 
tests. Likewise, training to improve general study habits or test-taking skills is permissible if the 
training does not focus on preparing for promotion tests. 
Restrictions on Group Study. Restrictions on group study and additional specific test 
compromise situations regarding promotion tests are briefly covered here. 
Discussing promotion test content with anyone other than the test control officer or test 
examiner is prohibited. Written inquiries or complaints about a test are handled by the test 
control officer. 
Sharing pretests or lists of test questions recalled from a current or previous promotion test; 
personal study materials; underlined or highlighted study reference material; and commercial 
study guides with other individuals is prohibited. 
Placing commercial study guide software on government computers is prohibited. While 
Airmen may use commercial study materials in preparation for promotion testing, the USAF 
does not recommend, endorse, or support commercial study guides. 
Creating, storing, or transferring personal study notes on government computers is prohibited. 
Government computers may only be used to view electronic versions of official study 
references.

9.12. Distribution of Enlisted Promotion Test Study References 
The Barnes Center for Enlisted Education, Air Force Career Development Academy is responsible 
for providing promotion eligible members access to WAPS Career Development Courses. They 
are 
available 
on-line 
at 
the 
USAF 
Enlisted 
Promotion 
Study 
Guides 
website 
(https://www.studyguides.af.mil/). The site is updated to coincide with release of the EPRRC. 
Study materials, such as instructions, manuals, or technical orders, are made available online at the 
Air Force Departmental Publishing Office website (https://www.e-publishing.af.mil/) or other 
approved repositories. Individuals may ask unit WAPS monitors to order study reference material 
listed in the catalog that is not locally available. According to DAFMAN 36-2664, promotion 
eligible Airmen must have access to reference materials at least 60 days before the scheduled test 
date. If not, the Airman may request a delay in testing.  
9.13. Promotion Eligibility Cutoff Date 
The promotion eligibility cutoff date (PECD) is used to determine Airman promotion eligibility as 
well as the cutoff date that will determine when contents of the selection folder and information 
on promotion evaluation briefs must be updated and complete. The PECD is the date that 
promotion criteria are considered for promotion, such as the data provided on the Data Verification 
Brief, that is used for promotion board evaluation consideration. For SNCOs, this information is 
then used to post the SNCO evaluation brief filed in the SNCO selection folder. 
Promotion Criteria. As the USAF continues to offer opportunities for career broadening and 
special duty assignments, it is important to mention that individuals with a reporting identifier or 
special duty identifier, designated as their control AFSC on the PECD, will compete within that 
reporting identifier or special duty identifier. Otherwise, Master Sergeants being considered for 
promotion to Senior Master Sergeant will compete for promotion in the superintendent level of the 
control AFSC they held as of the PECD. Likewise, Senior Master Sergeants being considered for 
promotion to Chief Master Sergeant will compete for promotion in the chief enlisted manager code 
of the control AFSC they held as of the PECD. 
9.14. Data Verification Record 
The Data Verification Record (DVR) is the document utilized for promotion consideration and is 
the most important tool to review to ensure information on a promotion record is complete. All 
eligible Airmen must review their DVR in the Automated Records Management System/Personnel 
Records Display Application (ARMS/PRDA). If an error or omission is noted, the Airman must 
immediately contact his or her military personnel flight for assistance. The military personnel flight 
will update the Military Personnel Data System with the correct data and update the DVR on virtual 
military personnel flight. Airmen should review the updated record to verify changes have been 
completed accurately. Data reflected on the DVR should not be confused with the Data Verification 
Brief or a Single Unit Retrieval Format, commonly referred to as SURF. 
Data Verification Record Review Steps:

9.15. Promotion Test Development 
Air Education and Training Command, Studies and Analysis Squadron, Airman Advancement 
Section, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, produces all USAF enlisted promotion tests, 
which are written by Airmen for Airmen. Teams of SNCOs travel to work in-house with test 
development specialists and apply their knowledge and expertise to develop current, relevant, and 
accurate test questions for enlisted promotion testing. At the beginning of a test development 
project, the most current tests are administered to the test development teams. This gives test 
writers the point of view of the test takers and helps them evaluate how the test content relates to 
performance in their specialties. Teams will also carefully check the references of each question 
for currency and accuracy. Only after this is accomplished do the teams begin developing new 
test questions. During test development, test development specialists provide psychometric and 
developmental expertise required to ensure the tests are credible, valid, and fair to all examinees. 
Promotion Fitness Examination. The Promotion Fitness Examinations (PFE) measure military 
and supervisory knowledge required of Staff Sergeants and Technical Sergeants. For the PFE, test 
development specialists select Chief Master Sergeants based on their extensive experience and 
major command representation to develop and validate questions. 
Specialty Knowledge Tests. Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) measure important job knowledge 
required in a particular specialty. For SKTs, test development specialists work closely with USAF 
career field managers to stay abreast of changes affecting career fields which may impact 
promotion test development. SNCOs, based on their specialties and job experiences, are selected 
to develop, and validate SKT questions. Resources used to develop SKTs include Career Field 
Education and Training Plans, occupational analysis data, and experiences to ensure test content 
is related to important tasks performed in the specialty. 
9.16. Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog 
Published annually on 1 October, the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog 
(EPRRC), lists all enlisted promotion tests authorized for administration and the study references 
associated with these tests. Every question on a promotion test comes from one of the publications 
listed in the EPRRC, and only publications used to support questions on a given promotion test 
are listed. The study references for the PFE are the grade-specific Enlisted Promotion Study Guides 
derived from AFH 1. The study references for SKTs are often a combination of Career 
Development Courses and technical references. Career Development Courses used as study 
references may be different from those issued for upgrade training. The catalog also contains 
administrative and special instructions for test control officers. The EPRRC is available at the 
USAF Enlisted Promotion Study Guides website (https://www.studyguides.af.mil/).  
9.17. Promotion Test Administration and Scoring 
Promotion tests are administered electronically to all Airmen competing for promotion to the 
grades of Staff Sergeant through Technical Sergeant. Test administration procedures are 
standardized to ensure fairness for all members competing for promotion. All promotion tests are 
electronically scored at HQ AETC SAS following thorough quality control steps to ensure 
accurate test results are recorded for each member. In some cases when a paper copy of the tests 
is administered, strict procedures are used for handling, storing, and transmitting paper copy test 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
178 
 
 
 
booklets and answer sheets at all times. These instances are the exception to electronic test 
administration and must be approved by the Air Force Personnel Center. For these tests, scanning 
and scoring process contains many safeguards to verify accuracy which is conducted at the Air 
Force Personnel Center. 
Test Scores. A minimum score of 40 points is required on a PFE. A minimum score of 40 points 
is required on a SKT. A combined score of 90 points is required. Airmen who score the minimum 
40 points on either exam (when taking both examinations) must score a minimum 50 on the other 
one to meet the minimum combined score of 90. For those testing PFE only, a minimum score of 
45 is required (combined score of 90 when doubled). 
9.18. Promotion Points 
Calculating points for promotion can be a somewhat complex, but not complicated process. The 
complete charts, to include exceptions and notes for calculating points and factors for promotion, 
are included in AFI 36-2502.

9.19. Promotion Evaluation Boards 
The promotion evaluation board is very important because it accounts for over half the total 
promotion score points. Understanding how board members are selected, the evaluation board 
process, and those areas considered by board members, can provide valuable insight into what is 
required to get promoted. 
Selection of Board Members. The number of promotion eligible personnel, identified by major 
commands and Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC), determines the career field backgrounds of 
board members. Board members are divided into panels, each consisting of one Colonel and two 
Chief Master Sergeants. The board president is always a General Officer. Before evaluating 
records, board members are briefed and sworn to complete the board’s task impartially. They also 
participate in an extensive trial-run process to ensure scoring consistency before evaluating any 
“live” records. 
9.20. Evaluation Board Process 
The evaluation board looks at several areas regarding an Airman’s career, which may include 
performance, education, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence, 
specific achievements, and leadership. A number of factors affect board scores from year to year— 
new panel members with different thought processes, changed or improved records, and a pool of 
new eligibles. As a result, board scores do vary (often significantly) from one board to the next. 
While scores will vary between panels, all records within a Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) Code 
or AFSC are evaluated under the same standard. The important aspect of a final board score is how 
one eligible compares to his or her peers in the final order of merit. Board members do not have 
access to the weighted scores of individuals competing for promotion. When board members 
disband, they do not know who was selected. 
Trial Run. Board members are given two selected sets of records to score as a practice exercise 
using secret ballots before the actual board scoring process begins. This trial run helps establish a 
scoring standard that can be applied consistently across the board. Each board arrives at their own 
scoring standard. Everyone competing in a CEM Code or AFSC is looked at under the same 
standard to ensure fair and equitable consideration is applied. 
Scoring. After the trial run is completed and discussed, panels begin the actual scoring of live 
records. The same panel evaluates all eligibles competing in a CEM Code or AFSC. Each panel 
member scores each record, using a 6- to 10-point scale and half-point increments. An individual’s 
record may receive a panel composite score (three members) from a minimum of 18 (6-6-6) to a 
maximum of 30 (10-10-10) points. The composite score (18 to 30 points) is later multiplied by a 
factor of 15, resulting in a total board score (270 to 450). Using a secret ballot, panel members 
score the record individually with no discussion. Records are given to each panel member, and 
after they are scored, the ballots are given directly to a recorder. This ensures each panel member 
has scored each record independently. 
Scoring Resolution. A record scored with a difference of more than one point between any of the 
panel members (for example, 8.5, 8.0, and 7.0) is termed a split vote and is returned to the panel 
for resolution. At this time, all panel members may discuss the record openly among themselves. 
This allows them to state why they scored the record as they did. Only those panel members 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
180 
 
 
 
directly involved in the split may change their scores. If panel members cannot come to an 
agreement on the split vote, they give the record to the board president for resolution. This ensures 
consistency of scoring and eliminates the possibility that one panel member will have a major 
impact (positive or negative) on an individual’s board score. 
Post-Board Processing. After the board is finished, the weighted factor scores are combined with 
the board scores. This completely electronic operation builds an order of merit listing by total score 
within each CEM Code or AFSC, and the overall promotion quota is then applied to each list. 
After the selection results are approved, the data is transmitted to the military personnel section. 
9.21. Promotion Score Notices 
Promotion score notices are a means to give Airmen a report of their relative standing in the 
promotion consideration process and should never be provided to or used by anyone other than the 
individual and his or her commander. An Airman’s scores cannot be disclosed without the 
Airman’s written consent. Commander’s support staffs, first sergeants, supervisors, etc., are not 
authorized access to promotion scores. The commander has the specific duty to notify Airmen of 
promotion selection or non-selection results and may need to review their score notices to 
determine status. Commanders must restrict their use of the scores to notification and advisory 
counseling on behalf of the Airmen and must not allow further dissemination of scores. 
Individuals may retrieve a copy of their score notice on the virtual military personnel flight after 
the initial promotion selection for the current cycle. Individuals can also compare their scores with 
the promotion statistics available in the military personnel flight or posted on the virtual military 
personnel flight through the Air Force Personnel Center 
(https://www.afpc.af.mil/Promotion/Enlisted-Promotions/).

10.1.  Assignment Eligibility and Restrictions 
The USAF classifies and assigns Airmen worldwide to ensure a high state of readiness to 
accomplish the mission. The Air Force uses a coherent and logical classification system to identify 
valid manpower requirements, to identify and describe each USAF occupational specialty, to 
ensure minimum prerequisite standards are set for each specialty, and to ensure qualified Airmen 
are placed into each specialty. The Air Force also recognizes the importance of special assignment 
considerations for Airmen with exceptional needs. To the maximum extent possible, the USAF 
assigns a permanent change of station (PCS) to Airmen on a voluntary basis. When required, the 
USAF distributes involuntary assignments among similarly qualified Airmen to minimize family 
separation or allow Airmen to tend to essential military and personal responsibilities. Air Force 
Reserve assignment may be full-time or part-time, and are all voluntary, thus new assignments 
must be applied for, particularly when pursuing promotion opportunities. 
10.2. Assignment Authority 
Airmen assignments are filled to meet the overall needs of the USAF according to law, Department 
of Defense, and instructional guidance. The Department of Defense allocates funds, delegates 
authority, and directs policies for the PCS assignments of Airmen to satisfy national security 
requirements. The director of assignments (or equivalent), in coordination with major commands, 
field operating agencies, and direct reporting units, is authorized to initiate assignments for Airmen 
to fill valid vacant manpower authorizations. The Air Force Personnel Center is the final approval 
authority for assignments in the grades of Senior Master Sergeant and below. The Air Force 
Executive Talent Management Office is the final approval authority for Chief Master Sergeant and 
Chief Master Sergeant-select assignments. DAFI 36-2110, Total Force Assignments, is the 
governing instruction for operational (including rotational), training (including formal education 
and professional military education), and force structure assignments. 
10.3. Assignment Cancellations 
Once an Airman is selected for a PCS and orders are published, assignments are not normally 
cancelled within 60 days of the projected departure date unless the Airman cannot be effectively 
used at the projected location. If the Airman indicates an assignment cancellation will cause 
hardship, the Airman will be asked to prepare a written statement to be coordinated through the 
unit commander to the military personnel section. Upon receipt, the military personnel section 
advises the assignment office of primary responsibility to either consider reinstatement of the 
original assignment, provide an alternate assignment, or confirm cancellation with reasons why 
the Airman is required to remain at the present base. 
10.4. Factors for Distribution of Personnel 
While the primary factor in selecting Airmen for a PCS is the Airman’s qualifications to fill a valid 
manpower requirement and perform productively in the position, many additional aspects may be 
considered for eligibility criteria as well. 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
182 
 
 
 
Special Experience Identifier. The special experience identifier system complements the 
assignment process and is used in conjunction with grade, AFSC, and AFSC prefixes and suffixes, 
to match uniquely qualified Airmen to jobs with special requirements. Special experience 
identifiers may be used when specific experience or training is critical, and no other means is 
appropriate or available. Manpower positions are coded with a special experience identifier to 
identify positions that require or provide unique experiences or qualifications. The personnel 
records for Airmen who earn a special experience identifier are similarly coded to rapidly identify 
Airmen to meet unique circumstances, contingency requirements, or other critical needs. 
Security Access Requirement. Some positions require Airmen to have access to a specified level 
of classified information. However, sometimes the urgency to fill a position does not allow 
selection of Airmen using PCS eligibility criteria, subsequent processing, or investigation for 
access at the specified level. Under these circumstances, selection may be necessary from among 
Airmen who currently have access or can be granted access immediately. 
Grade, Air Force Specialty Code, and Skill-Level Relationship for Assignment. Normally, 
Airmen in the grade of Senior Master Sergeant and below are selected for assignment in their 
control AFSC based on their grade and skill level. Airmen with an incompatible grade and control 
AFSC skill level due to retraining or reclassification are selected for assignment and allocated 
against requirements commensurate with their grade, regardless of their control AFSC skill level. 
Chief Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeant-selects may be assigned in any AFSC or chief 
enlisted manager code they possess or are qualified to be awarded. Primarily, Chief Master 
Sergeants fill chief enlisted manager code positions; Senior Master Sergeants fill 9-skill level 
positions; Master Sergeants and Technical Sergeants fill 7-skill level positions; Staff Sergeants 
and Senior Airmen fill 5-skill level positions; and Airman First Class, Airman, and Airman Basic 
fill 3-skill level positions. 
Volunteer Status and Assignment Eligibility. Qualified volunteers should be considered for all 
assignments. Volunteers who have not met time on station requirements may be considered before 
qualified non-volunteers who have met time on station requirements, but such a qualified 
volunteer requires a time on station waiver. A qualified volunteer who meets the minimum time 
on station requirement is considered first, based on the order of longest on station. Note: First-
term Airmen serving an initial enlistment of four or more years may not be given more than two 
assignments in different locations following initial basic and skill training during their first four 
years of service, regardless of tour length. First-term Airmen who make two PCS moves are 
permitted an additional PCS in conjunction with an approved humanitarian reassignment, a join 
spouse assignment, as a volunteer, or when the PCS is a mandatory move. Low-cost moves are 
excluded from the two-move count. 
Base of Preference (Enlisted Only). The first-term Airmen and career Airmen may request a base 
of preference assignment as an incentive for continued USAF service. First-term Airmen, in 
conjunction with reenlistment or retraining, may request a PCS from Continental United States 
(CONUS) to CONUS or PCS from overseas to CONUS. Also, first-term Airmen in CONUS may 
request a base of preference to remain in place. A PCS base of preference is not authorized from 
CONUS to overseas or overseas to overseas. An in-place base of preference is not authorized for 
Airmen assigned overseas. 
Assignment of Military Couples (Join Spouse). Each Airman of a military couple serves in his 
or her own right. Military couples must fulfill the obligations inherent to all Airmen. They are 
considered for assignments to fill valid manning requirements and must perform duties that require 
the skills in which they are trained. Provided these criteria are met, military couples may be 
considered for assignments where they can maintain a joint residence. Military couples should not 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
183 
 
 
 
make decisions on future service, career development, or family planning based on the assumption 
they will always be assigned to the same location or that join spouse assignment is guaranteed. 
Home-Basing and Follow-On Assignment Programs. The purpose of the home-basing and 
follow-on assignment programs is to reduce PCS costs, reduce PCS turbulence, and increase 
stability for Airmen and their families by providing advance assignment consideration. The 
servicing military personnel section must brief all eligible Airmen selected for or electing to serve 
an unaccompanied overseas tour of 15 months or less on these programs. Airmen must either apply 
or decline to apply for these programs in writing. 
Assignment of Family Members. Assignment of family members to the same duty location or 
unit is not prohibited; however, family members will not be assigned where one family member 
will or may hold a command or supervisory position over another family member. Such 
assignments result in, or may create a perception of, preferential treatment or loss of impartiality, 
thereby compromising the integrity of command and supervisory functions. 
Voluntary Stabilized Base Assignment Program (Enlisted Only). The voluntary stabilized base 
assignment program provides Airmen a stabilized tour in exchange for volunteering for an 
assignment to a historically hard-to-fill location. 
Extended Long Overseas Tour Length. The extended long overseas tour volunteer program 
applies to Airmen who volunteer for a PCS overseas to a long-tour location (accompanied tour 
length is 24 months or more and unaccompanied tour length is more than 15 months). Airmen who 
volunteer for an extended long overseas tour agree to serve the standard tour length plus an 
additional 12 months. The 12-month extended tour period is in addition to the normal 
(accompanied or unaccompanied) long tour length. A change in status affects the service 
retainability that must be obtained and the tour length the Airman will be required to serve. The 
requirement for additional service retainability may force an Airman to extend or reenlist and 
could affect selective retention bonus calculation. Extended long overseas tour volunteers are 
considered ahead of standard overseas tour volunteers according to established USAF priorities. 
Temporary Duty. The maximum temporary duty period at any one location in a 12-month period 
is 180 days unless the Secretary of the Air Force grants a waiver. To the degree possible, Airmen 
are not selected for involuntary overseas assignment while performing certain kinds of temporary 
duty. If selected, the report no later than date will not be within 120 days of the temporary duty 
completion date. 
10.5. Service Retainability 
Upon selection for assignment, an Airman must have or be able to obtain certain minimum periods 
of obligated service depending on the type of PCS move. This committed service retainability 
ensures an Airman has a period of RegAF status remaining long enough to offset the costs 
associated with a PCS. Airmen who do not have retainability may decline to obtain retainability 
or, if eligible, may retire instead of accepting a PCS. Declining to obtain retainability will affect a 
career Airman by making him or her ineligible for promotion and reenlistment. 
Consecutive Overseas Tour. If an Airman is serving overseas and is a volunteer for a consecutive 
overseas tour or in-place consecutive overseas tour, the Airman must complete the full-prescribed 
tour at the current location and the full-prescribed overseas tour at the new location or another full 
tour in place. 
Dependent Accompanied Overseas. Airmen who are eligible and desire that their dependents 
accompany them at government expense during overseas tours, must serve the “accompanied by 
dependents” overseas tour length. This tour is normally longer than the unaccompanied tour. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
184 
 
 
 
Electing to serve the longer accompanied tour requires the Airman to obtain the obligated service 
retainability for the longer tour. Airmen who are either ineligible or decline to obtain the service 
retainability for the accompanied tour length will not receive approval for dependent travel at the 
government’s expense or command sponsorship. 
Overseas to Continental United States. Reassignment from overseas to CONUS requires an 
Airman, in most cases, to have or obtain at least 12 months of obligated service retainability. Those 
Airmen serving overseas who fail to obtain the necessary retainability for reassignment to the 
CONUS will be retained in the overseas area until their date of separation. 
Continental United States to Continental United States. The service retainability requirement 
for a CONUS to CONUS PCS is 24 months regardless of career status. 
10.6. Time on Station Requirements 
Minimum time on station requirements exist to provide continuity to an organization and 
reasonable periods of stable family life for Airmen. For most PCS moves within the CONUS, first- 
term Airmen and career Airmen must have at least 48 months of time on station, with the exception 
of eligible first-term Airmen applying for the first-term Airmen base of preference program. First- 
term Airmen must have at least 12 months of time on station to go from CONUS to overseas. 
Career Airmen require 24 months of time on station before an overseas PCS. 
10.7. Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing 
The Enlisted Quarterly Assignment Listing (EQUAL) provides Airmen a listing of the assignment 
requirements available for upcoming assignment cycles and allows them the opportunity to align 
personal preferences to actual USAF needs. The listing identifies what assignments, by AFSC and 
grade, are available at particular locations. EQUAL-Plus is used to advertise requirements for 
special duty, joint and departmental, short-notice overseas, and all Chief Master Sergeant 
assignments. EQUAL-Plus shows upcoming requirements, special qualifications needed, 
available locations, reporting instructions, and points of contact for additional information. Note: 
Each Airman is individually responsible for the currency and accuracy of assignment preferences. 
When a change in preference or status occurs, career progression or marriage, Airmen assignment 
preferences should be updated accordingly. 
10.8. Chief Master Sergeant Development 
The Chiefs’ Group uses Chief Master Sergeant assignment policies to support the continued 
development of Chief Master Sergeants. Although these assignment policies are comparable with 
other senior leader assignments and development methods, they are managed differently than other 
enlisted grades. Additional information can be found on the USAF Portal, the Senior Leader Career 
Management System Guide, and the Chief Master Sergeant Information Handbook. 
10.9. Deferments 
Deferments may be authorized in most grades and AFSCs to maintain an equitable assignment 
system and also support the need for stability in certain organizations or functions. Deferments are 
normally approved to preclude an Airman’s PCS while suitability to remain on RegAF status is 
evaluated or during a period of observation or rehabilitation. Deferments also exist for such things 
as completion of an educational program or degree, witness for a court-martial, accused in a court- 
martial, control roster, Article 15 punishment, base of preference program, retraining, or 
humanitarian reasons. 
Humanitarian Reassignment or Deferment. Humanitarian reassignments or deferments help 
Airmen resolve severe short-term problems involving a family member. The problem must be 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
185 
 
 
 
resolvable within a reasonable period of time (normally 12 months); the Airman’s presence must 
be considered absolutely essential to resolve the problem; and the Airman must be effectively 
utilized in his or her control AFSC at the new assignment. Family members under the humanitarian 
program are limited to spouse, children, parents, parents-in-law, and those people who have served 
“in loco parentis.” A person “in loco parentis” refers to someone who has exercised parental rights 
and responsibilities in place of a natural parent for at least five years before the Airman’s or 
spouse’s 21st birthday, or before the Airman’s entry to the RegAF, whichever is earlier. While 
brothers and sisters are not included in the definition of family member for humanitarian 
consideration, a request involving a brother’s or sister’s terminal illness will be considered as an 
exception to policy. 
Exceptional Family Member Program Reassignment or Deferment. The Exceptional Family 
Member Program (EFMP) is based on an Airman’s need for special medical or educational care 
for a spouse or child that is required long-term or permanent. This program is not a base-of-choice 
program. Assignment decisions are based on manning needs of the USAF at locations where the 
special medical or educational needs for a spouse or child can be met. The USAF’s commitment 
and responsibilities under the EFMP requires mandatory enrollment and identification of 
exceptional family members. Under the EFMP, an Airman may receive a reassignment if a need 
arises for specialized care that cannot be met where currently assigned. A deferment from an 
assignment may be provided for a newly identified condition if the Airman’s presence is 
considered essential. The purpose of such a deferment is to allow the Airman time to establish a 
special medical treatment program or educational program for the exceptional family member. 
When granted, the initial period of deferment is usually 12 months, after which an Airman may be 
reconsidered for a PCS, if otherwise eligible. 
Educational Deferment. Airmen who have not yet been selected for a PCS may request deferment 
from assignment selection when they have nearly completed a vocational program or college 
degree requirements. 
High School Senior Assignment Deferment Program. Senior Master Sergeants and below, and 
officers up through Lieutenant Colonel, may apply for a one-year assignment deferment to 
accommodate dependent graduations from high school. Back to back deferments may be possible, 
and military married to military spouses may also apply. As in all situations, however, the needs 
of the USAF will come first and will be the determining factor in granting deferments. Requests 
will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and deferments will be approved where possible. 
Dependent Care and Adoption Deferment. All Airmen ensure dependent care arrangements are 
made in the event of temporary duty or PCS. Military couples with dependents and single Airmen 
sponsors are expected to fulfill their military obligations on the same basis as other Airmen. They 
are eligible for worldwide duty and all assignments for which they qualify. To ensure all Airmen 
remain available for worldwide duty, they must have workable plans to provide parent-like care 
for their dependents as outlined in DoDI1342.19_DAFI36-2908, Family Care Plans. Airmen who 
cannot or will not meet military commitments due to family needs will be considered for 
discharge. Airmen adopting children are given a limited time to complete the official adoption 
process and facilitate bonding. Airmen may be authorized deferment during the six-month period 
following the date a child is officially placed in the Airmen’s home. Airmen may also be authorized 
up to 21 days of permissive temporary duty to be used in conjunction with ordinary leave. 
 
10.10. Expedited Transfers 
The Air Force offers expedited transfers to eligible Airmen who file an unrestricted report for 
sexual assault, stalking, or other sexual misconduct (i.e., indecent viewing, visual recording, or 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
186 
 
 
 
broadcasting; forcible pandering; indecent exposure) with assistance from the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Response Office, the Family Advocacy Program Office, the Victim and Witness 
Assistance Program in the installation’s Legal Office, or their commander. The Air Force offers 
expedited transfers to Airmen whose adult military dependent makes an allegation of non-domestic 
abuse sexual assault with the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office if the victim has 
filed an unrestricted report and the alleged sexual assault offender is a service member or if the 
alleged offender or alleged sexual assault has a military nexus (e.g., adult military dependent, 
works for DoD as a civilian employee (appropriated and non-appropriated fund employees, or is a 
government contractor)), or the alleged sexual assault occurred on a DoD installation or facility. 
The Air Force also offers expedited transfers to eligible Airmen who are victims of physical 
domestic violence committed by the spouse or intimate partner of the victim. Airmen may request 
an expedited transfer with assistance from the installation Family Advocacy Program Office, 
Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, the Victim and Witness Assistance Program in 
the installation’s Legal Office, or their commander. 
To enhance protection for the sexual assault victim, potential reassignment of the alleged offender 
shall be considered by the vice wing commander (or equivalent), balancing interests of the sexual 
assault victim and the alleged offender. An Airman (victim or alleged offender) will generally only 
be delayed from departing for a PCS when they are required to remain for completion of a criminal 
or disciplinary investigation or action in which they are the subject. All assignment action codes 
must be removed from the Airman’s personnel file to facilitate PCS eligibility. Retraining or cross-
flow actions will be considered under this program on a case-by-case basis as the goal for 
transferring the Airman is to process a timely reassignment with minimal disruption to an Airman’s 
career and family.

10.12. Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) 
The AFECD is the official guide to the USAF enlisted classification codes, and the Air Force 
Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD) is the official guide to the USAF officer classification 
codes. Both directories serve very similar purposes. The AFECD establishes the occupational 
structure of the enlisted force, primarily for use by personnel officials and agencies engaged in 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
188 
 
 
 
procurement, classification, and training of USAF members in a manner that permits enlisted 
personnel to specialize and develop their skills and abilities while allowing the USAF to meet 
changing mission requirements. The AFECD is organized in numerical/alphabetical order 
according to career field and AFSC. Each career field is described in the AFECD, followed by a 
breakdown of each AFSC within that career field. Career fields are classified in the following 
manner: Operations (1X), Logistics (2X), Support (3X), Medical (4X), Paralegal and Religious 
Affairs (5X), Contracting and Financial (6X), Special Investigations (7X), Special Duty Identifiers 
(8X), and Reporting Identifiers (9X). Note: Reporting Identifiers (9X) identify authorizations and 
individual enlisted Airmen who are not identifiable in the classification structure and for whom 
specialty descriptions are not written, as provided in the AFECD.

11.1.  Programs, Benefits, and Services 
The USAF requires military members to be prepared to serve and support the mission at all times. 
To do this, there are a wide range of benefits and services to ensure military members and families 
are cared for, whether through pay and entitlements processes, family support programs, or secured 
military records. Throughout our careers, we as Airmen need to understand the benefits and 
services applicable to ourselves, as well as to subordinates, peers, and leaders in our chain of

preparedness by working with a wide range of civilian and military agencies. M&FRCs provide 
support for work/life issues and facilitate community readiness, resilience, and personal 
preparedness. Services offered by the M&FRC are briefly described here. 
Personal and Work Life Program. The Personal and Work Life Program promotes community 
wellness and assists with the readiness and resiliency of the force. Services include intervention, 
prevention/enrichment consultation, and skill building education designed to enhance work-life 
competencies for individuals, couples, and families. Focus is on promotion, enrichment, and 
improvement of the balance between work and home to increase quality of life and resilience. 
Commander’s Key Support Program (CKSP). The CKSP is an official unit family readiness 
program designed to enhance readiness and establish a sense of community. This Commander’s 
program promotes partnerships with the unit, the M&FRC, and community agencies.

Military and Family Readiness Centers (M&FRC)—Transition Assistance Program. The 
Transition Assistance Program (TAP) is congressionally mandated and executed by the M&FRC 
to provide Service members with the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions, be 
competitive in a global workforce, and be positive contributors to their community as they 
transition and reintegrate into civilian life. TAP has multiple components which must be 
completed prior to separation, retirement, or release from active duty: Individualized Initial 
Counseling, Pre-separation Counseling both required to be completed No Later Than (NLT) 365 
days prior to separation, retirement, or release from active duty. Core Curriculum which includes 
DoD Day, Department of Labor Employment Fundamentals of Career Training and Veterans 
Affairs Benefits and Services workshops, at least one 2-day track from the following options: 
Employment, Education, Vocational, or Entrepreneurship and Capstone NLT 90 days prior to 
separation, retirement, or release from active duty which includes verification of transition plan 
and applicable required Career Readiness Standard deliverables. 
Volunteer Resources. The Volunteer Resources Program collaborates with other base agencies 
for the purpose of referring Airmen, Guardians, spouses, and other family members for volunteer 
opportunities. Through this program, volunteers may be recognized by the Air Force Volunteer 
Excellence Award (VEA), a Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) level award. The VEA is a 
commander’s program to recognize volunteer contributions in the local civilian community or 
military family community. 
Military Family Life Counselors. The Department of Defense-contracted Military Family Life 
Counselor Program provides Airmen and their dependents with confidential assistance for non- 
medical, short-term, solution focused counseling and briefings that augment counseling services 
provided by other agencies. 
Exceptional Family Member Program. The Exceptional Family Member Program provides 
coordination of family support services on and off the installation to exceptional family members 
who have physical, developmental, emotional, or intellectual impairments or disabilities. Three 
components of support are medical, assignments, and family. 
Air Force Families Forever. Air Force Families Forever facilitates long-term case management 
procedures and provides support for surviving family members of deceased Regular Air Force, 
U.S. Space Force, and Air Reserve Component, Airmen, and Guardians who died in an Active 
Duty, Inactive Duty for Training, or Annual Training status and whose relationship was 
established prior to the Airman/Guardian’s death. 
Voting Assistance Program. The Voting Assistance Program ensures service members and their 
families understand their right to vote via absentee ballot. M&FRC staff operate the Installation 
Voter Assistance Office and serve as Voting Assistance Officers, responsible for providing 
accurate nonpartisan voting information and assistance. More information about the Voting 
Assistance Program can be found in DAFI 36-3107, Voting Assistance Program. 
Deployment Briefings. Personnel and family readiness pre-deployment briefings are mandatory 
for individuals with a firm deployment tasking of 30 or more days. The briefings educate Airmen, 
Guardians, and their families on all phases of deployment and critical aspects of reunion and 
reintegration. Spouses are welcome and encouraged to attend. The briefings include information 
on preparing for deployment; sustainment, support, and services for family members including 
extended family; and mandatory reintegration briefings and continuing services that help Airmen 
and Guardians prepare for reuniting with their families, friends, and communities, and for 
handling combat stressors. 
Employment Assistance. Employment assistance supports Airmen and their families in achieving 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
204 
 
 
 
short- and long-term employment, referral for education and training, and development of career 
goals through employment skills counseling and skills development workshops to prepare 
customers for careers in the private and public sectors. They also offer resources for self- 
employment, information on small business and entrepreneurial opportunities, and links to 
alternatives to paid employment, such as volunteerism and education. 
Personal Financial Readiness Services. Personal financial readiness is an M&FRC program that 
offers information, education, and personal financial counseling to help individuals and families 
maintain financial stability and reach their financial goals. The program provides education to all 
personnel throughout the entire military life cycle. Mandatory financial readiness training is 
offered through the M&FRC by certified financial counselors. In addition to the mandatory 
training, Airmen and Guardians and their families can also learn financial basics such as 
budgeting, credit, large purchases, state or country liability laws, and local fraudulent business 
practices. Personal financial readiness services are free. 
Military Child Education. Civilian and military school liaison officers partner to provide 
information, referrals, resources, and advocacy for the educational needs of military-connected 
students by assisting Airmen and families regarding local school districts and other educational 
options, as well as educating school personnel on the unique issues impacting military children. 
Relocation Assistance. Relocation assistance provides pre-departure and post-arrival services, 
allowing members to make informed decisions and preparations for their moves. Referrals will 
include, but are not limited to temporary housing services, government or private home finding 
services, child care, medically-related services, spouse employment assistance, cultural and 
community orientation, schooling, legal assistance, personal property shipment, and information 
on educational and volunteer opportunities. 
Crisis Support. Crisis support provides immediate, short-term information and referral to 
appropriate agencies or services to assist individuals and families facing crisis situations with 
support to the community before, during and after disaster, crisis, and or evacuation situations. 
Casualty Assistance. Casualty Assistance Representatives (CAR) and survivor benefit plan 
counselors provide assistance and counseling on benefits offered by a wide variety of programs 
from the Department of the Air Force, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security 
Administration, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Health and Human Services, as well as 
state and local agencies. When a casualty occurs, the USAF will promptly notify the Primary Next 
of Kin (PNOK) and other named beneficiaries as appropriate based on a member’s casualty status, 
in a dignified, professional, and timely manner. Additionally, in cases where the military member 
is declared deceased, Duty Status Whereabouts Unknown (DUSTWUN), or missing, the USAF 
appoints a CAR to advise and assist the PNOK and beneficiaries you have identified. The CAR 
assists to meet very important timelines, such as delivering notifications within 12 hours of a 
casualty. Therefore, when an Airman’s Record of Emergency Data (RED) is current and has up-
to-date information, NOK and beneficiaries receive timely notifications. As a result, the RED and 
the Servicemembers’ Online Election System (SOES) mentioned below are critically important 
for each Airman to understand, review, verify, and certify that they are up-to-date at least once a 
year or when a beneficiary’s information changes. 
Emergency Data (DD Form 93). Record of emergency data (RED) maintained initially on the 
DD Form 93 and ultimately input into the virtual record of emergency data (vRED) via vMPF 
enables Airmen to list those they wish to be notified should they become ill, injured, wounded, 
missing or deceased. Additionally, Airmen determine beneficiaries of Death Gratuity, Arrears of 
Pay, and designate the Person Authorized to Direct Disposition (PADD) of their remains. To 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
205 
 
 
 
update your vRED, log into vMPF: Select ‘Personal Data’ and then select ‘Record of Emergency 
Data.’ Service members are responsible for entering information, reviewing/submitting annually, 
or updating their vRED when there are life-changing events such as marriage, divorce, births, 
before deployments, TDYs more than 30 days, and PCS. For more information go to myFSS and 
search, “Record of Emergency Data Associated Benefits.” Note: There is no requirement for the 
PADD to be related to the deceased, however, the person you select to be the PADD should be 
aware of your wishes and that person should understand that they will be required to make 
decisions about what to do with your remains after death (embalming, funeral services, cremation, 
burial, etc.). 
Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Online Enrollment System (SOES). SOES is an 
enterprise solution developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Veteran Benefits 
Administration. SOES is a self-service based data system that centralizes Servicemembers’ Group 
Life Insurance (SGLI) and Family Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (FSGLI) information 
into one authoritative system capable of providing consistent information to authorized users. 
SGLI provides up to $500,000 in life insurance coverage; FSGLI provides up to $100,000 in 
coverage for the spouse and $10,000 for dependent children. Service members can use the system 
to change the amount of SGLI or FSGLI coverage. You can view, save, print, or email a SGLI 
coverage certificate. SOES Enables Airmen to make automated SGLI and FSGLI 
coverage/beneficiary elections 24/7/365. Note: Airmen married to other Airmen (military-to-
military) who have not updated DEERS with their spouse’s information will not be able to properly 
certify their SOES Record. Airmen meeting this criteria must go to their MPF’s Customer Service 
Element or the nearest RAPIDS station to add their spouse as a dependent. Please note hard copy 
(SGLV Form 8286, Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Election and Certificate) SGLI 
elections remain valid until superseded by a SOES election. For more information go to myFSS 
Knowledge Article and search Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance, Veterans’ Group Life 
Insurance or simply log into SOES via milConnect. 
Emergency Assistance. When directed by the installation commander, emergency assistance will 
be provided through the Emergency Family Assistance Center. Emergency assistance provides 
continuous, authoritative, family assistance and services for servicemembers, families, service 
providers, leadership, and other stakeholders, which address the practical and emotional needs of 
families arising from the incident., 
Legal Services. Legal offices provide legal assistance in connection with personal civil legal 
matters to support and sustain command effectiveness and readiness. The ability to offer legal 
assistance and legal services to the eligible categories of personnel is contingent upon the 
availability of legal staff resources and regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the 
Air Force. Legal services are not performed by or within M&FRCs, this is performed by Office 
of the Staff Judge Advocate on the installation. 
11.4. Warrior Wellness 
Air Force Wounded Warrior Program. The Air Force Wounded Warrior (AFW2) program 
(https://www.woundedwarrior.af.mil/) is a congressionally mandated, federally funded program 
that provides personalized care, services, and advocacy to seriously or very seriously wounded, 
ill, or injured Total Force Airmen/Guardians, their caregivers, and family members. AFW2 also 
provides the following support activities: Emergency Family Member Travel, Family Liaison 
Officer Program, Caregiver Support Program, Adaptive Sports & Resiliency Programs, Special 
Compensation for Assistance with Activities of Daily Living, Recovering Airman Mentorship 
Program, Empowerment to Employment, Community Programs, and the Ambassador Program. 
Anyone may refer an Airman or Guardian to the AFW2 Program by clicking the “Refer an 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

Airman/Guardian” at the top of the program’s website opening page.  
11.5. Family Care Plans 
According to AFI 1-1, the USAF must have people in the right place at the right time, ready to 
perform the jobs for which they have been trained. Unless specifically deferred or exempted, all 
USAF members must be available to perform military duties and assignments, including but not 
limited to, permanent change of station or assignment, unaccompanied tours, temporary duty, 
deployments, alerts, recalls, extended hours, or shift work. Single-member parents with custody 
of children who bear sole or joint responsibility, and military couples with dependents, must have 
a family care plan. Members who are solely responsible for the care of a spouse, elderly family 
member, or adult family member with disabilities who is dependent on the member for financial, 
medical, or logistical support, must also have a family care plan. This includes family members 
who have limited command of the English language, are unable to drive, or unable to gain access 
to basic life-sustaining facilities. Suitable arrangements must be planned in advance for a 
nonmilitary member to assume custody of dependents in the event the military member is 
unavailable to provide dependent care due to military obligations. 
Family Care Arrangements. Each USAF member must make and maintain dependent care 
arrangements that will allow the member to be world-wide deployable at all times. Advance 
planning is the key to dependent care arrangements. Every USAF member with dependents must 
take the initiative to use all available military and civilian resources, including other-than- 
immediate family members, to ensure dependents receive adequate care, support, and supervision 
that is compatible with the member’s military duties. Dependent care plans must cover all possible 
situations in the short- and long-term and must be sufficiently detailed and systematic for a 
smooth, rapid transfer of responsibilities to another individual during the absence of the military 
sponsor. 
Family Care Certification. Commanders or first sergeants counsel all Airmen with family 
members on DoDI1342.19_DAFI36-2908, during inprocessing. During this counseling, 
commanders or first sergeants must stress the importance of, and confirm the need for, family care 
certification by completing DAF Form 357, Family Care Certification. Also, commanders or first 
sergeants are required to annually brief all military members with family care responsibilities, 
individually. During this briefing, the commander or first sergeant signs the AF Form 357 each 
time the plan is reviewed and certified, determining the actual workability of the family care plan. 
The member signs and dates the DAF Form 357 to document that the briefing was completed. In 
the event of geographical separation, commanders may delegate responsibility, in writing, to 
detachment and operating location chiefs to counsel members and certify the form. The original 
signed DAF Form 357 will be filed with the member’s administrative office and a copy will be 
sent to the commander for review and filing. 
Family Care Plan Changes. Members must notify their commander or first sergeant 
immediately, or within 30 days (60 days for Selected Reserve) if changes in personal status or 
family circumstances require completion of an DAF Form 357. Specific circumstances that may 
warrant development of a family care plan are provided in DoDI1342.19_DAFI36-2908. Note: 
Failure to produce a family care plan within 60 days of the discussion with the commander, 
supervisor, or commander’s designated representative may result in disciplinary action or 
administrative separation. Duty deferments, primarily for a four-month period, when applicable, 
are offered to assist USAF military members in developing family care plans and establishing a 
pattern of childcare. DoDI1342.19_DAFI36-2908 provides more detailed information regarding 
duty deferments and to whom they may apply.

11.6. Veterans Affairs Benefits 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers a wide range of benefits to the nation’s veterans, 
service members, and their families. VA benefits and services fall into the major categories of 
disability benefits, education benefits, vocational rehabilitation and employment, home loans, 
burial benefits, dependents’ and survivors’ benefits, life insurance, and health care. Airmen 
requiring specific information on their VA benefits can retrieve information at: www.va.gov or 
contact the closest VA department for eligibility requirements. 
Disability Compensation. Disability compensation is a tax-free monetary benefit paid to veterans 
with disabilities that are the result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during RegAF 
military service. Compensation may be paid for post-service disabilities that are considered related 
or secondary to disabilities occurring in service and for disabilities presumed to be related to 
circumstances of military service, even though they may arise after service. The degree of 
disability is designed to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or 
illnesses. The benefit amount is graduated according to the degree of the veteran's disability on a 
scale from 10 percent to 100 percent (in increments of 10 percent). If you have dependents, an 
additional allowance may be added if your combined disability is rated 30 percent or greater. 
Compensation may be offset if you receive military retirement pay, disability severance pay, or 
separation incentive payments. 
Educational Benefits. The VA offers a variety of educational benefits to service members and 
veterans to pursue a higher education during or following their service. Benefit programs include 
the Post-9/11 GI Bill, Montgomery GI Bill, Reserve Educational Assistance Program, and 
Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance. The Yellow Ribbon GI Education 
Enhancement Program is a provision of the Public Law 110-252, Post-9/11 Veterans Educational 
Assistance Act of 2008. 
Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment. Airmen may receive services to help with job 
training, employment accommodations, resume development, and job seeking skills coaching 
through the VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program. Additional services may be 
provided to assist veterans in starting their own businesses or independent living services for those 
who are severely disabled and unable to work in traditional employment. 
Home Loans. The VA helps service members, veterans, and eligible surviving spouses become 
homeowners by providing a home loan guaranty benefit and other housing-related programs to 
help Airmen buy, build, repair, retain, or adapt a home for their own personal occupancy. VA 
home loans are provided by private lenders, such as banks and mortgage companies. VA 
guarantees a portion of the loan, enabling the lender to provide you with more favorable terms. 
Burial Benefits. The VA National Cemetery Administration operates 155 national cemeteries 
providing burial space for eligible Active-Duty, Retirees, Veterans, and eligible dependents. 
Burial benefits include gravesite, opening and closing of grave, perpetual care, and a government 
headstone or marker at no cost or obligation to the family. In addition, a burial flag and 
presidential memorial certificate may be given at no cost or obligation after submitting a 
completed application to the VA.  
Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. Dependency and indemnity compensation is a tax- 
free monetary benefit generally payable to a surviving spouse, child, or parent of service members, 
or to survivors of veterans who died from their service-connected disabilities. Dependency and 
indemnity compensation is an income-based benefit for parents who were financially dependent 
on a service member or veteran who died from a service-related cause. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
208 
 
 
 
Life Insurance. The VA provides valuable life insurance benefits to give service members and 
veterans the peace of mind that comes with knowing their family is protected. The VA life 
insurance programs were developed to provide financial security for service member families 
given the extraordinary risks involved in military service. 
11.7. Veterans’ Health Administration 
The transition from receiving care within the military healthcare system into the Veterans Health 
Administration can be challenging and sometimes confusing. Military health care, known as 
TRICARE, is operated through the Department of Defense and provides medical care for service 
members and their dependents. The Veterans Health Administration provides health care for 
enrolled veterans and their eligible family members through a network of hospitals and clinics 
across the country. TRICARE and the Veterans Health Administration work together, but have 
different eligibility criteria, health benefits, and costs. 
TRICARE Program. TRICARE is the worldwide health care program serving uniformed service 
members and retirees, their family members, survivors, and some former spouses entitled to 
TRICARE benefits. TRICARE programs are also available to Air Reserve Component members 
and their families. TRICARE is a force multiplier for the military health system that fills gaps in 
military health care using networks of civilian health care professionals, facilities, pharmacies, and 
suppliers. These civilian networks help enable the Department of Defense to provide beneficiaries 
with access to high-quality health care services even while uniformed medics are serving abroad 
in contingency operations. TRICARE is available in the United States and overseas. Each 
TRICARE region has a managed care support contractor that administers and coordinates health 
care services with network and non-network civilian hospitals and providers. Comprehensive, 
current information on TRICARE plans and programs can be found at the TRICARE website 
(https://www.tricare.mil/).  
TRICARE Plans. Several TRICARE health plan options are available to eligible beneficiaries. 
The primary health care options offered to eligible beneficiaries are TRICARE Prime and 
TRICARE Select. Availability of the plans depends on the sponsor’s military status and residence. 
Variations of TRICARE Prime are available, such as TRICARE Prime Remote, TRICARE Prime 
Overseas, and TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas. Variations of TRICARE Select are available, 
such as TRICARE Select and TRICARE Select Overseas. Additional plans available include 
TRICARE For Life, TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, TRICARE Young 
Adult, and U.S. Family Health Plan. The TRICARE plan finder can be used to determine the best 
plan available (https://www.tricare.mil/Plans/PlanFinder). 
TRICARE Dental Plans. TRICARE offers three dental plans, each with its own dental contractor. 
The three plans include the active duty dental program, the TRICARE dental program, and the 
TRICARE retiree dental program. 
11.8. Retirement Benefits 
Enlisted members are eligible to retire if they have 20 years of Total Active Federal Military 
Service (TAFMS) and there are no restrictions per DAFI 36-3203, Service Retirements. Enlisted 
members must apply for retirement, otherwise they will separate on their date of separation. 
Officers must have 20 years of TAFMS and 10 years of total active federal commissioned service 
to be eligible to retire. 
Waivers to Retire. DAFI 36-3203, Tables 3.1 and 3.2, identify restrictions to retirement. Some 
restrictions, such as not completing an active duty service commitment, may be waived if the 
member can provide sufficient justification to show the waiver is in the best interest of the USAF 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
209 
 
 
 
or that the member is experiencing an extreme personal hardship uncommon to other military 
members. Not all waivers are approved, so applicants should include detailed evidence to support 
their requests. 
Application Submission. A retirement application can typically be submitted through the myFSS 
website up to 12 months, but no less than 4 months before the desired retirement date. Airmen 
applying for retirement under the 7-day or 3-day option program may be able to submit an 
application more than 12 months in advance. DAFI 36-2110, Chapters 5 and 7, outline information 
on those programs and the applicable exceptions. Before submitting any application, the member 
must request an eligibility review through the myFSS website. The system will provide an 
automated response of the member’s retirement eligibility status and identify any restrictions or 
waiverable conditions at the time of submission. After receiving the eligibility results, the member 
may submit their application through the on-line submission process in myFSS. 
Place of Retirement. In general, a member retires at the current duty station and may travel to a 
home of selection anywhere in the United States. If the member is overseas, the member retires at 
that location when outprocessing facilities exist, and the member and family proceed to the final 
home of selection. When outprocessing facilities do not exist at the overseas location, the member 
may request travel to a separation processing base in the United States. If the member elects to 
retire overseas and live permanently in that country, he or she must comply with command and 
host government residency rules before the date of retirement. 
Retirement Pay Plans. The Date Initially Entered Uniformed Service (DIEUS) normally 
determines which retirement pay plan applies to a member. DIEUS is the date an individual was 
initially enlisted, inducted, or appointed in a Regular or Reserve Component of a uniformed service 
as a commissioned officer, warrant officer, or enlisted member. The DIEUS is a fixed date that is 
not subject to adjustment because of a break in service. Current RegAF personnel will fall under 
one of the retirement plans described in Table 11.1.

resulting in a maximum 
of 75%. The multiplier

Notes: 
1. “Date entered service” means the date the person is enlisted, inducted, or appointed with the Armed Forces. This 
includes persons in the Delayed Entry Program, cadets at Service Academies, officer candidates in Officer Training 
School, students enrolled in an ARC in senior Reserve Officer Training Corps programs or other financial assistance 
programs, students in the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and persons in the Armed Forces 
Health Professions Scholarship program. By using “date entered service,” Active Component members have been 
“grandfathered” under the plan in effect at the time when the member initially entered the service. 
 
2. The maximum multiplier for 30 years TAFMS is 75% times the retired pay base; however, members who serve 
beyond 30 years earn an additional 2.5% each additional year and can max out at 100%. 
3. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act allows state courts to consider retired pay as divisible 
property in divorce settlements. The law does not direct state courts to divide retired pay; it simply permits them to 
do so. 
 
4. Retired pay stops upon the death of the retiree. 
 
5. Officers who retire and do not meet the requirements to retire in the officer’s highest grade (Title 10 USC Section 
1370) will be paid based on the retired grade (Title 10 USC Section 1407f). Officers retiring in an enlisted grade will 
have the member’s pay calculated as determined by Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS). 
 
6. Officers who retire and do not meet the requirements to retire in the officer's highest grade (Title 10 USC Section 
1370) will be paid based on the last 36-month average of the time served in the higher grade and the time served in 
the lower grade. Exception: Does not apply to officers who did not serve satisfactorily in the highest grade and such 
determination is the result of conduct occurring after 30 October 2000 (See Note 5). 
 
7. Enlisted members demoted to a lower grade within three years and retired in that grade will not be paid based on 
the high 36-month average in the higher grades. The member’s retired pay will be calculated using the multiplier 
percentage determined by the applicable retirement plan (High-3, REDUX or BRS) and the retirement pay base will 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
211 
 
 
 
be calculated under final basic pay rate for the lower grade. When an enlisted member’s active service added to 
retired list service totals 30 years, the member may be advanced (on the retired list) and receive retired pay in the 
highest grade satisfactorily held on AD, as determined by the SecAF or designee (Title 10 USC Section 9344). 
 
8. Officers who resign officer commissions and retire in enlisted status will have retired pay calculated in accordance 
with Title 10 USC Section 1407e. DFAS is required to calculate the high-36 month average as if the member held 
the retired grade for the last 36 months of active service. 
 
9. Members entering the service prior to 1 January 2018, who have less than 12 years of service (calculated from the 
pay date) or less than 4,320 retirement points (for ARC members) as of 31 December 2017, may enroll in the BRS. 
 
10.  Members in the Delayed Entry Program, cadets at Service Academies, officer candidates in Officer Training 
School, students enrolled in an ARC in senior Reserve Officer Training Corps programs, entering the service prior 
to 1 January 2018, may enroll in the BRS following commissioning/accession into AD. Members commissioned or 
accessed AD after 2 December 2018 have 30 days from commissioning/entry into AD to enroll in the BRS. 
 
11.  Members with breaks in service reentering AD or the selected reserve on or after 1 January 2019, who originally 
entered the service prior to 1 January 2018, and have less than 12 years of service (calculated from the pay date) or 
less than 4,320 retirement points for ARC members as of reentry, may enroll in the BRS within 30 days of reentry. 
 
12.  Members enrolled in the BRS will have a Thrift Savings Plan established that includes automatic and matching 
government contributions. DoD begins an automatic contribution of one percent of base pay after 60 days of service 
(calculated from pay date). DoD begins matching contributions up to an additional four percent of base pay after 2 
years of service (calculated from pay date). Automatic and matching contributions continue until the member 
separates, retires, or completes 26 years of service (calculated from pay date). For members enrolling in BRS as 
outlined in Notes 9 through 11, government contributions begin the pay period following enrollment. 
 
13.  Airmen retiring under the BRS are eligible to elect a lump sum payment of a portion of the Airman’s retirement 
pay. Requests for the lump sum election are documented on the DD Form 2656, Data for Payment of Retired 
Personnel, and must be submitted to the retirement approval authority no later than 90 days prior to the Airman’s 
retirement effective date for regular retirement or the date upon which the Airman first becomes eligible to receive 
retired pay under the non-regular retirement program. The retirement approval authority will notify the Airman of 
the lump sum election at the time of retirement application or 90 days prior to the Airman’s eligibility to receive 
retired pay. Airmen have the option of receiving the lump sum payment in up to four annual installments. Acceptance 
of the lump sum payment does not impact an Airman’s eligibility to elect Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP); however, 
there may be required offsets or other considerations related to disability pay and other benefits from the Department 
of Veterans’ Affairs. Airmen should seek counseling from the Military and Family Readiness Center (M&FRC) prior 
to election. 
 
Table 11.1. Retirement Pay Plans. 
11.9. Survivor Benefit Plan 
Military pay stops when a member dies. The survivor benefit plan provides a monthly income to 
survivors of retired military personnel upon the member’s death. The survivor benefit plan is a 
government program for retiring members to ensure their eligible survivors receive a portion of 
their military retired pay as a monthly annuity after their death. The plan was structured so a 
surviving spouse cannot outlive the annuity, and cost-of-living adjustments are incorporated to 
offset inflation. RegAF members with a spouse or dependent children are automatically covered 
by the survivor benefit plan at no cost while they remain on RegAF status. 
The member’s death must be classified in ‘line of duty’ for an annuity to be payable if the member 
is not yet retirement eligible (has not accrued 20 years of RegAF status) on the date of death. The 
annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been entitled to receive if 
retired with a total disability rating on the date of death. An annuity may also be payable if the 
member’s death is classified ‘not in line of duty’ as long as the member was retirement eligible on 
the date of death. In this case, annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the member would 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
212 
 
 
 
have been entitled to receive if retired for years of service on the date of death. The surviving 
spouse of a member who dies in the line of duty while on RegAF status may request the survivor 
benefit plan be paid only to the member’s children, avoiding the reduction caused by a spouse’s 
receipt of dependency and indemnity compensation, the survivor benefits paid by the VA when a 
member’s death is determined to have resulted from a service-connected cause. 
The survivor benefit plan is the only program that enables a portion of military retired pay to be 
paid to a member’s survivors. Prior to retiring, each member must decide whether to continue 
survivor benefit plan coverage into retirement. If electing coverage, survivor benefit plan 
premiums are assessed and automatically deducted from the member’s monthly retired pay. 
Premiums are government-subsidized and deducted from a participating member’s retired pay 
before taxes. 
Survivor benefit plan premiums and beneficiary annuity payments depend on what is called the 
“base amount” elected as the basis of coverage. A service member’s base amount can be the full 
monthly retired pay or a portion of retired pay, down to $300. Full coverage means full retired pay 
is elected as the base amount. The base amount is tied to a member’s retired pay; therefore, when 
retired pay receives cost-of-living adjustments, so does the base amount, and as a result, so do 
premiums and annuity payments. 
Under limited circumstances, Airmen may withdraw from the survivor benefit plan or change 
coverage. As a survivor benefit plan participant, individuals have a one-year window to terminate 
survivor benefit plan coverage between the second and third anniversary following the date 
beginning receipt of retired pay. The premiums paid will not be refunded, and an annuity will not 
be payable upon death. The covered spouse or former spouse must consent to the withdrawal. 
Termination is permanent, and participation may not be resumed under any circumstance barring 
future enrollment. The survivor benefit plan also has a “paid-up” feature that permits members 
who have attained age 70, and who have paid survivor benefit plan premiums for 360 months, to 
stop paying premiums but remain active participants in the plan. 
11.10. American Red Cross 
The American Red Cross (https://www.redcross.org/) offers unwavering commitment, free of 
charge, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, to members of the U.S. Armed Forces, veterans, and 
their families, to include: RegAF, National Guard, Reservists, Reserve Officer Training Corps, 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Public Health Service. Red Cross 
support enhances morale and contributes to increased operational capability by linking military 
families during an emergency, connecting families with local community resources, providing 
resiliency training, and supporting wounded warriors and military hospitals, non-Federal entity 
program, service, or award. The Red Cross toll free number for service members and families in 
the United States is: 1-800-733-2767. Military members and family members overseas may call 
base or installation operators or the American Red Cross office at the overseas location. Note: 
For the American Red Cross to provide expedient service, provide as much of the following 
information available as possible: full name, rank/rating, branch of service, social security number 
or date of birth, military address, and information about the deployed unit and home base unit (for 
deployed service members only). 
Emergency Communication Services. When a military family experiences a crisis, the American 
Red Cross is there to assist by providing emergency communications. The Red Cross relays urgent 
messages containing accurate, factual, complete, and verified descriptions of the emergency to 
service members stationed anywhere in the world, including ships at sea, embassies, and remote 
locations. Red Cross-verified information assists commanders in making decisions regarding 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
213 
 
 
 
emergency leave. 
Financial Assistance. The American Red Cross works under partnership agreements with the Air 
Force Aid Society, Army Emergency Relief, Coast Guard Mutual Assistance, and Navy-Marine 
Corps Relief Society to provide quality, reliable financial assistance to eligible applicants. Types 
of assistance include financial assistance for emergency travel, burial of a loved one, and assistance 
to avoid privation or hardship. 
Coping with Deployments. The psychological first aid course was designed specifically for 
spouses, parents, siblings, and significant others of service members. This Red Cross service 
provides useful information on how to strengthen the ability to successfully respond to challenges 
that military family members may encounter throughout the deployment cycle. The course also 
explains how to provide psychological first aid to others experiencing stressful feelings or events. 
Reconnection Workshops. The reconnection workshops are designed for reintegration support 
for working through anger, communicating clearly, exploring stress and trauma, relating to 
children, and identifying depression. The workshops focus on individuals and small groups to help 
family members reconnect and help service members reintegrate successfully. Led by licensed, 
specifically trained Red Cross mental health workers, each session addresses a topic military 
family have found relevant to the reunion adjustment. 
Veterans Claims for Benefits. The American Red Cross provides assistance and information in 
preparing, developing, and obtaining sufficient evidence to support applicants’ claims for veterans’ 
benefits, and also assists claimants who seek to appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. 
Information and Referral Services. The American Red Cross offers confidential services to all 
military personnel and their families. Counseling, guidance, information, referrals, and other social 
services are available through the worldwide network of chapters and offices on military 
installations. As more and more National Guard and Reserve units are called to full-time duty 
status, counseling has become increasingly important to prepare the civilian-based military 
members and their families for the period of activation. 
11.11. Recruiting Programs 
Airmen of all ranks can have a positive impact on recruiting and help recruiters make contacts and 
develop leads. 
Recruiter 
Assistance 
Programs. 
The 
Recruiter 
Assistance 
Program 
(RAP) 
(http://www.recruiting.af.mil/) is a RegAF leave program, run by the Air Force Recruiting 
Service, where an Airman or Guardian directly supports a USAF or USSF recruiter. Members 
may request non-chargeable leave in accordance with DAFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. 
RAP is beneficial to the DAF and to participants as Airmen and Guardians can be major influences 
in sharing the USAF or USSF story to their hometown or place of previous residence. RAP duties 
may include question-and-answer sessions, making presentations, or providing testimonials of 
their USAF or USSF experiences to high school and college students. 
We

(WEAR) 
program 
(https://www.recruiting.af.mil/) may grant Airmen or Guardians permissive temporary duty status 
if they participate in an event that directly enhances the recruiting mission. All Airmen and 
Guardians, regardless of their USAF or USSF specialty, are recruiters. A WEAR event is an event 
where the interaction of USAF or USSF personnel educates and increases public awareness of the 
DAF and could potentially generate interest in new recruits. 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
214 
 
 
 
Approval for WEAR is limited to those events where Airmen and Guardians are directly speaking 
to potential applicants or influencers about USAF or USSF opportunities. Applicants are defined 
as individuals within the age range of 17 to 39. Influencers are defined as parents, community 
leaders, teachers, counselors, or coaches. For events where multiple Airmen are attending, each 
attendee must submit a package for approval. WEAR requests must be first approved by the 
individual’s commander in accordance with DAFI 36-3003. Requests are then routed to the Air 
Force Recruiting Service Public Affairs office via e-mail: afrshqpa@us.af.mil. Members may 
request permissive temporary duty to attend a WEAR event. Visit the AF Recruiting Service 
website (https://www.recruiting.af.mil/) to review the WEAR Fact Sheet, and download the 
WEAR form, AFRS Form 10.

11.12. Leave Management 
Annual leave programs/plans give members the opportunity to take leave within the constraints of 
operational requirements. Unit commanders establish leave programs and plans to encourage the 
use of leave for the maximum benefit of the member. Lengthy respites from the work environment 
tend to have a beneficial effect on an individual’s psychological and physical status. Therefore, an 
effective leave program is an essential military requirement. 
Processing Leave Requests. LeaveWeb is an automated method of requesting and processing 
leave. Under LeaveWeb, the member requests leave which generates an e-mail to the leave 
approval authority, as determined by the member’s commander. While commanders have final 
approval authority, they may delegate this authority according to the needs of the organization, 
normally no lower than the first-line supervisor. The leave approval authority approves or 
disapproves the leave and, if approved, LeaveWeb sends the request to the unit leave monitor for 
validation. Once validated, the leave request is sent electronically to finance. The member prints a 
copy of the approved leave form to hand-carry during leave. Upon returning from leave, the 
member completes the necessary updates in LeaveWeb and forwards the e-mail to the leave 
approval authority for endorsement. In the event LeaveWeb is unavailable, appropriate procedures 
may require use of the DAF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization. 
11.13. Beginning and Ending Leave 
Leave must begin and end in the local area. The term “local area” means the place of residence 
from which the member commutes to the duty station on a daily basis. This also applies to leave 
enroute to a permanent change of station or temporary duty (TDY) assignment. The old permanent 
duty station is for beginning leave and the new permanent duty station is for ending leave. When 
members take leave enroute with permanent change of station or TDY travel, the financial service 
office uses the travel voucher to determine authorized travel and chargeable leave. Nonduty days 
and holidays are chargeable leave days if they occur during an authorized period of leave. If leave 
includes a weekend, a member cannot end leave on a Friday and begin leave again on Monday. 
Further, unit commanders will not approve successive Monday through Friday leaves (or periods 
of leave surrounding other nonduty days) except under emergency or unusual circumstances, as 
determined by the unit commander. 
Extensions and Recalls. When an extension of leave is desired, the member must ask, orally or 
in writing, for an extension of leave. The extension must be requested sufficiently in advance of 
expiration of leave authorized to permit the member to return to duty at the proper time if the 
approval authority disapproves the extension. Unit commanders may recall members from leave 
for military necessity or in the best interest of the USAF. Refer to the Joint Travel Regulation to 
determine if travel and transportation allowances apply. If the unit commander authorizes the 
member to resume leave after the member completes the duty that resulted in recall, a new DAF 
Form 988 or orders must be prepared. 
11.14. Accruing Leave 
Members accrue 2.5 days leave for each month of RegAF status. Members do not earn leave when 
they are absent without official leave, in an unauthorized leave status, in confinement as a result 
of a court-martial sentence, in an excess leave status, or on appellate leave. Members may 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
216 
 
 
 
accumulate a maximum of 60 days by the end of a fiscal year. There are certain circumstances 
when a leave balance of more than 60 days may be carried forward into a new fiscal year, but only 
when specifically authorized. By law, members may receive accrued leave payment up to a 
maximum of 60 days at certain points in their careers, such as reenlistment, retirement, separation 
under honorable conditions, or death. Department of Defense policy encourage members to use 
leave to relax from the pressures of duties and not as a method of compensation. 
11.15. Types of Leave 
DAFI 36-3003, outlines many types of leave, as briefly described here. 
Annual Leave. Another name for “ordinary” leave is annual leave. Normally, members use annual 
leave to take vacations, attend to family needs, celebrate traditional holidays, attend significant 
events, or as terminal leave with retirement or separation from RegAF status. 
Advance Leave. Advance leave is granted based on a reasonable expectation that a member will 
accrue at least the amount of leave being requested during the remaining period of RegAF status. 
The purpose of advance leave is to enable members to resolve emergencies or urgent situations 
when they have limited or no accrued leave. When a member has taken all the advance leave that 
represents what he or she will accrue during the remaining period of RegAF service, commanders 
change the member’s leave status from advance to excess leave. 
Bereavement Leave. Bereavement Leave is a period of non-chargeable paid leave to make 
arrangements required by the death of a member’s spouse or child and to attend the funeral, burial, 
or memorial service of the spouse or child. A member who experiences such a loss will be allowed 
up to 14 days of leave to be used in connection with the death. The member must have less than 
30 days of accrued ordinary leave on the date of such death to be eligible for bereavement leave. 
Excess Leave. Excess leave is normally used for personal or family emergency situations when 
members cannot request advance leave. Excess leave is a no-pay status; therefore, entitlement to 
pay and allowances and leave accrual stops on the member’s first day of excess leave. If injured, 
a member will not receive disability pay for time spent on excess leave. The period of excess leave 
will not count toward fulfillment of RegAF duty service commitment. The member will be 
charged for each day of excess leave used and an additional half day for every 6 days of negative 
leave. 
Convalescent Leave. Convalescent leave is an authorized absence normally for the minimal time 
needed to meet the medical needs for recuperation. A member of the armed forces diagnosed with 
a medical condition is allowed convalescent leave if the medical or behavioral health provider of 
the member determines that the member is not yet fit for duty as a result of that condition and 
recommends such leave for the member to provide for the convalescence of the member from that 
condition. This may include convalescence to enable healthy coping mechanisms following 
traumatic events such as loss of a child due to stillbirth or miscarriage where other types of non-
chargeable leave are not authorized. The Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG) oversees the 
convalescent leave program in accordance with AFMAN 41-210, Tricare Operations and Patient 
Administration. 
Emergency Leave. Emergency leave is chargeable leave granted for emergencies involving 
members of the immediate family. Unit commanders approve emergency leave and can delegate 
leave approval to no lower than the first sergeant for enlisted personnel. The official granting leave 
may request assistance from the military service activity nearest the location of the emergency or, 
when necessary, from the American Red Cross. The initial period of emergency leave is usually 
no more than 30 days with a possible 30-day extension with approval from the unit commander or 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
217 
 
 
 
first sergeant. Unit commanders should advise members to apply for a humanitarian or exceptional 
family member reassignment or hardship discharge if the leave period is more than 60 days. 
Emergency Leave of Absence (Non-Chargeable Leave). Emergency Leave of Absence allows 
commanders or civilian directors to grant up to 14 days of non-chargeable leave for a qualifying 
emergency such as a serious medical condition of an immediate family member of the service 
member, death of an immediate family member as defined in DAFI 36-3003, paragraph 3.1.3.1, 
or any other hardship the commander or director determines appropriate. The leave is granted 
once during an entire career and is only used to prevent the service member from entering an 
advanced or excess leave status. 
Enroute Leave. Enroute leave is ordinary leave used during a permanent change of station. 
Normally, the losing unit commander approves up to 30 days enroute leave with any change of 
station move if it does not interfere with the reporting date of the new assignment. Members who 
complete basic or technical training may request 10 days of leave enroute if their first duty station 
is in the Continental United States, or 14 days for an overseas assignment. Members may request 
advance leave when they do not have enough leave accrued for enroute leave. 
Terminal Leave. Terminal leave is chargeable leave taken in conjunction with retirement or 
separation from RegAF status. The member’s last day of leave coincides with the last day of 
RegAF status. Normally, a member does not return to duty after terminal leave begins. The amount 
of leave taken cannot exceed the leave balance at the date of separation. 
Environmental and Morale Leave. Environmental and morale leave is authorized overseas 
where adverse environmental conditions require special arrangements for leave in desirable places 
at periodic intervals. Funded environmental and morale leave is charged as ordinary leave and 
members are authorized military transportation (travel time is not charged as leave). Unfunded 
environmental and morale leave is charged as ordinary leave and members are authorized space- 
available air transportation to and from the duty locations (travel time is charged as leave). 
Military Parental Leave Program. Military Parental Leave Program authorizes 12 weeks of 
non-chargeable leave to covered service members after a qualifying birth event, adoption of a 
minor child or who have a minor child placed for adoption or long-term foster care with them to 
care for the child. 
11.16. Permissive Temporary Duty 
Permissive TDY is an administrative absence for which funded TDY is not appropriate. 
Commanders may not authorize permissive TDY in place of leave or a special pass or in 
conjunction with special passes. Permissive TDY, if authorized, may include traveling to or in the 
vicinity of a new permanent duty station to secure off-base housing, accompanying a military or 
dependent patient to a designated medical treatment facility not in the local area, attending a 
Department of Defense sponsored assistance seminar under the Transition Assistance Program, or 
attending national conventions or meetings hosted by service-connected organizations. 
11.17. Regular and Special Passes 
A pass period is an authorized absence from duty for a relatively short amount of time. There are 
no mileage restrictions; however, members may be expected to return to duty within a reasonable 
time due to an operational mission requirement, such as a recall, unit alert, or unit emergency. 
Regular Pass. A regular pass normally begins at the end of work hours on Friday afternoon and 
continues until the beginning of normal work hours on the following Monday when non-duty days 
are Saturday and Sunday. A regular pass period on non-traditional work schedules (alternate or 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
218 
 
 
 
compressed schedules) may not exceed the four-day special pass limit. The combination of non- 
duty days and a public holiday may not exceed the four-day special pass limit. The combination 
of three non-duty days and a public holiday during a compressed work schedule is a regular pass 
period. Department of Defense or higher management may determine that a Monday or Friday is 
compensatory (comp) time off when a holiday is observed on a Tuesday or Thursday, in which 
case a regular pass may consist of a weekend, a comp day off, and a public holiday. 
Special Pass. Unit commanders may award three- or four-day special passes for special occasions, 
circumstances, special recognition, or compensatory time off. Commanders may delegate approval 
to a level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalents. Special passes start 
after normal work hours on a given day. They stop at the beginning of normal work hours on either 
the fourth day for a three-day special pass or the fifth day for a four-day special pass.

retirees, and veterans, as well as spouses and family members. There are a large number of military 
associations devoted to serving different segments of the community for lobbying efforts, 
fraternity, and support. The USAF and its personnel can endorse the following activities per Joint 
Ethics Regulation (JER), Section 3-210, Activities with Non-Federal Entities: Fundraising and

11.19. Civilian Personnel Programs 
The USAF provides civilian personnel services through installation civilian personnel flights 
(usually located in the force support squadron) and Air Force Personnel Center. Civilian personnel 
sections must provide service to all civilian employees to ensure they are included in the USAF 
civilian personnel program unless otherwise approved through HAF. 
11.20. Position Descriptions 
Civilian employees do not have a rank. Instead, the positions they occupy are graded, typically 
under the General Schedule, based upon detailed written job descriptions that are the basis for 
determining the pay, qualification requirements, performance expectations, and appraisal ratings 
associated with the position. Position descriptions historically have covered duties, 
responsibilities, and supervisory controls. The USAF has expanded the scope of core personnel 
documents to include qualifications required for recruitment and training requirements for new 
employees. Supervisors are responsible for core personnel document accuracy and implementation 
of standard core personnel documents. By selecting standard core personnel documents, 
supervisors save time for themselves and classification specialists who would need to work with 
the manager on writing the duties and determining the correct pay plan and occupational series. 
Standard core personnel documents can be used as templates for unique core personnel documents 
requiring new classification analysis. 
11.21. Filling Jobs 
Vacant civilian positions are filled based on an organization’s needs using a variety of recruitment 
sources and appointing authorities consistent with applicable laws, regulations, directives, and 
policies, as established by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Department of 
Defense, and the USAF. Referral and selection priorities must be observed when filling 
competitive service positions. Employees with mandatory selection or priority referral rights 
normally include those adversely affected by reduction-in-force, involuntary separation, demotion, 
transfer of function declinations or transfer of work outside the commuting area, overseas returnees, 
and the spouses of military personnel. Supervisors work in concert with their servicing human 
resource specialist in the civilian personnel sections or Air Force Personnel Center to determine 
appropriate recruitment sources. As a vacancy for competitive fill actions is announced, candidates 
are screened by Air Force Personnel Center and one or more lists of candidates are referred to the 
supervisor. 
Based on qualifying experience and/or education, civilians can enter civil service at different pay 
grade levels. The competitive staffing process used by the USAF and other federal agencies 
determines the relative qualifications of the candidates and refers the best qualified for selection. 
The U.S. OPM provides agencies with qualification standards written broadly for government-
wide application. 
11.22. Civilian Resource Management 
Civilian pay funds are needed for civilian overtime, awards, bonuses, student loan repayment 
program, seasonal and longer-term overhires, voluntary separation incentive payments to 
minimize involuntary reduction-in-force separations, and severance pay for affected employees as 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
221 
 
 
 
the result of reduction in force. Accurate requirement projections and development of employment 
plans are critical to support the workload demand within budget, while executing work years, end 
strength, and civilian pay resource. 
Civilian resource management is dependent on a team of leaders, to include commanders, senior 
leaders, human resource officers, financial managers, and manpower officers who determine 
effective use of employees, funds, and manpower authorizations to meet mission requirements. A 
corporate board structure is used for meeting at least quarterly to manage annual appropriations, 
revolving funds, or reimbursements used for civilian employment costs. 
11.23. Training and Development 
USAF policy provides for necessary training to improve skills needed in employee performance. 
Supervisors are responsible for determining training requirements and working with the civilian 
personnel sections or education and training functions to identify appropriate training sources. A 
training-needs survey is conducted annually to provide supervisors an opportunity to project 
training requirements for the upcoming fiscal year, but supervisors may request an out-of-cycle 
training need at any time during the year. Supervisors should encourage civilian employees to 
independently pursue training and education that will prepare them for promotion or develop them 
for career transitions. The servicing employee development specialist is available to assist in 
training needs analysis and identification of methods and training sources. For additional 
information, refer to DAFMAN 36-2689, Training Program and DAFI 36-2687, Civilian 
Development. 
Sources of Training. The three primary sources of training are agency (USAF), interagency, and 
nongovernment. Training that is conducted away from the work site is requested, approved, and 
documented using Standard Form 182, Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training. 
Agency Training. Agency training is conducted by the USAF and may include on-the-job 
training, in-house training, and USAF formal schools. On-the-job training and in-house training 
are often the most effective because the supervisor tailors the training to meet the specific job 
requirements. In-house training is effective when a large number of employees need instruction 
on common aspects of occupational skill requirements. More formalized agency classroom 
training is available through USAF formal schools listed in the Education and Training Course 
Announcements ETCA) website (https://www.aetc.af.mil/News/Force-Development/Learning-
Professionals-and-FD-Credentials/Force-Development-Registrar/Education-and-Training-
Course-Announcements/).  
Interagency Training. Interagency training includes all training sponsored by other U.S. 
Government agencies and may be needed if agency sources are not adequate to meet identified 
training needs. The OPM, the Departments of Army and Navy, and the Departments of Labor and 
Agriculture are just a few sources from which to obtain interagency training. 
Nongovernmental Training. Nongovernmental sources incorporate a wide range of seminars, 
conferences, courses, and workshops, as well as curricula offered by private educational 
institutions. Federal regulations require agencies to consider and select government training 
sources before turning to nongovernmental alternatives. However, nongovernmental sources may 
be considered when agency or interagency courses cannot satisfy a training need or when 
nongovernmental training is more advantageous. 
11.24. Performance Planning, Appraisals, and Awards for Employees 
Civilian employees are advised of duties and responsibilities of their jobs in their core personnel 
document, and of their supervisor’s performance expectations in performance plans that are 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
222 
 
 
 
developed annually at the start of a performance rating cycle. Performance standards prescribe 
how an employee’s accomplishment of a particular element or duty will be measured. Supervisors 
set performance elements (duties and tasks) for civilian employees and determine the 
major/important requirements of the job based on the employee’s direct contribution to 
organization or work unit objectives. 
Employees receive annual appraisals on how well they perform their duties. The performance 
appraisal is the basis for personnel actions to identify and correct work performance problems, 
recognize, and reward quality performance, improve productivity, and grant periodic pay increases. 
Supervisors review employee performance of each element and rate the performance against each 
element’s standards, then render an overall summary rating. Employees who fail one or more 
performance elements are administered an unacceptable appraisal and are given an opportunity to 
improve. 
Supervisors may reward employees to recognize high performance. Performance awards (for 
example, performance cash, time-off, and quality step increases) can be used as tools to motivate 
civilian employees to perform above an acceptable level as well as compensate them for 
performing beyond expectations. Effective management of the performance awards program can 
help improve productivity and morale in the organization. 
11.25. Standards of Conduct 
DAFI 36-147, Civilian Conduct and Responsibility, and Joint Ethics Regulation, cover activities 
that are mandatory for civilian employees and activities that are prohibited. All employees are 
expected to maintain high standards of honesty, responsibility, and accountability - and to adhere 
to the USAF core values of Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do. 
Required activities include furnishing testimony in official investigations and hearings consistent 
with protections against self-incrimination; paying lawful debts and taxes; being present for work 
unless authorized to be absent; complying with health, safety, and all other proper instructions 
regarding work; presenting a positive public image; complying with reasonable dress and 
grooming standards; and maintaining professional relationships with fellow workers, subordinates, 
and supervisors. 
Prohibited actions include discrimination and sexual harassment; drug and alcohol abuse; misuse 
of government purchase cards; misuse of government computers, vehicles, and other equipment; 
taking bribes; conducting personal business at work; and criminal behavior off-duty that reflect 
adversely on USAF employment. The USAF does not attempt to list all possible forms of improper 
conduct but emphasizes to employees that misconduct will not be tolerated. 
Civilian Pay: Note: Some civilian employees are paid through alternative personnel systems like 
the Acquisition Demonstration Project or Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System. 
Servicing civilian personnel sections should be consulted for additional information concerning 
how civilian pay is administered under an alternative personnel system. 
11.26. Civilian Pay 
General Schedule employee pay is expressed as an annual salary. The General Schedule grades 
have 10 steps in each grade. Within grade or step, increases start at one-year intervals, but slow to 
two- and three-year intervals in the higher steps. All General Schedule pay rates in the United States 
include locality pay. Pay rates overseas do not include locality pay and are approximately 10 
percent lower than United States rates. General Schedule pay scales normally increase in January 
through the legislative process. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
223 
 
 
 
The Federal Wage system consists of wage grade, wage leader, and wage supervisor. Federal Wage 
system grades have five steps, in which grade increases start at six-month intervals and slow to 
eighteen-month and two-year intervals. The Federal Wage system pay is expressed as hourly wage 
rates. Federal Wage system rates vary more between local areas than General Schedule. Federal 
Wage system rates may also be increased annually, but on an area-by-area basis throughout the 
year. For additional information on civilian pay, refer to AFI 36-128, Pay Setting and Allowances. 
11.27. Work Hours 
Civilian work schedules are defined in such terms as administrative workweek, basic workweek, 
regular tour of duty, uncommon tour of duty, and part-time tour of duty. Most civilians work a 
regular tour of duty, which is normally five eight-hour days, Monday through Friday. Uncommon 
tours of duty (a 40-hour basic workweek that includes Saturday and/or Sunday or fewer than five 
days, but not more than six days of a seven-day administrative workweek) are authorized when 
necessary for mission accomplishment. Special circumstances permit part-time, intermittent, or 
special tours of duty. Installation and tenant commanders establish, by written order, daily work 
hours to include designated rest and lunch periods. Two types of alternate work schedules can be 
implemented by organization commanders. Flexible work schedules allow employees to start and 
end work at different times. Compressed work schedules cover 80 hours in a pay period in fewer 
than 10 workdays. The most common schedule has four nine-hour days each week, an eight-hour 
day in one week, and a regular day off in the other week. For additional information on work hours, 
refer to DoDI1400.25V610_DAFI36-152, Hours of Work and Holiday Observances. 
11.28. Absence and Leave 
Civilian employees earn 13 days of sick leave each year, and 13, 20, or 26 days of annual leave, 
depending on their length of service. There is no cap on the accumulation of sick leave. Annual 
leave accumulation is capped at 30 days for most civilian employees. Employees working overseas 
can accumulate 45 days of annual leave. 
Annual leave is used for vacations and/or personal reasons, and should be approved in advance of 
being taken, unless emergency conditions exist. Leave is charged and taken in 15-minute 
increments. Sick leave for medical appointments or care for a family member should be scheduled 
and approved in advance, except in cases of emergency. Illness or injury that keeps an employee 
away from work should be reported to a supervisor during the first two hours of the duty day. 
Absence for jury duty, dismissals for extreme weather conditions, or absences excused by the 
installation commander are not charged to annual leave. Employees who have earned 
compensatory time for overtime or time-off awards should schedule absences to use that time like 
they schedule annual leave. For additional information on absence and leave, refer to 
DoDI1400.25V630_AFI36-815, Leave. 
11.29. Unions and Labor Management 
Approximately 53 percent of USAF civilian employees are covered by labor agreements between 
unions and installations or major commands. As such, they are members of the bargaining unit, 
even if they are not dues-paying union members. Unions have legal status under federal law. A 
labor relations officer or specialist in the civilian personnel section is the usual liaison between 
supervisors and other management officials and union officials. The labor relations officer speaks 
for management in routine communications with the union and with parties outside the USAF who 
have roles in labor contract negotiations and dispute resolution. Other union officials, such as 
elected officers and appointed officials, may act and make commitments for unions. For additional 
information on unions and labor management, refer to DAFI 36-701, Labor-Management 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
224 
 
 
 
Relations. 
11.30. Dispute Resolution 
Civilian employees have a variety of avenues to resolve disputes. Labor-management contracts 
must include a negotiated grievance procedure to be used by members of the bargaining unit. Most 
start with an option to seek resolution using outside neutral facilitators or mediators (alternative 
dispute resolution). Supervisors, managers, and employees who are not covered by a collective 
bargaining agreement, or who are not members of the bargaining unit, follow different grievance 
procedures. Administrative grievances are decided by USAF officials, usually the installation 
commander or designee, although outside fact finders may be used. For additional information on 
dispute resolution and grievances, refer to DoDI 1400.25, DoD Civilian Personnel Management 
System, current edition, and DoDI 1400.25v771_DAFI36-706, DoD Civilian Management 
System: Administrative Grievance System.

12.1.  Individual Financial Responsibilities 
According to AFI 1-1, just like physical fitness is important for health, “fiscal fitness” is equally 
important to overall well-being of USAF members. Two key aspects of individual financial 
responsibility are the establishment of a personal budget and effective management of one’s debt. 
It is important to review Leave and Earnings Statements (LES) on a regular basis, file travel 
vouchers on a timely basis, and use the government travel charge card (GTCC) to pay for all costs 
related to official government travel. Official government travel is defined as travel under official 
orders while performing duties pertaining to official government assignments such as temporary 
duty (TDY) and permanent change of station (PCS). Additional information on financial 
responsibilities, pay and allowances, and related entitlements can be found in the Joint Travel 
Regulation, DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoDFMR) 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, 
Military Pay Policy—Active Duty and Reserve Pay, and AFMAN 65-116, Volume 1, Defense 
Joint Military Pay System Active Component (DJMSAC) Financial Management Flight (FMF) 
Procedures. 
12.2. Military (Basic) Pay 
Basic pay is the fundamental component of military pay, and typically the largest component of 
a member’s pay. Annual military pay raises are set by Congress and the U.S. President in the 
National Defense Authorization Act. In accordance with federal law, the 1 January annual pay 
raise will automatically match the private sector wage increases, as measured by the Employment 
Cost Index for the previous year. If national emergencies or serious economic conditions affect 
general welfare, the U.S. President may propose that Congress instill a lower annual pay raise.  
Military Pay Date. The military pay date determines the length of service for pay purposes. In 
general, the pay date should be the same date the individual entered on RegAF status if he or she 
had no prior service before entering the USAF. However, if the individual previously served in 
certain governmental agencies, the USAF adjusts the pay date to reflect credit for these periods. 
In the event of periods of absence without leave, desertion, and sickness or injury due to personal 
misconduct, negative pay date adjustments may result. 
12.3. Leave and Earnings Statement 
The LES, titled the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Form 702, Defense Finance 
and Accounting Service Military Leave and Earnings Statement, is a comprehensive statement of 
a member’s entitlements, deductions, allotments, leave information, tax-withholdings, as well as 
Traditional and Roth Thrift Savings Plan information. PCS is a time for Airmen to “apply 
increased attention” to their LES since many times entitlements such as BAH, COLA, etc. change 
when moving from one duty location to another. And PCSing usually occurs more frequently than 
a birth, marriage, divorce, etc. The myPay system allows members to view their LES as well as 
initiate changes to selected items affecting their pay. If pay varies significantly, consult the 
servicing finance office.  
Regular Pay Schedule. Military members are paid on a monthly basis with the option to receive 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
226 
 
 
 
payments once or twice per month. Members receive a statement (net pay advice) of the net 
amount of pay and the financial statement at mid-month (if receiving a payment), and a 
comprehensive statement of pay (the LES) at the end of the month via myPay. These statements 
are created centrally by DFAS. The pay system has processing cutoff dates for computing, 
preparing, and transferring funds so DFAS can stop processing transactions against pay accounts 
for the current period and begin the regular payroll process. While cutoff dates fluctuate from 
month to month, they generally occur around the 6th for the mid-month and the 20th for the end-
of-month paydays.  
Local, Partial, and Emergency Partial Payments. Local cash payments are normally only 
authorized for overseas areas where on base military banking facilities are not readily available. 
Exceptions may be granted for members assigned to classified or contingency operations where 
the exigencies of their assignments may require local cash or partial payments. The member’s 
commander may authorize immediate cash payments up to the amount of accrued entitlement to 
date when deemed appropriate to the mission. Non-cash partial payments may be made via 
electronic funds transfer and deposited into the member’s financial institution, normally in two to 
three business days. Partial payments are limited to the amount of pay and allowances the member 
has accrued to the date of the payment. Partial payments are recouped in full on the next available 
payday. Under extenuating circumstances, a stateside member may receive an emergency partial 
payment if deemed time sensitive and required within 24 hours due to unforeseen circumstances.  
12.4. Military Allowances and Entitlements 
Allowances are provided for specific needs, such as food or housing. Monetary allowances are 
provided when the government does not provide for that specific need. For example, those who 
live in government housing do not receive full housing allowances, and those who do not live in 
government housing receive allowances to assist with the cost of obtaining commercial housing. 
Many allowances are not taxable, which is an additional embedded benefit of military pay. A 
complete list of military benefits and entitlements can be found at on the MyAirForceBenefits 
website: https://www.myairforcebenefits.us.af.mil/. You can also view your annual Personal 
Statement of Military Compensation (PSMC) on myPay:  https://mypay.dfas.mil which can be 
used to show your total compensation when comparing civilian employment offers or applying 
for credit or loans. 
Basic Allowance for Subsistence. Basic allowance for subsistence is a nontaxable allowance 
used to offset the cost of a service member’s meals. Often junior grade enlisted members assigned 
to single-type government quarters at their permanent duty station are required to eat in 
government dining facilities, receive basic allowance for subsistence, and are charged the 
discounted meal rate which is deducted from their pay. When certified by the commanding officer 
or designee, members are allowed to claim reimbursement for missed meals.  
Basic Allowance for Housing. The intent of basic allowance for housing is to provide uniformed 
service members accurate and equitable housing compensation based on housing costs in local 
civilian housing markets. This allowance is payable when government quarters are not provided. 
Many USAF installations have privatized quarters. Members in privatized quarters are entitled to 
basic allowance for housing. A rental agreement requires a rent amount not to exceed the basic 
allowance for housing entitlement paid via allotment. Note: Members without dependents 
residing in government single-type quarters are entitled to partial basic allowance for housing 
unless the quarters (including government-leased quarters) exceed the minimum standards of 
single quarters for their grade. Members living in single-type government quarters who pay court-
ordered child support may qualify for differential (basic allowance for housing-differential).  
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
227 
 
 
 
Overseas Housing Allowance. Overseas housing allowance is a cost reimbursement-based 
allowance to help defray housing costs incident to assignments to a permanent duty station outside 
the United States. Members are reimbursed actual rental costs not to exceed the maximum 
overseas housing allowance rate for each locality, grade, and dependency status. Move-in housing 
allowance (for those who qualify) is based on the average “move-in” costs for members. Monthly 
overseas housing allowance includes the rent (up to the rental allowance at a permanent duty 
station) plus the utility/recurring maintenance allowance.  
Family Separation Housing. The purpose of family separation housing is to pay a member for 
added housing expenses resulting from enforced separation from dependents. Family separation 
housing-basic allowance for housing is payable in a monthly amount equal to the without- 
dependent basic allowance for housing rate applicable to the member’s grade and permanent duty 
station. Family separation housing-overseas housing allowance is payable in a monthly amount 
up to the without-dependent overseas housing allowance rate applicable to the member’s grade 
and permanent duty station.  
12.5. Clothing Replacement Allowance 
Enlisted military members receive an annual allowance to help maintain, repair, and replace initial 
issue uniform items, as necessary. Clothing replacement allowance-basic is a preliminary 
replacement allowance paid annually between the 6th and 36th month of RegAF status. Clothing 
replacement allowance-standard automatically replaces clothing replacement allowance-basic 
after 36 months of RegAF status. Entitlement to either allowance depends on the individual’s 
“entered on RegAF status date” in his or her master military pay account.  
12.6. Family Separation Allowance 
Family separation allowance is payable to members with dependents in addition to other 
allowances or per diem to which a member may be entitled. The purpose of family separation 
allowance is to compensate qualified members for added expenses incurred due to an enforced 
family separation. Family separation allowance-restricted applies when transportation of 
dependents is not authorized at government expense, and the dependents do not live in the vicinity 
of the member’s permanent duty station. Family separation allowance-temporary applies when a 
member is on temporary duty away from the permanent duty station continuously for more than 
30 days, and the member’s dependents are not residing at or near the temporary duty station, 
including members beginning temporary duty before reporting to the initial station of assignment.  
12.7. Station Allowances Outside the Continental United States 
Overseas station allowances are established to help defray the higher-than-normal cost of living 
or cost of procuring housing in overseas areas. Allowances authorized by the Department of 
Defense at certain overseas locations may include temporary lodging allowance and cost-of-living 
allowance. Members receive information regarding their specific entitlements during in- 
processing at the new location. Members may also receive information from their local finance 
office upon notification of a pending overseas assignment.  
12.8.  Basic Needs Allowance 
Provides a taxable monthly allowance for Airmen and Guardians who voluntarily apply and 
whose Gross Household Income (GHI) and household size places them below 150 percent of 
Federal poverty guidelines (FPG) for their geographical location. 
12.9.  Federal Tax Advantage 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
228 
 
 
 
Service members do not pay federal or state taxes on BAH or BAS which significantly increases 
their purchasing power for food and housing. In addition to the federal tax advantage, military 
members also enjoy combat tax exclusion and fully deductible mortgage interest. 
12.10. Continental United States Cost-of-Living Allowance 
The CONUS cost of living allowance is payable to members assigned to designated “high cost” 
areas within the CONUS. For additional information, see the DoD Financial Management 
Regulation (DoDFMR) 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 67, Military Pay Policy—Active Duty 
and Reserve Pay.  
12.11. Special and Incentive Pay 
A number of special and incentive pays recognize certain aspects of duty, such as hazardous duty 
incentive pay, imminent danger pay, special duty assignment pay, enlisted flying duty incentive 
pay, and hardship duty pay-location. Enlistment and retention bonuses are also considered as 
special and incentive pay. 
12.12.  Involuntary Deductions 
Involuntary deductions are payroll deductions of certain amounts of pay that are imposed by law. 
Examples of involuntary deductions are provided here.  
Withholding Income Tax. All pay is considered income for federal and state income tax 
purposes, to include basic pay, incentive pay, special pay, lump-sum payment of accrued leave, 
and separation pay. The LES reflects the current month and year-to-date income for social 
security, federal income tax, and state income tax purposes under the headings “FICA TAXES,” 
“FED TAXES,” and “STATE TAXES” in the middle of the form.  
Federal Insurance Contributions Act Taxes. The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) 
requires federal agencies to withhold FICA (Social Security and Medicare) taxes from the basic 
pay of military members covered by the Social Security Act and to pay matching FICA taxes to 
the Social Security Administration.  
Federal Income Tax Withholding. The Federal Income Tax Withholding (FITW) is used to 
provide for national programs, such as defense, community development, and law enforcement. 
A member may authorize an additional monthly amount of FITW. For additional information, the 
FITW complies with the Treasury Department Circular E, addressed in military service 
directives.  
State Income Tax Withholding. The State Income Tax Withholding (SITW) refers to state tax 
laws of the state where the member is a legal resident. The amount withheld depends upon the 
state tax rate. One-time payments may also be subject to state tax. The state for tax purposes is 
reflected in the first column on the LES under STATE TAXES.  
Armed Forces Retirement Home. Monthly Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) 
deductions from the pay of regular enlisted members, up to a maximum of $1, are set by the 
Secretary of Defense after consulting with the AFRH board. Deductions collected help support 
the U.S. Soldiers’, Airmen’s, and Naval Homes.  
12.13. Voluntary Deductions 
Military members may establish voluntary deductions, such as allotments to help administer 
personal finances, support family members, and insurance premium payments. Members may 
control certain discretionary allotments through myPay. Nondiscretionary allotments have limited 
uses, such as charitable contributions, loan repayments to the Air Force Aid Society, garnishment 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
229 
 
 
 
for commercial debts, and delinquent travel charge card debt. Members are not authorized to start 
allotments for purchase, lease, or rental of personal property.  
To allow for sufficient processing time, allotments should be requested 30 days before the desired 
month. Normally, if the member is paid twice a month, the allotment is deducted in equal amounts 
from the mid-month and end-of-month pay. If the individual receives pay once a month, the entire 
amount is deducted from the monthly paycheck.  
Thrift Savings Plan. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a voluntary deduction. It is a retirement 
savings and investment plan established for federal employees as part of the Federal Employees’ 
Retirement Act of 1986. The plan offers tax-deferred advantages similar to those in an individual 
retirement account or 401(k) plan. Traditional TSP contributions can be taken out of pay before 
taxes are computed, resulting in reduced individual tax obligations. Roth TSP contributions are 
taken out of pay after income is taxed. When funds are withdrawn at a future date, contributions 
will be tax-free since taxes were already paid on the contributions. 
A member is enrolled into the Blended Retirement System (BRS) if they enlisted on or after 1 
January 2018, and will be automatically enrolled in TSP at the level of 5% individual contribution 
from his or her monthly basic pay or inactive duty pay. The amount will be contributed to the 
member’s TSP account beginning with the first pay period following the member’s 60th day of 
service as calculated from the Pay Entry Base Date (PEBD).  
If a member is contributing to the TSP from basic pay, the member is authorized to contribute 
bonuses, incentive, or special pay. As of January 2023, the maximum TSP contribution amount 
is $22,500 for deferred and Roth contributions and up to $66,000 total combined deferred/exempt 
Traditional and Roth contributions. Members are not permitted to contribute more than 92 percent 
of their basic pay so that required deductions of social security and Medicare can be made.  
Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance. The Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) 
is a voluntary deduction. The maximum amount of SGLI coverage is $500,000 and members are 
covered, by law, at the maximum rate unless they decline or reduce coverage. SGLI automatically 
insures an eligible member against death when the member is on RegAF status and/or training for 
an ordered period of more than 30 days. However, an individual may choose less coverage in 
amounts divisible by $50,000 or elect no coverage, but he or she must do so in writing. 
Additionally, family SGLI covers spouses and dependent children when the eligible member also 
participates in SGLI coverage, including military spouses. There is a monthly deduction for 
spousal coverage, based on the amount of coverage. Each child is covered in the amount of 
$10,000 at no cost to the member. The member may not elect to insure any child for less than 
$10,000. SGLI and family SGLI premiums are deducted from members’ military pay each month. 
The military personnel section is the office of primary responsibility for administering the 
program.  
12.14. Financial Obligations 
Military members will pay their financial obligations in a proper and timely manner; provide 
adequate financial support of a spouse, child, or any other relative for which the member receives 
additional support allowances; comply with the financial support provisions of a court order or 
written support agreement; and respond to applications for involuntary allotments of pay within 
the established suspense dates. DAFI 36-2906, Personal Financial Responsibility, provides 
administrative and management guidelines and rules.  
Handling Complaints. Complainants are often unfamiliar with USAF organizational addresses 
or do not know the member’s actual unit of assignment, and so frequently address correspondence 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
230 
 
 
 
to the installation commander, Staff Judge Advocate, or force support squadron. Complaints are 
forwarded for action to the individual’s immediate commander and the complainant is notified of 
the referral. Commanders will attempt to respond within 15 days. Failure to pay debts or support 
dependents can lead to administrative or disciplinary action. Commanders must actively monitor 
complaints until they are resolved. If the commander decides the complaint reflects adversely on 
the member, this action should be included in the unfavorable information file. If the member has 
separated with no further military service or has retired, the complainant is notified and informed 
that the member is no longer under USAF jurisdiction and the USAF is unable to assist. Note: 
Retired members’ retirement pay can be garnished for child support or alimony obligations.  
Federal Government Collection of Debts. A USAF member who owes debts to the government 
does not have to give his or her consent for the USAF to collect. Generally, for debts exceeding 
$100, the individual must receive notification of the pending collection of a debt and be given a 
chance to repay the debt before any withholding action occurs. However, due process need not be 
completed before the start of a collection action if an individual’s estimated date of separation is 
not sufficient to complete collection and the USAF would be unlikely to collect the debt or when 
the collection action can be completed within two monthly pay periods. The USAF may also 
collect debts involving any federal agency, portions of a retention bonus not served, delinquent 
hospital bills for family members, excess shipment of household goods, loss or damage to 
government property, and erroneous payments made to or on behalf of the member by the USAF.  
Waiver and Remission Provisions. Military members may request relief from valid debts by 
applying for waiver or remission of the debt. The local financial services office has specific 
guidance and can provide assistance regarding these programs.  
Waiver of Claims for Erroneous Payments of Pay and Allowances. When a member receives 
erroneous pay or allowances, he or she may apply for a waiver of claims by the United States. A 
waiver may be granted when there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of 
good faith on the part of the member or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver 
of the claim. DFAS will rule on all waivers.  
Remission. A RegAF, separated member, or his or her commander, may apply for remission of a 
member’s indebtedness to the United States. The USAF may not remit or cancel any debt due to 
non-collection of court-martial forfeiture. In addition to the circumstances creating the debt and 
the issue of good faith on the part of the member, financial hardship may be a factor for 
consideration.

12.15. Authorized Expenses and Allowances 
Individuals are often expected to travel, whether associated with PCS or temporary duty, to 
include professional military education and training. Costs associated with official travel are often 
reimbursable, but individuals must understand and adhere to specific travel regulations accurately 
and within a timely manner. 
12.16. Permanent Change of Station Allowances and Expenses 
When military members are ordered to perform a PCS, there are travel allowances for expenses 
incurred related to transportation, lodging, household goods, etc. Individually billed account 
(IBA) government ravel charge card usage is authorized and highly encouraged for all PCS related 
expenses. Some of these allowances are addressed below. 
Permanent Change of Station Advance Payments. Advance payments of pay and allowances 
provide members with funds to meet extraordinary expenses directly related to a government- 
ordered relocation and not covered by other entitlements. A PCS advance payment is an advance 
of up to three months of basic pay, less mandatory deductions and debts currently being deducted. 
All Airmen who are E-3 and below must have approval of their immediate commander to receive 
advance pay. All Airmen who request a repayment period greater than 12 months or request an 
amount greater than one month’s basic pay, must have approval of their immediate commander. 
Repayment periods greater than 12 months are only approved in cases of financial hardship. 
Shipment of Household Goods. A member ordered on a PCS move may ship household goods 
within certain weight limitations at government expense. Authorized weight allowances normally 
depend on the grade of the member and number of dependents. A member may be reimbursed for 
personally arranging for the shipment of household goods. Claims should be prepared and 
submitted according to service instructions. The government cost limit is based on the member’s 
maximum household goods weight allowance. If the member transports household goods in excess 
of the authorized weight allowance, all payments are based on the authorized weight allowance. 
Dislocation Allowance. Dislocation allowance is paid at a rate determined by the Secretary of 
Defense and payable to all members with dependents when dependents relocate their household 
goods in conjunction with a PCS. It is also payable to members without dependents if they are not 
assigned permanent government quarters upon arrival at the new permanent duty station. 
Shipment of Unaccompanied Baggage. The shipment of unaccompanied baggage provision 
refers to the portion of the PCS weight allowance ordinarily transported separately from the major 
or bulk of household goods and usually is transported by an expedited mode. When the expedited 
transportation mode is commercial air, a maximum of 1,000 pounds (net), may be transported. 
Mobile Home Shipment. Members who own a mobile home should contact the traffic 
management office to arrange transportation in lieu of household goods transportation. In certain 
circumstances, members may arrange or contract personally for the movement of the mobile home. 
Shipment of Privately Owned Vehicle. When authorized, members may ship one privately 
owned vehicle at government expense when ordered to go on a PCS to, from, or between locations 
overseas. Privately owned vehicle storage may be provided or authorized when shipment is 
prohibited or restricted. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
232 
 
 
 
Government-Procured Transportation. Unless an authorizing/order-issuing official determines 
U.S.-certificated air carriers are unavailable, U.S.-certificated air carriers must be used for all 
commercial air transportation of persons or property when the government funds the air travel. 
Documentation explaining why U.S.-certificated air carrier service is not available must be 
provided to the traveler. Endorsements on the travel orders or government travel procurement 
document made in accordance with service guidance are acceptable. Travel time for travel by 
government conveyance (except government automobile) or common carriers obtained by 
government-procured transportation is allowed for the actual time needed to travel over the direct 
route, including necessary delays for the transportation mode used. 
Use of Privately Owned Conveyance. Uniformed service policy is to authorize/approve privately 
owned conveyance travel if acceptable to the member and advantageous to the government based 
on the facts in each case. Other allowable travel and transportation options include government 
conveyance or commercial carrier. Reimbursement of parking fees, ferry fares, road, bridge, and 
tunnel tolls are authorized for privately owned conveyance over the most direct route between the 
stations involved. The member is also authorized a flat per diem rate for each PCS travel day 
between authorized points, up to the allowable travel time. 
Personally Procured Transportation. Department of Defense policy mandates the use of the 
commercial travel office for all official transportation requirements. A member who, despite the 
policy, procures common carrier transportation at personal expense for official travel, is authorized 
reimbursement (except transoceanic travel in which no reimbursement is authorized) up to the 
amount authorized. However, reimbursement must not exceed the cost for the authorized 
transportation and accommodations over a usually traveled direct route according to a schedule 
necessary to meet the requirements of the order. Consult the Joint Travel Regulation for additional 
information. 
Mixed Modes. When both government-procured and personally procured modes of transportation 
are used, the USAF uses a combination of rules governed by the Joint Travel Regulation. The local 
financial service office can provide specific guidance. 
Dependent Travel. A military member receives monetary allowance in lieu of transportation and 
flat rate per diem for the official distance dependents travel with him or her by privately owned 
vehicle. If dependents purchase commercial common carrier transportation, the member may be 
reimbursed for the actual cost of the transportation, not to exceed the cost the government would 
have incurred for ordered travel, and the member receives a per diem allowance for dependents. 
When the USAF restricts travel of dependents to a location overseas, dependents may move at 
government expense to any approved/authorized change of station designated location within the 
CONUS or designated overseas location with special approval. 
Temporary Lodging Expense. A member arriving or departing PCS at a location within the 
CONUS may receive temporary lodging expense to help defray the added living expenses incurred 
while occupying temporary lodging. Temporary lodging expense is paid on a travel voucher. 
Temporary Lodging Allowance. A member arriving or departing PCS at a location outside the 
CONUS may receive temporary lodging allowance to help defray the added living expenses 
incurred while occupying temporary lodging. Temporary lodging allowance is paid in military pay 
and is reflected on the leave and earnings statement. 
12.17. Official Travel Reimbursement 
Travelers are responsible for electronically filing a voucher in the Defense Travel System (DTS) 
or preparing the DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher, to claim reimbursement for 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
233 
 
 
 
official travel within five business days upon return to permanent duty station. The traveler’s 
signature on the form indicates the claim is accurate, statements are true and complete, and the 
traveler is aware of the liability for filing a false claim. Electronic funds transfer is the mandatory 
means by which a travel claim is settled. The split disbursement option in DTS will be used. This 
option permits direct payment via electronic funds transfer to the GTCC vendor for charges 
incurred on the individually billed account. In cases where the traveler is temporary duty for 45 
days or more, an interim voucher or scheduled partial payments will be setup in DTS every 30 
days with split disbursements used to make on time payments. Extended temporary duty trips do 
not excuse on time payments of the GTCC bill. 
12.18. Temporary Duty Entitlements 
Per Diem. The per diem allowance helps defray the cost of quarters, meals, and certain incidentals. 
Per diem rates depend on the temporary duty location. Travelers are paid a prescribed amount for 
meals and incidental expenses plus the actual amount for lodging, not to exceed the maximum 
lodging rate for the specific location. The rates depend on the availability of government facilities, 
such as quarters and dining facilities. 
Transportation. Policy mandates that uniformed service members will use available commercial 
travel offices to arrange official travel. The mode of transportation used between the points 
designated in the travel order will determine the transportation entitlement. On the other hand, if 
the member receives authorization to travel at personal expense, he or she will receive a 
reimbursement limited to what cost the government would have incurred for the authorized mode 
of travel. For questions or concerns, consult the transportation office or commercial travel office 
for assistance. 
Miscellaneous Expenses. Reimbursable travel related expenses include travel from home or place 
of lodging to the servicing transportation terminal by taxi, limousine, bus, or privately owned 
vehicle. Additional miscellaneous expenses include passports, visas, and rental vehicles, when 
authorized on travel orders. 
12.19. Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) 
The GTCC program is intended to facilitate and standardize Department of Defense travel, 
providing travelers a safe, effective, convenient, commercially available method to pay for 
expenses incident to official travel, including local travel. The travel card is used to improve cash 
management, reduce administrative workloads, and facilitate better service to travelers. In 
addition, because of the refund feature of the travel card program, the program results in cost 
savings for the Department of Defense. 
Agency Program Coordinators (APC). An APC is an individual (uniformed member, 
employee, contractor, or foreign national) designated in writing by a commander or director as 
responsible for the management of the GTCC program. APCs are responsible for managing the 
travel card program within their hierarchy. Department of Defense GTCC Regulation describes 
policies and procedures set forth through the DAF GTCC program. 
Card Use. Unless otherwise exempted, all Department of Defense personnel are required to use 
the government-sponsored, vendor-issued GTCC for all expenses arising from official 
government travel. These expenses include lodging, transportation expenses, local ground 
transportation, and rental car expenses authorized on travel orders. Cardholders, while in an official 
travel status, may use the card for non-reimbursable incidental travel expenses, such as rental 
movies, personal telephone calls, exercise fees, and beverages when these charges are not part of 
a separate room billing or meal. The cardholder is required to pay all charges (whether 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
234 
 
 
 
reimbursable or non-reimbursable) via split disbursement. 
Cash advances may be made with the GTCC to pay for travel-related expenses. Automated teller 
machine advances will not be obtained earlier than three working days before scheduled travel and 
are limited to authorized expenses exempt from mandatory card usage (meals, incidentals, and 
miscellaneous expenses). Transaction fees for automated teller machine use are part of the 
incidental expense portion of per diem and are therefore not separate reimbursable expenses. 
Permanent Change of Station Coordination. Individuals are required to use the GTCC during 
a PCS. Credit limit increases and deferred payment options are available to accommodate the 
extended travel times of a PCS move. GTCC bills must be kept current while in a PCS status. The 
cardholder must notify the losing APC before departing the old duty station and gaining APC 
upon reporting to the new duty station. The losing APC will update the travel card account to 
reflect “mission critical” status and set a future date in the travel card company’s system to 
deactivate the cardholder’s account based on the PCS travel order report no later than date. The 
APC will also submit a transfer request to the travel card vendor, so the individual is removed 
from that unit’s reporting hierarchy level. The gaining APC will ensure the transfer request is 
processed by the travel card vendor when the member arrives at the new station so the account 
information can be updated. The gaining APC will also clear the deactivation date within the 
travel card vendor’s system. 
How to Pay the Card Company. The travel card vendor provides detailed monthly bills to 
cardholders. Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of outstanding balances due in the 
monthly billing statement from the travel card vendor. Payments should be made promptly within 
the current billing cycle. Military service members must use the split disbursement feature in DTS, 
which automatically pays the credit card vendor for credit card charges incurred while on official 
travel. 
Card Abuse. The cardholder will only use the GTCC while in official travel status. Commanders 
or supervisors will not tolerate the misuse of the GTCC. Cardholders who misuse their GTCC are 
subject to appropriate administrative or disciplinary action. 
Delinquencies. Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of the amount stated on the 
monthly billing statement. Accounts that reach 31 days past due will be suspended and the 
cardholder will need to contact their respective agency program  coordinator (APC) to resolve the 
issue.  For accounts that reach 61 days past due, the GTCC vendor will send a due process letter 
and impending salary offset procedures directly to the cardholder.  The letter will advise intent to 
submit account for salary offset status unless the balance is paid in full within 30 days, or an 
acceptable Reduced Payment Plan has been reached between the cardholder and the GTCC 
vendor.    
The first late fee is charged at two cycles plus fifteen days past due (day 75) and then another fee 
is assessed each cycle thereafter, until the past due/delinquency amount is paid in full.  The travel 
card vendor will submit accounts that are 96 days past due for salary-offset processing to Defense 
Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS). DFAS will calculate the Salary Offset start and stop 
dates, and the number and amount of payments. Fees will also be added to the balance on the 
account when it is enrolled in Salary Offset and are not reimbursable.  Accounts 181 days past 
due will be considered in charged off status regardless of whether or not the cardholder is still 
enrolled in salary offset and payments are continuing to be made.  Cardholders in this situation 
are considered no longer eligible to be reinstated even when the balance is paid off.

12.20. Manpower Requirements 
Manpower is a constrained resource that comprises a significant portion of the USAF budget. All 
missions and programs compete for authorized military and civilian end-strength, and established 
grade distributions; therefore, must comply with guidelines as directed by Congress. Manpower 
must be programmed in accordance with validated manpower requirements, within fiscal limits 
and acceptable risks, as identified in defense planning and programming guidance. The Directorate 
of Manpower, Organization and Resources, Program Development Division allocates 
programmed manpower resources by command identifier, program element code, resource 
identification code, and country state code. These manpower resources are translated into 
manpower authorizations by updating the unit manpower document. 
Major commands should use means other than programmed manpower change requests to 
accomplish short-term mission or surge workload requirements, such as: (1) use available funds 
and command civilian employment plans to employ civilians; (2) use overtime, temporary full- 
time, part-time, or overhire of civilian personnel; (3) seek support from the Air Reserve 
Component via military pay appropriation funds; (4) utilize temporary duty military and civilian 
personnel; and (5) seek contract service. Changes to command-specific military and civilian 
manpower requirements must be validated and approved by HAF before they can be used in the 
programming and resourcing process. 
12.21. Determining Manpower Requirements 
Three types of manpower are used to conduct the USAF mission: military personnel, in-service 
civilian employees, and contracted services. In accordance with Department of Defense guidance, 
the services assign military personnel only to positions that directly contribute to the prosecution 
of war; are military by law, custom, or tradition; or are needed for overseas rotation, operational 
deployment augmentation, or career field sustainment. The USAF manpower requirements 
determination process systematically identifies minimum-essential manpower required for the 
most effective and economical accomplishment of approved missions and functions within 
organizational and resource constraints. Determining the correct military manpower required to 
meet the USAF’s most stringent wartime missions is key to the national military strategy. 
The defense planning guidance defines the planning scenarios used to size and shape the Total 
Force. Manpower requirements are sized for the most demanding phase of the scenario construct, 
including rotational forces needed for prolonged conflicts. These scenarios drive force structure 
and manpower military budgeting decisions. Manpower and organization flight personnel assist 
USAF commanders and functional managers by objectively quantifying manpower requirements 
for the distribution of USAF manpower resources. Key services of this competency include 
peacetime manpower standards development, wartime manpower requirements, and commercial 
services management actions, such as public-private competition, in-sourcing, and business 
process reengineering. 
12.22. Unit Manpower Document 
According to AFI 38-101, a manpower requirement is defined as the manpower needed to 
accomplish a job, mission, or program. A manpower requirement can be documented as a funded 
manpower authorization or an unfunded requirement. The Unit Manpower Document (UMD) is 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
236 
 
 
 
the primary document that reflects the manpower required to accomplish the unit mission. It is a 
computer-generated product that lists unit funded and unfunded manpower requirements used to 
help manage manpower resources. The UMD contains data elements that identify unique position 
attributes, to include position number, Air Force Specialty Code, functional account code, office 
symbol code, grade, personnel accounting symbol, and reason code. 
Supervisors should routinely check the UMD for accuracy and use it to track their authorized 
manpower strength. If a unit needs to change an existing requirement on the UMD, a manpower 
change request with justification is submitted to the servicing manpower organization. Approved 
changes to the UMD are reflected by a change notice generated by the manpower programming 
and execution system. 
12.23. Manpower and Organization Flight 
The installation Manpower and Organization Flight performs a variety of functions to help 
effectively manage manpower resources. The core competencies of manpower and organization 
encompass organization structure, requirement determination, program allocation and control, and 
process improvement. Personnel within the flight provide day-to-day manpower resource 
management services, to include: UMD management, assistance with manpower change requests, 
change notices, and organizational structure changes. Manpower and Organization Flight 
personnel also provide other management services, such as performance management, 
commercial activity services, the Airmen Powered by Innovation Program, continuous process 
improvement, and management advisory studies. 
12.24. Commercial Services Management 
Commercial Services Management is a program designed to improve USAF functions using a 
variety of management tools including competitive sourcing, in-sourcing, and post-competition 
accountability. The major command Manpower Organization and Resources Office is the 
manpower function responsible for providing commercial services management oversight at 
command levels and providing guidance to Manpower and Organization Flights for 
implementation of the Commercial Services Management Program at the respective wings. The 
three principal goals of the program are to sustain readiness, improve performance and quality by 
doing business more efficiently and cost effectively, and focus available personnel and resources 
on core USAF missions. Commercial Services Management will not affect military-essential skills 
or those functions that are inherently governmental. The Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency 
develops and maintains tools, templates, and guidebooks to enable the field to execute the 
Commercial Services Management Program, administers the inherently governmental/commercial 
activities inventory, monitors post competition accountability, and provides field support on 
Commercial Services Management initiatives. 
12.25. Competitive Sourcing Process 
Competitive sourcing generates savings by finding more efficient ways to accomplish a particular 
function. A competitive sourcing study is a public-private competition that compares the total cost 
of the in-house government operation of an activity to the total cost of private sector performance 
of the same activity to determine which is the most economical or efficient approach. 
In a competitive sourcing study, the mission remains essentially unchanged. It is the composition 
of the workforce that changes. Where blue suiters (military personnel) were initially performing 
the mission, the resulting service provider will be made up of either civil servants or private sector 
contract employees. A competitive sourcing study frees up military personnel to perform other 
core military essential activities. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
237 
 
 
 
In-sourcing. In-sourcing is the conversion of a contracted function to Department of Defense 
civilian or military performance, or vice versa. An in-sourcing business case analysis compares 
the cost of a contracted function to the cost of Department of Defense civilian employees to 
perform the same activity. Included in the business case analysis are certifications validating 
contract cost, in-house manning, available labor pool, and activity all meet the requirements of a 
valid and enduring mission requirement. Implementing the program permits the Department of 
Defense to convert contracts and provides special consideration for using Department of Defense 
civilian employees to perform functions currently performed by a contractor. This process is 
applicable when the function: (1) has been performed by Department of Defense civilian 
employees at any time during the previous 10 years; (2) is closely associated with the performance 
of an inherently governmental function; (3) has been performed pursuant to a contract awarded on 
a noncompetitive basis; and (4) has been determined by a contracting officer to have been 
performed poorly during the five years preceding the date of such determination, because of 
excessive costs or inferior quality. Note: In accordance with the Deputy Secretary of Defense 
memorandum for in-sourcing contracted services-implementation guidance, contracted functions 
found to be inherently governmental, exempt from contract performance, unauthorized personal 
services, or experiencing problems associated with contract administration shall be in-sourced 
regardless of cost.

12.26. Resource Requirements 
All USAF resources have a value or cost associated with them. The USAF resource management 
system is focused on outputs and resources used, managers effectively using resources, measuring 
actual performance compared to planned performance, and using financial plans and accounting 
to enhance management controls at each organizational level. The resource management system 
provides a way to establish priorities, choose policies, and act to get the desired results and required 
resources at acceptable costs. 
12.27. Resource management responsibilities 
Although base-level resource managers do not control initial allocation of all their resources, they 
must effectively manage these resources, including the stewardship of money, manpower, and 
equipment. Being an effective steward involves more than legal accountability. There are key duty 
positions associated with the resource management system that provide structure and alignment of 
resources and resource management. While every USAF member has a principal responsibility to 
ensure resources are used in the most cost-effective manner, commanders and supervisors are 
responsible for the efficient and economical use of all resources in their organizations, as well as 
the budgeting, allocation, composition, and distribution of these resources. 
Commanders. Commanders review, validate, and balance the financial plan to ensure successful 
financial management. Commanders must actively review financial programs for work centers 
(responsibility centers) and improve resource management by inquiring about program conditions, 
reviewing causes, weighing alternatives, and directing action. Commanders must also ensure 
resource management system success by allocating sufficient resources to resource management 
system training and resource management team efforts. 
Comptrollers. Comptrollers support the organization’s mission and the USAF by providing sound 
financial management and advice to commanders and staff. Comptrollers promote responsible and 
proper financial management to ensure efficient, economical use of resources consistent with 
statutory and regulatory requirements. Comptrollers apply policies and procedures that enable the 
organization to carry out accounting, budget, and cost functions. 
Responsibility Center Managers. Responsibility center managers plan, direct, and coordinate 
subordinate organization activities. Responsibility center managers analyze subordinate 
organizational plans, identify imbalances in resource distribution, analyze alternative actions, and 
balance programs. 
Cost Center Managers. The cost center is the basic production flight or work center. The cost 
center manager regulates the consumption of work hours, supplies, equipment, and services to do 
the tasks within their cost center. Cost center managers shift resources to or from various 
production tasks within the cost center to ensure the proper mix or to provide the emphasis 
required. 
Resource Advisors. Resource advisors monitor and help prepare resource estimates. They help 
develop obligations and expense fund targets, monitor the use of resources in daily operations 
compared to projected consumption levels, and serve as the primary point of contact on resource 
management matters pertaining to their responsibility center. Resource advisors are appointed in 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
239 
 
 
 
writing by the responsibility center manager. 
The Financial Management Board. Established by the senior or host commander at each base, 
the financial management board determines program priorities and ensures effective allocation of 
resources. The financial management board reviews and approves or disapproves 
recommendations made by the financial working group to ensure balanced, valid financial 
programs, and to consider all known or anticipated requirements. 
The Financial Working Group. Composed of both line and staff resource advisors and 
responsibility center managers, the financial working group manages commodities and resources 
integral to the operating activities of the base or unit. The financial working group develops 
requirements and revisions for the base or unit financial plan, reviews all appropriated fund 
financial plans, and makes recommendations to the financial management board for final approval. 
Additionally, the financial working group presents recommendations to the financial management 
board for unfunded requirement prioritization and fund target adjustments between responsibility 
centers and base-level budgetary guidance. The financial working group provides technical 
guidance to base activities on using their primary responsibility resources. 
Organizational Finance and Budgeting. The operating budget covers costs associated with the 
operation of all USAF organizations. The approval by higher headquarters gives obligation 
authority to accomplish the mission. The budget program operates on a fiscal year basis (1 October 
through the following 30 September). 
12.28. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Process 
The Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) Process is the Department of 
Defense’s resource allocation system. The ultimate objective of the process is to provide the best 
mix of forces, equipment, manpower, and support attainable within fiscal constraints according to 
DoDD 7045.14, The Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) Process. The 
goal of the process is to achieve the defense objectives established by the 
U.S. President and the Secretary of Defense outlined in the strategic planning and joint planning 
guidance. This system helps leaders establish and forecast a budget to ensure sufficient funds are 
available and increases management effectiveness by applying judgment and experience to 
programs, resource limitations, other program adjustments, and assessing alternatives for mission 
accomplishment. 
Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Phases. The PPBE process has a 
framework that decides on future capabilities and provides an opportunity to reexamine prior 
decisions in light of evolving threats, economic conditions, and security concerns. It consists of 
four interrelated and overlapping phases: planning, programming, budgeting, and execution. 
Planning. The USAF translates top-down guidance into plans and requirements for which a future 
year’s defense program can be developed. Planning defines and examines alternative strategies 
and analyzes external conditions and trends. During the planning phase, changes and long-term 
implications of decisions are examined. Streamlined planning and assessments help prioritize 
objectives, assess strategies, and provide the link between planning and programming. Planning 
also provides an objective against which the USAF can measure execution success. 
Programming. During the programming phase, planning policies and guidance are addressed, and 
initial program costs are established. By programming, the USAF matches available resources 
(fiscal, manpower, and materiel) against validated requirements to achieve the strategic plan and 
submit program proposals. The key objective of programming is to develop a balanced, 
capabilities-based Air Force Program Objective Memorandum (POM). In addition, the USAF 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
240 
 
 
 
defends the POM during program review and budget review and adjusts the program as a result of 
the Office of the Secretary of Defense reviews and changing national and international situations. 
While the USAF and other military departments link planned requirements with the resources 
needed to provide them, tradeoffs are inevitably involved beyond those in the planning process. 
Budgeting. The budgeting phase occurs concurrently with the programming phase. Each 
Department of Defense Component submits a proposed budget estimate simultaneously with a 
POM. The budgeting phase of formulation and justification provides a platform for a detailed 
review of a program’s pricing, phasing, and overall capability to be executed on time and within 
budget. The budgeting process principally addresses the years to be justified in the U.S. President’s 
budget. Three things happen in the preparation of the budget estimate submission. First, USAF 
budget analysts identify situations where the program has put USAF resources at risk of Office of 
the Secretary of Defense or congressional reduction. Second, the comptroller applies the latest 
inflation figures and flying hour and manpower rates, etc. Third, the program is put into the Office 
of the Secretary of Defense budget format and budget justification documentation is prepared. 
Once these steps are completed, the final position is called the POM/budget estimate submission 
or program budget review. The budgeting phase continues with the program budget review 
submission and fact-of-life changes via notification document in the off-year. 
Execution. The execution phase focuses on running the USAF day to day. Execution is carried 
out at applicable organizational levels. The USAF major commands and HAF are allocated their 
share of obligation authority to execute their missions in accordance with approved integrated 
priority lists for those programs that are centrally managed. Because the budget being executed in 
any given year was actually compiled over a year earlier, some assumptions on which the budget 
was based will have changed. Because change is anticipated, Congress allows some flexibility 
within the operating budgets to move resources without requiring their permission, but installations 
are expected to execute to the integrated priority list for centrally managed programs. One key part 
of the execution phase is the major command operations and maintenance operation plan. USAF 
program execution is reviewed during the budget execution reviews in February, April (concurrent 
with the internal USAF mid-year review), and July. 
12.29. Future Years Defense Program 
The Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) is a database that summarizes forces, resources, and 
equipment associated with all Department of Defense programs. The program displays total 
Department of Defense resources and force structure information in three basic dimensions: the 
organizations affected (military departments and defense agencies), appropriations accounts 
(research, development, test, and evaluation; and operation and maintenance), and major force 
programs (strategic forces and mobility forces). The FYDP is updated twice during the PPBE 
Process cycle, first upon submission of the POM (usually July/August), and again upon submission 
of the U.S. President's budget (early February the following year). The FYDP is composed of 11 
major force programs and over 3,600 active program elements designed to categorize functional 
or organizational entities and their related resources. 
12.30. USAF Equipment Management System 
The USAF equipment management system provides worldwide visibility of all equipment assets 
throughout the USAF. The system helps to support reporting capitalized asset depreciation, 
determining equipment requirements based on USAF allowance standards, supporting the budget 
and buy program, and identifying equipment types and quantities required to accomplish the 
mission. USAF allowance standards identify specific items and quantities approved by the 
functional manager for units to use during wartime and peacetime operations. These allowance 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
241 
 
 
 
standards are accessible online from the USAF Equipment Management System and the 
Allowance Standard Retrieval System website. 
Responsibilities. The USAF’s mission makes it imperative that all military and civilian personnel 
operate and maintain government systems, equipment, supplies, and real property in the best 
possible condition, readiness, and in the absolute minimum quantity necessary to accomplish 
assigned tasks. Additionally, Airmen at all levels must accurately maintain property records to 
reflect a current inventory and condition of property; ensure personnel carefully and economically 
use and safeguard property; provide adequate security, protection, and storage for property; and 
make recommendations for preventing fraud, waste, and abuse. Ultimately, USAF members must 
have supply discipline to conserve, protect, and maintain available government supplies, 
equipment, and real property for operational requirements. 
Commanders and Supervisors. Commanders and supervisors at all levels are responsible for 
prudent management, control, storage, and cost-effective use of government property under their 
control. Commanders and supervisors establish controls to eliminate uneconomical equipment 
management, ensure all personnel are taught proper care and safeguard principles, and enforce 
these principles. Commanders must properly manage public property under their control, provide 
instructions to subordinates on specific responsibilities, and maintain records that may be audited. 
Commanders appoint representatives, designate property custodians and facility managers, and 
ensure the representatives attend the proper training offered by logistics readiness squadrons. 
Property Custodian. A property custodian is appointed by an accountable property officer, 
commander, or chief of staff agency to accept responsibility for property and are directly 
responsible for the physical custody, inventory, accounting, and reconciliation of items on the 
account. A custodian may be held financially liable for the loss, theft, destruction, or damage of 
any property or resources under his or her control and must report property losses or irregularities 
to commanders or accountable officers at the time of discovery. For additional information on 
property custodians and property management, refer to DoDI 5000.64, Accountability and 
Management of DoD Equipment and Other Accountable Property, and AFI 23-111, Management 
of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force. 
Installation Responsibilities. The installation commander has overall responsibility and 
accountability for the operation of a USAF installation. The major command and installation 
commander, assisted by the base civil engineer, are responsible for developing, operating, 
maintaining, and controlling the use of USAF facilities in compliance with applicable Department 
of Defense and USAF policies and procedures. They are also responsible for developing 
comprehensive asset management plans, identifying facility lifecycle requirements, implementing 
applicable common levels of service, assessing the impact of asset condition on mission support 
through the use of key performance indicators, and developing and executing real property 
construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization programs. 
Base Civil Engineer Squadron Responsibilities. The base civil engineer is charged with 
providing, operating, maintaining, restoring, and protecting the built and natural infrastructure 
necessary to support the USAF mission. As such, the base civil engineer serves as the focal point 
for all construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization of facilities identified as real 
property and associated real property installed equipment. The base civil engineer’s customer 
service unit typically manages the installation’s facility manager program, to include providing 
initial and recurring training for facility managers. Facility manager training covers facility 
manager roles and responsibilities and identifies the processes and procedures required for 
submitting work requests. 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
242 
 
 
 
Civil Engineer Work Requests. The base civil engineer’s customer service unit receives and 
reviews all incoming work requests for validity, verifies scope, and ensures the work request is 
coordinated with the appropriate agencies, such as fire, safety, and environmental. If the work 
request is approved, it will be executed in-house based on priority by the operations flight or as a 
contract managed by the engineering flight. Work requests will be identified to the customer 
service unit by the facility manager utilizing the AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, 
or designated information technology systems. 
Direct Scheduled Work. Direct scheduled work is a request that does not need detailed planning 
and can be sent directly to the required shop for execution. An example of a direct scheduled work 
is fixing a leaky faucet. 
Planned Work. Planned work requests are typically complex and require detailed planning, 
scheduling of multiple shops, and lead time for material acquisition. An example of planned work 
is relocating a doorway and associated exit signs to accommodate a new layout. 
Emergency Work. Emergency work is defined as work that corrects an issue that poses an 
immediate threat to mission, life, safety, or health and will be identified to the customer service 
unit. Emergency work requests should be requested and accomplished by the quickest means 
possible, to include verbal or phone communication. 
12.31. Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Prevention 
The USAF loses millions of dollars every year due to individuals abusing the system, wasting 
precious resources, and committing acts of fraud. Preventing fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) is of 
primary concern. While detection and prosecution serve to deter fraudulent, wasteful, or abusive 
practices, the key element of the program is to prevent the loss of resources. The Secretary of the 
Air Force, Inspector General, provides policy guidance, develops procedures, and establishes and 
evaluates the Air Force Complaints. In turn, the IG at every level is responsible for establishing 
and directing these programs. 
Fraud. Fraud is defined as any intentional deception designed to unlawfully deprive the USAF of 
something of value or to secure from the USAF for an individual benefit, privilege, allowance, or 
consideration to which he or she is not entitled. Fraud may also be considered to be any theft or 
diversion of resources for personal or commercial gain. 
Waste. Waste is defined as the extravagant, careless, or needless expenditure of USAF funds or 
the consumption of USAF property that results from deficient practices, systems controls, or 
decisions. Waste also includes improper practices not involving prosecutable fraud. Wartime and 
emergency operations, legitimate stockpiles, and wartime reserves are not considered waste. 
Abuse. Abuse is defined as the intentionally wrongful or improper use of USAF resources. 
Examples of abuse include misuse of rank, position, or authority that causes the loss or misuse of 
resources, such as tools, vehicles, computers, or office equipment. 
Fraud, Waste and Abuse Complaints. USAF personnel have a duty to promptly report FWA to 
an appropriate supervisor or commander, to an IG or other appropriate inspector, or through an 
established grievance channel. FWA complaints may be reported to the Air Force Audit Agency, 
the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), security forces, or other proper authorities. 
Individuals may submit complaints of FWA by memorandum, in person, or by FWA hotlines. 
Complaints may also be submitted anonymously. 
As with personal complaints, USAF members should try resolving FWA issues at the lowest 
possible level using command channels before addressing them to a higher level or the IG. Making 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

a disclosure or complaint requires factual, unbiased, and specific information. Individuals must 
understand they are submitting official statements within USAF channels. Therefore, they remain 
subject to punitive action or adverse administrative action for knowingly making false statements 
and for submitting other unlawful communications. 
Complainant Privacy. The complainant’s privacy is safeguarded to encourage voluntary 
cooperation and to promote a climate of openness in identifying issues requiring leadership 
intervention. The IG has the responsibility to safeguard the personal identity and complaints of 
individuals seeking assistance or participating in an IG process, such as an investigation. While 
this does not mean the communications made to an IG are privileged or confidential, it does mean 
that disclosure of those communications and the identity of the communicant is strictly limited to 
an official need-to-know basis, when required by law or regulation, when necessary to take adverse 
action against a subject, or with Secretary of the Air Force, Inspector General approval. 
Whistleblower Rights. Whistleblower witnesses have additional rights. The nature of the 
allegation and findings will determine what information is releasable. All information released is 
according to Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act. “Third-party” complainants are not 
entitled to a response regarding alleged wrongs not directly affecting them unless authorized to 
receive via a Freedom of Information Act or a Privacy Act release. 
12.32. Financial Liability Investigation 
Upon the discovery of loss, damage, destruction, or theft of government-owned property (real or 
personal) of any value, the immediate supervisor within the chain of command shall conduct an 
informal inquiry to determine if the situation warrants a formal investigation. An investigation 
shall be conducted for all loss, damage, destruction, or theft of government-owned equipment with 
an initial acquisition cost of $5000 or greater; all sensitive, classified, or leased (capital lease) 
property, regardless of initial acquisition cost; and any real property. However, investigations may 
also be conducted when circumstances warrant, such as when the loss, damage, destruction, or 
theft of small amounts of property occur frequently enough to suggest a pattern of wrongdoing. 
The DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, is required documentation 
for investigations and is used to document the facts and circumstances of the loss, damage, 
destruction, or theft. For additional information on the financial liability investigation program, 
refer to DoDR 7000.14, Financial Management Regulation, Volume 12, Chapter 7, Financial 
Liability for Government Property Lost, Damaged, Destroyed, or Stolen.

12.33. Environmental Responsibilities 
The USAF is a leader and devoted guardian of the environment. As trustee to over 8 million acres 
of natural habitat, the USAF takes considerable measures to defend and enhance America’s rich 
natural resources and cultural heritage. Over the last 20 years, the USAF has followed a 
compliance-based approach to environmental management resulting in an unparalleled record of 
responsiveness to regulation, community interests, and ecological needs. 
Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century is aimed at establishing an environment in which 
all Airmen are actively eliminating waste and continuously improving processes. AFI 32-7001, 
Environmental Management, implements the environmental management system framework and 
provides guidance and procedures applicable to all USAF installations within the United States 
territories and foreign countries. 
12.34. Environmental Management System 
The Department of Defense, as the nation’s largest user of federal lands, consumers of energy, and 
operators of large industrial complexes, must strive to ensure efficient operations while reducing 
its environmental footprint. All USAF commanders, supervisors, and process owners shall 
integrate environmental considerations into daily work activities and at all levels of decision- 
making for current or proposed actions that may adversely impact the environment. The 
environmental management system is a set of processes and practices that enable a reduction in 
environmental impact and an increase in operating efficiency. 
Environmental Management System Priorities. Three priorities of the environmental 
management system are: compliance, risk reduction, and continuous improvement. Compliance 
will be maintained with all environmental legal obligations and regulatory guidelines. Risk 
reduction will be achieved through a standardized approach to protect USAF assets, personnel, 
and material by effectively identifying and managing risks from environmental encroachment. 
Instilling a culture that encourages and supports continuous improvement will reduce 
environmental impacts and regulatory burden. 
Environmental Management System Phases. The environmental management system is 
designed with four phases to help the USAF at all levels maintain compliance with environmental 
goals and obligations as outlined in DoDI 4715.17, Environmental Management Systems. 
Phase 1: Plan. The planning phase includes determining the management system’s scope, 
environmental policy and commitment statement, environmental aspects and impacts, legal and 
other requirements, objectives and targets, and action plans. Effective planning allows the 
installation’s leadership to focus resources on mitigating risks that present the greatest threat to 
mission capability. 
Phase 2: Do. The doing phase includes an environmental risk reduction strategy for 
environmental aspects associated with the processes or activities that generate pollutants. Each 
facility shall identify opportunities to optimize selected business, operational, or industrial 
processes or activities in terms of pollutant reduction, lower energy use, reduction in the use of 
natural resources, water conservation, and improvements to health and safety. 
Phase 3: Check. The checking phase includes environmental monitoring and measuring to 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
245 
 
 
 
increase leadership awareness of compliance issues, identify and analyze trends of non- 
conformance and non-compliance, identify areas for improvement, provide lessons learned to 
prevent similar non-compliance at other installations, and to minimize or avoid environmental 
litigation risks. 
Phase 4: Act. The acting phase includes the management review to assess the suitability, 
adequacy, and effectiveness of the management system. 
12.35. Environmental Management System Guidance 
Program areas identified and outlined in AFI 32-7001 and other environmental AFIs include 
environmental protection initiatives aligned with Department of Defense and USAF policies and 
programs. Program areas include air quality; water supply; hazardous materials; hazardous waste; 
solid waste; toxic substances; petroleum, oil, and lubricants; storage tanks; pest management; 
cultural resources; natural resources; environmental planning; environmental restoration; 
environmental baseline surveys; and overseas compliance policy. 
12.36. Environmental Compliance 
The Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) is responsible for managing the USAF 
compliance, restoration, sustainability, and National Environmental Policy Act programs. AFCEC 
provides HAF, major commands, and installations with environmental compliance support, 
delivering the compliance programming and execution expertise, core knowledge and leadership 
required to ensure USAF installations comply with regulatory programs related to air emissions, 
water quality, wastewater discharges, hazardous waste generation, and natural and cultural 
resource management. AFCEC also serves as the central point for collection and analysis of 
environmental data in various program areas. The AFCEC team includes subject matter experts 
and program managers in various fields and specialties related to environmental operations, 
including regulatory compliance, environmental restoration, hazardous waste management, 
pollution prevention, and environmental assessments.

13.1.   Managing the Work Environment 
Organizational management is the process of organizing, planning, leading, and controlling 
resources within an entity with the overall aim of achieving established goals. Organizational 
management provides leaders the ability to make decisions and resolve issues effectively for the 
benefit of the organization and its employees. 
While some enlisted members may think of strategic thinking as “above their pay grade,” thinking 
strategically is important when establishing goals, and planning how to achieve them, within any 
unit or work center. Strategic thinking can be applied at any level, across an entire enterprise or on 
a specific project. 
13.2. Strategic Thinking 
Strategic Thinking refers to thinking on both a large and small scale, long- and short-term to identify 
and achieve desired goals. 
When retired USAF general officers were asked to think of the Airmen they had worked with 
during their career who most exceled at Strategic Thinking, they indicated that those Airmen 
exceled at: 
Identifying best and worst-case scenarios for how a situation might be resolved 
Considering how other stakeholders would be affected by proposed courses of action 
Viewing issues from the perspective of more senior leadership (“work your boss’s problems”) 
Identifying a realistic time horizon for achieving goals and building on small successes 
(“Thought BIG. Started small. Scaled fast.”) 
13.3. Strategic Thinking Mindset 
Airmen at all levels should adopt a strategic thinking mindset as they approach issues within their 
organization. Strategy sets priorities, goals, objectives, and key performance indicators 
(metrics/measures) that are aligned from the lowest echelon to the highest, and ensures all Airmen 
are marching down the same Path, toward the same Target. When the current state of performance 
is not reaching the target level, continuous improvement methods such as Lean, Six Sigma, or 
Theory of Constraints, may be used to address identified issues. Refer to DoDI 5010.42, DoDD-
Wide Continuous Process Improvement (CPI)/Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Program and DoDI 5010.43,  
Implementation and Management of the DoD-Wide Continuous Process Improvement/Lean Six 
Sigma (CPI/LSS) Program, for more on improvement methods to ensure a culture based in 
strategic mindsets. The three fundamental components of a strategic thinking mindset are: 
Intellectual Flexibility. A willingness and proclivity to adjust one’s understanding, opinions, or 
approach when conditions change, or new information is presented. 
Flexibility is about bending, not breaking; we can adapt and adjust without abandoning long-term 
strategy and starting from scratch. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
247 
 
 
 
For example, imagine a request for members of your unit to receive critical training is denied for 
budgetary reasons. Rather than ignoring the need for training, or simply continuing attempts to 
get approval for the original request, you should consider other options. Perhaps just one of your 
Airmen could receive the training and then teach the rest of the unit?  Maybe there are other units 
nearby whose members have received the training who would be available to teach your Airmen? 
Intellectual Inclusiveness. Welcoming of information and opinion from a broad range of sources 
(individuals, groups, disciplines of study, etc.). 
A broad, informed perspective often requires many voices to be involved in a discussion, and a 
willingness to consider new or seemingly unusual sources of information. 
Look beyond your immediate organization. Make use of formal and informal networks and reach 
out to others with relevant expertise. Maybe you have peers from past assignments who have dealt 
with similar issues? Maybe you have contacts within the other Services, or former instructors or 
classmates who could share relevant information and expertise. 
Intellectual Humility. Comfort level with being wrong or having an incomplete understanding, 
accompanied by the tendency to check oneself, examining issues as if one’s understanding is wrong in 
some way. 
13.4. Strategic Thinking in Action 
In practice, strategic thinking consists of four main activities: scanning, questioning, 
conceptualizing, and testing: 
Scanning is the identification of emerging patterns in the environment. This consists of taking in, 
deconstructing, and synthesizing information from different sources, with the goal of applying this 
information to the future. Example scanning techniques could include seeking input from an expert 
panel and analyzing historical data to identify trends. 
Questioning (asking questions of others and oneself) is needed to more fully understand an issue 
from different perspectives. This includes framing issues broadly, exploring problems rather than 
aiming to solve them immediately, and considering input from all stakeholders. 
Conceptualizing potential options is needed to identify possibilities for future direction. This 
includes identifying a broad range of options (brainstorming), using various analytic tools and 
techniques to explore potential solutions, and rejecting options only after exploration. 
Testing allows for informed speculation to anticipate the impact of a proposed action on 
organizational performance. For example, one might initially conduct a role play of how the 
proposed course of action would be communicated to stakeholders and how they are likely to 
respond. The proposed solution should be tested on a small scale (a pilot test), in order to evaluate 
its initial impact and to address any problems that arise in the initial implementation. 
 
 
 
13.5. Results Focus 
At the individual and team level, optimal performance requires setting goals to stay on track. But 
not all goals are alike. Goal setting is most likely to improve performance when goals are Specific, 
Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART). 
S – Specific: Specific objectives/targets should answer who is involved, what is to be 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
248 
 
 
 
accomplished, where it is to be done, when it is to be done, which requirements and constraints 
exist, and why (purpose) the objective is being accomplished. 
M – Measurable: Establish criteria for measuring progress toward and attainment of each 
objective/target/milestone until the desired objective is met. 
A – Attainable: Ensure applicable resources are available and objectives/tasks (within acceptable 
levels of risk), are possible. It may also be helpful to use action-oriented statements rather than 
passive voice. Note: The term “Attainable” does not imply that goals should be easy to attain. 
Research has consistently found that setting difficult or challenging goals improves performance 
more than setting goals that are easy or only moderately difficult to meet. 
R – Relevant: Link to the mission, vision, and goals and ensure they are meaningful and relevant 
to the user. Good objectives must be obtainable, yet purposeful. 
T – Time-Bound: Provide date for completion. Targeted dates provide periodic and overall 
accountability. 
While goal setting can improve both individual and group performance, interdependent work may 
require a focus on how individuals contribute to the group (“group-centric” goals). Goals that are 
strictly focused on maximizing individual results (“ego-centric” goals) may backfire when 
collaboration is needed. 
For example, managers may set numeric goals for help desk technicians to resolve a certain number 
of help desk tickets each month. “Egocentric” goals for each individual employee to resolve a 
certain number of tickets may disincentivize support to other team members, such as training and 
coaching new team members. “Group-centric” goals for an entire work unit to resolve a certain 
number of tickets may be more likely to increase overall performance, by inherently incentivizing 
both processing tickets individually and providing support that will help other team members 
resolve tickets as well.

13.6. Resource Management 
Improving performance requires both planning and execution. For organizational change to be 
effective, planning and execution generally must include redesign or coordination on the following 
five interrelated fronts. 
Organization and People. Human resources are the key to future viability and organizational 
growth in a continuous learning environment. Although processes and other front factors may 
change, focus should remain on providing workers with appropriate knowledge, skills, 
experiences, and tools. 
Technology. Technology is a crucial enabling factor that allows compression of cycles, lead time, 
distance, and broader access to information and knowledge assets. Technology also eliminates 
barriers between customers and suppliers. 
Policies, Legislation, and Regulations. Changing existing policies, regulations, and legislation 
may be required for new processes. 
Physical Infrastructure. Physical facilities, equipment, and tools should be designed to support 
and maximize changes in workflow, information technology, and human resources. 
Process. The flow of work and information into and throughout the organization must be 
redesigned using standard continuous process improvement methodologies. Refer to DoDD 
5010.42, DoD-Wide Continuous Process Improvement (CPI)/Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Program and 
DoDI 5010.43, Implementation and Management of the DoD-Wide Continuous Process 
Improvement/Lean Six Sigma (CPI/LSS) Program, for more continuous process improvement 
methodologies. 
 
13.7.  Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and 
Facilities (DOTMLPF) 
The acronym, DOTMLPF is used by the Department of Defense to describe a thought process that 
considers a broad spectrum of elements or requirements to generate informed, conclusive solutions 
to problems, future requirements, strategic direction, and performance improvement. DOTMLPF 
is defined as a process that considers solutions involving any combination of these elements. 
DOTMLPF serves as a valuable mnemonic for staff planners to consider for certain issues prior to 
undertaking new efforts. Because combatant commanders define requirements in consultation with 
the Office of the Secretary of Defense, they are able to consider gaps in the context of strategic 
direction for the U.S. Armed Forces and influence the direction of requirements earlier in the 
acquisition process. Here is an example of how DOTMLPF would be interpreted in the military 
context: 
Doctrine: The way we fight (emphasizing maneuver warfare, combined air-ground campaigns). 
Organization: How we organize the fight (divisions, air wings, task forces). 
Training: How we prepare to fight tactically (basic military training, advanced individual training, 
unit training, joint exercises). 
Materiel: All the ‘stuff’ necessary to equip the forces (weapons, spares) so we can operate 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
250 
 
 
 
effectively. 
Leadership and Education: How we prepare leaders to lead the fight from squad leaders to four 
stars (professional development). 
Personnel: Availability of qualified people for peacetime, wartime, and various 
contingency operations. 
Facilities: Real property, installations, and industrial facilities (government owned ammunition 
production facilities) that support the forces. 
13.8. Organizational Structure (Balancing Precision with Flexibility) 
Organizational design should be determined based on the organization’s overall mission and strategy, 
taking into consideration the environment, size, and pace of technology. 
In determining how an organization should be structured, it is important to balance the need for 
precision (need to maintain order, decrease ambiguity, and ensure direction is followed) with the 
need for flexibility (potential need to adapt quickly and encourage innovation). 
The pros and cons of various organizational structures are briefly described here. 
Mechanistic (Bureaucratic) Structure. A mechanistic or bureaucratic organizational structure is 
vertically arranged; communication and decision-making begin at the top and then filter downward. 
In this type of organizational structure, there is very little involvement of low-level members in 
decision-making, employees work in teams based on task specialty, and there is a heavy reliance on 
rules. The mechanistic system lends itself well to an organization where strategy or goals are geared 
toward efficiency and tasks need to be accomplished quickly and accurately. A stable environment 
that requires little flexibility is often conducive to a mechanistic structure. Also, if the size of an 
organization is intermediate to large, more structure may be necessary. Unfortunately, organizations 
with a mechanistic structure may find that job satisfaction suffers because subordinates basically do 
as they are told with little to no contribution to how things are done. 
Organic Structure. An organic organization has horizontal and vertical communication, 
allowing communication to occur up and down as well as across departments and among co-
workers without bureaucratic lines. Cross-talk and opinions are encouraged among employees to 
allow more involvement in decision-making and contribution into how things are done. The 
flexibility involved in day-to-day operations facilitates technological advancements and allows 
employees to be more adaptable as changes arise. The organic organization’s strategy is often 
geared toward innovativeness and creativity. The computer software industry is a good example 
of one that requires a creative design. The environment is unstable, with change being the norm 
rather than the exception. Organizations with organic structure are most often small to moderate, 
apply new technology through adaptation rather than compliance, and employ research and 
development that is creative rather than restrictive. The sharing of information and the 
participative environment increases worker satisfaction and often produces well- rounded 
decisions. Unfortunately, an organic structure may slow down the implementation process, lead 
to low efficiency, and reduce standards. 
Diverse Structure. Because there are advantages and disadvantages of mechanistic and organic 
organizations, organizations with a diverse design incorporate both mechanistic and organic 
structures to accomplish the mission. The diverse design is used when the organization needs the 
rigid structure of the mechanistic organization in some areas and the flexibility of the organic 
organization in others. For example, administrative sections often have specific rules to follow 
when processing performance reports, decorations, and orders. For this purpose, a mechanistic 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
251 
 
 
 
system would be appropriate. In the same organization, a training section may be hindered by a 
rigid mechanistic system; therefore, an organic system would be more effective to allow for more 
frequent innovation in how training is delivered.  
Matrix Structure. The matrix design is basically an organizational design or team within a 
mechanistic, organic, or diverse organization. A matrix design is usually best for addressing a 
temporary need within an organization; therefore, it is short-lived, and the overall organizational 
structure remains intact. A matrix design brings workers from different sections or organizations 
together to serve a particular function. Within the matrix design, employees or team members 
have two bosses; the functional boss writes their performance report and schedules normal duty 
hours, and the project boss or team leader ensures the task at hand is accomplished appropriately. 
The strength of the matrix design lies in the pooling of expertise and resources; the weakness lies 
in the confusion of who is in charge.

13.9. Change Management 
Change is inevitable. We know changes are taking place every day, all around us. Change is 
appropriate when there is a perceived gap between what the norms are and what they should be. 
Organizational change is not automatic. It is the deliberate adoption of a new idea or behavior by 
an organization and the establishment of new norms. These norms can involve technology, tasks, 
structure, and resources, including people. First, leaders must do their part to create an 
organizational climate conducive to change by explaining the limitations or shortfalls of the 
present process and the possibilities and benefits of the proposed change. Training to become a 
part of necessary change is available to problem solvers and practitioners of continuous process 
improvement, which all Airmen should strive to become. Airmen of all skills and jobs should 
possess a mindset of critical thinking and problem solving as their first duty. As an Airmen 
matures, their career path should include basic, fundamental, intermediate, and Master level 
education for change management and continuous process improvement. Next, leaders must 
facilitate the change itself by walking Airmen through the change, explaining the details, and 
answering questions. Finally, leaders should show appreciation for those who contribute to the 
change and help refocus those who do not. Tough-minded, realistic optimism is the best quality a 
leader can demonstrate when coping with change. 
Resistance to Change. The first reaction to change is often perceived as resistance. An essential 
element for preventing or overcoming resistance to change is establishing a well thought out plan. 
Planning enables the change agent (the person advocating for or leading the organizational change) 
to build confidence, anticipate questions, develop courses of action, and address opposing 
perceptions. Five of the most common responses to change are briefly described here. 
Distrust. Imposed change that significantly affects an organization will often be met with tough 
questions to ensure the change purpose and intent is clearly understood. Leaders who are not 
prepared to clarify or explain thought processes behind the change will not easily overcome 
employee doubt and will struggle to gain employee buy in. 
Uncertainty. When faced with impending change, people may experience fear of the unknown 
or see the change as a threat to organizational stability and their job security. Employees may 
wonder if they will still have a job, if they will be able to do the new job, or if they will have to 
learn a new program or process. 
Self-interest. People often consider the position they currently have or their role in the existing 
environment and question the direction and capabilities of those in positions of power after the 
change is implemented. 
Different Perception/No Felt Need to Change. Even if you think people recognize the need for 
change, they may see the situation differently, particularly if the change has been dropped on them. 
Maintain an environment of open communication to build support for the change and reduce the 
amount of employees who inwardly resist it. 
Over-Determination. Ironically, organizational structure may be a barrier to change. For 
example, a mechanistic structure that relies on strict procedure and lines of authority may be so 
rigid that it inhibits change and possibly damages professional relationships. 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
253 
 
 
 
13.10. Reducing Perceived Resistance to Change 
Successful change management depends on addressing causes of resistance and improving the 
change implementation process. There are several approaches leaders can take to implement 
change successfully.  
Education and Communication. Open communication is necessary throughout the change 
process and helps reduce uncertainty. Educating people about the need for and expected results of 
a change should reduce resistance. 
Participation and Involvement. Leaders reduce resistance by actively involving those affected 
in designing and implementing change. Involving people in the change process helps generate 
ownership and commitment to the change. 
Facilitation and Support. Leaders should introduce the change to employees gradually and 
provide additional training, if needed. Reinforcement and encouragement help facilitate the power 
of high expectations throughout the organization. 
Negotiation and Agreement. Leaders may choose to offer incentives to those who continue to 
resist the change. In difficult times, negotiated agreements can help focus and remind employees 
of the changes agreed upon as the change process progresses. 
Coercion. Coercion is a forcing technique used to make employees accept change. Coercion can 
negatively affect attitudes and can potentially cause long-term negative consequences. Coerced 
compliance is not recommended and requires constant leadership oversight to ensure the change 
remains in effect. 
13.11.  Three-Stage Change Process 
Although there are a wide range of various change processes, the change process model proposed 
by renowned social psychologist, Kurt Lewin, recommended leaders view change as a three-stage 
process: unfreezing, changing, and refreezing. In the three-stage change process, leaders (change 
agents) must analyze restraining or opposing forces and devise ways to reduce them to overcome 
resistance. At the same time, leaders must recognize and strengthen supporting forces, which are 
those forces pushing toward change. After analyzing the forces for and against change, and 
developing a strategy to deal with them, leaders can attend to the change itself. 
Stage 1: Unfreezing. Once the need for change is recognized, the three-stage change process 
begins with unfreezing. Unfreezing is a deliberate management activity to prepare people for 
change by knowing and going where issues may exists. The most neglected, yet essential part of 
unfreezing is creating an environment where people feel the need for change. A key factor in 
unfreezing involves making people knowledgeable about the importance of a change and how it 
will affect their jobs or the overall organizational structure. By pointing out problems or challenges 
that currently exist in the organization, leaders are able to generate a need in the people who will 
feel the greatest effect of the change. 
Stage 2: Changing. After unfreezing, the next stage in the three-stage change process is changing. 
The changing stage involves modifying technology, tasks, structure, or distribution of people. 
During the changing stage, the organization moves from the old state or the previous norms, to the 
new state by installing new equipment, restructuring work centers, or implementing procedures. 
In short, changing is anything that alters the previously accepted status quo. The change agent in 
this stage is essential. 
Change needs to be monitored as it occurs by paying close attention to the people most affected 
by the change. Signs of implementing the change too early may include negative reactions from 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
254 
 
 
 
employees. In some instances, systems are not completely ready, and production may bog down. 
Be prepared to receive and respond to feedback in any number of forms to ensure the change 
unfolds as successfully as possible. Being involved and available throughout the process will allow 
leaders to react quickly to issues as well as provide support to employees who are dealing with the 
issues of the change firsthand. Encouragement and involvement in the changing stage may be very 
similar to that applied during the unfreezing stage. Note: It is a leader’s responsibility to be 
receptive to the needs of the organization and its employees. Readdressing unfreezing techniques 
is better than forcing a change that causes more problems than it resolves. 
Stage 3: Refreezing. The third and final stage in the three-stage change process is refreezing. 
After implementing a change, it is time to lock in (or refreeze) the desired outcomes and the new 
norms so they become permanent. Actively encouraging and reinforcing the use of new techniques 
is a way of helping the new behavior stick. A critical step in refreezing is remaining engaged and 
evaluating results to determine if the change reached the desired effect or if the new process needs 
more support, instruction, training, or time. Positively reinforcing desired outcomes is crucial 
during the refreezing stage. Rewarding people when they do something in alignment with the 
change emphasizes the value of the new procedures or behaviors and helps freeze them into place. 
Highlighting successful change helps reduce the desire to return to the old way of doing things. In 
many cases, the change agent can call attention to the success of the change and show where it 
works while also being receptive to feedback and areas that may cause lingering issues or 
continued frustration. In this case, the change agent must evaluate results, reinforce the desired 
outcomes, and make constructive modifications, as needed. 
13.12. Continuous Improvement 
The use of Continuous Improvement (CI) increases operational capabilities while reducing 
associated costs by applying proven methodologies to all processes associated with fulfilling the 
USAF mission. CI is a comprehensive philosophy of operations built around the concepts that there 
are always ways a process can be improved to better meet mission/customer requirements, 
organizations must constantly strive to make those improvements based on performance metrics 
that align to strategic objectives, and efficiencies should be replicated to the extent practical. CI is 
a hallmark of highly successful organizations, is an Airmen Leadership Quality, is a both a 
commander’s responsibility (AFI 1-2, Commander’s Responsibilities), and is a major graded area 
in the Air Force Inspection System (AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System), and a focal 
point within the Air Force Standards within Air Force Core Values ‘Excellence in all we do’ (AFI 
1-1, Air Force Standards). 
Continuous Improvement Methodologies. USAF CI incorporates aspects of four major 
methodologies to assist with organizational change. A practical problem-solving method may 
simultaneously draw from more than one of these CI processes. 
Lean. Lean is a methodology focused on workflow, customer value, and eliminating process 
waste. Lean is unique from traditional process improvement strategies in that the primary focus is 
on eliminating non-value-added activities. 
Six Sigma. Six sigma is a rigorous, data-driven methodology for process improvement focused 
on minimizing waste through identifying, controlling, and reducing process variation. 
Business Process Reengineering. Business process reengineering is a comprehensive process 
requiring a change in the fundamental way business processes are performed. Business process 
reengineering identifies unnecessary activities and eliminates them wherever possible. Business 
Process Reengineering allows great opportunity to empower airmen to be innovative Airmen can 
strategically align and implement agile, innovative ideas into newly designed processes to give 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
255 
 
 
 
the DAF the competitive edge. 
Theory of Constraints. Theory of constraints is a systematic approach to optimize resource 
utilization by identifying, exploiting, subordinating, elevating, and reassessing constraints 
(bottlenecks) in the process.  
13.13. Practical Problem-Solving Method 
At the core of USAF CI is the practical problem-solving method, a standardized and structured 
approach to problem solving used by global industry leaders and adopted by DoD. The practical 
problem-solving method, as shown in Figure 13.1., is an eight-step process used to clarify 
problems, identify root causes, and develop appropriate countermeasures to achieve change. Note: 
The Osborn-Parnes convergent and divergent thinking techniques described in this handbook’s 
chapter on Developing Ideas can be useful during many steps in this process. 
Figure 13.1. Practical Problem Solving Method 
Step 1: Clarify and Validate the Problem. The first step to effective problem-solving is to 
clearly understand the problem, often best accomplished by developing a problem statement. A 
well-defined problem statement uses data to identify where the problem is occurring, determine 
the impact of the problem, and compare performance against a standard with scope and direction. 
A problem statement does not assume a root cause, solution, or countermeasure, but should include 
visual tools to depict the current state. The who, what, when, where, and significance of the 
problem statement should be validated by data. This is done by collecting and analyzing data to 
validate the existence and magnitude of the problem. If data does not exist, the effort should be 
paused to collect and analyze the needed data before moving forward. This step incorporates the 
Mess Finding, Data Finding, and Problem Finding aspects of the Osborn-Parnes model. 
Step 2: Break Down Problem and Identify Performance Gaps. Understanding what 
appropriate data is required and the ability to interpret that data is paramount to performance gap 
analysis. Step 2 effectively frames and supports the problem in Step 1. Once the problem statement 
has been identified and answers the who, what, when, where, and significance of the problem, 
further analyze the data in comparison to the expected outcome. The expected outcome is the 
objective from which to measure the gap between the current state and end state (the expected 
outcome) and highlight opportunities for improvements (also called the performance gap). 
Step 3: Set Improvement Targets. USAF leaders establish a vision of what an organization will 
strive to become (the ideal state). In Step 3, process owners or project managers set improvement 
targets based on expected outcomes and strategic goals and objectives. Targets help define the 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
256 
 
 
 
required performance levels to achieve the desired end state. Targets should be challenging but 
achievable. 
Step 4: Determine Root Cause. USAF leaders often find themselves addressing problems which 
have been solved many times when previous problem-solving efforts were directed at symptoms 
of a problem rather than root causes. Root cause analysis often involves applying a tradeoff 
between digging as deeply as possible as opposed to finding the deepest point within the team’s 
sphere of influence. The correct root cause should be validated by using the same data used to 
define the problem in Step 1. 
Step 5: Develop Countermeasures. Step 5 is where potential root causes are addressed with 
countermeasures. Consideration should be given to the most practical, efficient, and effective 
countermeasures. Valid countermeasures will close performance gaps and should move the 
organization closer to the ideal state. When developing countermeasures, strive for process 
improvement change that is sustainable and repeatable. At the end of Step 5, obtain a vector check 
to ensure strategic alignment with the desired outcome is still moving in the appropriate direction. 
Remember, the impact of a solution is a combination of the quality of the solution and the 
acceptance of the solution by people who implement it. Judiciously involving employees in the 
development of countermeasures generates buy-in and ownership of the solution and its success. 
This step incorporates the Idea Finding, Solution Finding, and Acceptance Finding aspects of the 
Osborn-Parnes model. Note: Techniques discussed in this handbook’s chapter on Developing 
Ideas can be particularly useful when developing countermeasures. Defer judgment and allow a 
period of time to let ideas flow freely (brainstorm potential countermeasures, even those that may 
seem odd or unusual) before evaluating and selecting a solution. 
Step 6: See Countermeasures Through. Step 6 is seeing countermeasures through to execution 
and tracking detailed implementation plans for each countermeasure approved in Step 5. Reviews 
and progress checks should be updated regularly on all tasks until countermeasures have been 
implemented, or until deemed unnecessary. 
Step 7: Confirm Results and Process. Step 7 compares the results of implemented 
countermeasures to the identified performance gaps, improvement objectives/targets, and the 
expected outcome. Sustainability and repeatability of the improved process should be verified. 
Results are measured by data and analyzed to confirm the project’s intent. Processes should be 
monitored for performance relative to the baseline developed in Steps 1 and 2, relative to targets 
established in Step 3, and relative to the solution implementation. Illustrate confirmed results with 
appropriate data tools which link back to performance gaps and improvement targets. Incorrect 
root-cause determination is the most common mistake made during CI efforts. If targets are not 
met, it may be necessary to return to Step 4. 
Step 8: Standardize Successful Processes. Step 8 is the most commonly neglected step of the 
entire practical problem-solving method; however, it is important to ensure the results of the efforts 
made in previous steps are codified. In Step 8, consider the answers to following three questions: 
What is needed to standardize the improvements?  Possible answers may include a submission 
to the Airmen Powered by Innovation Program or change requests for technical orders, 
instructions, manuals, materiel, and suppliers. 
How should improvements and lessons learned be communicated?  The wing process manager 
should be made aware of the success. Inputting information into the USAF CI portal, conducting 
key meetings, writing publications, utilizing public affairs, informing the chain of command, or 
populating data collection sites. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
257 
 
 
 
Were other opportunities or problems identified by the problem-solving model?  This project 
may have identified additional problem-solving opportunities that should be recognized and 
addressed. 
13.14. Levels of Problem Solving 
Consistently applied, the Practical Problem Solving Method provides an excellent tool for making 
data-driven decisions with regard to management, process change, and the sharing of best 
practices, ensuring actions lead to the desired results with minimal waste. It also ensures the results 
are aligned with the needs of the organization. Three different levels of effort are available for 
accomplishing this method initiative. As a standardized template for solving problems and 
performing process improvement initiatives, the Practical Problem Solving Method is flexible 
enough to be effective at any of the following three levels. 
Just Do It: Also called point improvement, the ‘just do it’ approach involves one person (or a 
small team) and can be accomplished in less than a day. Examples could be using torque wrenches 
instead of adjustable wrenches or routing paperwork electronically rather than through physical 
distribution channels. 
Rapid Improvement Event: A rapid improvement event consists of a small team of individuals, 
usually subject matter experts, and can be accomplished in less than a week. It is designed to 
develop and implement countermeasures after appropriate project preparations have been made. 
Examples could be improving aircraft servicing cycle times or improving first-time pass yields on 
task management tool taskers. 
Improvement Project: The ‘improvement project’ setting requires a large team and is conducted 
over a longer period of time. Examples could be shortening aircraft annual overhaul cycle time or 
writing software to track annual overhauls. 
13.15. Project Management 
Although there are many definitions of project management, for the purpose of this reading project 
management is defined as the process of leading, coordinating, planning, and controlling a diverse 
and complex set of processes and people in the pursuit of achieving an established objective. With 
this definition in mind, it is important to emphasize that a project is not a program; programs are 
ongoing. A project is temporary, based on an established objective that has a generalized time frame 
attached to it. 
Project Management Steps. Project management uses a unique array of terminology to identify 
and communicate its principles and uses. Basic terminology is primarily found in the steps of 
project management and is explained below. 
Define the Project Objective. Identify the objective or improvement to be achieved by the 
project. What is being satisfied by the project?  What is the expected outcome? 
Develop Solution Options. How many ways might you go about solving the problem?  Of the 
available alternatives, which do you think will best solve the problem? 
Plan the Project. Planning is nothing more than answering questions—what must be done, by 
whom, how, for how much, when, and so on. 
Execute the Plan. People sometimes go to great lengths and effort to put together a plan, but 
then fail to follow it. Follow your plan. 
Monitor and Control Progress. The project manager must monitor and control by being 
present and making appropriate decisions. This is where to determine whether or not the plan was 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
258 
 
 
 
sound and make adjustments. Are we on target?  If not, what must be done?  Should the plan be 
changed/modified?  What else have we learned? 
Close the Project. Once the objective has been achieved, there is still a final step that should 
be taken. Document and discuss lessons learned—what went well, what didn't, and what should be 
addressed.  
13.16. Project Management Constraints 
Constraints are numerous for all activities we endeavor, but constraint consideration is crucial for 
project management. Quality, time, and cost are among the main constraints most often realized in 
project management. 
Quality. Quality refers to being in accordance with the requirement - the specifications. 
Time. Time refers to the amount of time you have to complete the project. 
Cost. Cost refers to your resource constraints, to include money, manpower, machinery, and 
materials. 
One of the constraints (Quality, Time, or Cost) will be your driver for the project. The driving 
constraint for your project will have an impact on the other two constraints. Ensure you take this 
into consideration when making decisions about the project's objective and adjust the 
management of your project accordingly. It is incumbent upon a project manager to provide 
leadership and use good team-building techniques to establish a sound project objective and 
generate the solution options necessary to achieve those objectives. 
13.17. Project Management Planning 
Once options are developed, the most important and time-consuming aspect of project management 
must occur—planning the project. Planning a project involves activities that answer the questions 
who, what, when, where, and how. Techniques of special importance to use during planning are 
gathering important information, creating a work breakdown structure, and conducting a task analysis. 
Regardless of the method of planning used, the completion of the tasks in a sense of order and 
timeliness, made foreseeable through the task analysis, ensures project completion is more likely to 
succeed. 
Work Breakdown Structure. A work breakdown structure is a technique based on dividing a 
project into sub-units or work packages. Since all the elements required to complete the project 
are identified in the work breakdown structure, the chances of neglecting or overlooking an 
essential step are minimized. A work breakdown structure is typically constructed with two or 
three levels of detail, although more levels are common, depending on the complexity of a project. 
Such a structure for your project will permit you and others who see the work breakdown structure to 
readily identify what needs to be done, spot omissions which might later affect the outcome of the 
project and make suggestions for improving and expanding the work breakdown structure. The 
amount of breakdown is an element the project manager and the project team must decide upon. 
Task Analysis. Similar to the work breakdown structure, the amount of detail needed for a task 
analysis depends on the task involved and the desires of the project manager and project team. The more 
complex the project, the greater the importance of detailed task analysis. Information contained in 
the task analysis, which is not depicted in a work breakdown structure, includes task milestones, 
how the milestones can be measured, and resources or requirements. Project managers may delegate 
the task analysis for each task to the appropriate person. Once compiled, final decisions on task 
assignments and budgetary concerns can be addressed. The task analysis is what provides the 
crucial information for determining how the tasks of the project interrelate. It is imperative to establish 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
259 
 
 
 
the proper sequencing of tasks prior to beginning a project to ensure the efficiency of the project.

14.1.  Team Building 
Dynamic is a way of describing elements of a process or system; it is a term used to recognize 
constant change, activity, or progress. Dynamic can also be used to describe a force that stimulates 
change or progress. As Airmen, we must know and understand our leaders, peers, and 
subordinates. In team environments, we must know the right approaches to building effective 
teams and cultivating a healthy, dynamic team spirit. The spirit in which a team operates will 
influence every stage of team development and can ultimately determine whether goals are met. 
Healthy teams are high performing teams that most often have a foundation of trust, 
communication, and cooperation. While each is essential in building a healthy team spirit, trust is 
at the core of all healthy team interaction. Team members must feel comfortable with, and 
confident in, one another to be able to fully participate. Positive group member behavior is 
essential for a team to accomplish its goals. Team members usually take some time to form strong 
bonds for trust, communication, and cooperation. There are typically stages that teams experience 
before rising to the level of becoming highly functional, productive teams. 
Trust. Effective teamwork requires a high degree of trust. Team members must share mutual 
confidence in the integrity and ability of teammates. They also need to feel comfortable enough to 
take risks, think outside the box, and share their thoughts and ideas without fear of being shut down 
or discounted. Freedom to communicate openly, honestly, and directly within the group is the 
hallmark of a trust-based team. Individuals must understand the importance of utilizing effective 
communication skills to develop the level of trust needed for the teams to grow. 
“Nothing reduces trust in a group faster than members saying one thing within 
the group and something else outside the group. When members are assertive enough 
to say what they need to say directly to the appropriate people and to refrain from 
talking behind each other’s backs, trust is enhanced.” 
Suzanne Zoglio 
Teams at Work 
Creating trust among team members requires professional working relationships, professional 
behavior, and a desire to achieve established objectives. Dialogue and feedback must be 
exchanged between members in an open and sincere manner without fear of harsh criticism. Team 
members should respond to one another with receptivity to inputs, and information sharing. It’s 
true…there’s honesty and then there’s brutal honesty. Feedback, critical thinking, and 
disagreements can be exchanged among team members without being brutally honest or 
offensive. Leaders can promote a trusting atmosphere by encouraging open and honest 
communication. Leaders empower their teams to solve problems innovatively through a shared 
sense of collaboration that is free of selfish goals. Leaders should focus their efforts on setting the 
right tone for developing trusting relationships, communicating openly and honestly, knowing, 
and establishing a good rapport with team members, and discouraging cliques or divisions within 
the team. In other words, team leaders should set the example and lead by example.  
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
261 
 
 
 
Communication. Teams must communicate. Team members need to safely assert themselves 
and share their ideas. Teams that don’t allow honest, open sharing quickly lose their effectiveness. 
As a result, some team members may purposely withhold vital information or disengage from the 
team. This may cause confusion, frustration, and the inability to complete tasks within teams. 
While sharing information between team members is essential in producing effective, well 
thought out plans, leaders must be willing to share information with team members. When leaders 
hold on to information, they can create an inaccurate, incomplete, or totally wrong picture of the 
expected outcome to team members. Information sharing yields better results. Leaders can 
increase team success by giving members complete access to all necessary data, discouraging the 
discounting of ideas and feelings, and encouraging the practice of active listening.  
Cooperation. Cooperation is critical if teams are to combine skills and approaches to meet the 
challenges, customer requirements, and mission changes. Cooperation yields synergistic results 
and reduces the exerted effort it takes to reach a desired outcome. Leaders who encourage 
cooperation show team members that others have very important contributions to the goals of the 
team. Team members may also come to understand how dependent they are on one another in 
reaching mission objectives. Successful teams have few turf wars, little competitiveness, and an 
ability to forgive and forget. Cooperation breeds shared ownership for performance results, and 
achieving objectives increases team pride and team spirit. A sign that a team is not performing 
cohesively is when unhelpful competition exists among team members. This may be observed 
when some team members attempt to outshine others to gain extra attention or credibility. When 
a member of a team demonstrates “all-starring” behavior, they may be experiencing a power 
struggle. To reduce power-play behavior, leaders should reemphasize each team member’s 
specific roles and responsibilities, which eliminates potential barriers to cooperation. 
14.2.  Stages of Team Building 
The typical stages or team dynamics that groups or teams experience are normal and often 
inevitable. The four stages most often experienced by teams are: forming, storming, norming, and 
performing. 
Forming. Forming is the initial period of uncertainty in which individuals try to determine their 
place on a team and establish or accept the procedures and rules of the team. When a team is 
forming, members cautiously explore the boundaries of acceptable group behavior in various 
ways. The forming stage is when the transition from individual to member status occurs and when 
a leader’s guidance may be tested, both formally and informally. 
Storming. During the storming stage, conflicts begin to arise as members tend to resist the 
influence of the team and rebel against accomplishing the task. Storming is probably the most 
difficult stage when some team members begin to realize the task is different and more difficult 
than they initially expected. Impatient about the lack of progress, but still too inexperienced to 
know much about decision-making or the scientific approach, members argue about just what 
actions the team should take. Team members may try to rely solely on their personal experience, 
thus avoiding the need for collaboration with other team members. Regardless of tensions, during 
the storming stage, team members are beginning to understand one another. 
Norming. During the norming stage, team members establish cohesiveness and commitment, 
discovering new ways of working together and setting norms for appropriate behavior. During the 
norming stage, members reconcile competing loyalties and responsibilities and begin to accept the 
team, team ground rules (norms), and their roles in the team, and the individuality of fellow 
members. Emotional conflict is reduced as competitive relationships become more cooperative. 
As the team begins to work out their differences, they focus more time and energy on the team 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
262 
 
 
 
objective. 
Performing. In the performing stage, the team develops proficiency in achieving its goals and 
becomes more flexible in its patterns of working together. By the performing stage, the team has 
settled its relationships and expectations and can begin diagnosing and solving problems and 
choosing and implementing changes. At last, team members have discovered and accepted each 
other’s strengths and weaknesses and learned and embraced their roles. In the performing stage, 
the team can be considered to be an effective, cohesive, and productive unit. 
14.3. Conflict Management 
Conflict is inevitable in every organization and is often necessary to reach high levels of 
performance. Conflict involves differences between parties that result in interference or 
opposition. Such differences can cause positive change or can decrease productivity. Positive 
conflict results in addressing problems for a solution, greater understanding, and enhanced 
communication between individuals or groups. Conflict can be constructive when managed 
effectively. Conflict becomes destructive when it results in barriers to cooperation and 
communication, thus degrading morale and diverting attention from tasks. At times, managers 
tend to avoid conflict because of possible negative repercussions; however, managing conflict 
effectively benefits the organization by reducing ambiguity and stimulating productivity by 
constructively looking at alternatives. 
14.4. Sources of Conflict 
Conflict is defined as extended struggle or disagreement. This can lead to frustration of an 
important concern, whether real or perceived. Many factors may result in or increase the 
probability of conflict within an organization. These factors manifest themselves in combination 
with other factors, making it potentially difficult to identify the specific source of the conflict. 
Conflict often originates with one or more of the following situations.  
Communication Factors. Communication often gets the blame for problems that occur in the 
workplace; however, the real crux of the problem is more likely to be miscommunication. For 
example, communication or even over-communication may occur within an organization, and 
when the communication is misinterpreted, inaccurate, or incomplete it can lead to frustration and 
stress. For personnel to perform at their very best, they need constructive, understandable, and 
accurate information.  
Structural Factors. The larger the organization, the more people there will be to potentially cause 
and participate in conflict. Resources, whether scarce or under high demand, may generate 
conflict as parties posture to compete for the resources. The more people interact, the more 
noticeable their differences become. When dealing with line-staff distinctions, this can lead to 
disputes, partly because although people may attempt to participate, it does not necessarily mean 
their contributions are heard, valued, or accepted. Leaders should encourage employees to 
challenge the status quo, seek better ways of doing business, and continually improve processes. 
Also, rewards programs can potentially encourage and develop a healthy competition as long as 
the rewards aren’t perceived as unfair, unjust, or biased in some way. 
Personal Behavior Factors. Conflict can arise because of individual differences, such as goals 
and objectives, perceptions, values, and personalities. If we align our personal needs and values 
with the overall USAF mission, we will be more aptly willing to change, set aside self-interests, 
listen to the ideas of others, and reduce conflict. Although not always easy, striving to align 
personal values with USAF values can reduce conflict that arises based on differences that exist 
in the workplace. Addressing issues through a realistic or even positive perspective rather than 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
263 
 
 
 
being based on emotion will lead to fewer arguments and more professionally driven 
performance. Personality conflicts and differences among employees will always exist, but the 
way we respond to them does not have to be unprofessional or disruptive to the organization. 
14.5. Conflict Management Techniques 
There are a few techniques that can be used to minimize the impact that workplace conflict can 
have on individuals and on the organization. When considering the degree of cooperation, and the 
degree of assertiveness of those involved, leaders can determine how to categorize conflict and 
how to best manage it. Cooperation refers to how willing a person or group is to satisfy the other’s 
needs. Assertiveness refers to how active a person is in addressing the conflict. Using an approach 
addressed by Dr. Kenneth Thomas, author of Conflict and Negotiation Processes in 
Organizations, there are five major conflict management styles and categories, defined based on 
the levels of cooperation and assertiveness associated with any given situation.  
Competing (Forcing). (High assertiveness and low cooperativeness). The competing (forcing) 
style attempts to overwhelm an opponent with formal authority, threats, or the use of power.  
Collaborating. (High assertiveness and high cooperativeness). The collaborating style uses an 
attempt to satisfy the concerns of both sides through honest discussion. Creative approaches to 
conflict reduction, such as sharing resources, may actually lead to both parties being materially 
better off. For the collaborating style to be successful, trust and openness are required of all 
participants. Collaborating involves behavior that seeks a ‘win’ position for both groups.  
Accommodating. (Low assertiveness and high cooperativeness). The accommodating style often 
simply consists of giving in to another person’s wishes.  
Avoiding. (Low assertiveness and low cooperativeness). The avoiding style appears to indicate a 
neutral position of participants which can often lead to ‘things working themselves out,’ but can 
also result in an escalation of a situation by allowing it to go unresolved.  
Compromising. (Some assertiveness and some cooperativeness). The compromising style 
requires a willingness of both parties to change, adjust, or give something up. Compromising 
involves behavior that seeks to partially satisfy both parties’ desires and resolves the conflict. 
Note: All situations are unique, depending on the individuals involved, the criticality of the issues, 
and the urgency of the situations. When considering each of the conflict management styles, 
consider the who, the stakes, and the situation to determine the best approach to take to resolve 
conflict. 
The USAF Negotiation Center (https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/AFNC/) has additional 
resources on negotiation and conflict management.

14.6. Leadership Responsibility 
Leadership is often indicated by a person’s title or position of authority. But leadership is an 
ability we can all develop, cultivate, and expand upon. Merriam-Webster’s dictionary defines the 
word lead as, “to guide on a way especially by going in advance” or “to direct on a course or in a 
direction.” A military leader is considered to be, “a person who directs a military force or unit” 
or “one who has commanding authority or influence.” Leadership, as a moral quality put into 
action through a command or leadership role, can serve to move mountains…or move people 
over, around, or through mountains, whichever is required.  
Another way of looking at leading in the USAF can be recognized as the art and science of 
accomplishing the USAF mission by motivating, influencing, and directing Airmen. This 
highlights two central elements, the mission, objective, or task to be accomplished; and the 
Airmen who will accomplish it. The science of leadership being observed and studied refers to 
the methods and understanding of what leadership is. The art of leadership, being personal and 
subjective, refers to the demonstration and application of leading. 
14.7. Leadership and Management 
While leadership and management are separate topics in many respects, they go hand in hand in 
producing elements that promote mission success. Organizations need a strong balance of both. 
“Management is getting people to do what needs to be done. Leadership is getting 
people to want to do what needs to be done.” 
Warren G. Bennis, Ph.D. 
A leader is a person who leads or commands a group, organization, or country. Terms often 
associated with leadership roles include flight leader, team leader, and squad leader. Warren G. 
Bennis, Founding Chair, The Leadership Institute, University of Southern California, labeled 
three primary behavioral leader characteristics as the abilities to motivate, develop, and inspire. 
Under this model, leaders motivate and inspire people to interact and understand one another as 
they move in the right direction by satisfying human needs for a sense of belonging 
(belongingness and love), recognition (esteem), self-esteem (esteem), and control over their lives 
(safety and security) which can lead to a sense of achievement (self-actualization). The model 
developed by Warren Bennis echoes Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory (Figure 
14.1.) for motivation which outlines the road to self-actualization.  
Abraham Maslow was a well-known psychologist who specialized in the theory of psychological 
health. He is most famous for his theory on the Hierarchy of Needs which outlines basic 
requirements that must be achieved before ultimately reaching self-actualization or fulfilling your 
highest potential. Based on Maslow’s theory, in order to attempt success at one level, you must 
be successful in the previous. For example, if you are hungry or thirsty (physiological needs), you 
will not be able to focus on building relationships (belongingness) until you have food and water. 
This theory translates to the work environment as the individuals who are concerned about 
keeping their job security will not be able to focus on striving for achievement, which will 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
265 
 
 
 
ultimately prevent them from reaching their full potential (self-actualization). 
Figure 14.1. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs 
A manager is a person responsible for controlling or administering all or part of a company or 
organization. Terms often associated with managerial roles include career field managers, major 
command functional managers, program managers, and project managers. Bennis labeled three 
primary behavioral characteristics of managers as administrators, maintainers, and controllers. 
Under this model, managers focus on tasks a level of control to guide people in the right direction. 
Generally, managers ensure the resources needed are readily available and effectively used. 
Leaders launch and steer the organization toward the pursuit of goals and strategies. 
Managers are responsible for organizing projects, staffing positions with qualified individuals, 
communicating plans, delegating responsibilities, and devising systems to monitor 
implementation. Leaders support these actions by aligning personnel needs, wants, emotions, and 
aspirations with the task. 
Good management brings a degree of order and consistency to key issues like readiness, 
availability, and sustainment. Good leaders lead people to accomplish the mission. 
The best managers tend to become good leaders because they develop leadership abilities and 
skills through practicing good management techniques. Similarly, an effective leader will often be 
found to be a good manager. 
14.8. Professional Associations 
Private organizations develop professional skills and associations for individuals in many career 
fields and technical specialties. Membership in such associations may provide additional 
opportunities for leadership roles, public speaking, and mentoring, as well as broadening technical 
expertise. Many units have unofficial organizations, such as the squadron booster club and event 
planning committees. There are also organizations that tailor membership based on rank, such as 
the Junior Enlisted Airmen Council, 5/6 Council, Top III, and the Chiefs’ Group. Taking an active 
role in these organizations is highly encouraged for personal and professional development.

14.9. The Leader as a Mentor 
Mentoring is a process of helping each individual reach his or her maximum potential. USAF 
leaders have an inherent obligation and responsibility to mentor future leaders. Through 
mentoring, senior leaders pass on their experience and wisdom to junior members as well as 
philosophy, traditions, shared values, quality, and lessons learned.  
Commanders and supervisors must be positive role models and make themselves available to 
Airmen who seek career guidance, counsel, and mentorship. They must take an active role in their 
Airmen’s professional development by continually challenging them to grow, develop, and 
improve. At a minimum, a supervisor’s mentoring consists of a discussion of performance, 
potential, and professional development plans during performance feedback sessions. 
Conversations should address promotions, professional military education, advanced degree 
work, physical fitness, personal goals and expectations, professional qualities, future assignments, 
and long-range plans. 
“We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give.” 
Winston Churchill 
Mentoring is an ongoing process and perhaps the most powerful method leadership can use to 
shape the future. It helps prepare Airmen for the increased responsibilities they will assume as 
they progress in their careers. At all stages of career development individuals would benefit from 
the counsel of a mentor. Mentors are often appreciated more than they know. 
14.10. The Air Force Mentoring Program 
The Air Force mentoring program covers a wide range of areas, such as career guidance, 
professional development, leadership, USAF history and heritage, airpower doctrine, strategic 
vision, and contributions to joint warfighting. But individuals must first focus on USAF 
institutional needs. The USAF must develop people skilled in the employment and support of 
airpower meeting national security needs.  
Mentors must distinguish between individual goals, career aspirations, and realistic expectations. 
Each individual defines a successful career, goal, or life accomplishment differently. There are 
numerous paths to meet individual career and success goals. Although the immediate supervisor 
or rater is the primary mentor, coach, counselor, guide, or role model, Airmen may seek additional 
counseling and professional development advice from other sources or mentors as well. While 
there are several approaches mentors can take in the form of coach, counselor, advisor, and 
advocate, USAF mentoring is governed by DAFMAN 36-2643, Air Force Mentoring Program. 
14.11. The Mentoring Process 
The mentoring model, M – E – N – T – O – R – I – N – G, demonstrates the concepts of effective 
mentoring. The elements of effective mentoring, described below, correspond to the letters in the 
word itself.  
Model. An effective mentor, serving as a role model, understands that actions speak louder than 
words. The protégé constantly observes and learns from the mentor. The opportunity to see how 
the mentor deals with a variety of situations is an important part of the mentoring process.  
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
267 
 
 
 
Empathize. Mentoring requires the ability to empathize and show genuine compassion for 
protégés. Mentors who remember what it was like when they were new and inexperienced may 
be more effective in assisting others in their professional development. Empathy cultivates bonds 
between mentors and protégés and fosters the mutual commitment that exemplifies mentoring.  
Nurture. Nurturing emphasizes a caring attitude. Like a farmer tends to the field, the mentor 
nurtures the protégé, by investing time, patience, and effort. Mentors must make the time and 
effort to effectively mentor their protégés and provide the appropriate amounts of attention, 
training, feedback, and time for them to apply, internalize, and value what they have learned.  
Teach. The skill of teaching may not come naturally to everyone, but knowledge and experience 
are valuable as mentors. Consider these five simple steps when teaching and training protégés: 
(1) organize the material into logical, systematic units of manageable size; (2) correct errors 
immediately; (3) frequently review previously covered material and relate the material to the 
current lesson; (4) include practical exercises to help the protégé exercise the newfound 
knowledge; and (5) evaluate protégé progress and provide detailed feedback.  
Organize. Mentors must themselves be organized before trying to help others become organized. 
An organized mentor knows from the very beginning what he or she wants to achieve, and focuses 
on this goal. The time and effort spent organizing thoughts and materials into a logical, sequential 
plan aimed at a precisely defined target pays big dividends in the form of improved learning and 
developmental experiences for the protégé.  
Respond. Mentoring is a two-way communication process that requires mentors to actively listen 
to the protégé questions and provide useful and timely responses. Effective mentors must remain 
alert to recognize nonverbal behaviors and subtle communication cues that indicate the protégés’ 
interest in certain areas. Mentors should be proactive, anticipate the needs, problems, and 
concerns of protégés, and address them immediately.  
Inspire. More than a good role model, teacher, or ally, an effective mentor is an inspirational 
mentor. Inspirational mentors have a profound impact on protégés that encourages them to 
transform into a more improved being. Inspiration is a characteristic that distinguishes leaders 
from managers.  
Network. A good mentor introduces and connects a protégé with others who can provide 
increased guidance, support, resources, and opportunities. Networking is a vital function that 
helps protégés establish themselves in their professional community through a solid network of 
friends, acquaintances, and associates.  
Goal-Set. Sometimes people lack the experience to understand the importance of setting goals or 
the expertise to establish Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound goals. 
Mentors must help their protégés understand why goals are important; establish short- and long- 
term goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound; and be available 
to assist them in achieving their goals. 
14.12. The Leader as a Counselor 
Being involved in an Airman’s development and growth is essential to a leader’s influence and 
credibility. Leaders should seek to develop and improve counseling abilities to ensure effective 
counseling is provided to Airmen. Counseling can be conducted for a number of reasons, ranging 
from something as simple as discussing steps made toward achieving a goal, to something as 
complex as addressing a significant life changing event. 
 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
268 
 
 
 
14.13. When to Counsel 
The key to successful counseling is to conduct the counseling as close to the event as possible. 
Good leaders take advantage of naturally occurring events as opportunities for providing 
feedback. Leaders must be genuinely interested in Airmen and understand how involvement can 
help personally and professionally. Listening and providing assistance may greatly enhance an 
Airman’s ability to deal with a situation. Professional growth counseling is often conducted while 
reviewing an Airman’s duty performance during a certain period and setting standards for the 
next period, typically, but not only during performance feedback assessments. Leaders may 
conduct counseling for superior or substandard duty performance or behavior. Leaders may 
conduct crisis counseling to help an Airman through the initial shock after receiving negative 
news. Referral counseling may follow crisis counseling, which can help Airmen work through a 
personal situation and may serve as preventive counseling before a situation becomes a problem. 
Referral counseling often involves agencies, such as legal services, religious affairs, or an alcohol 
and drug counselor. 
14.14. Approaches to Counseling 
An effective leader approaches each Airman as an individual. Different people and different 
situations require different counseling approaches. Three approaches to counseling include 
nondirective, directive, and combined. The major difference between the approaches to 
counseling is the degree to which the Airman participates and interacts during a counseling 
session. Figure 14.2. summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.  
Nondirective. The nondirective counseling approach is preferred for most counseling sessions. 
During the counseling session, the leader listens to the situation before helping the individual 
make decisions or giving advice. The leader encourages the Airman to explore and clarify 
important points to better understand the situation. During nondirective counseling, the leader 
should refrain from providing solutions or rendering opinions, instead, maintain focus on 
individual and organizational goals and objectives. Also, ensure the Airman’s plan of action aligns 
with those goals and objectives.  
Directive. The directive counseling approach works best to correct simple problems, make on-
the-spot corrections, and correct specific aspects of duty performance. The leader using the 
directive style directs a course of action for the Airman. The directive approach is best when time 
is short, when the solution is clear, or if an Airman has limited problem-solving skills and needs 
guidance.  
Combined. The combined counseling approach is a blend of both the directive and nondirective 
approaches, adjusting them to articulate what is best for the situation. With the combined 
approach, the leader emphasizes the Airman’s planning and decision-making responsibilities by 
listening, offering options, helping analyze possible solutions, encouraging the Airman to decide 
which solution is best, and assisting with the development of a plan of action.

14.15. The Counseling Process 
One of the most important things a leader can do when conducting a counseling session, regardless 
of purpose, is to ensure the intent is established and the environment is appropriate. Although the 
length of time required will vary, when possible, conduct counseling during the duty day, aim for 
the counseling session to last less than one hour, and be prepared to schedule a second session, if 
necessary. Both the leader and the Airman should clearly understand why, where, and when the 
counseling session will take place and be prepared to discuss main points, pertinent information, 
and plausible, obtainable goals. Finally, the environment should have minimal interruptions and 
be free from distractions to show respect for the Airman and the conversation.  
Even when you have not prepared for formal counseling, you can follow the four basic 
components of a counseling session: state the purpose, discuss the issues, develop a plan of action, 
and record the plan. These steps can be as simple or as elaborate as the situation requires. Also, 
schedule any future meetings, at least tentatively, before closing the session. Appropriate 
measures to consider following the counseling may include a follow-up session, making referrals, 
informing the chain of command, and taking corrective measures. 
14.16. The Leader as a Coach 
Effective leaders often serve as coaches who must thoroughly understand the strengths, 
weaknesses, and professional goals of members of their teams. Leaders coach Airmen similar to 
the way athletic coaches improve their teams: by setting goals, developing and implementing 
plans of action, and providing oversight and motivation throughout the process. 
14.17. Vision 
USAF leaders must have a collective vision - a vision that empowers, inspires, challenges, and 
motivates followers to the highest levels of commitment and a continuously improving 
environment. Airmen are responsible for conducting and maintaining the asymmetric advantages 
and capabilities the USAF delivers in air and cyberspace. We need to ensure we are also driving 
efficiencies and improvements across the board. Therefore, we must use the right tools and 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
270 
 
 
 
techniques to address problems, leverage opportunities for improvement, and employ our greatest 
resource - innovative, dedicated Airmen.  
Vision is helping people believe they can accomplish goals in the anticipation of a better future 
as a result of their efforts. Inspiration is one way to convey vision. To better understand this 
concept, consider President John F. Kennedy’s announcement in 1961 of the United States 
intention to put a man on the moon within the decade. Perhaps an impossible task by most 
standards, and yet it was achieved. The dramatic announcement and the infectious inspiration 
helped achieve the goal. 
14.18. Implementing the Vision 
While senior leadership has the authority and responsibility to change the system as a whole, 
leaders at lower levels direct supervisors and subordinates to seek and perform tasks more 
appropriate to the challenges of the new age. To do this, leaders must communicate the vision, 
bolster Airmen’s courage and understanding, and solicit ideas and suggestions. 
“A great leader’s courage to fulfill his vision comes from passion, not position.” 
John C. Maxwell                          
The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership 
Every leader needs to establish an enduring vision. As technology and our environment continue 
to evolve, our vision and leadership style must keep pace. A vision that meets the organization’s 
needs at the time of implementation, over time is likely to require re-vision, therefore the vision 
forming process should be continual. On the other hand, the vision should not be arbitrarily 
modified. If the vision works and is aligned with environmental and technological developments, 
the vision should be affirmed and supported.  
The ability to form mental images of a possible outcome and translate these images into a reality 
through leadership and action is a unique feature of the human brain. A leader should constantly 
anticipate the influences, trends, and demands that affect the vision over the next month, year, 
and even decade. To be of realistic value, the vision must be logical, deductive, and plausible. 
Vision must be specific enough to provide real guidance to people, but unbounded enough to 
encourage initiative and demonstrate relevancy to a variety of conditions. Leaders with vision are 
compelled to overcome complacency and refuse to accept the norm of doing things as they have 
always been done.

14.19. Leadership Development 
Leaders must effectively influence others, whether through expectation, delegation, or 
empowerment. Qualities that facilitate followership and ensure credibility and mutual respect with 
Airmen are also important. Three qualities that help leaders gain respect and credibility and have 
a positive influence on others are self-awareness and empathy. 
Self-Awareness. Leaders must be fully aware of their own values and needs before counseling 
Airmen. Self-aware leaders are more likely to act consistently with their own values and actions 
and are less likely to project onto Airmen. 
Empathy. Showing empathy is being understanding of and sensitive to another person’s feelings, 
thoughts, and experiences to the point that you can almost feel or experience them yourself. 
Leaders with empathy put themselves in another’s shoes and see a situation from their perspective. 
Understanding another’s position can help the development of a plan of action—one that works. 
14.20. Leadership Self-Evaluation 
To successfully perform as a responsible leader, one must understand what is expected of them. The 
following is a list of questions that offer a perspective for what is expected of aspiring leaders in 
developing particular skills. Only the most honest responses will reveal one’s definitive strengths and 
potential weaknesses. Pause and consider the importance of the following questions. 
Do I have the courage to make tough decisions and stand by them? 
Am I flexible when dealing with change? 
Can I remain enthusiastic and cheerful when I am confronted with seemingly impossible tasks? 
Am I willing to do my best with what seem to be inadequate means? 
Can I inspire people to achieve outstanding results? 
Am I willing to take reasonable risks to allow my Airmen to grow and become more productive? 
Am I willing to let my Airmen be creative? 
Does my manner invite communication? 
Do I really listen and withhold judgment until I have all the facts? 
Am I willing to accept my Airmen’s failures as my own and recognize their successes as theirs? 
Am I able to do many things at one time to manage a complex job? 
Can I carry out orders as well as give them? 
14.21. Leadership Milestones 
Life in the military incorporates a perpetual requirement for continued development. Effective 
leaders must accept the responsibility of being both a master student and a master teacher by 
embracing the role of both follower and leader. Setting high, attainable standards provides 
opportunities for continual growth, as well as guidance and feedback. Giving Airmen a goal and 
inspiration for developing and performing to their best ability is a leader’s direct line to 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
272 
 
 
 
developing leaders of tomorrow. In business, successful corporations actively seek out people 
with leadership potential and expose them to career experiences designed to develop their skills. 
They also value a combination of maturity, experience, and untapped potential as a valuable asset 
to any organization.  
Valuing Experience. Leaders foster professional growth by insisting their Airmen focus attention 
on the aspects of a situation, mission, or project they control, setting the stage for challenging, 
enlightening, and even adventurous experiences. As leaders progress and develop themselves, it 
is just as important to allow Airmen to do the same while growing a sense of confidence in their 
skills and abilities.  
Fostering Growth. The role of the leader in fostering growth is to identify knowledge and 
improvement opportunities. This will ensure advancements are permanent and pervasive, not 
temporary, or limited. Leaders encourage the learning process by formally and publicly 
recognizing individual and unit successes, no matter how large or small.  
Facing Challenges. Developing Airmen for leadership positions requires consistent exposure to 
challenges, with gradual increases in responsibility over time. Identifying people with leadership 
potential early in their careers and then determining the appropriate developmental challenges for 
them is the first step. Leaders must recognize the capabilities of each Airman in their unit or 
organization. Those capabilities include any skills, talents, or experiences the Airman may have 
that can contribute to current and future mission accomplishment.  
Professional Development. Leaders must also diagnose the developmental needs of Airmen, then 
assist them with developmental needs that fulfill current or future jobs or roles and 
responsibilities. Professional development needs may include off-duty education, professional 
military education, specific skills training, professional development seminars, and 
communication skills development.  
Personal Development. Personal developmental needs may include relationships, interpersonal 
skills, and off-duty education. Today’s effective leaders had opportunities early in their careers 
that required them to lead, take risks, and learn from their successes and failures.  
Dealing with Setbacks. To learn and improve, people need to be encouraged to try new things. 
Airmen count on the experience and understanding of strong leaders in dealing with setbacks. An 
Airman’s dedication to improving his or her abilities is a valuable asset to an organization. 
Followers must remain optimistic, even in times of adversity.  
Dealing with Change. Leaders must learn as much as possible about a change and its potential 
direct and indirect effects before dealing with the change process. Furthermore, they must learn 
how to deal with emotions often associated with change. The people supporting these processes 
must be motivated to meet the challenge and support the change that is being implemented. To 
achieve that, leaders must maintain a clear understanding of the present and a clear focus on the 
future. 
14.22. Leadership Styles 
There are no secrets or magic formulas for successful leadership. Leadership is a responsibility 
that requires an active role in engaging with individuals and teams to align their efforts with 
personal as well as organizational success. Although the best advice is to just be yourself, 
ambitious and aspiring leaders can always benefit from the wise words of others. In 1976, Pacific 
Air Forces Commander, General Louis L. Wilson, Jr., provided the timeless advice below.  
Be Tough. Set your standards high and insist that your people measure up. Have the courage to 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
273 
 
 
 
correct those who fail to do so. In the long run, your people will be happier. Almost certainly 
morale will be higher, your outfit better, and your people prouder.  
Get Out from Behind Your Desk. See for yourself what is going on in your work center. Your 
people will see that you are interested in their problems, work conditions, and welfare. Many of 
your people problems will go away if you practice this point.  
Search Out the Problems. If you think there are no problems in your organization, you may be 
wrong. Your job is to find them. Foster an environment that encourages people to bring problems 
to you that they are unable to solve for themselves.  
Find the Critical Path to Success. Get personally involved in issues on a priority basis. Let your 
influence be felt on make-or-break issues in your organization. Avoid the activity trap—do not 
spend your valuable time on inconsequential or trivial matters. Weigh in where it counts.  
Be Sensitive. Listen to your people. Communicate with them and be perceptive to their needs. 
Learn to recognize problems and seek out ideas. Be innovative. Recognize that effective 
communication involves shared perceptions. Do not be afraid to empathize when necessary.  
Do Not Take Things for Granted. Do not assume things have been fixed—look for yourself. 
Furthermore, the probability is high that fixed problems will recur, so monitor your processes.  
Do Not Alibi. Remember, you and your people will never be perfect. People will make mistakes, 
so do not be defensive about things that are wrong. Nothing is more disgusting than the individual 
who can do no wrong and has an alibi for anything and everything that goes awry.  
Do Not Procrastinate. Do not put off hard decisions, they will not be any easier tomorrow. This 
does not mean you should make precipitous or unreasonable decisions just to be prompt; however, 
once you have arrived at a decision, get on with it.  
Do Not Tolerate Incompetence. Once people demonstrate laziness, disinterest, or an inability to 
do the job, you must have the courage to terminate their assignments. You cannot afford to do 
less. When your people do good work, recognize, and encourage them. They will likely do even 
better.  
Be Honest. You must create an atmosphere of trust and confidence. When talking to your people, 
be candid and insist that they do likewise. They set their behavior patterns based upon your 
example. Nothing is more disastrous than half-truths. Finally, be honest with yourself—do not 
gimmick reports and figures to make things look good on paper. 
14.23. The Power of Leadership 
The concept of power in the workforce has many positive aspects, and everyone can learn to 
harness different sources of individual power, particularly when in a leadership role. Taken from 
Ken Blanchard’s Points of Power, Situational Self Leadership, developing one’s own sources of 
power enables leaders to be less dependent on others, thus allowing them to take initiative and 
make greater contributions in their jobs. Although the concept of power sometimes brings to mind 
such associations as coercion, manipulation, and even corruption, this does not have to be the case 
when the right people are put in the right leadership positions. It is helpful to develop an 
understanding that “the sole advantage of power is the ability to do better.” Thus, if you want to 
do more good for the people around you and for the organization, rather than rely on one aspect 
of power where you are strongest, take advantage of opportunities to apply various aspects of 
power in varying circumstances where most appropriate.  
Position power. Position power is inherent in the authority of the position you have. Your 
position power may be indicated on your business card with a title printed on it that indicates you 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
274 
 
 
 
have the power to manage people or command resources.  
Task power. Task power is power that stems from being good at a particular task and being able 
to help others with a process or procedure they may be responsible for.  
Personal power. Personal power comes from your personal character attributes, such as strength 
of character, passion, inspiration, or a personal vision of the future. Personal power is further 
enhanced by the strength of your interpersonal skills, such as your ability to communicate with 
and persuade others.  
Relationship power. Relationship power comes from association with others through friendship, 
familiarity with a colleague, cultivation of a relationship, preferential treatment, or reciprocity 
(trading favors). However, perceived favoritism can have negative effects in the organization.  
Knowledge power. Knowledge power is about having expertise in an area, often through a 
special skill or group of skills. It is often evidenced by having certain degrees or certifications 
indicating special training. Knowledge power can generally be transferred within jobs or 
organizations. 
14.24. Full Range Leadership Development 
A full range of leadership behaviors is essential in today’s complex world. Today’s USAF depends on 
highly effective Airmen with the flexibility and capability to operate throughout a spectrum of leadership 
styles. Full Range Leadership Development (FRLD) requires leadership to be viewed as a system made 
up of three core elements: the leader, the follower, and the situation. Success of FRLD relies not only 
on the leader’s actions, but also an accurate understanding of the follower and the situation and requires 
today’s leaders to be willing to engage in several ways. 
Develop relationships with leadership, peers, and subordinates. 
Take advantage of opportunities as they become available. 
Efficiently use available resources. 
Properly evaluate situations and the performance of followers. 
Reward appropriately (and discipline accordingly). 
Identify improvement areas in oneself, followers, and the workplace. 
14.25. Full Range Leadership Development Model 
The FRLD model includes leadership behaviors ranging from the passive laissez- faire behavior, 
to active transformational leadership behavior. Developing leadership behaviors begins by 
understanding each of them and knowing when or when not to apply them. In addition, possessing 
the flexibility and capability to implement the appropriate leadership style successfully is critical 
to leading others. 
Laissez-Faire. Laissez-faire leaders view the development and needs of their subordinates as 
someone else’s concern. They tend to abandon their responsibilities and remain indifferent toward 
important issues. They are hesitant to make decisions and may be absent from their place of work, 
which negatively affects relationships with peers and subordinates. 
Management by Exception-Passive. Management by exception-passive is an “if it’s not broke, 
don’t fix it” leadership style. Here, leaders elect to sit back, observe, and wait for things to go 
wrong before taking action. They intervene only when policies or rules are broken, or goals are 
not met. Management by exception-passive is a little more effective than laissez-faire, but only 
because subordinates know that leadership will hold them accountable if they fail to meet standards 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
275 
 
 
 
of performance or comply with policies and procedures. 
Management by Exception-Active. Management by exception-active is a leadership style that 
aims to keep personnel and processes in control by monitoring and governing subordinates through 
forced compliance with rules, regulations, and expectations for meeting performance standards. 
Management by exception-active exists in a structured system with detailed instructions, careful 
observation, and very active supervision. Furthermore, this leadership behavior reduces 
organizational uncertainties, avoids unnecessary risks, and ensures important goals are being 
achieved. This transactional leadership behavior reduces the temptation for employees to avoid 
their duties or act unethically and aids members in meeting defined performance objectives. But 
the leader has to be careful not to go too far and be perceived as a dictator. 
Contingent Rewards. Contingent rewards is a transactional leadership style that involves the 
constructive transaction between leaders and followers. These transactions are contracts or 
agreements where the leader sets goals, identifies ways for the subordinate to reach these goals, 
and supports the follower along the way. The follower is then required to perform their assigned 
tasks to a specified performance level. When the follower achieves the leader’s expectations, the 
leader reinforces the positive behavior by providing a reward. In other words, the reward is 
contingent upon the follower performing assigned tasks to expectations. 
Transformational Leadership. Transformational leadership is a style of leadership that is defined 
by the application of offering followers a vision and inspiring their mission. This type of leadership 
inspires followers to exceed their goals and promotes positive, meaningful changes through 
intrinsic motivation and encourages others to act because they want to. To motivate intrinsically, 
a transformational leader must consider ways to get others to embrace ideas, strategies, and 
initiatives. There are four components of transformational leadership: individualized 
consideration, intellectual stimulation, idealized influence, and inspirational motivation. 
Individualized Consideration (Nurturing). Individualized consideration is where leaders 
treat their followers as individuals with different needs, abilities, and aspirations and not just as 
a part of a group of subordinates. They empathize with and support each follower while 
maintaining healthy communication. Using individualized consideration, leaders ‘nurture’ 
followers by acting as mentor or coach. 
Intellectual Stimulation (Thinking). Intellectual stimulation is the degree to which leaders 
value their subordinates’ rationality and intellect by seeking different perspectives and 
considering opposing points of view. Using intellectual stimulation, leaders stimulate and 
encourage creativity in their followers, encourage followers to be independent thinkers, and are 
not afraid to take risks and solicit ideas from their followers.  
Inspirational Motivation (Charming). Inspirational motivation is when leaders develop and 
articulate visions that paint an optimistic and enthusiastic picture of the future that is appealing 
and inspiring to followers. These visions elevate performance expectations and inspire 
followers to put forth extra effort to achieve the leader’s vision.  
Idealized Influence (Influencing). Transformational leaders are charismatic and act as positive 
role models who “walk the walk.” They exhibit high levels of moral behavior, virtues, and 
character strengths, as well as a strong work ethic. They represent the organization’s values, 
beliefs, and purpose in both words and actions and, if necessary, set aside personal interests for 
the sake of the group. 
14.26. Leadership Attributes 
Leading by Example. Leadership is modeling and setting the example for others - in word and 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
276 
 
 
 
action. Effective leaders lead rather than drive people. They make fair and firm decisions that are 
in the best interest of good order, discipline, and successful accomplishment of the mission. While 
no one expects a leader to be perfect, a leader cannot demand the best from others if he or she 
cannot demonstrate that they are willing and able to do the same. Through positive behavior, 
leaders live by their values and become good role models. They reinforce their credibility when 
they do not dwell on the personal effort they have put forth. 
Involvement. A leader’s success is reflected in the efficiency, productivity, morale, and 
enthusiasm demonstrated by the followers, and a leader’s involvement is essential to maximizing 
worker performance and success of the mission. Leaders become a positive influence when they 
are actively involved in their Airmen’s careers and lives. 
Learning from Failure. Leadership is about risks and rewards, and effective leaders realize that 
failure is one of the greatest learning tools an organization has for achieving success. With every 
risk there is the potential for failure; however, these are the moments which shed light on the faults 
within an organization. Effective leaders realize that learning from failure empowers change and 
inspires efforts to improve. Therefore, leaders never fear failure. 
Transparency. Direction, decisions, and actions are rarely challenged if the leader’s intentions 
are transparent. Transparency is accomplished by integrating regular communication, shared 
decision-making, mutual consensus, and healthy debate. Airmen should know the reason decisions 
are made and how decisions will impact them and the organization. 
Flexibility. Leaders who are flexible listen to other points of view, bend when necessary, and are 
not afraid to change course if things are not going well. Flexibility is an especially valued 
leadership trait during times of change. 
Resilience. Leaders at every level within an organization constantly face challenges, changes, and 
criticisms. Resilient leaders must possess a combination of compassion and grit to persevere during 
times of uncertainty, deviation, turmoil, and conflict. 
Accountability. Promoting accountability in the workplace includes establishing clear roles and 
responsibilities, cultivating a sense of pride and ownership among the members within the 
organization, providing regular feedback to subordinates, leading with integrity, and setting a 
positive example. Accountability does not focus on the discipline and punishment associated with 
being unaccountable; but rather, concentrates on creating and sustaining a continuously learning 
and always improving organization.  
Positive Attitude. Leaders must demonstrate the attitude they want emulated by their followers. 
Positive enthusiasm is contagious and can deliver energy to all aspects of organizational 
operations. Encouraging Airmen, as well as oneself, is a powerful motivator. Effective leaders 
constantly embrace positive goals and display a positive attitude.  
Values. The degree to which the values of trust, loyalty, and integrity are present in leaders of an 
organization directly relates to the organization’s effectiveness. Leadership is the capacity to 
generate and sustain organizational values, with consistency and reliability. Establishing values 
must include a willingness to remove people who do not align themselves with organizational 
values.  
Competence. Competence is developed with training, education, and experience. The skills and 
abilities of a leader enable them to competently lead others to achieve the mission.  
Character. Character is who a leader is as a person with regard to personality. Character is 
developed over time and through effort and ambition. For character to be effective, it must be 
coupled with competence. While competence and character are individually considered valuable 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
277 
 
 
 
leadership traits, a combination of both is needed for individuals to be great leaders.  
Charisma. Charisma is an energy that is emitted by leaders to inspire Airmen to perform a task 
or objective when aspects of a mission are not intrinsically motivating or compelling. While 
charisma can be effective at enhancing morale, its use should not be contrary to authority or 
undermine commander intent.  
Compassion. Compassion is the sympathy and concern for the misfortunes of others. Compassion 
promotes healthy, open, and honest communication, and provides the stimulus for Airmen to 
discuss and deal with personal issues.  
Courage. Courageous leaders must demonstrate both moral and physical courage in combat and 
in high-risk situations, as well as in day-to-day life. Leadership requires the courage to address 
sub-standard performance or unacceptable behavior, welcome new ideas, do what is ethically 
right when others prefer to do otherwise, and be honest. Acts of courage inspire others to maintain 
composure in stressful situations, providing the stimulus and encouragement to endure hardships.  
Credibility. Credibility is the quality of being trusted and believed in. Credible leaders must 
exercise and demonstrate humility, show commitment to the organization and mission, and 
optimize operations by tapping into the unique strengths of each team member. Occasionally, 
leaders must be willing to work alongside their followers to get the job done. Credibility may take 
years to earn through persistent, consistent, and patient leadership and can easily be lost with one 
thoughtless action, decision, or behavior. Successful leaders earn credibility through leading by 
example and taking responsibility. A crucial element of a leader’s credibility is taking 
responsibility not only for his or her individual actions, but also for those of the Airmen. AFH 36-
2647, Competency Modeling, includes attachments on developing self, developing others, 
developing ideas, and developing organizations.

15.1. Accountability 
Accountability is defined as demonstrating reliability and honesty and taking responsibility for 
the behaviors of self and team. Accountability is at the core of what it means to be an Airman. In 
surveys of USAF members, accountability has been consistently rated as the most important 
foundational competency for success in a USAF career. 
Accountability requires leading by example, admitting mistakes, and doing the right thing even 
when it is unpopular or difficult. Accountable Airmen embody the USAF Core Values of Integrity 
First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do—and take personal responsibility even 
when faced with the most challenging situations. 
You may not always recognize the important role your actions (or inaction) can play in a situation. 
Taking personal responsibility requires: 
Understanding the significance and potential irreversibility of failing to act 
Recognizing your competence and ability to take the steps that are needed in a given 
situation (self-efficacy) 
Acting out of a sense of personal control (autonomy) 
For example, imagine you are working in a nuclear facility. You find out that one of your friends, 
a nuclear weapons specialist, has been cheating on his exams to maintain weapons system 
certification. Do you report him? What if your supervisor tells you to ignore the issue? 
Imagine you are working as a military training instructor. You observe one of your peers pushing 
his trainees too hard, yelling obscenities at them when they make mistakes, and forcing them to 
train more hours than is authorized. Will you say something? What if your immediate leadership 
is pressuring your peer to work his trainees more hours in order to meet training goals? 
Significance. In each of these situations, try to understand the significance of the situation by 
thinking about the bigger picture. 
What if the same way you responded to your co-worker in these situations was the way other 
people in the USAF were responding in similar situations? 
That is, what would happen if not just one, but many, MTIs pushed their trainees too hard, to the 
point of physical injury? What would happen if not just one, but many, nuclear weapons specialists 
didn’t have sufficient expertise to repair key equipment or correctly follow emergency procedures? 
What does the way you would respond to these situations say about who you are as a person? 
Are you someone who cheats and enables cheaters? Are you someone who looks the other way 
when there are potential risks to security? Are you someone who fails to stand up for the most 
junior and vulnerable Airmen among us? 
Self-Efficacy. Self-efficacy is a person’s belief in their ability to address a situation, based on the 
skills they have and the circumstances they face. Recognize your own personal strengths and think 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
280 
 
 
 
about how you can bring your skills to bear on a situation. 
For example, you can use your communication skills (reflection, active listening, and recognition 
of non-verbal cues) and influence your peers by appealing to reason or shared values. You can 
demonstrate perseverance and persist in addressing an issue with others. You can take initiative 
and try to help peers see situations as opportunities to learn. Try to make use of your unique 
strengths and talents—maybe you can teach your friend (the nuclear weapons specialist) better 
study techniques to help him learn the material needed to pass his weapons system exams; maybe 
you can show your friend (the MTI) better teaching techniques or coach him on how to exercise 
self-control and patience when correcting trainees. Have confidence in yourself and your abilities 
to address challenging situations. 
Autonomy. Ultimately you are your own person. You make your own decisions on your actions 
or inactions. You have the freedom to choose how to respond to a situation. Even if so-called 
“leaders” or “friends” try to pressure you otherwise, you can act to support the greater good. 
15.2. Perseverance 
As Airmen, we understand that “Excellence in All We Do” entails striving for continual self- 
improvement. But too often the way we think about our abilities may hold us back. 
Psychologists distinguish two mindsets regarding ability and other personal qualities. Fixed 
mindset refers to the belief that a person’s intelligence and other personal qualities are mostly 
permanent; that you are a certain kind of person, and there is not much that can be done to really 
change that. In contrast, growth mindset refers to the belief in the capacity to fundamentally 
improve and significantly change the kind of person you are. Growth mindset entails a recognition 
that past mistakes or failures don’t define who you are or who you can become. 
People with a fixed mindset are likely to give up easily when things get hard. They are constantly 
trying to prove themselves (prove their intelligence, prove their natural talent) and if they don’t 
excel at first, may believe there is not much that can be done to change that. They tend to be overly 
sensitive about being wrong or making mistakes because they think their (initial) failures reflect a 
lack of ability that can’t be changed. They may view exerting effort as evidence of inability. 
People with a growth mindset are likely to persist when learning new things and persevere on 
even the most difficult tasks. They put in effort and focus on improving, recognizing that 
challenges are needed in order to develop and grow. They don’t get defensive about mistakes, 
failure, or negative feedback, and don’t feel threatened by the success of others, because they don’t 
view an initial lack of ability as permanent. 
If you are someone who holds a fixed mindset, you can begin to change your perspective and 
become more perseverant: 
1. Remind yourself of the differences between the fixed and growth mindsets every day. 
Remember that when people with a growth mindset set goals they: 
Persist in the face of setbacks 
Embrace challenges (actively seek out difficult tasks as an opportunity to learn) 
Value effort as the path to mastery 
Seek feedback and learn from criticism 
Find lessons and inspiration in the success of others 
2. Ask yourself, “What are the opportunities for learning and growth today?” then form a plan and 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
281 
 
 
 
begin to act on it. 
3. As you encounter inevitable obstacles and setbacks, form a new plan to continue learning. 
4. When you succeed, don’t forget to ask yourself: “What do I have to do to maintain and continue 
the growth?” 
15.3. Self-Control 
Airmen should recognize the need to exhibit self-control as part of the USAF Core Values of 
Integrity First and Service Before Self. 
Self-control refers to a person’s ability to override or restrain their inner responses or impulses. 
This includes keeping emotions under control in difficult situations, handling temptations and 
avoiding inappropriate behavior (e.g., controlling one’s urges to overeat or smoke, or restraining 
a tendency to yell or curse when angry). Understanding both the limitations of one’s self-control 
and one’s ability to strengthen it may be important to consistently demonstrate self-control when 
needed. 
Self-Control is Limited. Like a muscle, our self-control is limited and gets depleted with heavy 
use. Controlling strong urges is a heavy lift, and we can expend only so much effort before our 
efforts begin to fail. 
As a result, changing the situation to reduce temptation is more likely to prevent inappropriate 
behavior than expending effort to try to internally control urges. For example, if you love potato 
chips and have a tendency to overeat, it will be more effective to keep chips out of the house 
altogether (“out of sight is out of mind”) than to try to “will” yourself to eat just one. Some self- 
control may be needed to pass up the chip aisle at the grocery store, but far stronger self-control 
would be needed to avoid eating an open bag of chips that has been sitting in front of you for hours 
at home. 
The same principle applies to avoiding inappropriate behavior when angry or upset. Removing 
yourself from situations that are likely to cause you to become angry (avoiding potential “triggers”) 
will be more likely to prevent outbursts than simply exerting effort internally to try to control anger 
in difficult situations. 
Self-Control Can Become Stronger. Like a muscle, self-control can be made stronger with 
practice. Regularly practicing small acts of self-control, interspersed with rest, can strengthen self- 
control over time. Further, improving self-control in one domain (e.g., controlling urges to overeat) 
has been shown to improve self-control in other domains as well (e.g., controlling other impulses, 
such as the tendency to curse or yell when angry). 
Studies have found that even two weeks of deliberate, daily practice to inhibit an urge or behavior 
can meaningfully improve impulse control: 
Set a target goal requiring self-control (e.g., avoiding sweets and desserts, holding a handgrip 
for as long as possible, despite physical discomfort) 
Keep a daily record of how much effort and self-control you exert (e.g., declined cookie when 
offered one that smelled delicious; held the handgrip for X minutes), and reflect on how 
practicing could improve self-control. 
While some people naturally tend to have more self-control than others, with practice, even people 
with initially poor self-control can get better at exercising restraint and avoiding temptations.

15.4. Resilience 
How is it that some people seem to “bounce back” from negative experiences so quickly, while 
others tend to get caught in a rut, seemingly unable to recover and move on?  While external factors 
such as support, relationships, and spirituality all impact resilience, our resilience can also be 
affected by how we think about stressful situations. 
Positive reappraisal refers to the process of re-construing (re-interpreting) stressful events as non- 
threatening, meaningful, and even contributing to personal growth. This cognitive strategy can 
help us prepare for stressful events (by embracing challenge), and better cope with past events (by 
viewing them as opportunities for learning/growth). 
Embracing Challenge. Imagine the following situation: 
You receive last-minute notice that you will need to give a presentation to an audience of high- 
ranking members. The stakes are high, and your ability (or inability) to convince the audience will 
have major consequences on your career. 
For most people, this can be a stressful situation. But studies have shown that our ability to manage 
potentially stressful events like this can be affected by how we frame the situation. Specifically, 
when we view a situation in terms of threat (e.g., focusing on task difficulty and how other people 
will evaluate us), our heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure increase, and it takes us longer to calm 
down afterwards. 
When we instead frame the same situation in terms of challenge, we tend to recover faster (heart 
rate, pulse, and blood pressure return to normal more quickly after the event). For example, before 
going into a stressful situation, you might tell yourself (or one of your Airmen): 
“Even though this is a difficult task, it is a challenge that can be met and overcome. I have 
overcome other challenges in the past, and if I try hard to do my best, I can meet this challenge as 
well.” 
When framed this way in terms of challenge, people report experiencing less anxiety about the 
task, and demonstrate faster recovery. 
Viewing Negative Events as Opportunities for Growth. 
Sometimes negative events happen to everyone—your presentation went poorly and you received 
a poor performance evaluation. Or you experienced adversity outside of work-- you got divorced, 
were in an accident, experienced the death of a family member, etc. 
Experts recommend reflecting on the problems and challenges we have faced. Try to make sense 
of the circumstances and ask yourself: 
Is there something you could learn from this situation? 
Can you envision something good coming out of dealing with this problem? 
How could the event change your life in a positive way? 
How could you find benefit in this situation in the long-term? 
Some examples of cognitive reappraisal to learn or grow from otherwise negative events: 
Someone who has a heart attack might view the event as a “wake up call” and chance to modify 
their lifestyle and begin to change their diet. 
Someone whose spouse becomes seriously ill might view the need for caregiving as 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
283 
 
 
 
deepening their relationship and level of intimacy. 
Someone who has been abused might view their survival as evidence of their strength, and they 
might decide to dedicate their life to helping others make similar recoveries. 
Importantly, there is often the opportunity to learn from even more mundane stressful events. For 
example, having been treated rudely by a supervisor, one might learn how to relate more 
effectively with one’s own subordinates in the future (i.e., having understanding of what type of 
supervisory behavior to avoid). 
Rather than a wishful denial of reality, cognitive reappraisal allows us to actively find meaning in 
adversity so that we can flexibly grow and adapt longer term.

15.5. Communication as a Foundational Competency 
Communication (oral, written, and nonverbal) is critical throughout a USAF career. Recognized 
as a foundational competency, the USAF has defined effective communication to include skills 
such as: 
Presenting complex information articulately and concisely 
Tailoring communication to address concerns of the audience 
Voicing differing opinions on contentious issues without triggering a defensive response 
Attending to non-verbal cues, and communicating with sensitivity to others’ needs 
This chapter addresses communication in its many forms within the USAF, from high-level 
strategic communication to routine meetings and email writing. While some communication 
formats described in this chapter are specific to the military, many of the communication principles 
described later in this chapter will serve members well even when transitioning to civilian careers. 
15.6. Strategic Communication 
Airmen must ensure audiences know and understand what the USAF needs, where we are going, 
and how we can be positioned for success. Because communication can be broken into three parts: 
the sender, the message, and the audience, we must be aware of and responsible for how we 
communicate, including the way our communication is perceived by others. Strategic 
communication is viewed as an emerging and extremely important concept, resulting in strategic 
communication being designated as a special area of emphasis. 
Strategic Communication: Defined. The Department of Defense broadly defines strategic 
communication as a process of purposefully using communication for the intent of advancing 
national interests and objectives through synchronized integration of information with other 
elements of national power. Communication synchronization entails focused efforts to create, 
strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of national interests, policies, 
and objectives by understanding and engaging key audiences through the use of coordinated 
actions. In other words, strategic communication is implemented by aligning actions, words, and 
images with the purpose of obtaining a specific objective or objectives. Leaders use strategic 
messaging to advocate the unique functions and distinct capabilities of airpower to project national 
influence and respond to national defense requirements. 
15.7. Enterprise Perspective 
Having an enterprise perspective in strategic communication empowers USAF leaders to inform 
and appropriately influence key audiences by synchronizing and integrating communication 
efforts to deliver truthful, timely, accurate, and credible information, analysis, and opinion. Truth 
is the foundation of all public communications, both in terms of credibility and capability. Timely 
and agile dissemination of information is essential to achieving desired effects. Without 
appropriate information dissemination, strategic communication cannot maximize value or 
potential. It must be conducted at the time, level, and manner for which it is intended. 
Our USAF Story. Effectively communicating who we are as Airmen underwrites our ability to 
be successful in all areas of engagement. USAF leaders want every Airman to be a communicator 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
285 
 
 
 
or spokesperson for the USAF, and through the enterprise perspective, be able to tell their USAF 
story. All Airmen need to know how to integrate their personal USAF story and experience into a 
message that adds credibility to USAF, DoD, and national strategic communication. 
15.8. Public Affairs 
An important aspect of communication is speaking in public forums and recognizing the need for 
strategic communication alignment; this involves communication synchronization. As stated in 
AFI 1-1, the purpose of Public Affairs (PA) operations is to communicate timely, accurate, and 
useful information about USAF activities to Department of Defense, the USAF, as well as 
domestic and international audiences. The PA representative is the commander’s principal 
spokesperson and advisor, and a member of the personal staff. PA advises the commander on the 
implications of command decisions, actions, and operations on foreign and domestic public 
perceptions. PA plans, executes, and evaluates activities and events to support overall operational 
success. The PA representative must have the resources to provide information, including visual 
information, to the staff, public, media, and subordinate units in near real time. PA should be 
involved in planning, decision-making, training, equipping, and executing operations as well as 
integrating PA activities into all levels of command. Additional information regarding public 
affairs can be found in AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Operations, 20 November 2020. Note: Although 
briefly covered in standards of conduct and enforcing standards, propriety, and perception, it is 
important to mention that any activity not in alignment with good order, discipline, and national 
security may intentionally or unintentionally generate a negative perception of the USAF. 
Commanders have the authority and responsibility to address situations that could be perceived 
negatively, while also being mindful of preserving the service member’s right of expression within 
these interests. More specific information on permitted and prohibited activities can be found in 
DAFI 51-508, Political Activities, Free Speech and Freedom of Assembly.  
15.9. Social Media 
Airmen interact with individuals via face-to-face, telephone, written letter, e-mail, text messages, 
social networking services, and social media. Social networking includes weblogs, message 
boards, video sharing, and services, such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and 
Snapchat, used by individuals and communities to stay in touch. 
Appropriate Posts. Individuals are responsible for what they say, share, or post on social 
networking services. Offensive and inappropriate communication must be avoided. Also, Airmen 
who provide commentary and opinions on internet blogs may not place comments on those blog 
sites which reasonably can be anticipated or are intended to degrade morale, good order, and 
discipline of any members or units in the U.S. Armed Forces; are service-discrediting; or would 
degrade the trust and confidence of the public. Additionally, it is important to recognize that social 
network “friends” and “followers” may potentially constitute relationships that could affect 
background investigations and periodic reinvestigations associated with security clearances. 
Additional information regarding social media can be found in: DAFH 33-337 The Tongue and 
Quill, and DAFI 35-101, Public Affairs. 
Operations Security. Operations security is vital to the accomplishment of the USAF mission. 
The use of social media and other forums that allow communication with large numbers of people 
brings with it the increased risk of magnifying operational security lapses. Classified, controlled 
unclassified information, and other official Department of Defense information and documents are 
prohibited from being posted on social networking services or transmitted via non-Department of 
Defense e-mail accounts without proper authority.

15.10. Military References for Communicating 
JP 1-02, DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, supplements English-language 
dictionaries and standardizes terminology used within the Department of Defense, other federal 
agencies, and among the United States and its allies. It is a compilation of definitions, 
abbreviations, and acronyms applicable to the Department of Defense and its components, often 
used as a primary source for official correspondence and planning documents. 
The Air University Style and Author Guide (AU-1) provides guidance on writing, editing, and 
publishing matters related to official publications for the Air University. Also, AU-1 is a valuable 
reference for grammar, mechanics, and documentation of sources for those with an interest in 
military acronyms, ranks, and specialized military terms. 
The U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual is the approved reference for all forms and 
styles of government printing. Essentially, the style manual is a standardization reference 
designed to achieve uniformity in word and type, aimed toward economy of word use. 
The Tongue and Quill is not an all-inclusive reference, but provides valuable, detailed information 
on most presentations and papers produced in professional military education courses. 
References, such as the Modern Language Association (MLA) Style Guide, the Chicago Manual 
of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA) Style Guide, are widely recognized in 
the civilian sector and organizations following college and university writing standards. They 
provide useful information when conducting research or developing written products. 
15.11. Military Phonetic Alphabet 
All branches of the U.S. Government and military departments use the International Civil Aviation 
Organization alphabet for radio communication. This phonetic alphabet was adopted by the U.S. 
Armed Forces in 1956 and is currently used by North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and 
civil aviation around the world. Table 15.1. shows the letters, code words, and pronunciation.

15.12. Organizational Communication 
Organizational communication refers to the strategic sharing of information, both internally and 
externally, within and across the organizational industry. Leaders must exhibit solid organizational 
communication skills to accomplish organization- and mission-related goals. Creating a culture of 
communication and maintaining relevance empowers people to own the organizational 
communication message at every level. According to Caldwell, Stroud, and Menning, in Fostering 
a Culture of Engagement, to be effective, an organizational culture must be proactive, innovative, 
adaptive, leader driven, and sustainable. 
Proactive. To be proactive means to seize the initiative and be agile in communicating the 
message. The capacity to be proactive enables leaders to get out front and communicate their 
perspectives and experiences on important topics. 
Innovative. To be innovative means to exercise ingenuity in seeking new effective ways of 
communicating. Relying on more than raw creative thinking, innovation requires an understanding 
of the characteristics and capabilities of information sharing and the pace of change. 
Adaptive. Adaptive, modern communication capabilities thrive in a fast-evolving, instantaneous, 
and interconnected information environment that presents challenges to rigid and inflexible 
organizations. The key to success in this environment is adjusting to changing circumstances on 
the run. 
Leader Driven. USAF leaders must confront modern media realities by fostering a culture of 
engagement in their subordinates and commands. Leaders set the command climate by making 
themselves available for communication, especially during times of crisis. 
Sustainable. Leadership is essential to instilling focus and function for the culture of engagement. 
Sustainability requires dedicated resources and manpower to build enduring capabilities to enable 
a culture of engagement.

15.13. Communicating Intent 
Like many things, good communication requires preparation. Preparation is the most important 
aspect, and sometimes the time best spent, with regard to good communication. By being prepared, 
speakers show audiences that they value their time as well as the topic of interest. Being prepared 
enhances a speaker’s confidence as well as their credibility when communicating a message. 
Confidence will be a great factor in successful delivery of the message, along with additional 
aspects covered here for establishing strong spoken communication skills. 
Success as a military leader requires the ability to think critically and creatively. It is also crucial 
to be able to communicate intentions and decisions to others. The ability to communicate clearly— 
to write, speak, and actively listen—greatly impacts the capacity to inform, teach, motivate, 
mentor, and lead others. Communicating intent and ideas so others understand the message and 
act on it is one of the primary qualities of leadership. 
15.14. Principles of Effective Communication 
Communication requires a combination of the appropriate quality and quantity of information 
sharing. While communication can be broken into three parts: the sender, the message, and the 
audience, for communication to be successful the audience must not only receive the message, but 
they must interpret the message the way the sender intended. This section addresses five core 
principles of communication: focused, organized, clear, understanding, and supported (FOCUS). 
Focused. Being focused means understanding what the issue is, considering all aspects of the 
issue, and not straying from the issue. Address the issue, the whole issue, and nothing but the issue. 
Organized. Good organization means presenting information in a logical, systematic manner. 
When information is not well organized, audiences may become confused, impatient, or 
inattentive. Even if you are providing useful, relevant information, the importance of your message 
may be lost to the audience if it is disorganized. 
Clear. Communicate with clarity and make each word count. Clear communication occurs when 
the sender is able to properly articulate and formulate the message to the audience. To 
communicate clearly, be sure to understand the proper pronunciation of words and how to 
assemble and punctuate sentences. Also, clear communication often requires getting to the point. 
Understanding. Understand your audience and its expectations. Understanding the audience’s 
current knowledge, views, and level of interest regarding a topic helps when sharing ideas with 
others. Understanding expectations of format and length of response, due date, level of formality, 
and any staffing requirements helps when responding to a request for information. 
Supported. Be sure to support your communication with information that substantiates your 
position but does not bring the audience to question your message. Nothing cripples a clearly 
written, properly punctuated paper quicker than implied data or a distorted argument. Support and 
logic should be used to build credibility and trust with your audience. 
15.15. Seven Steps for Effective Communication 
As indicated in DAFH 33-337, the seven steps for effective communication are fundamental to 
good speaking and writing skills. The first four steps lay the groundwork for the drafting process 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
289 
 
 
 
of effective communication, steps five through seven are where the communication takes the form 
of a well-prepared message. The seven steps for effective communication and a brief explanation 
of what they entail are provided here. 
1. Analyze Purpose and Audience. Be clear on your purpose and know and understand your 
audience when preparing to communicate your message. This is often accomplished by 
determining what your message is and why you are communicating it to your audience. In this step 
you will want to ask yourself, is your purpose for communicating to direct, inform, persuade, or 
inspire. Once you know your intent, you can design your message around your purpose statement 
or the intent you have in mind. 
2. Research Your Topic. Be resourceful and informed when preparing to communicate your 
message. There may be experts in your workplace who you can talk to for insights and advice on 
researching your topic. Also, information is at our fingertips, so consider what you know and what 
you don’t know and gather data that is pertinent and relevant to your topic. DAFH 33-337, Chapter 
4, provides a comprehensive list of online sources, websites, and databases that will prove to be 
very helpful in gathering information for your topic. You may find it valuable to save many of the 
links as favorites in your web browser for quick access. 
3. Support Your Ideas. Be sure to strengthen your communication by providing information that 
will support your message. There are a number of ways you can develop a strong message in your 
communication. It is essential to choose the methods that best enhance your credibility and portray 
your argument as valid and reliable. Depending on your message and your audience, you may 
choose to reinforce your position on an issue through evidence using definitions, examples, 
testimony, or statistics. Focus your approach using trustworthy, accurate, precise, relevant, and 
sufficient evidence that will support your ideas and gain the trust of your audience. 
4. Organize and Outline. Be organized and purposeful in your approach to communicating your 
message. There are several ways to organize information; you will want to choose the one that 
allows your message to reach the audience in the best manner possible. There are several patterns 
available in DAFH 33-337, Chapter 6. The pattern you choose will depend greatly on whether 
your intent is to direct, inform, persuade, or inspire. You may find that your topic is best presented 
chronologically, using an approach that covers pertinent information in a time-ordered sequence. 
Or you may decide that a sequential approach is most appropriate that presents your information 
in a step-by-step manner. 
5. Draft. Be willing to get your thoughts into a draft product. Your draft is just the beginning of 
formulating your communication into an organized, outlined, purposeful manner. It will not be 
perfect. As long as you follow the basic structure of having an introduction, body, and conclusion, 
you will have a template to work with while you sharpen your message, develop your thoughts, 
and clarify your approach. Keep in mind the structure of your communication and consider 
including key aspects, such as reaching your audience, following format, and ensuring your 
message flows with transitions between main points or main ideas. Your efforts will never be a 
waste of time as long as you remember that your draft is the essential step toward creating your 
final product. DAFH 33-337, Chapter 7, provides several suggestions and examples of how to 
develop a draft of your message using recommended structure, verbiage, and phrases. 
6. Edit. Following the first five steps of the effective communication process will set you up for 
success, but it will not guarantee a perfect product, and you should not expect your draft to be. 
That is what steps six and seven are for. Have your draft written early enough to give yourself time 
to take a break before looking it over through an editing lens. This will allow you to edit with fresh 
eyes. Think about what you would like to accomplish with your work and keep that in mind as you 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
290 
 
 
 
look over your draft. Consider how it may look or sound to the audience as you edit your work. 
Whether your communication is written or spoken, you may find value in reading your work out 
loud to catch areas for improvement that wouldn’t have been readily identifiable otherwise. As 
you review, look for three main aspects of your draft product: 1) review for the big picture, main 
purpose, length, and flow of ideas; 2) review for paragraph structure, clarity, organization of 
material, and supporting ideas; then 3) review sentences, phrases, words, grammar, and consider 
how the audience will perceive or receive the message. 
7. Fight for Feedback and Get Approval. Be receptive to feedback from others. Now that you’ve 
done your best at formulating your message, it’s time to seek feedback. Even the best 
communicators can overlook key aspects of their messages. In this step, allow your pride in 
authorship to be set aside and seek pride in other’s willingness to review and provide feedback on 
your work. Communicate up front with your reviewers what your strengths and weaknesses are 
and let them know why you selected them to provide feedback to you. To best utilize time, express 
what areas you most likely need feedback on. This will help reviewers know where to focus their 
efforts and it will enable them to be most helpful to you when providing feedback. 
15.16. Job Interview Preparation 
Before committing yourself to the effort required of applying and interviewing for a job, you need 
to understand the experience or skills required for the job and whether or not you possess those 
experiences or skills. One of the first steps in preparing for a job interview is carefully studying 
the job advertisement or position description so you understand the particular knowledge, skills, 
and abilities required. Once you have successfully aligned your knowledge, skills, and abilities to 
the job, then gather all required information and documentation for the application process. 
Applying for the Job. When applying for special duty, seeking employment, or simply gathering 
pertinent information to successfully build a resume or application package in the future, there are 
different employer expectations you will want to be familiar with. In many cases, you may need 
to submit an application package with various documents, such as recent performance reports, 
personnel documents, a resume, a job application, a curriculum vitae, a biography, letters of 
recommendation, a cover letter, and in some cases, college transcripts. Any of these documents 
submitted for a job application should be tailored to highlight your particular knowledge, skills, 
and abilities related to the position for which you are applying. 
Interviewing for the Job. Many USAF positions require a job interview. Knowing how to prepare 
for and conduct yourself during an interview can go a long way toward helping you get selected 
for a special duty or other career broadening position in the USAF, not to mention being hired in 
the civilian sector. Prior to the interview, put yourself in the mindset that everything the interviewer 
sees or hears from you is part of the interview. The interview begins the moment you pick up the 
phone or enter the property of the organization. Think about how you will be perceived, how you 
will enter the conversation, how you will ask and answer questions, and anything else you think 
will occur before, during, or after the interview. If you are having a phone interview, ensure you 
will be in an environment where you can solely focus on the interview. 
It is a good idea to research the mission and history of the hiring organization before the interview. 
The more you know about the organization, the better you will be at convincing potential 
employers that you care about the organization, as well as the job you’re seeking. Information you 
can often find about the organization in advance might include who the commander and senior 
enlisted members of the organization are, how large the organization is, and what the mission and 
vision statements are. Interviewers expect candidates to ask intelligent, thoughtful questions 
concerning the organization and the nature of the work. The nature and quality of your questions 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
291 
 
 
 
will reveal your interest in the organization and the position you’re seeking. When the interviewer 
asks if you have any questions or concerns about the job or the organization, be prepared with at 
least one or two things you’d like to talk about. 
If you submitted an application package prior to the interview, there is a strong possibility that you 
will be asked questions about the information you provided. Review all of the documents you 
submitted, keep the documents nearby during the interview, and be prepared to highlight examples 
of your skills or experiences relating to the strengths you can contribute to the job. Examples of 
areas to concentrate on are problem-solving skills, thoughts on organizational transformation, 
team-building skills, support for the organization’s priorities, your leadership philosophy, your 
ability to adapt and work in fast-paced environments, and decision-making abilities. Also, be able 
to answer the following questions: 
Why should I hire you?  How soon can you report? 
How will this change affect your family? 
What do you see as one of your biggest challenges with a job like this?  Where do you see 
yourself in two to three years? 
Are there any issues to prevent you from accepting or performing in this position? 
Purpose of Interviews. All job interviews are designed with one goal in mind - to find the right 
person for the right job. Employers may have to interview several individuals for a position, so 
keep your goal in mind and let the interviewer see what skills and experiences you can bring to the 
job. Also, not only are you interviewing for a job; you are interviewing the prospective employer 
to see if the job is right for you. Be sure you understand the conditions of the job and ask for 
clarification during the interview, if needed. It is important to determine whether you truly are 
interested in committing the next few years to the potential job or assignment. As the interview 
draws to a close, before the interview is over, take a brief opportunity to provide one or two main 
points that you want the interviewer to remember about you. In other words, have your walk-away 
points in mind so you end the interview on a positive note and reemphasize your interest in the 
position. 
Post-interview Actions. In some cases, it may be appropriate to follow up after an interview. A 
day or two after the interview you may choose to send a short thank-you note to the organization 
with which you interviewed to express your gratitude for the opportunity to interview for the job, 
restate your interest in the position, highlight any particularly noteworthy points, or address 
anything you wish to further clarify. 
15.17. Meetings 
Deciding how to communicate a message is important. If you have a message that can be sent 
clearly and accurately via e-mail, that is one of the quickest forms of sending a message. If you 
need to send a message that requires an immediate response or might need clarification or 
elaboration that could be lost in translation through e-mail, discussing the issue over the phone 
may be the best approach to take. If your message needs to involve multiple people or requires 
dialogue (sometimes on a recurring basis), you may need to have a face-to-face conversation. 
Meetings can be used to share information, solve problems, plan, brainstorm, or motivate. 
Whatever their purpose, you need to know some basics about conducting an effective meeting. A 
way to determine whether a meeting is the most appropriate method of communicating a message 
is to consider if you want to address a group about information, advice, concerns, problem solving, 
or decision-making. Meetings allow for cross-talk to discuss these types of issues, whether within 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
292 
 
 
 
an organization or with outside agencies. 
Once you have decided that a meeting is the most appropriate method of communicating the 
message or issue, the next steps are to define the purpose of the meeting, decide who should be 
invited to participate or be a part of the conversation, decide where and when the meeting should 
occur, plan for capturing (recording) meeting information, send out an agenda so attendees can be 
prepared to discuss pertinent topics, and be flexible based on availability of attendees, information, 
or other considerations. Running the meeting requires that a few simple rules be followed, but not 
to the extent that the meetings are rigid, predictable, and non-productive. As long as you start and 
stay on time, follow the agenda, understand group dynamics, and follow up with well formatted 
meeting minutes, your meeting will have a good foundation for success.

15.18. Writing Platforms 
The USAF has adopted common, basic formats of written communication for official and personal 
correspondence and memorandums. Understanding the purpose of these formats will best serve 
your superiors, yourself, and your subordinates in using the proper format for the intended purpose. 
DAFH 33-337 outlines detailed instructions for written communication, while various 
organizations may have adopted internally preferred styles as well. One key aspect for choosing 
the appropriate format to use for written communication is consistency in your approach. 
Attention to detail, proper format, and pertinent information will ensure written communication 
serves as a professional representation of your organization. 
15.19. Official Memorandum 
Official memorandums are used to communicate throughout the Department of Defense and other 
federal agencies. In addition, official memorandums are used to conduct official business outside 
the government with vendors or contractors when the personal letter is not appropriate. 
Memorandums may be addressed to specific officials, single offices, multiple offices, multiple 
offices IN TURN, or to DISTRIBUTION lists. Detailed information pertaining to the heading, 
text, and closing sections of the official memorandum, as well as additional information, 
attachments, and examples, are provided in DAFH 33-337, Chapter 14. 
15.20. Personal Letter 
Use the personal letter when communication needs a personal touch or when warmth or sincerity 
is preferred. The personal letter may be used to write to an individual on a private matter, such as 
for praise, condolence, or sponsorship. Keep the personal letter brief, preferably no longer than 
one page, and avoid using acronyms. Specific information pertaining to the heading, text, and 
closing sections of the personal letter, as well as forms of address, ranks, abbreviations, additional 
information, and examples, are provided in DAFH 33-337, Chapter 15. 
15.21. Air Force Papers 
The USAF uses written products (papers) in many forms for everyday staff work to serve a variety 
of functions. The types of USAF papers include the point paper, talking paper, bullet background 
paper, background paper, position paper, and the staff study. Be sure that the type of format used 
is appropriate for the task. Samples, explanations, and examples of USAF papers are provided in 
DAFH 33-337, Chapters 16. 
Point Paper. The point paper is used when addressing a single issue that can be covered within a 
single page using bullets or phrases that require minimal data. The function of a point paper is to 
provide a memory jogger, a minimal text outline of a single issue, and to quickly inform others, 
often extemporaneously (with little or no-notice). It can be used to give the same short message 
many times, or to cue a speaker to a recite something from memory. 
Talking Paper. The talking paper is slightly more detailed than the point paper. It is used when 
addressing a single issue that can be covered within a single page using bullets or phrases that 
provide key reference data. The function of a talking paper is to provide notes for a presenter or 
speaker used as an outline or narrative for a single issue to inform others during planned/scheduled 
oral presentations. It is used as a quick reference on key points, facts, or positions, such as 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
294 
 
 
 
frequently asked questions, and can stand alone for basic understanding of an issue. 
Bullet Background Paper. The bullet background paper is used when addressing a single issue 
or several related issues that can be covered within a single page or multi-page format using bullet 
statements providing the background of a program, policy, problem, or procedure. Bullet 
background papers are developed using concise chronology of a program, policy, or problem, and 
can be used to explain or provide details regarding an attached talking paper. 
Background Paper. The background paper is used when addressing a single issue or several 
related issues using a multi-page format including full sentences, details, and numbered 
paragraphs. It is often used as a multi-purpose staff communication instrument to express ideas or 
describe conditions that require a particular staff action. Background papers are developed using 
the detailed chronology of a program, policy, or problem, and can condense and summarize 
complex issues by providing background research for oral presentations or staff discussions. The 
background paper provides a means of informing decision-makers with important details. 
Position Paper. The position paper is used when addressing a single issue or several related issues 
using a multi-page format including full sentences, details, and numbered paragraphs. It is often 
used when working with proposals for a new program, policy, procedure, or plan. Position papers 
are used to circulate a proposal to generate interest, evaluate a proposal, or advocate a position on 
a proposal to decision-makers. 
15.22. Staff Study 
The staff study is used when addressing a single issue or several related issues using a multi-page 
research paper including a detailed discussion with a conclusion and applicable recommendations. 
The purpose of the staff study is to analyze a problem, draw conclusions, and make 
recommendations. Format will vary for staff studies depending on the need or complexity of 
information required. Staff studies are used to assist decision-makers and leaders in initiating 
research, to inform and recommend change, and as a problem-solving thought process in written 
form. Note: Not all organizations routinely use the staff study, but it is an accepted format for a 
problem-solution report for both the USAF and Joint Staff. The value of using a staff study as a 
thought process often outweighs the particular format used to communicate findings. 
Understanding and applying the essential elements of problem analysis via a staff study will enable 
better application of any staff communication. 
15.23. The Staff Package 
The staff package is a writing format commonly used in the USAF for routing or coordinating 
correspondence through a staffing process. A widely recognized aspect of the staff package is the 
AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet. The staff summary sheet, known as the “SSS,” the “Triple-
S,” or the “e-SSS,” is the cover page (the first page) of a staff package. It provides a condensed 
summary of the purpose, background, discussion, view of others (when applicable), 
recommendation, signature blocks, and overall contents of the staff package.

15.24. Speaking Platforms 
Verbal communication includes everyday interactions with coworkers, communicating up and 
down the chain of command, and sometimes speaking to audiences. Being aware of various verbal 
communication platforms can help ensure the message being communicated is delivered and 
received as intended. 
15.25. Delivery Formats 
Your approach to delivery of the spoken message is usually affected by several factors, including 
the time you have to prepare and the nature of the message. Three common delivery formats are 
impromptu, prepared, and manuscript. 
Impromptu. Impromptu speaking is when we respond during a meeting or “take the floor” at a 
conference. Speakers may do this when they have to speak publicly without warning or with only 
a few moments’ notice. To do impromptu speaking well requires a great amount of self- 
confidence, mastery of the subject, and the ability to “think on your feet.” A superb impromptu 
speaker has achieved the highest level in verbal communications. 
Prepared. Prepared speaking or briefing refers to those times when we have ample opportunity to 
prepare. This does not mean the person writes a script and memorizes it, but prepared delivery 
does require a thorough outline with careful planning and practicing. The specific words and 
phrases used at the time of delivery; however, are spontaneous and sound very natural. 
Manuscript. A manuscript briefing is the delivery format that requires every word spoken to be 
absolutely perfect. The disadvantage of a manuscript briefing is that people demonstrate a 
tendency to lack spontaneity, lack eye contact, and they stand behind the lectern with their script. 
These mannerisms may have a tendency of losing the audience’s attention. 
15.26. Types of Speaking 
Typically, the types of speaking used in the USAF include the briefing, the teaching lecture, and 
the formal speech. 
Briefing. The major purpose of a briefing is to inform listeners about a mission, operation, or 
concept. Some briefings direct or enable listeners to perform a procedure or carry out instructions. 
Other briefings advocate, persuade, or support a certain solution and lead the audience to accept 
the briefing. Every good briefing has the qualities of accuracy, brevity, and clarity. Accuracy and 
clarity characterize all good speaking, but brevity distinguishes the briefing from other types of 
speaking. A briefer must be brief and to the point and should anticipate some of the questions that 
may arise. If a briefer cannot answer a question, he or she should not attempt an off-the-cuff 
answer. Instead, he or she should request an opportunity to research the question and follow-up 
with an answer at a later time. 
Teaching Lecture. The teaching lecture is the method of instruction most often used in the USAF. 
As the name implies, the primary purpose of a teaching lecture is to teach an audience about a 
given subject. Teaching lectures are either formal or informal. Formal lectures are generally one- 
way with no verbal participation by the audience. Informal lectures are usually presented to smaller 
audiences and allow for verbal interaction. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
296 
 
 
 
Formal Speech. A formal speech generally has one of three basic purposes: to inform, persuade, 
or entertain. The informative speech is a narration concerning a specific topic, but it does not 
involve a sustained effort to teach. Orientation talks and presentations at commander’s call are 
examples of informative speeches. The persuasive speech is designed to move an audience to 
believe in or take action on a topic, such as recruiting speeches to high school graduating classes. 
Entertaining speeches often include humor and wit to entertain listeners, such as a speech to 
entertain at a dining-out. 
15.27. Basic Communication Tips 
Beginning any communication with basic communication tips in mind and being mindful of others 
when speaking and listening will enhance communication skills in any environment. Some basic 
military communication tips that can be used in any setting are provided here. 
Rank. Differences in military rank can be a barrier (real or perceived) to communication in the 
USAF. Many of us instinctively communicate differently with those senior in rank than we do 
with those with those who are junior in rank. We must constantly strive to be candid, direct, and 
respectful with everyone we communicate with. 
Jargon. Do not overestimate the knowledge and expertise of others when it comes to jargon. Be 
careful with excessive use of career-field specific jargon and acronyms, but feel free to use jargon 
when appropriate. As the speaker, it is your responsibility to ensure your communication is 
understandable. 
DELETED. 
Tone. Tone is not just what you say, but how you say it. Use of tone can be valuable when 
enhancing a message, but it can be difficult to portray in written communication. Speakers use 
gestures, voice, and movements to communicate; writers do not. Emojis ☺ do not have a place in 
written formal communication. Recognize the limitations of expressing tone through written 
communication and pay close attention to how the message may be perceived. 
Courtesy. The first rule of communicating courteously is being polite. Forego anger, criticism, 
and sarcasm, and strive to be reasonable and persuasive. Be patient and tactful, regardless of the 
challenges of delivering a message. If you have to, push back from the computer, take a deep 
breath, slowly count to 10, then review your message to ensure it is professional and courteous. 
Make it Personal. When appropriate, use pronouns, such as we, us, and our, to create rapport and 
keep your audience involved. Using pronouns also keeps your message from being monotonous, 
dry, and abstract. Use I, me, and my sparingly, and be aware of how the use of you can be perceived 
in some situations. 
Formal. “Good morning, Sir.” versus informal “Hey” or “What’s up?” is always the more 
professional approach to greeting or addressing someone. While in today’s USAF much 
communication among peers will be informal, it is essential to recognize, particularly during 
events and ceremonies, when formal, professional communication is appropriate. 
Be Positive. Cultivate a positive message and give praise where praise is due. Rather than focusing 
on problem areas, optimism can encourage acceptance of a message. Also, encourage and be 
receptive to criticism in the form of helpful questions, suggestions, requests, recommendations, or 
information. Audiences often sense and appreciate sincerity and honesty. 
15.28. Communication Delivery 
An effective voice drives home ideas; however, communication experts believe over half of the 
meaning of any message may be communicated nonverbally. Several suggestions for effective 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
297 
 
 
 
verbal and nonverbal communication are provided here. 
Rate. There is no correct speed for every speech. However, consider that people can listen four to 
five times faster than the normal spoken rate of 120 words a minute. So, if you speak too slowly, 
you may lose the interest of an audience who is processing information much faster than you are 
delivering it. Also, consider speaking at a faster rate to indicate excitement or sudden action, or at 
a slower rate to hint at a calm or more serious message. 
Volume. Volume is a verbal technique that can be used to give emphasis to your speech. Consider 
speaking louder or softer to emphasize a point—a softer level or lower volume is often the more 
effective way to achieve emphasis. Depending on the type of room, it may be necessary to talk 
louder in front of a large crowd to ensure everyone in the room can hear the message. When 
possible, use a portable microphone, particularly in large auditoriums. If the audience must strain 
to hear you, they will eventually tune you out from exhaustion, but the front row will not want to 
feel like they are being yelled at the entire time either. 
Pitch. Pitch is the use of higher or lower notes in voice range. Using variety in speech pitch helps 
to avoid monotone delivery and capture the listener’s attention. Starting with a voice range that is 
comfortable for you and then adjusting pitch for emphasis may help make communication more 
interesting. You can use a downward (high to low) inflection in a sentence for an air of certainty 
and an upward (low to high) inflection for an air of uncertainty. 
Pause. Pause gives a speaker time to catch their breath and the audience time to absorb ideas. 
Short pauses usually divide points within a sentence, while long pauses note the ends of sentences. 
Longer pauses can be used for breaks between main points or transitions between an introduction, 
body, and conclusion. Another use for the pause is to ‘pause for effect’ or to set off an important 
point worthy of short reflection. Sometimes a pause may seem long to the speaker, but allow time 
for a true (one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three…) pause for emphasis. 
Articulation and Pronunciation. Articulation and pronunciation reflect mastery of the spoken 
English language. Articulation is the art of expressing words distinctly. Pronunciation is the ability 
to say words correctly. Unfortunately, and unfairly, people may consider word pronunciation or 
mispronunciation as a reflection of your message. Listen to yourself, better yet, if possible, ask 
someone to listen to you for practice, and make sure your words are distinct, understandable, and 
appropriate to your audience. 
Length. In our military environment, you must be able to relay your thoughts and ideas succinctly. 
A key rule in verbal communication is to keep it short and sweet. Know what you want to say and 
say it with your purpose and the audience in mind. 
Eye Contact. Eye contact is one of the most important factors in nonverbal communication. Eye 
contact lets listeners know the speaker is interested in them, allows the speaker to receive 
nonverbal feedback from the audience, and enhances the credibility of the speaker. 
Gestures. Gestures are the purposeful use of the hands, arms, shoulders, and head to reinforce 
what is being said. Effective gestures are natural and should not be distracting to the audience. 
Purposeful, effective body movement can be described as free, yet deliberate movement. 
 
 
15.29. Overcoming Anxiety 
Public speaking is often one of the biggest self-induced fears we experience in the workplace. 
Some individuals appear to be immune to stage fright, while others are paralyzed with fear prior 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
298 
 
 
 
to stepping onto a stage, up to a podium, or speaking from any platform. Most Airmen are exposed 
to public speaking opportunities in academic environments. Additional speaking opportunities can 
help individuals begin to feel more comfortable in the spotlight, such as small, localized events 
(awards ceremonies and commander’s calls) where the audience is familiar. To prepare for these 
events, a draft script may be available to practice with. Having a wingman as a supporter and a 
‘fan’ in the audience can be a big confidence booster while developing public speaking skills. 
Having anxiety about public speaking can hinder the ability to get a message across successfully; 
however, appearing too relaxed on stage may give the impression that the speaker is not fully 
committed to the presentation or to the audience. To overcome anxiety, try to think of it this way, 
most often those in the audience are really just glad it’s not them up there on the stage. And for 
you, you’re on your way to becoming a more confident, competent public speaker by accepting 
the opportunity for personal and professional growth. 
Whether you are engaging in public speaking for the first time or if you have been on the stage 
several times before, here are some simple steps to remember to ensure your message is received 
clearly and as intended. 
Know the material, the script, or topic to be covered at the event. 
Analyze your audience to reduce your fear of the unknown. 
Envision yourself having a successful experience in front of the audience. 
Practice using a recording device, video camera, full-length mirror, or an audience of your 
peers. 
Be prepared to allow yourself to mentally feel confident about the experience. 
Present a professional image to build self-confidence and credibility with the audience. 
Smile, your audience wants you to succeed. Chances are your audience won’t know how 
nervous you are if you don’t mention it. 
Take a short walk right before you go on stage to help release nervous energy. 
When it comes time for the event, it’s time to deliver. Focus your attention on the purpose of 
the event, not on yourself. Connect with your audience. 
When possible, encourage audience interaction, such as head nods or reassuring affirmations. 
15.30. Common Nonverbal Quirks 
While seeking opportunities to sharpen public speaking skills, practice to eliminate some of the 
crutches or habits that speakers sometimes fall into. Tips on overcoming nervous habits are 
included here to help public speakers become consciously aware of them and work to overcome 
them before stepping into the spotlight. 
Life Raft. The life raft is a term used when a speaker seeks the safety and security of a podium 
as though his or life depends upon it. Sometimes standing at the podium is necessary when using 
a stationary microphone, a script, or notes. While this is an acceptable place for a speaker to stand, 
when possible, try to venture away from the podium to connect better with the audience. 
 
Awkward Hands. Awkward hands are typically more of a feeling the speaker has than it is an 
observation of the audience. Simply allowing hands to hang naturally may feel awkward, but it’s 
perfectly natural from the audience’s perspective. Practice allowing your hands to hang naturally, 
and it’ll eventually begin to feel natural.

Caged Tiger. The caged tiger is a term used when a speaker paces across a stage from one side 
to the other without stopping. Using the width of a stage to connect with an audience is a good 
idea, just be sure not to pace back and forth to where the audience feels like they’re watching a 
tennis match. Relax and settle into a natural rhythm of using the stage purposefully. 
Rocker. Rockers are caged tigers on the road to recovery. Rockers have settled their nervous 
energy somewhat, but still have not become completely comfortable with standing still and simply 
talking. As you practice, make a conscious effort not to fall into the habit of rocking on your heels 
or swaying side to side. Much like allowing your hands to hang naturally at your side, with practice 
you will become more comfortable simply standing confidently and addressing an audience. 
Too Cool. Some speakers overcompensate for a fear of speaking by trying to look extremely 
comfortable. It is a good idea to appear relaxed, but not at the expense of appearing unengaged or 
disinterested in speaking to your audience. You may have conquered your nerves, but keep in mind 
that you want to reach your audience and keep their attention. 
15.31. Effective Listening 
Gaining a better understanding of the listening process begins with understanding the difference 
between hearing and listening. Hearing occurs when ears pick up sounds being transmitted by a 
speaker or another source. Listening, on the other hand, involves hearing, while also paying 
attention to and giving consideration to what is heard. In other words, listening involves thinking 
about and making sense of the message. Effective, active listening involves engaging verbally and 
nonverbally in the listening process to appropriately respond, comprehend, evaluate, and 
remember a message. Effective listening helps build trust and mutual respect. Leaders with good 
listening skills often make better decisions. 
Informative Listening. In informative listening, the listener’s primary concern is to understand 
information exactly as transmitted. Successful (effective) listening occurs when the listener 
understands the message exactly as the sender intended. Suggestions for improving informative 
listening are to keep an open mind and set aside bias, listen as if you had to teach it, take notes to 
help recall the main points, ask questions to clarify or confirm your understanding of the message, 
and maximize the use of the time by mentally repeating the message and absorbing the information 
in a way that makes the information more pertinent and applicable to you. 
Critical Listening. Critical listening is usually thought of as the sum of informative listening and 
critical thinking because the listener is actively analyzing and evaluating the message the speaker 
is sending. Critical listening is appropriate when seeking input to a decision, evaluating work or a 
subordinate’s capabilities, or conducting research. Suggestions for improving critical listening are 
to listen as if you had to grade it, take notes to help recall the main points, ask questions to evaluate 
the intellectual content of the message, and maximize the use of the time by first understanding 
the message and then evaluating the information. 
Empathic Listening. Empathic listening is often useful when communication is emotional or 
when the relationship between speaker and listener is just as important as the message. Use this 
type of listening as somewhat of a prerequisite to informational or critical listening. Empathic 
listening is often appropriate during mentoring and counseling sessions and is very helpful when 
communicating with family members.

15.32. E-mail Etiquette 
E-mail is defined as the electronic transmission of information over computer-based messaging 
systems. Technological advancements have increased opportunities for more timely, efficient, and 
effective communications, resulting in the explosive growth of e-mail use throughout the USAF. 
To uphold a commitment to secure messaging, the USAF has established guidelines to be used by 
all USAF members. 
Rule 1: Be Clear and Concise. Make sure the subject line communicates your purpose. Be 
specific and avoid ambiguous titles. Lead with the most important information. If the goal is to 
answer a question, then reiterate the question at the top of the page. Use topic sentences if the e- 
mail has multiple paragraphs. Be brief and to the point. Use bold, italic, or color when necessary 
to emphasize key points. Choose readable fonts, 12 point or larger when possible. 
Rule 2: Watch Your Tone. Be polite. Think of the message as a personal conversation. Be 
careful with humor, irony, and sarcasm. Electronic postings are perceived much more harshly than 
they are intended, mainly because the receiver cannot see the sender’s body language, hear the 
tone of voice, or observe any other nonverbal cues that could help interpret the intent of the 
communication. Do not write using all CAPITAL letters—this is the e-mail equivalent of shouting 
and is considered rude. Keep the e-mail clean and professional. E-mail is easily forwarded. 
Harassing, intimidating, abusive, or offensive material is unacceptable. 
Rule 3: Be Selective About What Message You Send. Do not discuss controversial, sensitive, 
classified, personal, Privacy Act, or controlled unclassified information that requires special 
handling. Remember operations security, even unclassified information, when brought together 
with other information, can create problems when in the wrong hands. Do not create or forward 
junk mail, do not create or send chain letters, and do not use e-mail for personal ads. 
Rule 4: Be Selective About Who Gets Your Message. Reply to specific addressees to give those 
not interested a break, in other words, only use “reply all” sparingly. Get permission before using 
large mail groups. Double-check the address before mailing, especially when selecting from a 
global list where many people have similar last names. 
Rule 5: Check Your Attachments and Support Material. Ensure all information is provided 
as intended in your message to keep from having to send a follow-up e-mail. Before sending, 
ensure you have attached the attachments; this is a very common mistake. When applicable, cite 
all quotes, references, and sources, as required under copyright and license agreements. 
Rule 6: Keep Your E-mail Under Control. Lock or sign off the computer when you leave your 
workstation. If possible, create mailing lists to save time. Read and delete files daily. Create an 
organized directory on your hard drive to keep mailbox files at a minimum. Ensure record copies 
are properly identified and stored in an approved filing system. Acknowledge important or 
sensitive messages with a courtesy reply to sender. When away from your e-mail for an extended 
period of time, consider setting up an “auto reply” message. 
15.33. Government Communication Systems 
Government-provided messaging systems are for official use and limited authorized personal use 
only. All government communications systems are subject to monitoring, interception, search, and 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
301 
 
 
 
seizure for all authorized purposes. Individuals must understand that they may be held responsible 
for the content of their electronic messages and must ensure that messages adhere to acceptable 
use of internet-based capabilities. Individuals are responsible for maintaining sent and received 
information according to USAF records management directives. Electronic messages may be 
subject to requests under the Freedom of Information Act, litigation, and court orders. Be sure to 
adhere to local policy when sending electronic messages to mail distribution lists. Do not auto- 
forward electronic messages from the .mil domain to a commercial internet service provider and 
do not indiscriminately release electronic messaging addresses to the public. 
Identity Management. A vital element for messaging security is the implementation of public 
key infrastructure and common access cards for identity management. Public key infrastructure 
allows for the authentication of the sender identity using a digital signature and the 
encryption/decryption of the message. Users of Department of Defense electronic messaging are 
directed to follow current guidance for the use of public key infrastructure to sign and encrypt e- 
mail. 
Defense Message System. The defense message system is the core messaging system of record 
for the Department of Defense and the USAF. The defense message system is a flexible, 
commercial, off-the-shelf based application that provides messaging services to all Department of 
Defense users (including deployed tactical users), and interfaces with other U.S. Government 
agencies, branches of service, and defense contractors. 
Air Force Organizational Messaging. Organization simple mail transfer protocol mailboxes may 
be used for all organizational messaging requirements unless usage of the defense message system 
is required in support of CCMD responsibilities. 
Privacy Act Information. The Privacy Act of 1974 requires agencies to provide safeguards to 
ensure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect individuals against an invasion of 
personal privacy. Exercise caution before transmitting personal information over e-mail to ensure 
the message is adequately safeguarded. When information is sensitive and personal, e-mail is not 
the proper way for transmitting this information. When sending personal information over e-mail 
within the Department of Defense, ensure there is an official need, and all addressees are 
authorized to receive personal information under the Privacy Act. “Controlled unclassified 
information” is added to the beginning of the subject line, followed by the subject. The following 
statement is applied at the beginning of the e-mail: “This e-mail contains controlled unclassified 
information which must be protected under The Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.” Do not 
indiscriminately apply this statement to e-mails. Use only in situations when you are actually 
transmitting personal information. 
15.34. The Internet 
Use of the web or web-based technologies is a technique for obtaining and disseminating 
information worldwide. The web or internet provides the capability of quickly and efficiently 
disseminating information to, and accessing information from, a variety of governmental and 
nongovernmental sources. Web content must be managed in compliance with all information 
management policies and procedures. 
Use of Internet Resources by Government Employees. The internet provides an indispensable 
source for information from a variety of governmental and nongovernmental sources. The USAF’s 
goal, within acceptable risk levels, is to provide maximum accessibility to internet resources for 
personnel requiring access for official business. 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
302 
 
 
 
Appropriate Use. Government-provided hardware and software are for official use and limited 
authorized personal use only. Limited personal use must be of reasonable duration and frequency, 
approved by the supervisor, and not adversely affect performance of official duties, overburden 
systems, or reflect adversely on the USAF or the Department of Defense. 
Inappropriate Use. Using the internet for other than official or authorized purposes may result in 
adverse administrative or disciplinary action. The following uses are specifically prohibited. 
Use of federal government communications systems for unauthorized personal use. 
Uses that would adversely reflect on the Department of Defense or the USAF, such as chain 
letters, unofficial soliciting, or selling except on authorized internet-based capabilities 
established for such use. 
Unauthorized storing, processing, displaying, sending, or otherwise transmitting prohibited 
content: pornography, sexually explicit or sexually oriented material, nudity, hate speech or 
ridicule of others, gambling, illegal weapons, militancy/extremist activities, terrorist activities, 
use for personal gain, and any other content or activities that are illegal or inappropriate. 
Storing or processing classified information on any system not approved for classified 
processing. 
Using copyrighted material in violation of the rights of the owner of the copyrights. Consult 
with the servicing Staff Judge Advocate for fair use advice. 
Unauthorized use of the account or identity of another person or organization. 
Viewing, changing, damaging, deleting, or blocking access to another user’s files or 
communications without appropriate authorization or permission. 
Attempting to circumvent or defeat security or modifying security systems without prior 
authorization or permission (such as for legitimate system testing or security research). 
Obtaining, installing, copying, storing, or using software in violation of the appropriate 
vendor’s license agreement. 
Permitting an unauthorized individual access to a government-owned or government-operated 
system. 
Modifying or altering the network operating system or system configuration without first 
obtaining written permission from the administrator of that system. 
Copying and posting Controlled Unclassified Information, critical information, and/or 
personally identifiable information on Department of Defense owned, operated, or controlled 
publicly accessible sites or on commercial internet-based capabilities. 
Downloading and installing freeware/shareware or any other software product without 
designated accrediting authority approval. 
Malicious Logic Protection. Protect information systems from malicious logic (virus, worm, 
Trojan horse) attacks by applying a mix of human and technological preventative measures. Scan 
approved removable media devices for viruses before and after use if scans are not automated. 
Report any suspected information system abnormalities (antivirus errors, virus alerts, unexpected 
file size increases, unexpected disk access, strange activity by applications) immediately to the 
organizational information assurance officer. 
Operations Security and the Internet. When accessing internet-based capabilities using federal 
government resources in an authorized personal or unofficial capacity, individuals shall comply 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
303 
 
 
 
with operations security guidance as stated in AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC), and 
shall not represent the policies or official position of the USAF or the Department of Defense.

16.1. Knowledge is Power 
For more than 70 years, Americans have asked Airmen to be the sentinels of air and cyberspace 
for the nation, delivering unmatched capabilities and support to the Joint Force in defending our 
homeland, owning the high ground, and projecting power with our allies. In every mission, in 
every domain, and in every location, Airmen are essential to our nation’s success. America’s 
USAF, while transforming into a smaller, leaner, and more capable force, continues to fight the 
war on terrorism and prepares to face new threats and conflicts of the future. To remain dominant, 
we must maintain our airpower advantages over potential adversaries. We must embrace change 
and facilitate a culture that embodies courage and innovation. 
16.2. Advancing Department of the Air Force Priorities 
It is our agile and innovative Airmen and Guardians who power the Department of the Air Force. 
Everything Airmen and Guardians do should advance or augment DAF priorities. The priorities 
will help ensure our Air and Space Force remains lethal and ready when the nation calls: 
Build the United States Space Force, 
Modernize the Air and Space Force we need, 
Grow strong leaders and resilient families, 
Strengthen our allies and partners. 
16.3. Chief of Staff, United States Air Force Professional Reading Program 
In 1996, General Fogleman created the Chief of Staff, USAF Professional Reading Program to 
develop a common frame of reference among USAF members—officers, enlisted, and civilians— 
to help each become better, more effective advocates of airpower. The Chief of Staff, USAF 
Professional Reading Program can help launch a career-long reading habit or supplement previous 
reading materials. Topics, although the majority detail airpower from its genesis to recent times, 
include insight into USAF history, analysis of ongoing conflicts and their relevancy to the future, 
organizational and leadership success stories, and lessons learned from recent conflicts. These 
sources provide great examples of leadership to illustrate qualities Airmen should emulate. 
The reading list is particularly relevant as civilian men and women take on more responsibility in 
these times of global terrorism and international conflict. Each Chief of Staff of the Air Force has 
subsequently enhanced and continued the program with current and relevant material for the force. 
The program currently includes books, films, documentaries, briefings, presentations, 
publications, journals, and other online resources. The professional reading list and a brief 
summary of new selections can be found on the AF Portal (https://www.my.af.mil/) and the CSAF 
Leadership Library (https://www.af.mil/About-Us/CSAF-Leadership-Library/).  
16.4. Guardian and Airmen Innovation Network 
Guardian and Airmen Innovation Network (GAIN) Program is the Department of the Air Force 
innovation program that solicits suggestions and ideas from Airmen which contribute to the

effectiveness, efficiency, enterprise replication, cost savings/avoidance, and other improvement of 
operations or programs related to the Air and Space Forces.

16.5. DELETED. 
16.6. Mental Frames 
Each of us uses mental frameworks and shortcuts to simplify our understanding of a complex 
world. The use of frameworks helps us process information quickly and efficiently. Frames consist 
of our assumptions about how things are related and how they work. This effect is particularly 
noticeable when framing a challenge as either a risk or an opportunity. Research shows that the 
human mind naturally estimates the expected return associated with a risky situation. Leaders of 
any organization or decision-making team must be careful about imposing mental frames on 
themselves and their teams where critical thinking is needed. 
Prospect Theory. Prospect theory is commonly recognized as the act of framing a situation as a 
potential gain that causes decision-makers to act differently than when framing the same situation 
as a potential loss. Prospect theory helps explain our tendency to escalate commitment based on 
sunk costs instead of making rational evaluations. Based on sunk cost arguments, leaders often 
take on more risk, committing additional resources to avoid losses even when the chances of 
success are low. Gamblers placing bets even when they are experiencing a losing streak is an 
example of prospect theory in that the ‘chances’ of winning seem greater with each chance taken. 
Change. Another implication of framing is how organizations react when faced with changes in 
the operating environment or mission tasking. At the organizational level, threats to our 
comfortable framework of assumptions are often met with rigid resistance, while changes we see 
as opportunities are met with flexibility and adaptability. As human beings, Airmen are subject to 
the initial frameworks we establish when confronting change. For good or bad, these frameworks 
act to limit the information we take in, our willingness to fairly and unbiasedly assess information, 
and ultimately restrict the solution sets we create. Consciously avoid an inherent tendency to view 
change as threatening. Intentionally framing change as an opportunity may allow others to freely 
exercise the habits of mind necessary to make well informed decisions. 
Analogies. Analogies are often powerful decision-making tools. Great innovative breakthroughs 
can sometimes occur when analogies from one field or domain are applied to another. Reasoning 
by analogy occurs when we assess a situation and match it to similar experiences we have 
previously encountered. At the conscious level, analogies can be used to save time and provide 
clues about courses of action and implications for a decision-making process. However, without 
deliberate consideration, analogies may lead us to focus on similarities between events and 
downplay important differences. When allowing analogy in decision-making, effort should be 
made to clearly separate fact from assumption. The act of questioning assumptions in any decision- 
making process is, at its heart, how we apply the habits of mind necessary for good critical thought. 
Intuition. Intuition can complement a decision-maker when used in conjunction with the 
evaluation of a whole series of alternatives and not solely based on objective analysis. A strength 
of using intuition is that it is based on matching patterns from previous experiences to cues picked 
up in the current environment. Based on recognition of patterns, decision-makers may select a 
course of action as if reading a script instead of truly exploring options. Having decided on an 
initial preferred course of action, senior leaders often mentally play out a solution, and if it seems 
feasible, they go with it. Note: Proper use of combined intuitive judgment along with formal 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
307 
 
 
 
analysis may be an effective decision-making technique. Formal analysis can check intuition, 
while intuition is useful in validating and testing assumptions that underlie analysis. As Airmen, 
recognizing the value of intuition is just as critical as guarding against a lack of analysis in the 
decision-making process. 
16.7. Critical Thinking in Groups 
Conventional wisdom holds that groups make better decisions than individuals because they draw 
from a base of talent and experience. However, Airmen must be conscious of how group decisions 
are made and create teams capable of applying critical thought to problems in group settings. 
Airmen engaged in group decision-making must consciously structure the process to encourage 
critical thinking to prevent momentum from simply leading the group toward conformity. There 
are a few things to consider when using groups for decision-making. 
Who should be involved in the decision process? 
In what sort of environment should the decision take place? 
How will the participants communicate? 
How will the leader control the decision process? 
Wisdom of Groups. While keeping in mind that groupthink does exist, consider establishing 
groups for decision-making, made up of members that represent many different disciplines and 
areas of expertise. Have the group discussions in a decentralized location, be able to effectively 
aggregate all the individual judgments, and seek group members who are independent, meaning 
not subordinate to one another. 
Hindrances to Groups. Behaviors that are contradictory to working in groups, such as 
withholding information for personal reasons or filtering information should not be tolerated. 
Another behavior that should not be allowed is selectively presenting information up the chain of 
command to inadvertently affect the group’s efforts. In addition to this, leaders who are in 
positions to make decisions based on the recommendations of a group should be aware of how 
the group was set-up and how well it operated to have an understanding of what the decision was, 
as well as the dynamics of how the decision was made. 
Decision-Making Teams. When creating or observing qualities of good teams, look for 
individuals who are able to sway others in the crowd. Seek out and encourage individuals who are 
able to contribute and speak up when in a group dynamic. Group members who demonstrate 
independence and the ability to overcome hierarchical stigmas will often prove to be strong team 
members. Another quality for group members is one that encourages honest, candid analysis and 
contributions from others, even when not in complete alignment with their own. The most 
successful groups will consist of a good balance of individuals who do not dominate discussions, 
but also do not constantly remain in the background. 
16.8. Groupthink 
Groupthink is a common decision trap and one of the major causes of flawed decision-making in 
groups. Groupthink occurs when tremendous pressures within the team demand conformity and 
express a strong desire for unanimity at the expense of true critical thinking. Causes of groupthink 
can stem from strong personalities or influences that overpower or hinder others from being equal 
contributors to the group, or they can stem from individuals choosing not to speak up in a group 
so they may be allowed to participate without taking risks or exposing themselves to adverse 
opinions from others in the group. Whatever the reason for groupthink, it puts the entire group at 
a disadvantage and should be addressed quickly to get the group back on track toward achieving 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
308 
 
 
 
its purpose for convening. 
Symptoms of Groupthink. To prevent groupthink, Airmen must be aware of the symptoms. 
Common indicators of groupthink include: the group demonstrating a feeling of being invulnerable 
or egocentric, there is a tendency to rationalize away disconfirming data and warning signs of 
ineffective judgment or critical thinking, the group concludes topics with a feeling of unanimity 
regarding particular views, individuals are pressured when they present dissenting views, and 
group members regress in their desire or ability to contribute to the group. 
Reducing Groupthink. If groupthink is present, outside consultation may be required to get the 
group on the right track. In other cases, Airmen can work to minimize structural barriers to candid 
dialogue and reduce groupthink tendencies within their organization. Some ways to reduce 
groupthink include: defining roles within decision-making teams by giving responsibility to 
members for aspects of the analysis process and holding them accountable for representing these 
perspectives within the group and inviting healthy disagreement during the analysis process to 
encourage candid dialogue. 
16.9. Influence of Dissenting Airmen 
What should you do if you are part of a group, and you are concerned the group will make a bad 
decision? It may seem obvious, but it is important that you speak up during the group’s 
discussions. 
Groups tend to make better decisions when exposed to an opposing view because group members 
become more likely to see the situation from different angles. 
When making yes/no decisions (e.g., guilty/not-guilty verdict on a jury), groups typically make 
decisions that the majority of group members would have recommended if asked independently 
and anonymously. For example, 85% of the time the majority position on a jury’s first ballot will 
end up being the group’s final decision. 
However, in most decision-making contexts, there are many possible alternatives, and even a 
single opposing view can encourage groups to consider a broader range of possible options. For 
example, imagine only two civilian candidates applied for a job. The question posed to the group 
may have originally been framed as “Should we hire Candidate A or Candidate B?” While it may 
seem like there are only two options (you support Candidate B, while others support Candidate 
A), there are probably other alternatives. For example, could the position be re-advertised to 
encourage more people to apply?  Could one of the candidates be detailed to the position so the 
group can re-evaluate based on initial performance before making a final decision?  Could the 
position be filled by a military member rather than a civilian? 
Even a single opposing view can foster divergent thinking (generation of a range of possible 
alternatives). So even if a group does not ultimately adopt your specific position (i.e., hire 
Candidate B), group members will be more likely to think of other possible alternatives that they 
may not have otherwise considered or shared. As a result, good group decisions become more 
likely. 
16.10. Critical Judgment 
Professor Andrew J. DuBrin, Doctor of Industrial/Organizational Psychology, stated that a high 
performance team demands sincere and tactful criticism among members. In the USAF, it is 
imperative that feedback is welcomed and encouraged among team members, as well as from a 
broad spectrum of sources. Receiving information is a way of giving consideration to new, 
different, and often better ways of performing. The willingness to accept and show appreciation 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
309 
 
 
 
for constructive criticism increases self-awareness and improves team effectiveness. By 
encouraging and considering critical feedback, teams can redirect focus and energy to correct 
problems quickly rather than allowing them to intensify. For feedback or criticism to be 
productive, the collective purpose for the feedback must be for all parties involved to ultimately 
have the same expected outcome – to improve a process or procedure that positively contributes 
to the mission. Note: Honesty is important; however, brutal honesty can be offensive. Giving 
constructive criticism requires a focus on fixing or improving upon a problem, not focusing on 
problems for personal or oppositional gain. 
16.11. Addressing Conflict Positively 
Disagreement between participants in any decision-making process is necessary to stimulate 
inquiry and analysis. The challenge for leaders is to create constructive conflict while retaining the 
teamwork and relationships necessary for future decision events. In the decision-making process, 
debate focused on the issues and ideas at hand (cognitive conflict) is constructive. On the other 
hand, emotional and personal outbursts (affective conflict) are not. A key aspect of managing the 
decision process is to stimulate cognitive conflict to advocate positions and analysis—debating 
concepts, but not attacking the person representing them. Airmen in leadership positions should 
clearly establish ground rules for interaction during deliberations and require participants to 
respect each other’s cognitive and analytical styles. 
16.12. Indecision 
Indecision is not solely a problem with leaders, organizational cultures, or complex topics. 
Indecision often occurs as a result of combinations of all three. The aspect of organizational 
cultures can be addressed by recognizing patterns of behavior that manifest dysfunction within the 
decision-making process. Three harmful organizational cultures are briefly described here. 
The Culture of No. Organizations with a culture of no have established a decision-making process 
where lone dissenters are able to issue non-concurs within the planning process, effectively 
blocking overall organizational goals because they conflict with internal sub-organizational 
interests. This culture can arise in organizations where meetings focus on dissections of proposals 
instead of true debate and analysis. Leaders who reward subordinates based on their ability to 
dissect other’s ideas without providing alternative courses of action enable and promote a culture 
of no. In a culture of no, dissenters tear down or block proposals and ideas rather than critique a 
proposal with the intent of strengthening it. 
The Culture of Yes. Organizations with a culture of yes have established an environment where 
dissenters tend to stay silent. This silence becomes a tacit endorsement of the proposal without the 
benefit of analysis and debate. In this form of organizational culture, once a decision is made, 
subordinates later express disagreement to distance themselves from a decision or to undermine 
the implementation of the plan. Airmen operating in this type of culture must understand that 
silence does not mean assent and watch for those not contributing to the discussion. Overcoming 
this cultural tendency requires leaders to bring constructive conflict within the decision process to 
the surface and analyze concerns and alternative interpretations of evidence. 
The Culture of Maybe. Under the culture of maybe, decision-makers work to gather as much 
information as possible, which often results in ‘analysis paralysis.’ Under analysis paralysis, 
decision-makers constantly delay action because they think more information and analysis will 
clarify their choice. This culture tends to develop in organizations facing highly ambiguous 
situations or in organizations where competing sections/leaders practice conflict avoidance as 
opposed to open analysis and debate. In these organizations, decision-makers must balance the 
benefit of gaining more information against the diminishing returns they provide, as opposed to 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
310 
 
 
 
initiating action. While leaders are seldom able to accurately calculate the cost versus benefit of 
waiting for additional clarity, intuitive judgment serves as a cut-off for unnecessary delay. 
16.13. Decision-Making Outcomes 
Procedural Justice. The process by which a decision is made significantly influences 
implementation and follow-through of the solution. The key aspect to the outcome of a critical 
decision is consensus among the team responsible for enactment. In many cases, consensus does 
not mean unanimity; consensus is a commitment to, and shared understanding of, the desired 
outcome. 
Procedural Fairness. Airmen must work to make sure a decision process is fair and legitimate. 
Even when participants agree with the chosen course of action, if they do not see the process as 
legitimate, they are often disenchanted with the outcome. Procedural fairness provides support to 
decision-makers, especially when they are making unpopular decisions. Fair processes help build 
consensus, but more importantly, aid in implementation because participants feel that all 
perspectives have been considered and analyzed. If decision-makers are subjective in their 
analysis, participants lose faith in the decision process, making it difficult to support the outcome. 
Providing participants with time and venues to express their positions and a transparent system of 
weighing different perspectives is important. When final decisions are made, the fairness of the 
process is what allows Airmen to rally around the designated way ahead with confidence that the 
decision-maker considered all aspects before finalizing which course of action to pursue. Note: 
From an application standpoint, some leaders seek consensus as a means of empowering their 
people; however, the adage that “a camel is a horse built by consensus” is not so farfetched. Great 
leaders do not seek consensus—they build it. 
Procedural Legitimacy. Procedural legitimacy in decision-making occurs when the decision 
process is perceived to be in line with an organization’s socially accepted norms and desired 
behaviors. To create an organizational culture of decision legitimacy, leaders should provide a 
process roadmap at the beginning of the decision process, reinforce, and demonstrate an open 
mindset, engage in, and encourage active listening, separate advocacy from analysis, explain the 
decision rationale once made, express appreciation for everyone’s participation, and express how 
alternative inputs contributed to the process. 
16.14. Accidents, Deviance, and Consequences 
Within the USAF, like any other organization, decisions made in highly complex, tightly 
integrated environments may have unanticipated consequences. If Airmen are unaware of, or have 
failed to think through decisions, catastrophic failure can result. With the understanding of the role 
all Airmen play in using the habits of mind for critical thinking, the following sections examine 
perspectives on decision-making failure. 
Normal Accident Theory – Structural Perspective. The normal accident theory rests upon the 
assumption that in any highly complex high-risk organizational structure, decision failures are 
unavoidable. High-risk systems are systems classified by their complexity and the coupling of 
multiple processes occurring in conjunction with one another. Systems that are interactively 
complex and tightly coupled are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic failure stemming from 
mistakes made by decision-makers, often small mistakes, which go unrecognized or uncorrected. 
In coupled (interdependent) systems, tight interactions based on poor decisions can magnify 
normal accidents into system-wide failure. In simple linear processes, such as an assembly line, 
failure has a visible impact on the next process, but is identifiable and limited. When interactions 
are nonlinear and affect a variety of other systems, the failure of one component has unanticipated 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
311 
 
 
 
effects on many subsystems. If the subsystems are tightly coupled (highly interdependent) a failure 
quickly causes changes in multiple systems nearly simultaneously, making it hard for leaders to 
diagnose the symptoms and determine the extent of the failure. Because Airmen project power 
globally, anticipation of the impact from even minor deviations from procedure or instruction, is 
extremely challenging. 
Normalized Deviance Theory – Behavioral Perspective. The normalized deviance theory is the 
gradual acceptance of unexpected events and risks as a normal behavior in the operating 
environment, including the acceptance of lower standards. This practice of producing shortcuts or 
variations to normal procedures eventually becomes normalized to the point where the deviance is 
no longer noticed. Deviations become accepted as new norms and are no longer assessed using the 
habits of mind necessary to identify causes and find solutions. As organizational members become 
accustomed to the reoccurrence of seemingly minor but unpredicted anomalies, they become less 
concerned with the potential catastrophic effects of more severe failures of the same system. 
A classic case of normalized deviance is the example of the Challenger space shuttle disaster. In 
this case, the erosion of O-rings was not within acceptable tolerances. However, after its 
occurrence, several times with no catastrophic result, the members of the organization accepted 
their erosion as a normal and acceptable event, despite deviation from their engineering standards. 
In this case National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as an organization, was working hard 
to make space flight feel routine. The organization’s culture, combined with cognitive bias and 
external pressures, led to the normalization of a potentially catastrophic failure. 
Airmen must be aware of the type of organization they operate within and understand its complex 
interactions. We should guard against substandard procedures by continuously questioning the 
way we do business, consciously identifying the “close-calls” and deviances from normal 
operations and ensuring deviations from standards are analyzed as part of the decision-making 
process to gain an understanding of how to improve programs and implement new decisions. 
Practical Drift. Within large organizations, sub-unit leaders at all levels make decisions to 
maximize efficiency. They establish localized rules and procedures that comply with the overall 
intent of the organization. Over time, these procedures become accepted practice. Similar to 
normalizing deviance, this practice causes organizational norms to drift. Often, this drift is 
unproblematic; however, under ambiguous conditions in complex interactive environments, 
divergence may lead to altered expectations and poor information flow (resulting in catastrophic 
cross-system failure). 
Airmen must be aware of how their decisions at the local level tie in with overall organizational 
goals, standards, and expectations. Leaders must use their awareness of organizational goals and 
standards to monitor practical drift in their areas of responsibility, recognize disciplined initiative, 
and maintain standards consistent with outside expectations. Airmen in positions of responsibility 
must work to temper practical drift and create a culture where critical thinking is applied to 
ambiguous threats. This goal can be accomplished by developing processes for identifying and 
analyzing small problems and failures and treating them as potential indicators of larger problems. 
Effective techniques include empowerment of front-line workers and flattening hierarchies to 
reduce information filtering. Leaders can further minimize the problems associated with practical 
drift, by: 
Creating and encouraging transparency in organizational structures and systems to identify 
local practical drift and understanding the “why” behind local standards. 
Avoiding ‘Band-Aid®’ approaches to small problems by fixing the root cause across the 
system, as well as creating a climate of candid dialogue to review and revisit standards and seek

312 
 
 
 
problems. 
Monitoring seams where information is handed off between units and organizations. 
Conducting careful after-action reviews focused on process improvement. 
Ambiguity. The challenge for Airmen of all ranks is that ambiguous threats do not trigger 
organizational responses. The failure to apply critical thinking to ambiguous threats means the 
recovery window between the emergence of the threat and its occurrence as a catastrophic failure 
may narrow. Airmen at all levels must be aware that ambiguous threats may go unaddressed due 
to information filters caused by structural complexity and inter-organizational power dynamics.

16.15. Learning is Power 
Effective Airmanship requires good decision-making. From Airman Basic to General, the 
decisions each of us make every day impact the delivery of airpower. The habits of mind necessary 
for becoming a critical thinker are developed over time. Each of us must work every day to make 
good decisions by consciously applying the intellectual analysis necessary to account for 
complexities. The process of decision-making is as important as the information analyzed. The 
habitual application of critical thinking methods to the gathering and analysis of information helps 
reduce our unconscious and natural tendency to accept an available option as satisfactory without 
actually exploring all feasible options before making a decision. 
16.16. Digital Literacy (Information Literacy) 
Decision makers must be informed and capable of distinguishing information relevant to the 
decision at hand. 
Fortunately, the internet has made more information available than ever before. This allows for 
immediate access to information from a wide variety of sources and provides the potential for 
real-time updates as conditions change. However, because internet information is not regulated for 
quality and accuracy, it is particularly important to critically evaluate sources and consider the 
potential for inaccuracy or misinformation. 
To become a critical consumer and internet user, a common best practice is to apply the “CRAAP 
test,” which is a list of questions to evaluate potential information. The CRAAP acronym stands 
for Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose: 
Currency (timeliness): When was the information published or last updated? Have newer articles 
been published on the topic? Does your topic require recent information, or will older sources work 
as well? 
Relevance (importance of the information for your needs): Does the information answer your 
question? Who is the intended audience? Is the information at an appropriate level (i.e., not too 
simple, or overly technical for your needs)? 
Authority (source of the information): Who is the publisher or sponsor? What are the author’s 
credentials or organizational affiliations? Is the author qualified to write on the topic? 
Accuracy (reliability, truthfulness, and correctness of content): Is the information supported by 
evidence? Was the information reviewed by editors or subject experts before it was published? 
Can you verify any of the information in other sources? 
Purpose (the reason the information exists): Is the information intended to inform or teach? Or is 
it intended to sell, entertain, or persuade? Does the point of view appear objective and impartial? 
Are there political, ideological, cultural, religious, institutional, or personal biases? 
In general, aim to rely on sources that have strong incentives to present accurate information. There 
may be little consequence to the writer of a blog or message board post if they get facts wrong. 
For-profit companies may purposely mislead in order to present their company and products 
positively. However, information in newspaper articles or scientific papers is normally reliable; 
errors in these forums can seriously damage the author’s reputation. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
314 
 
 
 
16.17. Analytical Thinking 
Informed decision making requires more than gathering and evaluating facts. It requires analytical 
thinking to systematically break information apart, compare different aspects of a problem, and 
organize information to address complex, multidimensional issues. 
As a first step, exercise healthy skepticism and consider several potential causes of what you 
observe. One can often avoid errors in analytical reasoning by recognizing a few basic principles: 
Limitations of Small Sample Sizes. Judgments based on a large number of observations (large 
number of people, events, etc.) are more likely to be accurate than judgments based on a small 
number of observations. 
Example: Imagine you decided to get a college degree as part of your personal growth. You have 
a program in mind, but there are so many educational institutions to choose from. You have 
narrowed your choice to University A or University B. You have several friends that attend each 
school. Your friends at University A all really like the school; your friends at University B are 
very dissatisfied with their school. However, when you visit University B you have a good 
experience and like the students and professor that you met with. In contrast, during your visit to 
University A, you get the brush-off from the professor you tried to speak with and didn’t “click” 
with the students you met. 
Which school should you attend? Many people will say you should attend University B because 
you personally had a positive experience (“go with your gut”). While that’s not necessarily wrong, 
it is important to fully recognize the limited duration of your visit (How much of the school did 
you see? How many different classes did you sit in on? How many students, professors, etc. did 
you interact with?). In comparison, your friends at University B will have had much more 
extensive opportunities to interact with many others at the school over a longer time period. 
Take the time to base your decisions on a larger number of observations when possible. 
Impressions based on a few days, or a few people will usually not be as accurate as judgments or 
data based on a larger number of observations. 
Correlation Doesn’t Imply Causality. It is important to consider how different factors are 
interrelated, and whether changing (increasing or decreasing) one factor may impact others. Even 
when two factors are clearly related, do not immediately assume that one factor is causing the 
other. 
To make firm conclusions, ensure that you are making fair comparisons. While the real world does 
not lend itself to carefully designed double-blind randomized clinical trials (the “gold standard” 
for scientific research), it is important to apply the concept of the control group when making 
judgments. Before scientists determine that a pill causes a certain health outcome, they compare 
outcomes for those who have taken the pill to outcomes for those who have not. Before concluding 
that the pill caused the difference in outcomes, they ask an important question: Are the two groups 
otherwise (mostly) the same? 
For example, imagine that a base offered XYZ supplements for free to all RegAF members. 
Members who took the free supplements improved their physical fitness test scores after taking 
the supplements, while there was no change in the physical fitness test scores of others. 
Before you conclude that XYZ supplements cause improved physical fitness, ask some questions. 
Consider whether the people who took XYZ supplements differed in important ways from those 
who didn’t. Maybe there was a self-selection bias: members who exercised more or ate healthier 
foods (i.e., were more motivated to improve their fitness) were more likely to choose to take 
Vitamin XYZ. Or maybe Vitamin XYZ takers were younger than non-takers, or less likely than 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
315 
 
 
 
non-takers to have pre-existing health conditions. 
The more similar the two groups, the more reasonable it would be to conclude that XYZ 
supplements cause improved physical fitness. Deciding to take XYZ supplements may or may not 
be a good idea. Before you make that decision though, consider whether you’re making a fair 
comparison. 
16.18. Creative Thinking and Creative Problem Solving 
Creative problem solving involves two distinct components: Divergent Thinking and 
Convergent Thinking. Divergent Thinking is defined as the ability to generate multiple varied 
solutions to a given problem. Brainstorming is a divergent thinking task. Convergent Thinking, in 
contrast, is a process that seeks out the correct or best possible solution (from identified 
possibilities). 
With formal education and training, we tend to improve in Convergent Thinking skills, but we 
tend not to improve (may even worsen) on Divergent Thinking. Yet both processes are important 
for effective problem solving. 
The Osborn-Parnes model is one recommended problem solving approach that incorporates 
Divergent and Convergent Thinking. Central to this approach is the principle of deferred 
judgment. This principle requires that we allow a period of time to let ideas flow freely (apply 
Divergent Thinking) without internal or external evaluation. Only after we have identified many 
possible ideas, should we evaluate them (apply Convergent Thinking). 
The model consists of the following stages: each stage involves successive Divergent and 
Convergent Thinking tasks (in each stage, letting ideas flow freely before applying judgment): 
1. Mess Finding. Identify the problem that you want to address. What do you want to change?  
Summarize the problem as a “How to…” statement (e.g., “How to reduce the number of 
Airmen calling in sick”) 
2. Data Finding. Seek out all relevant facts that apply to the situation. Ask the five Ws: 
Who is involved? 
What is involved? What are some examples of the problem? 
When does it or will it happen? 
Where does it or will it happen? 
Why does it happen? 
Then try to identify what additional facts about the situation are lacking and where you might 
search for them. Get the facts. 
3. Problem Finding. Describe what you want to accomplish in more specific terms. 
Ask yourself: “In What Ways Might We…” (IWWMW) address the situation. Brainstorm 
many problem statements. What you initially thought you wanted to accomplish might reflect 
another concern, desire, or need. 
After reflection, select the problem statement(s) that captures the most important or underlying 
problem (e.g., “Decrease the spread of COVID-19 in the squadron”). 
 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
316 
 
 
 
4. Idea Finding. Identify as many potential solutions to the problem as possible. 
Thinking of many ideas (even far-out, odd, or unusual ideas) is critical. Write all the ideas 
down. It is often helpful to set a numeric goal (e.g., 50-75 ideas) before you discuss or review 
the ideas. 
If time permits, incubate (sleep on it, let your mind wander) to generate additional ideas. 
Positive mood and rest facilitate brainstorming. 
In a group setting, it can sometimes help to have members offer ideas anonymously. Extrinsic 
motivations (e.g., to impress others with great ideas) can undermine divergent thinking. 
Anonymity may help group members feel safe to put forward ideas that go beyond the tried-
and-true. 
Only after you have allowed time to generate many ideas should you begin to evaluate them 
and narrow the list (e.g., to select 6-8 ideas that seem to have the greatest potential). 
5. Solution Finding. Use a list of selected criteria to choose the best solution. 
First create a preliminary list of criteria that should be used to evaluate your ideas (e.g., time, 
cost, feasibility, safety, impact on morale) 
Identify which criteria are most critical and assign a weight to the importance of each criteria 
(e.g., using a 1-10 scale, where 10 is most important). Then use a decision matrix, Table 16.1, 
to rate each idea (each potential solution) on each of the criteria: 
 
Criteria 1 
Criteria 2 
Criteria 3 
Idea 1 
Idea 2 
Idea 3 
Table 16.1. Decision Matrix Example 
Multiply the ratings by the weight assigned to each of the criteria. Idea(s) that are evaluated most 
favorably on the highest weighted criteria should be the preferred solution(s). 
6. Acceptance Finding. Attempt to gain acceptance for the solution, develop a plan of action, 
and implement the solution (follow through). 
16.19. Decision-Making Model 
There are a wide range of decision-making models available for leaders, whether in the military or 
corporate structure. One decision-making model that has been adopted by the military is the 
Vroom-Yetton-Jago Decision-Making Model, used for deciding how to decide. According to this 
model, there are five primary levels of decision-making, each requiring a different level of 
involvement or complexity for the decision-making process. The following is a brief description 
of each of the five levels of decision-making and some pros and cons associated with each level. 
Level I: Decide and Announce. In this level, leaders make the decision and announce or present 
it to the group or organization. This approach can allow leaders to make and implement decisions 
quickly, but to avoid possible indifference or lack of motivation. In this approach, the leader 
controls the decision and the situation. Leaders should explain rationale as to why the decision was 
made unilaterally. Cons associated with this approach are that leaders may not take the time to 
consider all the necessary information. By not including others in the decision-making process, 
leaders may alienate members of the group or organization unnecessarily. 
Level II: Gather Input from Individuals and Decide. In this level, leaders gather input from 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
317 
 
 
 
selected individuals, or the group individually and then make the decision. This approach can allow 
leaders to consult with recognized experts to gather additional information to make a more 
informed decision but does not require a meeting with the entire group. Cons associated with this 
approach are that others in the group may wonder why the leader did not consult with them. They 
may perceive the leader as playing favorites, which could result in some resistance from the group 
or organization when it comes time to implement the decision. 
Level III: Gather Input from the Group and Decide. In this level, leaders gather input from the 
group and then make a decision. This approach of including the group in gathering the data 
enhances the chance for synergy and better-informed decision-making. Cons associated with this 
approach are that if a leader makes a decision different from what the group suggests, the group 
may feel that their inputs or suggestions were not valued or appreciated. The group may feel that 
the decision-making process was predetermined by the leader and that the interaction was a façade, 
which will likely result in members of the group undermining implementation or being unwilling 
to participate in future decisions. Also, this approach does take more time for the leader to make 
the decision. 
Level IV: Facilitate Consensus. In this level, leaders present issues or problems to the group and 
facilitate the decision-making process within the group. If the group is unable to reach consensus, 
the leader has the option to make the decision. This approach of allowing the group to generate 
possible decision options enhances buy-in and ownership of members of the group, educates 
members of the group, and allows for quicker implementation as more people are knowledgeable 
about the decision process and what needs to be done. This approach helps build and sustain trust 
and respect between group members. Cons associated with this approach are that it takes more 
time. Also, there is the possibility that the decision could be one that is adequate, but not optimal 
due to the nature of groups arriving at a compromise to reach an agreement and the leader needing 
to accept the decision or facilitate further decision analysis. 
Level V: Delegate with Constraints. In this level, leaders delegate the problem to the group and 
authorize the group to make the decision within specified boundaries. Leaders do not abandon the 
group but facilitate support and resources to enable the group’s success in making a decision. 
This approach is good for building team leadership skills and allows ownership of the decision 
by the group. It also frees the leader to focus on other issues. Cons associated with this approach 
are that it takes more time, it may lead to a decision not viewed by the leader as optimal, and the 
team may not have the skills to reach a quality decision, resulting in disharmony among the group 
rather than pride in ownership over the decision. Note that the Osborn-Parnes process can be 
applied regardless of who provides input or makes the final decision. For example, leaders can 
apply the Osborn-Parnes process to reach a decision independently (Level I: Decide and 
Announce). They can involve others in Idea Finding only (Level I or II: Gather Input and Decide). 
Or they can encourage others to apply the Osborn-Parnes process (Level IV or V: Facilitate 
Consensus or Delegate with Constraints).

16.20. Expansion 
Innovation, technological edge, advanced skills training, future capabilities… How do we ensure 
we are prepared for the future? Clarifying what we do know and what we don’t know is one place 
to start. Here are a few statements that emphasize our need to stay on the cutting edge. 
Fifth-generation aircraft are critical to penetrate adversaries’ existing air defenses, but other 
nations continue to invest in advanced air defense systems. 
Adversaries are fast followers of American technology, constantly narrowing the gap and 
looking for ways to surpass or defeat American innovation. 
Even adversaries who can’t compete with American airpower in the sky challenge our air 
superiority by using ground-based systems and technology. 
Maintaining air superiority into the future requires consistent investment in technology and 
research today. 
As adversary technology narrows the gap, highly trained American Airmen provide the 
advantage. 
Training against rigorous and realistic threats is vital to prepare Airmen to react within seconds 
during real world operations. 
The lack of budget stability and predictability makes it difficult for the USAF to modernize 
training technology and facilities and ensure our pilots maintain an edge over adversaries. 
16.21. Empowerment 
Today’s leader has the almost impossible task of keeping up with ever-changing technology. 
Today’s junior members have knowledge, skills, and abilities that open unlimited opportunities to 
maximize work center effectiveness. Leaders must encourage Airmen to develop their capabilities 
and foster their willingness to improve organizational effectiveness. Empowered followership, like 
motivation, requires a joint effort between leaders and the individuals they lead. This effort must 
be continuously promoted. The mission is best served when the leader helps followers develop 
their own initiatives, encourages them to use their own judgment, and allows them to grow. As a 
result of promoting empowered followership, creativity and innovativeness improve dramatically. 
Empowerment is a force that energizes people and provides responsibility, ownership, and control 
over the work they perform. Delegation is not empowerment; however, effective empowerment 
does require good delegation. Assigning tasks and allowing the freedom and authority to creatively 
accomplish those tasks is the essence of empowerment. Empowerment allows workers to become 
stakeholders in the organization’s vision. Once committed to the vision, members participate in 
shaping and fashioning a shared vision. This synergistically developed vision motivates people to 
focus on what the future holds, not simply because they must, but because they want to. 
The military is traditionally an authoritarian organization. The need for rapid decision-making and 
crisis response normally necessitates a traditional hierarchical framework; however, complex 
hierarchical frameworks do not always result in rapid decisions. Furthermore, the continual 
transformation of leader-follower roles is heralding an environment that allows both leaders and 
followers to more effectively realize organizational goals and objectives. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
319 
 
 
 
Historically, truly great leaders of the past never directly told their people how to do their jobs; 
rather, they explained what needed to be done and established a playing field that allowed their 
people to achieve success on their own. Consequently, the follower’s success became a success 
for the leader and the organization. When leaders solicit input, they discover the knowledge, 
interest, and parameters of support. Empowerment enhances organizational performance by 
promoting contributions from every member of the organization. Trust is the cornerstone of the 
mutually dependent relationship shared by leaders and followers; therefore, leaders must be 
flexible and patient in introducing empowerment. By delegating decisions to those closest to the 
issues and by allowing Airmen flexibility in how they implement the vision the leader successfully 
allows others to take ownership and experience pride in achieving the vision. Recognition is a key 
factor in perpetuating improvements. Hence, an important facet of empowerment is the appropriate 
recognition of contributions Airmen make to maximizing mission success. 
16.22. Empowered Airmen Culture 
The USAF aims to build a culture where we identify Airmen’s needs, champion their solutions, 
eliminate roadblocks, push back detractors, and celebrate the innovative mindset. The Airmen of 
today are already well-versed in innovative technologies and will propel us into the USAF of 
tomorrow by integrating data-centric processes at the core of our operations. Machine learning and 
new technologies will lead us to a new age of human-to-machine teaming by putting Airmen ‘on’ 
the loop instead of ‘in’ the loop. The USAF will automate where appropriate to free Airmen to do 
human things while letting machines do machine things. 
Maintaining our ability to adapt and innovate quickly is the greatest challenge we face in the future.  
We are charged with a no-fail mission of providing effective Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and 
Global Power—today, tomorrow, and into the future. In modern war, no other nation has achieved 
such an asymmetric advantage. If the past two decades have taught us anything, it is that the 
demand for airpower is growing. The USAF will seek to increase innovation, and research where 
we need to maintain a competitive advantage. 
Rapid change is the new norm, and it is a major vulnerability to those unable to adapt; however, it 
can become an advantage to the agile who are able to swiftly develop and field solutions to 
problems. The answers to our most complex security issues will be delivered by harnessing the 
power of innovators and entrepreneurs within the USAF, across our country, and throughout the 
world. We must drive innovation to secure our future. 
16.23. Collaboration Fosters Innovation 
Airmen at all levels participate in decision-making. The habits of mind necessary to assure we 
apply critical thought are something we must consciously foster. Our highly educated force brings 
to the table a wide variety of views, experiences, and abilities; providing the USAF a deep pool 
of talent from which to draw ideas. By using the techniques of good decision-making and fostering 
the development of habits of mind, we tap into that rich pool of talent. 
When time allows, we must consciously create processes to think through decisions using critical 
analysis of all factors, ensuring we focus on doing what is best for the nation and the USAF. This 
effort to create habits of mind pays off when we must make decisions quickly and under great 
pressure. During these times we naturally apply the decision-making processes we use every day. 
The USAF leverages many channels to empower our Airmen and industry partners to submit ideas 
as part of our overarching culture of innovation. Collaboration can facilitate ideas and often align 
efforts toward innovative concepts and technologies. Partnerships with outside groups, including 
traditional and non-traditional industry partners and academia, bring new ideas to the innovation

process. While the USAF is leveraging new and existing technologies to provide rapid and 
affordable solutions, it is investing in game-changing technologies, such as autonomous systems, 
unmanned systems, hypersonic, directed energy, nanotechnology, and stimulating new thinking 
about future ways of warfighting and battlefield success.

17.1.  DAF Emergency Management Program 
The ability of the DAF to carry out its mission of Great Power Competition directly depends on 
continuance of the mission in the face of adversity. Challenges to mission accomplishment may 
take on many forms, to include natural and man-made disasters, terrorist use of weapons of mass 
destruction, and hostile attacks that threaten the United States and its interest. The DAF 
Emergency Management (EM) Program was developed to ensure the readiness of our forces to 
save lives; minimize the loss or degradation of resources; and continue, sustain, and restore 
operational capability in an all-hazards threat environments at DAF installations worldwide.  
17.2.  DAF EM Program Mission 
The primary mission of the DAF EM Program is to prevent, protect, prepare for, respond to, and 
recover from all hazards/threats that pose the greatest risk to lives, key resources, facilities, 
infrastructure, and operational missions. The ancillary mission supports homeland defense and 
provide support to civil and host nation authorities; antiterrorism programs; and the countering 
weapons of mass destruction enterprise. The DAF EM Program accomplishes these missions 
through the seven pillars of EM preparedness: Risk Management, Planning Framework, Common 
Core Capabilities, Capability Evaluation and Validation, Program Management Reviews, 
Capability Investment Strategy, and Adaptation via Information. Brief definitions of the EM 
Program mission areas are provided here:  
Prevention. Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. 
Prevention involves actions to protect lives and property. 
Protection. Protection provides the capabilities necessary to protect the installation against all 
threats, hazards, and manmade or natural disasters. 
Response. Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response includes 
immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and meet basic human needs. Response also 
includes the execution of emergency operations plans and of incident mitigation activities 
designed to limit the loss of life, personal injury, property damage, and other unfavorable 
outcomes. 
Recovery. The development, coordination, and execution of service- and site-restoration plans 
for impacted communities and the reconstitution of government operations and services through 
individual, private sector, nongovernmental, and public assistance programs that: identify needs 
and define resources; provide housing and promote restoration; address long-term care and 
treatment of affected persons; implement additional measures for community restoration; 
incorporate mitigation measures and techniques, as feasible; evaluate the incident to identify 
lessons learned; and develop initiatives to mitigate the effects of future incidents. 
Mitigation. Activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property or to lessen the 
actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident. Mitigation measures may be 
implemented prior to, during, or after an incident.

aligned in various roles which generate interoperability to and through 1) operational levels, 2) 
planning and risk management, 3) incident command and coordination, and 4) command and 
control. The DAF EM Program is comprised of specific organizational offices and responders 
known as the Disaster Response Force (DRF) that respond to disasters/incidents and manage and 
conduct response operations. These specific offices and their responsibilities are briefly described 
here and in further detail in DAFI 10-2501, Emergency Management Program.  
Emergency Communications Center (ECC). The ECC is a 24-hour a day, seven days a week 
operation and incorporates the core functions of fire and emergency services, security forces, and 
medical dispatch. ECCs provide emergency communications, alarm, sensor, and video 
monitoring, incident or event communications supports, tactical channel assignments, emergency 
notification, responder reachback capability, and notification of an emergency to the medical 
treatment facilities.  
Incident Commander (IC). The IC is responsible for all incident activities, including developing 
strategies and tactics and ordering and releasing resources. The IC has overall authority and 
responsibility for conducting and managing incident operations at the incident site.  
First Responders. First responders include Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES), medical, 
security forces, and other personnel who immediately engage in activities to save lives, stabilize 
the incident, and prevent further property damage. 
Emergency Responders. Emergency responders are the response elements of a DRF that deploy 
after the first responders to expand IC capabilities and perform support functions. Emergency 
responders include but are not limited to the follow-on elements of EM, Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) defense specialists, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) 
personnel, physicians, nurses, medical treatment providers, and mortuary affairs personnel. 
Specialized and Support Teams. Teams are formed from the existing installation and unit 
personnel to support emergency response and/or recovery operations. Examples include Damage 
Assessment, Search and Recovery, Aircraft Crash Damaged or Disabled Recovery, Spill 
Response, Hydrazine Response Team, Emergency Family Assistance, Disaster Mental Health, 
Medical Response Teams, Contingency Contracting, Bioenvironmental Engineering, and others. 
Control Centers. Control Centers are activated during the EOC activation and provide expertise 
and resource support to the EOC director and serve as the command and control node for all 
installation units tasked in the Installation Emergency Management Plan.  
Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The EOC is the installation’s critical function to address 
imminent or realized threats/hazards and coordinate support to the incident command, on-scene 
personnel, and/or other EOCs.  
Command Post. The Command Post is a full-time, 24/7 Command and Control (C2) node, 
directly responsible to commander(s) and serves as the focal point of operations, including the 
receipt and dissemination of orders, information, and requests necessary for the C2 of assigned 
forces and operations. 
Crisis Action Team (CAT). The CAT is the top echelon of installation mission continuation and 
sustainment. The CAT includes senior officers and senior enlisted leaders across the A-Staff and 
supporting units. Members of joint, civilian partners, and/or host nation partners may also be 
present. The CAT supports the installation commander by assessing the situation, determining 
mission priorities, and directing subordinate units. Note: The CAT is intended to focus on mission 
continuation and sustainment and not the management of the incident.

17.3. Expect the Unexpected 
Natural disasters, man-made hazards, and technological hazards can create emergency conditions 
in a wide variety, magnitude, scope, urgency, and degree of damage and destruction. Disasters or 
incidents resulting from a threat or hazard can occur at any time with little or no advance warning. 
These incidents can be local or widespread, predictable, or unpredictable. Emergency plans help 
prepare for and mitigate the impact of these threats on an installation, personnel, and the mission. 
17.4. Installation Emergency Plans 
Installations must develop plans for the hazards likely to affect their areas based on appropriate 
response, mitigation, and recovery procedures. Installation emergency management plans provide 
comprehensive guidance for emergency responses to various incidents. Information on these 
types of hazards is provided here.  
Natural Disasters. These types of disasters are non-routine events that occur and cause severe 
damage that may require assistance. This includes hurricanes/typhoons, tornadoes, storms, high-
water, high winds, tidal waves, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, mudslides, 
snowstorms, fires, floods, explosions, and droughts.  
Technological Hazards. These are man-made events caused by a malfunction in a technological 
structure or human error in controlling the technology. Technological disasters can be as serious 
as a natural disaster and can cause loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic 
disruptions, or environmental degradation. They can happen with little to no warning. Examples 
include hazardous materials release and nuclear power plant failures.  
Man-Made Hazards. This is an event that is non-routine and exceeds the capacity of the affected 
area to respond to in a way that saves lives, preserves property, and maintains the affected region’s 
social, ecological, economic, and political stability. These disasters include technological hazards, 
such as hazardous material releases and spills, acts of terrorism, active shooters, and nuclear 
accidents. Other examples include crime, arson, civil disorder, war, biological/chemical threat, 
cyber-attacks, pollution, fires, and transportation accidents.  
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Hazards. CBRN hazards, to include 
toxic industrial chemicals and toxic industrial materials (TIC/TIMs), cause adverse effects 
through deliberate release and dissemination. Terrorist threat or use of CBRN materials are an 
emerging transnational threat used as asymmetric measures of intent. Defense against these 
threats requires all DAF personnel to plan, prepare, respond, and recover from CBRN incidents. 
Each threat agent presents a unique hazard, more information regarding these threats can be found 
in DAFI 10-2503, CBRN Defense Program.  
Chemical Agents. A chemical substance that is intended for use in military operations to kill, 
seriously injure, or incapacitate mainly through its physiological effects. Chemical agents, 
categorized according to their physiological effects, include lung damaging agents (choking), 
blister agents, blood agents, incapacitating agents, and nerve agents. Chemical agents can be 
delivered through a variety of means, such as tactical ballistic missiles, bombs, artillery, grenades, 
mines, and spray attacks. Due to their persistent nature, nerve and blister agents pose as a primary 
threat to air bases. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
324 
 
 
 
Biological Agents. A microorganism (or a toxin derived from it) that causes disease in personnel, 
plants, or animals or causes the deterioration of materiel. Biological agents include viruses, 
bacteria, fungi, and toxins cultured from living organisms. These agents may be found as liquid 
droplets, aerosols, or dry powders, and can be adapted and disseminated through any of these 
forms as adversarial weapons. Symptoms of biological attacks may not be experienced 
immediately after contact. Each agent has a different exposure (incubation) period before 
infection. 
Radiological and Nuclear. Radiation is a broad term that applies to a wide range of phenomena. 
Light (infrared to ultraviolet), radiofrequency emissions, and microwaves are all forms of 
radiation known as nonionizing radiation. In general, nonionizing radiation produces heat when 
it interacts with the body. In contrast, ionizing radiation has sufficient energy to produce ions 
when it interacts with matter (including the human body). Radiation causes harmful effects as it 
alters or destroys cell processes and structures essential for the normal functioning of cells. 
Adversaries may disseminate radioactive materials across an area without a nuclear detonation. 
However, adversaries may also disseminate radioactive materials by detonating nuclear weapons 
at various altitudes to include subsurface, surface, airburst, or high altitude. The primary concerns 
of a nuclear detonation include blast/shock, thermal radiation (heat), ionizing radiation, and 
ballistic debris for surface and shallow subsurface bursts. Nuclear blasts may also pose an 
electromagnetic pulse hazard that can cause widespread communications or electrical problems. 
Toxic Industrial Chemical. A chemical developed or manufactured for use in industrial 
operations or research by industry, government, or academia that poses a hazard. 
Toxic Industrial Material. A generic term for toxic, chemical, biological, or radioactive 
substances in solid, liquid, aerosolized, or gaseous form that may be used, or stored for use, for 
industrial, commercial, medical, military, or domestic purposes. Most toxic industrial materials 
present a vapor (inhalation) hazard and may also reduce the oxygen concentration below that 
required to support life. In the event of a toxic industrial material incident, the most important 
action is to immediately evacuate to an area outside the hazard’s path, if feasible. It is important 
to be aware that the protective mask, ensemble, and military standard collective protection filters 
are not designed to provide protection from toxic industrial materials. If evacuation is impractical, 
implement shelter-in-place procedures.

17.5. Preparedness and Protection Procedures 
DAF installations must take actions to protect, prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate 
the effects of an attack or incident to ensure we can conduct prompt, sustained, and decisive 
operations in a contested environment. Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction and CBRN 
threats requires extraordinary preparedness. Established and conducting preparedness actions 
effectively and efficiently will increase the protection of mission critical resources and force 
survivability. Actions should be considered mission critical and given a high priority when the 
threat of an enemy attack is high. Installations will establish multiple actions to counter these 
attacks during the preparedness phase, often dependent on the intelligence, the installation’s threat 
probabilities, and recommendations provided by subject matter experts. DAF personnel should 
understand the importance of knowing an installation’s preparedness actions well before an 
attack.  
17.6. DAF Warning and Notification Signals 
Emergency Notification Signals. Every DAF installation must have a rapid and effective system 
to quickly disseminate emergency notifications and information such as watches, warning, 
evacuation routes, and protective actions. When a disaster or incident affecting the installation is 
imminent or in-progress, personnel must respond to directions communicated over mass warning 
and notification systems or other communication channels, whether visual or audible. Personnel 
should be familiar with the installation’s warning and notification systems and are highly 
encouraged to enroll in mobile device notifications to ensure prompt, informed, and ready 
responses to local emergencies.  
Attack Warning Signals. These signals are used to notify personnel of warnings or impending 
attacks. The warnings may be communicated through mass notification and warning systems, 
display of alarm condition flags, or through other communication channels. Attack warning 
signals are used to posture installations for attacks, warn of attacks in progress, initiate post attack 
recover actions, and return the installation to normal state of readiness. Note: attack warning 
signal variations may be used in some geographical regions. Personnel will be notified of these 
variations before departure of home station and/or upon arrival into the region.  
Three to Five Minute Steady Tone. The three-to-five-minute steady tone indicates a disaster or 
incident is imminent or in progress. Individual actions are to be alert, take cover or evacuate to 
safety, follow instructions, and account for personnel. 
Three to Five Minute Wavering Tone. The three-to-five-minute wavering tone indicates an 
attack or hostile act is imminent or in progress. Individual actions are to be alert, execute security 
measures, follow instructions, and account for personnel. 
Lockdown, Lockdown, Lockdown. The announcement lockdown, lockdown, lockdown 
indicates an active shooter incident is in progress. Individual actions are to remain calm and 
implement lockdown procedures. 
Shelter-in-Place. The announcement indicates a natural disaster warning or a technological 
disaster warning requiring personnel to immediately take shelter indoors and perform actions 
according to the Emergency Action Plan to protect personnel within the building from the hazards. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
326 
 
 
 
Actions for natural disasters may include taking refuge in an interior room without windows and 
doors and taking cover. Actions for technological disasters may include taking refuge in a pre-
designated room, shutting off heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, and covering vents and 
doors with plastic.

All Clear. The announcement all clear indicates the immediate disaster or threat has ended. 
Individual actions are to remain alert, account for personnel, and report hazards, injuries, and 
damages. 
17.7. Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) Levels 
MOPP levels are established to quickly communicate the required individual protective 
equipment and protection levels for in-place forces to take in the event of CBRN operations or 
attack conditions. The installation commander determines the initial level, based on MOPP 
condition analysis, and adjusts levels as mission priorities and intelligence changes. MOPP levels 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
327 
 
 
 
are used in conjunction with alarm conditions listed in paragraph 17.6. to quickly increase or 
decrease protection against threats.  
Split MOPP. Split MOPP is a tactic used to divide an installation or operating location into two 
or more CBRN zones, rather than having to declare the entire installation contaminated. If 
movement or travel between zones is necessary, zone transition points are used to contain 
contamination while allowing the movement of people, equipment, and needed supplies in and 
out of established zones. 
17.8. Individual Protection 
Individual protection is comprised of singular use or a combination of individual protective 
equipment, vaccinations and prophylaxes, protective shelters, evacuation, relocation, exposure 
control, contamination control, and warning and notification systems. Individual protection 
measures are taken in stages equivalent to the urgency and nature of the threat. Command and 
theater-specific instructions will direct the proper individual protective postures.  
Ground Crew Ensemble. Regardless of the type of agent, concentration, or method of attack, 
the best immediate protective equipment against chemical agents is the ground crew ensemble, a 
whole-body system which protects the wearer against chemical-biological warfare agents, toxins, 
and radiological particulates. Individual protection includes a protective mask with filters, 
overgarment, protective gloves, and footwear covers or overboots. It also includes M8 and M9 
detector paper, reactive skin decontamination lotion, and M295 decontamination kits. Knowing 
the specific MOPP gear that must be carried and/or worn during the various MOPP levels is 
essential to ensuring the best protection possible in all conditions. As depicted by DAF 
Emergency Management, Table 17.1. is provided to show appropriate individual protective 
postures for MOPP levels.

Personnel Sheltering 
All installations are required to conduct threat-based shelter planning. The installation 
commander is responsible for establishing a shelter management plan and should designate 
responsibility for preparing and operating each shelter during an attack or incident. Shelters are 
structures that protect personnel from the effects of CBRN or hazardous material release over 
extended periods. Shelter selection is based on structural and personnel housing capabilities in 
relation to potential types of disasters. Personnel may be required to shelter-in-place in the event 
the type or extent of the hazard is unknown or evacuation at the time would be dangerous. To 
ensure the inside of facilities do not become contaminated, occupants will close all windows and 
doors, and turn off ventilation systems at the time of the suspected attack. Refer to AFMAN 10-
2502, Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) Standards and Procedures, for shelter-
in-place and shelter management information. Refer to DAFI 10-2503 for additional information 
on wartime sheltering and collective protection.  
Collective Protection Systems (COLPRO). COLPRO can be a fixed-site or expeditionary 
location to provide protection from CBRN agents by utilizing an overpressure system to keep 
threat agents outside of certain facilities, ultimately allowing the occupants to work or rest inside 
the facility without wearing protective gear. Many of these facilities will have integrated 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
329 
 
 
 
contaminated control areas where contaminated personnel are able to enter the facility once 
decontaminated and outer garments are removed. 
17.10. Critical Resource Protection 
Prior to a CBRN attack, every installation must determine which equipment and assets can be 
stored, protected, or covered to shield against contamination and damage. Protecting these vital 
resources will minimize, or completely remove, the requirement to decontaminate them for 
mission use after an attack. To the maximum extent possible, aircraft, support vehicles, aerospace 
ground equipment, and munitions should be moved inside or covered. Bulk supplies should be 
placed in shelters or under overhead cover. If equipment cannot be placed under overhead cover, 
it must be covered or wrapped with at least one layer of barrier material to prevent contamination. 
When possible, use two layers of barrier material to cover the tops of vehicles and equipment. 
This will serve to ensure contamination can be removed, safely discarded, and replaced, as 
necessary. Personnel should be trained and take care when removed barriers to prevent 
contamination transfer.

17.11. Crisis Response Actions 
Crisis response actions during and after a CBRN attack are critical, not only to ensure the DAF 
mission is continued, but more importantly, for survival. In threat areas, contamination avoidance 
is the key to keeping assets and personnel from becoming contaminated. During attacks, the 
primary focus of the base populace should be directed toward force survivability to ensure attack 
warning signals and MOPP levels are rapidly disseminated. Typically, the command post will 
disseminate attack warning signals, alarm signals, and MOPP levels at the recommendation of 
the CBRN Control Center within the EOC.  
Department of Defense resources, including those associated with military installations located 
nearest the scene of an accident or incident, will respond to the event unless otherwise directed 
by higher headquarters. Upon witnessing an incident, personnel should alert others in the 
immediate area and report the incident to security forces, fire and emergency services, or 
installation command and control. After reporting, personnel should stay uphill and upwind; avoid 
inhaling fumes, smoke, or vapors; attempt to rescue and care for casualties; avoid handling any 
material or component involved in the accident/incident; evacuate the area if rescue or 
containment is impractical, or as directed. Note: Every situation is different and should be handled 
using established procedures coupled with good judgment. DAF personnel who recognize an 
attack in progress should take immediate action regardless of whether or not mass notification has 
been disseminated. When alarm red is declared, or attack begins without notification, drop to the 
ground, don protective mask (if not donned already), crawl to closest available protection, don 
remaining individual protective equipment, and immediately check every member in your 
immediate area to make sure they are protected and have donned the proper equipment. Assist 
injured and provide self-aid and buddy care with caution to prevent further injuries, particularly 
when under fire. Using one’s best judgment is essential regarding seeking immediate cover in 
place or crawling immediately to a safe location, particularly when an area becomes increasingly 
dangerous. 
17.12. Attack Reporting 
If an attack or enemy movement is observed, report it up the chain of command immediately. Use 
the S-A-L-U-T-E reporting method as shown in Table 17.2. as a quick and effective way to 
communicate attack information. S-A-L-U-T-E reports are submitted to the control center or work 
center through the most secure means.

17.13. Recovery Procedures 
Recovery actions focuses on saving lives, detecting, and mitigating hazards, mission restoration, 
and sustainment. Immediate actions are necessary to treat casualties, assess damage, and control 
contamination. Minimizing the amount of personnel exposed to post-attack hazards is critical for 
mission continuation and force survivability. The recovery concept involves a combined effort 
from personnel who are trained to operate as a team and are able to use specialized equipment to 
spearhead recovery efforts. Reestablishing the mission is a top priority.  
Reconnaissance. The installation commander will determine when base specialized and unit 
reconnaissance teams begin post-attack CBRN surveys. Control centers will be directed to release 
post-attack reconnaissance (PAR) teams to collect information about the effects of the attack. 
PAR teams or resource owners are responsible for reporting information to their respective control 
center as well as marking and reporting contamination and contaminated equipment to ensure 
approaching personnel are aware of the hazard associated with the resource. The control center 
will forward survey information to the CBRN Control Center within the EOC.  
Post-Attack Reporting. Effective communication between PAR teams and leadership is 
essential. The CBRN Control Center within the EOC is the primary command and control 
function for collecting and consolidating post-attack information. The EOC Director up-channels 
information and makes recommendations regarding alarm signals and MOPP levels to the CAT 
based on the information collected by specialized and PAR teams.  
Decontamination. For those not on a PAR team, recovery actions include performing immediate 
decontamination (if contaminated) and remaining under cover in a safe location unless otherwise 
directed. Control centers will assess and determine what methods of decontamination, if any, can 
be reasonably put into action. The eyes are very vulnerable when exposed to nerve and blister 
agents. If one of these agents gets in the eyes, the eyes should be irrigated with water. If a chemical 
agent gets on the skin or protective equipment, it must be removed immediately. The reactive skin 
decontamination lotion and M295 individual decontamination kits are the most effective methods 
of removing chemical agents. In the absence of an individual decontamination kit, personnel 
should contact the CBRN Control Center for recommendations. Note: 5-percent chlorine solution 
for equipment and 0.5 percent chlorine solution for skin decontamination should only be used 
after consultation from CBRN Defense Specialists as some chemicals react negatively to 
chlorine.

17.14. USAF Mishap Prevention Program 
The DAF safety management system is a mishap prevention framework, mandated by DAFI 91- 
202, The U.S. Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, designed to minimize risk and reduce the 
occurrence and cost of injuries, illnesses, fatalities, and property damages. The challenge of 
deployments, technologically advanced combat systems, and changing duty requirements 
demands strong on-duty mishap prevention programs. Off-duty mishap prevention must also 
adapt to meet the challenges posed by motor vehicles, sports and recreation, and other off-duty 
activities. DAF leaders implement the safety management system by providing guidance and 
goals, establishing safety responsibility and accountability, applying risk management to all 
activities, and promoting safety throughout the organization.  
17.15. Mishap Defined 
A DAF mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in occupational 
illnesses, death, or injury to DAF personnel, or damage to Department of Defense (DoD) property. 
Four categories/classes that distinguish mishap severity are defined here. DAF safety 
investigations are for mishap prevention purposes only, not for punitive actions or to establish 
financial liability.  
Class A Mishap. A Class A mishap consists of costs totaling $2,500,000, destruction of a 
Department of Defense aircraft, or a fatality or permanent total disability.  
Class B Mishap. A Class B mishap consists of costs totaling $600,000 or more but less than  
$2,500,000, a permanent partial disability, or inpatient hospitalization of three or more personnel.  
Class C Mishap. A Class C mishap consists of costs totaling $60,000 or more but less than  
$600,000, or a nonfatal injury or illness that results in one or more days away from work.  
Class D Mishap. A Class D mishap consists of costs totaling $25,000 or more but less than  
$60,000, or a recordable injury or illness not otherwise classified as a Class A, B, or C mishap.  
17.16. Hazard Reporting 
The AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report, must be readily available in all work centers. When a 
hazard cannot be eliminated immediately, notify the safety office, responsible supervisor, or local 
agency by telephone or in person, and submit a hazard report. Individuals will report personal 
injury, property damage, and any suspected exposure to hazardous materials as soon as practical, 
but not to exceed 24 hours. Individuals should immediately report a physical or mental condition 
they feel could impact safe job performance. Reports can be submitted anonymously. If a hazard 
is eliminated on the spot, no further action is required; however, sharing information with other 
units or agencies is recommended to help prevent hazards and deficiencies elsewhere.  
Hazard Report Investigations. Investigators must respond to reports in writing, within 10 duty 
days, addressing the corrective action or plans, and conduct follow-up reviews until the corrective 
action is completed.  
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

17.17. USAF Mishap Prevention Program-Safety Organization 
All DAF personnel will utilize comprehensive risk management principles, processes, tools, and 
techniques to assess and mitigate risk associated with both on- and off-duty activities. An effective 
mishap prevention program depends on individuals integrating mishap prevention principles at 
every functional level and taking personal and collective responsibility for complying with and 
enforcing applicable safety standards.  
Safety Office. At the installation level, safety staffs, host, and tenant units implement mishap 
prevention programs as prescribed by DAFI 91-202 and applicable host tenant support 
agreements. The safety office staff consists of career safety professionals who are first-term and 
career Airmen trained in the enlisted safety career field (AFSC 1S0X1), as well as DAF civilians. 
When mishaps occur, the safety staff ensures all mishaps are investigated and reported. With the 
assistance of commanders, supervisors, and individuals, the host safety office staff provides 
oversight of the installation safety program and provides support and guidance to help eliminate 
unsafe acts or conditions.  
Unit Safety Representative. To ensure each unit is actively engaged in mishap prevention, 
commanders will implement safety and health programs and appoint a primary and alternate unit 
safety representative to assist them in implementing their safety programs, to include procurement 
and proper use of personal protective equipment, and worker/facility compliance with applicable 
standards. Roles built into unit safety programs include using risk management techniques to 
analyze work environments and job tasks for hazards; developing work-center-specific job safety 
training outlines on safety, fire prevention, protection, and health requirements; and monthly spot 
inspections of the work areas.  
Individuals. All individuals hold a vital role in preventing mishaps. A failure to intervene when 
a potential unsafe act is identified is a failure to protect. Every DAF member is accountable for 
considering their personal safety and the safety of others when participating in on- and off-duty 
activities. Individuals are responsible for complying with all safety instructions, technical orders, 
job guides, and operating procedures. They identify and report hazardous conditions that place 
DAF personnel or property at risk to supervision and/or submit the hazard using the AF Form 
457.  
Air Force Safety Center. As a key component of the DAF Mishap Prevention Program, the Air 
Force Safety Center works to ensure a safe environment and a safety mindset for all Airmen and 
Guardians. The Chief of Safety, who also holds the title of Commander, Air Force Safety Center, 
heads the organization and is located at the Pentagon with the Deputy Chief of Safety and support 
staff. The Air Force Safety Center is composed of the Vice Commander and 10 divisions at 
Kirtland Air Force Base. There are several agencies directly linked to the Air Force Safety Center 
that have specialized areas of responsibility with regard to ensuring and maintaining safety in the 
DAF.  
Analysis and Cyberspace Operations Division. The Analysis and Cyberspace Operations 
Division mission is to leverage information technology, in a cost effective manner, to support the 
safety mission for the Air and Space Forces. The division develops and sustains the unique safety 
reporting system called the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) which collects and 
maintains safety related data, used by the DAF and DoD safety communities to investigate 
mishaps, and mitigate hazards for all safety disciplines. This system also provides an analysis and 
trending capability through its comprehensive safety database. This database enables the safety 
center to rapidly respond to both internal and external customer requirements for mishap safety 
data. The division also supports all cyber security, communications, and information technology

systems for the entire safety center.  
Aviation Safety Division. The Aviation Safety Division consists of safety-trained professionals 
spanning the domain of flight. The division preserves warfighting capability by establishing DAF 
aviation safety policy, promoting mishap prevention programs for all aviation assets and through 
the establishment of proactive safety programs. It oversees the aviation mishap investigative 
process, the collection and accuracy of flight safety data and the disposition of risk-mitigating 
actions. It provides proactive and reactive engineering and operational analyses of flight safety 
issues. Additionally, the division directs the Recorded Aircraft Information Program, the 
Hazardous Air Traffic Report Program, the Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Program and the 
Mishap Analysis and Animation Facility.  
Occupational Safety Division. The Occupational Safety Division manages the DAF 
occupational safety program, including operational, industrial, occupational, sports and 
recreation, and traffic safety. This division has oversight responsibility for the safety risk 
management program efforts for the DAF mishap prevention program. It oversees integration of 
safety inspections, assessments, and evaluation policy in conjunction with the USAF inspector 
general. The division manages Air and Space Forces safety standards and interprets Department 
of Labor and industry standards for implementation throughout the DAF. The division conducts 
evaluations of service-wide occupational safety mishap investigations and provides advice to 
investigators in the field through their parent Major and Field Commands. The division is 
responsible for the development and content of formal occupational safety-related training 
courses for supervisors and safety professionals. It develops and oversees occupational safety 
policy, programs, and procedures to provide a safe work environment and enhance the safety of 
Airmen and Guardians while off duty to help maintain combat capability and readiness. It is the 
USAF office of responsibility for all OSHA-related guidance and processes for dealing with the 
Department of Labor in regard to inspections, investigations, and recordkeeping.  
Human Performance Division. The Human Performance Division supports the DAF safety 
mission to safeguard Airmen and Guardians, protect resources and preserve combat capability by 
addressing the number one cause of Air and Space Forces mishaps: human error. The division 
includes experts from medicine, physiology, psychology, aircraft operations, and aircraft 
maintenance. These experts help investigators examine how human behavior contributes to 
mishap risks and causes. They further analyze mishap data and provide policy recommendations 
to commanders. The division administers the Air Force Combined Mishap Reduction System 
(AFCMRS) survey and can provide commanders an Organizational Safety Assessment (OSA). 
The division trains DAF safety professionals in human factors principles and in the DoD Human 
Factors Analysis and Classification System. The Human Performance Division is home to the 
fellowship training programs for physiologists and aviation psychologists.  
Weapons Safety Division. The Weapons Safety Division establishes and defines USAF nuclear 
surety and safety policy for the development and operational use of all nuclear, conventional, and 
directed energy (DE) weapons systems. The division oversees the USAF Nuclear Weapons Surety 
Program, delegated from the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The 
division provides nuclear, conventional and DE weapons systems safety design certification, 
Hazard of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance certification, USAF explosives safety 
standards, explosive siting reviews, weapons safety consultation and Federal Department of 
Agriculture waivers for DE systems. The division ensures application of corrective actions and 
mishap inclusion to the AFSAS for weapon-related mishaps. The division also performs radiation 
safety oversight, explosives hazard classifications, mishap prevention programs, mishap 
investigation, and staff assistance in its areas of responsibility. The division leadership chairs

several multi-agency boards performing safety oversight for all nuclear, conventional, and DE 
(laser and radio- frequency) weapons.  
Training and Force Development Division. The Training and Force Development Division 
serves as the foundation of excellence in ensuring the continuous professional development of all 
personnel assigned to safety staffs and/or supporting safety throughout the Air and Space Forces. 
The program develops, teaches, and manages the requisite safety education and training to 
enhance safety knowledge, skills, and abilities that enhance aerospace power by eliminating 
mishaps through proactive hazard identification and risk management. The education and training 
encompass all safety disciplines: aviation, occupational, weapons, space and missiles; ensuring 
mission-ready capabilities are preserved for the Air and Space Forces and is delivered to 
approximately 2,000 students through 11 professional courses in 70 sessions, ranging from three 
days to seven weeks. The program ensures current and future mishap prevention requirements 
and opportunities are addressed by providing interactive education and training through on-site 
classroom course offerings, web-based course offerings, and distance learning courses. The 
division chief also serves as the safety civilian career field manager, establishing policy and 
serving as the day-to-day advocate for issues and concerns.  
Personnel and Resource Division. The Personnel and Resource Division is responsible for 
complex managerial services for the center including all personnel, manpower, program 
management, knowledge operations, and facilities management, as well as planning, 
programming, budget, and execution. The Personnel and Resource Division provides support to 
the Chief of Safety and the entire Air Force Safety Center. It is the backbone for mission and 
infrastructure support to ensure continuity and efficiency across the enterprise.  
Office of the Staff Judge Advocate. The Office of the Staff Judge Advocate provides legal 
advice and general counsel on all aspects of Air and Space Forces mishap prevention programs 
and safety investigations. The office ensures proper controls are maintained on safety reports and 
privileged information. It also provides effective coordination on legal and safety issues with the 
DoD, other federal agencies, and international safety programs. The office maintains the Air 
Force Safety Center records library, ensuring efficient and timely retrieval of safety investigation 
reports for review and analysis. In addition, it responds to requests for safety information under 
the Freedom of Information Act, congressional requests, and other functional requests.

17.18. Risk Management Decision-Making Process 
Risk management is a decision-making process designed to systematically evaluate possible 
courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action for any given 
situation. Risk management enables commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and 
individuals to maximize capabilities while limiting risks through a simple, systematic process for 
all personnel and functions in both on- and off-duty situations. Appropriate use of risk 
management increases an organization’s and individual’s ability to safely and effectively 
accomplish their mission while preserving lives and resources.  
Safety Training. One of the greatest influences of successful mission accomplishment, and a key 
aspect of risk management, is a highly trained workforce that recognizes the importance of safety 
precautions and procedures and adheres to standards incorporating the basic elements of risk 
management. Safety training may be integrated into task performance training or conducted 
separately.  
Job Safety Analysis. A job safety analysis is used to evaluate each work task not governed by a 
technical order or other definitive guidance and when a new work task or process is introduced 
into the workplace. Supervisors are responsible for training, establishing work methods and job 
instructions, assigning jobs, and supervising personnel. Before any operation begins and any 
safety training can take place, supervisors must determine where people may be injured, or 
equipment may be damaged. They are in the best position to identify hazards, assess risks 
associated with those hazards, and correct unsafe work practices or safety deficiencies that would 
impede mission success.  
17.19. Risk Management Principles 
Four principles govern all actions associated with risk management. These principles are the 
cornerstones of effective risk management and are applicable 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, 365- 
days a year by all personnel, for all on- and off-duty activities.  
Accept No Unnecessary Risk. All DAF missions and daily routines involve risk. However, 
unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate return in terms of real benefits or available 
opportunities. The most logical choices or actions are those that meet all mission requirements 
while exposing personnel and resources to the lowest acceptable risk possible. With this in mind, 
we cannot and should not be completely risk averse. Even high risk endeavors may be undertaken 
when there is a well-founded basis to believe that the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of the 
costs. Balancing benefits and costs are a subjective process and tied intimately with the factors 
affecting the mission or activity. Personnel with prior knowledge and experience of a mission or 
activity must be engaged whenever possible in making risk decisions to ensure a proper balance 
is achieved.  
Make Risk Decisions at the Appropriate Level. Although anyone can make a risk decision that 
impacts their personal well-being, some risk acceptance decisions must be made by an appropriate 
decision-making authority to effectively allocate resources and implement controls to mitigate or 
eliminate risks associated with an activity. Making risk decisions at the appropriate level also 
establishes clear accountability. Leaders and individuals must be aware of how much risk they 
can accept and when to elevate risk management decisions to a higher level. Those accountable 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
337 
 
 
 
for the success or failure of a mission or activity must be fully engaged in the risk decision process.  
Integrate Risk Management into Operations and Planning at All Levels. Integrate risk 
management into planning at all levels and as early as possible. This provides the greatest 
opportunity to make informed risk decisions and implement effective risk controls. To effectively 
apply risk management, commanders, supervisors, and personnel must dedicate time and 
resources to integrate risk management principles into planning, operational processes, and day-
to-day activities. Risk assessments of operations and activities are most successful when 
incorporated deliberately in the normal sequence of events (the pre-planning of a mission or 
activity) by individuals directly involved in the event, and not as a last minute or add-on process. 
Risk management planning, even in a time-constrained environment, is better than no planning at 
all.  
Apply the Risk Management Process Cyclically and Continuously. Risk management is a 
continuous process applied across the full spectrum of military training and operations, base 
operations functions, and day-to-day activities and events both on- and off-duty. This cyclic 
process is used to continuously identify and assess hazards, develop, and implement controls, 
evaluate outcomes, and provide feedback to our Airmen and Guardians to save lives and preserve 
combat resources.  
17.20. Risk Management Levels 
The principles, goals, and fundamental concepts of risk management highlight the universal 
application of risk management both on- and off-duty. There are two primary levels of risk 
management: deliberate and real-time. Deliberate and real-time risk management are interrelated 
when making risk management decisions. They are separated only at the point where planning 
transitions to execution of the mission or activity. A strong, effective risk management process 
involves careful deliberative planning coupled with effective real-time risk management. This 
dual approach ensures comprehensive risk mitigation and the likelihood of mission or activity 
success.  
Deliberate Risk Management. Deliberate risk management may involve the full, formal 
application of the complete five-step risk management process, ranging from thorough hazard 
identification, detailed data research, diagram and analysis tools, formal testing, and long-term 
tracking of the risks associated with an operation, activity, or system. Deliberate risk management 
may simply involve normal day-to-day operations or activity planning that utilize the same five- 
step risk management process but require less time and resources to complete.  
In-Depth Risk Management Planning. Another aspect of deliberate risk management that is 
generally associated with strategic-level planning is referred to as in-depth risk management 
planning. It is reserved for complex operations and systems, as well as high priority and high 
visibility situations or circumstances in which hazards are not well understood or easily 
predictable. In-depth risk management is normally implemented well in advance of a planned 
system, mission, event, or activity, and is normally reserved for more complex and risky efforts, 
such as large troop movements, airshow planning, or tactics and training curricula development.  
17.21. Five-Step Risk Management Process 
Risk management is a continuous, systematic decision process consisting of five steps primarily 
associated with deliberate risk management planning that forms the basis for real-time risk 
management process considerations. The following is a brief description of the Five-Step Risk 
Management Process and is illustrated in Figure 17.1.:  
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
338 
 
 
 
Step 1. Identify the Hazards. Step 1 of the 
Five-Step Risk Management Process is to 
identify the hazards. Identifying the hazards 
involves application of appropriate hazard 
identification techniques to identify hazards 
associated with the operation or activity. 
Hazards can be defined as any real or potential 
condition that can cause mission degradation, 
injury, illness, death to personnel, or damage to 
or loss of equipment or property. Implementing 
Step 1 includes (1) reviewing current and 
planned operations and tasks associated with the 
mission or activity, (2) identifying and listing 
hazards and factors that may lead to dangers and 
risks associated with the operation or activity, 
and (3) listing the causes associated with each 
identified hazard and trying to identify the root 
cause against which to apply risk management strategies.  
Step 2. Assess the Hazards. Step 2 of the Five-Step Risk Management Process is to assess the 
hazards. Assessing the hazards involves the application of quantitative or qualitative measures to 
determine the probability and severity of negative effects that may result from exposure to risks 
or hazards and directly affect mission or activity success. Implementing Step 2 includes: (1) 
evaluating the time, proximity, volume, or repetition involved to determine the level of exposure 
to hazards; (2) determining severity of the hazard in terms of potential impact on personnel, 
equipment, or mission/activity; (3) determining the probability that the hazard will cause a 
negative event of the severity assessed above (probability may be determined through estimates 
or actual numbers); and (4) determining the level of risk associated with the hazard as related to 
severity and probability.  
Associated with Step 2 of the Five-Step Risk Management Process is a risk assessment matrix 
that can be used to form a risk assessment for each hazard by combining the probability of 
occurrence with severity. Risk levels will vary from “extremely high” as associated with frequent 
exposure and catastrophic effects to “low” as associated with unlikely exposure and negligible 
effects. A complete and in-depth description of the risk assessment matrix can be found in 
DAFPAM 90-803, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools.  
Step 3. Develop Controls and Make Decisions. Step 3 of the Five-Step Risk Management 
Process is to develop controls and make decisions. This step involves the development and 
selection of specific strategies and controls that reduce or eliminate risk. Effective mitigation 
measures reduce one of the three components (probability, severity, or exposure) of risk. There is 
no “cookie-cutter” approach or specific standard for establishing levels of risk management 
decision authority across the DAF. The higher the risk, the higher the decision level needs to be 
to ensure an appropriate analysis of overall costs to benefits has been carefully weighed. It is 
critical that leaders and decision-makers ensure the levels of decision authority are aligned 
appropriately for mission requirements and experience levels of the personnel conducting 
operations/activities under their responsibility.  
Implementing Step 3 includes: (1) starting with the highest-risk hazards as assessed in Step 2, and 
identifying as many risk control options for each hazard as possible that can effectively eliminate, 
avoid, or reduce the risk to an acceptable level; (2) determining the effect of each control on the 
Figure 17.1. 5-Step Risk Management Process 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
339 
 
 
 
risk(s) associated with the hazard; (3) prioritizing risk controls for each hazard that will reduce 
the risk to an acceptable level within mission objectives, and optimize use of available resources 
(manpower, materiel, equipment, funding, and time); (4) selecting those risk controls that will 
reduce the risk to an acceptable level consistent with mission or activity objectives and optimum 
use of available resources; and (5) analyzing the level of risk for the operation or activity with the 
proposed controls in place, and determining if the benefits now exceed the level of risk the 
operation or activity presents.   
Step 4. Implement Controls. Step 4 of the Five-Step Risk Management Process is to implement 
controls. Once control measures have been selected, an implementation strategy must be 
developed and carried out. The strategy must identify who, what, when, where, and how much 
cost is associated with the control measure. For mission-related controls, accountability must be 
emphasized across all levels of leadership and personnel associated with the action so there is a 
clear understanding of the risks and responsibilities of commanders and subordinates alike. There 
must always be accountability for acceptance of risk regardless of circumstances. Implementing 
Step 4 includes: (1) providing a roadmap for implementation, a vision of the end state, and a 
description of successful implementation; (2) establishing accountability for making the decision 
and determining who is responsible at the unit or execution level for implementation of the risk 
control; and (3) providing the personnel and resources necessary to implement the control 
measures. Incorporate sustainability from the beginning and be sure to deploy the control measure 
along with a feedback mechanism that will provide information on whether the control measure 
is achieving the intended purpose.  
Step 5. Supervise and Evaluate. Step 5 of the Five-Step Risk Management Process is to 
supervise and evaluate. Leaders and supervisors at every level must fulfill their respective roles 
to ensure controls are sustained over time. Implementing Step 5 includes: (1) supervising and 
monitoring the operation or activity, and (2) reviewing and evaluating to ensure risk and cost are 
in balance. Significant changes in the system are recognized and appropriate risk management 
controls are reapplied, as necessary, to control the risks. Effective review and evaluation will also 
identify whether actual costs are in line with expectations and how the controls have affected 
mission performance (good or bad). Note: When risk analysis contains errors, it is important for 
those errors to be identified and corrected. Also, after-action reports, surveys, and in-progress 
reviews are excellent tools for measurements. A feedback system must be established to ensure 
that the corrective or preventative action taken was effective and that any newly discovered 
hazards identified are analyzed and subsequent corrective action taken.  
17.22. Real-Time RM 
Real-Time Risk Management is a less formal risk assessment using basic RM process steps to 
identify and mitigate hazards in a new or changing situation. Although Real-Time Risk 
Management is founded on the 5-Step RM Process, streamlining the steps is essential in situations 
where risk decisions need to be made quickly and in Real-Time.  
Identifying and Assessing Hazards. Identifying and assessing hazards in a time-critical 
environment typically occurs when a planned activity is already underway or when the complexity 
or perception of overall risk is low. Effective identification and assessment requires the key 
elements of hazard and risk identification and understanding the negative effects associated with 
those hazards and risks. It is essential for individuals to seriously consider the activity or action 
in which they are about to engage and choose appropriate mitigation strategies to address the 
hazards they identify. In Real-Time Risk Management, a complete assessment of the situation 
requires three stages of situational awareness in a relatively short time: (a) Perception of what is 
happening, (b) Integration of information and goals, and (c) Projection into the future. Unlike 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
340 
 
 
 
Deliberate RM, where there is ample time to assess potential situations, it is an individual’s ability 
to discern the situation and apply available resources quickly and effectively that can mean the 
difference between success or failure.  
Developing Controls. After assessing the situation, personnel must consider all available controls 
(resources) to facilitate mission or activity success and how to manage them effectively. Controls 
and resources can vary in scope and availability from situation to situation. The better prepared 
individuals are prior to an activity, the more likely they will have more controls and resources 
available to create multiple redundancies or “blocks” to effectively eliminate or mitigate potential 
risks in real-time. Examples include having a good understanding of the situation, being properly 
trained, wearing correct personal protective equipment, knowing personal limitations, and having 
a “Wingman” to support their effort(s). Each of these controls and resources serves as a layer of 
protection and enhances a decision maker’s ability to effectively balance risk versus reward 
through proper preparation and understanding of the situation and options. When making these 
considerations it is also essential that Airmen and Guardians communicate with their team and 
leadership to ensure all options and resources are effectively utilized in making a sound yet timely 
risk decision.  
Communicating. Communication can take various forms such as real-time communication with 
leadership to discuss problems and intentions, internal team and crew communication can address 
real-time hazards and mitigation options, or an individual internalizing their current situation and 
taking time to evaluate if they are heading down the right path. This action assumes individuals 
or teams carefully consider options and controls available to them in real-time situations. They 
should be aware of how perception and communication skills change in unanticipated and 
changing environments.  
Perception and communication skills are adversely affected as individuals become increasingly 
stressed and lose situational awareness. Feeling undue pressure to succeed or to continue with a 
plan when anticipated conditions require “mid-stream” changes can have similar effects on 
individuals or team members as they try to compensate. In these high stress situations, 
communication skills diminish as individuals channelize attention and lose awareness of the 
overall situation. They can experience tunnel vision and be unable to multitask effectively to deal 
with the changing circumstances.  
Understanding this, individuals and teams thrust into these situations can better prepare, 
anticipate, and identify if they or others are losing situational awareness and make corrections. 
This awareness enables individuals to more effectively communicate with teammates and 
leadership in Real-Time situations. It allows them to take a step back and reevaluate options.  
Asking questions such as: “Who needs to know about the situation?” “Who can help or assist?” 
“Who can provide back-up?” or “Can this be done differently” are just a few examples of the 
considerations that must be made prior to implementing a mitigation strategy in Real-Time.  
Making Decisions. Unlike the deliberative RM level where an implementation strategy is 
carefully developed and carried out through identification of the who, what, when, where and cost 
associated with the control prior to an activity, Real-Time Risk Management relies on the 
individual or small group taking immediate or near immediate action to mitigate risk(s) in Real- 
Time. This aspect alone can make Real-Time Risk Management decisions riskier than deliberate 
RM decisions. Individuals must realize this and make every effort to deliberately weigh risk 
decisions before taking action to ensure they are selecting the best course of action.  
Implementing Controls. Sometimes the original plan must be modified or changed to account 
for unforeseen issues in order to assure success. Although minor changes or modifications to a 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
341 
 
 
 
plan or strategy may be easily implemented, others may require higher authority (if available) to 
properly weigh the risk and determine the best course of action. Accountability under these 
circumstances rests solely with the individual(s) involved in the activity. It is their responsibility 
to fully understand the scope and limits of their Go/No-Go decision and act accordingly.  
As such, the acceptance of risk and associated consequences needs to be taken seriously with the 
understanding that any adverse outcome from a selected course of action may not only affect the 
individual, but greatly impact family, friends, coworkers, and the individual’s ability to contribute 
to the DAF mission.  
The goal for any mission or activity is to operate safely and achieve success. However, all Airmen 
and Guardians must consider the possibility of abandoning the mission or activity if the situation 
appears too risky or too costly to continue. Particularly when there are no reasonable options or 
strategies to change or alter the circumstances in the time remaining to conduct the mission or 
activity.  
Supervising and Evaluating. It is essential that both leadership and personnel involved in a 
mission or activity ensure that the feedback loop or “Evaluate” aspect of the RM process is 
performed. This vital process step ensures individuals follow through and complete the 5-Step 
process by identifying what worked, what did not work, and ensures documented lessons learned 
are disseminated. Debriefs will improve performance, mitigate risks in future activities, and are 
essential in completing the RM 5-Step process. Asking questions such as: “Was our assessment 
accurate?” “Were we lucky?” “How well did we use the controls and resources?” “Was the 
communication effective?” and “What can we do to improve the events in the future?” are a few 
examples of questions that leaders, crews and teams, and individuals can ask in debriefs to ensure 
future activities are improved and risks are reduced.  
Knock-it-off and Timeout Concepts. Integral to Real-Time Risk Management are the concepts 
of "Knock-it-off" and "Timeout" during an ongoing operation or activity. These concepts are 
essential to ensuring that all personnel have a voice in any situation to identify concerns or to 
inform others of a developing hazardous situation. Verbalizing either of these terms sends a 
message to those involved in a specific action to stop, take a moment to reset, and reevaluate the 
current situation. The terms should be integrated as an essential part of all on- and off-duty 
operations and activities. Key aspects of these two terms include:  
All Airmen and Guardians (regardless of rank or position) are empowered to use these terms 
without any fear of repercussions.  
When either term is used, all current actions are immediately halted, and the situation is stabilized 
to a safe position in order to evaluate what the specific concern is; this is nonnegotiable and cannot 
be overridden by command authority.  
After the Knock-it-off or Timeout call, a clear determination is made whether the current action 
may be continued safely, requires change, or must be terminated based upon the perceived 
concern(s) or hazard(s).  
The alerts provided by the use of those terms do not prevent actions from continuing, once safety 
and risk concerns are addressed, but provide all personnel with an avenue to effectively mitigate 
risk through immediate intervention in any evolving operation or activity.

18.1.  Maintain the Advantage 
The purpose of security is to never permit the enemy to acquire an unexpected advantage. The 
lethal consequences of enemy attack make the security of friendly forces a paramount concern. 
Security applies to all members of the USAF at all times, such is the multiplicity of security with 
regard to the USAF mission and the protection of all resources. Integrated defense does not stand 
alone to protect personnel and resources; planners create an effective security program by 
coordinating with other Department of Defense and Department of the USAF programs. 
Furthermore, the protection and defense of air bases requires the coordinated effort of emergency 
management, antiterrorism, and other mission support function forces under the mission assurance 
umbrella. This coordinated planning provides a seamless progression of mission assurance 
programs and completes the installation’s defense in-depth picture. 
18.2. Integrated Defense Program 
The 
USAF 
Integrated 
Defense 
Program 
is 
the 
integration 
of 
multidisciplinary active and passive, 
offensive, and defensive capabilities, 
employed to mitigate potential risks 
and defeat adversary threats to USAF 
operations. The goal of integrated 
defense is to neutralize security 
threats within the base boundary and 
the base security zone to ensure 
unhindered USAF operations. Threat 
actors include, but are not limited to 
terrorists, insiders, criminals, foreign 
intelligence, and security services. 
Potential hazards to an installation 
include, but are not limited to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear-high yield explosive 
attacks; natural and man-made disasters; major accidents; and accidental or deliberate release of 
hazardous materials, toxic industrial materials, or chemicals. Integrated defense is an “All 
Airmen” program. The teaming of integrated defense forces creates a united, seamless defense, 
stronger than the defensive efforts of individuals or individual units. This effort ensures all Airmen 
are trained to defend themselves and integrate into defense operations while in garrison or 
deployed. For additional information on integrated defense, refer to AFPD 31-1, Integrated 
Defense. 
Base Perimeter. The physical boundary of the installation. 
Base Boundary. JP 3-10, Joint Security Operations in Theater, defines the base boundary as a 
line that delineates the surface area of a base for the purpose of facilitating coordination and 
deconfliction of operations between adjacent units, formations, or areas. The base boundary should 
Figure 18.1. Base Boundary Configuration 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
343 
 
 
 
be established with consideration for mission, enemy, terrain and weather, time, troops available, 
and civil considerations (METT-TC), specifically balancing the need of the integrated defense 
forces to control key terrain with the ability to accomplish the mission. Boundaries may not 
necessarily coincide with the fenced perimeter, property lines, or legal boundaries. 
Base Security Zone. The base security zone is a USAF unique concept and term to be used intra- 
service only. The USAF uses the planning term base security zone to describe the area of concern 
around an air base and to support the establishment and adjustment of the base boundary. The base 
security zone is the area outside the base perimeter from which the base may be vulnerable from 
standoff weapons (mortars, rockets, and man portable air defense systems) and waterborne threats. 
The installation commander should identify and arrange to have the base security zone recognized 
as the base boundary. If the base boundary does not include all of the terrain of the base security 
zone, the installation commander is responsible for either mitigating (through coordination with 
local, state, federal agencies, or the host nation or area commander) or accepting the risks of enemy 
attack from the terrain outside the base boundary. Figure 18.1. is provided to show an example of 
a base perimeter, base boundary, and base security zone configuration. 
18.3. Integrated Defense Effects 
Commanders execute integrated defense with the objective of achieving nine desired effects based 
on the risk management process. Those effects are briefly described here. 
Anticipate. Anticipate threat intentions and actions (intelligence preparation of the operational 
environment or crime trend analysis). 
Deter. Deter threat activity through active community policing, boundary and internal circulation 
control, controlled area marking, and prudent physical security measures. 
Detect. Detect threats through the use of lighting, intrusion detection systems/early warning 
systems, and closed-circuit television, etc. 
Assess. Assess to identify friend or foe using cameras, posted sentries, response forces, and 
intrusion detection systems, etc. 
Warn. Warn friendly forces of adversary activity through systems, such as mass notification, 
radio, public address, commander’s access channels, voice, hand and arm signals, and cellular 
telephones, and instant messenger/short message system texting. 
Defeat. Defeat threats through appropriate, progressive force application, coordinated security 
force response, and integration of forces. 
Delay. Delay adversaries using a layered application of barriers, obstacles, technology, physical 
security measures, and forces. Another way to say this is to apply defense-in-depth procedures. 
Defend. Defend assets through threat- and effects-based planning that integrates all friendly forces 
into a single, comprehensive plan by ensuring friendly forces are trained and qualified on arming 
and use of force. Also, ensure the fighting positions are established where prudent, based on risk 
analyses. 
Recover. Recover from adversarial events by applying effective command and control, and 
developing and exercising Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan 10-2. 
Application of Integrated Defense Desired Effects. Integrated defense desired effects are not 
randomly applied to an installation; they are deliberately achieved through innovative and reliable 
tactics, techniques, and procedures based on integrated defense risk management process and 
analysis. As an example, systematic application of integrated defense to achieve desired effects 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
344 
 
 
 
could involve a situation when it would be preferred to deter a threat; but if that does not succeed, 
the next ideal effect would be to detect the threat. Once the threat is detected, assessment by forces 
occurs. Friendly forces are then warned of the threat and attempts are made to defeat or eliminate 
the threat. If the threat cannot be defeated, it must be delayed. If delay is not possible, defensive 
measures must be taken to mitigate the effects of the threat. Recovery actions are then implemented 
to consolidate and reorganize friendly forces and restore operations. 
18.4. Base Defense Operations Center 
The base defense operations center is the command and control center for integrated defense 
operations during routine and emergency operations. The defense force commander will establish 
a base defense operations center to coordinate and direct, via the operational chain of command, 
the tactical control of integrated defense forces and supporting capabilities. Central security 
control, the law enforcement desk, and other security forces control centers will operate under 
control of the base defense operations center at all locations, to include operations at home station 
and deployed. 
18.5. Integrated Defense Risk Management Process 
The integrated defense risk management process provides installation commanders, integrated 
defense working groups, defense force commanders, and defense planners, the ability to produce 
effects-based, integrated defense plans by using a standardized model to identify risks and develop 
risk management strategies. These strategies leverage finite resources against adaptive threats to 
protect USAF resources and personnel. The integrated defense risk management process identifies 
at-risk assets and aids the integrated defense working groups in generating the criticality 
assessment and the risk assessment products. A risk reduction decision based on a clear 
understanding of what is important, the estimated threat, and how the asset might be damaged or 
destroyed, is then developed through a logical process involving asset criticality, threat, and 
vulnerability assessments. 
18.6. Security Protection Levels 
Protection Level 1. Protection level 1 (PL1) is assigned to those resources for which the loss, 
theft, destruction, damage, misuse, or compromise would result in unacceptable mission 
degradation to the strategic capability of the United States or catastrophic consequences for the 
nation. PL1 security must result in the greatest possible deterrence against hostile acts. This level 
of security will provide maximum means to detect and defeat a hostile force before it is able to 
seize, damage, or destroy resources. PL 1 examples include nuclear weapons in storage mated to 
a delivery system or in transit; designated command, control, and communications facilities; and 
aircraft designated to transport the U.S. President. 
Protection Level 2. Protection level 2 (PL2) is assigned to resources for which the loss, theft, 
destruction, damage, misuse, or compromise would result in significant mission degradation to the 
war fighting capability of the United States. PL2 security must result in significant deterrence 
against hostile acts. This level of security will ensure a significant probability of detecting and 
defeating a hostile force before it is able to seize, damage, or destroy resources. PL 2 examples 
include nonnuclear alert forces; designated space and launch systems; expensive, few in number, 
or one-of-a-kind systems or facilities; and intelligence-gathering systems. 
Protection Level 3. Protection level 3 (PL3) is assigned to resources for which the loss, theft, 
destruction, damage, misuse, or compromise would result in mission degradation to the United 
States warfighting capability. PL3 security must result in a reasonable degree of deterrence against 
hostile acts. This level of security ensures the capability to impede a hostile force and limit damage 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
345 
 
 
 
to resources. PL 3 examples include non-alert resources that can be generated to alert status; 
selected command, control, and communications facilities, systems, and equipment; and non- 
launch-critical or non-unique space launch systems. 
Protection Level 4. Protection level 4 (PL4) is assigned to operational or mission support 
resources that directly or indirectly support power projection assets and the war fighting mission 
for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would adversely affect mission 
capability. PL4 resources are secured by containing them in controlled areas with owners or users 
being responsible for security. Security forces provide response to threats. This level of security 
must reduce the opportunity for theft of or damage to resources. PL 4 examples include facilities 
storing Category I, II, or III sensitive conventional arms, ammunition, and explosives; fuels and 
liquid oxygen storage areas; and USAF accounting and finance vault areas.

18.7. USAF Operations Security Program 
The purpose of operations security is to reduce the vulnerability of USAF missions by eliminating 
or reducing successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. Operations 
security uses a cycle to identify, analyze, and control critical information that applies to all 
activities used to prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of operations. USAF 
personnel can be under observation at their peacetime bases and locations, in training or exercises, 
while moving, or when deployed and conducting combat operations. USAF units utilize a profiling 
process to identify vulnerabilities and indicators of their day-to-day activities. With this 
understanding, operations security program managers and signature managers use the signature 
management methodology to apply measures or countermeasures to hide, control, or simulate 
indicators. Operations security signature managers also recommend modifying the day-to-day 
activities at an installation or organization to create variations in the status quo. Operations 
security involves attentiveness to: 
Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems. 
Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and interpreted to derive 
critical information in time to be useful to adversaries. 
Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities 
of friendly actions to adversary exploitation. 
Operational Effectiveness. Operations security involves a series of analyses to examine the 
planning, preparation, execution, and post-execution phases of any operation or activity across the 
entire spectrum of military action and in any operational environment. Operations security analysis 
provides decision-makers with a means of weighing the risk to their operations. Decision-makers 
must determine the amount of risk they are willing to accept in particular operational circumstances 
in the same way as operational risk management allows commanders to assess risk in mission 
planning. Operational effectiveness is enhanced when commanders and other decision-makers 
apply operations security from the earliest stages of planning. 
Operations Security Principles. Operations security principles must be integrated into 
operational, support, exercise, acquisition planning, and day-to-day activities to ensure a seamless 
transition to contingency operations. The operations security cycle consists of the following 
distinct actions: 
Identify critical information. 
Analyze threats. 
Analyze vulnerabilities. 
Assess risk. 
Apply appropriate operations security countermeasures. 
18.8. Operations Security Indicators 
Operations security indicators are friendly, detectable actions and open-source information that 
can be interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information. The five basic 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
347 
 
 
 
characteristics of operations security indicators that make them potentially valuable to an 
adversary are briefly described here. 
Signatures. Signatures are observable activities and operational trends that reveal critical 
information to adversary intelligence collection. Signature management is a systematic approach 
to identify, prioritize, and manage physical, technical, and administrative indicators of friendly 
forces’ operational profiles that, if ignored, will be exploited by an adversary to achieve an 
operational advantage over friendly force objectives. Defense of operational profiles is 
accomplished by implementing measures to deny adversary collection of critical information. 
Associations. An association is the relationship of an indicator to other information or activities. 
The characteristics of the relationship make it identifiable or causes it to stand out. 
Profiles. Each functional activity generates its own set of more-or-less unique signatures and 
associations. The sum of these signatures and associations is the activity’s profile. A profiling 
process is used to map the local operating environment and capture process points that present key 
signatures and profiles with critical information value. 
Contrasts. A contrast is any difference observed between an activity’s standard profile and most 
recent or current actions. 
Exposure. Exposure refers to when and for how long an indicator is observed. The longer an 
indicator is observed, the better chance an adversary can form associations and update the profile 
of operational activities.

18.9. Information Protection Procedures 
Information protection is a subset of the USAF security enterprise and consists of the core security 
disciplines (personnel, industrial, and information security) used to determine military, civilian, 
and contractor personnel eligibility to access classified information, ensure the protection of 
classified information released or disclosed to industry in connection with classified contracts, and 
protect classified information and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) that, if subject to 
unauthorized disclosure, could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security. 
18.10. Information Security 
All personnel in the USAF are responsible for protecting classified information and CUI under 
their custody and control. DoDM5200.01V1_DAFMAN16-1404V1, Information Security 
Program: Overview, Classification, and Declassification, provide the guidance for managing 
classified information and CUI. 
Classified Information. Classified information is designated accordingly to protect national 
security. There are three levels of classification: Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential. Each 
individual is responsible for providing the proper safeguards for classified information, reporting 
security incidents, and understanding the sanctions for noncompliance. 
Top Secret. Top Secret shall be applied to information that the unauthorized disclosure of which 
reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the 
original classification authority is able to identify or describe. 
Secret. Secret shall be applied to information that the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably 
could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification 
authority is able to identify or describe. 
Confidential. Confidential shall be applied to information that the unauthorized disclosure of 
which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original 
classification authority is able to identify or describe. 
18.11. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). 
CUI is information the government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for 
or on behalf of the government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or 
permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls. Requirements, controls, 
and protective measures developed for these materials are found in DoDI 5200.48_AFI 16-1403, 
Controlled Unclassified Information. 
Original Classification. Original classification is the initial decision by an original classification 
authority that an item of information could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or 
describable damage to the national security subjected to unauthorized disclosure and requires 
protection in the interest of national security. Only officials designated in writing may make 
original classification decisions. 
Derivative Classification. USAF policy is to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, and 
protect classified information and records, and to destroy classified records containing classified 
information, consistent with national policy. CUI will also be protected per national policy. Within 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
349 
 
 
 
the Department of Defense all cleared personnel are authorized to derivatively classify 
information, if: 1) they have received initial training before making derivative classification 
decisions, and 2) they have receiver refresher training every year. Derivative classification is the 
incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating classified information in a new form or 
document. Derivative classifiers must use authorized types of sources for making decisions. One 
of the most important responsibilities of the derivative classifier is to observe and respect the 
classification determinations made by an original classification authority. 
Marking Classified Information. All classified information shall be clearly identified by 
marking, designation, or electronic labelling in accordance with DoDM5200.01V2_AFMAN16- 
1404V2, Information Security Program: Marking of Classified Information. Marking classified 
information serves to: alert holders to the presence of classified information; identify the 
information needing protection; indicate the level of classification assigned to the information; 
provide guidance on downgrading (if any) and declassification; give information on the sources 
of and reasons for classification; notify holders of special access, control, or safeguarding 
requirements; and promote information sharing, facilitate judicious use of resources, and simplify 
management through implementation of uniform and standardized processes. 
Specific Markings on Documents. Every classified document must be marked to show the 
highest classification of information contained within the document. The marking must be 
conspicuous enough to alert anyone handling the document that the document is classified. Every 
document will contain the overall classification of the document, banner lines, portion markings 
indicating the classification level of specific classified information within the document, the 
classification authority block, date of origin, and downgrading instructions, if any, and 
declassification instructions. The three most common markings on a classified document are the 
banner lines, portion markings, and the classification authority block. Refer to 
DoDM5200.01V2_DAFMAN16-1404V2, for additional information and marking illustrations. 
Safeguarding Classified Information. Everyone who works with classified information is 
personally responsible for taking proper precautions to ensure unauthorized persons do not gain 
access to classified information. Before granting access to classified information, the person must 
have: (1) security clearance eligibility, (2) a signed Standard Form (SF) 312, Classified 
Information Non-Disclosure Agreement, and (3) a need-to-know. The individual with authorized 
possession, knowledge, or control of the information must determine whether the person receiving 
the information has been granted the appropriate security clearance access by proper authority. An 
authorized person shall keep classified material removed from storage under constant surveillance. 
The authorized person must place coversheets on classified documents not in secure storage to 
prevent unauthorized persons from viewing the information. The following forms will be used to 
cover classified information outside of storage: SF 703, Top Secret (Cover Sheet), SF 704, Secret 
(Cover Sheet), and SF 705, Confidential (Cover Sheet). 
End-of-Day Security Checks. Use SF 701, Activity Security Checklist, to record the end of the 
day security checks. This form is required for any area where classified information is used or 
stored. Ensure all vaults, secure rooms, and containers used for storing classified material are 
checked. Classified information systems should specifically be stored in a general services 
administration approved safe or in buildings or areas cleared for open storage of classified. 
18.12. Security Incidents Involving Classified Information 
Anyone finding classified material out of proper control must take custody of and safeguard the 
material and immediately notify their commander, supervisor, or security manager. The terms 
associated with security incidents are formally defined in DoDM5200.01V3_DAFMAN16-
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
350 
 
 
 
1404V3, DoD Information Security Program: Protection of Classified Information. The general 
security incident characteristics are briefly described here. 
Infraction. An infraction is a security incident involving failure to comply with requirements (i.e., 
the provisions of References (d) and (f), this Manual or other applicable security policy) which 
cannot reasonably be expected to, and does not, result in the loss, of classified records, or in the 
suspected or actual compromise of classified information. An infraction may be unintentional or 
inadvertent. While it does not constitute a security violation, if left uncorrected, can lead to security 
violations or compromises. It requires an inquiry to facilitate immediate corrective action but does 
not require an in-depth investigation. 
Violation. Violations are security incidents that indicate knowing, willful, and negligent for 
security regulations, and result in, or could be expected to result in the loss of classified records or 
the compromise of classified information. Security violations require an inquiry and/or 
investigation 
Compromise. A compromise is a security incident (more specifically, a violation) in which there 
is an unauthorized disclosure of classified information (i.e., disclosure to a person(s) who does not 
have a valid clearance, authorized access, or a need to know). 
Loss. A loss occurs when records containing classified information cannot be physically located 
or accounted for. This could include classified records/equipment is discovered missing during an 
audit and which cannot be immediately located. 
Data Spills. Classified data spills occur when classified data is introduced either onto an 
unclassified information system or to an information system with a lower level of classification, 
or to a system not accredited to process data of that restrictive category. Although it is possible 
that no unauthorized disclosure occurred, classified data spills are considered and handled as a 
possible compromise of classified information involving information systems, networks, and 
computer equipment until the inquiry determines whether an unauthorized disclosure did or did 
not occur. 
Information in the Public Media. If classified information appears in the public media, including 
on public Internet sites, or if approached by a representative of the media, DoD personnel shall be 
careful not to make any statement or comment that confirms the accuracy of or verifies the 
information requiring protection. Report the matter as instructed by the appropriate DoD 
Component guidance, but do not discuss it with anyone who does not, in the case of classified 
information, have an appropriate security clearance and need to know. 
18.13. Industrial Security 
USAF policy is to identify, in classified contracts, specific information and sensitive resources that 
must be protected against compromise or loss while entrusted to industry. Security policies, 
requirements, and procedures are applicable to USAF personnel and on-base Department of 
Defense contractors performing services under the terms of a properly executed contract and 
associated security agreement or similar document, as determined by the installation commander. 
18.14. Personnel Security 
The Personnel Security Program entails policies and procedures that ensure military, civilian, and 
contractor personnel who access classified information or occupy a sensitive position are 
consistent with interests of national security. For most personnel, this involves procedures for 
obtaining proper security clearances required for performing official duties. It involves the 
investigation process, adjudication (approval) for eligibility, and the continuous evaluation for 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
351 
 
 
 
maintaining eligibility. Commanders and supervisors must continually observe and evaluate their 
subordinates with respect to these criteria and immediately report any unfavorable conduct or 
conditions that might bear on the subordinates’ trustworthiness and eligibility to occupy a sensitive 
position or have eligibility to classified information. 
Adjudicative Guidelines. The Department of Defense Central Adjudication Facility is the 
designated authority to grant, deny, and revoke security clearance eligibility using the Department 
of Defense 13 adjudicative guidelines, while applying the whole person concept and mitigating 
factors. Individuals are granted due process and may appeal if the security clearance eligibility is 
denied or revoked. For additional details, refer to the DoDM 5200.02_AFMAN 16-1405, Air Force 
Personnel Security Program. The 13 Adjudicative Guidelines include: 
 
Allegiance to the United States 
Foreign Influence 
Foreign Preference 
Sexual Behavior 
Personal Conduct 
Financial Considerations 
Alcohol Consumption 
Drug Involvement 
Psychological Conditions 
Criminal Conduct 
Handling Protected Information 
 
 
   Allegiance to the United States – An individual must be of unquestioned allegiance to the 
United States. The willingness to safeguard classified information is in doubt if there is any 
reason to suspect an individual's allegiance to the United States. 
   Foreign Influence – Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual 
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a 
foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is 
vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  
   Foreign Preference – When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a 
foreign country over the United States, then be or she may be prone to provide information or 
make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. 
   Sexual Behavior – Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or 
emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the individual 
to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference 
concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual 
orientation of the individual. 
   Personal Conduct – Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. 
   Financial Considerations – Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and 
meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to 
abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
352 
 
 
 
gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that 
cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. 
   Alcohol Consumption – Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of 
questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about an 
individual's reliability and trustworthiness. 
   Drug Involvement – Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and 
because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, 
and regulations. 
   Psychological Conditions – Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required for 
there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health professional (e.g., 
clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. 
Government, should be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating 
information under this guideline. No negative inference concerning the standards in this 
Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of seeking mental health counseling. 
   Criminal Conduct – Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to 
comply with laws, rules and regulations 
   Handling Protected Information – Deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and 
regulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an 
individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such 
information, and is a serious security concern 
   Outside Activities – Involvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of 
security concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual's security responsibilities 
and could create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information. 
   Use of Information Technology – Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or 
regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about an 
individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability to 
properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. Information Technology 
Systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the 
communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of information.

18.15. The Privacy Act 
The Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended) establishes a code of fair information practices that govern 
the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal information about individuals that 
is maintained in a system of records by federal agencies. The Privacy Act provides individuals 
with a means by which to seek access to and amend their records and sets forth agency record- 
keeping requirements. 
Disclosure of Information. Privacy Act rights are personal to the individual who is the subject of 
the record and cannot be asserted derivatively by others. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure 
of information from a system of records without the written consent of the subject individual. 
Individuals have the right to request access or amendment to their records in a system. The parent 
of any minor, or the legal guardian of an incompetent, may act on behalf of that individual. 
Collection of Information. The Privacy Act limits the collection of information to what the law 
or executive orders authorize. System of Records Notices (SORNs) must be published in the 
federal register allowing the public a 30-day comment period. Such collection must not conflict 
with the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A Privacy Act 
statement must be given when individuals are asked to provide personal information about 
themselves for collection in a system of records. 
System of Records Maintenance. Privacy Act system of records is a group of any records under 
the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the individual’s name, number, 
or unique identifier. Note: Department of Defense personnel may disclose records to other offices 
in the Department of Defense when there is “an official need to know” and to other federal 
government agencies or individuals when a discloser of record is a “routine use” published in the 
SORNs or as authorized by a Privacy Act exception. In addition, information may be released for 
a disclosed specified purpose with the subject’s consent. The office of primary responsibility of 
the data should keep an account of all information they’ve released. 
Personally Identifiable Information. Personally identifiable information in a system of records 
must be safeguarded to ensure “an official need to know” access of the records and to avoid actions 
that could result in harm, embarrassment, or unfairness to the individual. The Office of 
Management and Budget defines a personally identifiable information breach as, “A loss of 
control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or 
any similar term referring to situations where persons other than authorized users and for an other 
than authorized purpose have access or potential access to personally identifiable information, 
whether physical or electronic.” For further information, definitions, exemptions, exceptions, or 
responsibilities and procedures for safeguarding and reporting of personally identifiable 
information breaches, refer to AFI 33-332. 
18.16. Freedom of Information Act 
The Freedom of Information Act provides access to federal agency records (or parts of these 
records) except those protected from release by specific exemptions. Freedom of Information Act 
requests are written requests that cite or imply the Freedom of Information Act. The law establishes 
rigid time limits for replying to requesters and permits assessing fees in certain instances. The 
Freedom of Information Act imposes mandatory time limits of 20 workdays to either deny the 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
354 
 
 
 
request or release the requested records. The law permits an additional 10-workday extension in 
the event that specific unusual circumstances exist. Note: Denials require notification of appeal 
rights. Requesters can file an appeal or litigate. Refer to DoDM 5400.07-R_AFMAN 33-302 for 
specific policy and procedures on the Freedom of Information Act and for guidance on disclosing 
records to the public. 
18.17. Cybersecurity 
Cybersecurity is defined as the prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of 
computers, electronic communications systems, wire communication, and electronic 
communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, 
authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. Cybersecurity disciplines include Air Force 
Risk Management Framework, IT controls/countermeasures, communications security, 
TEMPEST (formerly known as emissions security), AF Assessment and Authorization (formerly 
known as Certification and Accreditation Program), and Cybersecurity Workforce Improvement 
Program. AFI 17-130, Cybersecurity Program Management, describes risk management and 
cybersecurity as representations of dynamic, multi-disciplinary sets of challenges. Processes and 
practices must continuously evolve and improve to match the ever- changing threat environment. 
Cybersecurity Program Risk Management Strategy. The USAF’s Cybersecurity Program’s 
risk management strategy must ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all 
information owned or held in trust by the USAF is protected. The program strategy must also be 
integrated into all key mission and business processes. To ensure operational agility, cybersecurity 
capabilities will be balanced to include safety, reliability, interoperability, and ease of use, while 
maximizing performance, as well as promoting transparency and interoperability with USAF 
mission partners. All USAF personnel are required to complete Information Assurance Awareness 
training prior to system access and annually thereafter. 
Five Functions of the USAF Cybersecurity Program. The USAF Cybersecurity Program 
encompasses the five functions briefly described here. 
Identify. Develop and maintain the organizational understanding required to manage 
cybersecurity risk. 
Protect. Implement controls to ensure the delivery of mission critical infrastructure services. 
Detect. Possess the ability to detect cybersecurity events when they occur. 
Respond. Possess the ability to take action regarding detected cybersecurity events. 
Recover. Possess the ability to remain operationally resilient and to restore capabilities or 
services that were impaired due to cybersecurity events. 
18.18. Computer Security 
Computer security consists of measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of information systems assets including hardware, software, firmware, and 
information being processed, stored, and communicated. 
Limited Authorized Personal Use. Government-provided hardware and software are for official 
use and limited authorized personal use only. Limited personal use must be of reasonable duration 
and frequency that has been approved by the supervisor or office policy and does not adversely affect 
performance of official duties, overburden systems, or reflect adversely on the USAF or the 
Department of Defense. Internet-based capabilities include collaborative tools, such as simple 
notification service, social media, user-generated content, e-mail, instant messaging, and online 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
355 
 
 
 
discussion forums. When accessing internet-based capabilities using federal government 
resources in an authorized personal or unofficial capacity, individuals shall comply with 
operations security guidance in AFI 10-701, and must be compliant with the requirements of the 
Joint Ethics Regulation. 
18.19. Information Systems 
An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, 
processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information 
systems also include specialized systems, such as industrial/process controls, telephone switching 
and private branch systems, and environmental controls. All authorized users must protect 
information systems against tampering, theft, and loss. Protection occurs by controlling physical 
access to facilities and data; ensuring user access to information system resources is based upon a 
favorable background investigation, security clearance, and need to know (for classified); and 
ensuring protection of applicable unclassified, sensitive, and classified information through 
encryption, according to the applicable Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 
Publication 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. 
Countermeasures. A countermeasure is any action, device, procedure, or technique that meets or 
opposes (counters) a threat, vulnerability, or attack by eliminating, preventing, or minimizing 
damage, or by discovering and reporting the event so corrective action can be taken. 
Threats. Every USAF information system has vulnerabilities and is susceptible to exploitation. 
Threats to information systems include, but are not limited to, any circumstance or event with the 
potential to adversely impact any operation or function through an information system via 
unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, or denial of service. 
There are three steps involved in protecting information systems from viruses and other forms of 
malicious logic. These steps include a combination of human and technological countermeasures 
to ensure the protection is maintained throughout the lifecycle of the information system. 
Infection. Infection is the invasion of information system applications, processes, or services by a 
virus or malware code causing the information system to malfunction. 
Detection. Detection is a signature or behavior-based antivirus system that signals when an 
anomaly caused by a virus or malware occurs. 
Reaction. When notified of a virus or malware detection, react by immediately notifying your 
information system security officer and following local procedures. 
18.20. Mobile Computing Devices 
Mobile computing devices are information systems, such as portable electronic devices, laptops, 
smartphones, and other handheld devices that can store data locally and access USAF managed 
networks through mobile access capabilities. All wireless systems (including associated peripheral 
devices, operating systems, applications, network connection methods, and services) must be 
approved prior to processing Department of Defense information. The information systems 
security officer will maintain documented approval authority and inventory information on all 
approved devices. All mobile computing devices not assigned or in use must be secured to prevent 
tampering or theft. Users of mobile devices will sign a detailed user agreement outlining the 
responsibilities and restrictions for use. 
 
18.21. Public Computing Facilities or Services 
Do not use public computing facilities or services, such as hotel business centers, to process 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
356 
 
 
 
government-owned unclassified, sensitive, or classified information. Public computing facilities 
or services include any information technology resources not under your private or U.S. 
Governmental control. Use of e-mail applications, messaging software, or web applications to 
access web-based government services constitutes a compromise of login credentials and must be 
reported as a security incident. 
18.22. Communications Security 
Communications security refers to measures and controls taken to deny unauthorized persons 
information derived from information systems of the U.S. Government related to national security 
and to ensure the authenticity of such information systems. Communications security protection 
results from applying security measures to communications and information systems generating, 
handling, storing, processing, or using classified or sensitive information, the loss of which could 
adversely affect national security interests. Communications security also entails applying 
physical security measures to communications security information or materials. 
Cryptosecurity. Cryptosecurity is a component of communications security resulting from the 
provision and proper use of technically sound cryptosystems. 
Transmission Security. Transmission security is a component of communications security 
resulting from the application of measures designed to protect transmissions from interception and 
exploitation by means other than cryptoanalysis. Examples of transmission security measures 
include using secured communications systems, registered mail, secure telephone and facsimile 
equipment, manual cryptosystems, call signs, or authentication to transmit classified information. 
Physical Security. Physical security is communications security resulting from the use of all 
physical measures necessary to safeguard communications security material from access by 
unauthorized persons. Physical security measures include the application of control procedures 
and physical barriers. Physical security also ensures continued integrity, prevents access by 
unauthorized persons, and controls the spread of communications security techniques and 
technology when not in the best interest of the United States and our allies. Common physical 
security measures include verifying the need to know and clearance of personnel granted access, 
following proper storage, and handling procedures, accurately accounting for all materials, 
transporting materials using authorized means, and immediately reporting the loss or possible 
compromise of materials. 
18.23. TEMPEST 
TEMPEST, formerly known as emissions security, is protection resulting from all measures taken 
to deny unauthorized persons information of value that may be derived from the interception and 
analysis of compromising emanations from cryptographic equipment, information systems, and 
telecommunications systems. The objective of TEMPEST is to deny access to classified, and in 
some instances unclassified, information that contains compromising emanations within an 
inspectable space. The inspectable space is considered the area in which it would be difficult for 
an adversary with specialized equipment to attempt to intercept compromising emanations without 
being detected. TEMPEST countermeasures, such as classified and unclassified equipment 
separation, shielding, and grounding, are implemented to reduce the risk of compromising 
emanations.

18.24. Antiterrorism Efforts 
The USAF seeks to deter or limit the effects of terrorist acts by giving guidance on collecting and 
disseminating timely threat information, providing training to all USAF members, developing 
comprehensive plans to deter and counter terrorist incidents, allocating funds and personnel, and 
implementing antiterrorism measures. 
HAF. At the strategic level, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance 
Reconnaissance, and Cyber Effects Operations (HAF/A2/6) and the Director for Intelligence, 
Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Operations, are responsible for ensuring the timely collection 
processing, analysis, production, and dissemination of foreign intelligence, current intelligence, 
and national-level intelligence information concerning terrorist activities, terrorist organizations, 
and force protection issues. 
The Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Air Force Office of Special Investigations 
(AFOSI) is the lead USAF agency for collection, investigation, analysis, and response for threats 
arising from terrorists, criminal activity, foreign intelligence, and security services. AFOSI is 
primarily focused on countering adversary intelligence collection activities against U.S. Armed 
Forces and will act as the USAF single point of contact with federal, state, local, and foreign nation 
law enforcement, counterintelligence, and security agencies. 
Commanders. Commanders at all levels who understand the threat can assess their ability to 
prevent, survive, and prepare to respond to an attack. A terrorism threat assessment requires the 
identification of a full range of known or estimated terrorist threat capabilities (including the use 
or threat of use of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosives and weapons 
of mass destruction). In addition to tasking appropriate agencies to collect information, 
commanders at all levels should encourage personnel under their command to report information 
on individuals, events, or situations that could pose a threat to the security of Department of 
Defense personnel, families, facilities, and resources. 
Antiterrorism Training. At least annually, commanders conduct comprehensive field and staff 
training to exercise antiterrorism plans, to include antiterrorism physical security measures, 
continuity of operations, critical asset risk management, and emergency management plans. 
Antiterrorism training should include terrorism scenarios specific to the location and be based on 
current enemy tactics, techniques, procedures, and lessons learned. Additionally, the current 
baseline through force protection condition ‘Charlie’ measures shall be exercised annually at 
installations and self-supported separate facilities. 
Random Antiterrorism Measures Program 
Installation commanders shall develop and implement a random antiterrorism measures program 
that will include all units on the installation. The intent of the program is to provide random, 
multiple security measures that consistently change the look of an installation’s antiterrorism 
program. 
Random antiterrorism measures introduce uncertainty to an installation’s overall force protection 
program to defeat surveillance attempts and to make random antiterrorism measures difficult for a 
terrorist to accurately predict our actions. The program shall be included in antiterrorism plans and 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
358 
 
 
 
tie directly with all force protection conditions, including force protection condition ‘normal’, to 
ensure continuity and standardization, should threats require USAF-wide implementation. Times 
for implementation, location, and duration of random antiterrorism measures shall be regularly 
changed to avoid predictability. Execution of random antiterrorism measures shall be broad based 
and involve all units and personnel. 
18.25. Ground Transportation Security 
Criminal and terrorist acts against individuals usually occur outside the home and after the victim’s 
habits have been established. Your most predictable habit is the route you travel on a regular basis. 
Always check for fingerprints, smudges, or tampering of the interior and exterior of your vehicle, 
including the tires and trunk. If you detect something out of the ordinary, do not touch anything. 
Immediately contact the local authorities. When overseas, travel with a companion. Select a plain 
car and avoid using government vehicles, when possible. Do not openly display military equipment 
or decals with military affiliations. Keep doors locked at all times. Do not let someone you do not 
know direct you to a specific taxi. Ensure taxis are licensed and have safety equipment (seat belts 
at a minimum). Ensure that the face of the taxi driver and the picture on the license are the same. 
18.26. Commercial Air Transportation Security Overseas 
Before traveling overseas, consult the Foreign Clearance Guide to ensure you meet all 
requirements for travel to a particular country. Get the required ‘area of responsibility’ threat 
briefing from your security officer, antiterrorism officers, or the appropriate counterintelligence or 
security organization within three months prior to traveling overseas. Use office symbols on travel 
documents if the word description denotes a sensitive position. Use military contracted flag 
carriers. Avoid traveling through high-risk areas. Do not use rank or military address on tickets. 
Do not discuss military affiliation. Have proper identification to show airline and immigration 
officials. Do not carry classified documents unless absolutely mission essential. Dress 
conservatively. Wear clothing that covers military or United States-affiliated tattoos. Carry plain 
civilian luggage. Do not wear or carry distinct military items. 
18.27. Suspicious Packages or Mail 
Look for an unusual or unknown place of origin; no return address; excessive amount of postage; 
abnormal size or shape; protruding strings; aluminum foil; wires; misspelled words; differing 
return address and postmark; handwritten labels; unusual odor; unusual or unbalanced weight; 
springiness in the top or bottom; inflexibility; crease marks; discoloration or oily stains; incorrect 
titles or title with no name; excessive security material; ticking, beeping, or other sounds; or special 
instruction markings, such as “personal, rush, do not delay, or confidential” on any packages or 
mail received. Be vigilant for evidence of powder or other contaminants. Never cut tape, strings, 
or other wrappings on a suspect package. If the package has been moved, place the package in a 
plastic bag to prevent any leakage of contents. If handling mail suspected of containing chemical 
or biological contaminants, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. Report suspicious mail 
immediately and make a list of personnel who were in the room when the suspicious envelope or 
package was identified. 
18.28. General Antiterrorism Personal Protection 
Individual vigilance is integral to the antiterrorism program, whether stateside or overseas. Several 
actions are provided here to help ensure individual protection. 
Dress and behave in a way that does not draw attention. 
Be inconspicuous and avoid publicity. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
359 
 
 
 
Travel in small groups. 
Avoid spontaneous gatherings or demonstrations. 
Be unpredictable. 
Vary daily routines to/from home and work. 
Be alert for anything suspicious or out of place. 
Avoid giving unnecessary personal details to anyone unless their identity can be verified. 
Be alert to strangers who are on government property for no apparent reason. 
Refuse to meet with strangers outside your workplace. 
Always advise associates or family members of your destination and anticipated time of arrival. 
Report unsolicited contacts to authorities. 
Do not open doors to strangers. 
Memorize key telephone numbers and dialing instructions. 
Be cautious about giving information regarding family travel or security measures. 
When overseas, learn and practice a few key phrases in the local language. 
18.29. Home and Family Security 
Spouses and children should always practice basic precautions for personal security. Familiarize 
family members with the local terrorist threat and regularly review protective measures and 
techniques. Ensure family members know what to do in any type of emergency. Several actions 
are provided here to help ensure home and family security. 
Restrict the possession of house keys. 
Lock all entrances at night, including the garage. 
Keep the house locked, even if you are home. 
Destroy all envelopes or other items that show your name, rank, or other personal information. 
Remove names and rank from mailboxes. 
Watch for unfamiliar vehicles cruising or parked frequently in the area, particularly if one or 
more occupants remain in the vehicle for extended periods. 
Post or preprogram emergency telephone numbers for immediate access. Report all threatening 
phone calls to security officials and the telephone company, making note of any background 
noise, accent, nationality, or location. 
18.30. Human Intelligence and Counterintelligence 
Human intelligence is a category of intelligence derived from information collected and provided 
by human sources and collectors, and where the human being is the primary collection instrument. 
Counterintelligence is information gathered and activities conducted to protect against such 
threats. A few primary human intelligence collection efforts are briefly described here. 
Interrogation. Interrogation is the systematic effort to procure information to answer specific 
collection requirements by direct and indirect questioning techniques of a person who is in the 
custody of the forces conducting the questioning. Proper questioning of enemy combatants, enemy 
prisoners of war, or other detainees by trained and certified Department of Defense interrogators 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
360 
 
 
 
may result in information provided either willingly or unwittingly. 
Source Operations. Designated and fully trained military human intelligence collection personnel 
may develop information through the elicitation of sources, to include: “walk-in” sources who, 
without solicitation, make the first contact with human intelligence personnel; developed sources 
who are met over a period of time and provide information based on operational requirements; 
unwitting persons with access to sensitive information. 
Debriefing. Debriefing is the process of questioning cooperating human sources to satisfy 
intelligence requirements, consistent with applicable law. The source usually is not in custody and 
is usually willing to cooperate. Debriefing may be conducted at all echelons and in all operational 
environments. Through debriefing, face-to-face meetings, conversations, and elicitation, 
information may be obtained from a variety of human sources. 
Document and Media Exploitation. Captured documents and media, when properly processed 
and exploited, may provide valuable information, such as adversary plans and intentions, force 
locations, equipment capabilities, and logistical status. The category of “captured documents and 
media” includes all media capable of storing fixed information, as well as computer storage 
material. This operation is not a primary human intelligence function but may be conducted by 
any intelligence personnel with appropriate language support. 
Human Intelligence Threat Areas. A few primary threat areas are briefly described here. 
Espionage. The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving 
information about national defense with intent or reason to believe the information may be used to 
the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. 
Subversion. An act or acts inciting military or civilian personnel of the Department of Defense to 
violate laws, disobey lawful orders or regulations, or disrupt military activities with the willful 
intent, thereby to interfere with or impair the loyalty, morale, or discipline of the U.S. Armed 
Forces. 
Sabotage. An act or acts with intent to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the national defense of a 
country by willfully injuring or destroying, or attempting to injure or destroy, any national defense 
or war material, premises, or utilities, as well as human and natural resources. 
Terrorism. The calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate 
fear intended to coerce or intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are 
generally political, religious, or ideological. 
18.31. Incident Reporting 
AFI 71-101, Volume 4, Counterintelligence, requires individuals who have reportable contacts or 
acquire reportable information, to immediately (within 30 days of the contact) report the contact 
or information either verbally or in writing to AFOSI. The AFOSI initiates and conducts all 
counterintelligence investigations, operations, collections, and other related activities for the 
USAF. When appropriate, or when overseas, AFOSI coordinates these activities with the Central 
Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The AFOSI is also the installation-
level training agency for counterintelligence awareness briefings and is the sole USAF repository 
for the collection and retention of reportable information. 
Contact is defined as any exchange of information directed to an individual, including solicited or 
unsolicited telephone calls, e-mail, radio contact, and face-to-face meetings. Examples include: 
contact with a foreign diplomatic establishment; a request by anyone for illegal or unauthorized 
access to classified or unclassified controlled information; personal contact with any individual 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
361 
 
 
 
who suggests that a foreign intelligence or any terrorist organization may have targeted him or her 
or others for possible intelligence exploitation; or receipt of information indicating military 
members, civilian employees, or Department of Defense contractors have contemplated, 
attempted, or effected the deliberate compromise or unauthorized release of classified or 
unclassified controlled information.  
USAF antiterrorism enlists the eyes and ears of all USAF military, civilians, contractors, and 
dependents. Each installation outlines procedures in their installation antiterrorism plan on how 
to receive and log suspicious activity reports and suspicious incident reports and pass those reports 
expeditiously to their servicing AFOSI. 
18.32. Protection of the President and Others 
As stated in AFI 71-101, Volume 2, Protective Service Matters, because of a formal agreement 
between the Department of Defense and U.S. Secret Service, individuals affiliated with the U.S. 
Armed Forces have a special obligation to report information regarding the safety and protection 
of the U.S. President or anyone else under the protection of the U.S. Secret Service. This includes 
the Vice President, the President- and Vice President-elect, and visiting heads of foreign states or 
foreign governments. In most cases, former Presidents and their spouses are also afforded lifetime 
protection of the U.S. Secret Service.

19.1.  USAF Way of Life 
USAF employees are required to comply with prescribed standards of conduct in all official 
matters, as well as when off-duty. This means military and civilian Airmen (RegAF, Air Force 
Reserve, and Air National Guard) are all expected to maintain high standards of honesty, 
responsibility, and accountability, as well as adhere to the USAF core values of Integrity First, 
Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do. As Airmen, we are proud of our high standards, 
adhere to them, and hold our fellow Airmen accountable. 
Air Force Standards. The USAF’s mission is critical to national security, global stability, and 
international relations. Each member has specific responsibilities for accomplishing his or her part 
in the mission. AFI 1-1 states that the importance of the USAF’s mission and its inherent 
responsibility to the nation require its members to adhere to higher standards than those expected 
in civilian life. While current Department of Defense and USAF policies provide specific 
guidance on standards, leaders must ensure members are kept informed of the USAF standards 
and take timely and appropriate actions to ensure standards meet the spirit and intent of USAF 
policy on proper conduct. 
19.2.  USAF Publications Process 
The USAF shall prepare all publications in accordance with DAFI 90-160, Publications and Forms 
Management. This includes, but is not limited to, policy directives, instructions, manuals, mission 
directives, and operating instructions. Additional guidance regarding the drafting of mission 
directives and operating instructions found in this guidance memorandum does not apply to mission 
directives, which are governed by Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) 90-1, Headquarters 
Air Force Mission Directives and Department of Defense Issuances Program or AFI 38-101, 
Manpower and Organization. 
DAF Policy Directive (DAFPD). DAFPDs are orders of the Secretary of the Air Force and contain 
directive policy statements that guide Department of the Air Force implementation of Department 
of Defense issuances or other authorities outside but binding on the Department of Air Force that 
require

action. 
They 
also 
initiate, 
govern, 
delegate 
authorities/responsibilities, and/or regulate actions within specified areas of responsibility by 
Department of Air Force activities. DAFPDs are written clearly and concisely and in a manner that 
an average Air and Space Professional can understand. 
DAFIs, AFIs, and Space Force Instructions (SPFIs). DAFIs, AFIs, and SPFIs are orders of the 
Secretary of the Air Force and are certified and approved at the DAF level. DAFIs, AFIs, and 
SPFIs generally instruct readers on “what to do,” i.e., direct action, ensure compliance to standard 
actions across the DAF. DAFIs, AFIs, and SPFIs are written clearly and concisely and in a manner 
that an average Air and Space Professional can understand. DAFIs, AFIs, and SPFIs may be 
supplemented at any level below the DAF unless otherwise stated in the publication. 
DAF Manual DAFMAN, AFMAN or Space Force Manual (SPFMAN). DAFMANs, 
AFMANs, and SPFMANs are Orders of the Secretary of the Air Force and generally instruct

readers on “how to” and may be either: 1) an extension of a DAFI, AFI, or SPFI, providing detailed 
procedure and additional technical guidance for performing standard tasks, or supporting 
education and training programs, or 2) an alternative to a DAFI, AFI, or SPFI, if appropriate. 
DAFMANs, AFMANs, and SPFMANs intended for use only by Air and Space Professionals who 
have graduated from special schools (such as flight training, intelligence, or maintenance schools) 
may include more specialized and technical language.

Nondirective Publications. Nondirective publications are informational and suggest guidance 
that may be modified appropriately to fit existing or forecasted circumstances. Complying with 
publications in this category is expected, but not mandatory. USAF personnel use these 
publications as reference aids or guides. Nondirective publications include pamphlets; basic and 
operational doctrine; tactics, techniques, and procedures documents; directories; handbooks; 
catalogs; visual aids; and product announcements.

19.3. On Duty Twenty-Four/Seven 
As stated in AFI 1-1, the mission must be accomplished, even at great risk and personal sacrifice. 
Airmen are always subject to duty, including weekends, holidays, and while on leave. Airmen, if 
so directed by a competent authority, must report for duty at any time, at any location, for as long 
as necessary. For the mission to succeed, we must always give our best. We must strive to be 
resilient—physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually— and be prepared to meet the 
challenges inherent to being a member of a fighting force, both in the deployed environment and 
at home station. Due to the importance of the USAF mission, the dangers associated with military 
service, national and international influences, and potential implications relevant to global 
operations, the USAF enforces more restrictive rules and elevated standards than those of the 
civilian community. 
General Orders. General Orders are often published to provide clear and concise guidance 
specifically tailored to maintaining good order and discipline in the deployed setting. Our current 
operations place us in areas where local laws and customs or mission requirements prohibit or 
restrict certain activities that are generally permissible in our society. We must respect and abide 
by these restrictions to preserve relations with our host nation and support military operations with 
friendly forces. No mission, particularly a combat mission, can succeed without the discipline and 
resilience produced by strict compliance with these rules. Members who fail to comply with 
General Orders may face adverse administrative action, non-judicial punishment, or criminal 
prosecution pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
19.4. Responsibility 
USAF standards must be uniformly known, consistently applied, and non-selectively enforced. 
Accountability is critically important to good order and discipline of the force. Failure to ensure 
accountability will hinder the trust of the American public, the very people living under the 
Constitution we swore to support and defend, and who look to us, the members of their nation's 
USAF, to embrace and live by the standards that are higher than those in the society we serve. 
Airmen have a responsibility to learn these standards well enough not only to follow them, but to 
articulate them clearly to subordinates and enforce proper observation by other members. For 
additional information on standards of conduct, refer to 5 CFR 2635, Standards of Ethical 
Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, the Joint Ethics Regulation, and AFI 1-1.

19.5. Law of War Defined 
The law of war, also called the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), is defined by the Department of 
Defense as the treaties and customary international law binding on the United States, that regulate: 
the resort to armed force; the conduct of hostilities and the protection of war victims in 
international and non-international armed conflict; belligerent occupation; and the relationships 
between belligerent, neutral, and non-belligerent states. 
Purpose of the Law of War. The law of war arises from civilized nations’ humanitarian desire to 
lessen the effects of conflicts. The law of war protects combatants and noncombatants, including 
civilians, from unnecessary suffering, and provides fundamental protections for persons who fall 
into the hands of the enemy, particularly prisoners of war, civilians, and military wounded, sick, 
and shipwrecked. The law of war aims to keep conflicts from degenerating into savagery and 
brutality, thereby helping restore peace. The law of war also serves to assist commanders in 
ensuring the disciplined and efficient use of military force and preserving the professionalism and 
humanity of combatants. 
Law of War Training. DoDD 2311.01, Department of Defense Law of War Program, requires 
each military department to implement effective programs that ensure law of war observance, 
prevent violations, ensure prompt reporting of alleged violations, and appropriately train all forces. 
Law of war training is an obligation of the United States under provisions of the 1949 Geneva 
Conventions, other law of war treaties, and customary international law. USAF personnel receive 
law of war training commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. Certain groups, such as 
aircrews, medical personnel, and security forces, receive specialized training to address unique 
situations they may encounter. 
Law of War Treaty Obligations. Article six of the U.S. Constitution states that treaty obligations 
of the United States are the “supreme law of the land,” and the U.S. Supreme Court has held that 
international legal obligations, to include custom, is part of U.S. law. This means that treaties and 
international agreements to which the United States is a party, enjoy equal status to laws passed 
by Congress and signed by the President. Therefore, all persons subject to United States law must 
observe law of war obligations, as well as military personnel, civilians, and contractors authorized 
to accompany the U.S. Armed Forces when planning or executing operations. 
19.6. Law of War Principles 
Five important law of war principles govern armed conflict, and are addressed here: 
Military Necessity. Military necessity is the law of war principle that justifies the use of all 
measures needed to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible, that are not prohibited 
by the law of war. Attacks must be limited to military objectives. Combatants, unprivileged 
belligerents, and civilians taking a direct part in hostilities, are military objectives and may be 
made the object of attack. Military objectives, insofar as objects are concerned, include objects 
which by their nature, location, purpose, or use make an effective contribution to military action 
and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, at the time, offer a definite 
military advantage. 
Examples of these objects generally include tanks, military aircraft, bases, supplies, lines of 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
366 
 
 
 
communication, and headquarters. Military necessity does not authorize all military action and 
destruction. Under no circumstances may military necessity authorize actions specifically 
prohibited by the law of war, such as the murder of prisoners of war, ill treatment of prisoners of 
war or internees, the taking of hostages, or execution or reprisal against a person or object 
specifically protected from reprisal. 
Humanity. The law of war principle of humanity forbids the infliction of suffering, injury, or 
destruction unnecessary to accomplish a legitimate military purpose. Although military necessity 
justifies certain actions necessary to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible, 
military necessity cannot justify actions not necessary to achieving this purpose. Moreover, once 
a military purpose has been achieved, inflicting more suffering is unnecessary and must be 
avoided. For example, if any enemy combatant has been placed hors de combat (in other words, 
taken out of the fight) through incapacitation by being severely wounded or captured, no military 
purpose is served by continuing to attack him or her. Similarly, the principle of humanity has been 
viewed as the source of the civilian population’s immunity from being made the object of attack 
because their inoffensive and harmless character means there is no military purpose served by 
attacking them. 
Distinction. The law of war principle of distinction imposes a requirement to distinguish 
(discriminate) between the military forces and the civilian population, and between unprotected 
and protected objects. Military force may be directed only against military objectives, and not 
against civilian objects. Civilian objects, such as places of worship, schools, hospitals, and 
dwellings, are protected from attack. A defender has an obligation to separate civilians and civilian 
objects (either in the defender’s country or in an occupied area) from military objectives. However, 
civilian objects can lose their protected status if they are used to make an effective contribution to 
military action. Employment of voluntary or involuntary human shields to protect military 
objectives or individual military units or personnel is a fundamental violation of the law of war 
principle of distinction. Parties to a conflict must not disguise their military forces as civilians or 
as other protected categories of persons to kill or wound opposing forces. 
Proportionality. Proportionality, as a principle of the law of war, may be defined as the 
expectation that even where one is justified in acting, one must not act in a way that is unreasonable 
or excessive. Proportionality generally weighs the justification for acting against expected harms 
to determine whether the latter are disproportionate in comparison to the former. In war, incidental 
damage to the civilian population and civilian objects is unfortunate and tragic, but often 
inevitable. Applying the proportionality rule in conducting attacks does not require that no 
incidental damage result from attacks. Rather, this rule creates obligations to refrain from attacks 
where the expected harm incidental to such attacks would be considered excessive in relation to 
the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated to be gained, and to take feasible precautions 
in planning and conducting attacks to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and other protected 
persons and objects. 
Honor. Honor is a principle of the law of war that requires a certain amount of fairness in offense 
and defense and a certain mutual respect between opposing military forces. In doing so, honor 
reflects the principle that parties to a conflict must accept certain limits on their ability to conduct 
hostilities. Honor also forbids the resort to means, expedients, or conduct that would constitute a 
breach of trust with the enemy. Enemies must deal with one another in good faith in their non- 
hostile relations. 
Even in the conduct of hostilities, good faith prohibits: (1) killing or wounding enemy persons by 
resort to perfidy (treachery), (2) misusing certain signs, (3) fighting in the enemy’s uniform, (4) 
feigning non-hostile relations to seek a military advantage, and (5) compelling nationals of a 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
367 
 
 
 
hostile party to take part in the operations of war directed against their own country. Honor, 
however, does not forbid parties from using ruses and other lawful deceptions against which the 
enemy ought to take measures to protect itself. 
19.7. The Protection of War Victims and Classes of Persons 
The Geneva Conventions of 1949 consist of four separate international treaties that aim to protect 
all persons taking no active part in hostilities, including members of military forces who have laid 
down their arms and those combatants placed out of the fight due to sickness, wounds, detention, 
or any other cause. These treaties also seek to protect civilians and private property. The Geneva 
Conventions also distinguish between combatants, noncombatants, and civilians. Should doubt 
exist as to whether a captured individual is a lawful combatant, noncombatant, or an unprivileged 
belligerent, the individual will receive the protections of the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention 
until their actual status is determined. 
Combatants. Lawful or “privileged” combatants are: (1) members of the military forces of a state 
that is a party to a conflict, aside from certain categories of medical and religious personnel; (2) 
under certain conditions, members of militia or volunteer corps who are not part of the military 
forces of a state, but belong to a state; and (3) inhabitants of an area who participate in a kind of 
popular uprising to defend against foreign invaders, known as a levée en masse. A combatant is 
commanded by a person responsible for subordinates, wears fixed distinctive emblems/uniforms 
recognizable at a distance, carries arms openly, and conducts his or her combat operations 
according to the law of war. Lawful combatants are subject to capture and detention as prisoners 
of war by opposing military forces. Combatants have a special legal status, as well as certain rights, 
duties, and liabilities. They have the right to prisoner of war status if they fall into the power of 
the enemy during international armed conflict. Combatants have legal immunity from domestic 
law for acts done under military authority and in accordance with the law of war. 
Noncombatants. Noncombatants include certain military personnel who are members of the 
military forces not authorized to engage in combatant activities, such as permanent medical and  
religious personnel. Noncombatants must be respected and protected and may not be made the 
object of attack. 
Civilians. Civilians, a type of non-combatants, are protected persons and may not be made the 
object of direct attack. They may; however, suffer injury or death incident to a direct attack on a 
military objective without such an attack violating the law of war, if such attack is on a lawful target 
by lawful means and adheres to the principle of proportionality. With the exception of the levée en 
masse, the law of war does not authorize civilians to take an active or direct part in hostilities. 
Civilians who take an active or direct part in hostilities forfeit protection from being made the object 
of attack. 
Unprivileged Belligerents: A Distinction Not Made by the Geneva Conventions. The term 
unprivileged belligerent is not used in the Geneva Conventions but is defined in the DoD Law of 
War Manual to include “lawful combatants who have forfeited the privileges of combatant status 
by engaging in spying or sabotage, and private persons who have forfeited one or more of the 
protections of civilian status by engaging in hostilities.” An unprivileged belligerent is an 
individual who is not authorized by a state that is party to a conflict to take part in hostilities but 
does so anyway. 
19.8. Military Objectives 
Military objectives include any object which by its nature, location, purpose, or use, makes an 
effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
368 
 
 
 
neutralization in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. 
Protection of Civilians and Civilian Objects. Military objectives may not be attacked when the 
expected incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, and damage to civilian objects would 
be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained. In 
general, military operations must not be directed against civilians. In particular, civilians must not 
be made the object of attack and must not be used as shields or hostages. Measures of intimidation 
or terrorism against the civilian population are prohibited, including acts or threats of violence 
with the primary purpose of spreading terror. The principle, that military operations must not be 
directed against civilians, does not prohibit military operations, short of violence, that are militarily 
necessary. For example, such operations may include stopping and searching civilians for 
weapons and verifying that they are civilians; temporarily detaining civilians for reasons of 
mission accomplishment, self-defense, or for their own safety; collecting intelligence from 
civilians, including interrogating civilians; restricting the movement of civilians, or directing their 
movement away from military operations for their own protection; or seeking to influence enemy 
civilians with propaganda. 
Feasible precautions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and civilian objects must be taken when 
planning and conducting attacks, and in connection with certain types of weapons. Also, feasible 
precautions should be taken to mitigate the burden on civilians when seizing or destroying enemy 
property. Commanders and other decision-makers must make decisions in good faith and based on 
the information available to them. Even when information is imperfect or lacking, as will 
frequently be the case during armed conflict, commanders and other decision-makers may direct 
and conduct military operations, so long as they make a good faith assessment of the information 
that is available to them at the time. Judge advocates, intelligence, and operations personnel play 
a critical role in determining the propriety of a target and the choice of weapon to be used under 
the particular circumstances known to the commander when planning an attack. 
Protected Objects. The law of war provides specific protection to certain objects, including 
medical units or establishments; transports of wounded and sick personnel; military and civilian 
hospital ships; safety zones established under the Geneva Conventions; religious, cultural, and 
charitable buildings; monuments; and prisoner of war camps. However, if these protected objects 
are used for military purposes, they may lose their protected status. An attack on protected objects 
near lawful military objectives, that suffer collateral damage when the nearby military objectives 
are lawfully engaged, does not violate the law of war, subject to adherence to the principle of 
proportionality. 
Enemy Aircraft and Aircrew. Enemy military aircraft may be attacked and destroyed, unless in 
neutral airspace or territory. Airmen who parachute from a disabled aircraft and offer no resistance 
may not be attacked. Airmen who resist in descent or are downed behind their own lines and who 
continue to fight may be subject to attack. The rules of engagement for a particular operation often 
include additional guidance for attacking enemy aircraft consistent with law of war obligations. 
An enemy’s public and private nonmilitary aircraft are generally not subject to attack unless used 
for a military purpose. 
If a civil aircraft initiates an attack, it may be considered an immediate military threat and may be 
lawfully attacked (on the basis it qualifies as a military objective). An immediate military threat 
justifying an attack may also exist when reasonable suspicion exists of a hostile intent, such as 
when a civil aircraft approaches a military base at high speed or enters enemy territory without 
permission and disregards signals or warnings to land or proceed to a designated place. 
Military medical aircraft are used exclusively for the removal of the wounded and sick and for 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
369 
 
 
 
the transport of medical personnel and equipment. Military medical aircraft are entitled to 
protection from attack by enemy combatants while flying at heights, times, and on routes 
specifically agreed upon between the parties to the conflict. Under the law of war, a military 
medical aircraft found to be in violation of established agreements could be lawfully attacked and 
destroyed after all other means of control (such as directing the aircraft to land and submit to 
search) have been exhausted. 
19.9.  Enforcing Law of War Rules 
All Department of Defense personnel, including contractors when assigned to or accompanying 
deployed armed forces, comply with the law of war during all armed conflicts and military 
operations. Law of war principles and rules are consistent with military doctrine for a profession 
of arms and is the basis for effective combat operations. Following doctrinal guidance, such as 
accuracy of targeting, concentration of effort, maximization of military advantage, conservation 
of resources, avoidance of excessive collateral damage, and economy of force, is consistent with 
the law of war and reinforces compliance. Each member of the armed services has a duty to comply 
with the law of war, which includes the refusal to comply with clearly illegal orders to commit law 
of war violations. For law of war violations, members may be prosecuted by courts-martial under 
the Uniform Code of Military Justice or through an international military tribunal. 
Reporting Violations. Department of Defense personnel who suspect or have information which 
might reasonably be viewed as a violation of the law of war committed by or against U.S. 
personnel, enemy personnel, or any other individual, shall promptly report the violation to their 
immediate commander or the proper authority. This includes violations by the enemy, allies, U.S. 
Armed Forces, or others. If the allegation involves or may involve a U.S. commander, the report 
should be made to the next higher United States command authority. Particular circumstances may 
require that the report be made to the nearest judge advocate, inspector general, a special agent in 
the Office of Special Investigations, or a security forces member. 
19.10.  Rules of Engagement 
Rules of engagement exist to ensure use of force in an operation occurs according to national 
policy goals, mission requirements, and the rule of law. In general, rules of engagement set 
parameters for when, where, how, why, and against whom commanders and their Airmen may use 
force. All Airmen have a duty and a legal obligation to understand, remember, and apply rules of 
engagement. The standing rules of engagement are approved by the U.S. President and Secretary 
of Defense and are issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They provide 
implementation guidance on the inherent right of self-defense and the application of force for 
mission accomplishment. Note: Mission-specific rules of engagement present a more specific 
application of law of war principles tailored to the political and military nature of a mission which 
are generally contained in an annex to execution orders, operations plans, and operations orders. 
Commanders at every echelon have an obligation to ensure that all operations comply with the 
mission rules of engagement and/or with the standing rules of engagement, as applicable. 
Self Defense. The fundamental U.S. policy on self-defense is repeatedly stated throughout the 
standing rules of engagement, “These rules do not limit a commander’s inherent authority and 
obligation to use all necessary means available to take all appropriate actions in self-defense of 
the commander’s unit and other U.S. Armed Forces in the vicinity.” Military members may act 
in individual self-defense unless otherwise directed by a unit commander. Several factors must 
be considered before the use of force in unit or individual self-defense. 
De-escalation. When time and circumstances permit, the forces committing hostile acts or 
demonstrating hostile intent should be warned and given the opportunity to withdraw or cease 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
370 
 
 
 
threatening actions. 
Necessity. Necessity in the context of self-defense under the rules of engagement focuses on the 
threat perceived by an individual, that is whether the individual perceives a hostile act has 
occurred, or hostile intent is being demonstrated. Hostile act and hostile intent includes force or 
threats of force used against the United States, U.S. Armed Forces, designated persons and 
property, or intended to impede the mission of U.S. Armed Forces. 
Proportionality. Proportionality in the context of self-defense under the rules of engagement 
relates to the reasonableness of the response to a threat. In self-defense, U.S. Armed Forces may 
only use the amount of force necessary to decisively counter a hostile act or a demonstration of 
hostile intent and ensure the continued safety of U.S. Armed Forces or other designated persons 
and property. Force used must be reasonable in nature, duration and scope compared to the threat 
based on facts known to the individual at the time. 
Pursuit. U.S. Armed Forces can pursue and engage a hostile force that has committed a hostile 
act or demonstrated a hostile intent if those forces continue to commit hostile acts or demonstrate 
hostile intent. Applicable rules of engagement may restrict or place limitations on U.S. Armed 
Forces’ ability to pursue or engage a hostile force across an international border.

19.11.  Responsibilities under the Code of Conduct 
The Code of Conduct is a moral code designed to provide U.S. military personnel with a standard 
of conduct that all members are expected to measure up to. The six articles of the Code of Conduct 
were designed to address situations that any member could encounter to some degree. It includes 
basic information useful to prisoners of war to help them survive honorably while resisting captors’ 
efforts to exploit them. It is also applicable to service members subject to other hostile detention, 
such as hostage scenarios. Survival and resistance in hostile situations requires knowledge and 
understanding of the six articles. Violations of the Code of Conduct are not criminally punishable 
per se, but actions that also violate the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) may subject 
members to disciplinary action. 
Code of Conduct Training. Department of Defense personnel who plan, schedule, commit, or 
control members of the U.S. Armed Forces must fully understand the Code of Conduct and ensure 
personnel have the training and education necessary to abide by it. The level of knowledge 
members need depends on how likely they are to be captured, their exposure to sensitive 
information, and how useful or valuable a captor considers them to be. Code of Conduct training 
is conducted at three levels, briefly described here. 
Level A—Entry Level Training. Level A training represents the minimum level of understanding 
needed for all members of the U.S. Armed Forces. This level is imparted to all personnel during 
entry training. 
Level B—Training After Assumption of Duty Eligibility. Level B training is an enhanced 
version of training from Level A. It is the minimum level of understanding needed for service 
members whose military jobs, specialties, or assignments entail moderate risk of capture, such as 
members of ground combat units. Training is conducted for such service members as soon as their 
assumption of duty makes them eligible. 
Level C—Training Upon Assumption of Duties or Responsibilities. Level C training is an 
enhanced version of training from Levels A and B. It is the minimum level of understanding 
needed for military service members whose military jobs, specialties, or assignments entail 
significant or high risk of capture and whose position, rank, or seniority makes them vulnerable to 
greater-than-average exploitation efforts by a captor. Examples include aircrews and special 
mission forces, such as pararescue teams. Training for these members is conducted upon their 
assumption of the duties or responsibilities that make them eligible. 
19.12.  The Articles of the Code of Conduct 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower first published the Code of Conduct for members of the U.S. 
Armed Forces on 17 August 1955. In March 1988, President Ronald W. Reagan amended the code 
with gender-neutral language. The six articles of the Code of Conduct are listed below, followed 
by an explanation of each article and significant aspects of that article. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
372 
 
 
 
ARTICLE I 
I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of 
life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense. 
 
ARTICLE II 
I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender 
the members of my command while they still have the means to resist. 
 
ARTICLE III 
If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every 
effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special 
favors from the enemy. 
 
ARTICLE IV 
If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give 
no information or take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. 
If I am senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those 
appointed over me and will back them up in every way. 
 
ARTICLE V 
When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, 
rank, service number, and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to 
the utmost of my ability. I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my 
country and its allies or harmful to their cause. 
 
ARTICLE VI 
I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my 
actions, and dedicated to the principles which made my country free. I will trust in 
my God and in the United States of America. 
ARTICLE I. Article I applies to all members at all times. A member of the U.S. Armed Forces 
has a duty to support U.S. interests and oppose U.S. enemies regardless of the circumstances, 
whether in active combat or captivity. Past experiences of captured Americans reveals that 
honorable survival in captivity requires a high degree of dedication and motivation. Maintaining 
these qualities requires knowledge of and a strong belief in the advantages of American democratic 
institutions and concepts. Maintaining these qualities also requires a love of and faith in the United 
States and a conviction that the United States’ cause is just. Honorable survival in captivity 
depends on faith in, and loyalty to, fellow prisoners of war. Note: Possessing the dedication and 
motivation fostered by such beliefs and trust may help prisoners of war survive long, stressful 
periods of captivity, and has helped many return to their country and families with their honor and 
self-esteem intact. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
373 
 
 
 
ARTICLE II. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces may never surrender voluntarily. Even when 
isolated and no longer able to inflict casualties on the enemy or otherwise defend themselves, their 
duty is to evade capture and rejoin the nearest friendly force. Surrender is the willful act of giving 
oneself up to the enemy. In contrast, capture occurs when a member has no means to resist, evasion 
is impossible, and further fighting would lead to death of the U.S. member with no significant loss 
to the enemy. Capture dictated by overwhelming enemy strength and the futility of fighting is not 
dishonorable. Service members must understand and have confidence in search and recovery 
forces rescue procedures and techniques, and proper evasion destination procedures. Note: Under 
the UCMJ, a U.S. commander who shamefully surrenders to the enemy, any command or place 
that is his or her duty to defend, is subject to punishment. In addition, any person subject to the 
UCMJ who compels or attempts to compel a commander of any place, vessel, aircraft, or other 
military property, or of any body of members of the Armed Forces, to give it up to an enemy or to 
abandon it, or who strikes the colors or flag to an enemy without proper authority, is subject to 
punishment. 
ARTICLE III. A U.S. Armed Forces member’s duty to continue to resist enemy exploitation by 
all means available is not lessened by the misfortune of capture. Contrary to the 1949 Geneva 
Conventions, enemies that United States forces have engaged since 1949 have treated the prisoner 
of war compound as an extension of the battlefield. The prisoner of war must be prepared for this. 
Enemies have used a variety of tactics to exploit prisoners of war for propaganda purposes or to 
obtain military information, in spite of Geneva Conventions prohibitions. Physical and mental 
harassment, general mistreatment, torture, medical neglect, and political indoctrination have all 
been used, and the enemy has tried to tempt prisoners of war to accept special favors or privileges 
in return for statements or information, or for a pledge by the prisoner of war not to attempt escape. 
A prisoner of war must not seek special privileges or accept special favors at the expense of fellow 
prisoners of war. Under the guidance and supervision of the senior military person, the prisoner of 
war must be prepared to take advantage of escape opportunities. In communal detention, the 
welfare of the prisoners of war who remain behind must be considered. Additionally, prisoners of 
war should not sign or enter into a parole agreement. Parole agreements are promises the prisoners 
of war make to the captor to fulfill stated conditions, such as not to bear arms, in exchange for 
special privileges, such as release or lessened restraint. 
Members should understand that captivity involves continuous control by a captor who may 
attempt to use the prisoner of war as a source of information for political purposes or as a potential 
subject for political indoctrination. Members must familiarize themselves with prisoner of war and 
captor rights and obligations under the Geneva Conventions, understanding that some captors have 
accused prisoners of war of being war criminals simply because they waged war against them. 
Continued efforts to escape are critical because a successful escape causes the enemy to divert 
forces that may otherwise be fighting, provides the United States valuable information about the 
enemy and other prisoners of war, and serves as a positive example to all members of the U.S. 
Armed Forces. 
ARTICLE IV. Officers and enlisted members continue to carry out their responsibilities and 
exercise authority in captivity. Informing, or any other action detrimental to a fellow prisoner of 
war, is despicable and expressly forbidden. Prisoners of war must avoid helping the enemy identify 
fellow prisoners of war who may have valuable knowledge to the enemy. Strong leadership is 
essential to discipline. Without discipline, camp organization, resistance, and even survival may 
be impossible. Personal hygiene, camp sanitation, and care of the sick and wounded are imperative. 
Wherever located, prisoners of war must organize in a military manner under the senior military 
prisoner of war, regardless of military service. If the senior prisoner of war is incapacitated or 
otherwise unable to act, the next senior prisoner of war assumes command. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
374 
 
 
 
Members must be trained to understand and accept leadership from those in command and abide 
by the decisions of the senior prisoner of war, regardless of military service. Failing to do so may 
result in punishment under the UCMJ. Additionally, a prisoner of war who voluntarily informs or 
collaborates with the captor is a traitor to the United States and fellow prisoners of war, and after 
repatriation, is subject to punishment under the UCMJ. Service members must be familiar with the 
principles of hygiene, sanitation, health maintenance, first aid, physical conditioning, and food 
utilization. 
ARTICLE V. When questioned, a prisoner of war is required by the Geneva Conventions, and 
permitted by the UCMJ, to give name, rank, service number, and date of birth. Under the Geneva 
Conventions, the enemy has no right to try to force a prisoner of war to provide any additional 
information. However, it is unrealistic to expect a prisoner of war to remain confined for years 
reciting only name, rank, service number, and date of birth. Many prisoner of war camp situations 
exist in which certain types of conversation with the enemy are permitted. For example, a prisoner 
of war is allowed, but not required by the Code of Conduct, the UCMJ, or the Geneva Conventions, 
to fill out a Geneva Conventions capture card, to write letters home, and to communicate with 
captors on matters of health and welfare. The senior prisoner of war is required to represent 
prisoners of war in matters of camp administration, health, welfare, and grievances. A prisoner of 
war must resist, avoid, or evade, even when physically and mentally coerced, all enemy efforts to 
secure statements or actions that may further the enemy’s cause. Examples of statements or actions 
prisoners of war should resist include giving oral or written confessions, answering questionnaires, 
providing personal history statements, and making propaganda recordings and broadcast appeals 
to other prisoners of war to comply with improper captor demands. Additionally, prisoners of war 
should resist appealing for United States surrender or parole; engaging in self-criticism; or 
providing oral or written statements or communication that are harmful to the United States, its 
allies, the U.S. Armed Forces, or other prisoners of war. Experience has shown that, although 
enemy interrogation sessions may be harsh and cruel, a prisoner of war can usually resist if there 
is a will to resist. The best way for a prisoner of war to keep faith with the United States fellow 
prisoners of war, and him or herself, is to provide the enemy with as little information as possible. 
Service members familiarize themselves with the various aspects of interrogation, including 
phases, procedures, methods, and techniques, as well as the interrogator’s goals, strengths, and 
weaknesses. Members should avoid disclosing information by such techniques as claiming 
inability to furnish information because of previous orders, poor memory, ignorance, or lack of 
comprehension. They should understand that, short of death, it is unlikely that a prisoner of war 
will prevent a skilled enemy interrogator, using all available psychological and physical methods 
of coercion, from obtaining some degree of compliance. However, the prisoner of war must 
recover as quickly as possible and resist successive efforts to the utmost. 
ARTICLE VI. A member of the U.S. Armed Forces remains responsible for personal actions at 
all times. When repatriated, prisoners of war can expect their actions to be subject to review, 
including both circumstances of capture and conduct during detention. The purpose of such a 
review is to recognize meritorious performance and, if necessary, investigate any allegations of 
misconduct. Such reviews are conducted with due regard for the rights of the individual and 
consideration for the conditions of captivity. Members should understand the difference between 
the Code of Conduct as a moral code and the UCMJ as a legal code. Members should understand 
that failure to follow the Code of Conduct could ultimately lead them to commit misconduct 
punishable under the UCMJ. Members should also understand that the U.S. Government will use 
every available means to establish contact with prisoners of war, to support them, and to obtain 
their release. Furthermore, U.S. laws provide for the support and care of dependents of the U.S. 
Armed Forces, including prisoners of war family members. Military members must ensure their 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
375 
 
 
 
personal affairs and family matters are up to date at all times. Note: No United States prisoner of 
war will be forgotten. Every available means will be employed to establish contact with, support, 
and obtain the release of all our U.S. prisoners of war. 
19.13.  Detention of U.S. Military Personnel in Operations Other than War 
U.S. military personnel isolated from U.S. control are still required to do everything in their power 
to follow Department of Defense and USAF policy and survive with honor. Basic protections 
available to prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions may not be adhered to during 
operations other than war; thus, personnel detained may be subject to the domestic criminal laws 
of the detaining nation. These personnel should use the Code of Conduct as a moral guide to assist 
them to uphold the ideals of Department of Defense policy and survive their ordeal with honor. 
Rationale. Because of their wide range of activities, U.S. military personnel are subject to 
detention by unfriendly governments or captivity by terrorist groups. When a hostile government 
or terrorist group detains or captures U.S. military personnel, the captor is often attempting to 
exploit both the individual and the U.S. Government for its own purposes. As history has shown, 
exploitation can take many forms, such as hostage confessions to crimes never committed, 
international news media exploitation, and substantial ransom demands, all of which can lead to 
increased credibility and support for the detainer. 
Responsibility. U.S. military personnel detained by unfriendly governments or held hostage by a 
terrorist group must do everything in their power to survive with honor. Furthermore, whether 
United States military personnel are detained or held hostage, they can be sure the U.S. 
Government will make every effort to obtain their release. To best survive the situation, military 
personnel must maintain faith in their country, in fellow detainees or captives, and most 
importantly, in themselves. In any group captivity situation, military captives must organize to the 
fullest extent possible under the senior military member present. If civilians are part of the group, 
they should be encouraged to participate. United States military personnel must make every 
reasonable effort to prevent captors from exploiting them and the U.S. Government. If exploitation 
cannot be prevented, military members must attempt to limit it. If detainees convince their captors 
of their low propaganda value, the captors may seek a quick end to the situation. When a detention 
or hostage situation ends, military members who can honestly say they did their utmost to resist 
exploitation will have upheld Department of Defense policy, the founding principles of the United 
States, and the highest traditions of military service. 
Military Bearing and Courtesy. U.S. military personnel shall maintain military bearing, 
regardless of the type of detention or captivity, or brutality of treatment. They should make every 
effort to remain calm and courteous, and project personal dignity, particularly during the process 
of capture and the early stages of internment when captors may be uncertain of their control over 
the captives. Discourteous, nonmilitary behavior seldom serves long-term interests of a detainee 
or hostage and often results in unnecessary punishment that serves no useful purpose. Such 
behavior may jeopardize survival and complicate efforts to gain release of the detainee or hostage. 
Guidance for Detention by Governments. Detainees in the custody of an unfriendly government, 
regardless of the circumstances that resulted in the detention, are subject to the laws of that 
government. Detainees must maintain military bearing and avoid aggressive, combative, or illegal 
behavior that may complicate their situation, legal status, or efforts to negotiate a rapid release. As 
American citizens, detainees should ask immediately and continually to see United States embassy 
personnel or a representative of an allied or neutral government. United States military personnel 
who become lost or isolated in an unfriendly foreign country during operations other than war will 
not act as combatants during evasion attempts. During operations other than war, there is no

protection afforded under the Geneva Conventions. The civil laws of that country apply. 
A detainer’s goal may be maximum political exploitation. Detained U.S. military personnel must 
be cautious in all they say and do. In addition to asking for a U.S. representative, detainees should 
provide name, rank, service number, date of birth, and the innocent circumstances leading to their 
detention. They should limit further discussions to health and welfare matters, conditions of their 
fellow detainees, and going home. 
Detainees should avoid signing documents or making statements. If forced, they must provide as 
little information as possible. U.S. military detainees should not refuse release, unless doing so 
requires them to compromise their honor or cause damage to the U.S. Government or its allies. 
Attempting to escape by unfriendly governments is not recommended by Department of Defense 
policy except under life threatening circumstances. This is because attempted or actual escape from 
a government confinement facility will likely constitute a violation of the unfriendly government’s 
criminal law and may subject the escapee to increased criminal prosecution. 
Terrorist Hostage. Capture by terrorists is generally the least predictable and structured form of 
operations. Capture can range from a spontaneous kidnapping to a carefully planned hijacking. In 
either situation, hostages play an important role in determining their own fate because terrorists 
rarely expect to receive rewards for providing good treatment or releasing victims unharmed. U.S. 
military members should assume their captors are genuine terrorists when it is unclear if they are 
surrogates of a government. A terrorist hostage situation is more volatile than a government 
detention, so members must take steps to lessen the chance of a terrorist indiscriminately killing 
hostages. In such a situation, Department of Defense policy accepts and promotes efforts to 
establish rapport between United States hostages and the terrorists to establish themselves as 
people in the terrorist’s mind, rather than a stereotypical symbol of a country the terrorist may 
hate. Department of Defense policy recommends U.S. personnel stay away from topics that could 
inflame terrorist sensibilities, such as their cause, politics, or religion. Listening can be vitally 
important when survival is at stake. Members should not argue, patronize, or debate issues with 
the captors. During rescue attempts, hostages should take cover, remain stationary when 
practicable, and not attempt to help rescuers. Hostages may experience rough handling from the 
rescuers until the rescuers separate the terrorists from the hostages.

20.1. Commander’s Inspection Program (CCIP) 
The Inspection System of the Department of the Air Force (AFIS) provides commanders with a 
credible, independent assessment process with which to measure the capabilities of assigned 
forces. As stated in DAFI 90-302, the purpose of AFIS is to enable and strengthen commanders’ 
mission effectiveness and efficiency; motivate and promote military discipline; improve unit 
performance and management excellence throughout the chain of command; and identify, report 
on, and analyze issues interfering with readiness, economy, efficiency, discipline, effectiveness, 
compliance, performance, and surety. Commanders at all levels are required to continuously 
evaluate force readiness, as well as organizational economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. 
Supervisors at all levels play an integral part in this process through continual assessment of 
personnel, programs, and their areas of responsibility. 
20.2. The Inspector General and Mission 
The Inspector General (TIG). Serves as the functional and force management proponent for the 
DAF IG system, and communicates directly with the SecAF, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Chief 
of Space Operations, and all other USAF and USSF command elements on IG matters. TIG also 
provides guidance and oversight to the Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA) and the AFOSI. TIG 
also serves on a number of panels, groups, and councils regarding USAF issues and programs.  
Mission. The IG mission is to independently assess and report on the discipline, readiness, 
economy, efficiency, and overall readiness of the DAF to the SecAF through specified inquiries, 
investigations, and inspections. Programs established to ensure this responsibility is achieved 
include: AFIS; the Complaints Resolution Program; portions of the Insider Threat and 
Antiterrorism Programs.  
20.3. Inspector General Role 
While IGs at all levels are the “eyes and ears” of the commander, their role is aligned to remove 
perceived conflicts of interest, lack of independence, or apprehension by DAF personnel with 
regard to the chain of command. The primary charge of the IG is to sustain a credible DAF IG 
system by ensuring the existence of responsive complaint resolutions, including investigations, 
characterized by objectivity, integrity, and impartiality. The IG ensures the concerns of RegAF, 
Reserve, and Guard members; civilian employees, family members, and retirees; and the best 
interests of the DAF, are addressed through objective fact-finding. Wing, Delta, and equivalent 
IGs execute the commander’s inspection program, validate, and verify unit self-assessments, and 
provide the commander an independent assessment of unit effectiveness. They inform the 
commander of potential areas of concern as reflected by trends; function as the fact finder and 
honest broker in the resolution of complaints; educate and train commanders and members of the 
base population on their rights and responsibilities in regard to the DAF IG system; and help 
commanders prevent, detect, and correct FWA and mismanagement. Airmen and Guardians at all 
levels may report suspected systematic, programmatic, or procedural weaknesses, or seek further 
assurance that resources are used effectively and efficiently by contacting the IG office.  
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
378 
 
 
 
20.4.   Inspector General Selection 
Eligible personnel are selected for a DAF IG assignment as functional experts with broad 
contemporary experience from across the USAF. In addition to specific job requirement criteria 
listed in DAFI 90-302, Airmen and Guardians selected for IG duties should possess attributes of 
the highest professional standards and moral character, demonstrate potential for future service 
and continued promotion, and provide credibility for those Airmen, Guardians, family members, 
and civilians who seek IG assistance. Additional qualifications include the ability to attain and 
hold a security clearance commensurate with the duties required as an IG inspector, have no 
record of civil conviction except for minor offenses, have neither conviction by court-martial, 
non-judicial punishment, or Unfavorable Information File in the official military personnel file, 
and present good military bearing and appearance. Note: Nuclear surety inspection inspectors 
will have prior nuclear experience or experience applicable to current systems in the respective 
MAJCOM prior to assignment as a nuclear inspector.  
20.5. Air Force Inspection Scheduling Process (Gatekeepers) 
The purpose of the Air Force Scheduling Process (Gatekeeper) is to synchronize inspection efforts 
to maximize unit training days available and inspection resource usage, build out year schedules, 
and align non-AF inspection requirements. Gatekeepers ensure the inspection system is able to 
inspect units independently and efficiently on behalf of the command chain and ensure a 
commander’s priorities take precedence over non-mission essential activities of any unit or 
organization. Gatekeepers have the authority to approve, disapprove, schedule, deconflict, and 
eliminate duplication between all inspection-type activities on behalf of their commanders. 
20.6. Inspection Types 
Commander’s Inspection Program. A validated, accurate, and trusted CCIP is the cornerstone 
of the Air Force Inspection System. An effective CCIP should provide the Wing commander, 
subordinate commanders, and Airmen and Guardians the right information at the right time to 
appropriately assess risk, identify areas for improvement, determine root causes, and precisely 
focus limited resources—all aligned with the Commander’s priorities on the Commander’s 
timeline. The purpose of the CCIP is to improve readiness, efficiency, discipline, effectiveness, 
compliance, and surety at the Wing level. The intent of assessing these components is to provide 
critical data to leadership about the adequacy of policy, training, manpower and personnel, funds, 
equipment, and facilities.  
Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI). Nuclear weapon systems and the units to which they are 
assigned require special consideration because of political and military importance, destructive 
power, and the potential consequences of a nuclear weapons incident or accident. MAJCOM IGs 
execute nuclear inspections as a component of the Unit Effectiveness Inspection via performance 
and compliance-based inspections to evaluate a unit’s ability to manage nuclear resources while 
complying with all nuclear surety standards. The purpose of the NSI is to evaluate a 
certified nuclear-capable unit’s ability to manage assigned nuclear resources and execute nuclear 
missions in a safe, secure, and reliable manner.  
Unit Effectiveness Inspection (UEI). The UEI is a multi-year external continual evaluation of 
Wing performance based on the four Major Graded Areas (MGA) conducted by MAJCOM IGs 
and the DAFIA on wings and wing-equivalents. It is intended to help the wing commander 
understand the areas of greatest risk from undetected non-compliance. The UEI evaluates the 
CCIP for accuracy, adequacy, and relevance, while providing an independent assessment of the 
Wing’s resource management, leadership, process improvement efforts, and the ability to execute 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
379 
 
 
 
the mission. The four MGAs are managing resources, leading people, improving the unit, and 
executing the mission.  
20.7. Unit Self-Assessment Program (USAP) 
One of the primary objectives of the AFIS is to foster a culture of critical self-assessment and 
continuous improvement and reduce reliance on external inspection teams. Similarly, the primary 
purpose of the self-assessment program is to accurately identify and report issues to the command 
chain in such a manner that makes Airmen feel they can safely report what’s true, not what they 
believe their commander or IG expects them to report. An effective USAP depends on Airmen 
and Guardians reporting the status of compliance with directives, and when they cannot comply, 
reporting what constraints prevent them from doing so.  
Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT). MICT is a USAF program of record and is a 
tool for managing USAPs. The USAP may include communication from self-assessment 
communicators (SAC) within the MICT.  
Self-Assessment Communicator (SAC). SACs are a tool designed to improve compliance with 
published guidance and communicate risk and program health up and down the chain of 
command. As a self-assessment tool, SACs ask Airmen and Guardians at the shop-level to self-
report compliance or non- compliance. SACs may be tailored at the lowest Wing administrative 
levels allowing units the flexibility to track on the most relevant questions.  
20.8. Reporting Inspection Findings 
IGs will ensure inspection reports document inspection activity findings, including safety, surety, 
or issues of military discipline. Upon completion of inspections, the IG will ensure inspection 
reports include validated data categorized as strengths, deficiencies, or recommended 
improvement areas. IGs at all levels should not duplicate deficiencies or observations which are 
already entered into the Inspector General Evaluation Management System (IGEMS), MICT or 
other self-assessment documentation or tracking methods by the inspected organization.

20.9. Enforcing Standards 
Enforcing military standards begins with individual accountability. There are some activities and 
behaviors that, while arguably not illegal, are nevertheless inconsistent with maintaining good 
order and discipline. Understanding the restrictions and our responsibilities for adhering to USAF 
standards will help prevent the need to reinforce these standards. 
The Air Force Complaints Resolution Program. The Air Force Complaints Resolution Program 
is a leadership tool that indicates where command involvement is needed to correct systematic, 
programmatic, or procedural weaknesses. Resolving the underlying cause of a complaint may 
prevent more severe symptoms or costly consequences, such as reduced performance, accidents, 
poor quality work, or poor morale. 
The program also ensures the effective and efficient use of resources, resolves problems affecting 
the Air Force mission promptly and objectively, creates an atmosphere of trust in which issues can 
be objectively and fully resolved without retaliation or fear of reprisal, and assists commanders in 
instilling confidence in Air Force leadership. Even though allegations may not be substantiated, 
the evidence or investigation findings may reveal systematic, morale, or other problems impeding 
efficiency and mission effectiveness. 
Submitting Complaints. Under the Air Force Complaints Resolution Program, a member has the 
right to present a complaint without fear of reprisal and is codified in Department of Defense and 
Air Force guidance directives and instructions. Complaints may be submitted in person, by phone, 
through electronic means, or in writing to supervisors, first sergeants, commanders, members of 
any level of the IG system, someone higher in the chain of command, or members of Congress. 
While members should attempt to resolve complaints at the lowest possible level before addressing 
them to higher level command or the IG, public law states that no person may restrict a military 
member from making a lawful communication to an IG or member of Congress. In addition to 
having the right to present personal complaints, a member has the responsibility to report FWA, 
or gross mismanagement; a violation of law, policy, procedures, instructions, or regulations; an 
injustice; any abuse of authority; inappropriate conduct; or misconduct through appropriate 
supervisory channels or the IG. Note: Only the IG may investigate allegations of reprisal and 
restriction under the Military Whistleblower’s Protection Act. 
Complaints Addressed By Other Grievance or Appeal Channels. Matters normally addressed 
through other established grievance or appeal channels may be referred back to the appropriate 
grievance or appeal channel unless there is evidence these channels mishandled the matter or 
process. Complainants must provide some relevant evidence that the process was mishandled or 
handled prejudicially before an IG channel will process a complaint of mishandling. 
Dissatisfaction or disagreement with the outcome or findings of an alternative grievance or appeal 
process is not a sufficient basis to warrant an IG investigation. For additional information on 
procedures for filing an IG complaint and further details regarding the program, refer to DAFI 
90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution. 
20.10. Commander’s Authority and Responsibility 
While preserving an Airman’s right of expression to the maximum extent possible, Air Force 
commanders have the inherent authority and responsibility to take action to ensure the mission is 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
381 
 
 
 
performed. This authority and responsibility includes placing lawful restriction on engaging in 
dissident and protest activities; writing, distributing, publishing, or posting any unauthorized 
material; frequenting establishments that have been designated as ‘off limits’; participating in any 
activities of illegal discrimination or any activities that a commander finds to be detrimental to 
good order, discipline, or mission accomplishment; interfering with the USAF mission or law and 
order; or presenting a clear danger to loyalty, discipline, or morale of members of the U.S. Armed 
Forces. 
20.11. Public Statements 
According to AFI 1-1, the issuance of public statements on official USAF matters is the 
responsibility of cognizant unit or installation commanders and their public affairs representatives. 
Ensuring that official statements are properly worded and approved, avoids statements that do not 
reflect official USAF policy or that could be misleading to the public if taken out of context. To 
ensure USAF official information is presented professionally, personnel should make certain it is 
accurate, prompt, and factual; is confined to their particular areas of expertise; avoids a 
hypothetical and speculative nature; accurately reflects USAF policy; is presented simply and 
honestly; and complies with the spirit and letter of the Secretary of Defense’s principles for public 
information. For additional information, refer to AFI 35-101. 
As representatives of the service in both official and unofficial contact with the public, members 
have many opportunities to contribute to positive public opinion toward the USAF. Each USAF 
member is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance, starting with public 
affairs, before releasing any proposed statement, text, or imagery to the public. This includes 
digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website. Members must ensure the information 
revealed, whether official or unofficial, is appropriate for release according to classification 
requirements in DoDM5200.01V1_DAFMAN16-1404V1. 
20.12. Free Exercise of Religion and Religious Accommodation 
Every Airman has the right to individual expressions of sincerely held beliefs, to include 
conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs, unless those expressions would have an adverse 
impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, good order, discipline, health and safety, or mission 
accomplishment. According to AFI 1-1, leaders at all levels must balance constitutional 
protections for their own free exercise of religion, including individual expressions of religious 
beliefs, and the constitutional prohibition against governmental establishment of religion. They 
must ensure their words and actions cannot reasonably be construed to be officially endorsing, 
disapproving, or extending preferential treatment for any faith, belief, or absence of belief. In 
accordance with DAFI 52-201, Religious Freedom in the Department of the Air Force, Airmen 
requesting religious accommodation must continue to comply with directives, instructions, and 
lawful orders until the request is approved. If the request is not approved, the decision must be 
based on the facts presented; must directly relate to the compelling government interest of military 
readiness, unit cohesion, good order, discipline, health, safety, or mission accomplishment; and 
must be by the least restrictive means necessary to avoid the adverse impact. 
20.13. Political Activities 
According to AFI 1-1, generally, as an individual, you enjoy the same rights and have the same 
responsibilities as other citizens. However, as a member of the USAF, the manner in which you 
exercise your rights is limited in some cases. While on RegAF status, members are prohibited from 
engaging in certain political activities to maintain good order and discipline and to avoid conflicts 
of interest and the appearance of improper endorsement in political matters. While USAF members 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
382 
 
 
 
do have the right and duty as American citizens to vote and voice opinions concerning political 
matters, we must be careful that personal opinions and activities are not directly, or by implication, 
represented as those of the USAF. 
Prohibited Activities. USAF members may not participate in partisan political fundraising 
activities, rallies, conventions (including making speeches in the course thereof), management of 
campaigns, or debates, either on one’s own behalf or on that of another. This prohibition applies 
whether the individual is in uniform or not, and regardless of whether an inference or appearance 
of official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement may be drawn. Participation includes more than 
mere attendance as a spectator. USAF members are prohibited from wearing their uniform at a 
political event, while making a public speech or interview, while walking picket lines, or 
marching in a rally or other public demonstration. In addition, USAF members may not use 
official authority or influence to interfere with an election, to affect its course or outcome, to 
solicit votes for a particular candidate or issue, or to require or solicit political contributions from 
others. Military personnel must not actively advocate supremacist, extremist, or criminal gang 
doctrine, ideology, or causes, including those that advance, encourage, or advocate illegal 
discrimination based on race, creed, color, sex, religion, ethnicity, or national origin or those that 
advance, encourage, or advocate the use of force, violence, or criminal activity or otherwise 
advance efforts to deprive individuals of their civil rights. Before engaging in any political 
activities, be sure to review applicable USAF instructions and guidance. DAFI 51-508 provides 
detailed information on what USAF members may or may not be allowed to do regarding political 
activities. DoD Directive 1344.10, Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces, includes 
guidance on political activities for all U.S. Armed Forces. Also reference DoDI 1325.06,  
Handling Protest, Extremist, and Criminal Gang Activities Among Members of the Armed Forces  
and DAFI 52-201, Religious Freedom in the Department of the Air Force. Note: Military 
members who engage in specific prohibited activities listed in DoDD 1344.10 and DAFI 51-508 
are subject to prosecution under Article 92, UCMJ, in addition to any other applicable provision 
of the UCMJ or Federal law. 
Military Criminal Investigative Organizations, Security Police, military commanders, and other 
military organizations and officials must report all allegations to Wing, Delta, or servicing IG 
office no later than 30 calendar days after receiving an allegation that an Airman or Guardian 
engaged in an activity prohibited under DoDI 1325.06. For Reserve Component officials, 
transmission is required not later than 60 calendar days. 
20.14. Alcohol Abuse 
USAF policy recognizes that alcohol abuse negatively affects public behavior, duty performance, 
and physical and mental health. The USAF provides comprehensive clinical assistance to eligible 
beneficiaries seeking help for an alcohol problem. According to AFI 1-1, USAF policy is to 
prevent alcohol abuse and alcoholism among its personnel and dependents; to assist USAF 
personnel in resolving alcohol-related problems; and to ensure humane management and 
administrative disposition of those who are unable or unwilling to be restored to full, effective 
functioning. All Airmen are responsible for exercising good judgment in the use of alcohol. State 
and foreign country drinking age laws, including those in a deployed environment, must be obeyed 
both on- and off-duty. Use of alcohol must not adversely affect duty performance or conduct on- 
or off-duty, to include the ability to be recalled, if specifically required, (when serving in an on- 
call status) during scheduled off-duty time. Also reference DAFI 34-107, Alcoholic Beverage 
Program. 
Drunk Driving. Drunk driving can lead to disciplinary action, including criminal prosecution 
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and local and state criminal laws. AFI 31- 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
383 
 
 
 
218, Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, applies to everyone with military installation driving 
privileges. A person with a blood alcohol concentration greater than .08 is considered impaired, 
even without any other evidence. If a member has a blood alcohol percentage of 0.05 but less than 
0.08, the person may be presumed to be impaired. This standard may be considered with other 
competent evidence in determining whether the person is under the influence of alcohol. There is 
a one-year driving privilege suspension for driving or being in physical control of a motor vehicle 
while under the influence of intoxicating liquor at a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent 
or greater. 
 
20.15. Substance Use/Misuse 
Department of Defense policy is to prevent and eliminate problematic substance use in the 
Department of Defense. Substance use and abuse is incompatible with USAF core values, 
maintenance of high standards of behavior, performance, readiness, and the discipline necessary 
to accomplish the Air Force mission. Additionally, substance abuse and misuse can cause serious 
physical and mental health problems and jeopardize safety. 
According to AFI 1-1, the illegal use of drugs, or improper use of legal drugs, is prohibited and 
will not be tolerated. In DAFMAN 44-197, Military Drug Demand Reduction Program, drug 
abuse is described as the wrongful use, possession, distribution, or introduction onto a military 
installation or other property or facility under military supervision, of a controlled substance, 
prescription medication, over-the-counter medication, or intoxicating substance (other than 
alcohol). “Wrongful” means without legal justification or excuse, and includes use contrary to the 
directions of the manufacturer or prescribing healthcare provider, and use of any intoxicating 
substance not intended for human ingestion. Drug abuse also includes inhalant abuse (sometimes 
referred to as huffing) and steroid use, other than that specifically prescribed by a competent 
medical authority. Violators are subject to punitive action under the UCMJ as well as adverse 
administrative actions, up to and including administrative separation. The knowing use of any 
intoxicating substance (other than the lawful use of alcohol, tobacco products, or prescription 
drugs), which is inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter 
mood or function, is prohibited and will not be tolerated. The possession of an intoxicating 
substance with the intent to use in a manner that would alter mood or function, without legal 
authorization, is prohibited and will not be tolerated. Failure by military personnel to comply with 
these prohibitions may result in prosecution under the UCMJ or state and local laws, as well as 
adverse administrative actions up to and including administrative separation. Note: USAF 
members with substance abuse problems are encouraged to seek assistance from the unit 
commander, first sergeant, substance abuse counselor, or a military medical professional through 
the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program. ADAPT and drug 
demand reduction programs include substance use/misuse prevention, education, treatment, and 
urinalysis testing. Members are held to the highest standards of discipline and behavior, both on- 
and off-duty. All patients diagnosed with a substance use disorder and entered into ADAPT will 
be recommended for limited duty, indicating the patient is not worldwide qualified. Individuals 
who experience problems related to substance use/misuse will receive counseling and treatment as 
needed; however, all USAF members are held accountable for unacceptable behavior. 
Commander’s Identification. Unit commanders will refer all service members for assessment 
when substance use or misuse is suspected to be a contributing factor in any misconduct. Examples 
include driving under the influence, public intoxication, drunk and disorderly conduct, spouse or 
child abuse and maltreatment, underage drinking, positive drug test, or when notified by medical 
personnel. Commanders who fail to comply with this requirement place the member at increased 
risk for developing severe substance problems and may jeopardize the safety of others and 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
384 
 
 
 
ultimately mission accomplishment. 
20.16. Drug Testing 
The USAF conducts drug testing of personnel according to DAFMAN 44-197. Drug testing is an 
effective deterrent for the illegal use of drugs; therefore, USAF military members are subject to 
testing regardless of grade, status, or position. Military members may receive an order or may 
voluntarily consent to provide urine samples at any time. Military members who fail to comply 
with an order to provide a urine sample are subject to punitive action under the UCMJ. Note: 
Commander-directed testing should only be used as a last resort because the results may not be 
used for disciplinary action under the UCMJ or to characterize an administrative discharge. 
Inspection under Military Rule of Evidence 313. In general, an inspection is an examination 
conducted as an incident of command, the primary purpose of which is to determine and ensure 
the security, military fitness, or good order and discipline of a unit, organization, or installation. 
Inspections may utilize any reasonable natural or technological aid and may be conducted with or 
without notice to those inspected. The positive result of a urine sample may be used to refer a 
member for a substance use evaluation, as evidence to support disciplinary action under the UCMJ 
or administrative discharge action, and as a consideration on the issue of characterization of 
discharge in administrative discharges. 
Probable Cause Search under Military Rule of Evidence 315. A probable cause search requires 
a search and seizure authorization from the appropriate commander, military judge, military 
magistrate, or other competent search authority in order to seize a urine specimen. Probable cause 
exists when there is a reasonable belief that evidence of illegal drug use will be found in the 
system of the member to be tested. Results may be used as evidence to support disciplinary action 
under the UCMJ, or in an administrative discharge action. 
Medical Purposes. Results of any examination conducted for a valid medical purpose, including 
emergency medical treatment, periodic physical examination, and other such examinations 
necessary for diagnostic or treatment purposes, may be used to identify drug abusers. Results may 
be used as evidence to support disciplinary action under the UCMJ or in administrative discharge 
action. 
Self-identification. USAF members (not currently under investigation or pending action), with 
alcohol problems, substance use problems, or personal drug use or possession, are encouraged to 
seek assistance from the unit commander, first sergeant, substance use counselor, or a military 
medical professional. Following an assessment, the ADAPT program manager will consult with 
the treatment team and determine an appropriate clinical course of action. Commanders may not 
use voluntary self-identification of a substance use problem against a member in an action under 
the UCMJ or when determining the appropriate characterization of service in an administrative 
discharge action.

20.17. Working Relationships 
Social interaction that contributes appropriately to unit cohesiveness and effectiveness is 
encouraged. Military members of all grades must maintain professional relationships with civilian 
employees and government contractor personnel they work with, supervise, or direct, and must 
avoid relationships that adversely affect or are perceived to adversely affect morale, discipline, 
respect for authority, and unit cohesion, or that violate law or regulation. While personal 
relationships between USAF members are normally matters of individual choice and judgment, 
they become matters of official concern when they adversely affect or have the reasonable potential 
to affect the USAF by eroding morale, good order, discipline, respect for authority, unit cohesion, 
or mission accomplishment. 
Professional Relationships. As stated in AFI 1-1, appropriate professional relationships are vital 
to the effective operation of all organizations and to maintaining good order and discipline. The 
nature of the military mission requires absolute confidence in command and an unhesitating 
adherence to orders that may result in inconvenience, hardships, and at times, injury, or death. This 
distinction makes the maintenance of professional relationships in the military more critical than 
in civilian organizations. AFI 36-2909, Air Force Professional Relationships and Conduct, 
establishes responsibilities for maintaining professional relationships. 
Unprofessional Relationships. Unprofessional relationships, whether pursued on- or off-duty, are 
those relationships that detract from the authority of superiors, or result in, or reasonably create 
the appearance of, favoritism, misuse of office or position, or the abandonment of organizational 
goals for personal interests. Once established, unprofessional relationships, such as inappropriate 
personal relationships and favoritism, do not go unnoticed by other members of a unit, and call 
into question the superior’s impartiality toward the subordinate and his or her peers. 
Unprofessional relationships must be avoided between officers, between enlisted members, 
between officers and enlisted members, between military personnel and civilian employees or 
contractor personnel, as well as within and across the military branches. Relationships in which 
one member exercises supervisory or command authority over another have the potential for 
becoming unprofessional. Similarly, differences in grade increase the risk that a relationship will 
be, or will be perceived to be, unprofessional because senior members in military organizations 
have direct or indirect organizational influence over the duties and careers of junior members. The 
ability of the senior member to directly or indirectly influence assignments, promotion 
recommendations, duties, awards, and other privileges and benefits, places both the senior member 
and the junior member in susceptible situations. 
Fraternization. Fraternization is an unprofessional relationship between an officer and enlisted 
member specifically prohibited by Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice. Fraternization 
exists when a relationship between an officer and an enlisted member puts the enlisted member on 
terms of military equality with the officer in a way that prejudices good order and discipline in the 
U.S. Armed Forces or brings discredit upon the U.S. Armed Forces. 
This custom of the service recognizes that officers will not form personal relationships with 
enlisted members on terms of military equality, whether on- or off-duty. Whether a contact or 
association constitutes fraternization depends on the surrounding circumstances, such as whether 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
386 
 
 
 
the conduct has compromised the chain of command; has resulted in the appearance of partiality; 
or has otherwise undermined good order, discipline, authority, or morale. The prohibition on 
fraternization extends beyond organizational and chain of command lines to include members 
among or across different services. In short, it extends to all officer and enlisted relationships. 
When fraternization occurs, the officer will be held primarily responsible, and is the only member 
subject to disciplinary action for fraternization under Article 134, UCMJ; however, an enlisted 
member involved in consensual fraternization is still engaged in an unprofessional relationship 
and is likewise subject to discipline under Article 92, UCMJ. 
20.18. Equal Opportunity 
The USAF Equal Opportunity Program fosters and supports equal opportunity and must be carried 
out in the day-to-day actions of all personnel. The USAF will not tolerate unlawful discrimination, 
harassment, or reprisal against individuals who engage in protected activity. Airmen must actively 
make workplace professionalism a top priority and take proactive steps to prevent and eliminate 
unlawful discriminatory or harassment behavior. Commanders and supervisors are charged with 
taking immediate and appropriate actions to address inappropriate behaviors or allegations once 
they are made aware and are encouraged to consult with their local equal opportunity office before 
initiating action to resolve such concerns. Refer to AFI 36-2710, Equal Opportunity Program, for 
additional information. Note: The Air Force Sexual Harassment/Unlawful Discrimination (24-
hour) Hotline (1-888-231-4058), is established to ensure USAF personnel can easily and freely 
report to proper Equal Opportunity authorities any allegations of sexual harassment or 
discrimination and provide information on sexual harassment and equal opportunity issues. 
Equal Opportunity Program Objectives. The primary objective of the Equal Opportunity 
Program is to eradicate unlawful discrimination and foster a positive human relations environment. 
To this end, Equal Opportunity offices at every installation stand ready to assist individuals, 
supervisors, and commanders with eradicating every form of unlawful discrimination and 
harassment from the workplace. To improve the USAF human relations environment, Equal 
Opportunity offices offer an array of counseling, mediation, education, assessment, training, 
general assistance, and complaint resolution services. 
Unlawful Discrimination. Unlawful discrimination can include the use of disparaging terms 
regarding an individual’s birthplace, ancestry, culture, or the linguistic characteristics common to 
a specific ethnic group. The use of terms that degrade or connote negative statements pertaining 
to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, genetic information, and mental or physical 
disability, can constitute unlawful discrimination. These terms include insults, printed material, 
visual material, signs, symbols, posters, or insignia. 
Unlawful Discrimination Against Military Members. Unlawful discrimination against 
military members includes any unlawful action that denies equal opportunities to persons or 
groups based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sex. This type of discrimination 
includes verbal, physical, and non-verbal forms, as well as social media. For military members, 
unlawful discrimination is unacceptable, on- or off-base, 24 hours a day. 
Unlawful Discrimination Against Department of Defense Civilian Employees. Unlawful 
discrimination against civilian employees includes any unlawful employment practice that 
occurs when an employer fails or refuses to hire or promote; discharges or otherwise 
discriminates against any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment; limits, segregates, or classifies employees or applicants for 
employment in a way that deprives or tends to deprive any individual of employment 
opportunities or otherwise adversely affects his/her status as an employee because of race, 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
387 
 
 
 
color, religion, national origin, sex, age (40 or older), genetic information, physical or mental 
disability, or reprisal). 
20.19. Harassment 
Harassment against military members or civilian employees includes any behavior that is 
unwelcome or offensive to a reasonable person, whether oral, written, or physical, that creates an 
intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. Harassment includes use of electronic 
communications, social media, other forms of communication, and in person. Harassment may 
include offensive jokes, epithets, ridicule or mockery, insults, or put-downs, displays of offensive 
objects or imagery, stereotyping, intimidating acts, veiled threats of violence, threatening or 
provoking remarks, racial or other slurs, derogatory remarks about a person’s accent, or displays 
of racially offensive symbols. Activities or actions undertaken for a proper military or 
governmental purpose, such as combat survival training, are not considered harassment. 
Six Distinct Forms of Harassment. The Air Force Equal Opportunity Program covers six distinct 
forms of harassment: discriminatory, sexual, bullying, hazing, retaliation, and reprisal. They are 
briefly described here. 
Discriminatory Harassment. Discriminatory harassment is conduct that is unwelcome based 
on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. 
Sexual Harassment. Sexual harassment is conduct that involves unwelcome sexual advances, 
requests for sexual favors, and deliberate or repeated offensive comments or gestures of a 
sexual nature when (1) submission to such conduct is, either explicitly or implicitly, made a 
term or condition of a person’s job, pay, or career, (2) submission to or rejection of such 
conduct by a person is used as a basis for career or employment decisions affecting that person; 
or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s 
work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment and is 
so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would perceive the environment as hostile or 
offensive. 
 Any use or condonation, by any person in a supervisory or command position, of any form of 
sexual behavior to control, influence, or affect the career, pay, or job of a member of the Armed 
Forces or a DoD civilian employee. Any deliberate or repeated unwelcome verbal comments 
or gestures of a sexual nature by any member of the Armed Forces or a DoD civilian employee. 
There is no requirement for concrete psychological harm to the complainant for behavior to 
constitute sexual harassment. Behavior is sufficient to constitute sexual harassment if it is so 
severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would perceive, and the complainant does 
perceive, the environment as hostile or offensive. Sexual harassment can occur through 
electronic communications, including social media, other forms of communication, and in 
person.  
To demonstrate the severity of sexual harassment violations in the military, in January 2022, 
President Joseph Biden signed an executive order that establishes sexual harassment as a 
specific crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
For purposes of conducting criminal investigations of formal complaints of sexual harassment 
pursuant to the procedures in 10 USC § 1561, sexual harassment is defined as conduct that 
constitutes the offense of sexual harassment as punishable under Article 134, UCMJ. 
 
Bullying. A form of harassment that includes acts of aggression by a military member or civilian 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
388 
 
 
 
employee with a nexus to military service, with the intent of harming a service member either 
physically or psychologically, without a proper military or other governmental purpose. 
Bullying may involve the singling out of an individual from his or her coworkers, or unit, for 
ridicule because he or she is considered different or weak. It often involves an imbalance of 
power between the aggressor and the victim. Bullying can be conducted through electronic 
devices or communications, and by other means including social media, as well as in person. 
Service members may be responsible for an act of bullying even if there was actual or implied 
consent from the victim and regardless of the grade or rank, status, or service of the victim. 
Bullying is prohibited in all circumstances and environments, including off-duty or “unofficial” 
unit functions and settings. Note: Bullying does not include properly directed command or 
organizational activities that serve a proper military or other governmental purpose, or the 
requisite training activities required to prepare for these activities, such as command-
authorized physical training. 
Hazing. A form of harassment that includes conduct through which military members or 
civilian employees, without a proper military or other governmental purpose but with a nexus 
to military service, physically or psychologically injure or create a risk of physical or 
psychological injury to service members for the purpose of: initiation into, admission into, 
affiliation with, change in status or position within, or a condition for continued membership in 
any military or Department of Defense civilian organization. Hazing can be conducted through 
the use of electronic devices or communications, and by other means including social media, 
as well as in person. Service members may be responsible for an act of hazing even if there was 
actual or implied consent from the victim and regardless of the grade or rank, status, or service 
of the victim. Hazing is prohibited in all circumstances and environments including off-duty or 
“unofficial” unit functions and settings. Note: Hazing does not include properly directed 
command or organizational activities that serve a proper military or other governmental 
purpose, or the requisite training activities required to prepare for these activities, such as, 
administrative corrective measures, extra military instruction, or command-authorized 
physical training. 
Retaliation. Retaliation is taking or threatening to take an adverse personnel action against a 
person, or wrongfully withholding or threatening to withhold a favorable personnel action with 
respect to a person, as a result of that person reporting a criminal offense or making a protected 
communication or planning to do either. A protected communication is a communication made 
to a Member of Congress or an Inspector General, or to certain other authorities when the 
communication discloses evidence of a violation of law or regulation, including sexual 
harassment and unlawful discrimination. A protected communication may also relate to gross 
mismanagement, fraud, waste, and abuse or a substantial danger to public health and safety. 
Retaliation is prohibited by Article 132, UCMJ. 
20.20. Military Equal Opportunity Complaint Process 
Only military personnel, their family members, and retirees may file military Equal Opportunity 
complaints. To file a complaint, the individual must be the subject of the alleged unlawful 
discrimination or sexual harassment. Third parties, to include commanders, supervisors, or co- 
workers, may not file a complaint on behalf of another individual. The Equal Opportunity office 
will refer all third party individuals who are aware of specific allegations of military Equal 
Opportunity policy violations to their respective chain of command. The Equal Opportunity office 
will not accept military complaints from military members, family members, or retirees if the 
concerns are related to off-base or Department of Defense civilian employment. 
Military Informal Complaint Procedures. The purpose of the military informal complaint 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
389 
 
 
 
process is to attempt resolution at the lowest possible level. To informally resolve unlawful 
discrimination and sexual harassment complaints, individuals may orally address or prepare 
written correspondence to the alleged offender, request intervention by a coworker, opt to use the 
alternate dispute resolution process, or use the chain of command, such as requesting assistance 
from the supervisor, first sergeant, or commander. There is no time limit for filing informal 
complaints and no requirement for commander approval before accepting informal complaints. 
Military Formal Complaint Procedures. The purpose of the military formal complaint process 
is to enable military members, retirees, and their family members to formally present allegations 
of unlawful discrimination to the Equal Opportunity office with the goal of attempting resolution 
through a complaint clarification process. The complaint clarification process involves gathering 
information regarding a formal military complaint or hotline complaint to determine whether a 
‘preponderance of evidence’ exists to demonstrate that unlawful discrimination occurred. The 
complaint clarification includes interviewing or taking statements from complainants, potential 
witnesses, alleged offenders, and anyone else who may have information relevant to the case. The 
Equal Opportunity office may use information gathered from other investigations in conjunction 
with, but not in lieu of, their own clarification process to establish a preponderance of credible 
evidence. The clarification results are forwarded to the Staff Judge Advocate for a legal sufficiency 
review. Once the review is complete, the alleged offender’s commander receives the complaint for 
final action, if appropriate. Military formal complaints must be filed within 60 calendar days of the 
alleged offense. The installation commander may waive the time limits for good cause based on a 
memorandum with sufficient justification provided by the complainant and submitted through the 
Equal Opportunity office. Formal complaints of sexual harassment are referred to security forces 
(SF) for an independent investigation pursuant to the procedures in 10 United States Code (USC) 
§ 1561. 
20.21. Civilian Equal Opportunity Complaint Process 
Only USAF employees, former employees, and applicants for employment may file civilian Equal 
Opportunity complaints. An aggrieved person can file a complaint if discriminated against on the 
basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age (40 and older), or disability, or if subjected 
to sexual harassment or retaliated against for opposing discrimination or for participating in the 
complaint process. Additionally, an employee can file a complaint under Title II of the Public 
Law 110-233, Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, which prohibits genetic 
information discrimination for any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job 
assignment, promotion, layoff, training, fringe benefits, or any other term or condition of 
employment. To harass or retaliate against a person because of his or her genetic information is 
illegal under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. 
Civilian Informal Complaint Procedures. The purpose of the civilian informal complaint 
process is to provide for the prompt, fair, and impartial processing, and resolution of complaints, 
consistent with legal obligations under Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1614, Federal 
Sector Equal Employment Opportunity. The objective is to seek opportunities to resolve issues at 
the lowest organizational level at the earliest possible time. The Equal Opportunity office will 
work with management and the Staff Judge Advocate in an attempt to resolve the complainant’s 
concerns. The Equal Opportunity office must complete the informal complaint process within 30 
calendar days of the complaint being filed unless the complainant grants an extension not to 
exceed 60 additional calendar days. If the matter is not resolved to the complainant’s satisfaction 
before the end of the authorized period, including extensions, the complainant is issued a notice 
of right to file a formal complaint. 
Civilian Formal Complaint Procedures. A formal complaint must be filed at the installation 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
390 
 
 
 
where the alleged discrimination occurred. For the complaint to be processed at the formal stage, 
the initial contact must be within 45 calendar days of the date of the matter alleged to be 
discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 calendar days of the effective date 
or when he or she becomes aware of the personnel action. The complaint must describe the actions 
or practices that form the basis of the complaint that was discussed with the Equal Opportunity 
office during the informal complaint process. The complaint must be filed with the Equal 
Opportunity director or designee within 15 calendar days of the complainant receiving the notice 
of right to file a formal complaint. 
The USAF is required to process civilian formal Equal Opportunity complaints in accordance with 
Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1614, Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity 
Management Directive 110. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires federal 
agencies to discharge certain responsibilities once a civilian formal Equal Opportunity complaint 
is filed. The Equal Opportunity office must process all formal complaints expeditiously and make 
a determination whether to accept, dismiss, or partially dismiss a complaint or portion of a 
complaint to allow an investigation to be completed within 180 calendar days from the date filed. 
20.22. Sexual Assault Prevention and Response 
The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Office is responsible for oversight of the 
Department of Defense sexual assault policy and works hand-in-hand with the services and the 
civilian community to develop and implement innovative prevention and response programs. Refer 
to AFI 90-6006, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program, for details regarding 
the USAF SAPR program. 
Installation Sexual Assault Response Coordinator. The installation Sexual Assault Response 
Coordinator (SARC) is the single point of contact at an installation or within a geographic area 
reporting to the installation commander, who oversees sexual assault awareness, prevention, and 
response training; coordinates medical treatment, including emergency care for sexual assault 
victims; and tracks the services provided to a victim of sexual assault from the initial report through 
final disposition and resolution. Note: The USAF will identify trained military SARCs, as well as 
trained civilian SARCs or SAPR Victim Advocates (SAPR VA), for rotational support of global 
contingency operations and deployments. Normally, each air expeditionary wing will warrant at 
least one SARC and one SAPR VA position. For deployments smaller than an air expeditionary 
force, deployed commanders must provide a sexual assault response capability consistent with 
USAF requirements. 
Victims’ Counsel. The Victims’ Counsel (VC) is a military attorney who is authorized to provide 
independent legal representation to eligible victims of sexual assault, sexual misconduct, stalking, 
and other similar crimes. A VC’s primary responsibility is to their client. The VC has 3 main roles: 
(1) Advocate - to provide victims zealous advocacy by protecting their rights; (2) Advise - to 
provide legal advice by developing victims’ understanding of the often complex investigatory and 
military justice system; (3) Empower - by removing barriers to their full participation in the 
military justice process. 
Sexual Assault. Sexual assault is criminal conduct that violates the standards the United States of 
America expects of the men and women serving in the USAF and is inconsistent with our core 
values of Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do. Inherent in these core 
values is respect: self-respect, mutual respect, and respect for the USAF as an institution. Sexual 
assault is an intentional sexual contact, characterized by the use of force, threats, intimidation, 
abuse of authority, or when the victim does not or cannot consent. The term sexual assault 
encompasses a range of sexual offenses specifically prohibited by Articles 120, 120b, and 80 of 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
391 
 
 
 
the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to include rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact, 
abusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy, or attempts to commit any of these offenses. 
Consent. Consent is defined as words or overt acts indicating a freely given agreement to the 
sexual conduct by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct 
means there is no consent. Lack of verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the 
accused’s use of force, threat of force, or placing another person in fear, does not constitute 
consent. A current or previous relationship, or the manner of dress of the person involved with the 
accused in the sexual conduct at issue, shall not constitute consent. There is no consent where the 
person is sleeping or incapacitated, such as due to age, alcohol or drugs, or mental incapacity. 
Response to an Allegation of Sexual Assault. Any military member or civilian employee, other 
than those authorized to receive confidential communications or otherwise exempted by law, 
regulation, or policy, who receives a report of a sexual assault incident about a subordinate in the 
individual’s supervisory chain, will report the matter to the commander, the SARC, and the Air 
Force Office of Special Investigations. Military members or civilian employees who become aware 
of a sexual assault incident, not involving a subordinate in the supervisory chain, are strongly 
encouraged, but not required, to report the incident to the SARC or encourage the victim to do so. 
20.23. Sexual Assault Reporting Options 
The USAF has two reporting options: unrestricted and restricted reporting. The USAF makes every 
effort to treat victims of sexual assault with dignity and respect, to protect their privacy to the 
maximum extent of the law, and provide support, advocacy, and care. Regardless of whether the 
victim elects restricted or unrestricted reporting, confidentiality of medical information will be 
maintained. 
Restricted Reports. The Department of Defense has directed the implementation of 
confidentiality in the form of a restricted reporting option that enables eligible victims to report 
allegations of sexual assault to specified personnel, without triggering an investigation. This 
reporting option is intended to remove barriers to medical care and support while giving the victim 
additional time and increased control over the release and management of personal information. 
Only SARCs, SAPR VAs, VVAs, and healthcare personnel may receive restricted reports of 
sexual assault. If a victim elects this reporting option, a victim may convert a restricted report to 
an unrestricted report at any time. Chaplains, legal assistance attorneys, and VC entitled to 
privileged communications will not accept a restricted report of sexual assault. However, in the 
course of otherwise privileged communications with chaplains, legal assistance attorneys, and VC, 
a victim may indicate that he or she wishes to file a restricted report. If this occurs, the chaplains, 
legal assistance attorneys, and VC will facilitate contact with a SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA to 
ensure that a victim is offered SAPR services. 
Unrestricted Reports. Any report of a sexual assault made by the victim through normal reporting 
channels, including the victim’s chain of command, law enforcement, and the Air Force Office of 
Special Investigations or other criminal investigative services, is considered an unrestricted report. 
If a victim elects this reporting option, a victim will not be permitted to change from unrestricted 
to a restricted report. The individual to whom an unrestricted report is made will notify the SARC. 
Any report of sexual assault made through the SARC, SAPR VA, VVA, or healthcare personnel 
by an individual who elects an unrestricted report and designates so in writing, will be forwarded 
to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Victims may elect to make a restricted report of 
sexual assault at all times, except in cases where the victim personally reported the incident to 
law enforcement (including MCIOs) or previously filed an Unrestricted Report with a signed DD 
Form 2910 for the same incident. Victims can file a Restricted Report even if the allegation has 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
392 
 
 
 
been inadvertently or previously disclosed to command by the victim, suspect, or third party; or 
he matter has been reported to law enforcement, to include MCIOs, by anyone other than the 
victim; or an investigation is initiated, in progress, or closed. 
In cases of an unrestricted report of a sexual assault or information concerning a sexual assault, 
information concerning the victim and the offense will only be provided to governmental entities 
or persons with an established official need to know. Those who are deemed to have an official 
need to know in the USAF to perform their respective duties, routinely include: law enforcement, 
commanders, and first sergeants of the victim and the alleged assailant, legal personnel, the SARC, 
SAPR VA, VVA, and healthcare providers, as required. 
Commanders notified of a sexual assault through an unrestricted report must take immediate steps 
to ensure the victim’s physical safety, emotional security, and medical treatment needs are met 
and that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations or appropriate criminal investigative agency 
and SARC are notified. 
Reporting Eligibility. The following individuals are eligible for both the restricted and 
unrestricted reporting option within the SARC program. 
RegAF members who were sexual assault victims perpetrated by someone other than the 
victim’s spouse. 
Military members, who are on RegAF status, but who were sexual assault victims prior to 
enlistment or commissioning, are eligible to receive SAPR services under either reporting 
option. Support to a member on RegAF status is available regardless of when or where the 
sexual assault took place. 
Service members’ dependents, 18 years of age and older, who are eligible for treatment in the 
military health system at installations in the Continental United States and outside of the 
Continental United States, and who were sexual assault victims perpetrated by someone other 
than the victim’s spouse. 
Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard members who are sexually assaulted when 
performing active service and inactive duty training. 
Department of Defense civilian employees will have access to full SAPR services that are 
offered to service members. This does not include additional medical entitlements or legal 
services to which they are not already authorized by law or policy. 
Collateral Misconduct in Sexual Assault Cases. An investigation into the facts and 
circumstances surrounding an alleged sexual assault may produce evidence that the victim engaged 
in misconduct. Collateral misconduct by a sexual assault victim is a significant barrier to reporting 
because of the victim’s fear of punishment. Some reported sexual assaults involve circumstances 
where the victim may have engaged in some form of misconduct like underage drinking or other 
related alcohol offenses, adultery, drug abuse, fraternization, or other violations of instructions or 
orders. 
In accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Manual for Courts-Martial, and 
USAF instructions, commanders are responsible for addressing misconduct in a manner that is 
consistent and appropriate to the circumstances. However, Rule for Courts-Martial 306 permits 
superior commanders to withhold disciplinary authority from subordinate commanders for 
individual cases, types of cases, or generally. Pursuant to DAFI 51-201, Administration of Military 
Justice, the authority to dispose of collateral misconduct in sexual assault cases is initially 
reserved to the special court-martial convening authority. In those cases, the subordinate 
commander forwards the case file, along with a written recommendation, to the initial disposition 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
393 
 
 
 
authority. The initial disposition authority may dispose of the collateral misconduct himself or 
herself or may return the case file to the subordinate commander and permit him or her to take 
action. 
Safe-to-Report Policy. The Safe-to-Report Policy is applicable to any allegation of sexual 
assault, regardless of whether the victim has filed a restricted or unrestricted report. The threshold 
issue for the applicability of the Safe-to-Report Policy is determining whether the alleged 
collateral misconduct in question is “minor” or “non-minor.” The authority to make such a 
determination is withheld to the Initial Disposition Authority (IDA), as outlined in DAFI 51-201, 
Administration of Military Justice, paragraph 10.5.1. The IDA’s determination is discretionary 
based on the totality of the circumstances involved in the case, but the IDA must assess the alleged 
collateral misconduct against the delineated aggravating and mitigating circumstances at a 
minimum. If the alleged collateral misconduct is deemed minor, then the Safe-to-Report Policy 
applies and the victim will not be disciplined. If the alleged collateral misconduct is non-minor, 
then the Safe-to-Report Policy does NOT apply, and the victim could be subject to disciplinary 
action.

20.24. Corrective Actions 
Commanders, supervisors, and other persons in authority can issue administrative counseling, 
admonitions, and reprimands that are intended to improve, correct, and instruct subordinates who 
depart from standards of performance, conduct, bearing, and integrity, on- or off-duty, and whose 
actions degrade the individual and the unit mission. 
Personnel Information File. Commanders and supervisors perform many personnel management 
functions requiring them to keep Personnel Information Files (PIF) on assigned personnel. DAFI 
36-2608, Military Personnel Records System, authorizes the use and maintenance of PIFs by 
commanders and supervisors. If a PIF is established, use of AF Form 10A, Personnel Information 
File, Record of Performance; Officer Command Selection Record Group (Folder), is required. 
Custodians must keep PIFs current and secured in a locked area or container to protect against 
misuse or unauthorized access. The member may gain access to their PIF at any time per AFI 33-
332. Contents of the PIF must be available to commanders, raters, first sergeants, senior raters, 
Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and Staff Judge Advocate personnel, as warranted. 
The release and review of the PIF contents in these instances are for official business or routine 
use. 
Unfavorable Information File. The Unfavorable Information File (UIF) provides commanders 
with an official and single means of filing derogatory data concerning a USAF member’s personal 
conduct and duty performance. With some exceptions, the commander has wide discretion as to 
what should be placed in a UIF and what should be removed. Mandatory documents in UIFs 
include suspended or unsuspended Article 15 punishment of more than one month (31 days or 
more), court-martial conviction, civilian conviction where the penalty or actions equivalent to a 
finding of guilty of an offense which resulted in confinement of one year or more or could have 
resulted in a penalty of confinement for more than one year or death, and control roster actions. 
Optional documents may be included in UIFs for up to one year. Individuals have three duty days 
to acknowledge and provide pertinent information before the commander makes the final decision. 
The commander advises the individual of the final decision. If the commander decides to file the 
information in a UIF, the individual’s response is also filed. 
Unit commanders must review all UIFs within 90 days of assuming or being appointed to 
command; when individuals are considered for promotion, reenlistment, permanent change of 
station or assignment, and reclassification or retraining. Commanders also review UIFs annually, 
with the assistance of the Staff Judge Advocate. Commanders keep the UIF for the disposition 
period unless early removal is clearly warranted. In the course of their USAF duties, the following 
individuals are authorized access to a member’s UIF: the member, commander, first sergeant, 
enlisted performance report reporting and rating officials, force support squadron personnel, 
inspector general, inspection team, legal office personnel, military equal opportunity personnel, 
law enforcement personnel, and substance abuse counselors. For additional information regarding 
the UIF program, refer to DAFI 36-2907, Adverse Administrative Actions. 
Control Roster. Control rosters are used by commanders to establish an observation period as a 
rehabilitative tool for individuals whose duty performance is substandard or who fail to meet or 
maintain USAF standards of conduct, bearing, and integrity, on- or off-duty. Commanders should 
consider prior incidents, acts, failures, counseling, and rehabilitative efforts when establishing 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
395 
 
 
 
control rosters. A single incident of substandard performance or an isolated breach of standards 
not likely to be repeated, is not ordinarily a basis for a control roster action. Commanders place 
an individual on the control roster by using DAF Form 1058, Unfavorable Information File 
Action, which puts the member on notice that his/her performance and behavior must improve, or 
he/she will face more severe administrative action or punishment. The individual acknowledges 
receipt of the action and has three duty days to respond and submit a statement on his or her behalf 
before the action is finalized. Placement on the control roster is a mandatory UIF entry and is 
initially instated for six months, but it can be removed early at the commander’s discretion. If a 
member is not rehabilitated within six months of being placed on the control roster, the 
commander initiates more severe action. The UIF six-month time period begins the day the DAF 
Form 1058 is finalized and ends at 2400 hours six months later. Note: The control roster is not to 
be used by commanders as a substitute for more appropriate administrative, judicial, or 
nonjudicial action. 
20.25. Administrative Counseling, Admonitions, and Reprimands 
Administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands are quality force management tools 
available to supervisors, commanders, and other persons in authority to help maintain established 
USAF standards and enhance mission accomplishment. These tools are intended to improve, 
correct, and instruct subordinates who depart from standards of performance, conduct, bearing, 
and integrity on- or off-duty, and whose actions degrade the individual and unit’s mission. 
Counseling, admonitions, and reprimands should be used as part of a graduated pattern of 
discipline in response to repeated departures from standards. The decision to issue a letter of 
counseling, admonition, or reprimand should be based primarily on the nature and seriousness of 
the incident and on the previous disciplinary record of the member. 
Counseling statements may be either verbal or written, but written corrective actions are more 
meaningful to the member, and when documented properly, may be used in subsequent 
proceedings. Written administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands are subject to the 
rules of access, protection, and disclosure outlined in the Privacy Act of 1974. The same rules 
apply to copies kept by supervisors and commanders and those filed in a UIF or PIF. 
Preponderance of the evidence is the standard to utilize in administrative action proceedings when 
evaluating whether the evidence establishes that misconduct occurred. A preponderance of the 
evidence simply means the greater weight of credible evidence. If such proof is lacking, 
administrative action is susceptible to being found to be legally unsupportable and, as a result, 
could be set aside. 
Letter of Counseling and Department of the Air Force Form 174, Record of Individual 
Counseling. Counseling is used by first line supervisors, first sergeants, and commanders to help 
Airmen use good judgment, assume responsibility, and face and solve problems. Counseling, 
whether conducted verbally or in writing, helps subordinates develop skills, attitudes, and 
behaviors consistent with maintaining USAF readiness. Counseling may be documented on an 
DAF Form 174, Record of Individual Counseling, or on bond paper or letterhead as a letter of 
counseling. 
Letter of Admonishment. An admonishment is used to document an infraction that warrants more 
severe action than a counseling, but not serious enough to warrant a reprimand. For officer 
personnel, if the letter of admonishment is not filed in the UIF, it must be filed in the individual's 
PIF. 
Letter of Reprimand. A reprimand is more severe than a letter of counseling and letter of 
admonishment and indicates a stronger degree of official censure. Commanders may elect to file 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
396 
 
 
 
a letter of reprimand in a UIF for enlisted personnel. Letters of reprimand are mandatory for file 
in the UIF for officer personnel. 
20.26. Administrative Demotion of Airmen 
Administrative demotion of an Airman is a tool available for commanders for certain reasons. 
Administrative demotions should not replace action under the UCMJ. There are a number of 
reasons to demote, such as failing to fulfill Airmen/NCO/SNCO responsibilities, failure to keep 
fit, and student status termination. When appropriate, Airmen should be given an opportunity to 
overcome their deficiencies before demotion action is initiated. The administrative demotion 
process is captured in AFI 36-2502. 
20.27. Administrative Separations 
Airmen are entitled to separate at their expiration of term of service unless there is a specific 
authority for retention. As a rule, Airmen separate on the date their expiration of term of service 
occurs, but their separation is not automatic. Airmen are members of the USAF until they are 
separated by administrative action. Many different reasons for separation exist. The suitability of 
persons to serve in the USAF is judged on the basis of their conduct and their ability to meet 
required standards of duty performance and discipline. Commanders and supervisors must identify 
enlisted members who show a likelihood for early separation and make reasonable efforts to help 
these members meet USAF standards. Members who do not show potential for further service 
should be discharged. Commanders must consult the servicing Staff Judge Advocate and military 
personnel flight before initiating the involuntary separation of a member. 
Required Separation. Airmen who will continue to serve in another military status must separate; 
for example, an Airman may separate to serve with the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard. 
An Airman may also separate to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer of the USAF or 
to accept an appointment as a warrant or commissioned officer of another branch of service. 
Voluntary Separation. Airmen may ask for early separation for the convenience of the 
government if they meet the criteria. Entering an officer training program, pregnancy, 
conscientious objection, hardship, and early release to attend school are some of the reasons for 
which members may be allowed to separate. 
Involuntary Separation. Physical conditions that interfere with duty performance or assignment 
availability, inability to cope with parental responsibilities or military duty, or insufficient 
retainability for required retraining, are reasons for involuntary discharge for the convenience of 
the government. Defective enlistment (fraudulent or erroneous) is also a basis for discharge. 
Airmen are subject to discharge for cause based on such factors as unsatisfactory performance, 
substance abuse, misconduct, or in the interest of national security. 
20.28. Service Characterization 
Airmen who do not qualify for reenlistment receive a discharge without regard to their remaining 
military service obligation. The service characterization depends upon the reason for the discharge 
and the member’s military record in the current enlistment or period of service. The service of 
members administratively discharged under DAFI 36-3211, Military Separations, may be 
characterized as honorable, general (under honorable conditions), or under other than honorable 
conditions. 
Honorable. Members separating at their expiration of term of service, or voluntarily or 
involuntarily separating for the convenience of the government, are characterized as honorable. 
An honorable discharge is given when the quality of the member’s service generally has met USAF 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
397 
 
 
 
standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty, or a member’s service is otherwise so 
meritorious that any other characterization would be inappropriate. 
General (under honorable conditions). A general (under honorable conditions) discharge is 
given when a member’s service has been determined to be honest and faithful, but significant 
negative aspects of the member’s conduct or performance outweigh positive aspects of the 
Airman’s military record. 
Under Other Than Honorable Conditions. An under other than honorable conditions discharge 
is given based upon a pattern of behavior, or one or more acts or omissions, that constitute a 
significant departure from the conduct expected of an Airman. This characterization can be given 
only if the member is offered an administrative discharge board or if a discharge is unconditionally 
requested in lieu of trial by court-martial. 
Discharge in Lieu of Trial by Court-Martial. If charges have been preferred against an Airman 
and if the Uniform Code of Military Justice authorizes punitive discharge as punishment for any 
of the offenses preferred, the Airman may request an administrative discharge instead of trial by 
court-martial. There is no guarantee; however, that the Airman’s request will be granted. 
20.29. Air Force Discharge Review Board 
The Air Force Discharge Review Board affords former USAF members the opportunity to request 
review of their discharge (except for a bad-conduct discharge, dishonorable discharge, or dismissal 
by general court-martial) within 15 years of the date of separation. The objective of a discharge 
review is to examine an applicant’s administrative discharge and consider changing the 
characterization of service, the reason for discharge, and the re-enlistment code (when applicable), 
based on standards of propriety or equity. Airmen separated under circumstances (except 
retirement) that make them ineligible for reenlistment, and officers discharged under adverse 
conditions, are briefed by the military personnel section at the time of their discharge about the 
discharge review board process. They are provided with a discharge review fact sheet and an 
application, DD Form 293, Application for the Review of Discharge from the Armed Forces of the 
United States. 
A personal appearance before the discharge review board is a statutory right. The applicant or the 
applicant’s counsel may appear before the board or address the board via video teleconference. 
Procedures allow the applicant latitude in presenting evidence, witnesses, and testimony in support 
of the applicant’s case. A board may also review the case based on documentation in the military 
record and any additional evidence provided by the applicant. 
20.30. Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records 
The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records is the highest level of administrative 
review for correcting military records. In most cases, applicants are members or former members 
of the USAF. In some situations, a family member, heir, or legal representative (such as a guardian 
or executor) of the member or former member with a proper interest, may request correction of 
another person's military records when that person is incapable of acting on his or her own behalf, 
is missing, or is deceased. With a few exceptions, most records generated by the USAF may be 
corrected by the board. Records addressed for change include, but are not limited to enlisted 
performance reports, fitness test results, debts incurred, discharges and reenlistment/reentry 
eligibility codes, survivor benefit plans, accumulated leave days, Article 15 actions, and 
reinstatement into the USAF. Records may be changed, voided, or created as necessary to correct 
an error or to remove an injustice. Applicable monetary benefits are recomputed based on the 
records changed. The board is a recommending body and will vote to grant, partially grant, or deny 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
398 
 
 
 
the requested relief. If the board recommends favorable relief, the case is forwarded to the 
Secretary of the Air Force or their designee for final decision. Unless procured by fraud, their 
decision is final and binding on all USAF officials and government agencies. 
Personal appearance to present an application to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military 
Records is not a statutory right and is granted solely at the discretion of the board, predicated on 
finding the applicant’s presence, with or without counsel, will materially add to the board’s 
understanding of the issue(s) involved. Information on the board’s authority, jurisdiction, and 
policy can be found in DAFI 36-2603, Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records 
(AFBCMR). Note: Applicants must exhaust other reasonably available administrative avenues of 
relief prior to applying to the AFBCMRs. If other administrative remedies have not been properly 
exhausted before applying, the application, DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military 
Record Under the Provisions of Title 10, United States Code, Section 1552, will be returned 
without action.

21.1.    Military Legal System 
The strength of the military depends on disciplined service members, ready to fight and win our 
nation’s wars. As stated in AFI 1-1, because military discipline enhances combat capability, 
because the military environment and duties are unique, and because military personnel serve 
throughout the world, a special system of laws and courts is required to maintain good order and 
military discipline. Good order and discipline are essential to maintaining a warfighting capability. 
Just as importantly, a fair and impartial system of military justice safeguards the morale of those 
who risk their lives in service to their nation. No other judicial system provides such expansive 
worldwide coverage or definitive purpose. 
21.2. Commander Responsibilities 
Effective leadership is the most desirable means of maintaining standards. Military law provides 
commanders certain tools, including court-martial and nonjudicial punishment, to address 
misconduct. Military commanders are responsible for maintaining law and order in the 
communities over which they have authority, and for maintaining the discipline of the fighting 
force. Ordinarily, the immediate commander determines how to dispose of an offense; however, a 
superior commander may withhold that authority, and, in certain categories of cases, such as 
sexual assaults and related misconduct arising from a sexual assault, the law gives specific 
authorities to the Office of the Special Trial Counsel. The Staff Judge Advocate is available to 
provide advice regarding issues of alleged misconduct. 
Commander Discretion. One of the commander’s greatest powers in the administration of 
military justice is the exercise of discretion, to decide how misconduct committed by a member of 
his or her command will be resolved. Each commander in the chain of command has independent 
yet overlapping discretion to dispose of offenses within the limits of that officer’s authority. A 
commander may dispose of a case by taking no action, initiating administrative action against the 
member, offering the member nonjudicial punishment, or preferring court-martial charges. 
However, under recent changes to the UCMJ by Congress, certain offenses, known as “covered 
offenses,” including sexual assault, murder, domestic violence, child pornography, and many 
other serious offenses, are under the exclusive court-martial authority of the Office of Special 
Trial Counsel in accordance with Article 24a, UCMJ. If a commander believes non-covered 
offenses should be disposed of by court-martial, the commander may prefer charges and forward 
the charges to the convening authority. The convening authority must personally make the decision 
to refer a case to trial by court-martial. Charges may be referred to one of three types of court- 
martial: summary, special, or general. The types of courts-martial are discussed in greater detail 
later in this chapter. 
21.3. Individual Responsibilities 
The military justice system is a tool used to correct and punish breaches of discipline. All Airmen 
have a general responsibility to be familiar with the military justice system, correct marginal or 
substandard behavior or duty performance of their subordinates and support their commander in 
the application of the military justice system for maintaining good order and discipline. This 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
400 
 
 
 
requires becoming involved when breaches of discipline occur and reporting all such violations to 
the proper authorities. Individuals should be prepared to investigate incidents when ordered to do 
so. It is important for all Airmen to be familiar with the right against self-incrimination under 
Article 31 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, know the resources available to assist in 
conducting legal investigations, and seek advice from servicing judge advocates or Area Defense 
Counsels before acting. 
Self-Reporting of Criminal Conviction. According to DAFPD 36-29, Military Standards, all 
commissioned officers and enlisted members who are on RegAF or in an active status in a Reserve 
Component will report, in writing, any conviction for a violation of a U. S. criminal law to their 
first-line military supervisor or the appropriate designated official within 45 days of the date of 
conviction. Additionally, pursuant to AFI 1-1, Airmen above the pay grade of E-6, on RegAF, or 
on active status in a Reserve Component must report any violation of any civilian criminal law, 
in writing, to their first-line supervisor within 15 days of the date of conviction. 
21.4.    Pillars of Military Justice 
Four primary components of the military 
justice system, as shown in Figure 21.1., 
include the U.S. Constitution, the Uniform 
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), the Manual 
for Courts-Martial (MCM), and Legal 
Precedents. These pillars are discussed here to 
provide an understanding of how they were 
established and how they shape our military 
justice system. 
The 
U.S. 
Constitution. 
The 
U.S. 
Constitution, the first pillar in the military 
justice system, is the ultimate source of 
authority from which all military law is 
derived. The framers of the U.S. Constitution gave Congress the authority to make rules for the 
military. Congress (the legislative branch) and the U.S. President (the executive branch) have used 
their combined authority to create the military justice system we know today. This separation of 
powers ensures a checks-and-balances function in overseeing our military justice system. 
Powers Granted to Congress. The U.S. Constitution provides that Congress is empowered to 
declare war; raise and support armies; provide and maintain naval forces; make rules for the 
government and regulation of the land and naval forces; provide for calling forth the militia 
(National Guard); organize, arm, and discipline the militias; and govern such part of them as may 
be employed in the service of the United States. Congress is also responsible for all laws deemed 
necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested 
by the U.S. Constitution in the U.S. Government. 
Authority Granted to the President. The U.S. Constitution provides that the U.S. President 
serves as Commander in Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces and of the militia of the states (National 
Guard) when called to federal service. By virtue of authority as Commander in Chief, the U.S. 
President has the power to issue executive orders to govern the U.S. Armed Forces as long as these 
orders do not conflict with basic constitutional or statutory provisions. 
Uniform Code of Military Justice. The UCMJ is the second pillar in the military justice system. 
In 1947, in the aftermath of the Second World War, and after unification of the Armed Services 
under the Department of Defense, Secretary James V. Forrestal, the first Secretary of Defense, 
Figure 21.1. The Military Justice System Pillars 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
401 
 
 
 
desired a uniform legal code that would apply to all services. His efforts set the stage for a uniform 
system of discipline that Congress enacted in 1950 as the UCMJ. Signed into law by President 
Harry S. Truman, the UCMJ became effective in 1951 and provided substantial procedural 
guarantees for an open and fair process that continues today. 
The UCMJ encompasses the sorts of crimes outlawed in all jurisdictions, such as murder, arson, 
larceny, etc., and crimes largely unique to the military environment. Unique military crimes 
addressed under the UCMJ include such offenses as desertion, absence without leave, disrespect 
toward superiors, failure to obey orders, dereliction of duty, wrongful disposition of military 
property, drunk while on-duty, malingering, and conduct unbecoming an officer. The UCMJ also 
includes provisions regarding punishing misbehavior before the enemy, improper use of 
countersign, misbehavior of a sentinel, misconduct as a prisoner, aiding the enemy, spying, and 
espionage. Since its enactment, the UCMJ has undergone several significant changes, largely 
designed to provide service members with additional due process rights in criminal proceedings. 
The rights afforded to service members today largely mirror the due process safeguards of civilian 
courts, and in certain aspects, are even more expansive than those enjoyed by civilians. 
Manual for Courts-Martial. The MCM is a publication, covering virtually all aspects of military 
criminal law, which is intended to serve as a comprehensive manual or guidebook for facilitating 
military justice worldwide. It contains the current version of the UCMJ, Rules for Courts-Martial, 
and Military Rules of Evidence, as well as templates, scripts, and analysis for use by military 
justice practitioners in the field. The MCM is divided into five parts that serve as binding authority 
for practitioners. Part I is the Preamble and explains the sources of authority for and structure of 
the MCM. Part II is the Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM), which are similar to the Federal Rules 
of Criminal Procedure used in civilian courts. The RCM largely serve to guide court-martial 
procedure. Part III is the Military Rules of Evidence (MRE), which closely resemble Federal Rules 
of Evidence and are designed to promote fairness in how evidence is admitted and used in courts- 
martial. Part IV outlines the punitive articles of the UCMJ, that is, the articles that service members 
may be charged with violating at a court-martial. Part V describes the rules and procedures for 
Article 15, nonjudicial punishment. Additionally, the MCM contains a number of non-binding 
appendices, including analysis of the punitive articles, a maximum punishment table for the 
punitive articles, and various templates and scripts. These appendices are designed to serve as 
helpful guidance for military justice practitioners as they prepare for or conduct courts-martial. 
Precedents. Precedents, the fourth pillar in the military justice system, refer to the prior decisions 
of appellate courts of the armed forces, as well as decisions of federal and state courts in certain 
instances. One of the primary functions of appellate courts is to resolve contentious questions about 
whether the law was correctly applied to facts of any individual court-martial. A decision of the 
Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals, or its superior court, the Court of Appeals for the Armed 
Forces, normally serves as binding precedent in future courts-martial or appeals where the same 
issue arises. Additionally, the decisions of other armed forces courts, e.g., the Army Court of 
Criminal Appeals, may serve as persuasive authority for judges and practitioners considering 
similar issues. As a matter of practicality, the punitive articles, RCM, and MRE are unable to 
address every possible legal issue that can arise in a court-martial. Precedents serve to fill those 
gaps. 
21.5. Legal Rights 
Members of the U.S. Armed Forces are afforded most of the procedural due process rights enjoyed 
by civilians in criminal cases, including protection against involuntary self-incrimination and the 
right to counsel. However, the Supreme Court and military appellate courts have repeatedly held 
that the Constitution and Bill of Rights do not apply in their entirety to courts-martial. For instance, 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
402 
 
 
 
court-martial juries—called panels—are not required to reach a unanimous verdict in order to 
convict members of a criminal offense (with the exception of capital cases, meaning cases where 
the death penalty is an authorized punishment). 
Complaints of Wrongs under Article 138. Article 138, UCMJ, is a provision for protecting 
members’ rights and for addressing grievances. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces who believe 
they have been wronged by their commanding officer may seek redress with the commanding 
officer informally, and then with a superior authority if their request is denied. A properly filed 
Article 138 complaint ultimately ends with review and action by the general court-martial 
convening authority with jurisdiction over the commanding officer whose actions are the subject 
of the complaint. However, not all grievances are appropriate for redress through an Article 138 
complaint. Any adverse event that has its own procedures for appeal and redress normally cannot 
be made the subject of an Article 138 complaint. For instance, a conviction at court-martial, Article 
15 nonjudicial punishment, or poor enlisted evaluation report, all have their own processes for 
appeal. An Article 138 complaint about the outcome of such an event is not eligible for review. 
Absent unusual circumstances, the member must apply for redress within 90 calendar days of the 
discovery of the wrong complained of, and the complaint should contain all available supporting 
evidence. AFI 51-505, Complaints of Wrongs Under Article 138, Uniform Code of Military 
Justice, contains detailed guidance of the substantive and procedural requirements for filing an 
Article 138 complaint. Airmen considering this action may consult their servicing Area Defense 
Counsel for advice and should ensure that they comply strictly with the requirements of AFI 51-
505. 
Compulsory Self-incrimination Prohibited. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
states that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against him or herself. Similarly, Article 
31, UCMJ, reflects this right and prohibits involuntary statements from being used against an 
accused. A statement is “involuntary” when obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment, Article 
31, or through the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement. The UCMJ 
requires that prior to interrogation or any requests for a statement from a person suspected of an 
offense, the person must be first told of the nature of the accusation, advised that he or she does 
not have to make any statement regarding the offense, and that any statement he or she makes may 
be used as evidence against him or her in a trial by court-martial. Prior to interrogation, the suspect 
is entitled to consult with military defense counsel and to have such counsel present at the 
questioning. If counsel is requested, questioning must cease until counsel is present. Once properly 
advised of his or her rights, a person may waive these rights and choose to make a statement. 
Assuming this waiver is made freely, knowingly, and intelligently, any subsequent statement can 
be used as evidence in a court-martial or other judicial or administrative proceedings. 
Right to Counsel. The UCMJ provides an accused the right to be represented by a military defense 
counsel at general courts-martial, special courts-martial, and any Article 32 preliminary hearing. 
Although the UCMJ does not grant an accused the right to counsel at summary courts-martial, or 
when facing nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, the USAF generally provides military 
defense counsel in these forums as a matter of policy. The Area Defense Counsel provides USAF 
members independent legal representation. All Area Defense Counsel are judge advocates who 
are graduates of an accredited law school, members of the bar of a federal court or highest court 
of a State and who are certified to perform defense duties by The Judge Advocate General of the 
Air Force. Airmen suspected of an offense or facing adverse administrative actions receive free, 
confidential legal advice from an experienced judge advocate outside the local chain of command, 
which guards against conflicts of interest or command influence. Although located at most major 
bases, Area Defense Counsel work for a separate chain of command and report directly to senior 
defense attorneys. The Area Defense Counsel does not report to anyone at base level, including 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
403 
 
 
 
the wing commander or the base Staff Judge Advocate. This separate chain of command ensures 
undivided loyalty to the client.

21.6.  Law Enforcement Duties 
All Airmen should be familiar with the rules for apprehending, arresting, and confining violators 
of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). 
Apprehension. Apprehension is the act of taking a person into custody and the equivalent of a 
civilian arrest. An apprehension is made by clearly notifying the person, orally or in writing, that 
he or she is in custody. The simple statement, “You are under apprehension,” is usually sufficient 
to provide notice. During apprehension, such force and means as are reasonably necessary under 
the circumstances to affect the apprehension, are authorized. Military law enforcement officers, 
military criminal investigators, and persons on guard or performing police duties, are authorized 
to apprehend persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction. Although all commissioned, warrant, petty, 
and enlisted members on RegAF status may apprehend persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction, 
absent exigent (urgent or necessary) circumstances, the apprehension of civilians should be done 
by law enforcement personnel. Enlisted members not otherwise performing law enforcement 
duties may apprehend commissioned or warrant officers only on specific orders from a 
commissioned officer or when such apprehension prevents disgrace to the service or to prevent the 
commission of a serious offense or escape of someone who has committed a serious offense. The 
immediate commander of an apprehended person should be promptly notified. 
Pretrial Restraint. Pretrial restraint is moral or physical restraint on a person’s liberty that is 
imposed before and during the disposition of offenses. Pretrial restraint may only be ordered if 
there is a reasonable belief that the person committed an offense triable by court-martial, and if 
the circumstances require restraint. Factors to consider in ordering pretrial restraint include 
whether one can foresee that the person will not appear at trial or will engage in serious criminal 
misconduct while awaiting court-martial. Pretrial restraint should not be more rigorous than the 
circumstances require. Only an officer’s commander can order pretrial restraint of an officer; this 
authority cannot be delegated. Any commissioned officer may order pretrial restraint of any 
enlisted person. An enlisted person’s commander may also delegate such restraint authority to an 
enlisted member. Pretrial restraint may include conditions on liberty, restrictions in lieu of arrest, 
arrest, or confinement, as briefly described here. 
Conditions on Liberty. Conditions on liberty as a pretrial restraint are imposed by directing 
a person to do or refrain from doing specified acts. Examples include orders to report 
periodically to a specified official, orders to stay away from a certain place (such as the scene 
of the alleged offense), and orders not to associate with specified persons (such as the alleged 
victim or potential witnesses). Conditions on liberty must not hinder pretrial preparation. 
Restrictions in Lieu of Arrest. Restrictions in lieu of arrest are imposed as the restraint of a 
person by oral or written orders directing the person to remain within specified limits, but to a 
less severe level than arrest. The geographic limits are usually broader (for example, restriction 
to the limits of the installation). During restrictions in lieu of arrest, the alleged offender will 
perform full military duties, unless otherwise directed. 
Arrest. In the U.S. Armed Forces, the term “arrest” means the limiting of a person’s liberty. 
Arrest as a pretrial restraint is not imposed as punishment for an offense, but it does direct a 
person to remain within specified limits. Arrest is a moral restraint; no physical restraint is 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
405 
 
 
 
exercised to prevent a person from breaking arrest. A person in arrest is not expected to perform 
full military duties. 
Confinement. Confinement is the pretrial, physical restraint imposed by order of competent 
authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition of charges. No person may be ordered 
into pretrial confinement except for upon probable cause. Probable cause to order pretrial 
confinement exists when there is reasonable belief that: (1) an offense triable by court-martial has 
been committed, (2) the person confined committed it, and (3) confinement is required by the 
circumstances. Each person confined shall promptly be informed of: (1) the nature of the offenses 
for which held, (2) the right to remain silent and that any statement made by the person may be 
used against the person, (3) the right to retain civilian counsel at no expense to the United States 
and the right to request assignment of military counsel, and (4) the procedures by which pretrial 
confinement will be reviewed. 
21.7. Search and Seizure 
The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and 
seizures. The authorization to search must be based on probable cause, particularly describe the 
place to be searched, and describe the persons or things to be seized. Probable cause to search 
exists when there is a reasonable belief that the person, property, or evidence sought is located in 
the place or on the person to be searched. “Authorization to search” is the military equivalent of a 
civilian search warrant. A search authorization is an express permission, written or oral, issued by 
a competent military authority to search a person or an area for specified property or evidence, or 
to search for a specific person and to seize such property, evidence, or person. 
Commanders, military judges, and magistrates may be authorized to direct inspections of persons 
and property under their command authority and to authorize probable cause searches and seizures 
over anyone subject to military law or at any place on an installation. A commander who authorizes 
a search or seizure must be neutral and detached from the case and facts. Therefore, the command 
functions of gathering facts and maintaining overall military discipline must remain separate from 
the legal decision to grant search authorization. 
21.8. Inspections 
An inspection is of a person, property, or premises for the primary purpose of determining and 
ensuring the security, military fitness, or good order and discipline of a unit, organization, or 
installation. Commanders may conduct inspections of their units. Inspections are not searches. The 
distinction between a search and an inspection is that an inspection is not conducted for the primary 
purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a trial or other disciplinary proceedings and does not focus 
on a particular suspect or individual. Contraband seized during an inspection (for example, vehicle 
entry checks and random drug testing) is admissible in court.

21.9. Administrative Procedures 
Nonjudicial punishment is authorized under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). 
Often referred to as an Article 15, nonjudicial punishment provides commanders with an essential 
and prompt means of maintaining good order and discipline and promotes positive behavior 
changes in service members without the stigma of a court-martial conviction. Any USAF member 
can be punished by Article 15. Generally, nonjudicial punishment should be reserved for “minor 
offenses” under the UCMJ. Commanders are encouraged, but not required, to offer counseling and 
administrative reprimands before resorting to the Article 15 process. 
Minor Offense. Whether or not an offense is minor depends on several factors and is a matter left 
to the imposing commander’s discretion. Besides the nature of the offense, the commander should 
also consider the alleged offender’s age, grade, duty assignments, record, experience, and the 
maximum sentence imposable for the offense if tried by a general court-martial. Ordinarily, a 
minor offense is an offense for which the maximum sentence authorized would not include a 
dishonorable discharge or confinement for more than one year if tried by a general court-martial. 
Procedures. Commanders must confer with the Staff Judge Advocate, or a designee, before 
initiating nonjudicial punishment proceedings and before imposing punishment. The Staff Judge 
Advocate advises and helps the commander evaluate the facts and determine whether and what 
offense was committed. Unlike administrative actions, nonjudicial punishment actions may only 
allege violations of a punitive article of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The standard of 
proof that commanders must apply in determining guilt is preponderance of the evidence. This 
means that a commander must determine, based on the evidence considered, that it is more likely 
than not that the member committed the alleged offense. Superior commanders serving as appeal 
authority must apply the same standard. 
Record of Nonjudicial Punishment. If the commander does determine that nonjudicial 
punishment is appropriate, the Staff Judge Advocate or military justice section of the base legal 
office prepares the appropriate documentation: 
AF Form 3070A, Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings (AB thru SSgt) 
AF Form 3070B, Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings (TSgt thru CMSgt) 
AF Form 3070C, Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings (Officer) 
The commander notifies the member that he or she is considering punishment under Article 15 by 
signing the appropriate AF Form 3070 and providing it to the member. The form includes a 
statement of the alleged offense(s), the member’s rights, and the maximum punishment allowable. 
After receiving the form, the member has a right to examine all statements and evidence available 
to the commander and is not required to accept or reject nonjudicial punishment sooner than 72 
hours following notification. The initiating commander may, upon written application, grant an 
extension for good cause. Acceptance of nonjudicial punishment by a member is a choice of forum, 
not an acceptance of guilt. An Airman who is served nonjudicial punishment has the right to “turn 
down” the nonjudicial punishment and demand trial by court-martial for the offense(s) he or she 
is accused of. Additionally, the member has a right to consult an Area Defense Counsel before 
making any decisions, and an Area Defense Counsel, or civilian attorney provided at the member’s 
own expense, may assist the member throughout the nonjudicial punishment proceedings. If a 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
407 
 
 
 
member does accept the nonjudicial punishment forum, he or she has the right to present matters 
in defense, extenuation, or mitigation to the commander on his or her own behalf and make a 
personal appearance before the commander, except in extraordinary circumstances or when the 
commander is unavailable. 
21.10. Punishments Under Article 15 
If the commander finds the member committed an offense, he or she will determine the appropriate 
punishment, serve his or her decision upon the member, and notify the member of the right to 
appeal. Punishments may include reduction in grade, forfeiture of pay, restrictions, extra duties, 
and correctional custody. The type and permissible extent of punishment are limited by the 
imposing commander’s grade and the alleged offender’s grade. Table 21.1. is provided here as a 
generalized reference; however, for detailed, specific information regarding punishments under 
Article 15, refer to AFI 36-2502 and DAFI 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment.

Table 21.1. Permissible Nonjudicial Punishments on Enlisted Members (Notes 1, 2, 3, and 4) 
Member’s Right to Appeal. Members are entitled to appeal nonjudicial punishment to the next 
superior authority in the commander’s chain of command. The member may appeal when he or 
she considers the punishment to be unjust or disproportionate to the offense. A member may assert 
the punishment was unjust because the offense was not committed. Thus, the guilty finding, the 
punishment, or both, may be appealed. The member has five calendar days to submit a written 
appeal—an oral statement is not acceptable. Punishments are not stayed (suspended or halted) 
during the appeal process; however, if the commander or appellate authority fail to take action on 
an appeal within five days after submission, and if the member so requests, any unexecuted 
punishment involving restraint or extra duties will be delayed until after appeal. The appellate 
authority may deny all relief, grant partial relief, or grant all relief requested by the member. The 
appellate authority’s decision is final. 
21.11. Suspension, Remission, Mitigation, and Set-Aside Actions 
A commander has the power to suspend, remit, mitigate, or set aside punishment of an Article 15. 
Suspension. To suspend punishment is to postpone application of all or part of a specific 
probationary period with the understanding that the punishment will be automatically remitted 
(canceled) at the end of this period if the member does not engage in further misconduct. The 
probationary period may not exceed six months. Suspension may occur when the commander 
imposes the punishment or within four months of executing the punishment. USAF policy 
encourages the use of suspended sentences as a corrective tool for first-time offenders to provide 
an observation period and an incentive for good behavior. 
Remission. Remission is an action whereby any portion of the unexecuted punishment is canceled, 
normally used as a reward for good behavior or when determined the punishment imposed was too 
severe for the particular offense. 
Mitigation. Mitigation is a reduction in either the quantity or quality of a punishment. 
Commanders may, at any time, mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted portion of the 
punishment by changing to a less severe form or reducing the quantity. For example, a reduction 
in grade can be mitigated to a forfeiture of pay. 
Set Aside. Setting aside is an action whereby the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, is 
set aside and any property, privilege, or rights affected by the portion of the punishment set aside 
are restored. Commanders use this action only when they believe, under all the circumstances of 
the case, the punishment has resulted in clear injustice. 
Notes: 
 
See Manual for Courts-Martial, part V, paragraph 5d, for further limitations on combinations of 
punishments. 
CMSgt or SMSgt may be reduced one grade only by MAJCOM commanders, commanders of unified or

21.12. Uniform Code of Military Justice Punitive Articles 
Punitive articles consist of Articles 77 through 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 
violations of which are punishable by court-martial. The punitive articles are written to include 
certain verbiage to provide clarification regarding the text of the article (brief description of the 
offense), elements of the offense, explanation, lesser included offenses, maximum punishment, 
and sample specifications regarding the punishable offense. For full descriptions of punitive 
articles, maximum punishments regarding applicable discharge, forfeiture of pay and allowances, 
confinement; and specifications regarding the circumstances, refer to Manual for Courts-Martial 
(MCM), Part IV, Punitive Articles. Note: Article 134 is designed to address unspecified offenses, 
termed “disorders and neglects,” that are punishable because they either prejudice good order and 
discipline or otherwise discredit the armed forces in the view of society. Article 134 also provides 
elements and definitions for certain military-specific offenses not addressed elsewhere in the 
punitive articles of the UCMJ. 
21.13. Types of Courts-Martial 
Congress established three levels of courts-martial: General (GCM), Special (SPCM) and 
Summary (SCM). The levels differ according to the limitations upon punishment that can be 
imposed by each. The three types are described here. 
Summary Court-Martial. Summary courts-martial have jurisdiction to try enlisted members 
subject to the UCMJ accused of any noncapital offense made punishable by the UCMJ. No person 
with respect to whom summary courts-martial have jurisdiction may be brought to trial before a 
summary court-martial if he or she objects. If objection to trial by summary court-martial is made, 
trial may be ordered by special or general court-martial, as appropriate. Summary courts-martial 
may, under such limitations as the U.S. President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not 
forbidden by the UCMJ except death, dismissal, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, 
confinement for more than one month, hard-labor without confinement for more than 45 days, 
restriction to specified limits for more than two months, or forfeiture of more than two-thirds of 
one month’s pay. A summary court-martial consists of one commissioned officer and is a non- 
criminal forum. A finding of guilty at a summary court-martial does not constitute a criminal 
conviction. 
Special Court-Martial. Special courts-martial have jurisdiction to try members subject to the 
UCMJ for any noncapital offense made punishable by the UCMJ, and under such regulations as 
the U.S. President may prescribe, for capital offenses. Special courts-martial may, under such 
limitations as the President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by the UCMJ 
except death, dishonorable discharge, dismissal, confinement for more than one year, hard labor 
without confinement for more than three months, forfeiture of pay exceeding two-thirds pay per 
month, or forfeiture of pay for more than one year. A special court-martial may consist of a military 
judge with a panel of four members (plus alternate members if authorized by the convening 
authority), a military judge alone, or in some cases, with the consent of the parties involved, a 
military magistrate. 
A subset of Special Court-Martial is the Judge-Alone Special Court-Martial. If charges are 
referred to a judge-alone special court-martial, the maximum punishments of a traditional special 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
410 
 
 
 
court-martial are further limited to confinement of no more than six months and forfeitures of pay 
of no more than six months. If charges are referred to a judge-alone special court-martial, the 
maximum punishments of a traditional special court-martial are further limited to confinement of 
no more than six months and forfeitures of pay of no more than six months. Further, a punitive 
discharge may not be imposed. 
General Court-Martial. General courts-martial have jurisdiction to try persons subject to the 
UCMJ for any offense made punishable by the UCMJ and may, under such limitations as the U.S. 
President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by the UCMJ, including the 
penalty of death when specifically authorized by the UCMJ. General courts-martial also have 
jurisdiction to try any person who, by the law of war, is subject to trial by a military tribunal, and 
may adjudge any punishment permitted by the law of war. However, in certain circumstances, 
general courts-martial shall not have jurisdiction to try any person for any offense for which the 
death penalty may be adjudged unless the case has been previously referred to trial as a noncapital 
case. A general court-martial may consist of a military judge with a panel of eight or more 
members, a military judge alone, or in capital cases, a military judge with a panel of twelve 
members. 
21.14. Determining Court-Martial Jurisdiction 
Courts-martial jurisdiction is concerned with two questions: 
Personal jurisdiction (Is the accused a person subject to the UCMJ?) 
Subject-matter jurisdiction (Is the conduct prohibited by the UCMJ?) 
If the answer is “yes” in both instances, then and only then does a court-martial have jurisdiction 
to decide the case. 
Personal Jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction involves status, that is, the accused must possess the 
legal status of a service member or a person otherwise subject to the UCMJ before personal 
jurisdiction can attach. Article 2, UCMJ, includes the following as persons subject to court-martial 
jurisdiction: (1) members of a Regular Component of the U.S. Armed Forces, including those 
awaiting discharge after expiration of their terms of enlistment; (2) cadets, aviation cadets, and 
midshipmen; (3) while on inactive duty training, members of a Reserve Component and members 
of the Air National Guard, but only when in Federal service; (4) retired members of a Regular 
Component of the U.S. Armed Forces who are entitled to pay; (5) retired members of a Reserve 
Component who are receiving hospitalization from an armed force; (6) members of the Fleet 
Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve; (7) persons in custody of the U.S. Armed Forces serving 
a sentence imposed by a court-martial; (8) members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, Public Health Service, and other organizations, when assigned to and serving with 
the Armed Forces; (9) prisoners of war in custody of the Armed Forces; (10) in time of declared 
war or contingency operation, persons serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field; 
(11) subject to any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may be a party or to any 
accepted rule of international law, persons serving with, employed by, or accompanying the U.S. 
Armed Forces outside the United States and outside the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, 
and the Virgin Islands; (12) subject to any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may 
be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, persons within an area leased by or otherwise 
reserved or acquired for the use of the United States which is under the control of the Secretary 
concerned and which is outside the United States and outside the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
Guam and the Virgin Islands; (13) individuals belonging to one of the eight categories enumerated 
in Article 4 of the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, done at Geneva 
August 12, 1949, who violate the law of war. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
411 
 
 
 
Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. Courts-martial have the power to try any offense under the UCMJ 
except when prohibited from doing so by the U.S. Constitution. Courts-martial have exclusive 
jurisdiction when a purely military offense, such as desertion, failure to obey orders, or disrespect 
toward superiors, is involved. However, if the offense violates both the UCMJ and a civilian code, 
concurrent jurisdiction may exist. For example, if a RegAF military member is caught shoplifting 
at an off-base merchant, the member can be tried by court-martial for larceny in violation of Article 
121, UCMJ, and tried by a civilian court for a larceny offense recognized in the local jurisdiction. 
The determination as to whether a military or a civilian authority will try the member is normally 
made through consultation or prior agreement between appropriate military authorities (ordinarily 
the Staff Judge Advocate) and appropriate civilian authorities. A member to be tried by both a 
court-martial and a state court for the same act is constitutionally permissible; however, a member 
who has been tried by a state court normally will not be tried by court-martial for the same act. 
Only SecAF may approve such prosecutions, and only in the most unusual cases when the ends 
of justice and discipline can be met in no other way. 
21.15. Trial 
When a case is referred to trial, the convening authority, generally the wing or Numbered Air Force 
commander, details members in his or her opinion, who are the best qualified for the duty by reason 
of age, education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament. No members 
are eligible to serve as a member of a general or special court-martial when they are the accuser or 
witness for the prosecution or have acted as an investigating officer, preliminary hearing officer, 
or as counsel in the same case. When it can be avoided, no panel member should be junior in rank 
or grade to the accused. Throughout the court-martial process, commanders, convening authorities 
and all other persons subject to the UCMJ are expressly forbidden to exercise any improper 
influence on the action of the court. 
Trial Counsel. Trial counsels are similar to prosecutors in civilian criminal trials. They represent 
the government, and their objective is justice, not merely securing a conviction. Trial counsel 
present evidence they believe is admissible and seek to persuade the court that the accused 
committed the alleged offenses. Trial counsel argues the inferences most strongly supporting the 
charges. Trial counsel also presents evidence and arguments to address defenses raised on behalf 
of the accused. Trial counsel may not ethically permit the continuance of the cause of action against 
the accused knowing the charges are not supported by probable cause. Additionally, trial counsel 
has an affirmative duty to disclose to the defense any evidence that negates the accused’s guilt, 
mitigates the degree of guilt, or reasonably tends to reduce the punishment of the accused. 
Defense Counsel. Military defense counsel is similar to defense attorneys in civilian criminal 
trials. In a trial by court-martial, the accused may be represented by military defense counsel, free 
of charge. The accused may also hire a civilian lawyer at his or her own expense. An accused may 
request representation by a particular military lawyer, and if that lawyer is reasonably available, 
he or she will be detailed to represent the accused. Defense counsel will, within the bounds of the 
law, zealously represent the accused. 
Office of Special Trial Counsel (OSTC). Provides expert, specialized, independent, and ethical 
representation of the United States, under the direct civilian control of the SecAF, in the 
investigation and trial-level litigation of covered offenses, as prescribed by Article 1(17), UCMJ, 
and other offenses over which the office exercises authority pursuant to Article 24a, UCMJ. 
OSTC reports directly to SecAF with no intervening authority. 
Military Judge. A military trial judge presides over each open session of the court-martial. 
Military trial judges are selected from highly qualified, experienced judge advocates. The military 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
412 
 
 
 
judge of a court-martial may not consult with members of the court except in the presence of the 
accused, trial counsel, and defense counsel, nor does he or she vote with the members of the court. 
Victims’ Counsel. In addition to the brief description of the Victims’ Counsel (VC) regarding the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program, the USAF Judge Advocate General Corps 
created the VC pilot program in 2013. Since then, it has expanded to include 101 world-wide 
personnel with an independent chain of command. The VC’s primary responsibility is to his or her 
client and the VC is bound by professional ethical responsibilities to him or her. VCs provide 
independent legal representation, which might include opposing the government of the United 
States to promote the individual interests of their clients without regard to how their actions might 
otherwise affect the USAF as an institution. An VC’s legal representation includes advocacy to 
relevant entities within the USAF, representation in courts-martial proceedings, post-trial and 
appellate review, and advocacy or assistance regarding related matters outside the military justice 
process. 
Findings and Sentence. The verdict of a court-martial is called the findings. An accused cannot 
be found guilty unless guilt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. A finding of guilty does not 
require a unanimous agreement but requires at least three-fourths of the members to vote for a 
finding of guilty. Voting is by secret written ballot. In the event of a not-guilty verdict (acquittal), 
the trial ends. If there is a finding of guilty, a pre-sentencing procedure follows immediately to 
help the court determine an appropriate sentence. A sentence of death requires a unanimous vote 
by panel members on both the findings of guilt and the propriety of death as punishment. 
21.16. Appellate Review 
After a sentence is announced in a court-martial, the accused may submit matters to the convening 
authority for consideration in the exercise of the convening authority’s powers. Once the 
convening authority takes action, the military judge of a general or special court-martial shall enter 
into the record of trial the judgment of the court. The judgment reflects the result of the court- 
martial, as modified by any post-trial actions, rulings, or orders. The entry of judgment terminates 
the trial proceedings and initiates the appellate process. 
The Judge Advocate General. The Judge Advocate General is the review authority in general 
court-martial cases where the sentence does not include death, dismissal, punitive discharge, or 
confinement for one year or more. The Judge Advocate General may also elect to certify (refer) a 
case to the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. The Judge Advocate General instructs convening 
authorities to take action according to the court’s decisions. 
Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is the first level 
of formal appellate review. It is an independent appellate judicial body of at least three military 
appellate judges appointed by the Judge Advocate General. Each judge must be a member of a bar 
of a federal court or of the highest court of a state and must be certified by the Judge Advocate 
General as qualified by reason of education, training, experience, and judicial temperament, for 
duty as an appellate military judge. The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals reviews cases for 
legal error and for factual sufficiency when an issue of factual sufficiency is raised by the appellant. 
Unless appellate review is waived by an appellant, the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals 
automatically reviews all cases involving a sentence that includes death, dismissal of a 
commissioned officer, a punitive discharge, or confinement of two years or more. Additionally, 
the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals reviews timely appeals submitted by an accused for 
sentences to confinement greater than six months. In this forum, the appellant is provided a military 
counsel (free of charge) who is an experienced trial advocate and a full-time appellate counsel. 
Civilian appellate counsel may be retained at the appellant’s own expense. The government is 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
413 
 
 
 
represented by appellate government counsel. If the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals rules 
against the appellant, he or she may request review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed 
Forces. Note: Appellate review cannot be waived in death penalty cases. 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces 
is composed of five civilian judges appointed by the President. It is the highest appellate court in 
the military justice system. The court reviews all cases in which the death sentence was imposed, 
and cases previously reviewed by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals forwarded on the Judge 
Advocate General’s order. Review in other cases is discretionary upon petition of the appellant 
and upon good cause shown. Air Force appellate defense counsel is appointed to represent the 
appellant before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. If an appellant’s case is reviewed 
and relief is not granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the appellant may 
petition the U.S. Supreme Court for further review. 
U.S. Supreme Court. Decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may be 
reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The accused may petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ 
of certiorari (request for the lower court to send up all documents in a case for review) without 
prepayment of fees and costs or security, and without filing the affidavit. 
Finality of Proceedings, Findings, and Sentences. The appellate review of records of trial 
provided by the UCMJ; the proceedings, findings, and sentences of courts-martial as approved, 
reviewed, or affirmed as required by the UCMJ; and all dismissals and discharges carried into 
execution under sentences by courts-martial following approval, review, or affirmation as required 
by the UCMJ, are final and conclusive. The judgment of a court-martial, orders publishing the 
proceedings of courts-martial, and all action taken pursuant to those proceedings, are binding upon 
all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of the United States, subject only to action upon a 
petition for a new trial under Article 73, to action by the Secretary concerned as provided in Article 
74, and the authority of the U.S. President.

22.1. DAFMAN 36-2905, Air Force Physical Fitness Program 
According to AFI 1-1, USAF members must be physically fit to support the USAF mission. An 
active lifestyle increases productivity, optimizes health, and decreases absenteeism, which helps 
maintain a higher level of readiness. Health and readiness benefits increase as body composition 
improves and physical activity and fitness levels increase. Members are encouraged to optimize 
their readiness status by improving their overall fitness. The goal of the Physical Fitness Program 
(PFP) is to motivate all Airmen to participate in a year-round physical conditioning program that 
emphasizes total fitness, to include proper aerobic conditioning, muscular fitness training, and 
healthy eating. Note: Refer to the latest version of DAFMAN 36-2905 for the most current fitness 
standards. This guidance is applicable to the entire Department of the Air Force, including 
uniformed members of the RegAF, the Air Force Reserve, the Air National Guard, and the United

assessment. Notifies UFPM upon receiving an AF Form 469 from healthcare provider with fitness 
restrictions and or fitness assessment exemptions in accordance with AFI 48-133. Then provides 
a copy of AF Form 469 to FAC staff, augmentee, or PTL prior to taking assessment. Submits any 
updates via FSQ, prior to completing an assessment. ARC Airmen will ensure they are in a 
qualified duty status for assessments. For safety, Airmen must understand and comply with the 
guidelines contained in AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management, regarding the use of weight 
control drugs and surgery. 
 
22.3. Body Composition Program 
Effective  January 2023, in accordance with DoDI 1308.03, DoD Physical Fitness/Body 
Composition Program, which mandates military services establish body composition 
requirements for servicemembers to ensure physical readiness, the Air Force will implement a 
new Body Composition Program (BCP) replacing the abdominal circumference measurement 
removed from the Physical Fitness Assessments in December 2020. The BCP requires Air Force 
military members to complete an annual Body Composition Assessment (BCA) within their birth 
month and uses the Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) to calculate body composition by dividing 
waist circumference by height. 
Implementation of the BCP for the Air Force started on 1 April 2023, with a one-year adaptation 
period. Administrative actions are not authorized based solely on the results of BCAs assessed in 
the adaptation period. This period was extended on 8 April 2024 and remains in effect until 180 
days after the publication of AFMAN 36-2912, Air Force Body Composition Program. During 
this time, administrative actions based solely on BCA results are not authorized.  
22.4. BCA Assessment. The initial recorded BCA is considered a “baseline assessment.” 
Continual evaluation is conducted of the BCP during the adaptation period. The assessment 
implemented provides a military standard for body composition and an associated health risk to 
meet Air Force service requirements: 
Meeting Standard (Low-Moderate Risk): (WHtR < 0.55) 
Not Meeting Standard (High Risk): (WHtR > 0.55) 
22.5.  BCA Roles & Responsibilities Snapshot 
The BCP is a unit commander driven program. Units will adhere to the following policy guidance 
published on 5 January 2023 when administering the BCP: 
Commanders or equivalents. Commanders or equivalents will execute, enforce, and ensure 
administration of BCA across the unit by providing safe facilities and equipment, necessary 
resources, and funding to support the BCP. Identify male and female Body Composition 
Managers (BCM) within units to administer BCAs and manage the IT system platform 
(myBodyComp) for their unit/PAS Code. Units must have at least one of each sex; there is no 
grade requirement. Purchase required equipment (e.g., non-stretch tape measure in inches). Enroll 
Airmen initially identified during the adaptation period with a WHtR of > 0.55 into a 12-month 
required informal self-directed Body Composition Improvement Program (BCIP) using the DAF 
Form 108, Department of the Air Force Fitness Education and Intervention Processing, until 
publication of the new DAF Form 113, Department of the Air Force Body Composition 
Assessment Scorecard and Intervention Worksheet. 
Enrollment in the informal self-directed BCIP is not considered a failure to meet the BCP 
standard. Commanders will not take administrative actions during the informal self-directed 
BCIP. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
419 
 
 
 
Commanders or equivalents will encourage compliance with the body composition improvement 
plan developed by Airmen and reassess WHtR after completing the informal self-directed BCIP. 
Enroll Airmen in a formal self-directed BCIP after subsequent failures to achieve BCP standards 
using the DAF Form 108 until publication of the new DAF Form 113. 
Enrollment in the formal self-directed BCIP is considered the first failure to meet the BCP 
standard. Reassessments will be conducted during the next birth month or 12 months from the 
last BCA. 
When no medical condition exists that would preclude Airmen from meeting the BCP standard, 
commanders or equivalents will consider administrative actions to include separation for repeated 
failures. 
Body Composition Managers (BCM). BCMs will attend mandatory training before executing 
duties as required by the BCP. Training dates are forthcoming via MyPers messaging. Administer 
BCAs within the unit and only assess members of the same sex. BCMs will utilize members’ sex 
reflected in Military Personnel Data System for BCAs. Input WHtR results into myBodyComp to 
include exemptions. Communicate program requirements (e.g., body composition improvement 
plan) for Airmen enrolled in informal and formal self-directed BCIP and assist members using the 
DAF Form 108 until publication of the new DAF Form 113. Provide unit BCP metrics and reports 
available in the myBodyComp platform to the unit commander upon request. Inform the unit 
commander of Airmen who do not meet program requirements (i.e., overdue BCA, not meeting 
BCP standards, non-compliance with program requirements). 
Airmen. Airmen will assess annually within their birth month or 12 months (out-of-cycle 
assessment). To ensure decoupling of the PFA and to allow for mission and personal flexibility, 
members may opt to accomplish their BCA one calendar month before their birth month or 
reassessment date. BCAs will not be taken when a member is provided a deployment, commander, 
or ARC non-participating exemption. Members are required to accomplish a BCA within two 
months after the exemption expiration. Note: all members will have a BCA taken when on a 
medical restriction unless a profile (AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report) indicates a 
BCA exemption. 
Airmen will complete the following if identified with a WHtR of > 0.55: 
Enroll in the 12-month informal self-directed BCIP and reassess WHtR upon completion. 
Schedule a medical evaluation and assessment for risk factors with their Medical Treatment 
Facility. ARC members will schedule a medical records review with the Reserve Medical 
Unit/Guard Medical Unit. Review the Health and Readiness Optimization (HeRO) Body 
Composition Guide, which provides information and resources on achieving a healthy body 
composition. Develop a body composition improvement action plan that outlines the strategy, 
resources, and counseling options the member will use and submit it to the BCM and unit 
commander. 
Airmen will complete the following if identified as not meeting standards (WHtR > 0.55) after 
completion of the informal self-directed program: 
Enroll in the formal self-directed BCIP. Review, continue, and/or adjust body composition 
improvement plan utilizing resources to achieve the BCP standard (e.g., Medical, HeRO 
Guide, local helping agencies). Reassess WHtR during the next birth month or 12 months from 
the last BCA (out-of-cycle assessment). Re-enroll in formal self-directed BCIP if identified as 
failing to meet standard after subsequently meeting standard.

22.6. Fitness Assessment Procedures 
Adequate physical fitness levels ensure every Airman can properly support the USAF mission 
while performing at optimal capacity. All components of the fitness assessment must be completed 
within a three-hour window on the same day. If FAC staff or augmentees determine extenuating 
circumstances prevent completion of the test, for example, rapidly changing or severe weather 
conditions, natural disasters, emergencies, or safety issues, then all components must be rescheduled 
and completed at the earliest opportunity. The body composition component is the first component 
of the fitness assessment. It includes measuring height and weight followed by the muscular 
strength components (1-minute push-ups, or 2-minute hand release push-ups (HRPU)). Next is the 
Core Endurance (1-minute sit-ups, 2-minute cross leg reverse crunch (CLRC), or timed forearm 
plank). Finally, the Cardiorespiratory Fitness is last (1.5-mile run, 20 meter HAMR or the 2 
kilometer walk (if not medically cleared to run). There is a minimum five-minute rest period 
between components. Note: The assessment components should be scheduled to allow adequate 
rest for members on irregular or shift work hours. Also, Reserve members must be in a duty status 
for fitness assessments. ARC Airmen will be required to retest no later than the next Unit Training 
Assembly or Regularly Scheduled Drill when official fitness assessments are being conducted. 
Videotaping of fitness assessments is not allowed, nor should it be used in the appeal process. 
Fitness Screening Questionnaire. A fitness screening questionnaire will be completed in 
myFitness when scheduling prior to the fitness assessment, to provide time for medical evaluation, 
when indicated. Failure to complete the fitness screening questionnaire does not invalidate the 
fitness assessment. Member must inform PFA Administrator if FSQ responses have changed 
between original submission of FSQ and execution of PFA. 
22.7. Fitness Assessment Composite Score 
The composite fitness scores are used to determine the overall fitness assessment score. Aerobic 
fitness is evaluated by a three-component physical fitness assessment consisting of the 1.5-mile 
run (medical alternate 2 km walk) or optional high aerobic multi-shuttle run (20M HAMR), one 
minute push-ups or optional hand release push-ups, and sit-ups or optional cross-leg reverse crunch 
or plank. Airmen receive a composite score on a 0 to 100 scale based on the following maximum 
component scores: 
60 points for aerobic component  
20 points for muscular component  
20 points for sit-up component 
Minimum Scores. The minimum component scores are established to ensure members test 
adequately in all components. Meeting the minimum score in each of the components does not 
constitute the minimum points required to earn a passing fitness assessment score. Scoring the 
minimum component values in all components will not generate enough points to earn a composite 
score of 75 or greater. Age and sex-specific fitness assessment score charts are provided in myFSS. 
Note: When reviewing the charts, make note of both the minimum and maximum requirements 
associated with specific categories to assess progress and tailor training to strive for higher scores 
in each of the components for overall fitness assessment results and personal fitness levels. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
421 
 
 
 
Fitness Assessment Results. There are three fitness assessment levels that can be achieved, as 
well as an exempt category, briefly described here: 
Excellent. To achieve a fitness assessment level of excellent, a composite score at or above 90 
is required. If all three (applicable) components of the fitness assessment were scored at or 
above 90, the individual will retest within 12 months. If fewer than three components of the 
fitness assessment were scored at or above 90, and the individual is not on a chronic profile, 
then the individual will retest within six months. 
Satisfactory. To achieve a fitness assessment level of satisfactory, a composite score of 75-
89.99 is required. The individual will retest within six months. 
Unsatisfactory. To achieve a fitness assessment level of unsatisfactory, a composite score at 
or below 74.9 and/or one or more component minimums was not met. The individual will retest 
within 90 days. 
Component Exemption. An Airman is exempt from one or more components of the fitness 
assessment but will be assessed on remaining components. 
Composite Exemption. An Airman is exempt from all components of the fitness assessment. 
22.8. Documenting Assessment Failures 
Assessment failures will be annotated in myFitness (myFSS) and will be considered against the 
individual. If a member fails their fitness assessment, the commander has the discretion to annotate 
a non-current/failing assessment within the reporting period on the performance evaluation. 
Additionally, it is the commander’s discretion to document the evaluation as a referral for a non- 
current/failing assessment at the evaluation close-out date. Commander responses for fitness 
assessment failures range from verbal counseling to placement on control roster, to administrative 
separation. A more complete list of commander response options for fitness assessment failures is 
provided in DAFMAN 36-2905. 
Deployments. Composite scores represent a health-based fitness level. As the fitness level 
increases, Airmen are able to tolerate extremes in temperature, fatigue, and stress while optimizing 
performance in the deployed environment. Members must have a current fitness score on file prior 
to deployment. Members will not be considered “exempt” in the deployed location until their 
current fitness assessment expires. 
Medical Exemptions and Profiles. Medical providers may recommend temporary or permanent 
medical exemptions for medical conditions preventing an Airman from safely participating in 
specific physical conditioning programs or in a component of the fitness assessment. The 
commander, in consultation with the fitness program manager, and upon medical provider 
recommendation, may grant members exemption from aerobic and muscle fitness components for 
a limited period of time. Exemptions for medical reasons are entered into myFSS using the 
individual’s current AF Form 469, following assessment completion. Airmen with a medical 
profile prohibiting them from performing one or more of the components of the fitness assessment 
will still be tested on the components not specifically exempted. For additional details on fitness 
assessments, refer to DAFMAN 36-2905. 
22.9. Fitness Assessment Components – Explained 
To assess total fitness, the fitness assessment components include muscular fitness (to include 
push-ups and sit-ups), and aerobic fitness. 
Muscular Fitness. Muscular fitness includes both muscular strength and muscular endurance. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
422 
 
 
 
Muscular strength is the maximum force generated by a specific muscle or muscle group. Muscular 
endurance is the ability of a muscle group to execute repeated contractions over a period of 
sufficient time to cause muscular fatigue. Muscular fitness helps with metabolism, strengthens 
connective tissue, increases bond density, helps facilitate recovery from physical activity, helps 
prevent injury, may increase cardiorespiratory fitness, and may improve mood and self-image. 
Muscular fitness resistance training includes performing calisthenics; plyometrics; field exercises; 
and weight/object training, such as machines, free weights, medicine balls, kettle bells, bands, 
cables, and ropes. Movement patterns can include running, bending, twisting, squatting, pulling, 
and pushing. Body regions that can be targeted include core, lower body, upper body, and whole 
body. By incorporating a variety of combinations of muscular fitness resistance training, 
weight/object training, and movement patterns, a wide range of exercises are available for a 
challenging, engaging workout routine. 
Aerobic Fitness. Cardiorespiratory endurance, known as aerobic fitness, is the ability to perform 
large muscle, dynamic, moderate-to-high intensity exercise for prolonged periods. Performance of 
such exercise depends on the functional state of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle 
systems, more simply defined as the ability to produce energy. Many modes of activity meet 
aerobic activity requirements, such as cross-country skiing, running, cycling, swimming, skating, 
rowing, walking, aerobic dance, indoor aerobic exercise machines, and sports that require 
continuous physical exertion. The level of aerobic fitness determines how long and how hard a 
person can exercise. 
Moderately Intense Aerobic Activity. Moderately intense aerobic activity equates to 
continuous exercise that raises heart and respiratory rates, initiates sweating (varies with 
climate), and permits conversation or controlled breathing. Aim for at least 30 minutes a day / 
five days a week. 
Vigorously Intense Aerobic Activity. Vigorously intense aerobic activity elicits higher 
physiological responses and permits light or broken conversation. Aim for at least 20 – 25 
minutes a day / three days a week. 
Intensity Calculations. Intensity, considered the most important variable in training, can be 
measured by the percentage of maximal oxygen consumed or by the percentage of maximal 
heart rate. Various approaches are available for calculating training intensity. USAF fitness 
personnel can help determine calculations to safely achieve individual fitness preferences and 
objectives. The key thing to remember when exercising is to elevate your heart rate to a safe 
level to achieve the desired training effect. Also, adjustments in mode, frequency, duration, 
and intensity may be necessary to reach higher levels of health and fitness. 
22.10.   Additional Fitness Concepts and Principles 
There are several additional fitness principles that should be applied to a fitness routine. Fitness 
routines do not need to be complicated. They can be simplified, tailored to individual needs, and 
designed to address certain concepts to help maximize training efforts and benefits. 
Pre-Workout Warm-up. Warm-ups help increase body temperature and blood flow, and guard 
against muscle, tendon, and ligament strains. Before beginning any vigorous physical activity, 
prepare your body for exercise with a warm-up. A five to seven minute dynamic warm-up increases 
the flow of blood to the muscles and tendons, thus helping reduce the risk of injury and increasing 
the joint’s range of motion, positively affecting the speed of muscular contraction. A recommended 
sequence of dynamic warm-up activities before vigorous exercise is provided here. 
Slowly jog in place or walk to generate a gradual increase in the heart rate, blood pressure, 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
423 
 
 
 
circulation, and temperature of the active muscles. 
Slowly rotate joints to gradually increase their range of motion. 
Slowly mimic the activities to be performed. When warming up for weight lifting, lifting lighter 
weights helps prepare the neuromuscular pathways. 
Post-Workout Cool-down. Cool-downs provide a gradual reduction in activity to prevent blood 
pooling, hasten recovery, and avoid injury. After a workout, take a few minutes to gradually bring 
your body back to its normal resting state by slowly decreasing the intensity of your activity. A 
few examples of how to cool down after a workout are provided here. 
After a run, jog slowly and then walk for one to two minutes. Do this while rehydrating to cool 
down without allowing the blood to pool in the muscles and reducing blood flow to the heart 
and brain. 
Repeat activities similar to those done in the warm-up to help ease muscle tension and soreness. 
Flexibility Training. Flexibility is considered to be the maximum ability to move a joint freely, 
without pain, through a range of motion. Although flexibility is not assessed during the fitness 
assessment, it is an important aspect of overall health and should be part of a well-balanced 
physical activity routine. Two aspects of flexibility are stability and mobility. Stability deals with 
maintaining non-movement functional positions, including postural stability. Mobility deals with 
controlled, functional movement through an active range of motion in the various planes of motion. 
Stretching. Stretching is one form of exercise that takes very little time relative to the benefits 
gained and may be done easily at home or work. Repetitive movements at work or a more sedentary 
job can increase tension in specific muscle groups, which would benefit from mild stretching 
during the course of the day. Stretch when the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and connective tissue 
are warmer (above normal body temperature), and hold stretches for 10 to 30 seconds. Repeat each 
stretch three to four times. Ballistic stretching (bouncing) is not recommended. Also, after a 
workout, the muscles are warm from activity and should not be over-stretched. 
Principle of Specificity. Target specific muscle groups or target areas by doing a simple 
assessment of functional movement. By incorporating specific moves into a strength training 
program, Airmen can improve strength and improve work-related tasks while reducing injuries by 
conditioning muscles needed to perform on the job. An Airman whose job requires lifting objects 
from the ground and moving them to overhead locations has a work-related task that is equivalent 
to the functional movement of a squat and an overhead press with a weight. 
Principle of Regularity. Exercise routinely to produce a training effect. Establishing a routine of 
three workouts per week is best for optimal gains. Airmen should strive for exercising all target 
muscle groups at least twice each week. Some Airmen may maintain a moderate level of strength 
by doing proper strength workouts once a week for a short period of time after a strong baseline 
level of muscular fitness is established. 
Principle of Recovery. Allow at least a 48-hour recovery period between workouts for the same 
muscle groups. A way to do this and maintain an active fitness routine is to train leg muscles with 
weights on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and train upper body muscles on Tuesday, Thursday, 
and Saturday. Also, consider recovery times during a workout. The recovery time between 
different exercises and sets depends, in part, on the intensity of the workout. Normally, the 
recovery time between sets should range from 30 seconds to three minutes. 
Principle of Balance. When developing a strength training program, remember the importance of 
including exercises to work all the major muscle groups – in both the upper and lower body. Also, 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
424 
 
 
 
most muscles are organized into opposing pairs; therefore, activating one muscle results in a 
pulling motion, while activating the opposing muscle results in the opposite or pushing motion. 
When planning a training session, one training technique is to follow a pushing exercise with a 
pulling exercise resulting in movement at the same joints. For example, following an overhead 
press with a lateral pull-down exercise helps ensure good strength balance between opposing 
muscle groups which may, in turn, reduce the risk of injury. 
Principle of Variety. Using different equipment, changing the exercises, and altering the volume 
and intensity of workouts are good ways to add variety, and may also produce better results. 
Periodically substitute different exercises for given muscle groups. Do squats with a barbell instead 
of leg presses on a weight machine. Also, for variety or when workout equipment is limited, switch 
to partner-resisted exercises or another form of resistance training.

Airmen are responsible for being mission ready at all times and must recognize that nutrition plays 
an important role in maintaining good health and performance. Maintaining a healthy energy 
balance is important. Calories from foods and beverages need to be balanced with calories burned 
through metabolism and physical activity to meet individual metabolism and weight goals. 
Estimated calorie needs by age, sex, and physical activity level estimates range from 1,600 to 2,400 
calories per day for adult women and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day for adult men. Within each 
category, the low end of the range is for sedentary individuals and the high end of the range is for 
active individuals. Gradual changes incorporated into a healthy lifestyle are more likely to be 
maintained by following the key dietary guideline recommendations for a healthy eating pattern 
that account for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level. Suggestions for a 
healthy eating pattern include a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy, 
proteins, and healthy fats. While not everyone will develop the same diet and nutrition plans, there 
are several resources available for establishing healthy, active lifestyles. 
Initiating and maintaining behavior change in the domains of nutrition and fitness can be difficult. 
It is helpful to make SMART goals when trying to target these areas (goals that are Specific, 
Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely). Examples of SMART nutrition and fitness goals 
include: 1) I will exercise (bike or jog at a moderate heartrate) for 30 minutes, 5 days a week, for 
one month starting today, and 2) I will reduce my fast food consumption to one (non-supersized) 
meal, one time per week, for two months starting today. Note: Maintaining a healthy weight is a 
key to health and readiness. An imbalance of calorie intake and lack of physical activity are 
primary causes for unintended weight gain and increased potential health risk. Being overweight 
or obese increases the risk of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, 
Type 2 diabetes, arthritis, breathing problems, and some cancers. 
22.12. Food for Fuel 
Snacking and staying hydrated throughout the day can help maintain proper blood sugar levels, 
particularly during a workout. Carbohydrates can be digested relatively quickly and turned to 
energy that can be readily available within 30 to 60 minutes. After a workout, a snack or light meal 
may help replenish carbohydrates burned during exercise and convert them into energy storage 
(glycogen) for later use. Adding protein to a meal or snack helps rebuild muscle fibers worked 
during exercise. Simple healthy snack ideas include low fat yogurt, nuts and dried fruit, string 
cheese, and fruit bars. Note: An optimal composition of a post recovery beverage or snack is a 
four-to-one carbohydrate to protein ratio. This means that for every four grams of carbohydrates 
there should be one gram of protein. As an example, an eight ounce glass of chocolate milk 
contains about 29 grams of carbohydrates and eight grams of protein, which serves as a great post- 
recovery replenishment. 
22.13. Micronutrients 
Micronutrients include vitamins, minerals, trace elements, amino acids, and other essential 
nutrients. They are required in very small amounts for healthy living and are important for our 
bodies to function normally. Eating foods rich in micronutrients, such as whole grains and fresh 
fruits and vegetables, can promote healthy brain, heart, blood, and metabolism functions. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
426 
 
 
 
Micronutrients can also prevent symptoms associated with micronutrient deficiency disorders. 
22.14. Macronutrients 
Macronutrients make up the bulk of the diet, supply energy, and provide many essential nutrients. 
Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source used during exercise. An appropriate 
amount of carbohydrates is important to maintain glycogen stores for energy reserve. 
Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels and supply energy and provide four calories per 
gram. 
Simple Carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels rapidly rather 
than gradually over a longer period of time. Simple carbohydrates are often found in packaged 
or processed foods as table sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, honey, fruit drinks, soft drinks, and 
candy. 
Complex Carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels slowly over 
a longer period of time, providing a more sustainable source of energy than simple 
carbohydrates. Healthy, complex carbohydrates can be found in fruits, breads, cereals, grains, 
milk, and starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas, and squash). An estimated serving size is 
about the size of the palm of your hand. The general recommendation for carbohydrates is 45-
65 percent of total daily caloric intake. 
Fiber. Fiber can be found in oatmeal, oat bran, nuts and seeds, legumes, whole wheat bread, 
barley, brown rice, and in most vegetables and fruits. The average American consumes 12-15 
grams per day, whereas the recommended total fiber intake is 20-35 grams per day to aid in 
digestion and help balance the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. 
Protein. Proteins are used by our bodies for tissue maintenance, replacement, function, and growth 
of our muscles. If our body is not getting enough calories from dietary sources or tissue stores, 
protein may be used for energy. The general recommendation for protein intake is 10-35 percent 
of total calories (0.8-1.2 grams per kilograms of body weight) to meet daily needs. Protein can be 
found in meats, poultry, fish, legumes, tofu, eggs, nuts, seeds, milk, milk products, and grains. 
Individuals should focus on lean meats and low-fat milk products to reduce saturated fats. The 
recommended serving size of meat is the size of a deck of cards and contains about 21 grams of 
protein. Proteins provide four calories per gram. 
Fats. Fats are a major energy source and help our bodies maintain temperature and protect organs 
from trauma. Balanced fat intake is essential to maintain energy reserves. Fats can be found in oils, 
high fat cuts of meat, baked sweets, whole-fat milk and cream, butter, cheeses, nuts and seeds, 
avocados, and fish. The general recommendation for fats is 20-35 percent of total calories. Fats 
provide nine calories per gram. 
Trans Fats. Trans fats have been linked to coronary heart disease. Intake of these fats should be 
kept as low as possible. They can be found in small amounts in the fatty parts of meat and milk 
products and in foods that contain partially hydrogenated oils. Trans fats are typically made from 
vegetable oils through a process called hydrogenation and are found in foods, such as frozen 
pizzas, frozen pies, cookies, margarine spreads, and other processed foods. 
Saturated Fats. Saturated fats have been linked to coronary heart disease. Saturated fats should 
make up less than 10 percent of daily calories. Foods that contain saturated fats are usually solid 
at room temperate and can be found in high-fat cheeses, high-fat cuts of meat, whole-fat milk, 
cream, butter, ice cream, and palm and coconut oils. 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
427 
 
 
 
Unsaturated Fats. Eating unsaturated fat can reduce your risk for heart disease and improve high- 
density lipoprotein (good cholesterol) levels. Unsaturated fats are typically liquid at room 
temperature and include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats typically 
come from plant sources, such as canola oil, olive oil, nuts, seeds, flaxseed, and avocado. 
Unsaturated fats are also present in fish, such as trout, herring, and salmon. 
22.15. Sodium 
Sodium is a necessary element of our diets; however, high sodium intake raises blood pressure 
which is a major risk factor for the nation’s leading cause of death – heart disease. Most diets 
include salt in the form of processed or preserved foods, canned foods, soups, cheeses, and deli 
meats. On average, Americans consume about 3,400 milligrams of sodium every day. The Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults limit sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams per day 
(about one teaspoon of table salt). Certain “at-risk” groups, including those who have high blood 
pressure, diabetes, or kidney disease, should limit their sodium intake to about 1,500 milligrams 
per day. The best way to ensure a low sodium diet is to eat whole foods, such as fresh or frozen 
fruits and vegetables, lean and unprocessed poultry and fish, unsalted nuts, whole grains, and low- 
fat dairy products, such as skim milk or yogurt. 
22.16. Supplements 
Dietary supplements may fall into many categories, such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, 
amino acids, or other substances that are sold as pills, powders, bars, packs, gels, drinks, or shakes. 
Be aware that bodybuilding, performance enhancement, and weight loss products most likely 
contain undeclared ingredients that may be presented as proprietary blends or delivery systems on 
the label. These blends do not specify the amount of each ingredient and increase the risk of 
overdosing on ingredients, such as creatine or caffeine. The Food and Drug Administration does 
not test supplements before they are sold. Look for third party verification/certification labels 
before purchasing supplement products to be sure they have been tested for purity and/or quality. 
Note: Airmen on flying status must consult with their flight surgeon before taking supplements; 
however, all Airmen are encouraged to discuss supplement use with their healthcare provider. 
22.17. Hydration 
The body is made up of about 60 percent water. We need to drink water to maintain the body’s 
fluid balance, transport nutrients, regulate body temperature, digest food, and assist many of the 
body’s other functions. Consumption requirements differ depending on individual needs, physical 
activity, body composition, environmental conditions, and other lifestyle conditions. Generally, a 
total daily water consumption (water, beverages, and food) is 2.7 liters per day for women, and 3.7 
liters per day for men. Dehydration occurs with fluid losses of greater than two percent of body 
weight and increases risk for cognitive and mental performance, heat illness, exhaustion, and 
stroke. Exercise substantially increases fluid loss; therefore, hydration before, during, and after 
intense workouts is critical. Note: Excess fluid can lead to over-hydration, resulting in symptoms, 
such as chills, vomiting, dizziness, disorientation, altered mental status, fatigue, headache, and 
even death. Try to limit fluids to no more than 6 cups an hour and 48 cups a day. The key with 
fluid intake is to replace losses and monitor signs and symptoms of under/over hydration. 
Sports Drinks. While drinking water is generally best for remaining hydrated, when engaging in 
prolonged exercise or physical exertion, a sports drink may be preferred to help replace electrolytes 
and carbohydrates. Sports drinks, or carbohydrate-electrolyte beverages that are designed to 
hydrate, generally contain a mixture of carbohydrates, sodium, and potassium, which have been 
shown to improve exercise performance. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
428 
 
 
 
Caffeine. Caffeine does not hydrate. Caffeine is a stimulant present in a variety of products 
including coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, dietary supplements, over-the-counter medications, and 
some foods. Caffeine used in moderation has been shown to improve cognitive performance in 
individuals. A cup of coffee typically has 100 milligrams of caffeine. However, caffeine is of an 
acidic nature and can be harmful if consumed in high doses. Consuming large doses of caffeine, 
roughly 400-500 milligrams at one time, can result in a serious condition known as “caffeine 
intoxication” which can lead to nausea, vomiting, agitation, nervousness, headache, electrolyte 
imbalances, or worse life-threatening symptoms. 
Energy Drinks. Energy drinks are not meant to hydrate. The effect of energy drinks on athletic 
performance is inconsistent. One thing you will find with energy drinks are warnings due to the 
use of stimulants, such as caffeine, green tea extract, guarana seed extract, yerba mate, acacia 
rigidula, taurine, ginseng, or other proprietary energy boost blends. Proprietary blends can contain 
novel, untested ingredients, along with botanicals, amino acids, proteins, peptides, or extracts. 
Additionally, vitamins and minerals may be added, leading to excessive intakes. The safest 
solution for hydration is to avoid energy supplements and learn more about electrolytes and 
carbohydrate fueling strategies to decide which sport drink (not energy drink) is the best choice. 
Alcohol. Alcohol does not hydrate. Anything in excess is not a good idea, particularly for alcohol. 
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise limiting alcohol to one drink per day for women and 
two drinks per day for men. The serving size for beer is 12 ounces, wine is five ounces, and 80 
proof distilled spirits is 1.5 ounces. The average serving of alcohol generally has about 150 
calories and can be a significant contributor to caloric consumption in the diet, with no nutritional 
value. Always exercise good judgment when consuming alcohol, whether or not otherwise 
restricted by public law or military directive. Alcohol may lead to excess weight gain, increased 
risk for chronic diseases, osteoporosis, stress injuries, and impaired short- and long-term cognitive 
function. Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can be harmful to your health and may increase 
the risk for high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, and several forms of cancer.

22.18. Tobacco-Free Force 
The USAF goal is to have a tobacco-free force. Optimal health and total fitness are force 
multipliers and critical to our military mission. Tobacco use includes all products that may be 
configured to deliver nicotine, including but not limited to cigars, cigarettes, electronic 
cigarettes/vape pens, stem pipes, water pipes, hookahs, vaporizers, smokeless products, and any 
other nicotine delivery system defined as a tobacco product. Using tobacco products is non- 
conducive to promoting mission readiness and productivity and is inconsistent with the USAF’s 
goal of a mission-ready, healthy, and fit force. 
The significant costs associated with tobacco use are both physical and financial. TRICARE has 
estimated that tobacco use costs the Department of Defense $1.7 billion annually because of 
increased healthcare utilization and decreased work productivity due to smoke breaks and 
illnesses. No less significant is the fact that the cost of smoking a pack a day for a year is one- 
month’s base pay for an Airman Basic. 
22.19. Tobacco Restrictions 
AFI 48-104, Tobacco Free Living, describes designated tobacco use areas and restrictions for 
tobacco products on USAF installations. Commanders and leaders shall minimize the number of 
designated tobacco use areas to as close to zero as possible. Installation minimum distances are 
at least 50 feet from building entrances, and air intake ducts. The minimum distance from 
playgrounds is at least 100 feet. The USAF prohibits all students in technical training, in- 
residence professional military education, accession, and graduate medical education programs 
from using tobacco products while in uniform, and prohibits tobacco use at all times during basic 
military training. 
22.20. Health Risks of Tobacco Use 
Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease and death in the United States. 
Tobacco smoke is a Class “A” carcinogen and is estimated to cause 480,000 deaths per year, of 
which, approximately 41,000 are from secondhand smoke exposure. Smokeless tobacco contains 
28 different cancer-causing agents (carcinogens). Oral cancers from tobacco products affect 
30,000 people annually, and one person dies every hour because of this disease. Only 50 percent 
of persons are alive at five years after diagnosis. In addition to several forms of cancer and 
cardiovascular disease, tobacco use affects all bodily systems. Tobacco use decreases endurance, 
night vision, and fine motor coordination (the coordination needed to hold a weapon steady). And 
tobacco use increases the risk of injuries (such as fractures), poses post-operative respiratory 
complications, and impairs (or slows) wound healing. Estimates show smoking increases the risk 
for coronary heart disease and stroke by two to four times, and for men and women developing 
lung cancer by approximately 25 times. 
22.21. Tobacco Cessation 
Nicotine found in tobacco products is addictive. Seven out of 10 smokers in the United States have 
indicated that they want to completely quit smoking, and nearly one-half have tried to quit in the 
past year. Some studies suggest that it may take some people up to 30 tries before successfully 
quitting smoking, others suggest that once you’ve made the conscious decision to quit, and you no 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
430 
 
 
 
longer consider yourself a smoker, tobacco user, or dipper, you change your lifestyle and kick the 
habit, regardless of temptation. Commanders are expected to support Airmen trying to quit tobacco 
products. Installation health promotion programs provide strategies for education, motivation, and 
intervention to discourage tobacco use. Formal, structured tobacco cessation programs designed 
to assist members in breaking the addiction to tobacco products are available as well. State 
telephone-based tobacco cessation quit lines can be reached at no-cost by U.S. residents of each 
state, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico at 1-800-QUIT-NOW. 
22.22. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program 
The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program is designed to promote 
readiness, health, and wellness through the prevention and treatment of substance misuse and 
abuse. Participation in ADAPT may serve to minimize the negative consequences of substance 
misuse and abuse to the individual, family, and organization; provide comprehensive education 
and treatment to individuals who experience problems attributed to substance misuse or abuse; and 
restore function and return identified substance abusers to unrestricted duty status or assist them 
in their transition to civilian life. Note: To ensure military readiness, the ingestion of products 
containing or derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil, including but not limited to delta-8- 
tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), is prohibited. Products made with 
hemp seed, hemp seed oil, and CBD may contain varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, an active 
ingredient of marijuana, which is detectable through USAF drug testing. Failure by military 
personnel to comply with the prohibition on the ingestion of products containing, or products 
derived from, hemp seed or hemp seed oil and CBD, is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of 
Military Justice. 
22.23. Leadership Responsibilities 
Signs and symptoms of substance use and misuse may exist. If signs do exist, talk with the 
individual to determine if professional assistance is needed. Document and discuss specific 
instances of unusual behavior or acknowledgement of a substance use problem with the supervisor, 
first sergeant, or unit commander to help expedite care, as needed. The responsibility to diagnose 
a substance us disorder lies with ADAPT personnel. 
Identifying individuals who may need treatment is a critical first step in helping them break free 
of the tremendously potent cycle of denial, negativity, and increased substance use; however, 
entering treatment is only a first step. A member’s substance use problem did not develop 
overnight, and treatment and recovery will likely take time. The treatment team, consisting of the 
commander, supervisor, member’s counselor, medical consultants, other appropriate helping 
agencies, and the member, provide continued support throughout treatment. Supervisors remain 
focused on the member’s duty performance, attendance in the program, and maintenance of 
standards. Commander, first sergeant, and supervisor involvement in the treatment team, and 
meeting at key points in the patient’s treatment and recovery, are important. The commander or 
first sergeant and the supervisor must be involved at program entry, termination, and anytime 
there are significant treatment difficulties. The primary objective of the treatment team is to guide 
the clinical course of the treatment after examining all the facts. Note: All RegAF members 
involved in alcohol- related misconduct will be referred for a substance use assessment. 
22.24. Substance Use Assessment and Treatment 
The central purpose of the substance use assessment is to determine the patient’s need for treatment 
and level of care required. ADAPT program managers conduct required reviews of medical 
records and all documentation within seven calendar days of notification to determine diagnosis, 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
431 
 
 
 
treatment planning, and delivery of substance use services. Substance use treatment is divided into 
two services: nonclinical and clinical. 
Nonclinical Services. Members who do not meet diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder 
will receive targeted prevention and education services tailored to the individual based on a 
thorough assessment and determination of risk. Follow-up appointments and review will be 
conducted to reassess the need for continued services. Additional counseling addressing bio- 
psychosocial issues identified in the assessment may be prescribed. Length of involvement will be 
determined based on the patient’s presenting problems and agreed-upon services or behavioral 
contract. Individuals being processed for separation are provided appropriate medical care 
(including but not limited to detoxification) prior to separation. Separation action is not postponed 
because of a member’s participation in ADAPT. 
Clinical Services. Those who meet the diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder will be 
entered into substance use treatment with the level and intensity of care determined by the ADAPT 
program manager. Depending on the member’s needs, variable lengths of stay or duration of 
treatment are provided within an array of treatment settings that reflect a multidisciplinary 
approach to assist the patient to achieve full recovery, free of the negative effects of substance use. 
To the greatest extent possible, patient detoxification will be managed on an outpatient basis. 
Individuals assessed as requiring medically managed (inpatient) detoxification will be entered into 
an appropriate medical facility. Family involvement is strongly encouraged. Note: Individuals 
diagnosed with a substance use disorder will refrain from the use of alcohol during the initial phase 
of treatment and are strongly encouraged to continue to abstain during aftercare. Involvement in 
self-help recovery groups is encouraged as an adjunct to treatment. The frequency of attendance 
is determined by the treatment team with the patient. 
Successful Completion. Patients will not be considered to have successfully completed treatment 
until the patient has completed treatment and continuing care (aftercare). Based on Veterans 
Affairs/Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Substance Use 
Disorders, current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria and American 
Society of Addiction Medicine criteria, the treatment team determines patient progress toward 
agreed-upon goals and issues as stated in the treatment plan and determines when the patient is 
effectively in recovery and no longer requires program resources. 
Failing the Program. The treatment team may determine failure of a patient’s participation in the 
program based on a demonstrated pattern of unacceptable behavior; inability or unwillingness to 
comply with their treatment plan; or involvement in alcohol or drug-related incidents after 
receiving initial treatment. An individual who has failed ADAPT will be considered for 
administrative separation by his or her commander. Decisions regarding aftercare services will be 
based on a current assessment of status and will include establishment of an aftercare treatment 
plan identifying specific goals, interventions, and means to assess interventions. 
22.25. Management of Personnel with Substance use Disorders 
The commander is responsible for all personnel and administrative actions pertaining to patients 
involved in ADAPT, to include assignment availability, promotion eligibility, reenlistment 
eligibility, personnel reliability program, and security clearance. Application of administrative 
restrictions should be based on the establishment of an unfavorable information file or control 
roster resulting from the member’s unacceptable behavior, and not solely based on their 
involvement in ADAPT. 
The Line of Duty Determination. A member’s substance use misconduct can lead to a line of 
duty determination. A line of duty determination is a finding made after an investigation into the 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
432 
 
 
 
circumstances of a member’s illness, injury, disease, or death. The line of duty determination 
protects the interests of both the member and the U.S. Government. The finding concludes: (1) 
whether or not the illness, injury, or disease existed prior to service, and if an existed prior to 
service condition was aggravated by military service; (2) whether or not the illness, injury, disease, 
or death occurred while the member was absent without authority; and (3) whether or not the 
illness, injury, disease, or death was due to the member’s misconduct. A line of duty determination 
may impact disability retirement and severance pay, forfeiture of pay, period of enlistment, as well 
as veteran benefits. Additional guidance may be found in DAFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (LOD) 
Determination, Medical Continuation (MEDCON), and Incapacitation (INCAP) Pay. 
Medical Care Referrals. Medical personnel must notify the unit commander and the ADAPT 
program manager when a member is observed, identified, or suspected as being under the influence 
of drugs or alcohol while seeking medical care; receives treatment for an injury or illness that may 
be the result of substance use; is suspected of abusing substances; or is admitted as a patient for 
alcohol or drug detoxification.

22.26. Mental Preparedness 
One of the telltale signs of a military professional is preparation. When the time comes to use the 
skills we’ve learned, military professionals are ready. Most experience is gained by accepting 
opportunities as they come, even when conditions are not perfect. Through experience, 
professionals build the confidence, judgment, courage, and integrity needed to continue 
developing professionally. The USAF is committed to taking care of Airmen and families and has 
a wide-range of support capabilities available to address issues and take care of the Total Force. 
Despite how ready we may feel, demands of the mission can sometimes increase stressors affecting 
well-being and resiliency. 
22.27. Psychological First Aid 
Psychological first aid is a way of reducing initial and ongoing stress by developing adaptive 
coping and recovery skills. Airmen who take care of themselves by getting adequate sleep, eating 
a balanced diet, and making time for rest and relaxation, combined with the use of positive stress 
management skills, can reduce actual and perceived stress in their lives. Whether deployed or in 
garrison, we all need a place to reset and recharge. Consider the following aspects of coping with 
stress, for yourself and for others. 
Have a physically and emotionally safe place to recuperate or to relax. 
Know (or be) someone who understands, listens, and is compassionate. 
Find opportunities to connect with others while at the gym, dining facility, or local events. 
Provide or demonstrate coping skills that empower others to return to ‘normal’ state. 
Seek supportive services, such as religious affairs, first sergeants, or mental health providers. 
Contact Military and Family Life Counselors for counseling and supportive services. 
22.28. Mental Strength and Resilience 
All people experience stressors (challenges or problems) and distress (negative feelings associated 
with stressors). Long workdays, increased deployments, and financial issues are just a few of the 
conditions that cause stress. The frequency of stress and the significant negative effect stress can 
have on people and organizations make this a major concern for Airmen at all levels. As an 
organizational concern, stress can negatively affect performance, organizational effectiveness, and 
mission accomplishment. As a personal concern, experiencing stress over an extended period of 
time can lead to health problems and affect overall quality of life. Therefore, it is important to 
personally and professionally recognize stress and learn how to manage it effectively. 
22.29. Stress Reactions 
For Airmen today, stressors occur within the work environment as well as outside the work 
environment, often involving family, relationship, and financial issues. We know when we feel 
stressed, but recognizing some of the key signs of stress can help deal with issues before they 
evolve into bigger problems. Stress reactions typically appear in four different categories: 
cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical. Reactions associated with these categories are 
provided here so they may be recognized and addressed early by minimizing, adjusting, or 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
434 
 
 
 
successfully coping with the cause. 
Cognitive Stress. Cognitive stress can manifest as memory problems, an inability to concentrate, 
poor judgment, seeing only the negative, anxious, or racing thoughts, or constant worrying. 
Emotional Stress. Emotional stress can manifest as apathy, anxiety, depression, irritability, job 
dissatisfaction, memory problems, or mental fatigue. 
Behavioral Stress. Behavioral stress can manifest as appetite changes, increased arguments, 
increased smoking, neglecting self-care, social withdrawal, substance abuse, or violence. 
Physical Stress. Physical stress can manifest as frequent illness, headaches, high blood pressure, 
increased heart rate, physical exhaustion, sleep disturbances, or weight gain or loss. 
22.30. Individual Stress Management 
The key to recognizing stress is knowing what feels normal so you can recognize when something 
feels off. The earlier stress can be identified, the earlier stress reduction techniques can be applied. 
Each of the following steps can help in developing a well-rounded stress management plan. 
Make Adjustments. Reduce stress by identifying potential stressors before they arise. For 
example, if you are stressed by crowds and long lines, adjust your plans so that you may minimize 
the exposure to crowded environments. While planning can’t prevent all stress, it is extremely 
valuable in minimizing or preparing for exposure to stress before a stressor occurs. 
Time Management. Not having enough time to complete a task can be a significant stressor for 
some people. If time management is an issue, reduce stress by using effective time management 
skills and tools, like developing a task list and prioritizing tasks. 
Overload Avoidance. For most people to eliminate or reduce the effects of overload-related 
stressors is relatively simple. For a start, identify and avoid busy work, delegate, or empower others, 
when possible, learn to say no, and attempt to negotiate unreasonable deadlines. 
Relaxation. Relaxation can help manage stress and help you stay alert, energetic, and productive. 
Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, reading, and listening to music can improve your heart 
rate, regulate your blood pressure, and decrease your respiratory rate. By incorporating relaxation 
skills into your daily routines, you can train your body to respond differently to stress. 
Exercise and Nutrition. Regular exercise combined with a healthy diet is an effective stress 
management technique. Exercise can provide an outlet for excess energy and tension caused by 
stress. Eating nutritious foods ensures your body has the nutrients needed to manage stress and 
helps prevent overeating. Exercising and eating a balanced diet help your body become more 
resistant to the negative results of stress, such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, and frequent 
illness. 
Social Support. Having a strong social support network, such as family, friends, social groups, 
and peers, can help manage stress. Being able to discuss problems with people who care about you 
and your well-being can help reduce stress by providing a more positive outlook, suggesting 
solutions to your problems, or just listening. 
Prioritize. On the job, identify potential sources of stress, determine the importance of each task, 
and eliminate tasks that are not necessary or productive. If a job requires long hours, consider using 
elements of job enrichment, like adequate time off or periodic breaks to help reduce potential 
stress. If possible, restructure the job to accommodate individual needs to help reduce stress and 
enhance productivity. 
 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
435 
 
 
 
22.31. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can occur after someone 
has gone through a traumatic event, such as war-related combat, sexual or physical assault, or a 
natural or man-made disaster. The USAF strongly encourages Airmen to seek treatment early or 
encourages early intervention. Because this disorder impacts not only the person who suffers from 
it, but those who are close to them, it is important for all military members to be educated about 
PTSD. With enhanced awareness, many people may be prevented from developing this condition, 
and those who suffer from PTSD may receive treatment before symptoms become disabling and 
chronic. 
Symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Symptoms of PTSD include: (1) intrusive or 
unwanted thoughts, such as distressing memories, nightmares, or flashbacks; (2) avoidance 
behavior in the form of efforts to avoid reminders of the traumatic event; (3) negative thoughts 
and moods, such as feeling disconnected from others or believing that the world is a dangerous 
place; and (4) hyper-arousal symptoms, including difficulty sleeping and irritability. 
Approximately seven to eight percent of the United States population will have PTSD at some 
point during their lives. Fortunately, within the last decade researchers have developed highly 
effective treatments that can lead to symptom reduction and even loss of the diagnosis of PTSD. 
Helpful Actions to Take. Knowing how to respond to someone with an invisible wound, such as 
PTSD, is challenging because there is so much going on inside the individual that is not visible on 
the outside. Some of their behaviors or moods may make you feel uncomfortable, confused, or 
even annoyed. However, it is important to remember that a person with PTSD may be so distracted 
by painful thoughts, memories, or physical injuries, that they are not fully able to focus and 
concentrate as well as they would like to. 
A great way to determine how to respond to a person with an invisible wound is to put yourself in 
their shoes, to practice empathy: 
Try to imagine how you would feel in their situation, even if you don’t know all of the details 
of what they’ve experienced. 
Remind yourself and those around you of the sacrifice that has been made in service of our 
country. 
Don’t be afraid to ask about what is going on. Give yourself permission to intervene if you think 
they need help and make the time to have a sincere conversation with them. Question starters 
to help you talk about this topic are: 
“What’s going on in your life? I’ve noticed you seem upset.” “I’m concerned about you. 
Can we talk about it?” 
“Is there something I can do to help you?” “What do you think might help?” 
Once you’ve asked a question, allow time and space for the answer. Encourage them to share 
without fear of judgment or interruption. Listening shows you care, will help you understand, 
and builds rapport. 
Acknowledge the distress. It is not helpful to tell them they shouldn’t feel a certain way. PTSD 
is a real condition that produces measurable changes in brain function. Acknowledging distress 
is a key step in dispelling myths about invisible wounds and removing the stigma associated 
with getting help. 
Discuss needs and offer to help make a plan to address them. Often, this means suggesting a 
helping resource. Offering to accompany them can be a good way to make getting help seem

less difficult. 
Additional training on how to interact with Airmen with invisible wounds, such as PTSD, can be 
found in the invisible wounds videos located at the Department of the Air Force Resilience 
website (https://www.resilience.af.mil/).  
22.32. Redeployment, Recovery, and Reconstitution 
Deploying Airmen receive just-in-time training on stress reactions, psychological first aid, and 
referral resources through pre-deployment mental health training. While preparation, deployment, 
and post-deployment support are all important, receiving continued support upon return from 
deployment is an emphasized aspect of readiness. The intent of the ongoing redeployment support 
process is to provide continuous, integrated support from the deployed area to home station while 
assisting with the transition from the deployed environment to family life and worksite. Taking 
leave after arduous duty and deployment can have a beneficial effect on an individual’s 
psychological and physical status, and an immediate recovery period allows returning Airmen to 
tend to personal needs neglected during lengthy periods away from home. Sometimes readjustment 
from deployment requires participation in structured recovery time and activities for members and 
families prior to leave. The redeployment support timeline identifies activities at the critical 
redeployment, recovery, reintegration, and reconstitution junctures. 
22.33. Psychological Services 
Mental health services are designed to strengthen the readiness capability of the force and ensure 
Airmen are equipped for peak performance. Seeking care for a mental health problem is a sign of 
strength, not a sign of weakness. Seeking help early increases the likelihood of recovery and 
reduces risk for subsequent negative consequences of mental health symptoms. More than 12 
percent of USAF personnel voluntarily seek mental health services each year. Willingness to seek 
help when needed is a sign of good self-awareness and judgment. The fear of having a negative 
impact on one’s career for seeking care at the mental health clinic is diminishing across the USAF. 
Time has proven that seeking help appropriately often does not have a long-term negative career 
impact. In fact, seeking help can improve performance and enable people to better solve problems. 
In many cases, seeking mental health treatment early can actually save one’s USAF career. 
22.34. USAF Suicide Prevention Program 
When suicides occur in the USAF, they result in a number of serious consequences: the loss of 
human life; grief and loss to the deceased’s family, friends, co-workers, and military community; 
and a direct impact on mission capability through loss of the deceased’s skills, experience, and 
productivity. While suicide prevention is the responsibility of every Airman, the USAF has 
identified that leadership support and action across all levels of command are critical to the goal 
of reducing suicide in the USAF. Military and civilian leaders will build an environment that 
promotes healthy and adaptive behaviors, fosters the wingman culture, and encourages responsible 
help-seeking actions of all Airmen. Note: In an effort to promote help-seeking actions by Airmen 
who are experiencing legal or administrative problems, the USAF instituted the Limited Privilege 
Suicide Prevention Program in accordance with AFI 44-172, Mental Health, which provided an 
added layer of confidentiality that allows Airmen who are under investigation to receive mental 
health care without the risk of information disclosed during treatment being used to incriminate 
them in the future. This is important since Airmen who are under investigation for legal problems 
are at significantly elevated risk for suicide and other negative outcomes. Mental health providers 
are required by DoDI 6490.08, Command Notification Requirements to Dispel Stigma in 
Providing Mental Health Care to Service Members, to disclose safety (suicidal or violent thoughts 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
437 
 
 
 
or self-injurious behavior) and fitness for duty issues to commanders, but all other information is 
confidential. 
22.35. Recognition 
Airmen must know the importance of recognizing that anyone can become suicidal, regardless of 
how well they have previously managed military or personal stress. Warning signs can be sudden, 
may signify a person is in distress, and require immediate support. Sudden changes, such as sleep 
difficulties or discipline problems, may be warning signs. Those most likely to spot a person at 
risk for suicide are the ones with whom an individual interacts on a daily basis (friends, coworkers, 
and immediate supervisors). These individuals are best positioned to notice changes in behavior, 
mood, or performance. If you hear someone comment or indicate they’re considering suicide, take 
it seriously, get involved, and get them the help they need. Even if there appears to be no real 
indication of a serious problem, be observant for any sudden changes in behavior or attitude that 
could be a sign that they need help. Find out what caused the observed changes, assist in choosing 
resources to resolve stressors, and communicate concerns with the chain of command, as 
appropriate. 
Leaders and Airmen of all ranks have a vested interest in knowing the people they work with, 
investing in their professional and personal development, and quickly addressing issues whenever 
they arise. The following actions can be taken to support and help resolve life’s challenges and 
reduce the number of suicides: (1) know co-workers, their usual moods and behaviors, and how 
they are functioning; (2) be able to recognize early signs of risk, stress, and distress; (3) engage 
with Airmen to determine what may be stressful or problematic; (4) assist Airmen with choosing 
the most appropriate resource to help resolve the problem; and (5) follow-up with Airmen to ensure 
the stressors are resolving and new ones are not taking their place. 
Risk Factors. Risk factors for suicide can include, but are not limited to relationship difficulties, 
problems at work, legal and financial problems, mental health diagnosis, substance misuse, and 
previous suicide attempts. Some factors leaders should watch for and address to ensure effective 
supervision and open communication exist in the organization are: (1) tunnel vision on the mission; 
(2) not engaging with Airmen; (3) difficulty recognizing risk factors and warning signs; (4) lack 
of knowledge of USAF supported resources and the true impact of seeking help on a USAF career; 
and (5) inappropriately sheltering Airmen from the consequences of their actions or failing to take 
proper action. 
Protective Factors. Protective factors include social support, connectedness, sense of belonging, 
sense of purpose, effective individual coping skills, and cultural norms that promote and protect 
responsible help-seeking behavior. 
22.36. Ask, Care, and Escort Model 
Suicide prevention is everyone’s responsibility. The Ask, Care, and Escort (ACE) Model was 
developed to assist Airmen in intervening when an Airman experiences stress, distress, or faces 
challenges. Understanding the appropriate steps to suicide risk prevention and the available USAF 
approved resources can aid in saving the career and life of a fellow Airman. The acronym ACE is 
one that people can easily remember. 
Ask. When you see or hear any of the warning signs discussed in this section, or are aware of risk 
factors in someone’s life, ask questions to learn more about the person’s situation. If you have any 
uncertainty about someone’s safety, calmly but directly ask the question, “Are you thinking of 
killing/hurting yourself?” Asking about suicide gives people permission to talk about a subject that 
may otherwise be difficult to bring up. It lets the Airman know you are ready to discuss what they 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
438 
 
 
 
are experiencing. Do not promise to keep thoughts of suicide a secret. Airmen need to remember 
the importance of sharing these concerns with leaders and professionals who can help. 
Care. Showing care and concern for those at risk is important. Simply taking the time to ask about 
problems, and asking specifically about suicide, shows caring and concern. If someone 
acknowledges thoughts of suicide, listen, and allow them to share what is troubling them. Avoid 
making judgmental statements, immediately trying to solve their problem, or trying to talk them 
out of suicide. If they share thoughts of suicide with you, accept that they are in distress, listen to 
their concerns, and begin getting them help. Determine if they have a plan for suicide, what the 
plan is, and take reasonable steps to secure the potential means of suicide, but do not put yourself 
in harm’s way. Airmen in distress who are seeking access to lethal means, such as a firearm, should 
be considered at risk for self-harm. If you are not able to secure the potential means of self-harm, 
or you have significant concern about the individual’s safety, then contact command and 
emergency services. Building time and space between Airmen in distress and access to lethal 
means (including firearms and medications) can reduce the risk of suicide attempts and deaths. 
Escort. After asking about suicide and showing concern, the final step is to escort the person to 
command or professional support that can provide appropriate assistance. Do not leave the person 
in distress alone. At most bases, professionals are on call through the command post, and 
evaluations can be conducted in local emergency rooms if on-base services are not accessible. If a 
distressed Airman will not agree to go with you and you have significant concern about the 
individual’s safety you should contact your chain of command, contact emergency services; local, 
civilian, or national resources; dial 911; go to the emergency room or mental health clinic; or call 
the Veterans Crisis Line (1-800-273-8255). The most important step is to get the individual the 
help they need if they are in distress. 
22.37. Comprehensive Airman Fitness 
Comprehensive Airman Fitness (CAF) is a holistic approach to build and sustain a thriving and 
resilient USAF Community by taking care of each other and ourselves through wellness in four 
domains – mental, physical, social, and spiritual. The intent is to equip Airmen and families with 
the tools and skills needed to continually assess and adjust to the unique challenges of a military 
lifestyle. The Wingman concept is a core element of CAF essential to building fit, resilient, and 
ready Airmen by dedicating time to focus on individual and unit wellness and fostering a culture 
of Airmen taking care of Airmen. 
Mental Domain. The mental domain is defined as the ability to effectively cope with unique 
mental stressors and challenges needed to ensure mission readiness. The tenets of the mental 
domain are awareness, adaptability, positive thinking, and decision-making. 
Physical Domain. The physical domain is defined as the ability to adopt and sustain healthy 
behaviors needed to enhance health and wellness. The tenets of the physical domain are 
endurance, strength, nutrition, and recovery. 
Social Domain. The social domain is defined as the ability to engage in healthy social networks 
that promote overall well-being and optimal performance. The tenets of the social domain are 
connectedness, teamwork, social support, and communication. 
Spiritual Domain. The spiritual domain is defined as the ability to strengthen a set of beliefs, 
principles, or values that sustain an individual’s sense of well-being and purpose. The tenets of the 
spiritual domain are purpose, core values, perseverance, and perspective. 
Additional information, tools, and programs designed to strengthen individual and unit CAF can 
be found by visiting the Department of the Air Force Resilience website.

22.38. Support Agencies 
Commanders, supervisors, wingmen, and individuals have many resources to help resolve 
problems and challenges for themselves, their families, and others, in healthy, safe, and 
constructive ways. A few of the sources are provided here for a quick reference screenshot. 
 
22.39. Medical Care 
The military health system supports all uniformed service personnel, retirees, and their families. It 
provides the direction, resources, health care providers, and other means necessary for promoting 
the health of the beneficiary population. Military health support includes developing and 
promoting health awareness issues to educate customers, discovering, and resolving 
environmentally based health threats, providing health services (including preventive care, 
problem intervention services, pastoral care, and religious support), and improving the means and 
methods for maintaining the health of the beneficiary population by constantly evaluating the 
performance of the health support. Army, Navy, and USAF medical professionals help ensure 
those in uniform are medically ready to deploy anywhere around the globe on a moment's notice. 
These medical professionals not only send service members on their way, they’re with them. 
Defense Health Agency. The Defense Health Agency is a joint, integrated combat support agency 
within the military health system that enables the Army, Navy, and USAF medical services to 
provide a medically ready force and ready medical force to CCMDs in both peacetime and 
wartime. The Defense Health Agency supports the delivery of integrated, affordable, and high-
quality health services to military health system beneficiaries and is responsible for driving greater 
integration of clinical and business processes across the military health system. 
22.40. Air Force Medical Service 
Specifically, the Air Force Medical Service’s mission is to enable medically fit forces, provide 
expeditionary medics, and improve the health of all who serve to meet our nation’s needs. The 
Air Force Medical Service’s vision is to ensure that patients are the “Healthiest and Highest 
Performing Segment of the United States by 2025.” The service’s four primary objectives are: 
promote and sustain a healthy and fit force, prevent illness and injury, restore health, and optimize 
human performance. It is increasingly called upon to deliver medical capabilities throughout the 
range of military operations, consisting of civil-military operations, global health engagement, or 
humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, as part of joint or multinational operations.

23.1. Professional Military Image 
According to AFI 1-1, first impressions are often drawn based upon appearance. For military 
members, presenting a professional image matters just as much as professional behavior. Pride in 
one’s personal appearance and uniform wear greatly enhances the esprit-de-corps essential to an 
effective military force. Projecting a professional military image reflects not only on the individual, 
but also on the USAF, both on- and off duty. While this list is not all inclusive, keep the following 
expectations in mind for portraying a professional image. 
When in uniform, do not smoke or use smokeless tobacco products, except when authorized in 
designated smoking areas. 
Use of personal electronic media devices, including cellular phones, earpieces, speaker phones, 
or text messaging while walking in uniform is authorized. Military customs and courtesies take 
precedence. 
Do not consume food while walking in uniform. Beverage consumption is authorized. 
Commanders may authorize food consumption while walking in uniform during special 
functions. Military customs and courtesies take precedence.  
Do not engage in public displays of affection, except when briefly permitted in situations where 
physical contact is a commonly accepted etiquette, such as weddings, graduations, promotions, 
retirement ceremonies, or upon departure for or return from deployment. 
23.2. Dress and Personal Appearance Standards 
Dress and personal appearance standards are established to ensure every Airman reflects pride in 
personal appearance, professionalism, and esprit de corps. Deeply rooted in our USAF heritage, 
our dress and appearance standards provide visible examples of self-discipline, commitment, and 
a willingness to set aside individuality for the betterment of the whole. As outlined in DAFI 36-
2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of United States Air Force and United States Space Force 
Personnel, standards of dress and personal appearance consist of five elements: neatness, 
cleanliness, safety, uniformity, and military image. It is every Airman’s responsibility, regardless 
of position or rank, to comply with and respectfully enforce the prescribed standards. Note: More 
restrictive standards regarding personal appearance maybe imposed on- or off-duty for those 
performing highly  visible special mission requirements, or for those in special duty positions. 
23.3. Hair Standards 
Hair. Will be conservative, clean, well-groomed, present a professional appearance. Regardless 
of hairstyle, hair must not exceed length and bulk standard, and ensure proper wear of headgear, 
helmet, or chemical mask to conform to safety requirements. Will not contain excessive amounts 
of grooming aids (e.g., gel, mousse, pomade, or moisturizer), appear lopsided, touch either 
eyebrow (Exception: female bangs), or end below an imaginary line across the forehead at the top 
of the eyebrows that is parallel to the ground. If applied, dyes, tints, bleaches, and frostings must 
result in natural hair colors, present a natural appearance and be complementary to facial hair e.g., 
eyebrows, lashes, beards (if authorized for medical or religious reasons), etc. Examples of natural 
hair colors are brown, blonde, brunette, natural red, gray, or black. All Airmen are authorized to 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
441 
 
 
 
wear natural color hair regardless of their natural born hair color, but when highlighted or frosted, 
the colors must blend as to naturally. Example: Hair colors may be displayed as a “salt-and-pepper” 
look as this presents a naturally blended hair color and is, therefore, authorized. 
Wigs/Hairpieces/Extensions. Are authorized and will meet the same standards required for 
natural hair, be of good quality, fit properly, and comply with safety, functionality, and 
professional military standards. If synthetic hair or extensions are added to hair, they will be natural 
hair colors, and must blend with Airmen’s hair, as to not create an unnatural appearance (Note: 
Extensions are prohibited for males). Wigs/Hairpieces/Extensions will not be used to cover 
unauthorized hair styles. Synthetic hair or other materials are not authorized when prohibited by 
safety and mission requirements. Commanders may authorize Airmen to wear plain (single color, 
without additional ornamentation, frills/ruffles, excess fabric that extends down the back) caps 
(black, navy, or tan) while indoors due to a medical condition (e.g., Alopecia, radiation and/or 
chemotherapy). Airmen are still required to wear appropriate headgear while outdoors. Note: Head 
scarves are not authorized. 
Hairnets. Worn as required for health or safety reasons. Made of natural or a synthetic material; 
must be conservative (plain and moderate, being within reasonable limits; not excessive or 
extreme), solid color similar to the member's hair color, also strong enough to support and control 
hair and contain no metal fasteners. Hairnets are only authorized when performing related duties 
as determined by applicable commander. 
Unauthorized Hair Colors. Hair will not be burgundy, purple, orange, fluorescent, or neon (not 
all inclusive). Ombre (a gradual lightening or darkening along the lengths of the hair) or black hair 
with blonde highlights and blonde hair with black are unnatural in appearance and not authorized 
for wear. Other unauthorized examples include instances where hair and facial hair drastically 
contrast. 
Unauthorized Styles. Mohawk, mullet, or etched design. Other societal trends that reasonably 
appear unnatural or that display vastly different shades of natural colors, regardless of the 
universally applied name. Males only: dreadlocks, coils, braids, twists, designs, and/or hair 
extensions are not authorized; see Figure 23.1 for examples. Females only: Partially shaved sides 
and/or back of the head with long hair on the top (requiring the wear of a ponytail, bun, or braid) 
is prohibited. See Figure 23.2 for examples of unauthorized hairstyles.

Hair (Male). Tapered appearance on both sides and the back of the head, both with and without 
headgear so that when viewed from any angle the member's hair conforms to the shape of the head, 
curving inward to the natural termination point without eccentric directional flow, twists, or 
spiking. A block-cut is permitted with tapered appearance. Hair will not exceed 2 ½ inches in bulk, 
regardless of length and 1/4-inch at natural termination point; allowing only closely cut or shaved 
hair on the back of the neck to touch the collar (see Figure 23.3). Hair will not protrude under the 
front band of headgear. Cleanly shaven heads, military high-and- tight or flattop cuts are 
authorized. Airmen may have one (cut, clipped, or shaved) front to back, straight-line part, not 
slanted or curved, on either side of their head, above the temple. Part will not exceed 4-inches 
length or 1/4-inch width (See Figure 23.5). See Figure 23.4 for examples of appropriate sideburns, 
mustache, and male hair standards.

Sideburns. If worn, sideburns will be straight and even width (not flared) and will not extend below 
the bottom of the orifice of the ear opening. Sideburns will end in a clean-shaven horizontal line. 
See Figure 23.4. 
Mustaches. Male members may have mustaches; No portion of the mustache will extend below the 
lip line of the upper lip. The mustache will not go beyond a horizontal line extending across the 
corners of the mouth and no more than 1/4-inch beyond a vertical line drawn from the corner of the 
mouth (Figure 23.4 and 23.6). Mustaches must present a natural appearance to the Airman’s hair 
color of the head. Mustache handlebars, twist, curls, and goatee are prohibited.

official, or as authorized pursuant to a request for a religious accommodation. When authorized for 
medical reasons, members will keep all facial hair trimmed to the same length and it may not to 
exceed 1/4-inch in length. Individuals granted a shaving profile may shave or trim their facial hair 
to present a neat, clean, professional military image (Figure 23.7). Members may not overly 
shave, shape, or taper beard to achieve different styles of beard (e.g., goatees, faded beards, etc. 
are not authorized). Beards must present a natural appearance to the Airman’s hair color of the 
head. Beards are not authorized to be bleached or dyed. Beard wear authorized for religious reasons 
are governed by DAFI 36-2903, Chapter 11.  
 
Figure 23.7 Shaving Waiver Example 
Hair (Female and Male with approved unshorn hair religious accommodations). No 
minimum hair length, to a maximum bulk of 4-inches from scalp and allows proper wear of 
headgear. Minimum hair standards must present a symmetric (around the axis of the head) or 
tapered appearance when viewed from all angles. Hair will end above the bottom edge of collar 
and will not extend below an invisible line drawn parallel to the ground, both front to back and 
side to side unless pulled back and secured or worn in an authorized ponytail or equivalent or long 
braid(s). When hair is pulled back and secured behind the head (will not be gathered at the crown 
or worn on the top of the head), radius will not exceed 6-inches to the left or right from the point 
where the hair is gathered for a total of 12-inches in width, 6-inches in bulk and must allow for 
proper wear of headgear. One or two braids or a single ponytail or equivalent may be worn down 
the member’s back with length not extending below a horizontal line running between the top of 
each sleeve inseam at the under arm through the shoulder blades. The braid(s), ponytail or 
equivalent shall extend down the member’s back and cannot be worn over the shoulder or pulled 
in front of the body. Bangs, or side-swiped hair, may touch eyebrows but will not touch or cover 
eyes. When in doubt, assess the correct length of hair with the Airman standing in the position of 
attention. See Figure 23.8., Figure 23.10, and Figure 23.11 for examples of female hair standards. 
Exception: While wearing the Physical Training Gear (PTG), long hair will be secured but may 
have loose ends and may extend below a horizontal line running between the top of each sleeve 
inseam at the under arm through the shoulder blades.

Figure 23.8 Female Hair Examples 
Pinned-up hair should be styled in a manner that prevents loose ends from extending upward on the 
head and may not start at the crown of the head or be worn on the top of the head. When hair is in a 
bun, the bun must be a single bun; all loose ends must be tucked in and secured. Hair must allow for 
proper wear of headgear. 
Hair accessories. If worn, hair accessories (e.g., fabric scrunches, hairpins, combs, clips, headbands, 
elastic bands, barrettes, etc.) must be black or match hair color. Invisible hairnets and hairnets that 
match hair color are authorized. Headbands or fabric scrunches will not exceed 2-inches in width. 
Ornaments are not authorized (i.e., ribbons, beads, jeweled pins). See Figure 23.9. 
 
Figure 23.9 Female Hair Accessories 
Locs, braids, twists, micro-braids, french braids, dutch braids, and cornrows are authorized. A braid 
or twist is two or more portions of interwoven hair. If adding additional hair, it must be a natural-
looking color, matching the individual’s hair color. Multiple locs, braids, twists or cornrows may 
come together down the back in one or two braids, or a single ponytail as described in Figure 23.10. 
All locs, braids and twists, when worn will be of uniform dimension, no wider than one-inch, with 
natural spacing between the locs, braids, and twists and must be tightly interwoven to present a neat, 
professional, and well-groomed appearance. When worn, multiple locs, braids, or twists shall be of 
uniform dimension, no larger than a 1/4 in diameter, show no more than 1/4-inch of scalp between 
the locs, braids, or twists and must be tightly interwoven to present a neat appearance. 
A braid/twist must continue to the end of the hair without design and following the contour of the 
head and may be worn loose or in a secured style within hair standards as described above. 
Exception: Micro-braids or twists are not required to continue to the end of the hair. See Figure 3.10 
for examples of braids, twists, micro-braids.

Tattoos/Brands/Body Markings. For purposes of DAFI 36-2903, a tattoo is defined as a picture, 
design, or marking made on the skin or other areas of the body by staining it with an indelible dye, 
or by any other method, including pictures, designs, or markings only detectible or visible under 
certain conditions (such as ultraviolet or invisible ink tattoos). A brand is defined as a picture, design, 
or other marking that is burned into the skin or other areas of the body. Body markings are pictures, 
designs, or other markings as a result of using means other than burning to permanently scar or mark 
the skin. Failure to obey the mandatory provisions in DAFI 36-2903, paragraphs 3.2.1, 3.2.1.1, and 
3.2.2 constitutes a violation of Article 92(1), UCMJ–failure to obey lawful general order or 
regulation. Article 92(1) of the UCMJ does not apply to members while in Title 32 status (that is, 
activated for state duty under state command), but ANG members may be subject to an equivalent 
article under a state military justice code. Violations may also result in administrative disciplinary 
action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws. 
Unauthorized content/locations. Tattoos/brands/body markings will not be on the head, face, 
tongue, lips, eyes, and scalp. Tattoos/brands/body markings anywhere on the body that are obscene, 
commonly associated with gangs, extremist, and/or supremacist organizations, or that advocate 
sexual, racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination are prohibited in and out of uniform. Indecent 
tattoos/brands/body markings are grossly offensive to modesty, decency, or propriety, or shocks the 
moral sense, because of its vulgar, filthy, or disgusting nature, or its tendency to incite lustful thought. 
It is indecent if it tends reasonably to corrupt morals or incite libidinous thoughts. It must not violate 
community standards. Commanders should contact their servicing AFOSI unit for additional 
information on potential identification of gang/hate group, tattoos/brands/body markings. 
Extremist tattoos/brands/body markings are those affiliated with, depicting, or symbolizing 
extremist philosophies, organizations, or activities. Sexually discriminative tattoos/brands/body 
markings are those that advocate a philosophy that degrades or demeans a person. Racially 
discriminative tattoos/brands/body markings are those that advocate a philosophy that degrades or

demeans a person based on race, ethnicity, or national origin. Religiously discriminative 
tattoos/brands/body markings are those that advocate a philosophy that degrades or demeans a 
person based on religion. Tattoos/brands/body markings with unauthorized content that are 
prejudicial to good order and discipline, or the content is of a nature that tends to bring discredit 
upon the DAF are prohibited both in and out of uniform. Airmen and Guardians may not cover up 
tattoos, brands, and/or body markings with bandages or make-up in order to comply with 
unauthorized content tattoo policy. 
Members who have or receive unauthorized content tattoos/brands/body markings are required to 
initiate tattoo/brand/body marking removal/alteration. At the commander’s discretion, members may 
be seen, on a space and resource available basis, in a DoD medical treatment facility for voluntary 
tattoo/brand/body marking removal. When DoD resources are not available, members may have the 
tattoo/brand removed/altered at their own expense outside of DoD medical treatment facilities. 
Permissive Temporary Duty is not authorized for this purpose. 
Authorized content/locations. Tattoos are authorized on the chest and back (below the open collar 
uniform), arms, legs, feet, hands, and neck. One tattoo on the neck is authorized and will not exceed 
1-inch in measurement in any direction. The neck tattoo will only be placed behind a vertical line at 
the opening of the ear orifice around the back to a vertical line at the opening of the other ear orifice 
and includes behind the ear (See Figure 23.16). Ring tattoos are limited to a single band on one finger 
of each hand, no more than 3/8-inch in width below the knuckle and above the finger joint (portion 
closest to the palm). In addition to the ring tattoo, a single tattoo is authorized on each hand; the tattoo 
will not exceed the size of 1-inch measured in any direction. Hand, arm, leg, neck, and ring tattoos 
can be exposed and visible while wearing any uniform combination(s). Chest and back tattoos will 
not be visible through any uniform combination(s) or visible while wearing an open collar uniform. 
Members may request an ETP for location or size of tattoos in accordance with DAFI 36-2903, 
paragraph 15.5 prior to receiving applicable tattoo. Approved tattoo ETPs will be documented on the 
DAF Form 4428, Tattoo/Brand/Body Marking Screening/Verification. An ETP request for tattoos 
with unauthorized content will not be considered.

Cosmetic tattooing. Tattooing for cosmetic purposes is authorized when directed by licensed, 
qualified medical personnel to correct a medical condition, illness, or injury for both men and 
women. When not medically directed, cosmetic tattooing is permitted for women if done to apply 
permanent facial makeup (i.e., eyebrows, eyeliner) and for men if for permanent cosmetics for scalp 
only (micropigmentation) to create a natural hair appearance. The cosmetic tattooing must have a 
natural and conservative appearance. 
Individuals who are initially accessed must disclose any tattoos or brands not meeting the above

criteria and receive appropriate Air Force Component Recruiting Service review (AFRS, AFRCRS, 
ANG) to determine eligibility when questionable for enlistment or appointment. Complete removal 
or alteration of unauthorized content and/or excessive tattoos/brands/body markings is otherwise 
required prior to being accepted in the Air Force. 
Each component’s senior waiver authority as defined by the Air Force Accessions and Training 
Division (AF/A1PT), per DAFI 36-2903, paragraph 3.2.4, may allow for individual exceptions to 
policy to potential Air Force applicants with hand tattoos (anywhere on the hand) that are no more 
than 25% of the hand. The hand is defined as the end part of a person’s arm beyond the wrist, 
including the palm, fingers, and thumb. All content tattoo restrictions still apply. This authority may 
be further delegated at the discretion of the Senior Waiver Authority but no lower than Recruiting 
Squadron Commanders (RCS/CCs) (RegAF/Reserve) and Recruiting & Retention Chiefs (ANG). 
This authority will only be used for exceptionally qualified applicants as determined by the Waiver 
Authority and is limited to undermanned critical career fields/specialties unable to fill shortages with 
applicants unless an ETP is granted to the applicant. Exceptionally qualified applicants include those 
with critical skill sets, degrees, certifications, or experience directly related to the specialty for which 
they are being considered. 
Approved hand tattoo ETPs will be documented on the DAF Form 4428, Tattoo/Brand/Body 
Marking Screening/Verification. 
Commanders will use these provisions in determining the acceptability of tattoos, brands, and body 
markings displayed by members in uniform. 
Per DAFI 36-2903, paragraph 2.14.4, commanders will retain the authority to be more restrictive for 
covering tattoos, body ornaments and personal grooming based on legal, safety, sanitary, and/or host 
nation agreements. 
23.4.  Body Piercing/Ornamentation 
In civilian attire on official duty and in uniform on or off a military installation: With the exception

affixing, or displaying objects, articles, jewelry, or ornamentation to or through the ear, nose, tongue, 
eyebrows, lips, or any exposed body part (includes visible through the uniform). 
Dental ornamentation. Teeth, whether natural, capped, or veneered, will not be ornamented with 
designs, jewels, initials, etc. The use of yellow gold, white gold, or platinum caps (permanent or 
temporary) merely to add ornamentation to the teeth and not required by dental/medical necessity is 
prohibited. Waivers are not required for Air Force members or recruits with permanent yellow gold, 
white gold or platinum caps that were applied as a result of dental/medical necessity. Members with 
official documentation that they received permanent yellow gold, white gold, or platinum caps which 
were not applied as a result of dental/medical necessity, prior to 13 June 2011, are exempted. No 
other dental ornamentation is exempted. 
23.5.  Body Alterations and Modifications 
Intentional alterations and/or modifications to a member’s body that result in a visible, physical 
effect that disfigures, deforms, or otherwise detracts from a professional military image are 
prohibited. Examples of prohibited conduct include (but are not limited to) tongue splitting or 
forking, tooth filing, acquiring visible, disfiguring skin implants, and gauging (piercing holes large 
enough to permit light to shine through). Members who intentionally alter and/or modify any part of 
their bodies in order to achieve a visible, physical effect that disfigures, deforms, or otherwise 
detracts from a professional military image may be subject to disciplinary action or involuntary 
separation, as determined appropriate by the member’s commander. Failure by RegAF members, 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
452 
 
 
 
AFR members on active duty or inactive duty for training, and ANG members in Title 10 status to 
obey the mandatory provisions in this paragraph constitutes a violation of Article 92 (1), UCMJ – 
failure to obey lawful order or regulation. ANG members in Title 32 status performing full-time 
National Guard duty or inactive duty for training, who violate the mandatory provisions of DAFI 36-
2903, may be held accountable through similar provisions of their respective state military codes.

23.10. The Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP), Male and Female. The OCP may be worn 
off base for short convenience stops and when eating at restaurants where people wear comparable 
civilian attire. Do not wear OCPs off base to eat in restaurants where most diners wear business attire 
or at establishments that operate primarily to serve alcohol. Do not starch or hot press the OCP; Light 
ironing is authorized; however, repeated hot pressing or heavy ironing will accelerate the overall wear 
of the fabric. OCPs purchased by Air Force personnel through the AAFES MCSS, or issued through 
Individual Equipment Elements or contract equivalent, are certified as fully compliant with all 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

specifications. No other suppliers are approved for organizational/unit purchases, or any appropriated, 
or overseas contingency operation funds expenditures. If personnel choose to use personal funds to 
purchase from non-AAFES suppliers, the Air Force is not responsible if the uniform is not fully 
compliant. The non-fire-retardant and improved hot weather combat OCP uniforms are the only OCP 
uniforms authorized to be worn by all Airmen. (Exception: Airmen in jobs that have occupational 
safety and health administration (OSHA) requirements for wear of the 100% cotton fire-retardant 
OCP (e.g., deployed members operating in outside the wire mission sets) will be authorized to wear 
this distinctive uniform/equipment item.) Additionally, firefighters and explosive ordnance disposal 
(EOD) personnel are authorized to wear the two-piece flight duty uniform and their uniform will be 
worn in the same configuration and manner as instructed in DAFI 36-2903, paragraph 9.12. 
(Exception: The firefighter badge will be worn in-lieu of the higher headquarters patch on the left 
sleeve.) 
OCP Coat (Shirt). The coat is worn outside the trousers. Note: Commanders may authorize the coat 
to be tucked in for duty (e.g., Security Forces Airmen) if necessary. The coat will not extend below the 
top of the cargo pocket on the trousers and will not be higher than the bottom of the opening of the 
side (hip) pocket on the trousers. Airmen may roll up sleeves on the OCP coat; however, the cuffs 
will remain visible, and the sleeve will rest at, or within 1-inch of, the forearm when the arm is bent 
at a 90-degree angle. When sleeves are not rolled up, cuffs may remain visible or be folded inward 
twice. Commanders may prohibit rolling of sleeves and folding of cuffs. Patches or badges will not 
be affixed to the front pockets. Alterations that affect the functionality of the uniform are not 
authorized, (e.g., sewing down collars, or pockets). The OCP coat may be removed in the immediate 
work area as determined appropriate by local leadership, however, the OCP coat will be worn while 
interacting with customers or clients. 
Accoutrements. Airmen will wear a basic configuration consisting of name and USAF tapes, 
subdued U.S. Flag, and subdued rank. The Institute of Heraldry will develop or convert only 
organizational emblems to the spice brown color criteria. When authorized by Higher Headquarters 
(HHQ), Commanders and non-unit organizational entities as defined in AFI 38-101, Manpower 
and Organization, such as Directorates, Air Force Elements, Detachments, Commanders Support 
Staff) will develop or convert patches using the spice brown color criteria. Airmen may sew-on or 
use Velcro® backing for nametape, USAF tape, and rank. Tapes and rank must be either all sewn-
on or all Velcro®; Airmen are not authorized to mix sewn-on and Velcro® tapes or rank. Note: 
Occupational badges may be either sewn-on or Velcro® (metal pin on type badges not authorized 
on OCP), if more than one is worn you must sew or Velcro® all badges. Only Velcro® patches 
are authorized on the left and right sleeves of the OCP coat. An OCP Velcro® sleeve pen/pencil 
holder may be worn on either sleeve but will not impede the proper wear of required patches and/or 
duty badges. 
Spice brown rank insignia is mandatory for all personnel. (Exceptions: No rank required for 
airmen basic rank). First lieutenant and lieutenant colonel rank insignia will be black. (Note: GOs 
wear 3/4-inch diameter stars. 
Name and USAF tapes are mandatory for all Air Force personnel and will be spice brown block 
lettering embroidery on the OCP background. 
Badges and Commander’s Insignia Pin. 
A maximum of four occupational, qualification and/or skill badges may be worn centered above 
the USAF tape using spice brown embroidery on the OCP background. If earned and authorized, 
sister services’ badges will maintain their subdued color(s) when worn as not to lose their 
distinction as being awarded from a sister service. Wear of current Air Force occupational badge(s) 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025

are mandatory if sister services’ badges are worn. 
When one badge is worn, it is centered 1/2-inch above the U.S. Air Force Tape. 
When two badges are worn, the first is centered 1/2-inch above the U.S. Air Force tape, the second 
badge will be centered 1/2-inch above the first badge. 
When three badges are worn, they are centered 1/8-inch above the U.S. Air Force tape either in a 
single vertical column with 1/4-inch between badges; or two badges are worn side by side, 1/8-
inch above and centered on the U.S. Air Force tape with 1/2-inch between badges horizontally, and 
the third badge is centered on the U.S. Air Force tape 1/4-inch above the lower two badges (see 
Figure 23.29).

detailed, or activated in support of sister service units or joint organizations may wear the sister 
service’s or joint organization’s organizational badges/patches in accordance with their respective 
wear instructions. Sister service and joint organization badges/patches can be worn in their current 
color configuration and will not be converted to the spice brown color criteria. Additionally, 
Airmen assigned to Department of Air Force organizations that support both Air and Space Force 
are permitted to wear both Air Force spice brown and Space Force full color organization patches. 
Award criteria for other Services’ qualification badges will be in accordance with awarding 
Service’s directives. Temporary qualification badges are not authorized for wear on the uniform.

23.29. Establishing a New Occupational Badge, Patch or Tab. 
Criteria for authority to wear existing badges is determined by the issuing functional communities. 
Modifications to existing functional badges/patches and/or creation of new functional 
badges/patches are submitted by the functional communities. Modifications to existing, and 
creation of new badges/patches must be coordinated with the Air Force Military Force 
Management Directorate (AF/A1P). 
Process to propose creation of a new occupational badge, duty badge, or graduate patch. Reference 
DAFI 36-2903, paragraph 5.1.6.2.4 through 5.1.6.2.4.1 for the justification required to request a

AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
538 
 
 
 
The functional community must submit their preliminary design to the Institute of Heraldry. 
The Institute of Heraldry will review the proposed design to ensure 1) there is no encroachment 
on existing designs, 2) conformity with textile or metal manufacturing standards, and 3) develop 
a cost estimate. The Institute of Heraldry will not provide final design or manufacturing 
drawings until the insignia concept is approved. 
After the Institute of Heraldry provides their preliminary review/comments on the proposed 
design, the responsible functional community prepares a staff summary sheet and coordinates 
the package with other functional communities who will be authorized to wear the new badge, 
or patch. 
Staff package is then coordinated through AF/A1P, AF/A1, CMSAF and the Assistant Secretary 
of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR), and finally approved by the 
CSAF. 
Upon approval, the staff package will be returned to the functional organization requesting the 
new badge or patch and a copy will be sent to the Institute of Heraldry who will begin the 
development process. 
Funding. 
The development cost of the new badge, patch or tab will be funded by the organization 
requesting the applicable item. 
AF/A1 will fund SecAF and CSAF directed badge, patch or tab development and changes. 
Functional communities proposing a new occupational badge, duty badge, or graduate patch, or 
changes to their existing badge or patch will fund all costs associated with proposed design and 
development. Organizations will submit a DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase 
Request, to the Institute of Heraldry for the amount required for initial development. 
Duty Identifier Patches/Tabs. 
MAJCOMS and/or Functional communities may request the creation of a new duty identifier 
patch/tab on an annual basis. New patch/tab requests should follow guidance as outlined in 
DAFI 36-2903, paragraphs 12.7.3.1 through 12.7.3.4. Note: Identifier tabs differ from patches; 
a tab’s design includes a small arch e.g., “AIR ADVISOR”, “RAVEN” signifying a special, 
unique qualification and/or training. 
Request is coordinated through AF/A1P, CMSAF and to AF/A1 for final decision. 
Existing duty identifier patches/tabs will be re-validated on an annual basis by AFCFMs, in 
coordination with A1PA. 
Wear guidance is outlined in DAFI 36-2903, paragraph 5.1.6.2.3. 
Functional communities proposing new badge, patch or tab development, or changes to their 
existing badge, patch or tab will fund all costs associated with proposed design and 
development. Organizations submit a DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase

23.31. Foreign Decorations. Foreign decorations are those proffered by foreign governments such 
as ribbons, medal devices, badges, sashes, or neck-type decorations. DAFMAN 36-2806, specifies 
how to accept foreign decorations, the authority required for award acceptance by Air Force members, 
and some wear instructions. Upon approval, foreign decoration wear criteria depend on the type of 
device the decoration represents. Note: Also see DAFMAN 36-2806 for wear policy that may apply 
to Airman’s specific decoration. 
Wear sash, sunburst, or neck-type foreign decorations with the formal dress uniform only, 
according to the customs of the awarding nation. Wear only one type at a time.

Figure 23.63 Ribbon Arrangement of Ribbons (Other arrangements authorized as needed) 
23.34. Description of Medals and Ribbons. 
Miniature medals are approximately 1/2 the size of regular medals. Note: The Medal of Honor is 
always regular size. Regular-size ribbons are 1 3/8 x 3/8-inches and miniature ribbons are 11/16 x 
3/8-inches. 
Affix ribbons to the uniform using a detachable, metal, or plastic clip device. Keep ribbons clean 
and unfrayed. Ribbons will not have a visible protective coating. There is no space between the 
rows of ribbons. 
23.35.  Devices on Medals and Ribbons. Wear a maximum of four devices on each ribbon. 
Wear regular devices on regular medals and regular ribbons. Wear miniature devices on miniature 
medals and miniature ribbons. Wear all the same size devices. 
Replace the bronze device with a silver device after receipt of the fifth bronze device. 
Place silver devices to the wearer’s right of bronze devices. 
Place clusters horizontally and tilt slightly downward to the wearer’s right to allow maximum 
number of clusters and other devices on the ribbon. Tilt all or none. 
On medals, place clusters vertically with silver clusters and stars above similar bronze devices. 
If all authorized devices do not fit on a single ribbon, wear a second ribbon. Wear a minimum of 
three devices on the first ribbon before wearing a second ribbon. When wearing the second ribbon, 
place after the initial ribbon (on wearer’s left). Both ribbons count for one award. If future awards 
reduce devices to a single ribbon, remove the second ribbon. 
Methods of affixing devices on medals and ribbons. 
A Separate Device. When affixing separate devices to a ribbon, center device and space equally. 
Single-constructed devices (two or more devices manufactured together). If using single-
constructed device on one ribbon, use same size device on all ribbons. Separate devices if the 
combination of devices authorized is not available as a single- constructed device. In this event, 
place the device close to one another so they give the appearance of a single-constructed device 
as long as the devices are the same, i.e., bronze cluster and silver cluster. 
Wear Only Separate Devices on Medals. Wear maximum of four unless wearing more

24.1.  Honor and Tradition 
Military customs and courtesies are proven traditions, deep-rooted in culture that reflect pride in 
military service to our nation. Expectations for acts of respect and courtesy have evolved from the 
need for order and discipline, to generating an environment of respect and sense of fraternity that 
exists among military personnel. While not all-inclusive, this chapter highlights many of the 
customs and courtesies that play an extremely important role in building morale, esprit de corps, 
discipline, and mission effectiveness. As stated in AFI 1-1, our customs and courtesies reflect the 
unique nature of our profession and guide significant aspects of our behavior. Customs and 
courtesies emphasize our strong bond with other military members as well as our mutual respect 
for one another and our civilian leadership. 
24.2. Protocol 
Protocol is an internationally recognized system of courtesy and respect involving a set of rules 
for behavior in official life and in ceremonies involving governments, nations, and their 
representatives. Protocol for the military and government agencies is a code of traditional 
precedence, courtesy, and etiquette in matters of military, diplomatic, official, and celebratory 
ceremonies. In modern practice, military protocol encompasses the knowledge, accumulation, and 
application of established service customs by combining the traditional codes of conduct with 
contemporary etiquette and courtesy. Executive orders, presidential proclamations, USAF 
instructions, and other service-associated sources provide specific guidance on protocol and 
customs and courtesies. DAFI 90-1202 Protocol, is a very good source for detailed information 
regarding a wide range of military customs and courtesies and decorum. 
24.3. Base Honor Guard Program 
Base Honor Guard is a mandatory USAF program, under the responsibility of installation 
commanders, which emphasizes the importance of military customs and courtesies, dress and 
appearance, and drill and ceremonies. The first base honor guard was activated within the 1100th 
Air Police Squadron, Bolling Field, Washington D.C., and was responsible for maintaining a 
USAF ceremonial capability in the National Capital Region. The primary mission of today’s base 
honor guard program is to employ, equip, and train USAF members to provide professional 
military funeral honors for active service members, retired members, and veterans of the U. S. Air 
Force. Members are usually volunteers from the installation host and tenant units, with selections 
generally coming from Airman Basic to Technical Sergeant. Note: In January of 2000, public law 
was implemented, providing for all veterans to receive, at a minimum, a funeral ceremony that 
includes the folding of a United States flag, presentation of the flag to the veteran’s family, and the 
playing of Taps. 
24.4. Symbolism and Representation 
Military tradition and patriotism are steeped in symbolism, often honored in ceremonies, and 
represented in many forms. Some of the ways the United States and the USAF are represented 
include symbols, such as the United States flag and its colors, songs, official seals, and other 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
544 
 
 
 
nationally recognized objects. 
24.5. National Anthem 
The United States national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner, is often played or sung at official 
and unofficial ceremonies and events. It is important to understand the appropriate protocols and 
procedures for showing proper respects for the national anthem. See Attachment 9, The Star- 
Spangled Banner Lyrics, for all four verses of the national anthem. When the bugle call, To the 
Colors, is played, the same respects are shown as rendered to the national anthem. 
National Anthem Outdoors. When outdoors, during the rendition of the national anthem, Airmen 
in uniform should render the military salute at the first note of the anthem and retain this position 
until the last note of music has played. When outdoors during rendition of the national anthem, all 
present in civilian attire should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. 
Members not in uniform should remove their headgear with their right hand and hold it at the left 
shoulder, the hand being over the heart. 
National Anthem in Vehicles. When on USAF installations, during the playing of The Star- 
Spangled Banner or To the Colors, vehicles in motion will pull to the side of the road and stop (if 
consistent with safety and mission requirements). Individuals in vehicles should sit quietly until the 
last note of music has played. 
National Anthem Indoors. When indoors, in uniform, in formation, with appropriate headgear, 
military members should render the military salute during the national anthem. When indoors, in 
uniform, without headgear, military members should stand and remain at the position of attention 
without rendering the military salute. Civilians should remove any headgear and stand at attention 
with their right hand over their heart. If the flag is not displayed, those present should face toward 
the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed. 
National Anthems of Friendly Foreign Nations. Anthems of friendly foreign nations may be 
played to honor visitors of foreign nations as a show of respect. The same respect is shown to 
foreign national anthems as is shown to The Star-Spangled Banner. Typically, foreign national 
anthems are played before the national anthem of a host nation, but there is no regulation or law 
mandating when or in what order national anthems are played when more than one is played. 
24.6. The Pledge of Allegiance 
The Pledge of Allegiance is not traditionally recited at military events. At outdoor events or social 
functions where the pledge is rendered, military personnel in uniform will stand at attention, remain 
silent, face the flag, and salute. When outdoors in civilian attire, remove any non-religious headgear 
with right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, with the hand being over the heart. At indoor events, 
military personnel in uniform will stand at attention, remain silent, face the flag, but will not salute; 
however, at indoor events where participants are primarily civilians or in civilian attire, reciting 
the Pledge of Allegiance is optional for those in uniform. When indoors in civilian attire, stand at 
attention, face the flag, place your right hand over your heart, and recite the pledge. 
24.7. DAF Seal 
As shown in Figure 24.1., the official Air Force colors of ultramarine blue and Air Force yellow 
are reflected in the DAF Seal. The circular background is ultramarine blue, and the trim is Air Force 
yellow. The 13 white stars represent the original 13 colonies. The Air Force yellow numerals under 
the shield stand for 1947, the year the DAF was established. The band encircling the whole design 
is white, edged in Air Force yellow, with black lettering reading “Department of the Air Force” on 
the top and “United States of America” on the bottom. Centered on the circular background is the 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
545 
 
 
 
DAF Coat of Arms, consisting of the crest and shield. 
Coat of Arms – Crest. The crest portion of the Coat of Arms 
consists of the eagle, wreath, and cloud form. The American 
bald eagle symbolizes the United States airpower and appears 
in natural colors. The wreath under the eagle is made up of six 
alternate folds of metal in white (representing silver) and light 
blue. This repeats the metal and color used in the shield. The 
white clouds behind the eagle denote the start of a new sky. 
Coat of Arms – Shield. The shield portion of the Coat of Arms, 
directly below the eagle, wreath, and cloud, is divided 
horizontally into two parts by a nebular line representing clouds. 
The top part bears an Air Force yellow thunderbolt with flames in natural color that shows striking 
power through the use of aerospace. The thunderbolt consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist 
with three natural color flames on each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight lightning 
bolts. The background at the top of the shield is light blue representing the sky. The background 
at the lower part is white representing metal silver. 
Authorized and Unauthorized Uses of the DAF Seal and Coat of Arms. The DAF Seal is to be 
protected from unauthorized use. Falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, altering, or 
knowingly using or possessing the Seal with fraudulent intent, is punishable by law. AFMAN 33- 
326, Preparing Official Communications, Attachment 2, outlines the authorized users and uses of 
the DAF Seal and the Coat of Arms. 
24.8. Official Air Force Symbol 
The Air Force Symbol, as shown in Figure 24.2., was designated 
the official symbol of the USAF on 5 May 2004. The upper half 
includes the stylized wings, which represent the stripes of our 
strength—our enlisted men and women. Below the stylized 
wings, the lower half includes a sphere, a star, and three 
diamonds. The Air Force Symbol honors the heritage of our past 
and represents the promise of our future. Furthermore, it retains 
the core elements of our Air Corps heritage with respect to the 
bent up, rather than straight “Arnold” wings, and a star with the 
circle. The current Symbol modernizes these core elements to 
reflect our Air Force of today and tomorrow. All of the elements come together to form one symbol 
that presents two powerful images—an eagle, the emblem of our nation, and a medal, representing 
valor in service to our nation. 
Stylized Wings. The wings are drawn with great angularity to emphasize our swiftness and power. 
The six sections of the wings represent our distinctive capabilities—air and space superiority, 
global attack, rapid global mobility, precision engagement, information superiority, and agile 
combat support. 
Sphere. The sphere within the star represents the globe and symbolically reminds us of our 
obligation to secure our nation’s freedom with global vigilance, reach, and power. The sphere also 
reminds us of our challenge as an expeditionary force to respond rapidly to crises and to provide 
decisive air and space power worldwide. 
Star. The area surrounding the sphere takes the shape of a star. The star has many meanings. The 
five points of the star represent the components of our one force and family—our RegAF, civilians,

Guard, Reserve, and retirees. The star symbolizes space as the high ground of our nation’s Air 
Force. The rallying symbol in all our wars, the star also represents our officer corps, central to our 
combat leadership. 
Three Diamonds. The star is framed with three diamonds that represent our core values—Integrity 
First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do.

The Air Force Song 
In the late 1930’s, the Air Corps sought an official song to reflect its unique identity. After 
reviewing over 700 compositions, music instructor Robert Crawford’s song was a unanimous 
winner. The U.S. Army band made the first recordings of the song in 1939, titled The U.S. Air 
Force. According to DAFI 90-1202 when the Air Force song is played, Airmen will stand at 
attention, but are allowed to sing the lyrics of the song. During official events, the official party 
may move to depart after the playing of the first verse. See Attachment 8, The U.S. Air Force 
lyrics, for all four verses of song.

24.10. Showing Respect for the Flag 
The United States flag is one of the most enduring and sacred symbols of our country. It represents 
the principles and ideals Airmen have pledged to defend, and for which many have made the 
ultimate sacrifice. Airmen shall treat it with respect similar to that shown to the highest military 
and public officials. Several laws, practices, and traditions are associated with the flag. The Title 
4 United States Code, Flag and Seal, Seat of Government, and the States; Title 10 United States 
Code, Armed Forces; and Title 36 United States Code, Patriotic and National Observances, 
Ceremonies, and Organizations, pertain to proper display and respect for the flag. 
24.11. History of United States Flag 
There is no official meaning for the folds of the flag, and according to DAFI 90-1202 there is no 
official flag folding script. Although various national interest groups hold flag folding ceremonies, 
they are not official. A narrative is provided in Figure 24.3. to highlight significant historical 
information regarding the United States flag. It is not for official ceremonial use. 
For more than 200 years, the American flag has been the symbol of our nation’s unity, as well as a source of pride 
and inspiration for millions of citizens. Born on June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress determined that 
the flag of the United States be 13 stripes, alternating between seven red and six white; and that the union be 13 
stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation. 
Between 1777 and 1960, the shape and design of the flag evolved into the flag presented before you today. The 13 
horizontal stripes represent the original 13 colonies, while the stars represent the 50 states of the Union. The colors 
of the flag are symbolic as well; red symbolizes hardiness and valor; white signifies purity and innocence; and blue 
represents vigilance, perseverance, and justice. Traditionally, a symbol of liberty, the American flag has carried the 
message of freedom, and inspired Americans, both at home and abroad. 
In 1814, Francis Scott Key was so moved at seeing the Stars and Stripes waving after the British shelling of 
Baltimore’s Fort McHenry that he wrote the words to The Star-Spangled Banner. In 1892 the flag inspired Francis 
Bellamy to write the “Pledge of Allegiance,” our most famous flag salute and patriotic oath. In July 1969 the 
American flag was flown in space when Neil Armstrong planted it on the surface of the moon. 
Today, our flag flies on constellations of Air Force satellites that circle our globe, and on the fin flash of our aircraft 
in harm’s way in every corner of the world. Indeed, it flies in the heart of every Airman who serves our great nation. 
The sun never sets on our USAF, nor on the flag we so proudly cherish. Since 1776, no generation of Americans 
has been spared the responsibility of defending freedom… Today’s Airmen remain committed to preserving the 
freedom that others won for us for generations to come. 
By displaying the flag and giving it a distinctive fold, we show respect to the flag and express our gratitude to those 
individuals who fought, and continue to fight for freedom, at home and abroad. Since the dawn of the 20th century, 
Airmen have proudly flown the flag in every major conflict, on lands and skies around the world. It is their 
responsibility…our responsibility…to continue to protect and preserve the rights, privileges, and freedoms we, as 
Americans, enjoy today. 
The United States flag represents who we are. It stands for the freedom we all share and the pride and patriotism 
we feel for our country. We cherish its legacy as a beacon of hope to one and all. Long may it wave.

24.12. Types of Flags 
There are specific sizes, types, and occasions for proper display of the United States flag. 
Understanding the significance of each of these types of flags will ensure its proper display. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
548 
 
 
 
Installation Flag. The installation flag is lightweight nylon bunting material, 8 feet 11 3/8 inches 
by 17 feet, and is only displayed in fair weather from an installation flagstaff. This is the typical 
flag used at USAF installations. 
All-Purpose Flag. The all-purpose flag is made of rayon bunting material, 3 feet by 4 feet. This 
size can be used for outdoor display with flags of friendly foreign nations, in arrival ceremonies 
for international dignitaries, or to indicate joint occupancy of a building by two or more countries. 
All-Purpose (All-Weather) Storm Flag. The all-purpose, all-weather storm flag is a lightweight 
nylon bunting material, 5 feet by 9 feet 6 inches. Use this size as an alternate for the installation 
flag in inclement weather. 
Ceremonial Flag. The ceremonial flag is rayon or synthetic substitute material, 4 feet 4 inches by 
5 feet 6 inches, trimmed on three edges with yellow rayon fringe 2 inches wide. 
Organizational Flag. The organizational flag is rayon or synthetic substitute material and is 3 feet 
by 4 feet. This flag is trimmed on three edges with rayon fringe 2 inches wide. 
Retirement Flag. The retirement flag may be either 3 feet by 4 feet or 3 feet by 5 feet. Members 
retiring from the USAF are entitled to presentation of a United States flag. For details, refer to 
DAFMAN 65-605, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Technical Procedures, on using Organization 
& Maintenance funds for this purchase. 
Garrison Flag. The garrison flag is 20 feet by 38 feet. This flag is flown on holidays and special 
occasions and can be substituted with the installation flag. 
Interment Flag. The interment flag is 5 feet by 9 feet 6 inches of cotton material. The interment 
flag is authorized for deceased military personnel and for deceased veterans. This is the size flag 
used to drape over a closed casket. Note: To receive an interment flag from the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, fill out VA Form 27-2008, Application for U.S. Flag for Burial Purposes, 
available online at: https://www.cem.va.gov/burial_benefits/burial_flags.asp. 
24.13. Display of the United States Flag 
Sunrise to Sunset. The universal custom is to display the United States flag only from sunrise to 
sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, when a patriotic effect is 
desired, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of 
darkness. All other flags should also be illuminated when displayed with the United States flag. 
Locations. USAF installations are authorized to fly one installation flag from reveille to retreat, 
normally on a flagstaff placed in front of the installation headquarters, and additional flagstaffs 
and flags are authorized adjacent to each dependent school on the installation. The flag should be 
displayed daily on or near the main administration building of every public institution; it should 
also be displayed during school days in or near every schoolhouse. 
Holidays. The United States flag should be displayed on all days as may be proclaimed by the 
U.S. President, the birthdays of states (date of admission), and on state holidays. It should also be 
displayed on the following national holidays.

24.14. Position and Manner of Display 
The United States flag is always displayed on a stage or in a parade on its own right. In other 
words, for an audience looking at a stage, the flag is on the audience’s left. When displaying the 
flag, the union (the white stars on the blue field) is displayed at the uppermost, right side of the 
flag itself. Figure 24.4. is provided as an example for proper display of the United States flag in 
various situations and configurations. 
Carried in Procession with Another Flag. As a rule of thumb, when the United States flag is 
displayed or carried in a procession with another flag or flags, it should be either on the right of all 
others, or in front of and centered ahead of other flags, if there is a line of other flags in the same 
procession. 
Displayed with Crossed Staffs. When the United States flag is displayed with another flag against 
a wall from crossed staffs, it should be on the right, the flag’s own right (the observer’s left), and 
the staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag. 
Radiating from a Central Point. When the United States flag is flown with a number of flags 
displayed from staffs radiating from a central point, and no foreign flags are in the display, the 
United States flag will be in the center and at the highest point of the group. 
Projecting from a Building. When the United States flag is displayed from a staff projecting 
horizontally or at an angle from the windowsill, balcony, or front of a building, the union of the 
flag should be placed at the peak of the staff. 
In a Row or Line with Equal Height. When the United States flag is flown with a number of 
flags displayed from staffs set in a line, all staffs will be of the same height and same finial. The 
United States flag will be on the right side of the group (the observer’s left). 
In a Row or Line with Elevated Height. When no foreign national flags are involved in the 
display, the United States flag may be placed at the center of the line and displayed at a higher 
level than the other flags in the display. 
Displayed with One or More Nations. When the United States flag is displayed with one or more 
other nations, they are flown from separate staffs of the same height. The flags should be of equal 
size. In most cases, member country flags are displayed in a line, alphabetically, with the United 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
550 
 
 
 
States flag at its own right (the observer’s left). 
Displayed on a Staff near a Speaker’s Platform. When displayed from a staff in a church or 
public auditorium, the United States flag should hold the position of superior prominence and the 
position of honor at the clergyman’s or speaker’s right as he or she faces the audience. Any other 
flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker, or to the right of the 
audience. 
Displayed Vertically. When displayed from a building, a window, or over the middle of a street, 
the United States flag should be suspended vertically with the union to the uppermost and the flag’s 
own right, that is, to the observer’s left (north on an east and west street, or east on a north and 
south street). This also applies when the flag is suspended from the main entrance of a building or 
hangar. 
Displayed Horizontally. When displayed horizontally against a wall or when displayed behind a 
speaker’s platform, the union of the United States flag should be uppermost and to the flag’s own 
right (the observer’s left). When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same 
way, with the union to the observer’s left. 
Displayed on a Closed Casket. On a closed casket, place the United States flag lengthwise with 
the union at the head and over the left shoulder of the deceased. Do not lower the flag into the 
grave, and do not allow the flag to touch the ground. The interment flag may be given to the next 
of kin at the conclusion of the interment. 
Displayed at Half-Staff. The term “half-staff” means the position of the United States flag when 
it is one-half the distance between the top and bottom of the staff. All flags displayed with the 
United States flag are flown at half-staff when the United States flag is flown at half-staff, with the 
exception of foreign national flags, unless the foreign country has granted permission for their flag 
to also be at half-staff. Within the USAF, the installation commander may direct that the United 
States flag be flown at half-staff on occasions when it is considered proper and appropriate. When 
flown at half-staff, the flag shall be first hoisted to the peak for an instant, and then lowered to the 
half-staff. The flag should be raised to the peak position before lowering at the end of the day.

24.15. Care and Respect for the United States Flag 
Some acts for showing proper respect for the United States flag include: 
When in uniform, salute the United States flag six paces before it passes in a procession or parade 
and hold the salute until it has passed six paces. 
Regimental colors, state flags, and organizational or institutional flags are always dipped as a 
mark of respect to the United States flag. The USAF flag and organizational flags may be dipped 
as appropriate. The United States flag will not be dipped to any person or thing, and at no time 
will a foreign national flag be dipped. 
The United States flag should never be displayed with union down, except as a signal of dire 
distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property. 
The United States flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, floor, water, 
or merchandise. The United States flag should never be used to cover for a statue or monument. 
The United States flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free. 
The United States flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. The United 
States flag should never be festooned, drawn back or up, or in folds, but always allowed to fall 
freely. 
The United States flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as 
to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged. 
The United States flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling. 
The United States flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it, 
any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature. 
The United States flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or 
delivering anything. 
The United States flag should never be used for advertising purposes. Advertising signs should 
not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the United States flag is flown. 
The United States flag should never be printed or embroidered on such articles as cushions, 
handkerchiefs, paper napkins, boxes, or anything that is designed for temporary use. 
The United States flag should not be displayed on a float in a parade, except from a staff. 
The United States flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle, 
railroad train, or boat. 
No part of the United States flag should be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a 
United States flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, 
policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. 
A United States flag lapel pin, being a replica of the flag, should be worn on the left lapel near 
the heart. 
No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right (observer’s 
left) of the United States flag, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at 
sea when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for the 
personnel of the Navy. 
Exercise extreme care to ensure proper handling and cleaning of soiled flags. When the United 
States flag is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, it should be 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
553 
 
 
 
destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning. There may be instances when a flag is 
retired from service and preserved because of its historical significance. Disposition instructions 
should be obtained from the proper authority, such as the installation honor guard or protocol 
office. 
A folded flag is considered cased; therefore, a salute is not necessary. 
24.16. Service Flags 
In accordance with Title 10 United States Code, Armed Forces, service flags will be displayed by 
order of service date, with the most senior service flags being given the position of honor on the 
far right. Service flags will be displayed in the following order of precedence from their own right 
or the observer’s left: National Guard (13 December 1635), U.S. Army (14 June 1775), U.S. Navy 
(13 October 1775), U.S. Marine (10 November 1775), U.S. Coast Guard (4 August 1790), U.S. Air 
Force (18 September 1947), and U.S. Space Force (20 December 2019). 
Following the service flags, the order of precedence of flags is as follows: North American 
Aerospace Defense, U.S. Space Command, major commands (in alphabetical order), field 
operating agencies, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, direct reporting units, Numbered Air 
Forces, and wings (in descending order), and personal/position (using branch appropriate flags).

24.17. Showing Respect for Individuals 
Respect, consideration, manners, common sense, and politeness are all ways of demonstrating 
common acts of courtesy. Common acts of courtesy that contribute to a positive, professional 
working environment include simple things like saying “please” and “thank you” and respecting 
other people’s time. When in the workplace, being helpful, taking and delivering messages, and 
offering assistance, when possible, are demonstrations of consideration for others. All USAF 
personnel should demonstrate common acts of courtesy while on- and off-duty. 
Distinguished Visitors. Certain individuals who are considered distinguished visitors (DV) are 
often afforded particular courtesies as a matter of respect, as well as tradition. A DV may be defined 
as any: (1) General or Flag Officer; (2) government official with rank equivalent to a Brigadier 
General or higher; (3) foreign military officer or civilian designated a DV by the Under Secretary 
of the Air Force for International Affairs; or (4) visitor or group designated by the commander. 
Persons in certain positions may be given DV status as designated by the commander. A DV visit is 
an important event and should be given close attention to detail. Review DAFI 90-1202 and 
AFPAM 34-1202, Guide to Protocol, and contact the installation protocol office for further 
guidance on responsibilities and proper procedures for DVs. 
24.18. Position of Honor 
Junior personnel shall employ a courteous and respectful bearing toward senior personnel. Give 
the senior person, enlisted, or commissioned, the position of honor on the right when walking, 
riding, or sitting. The junior person takes the position to the senior’s left. 
Entering or Exiting an Area. Unless told otherwise or impractical, rise and stand at attention 
when a senior official enters or departs a room. If more than one person is present, the person who 
first sees the officer calls the area to attention. An exception to this is when an officer is already in 
the room who is equal to or has a higher rank than the officer entering the room. In that case, do 
not call the room to attention. 
Entering or Exiting Vehicles. Military personnel enter automobiles and small boats in reverse 
order of rank. Juniors will enter a vehicle first and take their appropriate seat on the senior’s left. 
The senior officer will be the last to enter the vehicle and the first to exit. 
24.19. Ranks, Titles, and Terms of Address 
Military personnel are addressed by the rank associated with their grade or title. While all USAF 
personnel are Airmen, it is appropriate to address officers by their grade, such as Lieutenant 
Colonel, and enlisted members by their grade, such as Master Sergeant. It is also acceptable to 
address enlisted members relative to their tier, such as Airman, Sergeant, Senior, Chief, as 
appropriate. USAF members may also be addressed as “Sir” or “Ma’am.” Chaplains may be 
addressed as Chaplain or by their ecclesiastical title. 
Respect for Civilians. Civilians and civil service employees should be addressed appropriately as 
“Mr.,” “Mrs.,” “Miss,” or “Ms.,” and their last name. Also, using “Sir” or “Ma’am” is appropriate. 
Respect for Retirees. Retirees are entitled to the same respect and courtesies as active military 
members. They will be addressed by their retired grade on all official records and official 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
555 
 
 
 
correspondence, except for correspondence and other matters relating to a retiree’s civilian 
employment. Refer to AFI 36-3106, Retiree Activities Program, for additional details. 
Respect for Uniformed Forces and Other Services. Extend military courtesies to members of 
other uniformed forces, other services, and friendly foreign nations. Pay the same respect to the 
national anthems and flags of other nations as rendered the United States national anthem and flag. 
While not necessary to learn the identifying insignia of the military grades of all nations, you 
should learn the ranks, grades, and insignia of the most frequently contacted nations, particularly 
during an overseas assignment or deployment. 
24.20. Rendering the Salute 
Saluting is a courtesy exchanged between members of the U.S. Armed Forces as both a greeting 
and a symbol of mutual respect. The salute is an expression of recognition for one another as 
members of the profession of arms; representing a personal commitment of self-sacrifice to 
preserve the American way of life. Salutes are appropriate to the U.S. President, Vice President, 
Secretary of Defense, Service Secretaries, all superior commissioned and warrant officers, all 
Medal of Honor recipients, and superior officers of friendly foreign nations. A salute is also 
rendered as a sign of respect to the United States flag and during official ceremonies, as covered 
in this chapter. 
Saluting Uniformed Forces and Other Services. Salutes will be exchanged between officers 
(commissioned and warrant), and enlisted personnel of the U.S. Armed Forces. Salutes will also 
be exchanged between U.S. Armed Forces personnel and the Uniformed Services of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Public Health Service, as appropriate. 
Saluting Protocol. When a salute is exchanged among individuals, the junior member always 
salutes the senior member first. The junior member should initiate the salute in time to allow the 
senior officer to return it. To prescribe an exact distance for all circumstances is not practical; 
however, good judgment should dictate when salutes are exchanged. While any Airman (enlisted 
or officer) recognizing a need to salute or a need to return a salute may do so anywhere at any time, 
there are circumstances when saluting may or may not be practical or warranted. 
Indoors. Salutes are not rendered indoors, except for formal reporting. When reporting to an 
officer indoors, knock once, enter when told to do so, march to approximately two paces from the 
officer or desk, halt, salute, and report, “Sir (Ma’am), (rank and last name) reports as ordered,” or 
“Sir (Ma’am), (rank and last name) reports.” When the conversation is completed, execute a sharp 
salute, hold the salute until the officer acknowledges the salute, perform the appropriate facing 
movement, and depart. 
Outdoors. When outdoors (outside of a building, on a porch, a covered sidewalk, an entryway, a 
reviewing stand, or at a bus stop) the salute will be exchanged. This applies both on and off military 
installations. 
When Carrying Items. Individuals carrying articles in both hands (unable to be transferred to the 
left hand) need not initiate or return the salute when impractical, but should nod or offer a verbal 
greeting, acknowledging the appropriateness of a salute. 
In Formation. When in formation, members do not salute or return a salute unless given the 
command to do so. The person in charge of the formation salutes and acknowledges salutes for 
those in the formation. 
In a Work Detail. When in a work detail, individual workers do not salute. The person in charge 
of the detail salutes for those in the detail. 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
556 
 
 
 
In Groups. When in groups, when a senior officer approaches, the first individual noticing the 
officer calls the group to attention. All members face the officer and salute. If the officer addresses 
an individual or the group, all remain at attention (unless otherwise ordered) until the end of the 
conversation, at which time they salute the officer. 
Public Gatherings. When attending public gatherings, such as sporting events, meetings, or when 
a salute would be inappropriate or impractical, salutes between individuals are not required. 
In Vehicles. Exchange of salutes between members in moving military vehicles is not mandatory. 
For pedestrians, when officer passengers are readily identifiable (for example, officers in 
appropriately marked staff vehicles), the salute must be rendered. This includes the U.S. President, 
the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, Service Secretaries, and senior officers in vehicles when 
distinguished by vehicle plates and/or flags. 
In Civilian Attire. Persons in uniform may salute civilians or senior military members in civilian 
clothes upon recognition. 
At “No Salute” Areas. Saluting is not required in areas designated as “no salute” areas. 
In Physical Training Gear. Saluting individuals due to rank recognition is not required when 
wearing the physical training gear but may be expected during specified academic training 
environments. When outdoors in physical training gear, Airmen are required to salute during 
reveille and retreat. 
At Military Funerals / Memorials. When at a military funeral or memorial in uniform, salute the 
caisson or hearse as it passes and the casket as it is carried past. Also, salute during the firing of 
volleys and the playing of Taps. Note: Many installations across the USAF play Taps to signify 
“lights out” at the end of the day. For these purposes, the salute is not required.

24.21. Military Ceremonies 
The USAF has many different types of ceremonies that are unique customs of our military 
profession, many of them held in honor of significant events throughout a member’s career. 
Official military ceremonies include promotions, changes and assumptions of command, 
activations and in-activations, re-designations, enlistments and reenlistments, awards, decorations, 
arrivals, departures, reveille, retreat, building dedications, ribbon cuttings, retirements, and 
funerals. Some are very formal and elaborate, while others are quite simple and personal. 
24.22. Event Planning and Preparation 
All events begin with planning. Consideration should always be given to the nature and sequence 
of the event, scheduling, guests, and budget. To give guests time to plan, aim at having details 
planned out at least three weeks in advance, or more. In such cases, planning committees will need 
to begin meeting and discussing details of the event far in advance of the invitations being sent 
out. This could mean, depending on the size and scope of the event, planning as early as several 
months to a year in advance. Because ceremonies are often steeped in tradition, there are almost 
always resources available for helping planners get started. Rather than starting from scratch, reach 
out to other organizations or review checklists from previous events to help get things started. 
24.23. Parades and Honors Arrivals or Departures 
Ceremonies, such as parades, honor cordons, motorcades, and other ceremonies that involve large 
numbers of Airmen and resources, may be held when officials entitled to such honors visit military 
installations. Full honors are reserved for statutory appointees and General or Flag Officers, foreign 
dignitaries, and occasions when ceremonies promote international good will. The installation 
commander determines which types of honors are rendered. 
Award Ceremony. An award ceremony affords an opportunity to recognize a member’s 
accomplishments. The commander or other official determines whether to present an award at a 
formal ceremony or to present it informally. Many units present awards during commander’s call. 
Because there are no specific guidelines for an award presentation, commanders and supervisors 
must ensure the presentation method reflects the significance of the award. 
Decoration Ceremony. Decoration ceremonies formally recognize service members for 
meritorious service, outstanding achievement, or heroism. Formal and dignified decoration 
ceremonies preserve the integrity and value of decorations. When possible, commanders should 
personally present decorations. Regardless of where the presentation is conducted, the ceremony 
is conducted at the earliest possible date after approval of the decoration. All military participants 
and attendees should wear the uniform specified by the host. 
Promotion Ceremony. Promotions are significant events in the lives of military people. 
Commanders and supervisors are responsible for ensuring their personnel receive proper 
recognition. Many of the guidelines for promotion ceremonies are the same as for decoration 
ceremonies. Because most promotions are effective the first day of the month, the promotion 
ceremony is customarily conducted on the last duty day before the promotion effective date. Some 
bases hold a base-wide promotion for all promotees, while other bases prefer to recognize 
promotees within their organizations.

Reenlistment Ceremony. Unit commanders will honor all reenlistees through a dignified 
reenlistment ceremony. Airmen may request any commissioned officer to perform the ceremony 
and may invite guests. The member’s immediate family should be invited to reinforce the 
recognition that when a member makes a commitment to the USAF, the family is also making a 
commitment. The ceremony may be conducted in any place that lends dignity to the event. The 
United States flag has traditionally served, and should be used when available, as a backdrop for 
reenlistment ceremonies. Reenlistees and officers administering the oath must wear an authorized 
uniform for the ceremony, unless the officer performing the reenlistment is retired, then the 
uniform requirement for the reenlisting officer is optional. DAF policy concerning reenlistments 
is found in DAFI 36-2606, Reenlistment and Extension of Enlistment in the United States Air 
Force.  
24.24. Oaths 
At the core of the ceremony is the oath. The oath is recited by the officer and repeated by the 
reenlistee. The reenlistee and the officer administering the oath must be physically collocated 
during the ceremony. The officer, enlisted, and civilian oaths are very similar, but vary to some 
degree. If desired, the words “so help me God” may be omitted.

24.25. Retirement Ceremony 
Recognition upon retirement is a longstanding tradition of military service with a tangible 
expression of appreciation for contributions to the USAF mission, and with the assurance of 
continuation as a part of the USAF family in retirement. Commanders are responsible for ensuring 
members have a retirement ceremony to recognize their contributions. They must offer the retiring 
member the courtesy of a formal ceremony in keeping with the customs and traditions of the 
service unless the member prefers otherwise. Family members and friends should be invited and 
encouraged to attend the ceremony. During the retirement ceremony, the member receives a 
certificate of retirement, a United States flag, the USAF retired lapel button, various certificates, 
and letters of appreciation, as well as appropriate awards, decorations, and honors. Spouses also 
receive special recognition at a member’s retirement ceremony. Retirement ceremonies often 
combine official, long standing USAF traditions with a member’s desire to personalize the 
ceremony for family and invited guests. Anyone involved in planning a retirement should consult 
DAFI 36-3203 for complete details. 
24.26. Reveille Ceremony 
The signal for the start of the official duty day is the playing of reveille. Because the time for the 
start of the duty day varies among different locations, the commander designates the specified time 
for reveille. If the commander desires, a reveille ceremony may accompany the raising of the flag. 
This ceremony takes place after sunrise near the base flagstaff. Shortly before the specified time, 
Airmen march to a pre-designated position near the base flagstaff, halt, face toward the flagstaff, 
and dress. The flag security detail arrives at the flagstaff at this time and remains at attention. 
A typical reveille ceremony will involve the following commands and procedures: 
The unit commander (or senior participant) commands “Parade, REST.” 
At the specified time, the unit commander commands “SOUND REVEILLE.” The flag detail 
assumes the position of attention, moves to the flagstaff, and attaches the flag to the halyards. 
After reveille is played, the unit commander commands “Squadron, ATTENTION” and “Present, 
ARMS” and then faces the flagstaff and executes present arms. On this signal, the national 
anthem or To the Colors is sounded. 
On the first note of the national anthem or To the Colors, the flag security detail begins to raise 
the flag briskly. The senior member of the detail holds the flag to keep it from touching the 
ground. 
The unit commander holds the salute until the last note of the national anthem or To the Colors 
is played, then executes order arms, faces about, and commands “Order, ARMS.” 
The Airmen are then dismissed or marched to the dismissal area. 
Raising the Flag. When practical, a detail consisting of one senior member and two junior 
members hoists the flag. The detail forms in line with the senior member carrying the flag in the 
center. The detail then marches to the flagstaff, halts, and attaches the flag to the halyards. The two 
junior members attend the halyards, taking a position facing the staff to hoist the flag without 
entangling the halyards. The flag is always raised and lowered from the leeward side of the 
flagstaff. The senior member continues to hold the flag, taking particular care that no portion of 
the flag touches the ground. When the flag is clear of the senior member’s grasp, the senior member 
comes to attention and executes present arms. On the last note of the national anthem, To the 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
560 
 
 
 
Colors, or after the flag has been hoisted to the staff head, all members of the detail execute order 
arms on command of the senior member. The halyards are then secured to the cleat of the staff or, 
if appropriate, the flag is lowered to half-staff before the halyards are secured. The detail is formed 
again and then marches to the dismissal area. 
24.27. Retreat Ceremony 
The retreat ceremony serves a twofold purpose; it signals the end of the official duty day, and it 
serves as a ceremony for paying respect to the United States flag. Because the time for the end of 
the duty day varies among different locations, the commander designates the time for retreat 
ceremonies. The retreat ceremony may take place at the squadron area, on the base parade ground, 
or near the base flagstaff. If conducted at the base parade ground, retreat may be part of the parade 
ceremony. Shortly before the specified time for retreat, Airmen participating in the ceremony are 
positioned facing the flagstaff and dressed. If a band is present, the band precedes the Airmen 
participating in the ceremony. A typical reveille ceremony will involve the following commands 
and procedures: 
If the band and Airmen march to the flagstaff, a flag security detail also marches to the flagstaff 
and halts, and the senior member gives the command “Parade, REST” to the security detail. 
As soon as the Airmen are dressed, the commander commands “Parade, REST.” The commander 
then faces the flagstaff, assumes parade rest, and waits for the specified time for retreat. 
At the specified time, the commander orders the bandleader to sound retreat by commanding 
“SOUND RETREAT.” 
During the playing of retreat (either by a band or over a loudspeaker), junior members of the 
flag security detail assume the position of attention and move to the flagstaff to arrange the 
halyards for proper lowering of the flag. Once the halyards are arranged, the junior members of 
the flag security detail execute parade rest in unison. 
After retreat has played, the commander faces about and commands “Squadron (Group, etc.), 
ATTENTION.” 
The commander then commands “Present, ARMS.” The members of the flag security detail and 
members in formation execute present arms on command of the commander. The commander 
faces to the front and also assumes present arms. 
The national anthem is played, or a bugler plays To the Colors. The junior members of the flag 
security detail lower the flag slowly and with dignity. 
The commander executes order arms when the last note of the national anthem or To the Colors 
is played and the flag is securely grasped. The commander faces about, gives the Airmen in 
formation the command of “Order, ARMS,” and then faces to the front. 
The flag security detail folds the flag. The senior member of the detail remains at attention while 
the flag is folded unless needed to control the flag. 
When the flag is folded, the flag security detail, with the senior member on the right and the flag 
bearer in the center, marches to a position three paces from the commander (or officer of the 
day in an informal ceremony). The senior member salutes and reports “Sir (Ma’am), the flag is 
secured.” The commander returns the salute, and the flag security detail marches away. The 
Airmen in formation are then marched to their areas and dismissed. Note: Uniformed military 
members not assigned to a formation face the flag (if visible), or the music, and assume the 
position of parade rest on the first note of retreat. Upon completion of retreat, they should 
assume the position of attention and salute on the first note of the national anthem or To the 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
561 
 
 
 
Colors. 
Lowering the Flag. When practical, the detail lowering the flag should be one senior member and 
three junior members for the all-purpose flag, and one senior member and five junior members for 
the installation flag. The detail is formed and marched to the flagstaff. The halyards are detached 
and attended from the leeward side. On the first note of the national anthem or To the Colors, the 
members of the detail not lowering the flag execute present arms. The lowering of the flag is 
coordinated with the playing of the music so the two are completed at the same time. The senior 
member commands the detail “Order, ARMS” when the flag is low enough to be received. If at 
half-staff, briskly hoist the flag to the staff head while retreat is sounded and then lower on the first 
note of the national anthem or To the Colors. The flag is detached from the halyards and folded. 
The halyards are secured to the staff. The correct method for folding the United States flag can be 
found in DAFI 90-1202. 
24.28. The Dining-In and Dining-Out 
Dining-ins and dining-outs are both formal events. The one significant difference is that 
nonmilitary spouses, friends, and civilians may attend a dining-out, but the dining-in is a formal 
dinner for military members only. The present dining-in format had its beginnings in the Air Corps 
when General Henry H. “Hap” Arnold held his famous wingdings. The association of Army Air 
Corps personnel with the British and their dining-ins during World War II also encouraged their 
popularity in the USAF. Members now recognize the event as an occasion where ceremony, 
tradition, and good fellowship serve an important purpose and are effective in building and 
maintaining high morale and esprit de corps. Military members who attend these ceremonies must 
wear the mess dress or the semiformal uniform. Civilians wear the dress specified in the invitations. 
Note: The combat dining-in is an event similar to the dining-in because it maintains the traditional 
form; however, the difference is primarily in the dress and atmosphere. Combat dining-ins 
typically celebrate the evening in some form of utility uniform in a much more relaxed environment 
deliberately prepared to encourage camaraderie. 
24.29. The Order of the Sword Induction Ceremony 
Induction into the order of the sword is an honor reserved for individuals who have provided 
outstanding leadership and support to enlisted members as a “Leader among Leaders and an 
Airman among Airmen.” The order of the sword event is conducted with the dignity that reflects 
its significance as the highest honor and tribute an enlisted member can bestow on anyone. Similar 
to the dining-in, this evening affair usually consists of a social period, formal dinner, and induction 
ceremony. The required dress is the mess dress, semiformal uniform, or equivalent. The only 
approved levels for award of the sword are the USAF level and major command level. The Chief 
Master Sergeant of the Air Force and MAJCOM command chiefs are known as the “keepers of the 
sword,” and maintain the official lists of order of the sword recipients, respectively. 
History of the Order of the Sword. The first recorded order of the sword ceremony in the United 
States was in the 1860s when a General officer was presented a sword by his command. The 
ceremony was revised, updated, and adopted by the USAF in 1967 to recognize and honor military 
senior officers, Colonel or above, and civilian equivalents, for conspicuous and significant 
contributions to the welfare and prestige of the USAF enlisted force mission effectiveness as well 
as the overall military establishment.

24.30. Military Formations 
Ceremonies involving drill and formations honor distinguished persons, recognize special events, 
and demonstrate the proficiency and training state of Airmen. Whether giving or following 
commands, good military bearing is essential to all involved in drill and formation. The precision 
marching, promptness in responding to commands, and teamwork developed on the drill field are 
key to the professional appearance and performance of the formation during ceremonies. The flight 
formation is the most practical drill group and is composed of at least two, but no more than four, 
elements. For more information, see DAFPAM 34-1203, Drill and Ceremonies. 
24.31. Drill Commands 
Being in step with the formation, proper positioning, marching, and facing movements are all 
necessary aspects of drill and ceremonies. Understanding proper procedures for drill are essential 
for moving a formation in an orderly manner from one position to another. Standards, such as the 
24-inch step, cadence of 100 to 120 steps per minute, distance, and interval, were established to 
ensure movements are executed with order and precision. A drill command is an oral order that 
usually has two parts: the preparatory command and the command of execution. The preparatory 
command precedes the command of execution. It explains what the movement will be and what 
elements or parts of the formation will be executing the movement. The command of execution 
explains what movement will be carried out. For example, in the command “Flight, HALT,” the 
word “Flight” is the preparatory command, and it designates the unit. The word “HALT” is the 
command of execution and is the command to be performed by the flight. 
Supplementary Command. A supplementary command is given when one unit of the element 
must execute a movement different from another unit or units, or the same movement at a different 
time. Examples of supplementary commands are, “CONTINUE THE MARCH” and “STAND 
FAST.” 
Informational Command. An informational command has no preparatory command or command 
of execution and is not supplementary. This command is used to direct others to give commands. 
Examples of informational commands are, “PREPARE FOR INSPECTION” and “DISMISS THE 
SQUADRON.” 
Mass Commands. Mass commands help develop confidence, self-reliance, assertiveness, and 
enthusiasm by making the individual recall, give, and execute proper commands. Mass commands 
are usually confined to simple movements with short preparatory commands and commands of 
execution carried out simultaneously by all elements of a unit. Each person in the formation is 
required to give commands in unison as if they were responsible for giving the commands to the 
entire element. The volume of the combined voices encourages every person to perform the 
movement with snap and precision. 
24.32. Drill Positions 
Fall In. The command for fall in is “FALL IN.” On the command “FALL IN,” individuals form a 
flight in line formation. Line formation may best be described as falling into formation by forming 
a ‘long’ line from shoulder to shoulder. Each Airman will fall in, automatically establishing their 
dress, cover, interval, and distance, executing an automatic ready front, and remaining at the 
AFH 1, AIRMAN   15 February 2025 
563 
 
 
 
position of attention. 
Attention. The command for attention is “Flight, ATTENTION.” On the command 
“ATTENTION,” members of the formation come to attention by bringing the heels together 
smartly and on line, as near each other as the conformation of the body permits. Feet are turned 
out equally to form a 45-degree angle. Keep the legs straight without stiffening or locking the 
knees. The body is erect with hips level, chest lifted, back arched, and shoulders square and even. 
Arms hang straight down alongside the body without stiffness and the wrists are straight with the 
forearms. Place thumbs, which are resting along the first joint of the forefinger, along the seams 
of the trousers or sides of the skirt. Hands are cupped (but not clenched as a fist) with palms facing 
the leg. The head is held straight to the front, the chin is drawn slightly so the axis of the head and 
neck is vertical, and the eyes are to the front with the line of sight parallel to the ground. The weight 
of the body rests equally on the heels and balls of both feet. Silence and immobility are required. 
Open Ranks. The command for open ranks is “Open Ranks, MARCH.” The command “Open 
Ranks, MARCH” is only given to a formation when in line at normal intervals. On the command 
“MARCH,” the fourth rank stands fast and automatically executes dress right dress. The third rank 
takes one pace, the second rank takes two, and the first rank takes three paces forward. The flight 
commander aligns the flight, then commands “Ready, FRONT.” 
Open ranks is a command given for inspecting the flight. After inspecting the entire flight, the 
inspector marches off to the right flank (element leaders) of the flight. The flight commander calls 
the flight to attention. The flight commander then commands “Close Ranks, MARCH.” On the 
command “MARCH,” the first rank stands fast. The second rank takes one pace forward and halts 
at the position of attention. The third and fourth ranks take two and three paces forward, 
respectively, and halt at attention. 
24.33. Rest Positions 
There are four positions of rest: parade rest, at ease, rest, and fall out. The commander and members 
of the formation must be at the position of attention before going to any of the rest positions. To 
resume the position of attention from any of the rests (except fall out, for which the commander 
uses the command “FALL IN”), the command is “Flight, ATTENTION.” 
Parade Rest. The command for parade rest is “Parade, REST.” On the command “REST,” 
members of the formation raise the left foot from the hip just enough to clear the ground and move 
smartly to the left so the heels are 12 inches apart, as measured from the inside of the heels. Keep 
the legs straight but not stiff, and the heels on line. As the left foot moves, bring the arms fully 
extended to the back of the body, uncupping the hands in the process and straightening the fingers 
of each hand, pointing them toward the ground. Face the palms outward and place the right hand 
in the palm of the left, right thumb over the left to form an “X.” Keep the head and eyes straight 
ahead and remain silent and immobile. 
At Ease. The command for at ease is “AT EASE.” On the command “AT EASE,” members of the 
formation may relax in a standing position but must keep the right foot in place. Their position in 
the formation will not change. Silence is maintained. 
Rest. The command for rest is “REST.” On the command “REST,” the same requirements for at 
ease apply, but moderate speech is permitted. 
Fall Out. The command for fall out is “FALL OUT.” On the command “FALL OUT,” individuals 
may relax in a standing position or break ranks. They must remain in the immediate area. No 
specific method of dispersal is required. Moderate speech is permitted.

24.34.  Air Force Enlisted Heritage Research Institute and Enlisted Heritage Hall Museum 
At Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, Alabama, the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Research Institute is a 
repository for Air Force enlisted history and heritage. It contains over 200,000 original documents 
and reference materials spanning the ages from balloon aviation to current operations. The Air 
Force Enlisted Heritage Research Institute is housed within the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Hall 
Museum, which is the only enlisted-centric museum in the Air Force and a place of honor designed 
to remember and teach the importance of enlisted contributions to Air Power.  
The Enlisted Heritage Hall, Figure 24.5, is a 14,000 square foot museum that was developed by 
the Air Force Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Academy in 1983, which was originally a 1942 
segregated dining facility. Throughout the 
decades, displays have been added to feature 
enlisted Airmen contributions to the Air and 
Space missions of the United States of America. 
There are over 280 individual exhibits with over 
3,000 artifacts on display, such as the authentic 
medal from four of the eight enlisted Medal of 
Honors, a B-17 Ball Turret, a B-52 Tail Gun, 
uniforms from AF members, such as former 
CMSAFs, POWs, Medal of Honor and Air Force 
Cross recipients, as well as countless other 
precious artifacts.  
“I cannot emphasize enough to the people in uniform—the fabric of our nation—
they have not misplaced their trust in the defense of America and what we stand for.” 
CMSAF (ret) Wayne L. Fisk 
First Director of the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Hall 
24.35.  The Air Force Memorial 
The Air Force Memorial, located in Arlington, VA, commemorates 
“Airmen”–past, present, and future. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the 
world witnessed the Air Force using advanced technology and delivering a 
degree of air superiority undreamed of by the World War II Army Air Corps.  
Members from the Air Force Association and Air Force Sergeants 
Association realized there was no national memorial to commemorate the 
Air Force’s air dominance. On October 14, 2006, fifteen years after the 1991 
Persian Gulf War, President George W. Bush dedicated the Air Force 
Memorial to Airmen.  
Renowned architect James I. Freed designed the Air Force Memorial by first 
borrowing the runway patterns from World War II airfields. He further 
ensured the 5-pointed star remains prominent in the public eye as it is on Air Force aircraft, 
missiles, and on enlisted chevrons. The star is centered at the base of the three asymmetrical spires 
reaching heights of 201, 231, and 270 feet. The spires, at the foot of a runway, are diametrically

opposed from World War II quotes by our founding fathers, Generals Billy Mitchel, Henry “Hap” 
Arnold, and Carl Spaatz. On the northern and southern boundaries of the parade field stand 10-
foot high, 56-feet long granite walls. The theme of the northern wall is “Valor.”   
All aerospace Medal of Honor recipients and their hometowns are listed beginning with World 
War I U.S. Army Air Corps aviators, Lieutenants Bleckley, Goetler, Luke, and Rickenbacker to 
TSgt John A. Chapman, who, in 2002, died valiantly in Afghanistan. Nearby, stands a glass 
contemplation wall engraved with the 4-ship missing man formation, paying tribute to fallen 
Airmen. The southern wall inscription theme is Air Force Core “Values.”  
The Air Force Memorial also lists two centuries of combat and contingency campaigns. Along the 
walls of the campaigns are quotes defining their contributions to the nation. Central to the Air 
Force Memorial is the 16-foot bronze Honor Guard Statue, created by renowned sculptor Zenos 
Frudakis. The statue is a testimony to the Air Force’s military courtesies, dress and appearance, 
and drill and ceremonies. Most importantly, the Honor Guard statue represent what we value the 
most–our people.  
“A Soldier can walk the battlefields where [they] once fought; a Marine can walk 
the beaches [they] once stormed; but an airman can never visit the patch of sky [they] raced 
across on a mission to defend freedom. And so it’s fitting that, from this day forward, the 
men and women of the Air Force will have this memorial, a place here on the ground that 
recognizes their achievements and sacrifices in the skies above.”

coordination with operations of conventional, nonspecial operations forces. Political-military 
considerations frequently shape special operations, requiring clandestine, covert, or low-visibility 
techniques, and oversight at the national level. Special operations differ from conventional 
operations in degree of physical and political risk, operational techniques, mode of employment, 
independence from friendly support, and dependence on detailed operational intelligence and

CHIEF MASTER SERGEANTS OF THE AIR FORCE 
First Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Paul Wesley Airey 
Paul Wesley Airey enlisted in the Army Air Forces as a radio 
operator on 16 November 1942. By the height of World War II, 
he was serving as an aerial gunner aboard B-24 bombers. While 
in Europe, Airey and his crew were shot down over Vienna, 
Austria, captured, and held prisoner by the Germans from July 
1944 to May 1945. During the Korean conflict, he was awarded 
the Legion of Merit for creating a means of constructing 
equipment from salvaged parts, improving corrosion control of 
sensitive radio and radar components. Following the war, Airey 
took the job of first sergeant, a position he later said was one of 
the most important in the Air Force. He subsequently served as 
first sergeant for six squadrons at four bases over the next 12 
years before being appointed to the highest NCO position. 
Upon assuming his new responsibilities, CMSAF Airey began 
tackling the problem of personnel retention, an issue he 
identified as one of the greatest challenges he faced. The first-
term reenlistment rate was the lowest it had been in 12 years, but Airey did not attribute the great 
decline to the unpopularity of the war in Vietnam. He felt it was the consequence of “poor pay, 
numerous remote assignments, good civilian employment opportunities, and an inequitable 
promotion system.” He became an advisor to a committee to investigate and recommend a more 
equitable system. His efforts helped produce the Weighted Airman Promotion System, which was 
adopted in 1970, eliminating local enlisted promotion boards and equalizing promotion 
opportunities across career fields. In retirement, Airey continued to be an enlisted advocate and 
spoke to Airmen around the force. CMSAF Airey died in 2009.

Second Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Donald L. Harlow 
Born in Waterville, Maine, Donald L. Harlow was the youngest 
of nine children. At age 22, after working a variety of jobs to 
help support his mother and pay his tuition at a private 
preparatory school, he was drafted into the Army Air Corps. 
Serving as an armament and gunnery instructor, he taught 
cadets to fieldstrip and reassemble their weapons and to 
synchronize firing guns through aircraft propellers. He 
transferred to the personnel career field in 1945 and advanced 
to the grade of Staff Sergeant before his February 1946 
discharge from RegAF. During the Korean War, Harlow was 
recalled to RegAF, holding various positions in the personnel 
career field. At 16 years of service, he was promoted to Chief 
Master Sergeant and was the personnel Sergeant Major for 
Headquarters United States European Command and the 
Sergeant Major for the Executive Services Division, Office of 
the Vice Chief of Staff. 
As the second to take the reins, CMSAF Harlow continued to cut a path through the 
misunderstanding, confusion, and mistrust that surrounded the CMSAF. Ever vigilant, he 
campaigned for and refined the newly established Weighted Airman Promotion System, garnered 
continued flight pay for NCOs attending in-residence PME and worked toward equal per diem for 
enlisted and officers. During Vietnam, he directed his attention to where he felt it was most needed: 
young Airmen and their issues, including racial tension, assignment concerns, and promotion 
problems. Known for his no-nonsense approach and keen ability to listen, Harlow advised the 
Chief of Staff of the Air Force on matters of true concern to the enlisted force. While many of his 
recommendations did not result in policy changes during his tenure, he planted the seeds for future 
change. After retiring, Chief Harlow was a strong lobbyist for enlisted equality. CMSAF Harlow 
died in 1997.

Third Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Richard D. Kisling 
Richard D. Kisling and his 10 siblings were raised on a farm in 
Iowa during the Great Depression and the dust bowl years. The 
patriotism he developed during his childhood was called on 
when he was drafted into the Army’s combat infantry in 1945 
during the effort to reconstitute the number of soldiers driving 
through France. After training and deployment times, Kisling 
arrived in France a month before the war in Europe ended. His 
unit assumed responsibility for negotiating the repatriation of 
displaced Soviets. From there, Kisling separated from the 
service for civilian life. After a few months spent missing the 
camaraderie, he reenlisted for a brief stint in the Army. In 1947, 
he joined the Army Air Forces, serving first as a clerk and later 
a personnel specialist. Upon his promotion to Senior Master 
Sergeant in September 1958, he was among the first group of 
Air Force enlisted members to wear the super grades of Senior 
Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant. 
Once assigned to the Pentagon, CMSAF Kisling found the enlisted force struggling through the 
development of a new Air Force. After talking with several base officials, it was determined that 
the Air Force needed to develop their NCOs like they did their officers. So Kisling placed concerns 
for NCO professional development in the forefront of discussion at the Pentagon. His persistence 
paid off when the first senior NCO academy was approved by Congress in 1972. The Academy 
officially opened its doors in January 1973; however, before the Academy opened its doors, the 
original plan was to restrict its attendance to first sergeants. In the end, Kisling won the battle of 
making professional development available to all senior NCOs. His concern for such enlisted 
issues as housing, pay, promotions, education and training, and assignments earned him the respect 
of his peers and the nickname, “the GI’s man in Washington.” CMSAF Kisling died in 1985.

Fourth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Thomas N. Barnes 
Thomas N. Barnes grew up in the war-related industries town 
of Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1949, he joined the newly created 
United States Air Force as an aircraft maintainer specializing 
in hydraulics. His first duty station found him at the leading 
edge of United States Air Force integration efforts, as one of 
the first African-Americans to join the unit. Barnes’ unit was 
flying Korean War support missions. Unbeknownst to others 
in his squadron, a crew pal taught him the art of flight 
engineering and let him fly resupply and medical evacuation 
missions. By his tour’s end, Barnes had gained flight engineer 
certification, accumulated 750 flight hours over enemy 
territory, and earned the Air Medal. He was the first CMSAF 
with direct Vietnam experience and the first African-American 
to serve in the highest enlisted post of a military service. The 
Chief of Staff of the Air Force consecutively extended him in 
1975 and in 1976. 
CMSAF Barnes’ notable contribution came in the area that inspired his greatest passion and ranked 
among his largest challenges: working to ensure equality among the ranks and races. He took great 
pride in the part he played in bringing about the Air Force Social Actions Program in 1969. He 
labored to eliminate barriers for women and convince the Air Force to use them in nontraditional 
roles. He understood the value of continuing to educate Airmen and believed no one should 
advance in rank without PME, working to establish the service’s firm commitment to enlisted 
PME. Recognized throughout the force for his ability to communicate with anyone, Barnes made 
listening to Airmen a priority. At the beginning of his tenure, the question most asked of Barnes 
was, “What programs will you implement for the blacks?” “The answer was ‘None’,” Barnes 
recalls. “I told them I work for all blue suiters.” After his retirement, Barnes remained actively 
engaged in Air Force issues. CMSAF Barnes died in 2003.

Fifth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Robert D. Gaylor 
Growing up in Indiana, Robert D. Gaylor wanted to travel and 
learn a skill. He enlisted in the Air Force in 1948, a transition 
time for America and the military. As he arrived at basic training, 
President Truman issued Executive Order 9981, Desegregation of 
the Armed Forces, 26 July 1948, establishing the President’s 
Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the 
Armed Services calling for equality of opportunity in the United 
States military. Gaylor had had no experience with segregation 
or integration, and he would witness the long journey to full 
integration. His first duty was as a military policeman and he 
excelled throughout his career, advancing to the rank of Master 
Sergeant with only 7 years and 7 months of service. Serving as an 
instructor at basic training and the NCO Academy convinced him 
that special duties help prepare NCOs for greater leadership roles. 
In 1976, as a member of the Air Force Manpower and Personnel 
Center, Gaylor traveled extensively, giving 275 leadership talks 
annually. 
CMSAF Gaylor’s goal as the senior enlisted man was to feel the pulse of the enlisted force and 
serve as a conduit of information. He addressed low morale and the weak military public image 
head on. He educated the force on the hazards of substance abuse and continued to raise confidence 
and shift attitudes within the force. He is credited with securing a policy that allowed Senior 
Airmen to transport their families at government expense during permanent change of station 
moves, a solid step toward improving quality of life. He educated the force in order to eliminate 
the stereotypes and prejudices working against equal opportunities for minorities and women. 
Finally, Gaylor promoted leadership. He traveled extensively, talking to Airmen about taking pride 
in their military careers. He believes one of the most important roles a former CMSAF can play is 
that of a link between the United States Air Force of the past and today’s service. Gaylor continues 
to meet and serve Airmen, conducting more than 40 Air Force base visits each year. CMSAF 
Gaylor died in 2024.

Sixth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF James M. McCoy 
James M. McCoy was raised in the midwest, attending high 
school in Atchison, Kansas, and college at St. Benedicts College 
in Atchison and St. Ambrose College in Davenport, Iowa. He 
seriously considered a vocation in the priesthood, but in 1951, 
during the height of the Korean War, he enlisted in the USAF as 
a radar operator. When the war ended, the Air Force had too 
many operators and needed military training instructors. McCoy 
volunteered, and with only 6 years of RegAF experience, found 
himself in charge of five groups of training instructors. He 
continued working in PME, serving as NCO preparatory school 
commandant and as an NCO academy instructor before 
returning to the personnel training field in 1973. A year later he 
was selected as one of the United States Air Force’s 12 
Outstanding Airmen of the Year. He then became Strategic Air 
Command’s first senior enlisted advisor. While there, McCoy 
was a member of the Air Force Management Improvement 
Group, chaired by CMSAF Barnes, which discussed management issues and proposed solutions. 
As a result, enlisted PME expanded into five phases. 
With the public still questioning military involvement in Vietnam, the Air Force was experiencing 
the lowest recruiting year ever; retention rates were also dropping when CMSAF McCoy took 
office. His first challenge was to improve those numbers. In late 1979, along with former CMSAF 
Kisling, he testified before Congress that people were not reenlisting in the Air Force because they 
could not make ends meet on enlisted pay. McCoy worked with recruiters to get the right people 
in the Air Force and sought to improve the PME system from basic training to the NCO and senior 
NCO level. During his tour as CMSAF, the Stripes for Exceptional Performers Program was 
instituted to provide incentive and an alternate promotion option for enlisted members. In addition 
to visiting Airmen, he placed great value on being involved with the Pentagon staff. He expanded 
the list of boards and conferences where he believed the CMSAF should have a role. In retirement, 
McCoy remains at the forefront of Air Force issues, having served in leadership positions with Air 
Force professional organizations and speaking to Airmen throughout the force.

Seventh Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Arthur L. Andrews 
In January 1953, out of a sense of patriotism and a desire to 
grow and develop, Arthur "Bud" L. Andrews enlisted in the Air 
Force. During basic training, his training instructor asked for 
volunteers to serve as APs. Thinking AP meant “air police,” 
Andrews raised his hand. As it turned out, the training instructor 
wanted area policemen. He spent the next 3 months picking up 
cigarette butts outside the barracks. He eventually had an 
opportunity to enter the military police force, where he served 
most of the next 14 years. In 1959, while working as an 
investigator, Andrews was credited with solving a murder 
committed by an Airman Second Class. By 1970, Andrews had 
served tours in Morocco, Thailand, and Vietnam; became a 
first sergeant; and was promoted to the rank of Senior Master 
Sergeant. During his career he spent a decade as a first 
sergeant. 
Upon assuming his new position, CMSAF Andrews’ top 
priority could be described as getting back to basics. He believed the most vexing problems (such 
as terms of pay, benefits, recruitment, and retention) had been addressed and were evolving to meet 
Airmen’s needs. While he continued to advise the Chief of Staff of the Air Force on quality-of-life 
improvements, he began to focus on cultural change. He felt it was time for Airmen to “think we 
instead of me, me, me.” He wanted people to focus on “how we’re supposed to dress, act, and react 
toward subordinates and superiors, and how we’re supposed to do our jobs.” He challenged NCOs 
to “take care of their people and to accomplish the mission.” He further suggested that NCOs look 
at themselves if they were dissatisfied with their jobs. He dispelled the days of “leadership by stress” 
and applauded PME for creating a smarter force. Andrews believed the CMSAF needed to know the 
issues firsthand, which kept him traveling extensively around the Air Force. CMSAF Andrews died 
in 1996.

Eighth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Sam E. Parish 
Sam E. Parish was raised and educated in north Florida. In 1955, 
at age 17, he joined the Air Force as a ground weather 
equipment operator. His first assignment at Wiesbaden Air 
Base, Germany, brought him into an experimental program to 
cross train as a weather observer. That experiment led to a 
career. In 1960, he became the youngest 7-skill level in his 
career field and continued to excel. While the chief observer for 
the 7th Weather Squadron in Heidelberg, Germany, he was 
quickly promoted to Senior Master Sergeant, and at age 31, 
Parish made Chief Master Sergeant. He was a member of the 
first senior NCO academy class and was selected as the Air 
Weather Service Senior Enlisted Advisor in 1973. He returned 
to Germany in 1976 as the Consolidated Base Personnel Office 
Personnel Sergeant Major, and in 1977 became the senior 
enlisted advisor for the United States Air Forces in Europe, 
where he established the United States Air Forces in Europe First Sergeant of the Year program. 
Parish later served as the 40th Air Division and Strategic Air Command senior enlisted advisor. 
CMSAF Parish tackled a range of enlisted personnel issues during his tenure. One such issue was 
the fixed-phase point for promotion to Senior Airman, which would promote qualified Airmen to 
Senior Airman at a set point in their initial enlistment, allowing them a chance to be selected for 
Staff Sergeant during their first enlistment. He also obtained Chief of Staff of the Air Force 
approval to allow flight line personnel to wear a functional badge on their uniform, which led to 
USAF members in all specialties being able to wear functional badges identifying their career 
fields. He also obtained Chief of Staff of the Air Force approval to establish the Levitow Award 
for each level of PME and to implement the First Sergeant of the Year Program Air Force-wide. 
He was known as a straight shooter who did not waste time trying to figure out what people wanted 
to hear. Instead, he told them what they needed to hear. To Parish, the CMSAF is the most 
important job in the Air Force from an enlisted program perspective. In retirement, he continues 
to support Airmen by attending service functions and visiting bases throughout the Air Force.

Ninth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF James C. Binnicker 
James C. Binnicker, raised in Aiken, South Carolina, joined the 
Civil Air Patrol in high school with aspirations of becoming a 
pilot. Cadet of the Year honors earned him a scholarship to 
attend flight school and the right to represent his state as a 
foreign exchange cadet in Great Britain. In 1957, when doctors 
detected a high frequency hearing loss, he was disqualified from 
the program. To stay close to his passion, he joined the Air 
Force in the personal equipment, life support career field. By 
1964, Binnicker cross-trained into air operations, planning 
flights for missions to Vietnam. While serving in Vietnam from 
1968 to 1969, he served as NCOIC of operations for the 22d 
Tactical Air Support Squadron, and later as a Vietnamese-
speaking linguist at the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces 
Language School in Saigon. While in Vietnam, he set his sights 
on becoming the CMSAF, advocating for enlisted Airmen, and 
served as a first sergeant and base sergeant major at Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina. In 
1977, upon recommendation of CMSAF Thomas Barnes, he became the sole enlisted member of 
the newly established President’s Commission on Military Compensation. He also spent over 7 
years as the senior enlisted advisor for the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, 12th Air Force, Pacific Air 
Forces, and Tactical Air Command. 
CMSAF Binnicker’s first order of business was tackling the Airman performance report, a system 
of ratings from 1 to 9. To more accurately differentiate between Airmen, the enlisted performance 
report was created, along with a system to provide and document performance feedback. Next, 
Binnicker set his sights on admitting master sergeants to the SNCO academy. He believed giving 
Airmen all the responsibility they could handle would result in attracting and retaining higher 
quality people in the Air Force. He also worked to give minorities and women more responsibilities 
throughout the Air Force. The Air Force Chief of Staff recognized Binnicker as a staunch advocate 
and spokesman for enlisted issues. His commitment to Airmen did not change following his 
retirement in 1994. He stayed abreast of issues affecting the enlisted force and visited PME classes 
to talk with students worldwide. In addition, he served as president and chief executive officer for 
the Air Force Enlisted Village until his death in March 2015.

Tenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Gary R. Pfingston 
Gary R. Pfingston played minor league baseball before enlisting 
in the Air Force as an aircraft mechanic. During his first 
assignment as a B-52 crew chief at Castle AFB, California, he 
went to work one day with a pack of cigarettes and $2 and did 
not return home for 30 days because the Cuban Missile Crisis 
sent the base into lockdown. Ten years later, Pfingston worked 
aircraft maintenance in Thailand, reconfiguring B-52s to carry 
conventional bombs in what became known as “iron belly” 
modifications. In 1973, he returned to the U.S. and spent the 
next 8 1/2 years as a military training instructor, and later, chief 
of the military training division. During an assignment to 
Andersen AFB, Guam, Pfingston broke his back, was 
hospitalized for 147 days, and returned to duty as the first 
sergeant. Future assignments had Pfingston taking part in the first 
ability to survive and operate exercise in a chemical 
environment and serving as a senior enlisted advisor. 
CMSAF Pfingston’s focus during his tenure was the Air Force drawdown and budget. Holding the 
highest enlisted position during Desert Storm, he worked to restore basic allowance for subsistence 
to the troops living in field conditions and increasing the Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance, 
but the toughest challenge he faced was the Air Force downsizing. To avoid involuntary 
separations, Pfingston worked to implement the Voluntary Separation Incentive and Special 
Separation Bonus Programs. His idea to provide career paths and milestones in line with the officer 
career model, led to the career field education and training plan, three-level, and seven-level 
technical schools for all career fields, and mandatory in-residence PME schools. He also found 
himself involved with issues such as homosexuals serving in the military, Air Force specialty codes 
opening up to women, assignment policies including the Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing 
(EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus, and even the introduction of the new senior NCO stripes. Pfingston 
remained active in what he called the “communication chain” of former CMSAFs advocating for 
the enlisted force after his retirement. CMSAF Pfingston died in 2007.

Eleventh Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF David J. Campanale 
Worcester, Massachusetts, native David J. Campanale said he 
had the world by the throat after high school. A promising 
athlete, when a baseball career fell through, his mother 
encouraged him to join the Air Force in 1970. Campanale 
completed aircraft maintenance technical school despite poor 
study habits and breaking his collarbone playing football. He 
credits his supervisors at his first base with turning his attitude 
around. Campanale sought challenges, volunteering for several 
tours to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, in support of B-52 Arc 
Light missions in Southeast Asia. He later volunteered to transfer 
to aerial repair. As he rose through the ranks, Campanale earned 
the distinguished graduate award at both the NCO academy and 
senior NCO academy and was stripes for exceptional performer-
promoted to Master Sergeant. He later served as a senior enlisted 
advisor; a role called “richly rewarding.” 
The year CMSAF Campanale began his tour, the military 
launched the new TRICARE health program. The change introduced many questions and a great 
deal of anxiety. He led the charge to alleviate those feelings through education. Also, when 
Congress threatened to change the retirement system to “High One” effectively reducing 
retirement pay, Campanale quickly responded. With senior leader support, Campanale stood 
before Congress in the successful fight against the proposed change. Another important recruitment 
and retention milestone was adoption of the one-plus-one dormitory standard, which gave each 
Airman his or her own room. Not a proponent of long speeches, while visiting bases he encouraged 
questions rather than delivering a speech, which created meaningful dialogue. He believes anyone 
can become CMSAF and offers those who want to follow in his footsteps this piece of advice: Be 
honest and keep your promise. Campanale continues to actively mentor Airmen serving today.

Twelfth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Eric W. Benken 
Raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, after graduating high school Eric W. 
Benken moved to Houston, Texas, to join his parents. Struggling 
to find a good paying job out of the area, he joined the Air Force 
as an administrative specialist. Although first assigned to 
Ellington AFB, Texas, he would get his chance to travel 9 
months later, on orders to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan. 
During his tour, he deployed to South Vietnam, where he spent 
his 20th birthday. As the U.S. Air Forces Europe senior enlisted 
advisor, he facilitated the highly successful beddown of forces 
during the Bosnia Operation Joint Endeavor. He led numerous 
quality-of-life initiatives, including eliminating/ remodeling a 
third of the U.S. Air Forces Europe zero-privacy dormitories, 
making way for the newly developed one-plus-one dormitories. 
Benken also crafted the NCO Professional Development 
Seminar, an effort to fill a career education void between Airman 
Leadership School and the NCO academy. 
During his tenure, CMSAF Benken focused heavily on fundamentals, getting back to basics, and 
changing the culture of the Air Force to meet new expeditionary requirements. He championed 
Warrior Week at basic training and ensured funding for a simulated deployed location at Lackland 
AFB, Texas. He instituted First Sergeant Academy curriculum changes, focusing on deployment 
responsibilities. He believed changing the title “senior enlisted advisor” to “Command Chief 
Master Sergeant” and adding the star to the chevron were critical to the success of these positions, 
in garrison and on the battlefield. CMSAF Benken engaged Congress and special interest groups 
on numerous fronts, ultimately defeating attempts to alter basic military training and reversing the 
diminished retirement system of 1986. Other significant challenges included ensuring TRICARE 
met health care needs and modernizing the force with a limited budget. He believed Air Force 
leaders should focus on the future and prepare the force for the next century. Benken served as the 
first co-chair of the Air Force Retiree Council, serves on the board of directors for the Airmen 
Memorial Foundation and the Mission Readiness Organization Executive Advisory Council, and 
continues to speak at a variety of Air Force functions.

Thirteenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Jim Finch 
Jim Finch entered the Air Force from East Hampton, New York, 
expecting to do only a 4-year hitch. He planned to learn a trade 
and see what the world had to offer and move on. Finch spent 
the early part of his career in the “bomb dumps” as a missile 
maintenance crew chief before becoming a PME instructor. 
After 4 years of teaching, Finch moved to the Leadership and 
Management Development Center at Maxwell Air Force Base 
Alabama. While there, he helped develop a correspondence 
version of the NCO preparatory course and taught new PME 
instructors. He was subsequently selected as the Air Force NCO 
PME functional manager at the Air Force Military Personnel 
Center. While there, he was involved in restructuring the PME 
program from four to three levels and implementing procedures 
to create Airman Leadership School and allow Master Sergeants 
to attend the senior NCO academy. Finch later served as an NCO Academy commandant, the 11th 
Air Force senior enlisted advisor, and Air Combat Command, Command Chief Master Sergeant. 
When CMSAF Finch took the reins, the Air Force was moving from a cold war to an expeditionary 
mindset. He implemented CMSAF Benken’s basic training Warrior Week vision to help new 
recruits understand that the expeditionary Air Force was not a temporary concept. He credits the 
program’s success to the men and women at Lackland. Known as a man of vision, he spent 3 years 
focusing on enlisted members’ concerns, and implementing programs to improve future 
preparedness. Finch recognized that the armed forces had to change to meet changing threats to 
national security. He believed future-focused leaders were paramount to success and made 
significant contributions to ensure the force developed that kind of leader. Finch maintains his 
vision for Airmen by serving on boards of Air Force-associated organizations, visiting Air Force 
members worldwide, and supporting current CMSAF agendas.

Fourteenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Gerald R. Murray 
Gerald R. Murray, a native of Boiling Springs, North Carolina, 
grew up on his grandfather’s farm. Graduating high school in 
1974, he briefly attended college, married, and worked in textile 
mills and construction before entering the Air Force as an F-4 
aircraft crew chief in 1977. Murray’s performance and 
capabilities were quickly recognized by his promotion to Senior 
Airman below the zone, and selection as an F-16 aircraft 
maintenance instructor. He continued to excel as the senior F-16 
crew chief on "Victor Alert" at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, and later 
as an A-10 squadron production superintendent. Deployed in 
support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, he played 
a key role as the combat turn director at the most forward 
operation location in theater, garnering the Bronze Star, and later 
the Air Force General Lew Allen Trophy. After standing up a 
new A-10 squadron at Moody AFB, Georgia, Murray’s 
performance, and leadership were recognized again when he was pulled from the flight line to 
serve as the 347th Wing Senior Enlisted Advisor and Command Chief Master Sergeant. He later 
served as the Command Chief Master Sergeant at 5th Air Force, U.S. Forces Japan, and Pacific 
Air Forces Command. 
An evolving Air Force and a changed world after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks were 
catalysts for change during Murray’s tenure. Murray refocused basic military training and PME 
toward expeditionary combat principles and took a leading role in developing a new physical 
fitness program to improve Air Force-wide readiness. Additionally, Murray led efforts to balance 
the enlisted force structure by increasing high-year tenure for four enlisted grades, bringing back 
the career job reservation and NCO retraining programs, and redistributing SNCO promotions in 
critical and unbalanced Air Force specialty codes. Understanding the need to maintain strong 
leadership, he initiated a deliberate approach to NCO professional development; led changes to the 
management of Chief Master Sergeants, including alignment under the Air Force Senior Leaders 
Management Office, and added a Chief Master Sergeant leadership course to the enlisted PME 
continuum. In retirement, Murray remains active in shaping Airmen development, serving with 
Air Force professional organizations and continuing to speak throughout the force.

Fifteenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF Rodney J. McKinley 
Rodney J. McKinley grew up in Mt. Orab, Ohio, and originally 
entered the Air Force in 1974 as a medical technician. He 
separated from the Air Force in 1977 to pursue an education. He 
returned to RegAF in 1982 as an aircraft maintenance specialist 
and served in various aircraft maintenance positions at Myrtle 
Beach AFB, South Carolina, and Clark Air Base, Philippines. In 
1991, he became a first sergeant, a position he held for the next 
10 years, with assignments at Myrtle Beach AFB, South 
Carolina; Ghedi Air Base, Italy; Tinker AFB, Oklahoma; and 
Ramstein Air Base, Germany. McKinley then served as a 
command Chief Master Sergeant at Ramstein Air Base, 
Germany; Langley AFB, Virginia; and 11th Air Force at 
Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. In 2003, during the early days of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, he deployed as Command Chief 
Master Sergeant to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, 
Southwest Asia. Before being selected as the 15th CMSAF, he was the Pacific Air Forces 
Command Chief Master Sergeant at Hickam AFB, Hawaii. 
During his tenure, CMSAF McKinley was an advocate for winning the Global War on Terrorism, 
developing, and taking care of Airmen, and modernizing aging air, space, and cyberspace assets. 
McKinley focused on properly organizing, training, and equipping Airmen during a time when 
many were being tasked outside their core competencies. His efforts to improve the enlisted 
evaluation system resulted in the first major changes to feedback and performance report forms 
since 1990. CMSAF McKinley also advocated for an educated enlisted corps and strongly 
encouraged Airmen to pursue a Community College of the Air Force degree earlier in their careers. 
A strong advocate for the “American Airman” spirit, he opened the door for creation of the 
Airman’s Creed, which codified core Air Force beliefs and articulated the warrior ethos. His vision 
led to the creation of the Enlisted Heroes Walk on the parade field at Lackland AFB, Texas, and 
the return of the enlisted collar brass and Good Conduct Medal. CMSAF McKinley also pursued 
improvements in Airman health and fitness, wounded warrior care, childcare, spousal employment 
opportunities, and accompanied and unaccompanied housing.

Sixteenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF James A. Roy 
James A. Roy grew up in Monroe, Michigan, and originally 
entered the Air Force in 1982 as a heavy equipment operator. 
He served in various civil engineer positions at MacDill Air 
Force Base, Florida; Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea; Kunsan 
Air Base, Korea; Andersen Air Force Base, Guam; and Keesler 
Air Force Base, Mississippi. He returned to the site of his 
original technical training—Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri—as 
an instructor and instructor supervisor. As a Senior Master 
Sergeant, he transferred into personnel as the military personnel 
flight superintendent, Keesler Air Force Base, in 1999. From 
there, Chief Roy served as a Command Chief Master Sergeant 
at wing, numbered Air Force, and unified combatant command 
levels. These assignments included Columbus Air Force Base, 
Mississippi; Charleston Air Force Base South Carolina; Langley 
Air Force Base, Virginia; and 5th Air Force and United States 
Forces Japan, at Yokota Air Base, Japan. In October 2004, he deployed as the 386th Air 
Expeditionary Wing, Southwest Asia Command Chief Master Sergeant. He then served as the 
United States Pacific Command senior enlisted leader at Camp H.M. Smith, Hawaii. 
Chief Roy’s key focus areas included ensuring Airmen were ready for joint and coalition 
operations; deliberately developing Airmen through education, training, and experience; and 
building a culture of resiliency within Airmen and their families. He worked to expand and solidify 
training and engagement in joint and coalition environments, which helped enhance the 
employability of Airmen in the increasingly joint and coalition warfighting environment. He also 
stressed the importance of updating and expanding distance-learning opportunities, and developed 
and promoted the Enlisted PME-Next construct, designed to close the gap in PME following 
Airman Leadership School.

Seventeenth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
CMSAF James A. Cody 
James A. Cody grew up in Lakeville, Massachusetts, and entered 
the Air Force in 1984 as an air traffic controller. He served in 
various air traffic control positions at Ramstein Air Base, 
Germany; Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire; Vandenberg 
Air Force Base, California; Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea; 
Incirlik Air Base, Turkey; Langley Air Force Base, Virginia; and 
MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. In April 2002, he deployed as

numbered Air Force; and major command level. These included 
assignments to Travis Air Force Base, California; MacDill Air 
Force Base, Florida; 18th Air Force at Scott Air Force Base, 
Illinois, and Air Education and Training Command at Joint Base 
San Antonio-Randolph, Texas. 
Immediately upon assuming the position, Chief Cody committed to the continued evolution of the 
enlisted force. He identified various policies and processes, and with the support of the Air Force 
Chief of Staff and Enlisted Board of Directors moved each of them forward to ensure the enlisted 
force was prepared for future challenges. He focused on the deliberate development of Airmen, 
evolving enlisted PME to a blended learning model, and establishing Developmental Special 
Duties, which ensured top Airmen were in leadership positions that best leveraged their proven 
performance across the force. He heightened the conversation surrounding work/life balance and 
the importance of finding a reasonable and sustainable demand signal for Airmen, and 
strengthened care and support programs for Wounded Warriors, including Airmen with invisible 
wounds such as traumatic brain injury and/or PTSD. Additionally, Chief Cody moved the Enlisted 
Evaluation System and Weighted Airman Promotion System forward to ensure they served today's 
Air Force, and Airmen. He led the biggest changes to both systems since their inception in 1970, 
ensuring job performance was the greatest factor towards promotion.

As Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Bass has 
demonstrated strong communication skills, prides herself on 
sharing her advice with Airmen, and ask them to trust in her 
leadership. Bass does not measure the success of the Air Force 
on how many meetings she attends or policies she affects; she 
measures it by the individual impacts of the Airmen she serves 
and helps to achieve their goals, and the strategic vision of the Air Force.

THE USAF SONG LYRICS 
Verse I:  Off we go into the wild blue yonder, Climbing high into the sun; 
Here they come zooming to meet our thunder, At ‘em now, Give ’em the gun! 
Down we dive, spouting our flame from under, Off with one helluva roar! 
We live in fame or go down in flame. Hey!  Nothing’ll stop the U.S. Air Force!! 
Verse II:  Brilliant minds fashioned a crate of thunder, Sent it high into the blue; 
Valiant hands blasted the world asunder; How they lived God only knew! 
Boundless souls dreaming of skies to conquer Gave us wings, ever to soar! 
With scouts before and bombers galore. Hey!  Nothing’ll stop the U.S. Air Force! 
Verse III:  Here’s a toast to the host 
Of those who love the vastness of the sky, 
To a friend we send a message of the brave who serve on high. We drink to those who gave their 
all of old, 
Then down we roar to score the rainbow’s pot of gold. A toast to the host of those we boast, the 
U.S. Air Force! 
Verse IV:  Off we go into the wild sky yonder, Keep the wings level and true; 
If you’d live to be a grey-haired wonder Keep the nose out of the blue! 
Fly to fight, guarding the nation’s border, We’ll be there, followed by more! 
In echelon we carry on. 
Oh, nothing’ll stop the U.S. Air Force!
