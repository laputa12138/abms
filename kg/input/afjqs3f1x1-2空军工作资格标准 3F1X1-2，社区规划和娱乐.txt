1.  PURPOSE.  This AFJQS standardizes Community Programming & Recreation (CP&R) on-the-job 
training (OJT). This document identifies the duties and tasks required to attain duty-position qualification. 
Please use this document to plan and record all duty-position related training and as a basis for preparing 
a Master Task List (MTL). Training managers, supervisors, trainers, trainees, and other functions use this 
AFJQS to plan, conduct, and document OJT. This AFJQS will remain in effect until superseded or 
rescinded. 
 
2. 
TASK QUALIFICATION.  Personnel assigned to perform CP&R duties are trained and qualified to 
the “Go” level. “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local 
requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. “Go” level equates to 3c in the 
proficiency code key for Craftsman (7-level) and 2b for Journeyman (5-level). This AFJQS pertains to 
all organizations that earn CP&R positions. For information on the use of APF personnel 
Nonappropriated Fund Category C activities refer to AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of 
Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) and Other Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalites (NAFIS).
