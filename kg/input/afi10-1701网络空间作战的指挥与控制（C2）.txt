This Instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-17, Cyberspace Operations, 
and provides guidance for command and control of activities covered in AFI 33-115, AF IT 
Services and supporting Methods and Procedures Technical Orders (e.g., Vulnerability 
Management MPTO, etc.). This AFI introduces the term AF Information Networks (AFIN) as a 
replacement for the previously-used term AF-GIG. The AFIN is defined as the globally 
interconnected, end-to-end set of Air Force information capabilities, and associated processes for 
collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing information on-demand to 
warfighters, policy-makers, and support personnel, including owned, leased and contracted 
communications and computing systems and services, software (including applications), data, 
security services, other associated services, and national security systems. The terms AF 
Network (AFNET) and AF Network-Secure (AFNET-S) are introduced to refer to  the Air 
Force’s underlying Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and Secure Internet 
Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). This publication applies to all military and civilian AF 
personnel, members of the AF Reserve Command (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), third-
party governmental employee and contractor support personnel in accordance with appropriate 
provisions contained in memoranda support agreements and AF contracts. Violations shall serve 
as a basis for denying individual’s access to the AFIN. The authorities to waive wing/unit level 
requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number 
following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, 
Table 1.1 for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Requests for 
waivers must be submitted through HQ AFSPC/A3 to the OPR listed above for consideration 
and approval. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of

1.  General. 
1.1.  In accordance with AFPD 10-17, the Commander, AF Space Command (AFSPC/CC) is 
responsible for the overall command and control, security and defense of the AFIN. 
AFSPC/CC is responsible for the command, control, implementation, security, operation, 
maintenance, sustainment, configuration, and defense of the AFNET/AFNET-S. Cyber 
orders issued by AFSPC/CC or his/her delegated representative are military orders issued by 
order of the Secretary of the Air Force. 
1.2.  The Unified Command Plan gives the Commander, U. S. Strategic Command 
(CDRUSSTRATCOM) responsibility to direct operations and defense of the Department of 
Defense (DoD) Information Networks (DoDIN). CDRUSSTRATCOM, either directly or via 
Commander, U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), issues such orders as required to 
operate and defend the DoDIN and direct other cyberspace operations as required in support 
of requesting Combatant Commanders (CCDRs). 24 AF (AFCYBER) is the AF component 
to USCYBERCOM and, as such, is responsible for ensuring assigned/attached AF forces 
perform the missions and tasks assigned by USCYBERCOM. 
1.3.  Command and Control, General. 
1.3.1.  Classified processes governing C2 of AF offensive and defensive cyberspace 
operations conducted by AF Cyber Mission Forces are addressed in a classified CJCS 
Execute Order (title classified) issued on 21 Jun 13. 
1.3.2.  When necessary to respond to a critical cyber event, as declared by 
CDRUSSTRATCOM 
or 
CDRUSCYBERCOM, 
AFSPC/CC, 
his/her 
delegated 
representative, or 24 AF/AFCYBER/CC may request applicable AF forces (e.g., 
Communications Focal Point (CFP) personnel within a Communications Squadron, etc.) 
be attached for tactical control to 24 AF/AFCYBER for the duration of the event. Due to 
the immediate nature of most cyber events, approval of the attachment will likely be 
AFI10-1701  5 MARCH 2014 
  3  
granted/transmitted verbally or electronically with hard copy orders to follow, per 
guidance in AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. 
1.3.3.  All cyber orders must be complied with in the timeline directed.  See section 2.2.2 
for temporary relief from orders. 
1.4.  USSTRATCOM/USCYBERCOM issues orders via various formats that include but are 
not limited to Tasking Orders (TASKORDs) and Operation Orders (OPORDs). Orders 
received from USCYBERCOM will be relayed promptly, where applicable, through 
AFCYBER/CC or from his/her delegated representative to the 624 Operations Center (OC) 
to the tasked units. The 624 OC will relay USCYBERCOM orders to the appropriate units 
utilizing Cyber Tasking Orders (CTOs), Cyber Control Orders (CCOs), Time Compliance 
Network Orders (TCNOs), Maintenance Tasking Orders (MTOs), or Special Instructions 
(SPINS); hereafter referred to as cyber orders. AFCYBER/CC, through the 624 OC, may add 
AF-specific tasks to an OPORD; however, the original OPORD must remain intact. 
1.4.1.  Compliance with cyber orders is mandatory. Commanders shall ensure compliance 
with orders issued pursuant to this instruction and hold personnel and organizations 
accountable for the consequences of non-compliance (T-2). 
1.4.1.1.  Military personnel and civilian employees may be subject to administrative 
and/or judicial sanctions if they knowingly, willfully, or negligently compromise, 
damage, or place at risk information and information systems by failure to comply 
with cyber orders issued by AFSPC/CC or his/her delegated representative. 
1.4.1.2.  Defense contractors are responsible for ensuring employees perform in 
accordance with the terms of the contracts and applicable directives, laws, and 
regulations. Violations by contractor personnel will be reported to contracting officers 
for disposition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and applicable 
contract provisions. Future contracts shall include terms that alert contractors that 
noncompliance may serve as the basis for revoking access to the AFIN for individual 
violators, and that noncompliance will be a factor considered in contract performance 
evaluations (T-2). 
1.4.2.  Prior to the implementation of this AFI, orders affecting the AFIN were a function 
of Air Force Network Operations (AFNETOPs). AFNETOPs orders issued prior to the 
issuance of this AFI remain valid, but orders issued after the date of this instruction will 
be issued by AFSPC/CC, his/her designated representative, or 24 AF/AFCYBER/CC. 
1.5.  Types of Orders. 
1.5.1.  AF CTO. AF CTOs are operational type orders issued to perform specific actions 
at specific time frames in support of AF and Joint requirements. AF CTOs are generally 
derived from USCYBERCOM orders and issued by AFCYBER via the 624 OC. 
AFSPC/CC or his/her delegated representative will issue AF CTOs directly (via 24 AF 
and the 624 OC) to direct the execution of cyberspace operations to protect and defend 
the AFIN. 
1.5.2.  AF CCO. CCOs are used to build/shape the portion of cyberspace to be employed 
in support of a Combatant Command (CCMD) operation or in response to adversary 
actions. 
  4  
AFI10-1701  5 MARCH 2014 
1.5.3.  AF TCNO. TCNOs are orders issued to direct the immediate patching of 
information systems to mitigate or eliminate exploitation vulnerabilities. These orders 
have a significant implication if not accomplished in a timely manner. 
1.5.4.  AF MTOs. MTOs are routine tasks that enhance network security with a medium 
to low risk associated with the task. 
1.5.5.  AF SPINS. SPINS provide amplifying instructions for planning, execution, and 
assessment of AF CTOs and CCOs. 
1.5.6.  C4 NOTAMs. Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Notices to 
Airmen (C4 NOTAMs) are used to disseminate network information that does not direct 
specific action to be taken or compliance to be tracked. 
1.6.  AF Cyber Orders Flow Process. Figure 1 graphically depicts the flow of cyber orders. 
Figure 1.  The AF Cyber Orders Flow Process 
 
1.6.1.  Cyber Orders Distribution. Applicable cyber orders are distributed by the 624 OC 
to major commands (MAJCOMs), field operating agencies (FOAs), direct reporting units 
(DRUs), MAJCOM Communications Coordination Centers (MCCCs), AF Component 
Commands and associated Air Operations Centers (AOCs) and AFFOR Communications 
Control Centers (ACCCs) for actions affecting assets (e.g., personnel, information 
systems, etc.) not under the direct control or ownership of 24 AF. For purposes of this 
Instruction, the term MCCC also includes organizational structures established at the 
discretion of a MAJCOM which perform the same functions as an MCCC. 
AFI10-1701  5 MARCH 2014 
  5  
1.7.  Operational Reports (OPREP). All commanders are required to release OPREPS in 
accordance with AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Various cyber events/incidents, 
especially those impacting mission readiness/capability, will require an OPREP (T-2). 
2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 
2.1.  Commander, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC/CC). In accordance with AFPD 10-
17, AFSPC/CC is responsible for the overall command and control, security and defense of 
the AFIN. AFSPC/CC is responsible for the command, control, implementation, security, 
operation, maintenance, sustainment, configuration, and defense of the AFNET/AFNET-S. 
These day-to-day authorities may be delegated. 
2.2.  Commander, Twenty-Fourth Air Force (24 AF (AFCYBER)/CC). 24 AF is the Air 
Force component to USCYBERCOM. 24 AF/CC, when acting as AFCYBER/CC or when 
executing authorities delegated by AFSPC/CC, will: 
2.2.1.  Issue cyber orders as needed for the operation, defense, maintenance and control 
of the AFIN to Major Commands (MAJCOMs), wings, Integrated Network Operations 
and Support Centers (I-NOSCs), and CFPs via the 624 OC. 
2.2.2.  Within established criteria, approve or deny requests from affected organizations 
for relief from execution of cyber orders if such orders might degrade or impact any 
unit’s ability to successfully complete assigned missions. 
2.2.3.  Represent AF equities to USCYBERCOM/USSTRATCOM when direction for 
operation and defense of the AFIN would degrade or impact any AF unit’s ability to 
successfully complete assigned missions. 24 AF/CC (AFCYBER) will coordinate with 
USCYBERCOM/USSTRATCOM on behalf of affected organizations to resolve such 
issues. 
2.2.4.  Coordinate 
with 
affected 
AF 
organizations 
and 
CCDRs 
DoDIN 
Operations/defensive cyberspace operations (DCO) organizations to resolve conflicts 
between USCYBERCOM/USSTRATCOM or AF direction and CCDR direction for 
AFIN resources supporting CCDR missions. 
2.2.5.  Present forces to USCYBERCOM and other CCDRs as required in support of 
cyberspace operations as directed. 
2.3.  624th Operations Center (624 OC). The 624 OC is the 24 AF/AFCYBER operations 
center responsible for issuing cyber orders as directed by 24 AF/AFCYBER/CC. The 624 OC 
will: 
2.3.1.  Manage an Air Force-wide tasking system for AF cyber orders as needed. As 
directed by AFSPC/CC, or if authority has been delegated, by 24 AF (AFCYBER)/CC, 
the 624 OC will relay USCYBERCOM orders as adopted AF cyber orders to all AF units 
(T-2). 
2.3.2.  Relay Air Force and USCYBERCOM cyber orders to appropriate Air 
Force/AFCYBER units. 624 OC will generate applicable cyber orders to direct AF 
implementation; however, the original USCYBERCOM orders must remain intact. 624 
OC acknowledges receipt of USCYBERCOM orders on behalf of AFCYBER (T-2). 
  6  
AFI10-1701  5 MARCH 2014 
2.3.3.  Oversee compliance with AF and USCYBERCOM cyber orders and relay status 
of those orders to 24 AF/AFCYBER/CC and USCYBERCOM as directed (T-2). 
2.3.4.  Process requests for relief from AF cyber orders and advise the releasing authority 
on 
whether 
to 
grant, 
deny 
or 
seek 
further 
guidance/direction 
from 
USSTRATCOM/USCYBERCOM or AFSPC/CC. If such relief is granted, the 624 OC 
will immediately and concurrently notify affected organizations (T-2). 
2.4.  83rd Network Operations Squadron (NOS), 561st NOS, and 299th Network Operations 
Security Squadron (NOSS). NOSs receive and disseminate cyber orders from the 624 OC. 
The NOS unit structure contains the Integrated Network Operations Support Center (I-
NOSC) and Enterprise Service Unit (ESU) flights/missions. 
2.4.1.  Relay, execute, and track cyber orders to affected MAJCOMs, MCCCs, ACCCs, 
and installation communications units. MAJCOMs, MCCCs and ACCCs pass applicable 
orders to their installation communications units at MAJCOM discretion or if not already 
received from the appropriate NOS (T-2). 
2.4.2.  Coordinate with MAJCOMs, MCCCs, and ACCCs on operational impacts and 
Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to mitigate risk to the AFIN when compliance 
with cyber orders cannot be achieved as directed (T-2). 
2.4.3.  Advise MCCCs, ACCCs, and 624 OC on requests for relief. MCCCs/ACCCs will 
communicate with their subordinate installation communications units. 
2.4.4.  The 299 NOSS interfaces with the 624 OC and performs I-NOSC functions for the 
ANG. In addition to I-NOSC responsibilities the 299 NOSS also acts as the Enterprise 
Services Unit (ESU), Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) and MCCC for the ANG. 299 
NOSS will continue to facilitate the integration of the ANG into the AFIN and work with 
ANG units to baseline and standardize their systems and equipment in accordance with 
AF/AFSPC/24 AF AFIN guidance. 299 NOS will: 
2.4.4.1.  Relay, execute and track cyber orders to ANG CFPs (T-2). 
2.4.4.2.  Report status of compliance with orders to the 624 OC (T-2). 
2.4.4.3.  Coordinate with ANG CFPs on operational impacts and POA&M to mitigate 
risk to the AFIN when relief of orders is granted (T-2). 
2.4.4.4.  Advise ANG CFPs and the 624 OC on requests for relief (T-2). 
2.5.  MAJCOMs, MCCCs, ACCCs, Wings, CFPs, and Program Management Offices 
(PMOs). 
2.5.1.  Organizational commanders will ensure cyber orders are disseminated to and 
executed by their subordinate units (T-2). Commanders or their designated 
representatives may request relief from cyber orders due to operational impacts via 24 
AF/AFCYBER-defined orders relief processes (T-2). However, the request does not 
relieve commanders from implementing cyber orders when capable. Wing Commanders 
(or equivalent) will keep their respective MAJCOM, MCCCs and ACCCs informed of 
such requests for relief and expected operational impact if relief is not granted. Wing 
Commanders over tenant units with operational impact to unique mission systems will 
AFI10-1701  5 MARCH 2014 
  7  
request relief through the owning MAJCOM/organization, keeping host base CFP 
informed (T-2). 
2.5.2.  MAJCOMs and wings will not normally relay cyber orders to subordinate CFPs. 
MCCCs and CFPs will receive these orders simultaneously via the 624 OC and 
supporting I-NOSC. This is only to prevent redundant tasking to the CFPs and does not 
preclude any commander in the CFPs chain of command from exercising their inherent 
command authorities. MCCCs will receive cyber orders from the 624 OC and the 
appropriate I-NOSC and may send them to their installation communications units if not 
already received from the appropriate NOS. 
2.5.3.  MAJCOM Communications Coordination Centers. MCCCs provide MAJCOM 
Commanders and the 624 OC with situational awareness of MAJCOM-unique functional 
system availability (if applicable) and of compliance with network taskings. In some 
cases, MCCCs maintain MAJCOM unique functional systems. MCCCs will: 
2.5.3.1.  Track, assign, and monitor cyber orders issued through the 624 OC and I-
NOSCs. 
2.5.3.2.  Advise the MAJCOM CC on completion of cyber orders or inability to 
complete assigned tasks pertaining to AFNET, PMO, and MAJCOM-unique systems 
as required/directed by the MAJCOM/CC. 
2.5.3.3.  Provide updates on MAJCOM unique network health/status and operational 
impact to the 624 OC. 
2.5.3.4.  Advise MAJCOM/CCs, I-NOSC, and 624 OC, on operational impacts of 
cyber orders to component missions. 
2.5.3.5.  Coordinate conflicting 
guidance with I-NOSCs and CCDR DCO 
organizations. 
2.5.3.6.  Coordinate Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&M) with I-NOSCs and 
CCDR DoDIN Ops/DCO organizations to resolve operational impact issues when 
relief of orders is granted. Ensure POA&Ms are completed for any requests for relief 
and ensure POA&Ms remain updated and current until compliance with the orders is 
achieved. 
2.5.3.7.  Provide situational reports (SITREPS) to their CCDR, MAJCOM and 624 
OC related to outage and other network events impacting the AFIN and/or the 
MAJCOM mission. This requirement does not replace any requirement for OPREP 
reporting outlined in AFI 10-206. 
2.5.4.  AFFOR Communications Control Centers. ACCCs support numbered Air Forces 
(NAF) in their AF and Service component responsibilities. ACCCs provide a similar 
capability as MCCCs and will: 
2.5.4.1.  Comply with cyber orders issued by the 624 OC and I-NOSCs. 
2.5.4.2.  Report completion of cyber orders or inability to complete assigned tasks to 
the I-NOSCs and 624 OC and their respective MCCC and wing. 
2.5.4.3.  Provide updates on component unique network activity, health/status, and 
operational impact to the 624 OC, if applicable. 
  8  
AFI10-1701  5 MARCH 2014 
2.5.4.4.  Advise commanders, MCCCs, and 624 OC, on operational impacts of cyber 
orders to component missions. 
2.5.4.5.  Coordinate conflicting guidance with I-NOSCs and CCDR DoDIN 
Ops/DCO organizations. 
2.5.4.6.  Coordinate POA&Ms with I-NOSCs and CCDR DoDIN Ops/DCO 
organizations to resolve operational impact issues when relief of orders is granted.  
Ensure POA&Ms are completed for any requests for relief and ensure POA&Ms 
remain updated and current until compliance with the orders is achieved. 
2.5.4.7.  Provide SITREPs to their component and the 624 OC related to outage and 
other network events impacting the AFIN or the supported CCMD mission. 
2.5.5.  Communication Focal Points. The base CFPs monitor performance of the local 
network and serve as the conduit for implementing cyber orders. CFPs will: 
2.5.5.1.  Direct applicable personnel (e.g., Client System Support Technicians, 
Functional System Administrators, etc.) to implement cyber orders issued through the 
624 OC and I-NOSCs or through the MAJCOMs (e.g. MCCC or similar structure). 
Provide compliance tracking for all orders that cannot be monitored or tracked 
electronically (T-2). 
2.5.5.2.  Report completion of cyber orders or inability to complete assigned tasks 
that are not electronically visible to their respective wing and MCCC/ACCC. The 
MCCC/ACCC will report through the appropriate I-NOSC to the 624 OC (T-2). 
2.5.5.3.  Provide local commanders with situational awareness of their ability to 
support all required mission areas at their fixed base or deployed location. 
2.5.5.4.  Coordinate with their parent wing and their respective MCCC/ACCC on 
operational impacts and POA&Ms to mitigate risk to the AFIN when relief of orders 
is granted. Ensure POA&Ms are completed for any requests for relief and ensure 
POA&Ms remain updated and current until compliance with the orders is achieved. 
2.5.5.5.  CFPs will provide support to tenant organizations of other Services in 
accordance with the provisions of the applicable Host-Tenant Support Agreement (T-
2). 
2.5.6.  Program Management Offices (PMOs) or PMO-like entities. PMOs or PMO-like 
entities manage the acquisition and sustainment of information technology, including 
National Security Systems (NSS). PMO’s engineer and deliver platform information 
technology, automated information systems (AIS), and outsourced information 
technology (IT). These deliveries may be systems and/or applications based on 
commercial-off-the-shelf or government-off-the-shelf systems, or a hybrid of each. 
PMOs ensure compliance 
with all 
relative directives and orders. 
Due to 
operational/contractual issues, additional testing/validation of software and security 
updates for PMO systems may be required to ensure engineering, interoperability, and 
mission functionality is not jeopardized. PMOs will: 
2.5.6.1.  Comply 
with cyber orders 
issued by 624 OC, via the parent 
MAJCOM/Wing, affecting program systems for which the PMO is responsible. 
AFI10-1701  5 MARCH 2014 
  9  
2.5.6.2.  Request relief from cyber orders due to operational impacts, through the 
appropriate MAJCOM/MCCC to the 624 OC. Systems which cannot meet 
compliance within six months will be further evaluated for risk to the AFIN, impact 
to AF missions if quarantined or disconnected from the AFIN, and cost to implement 
the orders. Within established criteria, 24 AF/CC may accept the risk, require the 
PMO to implement additional risk mitigating actions and/or recommend to the 
AFSPC/CC, as the AF DAA, that the system be quarantined or disconnected from the 
AFIN. Recommendations for quarantine or disconnection due to unacceptable risk 
may result in a Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO), per AFI 33-210, Air 
Force C&A Process. 
2.5.6.3.  Report status of compliance with orders to the appropriate wing, 
MCCC/ACCC, and to 624 OC. 
2.5.6.4.  Coordinate POA&Ms through the appropriate wing and/or MCCC/ACCC to 
the 624 OC on operational impacts and to mitigate risk to the AFIN if relief of orders 
is granted. Ensure POA&Ms are completed for any requests for relief and ensure 
POA&Ms remain updated and current until compliance with the orders is achieved. 
In any case, relief from orders will be governed by the provisions of paragraph 2.5.7.2 
above. 
2.5.6.5.  Update program Technical Orders (TO) as required maintaining compliance 
with cyber orders. Issue Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs) independent of 
cyber orders when needed to update TOs in the field pending formal TO change 
releases. 
2.5.6.6.  Provide SITREP to the MCCC/ACCC, wing and 624 OC related to outage 
and other network events impacting the AFIN and/or the MAJCOM mission. 
3.  Authorized Service Interruptions (ASI). 
3.1.  ASI Definition. ASIs are scheduled periods of network, equipment, or system downtime 
required to perform preventive maintenance actions, software or equipment upgrades or 
replacement, system reboots, etc. There are three defined types of ASIs. 
3.1.1.  Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI). PMI ASIs are required for any 
preventive maintenance actions accomplished on a recurring basis. Examples include 
routine maintenance of server equipment or server reboots required due to the application 
of TCTO/MTO-directed countermeasures. 
3.1.2.  Routine. Routine ASIs are required for any network system changes that will 
require an interruption of service to complete. Examples include service interruptions 
required to perform system/software upgrade, or to repair/replace faulty equipment. 
3.1.3.  Emergency. Emergency ASIs are for those ad hoc events which require an 
immediate service interruption to correct hazardous or degraded conditions where loss of 
human life or of Core Services (DCs, exchange, switches, routers) could occur through 
lack of immediate action. Examples of emergency outages include power problems, 
equipment malfunctions, imminent system failures, or any hazardous condition that 
requires immediate attention and cannot otherwise be scheduled as a routine service 
interruption. 
  10  
AFI10-1701  5 MARCH 2014 
3.2.  Operational Reporting of Mission Impact. Organizations submit OPREPs related to 
outages IAW AFI 10-206. 
3.3.  ASI Approval Authority. 
3.3.1.  The AFSPC/CC or, when authority has been delegated, 24 AF/CC, is the approval 
authority for routine and emergency ASI requests associated with those AFIN links, 
nodes, functional systems, or services on the AFIN (1) directly supporting an active 
CCMD operation; (2) whose compromise or loss could affect national security; or (3) 
whose compromise or loss would degrade or disable critical C2 communications. The 
624 OC is the focal point for the coordination of ASIs that must be approved by both the 
affected installation commander and the 24 AF/CC. 
3.3.2.  The installation commander is the approval authority for all PMI ASI requests that 
do not impact the AFNET/AFNET-S or meet the criteria specified in paragraph 3.3.1 (T-
2). 
3.4.  General ASI Coordination Guidance. 
3.4.1.  Service interruptions will be scheduled at a time that will have the minimum 
impact on operations (T-2). 
3.4.2.  Requesting organizations must complete applicable local level coordination (e.g., 
major tenant unit commanders) on all ASIs prior to submitting the ASI request for 
approval. 
4.  Periods of Non-Disruption (PONDs). 
4.1.  PONDs are directed by USCYBERCOM to halt all maintenance actions within either a 
geographic or functional Area of Responsibility (AOR), or for very specific systems and or 
assets crossing one or more AORs. PONDS are intended to ensure commanders have full 
availability of critical C2 capabilities. 
4.2.  PONDs will only be issued to support real-world operations, crisis situations, and 
significant events that may negatively impact national security. 
4.3.  Requests for PONDs will be channeled through the ASI coordination chain to 
USCYBERCOM for final approval/disapproval.
