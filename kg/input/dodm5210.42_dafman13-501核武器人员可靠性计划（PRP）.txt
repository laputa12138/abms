PROCEDURES 
 
 
1. PRP KEY ELEMENTS. PRP is the commander’s program. The commander is exclusively 
accountable for determining the fitness for duty of individuals subject to PRP. DoD Components and 
subordinate organizations may establish procedures for implementation of this manual but will not 
establish additional PRP requirements. 
 
a. PRP is a critical link in nuclear surety. PRP-required screening programs, personnel security 
investigations (PSIs), and the PRP continuous evaluation requirement are designed to mitigate risks 
and protect the nuclear deterrent from insider threats. As such, PRP-supporting DoD Component 
heads and supervisors must aid reviewing and certifying officials in their initial and continuing 
evaluation duties by ensuring they are provided all relevant information on those trusted with PRP 
duties. 
 
b. Only those individuals who demonstrate the highest levels of integrity and dependability 
will be chosen for PRP duties. PRP ensures that each person trusted with U.S. nuclear weapons, NC2 
systems and equipment, PCM, and SNM, in accordance with Reference (k), meets the highest levels 
of reliability. Those trusted with PRP duties have an obligation to report any behavior or 
circumstance about themselves or others in PRP that may affect reliability or result in an unsafe or 
insecure condition. 
 
c. Only certified personnel will be assigned to designated PRP positions. All PRP positions 
will be formally designated as either critical or controlled and restricted to the minimum number 
required to accomplish the mission. Unless required by other PRP duties, the reviewing official need 
not be designated as a PRP position. Examples of typical PRP positions are shown in Appendix 3 to 
this enclosure.  (ADDED) (DAF)  Administratively qualified individuals (PRP status B code) 
will be assigned to a designated PRP coded position number (at gaining assignment only).  (T-
3)  This is administrative in nature and is not directly related to nuclear surety. 
 
 
2. EVALUATION GUIDELINES. Certifying officials are responsible for ensuring that all 
military, civilian, and contractor personnel under the terms of their contracts assigned to PRP 
positions meet all of the requirements of the continuing evaluation process. Certifying officials must 
observe the behavior and performance of members certified under PRP on a frequent and consistent 
basis. The primary consideration for certifying officials should be that the sum of all observations, 
including personal and peer observation and reporting, is sufficiently detailed to allow for thorough 
evaluation of the individual.  (ADDED) (DAF)  The PRP is not intended to act as a quality 
control tool to decertify, disqualify or permanently disqualify individuals solely for assignment 
or risk avoidance.  The denial of eligibility or the revocation of certification for assignment to 
PRP positions is neither a punitive measure nor the basis for disciplinary action (Reference 
(c)).  The failure of an individual to be certified for assignment to PRP duties does not 
necessarily reflect unfavorably on the individual’s suitability for assignment to other duties 
(Reference (c)). 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
ENCLOSURE 3 
18 
 
 
 
a. Personnel Not Under Routine Observation. Certifying officials must maintain an 
equivalent level of confidence in the reliability of personnel whose normal duties do not provide 
for routine observation, excluding periods of administrative absence (leave, pass, temporary 
duty, or temporary additional duty). Individuals certified under PRP must agree that certifying 
officials and CMAs can review certain information and materials concerning their on- and 
off-duty activities (medical, mental health, police, employment records, credit reports, etc.). 
(1) DoD Components will develop procedures and approval authority for personnel 
not under routine observation. The approval authority may be delegated in writing to a 
single official of at least O-7 military grade/Senior Executive Service member on the staff. 
All exceptions to routine observation will be submitted for review on an annual basis to the 
DASD(NM). The certifying official will submit a specific plan outlining the application of 
the tools outlined in paragraph 2a(2) of this enclosure, tailored to the circumstances of the 
individual being considered, that provides for the equivalent level of confidence mentioned 
in paragraphs 1a, b, and c of this enclosure.  (ADDED) (DAF)  The Secretary of the Air 
Force has appointed AF/A10 as approval authority. 
 
(2) For periods in which a PRP-certified individual was not subject to continuing 
evaluation, the certifying official must ensure that the individual’s reliability during these 
times meets PRP requirements. The certifying official will employ additional means and 
methods sufficient to assist in that determination (e.g., an additional personal interview, 
periodic medical records review, additional drug screening, contact with civilian employer of 
Reserve and National Guard personnel or previous supervisor, service or personnel records 
review, periodic criminal records and history checks, and credit checks). 
 
(a) (ADDED) (DAF)  Air Reserve Component (ARC) individuals (except for AF 
AEAOs) who exceed 75 calendar days without performing official nuclear duty/training 
will be removed from PRP duties (PRP status G code) and entry control authorities will be 
notified.  (T-1)  Upon return, the individual’s personnel and health records will be screened 
for suitability factors for PRP (back to the date of the G code).  (T-1)  CO will conduct an 
interview; this screening and interview will be documented prior to returning individual to 
active PRP status.  (T-1)  Recertification is not required.  
 
(b) (ADDED) (DAF)  PRP certified individuals who exceed 60 calendar days 
with no ability for continuing evaluation for purposes of deployment/temporary duty 
(TDY)/all leave types are not required to contact their CO prior to medical care (PRP 
status K code).  (T-1)  Upon return, the individual’s personnel and health records will be 
screened for suitability factors for PRP (back to date of K code).  CO will conduct an 
interview.  (T-1)  This screening and interview will be documented prior to returning 
individual to an active PRP status.  (T-1)  Recertification is not required.  
 
b. Medical Care. When an individual’s performance may be impaired by medical care or 
the use of prescribed medication or short-term stress, the certifying official will be notified to 
decide if the individual needs to be removed from PRP duties for the period of medical care, 
stress, or use of medication, as determined by the CMA.  (ADDED) (DAF)  Immediate 
notification will be made to a CO or designee if a psychoactive medication, narcotic or 
sedating drugs are prescribed that could adversely affect the individual’s cognitive ability 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
ENCLOSURE 3 
19 
 
 
to make critical decisions, as determined by the CMA.  (T-1) 
 
(1) The CMA is responsible for determining what information qualifies as medical factors 
that may affect an individual’s suitability for PRP and will convey these factors to the certifying 
official. (ADDED) (DAF)  Web questionnaires, completed by PRP individuals, will be reviewed 
within five MTF duty days.  (T-1)  Components may establish protocols that may be applied by 
independent duty medical technicians (IDMTs) at munitions support squadrons and independent duty 
corpsmen (IDCs) not designated as CMAs.  (ADDED) (DAF)  IDMTs will not be CMAs.  (T-1)  
At GSUs without a CMA, the IDMT will consult with the CMA at the servicing MTF to discuss 
suitability factors that could impact PRP.  (T-1)  The CMA will determine what factors are 
impacting PRP and the IDMT will convey those factors to the CO prior to the individual 
performing PRP duties.  (T-1)  The IDMT will document the name of the CMA contacted in 
the health record.  (T-1)  MUNSS’ IDMTs formally trained by the lead or alt lead CMA and 
designated by the MTF commander, in writing, may convey potential suitability factors that 
could impact PRAP duties to the MUNSS CO prior to consultation with CMA to preserve 
immediate notification requirements.  (T-1)  In such incidents, the servicing MTF CMA will 
review the encounter within one MTF duty day and determine medical suitability factors, if 
any additional factors impacting PRAP duties are identified by the CMA, the CO will be 
notified.  (T-1) 
 
(2) A sexual assault victim certified under PRP is eligible for both the Restricted and 
Unrestricted reporting options in accordance with Volume 1 of DoD Instruction 6495.02 (Reference 
(l)). If electing restricted reporting, the victim is required to advise the CMA of any factors that 
could have an adverse impact on the victim’s performance, reliability, or safety while performing 
PRP duties. If necessary, the CMA will inform the certifying official that the person in question 
should be suspended from PRP status, without revealing the individual is a victim of sexual assault, 
thus preserving the Restricted Report. 
 
c. Contractor PRP Continuing Evaluation. Contractor employees who, under the terms of the 
contracts, have been determined eligible by the contract monitor and have been assigned to PRP 
positions will be annotated in the DoD designated personnel security information system of record 
(currently Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS)) (ADDED) (DAF) Defense Information 
System for Security (DISS) or successor system.  The contractor company’s facility security 
officer (FSO) will manage clearance records for their cleared employees.  Any file 
documentation that can’t be submitted through JPAS (ADDED) (DAF) DISS or successor system 
should be submitted to the DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) (ADDED) (DAF) 
Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) Division A, 600 10th Street, Suite 160, Ft. Meade, MD 
20755, or the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, Personnel Security Management 
Office for Industry (PSMO-I), 7556 Teague Road, Suite 500, Hanover, MD 21076, whichever holds 
the clearance or reviews and triages continuous evaluation information.  (ADDED) (DAF)  Contact 
the servicing IPO regarding security requirements for contractors and for required 
documentation.  On receipt of any information that may affect the reliability of a contractor 
employee under the PRP, the DoD CAF or PSMO-I will forward that information to the appropriate 
certifying official.

3. REMOVAL AND REINSTATEMENT 
 
a. Suspension. Suspension is used to remove a member from PRP duties without starting 
decertification action. Although a recommendation to suspend may come from many sources, only 
the certifying official is authorized to determine whether suspension is appropriate. 
 
b. Decertification (ADDED) (DAF) or permanent disqualification. Any individual who 
fails to meet the reliability standards specified in this manual will not be assigned to, or 
continued in, duties of a PRP position. PRP certification will be revoked on a certifying 
official’s determination and reviewing official approval that an individual no longer meets PRP 
standards. 
 
c. Requalification or Reinstatement. A certifying official or reviewing official may request 
requalification consideration or reinstatement of an individual’s PRP certification for individuals 
who were disqualified or decertified, provided the reason or condition of the disqualification or 
decertification or ineligibility no longer exists. Requalification and reinstatement procedures are 
in Appendix 1 to this enclosure.

PRP ADMINISTRATION 
 
 
1. ROLES 
 
a. Reviewing and Certifying Officials 
 
(1) The reviewing official is responsible for the management of PRP. That official ensures 
that the requirements of PRP are implemented, and all personnel comply with applicable standards. 
The reviewing official will review individual personnel and health records, as necessary. Before 
assuming PRP certifying official duties, the reviewing official must screen and certify the certifying 
official. Commanders and reviewing officials who are not in a PRP position may certify their 
designated certifying official and subordinate commanders. 
 
(a) (ADDED) (DAF)  Reviewing official (RO)/CO may have access to portions of 
the health records where the CMA has identified suitability factors for PRP.  Review of the 
health records must be under the guidance of the CMA.    
 
(b) (ADDED) (DAF)  Reviews all decertification and permanent disqualifications.  
(T-1)  
 
(2) The certifying officials will be designated as critical or controlled PRP positions 
commensurate with the highest category of any nuclear duty position in the unit or activity 
concerned. The certifying official makes a judgment on the reliability of each individual identified 
for PRP duties. 
 
(a) (ADDED) (DAF)  RO.  The commander or designated military/civilian at a level 
above the CO, who is responsible for nuclear operations.  The RO cannot be the CO for the 
same unit.  For example, the CO at a group could be the RO for subordinate units but not for 
the group staff personnel, the RO would be the next level of command in the PRP operational 
chain for the group staff personnel.  
 
(b) (ADDED) (DAF)  CO.  At wing/delta-level or below, the commander or 
director.  If required to serve in a PRP position will be certified by the RO.  (T-1)  
Commanders and directors above the wing/delta-level may perform the duties of a CO and do 
not require PRP certification, unless they serve in a PRP coded position.  (T-1)  If a CO is the 
wing/delta commander/director equivalent, the next level of command in the PRP operational 
chain will assume RO responsibilities.  (T-1) 
 
(c) (ADDED) (DAF)  COs for MAJCOM commanders will be the Vice Chief of 
Staff of the Air Force.   
 
(d) (ADDED) (DAF)  COs for FLDCOM commanders will be the Vice Chief of

(e) (ADDED) (DAF)  The installation commander or director may designate the 
Chief of the Command Post as the CO for command post personnel. 
 
(f) (ADDED) (DAF)  Limited delegation at nuclear capable installations / units.  
Delegation of duties should be limited to instances of TDY/extended absence and not 
utilized on a routine basis.  ROs and COs may delegate authority, in writing, to their 
deputy/vice or equivalent (this may include director of operations, operations officer and 
maintenance operations officer at the unit level).  At or below wing/delta-level delegated 
COs must be in a PRP position certified (critical or controlled) equal to, or higher than the 
personnel they are certifying and appropriately trained. (T-0)  If no designation exists, then 
the next higher echelon in the operational chain of command will assume CO duties.  (T-1) 
If the CO is decertified or otherwise removed from duties, the RO will appoint a 
replacement to perform CO duties, as appropriate.  (T-1) 
 
(g) (ADDED) (DAF) Limited delegation at conventional installations:  
Commanders, directors or AQC who perform administrative qualifications duties are not 
required to be PRP certified.  Commanders/directors may delegate administrative 
qualification authority, in writing, to their deputy/vice (or equivalent) in their operational 
chain of command.  If there is no deputy/vice (or equivalent), delegation can be designated 
to the section commander (if any).  If no designation exists, then the next higher echelon in 
the operational chain of command will assume administrative qualification duties.  (T-1)  
Delegation of duties will be limited and not used on a routine basis, except for the AQC.  (T-
1)   
 
b. CMA. The CMA will act as a PRP medical consultant to provide recommendations to 
reviewing and certifying officials on individuals’ suitability to perform PRP duties.  (ADDED) 
(DAF)  The CMA will provide enough information to the CO, or equivalent, to enable 
informed decisions.  (T-1)  CMAs may generalize communication to protect sensitive health 
related information, but still must provide the CO, or equivalent, with all relevant factors 
that could negatively impact an individual’s suitability for PRP duties.  (T-1)  This can be 
done through the installation PRAP or unit PRP monitor, as long as the CO, or equivalent, 
gets the information.   
 
(1) (ADDED) (DAF)  The lead/alt lead CMA may train and designate, in 
writing, other medical personnel to aid in screening the individual’s health records for 
suitability factors.   
 
c. DoD Component and Installation PRP Monitor. The DoD Component or installation PRP 
monitor: 
 
(1) Coordinates and distributes PRP information to the reviewing and certifying officials, 
unit commanders, PRP monitors, and supporting staff agencies.

4. PRP REVIEW AND EVALUATION 
 
a. DoD Components will ensure that PRP is reviewed and evaluated for effectiveness 
during appropriate inspections and staff visits at all levels of command. 
 
b. PII collected, maintained, used, or disseminated in PRP execution must be safeguarded to 
prevent any unauthorized use. The DoD Components will ensure the collection, use, and 
dissemination of PII complies with the requirements of References (i) and (j). 
 
 
5. PERSONNEL TRANSFER. When a PRP-certified individual is transferred to another PRP 
position, he or she must be interviewed by the new certifying official. If this transfer does not 
involve a change in the reviewing official, the individual’s medical and personnel records do not 
need to be re-screened.  (ADDED) (DAF)  A new DAF Form 286, Personnel Reliability Program 
(PRP) Qualification/Certification Action, is not required.  MilPDS will reflect the original 
certification date on the most current DAF Form 286.  
 
a. (ADDED) (DAF)  PRP to PRP Transfer.  Administrative qualification does 
not apply.  When a PRP certified individual transfers to another PRP position resulting 
in the change of RO and CO, the losing installation/unit will update the MilPDS with 
PRP status B code effective the date individual last performed PRP duties.  (T-1) 
Individual will be under continuous monitoring until rescreened.  Gaining 
installation/unit rescreens from the PRP status B code to present (to include a new PRP 
Questionnaire) and completes a new DAF Form 286.  Forward the DAF Form 286 to 
AFPC utilizing Case Management System (CMS) or successor system.  Individuals 
separating under PALACE CHASE/FRONT programs and transferring PRP to PRP 
will be J coded versus B coded for that transfer.   
 
b. (ADDED) (DAF)  If a certified PRP individual transfers to a PRP position on 
the wing/delta staff, the wing/delta commander becomes the CO and the next highest 
commander/director will become the RO, requiring a new interview to be conducted via 
a new DAF Form 286 prior to individual continuing PRP duties.  The new form will 
need to reflect all previous screening dates except for the Personnel Security 
Investigation (PSI) and the form will reflect a new certification date.  (T-1) 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 1 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
29 
 
 
 
c. (ADDED) (DAF)  When a PRP certified (includes interim and additional duty) 
individual is transferred to a non-PRP position, the certification will administratively 
terminate.  The installation/unit monitor will update MilPDS (PRP status J code) with the date 
last performed PRP duties.  
 
d. (ADDED) (DAF)  Local Non-PRP to PRP Transfer (In Place Certification).  A PRP 
certification process for personnel transferring from a non-PRP position to a PRP position at 
their current installation of assignment (PRP Status L code).  This could be due to changes in 
mission requirements or a Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA).  This process must have 
equivalent record access for a RO and CO.  This does not require administrative qualification, 
nor does this apply to administratively qualified personnel (PRP status B code).  (T-1)  If 
required, PRP status K code may be used if it is not possible to complete certification prior to 
deployment/TDY/leave. 
 
e. (ADDED) (DAF)  All PRP certified individuals who change from critical to 
controlled PRP position or controlled to critical PRP position with the same RO will require a 
new DAF Form 286 using the original screening and PRP certification dates but a new PRP 
status.  (T-1) 
 
 
6. SUSPENSION. When suspending an individual and removing them from PRP duties, the 
certifying official will notify the individual and their supervisor of the nature and circumstances of 
the suspension.  (ADDED) (DAF)  The servicing IPO will be notified to determine if it must be 
reported to the counter-insider threat program and whether the nature and circumstances of 
the suspension overlap the CV and vice versa, the servicing IPO will notify the PRAP monitor 
of DISS incidents that may require immediate notification to the CO or equivalent for 
suspension determination.  A suspension can initially last up to 3 months. The certifying official 
may extend the period of suspension to 1 year in 3-month increments.  (ADDED) (DAF)  If the 
reason or conditions for suspension still exist and impact’s reliability, the individual will be 
decertified.  All actions to decertify the individual must be complete by the 1-year expiration 
and not after.  (T-0)  A CO may return individual to PRP duties at any point during the 
suspension timeframe if the reason or conditions for suspension no longer exist or impacts to 
reliability are mitigated.  An RO or CO who is suspended from PRP (not able to perform their 
operational duties) may perform PRP administrative functions.  
 
7. DECERTIFICATION. Individuals who have been determined by the certifying official to no 
longer meet PRP standards will be decertified. Within 15 workdays of the determination, the 
certifying official will advise the individual, in writing, of the reasons for decertification and of the 
requirement for review by the reviewing official. (ADDED) (DAF)  Documentation for 
decertification or permanent disqualification is accomplished on DAF Form 286A, PRP 
Permanent Disqualification or Decertification Action, using the form’s instructions. 
 
a. To ensure uniform application of the PRP standards specified by this manual, the reviewing 
official will review each case involving a decertification decision. The reviewing official may seek 
additional information or explanations of extenuating circumstances from the certifying official, the 
CMA, personnel officials, and the individual concerned, if appropriate. 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 1 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
30 
 
 
 
b. After reviewing the decertification action, the reviewing official will notify the individual 
and the certifying official of the findings and conclusion within 15 workdays. In the case of a 
DoD contractor employee, the contractor will be told that the employee has been decertified and 
may no longer be assigned to or continue performing PRP duties in compliance with contractual 
requirements.  (ADDED) (DAF)  The contracting officer or their representative is responsible 
for communicating this to the contractor. 
 
c. If the reviewing official approves the decertification, the individual will be removed from 
positions requiring PRP certification, and the action will be made a matter of permanent record.  
(ADDED) (DAF)  To decertify or permanent disqualify an individual, the RO will: 
 
(1) (ADDED) (DAF)  Receive CO recommendation for decertification or 
permanent disqualification documented on the DAF Form 286A. 
 
(2) (ADDED) (DAF)  Document the decertification or permanent disqualification 
decision using the DAF Form 286A.  Installation PRAP or unit PRP monitor will assist with 
this. 
 
(3) (ADDED) (DAF)  Ensure the installation PRAP monitor forwards the DAF 
Form 286A to AFPC utilizing CMS or successor system.   
 
(4) (ADDED) (DAF)  Ensure the installation PRAP monitor maintains an 
electronic copy on file until the original is verified and filed in the individual’s OMPF.   
 
(5) (ADDED) (DAF)  Ensure that the installation/unit monitor updates MilPDS 
with the applicable PRP status code effective the date RO signed the DAF Form 286A.  For 
civilian employees, ensure the CPF updates DCPDS with applicable PRP status code effective 
the date RO signed the DAF Form 286A. 
 
(6) (ADDED) (DAF)  Ensure the servicing IPO is notified if the nature and 
circumstances of the decertification or permanent disqualification overlap the CV or counter-
insider threat program.  
 
(7) (ADDED) (DAF)  If the RO disapproves, the case file and DAF Form 286A are 
destroyed.  
 
 
8. REQUALIFICATION AND REINSTATEMENT 
 
a. DoD Component heads are the approval authority for requalification or reinstatement.

CERTIFICATION 
 
 
1. CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. The certifying official will judge the reliability of each 
individual identified for PRP duties. This will be based on the appropriate PSI, review of personnel 
and health records, position qualification requirements, and a personal interview. Certification will 
be formally documented and maintained while the individual is performing PRP duties. The 
certification will terminate administratively when an individual transfers to a position not requiring 
PRP certification. 
 
a. Qualifying Criteria. Due to the special trust placed in them, personnel assigned to PRP duties 
must: 
 
(1) Be dependable, mentally alert, and technically proficient commensurate with their 
respective duty requirements. 
 
(2) Be flexible in adjusting to changes in the working environment, including ability to 
work in adverse or emergency situations.

(T-1)  
 
b. PSI. The primary purpose of a PSI and national security adjudication is to ensure a trusted 
workforce. Standards for access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties are 
outlined in DoD Manual 5200.02 (Reference (p)). Personnel selected for designated NC2 PRP 
positions in accordance with Reference (k) will be subject to random counterintelligence-scope 
polygraph examinations administered in accordance with DoD Instruction 5210.91 (Reference (q)). 
All civilian, active duty military, Reserve and National Guard personnel, and contractor personnel 
under the terms of contracts assigned to PRP positions will be subject to a periodic reinvestigation 
every 5 years, in accordance with Reference (p).  (ADDED) (DAF)  Individuals are enrolled in 
the CV program, which requires collecting an updated standard form (SF)-86 at a five-year 
periodicity.  The five-year periodicity is determined by one of the following activities:  
continuous enrollment (CE) enrollment date, latest background investigation closed date or 
SF-86 signature date, whichever activity is most recent.  SF-86 with a signed date within five 
years and two months of the anniversary of last background investigation closed date or within 
five years of the date of signature on the last SF-86 are considered current.  Individuals will

duties. The personal interview will not be conducted as a part of a routine orientation briefing for 
new personnel. 
 
f. Position Qualification. The individual must demonstrate potential for technical proficiency 
commensurate with nuclear weapon or NC2 duty position requirements prior to PRP certification. 
 
 
2. INITIAL CERTIFICATION 
 
a. Security Clearance Eligibility Requirements. As part of the required screening process, the 
certifying official will verify personnel security clearance eligibility. If appropriate, the certifying 
official will review the results of the investigation. The DoD Components may establish procedures 
to facilitate timely screening of individuals required to support wartime missions.  (ADDED) (DAF)  
Reference Appendix 2 to Enclosure 3 paragraph 1.b.  (T-0) 
 
(1) Critical Position. (ADDED) (DAF)  High tier (formerly T5) initial investigation and 
Top Secret eligibility, a security clearance to have been completed ((ADD) (DAF) background 
investigation closed (ADDED) (DAF), CE enrollment date or SF-86 signature date, whichever 
activity is the most recent) within the last 5 years and favorably adjudicated in accordance with 
Reference (p) is required. If it becomes necessary to consider an individual for a critical position and 
the required investigation has not been completed, the certifying official may grant interim 
certification (see section 3 of this appendix for interim certification conditions). However, 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 2 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
36 
 
 
individuals with current Top Secret PSI may be PRP certified if: 
 
(a) The periodic reinvestigation was submitted to the Office of Personnel 
Management (ADDED) (DAF) SF-86 will be submitted to DCSA prior to the 5-year 
anniversary of the last (ADDED) (DAF) background investigation closed date, CE 
enrollment date or SF-86 and authorization signature date, whichever activity is the 
most recent.  
 
(b) The certifying official has documented a review of the completed 
security questionnaire and is satisfied there are no known risks. 
 
(2) Controlled Position. (ADDED) (DAF)  Moderate tier (formerly T3) initial 
investigation and Secret eligibility or higher level investigation, a security clearance to have 
been completed ((ADDED) (DAF) background investigation closed (ADDED) (DAF), CE 
enrollment date or SF-86 signature date, whichever activity is the most recent) within 
the last 5 years, and favorably adjudicated in accordance with Reference (p) is required. If it 
becomes necessary to consider an individual for a controlled position and the required 
investigation has not been completed, the certifying official may grant interim certification 
(see section 3 of this appendix for interim certification conditions).  (ADDED) (DAF)  
There is no interim certification for controlled positions. (T-0) 
b. Medical Evaluation. As part of the required screening process, the CMA or other 
medical personnel specifically trained and designated will evaluate health history and records to 
determine the candidate’s medical qualifications under PRP standards.  (ADDED) (DAF) All 
available health and dental records (electronic/hard copy and defined by this manual) will 
be reviewed during the initial certification process.  (T-1) 
 
(1) The CMA is the sole authority in determining what information qualifies as 
medical factors that may affect an individual’s suitability for PRP and will convey these 
factors to the certifying official. If the health records review is conducted by medical 
personnel other than the CMA, and questionable information about an individual’s medical 
suitability for assignment to a PRP position is identified, the records will be referred to the 
CMA for further evaluation. The results of the CMA’s review will be provided to the 
certifying official, who will make the determination on the individual’s suitability to perform 
PRP duties.  (ADDED) (DAF)  See Appendix 2 to Enclosure 3 paragraphs 1.c.(1).(a) – 
(e). 
 
(2) If available medical records are inadequate, the CMA will conduct an evaluation 
to determine medical qualification under PRP standards. That medical evaluation will 
include a mental health consultation when indicated. 
 
c. Personnel File Review. The certifying official will review in detail the individual’s 
personnel file, other official records, and information locally available about the individual’s 
reliability.  (ADDED) (DAF)  See Appendix 2 to Enclosure 3 paragraphs 1.d.(1).(a) – (e). 
 
d. Personal Interview. During a personal interview, the certifying official will inform the 
individual of their significance to national security and nuclear surety, PRP standards, the need 
for reliable performance, the individual’s responsibility for self-reporting, and peer review of 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 2 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
37 
 
 
factors and situations that could adversely affect job performance or reliability. The certifying 
official will determine suitability using Appendix 4 to this enclosure as a guide. 
 
e. Drug Testing. Mandatory drug testing for illegal or unauthorized substances of all military 
and civilian personnel assigned to PRP duties will be conducted in accordance with DoD Instructions 
1010.01 (Reference (r)) and 1010.09 (Reference (s)). Drug testing requirements applicable to 
contractor personnel assigned to PRP duties will be prescribed in applicable contracts in accordance 
with Reference (h).  (ADDED) (DAF) For miliary, civilian and contractor PRP personnel initial 
certification (first time ever certified in PRP and personnel returning to their nuclear career 
field) a drug test will need to be accomplished 30 duty days prior to or 30 duty days after the 
PRP initial certification date.  (T-0)   
 
f. Position Qualification. The candidate must demonstrate potential for technical proficiency 
commensurate with nuclear weapon or NC2 duty position requirements. 
 
 
3. INTERIM CERTIFICATION 
 
a. Critical Position. If it becomes necessary to consider an individual for a critical position and 
the required investigation has not been completed, interim critical certification may be made under 
the following conditions: 
(1) The individual must have either Secret eligibility (ADDED) (DAF) with moderate tier 
(formerly T3) investigation, a security clearance to have been completed ((ADDED) (DAF) 
background investigation closed (ADDED) (DAF), CE enrollment date or SF-86 signature date, 
whichever activity is the most recent) within the last 5 years and favorably adjudicated, or Top 
Secret eligibility, a security clearance to have been completed ((ADDED) (DAF) background 
investigation closed (ADDED) (DAF), CE enrollment date or SF-86 signature date, whichever 
activity is the most recent) within the last 10 years (ADDED) (DAF) last 5 years for DAF 
personnel and favorably adjudicated, without a break in active service or employment longer than 24 
months.  (ADDED) (DAF)  Additionally, individual must have an SF-86 accepted by DCSA for 
high tier (formerly T5) or equivalent successor investigation. 
 
(2) The appropriate background investigation request must be submitted and shown as 
opened in the JPAS (ADDED) (DAF) DISS or successor system before interim certification and all 
other requirements of the PRP screening process will be fulfilled. 
 
(3) (ADDED) (DAF)  The CO and the servicing IPO have reviewed the submitted 
security questionnaire and determined that the risk is at an acceptable level to grant interim 
access prior to completion of investigation.  Upon confirmation from the CO, the servicing IPO 
may grant interim access at the level equivalent to that which is required by the PRP position.  
Any interim access granted under this provision must be immediately removed if the clearance 
eligibility is unfavorably adjudicated.  (T-0) 
 
b. Controlled Position. (ADDED)(DAF) There will be no interim certifications for 
controlled positions. (T-0) If it becomes necessary to consider an individual for a controlled 
position and the required investigation has not been completed, interim controlled certification may 
be made under the following conditions:

completed (investigation closed within the last 10 years favorably adjudicated, without a 
break in active service over 24 months. 
 
(2) The appropriate background investigation must be submitted before interim 
certification and all other requirements for the PRP screening process will be fulfilled. 
 
c. Individuals with Interim Certification 
 
(1) These individuals will be identified to supervisory personnel, entry controllers 
who directly control access to exclusion areas, and others as necessary, as having only 
interim certification. Entry authorization lists and individual access media will be specifically 
marked to designate interim certification status. 
 
(2) An individual with interim certification will not be paired in a two-person team 
with another individual with interim PRP certification. 
 
(3) (ADDED) (DAF)  Interim certification documentation.  Document an 
interim certification using the same procedures as a certification.  (T-1)  
 
(a) (ADDED) (DAF)  If the individual does not have a valid security 
clearance and is not eligible for interim certification, or the CO determines not to 
interim certify, update MilPDS or DCPDS with PRP status C code until the security 
clearance determination is made and updated by the DCSA CAS.  (T-1) 
 
4. (ADDED) (DAF)  FULFILLING INVESTIGATIVE REQUIREMENTS. 
 
a. (ADDED) (DAF)  SF-86 and authorization release forms are required every five 
years for critical positions and controlled positions.  (T-0)  Reference Appendix 2 to 
Enclosure 3 paragraph 1.b.   
 
5. (ADDED) (DAF)  ADMINISTRATIVE QUALIFICATION (AQ).  Administrative 
qualification is a PRP screening process which ensures Regular Air and Space Force active 
duty military personnel meet PRP standards before they depart for training or assignment to 
PRP duties.  This process will be accomplished using the same criteria and standards as a 
formal certification and with equivalent record access for the RO, CO, commander, director, 
and the AQC.  (T-1)  The AQC or losing commander/director (if applicable) accomplishes AQs 
(Reference aa).   Unit commander or directors need not be PRP certified to perform AQs.  
This process is optional for ARC personnel. 
 
a. (ADDED) (DAF)  The AQC or losing commander/director (if applicable), in 
coordination with the gaining CO, will review suitability factors for PRP and complete AQ 
decision within 60 calendar days of assignment notification.  (T-1) 
 
(1) (ADDED) (DAF)  The gaining CO decision is not required on packages that 
do not contain suitability factors for PRP.  Additionally, the AQC may independently 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 2 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
39 
 
 
make DQ decisions for E-1 through E-6 and O-1 through O-3 personnel without consultation 
from the gaining CO.  
 
b. (ADDED) (DAF)  The AQC does not accomplish AQs for sources of commissioning 
(ROTC, OTS and USAFA).  This will be accomplished by the losing CO, commander or 
director.  (T-1) 
 
c. (ADDED) (DAF)  PSI requirement.  Individual must have a current security clearance 
as outlined in above paragraph 1.b.  Individuals are required to meet the CV five-year 
periodicity prior to departure date.  If the individual does not possess a valid security 
clearance for projected position or is not current, the SF-86 must be submitted within five 
years of the last SF-86 signature date.  If upgrading, individual must also have a DCSA 
accepted SF-86 for a High Tier (formerly T5) in DISS or successor system.  (T-0) 
 
d. (ADDED) (DAF)  Continuous monitoring.  Once administrative qualification is 
complete (PRP status B code), continuous monitoring is required and is the responsibility of 
the losing installation until the individual begins in-processing at the gaining installation. The 
AQC or sources of commissioning will ensure the losing and gaining installations receive the 
DAF Form 286 identifying the individual meets PRP standards and is administratively 
qualified.  
 
(1) (ADDED) (DAF)  The losing installation PRAP monitor will notify the losing CO, 
commander or director, the unit PRP monitor (if applicable), the individual’s supervisor (or 
military training leader (MTL) for the Training Squadrons (TRS)) and first sergeant of the 
administrative qualification for pending PRP assignment and requirement to maintain 
continuous monitoring.  (T-1) 
 
(2) (ADDED) (DAF)  The losing CO, commander or director, in collaboration with the 
installation PRAP or the unit PRP monitor, will continue to inform the gaining CO of any 
suitability factors or situations that may affect the individual’s PRP assignment eligibility or 
reliability. (T-1)

APPENDIX 3 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
 
PRP POSITIONS 
 
 
1. GENERAL. The reliability standards established in Appendix 2 to this enclosure will be used to 
determine an individual’s eligibility for a PRP position. All PRP positions will be formally 
designated as either critical or controlled and will be restricted to the minimum number required to 
accomplish the mission. Only certified personnel will be assigned to designated PRP positions and 
when PRP positions become vacant, certified personnel will be assigned as rapidly as possible. 
Examples of typical PRP positions are shown in the Table.  (ADDED) (DAF)  PRP individuals 
that have an approved retirement or separation date may occupy a PRP coded position until 
date of separation or retirement effective date, however these personnel must be PRP status J 
code effective the last date performed PRP duties.   
 
 
2. REVIEW OF PRP POSITIONS. Certifying officials will re-evaluate designated PRP positions 
annually to determine the need for additional positions or the cancellation of unnecessary positions. 
 
a. (ADDED) (DAF)  The source is the Unit Manpower Document (UMD).  Ensure all 
changes are updated in the Manpower Programming and Execution System.  The CO will 
document (signature and date) annual UMD reevaluation. (T-1) 
 
b. (ADDED) (DAF)  MANPOWER POSITION CODING.  The following manpower 
designators will be used when reviewing/identifying nuclear coded manpower billets: 
  
A – CRITICAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP  
  
D – CONTROL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP   
  
I – CONTROL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP (NUCLEAR EXPERIENCE REQ)  
  
N – CRITICAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP (NUCLEAR EXPERIENCE REQ) 
  
Z – NUCLEAR EXPERIENCE (NON-PRP)  
  
c. (ADDED) (DAF)  ADDITIONAL DUTY.  In some cases, the CO may be required to 
certify personnel for PRP additional duty.  The CO certifies those selected for PRP 
additional duty according to this manual but do not document these requirements on the 
UMD.  (T-1) 
 
d. (ADDED) (DAF)  CIVILIAN POSITIONS.  Government civilian positions which 
require PRP certification will be identified on the UMD as a PRP position, and the position 
description will include PRP duties.  (T-1) 
 
e. (ADDED) (DAF)  CONTRACTOR PRP POSITIONS.  Because of the diversity of 
position titles and duties in the DAF, the reliability standards established in this manual 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 3 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
41 
 
 
will be used to determine which positions will be identified for PRP.  The COs formally 
designate PRP positions as either “critical” or “controlled” and keep positions to the 
minimum required to accomplish the mission.  This requirement will be met during contract 
establishment and must be reflected in the contract requirements documentation (e.g., PWS, 
SOW, DD Form 254, etc.).  (T-1) 
 
f. (ADDED) (DAF)  Coordinate all PRP position(s) under consideration for workforce 
changes with AF/A10P.  Additionally, employees will perform nuclear duties only in nuclear 
certified facilities or in cleared contractor facilities authorized to safeguard classified 
information by DCSA and validated by the National Industrial Security System (NISS) using 
(Reference (ss)) and authorized by HQ Air Force Safety Center for nuclear performance.  
Contractor positions will be evaluated during contract establishment and reevaluated 
according to the contract.  (T-1) 
 
g. (ADDED) (DAF)  CONVERTING POSITIONS.  Prior to converting PRP coded 
military or DoD civilian positions to contractor positions, the functions to be converted must 
be deemed required and essential by AF/A10.  This determination must be made, and approval 
granted, in writing, prior to nominating the function for contract performance.  (T-1) 
 
 
3. PRP POSITION ELIGIBILITY. Eligibility for assignment to PRP positions, subject to the 
reliability standards in Appendix 2 of this enclosure, will be confirmed in writing by a certifying 
official. Before an individual is assigned to PRP duties, the certifying official will certify that the 
individual has the required PSI and clearance, been screened according to the reliability standards, 
been personally interviewed, and been found eligible and qualified for assignment to a PRP position.

APPENDIX 4 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
 
PRP SUITABILITY FACTORS 
 
 
1. GENERAL. The following guidelines are established to assist certifying officials in 
determining the suitability of all personnel subject to PRP. The ultimate determination of whether to 
grant or continue an individual’s enrollment in PRP is based on an overall common sense judgment 
by the certifying official. Each case must be judged on its own merits, and above all, be consistent 
with the interests of U.S. national security. Sexual orientation or preference may not be used as a 
basis for or a disqualifying factor in determining a person’s eligibility for PRP. In evaluating the 
relevance of an individual’s conduct, certifying officials are encouraged to carefully weigh a number 
of variables in consideration of the whole person concept of determining suitability. These variables 
include: 
 
a. Personal Conduct. Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the person may not be suitable for enrollment in PRP. 
 
(1) Conditions that the certifying official should carefully consider include: 
 
(a) Reliable, unfavorable information. 
\ 
(b) Deliberate provision of false or misleading information. 
 
(c) Personal conduct or concealment of information that may increase an individual’s 
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duties, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may 
affect the person’s personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to 
blackmail. 
 
(d) A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. 
 
(e) Known or witting association with persons involved in criminal activity. 
 
(f) Loss of confidence by the certifying official in the reliability in the individual. 
 
(g) Conditions the certifying official might consider to mitigate reliability concerns: 
 
(h) The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of 
judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. 
 
(i) 
The individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the falsification before 
being confronted with the facts. 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 4 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
48 
 
 
(j) 
Omission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by 
improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted 
information was promptly and fully provided. 
 
(k) The individual has taken positive steps to eliminate vulnerability to 
coercion, exploitation, or duress. 
 
(l) 
The individual has ceased known or witting association with persons 
involved in criminal activities. 
 
(m) The behavior occurred during or before adolescence and there is no 
evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature. 
 
b. Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders. Emotional, mental, and personality 
disorders can cause a significant deficit in an individual’s psychological, social, and occupational 
functioning. These disorders present suitability concerns for individuals subject to PRP because 
they may indicate a defect in reliability. The certifying official will take the necessary actions to 
ensure that the individual is properly screened both medically and psychologically. As with all 
potentially disqualifying medical conditions, the certifying official must decide each case on the 
specific medical and other pertinent evaluations of the individual involved. Any suspected 
suicidal behavior will result in the individual’s suspension from PRP duties pending the results 
of a mental health assessment. 
 
(a) psychological diagnosis and treatment that may potentially impact reliability. 
(b) Poor attitude or lack of motivation. 
 
(2) Conditions the certifying official might consider to mitigate reliability concerns include: 
 
(a) There is no indication of a current problem. 
 
(b) A credentialed mental health professional is of the (recent) opinion that an 
individual’s previous emotional, mental, or personality disorder is cured, under control, or in 
remission and has a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation. 
 
(c) The past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g., one caused by a 
death, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has been resolved, and the individual is no 
longer emotionally unstable. 
 
c. Financial Considerations. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having 
to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from 
financially profitable criminal acts. 
 
(1) Conditions that the certifying official should carefully consider include: 
 
(a) A history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 4 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
49 
 
 
(b) Deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check 
fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other 
intentional financial breaches of trust. 
 
(c) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. 
 
(d) Unexplained affluence. 
 
(e) Financial problems that are linked to gambling, drug abuse, alcoholism, or other 
issues of security concern. 
 
(2) Conditions the certifying official might consider to mitigate reliability concerns include: 
 
(a) The behavior was not recent. 
 
(b) It was an isolated incident. 
 
(c) The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person’s control 
(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, 
or separation). 
(d) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. 
(e) The affluence resulted from a legal source. 
 
(f) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts. 
 
d. Criminal Conduct. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person’s 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
 
(1) Conditions that the certifying official should carefully consider include: 
 
(a) Credible allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the 
person was formally charged. 
 
(b) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. 
 
(2) Conditions the certifying official might consider to mitigate reliability concerns include: 
 
(a) The criminal behavior was not recent. 
 
(b) The crime was an isolated incident. 
 
(c) The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are 
no longer present in that person’s life. 
 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 4 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
50 
 
 
(d) The person did not voluntarily commit the act or the factors leading to the 
violation are not likely to recur. 
 
(e) Acquittal. 
 
(f) 
There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation. 
 
e. Substance or Drug Misuse and Drug Incidents. Improper or illegal involvement with 
drugs raises questions regarding an individual’s suitability for PRP. Substance use disorder may 
impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an individual’s inability to 
ensure the safety, security, control, and effectiveness of nuclear weapons. Pre-Service use of 
marijuana, hashish, or other cannabis-based product does not necessarily render an individual 
ineligible for consideration for or retention in a PRP position. It is incumbent on the certifying 
official, with CMA consultation, to determine the degree that pre-service use impacts the 
individual’s reliability.  (ADDED) (DAF)  For the purposes of this manual, alcohol related 
disorders are defined separately from other substance use disorders.  (See paragraph 1.f. 
below). 
 
(1) Conditions that the certifying official should carefully consider include: 
(a) Any substance or drug misuse (see Glossary). 
 
(b) Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical 
psychologist, or psychiatrist) of substance use disorder. 
 
(c) Evaluation of substance use disorder by a licensed clinical social worker 
or licensed professional counselor who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment 
program. 
 
(d) Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by 
a credentialed medical professional. 
 
(2) Conditions the certifying official might consider to mitigate reliability concerns 
include: 
 
(a) The substance or drug misuse was not recent. 
 
(b) The substance or drug misuse was an isolated incident or aberrant event. 
 
(c) The individual has displayed a demonstrated intent not to misuse any 
substances or drugs in the future. 
 
(d) The individual has satisfactorily completed a prescribed drug treatment 
program, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of 
abuse, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional. 
 
f. Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol-related Incidents. Excessive alcohol consumption 
often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 4 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
51 
 
 
and increases the risk of an individual inability to meet their PRP responsibilities to ensure the 
safety, security, control, and effectiveness of nuclear weapons. Individuals diagnosed with mild, 
moderate, or severe alcohol use disorder, or who have been involved in an alcohol related incident 
will be, at a minimum, suspended from PRP duties. The certifying official, after consultation with 
the CMA or conducting an investigation of the circumstances of an incident, will determine the 
degree to which the diagnosis affects the reliability of the individual being considered for or who is 
currently under PRP assignment. Those individuals may be returned to PRP duties after successfully 
completing a prescribed rehabilitation program or treatment regimen, when they have displayed 
positive changes in job reliability and lifestyle, and receive a favorable medical prognosis by the 
CMA. 
 
(1) Conditions that the certifying official should carefully consider include: 
 
(a) Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the 
influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use. 
 
(b) Alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an 
intoxicated or impaired condition or drinking on the job. 
(c) Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical 
psychologist, or psychiatrist) of moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. 
 
(d) Evaluation of moderate or severe alcohol use disorder by a licensed clinical social 
worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
 
(e) Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. 
 
(f) Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of moderate or severe alcohol use 
disorder by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an alcohol 
rehabilitation program. 
 
(2) Conditions the certifying official might consider to mitigate reliability concerns include: 
 
(a) The alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern. 
 
(b) There is no indication of a recent problem. 
 
(c) The individual has made positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety. 
 
(d) Following diagnosis of moderate or severe alcohol use disorder, the individual 
successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare requirements, 
participates frequently in meetings of appropriate recovery support organizations, has abstained from 
alcohol for at least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical 
professional or a licensed clinical social worker or licensed professional counselor who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
 
g. Sexual Harassment and Assault. Sexual harassment imposes significant costs, such as 
impairing unit readiness and disrupting unit cohesion. 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 4 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
52 
 
 
 
(1) Conditions that the certifying official should carefully consider include:

requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, either 
explicitly or implicitly. 
 
(b) Such advances are made as a term or condition of a person’s job, pay, or 
career. 
 
(c) An individual’s conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably 
interfering with another’s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or 
offensive working environment. 
 
(d) The individual’s conduct can be considered sexual assault as defined in 
the Glossary. 
(2) Conditions the certifying official might consider to mitigate reliability concerns 
include: 
 
(a) The behavior occurred during or before adolescence and there is no 
evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature. 
 
(b) The behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent 
conduct of a similar nature. 
 
(c) There is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
emotional instability. 
 
(d) The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, 
or duress. 
 
h. Security Violations. Noncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an 
individual’s trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information. 
 
(1) Conditions that the certifying official should carefully consider include: 
 
(a) Unauthorized disclosure of classified information. 
 
(b) Violations that are deliberate or multiple or due to negligence. 
 
(2) Conditions the certifying official might consider to mitigate reliability concerns 
include: 
 
(a) The violations were inadvertent. 
 
(b) The violations were isolated or infrequent. 
 
Change 4, 05/09/2022 
APPENDIX 4 TO ENCLOSURE 3 
53 
 
 
(c) The violations were due to improper or inadequate training. 
 
(d) The individual demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of PRP 
responsibilities. 
 
i. Misuse of Information Technology Systems. Noncompliance with rules, procedures, 
guidelines, or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns 
about an individual’s trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to properly protect classified systems, 
networks, and information. 
 
(1) Conditions that the certifying official should carefully consider include: 
 
(a) Illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system. 
 
(b) Illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction, manipulation, or denial of access 
to information residing on an information technology system. 
(c) Removal (or use) of hardware, software, or media from any information technology 
system without authorization, when specifically prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or 
regulations. 
 
(d) Introduction of hardware, software, or media into any information technology 
system without authorization, when specifically prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or 
regulations. 
 
(2) Conditions the certifying official might consider to mitigate reliability concerns include: 
 
(a) The conduct was unintentional or inadvertent. 
 
(b) The introduction or removal of media was authorized. 
 
(c) The misuse was followed by a prompt, good faith effort to correct the situation. 
 
 
2. MANDATORY DECERTIFICATION OR (ADDED) (DAF) PERMANENT 
DISQUALIFICATION. Any of the following conditions will result in decertification or 
disqualification of individuals being considered for a PRP position: 
 
a. An individual diagnosed with alcohol use disorder who subsequently fails or fails to 
participate in the prescribed rehabilitation program or treatment regimen. 
 
b. An individual found to be involved in the unauthorized trafficking, cultivation, processing, 
manufacturing, or sale of any controlled or illegal drug, including cannabis-based products. 
 
c. An individual found to have ever used a drug that could cause flashbacks. 
 
d. An individual diagnosed with severe substance use disorder.  (ADDED) (DAF)  For the 
purposes of this instruction, alcohol related disorders are defined separately from other 
Change 4, 05/09/2022

active service. For assignment to PRP: active duty in the U.S. military; employment in the federal 
civil service; employment by a U.S. Government contractor involving access to classified 
information under the National Industrial Security Program; continuous federal service by National 
Guard members; service as a cadet or midshipmen in the Military, Naval, Air Force, or Coast Guard 
academies; members of the Selected Reserve, as defined in DoD Instruction 1215.06 (Reference 
(v)). For PRP purposes, the following apply: An interruption in active service of over 24 months 
constitutes a break in active service. Assignment as a Reserve Officers Training Corps, Merchant 
Marine Academy, and Maritime Academy cadet or midshipman is not considered active service.

alcohol by the individual is a contributing factor.  (ADDED) (DAF)  The CO or commander, with 
CMA consultation, will decide if an incident is an alcohol-related incident or not. 
 
alcohol use disorder. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant 
impairment or distress, as defined by symptoms in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (Reference (w)). Alcohol use disorder levels of severity (i.e., mild, moderate, or severe) 
are determined through the evaluation of symptoms described in Reference (w). 
 
armed. Defined in DoD Directive 5210.56 (Reference (x)). 
 
background investigation. A PSI consisting of both record reviews and interviews with sources of 
information in accordance with Reference (o).
