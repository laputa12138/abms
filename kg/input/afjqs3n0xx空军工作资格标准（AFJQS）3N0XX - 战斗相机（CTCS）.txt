PART I. 
 
SECTION A – GENERAL INFORMATION 
 
1.  This AFJQS standardizes on-the-job training (OJT) tasks and constitutes an approved training 
program for the Air Force Public Affairs Agency (AFPAA) Combat Camera Squadrons (CTCS).  
Unit training managers, supervisors, trainers, and trainees will use this AFJQS and other training 
functions to plan, conduct, and document on the job training (OJT).  This AFJQS identifies the 
minimum training required to become a qualified CTCS member in accordance with AFI 35-111, 
Public Affairs Contingency Operations and Wartime Readiness.  This AFJQS will be available in 
Training Business Area (TBA) and must be used to develop the Master Training Plan (MTP) and 
the Individual Training Plans (ITP) for CTCS. Specific applicability of this AFJQS to Air National 
Guard and Air Force Reserve Command personnel is addressed in AFI 20-112, Logistics 
Readiness Squadron Quality Assurance Program.  This AFJQS will remain in effect until 
superseded or rescinded.  
 
1.1.  Maintain this AFJQS according to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  Urgent 
changes are disseminated via message. Submit recommended AFJQS improvements or 
corrections to S e c r e t a r y  o f  t h e  Air Force Public Affairs Command Information 
Division (SAF/PAI). 
 
1.2.  Review AF e-Publishing, the official source site for Air Force administrative publications 
and forms (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/) to identify available training materials. Use this 
AFJQS in conjunction with the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) and locally 
assigned tasks to identify work center duty position training.  Also, use this AFJQS along 
with the CFETP to evaluate newly assigned personnel and identify individual training 
requirements. 
 
1.3.  Tasks listed on the AFJQS were selected according to the Instructional System 
Development (ISD) process and are the minimum, mandatory CTCS training requirements.  
Tasks may not be common to all equipment or functions; however, the task must be trained if 
it is assigned to the individual’s duty position.  Trainees must demonstrate the ability to perform 
assigned tasks according to the established proficiency codes before completing training. 
 
SECTION B – TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 
 
2.  Implementation.  This document will be used as a guideline for task qualification training in 
concert with governing Air Force Instructions.  Personnel assigned to Combat Camera must 
meet, at a minimum, all prescribed training requirements within the AFJQS to be considered 
fully qualified. Sections of the AFJQS containing training requirements are identified below. 
 
2.1. Combat Camera (COMCAM) familiarization 
 
2.2. Advanced Technical Skills 
 
2.3. Combat Skills and Tactics 
4 
 
 
2.4. Aircrew Qualification.  Required only for those assigned to a flying position. 
 
Note: This AFJQS identifies training requirements only. Refer to the Air Force Enlisted 
Classification Directory (AFECD) and the Special Duty Catalog (SPECAT) to view duties, 
responsibilities, and eligibility related information. 
 
SECTION C – TRAINING STANDARDS 
 
3.  Task Qualification.  Task qualification training must be conducted by a qualified person to a 
standard that meets or exceeds local demands for proficiency, accuracy, and timeliness.  
 
Note: A qualified person is defined as someone who has successfully demonstrated the ability 
to perform the task, is signed off in TBA and has completed the Air Force Training Course. 
 
3.1. Performance task training is considered complete when the Trainee can successfully 
identify why and when a task must be done and why each step is needed. 
 
3.2. Knowledge task training is considered complete when the Trainee can successfully 
identify why and when a task must be done and why each step is needed. 
 
SECTION D – TRAINING DOCUMENTATION 
 
4. Training Business Area (TBA).  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training 
Program, the Public Affairs Career Field Manager has made it mandatory for all members 
regardless of duty assignment to use the automated training management system, Training 
Business Area (TBA), to document technical qualification. 
 
5. Identification. In the automated training record User Profile section, the Unit Training 
Manager (UTM) will assist individuals in creating or re-assigning their training record and 
assign them to the correct work center upon in-processing into the unit. 
 
SECTION E: SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
 
1. This AFJQS was revised due to mission and system changes. Tasks and training references 
were updated and added. Template changes were also made for the AFJQS. 
 
2. This AFJQS has been coordinated with applicable CFMs. Overall POC for this AFJQS is 
SAF/PAI.

Can do the complete task quickly and accurately. Can tell or show others how to do the task.  
(highly proficient) 
*Task 
Knowledge 
Levels 
a 
Can name parts, tools, and simple facts about the task.  (nomenclature) 
b 
Can determine step by step procedures for doing the task.  (procedures) 
c 
Can identify why and when the task must be done and why each step is needed.  (operating 
principles) 
d 
Can predict, isolate, and resolve problems about the task.  (advanced theory) 
**Subject 
Knowledge

Explanations: 
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of 
knowledge for a specific task.  (Example: b and 1b)  
 
**A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to 
any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks

NOTE 1:  Aircrew program proficiency sorties provide Combat Camera training in a flying environment for Combat Camera crewmembers. It includes a 
comprehensive review of the various phases of flight associated with the flying mission. This training is to improve mission ready skills required to accomplish 
photographic/video documentation of the mission profile. To receive credit and maintain currency for a COMCAM proficiency sortie, the crewmember must attend 
preflight briefing, review aircraft emergency procedures, review aircraft, review in-flight duties, and attend mission debrief.
