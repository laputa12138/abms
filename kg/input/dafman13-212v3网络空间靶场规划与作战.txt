INTRODUCTION 
1.1.  Overview.  This manual provides guidance for commanders to operate assigned cyberspace 
ranges effectively, efficiently, and in accordance with the risk management framework (RMF) to 
meet training and test requirements.  Additionally, this manual assigns the responsibilities and 
authorities to accomplish activities outlined in the manual, including the development of an 
Enterprise Range Plan Cyber Annex. 
1.2.  Scope. 
1.2.1.  This manual applies to all Department of the Air Force-operated cyberspace ranges.  A 
cyberspace range is an event environment that supports cyber effects on information 
technology; weapons; control systems; command, control, communications, computers, 
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and other network-enabled technologies for the 
purpose of experimentation, testing, training, or exercising on a real or simulated network. 
1.2.2.  Cyberspace ranges encompass the hardware, software, and connectivity; test facilities; 
and test beds and tailored scenarios and capabilities to conduct research, development, test and 
evaluation.  Additionally, they provide other means and resources for testing, training and 
exercises, demonstration and developing software; personnel; organization and all information 
system networks or enclaves that represent the cyberspace environment. 
1.2.3.  While most of the range equipment consists of standard Internet Protocol systems such 
as servers, routers, and switches, it also includes specialized systems such as radio frequency 
systems, cellular technologies including but not limited to wireless communications 
technologies, simulators, control systems, avionics, and detailed threat systems. 
1.2.4.  The cyberspace ranges are part of the Department of the Air Force’s Operational 
Training and Test Infrastructure (OTTI).  Attachment 3 is intended to be the definitive list of 
Department of the Air Force primary cyberspace ranges; however, this manual covers all 
cyberspace ranges.  Department of the Air Force organizations conducting Cyberspace Range 
activities, as defined in Department of Defense (DoD), DoD Executive Agents for the cyber 
Test and Cyber Training Ranges,  Directive 5101.19E aligned to cyberspace ranges at locations 
other than those listed in Attachment 3 must contact the parent major command (MAJCOM 
or Field Command) for review. (T-1) 
1.2.5.  If the range review determines the activity is within the scope and intent of this 
DAFMAN, a request for change should be submitted to Air Combat Command (ACC) and 
Headquarters Air Force OTTI Division (AF/A3TI) to update Attachment 3. 
1.3.  Waiver request.

appropriate. 
1.3.3.  AF/A3TI will coordinate all waiver requests with ACC, Airspace, Ranges and Airfield 
Operations Division (ACC/A3A) so they can maintain appropriate situational awareness as the 
lead Command. 
1.4.  Supplements.  This publication may be supplemented at any level.  Route all supplements 
for coordination prior to certification and approval. (T-1)  Supplements may change or add 
procedures, as applicable, to this manual, but changes can be no less restrictive than this manual.  
All supplements may use the most suitable format (i.e., integrated or standalone) and must be 
published in accordance with DAFI 33-360 on the Department of the Air Force electronics 
publications website.  For MAJCOM and Field Command supplements, MAJCOMs and Field

Chapter 3 
CYBERSPACE RANGE PLANNING 
3.1.  Comprehensive Cyberspace Range Planning. 
3.1.1.  The DAF accomplishes comprehensive cyberspace range planning to ensure exercises, 
training, mission rehearsals, and testing requirements are met.  This process evaluates 
cyberspace range requirements against current and projected capabilities to identify shortfalls.  
It also guides sustainable cyberspace range development to mitigate shortfalls.  This manual, 
along with a hierarchy of plans, provide the guidance that documents the current sustainment 
and future cyberspace range development. 
3.1.2.  The Operational Training Infrastructure Flight Plan.  AF/A3TI drafts and publishes 
the Operational Training Infrastructure Flight Plan for the DAF.  Since cyberspace ranges are 
part of the Air Force’s OTTI, the OTTI Flight Plan provides the long-term strategic vision and 
direction for Air Force cyberspace ranges.  The plan establishes a vision of a realistic, 
integrated training environment that allows forces to train in mission relevant employment 
schemes to achieve and sustain full-spectrum readiness.  It also describes the long-term OTTI 
requirements to achieve the vision set forth in the 2015 Strategic Master Plan and Air Force 
Future Operating Concept. 
3.1.2.1.  Enterprise Range Plan Cyber Annex.  ACC, as the lead MAJCOM, will produce 
an Enterprise Range Plan Cyber Annex and coordinate it with AF/A3TI and AF/TE prior 
to publication. (T-1)  The plan should have a 10-year planning horizon and support 
achievement of the vision established in the Operational Training Infrastructure Flight 
Plan. 
3.1.2.2.  ACC will ensure the Enterprise Range Plan Cyber Annex identifies the current 
mission of each cyberspace range and the range requirements. (T-1)  This includes 
detailing necessary test and training capabilities as well as specifying training requirements 
for assigned users.  It should compare current and known future requirements against the 
current cyberspace range capabilities to identify shortfalls and describe investment actions. 
3.1.2.3.  Enterprise Range Plan Cyber Annex development provides an opportunity for all 
Combatant Commands, MAJCOM organizations and staff to provide input, coordinate 
actions within the command and across MAJCOMs.  ACC will coordinate the plan with all 
MAJCOMs and Field Commands to ensure their needs and concerns are addressed. (T-1) 
3.1.3.  Department of the Air Force Cyber Training Requirements.  Cyberspace range training 
support requirements are based on the USCYBERCOM Training and Readiness Manual, 
Combatant Command requirements, and Cyber Weapon System training events of the assigned 
units.  As Cyber Weapon Systems, mission types, training events, and/or tactics, techniques, 
and procedures change to meet emerging threats and technologies, the MAJCOM Realistic 
Training Review Boards are instituted to maximize the quality of unit training and convene 
(usually annually) to update training events, frequency and standards.  MAJCOM Realistic 
Training Review Boards will also publish requirements to AF/A3TI and AF/TE for review and 
funding advocacy and will comply with AFI 16-1007, Management of Air Force Operational 
Training Systems. (T-1) 
DAFMAN13-212V3  11 FEBRUARY 2022 
15 
3.1.3.1.  At a minimum, MAJCOMs and Field Commands shall bi-annually review 
applicable portions of the Combat Air Forces Realistic Training Review Board, 
Cyberspace Range Steering Group, Offensive/Defensive Cyber Operations Steering 
Group, joint range user assignments, the range-supported Major Weapon System events, 
AFI 16-1007, and other applicable training requirements documents. (T-1)  Following the 
review, the MAJCOMs, and Field Commands through ACC as the lead MAJCOM, will 
provide AF/A3TI and AF/TE with inputs on recommended changes to Attachments 2 and 
3. (T-1)
3.1.3.1.1.  The bi-annual review should ensure specific cyberspace ranges have been
tasked to support each specific training event and that the ranges have the required 
capability to do so. MAJCOMs and Field Commands must support shortfalls 
necessitating a change to assigned users, or capability and infrastructure investments 
based on the published data. 
3.1.3.1.2.  User-event assignments should consider connectivity requirements, 
scheduling, cyberspace range capabilities, joint interoperability requirements, crew 
training facilities, external cyberspace range support requirements, as well as the scope 
and attributes required for the assigned event.  Units can be assigned to more than one 
range for the same training event. 
3.1.3.1.3.  When a MAJCOM or Field Command does not have an adequate cyberspace 
range to support one of its units, the lead MAJCOM will engage other cyberspace 
range-owning MAJCOMs, Field Commands, service(s) and DoD organizations for 
support and assignment of their units. (T-1)  If the shortfall cannot be serviced, the 
Cyberspace Range Squadron will submit a Test/Training Space Needs Statement 
(T/TSNS) to the Central Authority for resolution. (T-1) 
3.1.3.1.4.  During the bi-annual review, MAJCOMs and Field Commands should 
review test and training requirements to determine the adequate mixture of threat 
representative cyber environments and multi-domain integrative capability to include: 
M&S; LVC; space training range integration; and, if necessary, changes to cyberspace 
range requirements.  This drives a continuous modernization process that meets test 
objectives, increases combat realism, aids tactics development, enhances day-to-day 
training, and moves toward a balanced and appropriate live, cyber and synthetic mix. 
3.1.3.2.  Priority at primary cyberspace ranges.  The Lead MAJCOM and the Cyberspace 
Range Operating Authority determines priority.  The cyberspace range-operating Wing and 
individual ranges should schedule adequately to support each assigned user in the assigned 
event. The central authority for the ANG Cyber Range Squadron is NGB/A2/3/6/10CR, 
ANG Cyber Training, Range, and Exercises Branch. 
3.1.3.3.  Training Priority at Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) funded 
cyberspace ranges in accordance with DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base 
(MRTFB), scheduling of the MRTFB is based upon a priority system that considers all 
DoD Components and accommodates DoD acquisition program priorities.  The Test 
Resource Management Center implements the composition, sizing and usage for the 
MRTFB. 
16 
DAFMAN13-212V3  11 FEBRUARY 2022 
3.1.3.4.  Cyberspace Range Test-Support Requirements.  Test requirements are based on 
the characteristics and attributes of the specific test and are governed by departmental and 
service-level directives and instructions.  MAJCOMs, Field Commands, Systems Program 
Office, Program Management Office, SAF/AQ, SAF/CN and AF/TE collaboratively define 
the test requirements and the resources necessary to support them. 
3.1.4.  Training and Test Resource Programs.  Training and test requirements are funded 
through a combination of institutional funds and reimbursements and/or customer fees.  
Training and test resource funding is managed through Air Force and other DoD unique PEs.  
Execution is accomplished by various Air Force training and test activities.  AF/TE provides 
T&E resource oversight and guidance to the AF MRTFB-funded range capabilities through 
the parent MAJCOM or Field Command.  AF/A3T provides training resource oversight and 
guidance for all cyberspace ranges. 
3.1.4.1.  Aligning and Deconflicting Training and Test Requirements.  Within the 
Department of the Air Force, the investments needed for training requirements may also 
be required for testing, and vice versa.  MRTFB infrastructure investments are planned and 
allocated through different processes, PEs and special access programs.  It is imperative to 
avoid redundancy and gain synergy by closely aligning and deconflicting test and training 
requirements; however, consideration must be made to adequately prioritize and adhere to 
the existing cyberspace range providers’ business models for MRTFB funded cyberspace 
range assets. 
3.1.4.1.1.  Training O&M.  ACC programs the funding of the Cyberspace Training PE 
(84762F) and the Support to Information Operations Capabilities PE (33166F).  ACC 
will transition appropriate cyberspace range training funding and allocate the 
appropriate cyberspace range program codes in conjunction with the Operational 
Training Infrastructure Funding Strategy. (T-1)  NGB A2/3/6/10 programs the funding 
of the ANG Cyber Range capability PE (53056F / 53151F). 
3.1.4.1.2.  Program Element 84762F funds the O&M and procurement budgets for the 
318th Range Squadron’s (RANS) Cyber Test and Training Range and Distributed 
Mission Operations Center (DMOC) Cyber (DMOC-C) and the 39th Information 
Operations Squadron’s Initial Qualification Training (IQT) Training Range.  These 
budgets support cyberspace range contracts, certain cyberspace range personnel, and 
O&M of cyberspace range capabilities.  It also funds technical and service contracts to 
maintain operating hours and the basic infrastructure for environment development and 
design, technical management, data collection and analysis activities, threat and debrief 
systems, connectivity, data link capabilities and other cyberspace range services as 
determined by the cyberspace range governance boards and steering groups.  Individual 
MAJCOMs execute funding in the PEs for their assigned ranges. 
3.1.4.1.3.  Program Element 33166F funds the O&M and procurement budgets for the 
JIOR.  These budgets support cyberspace range contracts, certain cyberspace range 
personnel, and O&M of cyberspace range capabilities.  Specifically, funding supports 
technical and service contracts to maintain 24/7/365 operations of Unclassified through 
Top Secret-Sensitive Compartment Information in a MILS transport network to 
conduct mission rehearsal, training, testing, concept development and experimentation 
in support of Information Operations, Electromagnetic Spectrum Warfare, Offensive 
DAFMAN13-212V3  11 FEBRUARY 2022 
17 
Cyber Operations, Defensive Cyber Operations, Space Operations, and Special 
Operations Forces mission areas in a realistic threat representative environment. 
3.1.4.1.4.  Program Element 53056F and PE 53151 fund the O&M and procurement 
budgets for the ANG Cyber Range Squadron.  The program funds cyberspace range 
contracts, certain cyberspace range personnel, and O&M of cyberspace range 
capabilities.  It also funds technical and service contracts to maintain basic 
infrastructure, threat systems, training content, connectivity and other range services. 
3.1.4.2.  Cyber Training and Test Environments.  Training and test environment attributes 
accommodate missions based on tactics, techniques, and procedures and event 
requirements.  When Cyberspace Range Operating Authorities/MAJCOMs/Field 
Commands project a unit readiness decline due to a deficiency or gap in cyberspace range 
capabilities, MAJCOMs and Field Commands should first attempt to shift the unit 
assignment to a cyberspace range with the required capability, or submit a T/TSNS to lead 
Command to document and address the shortfall. 
3.1.4.3.  Cyberspace Range Equipment, Personnel, and Infrastructure.  Cyberspace range 
equipment and infrastructure provide numerous functions, including T&E, readiness 
training, tactics development and evaluation, command and control, and mission 
rehearsals.  Ideally, these systems provide precise monitoring and reconstruction, and 
facilitate post-mission debriefing of cyberspace range and multi-domain audiences for 
various missions. The requirement for continuous modernization of these systems drives 
investments in this area. 
3.1.4.4.  Crew Training Space.  The Cyberspace Range Operating Authority will provide a 
common use crew training facility for its assigned range. (T-1)  The Operating Authority 
will manage common use crew training facilities at primary cyberspace ranges. (T-2) 
Cyberspace Operation Squadron will provide a crew training space that is connected to the 
Cyber Operations Squadron assigned range. (T-2)  These will not be the exclusive crew 
training facilities. (T-2) 
3.1.4.5.  Test Equipment and Infrastructure.  The Test Investment Planning and 
Programming Process (TIPP) provides the venue for investing in test infrastructure.  Air 
Force Test Center, within AFMC, manages the AF TIPP process to identify test resource 
investments needed to support military systems testing.  Investments that have possible 
multi-service applicability may be referred to the Central T&E Investment Program for 
funding.

4.2.1.6.  Written Agreements for T&E Activities.  AFI 99-103 details the processes 
required for T&E activities.  Ranges may enter into written agreements via formal 
documentation and coordination at the Range Operating Authority level. 
4.2.2.  Foreign User Training Support Agreements.  Allies will submit written requests for 
cyberspace range support through the Cyberspace Range Operating Authority to appropriate 
country offices within SAF/IA to AF/A3TI. (T-1)  AF/A3TI will coordinate with the 
appropriate range squadron to determine the level of support and to integrate the support 
requirement into the cyberspace range mission.  The lead agency will then task the Cyberspace 
Range Operating Authority to develop the agreement resulting in a memorandum of 
understanding or memorandum of agreement between the cyberspace range and appropriate 
foreign authority. 
4.2.2.1.  These agreements may also include specific letters of agreement, Host-Tenant 
Support Agreements, and other support agreements.  Each signatory ensures that these 
agreements meet the needs of the organization without compromising the mission and 
obligating the organization beyond its intent or authority and are consistent with any 
applicable international agreements with the host nation.  Cyberspace Range Operating 
Authorities will coordinate the draft agreement with the lead agency Office of the Staff

Chapter 7 
CYBERSPACE RANGE MULTI-DOMAIN INTEGRATION 
7.1.  Training System Multi-domain Integration. 
7.1.1.  The Air Force Future Operating Concept describes an environment in 2035 in which 
“integrated multi-domain operations will encompass full interoperability among air, space, and 
cyberspace capabilities.”  If the ability to act in one domain becomes limited, Air Force and 
joint forces will outpace the enemy by rapidly shifting to operations in other domains to 
accomplish the required tasks and objectives. 
7.1.2.  ACC and cyberspace ranges will work with the DMOC-C and the Air National Guard 
Cyberspace Range Squadron to develop LVC cyberspace range and simulator capability to 
enable full-spectrum battlespace in Service, Joint, and coalition operations. (T-1) 
7.1.3.  ACC will resource and prioritize multi-domain training system integration efforts with 
live and synthetic training systems such as, but not limited to, the Virtual Test and Training 
Center, Nevada Test and Training Range, Live Mission Operations Capability, Joint Pacific 
Alaska Range Complex and DMOC-Space (Reference Figure A8.1). (T-1) 
7.2.  DMOC-C. 
7.2.1.  Provides LVC environments for mission rehearsal, concept exploration, and capability 
assessments.  The DMOC-C is officially designated to support major exercises with M&S tools 
for realistic training to satisfy operational learning objectives. 
7.2.2.  DMOC-C will quickly adapt to the various changes in policy, guidance, operational 
environmental changes with minimal cost as it incorporates Government off the Shelf products 
with existing contractors.  Additionally, it will make extensive use of JIOR nodes worldwide. 
(T-2) 
7.2.3.  The DMOC-C currently consists of the Operational Level Constructive Environment, 
the Tactical Level AFNet and Exercise Operations Environments, control system capabilities 
with hardware-in-the-loop, Integrated Air Defense simulated and constructive injects and two 
anechoic chambers for radio frequency integration. (Reference Figure A8.2 DMOC-C Multi-
domain Training System Integration.) 
7.3.  ANG Cyber Range Squadron (RANS).  The ANG Cyber RANS will provide the cyber 
component with persistent Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capability and expertise in 
support of realistic, relevant training opportunities for Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) in a 
networked environment.  (T-2) The ANG Cyber RANS will integrate the distributed ANG Virtual 
Integrated Training Environment (VITE) capabilities, cyber ranges and simulators into a regional 
data control center which will provide centralized management capabilities, system 
standardization, and a common architecture. At the same time, the center will maintain 
decentralized operational capability needed to cater to the unique scheduling constraints of the 
Reserve force (48 regularly scheduled drills/rescheduled drills and 15 annual training days).  
24 
DAFMAN13-212V3  11 FEBRUARY 2022 
The ANG Cyber RANS will utilize the Joint Information Operations Range (JIOR), commercial 
internet, and/or DoD Information Network (DoDIN) networks to provide access to directed cyber 
training platforms and environments that meet Combat Mission Ready (CMR) requirements for 
the Reserve Component’s Cyber Warfighter. (Reference Figure A8.3) (T-2)

capabilities are those in which the DoD EA for Cyber Test Ranges has invested or which are 
compliant with the EAs’ established architectures and standards. 
Architecture—The reference structure of operational training components, their relationships, 
and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time. 
Authoritative Data Source—The point at which information is first captured as data.  The most 
current, reliable, highest-quality data that captures the information.  The authoritative data source 
is designated by the owner of the subject information.  A recognized or official data production 
source with a designated mission statement or source/product to publish reliable and accurate data 
for subsequent use by customers. An authoritative data source may be the functional combination 
of multiple, separate data sources. 
Capability—A specific resource, such as hardware, software, instrumentation, infrastructure 
elements, tools, processes, facilities, and workforces that can be integrated with other capabilities 
to constitute an event environment. 
Central Authority—Office within the lead MAJCOM that collects requirements, advocates for 
funding at higher headquarters, and monitors usage and availability of all DAF cyberspace ranges. 
Crew Training—Those activities which ensure all cybercrew members obtain and maintain the 
certification/qualification and proficiency needed to effectively perform their unit’s mission 
Constructive environment—Computer generated entities, weapons, systems used to enhance the 
live or virtual training environment. 
Cyberspace range—An event environment that supports cyber effects on information technology; 
weapons; command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance; and other network-enabled technologies for the purpose of experimentation, 
testing, training, or exercising on a real or simulated network. It includes hardware, software, and 
connectivity; test facilities; test beds; tailored scenarios; other means and resources for testing, 
training, and developing software; personnel; and tools for accommodating the DoD. A range can 
be a single facility or a federation of capabilities that provides a complete, realistic mission 
environment for the system under test or to meet the training objectives. A range is designed to be 
persistent and support various events over its lifetime. Cyberspace ranges can also support the 
development of new cyber technology. “Cyberspace range” is synonymous with the term “cyber 
and information technology range” as used in 10 USC § 392. 
Cyber Testing—The testing of systems and sub-systems that operate in the cyberspace domain, 
and the access pathways to such systems that are part of DoD weapon systems.  Cyber testing 
includes cybersecurity testing (with associated RMF processes) and cyber resiliency testing. 
Cybersecurity—Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic 
communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and 
electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, 
integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation (DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity). 
Cybersecurity Testing—The testing of the systems’ and sub-systems’ ability to protect or defend 
against a cyber attack. Cybersecurity testing focuses on identifying and eliminating or mitigating 
system cyber vulnerabilities.  It is scoped through assessing a system’s cyber boundary and risk to 
mission assurance.  Risk analysis, at a minimum, should consider the threat and threat severity, 
DAFMAN13-212V3  11 FEBRUARY 2022 
29 
the likelihood of attack, and system vulnerabilities.  Cybersecurity is evaluated based on the 
Security Assessment Plan, Program Protection Plan, Information Support Plan, and RMF artifacts. 
Distributed Training (DT)—DT is shared training that includes LVC simulations.  DT allows 
warfighters to train individually or collectively at all levels of war.  This combination of live, 
virtual, and constructive environments provides on-demand, realistic training opportunities for 
warfighters by overcoming many current constraints that limit training effectiveness. 
Event—A planned, controlled, and scheduled set of activities conducted on a cyberspace range to 
meet specific goals, objectives, or requirements. Events include, but are not limited to, 
experimentation; T&E science and technology, research and development, developmental T&E, 
and operational T&E); tactics, techniques, and procedures development; concept of operations 
development; demonstration; exercise; training; or mission rehearsal. 
Event environment—The combination of representative operational environment elements, 
including systems under test, emulations and simulations, and related tools that satisfy the 
requirements of a specific event. 
Infrastructure—The facilities, ranges, and all other physical assets used to support cyber events. 
Interconnection Security Agreement—A detailed security document that defines the protocols, 
timing, and responsibilities of connecting a cyberspace range, a sponsor network, other ranges, or 
commercial entities to identify and mitigate any risks associated with an environment. 
Interoperability—The ability of systems, units, or forces to provide data, information, materiel, 
and services to, and accept the same from, other systems, units, or forces, and to use the data, 
information, materiel, and services exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together. IT 
interoperability includes both the technical exchange of information and the end-to-end operational 
effectiveness of that exchange of information as required for mission accomplishment. 
Interoperability is more than just information exchange. It includes systems, processes, procedures, 
organizations, and missions over the life cycle and must be balanced with cybersecurity (formerly 
Information Assurance). 
Lead Major Command—As defined in AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization, a lead MAJCOM 
consolidates responsibilities for a particular function in a single MAJCOM, supporting the entire 
Department of the Air Force as applicable. 
Modeling and Simulation (M&S)—The use of models, including emulators, prototypes, 
simulators, and stimulators, either statically or over time, to develop data as a basis for making 
managerial or technical decisions. The terms "modeling" and "simulation" are often used 
interchangeably. 
Operational Training Infrastructure (OTI)—The framework and resources essential to 
accomplishing Air Force Operational Training objectives. 
Operator—Refers to the operating command which is the primary command operating a system, 
subsystem, or item of equipment.  Generally applies to those operational commands or 
organizations designated by Headquarters, US Air Force to conduct or participate in operations or 
operational testing, interchangeable with the term "using command" or “user.”  In other forums 
the term “warfighter” or “customer” is often used.  “User” is the preferred term in this manual. 
Oversight—Senior executive-level monitoring and review of programs to ensure compliance with 
policy and attainment of broad program goals.

between cyberspace operational unit test and training requirements with cyberspace range 
resources to accommodate training and/or test activities. 
Resources—A collective term that encompasses the infrastructure, workforce, and funding 
resulting in a capability. 
Simulator—A training device that permits development and practice of the necessary skills for 
accomplishing operational tasks, to a prescribed standard of competency, in a specific prime 
mission system and duty position.  A simulator can be connected to a cyberspace range to provide 
test and training. 
Standards—Authoritative data sources and enterprise technical standards increase efficiency and 
enable improved integration of various systems during operational training events. 
Synthetic environment—The integrated set of data elements that define the environment within 
which a given simulation application operates. The data elements include information about the 
initial and subsequent states of the terrain including cultural features, and atmospheric and 
oceanographic environments throughout an exercise. The data elements include databases of 
externally observable information about instantiable entities, and are adequately correlated for the 
type of exercise to be performed.

1. Overview 
 
1.1. Concept/Purpose.  This T/TSNS addresses 346 TS requirement to provide an integrated, 
year-round, threat representative and realistic cyberspace training environment (cyberspace 
range, facilities, and equipment) for units to enhance their combat capability as outlined in (ex. 
DAFMAN 13-212v3) and the need to amend and establish virtual training environment to 
support Large Force Employment exercises.  (Provide strategic and MAJCOM level policy, 
mission requirements or additional justifications for the amendment.) 
1.1.1. This T/TSNS addresses recommendations made by the Cyberspace Range Steering Group 
(June 2008).  That group, comprised of representatives from the Headquarters Air Force, ACC, 
and the Air National Guard, identified multiple shortfalls with the existing cyberspace range and 
made several recommendations to improve/optimize the environment to meet mission 
requirements.
