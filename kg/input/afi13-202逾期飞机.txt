GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1.  Search and Rescue (SAR). 
1.1.1.  SAR is a lifesaving service provided through the combined efforts of the federal 
agencies signatory to the National SAR Plan, and the agencies responsible for SAR within 
each state.  Operational resources are provided by the US Coast Guard, Department of Defense 
components, Civil Air Patrol, Coast Guard Auxiliary, State, county and local law enforcement, 
other public safety agencies, and private volunteer organizations.  Services include search for 
missing aircraft, survival aid, rescue, and emergency medical help for the occupants after an 
accident site is located. 
1.1.2.  National Search and Rescue Plan.  By federal interagency agreement, the National 
Search and Rescue Plan provides for the effective use of all available facilities in all types of 
SAR missions.  These facilities include aircraft, vessels, pararescue and ground rescue teams, 
and emergency radio fixing. 
1.2.  Waivers.  Units must use Air Force Form 679, Air Force Publication Compliance Item 
Waiver Request/Approval, to process waivers to this instruction.  (T-1)  Note:  Major Command

2.1.  Air Force Rescue Coordination Center.  The Air Force Rescue Coordination Center 
operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida and 
assigned to the 1 AF (Air Forces Northern).  As the United States' (US) search and rescue 
coordinator, the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center serves as the single agency responsible for 
coordinating on-land federal SAR activities in the 48 contiguous United States while also 
providing SAR assistance to Mexico and Canada. 
2.2.  11th Alaska Rescue Coordination Center.    The 11th Alaska Rescue Coordination Center 
operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is located at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.  The 
11th Alaska Rescue Coordination Center directly ties in to the Federal Aviation Administration's 
(FAA) alerting system and the US Mission Control Center.  In addition to the Search and Rescue 
Satellite Aided Tracking information, the 11th Alaska Rescue Coordination Center computer 
system contains resource files that list federal, State and volunteer civilian organizations which 
can conduct or assist in SAR efforts throughout the State and neighboring regions.  Additionally, 
the 11th Alaska Rescue Coordination Center may provide assistance in the prosecution of 
humanitarian SAR in Alaska, other countries, and to SAR agencies in other search and rescue 
regions if it does not conflict with Alaska Rescue Coordination Center’s primary mission. 
2.3.  US Coast Guard.    The US Coast Guard coordinates and conducts maritime SAR missions 
over coastal waters/inland throughout the contiguous United States and Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto 
Rico.  US Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Centers are set up to cover specific geographic areas 
and act as command and coordination centers.  The geographic areas of responsibility are divided 
among nine Coast Guard District commands and two Rescue Sub-Centers. 
2.4.  United States Mission Control Center.  The United States Mission Control Center is 
operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and is located in Suitland, MD.  
The United States Mission Control Center serves as the US operational component of a multi-
agency, multi-national program using Cosmicheskaya Sistema Poiska Avariynyh Sudov/Search 
and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking to detect and accurately position emergency signals from 
airplanes and ships in distress. 
2.5.  Civil Air Patrol.  Civil Air Patrol can provide SAR mission coordinators, search aircraft, 
ground teams, personnel on alert status, and an extensive communications network.  The Civil Air 
Patrol is the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center’s primary air and ground resource in the inland 
area, especially for expanded searches. 
2.6.  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  FAA through the Air Route Traffic Control 
Center and Flight Service Station monitor and flight follow aircraft in the inland area.  In addition, 
FAA facilities initiate expanded communication actions outlined in FAA Order 7110.10, Flight 
Services. 
2.6.1.  Flight Service Station facilities serve as the central point for collecting and 
disseminating information on overdue or missing aircraft that are not on an Instrument Flight 
Rule flight plan.

Alert Notice (ALNOT)—A request originated by the destination base, flight service station or an 
air route traffic control center for an extensive communication search for overdue, unreported, or 
missing aircraft. 
Air Route Traffic Control Center—A facility established to provide Air Traffic Control service 
to aircraft operating on Instrument Flight Rules flight plans within controlled airspace and 
principally during the enroute phase of flight.  When equipment capabilities and controller 
workload permit, certain advisory/assistance services may be provided to Visual Flight Rules flight 
plan aircraft. 
Departure Base—In the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories, the 
departure base (military or civil airfield) is responsible for SAR action until receipt of the 
AFI13-202  30 MAY 2019 
13 
destination base acknowledgment for the flight notification message.  This responsibility is then 
transferred to the destination base. 
Flight Service Station—An air traffic facility which provides pilot briefings, flight plan 
processing, enroute flight advisories, search and rescue services, and assistance to lost aircraft and 
aircraft in emergency situations.  Flight Service Station facilities also relay Air Traffic Control 
clearances, process Notices to Airmen, broadcast aviation weather and aeronautical information, 
and advise Customs and Immigration of transborder flights.  In Alaska, Flight Service Station 
facilities provide Airport Advisory Services. 
Information Request—A request originated by the destination base for information concerning 
an overdue aircraft. 
Overdue Aircraft (Flight Plan)—An aircraft on a flight plan is considered overdue when it has 
failed to arrive at its destination, compulsory reporting point, clearance void time or clearance limit 
30 minutes after its estimated time of arrival and communications or location cannot be 
established. 
Overdue Aircraft (No Flight Plan)—An aircraft not on a flight plan is overdue at the actual time 
a reliable source reports it to be at least 1 hour late at destination.
