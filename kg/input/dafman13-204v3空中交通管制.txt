This Department of the Air Force manual (DAFMAN) implements Air Force Policy Directive 
(AFPD) 13-2, Air Traffic Control, Airfield, Airspace, and Range Management.  It applies to all 
civilian employees and uniformed members of the United States Space Force, Regular Air Force, 
Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard organizations (to include contracted locations) who 
operate or administer functions and facilities for Air Traffic Control (ATC).  At joint, shared use, 
and host nation airfields, this manual applies to the facilities controlled and used exclusively by 
the Department of the Air Force, as outlined in international agreements, real estate documents or 
other written agreements.  This manual outlines key duties and responsibilities of ATC personnel.  
This manual also provides detailed guidance, procedures, and programs for managing ATC where 
the Air Force has functional oversight responsibility.  This publication contains copyrighted 
material. Compliance with the Attachments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in this manual is mandatory.  This 
publication requires the collection and or maintenance of information protected by the Privacy Act 
of 1974 authorized by 5 USC § 552a.  The applicable System of Record Notice(s) (SORN) F036 
AFFSA A, USAF Air Traffic Control (ATC) Certification and Withdrawal Documentation, is 
available at http://dpclo.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx.  This manual may be supplemented 
at any level; however, all major command (MAJCOM) supplements to include interim changes to 
previously approved supplements must be routed to Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA), 
Airfield Operations Division for coordination prior to certification and approval.  References to 
MAJCOM within this publication refer to the MAJCOM office of primary responsibility (OPR)

for airfield operations.  Unit (wing or base) level supplements to this publication must be routed 
to the responsible MAJCOM OPR for airfield operations for coordination prior to certification and 
approval.  The authorities to waive wing, unit, or delta level requirements in this publication are 
identified with a tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement.  See 
DAFMAN 90-161, Publishing Processes and Procedures, for a description of the authorities 
associated with the tier numbers.  Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to 
the appropriate tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the publication OPR for non-tiered 
compliance items or requirements.  Refer to Chapter 1 for additional waiver requirements to this 
manual.  Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the OPR using the 
DAF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route DAF Forms 847 from the field 
through the appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure all records generated as a result of 
processes prescribed in this publication adhere to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-322, Records 
Management and Information Governance Program, and are disposed in accordance with the Air 
Force Records Disposition Schedule, which is in the Air Force Records Information Management 
System.

DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
Chapter 1 
GENERAL 
1.1.  Overview.  This manual provides guidance for managing ATC personnel, programs, 
facilities and airfields DAF wide.  This manual is complemented by AFMAN 13-204, Volume 1, 
Management of Airfield Operations.  
1.2.  The Military and Civilian Aviation Integration Division.  The military and civilian 
Aviation Integration Division Career Field Management is responsible for Air Force Specialty 
Codes (AFSCs): 13MX, Airfield Operations officer, 1C1X1, ATC, 1C7X1, Airfield Management 
(AM), and 1C8X3, Radar, Airfield and Weather Systems (RAWS).  Career Field Manager (CFM) 
duties will be executed according to AFMAN 36-2100, Military Utilization and Classification, 
DAFI 36-2670, Total Force Development, and AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization.  This 
list is not all inclusive. 
1.3.  Headquarters Air Force Flight Standards Agency (HQ AFFSA).  HQ AFFSA is 
responsible for terminal area airfield operations (i.e., ATC, AM and RAWS) matters.  In this 
capacity, HQ AFFSA executes responsibilities as outlined in Air Force mission directive (AFMD) 
27, Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA), in keeping with policy guidance provided by the 
SAF.  For the purpose of addressing specific procedural, training, standardization, architecture and 
integration issues directly related to airfield operations, HQ AFFSA may have cause to interact 
with the MAJCOMs, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and other military services. 
1.4.  Operations at Contingency Locations.  Contingency is defined as a situation requiring 
military operations in response to natural disasters, terrorists, subversives, or as otherwise directed 
by appropriate authority to protect United States interests.  At contingency locations, outside the 
United States, the senior airfield authority (SAA) may waive airfield operations procedures 
outlined in this manual to support tactical or combat operations.  This authority must not be 
exercised below the SAA level. (T-1) Prior to issuance of such a waiver, the following actions 
must be accomplished: 
1.4.1.  Conduct a risk management assessment with the rationale for the waiver and explain 
(1) how complying with the requirement/compliance item impacts mission accomplishment, 
OR (2) cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower) 
creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; OR (3) expected cost of compliance 
outweighs the benefit; OR (4) personnel cannot comply with the requirement due to a lack of 
resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower).  Note: SAA waiver 
period must not exceed requested waiver period or 30 calendar days after the approving 
commander’s deployment length, whichever is shorter. (T-1)  Because waivers are the 
expression of a specific commander’s risk acceptance, approved waivers automatically expire 
30 calendar days after a change in commander, unless the new commander renews the waiver.  
1.4.2.  Forward proposed waivers to the Headquarters Air Force (HAF) staff or equivalent for 
an operational review if time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA. 
1.4.3.  Refer to Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-4.13v2, 
Contingency Airfield Operations for additional information.  This AFTTP outlines how Air 
Force forces open and operate a deployed or contingency airfield.  This AFTTP volume also 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
9 
contains planning considerations for airfield management, ATC, and deployable air traffic 
control and landing systems (ATCALS) capabilities, procedures, forces, and equipment. 
1.5.  Airfields Operated Pursuant to Contract.  This manual applies to locations where 
Department of Defense (DoD) or Air Force access is pursuant to contract, to the extent specifically 
outlined in the contract statement of work (SOW) and/or performance work statement (PWS).  
Locations unable to comply with these criteria due to pre-existing SOWs are exempt until such 
time that the current contract expires.  Locations that exclude this manual, will specifically state 
rationale for the exclusion in the SOW. (T-2)  
1.6.  Host Nation Locations.  Any host nation procedures, or procedures based on otherwise 
inapplicable international regulations that are being implemented to fulfill basing or similar 
agreements should be implemented consistent with this manual to the extent possible.  While 
agreed practices adopted for DAF use in foreign areas take precedence, every effort should be 
made to conform to this manual. 
1.6.1.  MAJCOMs must identify any special procedures agreed with host nations in their 
supplement to this manual.  Refer conflicting procedures to HQ AFFSA prior to 
implementation. 
1.6.2.  Airfield operations personnel augmenting a facility operated by another branch of the 
United States (U.S.) military will comply with their regulations and procedures as applicable. 
(T-0) 
1.7.  Waivers. 
1.7.1.  Units will use the DAF Form 679, Air Force Publication Compliance Item Waiver 
Request/Approval to process waivers to this manual. (T-1)  
1.7.2.  Unit waiver request must include the following: 
1.7.2.1.  A paragraph reference or text of the specific requirement for which the 
commander/director is requesting a waiver. (T-1) 
1.7.2.2.  Rationale for the waiver. (T-1)  Explain which one of the following reasons apply 
and why: (1) How complying with the requirement/compliance item impacts mission 
accomplishment; OR, (2) Cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, 
guidance or manpower) creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; OR (3) Expected 
cost of compliance outweighs the benefit; OR (4) personnel cannot comply with the 
requirement due to a lack of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or 
manpower). 
1.7.2.3.  Time period or circumstance the waiver is needed. (T-1)  Note: Tier 1, 2, and 3 
waivers may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver period or 30 
calendar days after the approving commander’s tour length, whichever is shorter.  Because 
waivers are the expression of a specific commander’s risk acceptance, approved waivers 
automatically expire 30 calendar days after a change in commander unless the new 
commander renews the waiver. 
1.7.2.4.  Risk mitigation measures to be implemented, if necessary, by the requesting 
commander during the waiver period. (T-1) 
1.7.2.5.  Impact if waiver is disapproved. (T-1) 
10 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
1.7.3.  If deemed necessary, submit additional data (e.g., local operating procedure, airspace 
maps, traffic patterns, airfield diagrams) to substantiate the waiver request.

RECORDS MANAGEMENT, INQUIRIES AND DATA 
3.1.  ATC Forms.  Unless otherwise indicated, maintain all forms as official facility records 
according to AFI 33-322.  Publish proper documentation and management of forms in the 
appropriate LOP. 
3.1.1.  The CCTLR will ensure forms are ordered through the base publications office or 
nearest FAA facility as required. (T-2) 
3.1.2.  Flight Progress Strips.  Use any FAA approved form, as determined by the type of 
printing system.  Destroy after 6 months unless material is related to a mishap and is required 
to be maintained beyond 6 months. 
3.1.3.  DAF Form 3616, Daily Record of Facility Operation.  Use DAF Form 3616 or suitable 
substitute to document all abnormal conditions and occurrences during each shift in the airfield 
operations facilities.  An ATC controller other than the WS must include the controller’s 
operating initials when making entries to the DAF Form 3616 or suitable substitute. (T-2)  
Note: The operating initials of a controller performing WS training are not required following 
trainee entries.  Facilities may initiate a new form at the beginning of each shift or use one 
form for a 24- hour period.  CCTLRs must sign the DAF Form 3616 or suitable substitute to 
indicate a review for operationally relevant information. (T-2)  This form may be computer 
generated, typed, or handwritten.  Destroy after 6 months unless material is related to a mishap 
and is required to be maintained beyond 6 months. 
3.1.3.1.  The WS accepts responsibility for the facility by making an initial entry with the 
exact time and their operating initials in the remarks section.  Document temporary 
absences during the shift unless the WS can immediately recall the controller to duty as 
determined by the CCTLR.  Anytime a WS is relieved, enter the first name initial and last 
name and indicate the transfer of responsibility for the shift on DAF Form 3616 (e.g., "0901 
H. DRAKE OFF, WT ON AS WS").  Entering the name of the relieved WS serves the 
same purpose as signing the certification statement at the top of the actual form.  The WS 
responsible for the shift must sign the DAF Form 3616 or suitable substitute. (T-2)  
Individuals must not change the entries of a previous WS without the member’s consent 
unless procedures are defined in the facility OI for administrative changes (e.g., acronyms, 
time sequence, and missed personnel absences). (T-3) 
3.1.3.2.  Use only authorized Air Force, FAA, and ICAO abbreviations and phrase 
contractions.  Exception: In addition to Air Force, FAA, and ICAO abbreviations, facility 
CCTLRs may develop local abbreviations. Include these local abbreviations in the facility 
OI. 
3.1.3.3.  CCTLRs may authorize the use of this form to log position times instead of DAF 
Form 3626, Position Log.  The CCTLR specifies which form to use and procedures for 
logging the position times in a facility OI.  The CCTLR should ensure use of either form 
is consistent throughout the facility (i.e., use DAF Form 3616 all the time or DAF Form 
3626 all the time). 
3.1.4.  DAF Form 3626, Position Log.  Use DAF Form 3626 or a suitable substitute to record 
individuals responsible for each operating position.  The controller being relieved must ensure 
20 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
the relieving controller’s operating initials are on the form at the time they assume 
responsibility for the position. (T-2)  If assigning a trainee to a position, include the trainee’s 
initials on the form followed by the relieving controller’s operating initials.  CCTLRs may 
specify multiple positions to use a single position log, each position using one side of the form 
(e.g., positions that are side by side, simulator positions) in a facility OI.  The WS position 
does not require a position log. Destroy after 6 months unless material is related to a mishap 
and is required to be maintained beyond 6 months. 
3.1.5.  DAF Form 3624, Equipment Outage Log.  Use DAF Form 3624, DAF Form 3616, or 
suitable substitute for recording equipment outages or malfunctions and maintenance 
notifications.  Use one form until filled, or as directed by the CCTLR in a facility OI.  Transfer

compensation or hire (e.g., World Air, Tower Air, Federal Express, U.S. commercial 
airlines, and charter services such as Tango Cessna TN4426E), including UAS 
operations requiring ATC coordination in controlled airspace (tower and radar). 
3.1.9.4.4.  Helicopter – military helicopter operations.  This includes operations 
conducted under IFR and/or VFR. 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
23 
3.1.9.4.5.  Other – operations wherein a VFR tower receives a point-out for an IFR 
aircraft executing an instrument approach to an adjacent airport, or as otherwise 
coordinated and approved for use by the MAJCOM.  This area constitutes a non-
countable category and values tabulated in this area do not affect the "type of activity" 
sub-categories totals (e.g., IFR arrivals, IFR departures). 
3.1.9.5.  Type of activity (defined): 
3.1.9.5.1.  IFR departure – IFR or Special Visual Flight Rules (SVFR) departures and 
IFR, SVFR, or VFR aircraft flying an instrument approach which terminates in other 
than a full-stop landing and continues to receive IFR service. 
3.1.9.5.2.  IFR Arrival – IFR, SVFR, and VFR aircraft, that fly an instrument, visual, 
or contact approach to an airport or point-in-space. 
3.1.9.5.3.  VFR Local – VFR aircraft that arrive or depart an airport served by the 
control tower. 
3.1.9.5.4.  VFR Itinerant – VFR aircraft that originate outside the tower’s designated 
airspace and fly through the airspace without making an approach. 
3.1.9.5.5.  VFR service – VFR aircraft that receive services but do not make an 
instrument approach. 
3.1.9.5.6.  Over-flight – IFR or SVFR aircraft that originate outside the area of 
jurisdiction and fly through the area without making an approach.  “Area of 
jurisdiction” is defined as the total designated or depicted airspace (lateral and vertical) 
boundaries over which an ATC facility has authority, including all subdivided sectors 
for air traffic control reporting purposes.  Do not count aircraft transitioning the area of 
jurisdiction as multiple over-flights and/or SUA activities when tabulating one aircraft 
or a flight’s, route of flight. 
3.1.9.5.7.  Special use – Aircraft (including UAS) that conduct activities in airspace of 
defined dimensions identified by an area on the surface of the earth wherein activities 
are to be confined because of their nature or wherein limitations may be imposed upon 
aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities. 
3.1.9.5.7.1.  Count activities conducted in alert areas, controlled firing areas, 
MOAs, prohibited areas, restricted areas, and warning areas as special use 
operations. 
3.1.9.5.7.2.  Any other area or activity not listed requires MAJCOM approval. 
3.1.9.5.7.3.  Counting of SUA operations only occurs when an aircraft or flight 
employs the intended purpose of the SUA. 
3.1.9.5.7.4.  Use of multiple sectors within the same MOA by the same aircraft or 
flight is only counted as one SUA operation.  This includes aircraft or flights 
authorized to work combined sectors within the same MOA, or those which 
transition from working one sector to working another sector within the same 
MOA.  Exception: When elements of a flight operating in assigned SUA require 
separate ATC identification and services, count each operation as a separate SUA 
activity.  For counting purposes, the key determinant is after flight split-up, each 
24 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
element requires separate ATC identification and services apart from previous 
flight activities.  In this case, count each operation as separate SUA activity using 
the provisions of this paragraph. 
3.1.9.5.8.  An aircraft or flight may be counted as either an over-flight or a SUA 
activity, but not both. 
3.1.9.6.  Type of approach (defined): 
3.1.9.6.1.  PAR – any aircraft which conducts a PAR approach. 
3.1.9.6.2.  ASR – any aircraft which conducts an ASR approach.

4.5.  ATC Restrictions and Duty Limitations.  To manage or operate a control position in an Air 
Force ATC facility, individuals must comply with Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
Part 65, Certification: Airmen Other Than Flight Crewmembers as well as requirements identified 
in paragraph 11.3. (T-0)  Applicable requirements have been incorporated into this manual.  The 
CCTLR must develop local procedures to ensure compliance with the following. (T-0)  
4.5.1.  Medical Requirements: 
4.5.1.1.  Military controllers must meet physical qualifications according to DAFMAN 48-
123, Medical Examination and Standards. (T-1)  Civilian (GS-2152) controllers must 
obtain and maintain a valid Class II FAA physical examination and certificate. (T-0)  The 
physical examination for GS-2152s must be performed by a designated aero medical 
examiner (AME) or flight surgeon’s office. (T-2)  Note: Payment for the annual General 
Schedule (GS)-2152 Class II physical examination is a unit responsibility as a condition of 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
29 
employment.  Per the Air Force Medical Support Agency, an AME-certified military 
doctor can perform duties of AME. 
4.5.1.2.  Personnel ordinarily assigned to an operating position, including those who 
directly supervise within the facility, must not use any drug likely to affect alertness, 
judgment, vision, or state of consciousness within a 24-hour period before assumption of 
duty unless a medical waiver is obtained. (T-1)  Note: Controllers should contact the flight 
surgeon’s office immediately for any prescriptions received from non-flight surgeon 
personnel. 
4.5.1.3.  Controllers must not be assigned ATC duties for at least 12 hours after donating 
blood (formal flight surgeon restriction not required). (T-2)  Controllers must coordinate 
with the CCTLR prior to giving blood to minimize mission impact. (T-2)  
4.5.1.4.  Appropriate medical authority must clear controllers receiving unscheduled 
medical or dental treatment (e.g., emergency room) before the controller performs ATC 
duties. (T-2)  If emergency medical care/treatment is required, notify the CCTLR as soon 
as possible.  The appropriate Aero Medical Examiner must clear civilian (GS-2152) 
controllers. (T-2)  
4.5.1.5.  Controllers must coordinate with the CCTLR prior to scheduling and receiving 
non-emergency medical/dental treatment or immunizations which could affect duty 
performance capability. (T-2)  Note: Controllers cannot perform ATC duties for at least 
eight hours after receiving a local or general anesthetic agent. 
4.5.1.6.  Controllers must coordinate elective medical procedures with the CCTLR to avoid 
unplanned loss of work due to DNIC status, which may result from the procedure. (T-2)  
4.5.1.7.  Controllers must neither perform ATC duties nor directly supervise other 
controllers, while under the influence of alcohol, (blood alcohol level of .04 or greater) or 
within 12 hours of consuming any amount of alcohol. (T-1)  If alcohol is used during off-
duty time, the usage should be conservative, so an individual’s mental alertness and ability 
to perform are not reduced by the after-effects (hangover) of alcohol.  Abstinence 12 hours 
before commencing ATC duties does not guarantee blood alcohol level below .04 at the 
start of duty when large amounts are consumed. 
4.5.1.8.  Remote or Isolated Duty.  Controllers going to a base or location that does not 
have an Air Force medical treatment facility with a physical examination section, must 
complete a preventive health assessment (PHA) or periodic medical examination as 
required, if the exam is due during the tour or deployment. (T-1)  Additional guidance is 
available in AFI 48-170, Periodic Health Assessment. 
4.5.2.  Hours of Duty in support of US or Host Nation (HN) NAS and/or civil traffic.  To 
enhance flight safety, air traffic controllers’ duty hours are restricted to ensure they are not 
fatigued while performing ATC duty.  CCTLRs must comply with the following guidance 
when scheduling air traffic controllers for duty. 
4.5.2.1.  A normal shift should be eight hours and must not exceed ten hours. (T-1) 
4.5.2.2.  A scheduled off-duty period between shifts must occur. (T-1)  The duration of the 
off-duty period will be at least 12 hours for military, DoD civilian controllers filling Unit 
Type Code (UTC) taskings, and civilian controllers assigned as a reservist to a deployable 
30

UTC.  The duration of off-duty time will be at least 8 hours for Civilian DoD controllers. 
(T-1) 
4.5.2.3.  When unforeseen events prevent staffing a facility as scheduled (emergency 
leaves, controllers in DNIC status, or other short-notice unexpected loss of personnel), 
controllers may be recalled to ATC duty with only eight hours between shifts. 
4.5.2.4.  Duty time begins with the first scheduled duty, either ATC or non-ATC.  Once 
duty time begins, it is continuous.  After ten hours of continuous duty, controllers must not 
perform further ATC duty. (T-1)  A 12-hour uninterrupted break (8 hours when unforeseen 
events occur and/or for non-UTC tasked DoD civilian controllers) must occur before the 
controller’s next scheduled duty time requiring performance of ATC duties. (T-1)  
Controllers must have at least 24 hours of uninterrupted, off-duty time following 6 
consecutive days of duty. (T-1) 
4.5.2.5.  MAJCOM and numbered air force commanders may direct 12-hour surge shifts 
only at locations outside the NAS, where required to support contingencies or exercises.  
When using surge shifts, controllers must have a 12-hour uninterrupted rest period between 
shifts. (T-1) 
4.5.3.  Hours of Duty for Operations not in support of US or HN NAS and/or civil traffic (e.g., 
Landing Zone [LZ] operations, military exercises within restricted airspace). 
4.5.3.1.  A normal shift will not exceed 12 hours. (T-3) 
4.5.3.2.  A scheduled off-duty period between shifts must occur. (T-1)  The duration of the 
off-duty period will be at least 8 hours. (T-3) 
4.6.  Proficiency Program.  CCTLRs must establish monthly position time requirements and 
track controller proficiency time in accordance with paragraph 3.1.8. (T-2)  Track proficiency 
time requirements from the first to the last day of each calendar month, and outline additional 
actions for a controller who fails to meet monthly proficiency time requirements in a facility OI. 
(T-2)  
4.6.1.  Controllers must maintain proficiency, competency as well as required time minimums, 
in all positions in which they are certified. (T-2)  When positions are combined, proficiency 
time may count for each position provided the controller performs ATC duties associated with 
each position under normal workload conditions.  A controller must perform air traffic control 
duties under normal workload conditions in each operating position they are certified in no 
later than the end of the last day of each month. (T-2) 
4.6.2.  Only apprentice controllers, prior to receiving initial SEI, can receive proficiency time 
while being monitored by a trainer for the positions in which they are certified.  Individuals 
may receive proficiency time while monitoring trainees as determined by the CCTLR.  Note: 
13Ms who have completed required certifications but do not have a facility rating may also 
receive proficiency time while being overseen by a trainer for the positions in which they are 
certified. 
4.6.3.  Simulation scenarios may be used to maintain controller proficiency; however, 
CCTLRs must ensure simulation does not exceed 50% of the overall time requirement. (T-3) 
4.6.4.  Qualified WS may count time worked while monitoring WS trainees for Special Duty 
Assignment Pay requirements. 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
31 
4.7.  Consolidating Positions.  The WS must assign personnel to positions as required by activity, 
equipment and facility function. (T-3)  The WS should consolidate positions only after considering 
activity and qualifications of the personnel involved (reference paragraph 4.4 for facility staffing 
requirements).  The WS will not combine local control with any other operating position, except 
during periods of authorized single-controller operations. (T-1)  
4.8.  Operating Initials.  CCTLRs must assign unique two-letter operating initials to controllers 
to identify them for record purposes. (T-0)  Unless signatures are specifically requested, controllers 
use assigned operating initials for all operating forms, interphone contacts, marking of recordable 
data media, and other records.  CCTLRs must maintain a listing of controller initials. (T-3)  Duty 
rosters with name and initials can meet this requirement.  Note: ATC personnel will use payroll 
initials (i.e., HDD) on the DAF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, 
CFETP, or DAF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command Job Qualification 
Standard. (T-2) 
4.9.  Pre-Duty Familiarization.  CCTLRs must establish pre-duty familiarization procedures that 
provide for a comprehensive and smooth transition from one crew to the next in a facility OI. (T-0)  
Procedures should allow for continuity of ATC services without interruption.  CCTLRs may 
increase the number of items and/or the level of detail of the pre-duty briefing and the position 
relief checklist as deemed necessary. 
4.9.1.  CCTLRs must ensure the following areas to facility operations are in the pre-duty 
familiarization briefing, as applicable: 
4.9.1.1.  Status Information Areas/Boards. (T-2)  
4.9.1.2.  Equipment (e.g., NAVAIDs, radar, radios, weather dissemination systems). (T-2)  
4.9.1.3.  Airport Conditions/Status (e.g., runway surface condition (RSC), runway 
suspensions). (T-2)  
4.9.1.4.  Airport Activities (e.g., snow removal, vehicles on runway). (T-2)  
4.9.1.5.  Altimeter/Trends. (T-2)  
4.9.1.6.  Weather (current and forecasted). (T-2)  
4.9.1.7.  Special Activities (e.g., restricted or warning areas in use, UAS operations, flight 
checks). (T-2) 
4.9.1.8.  Special Instructions/Restrictions (e.g., due to adjacent position training, non-
standard staffing/configuration). (T-2)  
4.9.1.9.  Facility Staffing/Training Assignments (e.g., current/proposed daily training 
plan). (T-2)  
4.9.1.10.  New procedures. (T-2)  
4.9.1.11.  Applicable Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). (T-2) 
4.9.2.  CCTLRs must ensure position relief briefings follow locally developed checklists and 
that briefings are being recorded. (T-2)  
4.9.3.  Controllers must read/sign off on operational procedure changes (e.g., RIF) prior to 
assignment to an operational position. (T-2) 
32 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
4.10.  Wind Information. 
4.10.1.  Select wind sensors for the approach end of runway unless an operational advantage 
will result from another setting.  Advise pilots if reported wind is from other than the approach 
end of runway.  Including this information on the Automatic terminal information service 
(ATIS) broadcast satisfies this requirement, if pilots advise they have current ATIS 
information.  Exception: Locations where only one wind sensor is installed are not required 
to advise pilots the wind is not from the approach end. 
4.10.2.  Controllers will issue wind direction and speed from wind displays. (T-2)  When wind 
displays are unavailable, issue wind information contained in the latest weather sequence, 
prefaced with the term “wind estimated.”  Note: Base Weather is the authority for determining 
if winds should be estimated at locations without LAWRS certified controllers. Example: 
"WIND TWO-TWO-ZERO AT ONE-FIVE." 
4.10.2.1.  Controllers will issue wind gusts when observed. (T-3)  Example: "WIND TWO-
TWO-ZERO AT ONE- FIVE, GUST TWO-SEVEN." 
4.10.2.2.  Controllers will issue variable wind information when observed. (T-3)  Variable 
wind is defined as a wind direction change of 60 degrees or more in the preceding 2 
minutes, when the wind speed is greater than 6 knots.  For reasons of operational advantage 
or pattern efficiency, the Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) may waive the 
requirement to issue variable winds to wing aircraft.  If waived, document procedures in 
the Airfield Operations Instruction (AOI).  Example: "WIND THREE-ONE-ZERO AT 
ONE-FIVE, VARIABLE BETWEEN TWO-SEVEN- ZERO AND THREE-FOUR-ZERO." 
4.10.2.3.  Controllers should issue gust spread only if specifically requested by the pilot.  
Gust spread is defined as the difference between wind speed lull and wind speed peak 
during the preceding 10 minutes.  Example: "GUST SPREAD TWO-THREE." 
4.11.  Use of Communications.  Use ATC frequencies for the transmission authorized ATC 
instructions and information (guidance located in FAAO JO 7110.65AA, Chapter 2). 
4.11.1.  Controllers must not transmit or permit the transmission of: 
4.11.1.1.  Non-ATC instructions and information, except as in paragraph 4.11.2 and 4.11.3 
below. (T-0)  
4.11.1.2.  Obscene, indecent or profane language. (T-0)  
4.11.1.3.  False or deceptive communications. (T-0)  
4.11.1.4.  Willful or malicious interference with other communications. (T-0)  
4.11.1.5.  Superfluous or unauthorized transmissions including remarks of a personal 
nature. (T-0)  
4.11.2.  Occasionally, it is necessary to transmit a message not directly associated with ATC 
but pertains to safety of aircraft operation or preserving life or property.  In these situations, 
controllers or non-ATC individuals may transmit such a message.  A non-ATC person will 
only transmit this kind of message if: 
4.11.2.1.  The transmission is coordinated with ATC facilities prior to transmitting. (T-0)  
4.11.2.2.  ATC instructions are not issued. (T-0)  
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
33 
4.11.2.3.  Controllers can interrupt transmissions to continue ATC services. (T-0)  
4.11.3.  ATC facilities relay essential non-ATC instructions to aircraft if no other source of 
communications is available and transmissions do not interfere with the controller’s 
responsibility to prevent collision between aircraft. 
4.11.3.1.  Commanders must ensure maximum use of pilot-to-dispatch, operations center, 
or similar facilities to relay non-ATC information. (T-2)  
4.11.3.2.  Relaying distinguished visitor (DV) information is necessary for military 
protocol.  An ATC facility with direct landline capability may relay DV information to a 
single agency (AM, operations center or command post).  The use of automated 
notifications is authorized if procedures are contained in a LOP or AOI. 
4.11.3.3.  When an unauthorized agency uses an ATC frequency, the WS must make an 
entry on the DAF Form 3616. (T-2)  
4.11.4.  Unless safety of flight or necessity for the control of air traffic dictates otherwise, 
controllers should avoid transmitting to aircraft in the following critical phases of flight: short 
final, touchdown, landing roll, departure roll, and initial climb-out. 
4.12.  Landline Operations.  CCTLRs must ensure ATC facilities have direct and reliable 
landline communications with adjacent terminal and enroute facilities and specified base agencies. 
(T-0)  The CCTLR must ensure each telephone line and landline terminates in a communications 
key system in the facility, if possible. (T-0)  A direct landline is a dedicated telephone circuit that 
terminates in two facilities only, with no access available by another facility.  Two-digit ring lines 
between enroute and terminal facilities meet the above criteria.  Note: The optimum configuration 
between ATC facilities is a direct ring line or a "shout" line. 
4.13.  Radar and Tower Coordination. 
4.13.1.  To ensure proper sequencing of all arriving radar traffic, define radar and tower 
coordination procedures in a LOP. 
4.13.1.1.  Establishing Local Procedures and Requirements: 
4.13.1.1.1.  Define inbound aircraft notification and coordination procedures to include 
distances from touchdown or end of runway for the coordination points listed in the 
LOP.  Adjust distances outward, if necessary, to meet local operating conditions in a 
LOP. 
4.13.1.1.2.  Define multiple approach procedures, where required. 
4.13.2.  Coordinate all arriving radar traffic as follows: 
4.13.2.1.  Inbound Notification.  When an arriving aircraft has reached a specified point 
from the runway (normally 15 flying miles): 
4.13.2.1.1.  Radar controller provides the tower controller with aircraft identification, 
type, position, type of approach, and type of landing.  State range if other than specified 
in the LOP. 
4.13.2.1.2.  Tower controller acknowledges receipt of arrival information. 
34 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
4.13.2.1.3.  CCTLRs must develop procedures in a facility OI that stipulate when to 
transfer communications to tower, unless local procedures require radar monitoring 
using PAR equipment. (T-2)  
4.13.2.2.  Landing Clearance.  When an aircraft is (minimum) four miles from touchdown 
or end of the runway, the radar controller should request tower clearance for landing, touch-
and-go, stop and go, low approach or for the option. 
4.13.2.2.1.  Radar controller should, verbally state type landing and operating position.  
State range if other than specified in the LOP. 
4.13.2.2.2.  Tower controller acknowledges and issues a verbal landing, touch-and-go, 
stop and go, low approach or for the option clearance when the aircraft is no closer than 
3 miles, from touchdown or end of runway.  The clearance includes field and traffic 
information if appropriate, and altitude restrictions for a low approach, if required. 
4.13.2.2.3.  Radar controller relays the tower clearance verbatim (may simultaneously 
transmit the clearance to the aircraft and tower). 
4.13.2.3.  Establish procedures to cancel the clearance for aircraft on final approach to 
include go around/breakout instructions. 
4.13.2.3.1.  Tower controller will furnish a reason when denying or canceling a 
clearance. (T-2)  
4.13.2.3.2.  The radar controller must verbally advise the tower of a radar-initiated go-
around for the first aircraft on final. (T-2)  Tower acknowledgment indicates receipt of 
the radar-initiated go-around. 
4.13.3.  Minimum Distance Without Final Clearance.  Do not continue a radar or radar-
monitored approach closer than three miles from touchdown using PAR equipment or three 
miles from end of runway using ASR equipment without verbal clearance from the tower 
controller.  These requirements must be contained in a LOP between the tower and the 
servicing radar facility. (T-2)  
4.14.  Automated Functions. 
4.14.1.  When automated functions are used to coordinate arrivals, the CCTLR must ensure 
the LOP governing tower/radar coordination procedures specifies: 
4.14.1.1.  Procedures for data transfer between the radar facility and tower. (T-2) 
4.14.1.2.  Communications changeover points. (T-2) 
4.14.1.3.  Hours or conditions under which facility policy prohibits use of these functions. 
(T-2) 
4.14.1.4.  Operating positions with the authority to determine whether use of automated 
functions is satisfactory or some other means of arrival coordination. (T-2) 
4.14.2.  Rolling/boundary notification.  Automation is an authorized/approved method to 
establish nonverbal rolling/boundary notification for each departing aircraft.  Nonverbal 
notification can be accomplished via a manual, electronic, or automation (e.g., Airfield 
Automation System (AFAS) notification). 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
35 
4.14.3.  Initial Departure Separation Authority (e.g., automatic releases).  When the radar 
facility delegates automatic release authority, tower personnel must provide initial separation 
for arriving/departing aircraft provided these procedures are identified in a LOP. (T-2)  
4.14.3.1.  The CCTLR must ensure at a minimum, that the LOP covering procedures for 
Initial Departure Separation (automatic releases) include: 
4.14.3.1.1.  Arrival/Departure minimum cut-off distances. (T-2)  
4.14.3.1.2.  A statement mandating “automatic releases are not authorized when the 
official weather for the airport is reported as less than a 1000-foot ceiling and/or less 
than three miles official visibility or when the tower visibility is reported as less than 
three miles.” (T-2)  
4.14.3.1.3.  Either facility may cancel automatic releases when deemed necessary. 
(T-2)  
4.15.  Opposite Direction Traffic.  CCTLRs must develop and define Opposite Direction 
Operation (ODO) procedures in the AOI and in a Letter of Agreement (LOA) when the FAA 
provides radar services or the Tower/RAPCON coordination LOP where the Air Force provides 
approach and tower services. (T-0)  Controllers must restrict same-runway opposite direction 
operations with opposing traffic inside the applicable cutoff points unless an emergency situation 
exists. (T-0)  Note: The Air Force ATC definition for ODO is: IFR/VFR operations conducted to 
the same or parallel runway, greater than 135 degrees in a reciprocal direction of the runway being 
utilized for the ODO operation. 
4.15.1.  ODO procedures apply to all aircraft whether or not the aircraft is operating VFR or 
IFR.  At locations that conduct ODOs for aircraft receiving separation services, the CCTLR 
must ensure facility directives define minimum cutoff points, distances or fixes for same 
runway operations. (T-0)  Consider all airfield conditions and flight profiles (e.g., aircraft 
performance, runway configuration, type of approach, tactical procedures) which may affect 
ODOs. 
4.15.2.  For aircraft receiving IFR/VFR services that are conducting ODO to the same runway, 
CCTLRs must ensure facility directives define minimum cutoff points between: 
4.15.2.1.  An arrival and a departure. (T-2)  
4.15.2.2.  An arrival and an arrival. (T-2)  
4.15.2.3.  The cutoff points established must be in flying miles and ensure required lateral 
separation exists. (T-1)  Note: Established cutoff points do not absolve the controller from 
the application of any applicable time-based wake turbulence criteria. 
4.15.2.3.1.  When a departing aircraft becomes airborne and has been issued a turn to 
avoid conflict or when the first aircraft has crossed the runway threshold for opposite 
direction arrivals. (T-2)  
4.15.2.3.2.  If the above conditions are not met, action must be taken to ensure control 
instructions are issued to protect the integrity of the cutoff points. (T-2)  
4.15.2.4.  For VFR aircraft which are conducting ODO to same or parallel runways, 
CCTLRs must ensure facility directives specify that VFR aircraft are issued a turn to avoid 
conflict with opposing IFR/VFR traffic. (T-1) 
36 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
4.15.3.  For aircraft receiving IFR services that are conducting ODO to parallel runways, 
regardless of distance between centerlines: 
4.15.3.1.  Ensure a turn away from opposing traffic is issued when opposing traffic is inside 
cutoff points. 
4.15.3.2.  Use of visual separation is authorized once a turn from opposing traffic is issued. 
4.15.4.  Controllers must conduct all coordination on a recorded line. (T-1)  Controller’s initial 
coordination must include the phrase below. (T-1)  PHRASEOLOGY: “OPPOSITE 
DIRECTION DEPARTURE/ARRIVAL, (CALL SIGN) (TYPE AIRCRAFT), RUNWAY 
(number)." 
4.15.4.1.  All coordination thereafter between controllers must include the phrase below. 
(T-1)  PHRASEOLOGY: "OPPOSITE DIRECTION DEPARTURE/ARRIVAL, RUNWAY 
(number)." 
4.15.5.  CCTLRs must ensure facility directives require traffic advisories to participating 
opposite direction aircraft. (T-0)  Example: “OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC (distance) 
MILE FINAL, (type aircraft) or OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC DEPARTING RUNWAY 
(number), (type aircraft), OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC, (position), (type aircraft).” 
4.15.6.  CCTLRs must prescribe procedures for use of a memory aid for ODO (e.g., “ODO” 
strip, use of red-colored ink pen/marker, use of automation to bring attention to tag). (T-0)  
4.16.  Practice Approaches/Departures.  Controllers must ensure VFR aircraft practicing 
instrument approaches at the approach control’s primary airport are provided IFR separation. (T-0)  
The primary airport is the airport from which approach control service is provided.  CCTLRs must 
ensure tactical approach/departure requirements are established in a LOP between participating 
agencies and aircraft. (T-2)  CCTLRS must ensure guidance includes traffic patterns and 
procedures to ensure protection of non-participating aircraft. (T-2)  
4.17.  Clearance Delivery.  The WS must ensure the clearance delivery function is performed by 
a controller not actively controlling airborne traffic, except during periods of authorized SC 
operations. (T-2)  The CCTLR must ensure a clearance delivery position in a RAPCON has a 
discrete frequency dedicated to clearance delivery and must not be keyed simultaneously with 
other frequencies. (T-0) 
4.18.  Emergency Frequencies.  CCTLRs must ensure ATC facilities, except GCA and RFC, 
have transmit and receive capability on emergency frequencies 121.5 and 243.0 Megahertz. (T-0)  
Continuously monitor the emergency frequencies during operational hours.  When more than one 
Air Force ATC facility shares the emergency radio equipment, the tower CCTLR must ensure the 
control tower has override capability. (T-0)  Tower should have override capability on emergency 
radio equipment shared with FAA ATC facilities.  CCTLRs must ensure ATC facilities have an 
override capability on emergency radio equipment shared by non-ATC agencies. (T-0)  Note: 
Check override capability at least once daily. 
4.18.1.  Controllers handle unscheduled personnel, emergency, or crash locator beacon signals, 
as an emergency, regardless of duration.  The Wing Commander (WG/CC) may require a lesser 
level of notification and response and direct ATC not to activate the Primary Crash Alarm 
System (PCAS).  The WG/CC must ensure notification and response procedures are 
established. (T-2)  If controllers do not activate the PCAS, the ATC facility will notify a single 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
37 
named, base agency and the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) or appropriate host 
nation equivalent. (T-2)  CCTLRs must define procedures in the AOI. (T-2) 
4.18.2.  Operational testing of a personnel, emergency, or crash locator beacon may not require 
a response when the test is conducted within the first five minutes of the hour and is no longer 
than three audio sweeps. 
4.19.  Monitoring NAVAID Equipment.  An internal monitor is an integral part of each 
NAVAID which automatically transfers transmitters or shuts down the NAVAID when its 
performance falls below established tolerances.  CCTLRS must ensure each NAVAID used for 
instrument flight is monitored. (T-1)  
4.19.1.  When a Remote Status Indicator (RSI) is inoperative or the RSI monitoring facility is 
unmanned, controllers should continue to use NAVAIDs equipped with an internal monitor as 
long as pilot or maintenance reports show the NAVAID is operating normally. 
4.19.2.  At locations where NAVAIDs operate less than 24-hours daily, the CCTLR must 
ensure NAVAID operating hours are published in appropriate Flight Information Products 
(FLIPs). (T-2)  
4.19.3.  Refer to AFMAN 13-204 Volume 1 for facility monitoring, category downgrading, 
and snow effects on ILS glide slope requirements. 
4.20.  Alternate ATC Capabilities.  The OG/CC determines if there is a need for alternate ATC 
capabilities to sustain ATC services during emergency conditions.  Where a need has been 
established define transition procedures and any restrictions on flight operations or vehicle 
movement due to alternate ATC facility limitations in a LOP. 
4.20.1.  CCTLRs must ensure the following capabilities are available for fixed alternate ATC 
facility operations: 
4.20.1.1.  Ultra 
High 
Frequency 
(UHF)/Very 
High 
Frequency 
(VHF) 
transmitters/receivers. (T-2)  
4.20.1.2.  Landline communications. (T-2)  
4.20.1.3.  Land Mobile Radio (LMR) with transmit/receive capability. (T-2)  
4.20.1.4.  Control of airfield lighting. (T-2)  
4.20.1.5.  Applicable publications. (T-2)  
4.20.1.6.  NAVAID monitoring. (T-2)  
4.20.1.7.  Voice recording equipment (if capability exists). (T-2)  
4.20.1.8.  Access to pertinent airfield information (e.g., NOTAMs, weather). (T-2)  
4.20.2.  During emergency/contingency situations, OG/CCs must determine what minimum 
equipment is necessary for ATC operations to ensure flight safety. (T-2)  
4.21.  Precision Approach Critical Areas.  Protect the precision approach critical areas 
according to the AOI and FAAO JO 7110.65AA. 
4.21.1.  Category (CAT) I and II ILS Localizer Critical Areas. 
38 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
4.21.1.1.  When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or the visibility is less than 2 
miles, controllers must restrict all aircraft and vehicle operations in the localizer critical 
area. (T-0)  Do not permit vehicles or aircraft to transit the localizer critical area when an 
aircraft on the ILS approach is inside the Final Approach Fix (FAF).  Exception: A 
preceding aircraft, approaching the same runway or another runway, may pass through the 
area while landing, departing, or exiting the runway; do not allow aircraft to stop within 
the critical area. 
4.21.1.2.  When the reported ceiling is less than 200 feet and/or Runway Visual Range 
(RVR) 2,000 or less (1/2-mile visibility if no RVR), controllers must not authorize vehicle 
or aircraft operations in or over the area when an arriving aircraft is inside 1 Nautical Mile 
(NM) final approach. (T-0)  
4.21.2.  CAT I and II ILS Glide Slope Critical Areas. 
4.21.2.1.  When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility less than 2 miles, 
but at or above 200 feet and/or visibility at or above 1/2 mile (RVR 2,400), controllers 
must restrict all aircraft larger than fighter type size. (T-0)  Controllers will not permit these 
aircraft to taxi beyond the instrument hold line when an aircraft executing an ILS approach 
is inside the FAF. (T-0) 
4.21.2.2.  When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility less than 2 miles, 
controllers must restrict all vehicles. (T-0)  Note: Vehicles (e.g., launch essential vehicle, 
mission support vehicle, and end of runway vehicle) escorting the fighter type size aircraft 
under the conditions of paragraph 4.21.2.1 are authorized to proceed into the 
glideslope/elevation critical area with the aircraft (aircraft tows are not authorized).  
Controllers will not permit vehicles to proceed beyond the instrument hold line when an 
aircraft executing an ILS approach is inside the FAF, unless the arriving aircraft has 
reported the runway in sight or is circling to land on another runway. (T-0)  
4.21.2.3.  When the reported ceiling is less than 200 feet and/or visibility less than 1/2 mile 
(RVR 2,400), controllers must restrict all aircraft and vehicles. (T-0)  Controllers will not 
permit aircraft to taxi or vehicles to proceed beyond the instrument hold line when an 
aircraft executing an ILS approach is inside the FAF. (T-0) 
4.21.3.  PAR Touchdown Areas.  When the reported ceiling is less than 200 feet and/or the 
RVR is 2,000 or less (1/2-mile visibility if no RVR), controllers will not authorize vehicles or 
aircraft in the PAR touchdown area when an aircraft conducting an approach or missed 
approach is inside the Middle Marker (MM) or 1 NM from touchdown if no MM. (T-0)  
4.21.4.  Criteria for Protecting Critical Area.  The DoD is authorized to define criteria for 
protection of precision approach critical areas at military-controlled airports.  The criteria apply 
to both military and civilian aircraft operating at military-controlled airports.

ATC EQUIPMENT 
5.1.  Equipment Checks. 
5.1.1.  CCTLRs must ensure proper operations of all equipment, to include actions after a 
power failure and generator changeover. (T-0)  
5.1.1.1.  CCTLRs, with technical assistance from the NAAM or facility managing the 
equipment (e.g., remote Tower Display Workstation [TDW]) must: 
5.1.1.1.1.  Publish procedures and develop a detailed checklist ensuring operations of 
STARS automated equipment and all locally defined systems. (T-0)  
5.1.1.1.2.  Include procedures for periodic checks, system monitoring, and actions after 
a power failure and generator changeover. (T-0)  
5.1.1.2.  The WS opening the facility must complete all equipment checks, as applicable, 
prior to officially opening the facility. (T-3)  Additionally, each on-coming WS must 
initiate an equipment checklist at the beginning of each shift and complete the checklist as 
soon as possible. (T-3)  ATC services and functions will not be performed prior to official 
facility opening. (T-2) 
5.1.2.  The WS must verify equipment outages daily with the appropriate base agency, and 
document completion of the equipment outage check on DAF Form 3616. (T-3)  Locations 
must establish localized procedures in a LOP to verify outages. (T-3)  Note: These procedures 
should account for days which RAWS personnel are on-call if on-call is authorized. 
5.1.2.1.  ATCALS equipment status must be classified as either in-service or out-of-
service. (T-1)  ATCALS equipment logged as out-of-service must not be used to provide 
ATC services. (T-1)  When maintenance reports equipment as usable and indications are 
the equipment is usable, the equipment should be logged "in service" and, if necessary, an 
airborne check must be accomplished as soon as practical. (T-3)  ATC should not solely 
delay closing work orders due to aircraft non-availability to conduct equipment checks. 
5.1.3.  For automated systems, verification of the accuracy of new or modified digital maps 
must be accomplished through the use of "targets of opportunity" flying over displayed fixes 
or navigational aids. (T-1)  Document any observed discrepancies to indicate the observed 
direction and displacement.  If any identified error cannot be corrected or if a facility is 
otherwise dissatisfied with the results from "targets of opportunity," request a flight check if 
necessary. (T-0)  
5.1.4.  For remotely maintained system outages, controllers will contact the Remote 
Maintenance Center at Defense Switch Network (DSN) 312-884-8651 or commercial 405-
734-8651. (T-2) 
5.2.  Facility Clocks.  A reliable clock showing hours, minutes and seconds must be visible from 
each control position. (T-2)  Facilities without a direct coded time source must obtain a time check 
at the beginning of each shift. (T-0)  
5.2.1.  ATC facilities without coded time sources must acquire time checks from IFR facilities 
equipped with a coded time source, or the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) at DSN 312-762-
40 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
1401, https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/displayclocks/simpletime, a radar facility 
which provides approach service, host nation ARTCC/area control center responsible for the 
terminal area, or a Global Positioning System (GPS)/Digital Audio Legal Recorder 
(DALR)/STARS source. (T-0) 
5.2.2.  Set non-direct coded clocks to within 15 seconds of the time source.  Check clocks 
immediately after the facility goes on backup power and again 30 minutes after.  If found to 
be inaccurate, check clocks hourly until restoring normal power.  Note: Wind sensor 
equipment which provides a reliable clock must be checked at the beginning of each shift 
unless connected to a direct coded time source. (T-0)  
5.2.3.  A direct coded time source can be connected directly to the installation local area 
network (LAN).  The LAN must provide a network time protocol in accordance with National 
Institute of Standards and Technology regulations to synchronize clocks with a local GPS 
receiver. (T-0)  
5.3.  Weather Equipment. 
5.3.1.  Warning Devices (not applicable to Morón AB).  Current observations and pertinent 
severe weather warnings, advisories, and pilot reports must be available at all controller 
positions. (T-0)  Where this is not possible, set up coordination procedures to ensure changes 
to the weather promptly reach each controller position.  Equip automatic weather displays with 
a visual and aural alarm system suited to local operational needs.  Facilities with multiple 
weather displays need only have the aural alarms operational at one position.  Volume must be 
set loud enough for all positions to hear. (T-2)  
5.3.1.1.  Weather Equipment Display.  Controllers will only issue/use the altimeter setting 
contained in the official weather observation. (T-0)  
5.3.2.  Radar Displayed Weather (STARS facilities only).  There are no alarms to indicate to 
the controller or RAWS maintenance personnel when there is a significant signal loss within 
the weather channel.  To mitigate this problem, the following procedures must supplement 
guidance located in FAAO JO 7110.65AA, Chapter 2 Section 6. (T-0)  CCTLRs and NAAMs 
must ensure these procedures are published in a LOP in accordance with paragraph 3.1. (T-0) 
5.3.2.1.  At the beginning of every shift check the accuracy of the digitized weather display 
using the best means available (e.g., Next-Generation Radar [NEXRAD]).  Note: CCTLRs 
should develop a table to correlate STARS weather intensities with secondary weather 
displays (e.g., NEXRAD) when available.  Reference Table 5.1 as an example.

maintenance.  Ensure appropriate NOTAM is issued. 
5.4.  Digital Audio Legal Recorder (DALR) Administration. 
5.4.1.  CCTLRs must ensure personnel performing DALR checks are trained on proper 
methods to be used and task certification is documented on the CFETP and local 797 (as 
applicable). (T-3)  Note: 1C131 personnel may accomplish DALR checks when properly 
trained and certified on the CFETP and local 797 (as applicable). 
5.4.2.  Daily Check. 
5.4.2.1.  Validate the Simple Network Management Protocol software is operational (e.g., 
daily recording checks) and verify normal operations of equipment prior to opening the 
facility.  Note: This function can be accomplished by either Air Traffic or Technical 
Operations personnel.  Responsibilities and procedures should be captured in local 
agreements (guidance located in FAAO JO 6670.16B, Maintenance of Digital Audio Legal 
Recorder Types 1, 2, and N (DALR1/DALR2/DALR-N)). 
5.4.2.2.  CCTLRs must ensure personnel include an entry on the DAF Form 3616 
identifying date, time, and the initials of the person accomplishing the check, at a 
minimum. (T-3) 
5.4.3.  Recordings. 
5.4.3.1.  Rewriteable Compact Discs, Digital Versatile Discs, or any type of flash media 
are NOT authorized for use on the DALR system.  Recordings will be on a Compact Disc 
- Recordable (CD-R) or Digital Versatile Disc - Recordable (DVD-R) only. (T-1)  CD-
Rs/DVD-Rs will be marked with date extracted, date/time of incident, facility name, and 
rank/name of individual accomplishing recording. (T-1) 
5.4.3.2.  Recordings must adhere to the requirements of AFMAN 13-204 Volume 1, 
Chapter 5. (T-1)  Note: The High Density Logger establishes a 45-day protection window 
on recorded data automatically. 
5.4.3.3.  Recordings will not be emailed. (T-1)  Note: Consider DoD Safe as an alternative 
option when necessary to send documents to AFREPs and/or the FAA when geographically 
separated. 
5.4.3.4.  Where capabilities exist, record by operating position, individual frequency, and 
landlines as determined by CCTLR.  At a minimum, the following will be recorded: 
42 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
5.4.3.4.1.  Local Control, PCAS, Arrival Control, Departure Control, Approach 
Control, Coordinator, Flight Data, Approach/Arrival Assistant, Clearance Delivery, 
Ground Control, Supervisor of Flying (SOF), LMR Nets, ATIS, Watch Supervisor, 
Tower Backup Radios, Administrative Telephones, Pilot-to-Dispatch/Pilot-to-Metro 
Frequencies. (T-3) 
5.4.3.4.2.  All DALR channels record individually.  Prioritization of recordings should 
be established at locations that exceed current system capabilities; DALR1 is capable 
of recording up to 48 channels, while DALR2 is capable of recording 144 channels. 
(T-3) 
5.4.4.  System Access and Use. 
5.4.4.1.  DALR users are issued unique log-in passwords (e.g., LOG-IN: RT; 
PASSWORD: chosen by RT). 
5.4.4.1.1.  Log-in password information should not be shared among users (e.g., LOG-
IN: A Crew; PASSWORD: shared by A Crew). 
5.4.4.1.2.  Delete/disable user accounts when a member is reassigned (e.g., Permanent 
Change of Station [PCS], Permanent Change of Assignment [PCA]). 
5.4.4.2.  The DALR should only be used for accessing and editing recordings made with 
the DALR equipment.  The computer workstations should not be used for any other 
purpose. 
5.4.4.3.  No other programs and/or software packages are to be loaded and/or executed on 
any of the DALR system components. 
5.4.4.4.  Restrict profile access as follows: 
5.4.4.4.1.  System Administrator – Airfield operations staff and RAWS personnel only. 
5.4.4.4.2.  Organizer - 7-level airfield operations personnel or above. 
5.4.4.4.3.  Reconstruct – Any airfield operations personnel when properly trained and 
certified on the correlating CFETP and local 797 tasks (as applicable). 
5.4.4.4.4.  Monitor - All airfield operations personnel. 
5.5.  Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS).  Define procedures and conditions for activation in 
the AOI.  Limit agencies with two-way telephones to the control tower, AM (or agency responsible 
for the secondary crash net as required), fire department, and the medical center.  Additional 
agencies may have receive-only capability.  The tower PCAS should have a visual indicator to 
identify when each two-way party on the PCAS picks up the handset.  During real-world 
emergencies, trainees may only activate the PCAS if the trainer/monitor has the capability to 
monitor and transmit over the PCAS. 
5.5.1.  When mobile/temporary facilities are operated, and circumstances make installation of 
a PCAS impractical, establish an alternate system and procedures for emergency response and 
notification.  These procedures must be included in a LOP. (T-2) 
5.5.2.  The PCAS will be checked daily. (T-1)  Results of the check must be annotated in the 
daily record of facility operations or listed as part of the facility equipment checklist. (T-2) 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
43 
5.6.  Land Mobile Radios (LMR).  Each LMR system supporting ATC and aerodrome operations 
must terminate in the control tower console (e.g., Enhanced Terminal Voice Switch [ETVS]) if 
enough transmitter and receiver selection switches and speakers are available. (T-3)  
5.6.1.  Control towers with digital LMRs will establish an LMR net (e.g., Ramp Net, Tower 
net) dedicated for use between vehicle operators and ATC, solely for the purpose of operating 
on the CMA. (T-3)  
5.6.2.  If a Tower Talk Group cannot be established, CCTLRs must establish procedures to 
eliminate unnecessary transmissions (e.g., background noise) in a LOP. (T-3)  
5.7.  Airfield Lighting Systems.  Equip the control tower with the capability to operate airport 
lighting systems and visual aids. Name an agency responsible and define procedures in a LOP for 
operating the airport lighting when the tower closes.  Note: Where pilot controlled lighting systems 
are installed, establish a letter of agreement, as applicable. 
5.8.  ILS Equipment Requirements for Operation.  Loss of transmitter or monitor redundancy 
of either subsystem does affect the category.  Instructions concerning temporary RSI outages in 
paragraph 4.21 also applies.  If the localizer Far Field Monitor (FFM) becomes inoperative on a 
Category II system, ensure AM sends a NOTAM downgrading the ILS to Category until repair of 
the FFM.  Temporary bypass of the FFM does not affect Category I systems. 
5.9.  Automated ATC Systems. 
5.9.1.  MAJCOM RAWS OPR is the authoritative source for the implementation, operation, 
and maintenance of the automated ATC systems they support and maintain.  Operator manuals 
and version description documents (VDDs) are directive in nature. 
5.9.1.1.  CCTLRs must review each Flight Data System (FDS) VDD to determine any 
operational or procedural impact and, when necessary, issue a facility directive describing 
the functional or procedural changes. (T-3)  
5.9.2.  The FAA is the authoritative source for the security and software maintenance of the 
ATC systems they support (e.g., STARS, ETVS).  System Technical Instructions are directive 
in nature.  Prior to operational use of a new program update, the applicable test plan must be 
accomplished, indicating the date and individuals performing the tests. (T-0) 
5.9.3.  Computer hardware, software programs, and databases used to provide operational 
ATC services are mission and life-critical resources.  Do not tamper with, alter, or use these 
resources for other than their intended purposes.  Load only authorized software programs 
provided by the system software manager.  All personnel share the responsibility for protecting 
these resources. 
5.9.4.  Immediately withdraw from service any ATC computer resource suspected of 
malfunctioning due to tampering, abuse or introduction of unauthorized programs (e.g., 
software viruses).  Physically disconnect all interface connections to other computer systems 
and maintain the suspect computer or software for analysis.  The FAA/DoD support personnel 
and AOF/CC must be notified for submittal to MAJCOM RAWS OPR. (T-3) 
5.9.5.  STARS. 
5.9.5.1.  Operational Use. 
44 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
5.9.5.1.1.  STARS data will not be used when the system is released to maintenance. 
(T-0) 
5.9.5.1.2.  Verify and document the operational status of all STARS sub-systems daily.  
Documentation must be retained in accordance with 2.10.12. above. (T-0) 
5.9.5.1.3.  Advise affected facilities when STARS equipment will not be operational at 
normal startup time, when the equipment fails, is shut down, resumes operation, or 
when inter-facility data transfer is lost/regained. (T-3)  
5.9.5.2.  Data Entries.  Facility directives must prescribe the use of the scratch pad and the 
specific responsibility for System Status Area (SSA) entries to include current ATIS alpha 
character, current general system information and system altimeter setting. (T-3)  
5.9.5.3.  Display Data. 
5.9.5.3.1.  When a malfunction causes repeated discrepancies of 300 feet or more 
between the automatic altitude readouts and pilot reported altitudes, inhibit the 
automatic altitude report (Mode C) display until the malfunction has been corrected. 
5.9.5.3.2.  Display Mode C on untracked (unassociated) targets within each controller’s 
area of responsibility by setting the altitude filters to encompass all altitudes within the 
controller’s jurisdiction.  Set the upper limits no lower than 1,000 feet above the highest 
altitude for which the controller is responsible.  In those stratified positions, set the 
upper and lower limit to encompass at least 1,000 feet above and below the altitudes 
for which the controller is responsible.  When the position’s area of responsibility 
includes down to the airport field elevation, the facility must set the lower altitude filter 
limit to encompass the field elevation, to ensure provisions of FAAO JO 7110.65AA 
Chapter 2, and Chapter 5 may be applied. (T-0)  CCTLRs may authorize the 
temporary suspension of this requirement when target clutter is excessive. 
5.9.5.4.  Automation Program Changes. 
5.9.5.4.1.  NAAMs must review all applicable documentation issued by the FAA/DoD 
support facility pertaining to changes in their automated system and database to 
determine any operational or procedural impact. (T-0)  NAAMs must notify facility 
CCTLRs and RAWS personnel of any changes which impact operations or procedures. 
(T-0)  
5.9.5.4.1.1.  When necessary, coordinate any procedural, and airspace change(s) 
with the ARTCC. 
5.9.5.4.1.2.  NAAMs must coordinate functional changes requiring modification of 
inter-facility adaptation with the host ARTCC. (T-0) 
5.9.5.4.1.3.  Facilities without a dedicated NAAM must establish procedures in a 
LOP for effectively managing automation program changes with the FAA, DoD, 
or Host Nation facilities. (T-2) 
5.9.5.4.1.4.  If the STARS facility CCTLR has determined the use of the satellite 
airport database feature containing emergency airport data be available for 
controller use, NAAMs must identify the following: 
5.9.5.4.1.4.1.  Airport/heliport elevation (in feet). (T-3) 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
45 
5.9.5.4.1.4.2.  Longest runway or helipad. (T-3) 
5.9.5.4.1.4.3.  Longest runway length (in feet) (n/a to heliports). (T-3) 
5.9.5.4.1.4.4.  Longest runway width (in feet) (n/a to heliports). (T-3) 
5.9.5.4.1.4.5.  Longest runway/heliport composition. (T-3) 
5.9.5.4.1.4.6.  Universal communications frequency. (T-3) 
5.9.5.4.1.4.7.  Pilot controlled lighting availability. (T-3) 
5.9.5.4.1.4.8.  NAAMs must verify the facilities STARS satellite airport 
database no later than the 10th of each month. (T-3)  This verification may be 
accomplished in conjunction with STARS monthly checks but must be 
completed no later than the 10th of each month. (T-3)  Incorporate appropriate 
procedures into NAAM OI and monthly checklists.  If no discrepancies are 
noted, document the findings in a monthly report via memorandum or a log 
entry of DAF Form 3616.  State the monthly airport/heliport information 
contained in the facility’s STARS database has been verified and is accurate as 
of the date indicated.  Include the radar facility CCTLR as an addressee for 
distribution and retain a copy on file for one year. 
5.9.5.4.1.4.9.  If the monthly database verification has noted discrepancies, 
NAAMs will submit an Adaptation Change Request (ACR) to the Operations 
Support Facility (OSF) no later than the 15th of the month. (T-2)  Document in 
a monthly report that the monthly airport/heliport information contained in the 
facility’s STARS database has been verified and inaccuracies have been 
identified as of the date indicated.  Include details in the monthly report 
specifying when software updates are expected from the OSF.  Include the radar 
facility CCTLR as an addressee for distribution and retain a copy on file for one 
year. 
5.9.5.5.  Automatic Acquisition/Termination Areas. 
5.9.5.5.1.  Facility CCTLRs must: 
5.9.5.5.1.1.  Establish automatic acquisition areas for arrivals and over-flights at 
ranges permitting auto-acquisition of targets prior to the ARTCC/STARS-to-
STARS automatic handoff area when the center is in the radar data processing 
mode. (T-0) 
5.9.5.5.1.2.  Coordinate with adjacent automated facilities to ensure automated 
handoffs will be initiated only after the aircraft is within their facility’s automatic 
acquisition area. (T-2)  Where this is not feasible due to airspace assignment facility 
directives must require the use of an appropriate procedure specified in FAAO JO 
7110.65AA to confirm the identity of all aircraft handed off prior to auto-
acquisition. (T-0)  Note: Automatic acquisition does not constitute radar 
identification. 
5.9.5.5.1.3.  Establish automatic acquisition areas for departing aircraft one mile or 
less from the runway end. (T-0)  
5.9.5.5.1.4.  Establish automatic termination areas for arriving aircraft one mile or 
46 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
less from the runway threshold or, at satellite airports, the minimum radar coverage 
range/altitude, whichever is greater. (T-0) 
5.9.5.5.1.5.  Identify which operating position is responsible for determining if 
automatic acquisition of a departure track has occurred in a LOP. (T-2)  Note: This 
is intended for operations where automatic acquisition responsibility could be 
confused (e.g., uncontrolled airports within a single sector or between different 
radar sectors that serve the same airport). 
5.9.5.6.  Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) and Conflict Alert (CA). 
5.9.5.6.1.  MSAW/Low Altitude Alert System (LAAS).  Radar facilities that have 
MSAW/LAAS capabilities must set MSAW/LAAS requirements in accordance with 
AFMAN 11-230. (T-2)  
5.9.5.6.2.  CCTLRs must ensure an aural test of the MSAW speakers located in the 
operational positions is included as part of the equipment checklist required during each 
shift.  The purpose of this inspection is to ensure the aural alarm is functioning and 
audible to the appropriate operational personnel. (T-3) 
5.9.5.6.3.  When their continued use would adversely impact operational priorities, 
CCTLRs may temporarily inhibit the MSAW, the approach path monitor portion of 
MSAW, and/or the CA functions.  Except when equipment or site adaptation problems 
preclude these functions from being used, a brief written report must be sent to the 
MAJCOM OPR for ATC, as well as AFFSA/XA, whenever they are inhibited. (T-2) 
5.9.5.6.4.  CCTLRs are authorized to inhibit CA at specific operating positions if an 
operational advantage exists. 
5.9.5.6.5.  The most current MSAW Database must be used. (T-3) 
5.9.5.7.  Magnetic Variation of Video Maps/GEO Maps at non-STARS facilities.  
CCTLRs, in coordination with TERPS and the NAAM, must ensure the magnetic variation 
of radar video maps/geo maps, MSAW, Digital Terrain Maps (DTM) and radar site settings 
coincide. (T-2)  The magnetic variation must be verified annually, and a change of two 
degrees or more requires accomplishing/recompiling the affected map(s). (T-3)  Note: The 
video map is the primary reference for maintaining radar antenna alignment. 
5.9.5.8.  MSAW DTM Updates.  Updates to DTM maps will be provided for each site 
through their supporting Operations Support Facility (OSF). (T-1)  Note: Requests for new 
or recompiled DTMs requires approximately 10-weeks to build and deliver. 
5.9.5.9.  Mode C Intruder (MCI) Alert Parameters.  The nominal value of parameters 
specified in the appropriate NAS Configuration Management Document and Site Program 
Bulletins must be used for the MCI alert functions, except for the base altitude parameter, 
as specified in the paragraphs below. (T-2) 
5.9.5.9.1.  CCTLRs must set the MCI Alert base altitude at any value between ground 
level and 500 feet above ground level (AGL). (T-2)  Any instance of base altitudes 
above 500 feet AGL must be documented and forwarded to the MAJCOM OPR for 
ATC. (T-2)  
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
47 
5.9.5.9.2.  CCTLRs are authorized to temporarily adjust the MCI Alert base altitude at 
a sector(s)/position(s) when excessive MCI Alerts derogate the separation of IFR 
traffic.  For the purpose of this section, temporary is considered to be of less than four 
hours duration, not necessarily continuous, during any calendar day.  The following is 
required when MCI base altitude is adjusted: 
5.9.5.9.2.1.  Log each occurrence on DAF Form 3616 when this procedure is being 
used, including the sector/position and temporary altitude. 
5.9.5.9.2.2.  Documentation must be forwarded to the MAJCOM OPR for ATC if 
it is determined that a temporary adjustment of the MCI base altitude does not meet 
the needs of the sector/position. (T-2) 
5.9.5.9.3.  CCTLRs are authorized to inhibit the display of MCI Alert at specified 
sectors/position. 
5.9.5.9.3.1.  CCTLRs must develop and publish procedures for CA suppression and 
use of Military Alert Suppression Zones (MASZ) in a facility OI. (T-2) 
5.9.5.10.  Operational Mode Transition Procedures. 
5.9.5.10.1.  CCTLRs must develop and maintain current detailed procedures in a LOP 
for the transition to and from the various automated and non-automated modes of 
operation. (T-2)  Note: The architecture of STARS allows for different operational 
modes during display component failures.  For example, system component failure 
could result in positions within the same facility operating in a non-automated mode 
with reduced functionality.  Another example, a system component failure could result 
in positions within the same facility operating in Emergency service level (ESL) or Full 
service level (FSL) mode.  Facilities are encouraged to take advantage of this capability 
to minimize the impact of display system outages. 
5.9.5.10.2.  The transition plans must include as a minimum: 
5.9.5.10.2.1.  Transition decision authority (e.g., the individual responsible for 
making the transition decision). (T-2) 
5.9.5.10.2.2.  Specific transition procedures. (T-2) 
5.9.5.10.2.3.  Checklists specifying the duties and the responsibilities for the WS 
and other appropriate positions. (T-2)  At a minimum, include the following 
information/procedures: 
5.9.5.10.2.3.1.  Transition decision authority. (T-2) 
5.9.5.10.2.3.2.  Coordination/notification procedures (intra- and inter-facility). 
(T-2) 
5.9.5.10.2.3.3.  Specific duties/responsibilities (including detection and 
resolution of potential conflicts). (T-2) 
5.9.5.11.  Radar Selection Procedures.  CCTLRs must develop and maintain current 
detailed procedures for radar site selection in a LOP. (T-0)  Note: The architecture of 
STARS allows for the selection of up to 16 different radars including short range and long-
range radars at each display.  This could result in positions within the same facility working 
48 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
and receiving radar information from different radars.  Facilities are encouraged to take 
advantage of this capability to minimize the impact of radar outages, blind areas, limited 
radar coverage, or other unforeseen events. 
5.9.5.11.1.  The selection plans must include as a minimum: 
5.9.5.11.1.1.  Radar selection decision authority (e.g., the individual responsible for 
making the radar selection decision). (T-0)  
5.9.5.11.1.2.  Specific radar selection procedures. (T-0)  
5.9.5.11.1.3.  Detailed checklists specifying the duties and the responsibilities for 
the WS and other appropriate positions. (T-0)  The checklist must include, as a 
minimum, the following information/procedures: 
5.9.5.11.1.3.1.  Radar selection decision authority. (T-0)  
5.9.5.11.1.3.2.  Coordination/notification procedures (intra- and inter-facility).  
Specific duties/responsibilities (e.g., including detection and resolution of 
potential conflicts). (T-0)  
5.9.5.12.  Multi-Sensor Radar Operations and FUSION operations.  CCTLRs must develop 
detailed procedures for selection and use of multi-sensor radar operations and FUSION 
operations, as applicable, in a facility OI. (T-0)  Note: The architecture of STARS allows

authority to grant access to the runway/landing zone without additional coordination with 
local control. (T-2)  
6.11.2.3.  The use of specific phraseology between local and ground control to transfer 
control of the runway/landing zone to include: 
6.11.2.3.1.  Runway/landing zone designator. (T-2) 
6.11.2.3.2.  Accountability of any aircraft, vehicles, or personnel previously on the 
runway or landing zone. (T-2)  Example: “ALL VEHICLES OFF RUNWAY 17C, 
RUNWAY 17C YOUR CONTROL.” 
6.11.2.4.  Identify the position responsible for activating and/or implementing memory 
aids in accordance with paragraph 6.11.1. (T-2) 
6.12.  Standardized Taxi Routes (STRs).  Controllers may issue standardized taxi routes (STRs) 
to DoD base-assigned aircraft only, provided all of the following conditions are met: 
6.12.1.  The reduced instructions do not permit aircraft to cross any runway(s). 
6.12.2.  The required operational risk assessment has been accomplished. 
6.12.3.  The procedures are clearly defined in a base AOI and only in a LOP by exception. 
6.12.4.  The procedures are MAJCOM reviewed/coordinated prior to implementation.

6.12.5.  PHRASEOLOGY:  “(AIRCRAFT IDENTIFICATION (ACID)) RUNWAY (NUMBER) 
TAXI VIA (STR NAME).” 
6.12.5.1.  Example 1: “ZORO01 RUNWAY THREE SIX LEFT TAXI VIA TEXAN ONE.” 
6.12.5.2.  Example 2: “ZORO01 RUNWAY THREE SIX LEFT TAXI VIA TEXAN ONE, 
HOLD SHORT RUNWAY THREE SIX RIGHT.” 
6.13.  Visual Separation.  As defined in the Aeronautical Information Manual, a pilot’s 
acceptance of instructions to follow another aircraft or provide visual separation from it is an 
acknowledgment that the pilot will maneuver the aircraft as necessary to avoid the other aircraft 
or to maintain in−trail separation.  Additionally, in operations conducted behind heavy aircraft, or 
a small aircraft behind a B757 or other large aircraft, it is also an acknowledgment that the pilot 
accepts the responsibility for wake turbulence separation.  Visual separation is prohibited behind 
super aircraft. Note: When a pilot has been told to follow another aircraft or to provide visual 
separation from it, the pilot should promptly notify the controller if visual contact with the other 
aircraft is lost or cannot be maintained or if the pilot cannot accept the responsibility for the 
separation for any reason.

RADAR OPERATIONS 
7.1.  Radar Use. 
7.1.1.  Air Force ATC radar systems may be used for: 
7.1.1.1.  Surveillance of aircraft to assure the effective use of airspace. 
7.1.1.2.  Vectoring aircraft to provide separation and radar navigation. 
7.1.1.3.  Vectoring aircraft to final approach. 
7.1.1.4.  Vectoring aircraft to the airport of intended landing. 
7.1.1.5.  Monitoring instrument approaches. 
7.1.1.6.  Providing assistance to pilots of aircraft in distress. 
7.1.1.7.  Conducting precision or surveillance approaches. 
7.1.1.8.  Air Base Defense.  Note: If a requirement exists, terminal ATC radar facilities 
may perform radar surveillance functions to support early warning or ensure the safe 
passage of friendly aircraft.  If the terminal ATC radar is used for this requirement, the 
CCTLR must describe controller priorities, procedures, coordination requirements, and 
areas of responsibilities in a LOP. (T-2) 
7.1.1.9.  STARS facility CCTLRs must determine the need to use or not use the satellite 
airport database feature containing emergency airport data. (T-0)  If this feature is used, 
the NAAM or qualified automation personnel, must ensure validation to ensure correct 
data is contained in the STARS system. (T-2)  The CCTLR must include applicable 
procedures in facility OI. (T-2)  Note: Ready reference files (RRF) may be used as a 
supplement for the STARS satellite airport database. 
7.1.1.9.1.  STARS facility CCTLRs must develop alternate procedures to advise pilots 
the satellite airport database is unverified if the automation personnel have not 
completed the verification process by the 10th day of each month in a facility OI. (T-0)  
CCTLRs must ensure procedures include the phrase below. (T-0)  Note: Due to the 
inability to verify or receive real-time airport data at uncontrolled airports, these 
airports should be considered unverified at all times.  PHRASEOLOGY: “AIRPORT 
DATA UNVERIFIED.” 
7.1.1.9.2.  If STARS facility CCTLR determines the STARS satellite airport database 
will not be used, state restrictions in facility OI. (T-2)  
7.1.2.  A facility may remote a radar operated by non-ATC agencies and use the radar for ATC 
purposes if the radar is satisfactorily flight checked according to AFMAN 11-225_IP, U.S. 
Standard Flight Inspection Manual.  The CCTLR must ensure a LOA or MOU is in place to 
ensure the non-ATC agency does not alter radar information furnished to the ATC facility 
without prior notification. (T-1) 
7.1.3.  A controller provides radar service when they have a usable target and determine that 
presentation and equipment performance are satisfactory.  STARS will only display a target if 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
61 
the system determines the target to be usable.  Additionally targets are not considered usable 
in the following scenarios at a minimum: 
7.1.3.1.  The data block displays “TRK II.” 
7.1.3.2.  The data block displays “CST” for 15 seconds or more. 
7.1.4.  STARS Handoff Function. 
7.1.4.1.  STARS facilities must be adapted to retain aural CA/LA alarms for tracks at the 
sending position after handoff while the track remains in the “owned color.”  In this 
configuration, the aural alarms will stop when the track is slewed and changed to the 
“unowned color.” 
7.1.4.2.  Radar CCTLRs will establish procedures in an OI specifying when controllers 
may slew a handed off track to ensure aural CA/LA alarms are received. (T-2) 
7.2.  Radar Reflectors for Precision Approach Radar (PAR). 
7.2.1.  The outage of one bracketing reflector, or the outage of the centerline reflector when a 
single centerline reflector is being used, does not make the PAR unusable provided a suitable 
alternate method of runway centerline reference is available (e.g., approach lights, runway 
lights, barrier poles).  CCTLRs must determine which returns to use as a temporary 
replacement for the bracketing reflectors in a facility OI. (T-2)  Verify accuracy of the alternate 
references through local or formal flight inspection.  After flight check determines accuracy, 
the CCTLR must publish guidance for use in a facility directive. (T-2)  
7.2.2.  The outage of any one of the moving target indicator (MTI) reflectors (refer to the 
appropriate technical order for the minimum number required) makes the PAR unusable in the 
MTI mode. 
7.2.3.  The AN/GPN-22 and AN/TPN-25 do not use bracketing or touchdown reflectors; they 
rely on track reflectors to monitor track accuracy for each runway served.  The PAR is unusable 
for a given runway if the system cannot track the corresponding reference reflector.  If this 
condition occurs, the systems will flat-line the glideslope cursor.  If the system can track the 
reference reflector, but the controller cannot view or manipulate track symbols, the system may 
still be used in the scan-only mode if the system is flight checked and procedures are detailed 
in local directives. 
7.3.  Radar Glide Path and Course Information.  Use the center of the radar target (track 
symbol) for phased array PAR to determine when an aircraft exceeds the PAR safety limits.  Use 
minimum gain to provide the most accurate position information. 
7.3.1.  The AN/GPN-22 and AN/TPN-25 use a computer tracking system.  Local conditions 
and equipment performance may limit the use of this equipment to control aircraft without the 
aid of the tracking system (scan mode only).  Commissioning and periodic flight inspections 
of these radar systems will identify their capabilities and limitations. 
7.3.2.  During temporary loss or non-availability of the tracking symbology, and the controller 
can verify the radar is otherwise operating normally, the controller may use scan-only video to 
conduct radar approaches provided limitations and procedures are published in a LOP. 
62 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
7.4.  PAR Safety Zones. 
7.4.1.  PAR Lower Safety Limit Zone.  A PAR lower safety limit path ("B" cursor) originates 
between the end of the runway and a point not closer than 500 feet before the runway point of 
intercept (RPI) of the glide path.  Where possible, "B" cursor origin should be at least 250 feet 
from the runway end.  That area between the "B" cursor and the glide path is the safety zone. 
7.4.1.1.  The "B" cursor extends upward at an angle one-half (0.5) of a degree lower than 
the commissioned glide path angle, and ends at an altitude of 250 feet below the established 
glide path intercept altitude. 
7.4.1.2.  At some locations, the length of the “B” cursor differs because of differences in 
glide path angles or intercepts altitudes for the two runways.  When this occurs, use the 
longer "B" cursor length (termination point below the glide path).  Using the common "B" 
cursor expedites use of PAR by reducing maintenance adjustments after a runway change 
and equipment turnaround. 
7.4.1.3.  The AN/GPN-22 "B" cursor extends to the length of the "A" cursor.  However, 
safety limits apply for go-around instructions only between the point on the "B" cursor 250 
feet below the established glide path intercept altitude and the normal termination point of 
the approach. 
7.4.1.4.  A dashed electronic cursor displays the "B" cursor on the elevation portion of the 
PAR scope for each precision approach.  If an equipment malfunction prevents display of 
the cursor, a suitable substitute may identify the lower safety limit zone. 
7.4.2.  PAR Upper Safety Limit Zone.  This zone is above the glide path.  Its dimensions are 
the same as those established for the lower zone.  The upper safety limit path starts at a point 
in space above the glide path and has the same geometrical relationship to the glide path as the 
lower path.  The upper path rises at an angle one-half (0.5) of a degree greater than the 
commissioned glide path angle.  There is no requirement to display the upper path on the scope. 
7.4.3.  PAR Lateral Safety Limits.  These limits refer to distances on the azimuth portion of 
the PAR scope.  There is no requirement to display lateral safety zone limits on the radarscope; 
however, the CCTLR must ensure a drawing or table depicting lateral safe limits must be 
available at each PAR position. (T-2)  Table 7.1. Specifies PAR lateral safety limits and 
approximate displacement distances.  The displacement distances are averages and actual 
distances will vary.  Displacement distances for scan type radar are based on a maximum 
display range of 9 miles.  The displacement relationship remains constant for tracking type 
radar, regardless of the display range selected (8, 15, or 20 miles).  Use these distances as a 
guide for interpreting the precision radar displays. 
7.5.  Decision Height (DH).  Mark the DH on the PAR azimuth-elevation zone paths that 
represent the height above threshold elevation approved for the runway in use.  Use grease pencil 
or fluorescent-gummed cellophane tape to display the DH if not electronically displayed (Not 
applicable to GPN-22).  Display only the DH for the runway in use (reference Figure 7.2.).

7.6.  Use of Precision Approach Radar (PAR). 
7.6.1.  A radar final controller must not accept more than one aircraft or flight conducting a 
PAR or ASR approach. (T-1)  Note: A standard formation flight conducting a PAR or ASR 
approach will not exceed two aircraft. (T-1) 
7.6.2.  Monitor Instrument Final Approach Courses. 
7.6.2.1.  To use PAR to monitor non-radar instrument approach courses, the PAR RPI must 
be within 250 feet of the ILS, and the commissioned flight check angle of the PAR must 
be within two-tenths of a degree of the ILS commissioned glide slope angle.  Additionally, 
the PAR final approach course must coincide with the NAVAID final approach course 
from the final approach fix to the runway.  Where the capability exists, the OG/CC must 
determine if there is a requirement to monitor approaches at their locations in a LOP. (T-3)  
7.6.2.2.  A radar final controller must not monitor more than four aircraft. (T-1)  If units 
choose to monitor approaches using the PAR equipment, one of the following conditions 
must exist: 
7.6.2.2.1.  The official weather is below basic VFR minima (1,000-foot ceiling and/or 
3 miles visibility). (T-3) 
7.6.2.2.2.  At night. (T-3) 
7.6.2.2.3.  Upon request of the pilot. (T-3) 
7.6.2.3.  Where PAR serves a runway that has an ILS or visual glide slope indicator, the 
glide path, glide-slope angles RPIs should coincide.  An official flight inspection must 
determine coincidence.  Where PAR, ILS, and visual glide slope indicators are not 
coincident, 
publish 
the 
deviation 
in 
the 
IFR 
Supplement 
available 
at: 
https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/.  For example: 
Runway (RWY) 30-PAR, ILS, and Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) glide-slopes 
are not coincidental. 
7.6.2.4.  When the mission warrants simultaneous approach monitoring, the CCTLR must 
outline procedures in a LOP. (T-3)  
7.6.2.5.  PAR Associated Equipment Requirements.  The CCTLR must ensure a readily 
observable and operational ASR display is available in the operations room at facilities 
providing PAR only service. (T-3)  At locations where ASR displays are not available, a 
CTRD maintenance monitor or television slaved from the tower CTRD meets the 
requirement.  The ASR display will aid controllers during radar hand-offs between 
approach control and PAR.  When the ASR display is out of service, PAR services may 
continue if the CCTLR establishes procedures in a LOP. (T-3)  
7.6.2.6.  Turn-around procedures.  CCTLRs must establish a LOP for notification of 
personnel working in or around radar units during turn-around operations. (T-3)  
7.7.  Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) Approach Procedures. 
7.7.1.  The CCTLR must ensure an adequate reference to the runway centerline must be 
available on the ASR indicator. (T-3)  The video map is an adequate reference when the 
commissioning flight check establishes permanent echoes or targets.  CCTLRs must ensure 
facilities without a video map have alignment reflectors to verify course accuracy. (T-3)  Use 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
65 
two runway bracket reflectors or a centerline runway reflector to verify alignment of an overlay 
(if available), cursor or compass grid line for ASR approaches.  MTI reflectors must be 
operational when conducting ASR approaches using MTI radar when video maps are not 
available or when using MTI to determine runway centerline reference. (T-3)  
7.7.2.  CCTLRs must ensure facilities use a video map to depict the extended runway 
centerline. (T-3)  A map overlay (if available) may be used during map outages. 
7.7.3.  There is no requirement for bracketing reflectors or a video map to provide ASR 
approaches using the AN/TPN-19.  The systems fixed, displayed runway cursor is based on a 
set geographic location in relation to the ASR antenna and meets reflector, video map, and 
cursor requirements. 
7.7.4.  CCTLRs must ensure recommended altitudes for ASR approaches must be developed 
according to AFMAN 11-230 and be immediately available at each RFC position and ASR 
indicators. (T-0)  
7.8.  Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS). 
7.8.1.  CCTLRs at STARS locations will establish procedures in an LOP or Letter of 
Instruction (LOI) in the event of radar feed failures. (T-2)  Guidance will include WS actions 
for maintenance notification and STARS keyboard entries located in FAA TI 
6191.409/6191.410 (available on the STARS maintenance laptop) to exclude false radar track 
data to prevent false target returns. (T-2) 
7.8.2.  CCTLRs will establish coordination procedures with RAWS maintenance personnel to 
determine realistic response times and maintenance actions in a facility OI, LOP, or LOI. (T-3) 
7.9.  Radar Performance Checks.  Each radar controller is responsible for determining, on a 
continuous basis, if the quality of their radar display and video fix accuracy is satisfactory for ATC 
purposes. 
7.9.1.  CCTLRs must develop procedures to ensure the radar performance check is 
accomplished at least once each shift for non-STARS locations. (T-3)  
7.9.2.  Radar quality and performance are determined by comparing identified targets against 
data obtained during the commissioning flight check.  Minimum performance criteria may be 
determined jointly by maintenance and the CCTLR. 
7.9.3.  Targets used for comparison checks should be generated by small aircraft, similar in 
size to those used during the commissioning flight check. 
7.9.4.  CCTLRs, at locations that use multi-site sensors/radars, must ensure each radar sensor 
used provides adequate radar and altitude coverage for the type of operations the sensor will 
be used for. (T-3)  
7.9.5.  Automated ATC narrow-band radar systems must not be used for operational purposes 
unless they are operationally validated (certified) by RAWS maintenance personnel. (T-3)  
Non- validated radar sensors (e.g., failed or out of tolerance) must be inhibited from the system 
until validated for use.  The WS must ensure an entry is made on DAF Form 3616 when the 
digitized radar system is validated for operational use and/or when a non-validated radar sensor 
is inhibited or restored to the operational system. (T-3)  Note: These procedures are not 
66 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
intended to be used during normal opening/shift change checklists, but are used when 
certifying or re-entering into service a radar system that was removed from service. 
7.9.6.  Optimum Antenna Tilt.  Operate deployable mobile radar systems, with variable 
antenna tilt capability, at the tilt angle prescribed by the commissioning flight check or data 
incorporated into the most recent ATCALS Evaluation Report. 
7.10.  Surveillance Antenna Operation in High Wind.  Allow the antenna to free wheel 
whenever the forecasted/current wind exceeds the maximum defined in the system-specific 
technical orders and ATC conditions permit.  CCTLRs must define maintenance notification 
procedures, and define who is responsible for placing the antenna in the free-wheel mode in a LOP. 
(T-3)  
7.11.  Diverse Vector Area (DVA).  The CCTLR must coordinate with TERPS and establish a 
DVA (reference FAAO JO 7110.65AA, Chapter 5 and AFMAN 11-230) before aircraft may be 
vectored below the MVA or minimum IFR altitude (MIA) while aircraft are executing a departure 
and/or climb-out instructions. (T-0)  A DVA provides separation from obstacles according to 
TERPS diverse departure criteria.  Note: Free vector areas are areas within a DVA in which 
random vectoring below the MVA or MIA is authorized. 
7.11.1.  When a DVA is established, CCTLRs must include the following in the facility OI: 
7.11.1.1.  A complete description of the DVA, to include any restrictions and/or free 
vectoring areas. (T-0) 
7.11.1.2.  Procedures for radar vectoring IFR departures below the MVA/MIA and within 
3-5 NM of an obstacle, as applicable. (T-0) 
7.11.2.  Depict sectors (areas) and/or radar routes/corridors within which radar vectors are 
provided. (T-0) 
7.11.3.  Restrictions to a DVA must be incorporated in accordance with AFMAN 11-230. 
(T-1)  
7.11.4.  For climb gradients in excess of 200 feet per nautical mile (FPNM), controllers must 
issue the specific climb gradient and obtain pilot concurrence prior to providing ATC 
navigational guidance on departure. (T-2)  Exception: For Obstacle Departure Procedures 
(ODP) and Standard Instrument Departure (SID) procedures, ATC personnel are not required 
to issue climb gradients in excess of 200 FPNM when the required climb gradient is published. 
7.12.  Designation of Sectors.  CCTLR develops airspace sectors based on predominant traffic 
flows, altitude strata, and controller workload.  When sectorization is in a facility OI, the CCTLR 
must ensure no two controllers provide service or advisories in the same airspace. (T-2) 
7.13.  Radar Equipment Requirements.  Appropriate to assigned mission functions, the CCTLR 
must ensure a radar approach control or other terminal radar ATC facility has the following 
equipment: 
7.13.1.  Flight Progress Boards. (T-2) 
7.13.2.  RVR equipment (for locations with CAT II/III ILS). (T-2) 
7.13.3.  A landline system that includes an intercom between positions within the facility. 
(T-2) 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
67 
7.13.4.  A radar display. (T-2) Note: Refer to Attachment 8 for applicable radar alignment 
procedures. 
7.13.5.  Radio receiver and transmitter controls, and consoles. (T-2) 
7.13.6.  Weather dissemination and display equipment. (T-2) 
7.13.7.  NAVAID remote status indicators or remote control status unit (where applicable). 
(T-2) 
7.13.8.  Voice recorders and an adequate supply of recordable data media. (T-2) 
7.13.9.  Wind direction and speed indicators. (T-2) 
7.13.10.  Flight Data System (FDS), with a collocated clearance delivery position that has 
independent communications. (T-2) 
7.13.11.  Coordinator positions.  Authorize independent Coordinator positions when necessary 
due to traffic complexity. (T-2) 
7.13.12.  Secondary radar system. (T-2) 
7.13.13.  Video mapper. (T-2) 
7.13.14.  Battery operated emergency lighting systems or flashlights. (T-2) 
7.13.15.  UHF and VHF emergency alternate radio system. (T-2) 
7.13.16.  Dedicated communications for tower/radar coordination (e.g., landline, shout          
line). (T-2) 
7.13.17.  Automated Radar Tracking System (e.g., STARS, MEARTS, ARTS 3/A). (T-2) 
7.13.18.  Headsets. (T-2)  
7.14.  Non-Radar Board.  Not applicable to locations that do not provide non-radar services. The 
CCTLR must ensure each radar facility (RFC excluded) maintains and utilizes a current facility 
developed non-radar board. (T-2)  CCTLRs must coordinate non-radar board information annually 
with TERPS personnel and develop the non-radar board. (T-2)  The following items should be 
included, but are not limited to: 
7.14.1.  Transfer of control points. 
7.14.2.  GPS coordinates (Latitude/Longitude) for significant points. 
7.14.3.  Diverging radials table. 
7.14.4.  Holding patterns (include applicable altitudes and maximum holding airspeed). 
7.14.5.  Available NAVAIDS. 
7.14.6.  Minimum IFR Altitude Chart. 
7.15.  FAA/Air Force Contingency Plan Agreements.  The purpose of an FAA Parent Facility 
Contingency Plan, developed according to FAAO JO 1900.47F, is to mitigate impact to the NAS 
in the event of an ATC facility’s loss of ability to provide ATC services.  In the event of a 
contingency involving equipment failure, the plan should address support between Air Force and 
FAA approach control facilities to assume services as much as feasible.  These agreements should 
also address requirements for FAA assumption of Air Force facility airspace, in the event of a 
68 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
temporary facility closure or to temporarily curtail operating hours (e.g., deployments or critical 
staffing levels). 
7.15.1.  The Air Traffic services contingency plan authority is an agreement authorizing inter-
facility cooperation to proceed with the contingency plan development.  For Air Force 
locations, the OG/CC must sign these agreements in lieu of the Air Traffic (AT) manager. 
(T-0)  
7.15.2.  The support facility Operational Capability Level (OCL) procedures should 
encompass each support facility's OCL site-specific procedures, contain customized checklists 
and detailed data or procedures necessary to activate and support the parent facility 
contingency plan. 
7.15.2.1.  The information contained in section 3 of the OCL procedures should incorporate 
a checklist tailored to each individual facility.  Include detailed procedures (including non-
radar, if required) for departures, arrivals, and enroute operations to/from the terminal area, 
adjacent areas and inter-facility coordination required to accomplish these actions. 
7.15.2.2.  The section labeled Information and/or Actions common to all facilities may 
contain general guidance that all facilities need in case of the parent facility's OCL 
declaration.  Outline procedures for reporting to the Air Traffic Control System Command 
Center when the transfer control of airspace has been stabilized. 
7.15.2.3.  Each procedures document contains administrative and operational data 
attachments needed to activate the contingency plan.  Attachments include: 
7.15.2.3.1.  Map of Assets.  The geographical depiction of physical assets and 
frequency service volumes and is used as a tool for developing airspace divestment 
charts. 
7.15.2.3.2.  Data Tables.  Ensure this contains specific telephone, frequency, 
navigational facilities and other similar types of physical assets. 
7.15.2.3.3.  Airspace Divestment Charts.  The geographical depiction of airspace 
delegation derived from parent and support facility map of assets. 
7.15.2.4.  Additional attachments including maps depicting departure and arrival routes are 
permitted, as long as detailed procedures are outlined within the actual plan (Section 3).  
Ensure requirements within Section 3 and the attachment match. 
7.15.2.5.  Other important areas to include are: 
7.15.2.5.1.  Facility Operating Hours (e.g., when will facilities not be available to 
participate in the contingency plan). 
7.15.2.5.2.  The number of days the facility can sustain continuous operations (24-
hours, 7-days per week) before augmentation is required. 
7.15.2.5.3.  A statement that Air Force air traffic controllers are deployable assets and 
can be deployed at any time, affecting the terms of the agreement. 
7.15.2.5.4.  Limitations of equipment (e.g., radar and radio coverage, control positions 
available, if any, and options for parent facility controllers to augment Air Force 
staffing, and accepted impact on routine services). 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
69 
7.15.2.5.5.  Due to the uncertainties regarding automation capabilities, facilities should 
address the use of automated inter-facility handoff procedures and/or the use of manual 
handoff until automation capabilities are verified. 
7.15.2.5.6.  CCTLRs must forward proposed support facility authority and support 
facility OCL procedures to MAJCOM for approval prior to implementation. (T-2)  The 
request for approval must be signed by the OG/CC (or equivalent) and must contain 
one of the following statements: 
7.15.2.5.6.1.  Draft requirements (if approved) can be accomplished within existing 
resources. (T-2) 
7.15.2.5.6.2.  Additional (e.g., personnel, equipment, funds) resources that are 
necessary. (T-2) 
7.15.2.5.6.3.  A mission impact statement (e.g., operational efficiency, aircraft 
movement, aircraft training). (T-2) 
7.15.3.  Do not enter into the plan if: 
7.15.3.1.  The support facility agreement is not written to a level that stands alone and 
provides the tools to transition to/from the contingency plan. 
7.15.3.2.  Entering into an agreement requires additional equipment or manpower that the 
facility is not funded for or currently does not have available.  Air Force units may support 
more than one parent facility (e.g., an approach control could support two separate ARTCC 
facilities, or two Air Force RAPCON facilities could mutually support a single ARTCC 
facility).  Units must use caution when entering into more than one support facility 
agreement.  The CCTLR must ensure support responsibilities do not overlap or override 
another plan in addition to units acting as a support facility. (T-0)  
7.16.  AN/TPX-42 Strapping.  For use in deployed locations on applicable equipment.  Normally 
strap the AN/TPX-42 1,000' higher than the transition altitude.  The negative 1,000' altitude factor 
applied between the point of strapping and the point of applying local altimeter correction is an 
inherent part of the signal-processing chain.  At locations with low transition altitudes (below 
10,000'), strap the AN/TPX-42 2,000' above the transition altitude.  This will reduce the number 
of incorrect altitude read-outs below the transition altitude during periods of low altimeter settings. 
7.16.1.  Do not use AN/TPX-42 altitude read-outs for separation between the transition altitude 
and the transition level.  During periods of low altimeter settings (between 28.92 and 27.92), 
altitude read-outs may be unreliable at altitudes within 1,000’ below the transition altitude. 
7.17.  AN/TPX-49A  Range Azimuth Beacon Monitor (RABM).  For use in deployed locations 
on applicable equipment. 
7.17.1.  CCTLRs must provide written guidance for equipment checks and beacon range 
accuracy verification during: 
7.17.1.1.  Temporary primary radar outage conditions. (T-3)  
7.17.1.2.  Secondary radar service is provided outside the coverage of primary radar. (T-3)  
7.17.2.  Continually display the target to verify system accuracy whenever primary radar is 
inoperative and secondary radar is in use.  If using a code other than 6666, controllers must 
70 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
ensure maintenance sets the displayed altitude to greater than 60,000 feet (Flight Level 600) to 
prevent erroneous traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) alerts to TCAS-
equipped aircraft. (T-3) 
7.17.3.  Beacon targets may be displaced at a slightly greater range than their respective 
primary returns when desirable and equipment supports this function.  Issue a facility directive 
specifying the standard relationship between primary returns and the beacon control slash of 
secondary returns when beacon displacement is elected.  The maximum allowable 
displacement is 1/2 mile applied in 1/4-mile increments. 
7.17.4.  Continually display the target to verify system accuracy when secondary radar service 
is provided outside the coverage of primary radar.

Chapter 8 
SPECIAL OPERATIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL PROCEDURES 
8.1.  Exercises.  The WS must ensure ATC facility participation does not degrade services. (T-3)  
The WS may interrupt or discontinue facility participation in any exercise if flight safety is in 
question or participation interferes with the recovery of emergency aircraft.  The WS may direct 
use of the simulator for inspection purposes.  ATC personnel may wear gas masks in support of 
exercises and inspections consistent with wing requirements, provided a non-masked safety 
observer is present.  The safety observer must be facility rated and cannot be assigned to any 
position other than WS. (T-3)  The safety observer must have the authority to direct controllers to 
remove gas masks in the interest of flight safety. (T-3)  When an aircraft declares an emergency 
or is in distress, controllers in direct communications with the aircraft must remove the gas mask. 
(T-3) 
8.2.  Supervisor of Flying (SOF).  When the SOF performs duties in an ATC facility, the CCTLR 
must describe details in a LOP. (T-3)  When advice is extremely technical, or when the SOF feels 
that relay of information by the controller could cause an unacceptable delay, the SOF must 
coordinate with the WS prior to using an ATC frequency to transmit directly to the affected 
aircraft. (T-2)  Instructions should be limited to preventing a mishap.  The SOF must not perform 
ATC functions or transmit ATC instructions or clearances to an aircraft. (T-2)  A person who 
commandeers an ATC frequency assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft. 
8.3.  Aircraft Priorities.  CCTLRs must ensure that locally developed operational priorities do 
not take precedence over priorities listed in FAAO JO 7110.65AA, Chapter 2, Section 1. (T-0) 
8.4.  Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS).  Headquarters Air Force Flight Standards 
Agency delegates responsibility for establishing RSRS criteria to major command operations 
(MAJCOM/A3) OPR’s for their specific commands. 
8.4.1.  RSRS criteria is based on aircraft characteristics, aircrew training requirements and the 
responsible air traffic controllers’ ability to ensure application of established separation. 
8.4.2.  The CCTLR must ensure application of RSRS is outlined in either the base airfield 
operations instruction or a Wing operations letter, and approved by the MAJCOM prior to 
implementation. (T-2)  
8.5.  Radar-in-Trail Recovery.  Radar-in-trail recovery procedures must be coordinated through 
the AOF/CC, Operations Group (and host nation, if required), reviewed/coordinated with the 
MAJCOM, and detailed in the AOI. (T-2)  If the FAA provides approach control services, the 
CCTLR must ensure procedures are contained in an LOA and signed by all appropriate individuals. 
(T-2)  CCTLRs must ensure procedures address the following: 
8.5.1.  Recovery procedures and notification requirements (to include flight lead coordination 
of trail recovery with ATC prior to taking spacing). (T-2) 
8.5.2.  Missed approach/break-out/go-around procedures. (T-2) 
8.5.3.  Lost communications procedures. (T-2) 
8.5.4.  Spacing requirement within/between flights. (T-2) 
8.5.5.  Radar-in-trail recoveries must not terminate in PAR or ASR approaches. (T-2) 
72 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
8.5.6.  Radar-in-trail recovery is limited to a maximum of four aircraft. (T-2) 
8.5.7.  Aircrews conducting radar-in-trail recoveries are responsible for their own separation 
between elements of their flight while on final for full-stop landings.  To ensure appropriate 
departure separation, multiple practice radar in-trail approaches that do not terminate with a 
full-stop landing must be conducted only in visual meteorological conditions (VMC).  During 
practice approaches in VMC conditions, after an executed low approach/landing, the flight is 
responsible for their own separation until ATC initiates flight split-ups for individual control. 
(T-2) 
8.6.  Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft.  FAAO JO 7610.4W, Special Operations, and AFI 13-207, 
Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking), provide guidance regarding unlawful 
seizure of aircraft.  CCTLRs must ensure a LOP defines the base response to hijack or theft 
attempts and coordinate with the AOF/CC to identify a single base agency to receive ATC 
notification. (T-2)  In addition to procedures mandated in FAAO JO 7610.4W and host nation 
documents, and described in ICAO Annexes, tower controller responsibilities include, but are not 
limited to: 
8.6.1.  Immediately activating the primary crash alarm system, or notification via landline. 
8.6.2.  Issuing current position information to fire/crash, security police, and base rescue. 
8.6.3.  Assisting the on-scene commander by forwarding updated information and relaying any 
orders or instructions. 
8.7.  Min-Comm/Comm-Out.  CCTLRs must ensure that departure/inbound procedures for 
minimum-communications and communications-out operations are established in the AOI and 
require MAJCOM review/coordination prior to implementation. (T-2)  CCTLRS must ensure 
procedures that task or involve the FAA are defined in an LOA. (T-2)  
8.8.  Night Vision Device (NVD) Use in Terminal Airspace. 
8.8.1.  CCTLRs must develop procedures to ensure NVDs are only used as an aid for 
controllers to assist in maintaining air traffic situation awareness and airfield surveillance 
during periods of aircraft operations at airfields with reduced lighting configurations. (T-2)  
8.8.2.  CCTLRS must ensure NVD tasks are identified on AF Form 797, with applicable 
Technical References (TR). (T-3)  Include tasks that reflect use of associated equipment. 
8.9.  Explosives Detection K-9 Teams. 
8.9.1.  CONUS Locations, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam.  During emergency situations, and with 
the concurrence of base officials, military installations with explosives detection K-9 teams 
should advise the pilot that such service is available.  CCTLRs will ensure procedures are 
outlined in a facility checklist. (T-2)  Controllers must take the following action should they 
receive an aircraft request for the location of the nearest explosives detection K-9 team: 
8.9.1.1.  At military locations without an explosives detection K-9 tem, relay the pilot’s 
request to the FAA Washington Operations Center, AEO-100, telephone: commercial 
(202) 267-3333 or DSN 851-3750 providing the aircraft’s identification and position. (T-1) 
8.9.1.2.  Relay the nearest location to the pilot as directed by AEO-100 and keep AEO-100 
on the line. (T-1) 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
73 
8.9.1.3.  After it has been determined that the aircraft wishes to divert to the airport location 
provided, the air traffic facility will ascertain estimated arrival time and advise AEO−100. 
(T-1)  AEO−100 will then notify the appropriate airport authority at the diversion airport. 
(T-1)  In the event the K−9 team is not available at this airport, AEO−100 will relay this 
information to the air traffic facility providing them with the secondary location. (T-1)  
ATC will then relay this to the pilot concerned for appropriate action. (T-1) 
8.9.2.  Host Nation Locations.  Controllers receiving a request from a military or civil aircraft 
must take action according to local resource protection plans and guidance received from local 
military authorities in accordance with host nation agreements. (T-0)  
8.10.  Parachute Jump Operations. 
8.10.1.  CCTLRS must define operational/procedural needs to conduct parachute jump 
operations in a LOP with parachute jump organizations or responsible individuals. (T-2) 
CCTLRs must ensure at a minimum, the LOP should contain: 
8.10.1.1.  The description and the location of the drop zone(s) and the conditions of use. 
(T-2)  
8.10.1.2.  The activity schedules. (T-2)  
8.10.1.3.  The maximum jump altitudes (Mean Sea Level). (T-2)  
8.10.1.4.  Notification procedures. (T-2)  
8.10.1.5.  Any other items pertinent to the needs of the ATC system and the users. (T-2)  
8.10.2.  Areas designated as permanent jump sites in a LOP may be used repeatedly to 
minimize coordination.  Specific authorization or notification is still required, but not 
necessarily for each jump. 
8.10.3.  To the max extent possible, advise parachute jumping organizations or responsible 
individuals of known high traffic density areas or other airspace where parachuting may 
adversely impact system efficiency, such as IFR departure/arrival routes, airways, VFR 
flyways, military training routes. 
8.11.  Prohibited or Restricted Areas.  Application of the separation prescribed in FAAO JO 
7110.65AA is not considered necessary whenever the prohibited or restricted airspace does not 
contain aircraft operations because these areas typically provide an internal buffer based upon the 
exact type of activity taking place.  In addition, instrument procedures protected areas cannot 
violate or penetrate SUA without meeting criteria established in AFMAN 11-230.  In making a 
determination to exempt specific areas, CCTLRs must be guided by the following: 
8.11.1.  Determine the exact nature of prohibited/restricted area utilization through direct 
liaison with the using agency. (T-0) 
8.11.2.  Coordinate with MAJCOM OPR for ATC during the analysis of area utilization. (T-0) 
8.11.3.  The following types of activity are examples of restricted area utilization which often 
will not require application of separation minima: 
8.11.3.1.  Explosives detonation. (T-0) 
8.11.3.2.  Ground firing of various types. (T-0) 
74 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
8.11.3.3.  Drone and other unmanned aircraft flight operations. (T-0) 
8.11.3.4.  Aircraft operations associated with the above in a safety, observer, or command 
and control capacity only; e.g., the aircraft is not directly engaging in activity for which the 
airspace was designated and is operating under VFR. (T-0) 
8.11.4.  If area utilization varies between aircraft operations and other types of activity as 
described above, do not exempt the area from separation requirements unless a significant 
operational advantage can be obtained. (T-0) 
8.11.5.  Restricted airspace with the same number but different letter suffixes is considered to 
be separate restricted areas.  Units may treat these types as one restricted area for the purpose 
of identifying areas for exemption from separation requirements to simplify application of 
separation minima unless a significant operational advantage can be obtained. (T-0) 
8.12.  Domestic Events Network (DEN) Reporting Requirements. 
8.12.1.  Purpose.  Elevated security-related issues mandate the need for all CONUS ATC 
facilities to report security incidents to the DEN.  The purpose of the DEN is to provide timely 
notification to the appropriate authority that there is an emerging air or ground related problem 
or incident involving the NAS.  The DEN is a 24/7 FAA sponsored telephonic conference call 
network (recorded) that includes all of the air route traffic control centers (ARTCC) in the 
United States.  It also includes various other governmental agencies that monitor the DEN for 
situational awareness. 
8.12.2.  Participation on the DEN.  There are specific times in which ARTCCs, ATC facilities 
in the National Capital Region (NCR), approach control facilities, and towers are automatically 
required to participate on the DEN.  If the ATC facility is not actively monitoring the DEN or 
does not have a dedicated line to the DEN, immediately report activities on the DEN via 844-
432-2962 (toll free).  If this number is out of service, alternate numbers for the DEN are 405-
225-2444 or 844-663-9723 (toll free).  CCTLRs may coordinate with local RAWS teams to 
have the DEN programmed onto the ETVS, as necessary. 
8.12.3.  Military Specific (MILSPEC) Operations.  The purpose of the DEN is to share 
information with all concerned parties, and this should be weighed against MILSPEC 
requirements.  CCTLRs should conduct an annual review of local Operations Plans 
(OPLANS), Installation Emergency Management Plans (IEMPS), etc., and coordinate with 
installation law enforcement agencies (Security Forces (SF), Office of Special Investigations 
(OSI), etc.) and Command Post, to determine current installation reporting and, as applicable, 
when and/or what activities should NOT be reported via the DEN. 
8.12.4.  Procedures.  The reporting of security issues that affect the NAS are contained in 
multiple FAAOs not listed here (i.e., FAAO JO 7110.65AA & FAAO JO 7610.4W).  This 
compiled listing is not all-inclusive and ATC personnel should use good judgement and report 
any event that might be a security related issue.  This document identifies many events which 
are mandatory to be reported to the DEN when operating within the NAS (follow Host Nation 
policies and procedures when operating outside of the NAS).  The WS will annotate all DEN 
notifications with pertinent details on the DAF Form 3616. (T-2) 
8.12.4.1.  Suspicious Activity.  It is not possible to develop a comprehensive list of all 
possible suspicious activities, so it is incumbent upon ATC personnel to use good 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
75 
judgement in reporting possible security related events.  A brief listing of examples of 
suspicious activity which must be reported to the DEN can be found in FAAO JO 7610.4W, 
para 7-3-1. 
8.12.4.2.  Hijack.  Situations where a hijack or suspicious activity exists or is imminent, or 
is believed to exist or be imminent, must be reported to the DEN. (T-0)  
8.12.4.3.  Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS).  ATC facilities must report 
any MANPADS threat to the DEN. (T-1) 
8.12.4.4.  Unauthorized Laser Illumination.  ATC must report unauthorized laser 
illumination to SF or Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), and the DEN. 
(T-1)  The following items will be included for each incident when reporting to the DEN 
and when inputting on DAF Form 3616: 
8.12.4.4.1.  UTC date and time of event. (T-1) 
8.12.4.4.2.  Call Sign, or aircraft registration number. (T-1) 
8.12.4.4.3.  Type of aircraft. (T-1) 
8.12.4.4.4.  Nearest major city. (T-1) 
8.12.4.4.5.  Altitude. (T-1) 
8.12.4.4.6.  Location of event (e.g., latitude and longitude and/or Fixed Radial Distance  
[FRD]). (T-1) 
8.12.4.4.7.  Brief description of the event. (T-1) 
8.12.4.4.8.  Any other pertinent information. (T-1) 
8.12.4.4.9.  Law enforcement contact information. (T-1) 
8.12.4.5.  GPS Interference Missions.  The ATC facility directing a “Stop Buzzer” call will 
notify the DEN that the procedure was invoked. (T-1) 
8.12.4.6.  Reports of Suspected Human Trafficking.  Reports of human trafficking, also 
referred to as “Blue Lightning” events, must be reported to the DEN. (T-1) 
8.12.4.7.  Special Interest Flights (SIFs).  For all issues concerning any SIF operation in 
progress, ARTCC, Center Radar Approach Control (CERAP), Honolulu Control Facility 
(HCF), and ATCTs must contact the DEN. (T-1)  Additionally, any SIFs identified by the 
FAA, DoD, or other national security agency, must be coordinated on the DEN in real-
time. (T-1) 
8.12.4.8.  Special Interest Sites.  ATC facilities must immediately notify SF of reports or 
information received for unusual activity in the vicinity of special interest sites such as 
nuclear power plants, power plants, dams, refineries, etc. (T-1)  The DEN must be promptly 
notified of any actions taken in response to these procedures. (T-1) 
8.12.4.9.  Death, Illness, or Other Public Health Risk on Board an Aircraft.  ATC facilities 
must forward information to the DEN when advised of a death, illness, and/or other public 
health risk onboard an aircraft. (T-1) 
8.12.4.10.  Divert Aircraft from International Locations.  Any aircraft departing from an 
international location that diverts and lands at a U.S. airport different from the original U.S. 
76 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
destination airport or any diverted aircraft that ATC otherwise identifies as suspicious must 
be promptly reported to the DEN. (T-1) 
8.12.4.11.  ATC Security services for the DC Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA).  Provide 
ATC security services at locations where procedures are required for tracking aircraft in 
security services airspace.  All instances of loss of communication, intermittent transponder 
or transponder/Mode C failure, the inability to security track aircraft, other unusual IFR or 
VFR or suspicious flight must be reported to the DEN. (T-1) 
8.12.4.12.  Reporting Unauthorized, Hazardous, or Suspicious UAS Activities.  ATC 
facilities must also take action for any reported or observed unauthorized, hazardous, or 
suspicious UAS activities. (T-1)  If UAS activity is creating a hazard to air traffic, contact 
SF and provide location, description, and other pertinent information for the activity. 
8.13.  Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) ATC Procedures.  CCTLRs and controllers should 
refer to the UAS Info Share on the HQ AFFSA Airfield Operations SharePoint website for 
consolidated references to assist in management of Title 14 CFR Parts 91, General Operating and 
Flight Rules, 107 Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and 49 U.S. Code (USC) § 44809 Exception 
for Limited Recreational Operations of Unmanned Aircraft.  Additionally, the UAS Info Share 
provides CCTLRs with documents and links for information regarding UAS facility mapping, 
capabilities and limitations by group, special security instruction requests, checklists adapted from 
outside agencies/services, etc. 
8.13.1.  Controllers will describe UAS (small-UAS [sUAS] and/or Remotely Piloted Aircraft  
[RPA]) to other aircraft by stating “unmanned aircraft/unmanned [TYPE])”. (T-1)  
PHRASEOLOGY: "ACID, UNMANNED AIRCRAFT/UNMANNED RQ-4” 
8.13.2.  Radio checks between UAS operators or pilots and ATC will be conducted prior to 
operations. (T-3)  All communications between ATC and UAS operators/pilots will be 
accomplished on designated primary and/or alternate ATC frequencies. (T-3)  Secondary or 
backup communications and/or telephone connectivity will be pre-coordinated. (T-3) 
8.13.3.  Aircraft Category: For the purpose of ATC separation and sequencing, UAS will be 
classified as “Category III”, subject to change dependent on the Certificate of Authorization  
(COA) or appropriate guidance. (T-1) 
8.13.4.  Prior to commencing and at the conclusion of UAS operations, controllers will advise 
adjacent approach control facilities that UAS operations are being conducted or terminated. 
(T-0)  
8.13.5.  ATIS procedures.  Controllers will update the ATIS to reflect when UAS operations 
are conducted within the terminal area and when they terminate. (T-3)  
8.13.5.1.  Controllers will include in the ATIS broadcast remarks that "unmanned aircraft 
operations are in progress.” (T-3)  This advisory is required once a UAS requests to taxi or 
launch, and 15 minutes prior to its estimated time of arrival. 
8.13.5.2.  Controllers will terminate advisory when UAS operations are complete, UAS is 
not returning for over one hour, or when the UAS lands, exits the runway, and no longer 
poses a potential impact to taxi operations. (T-3)  
8.13.6.  Separation and Sequencing.  Controllers will adhere to the following requirements: 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
77 
8.13.6.1.  UAS cannot be instructed to follow another aircraft or UAS. (T-0) 
8.13.6.2.  Visual Separation.  Use of visual separation between UAS and manned aircraft 
or UAS and UAS is not authorized.  This does not restrict the tower controller's ability to 
visually separate aircraft. (T-0) 
8.13.6.3.  Special Visual Flight Rules (SVFR) is not authorized with UAS. (T-0) 
8.13.6.4.  Simultaneous Same Direction.  All UAS will be treated in accordance with 
FAAO JO 7110.65AA. (T-0) 
8.13.6.5.  Issue cautionary wake turbulence advisories, and the position, altitude, and 
direction of flight to landing UAS operators or pilots, if in your opinion, wake turbulence 
may have an adverse effect on the aircraft. (T-0)  Wake turbulence rules cannot be waived 
by the operator/pilot. 
8.13.6.6.  During UAS lost link, the control tower may activate the Primary Crash 
Activation System (PCAS).  However, the UAS/RPA may not require the same level of 
rescue services provided for normal emergencies.  Specify local procedures detailing the 
required rescue services for UAS lost link emergencies. (T-1)  
8.13.6.6.1.  If lost link occurs, UAS or RPA operators/pilots will immediately notify 
ATC with the following information, if applicable: 
8.13.6.6.1.1.  Time of lost link.  (T-1)  
8.13.6.6.1.2.  Last known position. (T-1)  
8.13.6.6.1.3.  Altitude. (T-1)  
8.13.6.6.1.4.  Route of flight. (T-1)  
8.13.6.6.1.5.  Confirm execution of lost link procedures, to include orbit points. 
(T-1)  
8.13.6.6.1.6.  Confirm observer/pilot has visual contact with UAS/RPA. (T-1) 
8.13.6.6.1.7.  Communications procedures and preplanned flight termination 
points, if the recovery of the UAS is deemed unfeasible. (T-1)  
8.13.6.6.2.  Lost link procedures are dependent upon airframe and operations and will 
be outlined in accordance with local procedures and FAAO JO 7110.65AA. (T-0) 
8.13.7.  Suspicious UAS.  Consistent with provisions of air traffic service, duty, and 
operational priorities, all facilities must report suspicious UAS.  Suspicious UAS may include 
operating without authorization; operating in the vicinity of sensitive locations; or disrupting 
normal air traffic operations.  Report of a UAS alone does not constitute suspicious activity.  
Development of a comprehensive list of suspicious activities is not possible due to the vast 
number of situations that could be considered suspicious.  Controllers must exercise sound 
judgment when identifying situations that could constitute or indicate suspicious activity.  
CCTLRs will develop a localized checklist that provides guidance on reporting suspicious 
UAS activities. (T-2)  CCTLRs should consider items on "Suspicious UAS Checklist” located 
within the UAS Info Share on the HQ AFFSA SharePoint site for inclusion on the checklist.  
The 
checklist 
can

78 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
8.14.  Use of Emerging Technology in ATC Facilities.  The MAJCOM OPR for ATC Operations 
must review locally developed CONOPs, policies, procedures, and training requirements for 
technologies requiring additional displays for control/assist positions (e.g., sUAS, counter UAS 
tracking systems, and Avian/bird radars). (T-2) Note: MACOMs will ensure AFFSA/XA is 
coordinated with prior to acquisition or implementation. (T-1) 
8.15.  Landing Zone (LZ) Operations.  CCTLRs must ensure that the requirements of the ATC 
rulemaking authority (e.g., FAA, host nation, contingency environment/combatant commander), 
are met in order to provide ATC services to an LZ. (T-0)  For example, FAA and Air Force 
requirements within the NAS require the establishment of required ATC airspace, facility 
equipment provisions, and mandatory personnel credentialing, training, and medical 
qualifications. 
8.15.1.  CCTLRs must ensure LZ operations will be outlined in an LOP for LZs at locations 
with established ATC operations (CONUS and non-contingency host nation bases). (T-2) 
8.15.2.  When ATC services are being provided to the LZ and other associated runways, and 
the landing/departure operations to the LZ are contained within the Tower-controlled CMA, 
controllers are authorized to issue landing/departure clearance using the following example 
phraseology: 
(T-2) 
 
PHRASEOLOGY: 
“(ACID) 
RUNWAY/LANDING 
ZONE 
(NUMBER/NAME) WIND, CLEARED TO LAND/FOR THE OPTION/FOR TAKEOFF.” 
Note: Controllers should not provide landing/takeoff clearances at LZs where there is not an 
established ATC-controlled CMA.  In this instance controllers, should advise aircraft that 
operations are at their own risk. 
8.15.3.  When ATC services are being provided to an LZ, CCTLRS must ensure IFR 
departures, instrument approaches, and circling procedures are not authorized unless the LZ is 
certified for IFR operations in accordance with unified facilities criteria (UFC) requirements 
and the applicable IFR procedures are TERPS approved. (T-0) 
8.16.  Advance Coordination for VIP Visits. 
8.16.1.  An advance survey group comprised of representatives of the Office of the Military 
Assistant to the President, the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), the White House Staff, and a 
Presidential Advance Agent may visit each location the Presidential aircraft will transit.  The 
visit is normally made several days in advance of the trip to determine security aspects and the 
availability of supporting services.  On this visit the group may meet with the airport operator, 
the CCTLR, and other interested parties.  Based on the evaluation by this group, a decision is

ATC TRAINING PROGRAM 
9.1.  Purpose.  The purpose is to qualify air traffic controllers for position certifications, AOV 
facility ratings, and provide skill-level advancement and facility management positions to support 
wartime readiness and peacetime operations.  ATC training programs consolidate and standardize 
common training tasks and doctrine while integrating Air Force, MAJCOM, and unit directives.  
Each unit must develop, implement, and administer each program as required in this manual, DAFI 
36-2670, DAFMAN 36-2689, and DAFH 36-2675. 
9.2.  ATC Training Program Structure.  ATC training program structure consists of four parts 
and is designed to standardize the flow of all ATC training. 
9.2.1.  Front load training (FLT). 
9.2.1.1.  Part I – Local area knowledge. 
9.2.1.2.  Part II – Facility equipment. 
9.2.2.  Facility continuation training (FCT). 
9.2.2.1.  Part III – Position certification. 
9.2.2.2.  Part IV – AF Job qualification standards. 
9.3.  Training OI (TOI) Construction.  The TOI establishes policy and procedures for 
implementing and defining the responsibilities of all personnel involved in the program.  The TOI 
expands those areas where further explanation is required and standardizes local training 
procedures and should not restate training requirements, procedures, or responsibilities already 
published.  The TOI should be approved by the AOF/CC.  The NATCT must ensure the TOI 
address all facets of ATC training to include, but not limited to: 
9.3.1.  Training Team responsibilities. (T-2) 
9.3.2.  Newcomer’s Indoctrination.  CCTLRs must ensure a Newcomer’s Indoctrination 
Program is developed and completed within 60 calendar days of arrival. (T-2)  Facility tours 
or visits, if required, should be accomplished prior to the first position certification. 
9.3.3.  Upgrade, position certification, or award of SEI and stop training circumstances. (T-2) 
9.3.3.1.  Requests for certification and processing channels. (T-2) 
9.3.3.2.  Local documentation requirements. (T-2)

the following: 
9.4.1.  CFETP.  (T-2) 
9.4.2.  Master Task List (MTL)/Master Task and Technical Reference (MTTR).  AFFSA/XA 
develops, maintains and publishes the Air Force ATC MTTR.  Each facility is required to 
maintain, publish and utilize a local MTTR. (T-2)  Air Force/Local MTTR can serve as an 
MTL if the MTTR identifies which tasks coincide with each position. (T-2)  
9.4.2.1.  All core tasks references are mandatory for 1C131 personnel in upgrade training. 
9.4.2.2.  CCTLRs may defer Air Force ATC MTTR references for non-1C131 personnel.  
Deferred references must be accomplished in writing. (T-2) 
9.4.3.  Certification Guides (Part I, II, III and IV). (T-2)  
9.4.4.  QTP/DAF Form 797. (T-2)  The DAF Form 797 is a continuation of the CFETP Part 
II, defining locally unique tasks. 
9.5.  Certification Guides (Part I, II, III and IV).  NATCTs will ensure all ATC certification 
guides are developed in accordance with DAFH 36-2675. (T-2)  Develop Part I and II guides along 
with separate PCGs for each position requiring certification (Part III).  NATCTs will ensure Part 
IV training utilizes applicable QTPs, as required. (T-2)  
9.5.1.  The CCTLR, with the assistance of the NATCT, will review all locally developed 
guides, to include PCGs, annually to ensure complete task coverage. (T-2)  Document annual 
review in TRB minutes. 
9.5.2.  A comprehensive task analysis is only required when a new task or position is 
introduced.

a minimum of one year. (T-2)  
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
81 
9.5.4.  Part IV AF Job Qualification Standards.  Controllers must use the published QTP 
products. (T-1)  As necessary, units should supplement QTPs with MAJCOM, local QTP, or 
other training requirements.  NATCTs will ensure local guides contain the above paragraph 
9.5.3 requirements with the exception of simulation and non-radar training. (T-1) 
9.5.5.  After award of SEI or SEI equivalent, controllers can be classified as “with prior 
experience.” 
9.6.  Records and Documentation. 
9.6.1.  Master Training Record (MTR).  NATCTs must establish a standardized training record 
for each facility, updated monthly, as a minimum, to template and standardize the most current 
training requirements and documentation (e.g., monthly proficiency, recurring and review 
training items requiring documentation). (T-2)  The NATCT must ensure the MTR contains 
examples for each duty position in the facility (e.g., TERPS, NAAM, and AOSS). (T-2)  Note: 
Not applicable to units utilizing the AODMS program.

only maintain the DAF Form 797 and DAF Form 1098 to document TERPS training. 
9.6.2.2.  Training records of former active-duty controllers who are subsequently hired to 
work in the same facility, as a civilian controller, are transferable to the same GS-2152 
duties.  Individual facility certifications/ratings are also transferable from active duty to 
GS-2152 duties in the same facility, provided the individual meets the criteria in either 
paragraph 9.6.2.3 or 9.6.2.4 below. 
9.6.2.3.  At the discretion of the CCTLR, position certifications for prior military 
controllers who are re-hired and report for duty into the same facility within 30 calendar 
days as a civilian controller may be recognized as valid and current and have no 
requirement for a special evaluation.  Note: In this case, the original annual certification 
date would be retained. 
9.6.2.4.  At the discretion of the CCTLR, position certifications for prior military 
controllers who are re-hired into the same facility more than 30 calendar days, but less than 
270 calendar days since ratings and certifications were cancelled may be recognized as 
valid and current, contingent on the successful completion of a special evaluation to 
demonstrate proficiency. 
9.6.2.5.  For GS-2152 personnel who are experiencing difficulty in training (EDIT), 
CCTLRS must give consideration to existing terms of employment when considering 
initiating corrective actions. (T-1)  Supervisors should, based on the term of employment, 
contact the Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF) for more guidance when determining proper

tools, and resources for individual duty position management. 
9.9.  Simulation.  NATCTs must ensure simulation scenarios of appropriate traffic levels and 
complexity are incorporated into PCG objectives. (T-2)   Scenarios may be used to supplement 
position certifications (not applicable to locations without simulation equipment). 
9.10.  Withdrawal from ATC Duty.  Unit commanders initiate Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 
withdrawal and/or reclassification actions in conjunction with AOV credential revocation.  APFC 
Military Classifications (AFPC/DPMSSM) is the final approval authority of AFSC withdrawal.  
AFMAN 36-2100, Chapter 2, delineates Air Force policy for withdrawing (disqualification from) 
or downgrading AFSCs and implements the AFECD.  The AFECD is published four times per 
year and is the authoritative source for reporting identifiers (RI) and their applicability to Airmen.  
Additionally, DAFMAN 36-2689 provides further guidance.  Criteria for RI are outlined in the 
Enlisted AFSC Disqualification Personnel Services Delivery Guide, DAFI 36-2110, Total Force 
Assignments and DAFMAN 36-2689.  The latest disqualification guidance is located on the 
MyFSS website. 
9.10.1.  CCTLRs must identify controllers who demonstrate substandard performance to the 
squadron commander at the earliest time, to correct the substandard performance or obtain a 
suitable replacement. (T-2)  
9.10.2.  When withdrawal, disciplinary or other administrative actions are appropriate, do not 
allow one action to substitute for or delay the other.  If more than one category of withdrawal 
is merited, the unit commander will make the final determination of the most appropriate 
category of withdrawal to expedite resolution of pending actions. (T-2)  
9.10.3.  AOV credential withdrawal applies to military personnel holding a 1C1X1 or 13M3 
primary or secondary AFSC. 
9.10.4.  A controller returned to home station for failure to obtain or maintain an ATC rating 
at a contingency location is not qualified to perform further ATC duties unless approved by 
MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM) that has functional oversight.  The MFM will review 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
87 
contingency commander recommendations and provide home station unit commanders a 
recommendation to reinstate or withdraw an individual’s AOV credential. 
9.11.  Withdrawal Categories.  There are three categories of withdrawal action applicable to 
military controllers: 1) medical disqualification, 2) failure to maintain mandatory qualification 
standards other than medical, and 3) failure to obtain or maintain a rating.  Sample memorandums 
and checklists associated with withdrawing ATC AFSCs are provided in Attachments 3-6. 
9.11.1.  Criteria for each withdrawal category are outlined below: 
9.11.1.1.  Medical Disqualification.  If a controller is diagnosed with a permanently 
disqualifying medical condition (i.e., DD Form 2992, Medical Recommendations for 
Flying or Special Operational Duty, Section 12, and Permanent Disqualification), the unit 
commander will revoke the individual's facility ratings and certifications, withdraw AOV 
credential, and initiate AFSC withdrawal within 60 calendar days of receiving 
disqualification paperwork from the Flight Surgeon (see Attachment 3). (T-0) 
9.11.1.2.  Failure to Maintain Mandatory Qualification Standards Other Than Medical (see 
Attachment 4).  A determination that a condition exists which could affect flying safety 
and credentials.  This includes for non-performance of primary duty.  Military personnel 
assigned to an ATC UMD billet that do not perform their primary duty for 15 consecutive 
months must be withdrawn under this category. (T-1) 
9.11.1.3.  Failure to Obtain or Maintain a Rating (FTOR) (see Attachment 4).  Use these 
procedures for controllers in upgrade and qualification training who fail to obtain or 
maintain a rating. 
9.11.2.  For GS-2152 personnel, failure to obtain or maintain position certifications or facility 
ratings for the duty position held or failure to maintain required medical standards, may be 
grounds for termination of employment. 
9.11.2.1.  Supervisors should carefully monitor GS-2152 controllers’ progress in 
qualification training, to identify performance problems.  Supervisors should contact the 
CPF for guidance if considering terminating a DoD employee. 
9.11.2.2.  If required by CPF, a supervisor must develop a Performance Improvement Plan 
(PIP) to facilitate correction of the employee’s performance deficiencies. (T-2) 
9.11.2.3.  If deficiencies are not corrected within specified time limits, the PIP (rather than 
the employee’s DAF Form 623) will be used to support termination of employment. (T-2)  
Reference Chapter 3 of DoDI 1400.25V431_DAFI 36-1002, Performance Management 
and Appraisal Program Administration in the Department of the Air Force, and contact

9.12.  Withdrawal and Reinstatement Procedures and Notification.  (see Attachment 6) 
9.12.1.  Units will notify MAJCOM OPR for ATC and Base Training Manager of any pending 
withdrawal actions for all categories including administrative and whether or not the 
withdrawal action should be “For Cause”. (T-2)  
9.12.1.1.  For withdrawals based on medical disqualification, flight surgeon and clinical 
representatives process packages directly with the MAJCOM Surgeon General.  Forward

medical withdrawals according to AFMAN 36-2100, and the Classification Enlisted AFSC 
Disqualifications Personnel Services Delivery (PSD) Guide located on the MyFSS website. 
9.12.1.2.  When the basis for withdrawing the AFSC is for conditions or actions over which 
the Airman had control, withdrawal action will be qualified as “For Cause". (T-1)  
Examples of “For Cause", include loss of security clearance due to misconduct, drug abuse, 
alcohol involvement, failure to progress in training (for reasons within their control), 
substandard duty performance or other acts that led to AFSC withdrawal. 
9.12.2.  MAJCOM OPR for ATC will: 
9.12.2.1.  For all withdrawal actions (other than medical), recommend AFSC withdrawal 
or reinstatement action to unit commander. 
9.12.2.2.  For all withdrawal actions (other than medical), inform unit commander whether 
or not the withdrawal action should be “For Cause" and, if appropriate, recommend 
termination and/or recoupment of the selective reenlistment bonus (SRB).

DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
95 
by using examiner-developed tests that ensure comprehensive CFETP/DAF Form 797 task 
coverage based on the objectives set in the PCG.  The DE will observe the trainee's performance 
for a reasonable period under normal workload conditions as prescribed by the standards of the 
PCG.  Simulation may be used to augment the evaluation.  Tower personnel must be certified by 
a designated weather examiner per the local Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) Program and 
document on DAF Form 3622 prior to receiving their initial position certification within a tower 
facility. (T-1) 
11.5.1.  Position Certification Completion: “Pass” 
11.5.1.1.  DE must: 
11.5.1.1.1.  Document certification on DAF Form 623a, or electronic equivalent. (T-2)

with this manual until award of facility rating. (T-2)  Retain position certification 
documentation until completion of annual evaluation. (T-2) 
11.5.1.1.2.  Document position certifications and/or facility ratings on DAF Form 3622 
or suitable substitute. (T-2) 
11.5.1.1.3.  When applicable, initiate the appropriate rating request in AOV. (T-1) 
11.5.1.1.4.  As applicable, issue temporary credential to controller. (T-1) 
11.5.1.2.  WS must document results on DAF Form 3616. (T-2) 
11.5.2.  Position Certification Completion: “Fail” 
11.5.2.1.  DE must document certification on DAF Form 623a, or suitable substitute. (T-2)  
Retain until award of position certification. (T-2) 
11.5.2.2.  WS must refer the individual to the CCTLR to determine whether to reenter the 
controller into position training, or initiate action to withdraw the individual from the career 
field. (T-2) 
11.5.2.3.  WS must document results on DAF Form 3616. (T-2) 
11.6.  Revocation of ATC Position Certification and Facility Rating. 
11.6.1.  When designated in AOV as a PM/Co-PM or Designated Examiner, the AOF/CC, 
CCTLR, NSE, and TSN have the independent authority to revoke the position certification(s) 
of a controller whose control practices demonstrate a hazard to flying safety. (T-0)  The 
revoking authority must, at a minimum, (1) revoke the position certification of the position in 
which the hazardous discrepancy was identified, and (2) determine whether to limit the 
decertification of associated STS items to that position, or to decertify STS items across 
multiple positions, either of which are permitted but also carry much different implications. 
(T-1)   
Note 1:  Revocation of additional position certification(s) may be restricted to the facility in 
which the controller demonstrated a hazard to flying safety. The revocation authority may also 
revoke all positions in all facilities where certifications are held, assuming that authority is so 
empowered (e.g., a RAPCON CCTLR would not be authorized to revoke certifications in the 
Tower; however, an AOF/CC would be). In any instance of revocation, the controller must not 
be allowed to work unmonitored in any position(s) until all required re-training in decertified 
96 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
STS items and re-certification have been completed in the position(s) where certifications were 
revoked. A Special evaluation is not required for subsequent positions in which ratings were not 
revoked. 
Example:  A controller’s Approach and Arrival Control certifications are revoked, and re-
training is required in a specific STS item. The controller will not work unmonitored at any 
position in which the de-certified STS item is trained until the controller has been re-certified in 
that task through third-party evaluation in the position(s) for which certifications were revoked. 
In this example, Approach and Arrival must both be evaluated prior to the controller performing 
further ATC duties unmonitored in any other position. The task re-certification for these 
positions, and by extension the demonstration of task knowledge and safe practical application, 
will extend to any other position which may have required training in the de-certified STS items 
but was not considered appropriate for full revocation.  
Note 2:  In weighing a decision to revoke certifications, authorities noted above will consider 
first and foremost the controller’s explicit requirement to uphold DAF and FAA ATC standards, 
and thus to create and perpetuate an operating environment that facilitates safe, orderly, and 
expeditious movement of all air traffic. 
11.6.1.1.  The following discrepancies constitute clear departures from DAF and FAA 
ATC standards and must therefore be categorized as control practices that demonstrate a 
hazard to flying safety: 
11.6.1.1.1.  An event wherein a controller’s loss of situational awareness, lack of 
knowledge or proficiency, or mindful disregard for air traffic within his/her assigned 
airspace led to or clearly contributed to the violation of ATC regulations and/or the loss 
of applicable separation standards. (T-1) 
11.6.1.1.2.  An event wherein a controller allowed an aircraft(s), vehicle(s), or 
personnel to operate on a runway/landing zone/helipad/aerodrome surface, or within 
the CMA, in a manner contrary to or in clear violation of operational regulations and/or 
restrictions. (T-1) 
11.6.1.2.  Furthermore, consider a controller’s training, primary duty performance history, 
and the following circumstances when evaluating causality, the gravity of the discrepancy, 
and appropriate corrective actions: 
11.6.1.2.1.  Environmental factors (e.g., noise levels, traffic level, complexity, 
equipment status). 
11.6.1.2.2.  Crew resource management factors (e.g., decision making, workload 
management, communication, situational awareness, group dynamics). 
11.6.1.2.3.  Implication of hazardous operational deficiency(ies) on other operating 
positions and/or facilities (e.g., which STS item was decertified and how may it apply 
elsewhere? Or did the controller’s inadequate position-relief briefing create an unsafe 
situation in adjacent airspace or within another controller’s operating position or area 
of jurisdiction?). 
11.6.1.3.  Environmental factors (e.g., noise levels, traffic level, and complexity). 
11.6.1.4.  Crew resource management factors (e.g., decision making, workload 
management, communication, situational awareness, group dynamics). 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
97 
11.6.2.  Documentation: CCTLRs will enter the date of revocation into the ‘Date 
Cancelled/Revoked’ block next to each position certification on the controller’s DAF Form 
3622 and then annotate an “R” with the effective date of revocation in the same block in pen. 
(T-1) 
11.6.3.  Applicable STS items in CFETP will be decertified. (T-1) 
11.6.4.  All revocations will be documented on an DAF Form 623a and retained in the 
controller’s DAF Form 623 for a minimum of one year with the following: 
11.6.4.1.  Controller’s name. (T-1) 
11.6.4.2.  Effective date of revocation. (T-1) 
11.6.4.3.  All facility ratings and certifications affected. (T-1) 
11.6.4.4.  Reason for rating or position certification revocation. (T-1) 
11.6.4.5.  Recommended course of action and corrective actions as applicable. (T-1) 
11.6.4.6.  Signature of the affected controller and suspending authority. (T-1) 
11.6.4.7.  Specific STS decertified. (T-1) 
11.6.5.  In any instance of revocation, AOV-responsible parties (e.g., PM, CCTLR) must notify 
their respective MAJCOM POC NLT the next duty day following the certification(s) 
revocation action. (T-2)  Upon receipt of said notification, the MAJCOM POC will amend the 
controller’s status from Active to Inactive and provide pertinent details in the associated dialog 
box. At the time certifications are re-obtained, AOV-responsible parties must notify the 
MAJCOM POC to return the controller to Active status. (T-1) 
Note:  Rendering a controller’s credential status as “Inactive” does not imply a controller is 
restricted from performing ATC duties in positions for which the controller still retains position 
certifications. The intent of changing from “Active” to “Inactive” status is two-fold: (1) It 
enables the MAJCOM to document within AOV the nature of the incident and other pertinent 
details, and (2) It ensures a controller’s credential history is properly maintained and that the 
shift from “Inactive” to “Active” is handled at the system-dependent Administrator level. 
11.6.6.  Within 10 duty days of certification(s) revocation, the CCTLR must re-enter the 
controller into training or initiate AFSC withdrawal procedures in accordance with 
Attachment 4. (T-1)  Upon re-entering a controller into training, the CCTLR will concurrently 
notify respective MAJCOM personnel of this action by providing a synopsis of all corrective 
action plans, including but not limited to all decertified STS items, remedial actions to ensure 
the event or the discrepancy is not repeated (e.g., “Lessons Learned” MFRs, Playback De-
briefings, transcript drills, CCTLR Policy Letters, procedure modifications, etc.), and the 
estimated timeline for resolution and restoral to “Active” credential status. (T-3)  
Note 1:  Never erase or overwrite an “R” annotated on DAF Form 3622. 
Note 2:  Deployed CCTLRs must notify a controller’s home-station CCTLR of revocation 
action. (T-1) 
11.7.  Suspension of Position Certifications.  When a controller has not met CCTLR-established 
position proficiency requirements for one or more positions, certification for the position(s) is/are 
automatically suspended.  No entry in the DAF Form 3622 will be made for suspension due to lack 
98 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
of proficiency and do not submit for AOV credential withdrawal. (T-1)  The AOF/CC and the 
CCTLR have the authority to suspend position certifications for a lack of proficiency.  CCTLRs 
must document all suspensions on an DAF Form 623a and retain in the controller’s DAF Form 
623 for a minimum of one year with the following: 
11.7.1.  Controller’s name. (T-1)  
11.7.2.  Effective date of suspension. (T-1)  
11.7.3.  All facility ratings and certifications affected. (T-1)  
11.7.4.  Reason for rating or position certification suspension. (T-1)  
11.7.5.  Recommended course of action and corrective actions as applicable. (T-1)  
11.7.6.  Signature of the suspended controller and suspending authority. (T-1)  
11.8.  Cancellation of ATC Position Certifications.  The CCTLR must cancel position 
certifications when a controller is separated from service, departs for a PCS, or transfers to a non-
ATC assignment. (T-1) 
11.8.1.  The AOF/CC and CCTLR have the authority to cancel position certifications. 
11.8.2.  Documentation: cancel position certifications by entering a “C” and the effective date 
of cancellation in the Date Cancelled/Revoked block on the controller’s DAF Form 3622 next 
to each position certification being canceled.  Note: Refer to paragraphs 9.6.2.3 and 9.6.2.4 for 
procedures regarding controllers re-hired as civilians. 
11.9.  ATC Annual, Special, and Controller Evaluations. 
11.9.1.  Annual evaluations will be conducted NLT the last day of the 12th month from the 
anniversary of the AOV facility rating, or last annual evaluation at the current location. (T-1)  
Annual evaluation will be conducted in the most complex position held by the controller for 
each facility in which they hold an AOV credentialed position. (T-1)  CCTLRs must rank the 
complexity of each position and establish procedures for overdue annual certifications in an 
LOP. (T-1)  Example 1: SSgt Margeson received her approach rating on 17 Mar.  Sergeant 
Margeson now holds the AOV facility rating Radar Approach Control. SSgt Margeson will 
have an annual evaluation in the most complex position held in the RAPCON no later than last 
day of the month she received her first facility rating, 31 Mar.  Example 2: SrA Hoffman is a 
dual-rated controller.  SrA Hoffman holds the AOV facility rating of Tower and Radar 
Approach Control.  Since SrA Hoffman’s tower rating was awarded first on 3 April, his annual 
evaluations in both tower and radar approach control must be complete in the most complex 
positions held no later than 30 April annually, regardless of when the radar certification was 
awarded.  Example 3: MSgt Blodgett is TDY and goes overdue for his annual evaluation in 
August.  Upon return to duty, the annual evaluation is accomplished on 7 October.  MSgt 
Blodgett’s next annual is due NLT 31 October of the following year. 
11.9.1.1.  When a controller has not had an annual evaluation conducted within the allotted 
time period, the CCTLR will suspend the position certifications via memorandum with 
corrective actions in accordance with paragraph 11.7. (T-1)  
11.9.1.2.  For an annual evaluation “pass”, facilities in the AOV system will renew the 
holder's rating. (T-1)  Facilities not in the AOV system will document on DAF Form 623a 
and retain until the next annual evaluation is accomplished. (T-1) 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
99 
11.9.1.3.  For an annual evaluation “fail” for demonstrated hazard to flight safety, revoke 
certifications (reference paragraph 11.6.).  
11.9.1.4.  For an annual evaluation “fail” for reasons other than a demonstrated hazard to 
flight safety, refer the individual to the CCTLR for appropriate action. 
11.9.1.5.  Evaluators may choose to continue the evaluation at another time to observe 
normal workload conditions. 
11.9.1.6.  Document all annual evaluation results on DAF Form 3616. 
11.9.2.  Special evaluations are conducted on controllers who have had ratings revoked as a 
result of a demonstrated hazard to flying safety or suspended due to a lack of proficiency.  
Evaluators must maintain override capability while performing special evaluations until 
satisfactory results are achieved. (T-1) 
11.9.2.1.  Hazard to Flying Safety.  Only the DE will conduct special evaluations on 
controller’s whose ratings were revoked as a result of flying safety. (T-1)  Note: If a WS 
conducting a special evaluation believes the controller is a hazard to flight safety, the 
evaluation must be immediately terminated and the WS should immediately report the 
termination and reason to the NSE or CCTLR for action. 
11.9.2.2.  Lack of proficiency.  A WS or DE may perform a special evaluation for 
certifications suspended due to a lack of proficiency. 
11.9.2.3.  A special evaluation may suffice for an annual evaluation if conducted during 
the renewal month by a DE.  Example: TSgt Lopez returns from a TDY in April and did 
not meet her proficiency requirements for the month of March.  TSgt Lopez requires special 
evaluations in all positions in which she did not meet proficiency requirements, and her 
annual is also due in April.  If the special evaluation in the most complex position held by 
TSgt Lopez is accomplished by a DE, then the special may also suffice as TSgt Lopez’s 
annual evaluation. 
11.9.2.4.  For a special evaluation “pass,” document evaluation on DAF Form 623a or 
suitable substitute and retain in the individual’s training record until the next annual 
evaluation is accomplished.  For individuals that are not facility rated, maintain all position 
evaluations in the individual’s training record until the facility rating is awarded. 
11.9.2.5.  For a special evaluation “fail” for demonstrated hazard to flight safety, revoke 
certifications (reference paragraph 11.6.). 
11.9.2.6.  For a special evaluation “fail” for reasons other than a demonstrated hazard to 
flight safety, refer the individual to the CCTLR for appropriate action. 
11.9.2.7.  Evaluator may choose to continue the evaluation at another time to observe 
normal workload conditions. 
11.9.2.8.  Document results of all special evaluations on DAF Form 3616. 
11.9.3.  A controller evaluation will be conducted on a position certified controller in any 
position deemed necessary when judgment, actual proficiency levels (based on the established 
PCG standards), or questionable practices warrant further evaluation. (T-1) 
100 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
11.9.3.1.  The AOF/CC, CCTLR, NSE, or CTO examiner (where applicable) have the 
authority to direct a controller evaluation. 
11.9.3.2.  The NSE/ANSE, or CTO examiner (where applicable) will conduct the 
controller evaluation during live traffic or a combination of live and simulated traffic. (T-3) 
11.9.3.3.  For a controller evaluation “pass,” document evaluation on DAF Form 623a or 
suitable substitute and retain in the individual’s training record until the next annual 
evaluation is accomplished.  For individuals that are not facility rated, maintain all position 
evaluations in the individual’s training record until the facility rating is awarded. 
11.9.3.4.  For a controller evaluation “fail” for a demonstrated hazard to flight safety, 
revoke certifications (reference paragraph 11.6.).  
11.9.3.5.  For a controller evaluation “fail” for lack of proficiency, suspend certifications 
(reference paragraph 11.7.). 
11.9.3.6.  Evaluator may choose to continue the evaluation at another time to observe 
normal workload conditions. 
11.9.3.7.  Document results of all controller evaluations on DAF Form 3616. 
11.10.  Temporary Control Locations.  Do not withdraw or place credentials in inactive status 
for TDY/deployments with an expected duration of less than 270 calendar days.  AOV credentials 
suspended for 270 calendar days or more should be placed in an inactive status with the reason 
“ATC at other locations” in the AOV system.  Site-specific credentials, other than the controller’s 
home facility credentials, are not required.  However, the qualifications, knowledge, and skill 
requirements outlined in service-specific DoD requirements remain in effect.  An ATCS must 
undergo skills checks and be certified on all locally established positions by a DE at the temporary 
air traffic control facility. (T-3) 
11.11.  ATC Facility Evaluations.  The NSE/ANSE/TSN/ATSN will conduct periodic facility 
evaluations, on each crew, at least every 90 calendar days to ensure adherence to facility operating 
directives and standard application of procedures utilizing the Standardized Facility Evaluation 
Checklist available on the HQ AFFSA Airfield Operations SharePoint website. (T-2)  Note:  For 
facilities without established crews, conduct three random evaluations every 90 calendar days. 
11.11.1.  As a minimum, the NSE will observe: 
11.11.1.1.  Crew application of Crew Resource Management (CRM) principles: 
11.11.1.1.1.  Situational Awareness. (T-2) 
11.11.1.1.2.  Effective Communications. (T-2) 
11.11.1.1.3.  Risk Management. (T-2) 
11.11.1.1.4.  Workload Management. (T-2) 
11.11.1.1.5.  Group Dynamics. (T-2)

path and instill a sense of industry in career field training.  This document is the formal training 
contract between the Career Field Manager (CFM) and Air Education and Training Command 
(AETC) for formal accession and life-cycle skills training. 
Closed—An airfield is "closed" when no flying activity is permitted.  If the closure is for a 
particular type of aircraft or operation, it must be so stated.  For example: "Closed to aircraft not 
involved in Volant Rodeo." 
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—As defined in AOIs, any portion of the airfield requiring 
aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific ATC approval for access (normally via two-
way radio contact with the control tower).  CMAs include but are not limited to areas used for 
takeoff, landing and as required taxiing of aircraft.  Note: This definition is used in lieu of 
"movement area" as defined in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary which can be found on the FAA

operational deficiencies.  Review training is developed based on analysis of performance 
evaluations, supervisory observations, trends, or operational evaluations. 
Revocation—The official removal of controller ratings for reasons other than PCS or PCA or lack 
of proficiency. 
Runway Surface Condition (RSC)—Identifies the condition of the runway surface when covered 
with slush, snow, ice or water. 
Runway Suspension—A short-term condition that requires temporarily restricting aircraft 
arrivals and departures until corrected (e.g., foreign object debris, severe bird/wildlife activity, 
snow and ice removal checks, arresting systems maintenance or configuration changes, airfield 
construction, pavement repair). 
Scheduled Air Carrier—An air carrier that holds a scheduled air carrier certificate and provides 
scheduled service year round between two or more points. 
Senior Airfield Authority (SAA)—The SAA is an individual appointed by the component 
responsible for airfield operations at the direction of the joint force commander.  The SAA is 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
117 
responsible for the control, operation, and maintenance of the airfield, to include deployable air 
traffic control and landing systems, the runways, associated taxiways, and parking ramps, as well 
as air, land, safety surfaces, and facilities of which proximity affects airfield operations. 
Simulation Scenario—Scripted scenarios designed to develop or maintain a controller’s skills 
using simulation equipment (any simulation equipment developed for ATC use) or any static 
environment (to include non-radar and tower static boards). 
Skill Level—The level of qualification within an awarded Air Force specialty, shown by the fourth 
digit of the AFSC. 
Special Evaluation—Used to evaluate a controller’s performance after ratings have been 
suspended or revoked. 
Specialty Experience Identifier (SEI)—A three-character code that identifies special experience 
training not otherwise identified in the personnel data system.  SEIs may permit rapid identification 
of individuals with special qualifications to meet peacetime assignments.  They provide a means 
for identifying critical manning requirements during wartime or contingency operations when little 
lead time is available for training personnel in specific technical skills. 
Specialty Training Standard (STS)—An Air Force publication that describes an Air Force 
specialty in terms of tasks and knowledge which an Airman in that specialty may be expected to 
perform and identifies the training provided to achieve a 3-, 5-, or 7-skill level within an enlisted 
Air Force specialty.  The STS further serves as a contract between AETC and the functional user 
to show the overall training requirements for an Air Force specialty code that are taught in formal 
schools and correspondence schools. 
Stop Training—When a trainee is unable to accomplish knowledge based (including classroom 
instruction), simulator (including static scenarios), and OJT due to unforeseen events or inability 
to meet standards.

Supplemental Training—Training for a portion of an Air Force Specialty without a change in 
AFSC.  Formal training on new equipment, methods and technology that is not suited for on-the- 
job training. 
Suspicious UAS—Suspicious UAS operations may include operating without authorization, 
loitering in the vicinity of sensitive locations (e.g., national security, law enforcement facilities, 
critical infrastructure), or disrupting normal air traffic operations resulting in runway changes, 
ground stops, pilot evasive action, etc.  The report of a UAS operation alone does not constitute 
suspicious activity.  Development of a comprehensive list of suspicious activities is not possible 
due to the vast number of situations that could be considered suspicious.  ATC must exercise sound 
judgment when identifying situations that could constitute or indicate a suspicious activity. 
Task—A unit of work activity or operation that forms a significant part of a duty.  A task usually 
has clear beginning and ending points and directly observable or otherwise measurable processes, 
frequently but not always resulting in a product that can be evaluated for quantity, quality or fitness 
in the work environment.  A task is performed for its own sake; that is, the task is not dependent 
upon other tasks, although it may fall in a sequence with other tasks in a duty or job array.

LONG-TERM DUTIES NOT TO INCLUDE CONTROLLING PROCEDURES 
A7.1.  Long-Term DNIC (LDNIC) Phase Procedures. 
A7.1.1.  The LDNIC phase process is intended to provide a pathway for a member’s return to 
flying status, AFSC reclassification, or service separation, when members are unable to 
perform duties pursuant to their current designated 1C1X1 duty.  The phase process addresses 
1C1X1 duty capabilities and adheres to DoD Instruction (DoDI) 1332.45, Retention 
Determination for Non- Deployable Service Members, AFI 48-133, Duty Limiting Conditions, 
and DAFMAN 48-123.  Note: Leadership should consult with the Civilian Personnel Office 
concerning any LDNIC status involving GS-2152 employees. 
A7.1.2.  Definition: Long-Term Duties Not to Include Controlling (LDNIC) status is defined 
as any consecutive 120-day period, during which the member is unable to actively control air 
traffic due to medical restrictions. 
A7.2.  Phase Process. 
A7.2.1.  The member is responsible for making all attempts to resolve Duty Limiting 
Conditions (DLC) in a timely manner and to keep leadership informed during the LDNIC 
phase process.  Note: A member’s LDNIC status will be tracked using a MAJCOM-provided 
tracking tool and will be addressed in the AOB forum, including board minutes.  The member 
is removed from the LDNIC phase process once returned to flying status. 
A7.2.1.1.  Phase I.  Members in DNIC status for four months (120 consecutive days) or 
longer will be entered into Phase I. 
A7.2.1.2.  The member, with CCTLR and unit commander’s assistance, will obtain a status 
update, along with a targeted ‘get-well’ date, and discuss Deployment Availability 
Working Group (DAWG) enrollment with the Flight Surgeon or Medical Group.  The 
CCTLR will notify the AOF/CC of the inquiry and status of the member throughout the 
process. 
A7.2.1.3.  The AOF/CC will notify major command airfield operations and airspace 
(MAJCOM/A3A) OPR of the member’s LDNIC status. 
A7.2.1.4.  The unit commander may direct a DAWG review process to determine if a 
member is unfit for continued military service and initial Review-in-lieu-of Medical Board 
(RILO). 
A7.2.1.5.  At the unit commander’s discretion, the member may perform limited 
augmentation duties in another 1C AFSC to address shortfalls or assist with duties while 
awaiting medical clearance or other pending actions. 
A7.2.2.  Phase II.  Members in DNIC status for six months (180 consecutive days) or longer 
will be entered into Phase II. 
A7.2.2.1.  The member, with CCTLR and unit commander’s assistance, will obtain a status 
update, along with a targeted ‘get-well’ date, from the Flight Surgeon or Medical Group.  
The AOF/CC will notify MAJCOM/A3A via the ATC MFM if no RILO or medical 
evaluation board (MEB) has been initiated, or if no waiver approval has been obtained.  
136 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
The MAJCOM/A3A, with the assistance of the ATC MFM, will then engage with the 
major command surgeon general (MAJCOM/SG) for remediation. 
A7.2.2.2.  MAJCOM/A3A will notify HQ AFFSA of the member’s status on a quarterly 
basis. 
A7.2.3.  Phase III.  Members in DNIC status for 12 months (365 consecutive days) or longer 
will be entered into Phase III. 
A7.2.3.1.  The unit commander and AOF/CC will engage with the Medical Group to obtain 
an updated medical evaluation to determine AFSC reclassification or military retention 
(guidance is located in AFI 48-133, DAFMAN 48-123, and DoDI 1332.45). 
A7.3.  AFSC Reclassification. 
A7.3.1.  A member will be considered for immediate reclassification if the Medical Group 
determines return to flying status is improbable (guidance is located in AFMAN 36-2100), 
provided the member is deemed medically fit to deploy and execute duties in another AFSC. 
A7.4.  Service Separation. 
A7.4.1.  A member will be considered for service separation if the Medical Group determines 
return to flying status is improbable and the member is deemed non-deployable and/or unable 
to execute duties in another AFSC.

RADAR ALIGNMENT PROCEDURES 
A8.1.  Alignment Accuracy Check. 
A8.1.1.  For applicable ANG units, and at locations not equipped with digital terminal 
automation systems (DTAS), during relief briefing, or as soon as possible after assuming 
responsibility for a control position, check the operating equipment for alignment accuracy and 
display acceptability.  Recheck periodically throughout the watch. 
A8.1.2.  Check the alignment of the radar video display by assuring that the video or digital 
map or overlay is properly aligned with a permanent target of known range and azimuth on the 
radar display.  Where possible, check one permanent target per quadrant. 
A8.1.3.  Accuracy of the radar video display must be verified for digitized radar systems by 
using the moving target indicator (MTI) reflectors, fixed location beacon transponders 
(Parrots), beacon real-time quality control (RTQC) symbols or calibration performance 
monitor equipment (CPME) beacon targets. 
A8.1.4.  DTAS conduct continuous self-monitoring of alignment accuracy; therefore, 
controller alignment checks are not required. 
A8.2.  Beacon Range Accuracy. 
A8.2.1.  You may use beacon targets for separation purposes if beacon range accuracy is 
verified by one of the following methods: Note 1: The check for verification of beacon range 
accuracy accomplished by correlation of beacon and primary radar targets of the same aircraft 
is not a check of display accuracy.  Therefore, it is not necessary that it be done using the same 
display with which separation is being provided, nor the same targets being separated.  Note 
2: Narrowband and Full Digital Automation Systems: Technical operations personnel verify 
beacon range accuracy for automated narrowband display equipment and Full Digital Terminal 
Automation Systems.  Consequently, further verification by the controller is unnecessary. 
A8.2.2.  Correlate beacon and primary targets of the same aircraft (not necessarily the one 
being provided separation) to assure that they coincide. 
A8.2.3.  When beacon and primary targets of the same aircraft do not coincide, correlate them 
to assure that any beacon displacement agrees with the specified distance and direction for that 
particular radar system. 
A8.2.4.  Refer to beacon range monitoring equipment where so installed. 
A8.2.5.  If beacon range accuracy cannot be verified, you may use beacon targets only for 
traffic information. 
A8.3.  Service Limitations. 
A8.3.1.  When radar mapping is not available, limit radar services to separating identified 
aircraft targets and vectoring aircraft to intercept a PAR final approach course. 
A8.3.2.  Providing radar service in areas that ensure no confliction with traffic on airways, 
other ATC areas of jurisdiction, restricted or prohibited areas, terrain, etc. 
138 
DAFMAN13-204V3  26 APRIL 2024 
A8.3.3.  Report radar malfunctions immediately for corrective action and for dispatch of a 
Notice to Airmen.  Advise adjacent ATC facilities when appropriate. 
A8.4.  Electronic Cursor. 
A8.4.1.  An electronic cursor may be used to aid in identifying and vectoring an aircraft and to 
give finer delineation to a video map.  Do not use it as a substitute for a video map or map 
overlay, (e.g., to form intersections, airway boundaries, and final approach courses). 
A8.4.2.  Fixed electronic cursors may be used to form the final approach course for 
surveillance approaches conducted by military operated mobile radar facilities. 
A8.5.  ATC Radar Beacon System Decoder Control Box Checks. 
A8.5.1.  Facility air traffic managers must ensure that radar controllers perform daily 
performance checks of the decoder control box as follows: 
A8.5.2.  Each controller is responsible for determining on a day-to-day basis if the operation 
of his or her decoder control box is satisfactory for ATC purposes.  Decoder control box 
performance can be determined by checking all switches, thumbwheel code selectors, and 
selected channels to ensure that they are functioning properly.  The actual operation of each 
channel should be checked by decoding a known target sequentially on each channel and 
observing it on both double and single slash.
