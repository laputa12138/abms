Chapter 1 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1.  Introduction.  This 
manual 
provides 
implementation 
guidance 
and 
establishes 
responsibilities to ensure standardized AMLO training, operations, and support across the Air 
Force.  Failure to comply with this manual may place Airmen, Soldiers, and Marines in unsafe 
situations due to lack of proper training and/or equipment, and detract from the effectiveness of 
integrated military operations. 
1.1.1.  The Air Force’s ability to execute Rapid Global Mobility to project and sustain joint 
force capabilities during full-spectrum, joint, all-domain operations is a vital instrument of 
national power.  The characteristics of Rapid Global Mobility—speed, flexibility, range, and 
responsiveness—enable commanders to rapidly execute the joint warfighting functions at 
strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war across the ROMO. 
1.1.2.  Due to complexities inherent across the ROMO, close coordination is essential for 
unity of effort.  The integration necessary for effective joint-operations, especially those 
relying on supported and/or supporting relationships, requires purposeful effort, targeted 
training, technical and technological interoperability, and planning.  Command relationships 
and increased operational complexity require the capabilities provided by AMLOs. 
1.1.3.  Liaison officers from supporting to supported commanders at service and joint staffs, 
joint task forces, and service components of joint forces are essential in determining needs 
and coordinating actions to achieve effective joint and service integration and fusion of 
effects in support of operational objectives. 
1.1.4.  By mutual agreement between Commander, United States Transportation Command 
(USTRANSCOM) and Commandant of the United States Marine Corps (USMC), and by 
mutual agreement between Chief of Staff of the Army and Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the 
Air Force maintains AMLOs to facilitate inter-service communication and coordination for 
effective integration of USAF-assigned, allocated, attached, and commercially augmenting 
air mobility capabilities into joint planning and operations in-garrison and when deployed 
during exercises and in support of combat operations, Defense Support of Civil Authorities 
(DSCA), and HA/DR operations. 
1.2.  Purpose.  In carrying out AMLO operations, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force: 
1.2.1.  Implements the Memorandum of Agreement Between the United States Army and the 
United States Air Force for Army/Air Force Liaison Support and the Memorandum of 
Understanding for Exchange of Liaison Officers between the Commander, USTRANSCOM 
and the Commandant, USMC.  Members may obtain copies of these documents from 
AMC/A34. 
1.2.2.  Selects, organizes, trains, equips, employs, and sustains AMLOs to perform joint 
operations integration required to execute joint warfighting functions using USTRANSCOM- 
and USAF-assigned, attached, and/or allocated, and commercially contracted fixed-wing 
airlift across the ROMO, with primary focus on joint force movement and maneuver and 
sustainment operations. 
6 
AFMAN13-106  7 DECEMBER 2020 
1.2.3.  Develops rated Mobility Air Forces (MAF) officers with joint operations integrative 
capabilities and joint operations competencies able to lead and deliver air mobility effects 
across full-spectrum, joint, all-domain operations.  Through AMLO training and experiences, 
rated MAF officers gain a detailed understanding of air power, service component planning 
and operations, Joint Warfighting, Joint Planning and Execution, the Global Mobility 
Enterprise, and Joint and Service Mission Command. 
1.2.4.  Integrates Rapid Global Mobility with fire support and maneuver units to deliver air 
mobility effects across full-spectrum joint and combined operations environments. 
1.3.  Definition.  An AMLO is a rated Air Force officer with primary experience in a MAF 
Major Weapon System who is organized, trained, equipped, supported, and positioned as a joint 
air-ground integrator for airlift capabilities across all warfighting functions, primarily movement 
and maneuver and sustainment operations, across the ROMO.  AMLOs are the direct 
representative of the commander with operational control (OPCON) and/or tactical control 
(TACON) of airlift forces to supported commanders. 
1.4.  Support to Joint, Special, and/or Combined Operations.  AMLOs support commanders’ 
decision making and mission command by advising and assisting all joint commanders and staffs 
on the optimum, safe use of air mobility assets.  AMLOs ensure close coordination to provide 
shared understanding, strengthen trust between component commanders and their agencies 
during all operational phases.  Their primary focus is to ensure the supported commanders’ 
desired effects through optimizing information sharing and assisting supporting commanders’ 
efforts to employ the full spectrum of the air mobility enterprise. 
1.4.1.  In coordination with joint service commanders, USAF component commanders situate 
AMLOs at decision nodes where supported commanders make utilization and prioritization 
decisions for their use of USTRANSCOM contracted commercial and USAF fixed-wing 
airlift.  This enables execution of warfighting functions, primarily joint functions of 
movement and maneuver and sustainment, across the continuum of conflict and military 
operations. 
1.4.2.  USAF component commanders will ensure the distribution of AMLOs will support 
day-to-day, contingency and wartime missions across the ROMO.  AMLOs are most 
effective by providing support at the operational level, but may execute tactical level 
operations that support operational or strategic campaign objectives.  USAF component 
commanders will position and/or collocate AMLOs to support commanding generals and 
staffs of: select standing and temporary Coalition and/or Joint Task Forces; Land 
Components; Special Operations Components to include Joint Special Operations Command; 
Numbered Armies; Army Service Component Commands; Marine Expeditionary Forces and 
their Major Subordinate Commands; Army Corps, Division, Theater & Expeditionary 
Sustainment Commands; specified brigade combat teams and regiments.  Air Mobility 
Command (AMC), Director of Operations and Nuclear Deterrence (AMC/A3/10) also 
embeds AMLOs within joint service organizations that sponsor and provide targeted joint 
operations training.  AMLOs may support other unit types or agencies if the requirement is 
validated by AMC/A3/10 and sourcing capability exists. 
1.4.3.  AMLOs will continuously examine air mobility operations and voice enterprise 
concerns to air mobility leadership or controlling entities, such as Combined/Joint Force Air 
Component Commanders (C/JFACC), Component-Major Command (C-MAJCOM) 
AFMAN13-106  7 DECEMBER 2020

commanders, A3s, and A4s, Component-Numbered Air Force (C-NAF) commanders, 618th 
Air Operation Center (AOC) commander (618 AOC/CC), directors of theater AOCs, and/or 
theater Air Mobility Divisions (AMD) and their staffs. 
1.4.4.  AMLOs are key agents in the execution of all warfighting functions, but they are 
primarily focused on movement and maneuver and sustainment, across the continuum of 
conflict and full spectrum military operations.  As such, they are organized and empowered 
to serve as the primary authoritative voice on air mobility issues within the supported 
organizations in garrison and when those units are deployed as service component 
commands, tactical units, and/or Joint Task Forces.  In this role, they advise the supported 
ground and Joint commanders and communicate their intent and priorities.  Their goal is 
always to coordinate and facilitate supporting actions by USTRANSCOM- and theater-
assigned, attached, and/or allocated air mobility forces. 
1.5.  Military Essentiality Status and Priority.  Through its service components, the 
Department of Defense (DoD) identifies and prioritizes essential military manpower, materiel, 
and programs to ensure proper management and allocation of critical resources. 
1.5.1.  AMLOs aligned with Army or USMC units with operational deployment requirements 
are designated military essential IAW AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization, paragraph 
3.3.3 and paragraph 3.3.5. 
1.5.2.  AMLO positions do not require active engagement in combat; however, their duties 
are critical to combat operational success and may expose personnel to hostile action. 
1.6.  Waivers.  Unless otherwise noted, waiver authority for this manual is AMC/A3/10.  
Coordinate waiver requests through the appropriate Major Command (MAJCOM) Director of 
Operations (A3) to AMC/A3/10 for action.  AMC Mobility Support Operations Division

training requirements that specifically apply to AMLOs.  These tables do not include or replace 
any training required by AOR-specific pre-deployment requirements or other applicable AFIs 
with the exception of FC-H. 
3.5.1.  An AMLO is considered CMR when all IQT, MQT, and deployment Enabler “YR” 
requirements are satisfactorily accomplished and tracked in MAJCOM-approved training 
management systems.  AMLOs may not deploy to a declared combat zone unless they are 
combat mission ready. 
3.5.2.  The parent unit commander is responsible for granting initial CMR status and 
formally AMC/A34 in writing.  At a minimum, this notification will include the following 
information: unit commander and member names, grades, organization, aligned units, and

3.5.3.5.  Conduct M-4 night firing familiarization training using night vision devices.  (T-
2). 
3.5.3.6.  Units may develop theater or aligned unit-specific CMR requirements. 
3.6.  CT.  AMLOs will maintain ancillary and recurring training requirements IAW AFI 36-
2670, Total Force Development, this regulation, and any CT guidance as published by the 
MAJCOM.  (T-2). For training requirements identified as dependent upon an AEF cycle 
assignment, AMLOs are designated Enablers and will schedule individual training accordingly to 
meet the deployment timelines of their supported unit.  (T-2). 
AFMAN13-106  7 DECEMBER 2020 
23 
3.6.1.  Parent unit commanders, directors of operations, Unit Training Managers, Unit 
Deployment Managers or the AMLOQC instructors will verify recurring CT has been 
accomplished and logged in the MAJCOM approved training management resource.  (T-2). 
3.6.2.  Jump qualified AMLOs assigned to airborne units will maintain jump proficiency 
IAW AFI 10-3503, Personnel Parachute Program.  (T-2). 
3.6.3.  AMC/A34 will issue more detailed CT guidance on an as-needed basis to meet 
requirements of MAJCOM-directed full-spectrum readiness requirements. 
3.6.4.  DZCO and DZSO.  In order to maintain currency as a DZCO and/or DZSO, all 
AMLOs must set up a DZ IAW AFI 13-217 on a signed AF Form 3823, or theater AOC 
approved DZ, once every 12 months.  (T-3). This event can be dual-logged with an 
integrated mission scenario.  In the event an AMLO does not fulfill this requirement, 
refresher training will be received from a currently qualified DZCO or DZSO) and an AF 
Form 4304, Drop Zone/Landing Zone Control Log, and AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional 
Training Accomplishment Report (or unit-approved currency tracking system) will be 
accomplished.  A noncurrent AMLO will not function as a DZCO until refresher training has 
been accomplished IAW paragraph 3.7. (T-2). During contingency operations, waiver 
authority rests with the air component commander who has OPCON of the flying unit 
conducting the airdrop, typically the MAJCOM A3. 
3.6.5.  LZSO.  In order to maintain currency as an LZSO, AMLOs must evaluate and 
establish a semi-prepared runway operations (SPRO) LZ IAW AFI 13-217 and additional Air 
Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) on a signed AF Form 3822, or theater 
AOC approved LZ, once every 12 months.  (T-3). This event can be dual logged with an 
integrated mission scenario.  (T-3).  In the event an AMLO does not fulfill this requirement, 
refresher training will be received from a currently qualified LZSO and an AF Form 4304 
and AF Form 1522 (or unit-approved currency tracking system) will be accomplished.  (T-3). 
A noncurrent AMLO may not function as an LZSO until refresher training has been 
accomplished IAW paragraph 3.7. Failure to maintain this currency does not preclude an 
AMLO from establishing an LZ on a paved surface.  Waiver authority for training is the 
MAJCOM A3.  During contingency operations, waiver authority rests with the air 
component commander who has OPCON of the flying unit conducting the LZ operations, 
typically the MAJCOM A3.  An LZ event will include the following subtasks: 
3.6.5.1.  Semi-prepared Airfield Condition Index (SPACI) evaluation. 
3.6.5.2.  Dynamic Cone Penetrator (DCP) application to determine California Bearing 
Ratio (CBR) compared to the signed AF Form 3822. 
3.6.5.3.  Establishment of LZ markings IAW AFI 13-217 on a signed AF Form 3822. 
3.6.6.  Advanced Radio Operations.  AMLOs will utilize advanced communications on all 
UTC radios IAW the table below.  (T-3). These events can be dual-logged with an integrated 
mission scenario.  Advanced communications involves programming, loading of 
Communications 
Security 
(COMSEC) 
cryptovariables, 
setup, 
and 
establishing 
communication with any other station utilizing any waveform of BLOS/Satellite 
communications (SATCOM) and either Secure or HAVEQUICK VHF/UHF Line of

3.6.7.  Integrated Mission Scenario (IMS).  In order to maintain qualifications to perform 
LZSO or DZCO functions, all AMLOs must conduct either LZSO or DZCO operations with 
aircraft (fixed wing or rotary wing) once annually.  (T-3). Parent unit commanders should 
ensure an IMS event occurs at a large scale exercise with multiple aircraft or multiple passes.  
(T-3).  If an AMLO completes an IMS with either DZ operations or LZ operations, the 
subsequent annual CT event should include either a DZ or LZ event not previously 
accomplished.  (T-3).  As an annual requirement, squadron operations officer or equivalent 
may extend this event an additional 6 months; with consideration for an AMLOs aviation 
experience.  Note: AMLOs from strategic airlift or air refueling Major Weapon Systems 
typically do not have the same level of experience or familiarity with DZ/LZ ground or air 
operations or tactical considerations. 
3.6.7.1.  An IMS event will include the following subtasks: 
3.6.7.1.1.  Power-on, configuration, and use of all 7E1xx AMLO UTC air-to-ground 
radio models.  (T-2).  Radio operations will include either HAVEQUICK, secure, or 
BLOS communications to the max extent possible.  (T-2).

the AMLO. 
3.6.7.2.  An IMS event will include at least one of the following: 
3.6.7.2.1.  LZ operations: AMLOs must validate LZ conditions, set up LZ IAW AFI 
13-217, establish air to ground radio communication, including pre-briefed 
contingencies with landing aircraft, and operate the LZ for at least one landing.  (T-
2). 
3.6.7.2.2.  DZ operations: AMLOs must establish DZ markings IAW AFI 13-217, 
establish air-to-ground radio communication, including pre-briefed contingencies 
with airdrop aircraft, and controlling at least one drop.  (T-2). 
3.6.8.  AMLOs will remain current in Air Force ancillary and mobility (e.g., CBRN and Law 
of Armed Conflict) training requirements IAW AFI 36-2670 through their parent unit or 
closest Air Force installation.  (T-2). 
AFMAN13-106  7 DECEMBER 2020 
25 
3.6.9.  For all weapons training, AMLOs will comply with arming Group A requirements, 
IAW AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms Program.  (T-2).  AMLOs will conduct day fire 
qualification and night fire familiarization on a 12-month currency for both M4 and M9 for 
the duration of an AMLO assignment using MAJCOM approved and issued weapons, sights, 
and laser aiming devices.  (T-2). 
3.6.10.  AMLO should accomplish CT for combat skills at least semi-annually.  (T-2).  CT 
for combat skills may be accomplished IAW Air Force requirements via a supported service 
refresher training course (Army or Marine Corps equivalent course).  For equivalent service 
courses, parent units will accomplish a validation letter documenting the training and send it 
to the AMLO’s parent MAJCOM A3 for coordination and approval by Air Education and 
Training Command, Director of Operations (AETC/A3).  (T-2). Send copies of AETC-
approved service equivalent courses to AMC/A34 at amc.a34i.org@scott.af.mil.  (T-2). 
3.6.11.  All AMLOs will remain CMR for the duration of their assignment.  (T-3). CMR 
qualified AMLOs must have completed recurring CT requirements or the AMLO is referred 
to the commander for appropriate remedial action or disciplinary IAW AFI 36-2101, 
Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  (T-2). 
3.7.  Extensions. 
3.7.1.  Squadron commanders are authorized to grant one 30-day MQT or CT extension.  The 
AMLOs’ parent wing commanders are authorized to grant a second 30-day MQT or CT 
extension.  The AMLO’s parent MAJCOM FAMs (O-6 minimum) are authorized to grant a 
third 30-day MQT or CT extension. 
3.7.2.  If a CT extension is granted, AMLOs will remain CMR while completing missed CT 
requirements.  (T-2). 
3.7.3.  Commanders will ensure MQT and/or CT extensions are documented in the AMLO’s 
training record.  (T-2). 
3.8.  Non-CMR (N-CMR).  If an AMLO fails to complete all CT requirements and is not 
extended IAW paragraph 3.7, then the AMLO becomes N-CMR and must re-qualify.  (T-3).  
The N-CMR AMLO must satisfactorily accomplish the delinquent CT courses or tasks to re-
qualify.  Requalification will be documented in the AMLO’s training record.  (T-2). 
3.9.  AMLO Flying. 
3.9.1.  AMLOs on active flight status will maintain currency IAW applicable aircraft model 
designation series directives.  (T-3).  Active AMLO authorizations are dependent on flying 
billet availability, assignment location, MAJCOM policy and availability of aircraft for 
training.  The intent of the AMLO remaining in a flying status is to ensure operational 
currency and to maintain a network amongst the flying community. 
3.9.2.  AMLOs in flying positions shall seek attachment for flying IAW DAFMAN 11-401 
and applicable MAJCOM supplements.  (T-1).  AMLOs assigned to AMC will contact 
AMC, Aircrew Force Management Branch (AMC/A3TF) prior to attempting attachment to a 
non-AMC unit.  (T-2). 
3.10.  Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC).  Members will be assigned the “11MxU” or 
“12MxU” Duty AFSC, depending on their core AFSC, upon assignment to an AMLO position. 
26

Terms 
Administrative Control (ADCON) (JP1)—ADCON is the direction or exercise of authority 
over subordinate or other organizations with respect to administration and support, including 
organization of service forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel management, 
logistics, individual and unit training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and 
other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations.  
ADCON is synonymous with administration and support responsibilities identified in Title 10, 
USC.  This is the authority necessary to fulfill Military Department statutory responsibilities for 
administration and support.  ADCON may be delegated to and exercised by commanders of 
service forces assigned to a commander at any echelon at or below the level of service 
component command.  ADCON is subject to the command authority of combatant commanders 
(CCDR).  ADCON may be delegated to and exercised by commanders of service commands 
assigned within service authorities.  Service CDRs exercising ADCON will not usurp the 
authorities assigned by a CCDR having Combatant Command (COCOM) over commanders of 
assigned service forces. 
Air Mobility Liaison Officer (AMLO)—A rated Air Force officer with primary experience in a 
Mobility Air Force Major Weapon System who has been, equipped, supported, and positioned as 
a joint air-ground integrator for air movement and maneuver and sustainment operations across 
the range of military operations (ROMO), and as the representative of the commander with 
OPCON of strategic airlift forces to supported commanders. 
Aligned Unit—The designated Army or Marine Corps unit with whom a long term AMLO 
support relationship has been established IAW inter-service memoranda of agreement for liaison 
support. 
AFMAN13-106  7 DECEMBER 2020 
59 
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—The status awarded to an individual who completes IQT and 
MQT, local indoctrination, and deployed AOR-required training and is certified by the 
commander (Chapter 3). 
Continuation Training (CT)—Required to maintain duty position qualification and proficiency. 
Coordinating Authority (JP 1)—Commanders or individuals may exercise coordinating 
authority at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command.  Coordinating authority is 
the authority delegated to a CDR or individual for coordinating specific functions and activities 
involving forces of two or more Military Departments, two or more joint force components, or 
two or more forces of the same service (e.g., joint security coordinator exercises coordinating 
authority for joint security area operations among the component commanders).  Coordinating 
authority may be granted and modified through a memorandum of agreement to provide unity of 
command and unity of effort for operations involving Reserve Component and Active 
Component forces engaged in interagency activities.  The commander or individual has the 
authority to require consultation between the agencies involved but does not have the authority to 
compel agreement.  The common task to be coordinated will be specified in the establishing 
directive without disturbing the normal organizational relationships in other matters.  
Coordinating authority is a consultation relationship between commanders, not an authority by 
which command may be exercised.  It is more applicable to planning and similar activities than 
to operations.  Coordinating authority is not in any way tied to force assignment.  Assignment of 
coordinating authority is based on the missions and capabilities of the commands or 
organizations involved. 
Direct Liaison Authorized (DIRLAUTH) (JP 1)—DIRLAUTH is that authority granted by a 
CDR (any level) to a subordinate to directly consult or coordinate an action with a command or 
agency within or outside of the granting command.  DIRLAUTH is more applicable to planning 
than operations and always carries with it the requirement of keeping the CDR granting 
DIRLAUTH informed.  DIRLAUTH is a coordination relationship, not an authority through 
which command may be exercised. 
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—A formal training process designed to initially qualify an 
individual to perform their duty position requirements without regard to unit’s operational 
mission. 
Liaison (DoD)—The contact or intercommunication maintained between elements of military 
forces to ensure mutual understanding and unity of purpose and action. 
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of 
competence in a unit’s primary tasked missions.  This training is a prerequisite for CMR status. 
Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR)—The status CMR individuals are placed in after 
failing to complete academic and/or proficiency training or currency requirements within the 
allotted training cycle. 
Operational Control (OPCON) (JP 1)—OPCON is the command authority that may be 
exercised by CDRs at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command and may be 
delegated within the command.  When forces are transferred between combatant commands, the 
command relationship the gaining CDR will exercise (and the losing CDR will relinquish) over 
these forces must be specified by the SecDef. 
60 
AFMAN13-106  7 DECEMBER 2020 
Operating Location (OL)—An Army or Marine Corps installation to which an AMLO is 
assigned in support of specific Army or Marine Corps ground maneuver unit(s).  OLs are 
assigned to AMC units as OLs for command.  Normally OLs are permanently supported at 
Division levels and higher.  Separate infantry brigades or regiments are also authorized OL 
AMLOs. 
Parent Unit—AMC, USAFE or PACAF unit of assignment.  An AMC AMLO’s parent unit will 
be the 621st Contingency Response Wing, 19th Airlift Wing, or the USAF Expeditionary 
Operations School. 
Supported Unit—The Army or Marine Corps unit with whom an AMLO support relationship 
has been established by the appropriate C-NAF in a directive or order.  The term “supported 
unit” may also be used to refer to the AMLO’s aligned unit.
