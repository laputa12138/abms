Chapter I 
NONLETHAL WEAPONS 
1. Key Terms and Scope
a. Nonlethal capabilities – Capabilities that temporarily incapacitate personnel
and materiel while minimizing the likelihood of casualties and damage to critical
infrastructure.
b. Nonlethal weapons (NLW) – Weapons, devices, and munitions that are
explicitly designed and primarily employed to temporarily incapacitate targeted
personnel or materiel immediately, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to
personnel, and undesired damage to property in the target area. NLW are
intended to have relatively reversible effects on personnel and materiel, according
to Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 3000.03E, DoD Executive Agent for
Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW), and NLW Policy.
c. Nonlethal capability sets (NLCS) – A family of kits that incorporate nonlethal
weapons and devices shown in appendix D. NLCS are designated kits for specific
functions such as entry control point (ECP) operations, confrontation
management, riot or crowd control, and checkpoint operations.  Note - The USAF
no longer maintains NLCS.  NLW are integrated into Unit Type Code kits to
support expeditionary operations including ECP Operations and Confrontation
Management.
Note: The scope of this publication is to cover the tactical employment of NLW and 
NLCS as defined above. This publication does not discuss every intermediate force 
capability (e.g., directed energy, electromagnetic warfare, information) that can produce 
nonlethal effects along the competition continuum. Joint Publications (JPs) such as JP 
3-0, Joint Campaigns and Operations; JP 3-04, Information in Joint Operations; JP 3-
09, Joint Fire Support; JP 3-12, Joint Cyberspace Operations; JP 3-13.2, Military
Information Support Operations; and other joint guides, concepts, and organizations
such as the Joint Concept for Competing, and the individual Service NLW programs
should be consulted when planning the use of intermediate force.
2. NLW Application in an Operational Environment
a. NLW are desired across most operational environments to enhance global joint
and multinational operations as a complement to lethality across the force while
minimizing the risk of permanent injury, death, or unnecessary physical
destruction.
b.
NLW have many applications. Integrating NLW into urban operations, security,
convoy protection, and civil disturbance operations should comply with host nation
law in foreign countries and should be coordinated with the appropriate authorities
when employed domestically. Carefully plan and coordinate NLW use to ensure
compliance with all applicable laws, treaties, and agreements regarding
employment of NLW, munitions, riot control agents (RCAs), and dazzling devices
(e.g., laser-based systems). Integrating the staff judge advocate (SJA) into

30 October 2024 
AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
planning efforts for NLW employment is vital to facilitate legal compliance. 
Employment considerations are discussed in depth in Chapter III.  
c. The joint force commander, operating in complex environments, often lacks
sufficient capability to immediately neutralize targets without causing permanent
injury, death, or gross physical destruction. NLW are a set of tools commanders
and planners may use to fill this gap.
(1) NLW are developed and employed with the intent of de-escalation and
deterrence of hostile intent and actions. Military planners should include NLW
within operational plans and strategic communication to minimize cultural
misperceptions, deny misinformation, and gain the trust of the populace.
(2) Some benefits of NLW planning include:
(a) Enabling lower-risk tools.
(b) Imposing opportunity costs on adversaries with less risk of escalation.
(c) Maintaining credibility in the information space across the competition
continuum.
(d) Expanding decision time and space.
(e) Allowing the warfighter to determine intent at a greater standoff range.
(f) Facilitating logistics operations in a contested environment.
(g) Enabling decisive recon/counter-recon operations below the level of
armed conflict.
(3) NLW enhance the commander’s ability to:
(a) Determine, deter, discourage, delay, or prevent hostile and
threatening actions.
(b) Deny access to, move, disable, and suppress individuals.
(c) Stop, disable, divert, and deny access of vehicles and vessels.
(d) Adapt and tailor escalation of force (EOF) options to the operational
environment.
(e) Employ capabilities that temporarily incapacitate personnel and
materiel while minimizing the likelihood of casualties and damage to critical
infrastructure.
(f) De-escalate situations precluding the use of lethal force.
(g) Capture or incapacitate high-value targets.
(h) Protect the force.

CAUTION 
All operating environments have the potential for escalation or 
unintended consequences. For this reason, nonlethal force should 
never be applied without both the capacity and willingness to use 
lethal force if necessary to maintain a credible deterrence.   
The availability of NLW will not limit the commander’s inherent 
right or obligation to exercise unit self-defense in response to a 
hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent, or to individually use 
lethal force when authorized by competent authority pursuant to 
the rules of engagement (ROE) or rules for the use of force 
(RUF). NLW should be integrated into joint and Service concepts 
and operations plans, ROE, and RUF. 
Using NLW does not eliminate and may not even lower risk of 
escalation, collateral damage, or unintended consequences 
including lethal consequences. Planning for NLW requires 
considerations of intended and unintended effects both in the 
physical space and the cognitive domain for how the adversary 
perceives the use of NLW.  
3. Current Nonlethal Weapons Policy
a. Instruction. Standing Rules of Engagement/Standing Rules for the Use of
Force for US Forces, according to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
instruction (CJCSI) 3121.01B, 18 June 2008*, provides guidance on the standing
rules of engagement (SROE) and establishes standing rules for the use of force
(SRUF) for DoD operations worldwide. The SROE establishes fundamental
policies and procedures governing the actions taken by US commanders and their
forces during all military operations and contingencies occurring outside a US
territory. ROE are restrictions on the use of force issued by the chain of command
to delineate circumstances and limitations under which forces initiate or continue
combat engagement with other forces. Specific ROE will change based on the
area of responsibility, operational environment, and mission.
* CJCSI 3121.0B, 18 June 2008 is currently under a doctrinal change review to address
SROE/SRUF.
b. Law. The US ratified the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use
of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively
Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, specifically Protocol IV (commonly
referred to as the prohibition on blinding laser weapons). This agreement prohibits
using lasers designed with the specific combat function of causing permanent
blindness to unenhanced vision.

30 October 2024 
AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
(1) Nonlethal lasers designed to warn and suppress individuals do not fit the
criteria of a blinding laser under the prohibition on using blinding lasers.
(2) Use of several nonlethal lasers should be covered within any ROE or
RUF, however, commanders should be aware that using some capabilities
not specifically designed as NLW could violate international law or US policy.
For example, laser designators for many weapon systems are not intended
for use as nonlethal lasers because they could cause permanent blindness.
(3) Authorized nonlethal lasers must be used within approved parameters to
avoid unintentional permanent eye damage. If those targeted by nonlethal
lasers are engaged in activities, such as operating aircraft, they could lose
control of the craft and suffer lethal consequences.
c. RCAs. Using RCAs may be restricted by treaty, HN law, and US law. Prior to
using RCAs, commanders are encouraged to become familiar with:
(1) The treaty titled, Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their
Destruction.
(2) Local government and HN rules for using RCAs.
(3) Theater-specific ROE regarding RCAs.
(4) Executive Order 11850 dated 8 Apr 1975, Renunciation of certain uses in
war of chemical herbicides and RCAs.
d. Civilian harm mitigation and reduction action plan (CHMR-AP) policy:
(1) On January 27, 2022, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum
directing the creation of a CHMR-AP to improve how the DoD mitigates and
responds to civilian harm resulting from military operations.
(2) The CHMR-AP is a flexible plan that advances the ability of DoD to
mitigate civilian harm and achieve strategic success across the competition
continuum. It is relevant to both kinetic and non-kinetic activity and is located
at https://media.defense.gov/2022/Aug/25/2003064740/-1/-1/1/civilian-harm1-

Chapter II 
NONLETHAL WEAPONS CORE CAPABILITIES 
1. Support to Military Operations
NLW support all phases of military operations across the competition continuum. 
Nonlethal capabilities have application in operations where there is the need to enhance 
a commander’s ability to apply force proportional to the threat and a desire to protect 
noncombatants, promote international political support, alleviate environmental 
concerns, and enhance post-conflict transitions and termination. Examples of missions 
where NLW complement lethal force include but are not limited to: 
a. Convoy security in urban operations where population density and
characteristics of the area require carefully employing force to minimize loss of
life and destruction of property.
b. Crowd control and civil disturbance operations where nonlethal munitions,
protective equipment, and support equipment enable warfighters to execute
missions while minimizing collateral damage and injury to military personnel.
Some basic protective equipment is listed in Appendix C.
c. Cordon and search operations where friendly forces come in close contact
with the local population under stressful, and often hostile, circumstances.
d. Checkpoint operations where nonlethal capabilities protect friendly forces and
improve public opinion and acceptance.
e. In detainee operations where all displays of violence must be brought under
control quickly while avoiding unnecessary injury or death to detainees.
2. Core Capabilities
NLW can be divided into two core functions, counterpersonnel and countermaterial, as 
specified in the Initial Capabilities Document for Counterpersonnel Joint Non-Lethal 
Effects and Initial Capabilities Document for Countermaterial Joint Non-Lethal Effects, 
verified 7 April 2014.  
a. Nonlethal counterpersonnel capabilities deliver effects that deny, move,
disable, or suppress individuals. Table 1 depicts nonlethal counterpersonnel
capability tasks.

30 October 2024 
AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
Table 1.  Counterpersonnel Tasks 
Deny access into or out of an area. This task focuses on the ability of a joint 
force to prevent individuals from entering or exiting an area. 
Move individuals through an area. This task reflects several different situations, 
such as the ability to move individuals on foot. It also includes the ability to move 
individuals out of buildings and other facilities. 
Disable individuals. This task reflects situations where the joint force must totally 
affect the ability of an individual to take voluntary action. 
Suppress individuals. This task reflects the requirement to affect individuals in 
some manner short of disabling them. 
AN EXAMPLE OF NONLETHAL COUNTERPERSONNEL EFFECTS: 
COMPRESSED AIR LAUNCHER EMPLOYMENT DURING OVERSEAS 
CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS 
The compressed air launcher systems are an effective counterpersonnel 
capability for perimeter security and security of assets. The systems were 
employed in 2017 at several operating bases in Afghanistan, in support of 
Operation FREEDOM’S SENTINEL, to keep civilians from breaching base 
perimeters, prevent theft or damage of mission-sensitive equipment, and mark 
individuals for later identification/apprehension. 
   SOURCE: Task Force Spartan, 2017 
b. Nonlethal countermateriel capabilities deliver effects to stop, deny, temporarily
disable, or divert materiel targets (i.e., vehicles, vessels, aircraft, buildings,
facilities, structures, and weapon systems). Nonlethal countermateriel effects
must be immediate and reversible according to DoDD 3000.03E, DoD Executive
Agent for Non-Lethal Weapons and NLW Policy. Table 2 depicts nonlethal
countermateriel capability tasks.

AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
19 
Table 2.  Countermateriel Tasks 
Stop a vehicle, vessel, fixed-wing aircraft on the ground. Stopping a vehicle 
requires the target’s momentum, by any means, to be at zero within identified 
standards. The requirement to stop a vessel is achieved when the vessel is dead 
in the water. For aircraft on the ground, stop requires the aircraft to come to 0 
miles per hour at some point between when it starts to taxi and when it reaches 
abort speed. 
Divert aircraft in the air. This task requires NLW directed at the aircraft, not the 
pilot. Nonlethal effects must result in the aircraft changing directions but 
maintaining the ability to safely maneuver in flight and land. 
Deny access to a facility. This task focuses on preventing a vehicle, vessel, 
aircraft, or individuals from entering a facility through designed access or entry 
points, such as building doors and windows; and access control points, such as 
canal locks, pier slips or hangar entrances. Nonlethal effects must directly affect 
a component of the facility, such as a door, and excludes nonlethal effects that 
directly affect vehicles, vessels, aircraft, or individuals. 
Disable vehicles, vessels, and aircraft on the ground. Disable implies the vehicle, 
vessel, or aircraft is not in motion. The requirement to disable a countermateriel 
target includes actions to render it inoperable, deny its use, and deny access to 
it. Disabling a target has a direct effect on the functionality of the countermateriel 
target. 
3. Fielded Capabilities
a. Nonlethal counterpersonnel capabilities. Capabilities employed to perform
operational tasks and enable nonlethal counterpersonnel effects are detailed in
the following paragraphs. Figure 1 on page 9 details the effective engagement
areas of these NLW. Table 7 in Appendix B contains ordering and employment
information for each capability.
(1) RCA dispensers. These handheld dispensers deliver a variable range,
single stream, foam, or fog of RCA irritants against targets, used to control
crowds, or to control detainees.
(2) Human electro-muscular incapacitation (HEMI). The HEMI device
launches two electrified probes capable of delivering an electrical charge to a
target.
(3) Modular crowd control munition (MCCM). This is similar in appearance to
the lethal Claymore mine. The MCCM delivers blunt-trauma effects from 5 to
15 meters via 600 rubber balls.
(4) Rubber ball grenade. A hand thrown grenade, 12-gauge shotgun round,
or 40 mm grenade launcher round that delivers an airburst flash bang and
blunt force trauma via rubber pellets.

30 October 2024 
AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
(5) Flash bang grenade. A hand thrown grenade that delivers a bright flash
(optical effect) and loud bang (acoustic effect) to disorient potential targets or
control crowds.
(6) Hand-thrown RCA grenade. A hand thrown grenade that delivers an
irritant or blunt-pain compliance impact payload for disorienting potential
targets or controlling crowds.
(7) Compressed air launchers. A compressed air-powered launcher delivers
a variety of projectiles, including blunt impact, marking, and chemical irritants,
such as oleoresin capsicum (OC) liquid.
(8) Twelve-gauge nonlethal munitions. These shotgun munitions deliver
counterpersonnel, blunt-trauma effects against individuals and groups. The
12-gauge munitions variants include crowd dispersal, fin stabilized, and sock
rounds.
(9) Twelve-gauge, nonlethal, warning munitions (100- and 200-meter
variants). These shotgun rounds are designed to deliver a flash-bang effect
over water at ranges of 100 or 200 meters. They provide personnel a way to
hail, warn, or determine intent before the need to escalate to higher levels of
force.
(10) 40 mm munitions. These munitions deliver counterpersonnel, blunt-
trauma effects against individuals and crowds by using low velocity, 40 mm
individual grenade launchers. Munition variants include sponge rounds and
crowd dispersal cartridges.
(11) 40 mm warning munitions (100-, 200-, and 300-meter variants). These
rounds are designed to deliver a flash-bang effect at 100, 200, or 300 meters.
(12) 66 mm tubed-launched nonlethal grenades. This is a tube-launched
munition delivering multi-grenade salvos. Variants include munitions
containing smoke, flash-bang effects, RCAs, and blunt-trauma payloads.
(13) Acoustic Hailing Device (AHD). A device delivering scalable and
directional warning tones or intelligible voice commands at various ranges.
(14) Ocular interruption systems. This type of handheld or weapon mounted
laser interdicts potential targets by delivering visible and temporary ocular
impairment effects.
(15) 81 mm flash-bang munition. Munition delivers nonlethal suppressive
effects geared to large crowds in the open or personnel in covered concealed
positions.

Chapter III 
EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS 
1. Advantages of Employing NLW
a. Military units are organized, trained, and equipped to employ lethal force. Units
equipped solely with traditional military weapons have two options to impose their
will: threatening deadly force or applying deadly force. These limited options
represent a potential vulnerability adversaries may exploit. Forces trained in
escalation of force tactics have a greater range of response and may be more
appropriate operate in complex environments than forces emphasizing lethality.
b. The use of NLW is consistent with political and social considerations respecting
human life, and addresses the military consideration to keep collateral damage,
noncombatant, and civilian casualties to a minimum. NLW employment assists in
shaping public perception of the application of force, especially in civil
disturbance, urban, and humanitarian assistance operations. Forces trained in
EOF tactics are better enabled to operate in complex environments than forces
only trained in lethal weapons.
c. NLW may be used with lethal weapon systems to enhance effectiveness and
efficiency in military operations. NLW enable engagement in situations where
lethal force may be counterproductive to established objectives and strategic
goals.
NATIONAL GUARD RESPONSE TO 2015 BALTIMORE RIOTS 
On April 27, 2015, the Maryland National Guard was mobilized to support law 
enforcement to suppress civil unrest and restore order in the city of Baltimore, 
Maryland. Army and Air National Guard personnel, trained in riot control 
techniques and the employment of nonlethal weapons, were integrated into 
police operations. Over the five days of operations, National Guard personnel 
used their nonlethal capability sets to employ crowd control tactics; close range, 
subject-control techniques; and riot control agents and smoke to disperse crowds 
and facilitate the apprehension of persons who failed to comply with lawful 
orders. Many of these close-range and riot-control tactics had been developed 
from Service-specific baseline combatives and martial arts programs and 
rehearsed with NLW training days, facilitated by the Quantico, Virginia based 
Joint Nonlethal Weapons Directorate liaisons, and from lesson modules 
discussed and practiced during the Interservice Nonlethal Individual Weapons 
Instructor Course.

2. Considerations for NLW Employment
a. Before NLW Employment.
(1) Training. In almost all after action reviews involving the lack of
employment or incorrect employment of NLW, commanders and warfighters
reference the lack of training on NLW and understanding of the SROE/SRUF
26 
ATP 3-22.40/MCTP 10-10A/NTTP 3-26.6/ 
30 October 2024 
AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
as one of the main reasons an event unnecessarily escalated. Service 
training processes are covered in Chapter IV. 
(2) Proportional force employment requires a careful and disciplined
balancing of protecting people and infrastructure, conducting military
operations, and achieving the overarching objectives of an operation. A single
act can cause significant military and political consequences; therefore, when
force is used, it must be lawful and measured.  Proportionality is best
achieved when all personnel understand the political objectives and the
potential impact of inappropriate actions, and that ROE are sensitive to
political concerns but consistent with the right and obligation of self-defense.
(3) Mission analysis should consider adversary, public, and third-party
perception, EOF or force continuum* procedures, and the probability of
achieving the desired results when determining the suitability of using NLW
during operations. Each Service has EOF or force continuum procedures
located in their Service doctrine. For the US Army, EOF procedures in a law
enforcement capacity are detailed in AR 190-14.  Army EOF procedures in
other capacities can be found in Graphic Training Aid 19-08-006 and Training
Circular 3-19.5 as well as CJCSI 3121.01B. For the US Marine Corps, force
continuum procedures are detailed in Marine Corps Order 5500.6H chapter 1,
Arming of Law Enforcement and Security Personnel and the Use of Force.
For the US Navy, EOF are explained in Navy Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures 3.07.2.3, Law Enforcement and Physical Security; and for the US
Air Force, Department of the Air Force Instruction 31-117, Arming and Use of
Force by Air Force Personnel. The US Coast Guard, Use of Force Continuum
is defined in the Maritime Law Enforcement Manual, Commandant Instruction
(COMDTINST) M16247.1H.
*Note: The USMC and USN, use the term force continuum which is defined as: The
wide range of possible actions ranging from voice commands to application of deadly
force that may be used to gain and maintain control of a potentially dangerous
situation. (USMC Dictionary).
The USCG defines the Use of Force Continuum as a model that organizes levels of 
force into a graduated scale of risks and outcomes and provides the officer with a 
system for determining appropriate levels of force to be applied when governed by the 
Coast Guard Use of Force Policy, except for those situations involving action to compel 
a vessel to stop. Force used within the context of the Use of Force Continuum is also 
governed by the guiding principles and rules governing use of force set forth in Section 
B of Chapter 4 of the Maritime Law Enforcement Manual, COMDINST M16247.1H. 
The other Services do not use this term, when used in this publication it will follow the 
USMC definition. 
(4) Certain types of NLW capabilities and technologies have secondary or
tertiary effects which are governed by international agreements, treaties, or
the specific nations where operations are to be conducted.  Before employing
NLW, HN and local government policies must be understood and considered.
30 October 2024 
ATP 3-22.40/MCTP 10-10A/NTTP 3-26.6/ 
AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
27 
The appropriate staff element such as the SJA and country team must be 
included in the planning process. Informing the HN and local government 
about NLW capabilities and their employment provides context for 
understanding EOF incidents. The HN and local government leaders should 
understand that the joint force will apply an appropriate level of force as a 
response to perceived threats. 
(5) Some NLW require analysis of transportation and other logistics
considerations to ensure availability for mission needs. A thorough load plan
analysis may be required.
(6) Maintenance and sustainment are paramount for future employment of
assigned NLCS or other NLW. NLW should be treated like all other military
equipment regarding inventories, scheduled maintenance, and ordering of
shortages.
(7) Leaders set the conditions for their subordinates when employing NLW.
They ensure subordinates know how to issue clear warnings and instructions
to persons who approach their positions. Service members must possess the
critical thinking skills to quickly determine if a threat is present, estimate threat
severity, and apply the appropriate force response in ambiguous situations.
These skills are identified, trained, and reinforced by leaders so Service
members apply measured force with confidence.
(8) Leaders build public and adversary perception management into NLW
plans and ROE in ways that minimize the potential for misperception, help
counter mis/disinformation, and retain public trust. Consult with public affairs,
information planners, and the SJA.
b. During NLW Employment:
(1) If possible, attempt to determine hostile intent and prevent further escalation.
NLW can be used throughout the competition continuum as a force multiplier.
EMPLOYMENT OF NONLETHAL 40 MILLIMETER (MM) MUNITIONS IN 
KOSOVO 
In southeastern Kosovo, in April 2000, the United States (US) Army’s Task Force 
Falcon used nonlethal weapons (NLW) in a tactical situation to successfully push 
back a moving crowd. The military police, serving as peacekeepers, used 40 mm 
rounds fired from M203 grenade launchers and foam batons to move a crowd 
during the detention of an area arms smuggler. Though NLW were not dictated 
by any higher guidance, the alternative, being lethal means, would have surely 
caused an international situation as the US force were in the country as 
peacekeepers and only authorized use of force for self-defense. The NLW gave 
the battalion commander a means to take the initiative without making a tense 
situation more violent and dangerous, since the crowd was gathering to protest 
the US forces.

(2) A layered employment of multiple NLW capabilities is more effective than
a single NLW system. For example, if personnel do not comply with initial
hails and warnings, more aggressive measures may be required. Munitions
fired from handheld devices or launched from vehicle-mounted systems are
potential next steps. The US Navy layered defense technique, detailed in the
following vignette, is an example of one method of layered defense using
zones. Figure 3 on page 17 depicts the Navy’s layered defense using zones
and the emplacement of NLW. Various NLW, munitions, and devices that can
be employed in each of these zones are depicted in Figure 4 on page 18.
UNITED STATES NAVY LAYERED DEFENSE TECHNIQUE 
The concept of operations for infrastructure protection describes employing 
nonlethal weapons (NLW) to the maximum extent possible to determine hostile 
intent and deter attack. This is achieved through a defense in depth consisting of 
three zones. The three zones are (1) an assessment zone, (2) a warning zone, 
and (3) a threat zone. 
Assessment Zone. The outermost defense zone, which typically does not have 
boundaries, is the assessment zone. Security forces detect and identify contacts 
(e.g., small boats, pedestrians, and vehicles) as they approach or pass near the 
protected asset or area. In some [places] (e.g., areas outside an installation), 
security forces may not patrol the assessment zone, control access, or challenge 
contacts. To simplify the identification process, those on watch are given current 
access rosters for expected vessels or vehicles (e.g., vendors, fuel barges, and 
pilot boats). 
Warning Zone. Security forces must classify contacts in the warning zone as 
threats or nonthreats. In this zone, security forces initially interact with contacts to 
determine [if there is] hostile intent and provide a physical presence to control 
access to a restricted area. Classification measures and warning zone 
parameters are based on specific threats. For example, a heightened threat of 
pedestrian-carried improvised explosive devices at an entry control point would 
result in a more thorough screening of personnel, each of whom is separated 
from friendly personnel until classified. Standard operating procedures must 
clearly define methods and steps that can be used to determine hostile intent to 
avoid ambiguity and hesitation. 
Threat Zone. The threat zone is the innermost layer of defense in depth. All 
personnel, vehicles, and vessels must be classified as either a threat or 
nonthreat before entering this zone. To neutralize threats, the threat zone must 
be organized to bring NLW, and if necessary, maximum destructive fire, via 
crew-served weapons or other weapons, to bear on targets while minimizing the 
risk of fratricide and damage to assets.

(3) This technique can used be to defend mobile assets (e.g. a vessel at sea
as depicted in Figures 3 and 4), or fixed assets (e.g. a vessel in port or critical
infrastructure, as depicted in the continued vignette below).
LAYERED DEFENSE OF A VESSEL IN PORT 
At a pier entry control point, the gate sentries are positioned in the ship's warning 
zone. They assess personnel/vehicles driving by or approaching the pier as far 
as they can cover based on traffic and environmental conditions. If there is a 
threat of a potential vehicle-born improvised explosive device incident at the 
entry control point, the watch standers would close the entry control point gate, 
activate any barrier, and utilize available NLW as applicable. A long-range 
acoustic device or a ship’s LA/9P laser dazzler could be used to warn personnel 
away from the pier entry control point and inform all personnel to maintain a safe 
distance.

Figure 4. NLW Threat, Warning, and Assessment Zones 
WARNING 
Using NLW alone could place the individual Service member in a 
position of unacceptable risk. Do not use NLW in situations where 
lethal force is imperative for offense, self-defense, or in the 
defense of others. Using lethal force remains an inherent right of 
Service members in instances when they, or personnel in their 
charge, are threatened with death or serious bodily harm. NLW 
augment, but do not supersede, lethal capabilities. 
(4) EOF or force continuum procedures may incorporate NLW but may not be
necessary.
(5) At long ranges, acoustic or ocular devices are employed to warn
individuals. Compliant personnel that heed the warnings require no further
EOF measures. Some acoustic devices contain preprogrammed phrases in
multiple languages.
(6) The effects of NLW vary. See Chapter III paragraph 4(d) for expanded
explanation of various effects on personnel.

(7) Personnel engaged with NLW may respond with an unpredictable
reaction. It is important to consider multiple ways the target may react to the
effects and plan accordingly.

UNITED STATES (US) NAVY’S INTEGRATED USE OF NONLETHAL AND 
LETHAL WEAPONS TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE 
During an escalation of force incident, the US Navy fired warning shots over an 
Iranian patrol boat in 2017 in the northern Persian Gulf. The incident involved the 
USS Thunderbolt, a Cyclone class patrol ship that was conducting exercises in 
the Persian Gulf. 
The Iranian boat approached within 150 yards of the USS Thunderbolt, which 
attempted to hail the boat with radio, and then fired flares and issued warning 
blasts from the ship's siren, an international signal of danger. When the Iranian 
boat failed to respond, the USS Thunderbolt fired warning shots from its 50- 
caliber machine gun, which prompted the Iranian boat to change course and 
leave the vicinity.

Command, 25 July 2017 
c. After NLW Employment
(1) Conduct detainee control measures, if necessary.
(2) Provide medical attention, as appropriate.
(3) Perform immediate and follow on consequence management in addition
to an after-action review. After actions reviews should be routed through
appropriate Service channels. This includes contacting local officials and
preparing media statements.
(4) Conduct inventory of all equipment expended, including nonlethal
munitions and devices.
(5) Coordinate for sustainment support upon completion of mission.
3. NLW Employment Limitations
a. NLW effectiveness and employment options depend on human and
environmental factors. Human factors include psychological state, age,
motivation, and the presence of drugs or alcohol. Some environmental factors
include the effects of weather, terrain, visibility, climate, and time of day. For
example, lasers are more effective at night, while acoustic devices and blunt
impact munitions are less effective and less accurate in windy conditions.
b. Using NLW does not guarantee de-escalation of a situation. Leaders should be
prepared for an adversary to attempt to counter NLW use.

c. NLW and their associated equipment have limited ranges of effectiveness. In
addition, the availability of NLW may be limited based on the unit and mission.
IMPROVING NONLETHAL WEAPONS THROUGH 
AFTER ACTION REVIEWS 
During Operations IRAQI FREEDOM and ENDURING FREEDOM, Marine forces 
noted the effectiveness of green laser pointers and dazzlers as escalation of 
force tools for use at entry and vehicle control points. These tools got the 
attention of individuals approaching the checkpoint without having to fire; 
however, through various lessons learned and after-action comments, it was 
noted that an extended range would be helpful for these devices. 
(Note: Since 2006, these devices’ effective ranges have improved. 
Improvements include extending the effective range and developing employment 
options such as varied color schemes and strobe patterns.)

4. Human Effects Considerations
a. Human Effects. U.S. Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 3200.19, Non-
Lethal Weapons (NLW) Human Effects Characterization, defines the policies,
responsibilities, and procedures for a human effects characterization process in
support of the development of NLW and other nonlethal technologies. Human
effects characterization is the formal process for describing the physiological and
behavioral effects knowledge associated with a given NLW.
b. Human Behavior
(1) The nature of counter-personnel NLW is to influence human behavior.
They aim to incapacitate, deter, distract, suppress, or move a targeted
individual.
(2) Understanding and predicting (to the greatest extent possible) human
behavior is important for tactical success and mission effectiveness. Applying
knowledge of both system technology and knowledge of human behavior will
yield optimum effects.
(3) Understanding what effect employment of specific NLW capabilities has
on intended targets is a planning factor that must be identified by mission
commanders prior to execution. Successful employment of nonlethal
capabilities may be overshadowed by target reaction which is unexpected
and unplanned for. Like any military operation, the end state of environment
and targeted personnel after mission execution should be captured to ensure
that contingencies or counter actions are properly accounted for.
5. Potential Situational Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
a. Unauthorized Entry–Installation ECP

(1) Threat–Potential noncompliant vehicle driver intent: terrorist, criminal,
inattentive (lost), or impatient.
(2) Appropriate NLW
(a) Capabilities must disable and/or stop a small, medium or large vehicle
threat(s); deny base access; and allow time for security forces to assess
level of threat.
(b) Capabilities must be integrated into security forces EOF procedures.
(c) Potential nonlethal capabilities include but are not limited to:
• Portable Vehicle Arresting Barrier
• Final Denial Barriers
• Caltrops
b. Integrated Base Defense
(1) Unauthorized violations of restricted ground or airspace such as:
(a) Mounted or dismounted potential hostiles approach base perimeter or
installation ECP.
(b) Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) observed hovering within
close proximity or over base boundary.
(c) Enemy force fire indirect mortar rounds and strike inside base
perimeter.
(d) Group of hostile protestors congregate outside installation entry
control point shouting and throwing rocks.
(2) Appropriate NLW
(a) Security forces hails and warns employing laser dazzler and AHD.  If
the threat does not heed commands, Security forces escalate their
response and engage the vehicle threat with nonlethal munitions and/or
warning shots or lethal munitions IAW ROE and EOF procedures.
(b) Security forces proactively deploy “blue” sUAS to
reconnaissance/observe/thwart potential threats outside base perimeter;
sUAS is observed near/within perimeter airspace; sUAS is identified as
potential threat, Security forces deploy automatic net gun 40MM rounds
fired from Mk-19, mounted on CROWS to neutralize threat.
(c) Security forces proactively deploy “blue” sUAS to
recon/observe/thwart potential threats outside base perimeter.
(d) Security forces form riot control team using confrontation management
kit; challenging protestors with AHD; employing blunt impact rounds to
target group leaders: 40 mm sponge grenade and crowd dispersal rounds,
stingball grenades, 12-gauge fin stabilize and crowd dispersal rounds.

c. Route clearance or convoy operations
(1) Tactical convoy operations are covered in depth in MTTP for Tactical
Convoy Operations (ATP 4-01.45, MCRP 3-40F.7, NTTP 4-01.6, AFTTP 3-
2.58).
(2) NLW can be used to warn, identify hostile intent or create standoff at a
level of escalation below lethal force.
(3) Planned NLW for route clearance or convoy operations include:
(a) AHDs
(b) Magnetic Audio Device
(c) Dazzling Lasers and Laser Interdiction Systems
(d) Compressed air launcher
(e) Caltrops
d. Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS)
(1) When conducting VBSS the preference is for the target vessel remain a
seaworthy platform to preclude VBSS transitioning into a recovery at sea.
This demand is acute if the desired outcome is to seize vessels, contraband
or persons related to transnational threats; embargoes; or conduct
counterproliferation operations.
(2) NLW can be used to signal the intercepting vessel’s intent to exercise a
right of visit boarding, particularly if radio calls, signal lights, or flag hoist is not
acknowledged. NLW may also be used to disorientate or incapacitate persons
on the target vessel, reducing or eliminating the threat of opposition to the
boarding party.
(3) NLW to consider during VBSS operations may include:
(a) AHDs
(b) Dazzling Lasers
(c) Compressed air launcher
(d) Nonlethal warning munitions
(e) Nonlethal crowd control munitions
e. Humanitarian Assistance (HA) and Disaster Relief (DR) mission sets comprise
a wide range of scenarios in many geographical locations. Common military
problem sets associated with HA and DR can include crowd control, perimeter
defense, and area protection often from noncombatants.
(1) HA and DR planners should plan for appropriate NLW capabilities sets in
Appendix D before HA and DR are required, when possible.

Chapter IV 
TRAINING AND EDUCATION 
1. Fundamental Concepts
a. Successful NLW employment requires effective individual and unit training.
Commanders can integrate NLW capabilities into their unit’s training plans based
on the unit’s mission or required essential task list, even if NLW, munitions, and
devices are not on a unit’s table of equipment.
b. The art of employing NLW involves estimating the potential for escalation of
violence and employing appropriate levels of force without overreacting to
provocation.
c. Physiological reactions to threats often cloud judgment and decrease motor
function. Service members are trained to recognize and regulate their stress
levels. Training should be as realistic as possible. This will help immunize
personnel against stress, ensuring they are confident and proficient with NLW
employment.
d. Instructors should be qualified to facilitate NLW capabilities training at the
individual and unit levels. Each Service determines the appropriate training and
frequency of training to sustain necessary NLW skills.
2. Unit-level NLW Training
a. Unit-level NLW training begins in the classroom, with hands-on instruction. The
training should cover the availability, characteristics, employment considerations,
limitations, and restrictions of NLW. After students understand these basics, NLW
capabilities are integrated into training exercises and operations, specifically,
integrating NLW into training plans when collective tasks are rehearsed.
b. Units should deliberately plan for unique scenarios where NLW are expected
to be employed. An example of an employment consideration checklist for using
NLW is detailed in Appendix E.
c. The Services can receive unit training through mobile training teams taught by
the DoD Inter-Service Nonlethal Individual Weapons Instructor Course (INIWIC)
based at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. NLW training is taught by INIWIC
instructors, and every individual attending training receives a certificate of
completion. The course is limited to 30 personnel on a mobile training team at the
unit’s home station or at INIWIC, Fort Leonard Wood. Units that desire to host an
INIWIC mobile training team (MTT) at their home station must submit a formal
request to the Training and Education Command, Quantico, Virginia. A sample
memorandum of the formal request is in Appendix F.
d. INIWIC is not an MP-specific school. All military occupations may attend the
INIWIC. Units hosting an INIWIC MTT will review their Service-specific, NLCS for
INIWIC-required equipment before the MTT’s arrival. Also, hosting units should
contact their installation’s local MP unit for assistance with acquiring any missing
38 
ATP 3-22.40/MCTP 10-10A/NTTP 3-26.6/ 
30 October 2024 
AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
INIWIC-required equipment. (The course instruction for INIWIC will be discussed 
later in the chapter). 
e. After action reviews from deployed units indicate classroom-only instruction is
inadequate. Classroom training, which can be characterized as the “crawl” phase,
should be accompanied by practical exercises requiring Service members to
employ NLW. Hands-on experience during training, such as range days to use
NLW, munitions, and devices, is a key component of the “walk” phase. The “run”
phase includes conducting a dry fire exercise and completing a scenario-based
training event, which includes multiple NLW. These events solidify comprehension
and user proficiency. Some recommendations for each of the various “crawl, walk,
run phases” are:
(1) Hold a 30-minute wargaming session at all levels and across occupational
skills.
(2) Perform routine gun drills, which may include one-day individual range
time to test and gain comfort with multiple NLW. If there are no certified NLW
instructors within the unit to teach this and no INIWIC MTT available, this
training can be coordinated through the base law enforcement units who may
be willing to instruct others and may have the equipment.
(3) Hold follow-on scenario training incorporating medical procedures, such
as NLW-related injury treatment (e.g., blunt force trauma, shock, internal
bleeding) into NLW training.
f. NLW training should be accompanied by ROE, RUF, EOF, and continuum of
force training. Incorporating those considerations helps Service members
determine whether hostile intent exists and the appropriate response to a given
threat. By learning these skills prior to execution, Service members deploy armed
with the necessary tools to act quickly and appropriately. Repeat this training to
maximize proficiency and retention. Unit training, which combines multiple NLW in
a scenario is the culmination exercise.
g. NLW employment may result in unintended consequences. NLW training
should address these possibilities and provide mitigation and consequence
management solutions.
h. Leverage staff components to enhance the realism and accuracy of NLW
training. Examples of how the different staff components facilitate and enhance
NLW training follow:
(1) Medical personnel provide an understanding of OC decontamination
requirements, HEMI exposures, and potential injuries resulting from other
NLW employment. Often, medical personnel can treat NLW injuries with their
authorized unit equipment, but they must be informed which NLW will be
included in the training to prepare for any necessary medical treatment.
(2) Public affairs support training by helping NLW users engage and respond
to the media consistent with unit and strategic messaging that supports the
commander’s objectives. During scenario training for the unit, public affairs
30 October 2024 
ATP 3-22.40/MCTP 10-10A/NTTP 3-26.6/ 
AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
39 
officers should be asked to provide a unit message that fosters goodwill with 
civilian populations and encourages cooperation. This can be achieved by 
explaining which NLW are authorized to be used and how the unit will make 
their determination of hostile intent. 
(3) The intelligence staff works with the operations staff to project a realistic
threat environment based on the commander’s guidance for the outcome of
the training. This ensures the toughest and most realistic environment for the
unit going through the training. Also, they may provide insight into the cultural,
ethnic, and political views of a local population that describes how NLW assist
the overall unit goals and what may occur if lethal weapons are used instead.
(4) Judge Advocates clarify complex ROE and RUF issues. Commanders
ensure federal, state, and local laws are followed, in consultation with their
servicing Judge Advocate, and that ROE- and RUF-related issues are
properly integrated into NLW training. As with the intelligence staff, the Judge
Advocate personnel steer leaders in a scenario that highlights how using
NLW can offer the same value as lethal weapons while meeting the ROE and
RUF.
(5) The logistics staff provides advice and guidance in maintenance,
resupply, and storage procedures ensuring units have the NLW stocks
required for operations and provides NLW process distribution during
operations.
3. Service-specific NLW Training Requirements
Each Service has unique NLW training requirements and NLW education material.

b. INIWIC. INIWIC training produces NLW instructors at the Marine Corps
Detachment, Fort Leonard Wood. INIWIC provides NLW training to prepare and
certify Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, Airmen, and other DoD personnel to serve as
trainers and unit advisors on the tactical employment of NLW.
(1) INIWIC is an interservice, training review organization course. Quotas are
available for each Service through its Service training reservation channels.
(2) INIWIC is the only DoD NLW “train-the-trainer” course. Instructors
become certified in INIWIC to train personnel to tactically employ NLW
capabilities. US Army graduates of the course receive the additional skill
identifier (ASI) “2A,” and US Air Force graduates receive the special
experience identifier “310”.  Service regulations dictate the distribution and
responsibilities of these identifiers.  For example, the Army “2A” ASI identifies
“Soldiers trained in the background, planning, policy, training, and application
of non-lethal capabilities as an advisor to the commander” and authorizes or
requires a density of Soldiers with this ASI for certain unit types.  See AR
611-12 for more information.
Note: USN teaches the nonlethal weapons senior instructor course, an authorized USN 
train-the-trainer course. 
(3) INIWIC provides an in-depth understanding of ROE and RUF. The course
teaches students when and how to escalate or de-escalate force relative to
perceived threats and informs them of appropriate NLW employment.
(4) INIWIC addresses 13 NLW topics in modules. They are:
(a) Policies relevant to the application of force. This module prepares
individuals to make sound use-of-force decisions. Discussions include
SROE, SRUF, force continuum, nonlethal policy considerations, and
Service policies for the use of force.
(b) Ocular hail and warning devices. This module gives individuals the
knowledge to employ light and laser technologies to halt or deter a threat.
(c) Close-range subject control. This module teaches proper close-range
subject control techniques. Techniques include body positioning drills,
control holds, takedowns, handcuffing and baton, and hand drills including
disengagement techniques.
(d) Employment of OC (also called pepper spray). This module imparts
knowledge and effectively trains end users to properly employ OC.
Discussion includes OC training and certification, decontamination, inert
and live OC, and how OC training relates to the concept of nonlethal
training.
(e) HEMI or electro-muscular device (EMD). This module provides HEMI
or EMD technical aspects, employment considerations, and safety
considerations. Individuals qualify with the HEMI and EMD and receive a
DoD certification.

(f) Compressed air launcher instruction includes general information,
maintenance procedures, operating procedures, and considerations for
conducting training and qualification.
(g) Acoustic hail and warning devices. This module instructs individuals
on AHDs associated with communicating effectively over long distances.
(h) VLADs. This module trains proper employment of various VLADs.
(i) Nonlethal munitions. This module allows individuals to become familiar
with, and qualify on the range with, various nonlethal munitions.
Discussions include the intent of nonlethal munitions, force continuum,
types and characteristics of nonlethal munitions, ranges, physical and
psychological effects, employment considerations, and key factors
necessary for conducting a live-fire exercise (LFX).
(j) NLCS. This module provides individuals with an understanding of
NLCS and the ability to educate others on the topic.
(k) Civil disturbance. This module teaches how to enhance the
effectiveness of nonlethal responses to civil disturbances. The discussion
includes crowd behavior, indicators of crowd mood and threat, and various
formations effective in combating different types of disturbances.
(l) Integrating NLW capabilities into unit operations. This module
discusses the basic principles of integrating NLW into unit training and
operations. The discussion includes information on safety concerns,
phases of NLW, observer and controller responsibilities, procedures for
planning and executing NLW training and operations, and conducting an
after-action review with units.
(m) Conducting NLW capabilities unit training. This module discusses how
to conduct NLW training, including remedial training techniques.
(5) The INIWIC website has more information at:
http://www.tecom.marines.mil/Units/Training-Command/Detachments/Marine-
Corps-Detachment-Fort-Leonard-Wood/INIWIC/.
c. Integrating NLW Training into joint-multinational combatant command
exercises/unit command post exercises (CPXs).
(1) Combatant commands and large units conducting CPXs or table-top
exercises should incorporate scenarios or vignettes into exercises and
wargames that present opportunities to employ NLW. Integration of NLW
planning during the US joint and Service planning processes, or other Service
equivalent process ensures that NLW capabilities and effects are planned
and captured.
(a) Integrate NLW into CPX situational training exercises (STXs), and
LFXs as appropriate to the exercise's objectives and the availability of
NLW resources.
30 October 2024 
ATP 3-22.40/MCTP 10-10A/NTTP 3-26.6/ 
AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
45 
(b) Integrate NLW into CPXs to increase the proficiency of staff planners
to identity NLW capability requirements, gaps, and develop solutions to fill
these gaps.
(c) Integrate NLW into STXs to increase proficiency in applying NLW
capabilities to situations forces may likely encounter while operating within
their area of operations.  Update local unit standard operating procedures
from these STXs and forward identified capability gaps and recommended
solutions up through the chain of command.
(d) Integrate NLW into LFXs for familiarization and to increase proficiency
in employing NLW against targets.
(2) Integration of NLW and effects can be accomplished through multiple
media. Prior to CPX initial planning conference, requesting NLW simulation
support or intel support during the “Road to Crisis” period for an exercise is
ideal. Units can contact their joint intermediate force capabilities advisor
(JIFCA) for assistance.
(3) Identification of the NLW exercise objectives, units participating, and
resources required are imperative for successful execution of the NLW
objectives throughout the CPX/LFX/STX.  It is recommended that these are
identified during the initial planning event to provide adequate time to
resource.
(4) For assistance with joint exercise integration of NLW, contact the Joint
Intermediate Force Capability Office at JifcoInfo@usmc.mil. The Intermediate
Force Capabilities Range Book, Version 2.0 Edition 2021 is an additional
resource for NLW range planning.
5. NLW Exercise Planning Checklist
a. When planning for NLW integration into an exercise or training event it is
helpful to develop a checklist to ensure critical inputs, milestones, and outputs are
accounted for. Items to consider for a unit checklist include:
(1) Task.
(2) Purpose.
(3) Methodology.
(4) End state.
(5) Critical planning horizons.
b. Consult the trained unit/Service NLW advisor discussed in paragraph 4 above
or the combatant command JIFCA to develop a detailed and mission oriented
NLW planning checklist.

HISTORY OF NONLETHAL WEAPONS (NLW) 
1. Background
a. Operation UNITED SHIELD took place in Somalia from 9 January to 3 March
1995 and included a multinational coalition, combined task force organized to
evacuate all United Nations peacekeeping forces from Somalia. That operation
marked the first-time NLW were integrated into planning and operations for an
overseas contingency operation. As preparations began for the operation, it
became clear that unarmed, hostile elements posed a substantial threat to
evacuation forces. This prompted the procurement of nonlethal technologies to fill
the gap between verbal warnings and the application of deadly force when dealing
with unarmed, hostile elements. United States (US) Marines were equipped with
40 millimeter and 12-gauge nonlethal munitions, pepper spray, rubber ball
grenades, flash-bang grenades, and laser illuminators.
b. The commanding general conducted an aggressive, strategic communication
campaign ensuring the host nation’s population was aware of the capabilities the
US Marines were bringing to the operation.
c. Rules of engagement (ROE) for Operation UNITED SHIELD incorporated the
principles of graduated response, necessity, and proportionality. During one
incident, an armed agitator was identified within a large group of Somali nationals.
A Marine, armed with an M16 fitted with a laser designator, aimed his laser at the
agitator illuminating his chest with the pulsing light. As others in the mob saw the
bright light on the man’s chest, the mob began drifting away from him, and
ultimately dispersed. The agitator found himself standing alone facing the Marines
and quickly departed.
d. Though widespread employment of NLW systems, was largely unnecessary
during the evacuation, the US Congress directed the Department of Defense
(DoD) to establish a NLW program due to the widespread media coverage of
NLW use during the operation.
2. Policy
a. In 1996, the Secretary of Defense signed a Department of Defense Directive
(DoDD) that established policy for NLW. This policy was superseded by DoDD
3000.03E, DoD Executive Agent for NLW, and NLW Policy. These documents
established policies and responsibilities for the development and employment of
NLW and designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps as the executive
agent for the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program and the Joint NLW Directorate
(JNLWD) (redesignated as the Joint Intermediate Force Capabilities Office
[JIFCO]) as the lead agent charged with identifying, evaluating, and developing
NLW capabilities and enabling NLW employment across the continuum of military
operations. See http://jnlwp.defense.gov/ for more information on the DoD NLW
program.

AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
b. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011
(Public Law 111–383) directed the DoD to demonstrate and assess the utility and
effectiveness of NLW and provide escalation of force (EOF) options for
counterinsurgency operations. The study provided commanders a wide range of
force application and protection options when supplementing a commander’s
employment of deadly force.
c. DoDD 3000.03E, DoD Executive Agent for NLW, and NLW Policy, updates the
authorities, establishes policies, and assigns responsibilities for managing the
DoD NLW program. The current version of DoDD 3000.03E, incorporating change
2, 31 August 2018 maintains the designation of the Commandant of the Marine
Corps as the DoD executive agent for NLW.
d. In 2020 the JNLWD was officially redesignated the JIFCO. See: Intermediate
Force Capabilities: Bridging the Gap Between Presence and Lethality, U.S.
Department of Defense Non-Lethal Weapons Program Executive Agent’s
Planning Guidance 2020 for more information on the redesignation and for the
executive agent’s planning guidance.
e. DoDI 3200.19, Non-Lethal Weapons Human Effect Characterization
establishes policy, responsibilities, and procedures for DoD NLW human effects
characterization and the risk of significant injury (also referred to as RSI) as a
standard metric for reversibility. This policy provides guidance for the Services to
establish acceptable risk of significant injury and desired human effects in
appropriate capability documents and to create the Human Effects Review Board
for NLW programs.

PROCUREMENT INFORMATION 
To support nonlethal effects, the Services have nonlethal capability sets (NLCSs), 
categorized by specific mission modules, for procurement. This enables a unit to 
purchase either the individual nonlethal weapons (NLW), equipment, munition, or device 
or the entire module, if the unit has the specific mission. 
1. United States Army (USA) NLCSs
Tables 11–15 list the USA capability sets with their national stock numbers (NSNs). 
Units or commands can procure individual components or complete modules through 
the General Services Administration Schedule 84: Security, Fire and Law Enforcement, 
Special Order Program. Coordination with the Service’s logistics section can assist with 
this process.

The USMC separates NLW capabilities by mission module. The first USMC mission 
module is escalation of force (EOF), NSN 1367-01-579-4067, which includes multiple 
kits that can be used to address an EOF situation. These are detailed in tables 16–24. 
Individual components or complete modules can be procured by units or commands 
through General Services Administration Schedule 84. Some items maybe limited due 
to the products service life or no longer supported by the vendor. Many items require 
the use of batteries to provide power, the replacement of those batteries is the 
responsibility of the unit. Coordination with the Service’s logistics section can assist with 
this process.

3. United States Navy (USN) NLCSs
a. The USN categorizes NLW by capability set, however, not every capability set can
be purchased as a unit. Those without a quantity column are procured individually.
Tables 25 and 26 are the NLW sets used by the USN’s law enforcement units and
table 27 details shipboard NLW and equipment.
b. The quantity of NLW equipment varies by ship and unit. Check the allowance
equipage list on each ship for a total.
c. The USN has several different acoustic hailing devices, from the long-range
acoustic device 1000, to the HYPERSPIKE®. Consult the ship’s allowance equipage
list for type. Contact Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana for actual ranges.

4. United States Air Force (USAF) NLCSs
The USAF no longer fields dedicated nonlethal capability sets. Nonlethal capabilities are 
integrated into equipment unit type codes (UTCs). Current equipment UTCs incorporating 
nonlethal capabilities are the QFL1E, Entry Control Point (ECP) and QFL3C, Confrontation 
Management (CM). These UTCs can be either unit or functionally funded. Unit funded UTCs 
are used for home station training and to support home station operations. Functionally 
funded UTCs are deployment driven, Defense Readiness Reporting System reportable, 
functionally maintained, and centrally stored. The USAF ECP and CM unit type codes are 
detailed in Tables 28 and 29.

6. National Guard Capability Sets
The National Guard categorizes its NLCSs by contingency or state. This is because the 
contingency set provides more NLW capabilities than the state set. It could be used if a 
National Guard unit deploys and has to do much more than its state mission, such as crowd 
control. Table 31 shows contingency sets and table 32 shows state sets.

EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS CHECKLIST 
Although not all encompassing, the following list of employment considerations is designed to 
assist commanders and staffs in formulating plans for using nonlethal weapons (NLW): 
1. General Considerations:
a. Conduct proper training before employing NLW.
b. Understand and define rules of engagement (ROE) and rules for the use of force
(RUF).
c. NLW options require lethal overwatch.
d. Use appropriate media to inform civilians to stay away from denied areas.
e. Be aware of the information environment and how nonlethal actions will influence the
cognitive space of domestic audiences, allies, partners, and adversaries.
f. Understand the human effects as discussed in Chapter III.
2. Counterpersonnel Considerations:
a. Employing nonlethal munitions at less than the minimum safe distance may result
in death.
b. Use a target area at 15–40 feet as center mass for blunt munitions (munition
dependent).
c. Head or neck shots may result in serious injury or death.
d. Do not bounce fired nonlethal projectiles off the ground.
e. Use nonlethal munitions against selected, individual targets and to disperse
individuals.
f. Differing rates of fires (e.g., 40-millimeter launchers and shotguns) are
complementary in a nonlethal role, depending upon the munitions used and their
effective ranges.
g. Closely control riot control agent (RCA) employment.
h. Use RCA to disrupt/disperse crowds, when approved by the appropriate
commander.
i. Use searchlights to dazzle or disorient individuals during limited visibility. Avoid
using laser designators or other intense light or energy emission systems in manners
other than prescribed within the ROE or RUF for counterpersonnel operations and
activities.
j. Use acoustic hailing devices to communicate with a crowd and to control formations.
k. Employ recovery, apprehension, and snatch teams to apprehend agitators.

AFTTP 3-2.45/CGTTP 3-93.2 
3. Countermaterial Considerations:
a. Use marking agents to mark a vehicle or vessel for later interception.
b. Consider road and weather conditions when employing vehicle arresting devices.
c.
Use vehicle arresting devices to deny access to an area.
