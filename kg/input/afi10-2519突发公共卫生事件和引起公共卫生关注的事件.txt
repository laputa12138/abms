Chapter 1 
PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Overview.    This AFI specifies the authority of installation commanders and assigns 
responsibilities for declaring, reporting, and managing a public health emergency or incident of 
public health concern.  Although ultimate responsibility and authority for managing such incidents 
falls to the Installation Commander, the entire installation and all functional organizations will 
have a role to play.  The Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) Commander is advised to coordinate 
with the Defense Health Agency as needed. 
1.1.1.  The Public Health Emergency Officer (PHEO) is one of the key subject matter experts 
who will serve as a resource to help guide the Installation Commander during these incidents. 
1.1.2.  The MTF Commander (for the Air Reserve Component (ARC), Guard Medical Unit 
(GMU) commander and Reserve Medical Unit (RMU) commander) has responsibility for 
helping the Installation Commander with medical resources and capabilities. 
1.1.3.  The AFI provides guidance on disease containment planning and response to a public 
health emergency or incident of public health concern.  It identifies actions that 
installations/wings must take before, during, and after public health emergencies or incidents 
of public health concern to slow or stop the spread of the disease and ensure mission 
continuation.  These actions are summarized in a set of standard Health Protection Conditions 
(HPCON) that define appropriate measures to take based on the disease’s mode of 
transmission; as well as responses commanders may take based on the scope and severity of 
the situation.  Measures include the commander’s authority to enforce restriction of movement 
(ROM), social distancing, and administration of prophylaxis treatment.  Reference the public 
health emergency management handbook which is available by contacting the Air Force 
Medical Support Agency, Medical Preparedness and Response Branch (AFMSA/SG3XC), via 
sending an email to the following mailbox: usaf.  pentagon.  af-sg.  mbx.  afmsa-sgx-
workflow@mail.  mil. 
1.1.4.  This AFI compliments AFI10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management Program, 
which establishes responsibilities, procedures, and standards for AF mitigation and emergency 
response to physical threats resulting from major accidents, natural disasters, conventional 
attacks, terrorist attacks, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) attacks. 
1.1.5.  This Instruction applies to all installations, including those with Limited Readiness 
Capability, activities under Air Force command, and geographically-separated units (GSU) 
(hereafter referred to collectively as “installations”).  ANG units will follow the guidelines 
outlined in Chapter 6.  The term “commanders,” as used in this Instruction, refers to 
commanders at the installation and wing (for AFR) level unless specifically stated otherwise.  
For stand-alone Air Force Reserve (AFR) installations, the Bioenvironmental Engineering 
(BE)/Public Health Office (PHO) is the local equivalent to a Regular Air Force MTF’s Public 
Health Flight (see Chapter 7).

AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
1.2.  Public Health Emergencies. 
1.2.1.  Situations that may be Public Health Emergencies in accordance with DoDI 6200.03 
include the occurrence or the imminent threat of an illness or health condition with a high 
probability of any of the following: 
1.2.1.1.  A significant number of deaths. 
1.2.1.2.  A significant number of serious or long-term disabilities. 
1.2.1.3.  Widespread exposure to an infectious or toxic agent that poses a significant risk 
of substantial future harm. 
1.2.1.4.  Health care needs that exceed available resources. 
1.2.1.5.  Severe degradation of mission capabilities or normal operations. 
1.2.1.6.  May result from any of the following: natural disasters, industrial accidents, or 
intentional CBRNE events, including the release of a novel or reintroduced infectious 
agent, biological toxin, zoonotic disease, or radiological agent.  They may also result from 
a cyberattack on critical infrastructure with cascading consequences that endanger the 
public’s health. 
1.2.1.7.  May require World Health Organization notification as a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern IAW International Health Regulations (2005).  See 
DoDI 6200.03 paragraph 3.4.  for reporting potential Public Health Emergencies of 
International Concern. 
1.2.2.  Specifically, the following diseases and public health conditions when taken in context 
of morbidity, mortality, and geographic proximity to the installation may be grounds for the 
Installation Commander to declare a Public Health Emergency (Attachment 2 provides a 
template for declaring a public health emergency): 
1.2.2.1.  One or more human cases of any of the following diseases that are unusual or 
unexpected and may have serious public health impact:  smallpox, cholera, pneumonic 
plague, poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus, human influenza caused by novel or re-
emergent influenza viruses that are causing or have the potential to cause a pandemic, 
severe acute respiratory syndrome, and viral hemorrhagic fevers (e.g., Ebola, Lassa, 
Marburg). 
1.2.2.2.  Any other disease of special military, national, or regional concern (e.g., Dengue 
fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Rift Valley fever, meningococcal disease) that is 
unusual and unexpected, may have a serious impact on public health or has a significant 
risk of spread and/or affecting the mission. 
1.2.2.3.  The occurrence of any item listed in paragraph 1.2.1 that overwhelms the local 
capabilities to respond to the situation, to include requesting assets from the Strategic 
National Stockpile (SNS).  See Chapter 5 for SNS planning requirements.  SNS assets 
will not be relied upon as part of an installation’s initial response capability. 
 
 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
7 
1.2.2.4.  One or more cases of any disease that requires the use of quarantine to control.  
Orders for quarantine or for the apprehension, detention, or conditional release of personnel 
exposed to a contagious disease but without confirmed illness may not be issued by the 
PHEO unless the Installation Commander has declared a public health emergency.  A 
Notice of Quarantine template is provided in Attachment 3.  Orders regarding isolation 
and ROM of individuals with a confirmed illness may be issued during a public health 
emergency or during incidents of public health concern.  A Notice of Isolation template is 
provided in Attachment 4. 
1.2.3.  Authority for Declaring a Public Health Emergency (Emergency Health Powers are 
covered in Chapter 3). 
1.2.3.1.  Installation Authority.  The Installation Commander, in consultation with their 
PHEO, may declare a DoD public health emergency and implement relevant emergency 
health powers to achieve the greatest public health benefit while maintaining operational 
effectiveness.  The Installation Commander is the only authority who can declare a public 
health emergency on an Air Force installation.  Commanders on ANG installations will 
coordinate with their Joint Force Headquarters-State (JFHQ-State) and the ANG prior to 
declaring a public health emergency.  (T- 0).   
1.2.3.2.  Local Authority.  Where individual states (and in some instances local 
governments) have the authority to declare a public health emergency, DoD installations 
in that State or jurisdiction shall, to the extent practicable, act consistently with applicable 
provisions of those declarations.  State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) public health 
laws vary between jurisdictions, and the JA may be required to provide a legal opinion on 
the installation’s legal obligations to comply with the SLTT requirement. 
1.2.3.3.  National Authority.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the 
authority to declare a national public health emergency pursuant to Title 42 United States 
Code Section 247d.  When the Secretary of Health and Human Services declares a national 
public health emergency, the DoD shall, to the extent practicable, act consistently with 
applicable provisions of that declaration.  (T-2). 
1.3.  Incidents of Public Health Concern. 
1.3.1.  There may be situations when a contagious disease or other biological incident has the 
potential to impact installation operations; however, it does not meet the criteria for an 
Installation Commander to declare a public health emergency.  These incidents of public health 
concern should be managed in a similar fashion to a declared public health emergency. 
1.3.2.  Incidents of public health concern are defined as occurrences of an illness or health 
condition caused by an epidemic, or a serious and potentially fatal infectious agent that poses 
a substantial risk of human infection, but that does not constitute a public health emergency. 
1.3.2.1.  Examples of incidents of public health concern: a single case of infectious 
tuberculosis, viral hemorrhagic fever that is contained prior to multiple deaths or disability 
and that can be addressed using available healthcare resources. 
 
 
8 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
1.3.2.2.  Many of the directives issued in this Instruction apply to responding to an incident 
of public health concern.  The PHEO will provide recommendations to the Installation 
Commander and/or the MTF Commander (for the ARC, GMU Commander or RMU 
Commander) on the actions necessary to respond, mitigate, and control the public health 
incident.  (T-0). 
1.4.  Situational Standards of Care.    Public health emergencies may result in surge 
requirements that overwhelm the response capacity, capability, and resources of medical facilities 
and health care providers, resulting in an inability to meet normal standards of care.  Under these 
conditions, it may be necessary to provide situational standards of care.  Such situational standards 
will be directed IAW Section 5 of DoDI 6200.03.  (T-0). 
1.5.  Installation Response Plans.    Installations will develop disease containment and public 
health emergency response guidance as part of the Installation Emergency Management Plan 
(IEMP) 10-2.  (T-1).  Reference the public health emergency management handbook which is 
available by contacting the Air Force Medical Support Agency, Medical Preparedness and 
Response Branch (AFMSA/SG3XC), via sending an email to the following mailbox: 
usaf.pentagon.af-sg.mbx.afmsa-sgx-workflow@mail.mil. 
1.6.  Overseas Limitations.    Host Nation (HN) agreements, governmental oversight, and control 
of overseas installations may prevent commanders from unilaterally implementing many of the 
provisions of this Instruction.  Ultimately, U.S. prerogatives and control at overseas locations are 
subject to the sovereignty of the HN, except as otherwise defined in applicable international 
agreements, (e.g., Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs), defense cooperation agreements, and 
base-rights agreements). 
1.6.1.  A U.S. installation commander’s authority overseas extends generally only to U.S. 
service members, civilian employees of U.S. forces, U.S. DoD contractor employees (when 
specified by agreements), and the dependents of these categories of personnel. 
1.6.2.  A commander’s authority may be limited in scope as it pertains to HN personnel.  
Overseas installations will review their respective HN agreements and incorporate guidance 
into existing installation emergency management and response plans (i.e., Installation 
Emergency Management Plan (IEMP 10-2) and Medical Contingency Response Plan) and 
agreements.  (T-3).   
1.6.3.  Many of the authorities cited in this publication cannot be implemented in an overseas 
environment without the cooperation of HN authorities, except to the extent specified by 
governing international agreements. 
1.6.4.  Should it be necessary to enter into international agreements to adequately address the 
requirements of this Instruction, Major Commands (MAJCOM) and Commanders of Air Force 
forces outside the continental United States (OCONUS) will consult AFI 51-701, Negotiating, 
Concluding, Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements, and applicable combatant 
command regulations, to determine whether authority exists, or must be requested, to negotiate 
and conclude such agreements.  (T-1). 
 
 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
9 
1.7.  Air Reserve Component (ARC) and Geographically Separated Units (GSU) 
Limitations.    ARC units and GSUs may not have the resident capability or personnel to prepare 
for or respond to a public health emergency or incident of public health concern.  This will 
ultimately limit a commander’s ability to implement some of the provisions of this Instruction, to 
include designating a PHEO.  Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 provide specific guidance for ANG and 
AFRC organizations, respectively. 
1.7.1.  Commanders of GSUs will review their respective emergency management and 
response plans and incorporate measures from this AFI that are reasonable and appropriate 
given their GSU’s hazard assessment.  (T-2).  At a minimum, such measures will include 
coordination of emergency management plans and response procedures with applicable local 
and/or state authorities.  (T-2).   
1.7.2.  The appointed State Air Surgeon (SAS) will advise ANG Installation Commanders on 
potential public health emergency situations.  (T-2).   
1.7.3.  For stand-alone Air Force Reserve Installations the Reserve PHEO shall be familiar 
with civilian agencies/local authorities for emergency response for that state.  (T-2).   
1.7.4.  ARC units and GSUs shall negotiate and conclude memorandums of understanding 
(MOU) or memorandums of agreement (MOA) with appropriate local organizations when 
necessary to adequately address the requirements of this Instruction.  (T-2). 
1.8.  Joint Base Requirements. 
1.8.1.  Air Force units in Joint Basing situations, in the supporting role, must comply with Air 
Force guidance to ensure installation personnel are adequately protected and cared for during 
public health emergencies or incidents of public health concern, supported/supporting units 
should implement standards of support MOAs.  (T-1).  Units that cannot meet Air Force 
requirements must coordinate with their MAJCOM to alleviate discrepancies.  (T-2).  
MAJCOMs that cannot resolve discrepancies will coordinate with the appropriate 
Headquarters Air Force (HAF) office to determine a solution.  (T-1).   
1.8.2.  Joint Base Air Force MTFs in a supported role will have the Installation Commander 
appoint the PHEO.  (T-1).  In some joint base locations, it may be appropriate (through 
coordination with the tenant organization) to appoint an alternate PHEO from a Service 
different to that of the PHEO, especially where a highly specialized skill set exists in a tenant 
organization.  Joint basing standard operating procedures and tenant organization agreements 
should reflect the requirement to provide a single coordinated response to any public health 
emergency or incident of public health concern. 
1.8.3.  Air Force units hosted by another component, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or 
on a coalition base will follow host base protocols.  (T-2).  Commanders should identify 
specific protection measures the host base cannot or is unable to provide.  Units that cannot 
meet Air Force requirements must coordinate with their MAJCOM to alleviate discrepancies.  
(T-2).  MAJCOMs that cannot resolve discrepancies will coordinate with the appropriate HAF 
office to determine a solution. 
 
 
10 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
1.8.4.  In cases where no Air Force medical personnel who meet the PHEO qualifications are 
assigned to the Air Force unit(s), the installation must obtain an MOA ensuring “back-up” 
PHEO consultation, with another fully-qualified installation PHEO (within the MAJCOM, 
another MAJCOM, or a sister service), in the event of a public health incident/emergency.  (T-
1).  If unable to coordinate an MOA with another installation PHEO, the parent MAJCOM 
PHEO Consultant will provide installation back-up coverage and an MOU indicating such will 
be kept on file.  (T-1).   
1.8.5.  In joint basing and tenant organization situations, the Installation Commander will 
appoint the PHEO and alternate PHEO(s).  (T-1).  On installations where the supported MTF 
is a tenant, a qualified individual will be nominated and made available to serve as the host 
installation PHEO.  (T-1).  In some locations, it may be appropriate to appoint a PHEO from 
one of the other tenant organizations, especially where a highly-specialized skill set exists in 
another organization.  Alternate PHEOs may be selected from Military Services different to 
that of the PHEO.  Joint basing and tenant organization agreements should reflect the 
requirement to provide a single coordinated response to any public health emergency.  When 
the appointment of an appropriate PHEO is not forthcoming or causes local difficulties, the 
Service Headquarters PHEO should be consulted for adjudication; however, the final 
appointment decision rests with the Installation Commander.

Chapter 3 
EMERGENCY HEALTH POWERS FOR INSTALLATION COMMANDERS 
3.1.  Public Health Emergency Declaration.  In response to a suspected or confirmed public 
health emergency, the Installation Commander in consultation with the PHEO, may declare a 
public health emergency and implement relevant emergency health powers as described in this 
chapter.  To the extent necessary for protecting or securing military property or places and 
associated military personnel, such powers may also extend to non-military personnel who are 
present on Air Force installations.  See DoDI 6200.03 paragraph 3.3.  for reporting and notification 
of Public Health Emergencies. 
3.1.1.  Emergency health powers prescribed in this Instruction are not intended to provide for 
the apprehension, detention, or conditional release of individuals except for the purpose of 
preventing the introduction, transmission, or spread of such communicable diseases as may be 
specified in Executive Orders of the President upon the recommendation of the National 
Advisory Health Council and Surgeon General of the United States (i.e., Executive Order 
13295, Revised List of Quarantinable Communicable Diseases, amended by Executive Order 
13375, Amendment to Executive Order 13295 Relating to Certain Influenza Viruses and 
Quarantinable Communicable Diseases). 
3.1.2.  Overseas Installation Commanders will exercise emergency health powers in agreement 
with HN authorities under applicable international agreements.  (T-0).  The PHEO will 
function as the Installation Commander’s primary public health advisor during an emergency 
regardless of HN actions.  (T-1). 
3.2.  Legal Authorities.  IAW DoDI 6200.03, during a declared public health emergency, the 
Installation Commander, as reasonable and necessary for the emergency response, has the legal 
authority to: 
3.2.1.  Collect specimens and perform tests on installation property or on any animal or disease 
vector, living or deceased, as reasonable and necessary for emergency response. 
3.2.2.  Close, direct the evacuation of, or decontaminate, any affected asset, or facility that 
endangers public health; decontaminating or destroying any material that endangers public 
health. 
3.2.2.1.  However, to the fullest extent possible under the circumstances, evidence should 
be preserved so appropriate investigations and/or remedial actions can be taken. 
3.2.2.2.  Commanders can close installation facilities or the entire base prior to 
confirmatory identification, which may take several days. 
3.2.3.  Assert control over any animal or disease vector that endangers public health, including 
quarantine and isolation of animals on the installation. 
3.2.4.  Use facilities, materials, and services for purposes of communications, transportation, 
occupancy (e.g., emergency shelters or quarantine/isolation), fuel, food, clothing, health care, 
and other purposes, and controlling or restricting the distribution of commodities as reasonable 
and necessary for emergency response. 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
27 
3.2.5.  Control evacuation routes on, and ingress and egress to and from, the affected 
installation. 
3.2.6.  Take measures to safely contain and dispose of infectious or contaminated waste as may 
be reasonable and necessary for emergency response. 
3.2.7.  Take measures as reasonable and necessary, pursuant to applicable law, and AFI 41-
209, Medical Logistics Support, to obtain and control use and distribution of needed health 
care supplies. 
3.2.7.1.  Installation commanders have local purchase approval authority for medical and 
non-medical materiel, as well as services. 
3.2.7.2.  Installation commanders may delegate this approval authority to an authorized 
representative (usually the MTF Commander). 
3.2.8.  Direct military personnel to submit to medical examinations and/or testing as necessary 
to diagnose or treat the condition causing the public health emergency or incident of public 
health concern.  Non-military members may be required as a condition of exemption or release 
from restrictions of movement to submit to a physical examination or testing, as necessary, to 
diagnose and prevent the transmission of a communicable disease and enhance public health 
and safety. 
3.2.8.1.  Privileged providers will be responsible for all examinations and testing.  Failure 
by military members to submit to medical examinations and/or testing as necessary to 
diagnose or treat the condition causing the public health emergency or incident of public 
health concern is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ. 
3.2.8.2.  The PHEO will coordinate such actions with local health authorities as necessary. 
3.2.9.  Authorize conditional release, a less restrictive alternative to quarantine, for persons 
who may have been exposed to a communicable disease or hazardous substance and require 
continued health monitoring and supervision but have been assessed and determined to be 
asymptomatic and present a low risk to public health. 
3.2.10.  Restrict movement of military and non-military persons to prevent the introduction, 
transmission, and spread of communicable diseases or any other hazardous substances that 
pose a threat to public health and safety. 
3.2.10.1.  The needs of persons or groups of persons quarantined or isolated shall be 
addressed in a systematic and competent fashion.  (T-0).  Places of quarantine shall be 
maintained in a safe and hygienic manner, designed to minimize transmission of 
infection/contamination or other harm to persons subject to quarantine.  (T-0).  Adequate 
food, clothing, medical care, and other necessities will be provided as expeditiously as 
possible under the circumstances.  (T-0).   
 
 
28 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
3.2.10.2.  Persons subject to quarantine or isolation shall obey the rules and orders 
established by the Installation Commander in consultation with the PHEO, shall not go 
beyond the quarantine premises, and shall not put himself/herself in contact with any 
person not subject to quarantine, except as the Installation Commander authorizes.  Public 
Health will assist the PHEO with tracking of persons subject to quarantine or isolation.  
Failure by military members, who are subject to quarantine or isolation, to obey the rules 
and orders established by the Installation Commander; to remain within the quarantine 
premises; or to refrain from putting himself/herself in contact with any person not subject 
to quarantine (except as the Installation Commander authorizes) is a violation of Article 92 
of the UCMJ. 
3.2.10.3.  No person may, without authorization, enter quarantine or isolation premises.  
(T-0).  A person who by reason of unauthorized entry poses a danger to public health 
becomes subject to quarantine.  Unless authorized, failure by military members to refrain 
from entering quarantine or isolation premises is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ. 
3.2.10.4.  Quarantine or isolation will be accomplished through the least restrictive means 
available, consistent with protection of public health.  (T-0).  Quarantine or isolation of 
any person shall be terminated when no longer necessary to protect public health.  (T-0).   
3.2.10.5.  Military personnel may be ordered to submit to diagnostic or medical treatment 
for the condition causing the public health emergency or incident of public health concern 
IAW Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug 
Administration guidelines.  Military members shall submit to diagnostic or medical 
treatment for the condition causing the public health emergency or incident of public health 
concern.  (T-0).  Failure by military members to submit, when ordered, to diagnostic or 
medical treatment (IAW CDC and Food and Drug Administration guidelines) for the 
condition causing the public health emergency or incident of public health concern is a 
violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ. 
3.2.10.6.  In the case of persons other than military personnel, ROM may include isolation 
or limiting ingress and egress to, from, or on an Air Force installation.  Persons other than 
military personnel may be required, as a condition of exemption or release from ROM, to 
submit to vaccination or treatment diagnostics as necessary.  Submitting to vaccination, 
treatment, or diagnostic testing for the condition causing the public health emergency or 
incident of public health concern may be a requirement for returning to work or gaining 
access to an Air Force installation.  In the United States, coordinate all ROM actions 
involving non-military personnel through the nearest CDC Quarantine Officer and/or 
SLTT health department officials.  (T-0).   
3.2.10.7.  Quarantine or isolation measures may be implemented in healthcare facilities, 
living quarters, or other appropriate buildings on an Air Force installation.  These measures 
do not lessen the responsibilities of the medical unit to provide medical care to infected 
persons to the standard of care feasible given resources available. 
3.2.10.8.  In the case of ROM of persons other than military personnel on U.S. installations, 
the PHEO will coordinate through his/her respective medical chain of command in relation 
to CDC actions under quarantine authorities provided in this Instruction; DoDI 6200.03; 
Title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 70 and 71, and Executive Orders 13295 
and 13375. 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
29 
3.2.10.9.  With regard to emergency health powers, an Installation Commander’s authority 
may be limited in scope as it pertains to HN personnel.  OCONUS installations will review 
their respective HN agreements and incorporate into their IEMP 10-2 the authority local 
commanders possess as it pertains to HN personnel.  (T-0).  Coordination of ROM actions 
will be sought with the Department of State and appropriate HN public health officials.  
(T-0). 
3.3.  Violation of Restriction of Movement.    Individuals and groups subject to quarantine shall 
be advised that violators may be charged with a crime pursuant to law (Title 50 United States Code 
(USC) Section 797, 18 USC Section 1382, Title 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 70-
71) and subject to punishment of a fine or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. 
3.3.1.  In the case of U.S. military personnel, these potential sanctions are in addition to 
applicable provisions of the UCMJ, to the extent allowed by law. 
3.3.2.  Those individuals or groups not subject to military law and who refuse to obey or 
otherwise violate an order under this Instruction may be detained by the Installation 
Commander until appropriate civil authorities can respond. 
3.4.  Contesting Restriction of Movement.    Any persons subject to quarantine or isolation who 
contest the reason for quarantine/isolation will be provided an opportunity to present information 
supporting an exemption or release.  (T-0).  The Installation Commander or a designated 
representative (who has not been previously involved in any medical determination concerning the 
person) will make the final determination on all requests for exemption or release.  (T-0).   
3.4.1.  Upon receiving a request for exemption or release, the PHEO will immediately provide 
the information to the Installation Commander.  (T-0).   
3.4.2.  The PHEO will consult with appropriate medical and legal personnel regarding the 
request for exemption or release to ensure he/she is informed of all pertinent facts prior to 
providing a recommendation to the Installation Commander or designated representative.  (T-
0).   
3.4.3.  The PHEO will provide the requesting member with the commander’s or designated 
representative’s written decision on the quarantine or isolation exemption as soon as possible, 
but no more than 24 hours after receipt of the member’s initial request.  (T-0).

Chapter 4 
PLANNING AND RESPONSE 
4.1.  Purpose.  Effective base-wide disease containment planning coordinates unit capabilities and 
integrates medical and non-medical measures implemented by all personnel before, during, and 
after a public health emergency or incident of public health concern. 
4.2.  Assumptions of Biological Incidents.    A biological incident may not result in noticeable 
effects for hours or days.  Responses to a biological incident are further complicated by the variety 
of potential pathogens, limitations in accurate detection and identification, and disease-specific 
treatment requirements. 
4.3.  Planning.  The more prepared an installation is prior to a biological incident, the greater the 
potential number of options available for the Installation Commander to mitigate the effects of the 
incident.  Sound preparation through disease containment planning will ensure commanders have 
the greatest range of options available to respond to a given trigger event while appropriately 
balancing mission requirements with the risk to personnel.  The EMWG will support the planning 
process by providing a forum for public health emergency preparedness and response activities for 
the installation.  (T-1).   
4.3.1.  The PHEO and MEM will actively participate and contribute to the ongoing EMWG 
All-Hazards Response Planning Team IAW AFI 10-2501 in order to: 
4.3.1.1.  Ensure disease containment and public health emergency response guidance is 
discussed and appropriately included in the IEMP 10-2.  Reference the public health 
emergency management handbook which is available by contacting the Air Force Medical 
Support Agency, Medical Preparedness and Response Branch (AFMSA/SG3XC). 
4.3.1.2.  Review and discuss health threat situations (e.g., identified spread of human-to-
human transmission of highly-pathogenic avian influenza in another country or region) and 
potential local actions (e.g., distribution of prophylaxis or PA guidance) that may be 
required. 
4.3.2.  The All-Hazards Planning Response Team, via the EMWG, will coordinate non-
medical procedures that support the health risk and medical needs of public health emergencies 
and incidents of public health concern. 
4.4.  Response.  Installation commanders will use the following HPCON framework to select an 
appropriate response to a public health emergency or incident of public health concern.  (T-1).  
The framework, see Table 4.1, clarifies much of the uncertainty associated with these situations 
and provides options based on the scope and severity of the situation.  The framework stratifies 
health-protection measures into categories beginning with simple standard precautions and 
gradually increasing the level of effort and expense.  Standardizing responses within categories 
ensures a measured local response, understood by all, up, down, and across command chains—
just like Force Protection Condition levels.  HPCON visual aids (AFVA 10-2591, HPCON 
Normal, AFVA 10-2592, HPCON Alpha, AFVA 10-2593, HPCON Bravo, AFVA 10-2594, 
HPCON Charlie, and AFVA 10-2595, HPCON Delta) are available on the Air Force e-Publishing 
website.  In addition, recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) Levels, see Table 4.2, 
will be used to determine appropriate equipment required for protection based on the mode of 
transmission of the disease in question.  (T-1).  (Reference public health emergency management

Preparedness and Response Branch (AFMSA/SG3XC), via sending an email to the following 
mailbox:  usaf.pentagon.af-sg.mbx.afmsa-sgx-workflow@mail.mil. 
4.4.1.  Health Protection Conditions (HPCON). 
4.4.1.1.  HPCON 0 – Normal Operations.  No known health risks, other than diseases 
endemic to the area surrounding the installation. 
4.4.1.2.  HPCON A – Limited Disease Threat.  There is a limited threat to personnel based 
on the existence of a disease or unusual human health threat that has the potential to rapidly 
move into the local area (i.e., an area defined by each installation as consisting of a pre-
determined distance or a list/map depicting by-name counties surrounding the installation). 
4.4.1.3.  HPCON B – Moderate Disease Threat.  There is a moderate disease threat and/or 
a real risk of exposure to personnel due to a significant outbreak of disease in the local area 
or imminent spread of disease to the local area.  HPCON B would be employed by the 
commander if notified by the PHEO that there has been an initial case identification of a 
contagious disease, such as a novel influenza, or a dramatic increase in the risk of acquiring 
a new significant disease from the environment within the local area. 
4.4.1.4.  HPCON C – Substantial Disease Threat.  There is a substantial threat of disease 
for personnel due to a local epidemic outbreak of a disease with a high morbidity rate, 
imminent spread of such a disease to the local area, and/or a wide area of contamination 
that requires special or costly avoidance procedures. 
4.4.1.5.  HPCON D – Severe Disease Threat.  A local epidemic with a high mortality rate 
or imminent spread of such a disease to the local area will drive enactment of HPCON D.

Chapter 5 
STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE AND MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURE 
PLANNING REQUIREMENTS 
5.1.  Medical Countermeasure Sources.    Public health emergency medical countermeasures are 
used to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CBRN threats and naturally-occurring epidemics.  
Medical countermeasures include both pharmaceuticals (e.g., vaccines, antibiotics, antivirals, 
antitoxins) and non-pharmaceuticals for MTF personnel (e.g., diagnostics, ventilators, PPE such 
as face masks and gloves, and other devices). 
5.1.1.  The SNS is a national repository of prophylaxis and treatment medications, as well as 
medical supplies and equipment established by the CDC.  The SNS is designed to supplement 
and re-supply SLTT public health agencies in the event of a national emergency.  It is capable 
of delivering vast amounts of medical countermeasures (e.g., sufficient antibiotics for ten-day 
regimens for over 400,000 people) within 12 hours to anywhere in the United States or its 
territories.  The SNS is the primary domestic source for medical countermeasures in a large-
scale public health emergency. 
5.1.2.  Air Force installations will maintain a medical initial response capability for responding 
to public health emergencies through the home station medical response program.  (T-1).  Air 
Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-42.32, Home Station Medical Response 
to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Events, provides additional 
information on the home station medical response program. 
5.1.3.  In the event of a larger-scale public health emergency or incident of public health 
concern, Air Force installations may have access to additional medical countermeasures and 
material.  If Air Force installation countermeasure requirements exceed local capabilities 
installation MEMs will contact their MAJCOM MEM.  (T-1).  MAJCOM MEMs will contact 
the HAF MEM to coordinate access to enterprise-wide countermeasure materiel if available.  
Installation MEMs will ensure MAJCOM appropriate medical countermeasures coordination 
requirements are included in IEMP 10-2 under the disease containment and public health 
emergency response section. 
5.2.  Strategic National Stockpile Planning Guidance.  All Air Force installations in the United 
States and its territories must develop MOUs/MOAs with their SLTT health agencies to receive 
SNS assets during a public health emergency or incident of public health concern.  (T-0).  Request 
for SNS will be made by the Installation Commander to the governor of the applicable state or 
through the military chain of command to the Secretary of Defense.  This section does not apply 
to an ANG GMU.  For the ANG guidance, refer to Chapter 6 of this instruction. 
5.2.1.  MOUs/MOAs will be signed by the Installation Commander and the senior 
representative from the coordinating agency (e.g., director of the county/state health 
department) and will be reviewed by the installation base legal office prior to the Installation 
Commander’s signature. (T-1).   
5.2.2.  All MOUs/MOAs will follow guidance as outlined in DoDI 4000.19, Support 
Agreements.  (T-0).  Agreements will clarify responsibilities and must address situations when 
access to the installation is limited or restricted.  (T-0).   
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
35 
5.2.3.  MAJCOM SGX will review and track installation SNS access procedure MOUs and 
provide an annual status report to the HAF MEM.  (T-1). 
5.3.  Mass Prophylaxis Point of Dispensing.    A POD rapidly distributes and administers 
medication regimens, to identified populations, via mass prophylaxis or vaccination clinics and 
educates recipients about the risks and benefits of the medical countermeasure regimen during a 
public health emergency.  This section does not apply to an ANG GMU.  For the ANG guidance, 
refer to Chapter 6 of this instruction. 
5.3.1.  IAW DoDI 6200.03, military installations are prohibited from serving as open PODs 
for SNS assets.  (T-0).  An open POD is open to the public and available to all members of the 
local community who arrive for treatment.  Installations may not provide medical 
countermeasures to non-beneficiary populations. 
5.3.2.  Installations are required to serve as closed PODs for SNS assets.  (T-0).  A closed POD 
is only available to certain target populations.  Target populations for installations to consider 
include initial victims or cases, emergency responders, critical and mission-essential 
personnel, population working on the installation, or the entire beneficiary population at risk.   
5.3.3.  All Air Force installations will incorporate an mass prophylaxis plan as part of the 
disease containment and public health emergency response guidance within IEMP 10-2.  (T-
1).  Mass prophylaxis plan is available from AFMSA/SG3XC, via sending an email to the 
following mailbox: usaf.  pentagon.  af-sg.  mbx.  afmsa-sgx-workflow@mail.  mil (see 
paragraph 2.2.5.4.6). 
5.4.  Receiving, Staging, and Storage (RSS) Sites. 
5.4.1.  Air Force installations are authorized to serve as RSS sites.  The decision to serve as an 
RSS sites must be made by the Installation Commander.  (T-1).  The decision process must 
consider RSS site requirements, installation ability to operate an RSS site during a public health 
emergency or incident of public health concern, and the population the RSS site serves.  (T-
1).  For ANG guidance, refer to Chapter 6 of this instruction. 
5.4.1.1.  Costs and manpower requirements associated with becoming an RSS site should 
be incurred by the installation (and not the MTF). 
5.4.1.2.  All installations that will serve as an RSS site must develop an MOU/MOA, 
separate from any other SLTT health agency MOUs/MOAs, signed by the Installation 
Commander, and complies with DoDI 4000.19 requirements (T-1).   
5.4.2.  Installations that agree to serve as an RSS site must gain approval prior to signing the 
MOU/MOA.  (T-1).  The Installation Commander must report the request to serve as an RSS 
site through their chain of command to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) for approval.  (T-
0).  ANG units will coordinate RSS site approval requests through their chain of command, 
their JFHQ-State, and ANG, not through the DoD.  (T-1). 
5.5.  Overseas Installations.  Air Force OCONUS installations, through the home station medical 
response program, have an initial public health emergency response capability. 
5.5.1.  Should a public health emergency or incident of public health concern at an OCONUS 
Air Force installation exceed medical countermeasure capabilities, follow the procedures 
outlined in paragraph 5.1.3.  (T-0).   
36 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
5.5.1.1.  The installation will need to specify the amount and type of materials required and 
describe the scope and details of the public health emergency. 
5.5.1.2.  The request for SNS must be made through the installation’s chain of command 
to the Geographic Combat Commander, who will forward the request to the Secretary of 
Defense.  (T-1).   
5.5.2.  All OCONUS Air Force installations will develop plans to operate a closed POD 
capable of servicing the installation’s beneficiary population.  (T-1).  The mass prophylaxis 
plan must be incorporated into the installation IEMP 10-2.  Contact AFMSA/SG3X for 
template (see paragraph 2.2.5.4.6).  (T-1).

Chapter 6 
AIR NATIONAL GUARD 
6.1.  Purpose.    This chapter specifies the role of the ANG and the GMU in planning for, and 
responding to public health emergencies or incidents of public health concern.  The following 
paragraphs identify the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders. 
6.2.  Co-located Installations.    At co-located installations where Active Duty is host and ANG 
Wings/Groups/Units are tenant, Guard personnel and resources will support the host installation’s 
public health emergency planning, preparedness, and response as described in the host’s IEMP 10-
2 and host-tenant support agreements.  At a minimum, tenant ANG Wings/Groups/Units will: (T-
2).   
6.2.1.  Support host installation efforts to prepare for, respond to, and recover from public 
health emergencies or incidents of public health concern. 
6.2.2.  Comply with installation directives to respond to and recover from the public health 
emergency or incident of public health concern and sustain mission operations. 
6.2.3.  Participate in host installation disease containment and public health emergency 
response training and exercises.  (T-2).   
6.2.4.  Provide personnel data to the host unit for inclusion in the installation mass prophylaxis 
plan.  This data will include: 
6.2.4.1.  A list of mission essential ANG positions and the number of personnel assigned 
to these positions who are critical to executing ANG mission essential functions and 
operations. 
6.2.4.2.  The number of non-mission essential ANG personnel. 
6.2.5.  Participate on the host installation EMWG.  (T-2).   
6.2.6.  Provide ANG manpower, as allowed and appropriate, to the installation to prepare for, 
respond to, and recover from public health emergencies or incidents of public health concern. 
6.3.  Stand-alone Air National Guard Medical Units.    Stand-alone, Limited Readiness 
Capability GMUs, do not have the resident capability or personnel to fully prepare for, respond to, 
and recover from a public health emergency or incident of public health concern.  This limitation 
necessitates support and interdependence between the installation and SLTT government agencies 
(e.g., state or regional health department), civilian emergency medical system, and airport 
municipals and heavy reliance on civilian agency/local authority MOUs/MOAs for emergency 
response.  In addition, the following assumptions and limiting factors apply to ANG GMUs: 
6.3.1.  Population served.  A stand-alone ANG installation is responsible for protecting the 
health and well-being of military and civilian employees assigned to the installation; it is not 
responsible for the beneficiaries or dependents of those assigned with the exception of 
Psychological Health (see paragraph 6.4.9.1).  The installation will focus on maintaining 
mission accomplishment and satisfying deployment taskings during all phases of a public 
health emergency or incident of public health concern.  (T-1).   
38 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
6.3.2.  Response.  A stand-alone ANG installation does not have the guaranteed capability to 
provide an installation PHEO to respond to public health emergencies or incidents of public 
health concern.  Instead, a PHEO-POC will be assigned as a liaison between the ANG PHEO 
and/or ANG Command PHO and the installation to convey guidance to respond to a public 
health emergency or incident of public health concern.  (T-1).  The PHEO-POC will be a Drill 
Status Guardsman, typically serving in a military status only during unit training assemblies 
and annual tours.  (T-1).  If available, the installation PHEO-POC will be placed in a military 
status when responding to a public health emergency.  (T-1).  When not available, the Medical 
Administration Officer or GMU Senior Health Technician, will serve as the PHEO-POC.  (T-
1).   
6.3.3.  Isolation and Quarantine.  State health authorities have the primary role in imposing and 
enforcing quarantine as specified under state law with the use of civilian forces.  ANG 
installations are expected to establish agreements or protocols with SLTT government agencies 
for assessing individuals suspected of being affected by or exposed to the disease of concern, 
and providing isolation or quarantine, as necessary. 
6.3.4.  Treatment and Ambulances.  ANG GMUs are not MTFs and do not possess, maintain, 
or operate ambulances, nor are they authorized to provide medical treatment.  ANG 
installations are dependent upon local communities for response to medical or other public 
health emergencies.  IAW AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management, GMUs or 
ANG installations will have MOUs/MAAs with local civilian agencies to provide medical 
transport, treatment, and other emergency services.  (T-2).   
6.3.5.  Passenger Screening.  Stand-alone ANG installations responsible for air passenger 
terminal operations for flights arriving directly from overseas destinations (i.e., international 
flights) do not have the capability to screen passengers or receive, isolate, and/or quarantine 
arriving passengers with disease symptoms or those suspected of having been exposed to a 
contagious disease.  These installations are dependent upon the local community and will have 
an MOU/MOA with local civilian agencies that is coordinated and approved through SLTT 
government agencies, or an MOU/MOA directly established with SLTT government agencies 
to provide these functions.  (T-2).   
6.3.6.  Mass Prophylaxis Point of Dispensing.  Stand-alone ANG installations are dependent 
upon the local community and will have an MOU/MOA with SLTT government agencies to 
provide a POD.  (T-1).  If the installation and SLTT government agencies work jointly to 
operate a POD on the installation, it will be a closed POD.  (T-0).  The MOU/MOA may direct 
ANG personnel to receive services from a POD operated by SLTT government agencies at an 
off-installation site in the local area.  The ANG unit will provide personnel data to the SLTT 
government agencies, as appropriate, for inclusion in POD plans.  (T-1).  This data will include 
a list of mission essential Guard positions and the number of personnel assigned to these 
positions who are critical to executing ANG mission essential functions and operations.  (T-
2).   
 
 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
39 
6.3.7.  Receiving, Staging, and Storage Sites.  While stand-alone ANG installations are 
authorized to serve as a CDC RSS site, they are not resourced to support a RSS.  Consequently, 
the Installation Commander, in consultation with the installation PHEO-POC and other 
applicable persons (e.g., SAS, MDG/CC, MDG/SGP, MSG/CC, SJA, JFHQ), and approved 
by the joint surgeon (ANG-JSG) and Air National Guard Air Surgeon (ANG/SG), should make 
the decision to serve as an RSS site deliberately and judiciously.  The Installation Commander 
must report the request to serve as an RSS site through their chain of command to the SAF for 
approval.  (T-0).   
6.3.7.1.  The decision to serve as an RSS should be made deliberately and must consider 
established site requirements, the ability of the installation to operate the site during a 
public health emergency or incident of public health concern, and the populations that the 
material at the site is intended to cover.  (T-0).  Other factors to be considered prior to 
applying to be a CDC RSS include the availability of 24-hour security to safeguard 
stockpiles of supplies, environmentally-controlled warehousing, physical security of the 
installation, 24-hour access to manpower, and transportation vehicles. 
6.3.7.2.  Costs associated with becoming and maintaining the RSS are incurred by the 
installation.  See Chapter 5 for SNS planning requirements. 
6.3.8.  Medical Emergency Manager.  Stand-alone ANG installations do not have a MEM.  
Instead, the Medical Administration Officer or GMU Senior Health Technician will cover 
MEM roles and responsibilities, as the MEM-POC, to the extent that the GMU is authorized, 
organized, trained, and equipped to provide.  Installation MEM issues should be directed to 
the ANG MEM for coordination and direction.  (T-1).   
6.3.9.  Communication.  Since a public health emergency or incident of public health concern 
may occur during time periods that do not coincide with a Unit Training Assembly, Installation 
PA, in coordination with the installation PHEO-POC, will develop and communicate public 
health advisories and messages tailored to ANG personnel residing on the installation at the 
time of the event and those members at their home of record who are not in a military status.  
(T-1). 
6.4.  Roles and Responsibilities.   
6.4.1.  Air National Guard Public Health Emergency Officer (ANG PHEO).  The Chief of 
Aerospace Medicine (ANG/SGP) is designated the ANG PHEO and serves as the primary 
ANG PHEO Consultant.  (T-1).  Further the ANG PHEO will: 
6.4.1.1.  Complete PHEO training requirements listed in paragraph 2.3.6.1.8.  (T-1).   
6.4.1.2.  Provide expertise and guidance as needed to states and Wing(s).  (T-1).   
6.4.1.3.  Maintain contact information for all State PHEOs.  (T-1).   
6.4.1.4.  Provide ANG-specific guidance on disease containment planning and public 
health emergency response activities to supplement guidance from OSD, Air Force, and 
JFHQ-State, as necessary.  (T-0).

Guard Public Health & Prevention Branch (ANG/SGPM) or similar Government Schedule 
(GS) equivalent will assume the role of alternate PHEO and accomplish training as directed in 
paragraph 2.3.6.1.8.  (T-2).   
6.4.3.  Air National Guard Medical Emergency Manager.  The ANG/SG will appoint a 
qualified service member (E-8 or above) or GS equivalent (GS-10 or above) to serve as the 
MEM consultant for the ANG.  (T-1).  The ANG MEM will: 
6.4.3.1.  Complete MEM training requirements listed in paragraph 2.3.6.2.5.  (T-2).   
6.4.3.2.  Provide expertise and guidance to ANG installations on conducting emergency 
response actions.  (T-1).

7.2.4.1.  A list of mission essential Reserve positions and the number of personnel assigned 
to these positions who are critical to executing Reserve mission essential functions and 
operations.  (T-3).   
7.2.4.2.  The number of non-mission essential Reserve personnel.  (T-3).   
7.2.5.  Participate on the host installation EMWG.  (T-3).   
7.2.6.  Provide Reserve manpower, as allowed and appropriate, to the host installation to 
prepare for, respond to, and recover from public health emergencies or incidents of public 
health concern.  (T-2). 
7.3.  Stand-alone Air Force Reserve Installations.    Stand-alone Air Force Reserve Installations 
do not have the resident capability or personnel to fully prepare for, respond to, and recover from 
a public health emergency or incident of public health concern.  This limitation necessitates 
support and interdependence between the installation and SLTT government agencies (e.g., state 
or regional health department), civilian emergency medical system, and airport municipals and 
heavy reliance on civilian agency/local authority MOUs/MAAs for emergency response.  In 
addition, the following assumptions and limiting factors apply to AFR stand-alone installations: 
7.3.1.  Population served.  A stand-alone Air Force Reserve Installation is responsible for 
protecting the health and well-being of military and civilian employees assigned to the 
installation; it is not responsible for the beneficiaries or dependents of those assigned.  (T-2).  
The installation will focus on maintaining mission accomplishment and satisfying deployment 
taskings during all phases of a public health emergency or incident of public health concern. 
44 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
7.3.2.  Response.  A stand-alone Air Force Reserve Installation does not have the guaranteed 
capability to provide an installation PHEO to respond to public health emergencies or incidents 
of public health concern.  If available, the installation PHEO will be Traditional Air Force 
Reserve member, typically serving in a military status only during unit training assemblies and 
annual tours.  (T-2).  AFRC/SG encourages the installation PHEO to be available for public 
health emergencies or incidents of public health concern response at any time.  If available, the 
installation PHEO will be placed in a military status when responding to a public health 
emergency.  The AFRC PHEO Consultant and/or AFRC PHO, are available to provide public 
health emergency guidance to the installation. 
7.3.3.  Command Relationships Since installation PHEOs are assigned to the RMU with the 
Aeromedical Medicine Enterprise Package and BE/PHO personnel are assigned to the 
installation’s MSG, a concerted effort is required to create a synergistic and integrated 
preparedness and response approach between the installation PHEO and BE/PHO.  As the full-
time public health subject matter experts on the installation, the BE/PHO will be proactive in 
planning, preparing for, and responding to public health emergencies or incidents of public 
health concern.  (T-1).   
7.3.4.  Diagnosis, Isolation, and Quarantine.  Stand-alone Air Force Reserve Installations, by 
design and policy, do not have authorization and resources for diagnosing disease and 
providing isolation and/or quarantine procedures or facilities.  State health authorities have the 
primary role in imposing and enforcing isolation and quarantine as specified under state law 
with the use of civilian resources.  Air Force Reserve Installations are expected to establish 
agreements or protocols with SLTT government agencies for assessing individuals suspected 
of being affected by or exposed to the disease of concern, and providing isolation or quarantine, 
as necessary.  (T-1).   
7.3.5.  Treatment and Ambulances.  RMU with the Aeromedical Medicine Enterprise package 
are not MTFs and do not possess, maintain, or operate ambulances, nor are they authorized to 
provide medical treatment.  Stand-alone Air Force Reserve Installations are dependent upon 
the local community to respond to medical or other emergencies and, IAW AFI 41-106, will 
have MOUs/MOAs with local civilian agencies, coordinated and approved through SLTT 
government agencies, to provide medical transport, treatment, and other emergency services.  
(T-1).   
7.3.6.  Passenger Screening.  Stand-alone Air Force Reserve Installations responsible for air 
passenger terminal operations for flights arriving directly from overseas destinations (i.e., 
international flights) do not have the capability to screen passengers or receive, isolate, and/or 
quarantine arriving passengers with disease symptoms or those suspected of having been 
exposed to a contagious disease.  These installations are dependent upon the local community 
and will have an MOU/MOA with local civilian agencies that is coordinated and approved 
through SLTT government agencies, or an MOU/MOA directly established with SLTT 
government agencies to provide these functions.  (T-1).   
 
 
AFI10-2519  10 DECEMBER 2019 
45 
7.3.7.  Mass Prophylaxis Point of Dispensing.  Stand-Alone Air Force Reserve Installations 
are dependent upon the local community and will have an MOU/MOA with SLTT government 
agencies to provide a POD.  (T-0).  If the installation and SLTT government agencies work 
jointly to operate a POD on the installation, it will be a closed POD.  (T-0).  The MOU/MOA 
may direct AFR personnel to receive services from a POD operated by SLTT government 
agencies at an off-installation site in the local area.  The AFR unit will provide personnel data 
to SLTT government agencies, as appropriate, for inclusion in POD plans.  (T-0).  This data 
will include a list of mission essential Reserve positions and the number of personnel assigned 
to these positions who are critical to executing AFRC mission essential functions and 
operations.  (T-0).   
7.3.8.  Receiving, Staging, and Storage Sites.  While stand-alone Air Force Reserve 
Installations are authorized to serve as an RSS site, they are not resourced to support an RSS.  
(T-0).  Consequently, the Installation Commander will make the decision to serve as an RSS 
site deliberately and judiciously.  The Installation Commander must report the request to serve 
as an RSS site through their chain of command to the SAF for approval.  (T-0).   
7.3.9.  Medical Emergency Manager.  Stand-alone Air Force Reserve Installations do not have 
a MEM.  The BE/PHO and the Ground RMU with Aeromedical Medicine Enterprise Senior 
Air Reserve Technician may share the MEM roles and responsibilities to the extent that they 
are authorized, organized, trained, and equipped to provide.  It is recommended the BE/PHO 
take lead and the Ground RMU with Aeromedical Medicine Enterprise Senior Air Reserve 
Technician provide support as needed to ensure full collaboration. 
7.3.10.  Disaster Mental Health Response.  Stand-alone Air Force Reserve Installations do not 
have DMH Response Teams.  AFR DPH will formulate partnerships, develop MOU/MOA, 
and serve as liaison between military and non-military community agencies (e.g., medical 
agencies, schools, shelters, child care, and family support centers) providing access to services 
that can assist with DMH response and sustain the psychological health of AFR Airmen and 
families.  (T-1).  AFR DPHs will develop local policy to include MOU/MOA with community 
resource providers, crisis response, and local intervention procedures.  (T-1).   
7.3.11.  Communication.  Since a public health emergency or incident of public health concern 
may occur during time periods that do not coincide with a Unit Training Assembly, installation 
PA, in coordination with the installation PHEO will develop and communicate public health 
advisories and messages tailored to AFRC personnel residing on the installation at the time of 
the event and those members at their home of record who are not in a military status.  (T-3). 
7.4.  Roles and Responsibilities.   
7.4.1.  Air Force Reserve Command Surgeon General.  AFRC/SG will appoint, in writing, the 
AFRC PHEO Consultant. 
7.4.2.  Air Force Reserve Command Chief Medical Operations Division.  AFRC/SGO will 
designate the AFRC PHEO Consultant and secure AFRC/SG appointment, in writing, of

Readiness or other appropriate office who supports the Wing Commander, PHEO, and the 
Installation Emergency Manager.  The MEM is responsible for medical specific actions required 
to plan for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the impacts of all hazards (including but not 
limited to the public health and medical needs of victims during and after an attack, disaster, or 
other incident/accident).  The term MEM as it applies at the MAJCOM level is used to point out 
the consultant who insures execution of AFMS policy on Public Health Emergencies and Incidents 
of Public Health Concern.  The individual provides guidance and reach back capability for 
installation MEMs and advocates for medical specific and public health equities in support of the 
overarching Air Force Emergency Management Program. 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)—An agreement that defines areas of responsibility and 
agreement between two or more parties, normally at headquarters or MAJCOM level.  MOAs 
normally document the exchange of services and resources and establish parameters from which 
support agreements may be authorized. 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)—An umbrella agreement that defines broad areas of 
mutual understanding between two or more parties, normally at MAJCOM or higher level. 
Morbidity—Any departure, subjective or objective, from a state of physiological or psychological

Natural Disaster—An emergency posing significant danger to life and property that results from 
a natural cause. 
Non-Military Personnel—Civilian personnel, dependents of military or civilian personnel, 
contractors, and other individuals visiting or who are present on an Air Force installation. 
National Response Framework—Guides how the Nation conducts All-Hazards response.  The 
Framework documents the key response principles, roles, and structures that organize national 
response.  It describes how communities, states, the federal government, private-sector and non- 
governmental partners apply these principles for a coordinated, effective national response.  It 
describes special circumstances where the federal government exercises a larger role, including 
incidents where federal interests are involved and catastrophic incidents where a state would 
require significant support.  It allows first responders, decision makers, and supporting entities to 
provide a unified national response. 
Public Health Emergency—An occurrence or imminent threat of an illness or health condition 
that may be caused by a biological incident, manmade or naturally occurring; the appearance of a 
novel or previously controlled or eradicated infectious agent or biological toxin; natural disaster; 
chemical attack or accidental release; radiological or nuclear attack or accident; or high-yield 
explosives that pose a high probability of a significant number of deaths, serious or long-term 
disabilities, widespread exposure to an infectious or toxic agent, and/or healthcare needs that 
exceed available resources.

13295 are automatically incorporated into this definition. 
Quarantine--—Voluntary or compulsory separation and ROM of persons who are not ill but have 
been exposed to an infectious agent and therefore may become infectious, for the purpose of 
preventing or limiting the spread of disease. 
Restriction of Movement (ROM)—Limiting personnel movement to prevent or limit the 
transmission of a communicable disease, including limiting ingress and egress to, from, or on a 
military installation; isolation; and/or quarantine. 
Social Distancing-—-Intervention applied to specific groups, an entire community, or a region 
designed to reduce interactions and thereby transmission risk within the group.  Examples include 
implementing altered work schedules (e.g., telework, staggered shifts) and replacing face-to-face 
meetings with teleconferences. 
Working Quarantine-—Persons are permitted to work but must observe activity restrictions 
while off duty.  Monitoring for fever and other symptoms before reporting for work is usually 
required.  Use of appropriate PPE while at work is required. 
Strategic National Stockpile (SNS)—A national repository of medicine and medical supplies 
maintained by the CDC.  The SNS supplements overwhelmed or depleted state and local medical

Zoonotic Disease—A disease that can be transmitted from animals to people or, more specifically, 
a disease that normally exists in animals but that can infect humans.  There are multitudes of 
zoonotic diseases that are caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites.  Zoonotic diseases can be 
acquired from vector, food, or water sources or through direct contact with animals.  Zoonotic 
diseases can cause a wide variety of symptoms such as diarrhea, muscle aches, and fevers, and can 
be life threatening.
