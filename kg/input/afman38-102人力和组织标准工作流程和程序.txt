Part 1 
STUDY MANAGEMENT 
Chapter 1 
OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Philosophy.  The Manpower and Organization (M&O) function has four core competencies:  
(1) requirements determination, (2) manpower program allocation and control, (3) organization 
structure, and (4) performance management.  These four competencies form the basis for all M&O 
activities.  Specifics regarding the core competencies can be found in their applicable AFIs as 
referenced below. 
1.1.1.  Requirements Determination.  Management Engineering Program (MEP) analysts assist 
senior leaders, commanders, and functional managers, at all levels, in mission accomplishment 
by objectively quantifying manpower requirements for the distribution of Air Force manpower 
resources.  Key services of this competency include peacetime and wartime manpower 
requirements determination.  Integral in any manpower requirements determination effort is 
ensuring quantified workload is required by MAJCOM or higher directives and balances 
efficiency and effectiveness.  Guidance is provided in this AFMAN. 
1.1.2.  Manpower Program Allocation and Control.  Results of requirements determination 
efforts are used to inform the Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution 
(SPPBE) system. 
1.1.3.  Organization Structure.  Concepts and performance guidance are provided in Air Force 
Policy Directive (AFPD) 38-1, Organization and Unit Designations, and AFI 38-101, 
Manpower and Organization. 
1.1.4.  Performance Management.  Performance management is the United States Air Force 
(USAF) construct for a continual performance improvement system that focuses on mission 
accomplishment.  Guidance is provided in DAFI 38-401, Continuous Process Improvement 
(CPI). 
1.2.  Purpose of the Management Engineering Program.  The MEP provides the foundation for 
executing all M&O core competencies and helps senior leaders, commanders, and functional 
managers improve productivity using performance improvement techniques and procedures.  The 
MEP provides the framework for requirements determination and other products and services. 
1.2.1.  Team Approach.  MEP and functional personnel build cohesive teams to reach study 
objectives and achieve productivity improvement goals.  Formal study charters outline specific 
study objectives and responsibilities for all team members to work together to meet those 
objectives. 
1.2.2.  MEP Methodology.  MEP methodology is built utilizing performance improvement 
techniques. 
1.2.2.1.  Performance Improvement.  A systematic look at a function to identify processes 
for potential improvement.  Outcomes, outputs (products and services), processes, capital 
12 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
equipment, facility layout, customers, and suppliers are identified as part of a process 
improvement. 
1.2.2.2.  MEP Tools.  The MEP develops tools and techniques to carry out policy and 
furnishes MEP customer-related technical support.  Analysts at all levels will implement 
the MEP.  (T-2) 
1.3.  General Roles and Responsibilities. 
1.3.1.  Air Force and MAJCOM OPR continually evaluate functions to determine the need to 
update or request development of a requirements determinant.  This includes process changes, 
opportunities for process improvement, organization, and mission changes, as well as 
indicators from Air Force management information systems. 
1.3.2.  MEP analysts will lead and manage study efforts for requirements determinant 
development. 
1.3.2.1.  Complete preliminary research, select site visit locations, develop study plans, 
facilitate study workshops, develop Standard Work Documents (SWD), and develop and 
staff requirements determinants. 
1.3.2.2.  Staff results with appropriate functional office and affected MAJCOMs. 
1.3.3.  Functional personnel are the process owners of a function and make policy decisions.  
Functional personnel commit to study efforts for the duration and coordinate on study products. 
1.3.3.1.  Formally announce study efforts to the field and communicate senior leadership 
commitment. 
1.3.3.2.  Provide a dedicated functional lead to partner with MEP analysts during 
requirements determinant process. 
1.3.3.2.1.  Appoint subject matter experts (SME) to serve as study team members. 
1.3.3.2.2.  Ensure appointed team members and SMEs participate in all workshops 
facilitated by MEP analysts. 
1.3.3.2.3.  Assist in identifying the site visit location(s), coordinate on the study plan, 
and participate in study workshop(s) to develop the SWD. 
1.3.3.2.4.  Review and validate workload data as required. 
1.3.3.2.5.  Ensure all functional process outputs are identified and quantified. 
1.3.3.2.6.  Ensure process improvements are tested as needed. 
1.3.3.2.7.  Staff SWD through functional leadership for approval. 
1.3.4.  The Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency (AFMAA) will approve and post 
requirements determinants. 
1.3.5.  Air National Guard Directorate of Manpower Organization and Resources (ANG/A1M) 
and Air Force Reserve Command Manpower, Organization and Resources Division 
(AFRC/A1M) will approve requirements determinants affecting ANG and AFRC units, 
respectively.

Chapter 2 
STUDY PROCESS 
2.1.  General Concepts.  The goal of requirements determination is to develop a means of 
quantifying manpower requirements.  There are a variety of study types to document manpower 
requirements.  They include Air Force Manpower Determinant (AFMD), Air Force Mission Model 
(AFMM), Logistics Composite Model (LCOM), LCOM Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), and 
Manpower Assessment (MA).  A Management Advisory Study (MAS) is another type of study; 
while it does not determine manpower requirements, it can provide a wide range of consultant 
services (see Chapters 26 and 27). 
Figure 2.1.  Requirements Determination Study Types. 
 
2.1.1.  Figure 2.1  shows the study type options depending on scope and purpose.  The amount 
of time available is an important consideration in selecting the appropriate study type; AFMDs, 
AFMMs, and LCOMs generally take more time to complete than MAs or AoAs. 
2.1.1.1.  MAs are used to address a wide range of special situations and comprise varying 
levels of effort, depth, scope, and applicability.  An MA has a charter and MA report. 
2.1.1.1.1.  Appropriate uses of an MA include: 
2.1.1.1.1.1.  When a lack of experience with new systems makes a formal 
manpower requirements determinant impractical. 
2.1.1.1.1.2.  When a determinant would be short-lived. 
2.1.1.1.1.3.  To determine the initial impact of emerging missions. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
15 
2.1.1.1.1.4.  When leaders require assistance with rapidly evaluating manpower-
related issues. 
2.1.1.1.2.  MA results are documented in a report addressing the specific situation and 
the needs of the requester.  The report may define manpower or man-hour requirements 
as a “snapshot” in time, but not necessarily provide a mechanism to determine or 
predict future manpower needs. 
2.1.1.2.  LCOM and LCOM AoAs specifically determine aircraft maintenance 
requirements and are discussed further in Chapter 20. 
2.1.2.  A requirements determinant is a tool used to determine the minimum level of manpower 
required to support a function or organization based on a function’s work as directed by 
MAJCOM or higher guidance.  It is a quantitative expression representing a work center's 
requirements in response to varying levels of workload and serves to predict future manpower 
requirements.  First steps in the AFMD and AFMM study process include reviewing posted 
requirements determinants. 
2.1.2.1.  Organization Maturity Model (OMM).  If there is no posted requirements 
determinant for a function, an OMM should be completed prior to study start (see Chapter 
3). 
2.1.2.2.  Currency Review (CR).  If there is a posted requirement determinant, a CR should 
be completed prior to starting a new study.  A CR determines if a determinant is accurate, 
in need of revision, or it is obsolete, and the function needs to be restudied (see Chapter 
18). 
2.1.3.  Each study has deliverables.  The purpose of these deliverables is to establish quality 
control points and to provide standardized products during the study process.  The main 
deliverables are: 
2.1.3.1.  The study charter. 
2.1.3.2.  The study plan. 
2.1.3.3.  The SWD and SWD report. 
2.1.3.4.  The AFMD or AFMM and associated reports. 
2.1.4.  Requirements determination studies follow similar progression. 
2.2.  Preliminary Research.  Prior to developing the charter, the study team will begin 
preliminary research.  The primary goal of preliminary research is to understand the function or 
organization. 
2.2.1.  Considerations.  The following should be considered, at a minimum: 
2.2.1.1.  The best proposed study approach. 
2.2.1.2.  The best proposed measurement method(s) and techniques. 
2.2.1.3.  Proper work classifications. 
2.2.1.4.  Special work requirements. 
2.2.1.5.  The minimum desired measurement locations. 
16 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
2.2.1.6.  Potential outputs (e.g., work unit (WU)). 
2.2.1.7.  Potential workload factors (WLF). 
2.2.2.  Documentation Sources.  Document the information needed to design and conduct the 
study.  Potential research sources are: 
2.2.2.1.  Air Force departmental publications. 
2.2.2.2.  Occupational Survey Report. 
2.2.2.3.  Organizational or functional websites. 
2.2.2.4.  Organizational policy and guidance. 
2.2.2.5.  Current and historical manpower documents. 
2.2.2.6.  Reports.  Review productivity reports, DAF survey results, staff assistance visit 
reports, DAF and MAJCOM Inspector General reports, and Government Accountability 
Office reports concerning the function or work center under study. 
2.2.2.7.  Management Inspections.  These reports may contain information concerning the 
drawbacks of present operations.  These reports provide clues concerning manpower 
utilization, process bottlenecks, and present recommendations for improvement. 
2.2.2.8.  Specialty Training Material.  Review Specialty Training Standards, on-the-job 
training (OJT) records, career development courses, and Air Force Specialty course charts 
and outlines. 
2.2.2.9.  Management Information Systems.  Functional area system generated reports may 
aid in the development of historical frequencies of occurrence. 
2.2.2.10.  Equipment and/or Technology.  Review equipment and/or technology 
(machinery or computer systems used, degree of standardization, etc.) listed on the 
automated data processing equipment account and custodian authorization/custody receipt 
listing. 
2.2.3.  Baseline Requirement.  Pull a Unit Manpower Document (UMD) baseline for analysis.  
Query Business Objects from within Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES) 
for total manpower requirements for the function or organization under study. 
2.2.4.  Assigned Strength.  Collect assigned military and civilian strength information from the 
base-level Military Personnel Flight and Civilian Personnel Flight.  Coordinate and validate 
this information with the work center supervisor.  Also, request the supervisor provide 
information on other full-time and/or part-time over hires, contract manpower equivalents 
(CME), or borrowed/loaned personnel.  Finally, obtain information regarding documented, 
uncompensated, or lost overtime or compensatory time. 
2.3.  Study Charter.  The study charter is an agreement between the functional and manpower 
communities.  It identifies all key members and establishes roles and responsibilities.  It defines 
the scope of the study, sets the commitment level for leadership, and establishes the official start 
date.  A well-defined scope clarifies the purpose and study parameters and prevents wasted effort.  
Note:  As the complexity of the effort increases the communication, coordination, level of effort, 
time, and study costs also increase. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
17 
2.3.1.  Study Participants. 
2.3.1.1.  Study Sponsor (SS).  The SS is the owner of the process or function and can make 
policy decisions. 
2.3.1.1.1.  The SS represents the highest appropriate level in the functional 
organization for coordination and should be the individual who has authority to approve 
process improvement initiatives.  The SS commits to the study and provides high-level 
leadership for the functional community for the duration of the study. 
2.3.1.1.2.  Typically, the SS does not participate in day-to-day study activities, but 
delegates this responsibility and authority to a Study Sponsor Representative (SSR).  
The SS signs the charter and reviews and coordinates on study products. 
2.3.1.1.3.  The SS for an AFMD is at the DAF level since these studies apply to 
multiple MAJCOMs.  The SS for an AFMM is at the MAJCOM level since these apply 
to one specific MAJCOM. 
2.3.1.2.  Study Sponsor Representative (SSR).  The SSR is the appointed functional focal 
point who works closely with the study lead to complete the study and ensures milestones 
are met.  Since AFMDs apply to multiple MAJCOMs the SSR is at DAF level and the SSR 
for an AFMM is at MAJCOM level. 
2.3.1.3.  Study Lead.  The study lead is responsible for the processes used to complete the 
study.  The study lead also has management responsibilities for team members. 
2.3.1.4.  Study Team.  The study team consists of the resources assigned to work on the 
study deliverables.  They are responsible for completing assigned work within the budget, 
timeline, and quality expectations; informing the study lead of issues, scope changes, and 
risk and quality concerns; and proactively communicating status and managing 
expectations. 
2.3.1.5.  Additional Team Members.  Depending on study type, additional functional and 
manpower points of contact (POC) are listed in the charter as necessary. 
2.3.2.  Strategic Communications Memorandums.  After the AFMD charter is signed, a memo 
is released by AFMAA to the affected manpower community.  A second memo is provided to 
the SSR for release to the functional community.  The memos notify the affected functional 
and manpower communities of the intent to conduct an AFMD study and provide study POCs.  
Note: A memorandum is not needed for an AFMM because it applies to only one MAJCOM. 
2.4.  Site Visit.  Site visits provide vital research to the study team to build on knowledge gained 
in preliminary research.  Their purpose is to collect additional information to complete the study 
plan. 
2.4.1.  Site Visit Observations.  The local work center is a prime source for initial information 
and a place to ask for work demonstration.  Visit a representative cross-section of locations 
with the SSR.  Discuss and verify findings with the SSR, local managers, and supervisors. 
2.4.1.1.  Use site visit observations to: 
2.4.1.1.1.  Identify processes and outputs for SWD development. 
2.4.1.1.2.  Identify data systems where work unit counts (WUC) are stored. 
18 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
2.4.1.1.3.  Collect WU data from identified systems, working relationships, and 
physical arrangements to increase understanding of procedures and data obtained. 
2.4.1.1.4.  Obtain information on work environment and worker productivity (e.g., 
idleness, work distribution, discipline, cleanliness, work layout, excessive standards of 
living, etc.). 
2.4.1.2.  Use operational audit (OA) good operator timing technique for high volume 
processes with short duration to assist in SWD development.  With observation and 
understanding comes the enhanced ability to identify potential process improvements.  See 
Chapter 5 for OA details. 
2.4.2.  Questionnaires.  A questionnaire is a quick and inexpensive tool to gather information.  
Design questionnaires to collect information not available from other sources and limit them 
to the specific data needed to meet the study objectives.  Ensure the questionnaire serves a 
purpose, has clear objectives, and is formatted to achieve the objectives. 
2.4.3.  Interviews.  The interview research method consists of four steps:  planning, opening, 
controlling, and closing.  Interviewing has two advantages, flexibility, and the ability to 
uncover information not documented elsewhere.  Personal and group interviews may be used 
for gathering information.  Both techniques provide valuable information, but each has 
advantages and disadvantages. 
2.4.3.1.  Personal Interviews.  The primary objective of personal interviews is to collect 
information on what and how work is done, operating procedures, and workload volume. 
2.4.3.1.1.  Provide interviewees with an agenda (time, subject, and material). 
2.4.3.1.2.  Keep interviews informal but follow the organizational structure by starting 
at the top with commanders or flight chiefs.  Different personnel levels provide 
different information and perspectives based on experiences in the organization.  
Personal interviews reveal management’s general attitude and knowledge of the people 
who work for them.  Interviews can also be used to gather customer requirements and 
obtain leadership perspectives for the future. 
2.4.3.1.2.1.  Chief enlisted managers and 9-skill level superintendents provide 
broad career field information and current career field issues; however, technical 
familiarity with lower-level tasks and procedures may not be current.  In some 
fields, the superintendent manages several career groups and has no or very limited 
current lower-level work experience. 
2.4.3.1.2.2.  The 7-skill level provides the best technical information. 
2.4.3.1.2.3.  The 5-skill level provides the best information about processes and 
activities done within the work center. 
2.4.3.1.2.4.  The 3-skill level can often present an unbiased opinion from a fresh 
eyes perspective. 
2.4.3.1.3.  Individual interviews are more time-intensive but yield more data than a 
group interview.  The analyst focuses questions to a specific individual without having 
other group members waiting.  This allows each participant to provide a unique 
perspective without being overshadowed by other members of the group. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
19 
2.4.3.1.4.  A disadvantage is personal interviews are not always complete, precise, or 
accurate.  Sometimes personnel withhold valuable information, divulge inaccuracies, 
or simply give information that sounds good.  When in doubt, verify the information 
with the source or a supervisor.  Sources of information given in confidence should not 
be revealed unless required by competent authority. 
2.4.3.2.  Group Interviews.  Group interviews are effective when time is limited and 
disagreement among personnel is strong.  Group interviews normally result in consensus, 
eliminating major disagreements.  Information provided by one participant often helps 
other participants recall details and requirements.  A disadvantage is groupthink versus 
individual expertise. 
2.4.4.  Additional Research.  The preceding paragraphs identify the best practices for site visits 
but are not all inclusive.  The study lead should always be thinking of other ways to research 
and become familiar with the function.  As the study lead progresses with the study, 
background knowledge of the function, and ability to think through potential issues will aid 
them in developing a comprehensive and successful study plan. 
2.5.  Study Plan.  The study plan outlines the approach to completing the study by documenting 
methodology and scope, baseline, timelines, deliverables, POCs, and other pertinent information.  
It documents how the study team intends to accomplish the necessary actions, with completion 
dates, to complete study steps up to staffing (workshop, developing draft SWD and report, SWD 
approval, and requirements determinant development and report ready for staffing and approval). 
2.5.1.  One of the first decisions the study lead makes during study plan development is the 
general study approach.  All study approaches require the study lead to evaluate current 
processes for potential improvement and ensure approved initiatives are implemented prior to 
determining man-hour or manpower requirements. 
2.5.2.  Depending on the nature of the work center under study, the following should be 
considered: 
2.5.2.1.  If detailed work measurement is deemed appropriate, consider: 
2.5.2.1.1.  What data is needed and how is the data to be collected?  For example, is 
workshop measurement the primary means to gather per accomplishment times (PAT) 
and task frequency? 
2.5.2.1.2.  Which work measurement technique(s) or tools are to be employed to 
measure the work? 
2.5.2.1.3.  What other data (e.g., historical workload counts, authorized and assigned 
strength, etc.) is collected for follow-on analysis and requirements determinant 
development? 
2.5.2.1.4.  Which statistical tools are to be employed to determine data normalcy and 
man-hour model development? 
2.5.2.1.5.  Are there levels of service issues that need to be considered? 
2.5.2.1.6.  The selection of a particular approach and/or measurement technique should 
be fully justified and logical.  If these criteria cannot be met with an initial approach, 
an alternative approach and/or work measurement method should be utilized. 
20 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
2.5.2.2.  If a detailed work measurement is not appropriate, consider if an accurate 
requirements determinant may be developed via other MEP techniques (i.e., functional 
model, directed requirement, staffing pattern, post/position requirement) not requiring 
detailed measurement.  Note:  Non-measurement methods are normally the most expensive 
methods, i.e., non-measurement methods are more likely to produce requirements results 
not as efficient as those produced via measurement methods. 
2.6.  Standard Work Document Development.  The draft SWD is a description of the function’s 
required work which is documented using process flowcharts, narrative descriptions, functional 
statements, or any combination of the three.  SWD development is typically done through 
workshops.  A workshop is defined as a scheduled meeting with a predefined agenda, facilitated 
by the study lead, and attended by functional SMEs and SSR.  The SWD report documents how 
the SWD was developed to include a function’s identification, mission, organization structure, 
study approach and scope, site visits, SWD development participants, Statement of Conditions 
(SOC), and potential process improvements.  For specific workshop details refer to Chapter 6. 
2.7.  Standard Work Document Approval.  Draft SWD and report are sent to SSR for approval.  
The SWD is the functional community’s document reflecting required work.  For AFMDs, the 
SSR works with MAJCOM functional managers (MFM) for their review.  For AFMMs, the 
MAJCOM SSR works with base level functional managers.  The SSR works with the study lead 
to adjudicate any comments and update the SWD as needed.  SSR will brief SS before approving 
the SWD.  The approved SWD is posted on the AFMAA SharePoint (or ANG/AFRC SharePoint 
equivalent).  An AFMD or AFMM is developed after SWD approval. 
2.8.  Air Force Manpower Determinant/Air Force Mission Model Development. 
2.8.1.  The draft AFMD/AFMM determines a function’s requirement based on varying levels 
of work.  It normally contains standard data (approval date, applicability, equations, workload 
factors, and POCs), application instructions, SOC, and applicable attachments (glossary of 
references and supporting information, manpower tables, and variances, etc.). 
2.8.2.  The report documents how the AFMD/AFMM was developed and includes an executive 
summary, work center and measurement information, data collection and analysis, 
computations summary, manpower model selected, Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) and 
grade determination, variance data analysis, workload factor (WLF) information, and internal 
model application. 
2.9.  Air Force Manpower Determinant/Air Force Mission Model Coordination.  Draft 
AFMD/AFMM are sent to applicable MAJCOM Manpower, Organization and Resources 
Divisions (MAJCOM/A1M) for coordination and trial application.  MAJCOM/A1Ms work with 
MFMs to review draft AFMD/AFMM, complete trial application and provide comments in a 
comment resolution matrix (CRM).  The study lead adjudicates comments and updates draft 
AFMD/AFMM as needed.  Since AFMDs apply to multiple MAJCOMs, the AFMD is also 
coordinated at DAF level with charter signatories after AFMAA leadership has been briefed on 
MAJCOM coordination.

ORGANIZATION MATURITY MODEL ASSESSMENT 
3.1.  Overview. 
3.1.1.  The OMM is a facilitated assessment of an organization’s or functional’s operations.  
The model utilizes 18 questions, aligned with AFI 1-2, Commander’s Responsibilities, divided 
into four domains:  Process Domain (seven questions), Data Domain (four questions), 
Resource Domain (four questions), and Organizational Domain (three questions).  The OMM 
Tool can be accessed through the AFMAA SharePoint.  See Table 3.1 for a list of the questions 
categories within each domain.  Note:  The OMM is a tool specifically designed to help leaders 
improve operations and to help study teams scope measurement efforts.  There are no 
repercussions associated with the scores. 
3.1.2.  Each question and domain are scored from 0 to 5.  This score is associated with the 
following maturity levels:  (0) Unaware, (1) Informal, (2) Documented, (3) Integrated, (4)

3.1.3.  An OMM is conducted by an analyst who operates the tool and facilitates a group of 
SMEs through the assessment questions.  During the assessment, the analyst will document 
the maturity level assessed for each question, as well as evidence and observations to support 
the score.  The score and associated notes are combined and provided to the assessed 
organization in the form of an Assessment Report. 
3.1.4.  The OMM is a scalable tool. 
3.1.4.1.  The tool can be applied at any level from a flight to a MAJCOM. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
23 
3.1.4.2.  Multiple OMMs can be performed within the same organization and combine 
results to give leaders a more detailed picture of the organization’s performance.  The 
number of OMMs conducted will depend on the assessed organization’s desired result. 
3.1.4.3.  For example, a single OMM performed for a Maintenance Group will result in 
vague observations and actions, as all subordinate units will be summarized in one report.  
Some best practices or high performing sections may be missed due to the OMM scoring 
process.  A more detailed assessment could be achieved by performing OMMs on each 
subordinate squadron, then combining the results in a final report for the group leadership.  
To achieve the best result, the analyst should communicate with the organization’s 
leadership, determine the level of depth and time commitment desired by the organization, 
and recommend the optimal number of OMMs required to achieve the desired result. 
3.2.  Organization Maturity Model Lenses of Application.  There are two lenses of OMM 
implementation:  Performance Management and Requirements Determinant. 
3.2.1.  Performance Management Lens.  If the intent is to help an organization improve 
performance, the analyst(s) will perform the full 18 question assessment and provide targeted 
recommendations to the assessed organization’s leaders based on the results and evidence 
identified during the assessment (see Table 3.1.).  When utilizing the performance 
management approach, the action plan will be focused on improving operations through 
strategic planning, metrics development, process improvement, and other categories that can 
help an organization become more efficient and better utilize resources.  When utilizing the 
OMM through this lens, consider the OMM as a method for scoping further consulting work 
that can be done within the assessed organization to help with performance improvement (see 
Chapter 26).  It can also help identify areas to perform a Manpower Advisory Study (MAS) 
within an organization (see Chapter 27). 
3.2.2.  Requirements Determinant Lens.  In addition to helping identifying improvement 
opportunities for an organization, the OMM can also be used during the preliminary research 
step of a requirements determinant study. 
3.2.2.1.  When performing the OMM, the analyst only utilizes eight study essential 
questions within the tool (see Table 3.2.). 
3.2.2.2.  The eight essential questions narrow the focus of the assessment on categories that 
will provide the study team knowledge on areas critical to the success of a study:  policy, 
standard processes, outputs, and data.  Identification of these items can help a study team 
scope the level of effort and plan the next steps within the study process.

3.3.  Organization Maturity Model Assessment Process Overview.  Implementation of the 
OMM follows a standard process flow (see Figure 3.1), however, the analyst has flexibility to 
adjust or deviate from the process.  Approximate timelines are provided, but these can be adjusted 
based on the needs of the analyst and organization being assessed.  Note:  Times given are 
approximations for use when developing an agenda and scoping the OMM.  Times may vary 
depending on the number of OMMs required per organization or function.  Additional OMM 
information and templates are available on the AFMAA SharePoint website. 
Figure 3.1.  OMM Standard Process Flow. 
 
3.3.1.  Initial Contact and Coordination (one to two weeks prior to assessment).  Each OMM 
begins with identifying a representative within the organization being assessed.  This 
representative will act as the main scheduling POC.  Their responsibilities include identifying 
the SME group which will answer the OMM questions, scheduling the assessment, scheduling 
briefs with the assessed organization’s leadership, guiding the analyst on the Gemba (go-and-
see) walk, and assisting with evidence collection following the assessment. 
3.3.2.  In-brief (approximate time, two hours).  During the in-brief, the analyst presents the 
schedule, presents basic facts and outcome of the OMM, and answers questions.  This is also 
a time for the organization or function being assessed to present relevant mission information 
to the analyst. 
3.3.3.  Gemba (Go-and-See) (approximate time, four hours).  Conducted by the analyst prior 
to conducting the OMM workshop with the SME group.  The analyst, accompanied by the 
POC, walks through the organization, and observes the processes as they happen in real time.  
The Gemba provides the analyst an opportunity to see how the work in the organization is 
conducted first-hand.  The analyst should look for evidence that will support answers to the 
OMM questions and for facts about the organization that will help facilitate discussion. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
25 
3.3.4.  Assessment and Scoring (approximate time, four hours). 
3.3.4.1.  Following the Gemba, the analyst will sit with a group of, ideally, six to eight 
SMEs from the organization being assessed.  This working group should consist of a mix 
of workers and managers, who can speak to the work being done and the organization’s 
strategy. 
3.3.4.2.  During the assessment, the analyst utilizes the OMM tool to facilitate the SME 
group through all questions and levels being assessed.  The analyst begins with the first 
question at the informal level, presents the question and the informal level indicator, and 
then allows the group to respond.  If the group agrees their organization meets the 
requirement, the analyst should ask for evidence to document and ask for additional 
information if necessary.  If the criteria are met, the analyst will move the group to the 
documented level indicator.  The analyst continues through the question levels in this way 
until the SME group agrees they do not meet the proposed level, or the SME group cannot 
find consensus.  The SME group must be in complete agreement for the organization to 
meet the level proposed.  Once the rating is determined, the analyst selects the score and 
continues to the next question.  See Figure 3.2 for the scoring logic map visual. 
Figure 3.2.  OMM Question Rating Logic Progression. 
 
3.3.4.3.  Each question, domain, and overall OMM is rated on a scale from (0) Unaware to 
(5) Optimized.  The following provides a detailed explanation of each rating score: 
3.3.4.3.1.  Unaware (Rating Score:  0).  An Unaware Function:  unaware, unsure.  At 
this level of maturity, the function does not have knowledge or evidence to support any 
questions within the OMM assessment. 
3.3.4.3.2.  Informal (Rating Score:  1).  An Informal Function:  initial, informal, 
inconsistent, limited, lacking structure, reactionary, ad-hoc, chaotic.  At this level of 
maturity, the function is performing activities that satisfy the basic goals of the 
functional area.  It produces work products; however, it does not have documented 
standard work processes.  The activities being performed have not been documented 
and are person-dependent, and the sequence, timing, and results vary during repetition.  
There are no guarantees of either achieving the desired results or adhering to timelines.  
26 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
Activities are ad hoc, with little communication.  Knowledge transfer does not happen 
when there is a change in an activity.  Results of process improvement initiatives are 
observed, but not quantified.  Outputs are not widely understood or known. 
3.3.4.3.3.  Documented (Rating Score:  2).  A Documented Function:  initiating, 
documenting, emerging, updating, collecting, organizing, generating, managing.  At 
this level of maturity, a documented function has the basic infrastructure in place to 
support the processes being performed; however, a standardized process has not been 
deployed at all locations.  Strategy exists to establish standard work to effect best 
practices.  Leading areas are implementing standard work and standard processes are 
being documented and/or updated to be implemented.  Outputs are understood and 
known but are not being tracked for decision-making capabilities.  Knowledge 
management or information sharing, and collaboration exist in some areas, but a 
functional-wide knowledge management strategy does not exist. 
3.3.4.3.4.  Integrated (Rating Score:  3).  An Integrated Function:  progressing, defined, 
structured, integrated, measured, competent.  At this level of maturity, a function has 
managed activities in place.  Best practice processes are documented, used, and 
instituted throughout the entire functional community.  There is no inconsistency 
between the documented process and the deployed process.  The policy is current and 
driving standard work.  Outputs are standardized, defined, and measurable.  Tracking 
systems are implemented for decision-making capabilities.  A project management 
process is implemented to track progress or detailed process improvement projects 
against milestones, with feedback provided to leadership.  An organizational-wide 
knowledge management strategy exists for information sharing, collaboration, 
decision-making, and content management.  Note:  An organization should strive to 
reach this level of maturity. 
3.3.4.3.5.  Strategic (Rating Score:  4).  A Strategic Function:  strategic, aligned, 
disciplined, predictable, quantitatively managed.  At this level of maturity, a function 
is measured, has defined (documented) processes controlled using statistical and other 
quantitative techniques.  Quantitative objectives for quality and process performance 
are used in managing the process.  Processes are predictable and managed 
appropriately.  The processes have set goals (adherence to timelines, customer 
satisfaction, cost, etc.) and are being measured against their goals.  Standard work is 
continuously improved and driving achievement through performance goals.  Leaders 
utilize process improvement, lessons learned, knowledge management, and 
performance measurements to continuously refine output data and align policy and 
guidance.  The function has central, user-friendly knowledge management tools in 
place.  Some automation has been deployed. 
3.3.4.3.6.  Optimized (Rating Score:  5).  An Optimized Function:  optimizing, 
innovative, adaptive, opportunistic, synthesized, proactive, agile.  At this level of 
maturity, a function has strategic processes that are optimized and regularly improved 
based on the understanding of common causes in variation.  The focus is on continually 
improving the range of process performance.  Standard work is integrated with other 
functions to optimize the DAF enterprise performance and/or to deliver the highest 
customer value.  Processes are continuously and systematically improved.  Leaders 
have easy access to the information they need to make decisions.  Leaders use 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
27 
knowledge management processes and lessons learned to inform the overall strategy 
and drive innovation.  Automation systems are in place and provide near-real-time data 
for optimal decision-making capabilities. 
3.3.5.  Evidence Collection (approximate time, four hours).  The analyst will document all 
potential evidence to support answers provided by SMEs during the working group.  The 
analyst will work with the POC to view and collect (if necessary) evidence supporting the 
score.  If the evidence does not support the level assessed, the analyst should adjust the score 
to an appropriate level. 
3.3.6.  Assessment Report. 
3.3.6.1.  The OMM tool generates a draft report compiling the results, recommendations, 
and score card in-line with AFI 1-2, Commanders Responsibilities.  The analyst adapts the 
report to meet any additional needs and scope initially requested by the customer and 
presents the report to the organization’s leadership. 
3.3.6.2.  The assessment report should provide the overall assessment score, the score for 
each question, and a recommendation summary.  The analyst should explain what actions 
can be taken to improve the overall assessment score and explain how the manpower core 
competencies can be used to help the organization (see Chapter 26). 
3.3.6.3.  For requirements determination focused OMMs, the assessment report should 
indicate if the function is ready to be studied.  If a function is ready, the assessment report 
should help scope the next steps.  If the function is not ready, the report should provide 
recommendations. 
3.3.7.  Out-brief (approximate time, two hours).  Following the assessment, the analyst should 
develop and present an out-brief to the organization’s leadership team.  This brief should 
provide an overview of the key findings and provide information on how to utilize the 
assessment results.

DEFINING WORK 
Chapter 4 
DEFINING AND DOCUMENTING WORK 
4.1.  General Concepts.  The foundation of any requirements determinant study is the ability to 
correctly define and document work in a SWD.  This chapter provides an overview of how to 
define and document work.  It also outlines policies and procedures for defining and documenting 
the work. 
4.2.  Defining Work.  When developing the SWD, analyze the work center’s activities to classify 
them as productive, nonavailable, or not allowed (e.g., assumed work or inferred work).  Use 
Tables 4.1 and 4.2 to assist in conducting analysis.  Proper accountability of special work 
requirements (flying requirements, travel, supervision, OJT, and cleanup) may be confusing or 
difficult.  Refer to Table 4.3 for rules on how to handle special circumstances.

2. Use appropriate indirect task description from IAF as direct work.  Management or overhead 
work can have direct processes which describe indirect work when it is performed in support of 
personnel in subordinate work centers.  This is in addition to the standard indirect categories to 
support people inside the overhead work center.  IN ALL CASES, ensure the "same" work is 
not counted twice.

establish a separate step for each time 
travel is performed (see note 1).

efforts.  In a post/position manning work 
center, where certification is maintained 
and personnel are attending training in 
addition to shift work, training would be 
considered direct work, and Post/Position 
Qualification Time (PQT) would be 
calculated to provide required man-hours.

Notes: 
1.  Ensure credit for travel is not double counted in the steps or processes identified. 
2.  Indirect tasks can be reflected as both direct and indirect in management or overhead work centers.  However, 
when documented as direct work, the processes reflect steps to support personnel in subordinate work centers 
while the indirect categories reflect steps to support people inside the overhead work center.  Ensure direct 
processes are written clearly and do not duplicate indirect work included in the IAF. 
3.  There may be other duties performed by the work center’s personnel (e.g., snow/ice removal) that may or may 
not be creditable to the work center.  Use the decision logic in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 to determine how this work 
should be classified. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
31 
4.2.1.  Productive Work.  There are two categories of productive work activities:  direct work 
and indirect work.  Direct work is documented in the SWD, while indirect work is normally 
addressed by application of an IAF. 
4.2.1.1.  Direct work activities are required by MAJCOM or higher directives, are essential 
to and directly support the work center’s mission and can be identified with a particular 
service or end or final product accurately, logically, and without undue effort or expense. 
4.2.1.2.  Indirect work activities are considered productive work.  However, indirect work 
is done in support of the function, does not add value to a product, and may not be readily 
identifiable with a specific output or service.  It is not usually necessary to measure indirect 
work.  Rather, application of an IAF is accomplished to credit a work center for standard 
indirect man-hour requirements.  The IAF is discussed in more detail in paragraph 4.3.10. 
4.2.2.  Nonavailable Activities.  There are activities directed, approved, or recognized by the 
Air Force making people unavailable to perform assigned primary duties.  Therefore, this time 
should not be included in the SWD.  For more information about nonavailable activities, refer 
to the military and civilian MAF reports located on the AFMAA SharePoint site. 
4.2.3.  Not Allowed.  Inferred or assumed workloads are not included when developing a 
requirements determinant, so careful analysis of the work activity against Tables 4.1 and 4.2 
is required. 
4.2.3.1.  Inferred Work.  Workload defined as the responsibility of a function other than 
the one under development.  When MAJCOM and higher headquarters guidance conflict, 
the higher headquarters guidance prevails. 
4.2.3.2.  Assumed Work.  Work being done not necessary to accomplish the Air Force 
mission and is not required by MAJCOM or higher directive. 
4.2.4.  Infrequent Work.  A tenet of requirement determinants development is to document the 
minimum number of man-hours needed to perform a given mission at various monthly average 
levels of workload (normally based on a 12-month period).  Manpower or man-hours are not 
provided at peak workload nor reduced for sharp declines in workload levels that may be 
experienced by a work center.  Rather, man-hours for peaks and valleys of workload are 
averaged throughout the year.  Determinants attempting to set manpower at peak workload 
requirements inflate man-hour costs.  The requirements determinant is set to the norm, and 
leadership manages to the exception (i.e., managing the peak workload when it happens). 
4.2.4.1.  Actions to reduce the impact of peak demand may include the transfer of work 
from one period to another or the revision of procedures to spread the workload over a 
longer cycle.  The function may also opt to accommodate peak demand via management 
actions such as overtime or temporary over hire employment.  Refer to Chapter 8 for 
further details regarding Man-hour Shift-Profile Analysis. 
4.2.4.2.  Infrequent tasks (i.e., those occurring less than once per year) should not be 
ignored or dismissed without looking at the bigger picture.  Independently, these taskings 
may seem to cause minor spikes in needed man-hours however, combined, these spikes 
may cause a higher and almost steady state of workload throughout the year.  In conjunction 
with the functional manager, the analyst should analyze and address these peak demand 
situations. 
32 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
4.2.4.3.  The analysis results, decisions, and related actions concerning peak demands 
driven by infrequent work should be documented in the requirements determinant report. 
4.3.  Time Classification Considerations. 
4.3.1.  On-Call Time.  On-call time is a period of time an off-duty worker is available at a 
prearranged off-duty location and can be reached by telephone or other means.  When 
authorized work is required and cannot be held over to the next duty day, credit the work center 
with productive time expended and the travel time needed to get to the job site and return to 
the off-duty location.  Off-duty time spent waiting for a call is not measured or included in 
requirements determinants. 
4.3.2.  Borrowed Time.  Borrowed time is time provided by personnel authorized and assigned 
to another work center but used to do productive work within the work center that is part of 
the requirements determinant development. 
4.3.3.  Loaned Time.  Loaned time is time expended by work center personnel to do work 
which is the responsibility of another work center. 
4.3.4.  Standby Time.  This is time spent in a ready status awaiting work when work is 
unavailable (for example, the time a taxi driver waits to be dispatched).  Include standby time 
only when it is essential to do the mission and when no other work (direct or indirect) can be 
accomplished. 
4.3.5.  Nonavailable Time (NAT).  This is time work center personnel spend participating in 
activities directed, recognized, or approved by the Air Force which render them unavailable 
for assigned primary duties.  Nonavailable time is accounted for through the MAF.  The major 
groupings of nonavailable activities are leave, permanent change of station related, medical, 
organizational duties, education and training, transition assistance program, and 
miscellaneous.  Refer to the military and civilian MAF reports on the AFMAA SharePoint site. 
4.3.6.  Overtime.  Uncompensated overtime is the productive time spent in excess of regularly 
scheduled duty hours.  This time is used to do productive work and cannot be caused by 
nonproductive activities or offset by compensatory time.  For civilians, include only overtime 
documented according to AFI 36-128, Pay Setting and Allowances.  For military personnel, 
document and thoroughly analyze the need for overtime.  Ask the supervisor to validate 
overtime.  If overtime is a normal occurrence, visit the work center during overtime periods 
and observe the work in progress.  Identify the backlog driving the overtime work.  Determine 
if the backlog is at unacceptable or growing levels. 
4.3.7.  Idle Time.  This includes time spent by a worker in an avoidable delay status, doing 
unnecessary work, or doing work not job-related.  Idle time is not included in a requirements 
determinant. 
4.3.8.  Avoidable Delay.  Any unnecessary delay, regardless of source, that causes work 
stoppage.  Time lost to avoidable delay is not included in the determinant.  Note:  When 
conducting simulation modeling, it may be necessary to measure and/or model avoidable 
delays to produce realistic scenario results; however, man-hours are still not provided in final 
requirements determinant. 
4.3.9.  Unavoidable Delay.  An occurrence that is essential and outside the worker’s control or 
responsibility preventing the accomplishment of productive work.  Time lost to an unavoidable 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
33 
delay is included in the determinant as part of the Personal, Fatigue, and Delay (PF&D) 
allowance depending on the work measurement method used (see Chapter 23). 
4.3.10.  Quantifying Indirect Workload and the IAF General Concepts and Principles. 
4.3.10.1.  The IAF represents a portion of total productive work and is used to quantify 
productive, indirect work man-hours associated with the following nine standard indirect 
work activities:  (1) civilian employee administration; (2) officer administration; (3) 
enlisted administration; (4) work center administration; (5) administrative support; (6) 
prepares for, conducts, or attends meeting; (7) training administration; (8) supply 
administration; (9) inspects and cleans work area. 
4.3.10.2.  The IAF is the monthly man-hour allowance factor to perform indirect duties.  It 
is applied as a percentage of total monthly direct man-hours to determine the total monthly 
allowed man-hours required by the work center.  Refer to the IAF report located on the 
AFMAA SharePoint site. 
4.3.10.3.  The IAF defines allowed indirect work.  This work is classified as indirect only 
when it is in support of the work center where it is done.  Work accomplished in support 
of subordinate work centers is classified as direct work.  In the latter case, these work 
centers are called "overhead" functions because of direct management responsibility for 
two or more subordinate work centers.  This means for overhead functions it is possible to 
have the same activity titles listed under both direct and indirect processes. 
4.3.11.  Application of the IAF.  Indirect work is accounted for as a separate factor applied 
outside the model during the manpower requirements determination process.  Directions are 
included in the requirements determinant application instructions, addressing the applicable 
IAF and how to apply it.  The analyst should first determine total direct man-hours by adjusting 
the results of the basic manpower equation with applicable variances.  The analyst selects the 
IAF, per application instructions, and multiply the sum of direct man-hours by the IAF.  This 
product reflects the total monthly man-hours required by the work center.  Conversion to full-
time equivalents (FTE) is accomplished by dividing total monthly man-hours by the applicable 
MAF and uses the appropriate rounding rule to determine the FTE. 
4.4.  Documenting Work in the Standard Work Document.  The SWD contains outputs and 
sources of count, process descriptions, standard activity descriptions, standard process times, and 
standard activity times (SAT).  The SWD is a full description of the function’s required work 
which can be defined using process flowchart, narrative description, a functional statement, 
directed requirement, staffing pattern, or post/position manning.  The SWD is completed by 
compiling the individual processes plus any additional work not directly related to an output.  SWD 
development is typically done through workshops.  A workshop is defined as a scheduled meeting 
with a predefined agenda, facilitated by the study lead, and attended by functional SMEs.  The 
functional representative selects SMEs based on experience and knowledge.  For specific 
workshop details refer to Chapter 6. 
4.4.1.  Components of the SWD.  The minimum components are the process number, process 
title, process time, standard activity description, SAT, and workload data definition and 
specific source of count.  This information is required (1) to capture required work, and (2) for 
subsequent requirements determinant development.  The SWD is the basic building block of 
the determinant and is written to facilitate work measurement and data analysis and 
34 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
computations.  Functional characteristics, e.g., complexity, stability, and degree of 
standardization, influence the level of SWD detail, the selection of the measurement approach, 
and the ultimate maintenance of the determinant.  Note:  Ensure the SWD content reflects only 
mission-essential processes assigned to the work center being studied and governed by a 
MAJCOM or higher directive.  Omit assumed or inferred workload.  To build a good SWD, 
develop an accurate and understandable definition for each process step. 
4.4.1.1.  A process is a sequence of work activities with a definitive input and output.  A 
process involves worker interaction with such things as equipment, material, other people, 
and information.  Structure processes independently and mutually exclusive of each other. 
4.4.1.2.  Standard Activity Description.  An activity description may only need a short 
phrase (e.g., repairs carburetor), or it may need a breakout of the process into several steps 
(e.g., disassembles carburetor, replaces part, reassembles carburetor, and inspects 
carburetor). 
4.4.1.2.1.  A detailed description is suitable when an operation is highly repetitive, and 
a specific sequence of steps are followed. 
4.4.1.2.2.  A less detailed description is suitable when a process can be done in a variety 
of ways.  For example, management, research, and problem-solving activities may 
follow different steps each time completed; therefore, those activities can only be 
described in general terms. 
4.4.1.3.  The work measurement method selected: 
4.4.1.3.1.  A measurement method such as OA usually needs processes defined at the 
activity level to ensure accuracy of data. 
4.4.1.3.2.  For work sampling (WS), the sampling level dictates the degree of detail 
needed.  If sampling is done at the process level, a listing of step titles or a grouping of 
the steps in sentence format may provide enough detail for measurement. 
4.4.1.3.3.  In all cases, clearly write descriptions in enough detail so the analyst can 
identify when an activity occurs during measurement. 
4.4.1.3.4.  Setting up the correct descriptions is a repetitive procedure requiring the 
analyst to use good judgment and common sense. 
4.4.1.3.4.1.  Steps made purposely broad to cover as much work as possible can 
increase interpretation problems, cause inaccurate measurement, and hinder data 
analysis. 
4.4.1.3.4.2.  Steps not accurately reflecting duties and responsibilities increase the 
chance for inaccurate measurement. 
4.4.1.3.4.3.  Steps too detailed may result in an unclear sequence of events. 
4.4.2.  Preparation of the SWD. 
4.4.2.1.  Clearly state process titles and accurately describe the steps that are grouped under 
each activity.  Use a noun form or an adjective and a noun form (e.g., management, minor 
maintenance, officer classification, record processing).  Make the process titles descriptive 
and easily identifiable. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
35 
4.4.2.2.  State step titles in a single unit form with verbs in third person singular.  Processes 
are described at the activity level only (e.g., 1.1., 1.2., 2.3., etc.).  In WS measurement, 
processes are described to the level necessary for accurate measurement.  In either case, 
each definitive step of the process, from the beginning (input) to the end (output), are 
described in the sequence as it occurs in the process.  This increases the chances of getting 
accurate unit times and frequencies at the time of measurement.  Titles that are vague or 
written in plural form increase the chance of error in the associated unit time values and 
may make later analysis of data harder.  The same step title may be used in different 
processes.  For example, "Reviews Unit Manpower Document" could be a step in 
processing a manpower authorization change request or in the process of applying a 
requirements determinant.  See Table 4.4 for examples of acceptable and unacceptable step 
titles. 
Table 4.4.  Examples of Acceptable and Unacceptable Step Titles.

4.4.2.2.1.  Including an indirect statement in the SWD is optional.  If it is included, use 
the following statement: 
INDIRECT:  Indirect work involves those tasks which are not readily identifiable with the work 
center’s specific product or service.  The major categories of standard indirect work are:  
administers civilian, officer, and enlisted personnel; directs work center activity; provides 
administrative support; prepares for and conducts/attends meeting; administers training; manages 
supplies; maintains equipment; and performs cleanup. 
4.4.2.2.2.  Format the SWD using the template provided on the AFMAA SharePoint 
site. 
4.4.3.  SWD Approval.  The SWD is sent to the SSR and MAJCOM/A1Ms. 
4.4.3.1.  The SSR will send to MFMs for coordination.  The SSR compiles all CRMs (one 
per MAJCOM), adjudicates comments, and, with study lead assistance, updates SWD and 
SWD report with any adjustments.  The SSR will brief the SS and approve the SWD.  Once 
the SWD is approved, the functional community implements and owns the SWD.  The 
SWD is posted on the AFMAA SharePoint. 
4.4.3.2.  The MAJCOM/A1Ms, with Installation Manpower Office (IMO) assistance, will 
review the SWD for missing core workload or MAJCOM unique workload (variance) and 
notify the command MFMs for submission back to the SSR. 
4.5.  Variances.  A variance is a condition that either adds to or subtracts from the core workload 
identified in the SWD or impacts the way the work is performed and accounts for different 
operating conditions. 
36 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
4.5.1.  Types of Variances.  Note:  Each type of variance can have either a positive or negative 
effect on requirements. 
4.5.1.1.  Environmental.  Accounts for different operating conditions from those used to 
develop the core manpower determinant (e.g., snow, geographical separation, etc.). 
4.5.1.2.  Mission.  Accounts for different operating processes from those used to develop 
the core manpower requirements. 
4.5.1.3.  Technological.  Accounts for different operating equipment from those used to 
develop the core manpower requirements. 
4.5.2.  Variance Development and Responsibilities. 
4.5.2.1.  MAJCOM/A1Ms.  Forward draft SWD to IMO for review with the functional 
POC.  Review variances received from IMOs with MFM.  Submits validated or approved 
variances to study team.  Note:  MAJCOM/A1Ms may submit variances outside of 
requirements determinant development to AFMAA. 
4.5.2.2.  IMOs.  Identify MAJCOM or installation unique mission, environmental, or 
technological variances using Work Center Analysis Record and provide calculated 
manpower estimates with the OA Workbook.  Transactional work should be documented 
in a process flowchart and non-transactional work should be documented in a functional 
statement or narrative description.  Both templates are provided on the AFMAA 
SharePoint.  Note:  Unless otherwise instructed, installation or command unique variances 
are the responsibility of applicable installation or MAJCOM to develop.  If additional time 
is required, this does not stop the requirements determination study process. 
4.5.3.  Variance Approval. 
4.5.3.1.  A DAF variance, applicable to more than one MAJCOM, is approved by AFMAA 
with SSR coordination. 
4.5.3.2.  A MAJCOM variance, applicable to one MAJCOM, is approved by the 
MAJCOM/A1M with MFM coordination.

Part 3 
MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES 
Chapter 5 
OPERATIONAL AUDIT 
5.1.  General Concepts.  The determination for using OA as the primary measurement technique 
is established early in the study process.  The OA measurement methods encompass several non-
engineering work measurement techniques using values at the process step level to determine the 
man-hours for a particular standard. 
5.1.1.  OA Versatility.  OA is one of the Air Force MEP’s most flexible and widely utilized 
work measurement methods.  It is used for setting activity times and frequencies (FREQ) when 
alternate methods are not appropriate.  This method can be used to measure workload in 
practically any type of work center (e.g., production, administration, supervision, etc.).  OA 
can also be used to supplement time study (see Chapter 21) or WS (see Chapter 24). 
5.1.2.  Definitions. 
5.1.2.1.  Per Accomplishment Time (PAT).  The time it takes to accomplish a single task 
one time. 
5.1.2.2.  Standard Activity Time (SAT).  When a PAT is validated and included in a SWD 
it becomes a SAT. 
5.1.2.3.  Normal Time (NT).  When a PAT is adjusted by the pace rating it becomes a NT.  
See Chapter 22. 
5.1.2.4.  Leveled Time.  An average time adjusted to reflect differentiating factors in 
operator performance, such as effort, skill, and work conditions. 
5.1.2.5.  Standard Time (ST). 
5.1.2.5.1.  The time that is considered necessary for a qualified worker, working at a 
normal pace under capable supervision and experiencing normal rest and delays, to do 
a definite amount of work of specified quality when the prescribed method is followed. 
5.1.2.5.2.  Time measured by use of rigid statistical methods, for example, time study. 
5.1.2.5.3.  The normal or leveled time plus allowances for rest and unavoidable delays. 
5.2.  Preparation.  The analyst prepares in advance for OA to ensure the accuracy and validity of 
the data. 
5.2.1.  Check the SWD and functionally coordinated/defined SOC with work center personnel.  
A SOC identifies the environment and impact of conditional factors on the time needed to 
perform work center activities and identifies the basis for deviations and the projected impact, 
i.e., potential benefits from new equipment, automation, facilities, etc. 
5.2.2.  Ensure the work center supervisor and SMEs understand the work to be measured, SOC, 
and variations existing at the specific measurement sites.  Keep in mind when the process is 
38 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
insufficiently defined, it may be difficult to estimate total process man-hours.  In this case, 
break the process down into more detailed steps and sub-steps. 
5.2.3.  Make a concerted effort and attempt to obtain all workload values for the period 
specified.  Work count procedures should call for a minimum of six months historical data, 
while 12 months of data are preferred.  Data should be collected monthly, and not as an annual 
total, to assist with trend analysis.  Obtain the number and skill level of people assigned to the 
work center for the same period.  In conjunction with the functional OPR, establish data 
collection parameters to ensure complete work cycles are covered for all locations to use in 
measurement efforts. 
5.2.4.  Discuss the work situation with the supervisor to find out whether changes were made 
in methods, product, or type of services during the period covered by the records.  Also, find 
out what effect any changes may have had on the data.  In some cases, the effects of changes 
are not significant; in others, the records and data may no longer be valid and should not be 
used in the measurement.  Use the average historical time based on all representative values. 
5.2.5.  Identify activities directly related to other activities.  For example, if standard B is 
always done as follow-on to standard A, the FREQs should relate. 
5.2.6.  Identify activities indirectly related to other activities.  For example, in a maintenance 
work center, part replaced might relate to part transaction processed in a materiel management 
work center. 
5.2.7.  Determine if the work center has borrowed or loaned manpower, scheduled or 
documented overtime, or has backlog. 
5.3.  Operational Audit Techniques.  OA techniques are generally less accurate than engineered 
techniques, but document requirements for specific activities not appropriate for time study due to 
low frequency or long duration when time study is the primary measurement method. 
5.3.1.  Overview.  OA integrates five primary techniques to obtain PATs and/or FREQs to 
systematically measure work:  good operator timing, directed requirement, standard data, 
historical records, and, as a last resort, technical estimate.  Note:  It is not uncommon for 
analysts to use one technique to determine FREQs and another to determine PATs.  Caution 
do not use personnel generated data sources to determine PATs.  These sources are not reliable 
for manpower purposes because personnel generally only account for an 8-hour work day and 
not the time it takes to accomplish a task one time. 
5.3.2.  Good Operator Timing.  A primary OA measurement technique used to determine PAT 
values through the measurement of the time a qualified individual expends on a given activity 
to a directed specified standard.  Apply the PF&D allowance factor for values obtained with 
the good operator timing technique.  Note:  This technique is not used to determine FREQs. 
5.3.2.1.  Man-hours captured using the good operator technique are considered 
representative of the time that others need to do the same work. 
5.3.2.1.1.  Consult with the work center supervisor to jointly select a qualified person 
who does the process at an average pace. 
5.3.2.1.2.  If possible, measure several qualified individuals doing the same standard.  
Ensure sufficient samples or observations are taken to give accurate estimates of the 
ST.  The number of observations taken should be comparable with the number of man-
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
39 
hours associated with the standard.  The more samples used to determine average time 
increases the accuracy and credibility to the estimate.  The significance of the standard 
man-hours to the total work center expenditure may determine how many sample 
estimates are needed.  Time permitting, where two similar work centers exist at the 
same location in separate organizations, get estimates from both. 
5.3.2.2.  Where the activity is not accomplished frequently, or the PAT is relatively small, 
fewer observations may be appropriate.  However, where the activity is accomplished 
often, or a large amount of the effort of the work center is spent in the standard, more 
observations are justified. 
5.3.2.3.  This technique instills confidence in the data since functional OPRs tend to trust 
the man-hours derived from actual timed observations more than those resulting from less 
objective means.  This method is also useful for verifying suspect PATs collected via 
technical estimate. 
5.3.2.4.  This technique is similar to time study (see Chapter 21) but is not as stringent.  
Work does not need to be broken down into elements, nor does a specific number of 
samples have to be taken to meet statistical confidence and accuracy. 
5.3.3.  Directed Requirement.  A technique used to determine FREQs and/or PATs based on 
DAF-approved guidance (e.g., AFIs, technical orders, etc.). 
5.3.3.1.  Examples of directed FREQs include monthly inspections or periodic 
maintenance of a standby electrical power generator.  If the directed FREQ does not seem 
reasonable, research the mandate for the FREQ. 
5.3.3.2.  An example of a directed PAT is one included in an AFI or a contract Statement 
of Work. 
5.3.4.  Standard Data.  Usually confined to maintenance and logistics functions.  This 
technique uses a collection of standardized processes, step definitions, and associated time 
values to accurately reflect the FREQs and/or PAT for standardized units of work.  One source 
for the creation of standard data is using pre-determined time systems standards.  Another 
source would be data from previous requirements determination measurement.  Use caution 
with these times since they are not considered as valid as current FREQs and PATs. 
5.3.5.  Historical Records.  This technique draws on the work center’s documented past 
performance to obtain historical FREQs and/or PATs.  Research historical records such as 
functional workload, data systems, reports, letters, messages, rosters, etc.  Note:  Historical 
data reflects the mistakes and inefficiencies of past operations, and past performance.  Do not 
use labor hour reporting data derived from timecard systems or other timekeeping documents 
to determine PATs. 
5.3.5.1.  Validate a reporting system by examining several recorded times for the same 
standard and comparing those to measured data, then verify data with work center 
personnel. 
5.3.5.2.  Historical workload data and associated man-hours may not show the work 
center’s true requirements.  FREQs and PATs determined with this technique often need 
to be validated, when possible, using good operator timing or technical estimate due to the 
40 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
lack of a clear understanding of what that time includes (e.g., delays, standby time, worst 
case scenario, etc.). 
5.3.5.3.  Over or under-manning impacts the level of effort and the historical workload 
production level.  Contracted work, backlog, labor negotiations, or future production 
schedules might also be factors.  Identify and document the impact of these conditions 
during measurement. 
5.3.5.4.  Do not to apply the PF&D allowance factor to historical PATs (see Chapter 23).  
An average PAT can be derived from estimates. 
5.3.6.  Weighted PATs.  When the PAT is affected by varying levels of complexity, derive a 
weighted-average PAT based on percent of occurrence.  In this approach, an optimistic, most 
likely, and pessimistic (OMP) time estimate is made. 
5.3.6.1.  The first time estimate, the optimistic time, is the shortest time in which the 
standard can be performed if everything goes very well. 
5.3.6.2.  The second time estimate, the most likely time, is the most realistic time it takes 
to perform the standard.  The most likely time should occur more often than either the 
optimistic or pessimistic time estimate. 
5.3.6.3.  The third time estimate, the pessimistic time, is an estimate of the average time to 
perform the standard under adverse conditions (i.e., when things go wrong). 
5.3.6.3.1.  These three estimates are converted to a weighted PAT by a simple 
approximation formula.  Functional SMEs can provide an estimate of the occurrence 
of each standard (as a percentage, with most likely being the highest percentage). 
5.3.6.3.2.  OMP is not intended to be used on every standard.  Since all calculations are 
based on these estimates, PATs need to be as accurate as possible.  Extreme values will 
need further analysis for validity. 
5.3.7.  Technical Estimate.  This technique should be used as a last resort, when it is not 
practical or cost-effective to use historical records or good operator timing techniques. 
5.3.7.1.  The determination of the FREQ and/or PAT needed for a given process step is 
based on an estimate made by individuals technically and professionally competent to 
judge the FREQ and time needed to accomplish an activity. 
5.3.7.2.  Validate questionable technical estimates.  Evaluate significantly divergent or 
extreme estimate values (outliers).  Determine whether corrections are appropriate or if the 
values should be eliminated entirely. 
5.3.7.3.  Do not to apply the PF&D allowance factor to PATs determined by this technique. 
5.4.  Data Examination.  Each input is analyzed and compared with all other input measurements.  
Forward comments to explain any questionable measurement data, even when verified with the 
work center. 
5.4.1.  Compute total measured manpower and compare to average assigned strength.  If 
measured manpower is greater than average assigned strength, then the delta should be 
supported by borrowed time, overtime, unacceptable backlog, or a reason to explain how the 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
41 
measured work is being accomplished with existing resources.  If measured manpower is less 
than assigned, ensure all valid work center workload has been documented and credited. 
5.4.2.  Document MFM concurrence or reasons for non-concurrence with the measurement 
data.  Ultimately, the quality of the requirements determinant is dependent upon the quality of 
the measurement data submitted. 
5.4.3.  Document measurement results to report measurement data. 
5.5.  Data Reporting.  For requirements determination, man-hours are typically converted to 
monthly man-hours.  Conversion factors for each standard FREQ, and the related symbols are in 
Table 5.1.  An overview of the key internal computations is described in Table 5.2.

5.6.  Operational Audit Calculation.  Total man-hours for a process are determined by the 
mathematical model T = fi ti, where T is the man-hours for one activity, fi is the standard FREQ 
(converted to monthly), and ti is the PAT. 
5.6.1.  PAT (ti) Determination.  Determine required standard man-hours using good operator 
timing, directed PAT, historical records, technical estimates, or standard data.  The PAT is the 
time it takes to perform an activity for one occurrence. 
5.6.2.  ST Determination.  To compute an average PAT, sum all observation times and divide 
by the number of observations.  To determine the actual ST, multiply the average PAT by the 
base PF&D to determine the actual ST.  This is the time recorded for the process measured.  
See Table 5.3 for an example of deriving a ST using good operator timing.  Note:  The ST 
becomes the SAT when it is validated and included in the SWD.

5.6.3.  Standard FREQ (fi) Determination.  Techniques used to establish standard FREQs are 
historical records, directed requirements, standard data, or, as a last resort, technical estimate.  
Make every effort to get accurate FREQs of occurrence.  Generally, the best source of FREQ 
data can be captured using the historical record technique. 
5.6.3.1.  The standard FREQ is the naturally occurring FREQ that a work center performs 
an activity, e.g., once per day, three times per week, eight times per quarter.  Standard 
FREQs are converted to monthly equivalents via conversion factors.  Refer to Table 5.1 
for standard FREQ conversion factors. 
5.6.3.2.  Evaluate work counts and workload cycles associated with specific processes to 
determine the natural FREQ period (e.g., normally occurs on a daily, weekly, monthly, 
quarterly, or yearly basis), as well as the historical FREQ counts. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
43 
5.6.3.3.  In some cases, it is possible to relate unknown FREQs to reliable recorded data to 
find more objective estimates.  For example, if there is no record in a work center to show 
the FREQ with which a particular part is replaced on a piece of equipment, a check of 
supply issue records may verify the FREQ.  Investigate inconsistencies between work 
counts and directly related standard FREQs. 
5.6.3.4.  When applicable, use benchmarks or expected FREQ values provided by the 
functional SME as a guide for evaluating work center estimates.  Reasonable variations in 
values are expected; however, large variations generated by differences in conditions or 
levels of service warrant investigation. 
5.6.3.5.  Use technical estimates for standard FREQ only when no alternative data source 
is available.  If the estimates are suspect (e.g., based on lack of experience or isolated 
situations), evaluate estimates when determining average FREQ.  Attempt to verify the 
estimate by cross-referencing it with other relatable step FREQs.  Do not adjust FREQs 
without justification or coordination from the work center supervisor. 
5.6.3.6.  Base estimates on judgment and experience.  Get a more confident estimate by 
sampling the judgment and experience of several people in the work center.  Where two 
similar work centers exist at the same base in separate organizations, get estimates from 
both. 
5.6.4.  Determining the Weighted PAT.  When appropriate, (see paragraph 5.3.6) an analyst 
may be required to utilize OMP to derive weighted-average PAT.  Table 5.4 provides an 
example of calculating the weighted PAT.  The calculation used is as follows: 
Weighted PAT = (Optimistic % x PAT) + (Most Likely % x PAT) + (Pessimistic % x PAT)

correct number of decimal places. 
5.7.1.  Identify the correct number of decimal places, using Table 5.5 and use simple rounding 
rules.  Note:  Table 5.5 should be used as a reference for rounding rules for all measurement 
and non-measurement techniques discussed in subsequent chapters through this manual.

Chapter 6 
WORKSHOP MEASUREMENT AND FACILITATION 
6.1.  General Concepts.  A workshop is an approach to develop and finalize process flowcharts, 
conduct man-hour measurement of processes and activities required to produce an output, and to 
develop level-of-service options. 
6.1.1.  Benefits of Workshop Measurement.  The major benefit of using workshop 
measurement is it reduces the measurement staffing time.  It also reduces the need for extensive 
data adjustments or corrections because they can be addressed and resolved during the 
workshop. 
6.1.2.  Drawbacks of Workshop Measurement.  The major drawbacks are TDY costs and 
scheduling difficulties.  This may impact the number of people available to attend.  Analysts 
should maintain caution and ensure the participants are representative of the locations to which 
the subsequent determinant applies. 
6.2.  Workshop Procedures.  When deemed necessary, the foundation for an effective workshop 
begins during preliminary research and site visits where key outputs and observation times are 
identified, validated, and recorded. 
6.2.1.  Define Purpose of the Workshop.  Know the purpose or ultimate goal before conducting 
and planning a workshop.  Develop the workshop’s objectives (e.g., how many processes need 
to be measured; do FREQs and/or PATs need to be collected?). 
6.2.2.  Determine Location of the Workshop.  When selecting the workshop location, consider 
cost, availability of facilities, and the participants’ locations.  Consider scheduling the 
workshop at a centralized location to reduce overall travel costs. 
6.2.3.  Determine Who Should Attend.  Consider the purpose, scope, and objectives when 
deciding who should attend the workshop.  The SS selects SMEs based on experience and 
knowledge.  It is imperative the right people are selected to ensure that MAJCOM 
representation regarding the requirements determinant; selectees should reflect the different 
levels of work to be covered by the determinant and have recent hands-on experience in the 
work center.  Senior managers and supervisors have previous experience, but the personnel 
currently performing the work are better able to identify ways to improve processes and to 
provide accurate technical estimates on the time and resources required to accomplish required 
activities.  Identifying criteria for attendee selection reduces the risk of nonqualified 
participants attending based simply on availability.  Balance complete representation while 
trying to minimize the number of participants. 
6.2.4.  Schedule the Workshop.  Estimate how much time it should take to meet the objectives.  
Prepare a plan or schedule of those processes to flowchart and measure. 
6.2.5.  Prepare and Distribute Pre-workshop Information Package.  Send an information 
package to each attendee.  Include base and local area information, a workshop agenda, travel 
instructions (if appropriate), and any other information that will contribute to the success of 
the workshop.  Identify information and/or data the participants are expected to bring to the 
workshop and provide information that can be read before the event, thus saving workshop 
46 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
time.  If possible and appropriate, collect inputs from participants prior to the workshop on 
information to be addressed by the group. 
6.2.6.  Conduct the Workshop.  There are many ways to conduct a measurement workshop.  
Refer to Chapter 26 for additional information about facilitation.

Part 4 
NON-MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES 
Certain work centers do not require work measurement to develop all or part of a determinant.  In 
these work centers, the objective of determining the manpower requirement determinant can be 
met at less cost with acceptable validity by using functional models, post/position manpower 
situations, staffing pattern (including directed organizational positions), and IAF.  Use these 
methods in combination with measured data. 
Chapter 7 
STAFFING PATTERN 
7.1.  General Concepts.  A staffing pattern recognizes long-standing use of manpower and 
standard operating procedures in a work center responsible for subordinate organizational 
elements.  A directed organization position and the associated direct support position is an example 
of a staffing pattern.  The study team decides if a WLF is relevant when using a staffing pattern.  
The size of the organization, in terms of manpower requirements or the number of subordinate 
elements, may drive the size of the work center.  It explains pattern variations between locations 
in terms of workload or conditional factors.  A staffing pattern, used as the basis for a determinant, 
may result in a quantitative expression that is variable in terms of workload or may result in a fixed 
manpower requirement for all applicable locations. 
7.2.  Using a Staffing Pattern.  The staffing pattern is normally used in work centers that 
command or manage two or more subordinate elements.  Use the staffing pattern when the 
following conditions apply: 
7.2.1.  The work center is a specified element of a formal organizational structure. 
7.2.2.  The work center is reasonably stable as shown by consistent use of manpower in terms 
of the number, AFSCs, and grades of personnel over at least a two-year period. 
7.2.3.  Directed organization position specifies a fixed manpower requirement to fill a 
particular named assignment.  This requirement is essential to the existence of a work center 
and does not change regardless of increases or decreases in workload or changes in the MAF.  
The directed organization position requirement is dictated by the need for one to be in a given 
office of responsibility, even though the individual may not be continuously productive.

Chapter 8 
POST/POSITION MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS, STANDBY DETERMINATION, 
AND MAN-HOUR SHIFT PROFILE ANALYSIS 
8.1.  Post/Position Manpower. 
8.1.1.  General Concepts.  Management decisions often produce manpower levels that drive 
standby time.  Since all standby time is nonproductive and costly, it needs to be justified.  
Mission-essential standby time is allowed in manpower studies; however, to merely show the 
computations used to derive standby time is not enough.  Validate management decisions 
leading to post/position manpower requirements and associated standby time. 
8.1.1.1.  Figure 8.1  is a diagram depicting post/position manpower requirements at low 
(case 1) and high (case 2) workload volumes.  In both cases, the post/position manpower 
requirements are considered constant and are represented by circles of the same size.  In 
case 1, the post/position manpower requirement is equal to the total man-hours available 
to do work, that is, the universe is equal to man-hours required by manpower requirements.  
Standby is the difference between man-hours required by post/position manpower and 
man-hours required by productive work. 
Figure 8.1.  Post/Position Manpower Requirements at Low and High Workload Volumes. 
 
8.1.1.1.1.  In case 2, on Figure 8.1, the post/position manpower requirement is less 
than total man-hours available for productive work.  That is, the universe is equal to 
total hours available to do productive work.  Derivation of standby in this case is more 
difficult. 
8.1.1.1.2.  Figure 8.2  is a scattergram that shows a similar situation.  Note that bases 
A and B, whose workload volume is less than Xi, represent a case 1 situation.  Bases C, 
D, and E whose workload volume is greater than Xi, represent case 2.  For case 1 (bases 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
49 
A and B), derive standby time.  At bases C, D, and E, however, this procedure cannot 
be applied. 
Figure 8.2.  Workload Volume and Standby when Post/Position Manpower is Constant. 
 
8.1.1.1.3.  Post/position manpower requirements may be constant for each shift 
(Figures 8.1 and 8.2, show this condition), or may vary with workload volume.  Figure 
8.3 shows post/position manpower at two levels:  one for workload volumes less than 
Xi, and one for workload volumes greater than Xi.  This situation is possible, for 
example, in an aircraft loading operation where a second load crew is needed to meet 
specified turnaround or ground time.  Note:  in Figure 8.3 bases A and C show varying 
amounts of standby time.  The standby time is derived and computed as part of the 
allowed man-hours.  It is not dependent on the regression line. 
50 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
Figure 8.3.  Workload Volume and Standby when Post/Position Manpower is Variable. 
 
8.1.1.2.  When the equation excludes standby time, a particular location may not have 
enough man-hours to cover the directed standby requirement.  This location would receive 
credit for either the computed man-hours or measured man-hours (work center man-hours 
plus standby), whichever is greater.  This standby time is referred to as derived standby.  
Document this condition in the application instructions in the requirements determinant. 
8.1.2.  Observations Regarding Standby Time. 
8.1.2.1.  Post/position manpower requirements may be the same at all locations or may 
change with workload volume. 
8.1.2.2.  Allow only standby necessary for mission accomplishment. 
8.1.2.3.  Reduce standby time by transferring productive work to replace measured standby 
man-hours. 
8.1.2.4.  Classify standby work inherent in one’s assigned duty (for example, a craftsman 
continuously observing instruments) as productive work. 
8.1.3.  Rationale for Post/Position Manpower.  Numerous factors contribute to establishing 
these requirements.  Some of these factors, often a result of management decisions, are: 
8.1.3.1.  Mission needs. 
8.1.3.2.  Performance standards. 
8.1.3.3.  Machine design. 
8.1.3.4.  Facility limitations. 
8.1.3.5.  Hours of operation. 
8.1.3.6.  Shift size and necessity. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
51 
8.1.3.7.  Crew size. 
8.1.3.8.  Post-manpower requirements. 
8.1.3.9.  Safety. 
8.1.3.10.  Security. 
8.1.4.  Evaluating Post/Position Manpower Requirements.  Carefully check the need, question 
the basic need, and offer alternatives and clearly define the cost of such service.  Study 
documentation contains rationale to justify these requirements.  After the functional OPR 
confirms the management decision that results in post/position manpower requirements, 
quantifying standby time is generally straightforward.  Reduce or minimize standby time 
through improved shift scheduling, reorganization, planning, and workload control techniques.  
Be ready to show the functional OPR how to meet the needed performance standards to reduce 
standby time.  When standby time is minimized, the total manpower requirement is also 
minimized. 
8.1.5.  Requirements Position Formula (RPF) Computations.  These are used to determine 
post/position manpower. 
8.1.5.1.  In situations which meet the criteria described in paragraph 8.1.3, use the RPF 
in model development.  RPF method requires direct hours for each measurable variable in 
the equation to compute manpower requirements for an OPR-approved post/position.  
Compute the fractional manpower by dividing the man-hours for coverage by the 
applicable MAF, minus additional NAT not included in the MAF.  NAT is lost man-hours 
due to decertification, disqualification, and/or suspension.  Two programs that can 
decertify, disqualify, or suspend personnel from performing primary duties are Personnel 
Reliability Program (PRP) and Arming and Use of Force (AUoF). 
8.1.5.2.  In certain situations, additional man-hours associated with post/position coverage 
are needed.  These situations fall into two categories. 
8.1.5.2.1.  Post/Position Related Time (PRT).  PRT is constant man-hours required to 
be expended for processes accomplished either before and/or after post/position 
coverage ends.  For example, Security Forces personnel are issued weapons and 
ammunition from the armory and guard mount attendance is mandatory before 
assuming the post.  Likewise, at the end of the shift, weapons and ammunition are 
returned to the armory.  The time associated with this work is in addition to the time 
needed for post duty and should be measured as PRT. 
8.1.5.2.2.  Post/Position Qualification Time (PQT).  PQT is a constant man-hour 
requirement directed by higher headquarters policy in addition to duties.  This includes 
recurring training hours that keep individuals qualified to fill the post/position which 
cannot be received while the individual performs their duties.  An example of PQT is 
proficiency or refresher training needed by all Security Forces, such as weapons 
training.  This is another example of NAT which must be subtracted from the MAF. 
8.1.5.2.3.  When additional allowances are given for these two types of post/position 
related manpower, derive the man-hours used in computing the allowances from work 
measurement.  To compute required manpower, divide the coverage in man-hours by 
the MAF minus the NAT.  Note:  Standby time is normally an inherent part of 
52 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
post/position based on application, such as Security Forces assigned to a base access 
gate and firefighters. 
8.1.5.3.  Use the following RPF to compute fractional manpower.  Use continuous 
calculations, i.e., round after all calculations are done. 
 
8.1.5.4.  In this equation, Dw represents the number of days per week the post/position 
operates, Hd represents the number of hours per day the post/position operates, PRT 
represents the number of constant man-hours required to perform tasks before and after 
one shift, Sd represents the number of shifts per day the post/position operates, Wm 
represents the number of weeks per month (conversion factor) the post/position operates, 
and C represents the size of the crew that is needed to man the post/position.  Crew size is 
normally one, unless safety, security, mission, or regulatory guidance provides additional 
information.  MAF represents the man-hour availability factor.  Potential NAT to be 
subtracted from the MAF includes PQT, and PRP or AUoF.  PQT represents the number 
of defined man-hours per month per person dedicated to post/position qualification time.  
PRP represents the number of measured man-hours per month per person associated with 
Personnel Reliability Program (use only with PRP units).  AUoF represents the number of 
measured man-hours per month per person associated with arming and use of force (use 
only with Security Forces).  PRP and AUoF are never used together in one equation.  Table 
8.1 provides RPF variables and their descriptions. 
 
Table 8.1.  RPF Variables and Description.

8.1.5.5.  The following example calculates the fractional manpower for two hypothetical 
Security Forces posts at one location. 
8.1.5.5.1.  The first post is within the non-nuclear enterprise and operates 7 days a 
week, 24 hours a day, with 3 shifts per day.  Each shift requires a 2-person crew.  PRT 
was measured at 40 minutes per shift.  PQT for this post is directed at 18 hours a month 
and AUoF is 7.30 hours per month for the non-nuclear enterprise.  Post #1 fractional 
requirements are 12.886 (see below for calculation). 
 
8.1.5.5.2.  The second post is within the non-nuclear enterprise and operates 5 days a 
week excluding holidays, 24 hours a day, with 3 shifts per day.  Each shift requires a 
2-person crew.  It is also open one weekend a month, 16 hours on Saturday (2 shifts) 
and one 8-hour shift on Sunday.  Each shift requires a 2-person crew.  PRT was 
measured at 40 minutes per shift.  PQT for this post is directed at 18 hours a month and 
AUoF is 7.30 hours per month for the non-nuclear enterprise.  Calculate the RPF for 
each shift.  RPF for the post is calculated by adding together each shift RPF.  Post #2 
fractional requirements equal 9.238 (see below for calculations). 
 
 
 
 
54 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
 
8.1.5.5.3.  Add the fractional manpower for both posts to determine the fractional 
manpower requirement of 22.124. 
8.1.5.6.  When determining fractional manning for multiple posts of the same make-up in 
hours of operation, crew size, PQT, etc., use the RPF to determine fractional manpower for 
a single post and multiply the result by the number of posts authorized for the function 
under study. 
8.1.5.7.  If RPF is the sole measurement method, add all fractional requirements together 
and round once for like functions.  For example, add all Security Forces post requirements 
before rounding. 
8.1.5.8.  IAF is not added to RPF since it is assumed that this work will be accomplished 
during standby time. 
8.1.5.9.  Document post/position manpower as follows: 
8.1.5.9.1.  When the post/position manpower computation is not the sole measurement 
method for the work center, compute the man-hours by multiplying the fractional 
manpower requirement by the applicable MAF. 
8.1.5.9.2.  When the post/position manpower computation is the sole measurement 
method for the work center, furnish only the RPF computation.  There is no need to 
convert the rounded fractional manpower into man-hours. 
8.2.  Study Design. 
8.2.1.  A well-designed study accurately shows post/position manpower requirements and true 
standby time.  Necessary standby man-hours cannot be identified during development, as they 
are grouped in with other nonproductive categories of time and when the post/position 
manpower requirements have not been accurately documented. 
8.2.2.  Clearly define the method for measuring standby when the possibility of standby time 
exists.  Use standard data collection and work measurement procedures to identify standby; 
however, some innovation is needed with these methods.  Do not simply state that queueing or 
shift profile analysis is used to quantify standby time; explain how inputs are utilized in these 
techniques.  Standby time is discussed in conjunction with various data collection and analysis 
procedures in the paragraphs that follow. 
8.2.3.  Include standby time computed according to the procedures outlined in this section as 
input to regression analysis when developing the determinant man-hour equation.  Build a 
variance for applicable locations if standby time does not exist at all locations. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
55 
8.3.  Data Collection and Analysis Procedures. 
8.3.1.  Queueing Analysis.  Queueing data does not directly identify allowed standby time.  
The percentage of server time in productive direct work may be determined with the queueing 
utilization factor after an acceptable level of service has been determined (e.g., the number of 
taxi drivers needed to give a four-minute response time).  Queueing also shows when servers 
are not busy, including standby time.  Design the study to collect queueing data on standby 
time if queueing is used.  Details describing queueing techniques are in Chapter 25. 
8.3.2.  Work Sampling. 
8.3.2.1.  Identify standby time during WS observation rounds when post/position 
manpower requirements are previously defined.  For example, suppose an office requires 
customers with inquiries be assisted within 30 min of customer arrival.  It was 
predetermined that two technicians are necessary to give this level of service at the counter 
between 0900 and 1500. 
8.3.2.2.  Make provisions to isolate and identify the required standby time when the work 
sampler knows this information before the study begins.  On each observation round, the 
work sampler records each worker in the respective process.  The observer may enter a 
maximum of two standby tallies during each observation round, but this would occur only 
if both technicians were awaiting customers. 
8.3.2.3.  Use standby time derived in this manner to show management the manpower cost 
of providing this level of service.  Analysis of WS observation sheets and waiting time data 
(e.g., the time finance customers wait for service) may reveal the specified level of service 
has been exceeded or a second worker is needed only during peak periods, such as pay 
days. 
8.3.2.4.  Standby time collected in this manner represents adjusted or derived standby time 
required to support a predetermined level of service.  However, if the level of service is not 
clearly defined, it is impossible to identify whether the worker should be sampled as idle 
or standby.  Build a man-hour shift profile chart to find required standby when this is the 
case. 
8.3.2.5.  Show the standby time derived through this procedure on the WS record.  Do not 
level or apply allowances to this time.  Use standby time to reduce personal and rest 
allowances for other productive process man-hours.  WS techniques are described in 
Chapter 24. 
8.3.3.  Operational Audit. 
8.3.3.1.  Include enough rationale in the report to support the post/position manpower 
requirement when using OA as the primary work measurement method.  It is not necessary 
to measure standby time if the post/position manpower requirement represents the total 
man-hour universe (see case 1, Figure 8.1.). 
8.3.3.2.  Minimize and fully explain all standby allowed in the study when the total man-
hour universe is greater than the post/position manpower requirement (see case 2, Figure 
8.1.).  Developing a man-hour shift profile chart from OA measurement may be difficult 
because process times are not associated with each hour of the duty day.  Therefore, 
56 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
consider using short-cycle WS to collect man-hours for a man-hour shift profile chart.  Use 
the WS as back-up for the OA man-hours. 
8.4.  Man-hour Shift Profile Analysis. 
8.4.1.  Overview. 
8.4.1.1.  Use a man-hour shift profile chart to aid in analyzing standby time when WS or 
queueing is used, and standby time exists. 
8.4.1.2.  Man-hour shift profile charts are an effective way to identify and minimize 
standby time.  The charts aid the analyst in defining the minimum essential manpower 
levels by: 
8.4.1.2.1.  Leveling workloads to economize on nonproductive standby periods. 
8.4.1.2.2.  Identifying minimum standby time based on the accepted level of service. 
8.4.2.  Use of the Man-hour Shift Profile Chart. 
8.4.2.1.  The man-hour shift profile chart helps functional managers realize economies of 
operation and helps analysts build accurate requirements determinants.  Use this process 
as a data analysis technique during management consultant studies or with other data 
collection methods during a requirements determinants study. 
8.4.2.2.  The man-hour shift profile is used to justify standby requirements.  Analysts use 
the chart to find the proper amounts of standby time to include in measurement reports 
when either: 
8.4.2.2.1.  Queueing analysis is the primary determinant development technique. 
8.4.2.2.2.  WS is the primary work measurement method and standby time cannot be 
distinguished from other nonproductive categories during the sampling period. 
8.4.3.  Development of the Present Man-hour Shift Profile Chart. 
8.4.3.1.  Only construct the profile chart from data obtained during work measurement if 
certain provisions are taken during data collection.  That is, collect data so it can be 
summarized by process on a stratified time basis (normally, hour-by-hour). 
8.4.3.2.  Identify work as transferable and nontransferable when a man-hour shift profile 
chart is needed.  This helps in making the shift profile chart show productive work for the 
stratified time increments. 
8.4.3.3.  The basic steps in developing man-hour shift profile charts are:  collecting 
necessary data, doing end-of-study computations, and constructing the chart.  Derive the 
average man-hours for each hour of the day that are used in the profile chart from queueing 
analysis or from WS data.  When using the shift profile chart to minimize standby time, 
make sure the sample size is large enough to support recommendations based on the profile 
chart.  The procedures for developing a shift profile chart using WS data follow: 
8.4.3.3.1.  Accumulate the transferable and nontransferable time on a daily basis for 
each hour or half-hour of each shift.  Average this time for the study period.  Extract 
this time from the measurement data.  On some occasions, a separate WS study may be 
needed to develop the profile chart.  When this is so, take enough samples to reach 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
57 
desired accuracy and collect only the productive time.  Classify the productive work 
into transferable or nontransferable work.  Consult work center personnel to make this 
classification if the SWD has not been marked. 
8.4.3.3.2.  Construct the present man-hour shift profile (see Figure 8.4.). 
Figure 8.4.  Man-hour Shift Profile, Present. 
 
8.4.3.3.2.1.  Identify average man-hours per hour on the vertical axis. 
8.4.3.3.2.2.  Identify each stratified period for each shift (hour or half hour) on the 
horizontal axis. 
8.4.3.3.2.3.  Extend a vertical line downward from the duty hour corresponding to 
each shift change and state the post/position manpower requirement for that shift. 
8.4.3.3.2.4.  Plot, from bottom to top, the average nontransferable and transferable 
man-hours computed for each stratified period. 
8.4.3.3.2.5.  Identify the nontransferable and transferable time within each stratified 
period.  Note:  Color-coding is helpful in this identification. 
8.4.3.3.2.6.  Group the various periods that make up each existing shift.  Find the 
58 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
largest requirement within each shift and extend a dark horizontal line over the 
entire shift. 
8.4.3.3.2.7.  Extend vertical lines from each stratified period up to the next whole 
hour above the plots for transferable time.  When there is only nontransferable time 
within the strata, extend the vertical line from that plot to the next whole hour.  The 
extended portion of the column is potential standby time.  In most cases, the total 
man-hours per shift period include both potential standby time and other 
nonproductive time. 
8.4.3.3.2.8.  Prepare a legend for the chart identifying nontransferable, transferable, 
standby time, and other nonproductive time. 
8.4.4.  Analysis of the Man-hour Shift Profile Chart.  Shift profile analysis can point out 
deficiencies in scheduling practices, or it can point out excessive manpower levels.  Further 
study of the actual shift profile chart may lead to additional benefits such as more efficient 
choices for shift hours. 
8.4.4.1.  Analyze the actual shift profile chart to find the proper adjustments to make to 
standby time before constructing the proposed shift profile chart.  An analysis of the chart 
may show the need for overlapping or split shifts.  Although split shifts are sometimes 
necessary, split shifts should be kept to a minimum.  During analysis, remember: 
8.4.4.1.1.  An evenly spread workload often reduces manpower needs. 
8.4.4.1.2.  A related work center with standby man-hours may be able to accept some 
transferable work.  This can take place only if the work can be done by the individuals 
receiving the work. 
8.4.4.1.3.  Adjustments to existing standby time should be coordinated with local 
OPRs.  Adjustments are not to add man-hours that exceed the stated level of service. 
8.4.4.2.  A large amount of standby time at one location may mean a variance is needed for 
that location.  On the other hand, it may mean that the analyst did not properly adjust the 
standby time.  Do not average or prorate standby time during data analysis. 
8.4.4.3.  Figure 8.5  shows a properly constructed man-hour shift profile chart that 
identifies recommended time movements.

8.4.5.  Development of the Proposed Man-hour Shift Profile Chart.  Construct a proposed shift 
profile chart when an improvement can be made to the actual shift profile.  Construct this chart 
the same way as the present profile chart but do it in conjunction with the analysis step.  The 
proposed chart often uncovers faults with analysis of the present profile chart.  Follow the 
below steps: 
8.4.5.1.  Step 1.  For purposes of this example, assume the pre-stated post/position 
manpower required for the A and B shift is two and the post/position manpower required 
for the C shift is one.  The proposed chart accommodates this manpower requirement. 
8.4.5.2.  Step 2.  Examine the present man-hour shift profile.  In Figure 8.4, examination 
shows large standby and nonproductive time within shifts A and B.  This is a logical place 
to look for improvements. 
8.4.5.3.  Step 3.  Experiment with different arrangements by moving transferable man-
hours into periods with large amounts of standby.  Move the transferable time to nearby 
60 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
hours within the same shift if possible.  The objective is to reduce the nonproductive time 
that results when each column on the chart is extended up to the total man-hours required 
per shift line. 
8.4.5.4.  Step 4.  Experiment with different shift hours or with overlapping shifts to reduce 
nonproductive time.  Consider this possibility when a large man-hour required per shift 
column exists near a proposed shift change period.  Figure 8.6 shows where transferable 
man-hours were moved within the same shift.  Figure 8.7 shows how overlapping shifts 
were used to reduce man-hours required per shift. 
8.4.5.5.  Step 5.  Compute the derived standby time from the proposed chart.

8.4.6.2.  If post/position manpower requirements have been satisfied for all shifts. 
8.4.6.3.  The extent of shift man-hour savings on the proposed chart. 
8.4.6.4.  A comparison of man-hour savings for the present and proposed charts is 
summarized in Table 8.2.  This comparison shows a man-hour savings of 16 hours per day 
or 487.04 man-hours per month (16 x 30.44 = 487.04).

FUNCTIONAL MODEL 
9.1.  General Concepts. 
9.1.1.  The functional model is a mathematical equation that relates the current distribution of 
manpower to a specific workload.  The relationship may not provide accurate requirements 
since the current distribution of manpower may not be correct. 
9.1.2.  The functional model is a method used to develop equations and analyze potential 
workload factors. 
9.2.  Standards Development. 
9.2.1.  Before model construction, analyze and adjust authorized and assigned data to reflect 
approved initiatives. 
9.2.2.  The following steps are used for constructing a model and incorporating initiatives. 
9.2.2.1.  Step 1.  Develop model equation using assigned or authorized man-hours as the 
dependent variable (Y).  The decision to use authorized or assigned is made in consultation 
with the OPR.  Regress this variable against six to twelve months of average workload.  
Refer to Table 9.1.  Note:  For bases/work centers having seven or fewer 
authorizations/assigned, to convert manpower to man-hours, the analyst will use the current 
MAF times 1.070 to avoid under-manning small work centers.  For bases/work centers of 
eight or more then the analyst will just use the current MAF.  Current MAFs can be found 
on the AFMAA SharePoint.

AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
9.2.2.2.  Step 2.  Equation Selection.  Because the difference between authorized and 
assigned strength represents less than 10 percent of the total authorized, the authorized 
man-hour equation was selected as the functional model because of the better statistics. 
9.2.2.3.  Step 3.  Establish Baseline.  Use selected equation to determine calculated man-
hours.  These calculated man-hours will be used as the baseline for the functional model.

9.2.2.6.  Note:  This same procedure can be used when adjusting a single location 
requirements determinant developed using regression analysis and historical data.  In this 
instance, data from the different months would be adjusted rather than the different bases. 
9.2.3.  Functional Model Selection. 
9.2.3.1.  Correlate the dependent variable with the independent workload variables. 
9.2.3.2.  In situations where authorized and assigned man-hours are closely compatible, 
use the analysis of variation and correlation criteria to select the best dependent variable 
(Y).  When these statistical criteria are used, assigned strengths should not differ from 
authorized strengths by more than 10 percent when input points are totaled. 
9.2.3.3.  Make sure the minimum number of input locations is satisfied when developing 
the functional model. 
9.2.3.4.  Use the selected equation to calculate required man-hours.  Make sure a 
representative period of workload data is used to apply the equation.  This sets up the man-
hour data base for the first equation.  After setting up the data base, subtract the man-hours 
saved due to initiatives.  Regress adjusted man-hours against workload (same x-values) to 
develop the final man-hour equation. 
9.3.  Using a Functional Model to Analyze Potential Workload Factors. 
9.3.1.  During preliminary research, use the functional model to analyze potential WLFs.  The 
size of the standard error and the number of extreme deviations from the line often show the 
degree of relatability.  Other means of evaluation such as activity analysis charts, discussions 
with the functional OPR, and logical analysis help refine the list of potential WLFs. 
9.3.2.  The following steps identify the procedures which should be followed when using a 
functional model to analyze potential WLFs: 
9.3.2.1.  Step 1.  Pick the work center or functional area to be analyzed. 
66 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
9.3.2.2.  Step 2.  Select candidate workload and program variables that logically relate to 
UMD manpower authorizations and for data available from programming documents or 
formal reports. 
9.3.2.3.  Step 3.  Get the UMD manpower data for each location and time period under 
consideration.  Use the volume of the selected variables for the same time periods. 
9.3.2.4.  Step 4.  Analyze data.  See Chapter 11 for analysis tools used to review and 
correct data submissions. 
9.3.2.4.1.  Check manpower and workload data with the functional OPR and revise any 
data that both parties agree is incorrect. 
9.3.2.4.2.  Plot the data pairs on a scatter diagram and analyze the relative position of 
each plot with respect to a trend or pattern of the overall display. 
9.3.2.4.3.  Do regression analysis to find the relationship between manpower 
authorizations and the candidate workload variables. 
9.3.2.4.4.  Investigate any extreme deviation in the data points.  The purpose of this 
investigation is to find whether a high standard error (deviation) is due to management 
design or well-documented reasons.  If so, include those reasons as part of the 
functional model backup data.  Typical reasons are:  mixed data from different 
organizational levels, incorrectly defined FACs and organizational structure codes, 
geographic population differences, use of contract services at some locations, 
differences in management philosophy and personnel utilization, organizational 
structure differences, and lack of a quantitative relationship between manpower and the 
tested workload variables.  The investigation should give some clues to the expected 
benefit of alternative study approaches.  A full study of the functions at selected 
locations may be needed to identify the reasons for large deviations.  Separate standards 
may be needed to show multiple populations that are shown by the scattergram. 
9.3.2.5.  Step 5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 to evaluate alternative workload variables.  
Additional models using assigned strength instead of authorizations may give more insight 
into manpower requirements, variations by location or condition, and potential WLFs.  For 
example, analysis of assigned strength and the historical workload relate to a productivity 
index and show the work done by expended manpower.  Given consistent workload and 
efficient operations, expended resources should relate to future requirements.  Models are 
also valuable for analyzing the potential differences that may need different populations 
for standard coverage. 
9.3.3.  An example of a functional model is depicted in Figure 9.1.  Note that the equation and 
all data points are plotted for ease of analysis.  The functional model shows the relationship 
between manpower and the tested workload variable.  Although it does not require discarding 
the potential WLF, the model shows the absence of a strong relationship.

Chapter 10 
FUNCTIONAL ESTIMATING EQUATIONS 
10.1.  General Concepts.  Functional Estimating Equations (FEE) are the Air Force manpower 
tools built specifically for use in SPPBE process.  These equations are quantitative tools designed 
to be used at all organizational levels to forecast manpower requirements.  FEEs are optional and 
are used to supplement other forecasting methods.  These equations are used to predict future years 
manpower requirement forecasts for Air Force functional areas. 
10.2.  Building a Functional Estimating Equation. 
10.2.1.  Each FEE is made up of two major parts: 
10.2.1.1.  A mathematical equation that shows the relationship between a function’s total 
manpower requirements and a selected program estimating factor (PEF). 
10.2.1.2.  Percentage factors that break a function’s total manpower requirements into 
various Program Element Codes (PEC), Functional Account Codes (FAC), and manpower 
categories at MAJCOM, base, and work center levels. 
10.2.2.  At least one FEE is built for each functional area.  Functional areas are defined by the 
first, second, third, and fourth digit of a FAC (e.g., the 5-series defines the medical functional 
area while the 42-series defines the logistics readiness functions).  However, if manpower 
resources need to be programmed in the SPPBE at a lower functional level (e.g., 42M100, 
Materiel Management), then FEEs are built at these levels. 
10.2.3.  The mathematical equation of a FEE is normally built using regression analysis.  This 
analysis uses the function's total required manpower and actual historical values for selected 
PEFs from each appropriate location (e.g., standard host wings). 
10.2.3.1.  All mathematical equations must be linear (i.e., bivariate or multivariate). 
10.2.3.2.  The function's required manpower total at each location is obtained by applying 
all requirements determinants that cover work centers in the function (the manpower values 
used are converted from man-hours to FTEs). 
10.2.3.2.1.  The workload factor values used in these applications are the result of 
analysis done on three years of historical data. 
10.2.3.2.2.  Included in the function’s total manpower requirements are any CME that 
are appropriate.  These numbers are tracked separately and will eventually be identified 
as a CME percentage factor. 
10.2.3.3.  PEFs are used in FEEs like WLFs are used in requirements determinants. 
10.2.3.3.1.  PEFs are identified as the following:  base populations (military (includes 
sister services), civilian, and dependent), flying hours, number of aircraft, number of 
missiles, number of vehicles, and average daily student load. 
10.2.3.3.2.  PEF values used in building a FEE represent average values obtained from 
analysis of the PEF historical data for each location.  This historical data is taken from 
the same time as the workload data used to apply the requirements determinants. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
69 
10.2.3.4.  Specific instructions for building the mathematical equation of a FEE by using 
regression analysis are provided in Table 10.1.  An example is shown in Figure 10.1. 
Table 10.1.  Construction of a Functional Estimating Equation.

Action 
Example 
1 Identify all work centers within a functional 
area. 
Within functional area 81XXXX there are 
four work centers:  81A100, 81B100, 
81C100, and 81D100. 
2 Identify all locations in the MAJCOM which 
have work centers from this functional area. 
There are 20 locations in command ABC 
that have this functional area. 
3 
Identify which of the locations identified in 
step 2 can be grouped together to build a 
FEE.  However, if circumstances dictate more 
than one grouping of bases (e.g., locations 
where the MAJCOM is host versus locations 
where the MAJCOM is a tenant) build a FEE 
for each grouping.  Each location can be in 
only one grouping. 
Assume all 20 locations in command ABC 
can be treated as one group.  This will 
result in the building of only one FEE. 
4 Select the PEFs to be tested for each of the 
groupings of locations identified in step 3. 
Base population will be tested for this 
function. 
5 
At each MAJCOM location, obtain the 
manpower requirements for each work center 
in the function by applying its requirement 
determinant. 
At base 1, the following requirements 
were obtained: 
WORK CENTER 
REQUIREMENTS 
A               22 
B               15 
C               10 
D               18 
6 At each location, sum the results of step 5 to 
get the total functional requirements. 
Base 1 total functional requirements =  
22 + 15 + 10 + 18 = 65. 
7 
At each location, determine a monthly PEF 
value from analysis of actual values 
experienced during the same time period as 
the workload data used to apply the standards. 
For base 1, the monthly base population 
value is 2528. 
8 Fit the regression line to the data. 
See Figure 10.1. 
70 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
Figure 10.1.  Example of Data Used to Build a FEE. 
 
10.2.3.5.  There are no classification categories for a FEE.  However, a FEE built using 
regression analysis must satisfy the statistical criteria of at least a R2 of 0.5.  If it does not, 
then the equation, Y = bX can be used.  Where Y is the manpower requirements for a 
functional area; b is requirements determinant application requirements divided by 
historical monthly PEF value; and X is the programmed PEF value. 
10.2.3.6.  When an equation applies to four or fewer locations in a MAJCOM, build the 
mathematical equation for the FEE using single location and small population instructions 
for requirements determination development (see Chapter 16). 
10.2.4.  The factors of a FEE are built using information obtained from application of the 
requirements determinants, UMD data, and values resulting from the development of the FEE's 
mathematical equation. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
71 
10.2.4.1.  The first factor computed is a FEE adjustment factor for each location in the 
command.  This value identifies how much each location's manpower requirement total, 
obtained from application of the function's requirements determinant, is different from the 
manpower requirement total obtained from application of the FEE.  The PEF data used to 
build the FEE is used to apply the FEE to get this factor. 
10.2.4.1.1.  This factor is rounded to three decimal places. 
10.2.4.1.2.  An example showing how this factor is computed is in Table 10.2.

10.2.4.2.  The remaining FEE percentage factors show what percentage of the total 
functional area requirements are in different PECs and FACs, and within each, the various 
manpower categories.  Different factors are determined for work center, base, and 
MAJCOM levels.  There are three kinds of percentage factors required for each location in 
a MAJCOM. 
10.2.4.2.1.  The first are percentages of the total manpower requirements represented 
by each PEC and FAC.  Percentages are needed for the overall function as well as for 
each work center in the function.  Instructions for building these percentages are 
provided in Table 10.3 with an example shown in Table 10.4.

2 
Identify all locations in the MAJCOM which 
have work centers in this functional area. 
There are twenty locations in command ABC that have this 
functional area.

At each MAJCOM location, obtain the 
manpower requirements for each work center 
in the function by applying the requirements 
determinants. 
At base 1, the following requirements were obtained:

At each location, sum the results of step 3 to 
get the total functional requirements. 
Base 1 total functional requirements = 
22 + 15 + 10 + 18 = 65. 
5 
To get the work center percentage factors for 
each location in the MAJCOM, divide each 
work center requirement total found in step 3 
by the total found in step 4.  Keep the 
percentages rounded to three decimal places.

(USDH) civilians, Foreign National direct hire (FNDH) civilians, Foreign National 
indirect hire (FNIH) civilians, and CMEs within each PEC and FAC at the overall 
functional level.  For each PEC in each work center, percentages are developed for 
military (officers and airmen combined), USDH civilians, FNDH civilians, FNIH 
civilians, and CMEs.  Instructions for building these percentages are provided in Table 
10.6 and an example is shown in Table 10.7. 
10.2.4.2.4.  The first and third kinds of factors are also required at the MAJCOM level 
(see paragraph 10.2.4.2.1 and paragraph 10.2.4.2.3.).  Percentages of the function's 
total MAJCOM manpower requirements are developed for each PEC and FAC.  Within 
each PEC and FAC, MAJCOM percentages are developed for officers, airmen, USDH 
civilians, FNDH civilians, FNIH civilians, and CMEs.  Instructions for building these

fiscal year. 
10.3.3.  How a FEE is applied depends on the level at which the equation is used and whether 
zero-based or incremental requirements are being determined. 
10.3.3.1.  If zero-based requirements are needed for each work center at a specific base, 
follow the instructions in Table 10.8. 
10.3.3.2.  If zero-based requirements are needed for the entire function at a specific base, 
follow the instructions in Table 10.8 with the following modifications: 
10.3.3.2.1.  Delete steps 4 and 7. 
10.3.3.2.2.  Use the results of step 3 in step 5. 
10.3.3.2.3.  Use function (base level) PEC and manpower category percentages. 
10.3.3.3.  If incremental requirements are needed for each work center at a specific base, 
follow the instructions in Table 10.5 with the following modifications: 
10.3.3.3.1.  In step 1, only change in PEF data at the location is obtained. 
10.3.3.3.2.  In step 2, only the b-coefficient of the FEE is applied.  The a-value is not 
used.

1 
Obtain a location's total PEF value for the fourth 
quarter of the appropriate fiscal year. 
For base 11, assume the PEF value is 3004. 
2 
Apply the FEE using the PEF total found in step 
1.  Round to three decimal places. 
For a FEE of Y = 38.820 + 0.006482(X) 
Y = 38.820 + 0.006482 (3004) 
= 38.82 + 19.472 
= 58.292 
3 
Adjust the application result of step 2 by adding 
the location's FEE adjustment factor.  Round to 
a whole manpower number by simple rounding 
rules. 
The base 11 adjustment factor is -5.297. 
The adjusted result = 58.292 + (-5.297) 
= 58.292 - 5.297 
= 52.995 = 53

Multiply the result of step 3 by each of the work 
center percentage factors.  Round to whole 
manpower numbers by using simple rounding 
rule.  Make appropriate adjustments to each 
work center number to ensure the sum of all 
work center manpower values equals the 
functional value in step 3. 
The percentages for each are Work Center A, 0.400, Work 
Center B, 0.205, Work Center C, 0.185, and Work Center D, 
0.210.  Therefore, the work center requirements are: 
Work Center A = (0.400)(53) = 21.200 = 21 
Work Center B = (0.205)(53) = 10.865 = 11 
Work Center C = (0.185)(53) =  9.805  = 10 
Work Center D = (0.210)(53) = 11.130 = 11

simple rounding rule.  Make appropriate 
adjustments to each PEC number to ensure the 
sum of all PEC manpower values equals the 
work center total found in step 4. 
Base 11 only has PEC 27596A in this function.  Therefore, the 
PEC percentage for each work center is 100% and the values 
are the same as those found in step 4.

Multiply each work center PEC value computed 
in step 5 by its applicable manpower category 
percentage factors.  Round to whole manpower 
numbers by using the simple rounding rule.  
Make appropriate adjustments to each 
manpower category number to ensure the sum of 
all manpower category values equal the PEC 
total found in step 5. 
In Work Center C at base 11, the manpower category 
percentages are military, 0.920, and USDH civilians, 0.080. 
Therefore, the manpower totals for Work Center C in PEC 
27596A are: 
Military = (10) (0.920) = 9.20 = 9 
USDH Civilians = (10) (0.080) = 0.80 = 1

Obtain the officer and airmen numbers, grades, 
and skills from the appropriate work center 
manpower table. 
In Work Center C, the manpower table shows one officer for a 
manpower level of 10.  Therefore, there are 8 airmen.  
Appropriate grades and skills are assigned based on the 
manpower table. 
10.3.3.4.  If zero-based requirements are needed for the entire function at MAJCOM level, 
follow the instructions in Table 10.9. 
10.3.3.5.  If incremental requirements are needed for the entire function at MAJCOM level, 
follow the instructions in Table 10.9 with the following modifications.

ANALYSIS TOOLS 
11.1.  Process Flowcharting. 
11.1.1.  General Concepts.  This section discusses basic concepts for building a process 
flowchart to document a process and process improvement initiatives and how to analyze the 
physical layout where processes are performed. 
11.1.2.  Process Flowcharting.  A process is a series of actions or continuous operations leading 
to a particular and desirable result or ending.  In other words, the process produces a product 
or service for a customer.  A diagram used to depict the step-by-step progression through a 
process is a flowchart.  The process flowchart diagram is created by using connecting lines and 
a set of conventional symbols.  Figure 11.1 provides a list of the most commonly used process 
flowchart symbols.  Other symbols may be used but should be applied consistently.  Provide a 
symbol key to identify the shapes used throughout the study. 
Figure 11.1.  Commonly Used Process Flowchart Symbols. 
 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
81 
11.1.3.  Techniques.  There are numerous techniques used to create and document process 
flowcharts.  Two variations are presented in Figure 11.2 and Figure 11.3.  Adding swim lanes 
to a process, (e.g., sales) in Figure 11.3, is an easy way to illustrate demarcation points for 
various offices, work centers, or work elements owning a piece of the process.  Another 
variation is to arrange the process flowchart according to the physical layout of the function.  
The analyst is not limited to these formats when deciding which technique best documents the 
processes under review.  However, regardless of the technique used, ensure the format is 
consistent in final study documents, i.e., do not use swim lanes on some processes and not on 
others. 
Figure 11.2.  Example of a Basic Process Flowchart. 
 
Figure 11.3.  Example of a Process Flowchart Using Swim Lanes. 
 
11.1.4.  Guidelines for Developing Work Center Process Flowcharts.  Since a process 
flowchart shows relationships between different steps and helps to locate or pinpoint problem 
areas, it is important to include key people in the process flowcharting activity, e.g., suppliers, 
customers, workers, and supervisors.  Process flowcharts help the people involved with the 
82 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
process understand and communicate how the process is performed and then aid in process 
improvement efforts. 
11.1.4.1.  Break apart complex processes by creating sub-processes.  Develop the sub-
process process flowchart and use the sub-process title as the description for the activity 
within the higher-level process flowchart.  Consider using a special formatting symbol on 
the primary process flowchart to make identification of sub-processes easier.  However, 
remember to include a symbol key in the documents to identify all shapes used in the 
process flowchart. 
11.1.4.2.  Process flowcharting is partly an art and takes time to create a finished product 
ready for posting.  Thoroughly inspect the chart for discrepancies. 
11.1.4.3.  Verify and validate the process flowchart.  Ensure the technical experts agree 
with the process flow and clearly understand activity descriptions.  Remember, include 
only MAJCOM or higher headquarters directed workload. 
11.1.4.4.  The steps to develop and analyze a process flowchart are described in Table 
11.1. 
Table 11.1.  Steps to Develop and Analyze a Process Flowchart.

Action 
Description 
1 Identify and define the 
process. 
Determine the title of the process.  Where, when, and why does 
the process start and finish?  What stimulus causes the process to 
start?  What product or service is produced as a response?  What is 
the output? 
2 Describe the current 
process. 
Determine the level of detail to be included on the chart.  From the 
starting point, chart the entire process.  Work slowly and include 
every step along the way, right through to the finish.  If need be, 
brainstorm the activities that happen within the process without 
concern of the sequence, then place them in order later.  When the 
analyst and/or SMEs agree the process is complete, connect the 
activities using the arrow connectors. 
3 Chart the ideal 
process.  (optional) 
Try to identify the easiest and most efficient way to go from the 
"start" to the "finish."  This makes it easier to find improvements. 
4 
Search for 
improvement 
opportunities. 
Study the process flowchart.  Find areas that hinder the process or 
add little to no value.  If an ideal process was charted, compare 
and question any differences. 
5 Update the chart with 
the improved process. 
Build a new process flowchart that corrects the problems that were 
identified. 
11.1.4.5.  Some questions to address during process analysis: 
11.1.4.5.1.  What is produced by the process?  Why is it needed?  What Air Force 
requirement is satisfied as a result? 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
83 
11.1.4.5.2.  What is actually done?  Are all steps included?  Can the process or some 
steps be eliminated, combined, optimized, or automated? 
11.1.4.5.3.  Where should the process or steps be done?  Are environmental conditions 
conducive to accomplishment of the process? 
11.1.4.5.4.  Are processes and/or steps in the right sequence?  Can some be combined 
or simplified by moving them ahead or back? 
11.1.4.5.5.  Are the right people doing the work?  Do the people have the right skills?  
Is the work being done at the most effective and efficient organizational level? 
11.1.4.5.6.  How are the process or steps being done?  Can the process or steps be 
performed more efficiently or effectively with different equipment or work area layout? 
11.1.4.5.7.  Have proper administrative controls been set up?  How often is work 
checked for accuracy?  What inspections can be merged with operations? 
11.1.4.5.8.  Are conditional factors built for rework or errors and does management 
know what the error rate is? 
11.1.4.5.9.  At what stage in the process do most of the errors occur? 
11.1.4.5.10.  When would an error be caught if present checks were left out?  Are there 
fail-safe measures that can be put in place to eliminate the need for human detection, 
harm, or error?  How serious is the result of errors not found?  Is a sampling check for 
errors enough? 
11.1.4.5.11.  Is there duplication of effort, in whole or in part? 
11.1.4.6.  Identify process improvements during process flowcharting exercises prior to the 
measurement and development of manpower equations and determinants.  The idea is to 
base the work center’s manpower requirements on the most effective and efficient way to 
perform the work. 
11.2.  Systems and Procedures Analysis. 
11.2.1.  Systems and procedures analysis is a specific technique used to solve information and 
flow problems.  Systems and procedures are essential parts of the management process.  These 
concepts put managerial decisions into action and provide for routine handling of recurring 
situations. 
11.2.2.  Systems and procedures analysis is well suited for looking at flow and clerical 
activities.  This analysis studies the flow of paperwork, the forms used, and where and how 
work is done. 
11.2.3.  The following terms are used in systems and procedures analysis: 
11.2.3.1.  System.  A network of related procedures integrated to meet an organization’s 
objectives. 
11.2.3.2.  Procedures.  A sequence of operations set up to get uniform processing by telling 
what actions are to be taken, who takes them, the sequence to be followed, and the tools to 
be used. 
11.2.3.3.  Method.  A manual, mechanical, or electronic means for individual operations. 
84 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
11.2.3.4.  System Diagram.  A system diagram is a chart made to aid comprehension of a 
general activity and its components.  It is used for doing relatively coarse analysis of an 
entire system.  There is no specified form; however, the form used should give a framework 
for the procedures making up a system.  The elements in a system diagram should include 
the system description; procedures action; organizational elements; skills; equipment; 
information inputs, resources, and outputs; and objectives and goals.  Information for doing 
a system diagram is collected through normal fact-gathering methods.  Entries for each of 
these recommended sections are described below. 
11.2.3.4.1.  System Description.  Tell how the system is related to the mission, 
functional activities, and managerial goals. 
11.2.3.4.2.  Procedures Action.  Summarize what is in each procedure.  Use one 
sentence for each procedure. 
11.2.3.4.3.  Organizational Elements.  List all the elements responsible for doing the 
procedures action statement in enough detail for clarity. 
11.2.3.4.4.  Skills.  List the AFSCs needed. 
11.2.3.4.5.  Equipment.  List the equipment used. 
11.2.3.4.6.  Information Inputs.  List information entering the system or procedure.  
The entry identifies the source of the information.  There is not always an input to each 
major action, nor is it necessary to list the output of the preceding step as an input. 
11.2.3.4.7.  Information Resources.  List data sources such as reports, files, records, 
guides, and directives.  Include information resources added to, or updated as part of, 
the action. 
11.2.3.4.8.  Information Outputs.  List all information created or dispatched as a result 
of the procedure.  Identify the format and destination of the outputs if going outside of 
the procedure.  There is not always an output from each major action. 
11.2.3.4.9.  Objectives and Goals.  Rank, for each procedure, the qualitative aspects of 
performance and the quantitative measures used. 
11.3.  Preparing a Procedure Chart. 
11.3.1.  A procedure chart is specifically designed to give, in symbol format, the type of work 
found in an administrative environment. 
11.3.2.  It follows the flow of information between work stations and shows decisions made 
and actions taken by individuals in these stations.  It also shows interrelationships between two 
or more forms, forms and material, or forms and workers. 
11.3.3.  A procedure chart gives a quick, accurate, and comprehensive picture of the total 
activity.  It is used to show both existing and proposed procedures.  When properly done, a 
chart is clear and can easily give a complete and correct picture.  The objective is to chart 
normal routine action, recognize possible alternatives, and stay in the mainstream of the 
procedure.  If done well, the procedure chart shows the following information about a 
procedure: 
11.3.3.1.  The title, number of copies, and source of each document entering the procedure. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
85 
11.3.3.2.  The method of preparation, organizational element, and person preparing each 
document originating in the procedure. 
11.3.3.3.  A symbol, with a short explanation to show each step in the procedure. 
11.3.3.4.  Processing times and movement distances (optional). 
11.3.3.5.  Final disposition of each copy of each document involved in the procedure. 
11.3.3.6.  Some common chart symbols and uses are found in Figure 11.4. 
Figure 11.4.  Common Procedure Chart Symbols and Usage. 
 
11.3.4.  Preparing a procedures chart starts with completing a narrative describing the work 
being done in step form, who is doing the work, and where it is being done. 
11.3.4.1.  Chart preparation begins with entering basic information on the chart such as 
procedure title, data, and analyst. 
11.3.4.2.  All charting starts in the upper left corner and goes down and across to the right 
on the chart.  The personnel activity flow is always on the left side of the procedure chart.  
Vertical columns are drawn to keep apart each individual organizational element used on 
the chart. 
11.3.4.3.  There is only one personnel column per chart, but there is a document column 
for each organizational element on the chart.  Explanatory comment generally goes with 
each symbol. 
11.3.4.4.  Use present tense with personnel symbols (what the person does) and use past 
tense (what is done to the document) with the document symbols. 
86 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
11.3.4.5.  If pertinent to the study, give the estimated processing time after each document 
symbol and show the distance moved with each move symbol. 
11.4.  Layout Analysis. 
11.4.1.  General Concepts. 
11.4.1.1.  Layout analysis studies are used to improve production, ease physical exertion, 
and shorten distances of travel for material and personnel.  These studies concentrate on 
the physical flow of work, may lead to substantial improvements, and are very useful as an 
aid to other method improvement techniques.  A layout study is defined as a systematic 
method to analyze procedures and facilities and to develop a plan providing an optimum 
workable arrangement of personnel and equipment. 
11.4.1.2.  The primary objective of a layout study is to arrange equipment and facilities to 
achieve material flows at the lowest cost, with the least amount of handling, and in the 
shortest amount of time.  Additional objectives include: 
11.4.1.2.1.  Increasing efficiency by getting a straight-line flow of work and 
minimizing backtracking in work processing. 
11.4.1.2.2.  Providing each employee with enough space to work efficiently while, at 
the same time, minimizing total space.  Air Force Office of Safety and 
Health/Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards specify minimum 
workspace requirements. 
11.4.1.2.3.  Providing the best working conditions in the space available. 
11.4.1.2.4.  Allowing expansion, reduction, and rearrangement of space to meet 
changing needs. 
11.4.1.2.5.  Eliminating furniture and equipment not needed in the work center 
operation. 
11.4.1.3.  Potential benefits of an effective layout are: 
11.4.1.3.1.  Improved Production.  Streamlining the flow of work increases production 
and improves quality.  Labor costs are correspondingly lowered.  Every moment saved 
in travel and delays aids in increasing the production rate. 
11.4.1.3.2.  Increased Employee Comfort and Safety. 
11.4.1.3.3.  Reduced Labor Turnovers. 
11.4.1.3.4.  Improved Supervision.  Careful layout planning makes controlling the 
workflow and inspecting easier for the supervisor. 
11.4.1.3.5.  Improved Quality.  Better layout reduces distractions and worker fatigue, 
eliminates frustration and undue pressures, and improves the quality of workmanship. 
11.4.1.3.6.  Better Space Utilization. 
11.4.1.3.7.  Reduced Costs.  Cost is the most important benefit.  Accelerating 
production, controlling waste, and reducing labor expenses all save money. 
11.4.2.  Layout Analysis Applicability. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
87 
11.4.2.1.  Steps necessary to conduct a layout study vary with each situation.  The 
techniques presented in this chapter may give more information than necessary for a given 
study, but all might apply.  Flexibility is key. 
11.4.2.2.  The mere drawing of a proposed layout does not constitute a layout study.  A 
hasty examination of the work center or function may reveal inadequacies in the present 
layout, but a thorough analysis of procedures and facilities usually reveals underlying 
causes for problems creating a low productivity environment.  Accurate and detailed 
definition of the problem is essential for problem solution. 
11.4.2.3.  Normally, layout studies are originated due to problems caused by one or a 
combination of these factors:  ineffectiveness of current layout or workflow; changes in 
volume of production or services; changes in mission, product, service, or equipment; 
changes in the number of people in the work center; modernization; poor work 
environment; frequent accidents; obsolete facilities; or new facilities. 
11.4.2.4.  Classify layout analysis studies according to the magnitude of the effort: 
11.4.2.4.1.  Minor change to present layout. 
11.4.2.4.2.  Major rearrangement of existing layout. 
11.4.2.4.3.  Relocating into other existing facilities. 
11.4.3.  Using Flow Diagrams for Layout Analysis. 
11.4.3.1.  Prepare a scaled layout chart of the area under study.  Use a standard scale when 
preparing the chart. 
11.4.3.2.  Record on the layout, as near the point of occurrence as possible, each step in the 
work process.  Use the same symbols as on a process flowchart. 
11.4.3.3.  Number each symbol in sequence.  If the diagram is being used in conjunction 
with a process flowchart, match each step to the chart. 
11.4.3.4.  Connect the symbols with a line to show the path traveled by the person or 
material under observation. 
11.4.3.5.  When presenting two or more workflows, use a different color for each flow. 
11.4.3.6.  Study the flow diagram for improvement possibilities.  Use the flow diagram 
checklist in Figure 11.5. 
Figure 11.5.  Flow Diagram Checklist. 
1. Workflow  
□ Does workflow follow a relatively straight line with minimum backtracking and 
crossover?  Where are the bottlenecks? 
□ Has each step been questioned and analyzed? 
□ Have other workflows been considered? 
□ Does furniture and equipment spacing consider at least minimum space requirements 
per worker as outlined in AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities. 
□ Does layout consider person-person and person-equipment workflow relationships? 
□ Is there excess furniture or equipment? 
88 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
□ Would movement of furniture or equipment reduce or eliminate the number of moves 
or distances? 
□ Does layout recognize nature of work such as privacy or security considerations? 
2. Diagram 
□ Does diagram portray its story clearly? 
□ Is diagram too elaborate and/or cluttered? 
□ Is it easier to understand than a chart or narrative description?  Is it more effective? 
□ Is the layout used current?  To scale? 
 
11.4.4.  Layout Analysis Development. 
11.4.4.1.  Analyze all data collected.  This systematic approach is recommended. 
11.4.4.1.1.  Determine facility location. 
11.4.4.1.2.  Plan overall layout. 
11.4.4.1.3.  Plan detailed layouts. 
11.4.4.1.4.  Plan processes and machinery around material functions. 
11.4.4.1.5.  Plan the layout around processes and machinery. 
11.4.4.2.  Consider the following: 
11.4.4.2.1.  Set up space, storage, production, service, safety, people, and type of work. 
11.4.4.2.2.  Furnish better working conditions to include lighting; use of colors;

communications; and location of break areas, lavatories, water fountains, and locker 
rooms, etc. 
11.4.4.2.3.  Set up telephone/information system needs, including number and 
placement of phones and lines, intercom systems, and cabling, etc. 
11.4.4.2.4.  Set up a workflow following the simplest and shortest path. 
11.4.4.3.  Prepare proposed process flowchart and work distribution charts to optimize 
workflows and travel.  Document the proposal on a revised flow diagram.

functional supervisor, solicit recommended changes, and delete impractical data from 
analysis. 
11.4.4.5.  Look at the differences between the proposed layout and present layout and 
evaluate these differences.  Does the proposed layout: 
11.4.4.5.1.  Produce a better product or increase production? 
11.4.4.5.2.  Smooth the flow of work or reduce effort? 
11.4.4.5.3.  Minimize material handling?

11.4.4.6.  Include a concise implementation plan with enough detail for systematic 
implementation. 
11.4.5.  Implementing the Proposed Plan. 
11.4.5.1.  Present all recommendations and the proposed implementation plan to the 
supervisor, then to other key senior leadership personnel.  Recognize it is the unknown 
rather than the new that creates apprehension.  Sell major ideas of the study in the order of 
anticipated acceptability to management.  Start off with those of a less controversial nature 
and follow with those most likely to involve more client hesitance.  A close alternative may 
often be readily accepted, thereby avoiding complete rejection of an idea or proposal. 
11.4.5.2.  On acceptance of final implementation plans, make sure all affected personnel 
are fully informed of the entire plan and specific responsibilities.  Set up a trial period to 
test new procedures and layout arrangements.  Continued contact during the test period is 
necessary to make sure all work center personnel understand, and to revise any aspects of 
improvement actions contrary to study objectives.  Ensure all recommendations are 
instituted as planned. 
11.5.  Work Distribution Analysis. 
11.5.1.  General Concepts. 
11.5.1.1.  Division of work is a potential area for productivity enhancement and is an aspect 
of skill determination for requirements determination. 
11.5.1.2.  Work distribution analysis is a technique used to evaluate specific steps and find 
each individual’s contribution to work center activity.  This technique is useful when the 
work center consists of several people and skills contributing to the same product or 
service. 
11.5.1.3.  Work distribution analysis looks at work counts and man-hours associated with 
each responsibility. 
11.5.1.4.  This technique is a good tool to check and compare present and proposed 
procedures during study preliminary research and consultant studies. 
11.5.2.  How to Prepare a Work Distribution Chart.  There are three basic steps to prepare this 
chart. 
11.5.2.1.  Step 1.  Have each person in the work center complete an activity task list.  Use 
this to record each duty activity and type of work done and estimate the average number of 
hours spent on each. 
11.5.2.1.1.  The activity list does not merely quote an Air Force Specialty (AFS) or job 
classification statement.  Use the task list to record a complete description of what each 
90 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
worker actually does.  Do not include ambiguous phrases like checking, administration, 
or make contacts. 
11.5.2.1.2.  Number tasks by activity to help in developing a work distribution chart.  
The WU volume aids in work distribution analysis. 
11.5.2.2.  Step 2.  Complete a work center activity list.  This list records the basic processes 
done by the work center.  It includes all the major activities completed to meet assigned 
objectives. 
11.5.2.3.  Step 3.  Prepare a work distribution chart.  The activity list gives the information 
needed to do the chart. 
11.5.2.3.1.  List the activity of the work center in the left column of the chart, in order 
of relative importance.  Leave space between lines. 
11.5.2.3.2.  Columns labeled “Tasks” are for listing the work done by each person.  
Complete a column for each person in the work center, listing each of the tasks in 
summary form.  Relate each task to the activity list in the left column.  Clearly separate 
the different tasks since analysis is impossible if a miscellaneous task is placed on the 
same line as the major job or operation of the work center. 
11.5.2.3.3.  For purposes of analysis, list individuals doing the activities in the first 
column by grade, beginning with the person in charge. 
11.5.2.3.4.  Record the hours per week spent by each person on each task in the proper 
column. 
11.5.2.3.5.  Enter work count data on the chart when relevant.  If possible, enter the 
work count as the number per week to be consistent with hours shown on the work 
distribution chart.  If a weekly count is not representative, enter the natural frequency 
of occurrence (e.g., /MO or /YR). 
11.5.2.3.6.  Sum the hours spent by all workers on each operation and enter the total in 
the column beside each item in the operation or process list. 
11.5.2.3.7.  Total the hours for each person. 
11.5.3.  Analysis. 
11.5.3.1.  After completing an initial work distribution chart, do a systematic analysis of 
the recorded findings.  Ask the following questions for a detailed examination: 
11.5.3.1.1.  Are skills being used properly?  Is everyone being used in the best possible 
manner, or are special skills and abilities being wasted?  Persons with higher skills 
should not do tasks that can be done by lower skill levels. 
11.5.3.1.2.  Is work distributed evenly?  Measure the relative importance of tasks 
assigned to persons engaged in similar tasks.  For example, two clerks of equal ability 
and grade normally should be charged with similar volumes of work.  Spread the urgent 
and important tasks as evenly as possible to make certain all work is done according to 
schedule. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
91 
11.5.3.1.3.  Are tasks spread too thinly?  Performances of the same task by many 
workers may mean duplication of effort.  The assignment of a task to one person sets 
responsibility and enriches the job. 
11.5.3.1.4.  Are individuals doing too many unrelated tasks?  A large number of tasks 
in any one column may show the individual has too many different tasks.  Greater 
efficiency results if workers are assigned related tasks. 
11.5.3.1.5.  Are the work center’s efforts misdirected?  Is the work center spending too 
much time on relatively unimportant operations or unnecessary work?  Instances of 
misdirected effort are very often found in miscellaneous or administrative processes. 
11.5.3.1.6.  Are there excessive supervision or consultation tasks?  Resistance to 
delegation of authority can restrict creativity and cause unnecessary delays. 
11.5.3.1.7.  What activities take the most time?  Are they the ones that should take the 
most time?  Normally, the largest total time is spent on what is considered the major 
activity in the organization.  If the activity is a continuing one with several steps, the 
analyst may make a more detailed analysis by preparing a work distribution chart.  
Identify such man-hour totals to mark them for future process analysis. 
11.5.3.2.  The answers to the above questions help develop improvement proposals.  
Prepare a new responsibility chart or distribution chart showing the recommended process 
and division of work.  This best displays proposed changes and compare them with present 
procedures.  Associated reductions in man-hour requirements should be displayed to 
support the change. 
11.6.  Histogram Chart. 
11.6.1.  General Concepts.  A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a 
series of quantitative observations.  The graph is usually a bar chart showing how the same 
parameter, measured on different components, is distributed within certain minimum and 
maximum limits.  The histogram is constructed by dividing the range of a variable into equal 
intervals.  A bar chart is then drawn showing how many data are located in each of the intervals.  
A histogram provides information by means of the shape of the distribution and the dispersion.  
See Figure 11.6.

11.6.2.2.  Identify the range (R) of data gathered.  This number is the difference between 
the largest (XL) and smallest (XS) value in the data. 
 
11.6.2.2.1.  Separate the data into classes (K).  See Table 11.3 below to identify the 
number of classes for different numbers of data points.

93 
Note:  To avoid having the same point as both the upper value of a class and the 
lower value of the next class, decrease the upper value by the correct decimal. 
11.6.2.2.2.  Determine the width of each class (H) using the formula, H = R/K.  Since 
the number of samples in the example is 75, use 10 as a convenient divisor.  For the 
data used in this example, the class width is 1.7/10 = 0.17.  After rounding to the nearest 
tenth, H = 0.20. 
11.6.2.2.3.  Identify the boundaries for each of the classes in the histogram.  Begin with 
the value of XS, the smallest number in the range of counts, and add the class width, H.  
Continue to add the class width until the number of classes selected in the example is 
reached.  In this example, XS = 7.0 as the lower boundary.  Adding 0.20 yields the 1st 
class ranging from 7.0 to 7.20.  The next class begins at 7.20 and extends to 7.40. 
11.6.2.2.4.  Identify the number of samples in each class to determine the frequency of 
occurrence and enable the construction of the histogram.  These counts give a 
horizontal histogram (see Table 11.4.).

11.6.2.2.5.  Construct the histogram to show the samples in each class.  In this example, 
the data is centered around a value of 7.90 and is very close to a bell-shaped curve.  The 
histogram gives a view of where the counts are centered and the amount of dispersion 
of the data.  See Figure 11.7. 
94 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
Figure 11.7.  Histogram of Example Data. 
 
11.6.3.  Histogram Shape.  The data in a histogram may not always be symmetrical. 
11.6.3.1.  The data can be tightly centered around a point or greatly dispersed, or bimodal 
(having two distinct clusters around separated frequencies) potentially indicating two 
separate populations under study.  In each case, evaluating the results of the chart furnishes 
useful information about the event or process being analyzed.  See Figure 11.8. 
11.6.3.2.  Be aware of twin or multiple peaks.  Their appearance may indicate the data is 
coming from two or more different sources.  If this is the case, stratify the data so the 
histogram uses only one data source.

11.7.  Control Chart.  A control chart is an effective tool for determining if samples come from 
the same population and if the variation between samples is sufficiently small to allow the use of 
the mean as the sole descriptive statistic of the population. 
11.7.1.  General Concepts.  Control charts give important graphical information to help 
determine where variation in a process might be normal or abnormal with the latter case 
requiring further analysis (see Figure 11.9.).  By plotting the sample points in time order (in 
sequence of occurrence), control charts can identify unusual changes in the process indicating 
the need for further analysis. 
96 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
Figure 11.9.  Example of a Control Chart. 
 
11.7.2.  Types.  There are two main types of control charts. 
11.7.2.1.  Attribute control charts are used to plot go or no-go factors such as an output 
being in or out of tolerance. 
11.7.2.2.  Variable control charts plot specific measurements of a variable characteristic 
such as size, time, or weight of an output. 
11.7.3.  Description of Terms. 
11.7.3.1.  Assignable Cause.  Any force and/or situation, not deemed part of the defined 
population that causes a sample to deviate significantly (exceeding established control 
limits) from the mean.  For example, a certain population of proportions may be defined as 
being “the level of daily productivity associated with the production of 40 to 60 units.”  If 
one day’s productivity exceeded the upper control limit (UCL) and the associated workload 
was 75 units, an analyst would know some force, not inherent to the defined population, 
was at work. 
11.7.3.2.  Common Cause.  A host of small, independent, and elusive forces acting on 
events or measurements.  Chance is normally responsible for the unassignable variation 
between elements of a population. 
11.7.3.3.  Observation.  The selection of one element of a population. 
11.7.3.4.  Population.  Any set of objects.  Each member of a population is called an 
element. 
11.7.3.5.  Range.  The difference between the highest and lowest value of any set of 
elements or observations. 
11.7.3.6.  Sample.  In this context, sample is assumed to be a random sample.  A random 
sample is the selection of one or more elements of a population - each element having the 
same probability of being selected. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
97 
11.7.3.7.  Sample Size (n).  A sample may consist of one or more observations, i.e., the 
number of observations is the size of the sample.  For example:  23 (sample size is 1); 23, 
27, 22, 21 (sample size is 4); and 20, 22 (sample size is 2). 
11.7.4.  Standard Deviation (s).  The square root of the variation.  The formula is: 
 
11.7.5.  Variation (s2). 
11.7.5.1.  The average of the squared deviation from the mean.  The formula is: 
 
11.7.5.2.  If the sample size is 30 or less, use the following formula for variation: 
 
11.8.  Pareto Chart. 
11.8.1.  General Concepts.  The Pareto chart is useful because it shows the areas experiencing 
the most problems that should be addressed first for correction.  Pareto analysis is a statistical 
technique in decision-making used for the selection of a limited number of tasks that produce 
a significant overall effect.  Utilizing the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, roughly 
80 percent of a work centers processes come from 20 percent of the efforts.  See Figure 11.10 
for an example of a Pareto chart. 
Figure 11.10.  Example of a Pareto Chart. 
 
98 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
11.8.2.  Procedures to Develop a Pareto Chart.  Determine which variable (e.g., cost, defects, etc.) will 
be used to evaluate different processes.  The samples are itemized into the processes that will be 
evaluated.  For example, if errors are occurring in a supply organization, evaluate the number of errors 
in the processes of receiving, shipping, storage, delivery, etc.  For documentation and validation 
purposes, specify the source of all counts. 
11.8.2.1.  Select a period of time to evaluate.  The time period can range anywhere from a day, 
week, month, quarter to years.  The samples for each process evaluated should come from the same 
time period for meaningful evaluation. 
11.8.2.2.  Draw horizontal and vertical axis for the diagram.  The processes are listed along the 
horizontal line.  The samples for the variable being evaluated are scaled on the left vertical axis.  
Values of 0 to 100 percent are scaled along the right vertical axis. 
11.8.2.3.  Total the samples for each process and use bars to represent the process.  The process 
with the largest total of samples is placed first on the far left.  The remaining processes are entered, 
ranging from those with the largest samples to the smallest.  If several processes have few samples, 
combine the samples and identify as other. 
11.8.2.4.  Use a line to show the cumulative total when adding each additional process.  The line 
goes from the tallest bar to the right and up until it reaches the right axis at the 100 percent point. 
11.8.2.5.  Usually, the tallest bars indicate the largest contributors to the overall problem.  Dealing 
with these areas first is logical.  However, most frequent does not necessarily equate to most 
important. 
11.8.3.  How to Use a Pareto Chart.  Use care when selecting the variable to evaluate different processes 
as potential candidates for problem solution.  Using total defects can show one process as a potential 
candidate.  But, by selecting cost of defects, a different process may show a larger impact.  When a 
change is made to a process as a solution to a problem, draw another Pareto chart after operating under 
the new process and check if the process has decreased in relation to the other processes evaluated. 
11.9.  Scatter Diagram. 
11.9.1.  General Concepts.  The scatter diagram shows the relationship, or correlation, between two 
variables or the influence one variable has on the other.  The variables could come from the potential 
WLFs of a requirement determinant study, a cause-and-effect diagram, or any other source generating 
variables.  The diagram is composed of an x-axis and y-axis.  The effected variable is placed on the y-
axis and the cause variable is placed on the x-axis. 
11.9.2.  Procedures to Develop a Scatter Diagram.  Draw a scatter diagram by collecting the data to 
plot the samples.  The individual samples are formed by the intersection of the (x, y) values. 
11.9.2.1.  Collect 50 to 100 (x, y) data pairs that form the samples on the diagram.  See Table 11.5 
for a partial listing of point pairs.

11.9.2.2.  Draw and label the x-axis and y-axis.  Plot the individual samples on the scatter 
diagram.  If samples overlap, place concentric circles around the point, with a circle 
representing each additional point.  See Figure 11.11 for an example of how to plot the 
samples and a scatter diagram. 
Figure 11.11.  Example of Plotting a Scatter Diagram. 
 
11.9.3.  How to Interpret a Scatter Diagram.  After the samples are plotted on the chart, observe 
if one variable affects the other.  See Figure 11.12 for a variety of possible results. 
Figure 11.12.  Scatter Diagram Outcomes. 
 
100 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
11.9.3.1.  If, as one variable increases in value the other also increases, there is a positive 
relationship or correlation.  The closer the samples are to an imaginary line extending from 
the lower to the higher samples the stronger is the impact of one variable on the other.  The 
more dispersed the samples from the imaginary line the weaker the relationship. 
11.9.3.2.  The diagram indicating “No Correlation” shows the data points scattered all over 
the diagram.  There is no indication of a distinguishable impact of one variable on the other. 
11.9.3.3.  The diagram indicating “Negative Correlation” shows as one variable increases 
in value, the other decreases.  As with “Positive Correlation”, the closer the samples are to 
an imaginary line extending from the lower to the higher samples, the stronger the impact 
of one variable on the other. 
11.10.  Cause-and-Effect Diagram. 
11.10.1.  General Concepts.  A cause-and-effect diagram (also known as an Ishikawa or a fish-
bone diagram) is used not only to identify a potential problem but also to analyze it as well.  
Any problem can have many possible causes.  The cause-and-effect diagram allows the user 
to identify potential causes of a problem in logical groups depending on the problem type.  The 
primary factors causing a product or service quality problem usually relate to unwanted 
changes in manpower, work processes, equipment, or raw materials.  To find the elements 
coming into play, follow a logical approach to identify the potential causes of a problem.  
Figure 11.13 illustrates the structure of a cause-and-effect diagram. 
Figure 11.13.  Example of Cause-and-Effect Diagram. 
 
11.10.2.  Procedures to Develop a Cause-and-Effect Diagram.  Identify what the problem is 
and briefly state it on the right side of the diagram.  Enclose this statement in a box.  Draw an 
arrow towards the problem statement extending to the left. 
11.10.2.1.  Identify the major categories of causes that potentially could cause the problem.  
Connect these categories to the line pointing to the problem statement. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
101 
11.10.2.2.  List the factors in each of these categories that could cause the problem, using 
an idea generating methodology such as the nominal group technique or brainstorming.  
Each of these branches can have branches identifying more specific causes of the stated 
problem.  See Figure 11.14 for an example of this branching. 
Figure 11.14.  Example of Detailed Listing of Causes. 
 
11.10.2.3.  A very important element of identifying the potential causes of a stated problem 
is to have personnel familiar with the needs for completing the product or service.  If a 
knowledgeable group of people is present, a very detailed breakdown of potential causes 
can be identified.  If the personnel are not familiar with the processes or needs, then too 
generalized a listing of potential causes could result.  See Figure 11.15. 
Figure 11.15.  Generalized and Detailed Listing of Causes in Cause-and-Effect Diagram. 
 
11.10.3.  Benefits of Using a Cause-and-Effect Diagram.  Any type of problem can be 
displayed on a cause-and-effect diagram.  It does not have to relate to quality or timeliness.  
For example, personnel, safety, and scheduling problems can also be analyzed using this 
diagram. 
102 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
11.10.3.1.  Greater knowledge about the factors influencing the problem will result in 
making the potential causes of the problem more evident. 
11.10.3.2.  The cause-and-effect diagram allows the participants to visually focus on the 
various categories of causes that could impact a problem.  This makes it easier for the group 
to focus on generating potential causes. 
11.10.3.3.  All personnel participating in the analysis gain from the interaction of ideas 
produced in the group.  This interaction not only serves the purpose of generating ideas for 
solving a problem, but also aids in educating the participants about the various factors 
impacting the problem being addressed.

Chapter 12 
SIMULATION MODELING 
12.1.  General Concepts. 
12.1.1.  Simulation is an analysis technique using computer software that can be used in the 
MEP to model organizational systems.  These models can be used to evaluate system changes 
prior to implementation and without the need for a complete re-study of a function’s processes.  
This chapter does not provide instruction for any specific simulation software package but is 
intended to provide general philosophy, methods, and practices for guiding an analyst using 
simulation. 
12.1.2.  Simulation software provides an environment for building a representation (model) of 
the system under study and simulating the dynamic behavior of that system.  When the 
simulation is run, the software typically displays an animation of the modeled system and 
components (which can be of value to the analyst).  The simulation can be run many times to 
characterize probabilistic differences in the timing of the processes of the modeled system; 
software compiles summary statistics for the simulated system runs.  No model is a perfect 
representation of real-world.  The focus should be on enabling USAF leadership to make 
defendable, data-driven decisions. 
12.2.  Typical Applications for Simulation Modeling.  Based on the study’s purpose, most 
simulation models may contain several applications found in Table 12.1. 
Table 12.1.  Typical Application of Simulation Modeling.

throughput, or cycle-time). 
12.3.  Criteria for Selecting Simulation Modeling. 
12.3.1.  Many, but not all, functions are candidates for simulation modeling.  Simulation 
modeling may not be desirable when there is a more appropriate tool for the situation. 
104 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
12.3.2.  Other tools may preclude the need for a simulation model when an organizational 
system lacks process interdependencies; is well-defined and repetitive; and/or can be 
represented with simplistic, static, mathematical models.  However, if “what-if” analyses are 
desired, standard models may require extensive or complete rework to evaluate changes. 
12.3.3.  Simulation modeling builds representations of complex systems (complete with 
interdependencies and variability) and numerically evaluates probabilistic processes to 
estimate characteristics of the system being studied.  Once the simulation model is built, the 
analyst can run the simulation over different time horizons with the ability to perform various 
“what-if” scenarios.  The animated representation of the system typically provided by 
simulation software can be useful in communicating study results.  Once simulation models 
are developed, the model is maintained as a function’s processes are modified, removed, or 
added, which can save time and money in future development costs. 
12.3.4.  A requirements determinant may use simulation modeling alone or in conjunction with 
other tools. 
12.4.  Classification of Simulation Models. 
12.4.1.  Below are the four dimensions by which simulation models can be classified. 
12.4.1.1.  Static vs. Dynamic Simulation Models.  A static simulation model is used to 
represent a system that does not change over time, while a dynamic simulation model is 
able to represent the system as it changes over time. 
12.4.1.2.  Deterministic vs. Stochastic Simulation Models.  With deterministic models, the 
output of the model is “determined” when the set of inputs are specified, with no variability 
(randomness) in the output for the specified, non-random input.  When the input or 
modeled processes introduce randomness to the system, a stochastic (probabilistic) 
simulation model must be used.  The output of a stochastic simulation model will also be 
random, lending the results to analysis using statistical methods.  Note:  While a system 
may have elements (processes) that are both random and deterministic, a model with any 
random components is considered stochastic. 
12.4.1.3.  Continuous vs. Discrete Simulation Models.  In a continuous simulation, the state 
of a modeled element changes continuously over time.  Continuous simulations are 
generally utilized when differential equations describe the behavior of the modeled 
systems.  In a discrete simulation, the state of modeled elements changes instantaneously 
at separate points in time.  A simple context for understanding the difference is vehicle 
refueling.  As a continuous simulation, consider the rate of fuel flow over time and model 
the refueling process as percent full at a given time; with a discrete simulation, the model 
would simply show the vehicle as full at a specific time governed by the specified 
distribution for that process. 
12.4.1.4.  Terminating vs. Non-terminating Simulation Models.  Terminating simulation 
models end with a specific event (or certain time period).  Non-terminating models do not 
have a specific event that stops the simulation.  With non-terminating simulations, we are 
usually interested in the system’s behavior once steady state is achieved (which can be 
difficult to define). 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
105 
12.4.2.  Simulation models that are discrete, dynamic, and stochastic (of both termination 
varieties) tend to be the most flexible and useful.  These simulations are called discrete event 
simulations and will be the focus of the remainder of this chapter. 
12.5.  Advantages, Disadvantages, and Pitfalls of Simulation Modeling. 
12.5.1.  Advantages. 
12.5.1.1.  Simulation lends itself to representation of complex, real-world systems where 
mathematical models may lack an analytical solution. 
12.5.1.2.  Allows the analyst to estimate system performance based on forecasted changes 
and/or evaluate an alternative’s effect on system performance.  An example would be 
evaluating the effect of different levels on system performance. 
12.5.1.3.  Provides an environment for system experimentation at a reduced cost, and with 
better experimental control than experimentation with real-world systems. 
12.5.1.4.  Simulation provides the ability to either compress timeframes to study systems 
in the long-term or expand timeframes to understand more detailed aspects of the system 
studied. 
12.5.2.  Disadvantages and Pitfalls. 
12.5.2.1.  Resource Intensiveness.  Developing simulation models can be a resource 
intensive process requiring significant time, as well as the cost of acquiring and 
maintaining access to appropriate simulation modeling software. 
12.5.2.2.  Planning and Execution.  Simulation models may fail due to poor planning and 
execution.  Simulation fails to produce useful results often due to a poor understanding of 
system dynamics rather than to a lack of software proficiency.  This may be due to an 
unskilled analyst, unavailability of data, or unsupportive management.  A simulation may 
also fail to meet decision maker needs due to unclear objectives or unmanaged 
expectations.  Therefore, the best way to guarantee success is to ensure everyone involved 
in the study understands the process, benefits, and limitations of simulation. 
12.5.2.3.  Documentation Requirements.  Documentation of facts, assumptions, data, and 
analysis is important for any study.  However, it becomes more critical to the success and 
durability of the model when using simulation.  Provide detailed model assumptions and 
rationale on the assumption decisions.  By documenting the assumptions, the analyst 
facilitates functional communities’, other analysts’, and ultimately the decision maker’s 
ability to understand the simulation model’s context.  Clear and concise assumptions 
provide credibility to the simulation model.  Simulation modeling software provides the 
capability to capture all the study’s documentation, facilitating quick and timely changes 
to the model for a particular function for years into the future. 
12.5.2.4.  Data Preparation and Analysis.  The simulation model is only as good as the data 
collected and analysis conducted.  Process activities are accurately and clearly defined to 
facilitate accurate work measurement.  Critical analysis is required for process activities 
and work measurement data throughout the study.  Ensure the data gathered is logical and 
supportable. 
106 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
12.6.  Principles of Simulation Modeling. 
12.6.1.  Define the Model’s Purpose.  By focusing on the model’s purpose, the analyst focuses 
on the information relevant to designing the model within the study scope, the formulation of 
key performance measures and experiments to be simulated (e.g., manpower required at 
different levels of service), and ultimately the success of the study.  This is arguably the 
primary overarching principle of simulation modeling. 
12.6.2.  Simulation Modeling is an Iterative Process.  Simulation models are built iteratively, 
progressing from simple to complex over time. 
12.6.3.  Avoid Unnecessary Detail.  The idea behind this principle is to capture the primary 
processes of the system rather than every minute detail.  For example, there is no need to model 
lunch breaks unless the work center is required to be manned to service customers during that 
time.  Analysts may run into situations that may seem relevant initially, which subsequent 
analysis does not support.  Remove the element or feature once it is determined to be 
unimportant to the model’s purpose.  A key economical consideration is to not design for peaks 
that only occur occasionally or rarely. 
12.7.  Simulation Study Process.  Each study requires a model based on the current system.  
When developing improvements to the system, a model is altered to proposed specifications or 
different scenarios are used.  The analyst should not improve the model until understanding the 
current system and validating the system’s “as-is” model.  This should not prevent identifying 
potential improvements when developing the “as-is” model. 
12.7.1.  Proper data collection and data analyses are critical before the simulation model is 
developed.  Process flowcharts and data may be collected within or outside of the software 
tool.  Use all required techniques and tools (i.e., histograms, Pareto charts, etc.) available to 
verify the data is logical and correct. 
12.7.2.  When developing improvements, consider eliminating or realigning workload, 
optimizing manpower resource skill mix, and changing processes or procedures to reduce 
backlogs and/or improve cycle and process times.  Identify potential risks and mission impacts. 
12.7.3.  When conducting requirement determinant studies, consider developing models or 
scenarios to evaluate the impact of issues on the current workforce, such as training, staffing, 
backlog, or projected increases to workload. 
12.7.4.  Document both the current and proposed simulation model results in terms of 
resources, cycle and process times, and backlogs.  Through use of scenarios, it is possible to 
provide leadership with sound data to make decisions on level-of-service issues. 
12.7.5.  The following is a summary of the procedure used in simulation modeling. 
12.7.5.1.  Step 1.  Define Purpose, Objectives, Scope, and Requirements.  Clearly 
document the study purpose, objectives, scope, and requirements.  This helps all involved 
parties to understand what is included in the simulation model, and what questions it should 
and should not answer.  The analyst follows the documented plan, allowing for 
modifications as new in-scope information is discovered.  Modifications to the plan should 
be documented and shared with all involved. 
12.7.5.2.  Step 2.  Collect and Analyze System Data.  Systematically collect data needed to 
build the model.  Data collection is more productive when the end result is taken into 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
107 
account.  Keep the study purpose, objectives, scope, and scenario in mind when 
determining what data is required.  The output of this step is the initial development of a 
conceptual model and a data document (with participant concurrence that it contains data 
representative of the process to be modeled). 
12.7.5.3.  Step 3.  Build the Simulation Model.  A system being modeled should first be 
defined in terms listed in Table 12.2.  Begin with the conceptual model developed in the 
data-gathering effort.  Remember, the model is a simplified representation of reality based 
on the study purpose, scope, and scenario, therefore, changes to the model should not be 
arbitrary, but rather systematic and documented.

12.7.5.4.  Step 4.  Simulation Model Verification and Validation.  Do not neglect 
verification and validation.  It is an ongoing activity that is accomplished throughout the 
study.  Facilitate verification and validation by:  validating the study purpose, scope and 
scenario are consistent with the simulation model; reducing the amount of complexity in 
the model; building the model and including notes so it is readable and understandable; 
using object-oriented techniques to organize the model data; and thoroughly documenting 
model data and logic. 
12.7.5.5.  Step 5.  Conduct Experiments.  Run the simulation for each scenario to be 
evaluated and analyze the results.  Analysis involves both subjectivity and statistical 
108 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
procedures.  When developing experiments, keep in mind the purpose and scenario to avoid 
wasting valuable time.  Prior to running the simulation, there are decisions to make 
concerning the modeling parameters to facilitate output analysis. 
12.7.5.6.  Step 6.  Present the Results.  Present the findings based upon standard reporting 
procedures for a requirements determinant.  Simulation models provide various statistically 
relevant output reports, charts, and graphics that may be used to support study assumptions 
and recommendations.

Chapter 13 
MANPOWER MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION USING CORRELATION 
AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS 
13.1.  General Concepts. 
13.1.1.  General Uses and Principles of Correlation and Regression (C&R).  There are many 
uses for C&R analysis in the Air Force MEP, including: 
13.1.1.1.  Development of a man-hour or manpower equations using work measurement 
data. 
13.1.1.2.  Determination of FEEs and functional models using non-measurement data. 
13.1.1.3.  Evaluation of multiple potential WLFs. 
13.1.1.4.  Evaluation of differing levels of service (e.g., performance metrics) for varying 
levels of manpower. 
13.1.2.  A good manpower forecasting model developed using C&R provides a mathematical 
equation that provides an acceptably accurate prediction about the relationship between 
varying levels of workload and required man-hours or manpower for the function. 
13.1.3.  Although C&R may create the aforementioned manpower forecasting models, C&R 
statistics never prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the potential WLF and the 
function’s required manpower.  Rather, it is logic or science that ultimately proves a true cause 
(e.g., the function’s WLFs) and the effect (e.g., the function’s required manpower) relationship. 
13.2.  Workload Factors and Work Units. 
13.2.1.  Selecting WLFs or WUs for Statistical Model Development. 
13.2.1.1.  When using C&R analysis to develop a statistical manpower model, potential 
WLFs are identified and collected. 
13.2.1.2.  When C&R is not utilized (e.g., ratio unit times (RUT) approach), WUs are 
identified and collected for use during the process flowcharting of the SWD in developing 
the requirements determinant equation.  If it is later determined during analysis that C&R 
is a better approach, a WU may become a viable WLF.  See Chapter 16 on RUT. 
13.2.1.3.  Although valid WUs and WLFs share many required attributes (as discussed 
below), the terms are not interchangeable.  A key distinguishing difference between the 
two terms is a WU is a direct product of an individual process, while a WLF represents a 
broader driver and/or indicator of workload (i.e., relates to more than just one process, if 
not all processes). 
13.2.2.  Technique Determination.  Weigh several factors when determining which man-hour 
equation development technique to use.  Such factors include the future determinant’s ease of 
application, cost associated with data collection, and the maintainability in future years. 
13.2.2.1.  Advantages and Disadvantages of WUs and RUT Techniques. 
13.2.2.1.1.  Advantages: 
13.2.2.1.1.1.  WUs are readily identifiable when the SWD is constructed properly. 
110 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
13.2.2.1.1.2.  Functional communities easily relate to WUs because WUs are 
something produced routinely. 
13.2.2.1.1.3.  Work centers often have systems in place to assist with data collection 
efforts. 
13.2.2.1.1.4.  These techniques can be used with any size population. 
13.2.2.1.2.  Disadvantages: 
13.2.2.1.2.1.  Work centers often have many WU counts, making it difficult to 
apply the equation. 
13.2.2.1.2.2.  There may be an increased number of computations due to a greater 
number of WU counts. 
13.2.2.1.2.3.  It is likely that the lack of predictability and programmability of WUs 
does not assist in quantifying required manpower in the future. 
13.2.2.1.2.4.  Management information systems or practices may not currently be 
in place to accurately capture WUs. 
13.2.2.1.2.5.  WUs can often be manipulated by the work center. 
13.2.2.2.  Advantages and Disadvantages of WLF and C&R Techniques. 
13.2.2.2.1.  Advantages: 
13.2.2.2.1.1.  WLFs can greatly reduce the amount of data that is collected to apply 
the equation. 
13.2.2.2.1.2.  Programmable WLFs are easier to predict future required manpower. 
13.2.2.2.2.  Disadvantages: 
13.2.2.2.2.1.  May not find a suitable WLF meeting minimum statistical test 
requirements. 
13.2.2.2.2.2.  Functional personnel may complain about the final equation not 
representing the function’s workload or is not sensitive enough to mission changes 
to be a practical requirements determinant. 
13.2.2.2.2.3.  Cannot be used with less than seven data points. 
13.2.3.  Identifying WUs.  WUs are quantifiable, direct outputs of work processes.  Using 
process flowcharting and analysis, a SAT is determined for a specific WU by mathematically 
summing all intermediate activity SATs within the process.  See Chapter 16 on RUT. 
13.2.3.1.  Key WU Attributes.  Identify WUs for each defined work activity or process.  
For maximum utility, WUs should be: 
13.2.3.1.1.  Directly related to the time and effort spent on the associated process. 
13.2.3.1.2.  Economical and convenient to report and use. 
13.2.3.1.3.  Mutually exclusive, so no item is counted under more than one WU. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
111 
13.2.3.1.4.  Open to audit, so the accuracy of a work count is readily verified by setting 
up a work count system or through existing internal work measurement programs or 
management information systems. 
13.2.3.1.5.  Readily understood by those who plan, schedule, and control the work and 
readily identifiable when seen produced. 
13.2.3.1.6.  Individually standardized in terms of the procedures needed for production. 
13.2.3.2.  WU Uses.  Depending on the established or intended use of the WU, each of the 
above attributes assumes a varying degree of importance.  The most important 
characteristic of a WU is it defines a specific amount of work; thus, avoid vague WU titles, 
definitions, methods of counts, and sources of count. 
13.2.4.  Identifying WLFs.  WLFs normally drive and can be logically related to major man-
hour or manpower expenditures in a function.  The ultimate objective is to select a potential 
WLF that is logical, collectable, relatable, predictable/programmable, and not within the 
control of the function.  Of these attributes, the two significant WLF attributes are: 
13.2.4.1.  Relatability.  The potential WLF logically and statistically relates to manpower 
requirements to the extent any change in the value of the WLF produces a corresponding 
change in the man-hours or manpower needed to do the work (i.e., as the volume of work 
increases, so do required man-hours or manpower).  Relatability presents a difficult 
problem because accurate data for correlation analysis is rarely available early in the effort.  
Identification of potential WLFs should begin during preliminary research. 
13.2.4.2.  Predictability.  To make the equation useful as a forecasting tool, the 
quantification of the WLF value should be programmable (i.e., programmed in the DAF 
budget, or can reasonably be predicted for future time periods).  Identify the predictability 
of a factor by examining available functional information. 
13.2.4.3.  Relationships Between Attributes.  WLF selection can be challenging due to the 
relationship that often exists between accuracy and programmability.  With a highly finite, 
precisely defined WU, there is a high probability of correlation, but the chance of 
predicting the future workload volume is usually small.  As the definition of the WU is 
broadened into a WLF, the chance of accurately predicting the future volume increases, 
but the likelihood of getting an acceptable degree of correlation goes down. 
13.2.5.  Procedures for Defining Potential WLFs.  WLFs should be both accurate and 
programmable.  Factors which are also used for programming are preferred over those which 
are not.  However, do not sacrifice accuracy for programmability in developing the equation.  
When needed, a separate equation can be developed for programming manpower requirements.  
Identify potential WLFs using the following procedures: 
13.2.5.1.  Identifying Factors.  First, identify external or work generator-type factors.  
Typical examples are:  number of aircraft assigned; average monthly flying hours flown; 
or military population served.  All of these examples also have the advantage of being 
programmable. 
13.2.5.2.  Review WUs.  Second, refer to WUs identified during analysis of outputs of the 
work center (i.e., those associated with processes with the greater man-hour requirement).  
112 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
These are the internal or production-type WUs such as a jet engine overhauled, an airframe 
repaired, an item issued, or a form processed. 
13.2.5.3.  Review Potential WLFs.  Prepare a list of the potential WLFs identified from the 
above procedures, listed in the order of development (i.e., the external or work generator-
type, first).  Leave out any potential WLFs that are not readily identified or easily counted, 
and any internal ones that are relatively insignificant.  To obtain valid counts for all the 
potential WLFs during measurement, define the potential WLF: 
13.2.5.3.1.  Title.  Briefly identify what is to be counted.  Use singular noun form, verb 
past tense (e.g., should read “vehicle repaired”, not “vehicles repaired”). 
13.2.5.3.2.  Definition.  Define, in precise terms, the WLF.  Vague definitions are not 
acceptable.  From the title example above, what types of vehicles are to be counted?  
For another example, if population served is the potential WLF, clearly state whether 
the count includes tenants, on-base population, off-base population, transients, average 
daily student load, Reserve, National Guard, and/or individual mobilization 
augmentees. 
13.2.5.3.3.  Source of Count.  Specifically identify the source from which the count is 
to be obtained.  It is critical that workload data is collected from the same exact source. 
13.2.5.3.4.  Method of Count.  Once the source of count has been found, how is the 
potential WLF counted?  Is the WLF count a monthly average over the past 6 to 12 
months?  Is it a current account of primary aerospace vehicle (aircraft) inventory (PAI) 
supported?  Are there specific counts excluded?  Ensure the WLF count can be 
adequately counted and reported. 
13.2.5.3.5.  Rationale.  Include the reasons for selecting WUs or WLFs.  Describe how 
and why the selected WUs or WLFs are expected to relate to the measured man-hours 
or manpower. 
13.2.5.3.6.  After Selection.  Once a WLF is selected for use in the requirements 
determinant, the preceding WLF title, definition, source of count, and method of count 
are revised as needed to ensure accuracy and placed in the equation. 
13.2.6.  Workload Data Collection and Analysis.  When possible, work count procedures 
should call for a minimum of six months historical data, although 12 months of data are 
preferred.  Additional years of data can assist in analysis of trends and/or peaks and valleys in 
volume.  (Note:  Work count should be collected by month and not averaged for the period.)  
Validate as representative before use in further analysis. 
13.2.6.1.  Establishing a Work Count System.  Ideally, there are existing resource 
management systems, output measurement programs, or management information systems 
from which the data can be obtained.  Existing reporting systems should be validated to 
ensure accurate workload information.  When acceptable workload counts are not readily 
available, work with the functional OPR to establish a work count system. 
13.2.6.2.  Collection System.  The collection system should be established as early as 
possible in the development, and only address workload data essential to equation 
development (and, possibly for future requirements determinant application). 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
113 
13.2.6.3.  Safeguards.  Establish safeguards (e.g., a random external audit of the workload 
reports) to minimize the possibility of a duplicated or missed count, or a non-representative 
count. 
13.2.6.4.  Potential Equivalent WLFs.  To increase overall standard accuracy and ease of 
requirements determinant application, consider the use of equivalent WLFs.  An equivalent 
WLF is used to get a count for similar work that has different workload content (i.e., PATs).  
See below for an example of establishing an accurate work count system using equivalent 
WLFs. 
13.2.6.4.1.  Consider the WLF "a vehicle maintained for a vehicle maintenance unit."  
To produce a more accurate accounting of the WLF consider using equivalents to 
accurately portray the workload associated with the preventative maintenance on a 
sedan versus a truck. 
13.2.6.4.2.  Suppose during work measurement, it was determined it takes 120 man-
hours to service a truck compared to 100 man-hours to service a sedan.  Since the 
vehicle mix may vary considerably from location to location, the use of vehicle 
equivalencies may be the correct way to calculate the accurate manpower for total 
vehicles maintained for any given installation. 
13.2.6.4.3.  Using the PAT relationship to establish a mathematical equivalency 
between truck and sedans, the following equality can be established: 
 
13.2.6.4.4.  When this type of WLF is used, a baseline output is valued at 1.0, (in this 
case the sedan is given a 1.0) and the other outputs are valued in relation to this baseline 
(i.e., the truck could be given a 1.2). 
13.2.6.4.5.  The total WLF count is obtained by adding all equivalents (i.e., (10 sedans 
x 1.0) + (5 trucks x 1.2) = 16.00 total equivalents). 
13.2.6.4.6.  Identify potential equivalent WLFs early.  Data collection should be 
designed to allow creation of equivalent values.  Remember, the time value of the 
measurement should be the same for all vehicles used in the equivalent, and it should 
be equal to the baseline output (in this case the sedan).  This is necessary because the 
WLF value is being adjusted to compensate for the differences in time needed to service 
the sedan and the truck. 
13.2.7.  Result.  The end result of C&R is only as good as the logic and data the analysis is 
based upon.   Dedication to the fidelity of the input data is requisite for a good result. 
13.3.  Developing a Correlation and Regression Model.  The basic steps for developing 
regression equations are similar regardless of the final manpower model selected.  However, C&R 
calculations can become more complex depending on equation form, and the number of potential 
WLFs regressed in the case of multivariate regression. 
13.3.1.  Although C&R analysis is truly two separate processes, these calculations are usually 
both performed to provide a more complete picture.  Note:  Although the Air Force MEP has 
traditionally used the acronym C&R, in actuality, regression analysis is performed first with 
correlation analysis evaluating the resulting regression line’s goodness of fit. 
114 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
13.3.2.  Regression analysis involves the pairing of a dependent variable with an independent 
variable(s) to define a mathematical relationship (i.e., regression fits a line to the data that may 
be described mathematically, with an equation). 
13.3.2.1.  For example, this process involves pairing the measured and/or calculated man-
hours (Ym) required on the vertical (or Y) axis) with the data of an independent variable on 
the horizontal (or X) axis).  Note:  In reality for multivariate regression, as more 
independent variables are added, multiple axes are paired with the Y-axis. 
13.3.2.2.  The regression analysis ultimately yields a man-hour equation (Yc), in a linear or 
curvilinear form, that can then be used for the prediction of manpower requirements under 
varying workload within specified extrapolation limits.  For example, regression analysis 
might yield the following a man-hour equation, where Yc is the regression equations 
calculated required man-hours and X1 is a WLF, such as PAI, supported by the work center: 
 
13.3.2.3.  For instance, in the case of a work center servicing 18 aircraft (PAI), this example 
man-hour equation would yield 1911.41 required direct man-hours. 
 
 
 
13.3.2.4.  Figure 13.1  shows a scatter diagram with a regression line drawn to fit the 
paired data (X, Ym).  Note:  Although FTEs instead of man-hours can be used in the 
development of an equation, this approach is generally not recommended due to updates 
in MAFs that change the hours required to earn FTEs.

13.3.3.  Correlation analysis, on the other hand, is the process of calculating key statistics about 
the regression equation.  These key correlation statistics and tests give an indication of just 
how good the regression equation predicts manpower requirements. 
13.4.  Manpower Models Derived via Regression Analysis. 
13.4.1.  Types of Models.  Acceptable models resulting from a C&R analysis can be classified 
as one of the following categories: 
13.4.1.1.  Bivariate model (using a single WLF) or multivariate model (using multiple 
WLFs). 
13.4.1.2.  Linear model (an equation resulting in a straight line) or curvilinear model (an 
equation whose function does not result in a straight line, i.e., the equation’s line curves). 
13.4.2.  Equation Forms.  Manpower models derived via regression analysis can be identified 
by the equation forms as: 
13.4.2.1.  Linear bivariate model (a general linear form). 
13.4.2.2.  Linear multivariate model (a general linear form). 
13.4.2.3.  Parabolic model (a special bivariate, curvilinear form). 
13.4.2.4.  Power model (a special bivariate form). 
13.4.2.5.  Ratio model (a special bivariate form). 
13.4.3.  Model Example.  Figure 13.2 shows linear bivariate, parabola, ratio, power equation 
models, all using the same data.

13.4.4.  General and Special Mathematical Equation Forms.  The general and special 
mathematical equation forms of the most common manpower models created by regression 
analysis are provided in Table 13.1.  In each equation, the dependent variable (Yc) represents 
man-hours, and the independent variable (X) or variables (in the case of multivariate 
regression), represent WLF volume(s).

An exponential curve that 
requires both the dependent and

then multiply each side by X.  The 
resulting equation becomes 
  X   = a + bX 
Y 
Has 2 coefficients:  a and b 
*  For manpower purposes, these models are only useful until the apex of the data, since it is 
unrealistic for workload to increase and man-hours to decrease 
118 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
13.4.5.  Further Discussion of the Use of Special Equation Forms. 
13.4.5.1.  The power, ratio, and parabola are models that show a general deceleration in the 
rate (i.e., slope) at which manpower is increased for increased workload.  In effect, 
acceptable curvilinear regression models show a certain economy of scale in a work 
center’s required manpower as the WLF volume increases. 
13.4.5.2.  While the ratio and power curves are legitimate mathematical forms, each cannot 
be directly compared statistically to the linear and parabolic forms because of the data 
transformations involved.  These data transformations change the distributional properties 
upon which the statistical tests are based. 
13.4.5.2.1.  Therefore, use the power and ratio models with caution and use when a 
parabola fits the data better than a linear equation and the apex is either within or just 
outside the data range. 
13.4.5.2.2.  A comparison of the models shown in Figure 13.2 demonstrates that a 
parabola model form fits the data better than a linear equation, and the resulting 
parabola’s apex is within the data’s extrapolation range.  In this case, since the 
parabolic model’s apex occurs prior to the upper extrapolation limit (see Figure 13.3), 
the equation’s slope becomes negative; and thus, required manpower illogically 
decreases as workload increases.  In this case, one of the special equation forms may 
still represent the curvilinear nature of data in the same manner as the parabola but 
without the issue of the parabola model’s apex. 
Figure 13.3.  Parabolic Equation with Apex within Extrapolation Limits. 
 
13.4.6.  Understanding the Regression Coefficients.  The regression coefficients for the 
different regression model forms, are the values resulting from regression analysis 
computations to form the regression equation.  Figure 13.4 shows a synopsis of the various 
equation forms discussed up to this point, with the last column showing the total number of 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
119 
coefficients realized for the linear bivariate, parabolic, ratio, and power curve as well as two 
examples of a linear multivariate form.  (Note:  Any given multivariate form could have more 
than three X variables if more than three potential WLFs need to be explored.) 
Figure 13.4.  Relationships Between Equation Forms and the Regression Analysis Terms. 
 
13.4.6.1.  The a-value represents the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis.  
The a-value should never be referred to as the open-the-door cost or fixed man-hours.  
Rather, the a-value is simply the y-intercept determined through regression computations 
and helps account for some of the unexplained variation within the equation. 
13.4.6.2.  Each b-coefficient of the individual independent variable(s) represents an 
amount of influence from its corresponding X-variable given that all of the other 
independent variables are held at a constant value.  For example, the coefficient value b1 
for X1 in the bivariate equation Yc = a + b1Xl would not have the same coefficient value 
estimated for the same X1 in the multivariate equation Yc = a + b1X1 + b2X2, since the 
additional WLF (X2) now comes into consideration. 
13.4.7.  Meeting Minimal Statistical Criteria for Manpower Models Developed Using C&R.  
Requirements determinant equations developed by the study team using regression analysis 
must meet certain minimum correlation statistical requirements.  (T-2) These minimal 
requirements are shown in Table 13.2.  Additionally, each requirements determinant equation 
must meet the realistic and economic test criteria as shown in Table 13.3  (T-2)

13.4.8.  Least Squares Regression Analysis.  This technique yields an equation (Yc) that best 
fits the observed data (Ym) by minimizing the total variation (i.e., the residuals) for the observed 
data above and below the regression line. 
13.4.8.1.  The residuals are defined as the difference between the observed and calculated 
man-hours (Ym-Yc).  Assumptions regarding residuals follow: 
13.4.8.1.1.  Residuals are independent of each other.  Residuals are normally 
distributed with zero mean and constant variation (i.e., which is saying that the data 
points are normally distributed around the regression line and as the X-values increase 
or decrease), the amount of dispersion stays constant and does not correspondingly go 
up or down.  Figure 13.5 provides a graphical depiction of the residual differences 
between the regression line and specific data points. 
13.4.8.1.2.  In order for an equation to qualify for linear regression analysis, it should 
be of the form Yc = a + b1X1 + b2X2 +…+ bn Xn, or be of a form that can be reduced to 
an equation of this type; that is, linear with respect to the regression coefficients (b).  
This qualification still allows for the transformation of the independent (i.e., WLF) 
variables (X) into a power (X²), reciprocal (1/X), or log X as needed for an equation 
form. 
13.4.8.1.3.  The values of the independent variable(s) (i.e., the WLF(s)) can be 
measured with little or no variability. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
121 
Figure 13.5.  Residual Differences Between Measured Data (Ym) and the Regression 
Equation (Yc). 
 
13.4.8.2.  Before performing least squares regression computations: 
13.4.8.2.1.  Verify the accuracy of the input data and purge it of any data collection 
errors.  Tools such as control charts and scatter diagrams assist in determining if data 
are reasonable and logical. 
13.4.8.2.2.  Obtain at least the minimum number of required data points when 
performing C&R.  The number of input points in regression analysis becomes 
important in testing the significance of the regression line. 
13.4.8.2.3.  Generally, the more input points that are used to determine the regression 
line, the more information that can be gained about the nature of the work center under 
investigation.  To have a meaningful test, there should be enough data inputs to allow 
a good estimation of the variability within the data after the coefficients are estimated. 
13.4.8.2.4.  Never perform regression analysis on less than seven data points.  In 
regression analysis, statistical tests are based on (n - 1) and (n - m) called degrees of 
freedom.  The total number of observations or data points is n, and m is the total number 
of coefficients.  Therefore, the more points in the sample, the more information there 
is to add validity to the statistical test.  The inputs should adequately portray the 
behavior of the data at various levels of workload.  Understanding the nature of the data 
cannot be done with just a few data points. 
13.4.9.  Determining the Regression Coefficients and Equations.  Use work measurement, data 
collection, and statistical software to develop an equation that meets the statistical criteria and 
model selection guidelines (see Chapter 14).

CORRELATION STATISTICS 
14.1.  General Concepts.  Correlation statistics are needed to evaluate how well an equation (Yc) 
represents the measured data (Ym).  These measures are essentially derived from the measures of 
the measured man-hour data’s central tendency, the variation within the measured man-hours, and 
the regression equation itself. 
14.2.  Exploring a Linear Bivariate Equation. 
14.2.1.  Linear Bivariate Data Example. Table 14.1 shows the paired X,Y data (Ym data here 
shown in FTE) and the resulting regression equation:  Yc = 1.375 + 0.5333X.  Table 14.1 
further shows the calculated value (placing each X value into the equation to determine Yc).  
(Note:  This example is shown in FTEs for simplicity’s sake, normally, all equations developed 
should remain in man-hours to accommodate the potential use of different MAFs during 
requirements determinants application.)

14.2.2.  Total Sum of Squares (TSS).  When the data contained in the X-values are not used for 
prediction purposes (i.e., just the Ym-values are used), the best prediction of a new Y-value is 
simply the measure of central tendency (Y̅ ).  Hence, the total variation within the system is 
associated with the TSS deviations of the Y-values about its own mean (Y̅ ).  The equation to 
calculate TSS is as follows, TSS = ∑(Ym - Y̅ )2.  Data in Table 14.1 shows that TSS = 97.875.  
Figure 14.1 depicts the computations graphically.

14.2.3.  Sum of Squares Explained by Regression (SSR).  When the data contained in the X-
values is used to form a prediction equation (such as, Yc = a + bX), the best estimate of a new 
Y-value is Yc instead of Y̅ .  The variation in the system is reduced by using Yc.  The amount of 
reduction is defined as the SSR.  The degrees of freedom for SSR are (m-1).  The equation to 
calculate SSR is as follows, SSR = ∑(Yc - Y̅ )2.  Data in Table 14.1 shows that SSR = 72.666. 
Figure 14.2 depicts the computations graphically.

124 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
14.2.4.  Sum of Squares Unexplained by Regression (SSE).  The remaining variation in Y is 
defined as the SSE.  Here, the word “unexplained” is used only to indicate that the relationship 
between X and Y is not completely explained mathematically by the calculated regression line.  
The equation to calculate SSE is as follows, SSE = ∑(Ym - Yc)2.  Data in Table 14.1 shows 
that SSE = 25.217.  Figure 14.3 depicts the computations graphically. 
Figure 14.3.  Graph Depicting SSE, the Delta Between the Ym and the Regression Line (Yc). 
 
14.2.5.  Relationships between TSS, SSR, and SSE. 
14.2.5.1.  The sum of SSE and SSR equals TSS.  This can be expressed mathematically as: 
∑(Ym - Y̅ )2 = ∑(Yc - Y̅ )2 + ∑(Ym - Yc)2 
or TSS = SSE +SSR 
14.2.5.2.  Dividing both sides of the equation by the TSS, results in two proportions that 
sum to 1.0: 
 
14.2.6.  Coefficient of Determination (R-Squared).  R2 is defined as the proportion of the total 
variation (TSS) that is explained by the regression line: 
 
14.2.6.1.  Determining the R-Squared.  When the regression coefficients in the equation 
are estimated with the least squares method, a relationship needs to be calculated to 
determine the equation’s goodness of fit. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
125 
14.2.6.2.  The R-Squared Values Range from Zero to One.  When the regression line 
explains most of the variation, R2 approaches the value of 1.0.  When there is a large amount 
of unexplained variation, i.e., a poor fit, R2 approaches zero.  An R2 approaching zero, 
would visually appear as a shotgun pattern in a scatter diagram. 
14.2.6.3.  Example Computation of R-Squared.  Using the data in Table 14.1., SSR = 
72.666 while TSS = 97.875.  Computations of the R2 will demonstrate that the regression 
equation explains 74.2% of the total variation. 
 
14.2.7.  The Coefficient of Correlation (r).  The square root of the R2 is defined as the 
coefficient of correlation (r), which ranges from -1.0 to +1.0.  The sign of r is the same as the 
slope of the regression equation.  This is determined by the sign of the b-coefficient in the 
linear model or can be seen in the scatter diagram. 
 
14.2.8.  Adjusted R-Squared.  For multivariate regression analysis and dealing with sampled 
data, an adjustment to the R2 value needs to be made that takes into consideration the sample 
size (n) and the number of regression coefficients (m) being tested to compensate for a 
potentially inflated R2. 
14.2.8.1.  The adjusted R2 is determined by the following formula: 
 
14.2.8.2.  For example, if a multivariate analysis yielded an R2 value of 0.874 using 14 data 
inputs (n) and regressing 5 test potential WLFs, the adjusted R2 value would be: 
 
14.2.9.  Standard Deviation of Y (Sy).  The standard deviation of the measured man-hours (Ym) 
is estimated by the square root of TSS divided by the appropriate degrees of freedom (n-1). 
14.2.9.1.  The Sy is determined by the following formula: 
 
14.2.9.2.  This equation for Sy is the same as the equation for the sample standard deviation 
(s), even though they look different.  When basic algebraic procedures are used, this 
expression can be put in a form that is easier to compute: 
126 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
 
14.2.10.  Standard Error of the Estimate (Syx).  When SSE is divided by the appropriate degrees 
of freedom (n-m), the variation that remains in the regression system is estimated.  The square 
root of this is defined as the standard error of the estimate (Syx): 
 
14.2.10.1.  Using the data from Table 14.1., SSE = 25.217 and n = 8.  There are two 
regression coefficients (a and b) in the bivariate equation of Yc = 1.375 + 0.5333X with m 
= 2.  This leaves 6 (8-2) degrees of freedom.  Placing this information into the formula, Syx 
is calculated as: 
 
14.2.10.2.  The Syx is used to calculate the coefficient of variation (V). 
14.2.11.  Coefficient of Variation (V).  The standard error of the estimate gives a measure of 
how the observed data is scattered about the regression line.  To compare this information 
between different equations, a relative measure is needed.  Hence, the coefficient of variation 
(V) is defined as the standard error of the estimate divided by the average measured man-hours. 
14.2.11.1.  The V is determined by the following formula: 
 
14.2.11.2.  Using the data in Table 14.1., Y̅ m = 7.375 and Syx = 2.05 as determined in 
paragraph 14.2.10.1.  The coefficient of variation (V) is calculated as: 
 
14.3.  Significance Tests.  Regression analysis incorporates significance testing which is used to 
measure the reliability of either the sample regression coefficients, the sample R2, or both.  The 
reliability aspect is pertinent, because the input data (Ym) are only a sample of values usually taken 
from an infinitely large population. 
14.3.1.  The F-test.  To be useful in prediction, an equation needs to explain or account for 
more of the variability in the man-hours than is left unexplained.  The F-test is a significance 
test used for this determination.  To accomplish the F-test, two values are needed:  the test 
statistic (F) and the critical value (F*). 
14.3.1.1.  The test statistic (F) is the ratio of the variation explained by regression to the 
unexplained variation.  These variances are obtained by dividing appropriate sum of 
squares with the respective degrees of freedom.  Notice that because of the relationship 
between SSR and R2, this test statistic can be derived from either value.  Notice also that 
when the double fraction is simplified (as in the first part of the relationship) the degrees 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
127 
of freedom for the numerator (m-1) appear in the denominator (as in the second part).  The 
same switch occurs with the degrees of freedom for the denominator (n-m). 
 
14.3.1.2.  F, expressed as a function of R2 is: 
 
14.3.1.3.  The critical value for the F-test, [F* = F(1−∝, −1, −)], comes from the F-Table 
(see Attachment 2). 
14.3.1.3.1.  First determine the confidence level desired (80 percent, 90 percent, or 95 
percent confidence) and choose the appropriate F-Table (see Attachment 2).  Note:  
The C&R APPLICATION TOOL defaults to 80 percent confidence. 
14.3.1.3.2.  Next find the degrees of freedom for the numerator (m-1) arrayed across 
the top of each of the tables.  The degrees of freedom for the denominator (n-m) are 
listed down the left-hand side of the tables.  Cross-reference both the degrees of 
freedom for the numerator with the degrees of freedom with the denominator to obtain 
F*. 
14.3.1.3.3.  For example, if the analyst wished to be 80 percent confident, and the data 
and regression analysis yielded 12 degrees of freedom in the numerator and 30 degrees 
of freedom in the denominator, using Table A2.1, the F* value = 1.446. 
14.3.1.4.  If the test statistic is larger or equal to the critical value (F ≥ F*), the equation 
explains a significant amount of variation in the sampled man-hours. 
14.3.1.5.  For example, an analyst has performed an initial C&R analysis using 30 samples 
(n) and four potential WLFs (m) and achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 
0.8728. 
14.3.1.5.1.  Step 1.  First, calculate the F-value. 
 
14.3.1.5.2.  Step 2.  Using Table A2.1 (at 80 percent statistical confidence, ∝ = 0.20), 
with 3 (m-1) degrees of freedom in the numerator, and 26 (n-m) degrees of freedom in 
the denominator, to get an F* value of 1.660. 
14.3.1.5.3.  Step 3.  Since F ≥ F * (59.468 ≥ 1.660), at least one or more of the 
coefficients is significantly different from zero, and the equation does explain a 
significant amount of variation in the sampled man-hours. 
14.3.2.  The t-test.  The individual coefficients of an equation must also be significantly 
different from zero to keep the associated factor in the equation.  This determination is made 
with a t-test.  A variable whose coefficient is not different from zero (not significant) 
128 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
contributes virtually nothing to the prediction equation.  As with the F-test, a test statistic and 
a critical value are needed to perform this test. 
14.3.2.1.  To calculate the test statistic for multivariate coefficients (tbi) use the following 
equation: 
 
14.3.2.1.1.  In this equation, bi is the regression coefficient in equation being tested and 
sbi is the standard error of the slope of the equation for the individual coefficient being 
test. 
14.3.2.1.2.  The standard error of the slope is calculated using Xi, where Xi represents 
the particular tested coefficient’s potential WLF values.  The sbi is determined by the 
following equation: 
 
14.3.2.1.3.  The test statistic (tbi) is usually calculated by automated statistical routines; 
however, in the case of only two independent variables (X1 and X2), it may be calculated 
manually.  In other multivariate situations (more than two independent variables), use 
of a reliable automated statistical package to calculate and print out those t-values 
(confidence levels) will be acceptable. 
14.3.2.2.  The critical value, [t* = t(1- α /2, n-1)], comes from the t-Table (see Table A2.4.).  
The significance level (1-α) is set at 80 percent which means alpha (α) = 0.20.  This is 
based on the decision that to take a workload out of the equation when it may be valuable 
is more damaging than to leave a variable in the equation when it may be of little value.  
Because the t-test is two tailed (concerned with values positively and negatively different 
from zero) the alpha-level is split and the critical value becomes [t* = t(0.90, n-1)].  The 
degrees of freedom for the t-test are the number of measurement samples less one (n-1). 
14.3.2.3.  If the test statistic (t) calculated from the data (considering it as an absolute value) 
is greater than or equal to the critical value (t ≥ t*), the coefficient in question is 
significantly different from zero and should be used in the equation. 
14.3.2.4.  For example, suppose an analyst is given 4 WLFs, with 10 samples for the data 
shown in Table 14.2.

14.3.2.4.1.  To obtain the necessary information to calculate the t-test statistic for each 
coefficient, develop the man-hour equation using multivariate regression to determine 
the individual coefficients and calculate the SSE: 
 
14.3.2.4.2.  Step 1.  Find the standard error of the slope of the equation for the first 
coefficient tested, with n = 10: 
 
14.3.2.4.3.  Step 2.  Calculate the t-test statistic for the first coefficient being tested: 
 
14.3.2.4.4.  Step 3.  Using Table A2.4 (at 80 percent statistical confidence), and with 
9 (n-1) degrees of freedom, the t-value = 1.3830. 
14.3.2.4.5.  Step 4.  Since tb1 ≥ t* (6.435 ≥ 1.383), the coefficient b1 is significantly 
different from zero and should be used in the equation. 
14.3.2.4.6.  Step 5.  Repeat calculations in steps 1- 4 to find the t-test statistic for the 
second coefficient being tested: 
 
14.3.2.4.7.  Step 6.  Since tb2 ≥ t* (0.9085 ≥ 1.383), the coefficient b2 is not significantly 
different from zero and should not be used in the manpower equation.  (Note:  In some 
instances, a functional community may be concerned a specific WLF be include in the 
final equation even if the coefficient failed the t-test.  At the discretion of the analyst, 
the failed coefficient can be kept in the equation; however, this practice should be kept 
at a minimum since it drives additional cost of data collection for requirements 
determinant application with little effect.)

14.3.2.4.8.  Step 7.  Repeat, steps 1- 4, for the remaining test coefficients b3 and b4. 
14.3.2.4.9.  Figure 14.4  shows the two tailed test and rejection areas for the null 
hypothesis when performing the t-test.  (Note:  The calculations of the t-test statistics 
for b1 and b2 for the example in Steps 1 through 6 are shown on the figure.)

14.4.  Potential Problems Encountered When Doing C&R. 
14.4.1.  Sometimes during multivariate C&R analysis, two or more of the independent 
variables may be highly correlated with each other.  This situation is called multicollinearity, 
and it is an undesirable condition.  This means there are correlated independent X-variables 
adding similar (thus, little additional) information to the model. 
14.4.1.1.  Identifying 
Multicollinearity. 
 
Although 
the 
best 
defense 
against 
multicollinearity is applying logic early in the effort, the analyst can spot multicollinearity 
occurring by viewing and/or conducting the pairwise analysis and take appropriate action 
by not regressing these particular potential WLFs together. 
14.4.1.2.  Pairwise Analysis of WLF Values.  The C&R APPLICATION TOOL provides a 
pairwise analysis of WLFs to assist analyzing the C&R results.  This pairwise analysis regresses 
each WLF (Xi) against each of the other WLFs, resulting in a coefficient of correlation (r) as shown 
in the matrix in Table 14.3.  The WLFs X1-X7 reveal a high degree of multicollinearity occurring 
between certain pairs.

14.4.2.  Using only the statistic R² (coefficient of determination) as a measure of absolute 
“goodness” can be misleading when the number of coefficients is very near the number of 
input data sets.  For example, three data points fit exactly an equation with three coefficients 
(Y = a + bX + cX²), thus producing a misleading R² value of 1 (perfect correlation).  The 
objective is to find an equation that accurately explains most of the variation within a system 
not to achieve a perfect mathematical fit. 
14.4.3.  While evaluating C&R results, the analyst needs to understand the difference between 
measured man-hours that are fixed (man-hours that remain constant relative to changes in WLF 
counts) and those that are variable (man-hours that do vary (positively) with changes in WLF 
counts).  It is possible the statistical R² value can be improved and made more relevant by 
regressing only the measured variable man-hours that relate to a potential WLF and adding 
back the fixed man-hours as constant man-hours to the final man-hour equation. 
14.5.  Guidelines for Final Manpower Model Selection.  After creating multiple manpower 
models, the analyst is often left with the task of evaluating one or more manpower equations for 
final posting in a requirements determinant.  The final acceptance selection a manpower model for 
that work center needs a balance between several different factors. 
14.5.1.  Absolute Minimum Criteria for Selection.  Any given model is required to first pass 
the following minimum criteria for selection as a manpower model: 
14.5.1.1.  All equations, regardless of equation form, are required to meet minimum 
statistical criteria previously outlined in Table 13.2.  No further consideration can be given 
to those models that do not meet these criteria. 
14.5.1.2.  Equations should not have a high resultant a-value in a manpower model.  A 
model is unacceptable when its a-value quantifies the majority of the work center’s 
manpower requirement. 
14.5.1.2.1.  For example, examine the equation Y = 540.52 + 0.0015X (where X = base 
military population).  The equation’s b-value when combined with the WLF (X) results 
in relatively insignificant man-hours; that is, an increase of 10,000 military personnel 
(i.e., the X-value) only creates 15 man-hours of additional required man-hours. 
14.5.1.2.2.  In this example, the slope of the regression line is basically flat, and 
therefore, the WLF has little effect on determining the work center’s total man-hour 
requirement. 
14.5.2.  Additional Criteria for Selection.  If one or more possible manpower equations remain 
after meeting the criteria outlined in paragraphs 14.5.1.1 and 14.5.1.2, then the following 
criteria, in order of precedence, for selecting the final manpower model are as follows: 
14.5.2.1.  Model Impact.  The prime consideration for any model selection is accuracy and 
if that accuracy is manifested through the equation’s impact.  Generally, those models with 
the higher R2 and lower V values have the more favorable impact.  However, always check 
this assumption against an actual equation application, and the lead and functional team’s 
insight into the logic of the by-location impact. 
14.5.2.1.1.  A manpower equation’s impact is judged by each location and not in the 
aggregate.  In other words, the model’s impact is logical and reasonable at each location 
where the model applies. 
132 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
14.5.2.1.2.  Judging a manpower equation by its aggregate impact, i.e., adding together 
all the manpower increases and decreases together for all affected bases in an effort, 
means little to the true accuracy of the requirements model. 
14.5.2.2.  Ease of Requirements Determinant Application.  If two or more equations still 
continue to pass acceptable impact, the next model selection criteria is focused on ease of 
application.  Specifically, consider the total workload in applying the determinant: 
14.5.2.2.1.  First, select equations with programmable WLFs (i.e., an equation with 
some or more programmable WLFs should be selected over equations with no or fewer 
programmable WLFs). 
14.5.2.2.2.  Next, if all is still equal, choose the equation with the fewest WLFs to 
reduce the workload involved with the collection of WLFs and equation application 
required. 
14.5.3.  Selecting the Simplest Regression Equation Form.  If all other criteria still put the 
remaining potential manpower equations as equal, select the simplest equation beginning with 
linear bivariate, curvilinear bivariate, and finally linear multivariate. 
14.5.4.  Realistic and Economic Criteria.  Equations that do not satisfy the realistic and 
economic criteria are not acceptable as requirement determinant models.  Reasons why a model 
may not have the desired attributes include such things as incorrect input data, non-
representative input data, limited range of workload values, two or more distinct levels of 
operation included in the data, non-standardization of the system, extreme values included in 
the data, and inappropriate model selection.  Man-hour equation coefficients meet both the 
realistic and economic criteria when the b-coefficient is positive in the linear model (Y = a + 
bX).  Increases in workload result in a constant positive increase in manpower. 
14.5.4.1.  In a multivariate model (Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + … + bnXn), a given b-value may 
be negative; however, in all realistic scenarios, an increase in workload should yield a total 
increase in required man-hours. 
14.5.4.2.  In the parabolic model (Y = a + bX + cX²), the b-coefficient is positive, and the 
value of cX2 is negative, and workload values do not exceed the point where X = -b/2c (i.e., 
the parabola’s apex).  If the b and c conditions are met and workload is greater than -b/2c, 
increasing workload after the apex results in decreasing manpower and the model is not 
realistic. 
14.5.4.3.  In the power model (Y = aXb), the a-coefficient is positive, and b-coefficient is 
between zero and one.  This restricts the model to an increasing function where Y increases 
more slowly as X increases. 
14.5.4.4.  In the ratio model (Y = X/(a + bX)), the a-coefficient and b-coefficient are greater 
than zero. 
14.6.  Extrapolation Limits. 
14.6.1.  General Concepts.  Extrapolation is defined as extending the regression line beyond 
the range of input data. 
14.6.1.1.  Any man-hour equations developed via C&R analysis techniques as well as man-
hour equations developed via RUT equations, are bounded by extrapolation limits. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
133 
14.6.1.2.  Man-hour equation extrapolation limits are established, at 25 percent above and 
below the largest and smallest Yc value.  These limits represent the maximum amount an 
equation can be extended.  They do not preclude the use of more limited extrapolation 
when the total amount would be unrealistic. 
14.6.1.2.1.  Based upon the definition of the upper and lower extrapolation limits, 
sample large and small bases during equation selection.  Getting large and small work 
centers in the original analysis allows for a wider (if not widest possible) application 
of the new requirements determinant. 
14.6.1.2.2.  Upper and lower extrapolations limits are established, as the MEP would 
assume too much risk in further presupposing an equation’s behavior remains the same 
beyond the established extrapolation limits.  For example, a function’s manpower 
initially determined by a bivariate linear equation may truly become non-linear beyond 
a certain point. 
14.6.2.  Calculating Extrapolation Limits. 
14.6.2.1.  Determining the Upper Extrapolation Limit.  To determine the upper 
extrapolation limit of the man-hour equation, the following formula is used, where Yc is the 
largest calculated value based upon the original sample data to create the equation: 
Upper Extrapolation Limit = max Yc x 1.25 
14.6.2.2.  Determining the Lower Extrapolation Limit.  To determine the lower 
extrapolation limit of the man-hour equation, the following formula is used, where Yc is the 
smallest calculated value based upon the original sample data to create the equation: 
Lower Extrapolation Limit = min Yc x 0.75 
14.6.2.3.  Example Calculation.  Table 14.4 shows an example of the calculation of lower 
and upper extrapolation limits.  The upper extrapolation limit is 25 percent above the 
highest value (Base E) and equals 2718.55 man-hours.  The lower extrapolation limit is 25 
percent below the smallest value (Base A) and equals 644.67 man-hours.

Chapter 15 
MODULAR EQUATIONS 
15.1.  General Concepts.  Modular equations are a series of separate equations rather than one 
single equation.  These individual equations represent independent processes that comprise the 
required man-hours for the work center.  While this type of representation is not appropriate, nor 
needed for every work center, it does give visibility to the required man-hours for a work center 
by processes and may aid in the maintenance of the determinant man-hour equation.  This 
advantage warrants careful consideration of the modular equation approach at the outset of any 
study effort.  Specific guides for when and where to use this technique follow these general 
comments: 
15.1.1.  Develop modular equations for individual processes that represent different levels of 
service furnished to the customer.  Based on these level-of-service modules, the OPR has the 
flexibility to choose the pertinent module for a given location or situation. 
15.1.2.  As work center requirements change (processes added, deleted, or modified), change 
the individual modules (insert or remove) to show the new work center requirements.  This 
makes it relatively easy and cost-effective to maintain the standard. 
15.1.3.  By virtue of design, calculate a "man-hour cost" associated with each process when 
using modular equations. 
15.1.4.  Modular equations make it easy to analyze a work center for "what-ifs." 
15.1.5.  Represent individual processes not performed at all locations with a standard at the 
process level.  Development of variances is therefore eliminated. 
15.2.  Specific Design Considerations. 
15.2.1.  The first and perhaps the most critical step in using a modular equation in requirements 
determination development is the preliminary research.  Carefully research the nature and 
function of the work center to determine the suitability and feasibility of describing the work 
center as a composite of independent processes.  Use the modular equations procedure only 
when the man-hours needed for a work center can be subdivided into independent modules of 
work that account for all man-hours.  These modules may represent one or more processes as 
defined in a SWD.  Limit the number of modules to a minimum to reduce the complexity 
involved in using such a determinant. 
15.2.1.1.  A module of work is independent if it can be added to or removed from the work 
center without imposing an increase or decrease in man-hours in another module.  Thus, it 
can be considered a module in a modular equation.  In other words, a work center that 
needs a given number of hours to do the work within module A is not expected to 
experience a change in these hours due to increases or decreases in the work in module B. 
15.2.1.2.  See Figure 15.1 for a simplistic example indicating a potential use for SWD 
processes in a modular equation. 
136 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
Figure 15.1.  Example Relationship between SWD and Modular Equation Processes. 
 
15.2.1.2.1.  In Figure 15.1., SWD processes 3 and 5 are not independent because the 
amount of time needed to keep bench stock is related to the number of engines to be 
repaired.  Therefore, if the workload is increased in process 3 (that is, more engines to 
be repaired), the work in both processes would increase.  In a modular equation, 
consider these two processes (and possibly others) in one general process - engine 
repair. 
15.2.1.2.2.  SWD process 4 is independent of processes 3 and 5 since periodic 
inspections are done on all engines.  The addition (or deletion) of the work would not 
change the hours needed to do engine repair or keep bench stock supplies.  Represent 
this process with a different module in the modular equation. 
15.2.2.  Each module should have at least one WLF that is logically and statistically related to 
the work described. 
15.2.3.  Each module must meet the minimum number of locations. 
15.2.3.1.  Only include modules of work that are present in at least seven of the work center 
locations.  Any fewer is considered a variance or a small population. 
15.2.3.2.  Measure some locations with all modules present.  This produces a more accurate 
statement of the required work. 
15.3.  Indirect Man-hours. 
15.3.1.  When OA is the primary measurement method, use the IAF to credit indirect man-
hours.  Use the IAF to form a separate indirect module.  Represent this with an equation that 
expresses the indirect man-hours as a function of the direct man-hours.  This can either be a 
linear or parabolic equation.  The indirect equation remains separate from the equations for 
direct work and is applied only after the direct work is computed.  This procedure sets a 
relationship between indirect and direct work.  Indirect man-hours (Y) are regressed against 
direct man-hours (X) for each of the input bases.  Develop the IAF factor as follows: 
Y = (a + bX)(IAF) 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
137 
15.3.2.  When WS is the primary measurement method in multi-location modular studies, use 
measured indirect man-hours to form a separate indirect module.  Represent this with an 
equation that expresses the indirect man-hours as a function of the direct man-hours.  Equation 
development and procedures outlined for OA also apply to WS. 
15.3.2.1.  The b-value in the linear case represents the proportion of indirect time to direct 
time.  Table 15.1 shows relationships between direct and indirect percentages.  Use this 
information as a guide.  In Figure 15.2, a typical indirect equation was computed to be:  
Yind = -15.94 + 0.1829 (Ydir).  This allows an additional 18 percent (approximately) of the 
direct time for indirect work.

15.3.2.2.  The a-value determines the line with this slope (the b-value) to use.  A negative 
a-value (as in the example above) does not mean there is an automatic loss of man-hours.  
As in any equation, consider the a-value only in combination with the rest of the equation.  
For a given amount of direct work (for instance 950 hours), compute the hours added for 
indirect work from the indirect equation. 
Yc = -15.94 + (0.1829)(950.0) = 157.82

AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
15.4.  Developing Modular Equations. 
15.4.1.  After a work center has met specific design considerations, develop a modular 
equation as follows: 
15.4.1.1.  Step 1.  Identify all work center outputs (customer needed products or services).  
For each output, develop a task list of the process or processes needed to produce the unit 
of work (output).  For each output, identify a WU (end item).  Using the output task lists, 
develop a SWD so each independent process becomes a module, and each module has its 
own WU.  Structure the modules to account for all of the work described in the SWD.  Be 
certain each process is included in one and only one module.  Identify the relationship 
between the modules and the associated WLFs.  To avoid confusion during equation 
computation, clearly specify all relationships from the beginning. 
15.4.1.2.  Step 2.  Proceed with the measurement in the usual manner to collect all of the 
needed man-hours and workload counts.  Use normal procedures for data collection and 
examination. 
15.4.1.3.  Step 3.  Aggregate the data to the levels necessary for the separate modules. 
15.4.1.4.  Step 4.  Perform regression analysis for each module.  Keep the statistics (R², Syx, 
and V) with each equation. 
15.4.1.5.  Step 5.  Combine the information from each of the modules with the procedures. 
15.4.2.  An alternative to developing modular equations as described above is to use RUT.  The 
a-values (fixed man-hours) are developed by computing the mean fixed man-hours of all of 
the measurement locations.  The b-values (variable man-hours) are developed by computing 
the mean RUTs of all of the measurement locations.

RATIO UNIT TIMES DETERMINANTS 
16.1.  General Concepts.  Utilization of RUT for development of requirements determinants has 
been expanded to include large populations, as well as single location and small population 
determinants.  The decision to use RUT for large populations should be based on analysis of 
workload count variations.  If the workload counts do not vary widely from one location to another, 
RUT is appropriate.  If there is a wide variation, consider breaking the large population into smaller 
ones (e.g., small workload count, medium workload count, large workload count).  If this is not 
feasible or desirable, then use regression analysis.  This chapter addresses development procedures 
to be followed when using RUT. 
16.1.1.  Population Definition. 
16.1.1.1.  Single location is applicable when the function under study is specific to one 
location, or the service furnished (mode of operation) is very different from other locations. 
16.1.1.2.  Small population is defined as a population consisting of two to six locations. 
16.1.1.3.  Large population is defined as a population of seven or more locations.  (Note:  
It is possible that large populations can be broken down to smaller populations based on 
analysis of workload data). 
16.1.2.  Input Data. 
16.1.2.1.  The quality of the input data is important in any study.  However, it becomes 
increasingly important for small populations and single location studies because of the 
limited amount of data available.  Accuracy is of great importance when limited 
measurement is possible.  Since it is the only information available, it is essential to get the 
best estimate(s) possible. 
16.1.2.2.  When using OA as the primary measurement method, get multiple time estimates 
to find the best representation of the per accomplishment times (see Chapter 5).  Evaluate 
these measurements carefully, using available statistical analysis techniques. 
16.1.2.3.  Accuracy is also critical when WS is selected as the prime measurement method 
(see Chapter 24). 
16.2.  Ratio Unit Times. 
16.2.1.  The ratio (b-value) is the result of measured direct man-hours divided by the associated 
workload.  It represents the direct man-hours needed to produce one unit of work.  The ratio 
development process is similar for both OA and WS except for one distinct difference:  The 
IAF is not used in WS; therefore, the final equation developed using WS does not need 
adjustment. 
16.2.2.  Equations developed by RUT take one of two forms, depending on whether or not the 
fixed man-hours are separated from the variable man-hours. 
16.2.2.1.  The first equation form is:  Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + … + bnXn where the a-value 
represents the sum of the fixed man-hours, and the b-values represent the ratios of the 
variable man-hours to the respective WLFs. 
140 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
16.2.2.2.  The second equation form is Y = b1X1 + b2X2 + … + bnXn and is the same as the 
first equation except there is no a-value.  Use of the second equation is optional. 
16.2.2.3.  Associate variable man-hours with processes or steps that are expected to show 
a relationship with the selected WLF. 
16.2.2.4.  An example of using RUT for a single location determinant with the first 
equation form is shown in Table 16.1.

16.2.2.5.  The RUT procedure can be extended to develop small population and large 
population determinants.  To do so: 
16.2.2.5.1.  When only one WLF is used, sum the variable man-hours for that WLF for 
each location.  Divide this sum by the sum of WLF values to form a ratio (see Table 
16.2.). 
16.2.2.5.2.  When more than one WLF is used, develop a ratio for each WLF (see Table

AIR FORCE SPECIALTY SKILLS AND GRADES DETERMINATION 
17.1.  General Concepts.  The process of skill and grade determination converts total manpower 
requirements into units of manpower with the skills and grades necessary to do the defined work 
center mission.  Skill and grade determination must not be affected by external constraints or 
funding limitations.  The minimum essential work center requirements must be engineered and 
documented independently of resource availability.  Other methods may be used, but the specific 
procedure and data source must be documented in the requirements determinant final report. 
17.2.  Skill and Grade Determination without Correlation and Regression. 
17.2.1.  Step 1.  Total man-hours are derived by summing the direct and indirect man-hours. 
17.2.2.  Step 2.  Divide the man-hours in step 1 by the correct MAF.  Round the resulting 
fractional manpower requirement to the correct whole manpower requirement. 
17.2.3.  Step 3.  Consult with the work center supervisor and local OPR to get a proposed 
distribution.  Record the recommended distribution. 
17.2.4.  Step 4.  Check recommendations and rationale, average the recommendations for each 
level on the manpower table, and complete the table.  Reconcile any grade inversion on the 
manpower table.  For example, the number for a particular grade and skill should not decrease 
when compared to the previous column on the manpower table. 
17.3.  Skill and Grade Determination with Correlation and Regression. 
17.3.1.  During SWD development, determine the AFSCs based on steps in each process.  Skill 
distribution is also decided and shown as a percentage of each step.  Complete the following: 
17.3.1.1.  Investigate manpower currently used in the work center, including current 
authorized and assigned military and civilian strengths along with their respective grades 
and skills by MAJCOM and base.  MPES is a source for military and civilian authorizations 
while local base products will give assigned strength data. 
17.3.1.2.  Check corresponding Air Force Specialty descriptions in the Air Force Officer 
Classification and the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directories, and Specialty Training 
Standard. 
17.3.1.3.  Identify steps that need to be done by a specific AFS, skill level, or grade. 
17.3.1.4.  Analyze the SWD and, based on research and interviews with the functional 
OPR, identify the AFSC needed to do the step. 
17.3.1.4.1.  The concept that workers spend most of their work time performing at their 
highest skill level governs what skills are needed.  Identifying and distributing skill 
catalogs the total manpower requirement into the proper types and qualifications of 
workers. 
17.3.1.4.2.  Give particular attention to picking the proper category of manpower 
requirements.  Make sure that rated specialties are needed only when the duties 
involved clearly justify such action.  Officer requirements must be justified by 
responsibilities or duties specifically needing an officer. 
144 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
17.3.1.5.  Document the skill percentage requirement in matrix format for each step as 
displayed in Table 17.1.  Note:  Some steps can be done entirely by a given AFSC while 
the varying complexity of others may need more experience.  Show officer requirements 
in the company grade or field grade category. 
17.3.1.6.  Make sure the skill level percentages for each step equal 100.

17.3.2.  During work measurement, complete the following: 
17.3.2.1.  Determine the distribution of total step man-hours (direct and indirect) by AFS 
and skill level.  Compute this distribution by multiplying the total measured step man-hours 
by the corresponding percent shown in the matrix.  The result will be a similar matrix with 
man-hours instead of percentages as shown in Table 17.2.

17.3.2.4.  Analyze the resulting distribution and check computed requirements with the 
functional OPR.  Work center size and workload may need adjustments to the computed 
requirements.  Show any necessary changes as recommended fractional manpower 
requirements.  The total computed requirement must equal the total recommended 
requirement with minor variations because of rounding.  Any change from computed to 
recommended for a given AFS that is more than 0.5 of a whole person requirement must 
be documented to show rationale for the change. 
17.3.2.5.  Due to rounding, strict use of the fractional manpower breakpoints may yield 
more or less than the total work center requirement.  Together, with the functional OPR 
find the correct rounding point that maintains the total requirement.

CURRENCY REVIEW 
18.1.  General Concepts.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide information on how 
requirements determinant studies posted on the AFMAA SharePoint (or ANG/AFRC SharePoint 
equivalent) are reviewed for currency and how to revise those that need updating.  A CR guidebook 
and checklists are posted on the AFMAA SharePoint to assist with CR completion. 
18.1.1.  Improving Work Center Processes and Procedures.  Work with SSR and functional 
OPRs to improve existing processes and procedures.  Additionally, incorporating process 
improvements from initiatives developed throughout the Air Force is an integral part of model 
maintenance. 
18.1.2.  Updating Requirements Determinants.  Requirements determinants may become 
outdated when the extrapolation limits are exceeded or when there are changes in one or more 
of the following:  mission, organization, processes or procedures, and/or equipment.  Updates 
may require no measurement, partial measurement, or complete remeasurement of all activity 
responsibilities. 
18.2.  Reviewing the Requirements Determinant for Currency. 
18.2.1.  Once a requirements determinant is approved and posted, a CR is scheduled based on 
current policy.  At the initiation of the CR, a request for MAJCOM/A1M feedback is sent 
requesting their perspective of requirement determinant currency.  In addition, reach out to the 
functional OPR to begin the CR functional review. 
18.2.1.1.  Develop the CR using current policy and CR guidebook.  Complete the following 
steps: 
18.2.1.1.1.  Review available requirement determinant products to gain an 
understanding of the function’s workload, WLF(s) selected, how the equation was 
developed, what factors affect the equation(s), how WLF(s) relate to equation, etc. 
18.2.1.1.2.  Perform a review of AFIs, directives, and/or manuals listed in the report’s 
Glossary of References.  Review changes to functional directives to determine if SWD 
is still valid, reviewing organizational change proposals, reviewing variances, 
performing trend analysis on WLF and/or WUC volumes, obtaining and reviewing 
functional OPR policy or procedural letters, participating in functional OPR 
conferences, etc. 
18.2.1.1.3.  Pull a UMD baseline for analysis.  This will identify how many MAJCOMs 
have the function, where the function is located, standardization of the organizational 
structure, use of FAC and Manpower Standard Implementation (MSI) codes, AFSCs 
utilized by function, Manpower Table (MANTAB) limits, and other relevant 
information. 
18.2.1.2.  Work with SSR or a functional OPR to review the requirement determinant 
products to get a functional perspective of the currency.  Some of the questions to ask are: 
18.2.1.2.1.  Have approved mission changes occurred that altered the work being done 
at the time the requirements determinant was developed or updated? 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
147 
18.2.1.2.2.  Has policy and guidance changed causing procedures to change? 
18.2.1.2.3.  Is the activity still operating with the approved organizational structure that 
existed at the time of development or update?  If not, have the realigned responsibilities 
or workload made the requirements determinant invalid? 
18.2.1.2.4.  Is the SWD current?  Do changes significantly increase or decrease process 
time?  In some cases, minor changes can be made that do not affect process time or 
make the equation invalid. 
18.2.1.2.5.  Is the WLF and/or WUC definition still current and is the indicated 
workload source of count current?  Has it proved reliable? 
18.2.1.2.6.  Has experience shown the models to be reliable in predicting required 
manpower?  If not: 
18.2.1.2.6.1.  Has the requirements determinant been used to allocate manpower? 
18.2.1.2.6.2.  Are application points falling outside of extrapolation limits? 
18.2.1.3.  Work with MAJCOM/A1M to review the requirements determinant products for 
currency with MFMs and provide a perspective from a MAJCOM point of view.  Variances 
applicable to a single MAJCOM should be revalidated, approved by MAJCOM/A1Ms, and 
approved variances are sent to team lead for inclusion in update.  Chapter 4 provides more 
information on variance development. 
18.3.  Evaluating Currency Results. 
18.3.1.  Review all findings and recommendations provided to complete a CR report with 
recommendation.  The report should provide an assessment of the key elements (SWD, 
equations, WLFs, MANTAB, applicability, statement of conditions, etc.) that determines if the 
requirements determinant is current. 
18.3.1.1.  A CR has the following potential outcomes: 
18.3.1.1.1.  Administrative Update.  Current as written and only needs administrative 
updates. 
18.3.1.1.2.  Technical Update.  Some technical updates that were completed during CR 
effort or can be completed in a short duration (90 days or less) after CR is completed. 
18.3.1.1.3.  Re-study.  Has technical issues and needs to be restudied due to changes in 
mission organization, procedures or when extrapolations limits are being exceeded.  If 
the function needs to be restudied, the disposition of the posted requirements 
determinant needs to be determined. 
18.3.1.2.  If the requirements determinant is still usable even with updates needed, “For 
Reference Only” is added to title.  It can still be used with caution depending on errors 
(missing work, work not being done anymore, etc.). 
18.3.1.3.  If the requirements determinant is not valid, or totally outdated and not usable, 
“Obsolete” is added to title and it is available on the AFMAA SharePoint for informational 
purposes only. 
148 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
18.3.2.  Complete a CR package, which includes CR report and recommendation of posted 
requirements determinant, draft Interim Change with recommended updates and other 
documentation as needed supporting the recommendation.  Package is submitted to the 
AFMAA Commander (or appropriate A1M chain for the ANG and AFRC) for a decision. 
18.3.3.  After AFMAA Commander (or appropriate A1M chain for the ANG and AFRC) 
decision, the requirement determinant is posted and another CR or restudy is scheduled. 
18.4.  Changes Outside of a Currency Reviews.  MAJCOM/A1Ms or functional OPRs will 
submit updated requirement determinant changes for revision whenever circumstances warrant 
during the life of the requirements determinant.

Part 7 
WARTIME REQUIREMENTS DETERMINATION 
Chapter 19 
WARTIME REQUIREMENTS DETERMINATION 
19.1.  General Concepts.  The main goal of the wartime study process is to quantify the total 
force, Active and Air Reserve Component (ARC), deployment and critical home-station 
manpower requirements for wartime and low density/high demand functions. 
19.1.1.  The only difference between the wartime and traditional manpower requirements 
determination goal is wartime is total force focused.  Both wartime and traditional manpower 
requirements determination require a reliable, understandable, and defendable means of 
quantifying manpower requirements.  Wartime organizations do not have home-station 
assigned missions.  These organizations train and exercise their capabilities in-garrison in 
preparation for deployment.  Low density/high demand organizations do have home-station 
assigned missions; however, their wartime demand far exceeds their home-station demand.  
The requirements determinant development process for wartime functions and low 
density/high demand organizations only differs slightly from traditional organizations.  The 
difference is typically in the preliminary research phase and utilization of war planning 
methodology. 
19.1.2.  All wartime requirements determinants studies are completed by AFMAA’s Total 
Force Analytics Division’s wartime manpower analysts. 
19.2.  Preliminary Research. 
19.2.1.  Overview.  In addition to preliminary research steps discussed in Chapter 2, wartime 
requirements determination requires the understanding of strategic guidance directed by the 
Defense Planning Guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Strategic 
Capabilities Plan from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  These documents provide basic guidance for 
planning and programming the combat and support forces essential for attaining national 
security strategy.  The planning guidelines developed from this information describes the 
“worst case” scenario that include things like the conflict type, the magnitude or size of the 
conflict, the theaters where the conflict will occur, how fast the conflict will escalate, what the 
timing of major events in the conflict will be, what forces will be used, the conflict planning 
period, etc.  These requirements represent the use of a capability already available in the Air 
Force. 
19.2.2.  The Unit Type Code (UTC).  The basic manpower module used by a wartime 
manpower analyst is the UTC and the associated Manpower Force Element (MFE).  UTCs 
contain a statement of the workload this manpower element can support (e.g., 12 F-16 aircraft 
with a given flying program), the personnel needed, the skill set(s) personnel must have (i.e., 
AFSCs), and the logistics detail necessary to do the stated workload. 
19.2.3.  UTC Validation.  A UTC is a capability focused on accomplishing a specific mission.  
It consists of a Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) and a combination of two additional 
UTC elements; MFE and/or Logistics Detail (LOGDET).  The objective of the UTC validation 
150 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
process is to use MEP techniques to enhance the credibility and accuracy of deployment force 
manpower requirements.  The UTC validation process begins with preliminary research of 
historical deployment data.  This is to identify deployment trends if UTCs are rightsized or 
tailored.  A right-sized UTC provides a generic building block capability for ease of planning 
and enables optimal support to the combatant commander. 
19.2.3.1.  Utilization of these building blocks may task organize Air Expeditionary Task 
Forces in support of the DAF’s force presentation and generation policies.  The result of 
the validation process is the assignment of a code to each UTC in the Manpower Force 
Packaging (MANFOR) data file. 
19.2.3.2.  This code shows the validated UTC.  A UTC with the validation code is 
comparable to a work center covered by a manpower determinant.  A UTC without the 
validation code is comparable to a work center covered by a manpower guide. 
19.2.3.3.  The focal point of analysis during the validation process is the manpower and 
workload expressed in the UTC.  The relationship between these two factors is vital.  The 
relationship is critical because it provides the linkage needed to define or identify the man-
hours of work necessary to produce a military output, e.g., defining man-hours into the 
number of required spaces. 
19.2.3.3.1.  The workload represents a military capability (e.g., the capability to obtain 
a specified number of aircraft sorties). 
19.2.3.3.2.  Capabilities are either explicitly stated or implied (e.g., by the number of 
aircraft identified and planned sortie rates per aircraft). 
19.2.3.3.3.  The manpower required represents the spaces to fill with individuals from 
the total force (Active and ARC). 
19.3.  Critical Home-Station Requirements Determination.  Manpower requirements for 
critical home-station functions/missions are quantified using the exact same tools, techniques, and 
methodology as detailed in Parts 1-6 of this AFMAN.  Wartime organizations typically have home-
station support functions that facilitate their training, equipping, and exercising requirements.  Low 
density/high demand organizations have assigned home-station missions. 
19.4.  Wartime Manpower Requirements Determination.  This is a four-step process 
completed by the wartime manpower analysts in the Total Force Analytics Division of AFMAA. 
19.4.1.  Step 1.  Validate the UTC(s) as explained in paragraph 19.2.3. 
19.4.2.  Step 2.  Develop/validate the deployment concept of operations.  This step involves 
working with the functional community to create a UTC matrix that identifies the UTC(s), both 
numbers and combinations, required to support all levels of operational capability.  A key 
element in the creation of the matrix is the UTC MISCAP.  It is imperative that during UTC 
validation the MISCAP is very detailed, clear, and accurately defines the capability of each 
UTC. 
19.4.3.  Step 3.  Work with the functional community to apply the UTC matrix to the Defense 
Planning Guidance directed wartime scenario.  Utilize the Time Phased Force Deployment 
Document or war plan that identifies the beddown locations, assigned operational mission 
platforms, various threat levels, base size, projected service populations, and other factors 
based on the wartime scenario.  Use this war plan to apply the UTC matrix developed in Step 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
151 
2 to determine the UTC(s) required at each location.  When applying the UTC matrix, there 
may be a need to adjust the validated UTC(s) based on the requirements needed at each 
deployment location. 
19.4.3.1.  For example, the UTC MISCAP for a particular function is based on service 
population.  The validated UTCs’ required manpower is 3 for every increment of 750 
serviced population.  A deployment location in the plan has a service population of 2,473.  
Should this population drive a requirement of 9 (supports population of 2,250), 12 
(supports population of 3,000), or something in-between? 
19.4.3.2.  To determine the answer, perform an assessment to determine if a new/smaller 
UTC needs to be developed to support a smaller population size, or more detail in the UTC 
MISCAP is required to explain when a cutoff is exceeded what is the level reached before 
adding the additional 3 manpower requirements. 
19.4.4.  Step 4.  Aggregate the manpower requirements for all deployed locations to derive the 
total wartime manpower requirement. 
19.5.  Total Manpower Requirements.  Intuitively, the AFMD or MA identifies the manpower 
requirements for both home-station support/missions and wartime demand.  Use traditional 
equations, staffing patterns, post/position manning, etc., to calculate home-station manpower 
requirements.  There are no traditional means of calculating wartime manpower requirements, 
simply express them as whole numbers.  Often, the functional community requests that the AFMD 
or MA disperses the wartime requirements by installation/unit to reflect their enterprise 
deployment construct. 
19.6.  Review and Staffing.  The review and staffing process for wartime AFMDs and MAs is 
exactly the same as traditional home-station AFMDs and MAs.

LOGISTICS COMPOSITE MODELING 
Chapter 20 
LOGISTICS COMPOSITE MODEL 
20.1.  General Concepts.  LCOM is a determination of direct aircraft maintenance and munitions 
requirements using simulation software and associated tools.  LCOMs capture the variety, 
complexity, and uncertainty of maintenance environments; and are easily amendable for AoA.  
Maintenance and munitions management, supervision, and support are captured in other types of 
determinants. 
20.2.  Program Management Office. 
20.2.1.  AFMAA LCOM Program Management Responsibilities. 
20.2.1.1.  Integrate Air Force MEP policy and principles into developing, fielding, and 
maintaining the software, tools, policy, and guidance required to quickly and accurately 
quantify minimum and essential direct manpower requirements for those functions being 
modeled and simulated using the LCOM software. 
20.2.1.2.  Ensure LCOM product templates are technically and administratively compliant 
with applicable manpower instructions, manuals, and guides while clearly communicating 
senior leader expectations. 
20.2.1.3.  Mitigate errors and recognize patterns in the use of LCOM tools or techniques 
that reduce costs or improve the validity, timeliness, or effectiveness of LCOM products. 
20.2.1.4.  Provide a forum for involved program management, community information, 
training opportunities, and LCOM software requirements and modifications. 
20.2.2.  Training Oversight Responsibilities. 
20.2.2.1.  Direct, coordinate, oversee, and report highly complex projects; define scope, 
priority, and team; provide technical direction and training in project management, team

documented, and results are logical. 
20.2.2.5.  Provide LCOM product and process briefings. 
20.2.3.  Operations Analysis Responsibilities. 
20.2.3.1.  Advise and propose options and innovative solutions to difficult problems that is 
actionable, relevant, and timely in responsible areas. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
153 
20.2.3.2.  Research, create, and deliver senior level presentations and products that are 
technically accurate, relevant, timely, and actionable; message usually aligned with 
established agency strategy and objectives. 
20.2.3.3.  Analyze and improve the effectiveness of LCOM program, processes, and 
products through continuous improvement and innovation (CI2), benchmarking, problem 
solving, and analysis. 
20.2.3.4.  Evaluate and test all LCOM software modifications to determine benefit of 
change and potential impact on determining and/or validating manpower requirements. 
20.3.  Software Tools. 
20.3.1.  The LCOM Data Analysis Processing Tool (LDAPT) is an OA software used for 
maintenance data summarization, field validation, audit analysis, and input database creation. 
20.3.2.  The LCOM Analysis Tool Kit (ATK) is a comprehensive simulation software used to 
modify input databases, run simulations, optimize resources, and provide statistical reports for 
analysis.  The software allows relationship analysis of resources (manpower, parts, support 
equipment, facilities) with each other and their impact to aircraft sortie generation capability.    
The detailed nature of LCOM and its sensitivity to input data changes makes it a critical tool 
essential for weapon system acquisition and sustainment; and in validating proposals affecting 
reliability and maintainability improvements or modifications. 
20.3.3.  Munitions Assessment LCOM Tool (MALT) is a software application with scenario-
based interface that uses standardized munitions networks to create an input database, run 
simulations, and produce a manpower requirement report. 
20.4.  Study Deliverables. 
20.4.1.  LCOM Scenario.  States study assumptions, deliverables, participants, operating 
parameters, maintenance parameters and functional statements.  It is developed by the study 
team in collaboration with functional authorities and coordinated with the appropriate logistics, 
operations, and plans staff functional representatives to assure operational and maintenance 
concepts are accurately depicted. 
20.4.2.  LCOM Report.  Contains an executive summary with impact analysis summary, study 
background, LCOM process description, and application summary.  When applicable, it 
provides a previous to new model functional comparison to support the analysis.  It contains a 
trial application workbook containing each applicable location using UMD baseline.  Provides 
part-time and full-time ARC contributions within the trial applications and executive summary. 
20.4.3.  LCOM.  Establishes the maintenance and munitions manpower requirements to 
support approved scenario objectives.  It consists of application instructions, statement of 
conditions, manpower requirement tables, grade factors, functional statements, UTC 
requirements, and any additionally requested modeling points. 
20.4.4.  LCOM Analysis of Alternatives. 
20.4.4.1.  An AoA provides decision makers with reliable, objective maintenance and 
munitions manpower assessments in response to varying levels of change (alternatives).  
AoAs provide comparative manpower requirement data to assess the impact of change to 
a baseline; this baseline is typically the current LCOM. 
154 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
20.4.4.2.  AoA requests include modification of functional work, change of scenario 
performance objectives, maintenance policy adjustments, tuning of failure data, and new 
model creation from engineering estimates. 
20.5.  Study Process. 
20.5.1.  Announcement.  Signals the start of the LCOM process, is sent out to applicable 
MAJCOMs, the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower, and Personnel (AF/A1) and the 
Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection (AF/A4), and 
requests key points of contact. 
20.5.2.  Project Design.  Consists of preliminary research to determine what information is 
needed to design and conduct the LCOM.  It requires comprehensive research via UMD 
analysis, previous study review, documentation examination, preliminary surveys, and 
functional meetings on the following categories: 
20.5.2.1.  Aircraft force structure. 
20.5.2.2.  Missions. 
20.5.2.3.  Organizational structure. 
20.5.2.4.  Maintenance metrics. 
20.5.2.5.  Maintenance and munitions procedures. 
20.5.2.6.  Special work requirements. 
20.5.2.7.  Required locations. 
20.5.3.  Work Data Collection. 
20.5.3.1.  Measurement and data collection are accomplished based on project design.  All 
data is examined to ensure it is complete, accurate, and logical.  Historical workload data 
and associated man-hours may not show the function’s real needs.  Over- or under-manning 
affects level of effort and historical workload production level.  A minimum of twelve 
months of maintenance data documentation is analyzed for inconsistencies in crew sizes, 
AFSCs, and task times as compared against known task profiles.  Additionally, this data is 
used in conjunction with the previous study as a baseline for an on-site audit. 
20.5.3.2.  Maintenance data records, process action task times, frequencies, and required 
crew sizes are validated with qualified maintenance technicians at functionally selected 
locations using OA. 
20.5.3.3.  Maintenance manpower requirements are based on workload for inspections, 
unscheduled maintenance (aircraft maintainability), support equipment, and directed shop 
tasks.  Maintenance action rates (expressed as mean sorties between maintenance actions) 
are developed using previous study, maintenance data documentation records, and 
maintenance personnel interviews.  Maintenance task times include all work from job 
dispatch to job completion, to include equipment set-up, scheduled or unscheduled tasks 
including facilitate other maintenance actions, equipment tear down, annotation of aircraft 
forms, and updating the Maintenance Information System (MIS), as appropriate.  Support 
equipment maintenance, reconfiguration, major maintenance processes, time change items, 
and overall aircraft maintenance flow are collected.  Maintenance task times do not include 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
155 
idle time such as waiting for aerospace ground equipment, tow clearance, fuel delivery, 
etc. 
20.5.3.4.  Distinct maintenance policies for repair centers (e.g., avionics, hydraulics, and 
engines), inspection sections, multi-leg missions, etc. must be captured and standardized, 
as applicable. 
20.5.4.  Scenario.  From the culmination of project design and work data collection, a clear and 
comprehensive LCOM Scenario is developed to guide accomplishment of study objectives.  
This document incorporates data collected and functional decisions made during these 
processes. 
20.5.5.  Model Development. 
20.5.5.1.  The model is based upon the scenario and audit data.  It contains all aircraft, 
parts, and support equipment repair networks necessary to support aircraft.  It also includes 
major inspection and repair process flow networks with linkages back to mission 
generation networks. 
20.5.5.2.  Models reflect missions within a continuous range of military operations from 
testing through major operations.  Unless specifically waivered by the Air Force 
Directorate of Manpower Organization and Resources (AF/A1M), simultaneous models 
are built to address all operations for applicable units. 
20.5.5.3.  Discrete aircraft mission scheduling may be required to replicate the way the 
annual Flying Hour Program (FHP) is executed (to include attrition overhead requirements, 
flying hour restrictions, TDYs, maintenance recovery teams, readiness exercises, surges, 
and other deviations) and is determined on an as-needed basis. 
20.5.5.4.  Minimum Essential Subsystem Listing (MESL) is utilized to determine mission 
limiting criteria based on functionality and serviceability of aircraft systems.  The key is to 
select aircraft that maintenance personnel can return to mission capable status the quickest.  
The MESL is not necessarily the final determinant of whether an aircraft can be utilized, 
but it must be consulted as the basis for reporting aircraft status.  LCOM ATK is capable 
of simulating MESL failures separately from delayed discrepancies.  LCOM models must 
be networked to reflect appropriate MESL usage and defined within the LCOM scenario. 
20.5.5.5.  Maintenance task cross-utilization (general AFSC substitution) is used for the 
shared flightline tasks of aircraft tow, aircraft refuel, aircraft defuel, aircraft jacking, and 
aircraft wash.  Specialized utilization such as the Multi-Capable Airmen (MCA) initiative 
is designed to effectively execute Agile Combat Employment (ACE) maneuver while 
deployed and is not modeled unless requested and approved within the LCOM scenario. 
20.5.5.6.  A single OJT/upgrade training accounting process is used to standardize LCOM 
accounting for 3-level impacts to the simulated manpower requirement and derive a more 
accurate maintenance model.  This method equally applies to all specialties in the model.  
LCOM ATK simulates with a probability that OJT is performed on a task, increases the 
time by a percentage and increases crew size if the crew size is one.  The probability of 
occurrence is determined from the most accurate data source of 3-skill levels for units under 
study.  The task time percentage increase uses the Total Force Indicator Round Table 
approved factor of 40 percent until otherwise rescinded.  Task crew sizes of less than two 
156 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
have a trainer position added for training to occur or if the normal crew size would not be 
sufficient to properly train.  The OJT task pool includes all work except high repetition 
general tasks (e.g., tows, engine runs, wash, jacking, Joint Oil Analysis Program, launch, 
recovery, refuel, defuel, and loading). 
20.5.5.7.  Due to the uneven nature of Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) issuance 
and in conjunction with functional community perspective, workload associated with 
TCTOs is not currently included in the model.  However, TCTO data is collected and 
documented in a “historical capacity” to determine the impact this type of maintenance 
plays in day-to-day functioning to be revalidated for inclusion in future studies. 
20.5.5.8.  Aircraft parts cannibalization actions may be necessary when a condition 
prevents the accomplishment of a mission, and the required assets are not immediately 
available from supply.  Maintenance management cannibalization decisions for the 
expenditure of man-hours and potential damage to equipment are weighed against the 
expected benefit.  Cannibalization actions are a documented and accepted practice and is 
integrated into the models based on valid historical maintenance data documentation. 
20.5.5.9.  End of runway (EOR) activities are included in the simulation model and are 
based on specified airframe inspection requirements.  Methodology for simulation is to 
insert EOR activities prior to and after sortie task, if applicable.  EOR is annotated within 
the scenario to include crew composition. 
20.5.5.10.  Alert is considered when tasked by higher headquarters.  This mission is defined 
in the scenario or AoA with quantity of aircraft, within what operations alert is applicable, 
and minimum standby crews to perform alert tasks.  When modeling alert with other 
operations for the same unit, remove alert aircraft leaving less aircraft to accomplish a 
reduced flying goal.  Add scenario-defined standby alert crew positions to the simulated 
manpower resources for each function prior to applying MAF. 
20.5.6.  Simulation and Analysis. 
20.5.6.1.  Models are first set up to run a “wide-open” analysis (unlimited parts and 
manpower resources).  This analysis verifies the model is operating correctly within 
scenario parameters and sets the baseline for all follow-on analyses.  This debugging 
process checks for loops, blocks, unexpected network flow, and incorrect failure counts.  
Also, during this process, the study lead examines for common maintenance logic and 
scenario agreement. 
20.5.6.2.  Only long-term average behavior of the model is analyzed.  This is reached when 
simulation model variables reach a state of equilibrium.  This is the point when variables 
(e.g., Total Non-Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS), sortie rate, manpower resource 
utilization rate) converge to approximately the same distribution.  For this analysis, the 
model is run for a 182-day warm-up period with 364 continuous operating days following 
to allow all maintenance processes opportunity to occur.  Additionally, 30 independent 
trials are ran then merged and analyzed to ensure 95 percent of data points are within 
scenario performance measures.  Each trial uses a different random number seed generator 
for each failure clock, inspection, etc., creating a different starting point.  Length of 
simulation and number of trials remains constant throughout the analysis process. 
20.5.6.3.  Model input resources (parts and manpower) are constrained by the analyst. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
157 
20.5.6.3.1.  Parts are reduced in the model to achieve the scenario TNMCS rate.  This 
puts a sortie generation strain on the model to mimic aircraft maintenance dynamics. 
20.5.6.3.2.  Next, manpower is optimized to concurrently attain scenario required 
sorties and TNMCS rate while not exceeding Maintenance Indirect Factor (MIF) 
maximum utilization rates. 
20.5.6.3.3.  Each function is analyzed to ensure minimum crew size is met on at least 
one shift.  The maximum crew size for any task in a function establishes the 
post/position manpower resources needed for at least one shift in that function.  Other 
shifts may have less than minimum crew if workload can be deferred without a negative 
impact on sortie production. 
20.5.6.3.4.  Optimized results represent validated workload including indirect work, 
safety requirements, and PF&D.  Workload transfer (backorder leveling) and shift 
scheduling is used during optimization to reduce standby time.  A final optimized 
model results in the simulated manpower resources needed to achieve scenario 
objectives, whether fully utilized or not. 
20.5.6.4.  LCOM core model is compared to previous model, as applicable.  This 
comparative analysis is the basis for the LCOM report executive summary and impact 
explanations. 
20.5.6.5.  The MAF is used to quantify number of FTEs for a given function. 
20.5.6.6.  The LCOM requirement is based on the most demanding scenario by function; 
therefore, the results may be comprised of more than one scenario operation within a 
specified location.  This is the final requirement to use for grade breakouts. 
20.5.6.7.  Required skills are determined by analyzing task level workload, the experience 
and ability to complete the tasks, and the minimum requirements to cover multi-shift 
operations.  Skills are translated into grades using only production level (TSgt–A1C) 
grades.

INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING 
The following section includes techniques that serve as the foundational basis of today’s 
Management Engineering Program.  These techniques are labor intensive and may not be the most 
appropriate measurement methodology for today’s environment. 
Chapter 21 
TIME STUDY 
21.1.  General Concepts.  Time study is a work measurement method where the analyst uses a 
stopwatch to record the time a worker takes to do each element of an operation in a specified way.  
This technique is used to measure operations that are repetitive, of relatively short duration, and 
accomplished at one work station.  Leveled time is an average time adjusted to reflect 
differentiating factors in operator performance, such as effort, skill, and work conditions.  Leveled 
time is computed by applying a leveling factor (reference Chapter 22, paragraph 22.2.3) to the 
productive time.  The leveled time is multiplied by an allowance factor to determine the elemental 
allowed time.  The total of the elemental allowed times then gives the ST for the operation.  The 
cost of performing a time study is higher than other work measurement techniques; however, it is 
the most accurate means to determine STs. 
21.1.1.  Purposes of Time Study. 
21.1.1.1.  To analyze the operations and job conditions to improve existing methods. 
21.1.1.2.  To increase the effectiveness of worker effort by using only necessary motions. 
21.1.1.3.  To establish standard conditions for an efficient operation. 
21.1.1.4.  To establish consistent and fair standards of performance. 
21.1.1.5.  To furnish reliable data for use in constructing man-hour equations. 
21.1.2.  Additional Uses.  Time study is also used to develop elemental standard data for use 
in synthesizing time standards for operations containing the same elements in different 
combinations.  This eliminates the need for re-measurement. 
21.1.3.  Prerequisites for Time Study.  Very few situations in the Air Force meet the time study 
prerequisites of being both highly standardized and repetitive.  If these prerequisites are not 
met, then this method is not to be used. 
21.1.4.  Verification of the SWD.  Time study, in most cases, is neither a practical nor an 
economical method to use to develop an entire manpower determinant within most Air Force 
functions.  However, when this measurement method is selected (generally for some portions 
of the SWD) the following procedures are necessary: 
21.1.4.1.  Verify the portion of the SWD to be time studied is properly designed.  Each 
process activity is identified in the sequence of performance with definite beginning and 
ending points. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
159 
21.1.4.2.  Ensure all processes are in-line with current governing directives and local 
performance procedures.  Significant differences from location-to-location may cause 
variation in timing and result in inaccurate values.  Resolve any differences prior to 
beginning timing operations. 
21.2.  Procedures for Conducting a Time Study.  Establish a system to record daily work counts.  
If the work center activities do not allow this to be done, record the WU count as the work is 
finished.  Production reports may be used but collect sufficient data to make valid comparisons 
and to set an average workload level. 
21.2.1.  Find the time study method that best fits the work situation to accurately measure the 
various steps.  Snapback and continuous are two basic methods of reading a watch when doing 
a time study.  Each of these basic methods is addressed separately below. 
21.2.2.  In the snapback (repetitive) method, record a reading after timing each element, and 
then reset the watch back to zero. 
21.2.2.1.  Advantages of this method are:  (1) it eliminates the need for making subtractions 
to find element time and (2) it also facilitates rapid analysis of variations in readings for 
each element per cycle. 
21.2.2.2.  Disadvantages of this method are:  (1) it does not present a clear picture of the 
sequence in which the elements were done and (2) the extent and nature of foreign elements 
upon occurrence are not always recorded.  In addition, unavoidable errors occur due to the 
time needed to reset the watch back to zero. 
21.2.3.  In the continuous method, the watch runs continuously from the beginning to the end 
of the process being measured.  Record the time at the end of each element. 
21.2.3.1.  An advantage of this method is every event that occurs is recorded and is 
traceable back to the actual sequence of occurrence.  This makes it easy to handle elements 
occurring out of normal sequence. 
21.2.3.2.  The disadvantage of this method is additional time is needed to develop the 
elemental time. 
21.2.4.  The use of either the snapback or continuous method is at the discretion of the analyst.  
The various characteristics contributing to the use of each method are displayed in Table 21.1 
and should be taken into account when selecting a particular timing method.  For example, 
when checking a job situation to be timed, use Table 21.1 to select a timing method.  If at least 
six job situation attributes are identified in a timing method, then that method should be 
favorably considered for use.

21.2.5.  When identifying elements to be timed, ensure the elements are recognizable and have 
obvious beginning and ending points.  Clear beginning and ending points make the time study 
process easier.  Make a sketch showing the equipment used, flow of work, significant distances 
traveled by the operator, and unusual working conditions. 
21.2.6.  Take readings for five to 20 cycles to find the number of good readings needed.  Pace 
rate each timed element.  Compare the observed pace (speed) of work done to the normal time 
(NT).  See Chapter 22 for more details on pace rating. 
21.3.  Determining Sample Size.  Find the required number of readings after measuring a 
relatively small number of cycles.  The initial cycle readings may be included as part of the 
required total needed.  Observe complete cycles of an operation and take readings on all elements 
of the cycle.  The number of cycle readings needed is the highest number necessary for any one 
element.  Table 21.2 provides instructions and an example of how to compute the number of 
samples needed.  For the particular example shown in Table 21.2., a 95 percent statistical 
confidence with a +/-5 percent relative accuracy is desired with 25 time study samples given.

THE PACE (PERFORMANCE) RATING SYSTEM 
22.1.  General Concepts.  In pace rating, compare the observed pace, or speed, of work 
performance to a predetermined value of normal pace. 
22.1.1.  Consider the difficulty of each step and adjust to allow for inherent job difficulties.  
Use unity (1.00) as the numerical value for the normal pace and give all ratings a value in 
relation to 1.00 or 100 percent of normal pace. 
22.1.2.  Observed (or measured) time is adjusted by the pace rating to determine NT.  Normal 
hand speed used in the Air Force MEP is determined as the hand speed required to deal a deck 
of cards in four even piles in 30 seconds (see paragraph 22.2.8.).  Normal walking speed used 
in the Air Force MEP is three miles per hour walking across a flat surface (see paragraph 
22.2.10.). 
22.2.  Using Pace (or Performance) Rating. 
22.2.1.  Overview.  The requirements determination process utilizes the practice of figuring 
the pace at which work is accomplished.  The terms pace rating and performance rating are 
used interchangeably.  Using the average pace ratings for individual workers results in a 
leveling factor that is applied to productive time.  Leveling is limited to the observed activity. 
22.2.2.  Techniques Utilizing Pace Rating.  Pace rating is used only in WS (see Chapter 24), 
time study (see Chapter 21), or good operator timing (see Chapter 5).  Time values coming 
from the directed frequency, historical records, or technical estimate methods are not pace-
rated (or leveled). 
22.2.3.  Processes Incompatible with Pace Rating.  The leveling factor is used to adjust 
productive time to a norm.  Some processes do not lend themselves to pace rating.  For 
example, supervision and mental work.  For these activities, use a pace rating or leveling factor 
of 1.00. 
22.2.4.  Training for Pace Rating.  Analysts should be proficient with rating and familiar with 
the job to effectively pace rate.  Training is needed prior to requirements determination efforts 
where pace rating is required.  Avoid using pre-established ranges for average leveling factors 
because these ranges bias the value of leveling. 
22.2.5.  Number of Ratings Required.  The number of ratings needed varies with the work 
measurement method used. 
22.2.5.1.  Time study and good operator timing technique will rate each timed element. 
22.2.5.2.  WS will rate a minimum of 25 percent of the observations of each worker. 
22.2.6.  Computing an Average Pace Rating.  Pace rating results in a number of separate ratings 
used to figure the overall leveling factor.  At the end of the study, find the average of these 
ratings (leveling factor) and use this average to compute leveled time.  The example in Table 
22.1 shows the computation of a leveling factor from six separate pace rating values.

22.2.7.  Creating Pace Rater Proficiency.  Training the analyst to develop a “mental image” of 
a normal pace and how to rate in a consistent manner is critical.  The analyst needs to have 
many images of normal since a wide variety of jobs are studied.  This makes the need for 
training greater and the training more difficult.  While it is just about impossible to give the 
analyst every possible “norm” that may be found, there are some point-of-departure norms that 
can be used. 
22.2.8.  Hand Speed Pace Rating Practice.  The following exercise is suggested to create pace 
rater proficiency: 
22.2.8.1.  Deal 52 playing cards in 4 piles in 30 seconds (0.50 min).  To deal the cards, 
hold the deck in the left hand and with the thumb, take off and move the top card each time.  
With the right hand, grasp the pre-positioned corner of the top card between the thumb and 
first finger, carry it to the correct pile, release it, and bring the hand back to the pack.  Form 
the four piles in front of the dealer and the other three corners of a one-foot square.  This 
training method needs at least three people; the trainee, the card dealer, and a person with 
a stopwatch.  The dealer deals the cards, the person with the stopwatch times the operation, 
and the trainee rates the operation.  The true rating is found by dividing the known NT 
(0.50 min) by the stopwatch reading.  For example: 
 
22.2.8.2.  Comparing the true rating with those given by the trainee is a good way to show 
where the trainee is rating in relation to the actual pace of the dealer. 
22.2.9.  Walking Speed Pace Rating Practice.  The Air Force MEP standard for walking speed 
is 3 miles per hour on a flat surface.  To become proficient at pace rating walking speeds, 
analysts may view pace rating tapes or pace rate fellow workers across a known distance.  This 
training routine, like hand speed, also takes three MEP analysts to perform:  one to perform 
the practice pace rating, one to act as the walker, and another to time the walker using a time 
device.  As the practice pace rating is taken of the walker across a known distance, the timer 
records the time from start to crossing the line.  With the time known, the actual rate (in miles 
per hour) can be determined and a comparison of pace rating and actual calculated pace can be 
determined. 
164 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
22.2.10.  Determining NT. 
22.2.10.1.  Once the analyst has measured a process and performed the pace rating, NT can 
be computed.  For example, if a process has a measured time of 10 min with a pace rating 
of 125 percent of normal pace, then the NT is calculated as: 
NT = Measured Time x Pace Rating = 10 x 1.25 = 12.5 min of NT 
22.2.10.2.  Likewise, if the pace rating had been determined to be 80 percent, then the 
calculations would be: 
NT = Measured Time x Pace Rating = 10 x 0.80 = 8 min of NT 
22.2.10.3.  Thus, both above and below average normal pace observations can be estimated 
to determine the NT.

Chapter 23 
DETERMINING PERSONAL, FATIGUE, AND DELAY ALLOWANCES 
23.1.  General Concepts.  Personal, Fatigue, and Delay allowances are added to Normal Times to 
create Standard Time when time study, good operator timing, or WS are the measurement 
techniques.  Allowances add time to account for personal human needs, the external and 
operational environment, and the nature of the work. 
23.1.1.  Do not add PF&D allowances to the OA techniques of technical estimate and historical 
record.  When directed requirements technique is used for PAT, PF&D allowances may be 
added; but do not add PF&D allowances for directed requirements when whole manpower 
positions are directed, e.g., First Sergeant position in a squadron.  Add PF&D allowances for 
PATs determined via good operator timing. 
23.1.2.  Personal allowances take into account time given for personal breaks, e.g., rest room 
breaks.  Do not confuse personal time with annual or sick leave, or any other factor already 
considered in the NAT of the monthly MAF. 
23.1.3.  Fatigue allowances recognize the limitation of the human condition and take into 
account the time a worker needs to rest and recuperate due to the physical and mental demands 
of the job. 
23.1.4.  Delays that are unavoidable and cause the worker to stop immediate operations, but 
also prevents the worker from doing other productive work, should also be considered, and 
added to NT.  Do not credit idle time that is truly avoidable, i.e., the worker may have been 
stopped at the immediate activity, but he or she can begin working on other productive work 
in the meantime. 
23.1.5.  At the discretion of the analyst, a standard PF&D allowance can be used for the entire 
work center or each activity in a SWD.  However, when specific activities within a single SWD 
represent considerably different nature of the work or under significantly different work 
conditions, then PF&D allowances should be determined and applied at the activity level. 
23.1.6.  The MEP treats time for work center clean-up as part of an IAF.  Therefore, do not 
add work center clean-up time to the PF&D allowance. 
23.1.7.  Standard Time is calculated by multiplying the computed PF&D allowances 
(expressed as the allowance factor) by an activity’s NT, such that: 
ST = NT x Allowance Factor 
Note:  Recall NT is the measured (i.e., observed) time that has been adjusted by a pace rating or 
leveling factor. 
23.1.8.  To compute the PF&D allowance factor, use the following equation: 
 
23.1.8.1.  Where the PF&D allowances as depicted are expressed as a percentage of the 
total workday.  For example, to compute the allowance factor for 30 min per 8-hour duty 
day for PF&D: 
166 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
 
23.1.8.2.  Where 480 equals the number of min in an 8-hour duty day.  Thus, the allowance 
factor would equal: 
 
23.1.9.  Continuing, if the NT of an activity was measured at 12 min, then to determine the ST 
(the final manpower credit the DAF would pay for this activity) for an allowed PF&D time of 
30 min per duty day as in the example above, then: 
ST = NT x Allowance Factor = 12 x 1.067 = 12.80 min 
23.2.  Determining PF&D Allowances. 
23.2.1.  Overview.  Based on the characteristics of the function being studied, PF&D 
allowances can be determined either by: 
23.2.1.1.  Measuring the allowances via a work measurement technique, e.g., good 
operator timing. 
23.2.1.2.  A combination of measured and predetermined allowance factors. 
23.2.2.  Using Predetermined Allowance Factors.  The base personal (i.e., minimum) 
allowance factor is 1.067 (i.e., 30 min per 8-hour duty day).  If DAF policy for a given work 
center directs longer base PF&D allowance, annotate the authority source, and recompute the 
base PF&D allowance.  Use Table 23.1 to add to the base personal allowance factor (as a 
percentage) if applicable: 
Table 23.1.  Allowed Adjustments for Base Personal Allowance.

most of the time, e.g., proximity to hot objects, continuous exposure to 
disagreeable odors and fumes, or to excessive temperature fluctuations.

23.2.3.  Calculating Allowances for Fatigue.  Fatigue allowance can be categorized as physical 
or mental fatigue. 
23.2.3.1.  Physical Fatigue for Lifting Objects.  When a work center’s activities involve the 
lifting of objects, consider the following conditions: 
23.2.3.1.1.  The average weight handled per worker. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
167 
23.2.3.1.2.  Percent of time for the defined activity actually under load. 
23.2.3.1.3.  The height the load is manually lifted (for the most likely situation). 
23.2.3.1.4.  The basic percentages for fatigue allowances in Table 23.2 are based on 
the effective net weight of the object(s) that are placed at a height somewhere between 
the worker’s chest and the floor.  Table 23.2 also applies when sliding or rolling the 
work objects along a flat surface.

X* = Exceeds ergonomic safety-redesign activity to lower weight or time spent lifting. 
23.2.3.2.  Physical Fatigue Allowance for Worker Position.  Consider the position(s) the 
worker normally assumes to perform the operation.  Choose the mostly likely scenario from 
Table 23.3. 
Table 23.3.  Fatigue Delay for Worker Position. 
When the normal worker position is:

23.2.3.3.  Mental Fatigue Allowance due to Nature of the Work.  This considers the 
concentration necessary to perform the activity and the amount of variety in the activities.  
Use Table 23.4 as a reference.

23.2.3.4.  Mental Fatigue for Lighting.  In addition to mental fatigue due to nature of the 
work, typical lighting in terms of the amount of light on the work surface, the fineness of 
details, the amount of glare on the work surface, and rapid changing or "hypnotic" effect 
of the work should also be considered.  Use Table 23.5 as a reference. 
Table 23.5.  Consideration for Mental Fatigue Allowance, Lighting. 
If the work involves either: 
then the percent to 
add to mental fatigue 
for lighting is: 
- 
Continual glare on work areas 
- 
Work requiring constant change in light on work area 
2 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024

- 
Less than 75-foot candle power on work surface for normal 
job 
- 
Less than 125-foot candle power on work surface for detailed 
work 
23.2.3.5.  Mental Fatigue for Noise.  Consider the general noise of the work areas as well 
as any annoying, sharp, staccato, or intermittent noises occurring during more than 50 
percent of the workday.  If ear plugs, noise cancelling headphones, or earmuffs are required 
to be worn, the protective sound device’s noise reduction effect is considered using the 
allowance in Table 23.6. 
Table 23.6.  Consideration for Mental Fatigue Allowance, Noise. 
When the work environment’s noise level is: 
then the percent to 
add to mental fatigue 
for noise is: 
Constant, loud noises, such as in machine shops, etc. (over 60 
decibels) 
1 
Average constant noise level but with loud, sharp, intermittent, or 
staccato noise such as nearby riveters, punch presses, aircraft engine 
starts, auxiliary power units, e.g., flight line or machine shop

23.2.3.6.  Mental Fatigue for Wear of PPE.  Consider the mental fatigue resulting from 
wearing PPE during work, as depicted in Table 23.7. 
Table 23.7.  Consideration for Mental Fatigue Allowance, Wear of PPE. 
When the PPE involves: 
when the percent to add for mental fatigue 
for wear of PPE is:

23.2.4.  Allowances for Unavoidable Delay. 
23.2.4.1.  Unavoidable Delay.  An unavoidable delay is just that, unavoidable.  If a worker 
can be doing any other productive work instead of waiting for the task at hand, the reason 
for delay cannot be considered unavoidable. 
23.2.4.2.  Base Allowance for Unavoidable Delay.  A predetermined base allowance for 
delay can be estimated based upon the need for close coordination between defined 
activities.  Use Table 23.8 as a reference.  Note:  Consult the SWD(s) to ensure 
understanding of the process flow and the inter-related nature of specific activities. 
23.2.4.3.  Other unavoidable delay situations can be included once measured and 
computed.

When the activities in a process are: 
then the base allowance 
for unavoidable delay is: 
Isolated, but requires some coordination with adjacent activities

2 
23.3.  Application of the Allowance Factors.  These tables normally provide realistic PF&D 
allowances.  However, in some situations, using these predetermined factors results in a total 
allowance ≥ 100 which yields a zero or negative denominator in the allowance factor formula.  
Assuming the PF&D allowances have been correctly characterized and computed, when this 
situation occurs, reshape SWD activities so realistic PF&D allowances are obtained. 
23.3.1.  Suppose a work center has the following PF&D allowances: 
23.3.1.1.  Allows two, 15-minute personal breaks. 
23.3.1.2.  Works under slightly disagreeable working conditions. 
23.3.1.3.  For this specific activity, requires grasping an 8-pound object 30 percent of total 
activity time and placing it above chest level. 
23.3.1.4.  Lighting is considered adequate without glare and noise levels are under 60 
decibels. 
23.3.1.5.  Requires cross checking parts number with a shipping document. 
23.3.1.6.  Requires the wear of rubber boots PPE. 
23.3.1.7.  Requires some coordination with adjacent activities.

WORK SAMPLING 
24.1.  General Concepts.  Work sampling is considered an engineered work measurement method 
based on the principle that random samples taken from a large group tend to keep the same 
distribution characteristics as the group.  Conclusions are drawn about the population based on the 
sample recorded.  The WS method relies heavily on analysts to visually observe the work and 
collect accurate samples and workload information.  The WS method defines processes, makes 
observations, computes percentage of occurrence for each process, and applies these percentages 
to man-hours sampled. 
24.2.  Applying Work Sampling.  WS is commonly used to determine equipment utilization, 
analyze work distribution, conduct methods improvement efforts, and compute and verify PF&D 
allowances. 
24.2.1.  WS is very effective and an appropriate work measurement technique when a work 
center’s workload is: 
24.2.1.1.  Non-repetitive or irregular work. 
24.2.1.2.  Many different categories of work. 
24.2.1.3.  Performed by many workers in a relatively small area when activities can be 
grouped for simultaneous observations. 
24.2.2.  Take care when identifying work centers to be sampled.  Historically, work centers 
requiring product analysis, closed-session counseling, or creative thinking have been difficult, 
to nearly impossible, to sample.  For these work centers, consider using productive and 
nonproductive sampling.  Some office work is difficult to quantify by WS because the work is 
not cyclical or is completed over a long period of time.  Also, work cycles may be variable 
because of the many different products. 
24.3.  Types of Work Sampling Efforts.  WS efforts can be designed to be either productive or 
nonproductive (Level I), or at the process level (Level II). 
24.3.1.  Level I.  In Level I WS efforts, samples are broadly classified as productive, 
nonproductive, nonavailable, and lunch.  Sample nonproductive categories, such as PF&D and 
idle time, at the category level since these categories are easily distinguishable.  This provides 
information to support the allowance factor and to brief the OPR. 
24.3.1.1.  To breakout Level I by process category, use percentage estimates to distribute 
productive time (direct and indirect) into processes.  However, the effort’s work 
measurement data can no longer be considered derived via an engineered work 
measurement technique with this approach. 
24.3.1.2.  Derive these percentage estimates through consultation with key personnel and 
the work center supervisor.  Get estimates from several work center personnel to improve 
the reliability of process distribution.  Ensure percentage estimates equal 100 percent. 
24.3.1.3.  Table 24.1  shows an example of estimated process distribution percentages.  
Estimates were obtained from the both the work center supervisor, estimate A, and the 
172 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
foreman, estimate B.  The percent of total column is used to distribute the productive direct 
time into processes.

24.3.2.  Level II.  Level II WS efforts are measured at the process level.  In most WS efforts, 
it is easy to distinguish between productive and nonproductive samples.  The distinction 
between productive direct and productive indirect is more difficult.  For example, the 
productive direct process of management is similar to the productive indirect processes of 
supervision and administration when observed at the activity level of accomplishment.  If a 
sample is misclassified as direct when it is really indirect, there is no change to total productive 
time. 
24.3.2.1.  Because measured indirect time is based on actual observations, do not use an 
IAF with Level II WS efforts.  In this case, application of an IAF double counts indirect 
time. 
24.3.2.2.  Productive direct time is sampled at Level I and prorated by percentages to get 
direct process and indirect category time. 
24.3.2.3.  Productive indirect time is sampled at Level II (process level). 
24.3.3.  Economic Desirability.  WS’s economic desirability increases with the number of 
workers being sampled.  Measure a minimum of five workers; however, those being sampled 
may be assigned to more than one work center.  When several input points have four or less 
workers to be measured, it is not economical to conduct a WS effort.  Generally, measure a 
work center with two or less workers by OA unless it is necessary to observe standby time or 
the need for an assistant. 
24.3.4.  Measurement.  The work force being measured should consist of personnel who spend 
most available time in a place which permits observation of work.  Account for work done 
away from the immediate work center for extended periods of time as follows: 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
173 
24.3.4.1.  Observe the worker at the out-of-area location. 
24.3.4.2.  If it is not feasible to observe the worker, sample as out-of-area and OA this time.  
Account for out-of-area samples by applicable process.  For multi-location determinants, 
study teams furnish guidance for treatment of these samples if applicable. 
24.3.4.3.  Do not plan for more observations than an analyst can accomplish in a reasonable 
period.  Assigning too many personnel or work centers may not allow timely observations 
and may bias the sampling data.  Conversely, assigning too few personnel is not 
economical. 
24.4.  Briefings for Work Sampling. 
24.4.1.  In-briefing.  Make sure the work center supervisor and workers fully understand the 
principle of WS during the in-briefing.  Because its statistical basis makes WS difficult to 
understand, use illustrations without technical terms.  Use simple explanations to eliminate 
confusion.  Some examples of situations similar in principle to WS are testing antifreeze in a 
car radiator or taking blood samples.  Since each of these samples represent the original source, 
the opinions formed from the samples are valid for the whole product.  Explain during in-
briefing that WS daily observation sheets are not shown to supervisors or managers and are 
treated as given in confidence.  Sampling data is never used by superiors to evaluate 
individuals. 
24.4.2.  Out-briefing.  Summarize process percentages during out-briefings.  Charts are a 
convenient way to graphically present this information.  Brief local OPRs on measured man-
hours and WLF values.  Cover the treatment of assumed and inferred work.  Inform local OPRs 
measurement results do not represent the final determinant.  C&R analysis computes the final 
determinant using data from the measurement locations. 
24.5.  Work Sampling Process Development.  Develop the processes for WS at the same level 
as for OA (Level II), or if appropriate, at the broader process level (Level I).  Derive activity or 
step times by using the percentage estimates described in paragraph 24.3.  Write the processes to 
facilitate observation during sampling.  Processes should cover all required work, be clearly 
defined, and be mutually exclusive. 
24.5.1.  Select processes for both direct and indirect work.  Refer to Chapter 4 for more 
information regarding work classification.  Further define the process by using steps.  Each 
step is discrete and understandable to the observer.  Failure to clearly define processes distorts 
process percentages and later makes analysis and determinant maintenance difficult. 
24.5.2.  WS efforts identify time spent in available and nonavailable activities.  Available time 
is broadly classified as productive (direct and indirect) and nonproductive.  Examples of 
nonavailable activities are:  leave, medical absences, TDY for training, etc.  Additional 
processes, such as additional duties, may be described and measured during WS for 
management’s information. 
24.5.3.  Nonproductive categories, for sampling purposes, are personal fatigue, idle (e.g., 
extended lunch), and unavoidable delay.  Other nonproductive categories, such as assumed and 
inferred, may be added as needed.  Do not use “other” and “miscellaneous” for nonproductive 
category titles as they become catchalls during WS efforts.  Usually, productive indirect and 
174 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
nonproductive activities are sampled at the process level.  Data collected for these processes is 
useful when out-briefing WS results. 
24.5.4.  Sample lunch to account for productive time expended during the lunch period and to 
account for nonproductive time taken for an extended lunch. 
24.5.4.1.  Sampling of lunch eases the accounting of samples at the end of each sampling 
day.  Be cautious when selecting random times and making observations during the lunch 
period.  Incorrect accounting of lunch samples affects other process percentages.  Study 
teams give specific guidance on treatment of lunch observations, when applicable. 
24.5.4.2.  The following example illustrates the need for caution in sampling lunch.  
Assume three observations per hour are being taken and the lunch period for half the work 
center is from 1100 to 1200.  Assume the other half takes lunch from 1200 to 1300.  Select 
random times so three observations occur between 1100 and 1200 and three occur between 
1200 and 1300.  Normally record three samples for lunch for each worker. 
24.5.4.3.  However, if worker A (from the first group) was working at 1145 (observation 
time) and did not take his/her full lunch hour, then one productive sample and two lunch 
samples would be recorded.  On the other hand, if worker B (from the second group) left 
for lunch at his/her regular time and was still on lunch break at 1310 (observation time), 
then three lunch samples and one idle or extended lunch sample would be recorded for 
worker B. 
24.5.4.4.  If lunch periods are staggered or workers do not take scheduled lunch breaks, 
this example is inappropriate.  In this case, sample lunch cautiously and check the 
percentage of lunch samples daily and at the end of the effort to verify representativeness. 
24.5.5.  An unscheduled category is useful for keeping accountability of samples.  Use this 
category when: 
24.5.5.1.  Shift changes are staggered during a multi-shift operation. 
24.5.5.2.  Workers are doing required work before the beginning or after the end of a 
scheduled shift. 
24.5.6.  As part of the verification process, accomplish the following: 
24.5.6.1.  Investigate the operation of the work center thoroughly before beginning the 
effort.  Check organizational structure, mission requirements, directives, and other 
pertinent factors, such as backlogs, work cycles, and historical production. 
24.5.6.2.  Measure steps separately.  The study team, in cooperation with the OPR during 
data analysis, makes the final decision to include or exclude these steps in the manpower 
determinant.  The study team updates the processes if it is determined the added steps apply 
to all locations. 
24.6.  Collecting Work Unit Counts and Potential Workload Factors. 
24.6.1.  Setting Up a Work Count System.  Man-hours collected during WS efforts represent 
only one portion of the data needed to compute an equation.  The other important part is 
workload data.  Set up a work count system to record workload on a daily basis.  If work counts 
are not completed daily, then record them as frequently as the work is completed.  Use a 
production report, if available, but make periodic checks to validate its accuracy.  Ensure the 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
175 
production report period corresponds with the development period.  Do not include WUCs for 
days sampled but dropped from computations for non-representativeness.  Adjust the average 
daily work counts to an average monthly figure.  Use this figure as the independent variable 
for the determinant man-hour equation.  Use total monthly-allowed man-hours as the 
dependent variable.  An exception to this procedure is allowed when the potential WLF is 
nonproduction oriented.  For example, population serviced may be relatively constant on a 
daily, weekly, or monthly basis.  In this case, use population serviced as reported for the time 
frame closest to the WS period for the dependent variable. 
24.6.2.  Determining Sampling Period.  Sample at least one complete cycle during the 
measurement period.  The normal sampling period is 21 days (minimum of 15 usable duty 
days).  When necessary, extend the sampling period to ensure it covers a complete cycle. 
24.6.2.1.  Conduct WS over a representative period or work cycle.  Ideally, use WS when 
a normal period of productivity is to be measured and when relatable WUs are available.  
When a work cycle is longer than a month, the study team decides the feasibility of using 
WS.  In a seven-day work center, ensure a representative proportion between weekend days 
and weekdays is maintained during the sampling period.  For example, when 21 usable 
duty days are needed, six of those days should be weekend days.  Evaluate each day’s 
sampling results for representativeness.  If a day is not considered representative, extend 
the sampling period. 
24.6.2.2.  Use the experience of work center personnel to set up an average work cycle and 
to pinpoint recurring periods of heavy productivity.  Plotting these cycles against a time 
scale may reveal a pattern and its composite effect on the work center. 
24.6.3.  Supplementing WS with OA.  During a WS effort, samples may be taken for a process 
previously identified for measurement by OA.  When this occurs, maintain sample 
accountability, and avoid double counting. 
24.6.3.1.  Evaluate the supplemental OA for non-routine work based on total review of OA 
work.  No adjustment is needed for non-routine work if the sampling period is considered 
representative.  Project teams provide special instructions to identify and report cyclical 
work that occurs less frequently than monthly, for example, quarterly or annually.  A 
representative sample period reduces the need for OA. 
24.6.3.2.  There is a difference between work not occurring during the sampling period and 
work not observed.  If a particular step was done but was not observed due to the 
randomness of the observation schedule, do not add OA time for the step.  OA only those 
non-routine required steps that occur less frequently than monthly.  Be particularly careful 
when supplementing WS data for indirect tasks.  When Level I (productive and 
nonproductive) sampling is being used, a supplemental OA for indirect tasks is not 
required. 
24.6.4.  Man-hour Population.  The man-hour population (sampled man-hours) for accounting 
purposes consists of man-hours for available, nonavailable, borrowed, lunch, and overtime.  It 
excludes loaned man-hours and for computational purposes, the man-hour population excludes 
nonavailable time.  This allows for the complete accounting of time with no degradation of 
accuracy and percentage of occurrences. 
176 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
24.6.5.  Observation Schedule Development.  When scheduling the time between observation 
samples, use a random process.  The purpose of sampling is to supply information about the 
population.  Characteristics discovered in the sample are expected to exist in the population 
from which the sample is taken.  The key to unbiased sampling is the randomness of the sample 
observations.  Computer software can be utilized to generate a series of random numbers with 
the needed number of digits to ensure randomness. 
24.6.5.1.  Sampling period, work center operating hours, desired accuracy, and the number 
of people assigned determine the number of observation rounds needed for each work 
center during a WS effort.  A sample is a single recorded status of one person during an 
observation of a work center.  An observation yields a number of samples equal to the 
number of people observed.  For example, an observation made at 10:15 in a seven-man 
work center yields seven samples. 
24.6.5.2.  Determine the observation schedule.  Project teams determine the cycle, which 
days to sample, and the strata to use (e.g., stratified hourly or stratified daily random 
sampling).  Develop the schedule to collect no fewer than 1,111 available samples 
(excluding lunch) in each work center.  This number ensures accuracy in all available 
processes and eliminates the need to estimate the number of samples needed when 
conducting a mini-effort.  Taking fewer than 1,111 samples will cause the effort to fail 
statistical significance.  If this happens, extend the measurement period through the next 
cycle.  Prior to sampling, consult the work center supervisor regarding scheduled 
nonavailable activities, such as leave, medical absences, or TDY. 
24.6.5.3.  Select observation times so the number of samples taken per individual per day 
remains constant.  An exception to this rule may occur when an individual is borrowed or 
loaned, works overtime, is newly assigned, or departs the work center during the duty day. 
24.6.5.4.  When an observation schedule cannot be met because locations are widely 
dispersed, develop a randomized location schedule.  Begin sampling at the start of the 
normal duty day and continue until the end of the normal duty day.  Move from one location 
to another in the order previously recorded, but on no prescribed schedule.  Sample the 
location on arrival.  Follow the recorded order until enough samples are collected to 
achieve accuracy, a complete cycle is sampled, and the minimum sampling period is 
covered.  Operationally audit overtime when this method is used. 
24.6.5.5.  Often it is desirable to ensure each hour of the day has equal representation in 
the sample.  In work centers where activity fluctuates hourly, use stratified sampling.  In 
this procedure, determine the number of observations needed per hour and randomly select 
observations within the hour.  Once sampling begins, follow the predetermined schedule 
per hour until completion of the sampling period.  Ensure the number of observation times 
for lunch is representative before sampling.  The following example illustrates how to 
determine the number of observations needed per hour: 
24.6.5.5.1.  Assume a work center size of seven people and a sampling period of 21 
workdays. 
24.6.5.5.2.  One observation of seven people per hour, assigned for an 8-hour day over 
a 21-day period, yields 1,176 samples (1 x 7 x 8 x 21 = 1176).  This meets the minimum 
requirement of 1,111 available samples.  However, if normal non-availability for 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
177 
military personnel (e.g., 11.09%) occurs during the effort, then only 1046 available 
samples would be obtained, i.e., 88.91% of 1,176 available samples.  Therefore, 
increase the minimum number of observations per hour to two.  Increasing the number 
of observations per hour above the minimum improves the accuracy and efficiency.  
Make allowances for loaned time when setting up observation schedules. 
24.6.6.  Man-hour Shift Profile Sampling.  The purpose of the man-hour shift profile chart is 
to reduce standby.  When post/position manpower is not clearly defined and it is not possible 
to accurately sample standby, construct a present and proposed man-hour shift profile chart.  
When collecting WS data to build the man-hour shift profile chart: 
24.6.6.1.  Use stratified hourly sampling. 
24.6.6.2.  Designate each productive process as transferable or nontransferable. 
24.6.6.3.  Construct the present man-hour shift profile chart directly from information on 
the daily observation and recapitulation sheets. 
24.6.6.4.  Construct the proposed chart by analyzing and improving the present chart (see 
Chapter 8, paragraph 8.4 for more information on constructing man-hour shift profile 
charts). 
24.6.6.5.  Use the proposed chart to support the standby time allowed in the determinant.  
Also, use the chart to graphically support reduced standby to the OPR. 
24.6.7.  Work Sampling Procedures.  Make observations at scheduled times without distracting 
workers.  Enter the work center inconspicuously.  Sometimes it is best to remain in the work 
center between closely spaced observations because distractions caused by entering could bias 
samples. 
24.6.7.1.  Classify the sample instantaneously so each sample is the result of an immediate 
observation.  When it is not possible to identify the proper process, classify the sample as 
productive or nonproductive and reconcile it later.  The worker’s activity immediately 
before or after the scheduled observation may give a clue to proper classification. 
24.6.7.2.  Conduct trial sampling to reduce the number of questions during observation 
rounds.  When possible, wear apparel similar to the personnel in the work center being 
sampled.  Likeness in clothing causes the analyst to blend with work center personnel and 
helps reduce apprehension.  Avoid unnecessary conversation but be friendly and answer 
questions regarding the study process. 
24.6.7.3.  Properly classify PF&D, standby, and idle time.  Accurate identification provides 
rationale for using the allowance factor or for proving a larger factor that includes 
additional fatigue or delay.  Identify potential areas for assumed and inferred work.  The 
key to proper identification is the familiarity with the work center.  Identify inferred and 
assumed work separately.  Later, credit inferred work to the proper work center, or remove 
it from allowed man-hours.  Always remove assumed work from allowed man-hours. 
24.6.7.4.  Sample pre-duty and post-duty periods.  The analyst should be in the work center 
when the first worker arrives and stay until the last worker departs.  When a worker is 
present during pre-duty or post-duty periods, but is not productive, sample the worker as 
unscheduled and exclude from sample man-hour computation.  A productive sample during 
178 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
this period increases the number of samples per person per day and is equivalent to sampled 
overtime. 
24.6.7.5.  Follow the same measurement technique for all determinant input locations.  For 
example, when WS is the primary measurement method, all inputs use WS.  An exception 
is allowed when the work center has two or fewer people (see paragraph 24.3.3.).  When 
OA is specified for one process, all inputs OA that process.  Also, when stratified sampling 
is specified, all inputs stratify.  When work center personnel stagger lunch periods, use 
stratified, hourly sampling to ensure lunch samples are representative. 
24.6.7.6.  Avoid sampling at the lower task levels unless these tasks are easily identifiable 
by observation.  Sampling a large number of tasks increases the time needed to make an 
observation round and results in a need for more analysts to complete coverage.  Sampling 
at the task level disrupts work center personnel because questions need to be asked to 
properly classify samples. 
24.6.7.7.  Between samples, accomplish daily accumulations, compute control chart limits, 
collect WUs or potential WLFs, conduct OAs, observe personnel who might be working 
out-of-area, and investigate process improvement opportunities. 
24.6.7.8.  Treat standby time during sampling according to Chapter 8, section 8.3.2. 
24.6.7.9.  Analysts should be able to recognize all workers, their duty schedule and lunch 
period, and the work accomplished.  Analysts should also be familiar with the layout and 
boundaries of the work center.  Devise coding systems to expedite sampling and facilitate 
recall.  Use mutually agreed-on codes when more than one analyst is involved in the effort. 
24.6.8.  Protection of Data.  Daily WS observation data points are considered sensitive 
information and are not releasable by name. 
24.6.8.1.  Use codes for identification in lieu of names. 
24.6.8.2.  Devise a code for idle and sensitive processes.  Use codes familiar to other 
analysts.  Memorize codes for productive indirect and nonproductive categories and omit 
the legend on the form, however, include a legend for all omitted entries as part of the study 
plan. 
24.6.8.3.  Data Leveling.  Pace rating for WS efforts is a study team option.  Pace rating is 
used to determine a leveling factor.  The leveling factor adjusts productive time to a norm.  
The analyst needs to be proficient with rating and familiar with the job to rate effectively.  
The nature of selecting inputs from a cross-section of installations, coupled with the 
determinant development process of using least squares regression, helps ensure the norm.  
If pace rating is used, the pace rating range is specified by the study team.  If pace rating is 
not used, the leveling factor is 1.00.  Refer to Chapter 22 for information on pace rating. 
24.6.9.  Allowance Factor Computation.  Allowances are computed to recognize PF&D.  
Allowances are applied at the process level for WS efforts.  When the base personal allowance 
factor is used for the work center, apply it to all productive and leveled processes.  When a 
larger allowance factor is computed, apply it only to the affected process.  Use the base 
personal allowance factor for the remaining productive processes.  The study team determines 
whether the base personal allowance factor is pertinent.  If it is not, the study team computes 
the allowance factor to be used according to Chapter 23.  The allowance factor, fixed or 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
179 
computed, is evaluated during the first three days of the measurement period, and then 
coordinated with the functional OPR.  The coordinated allowance factor is then put in the SWD 
for all input locations to use. 
24.7.  Work Sampling Data Control Charting.  The two types of control charts used with WS 
data are productivity charts and WLF control charts (see Chapter 11, section 11.7 for more 
information about control charting).  Exercise caution when examining productivity control charts 
and excluding non-representative samples to ensure adequate sample size is maintained. 
24.7.1.  Productivity Charts.  Productivity charts, or P-charts, are effective for determining 
representativeness of daily productivity.  By comparing productivity control charts with the 
WLF control chart more information is apparent to the analyst. 
24.7.1.1.  A productivity chart is a graph that has a center line, UCL and lower control limit 
(LCL) and the daily productivity to be analyzed. 
24.7.1.1.1.  The center line is the average productivity for the period the chart 
represents. 
24.7.1.1.2.  Set UCL and LCL by adding and subtracting three standard errors of 
proportion from the center line. 
24.7.1.1.3.  Exercise caution in discarding data.  Do not declare data unusable simply 
because a point falls beyond established limits.  Clearly state a reason for not using 
each day’s data. 
24.7.1.2.  Frequently in the first few days (possibly a week) of sampling, greater 
productivity is observed than in the remaining days of the effort.  This is usually caused by 
the analyst’s presence in the work center.  After personnel in the work center become 
accustomed to the analyst, data are usually more representative of the normal situation.  
When this situation causes high productivity followed by low productivity, include both in 
the effort.  Consider alternating analysts daily and compare odd and even days.  This helps 
identify any observer bias. 
24.7.2.  Control Chart Preparation. 
24.7.2.1.  The same general procedures for preparing control charts (Table 24.2 and 
Figure 24.1) apply to all types of control charts.  However, the computations of the needed 
values differ for variable data (measurements of time, length, etc.) and attribute data 
(percent or proportions).  WS uses attribute data.

24.7.2.2.  Attribute data are suitable for a P-chart that evaluates changes in the percent of 
proportion.  The P-chart is based on the binomial distribution.  This distribution uses the 
average quantity in computing its variation.  The instructions for the needed values are in

24.7.3.  WLF Control Charting.  A WLF control chart often helps determine the 
representativeness of the data collection period, verifies the accuracy of the work count, and 
identifies normal workloads.  The WLF control chart is used in combination with P-control 
charts.  Make a WLF control chart when the WLF count is available on a daily basis.  
Development of a work center determinant during other-than-normal workload periods might 
result in a distortion of the determinant. 
24.7.3.1.  Get the historical workload (minimum of 6 months of data) and create a control 
chart (dividing monthly totals by the number of working days per month) to determine the 
normal expected average and control limits. 
24.7.3.2.  As the effort develops, plot each day’s WLF count cumulatively.  Valuable 
questions to analyze points that deviate from the historical line include: 
24.7.3.2.1.  Are the daily and historical counts based on the same WLF?  Check the 
definition of the WLF.

24.7.3.2.3.  Is productivity commensurate with high or low current workload compared 
to historical workload?  Check rating factors for indications of high or low ratings. 
24.7.3.2.4.  Is the unit experiencing an activity (exercise or operational test) that affects 
the workload count?  Is it affecting productivity?  Check the P-chart to determine 
whether days should be excluded.

QUEUEING 
25.1.  General Concepts.  The primary intent of this chapter is to relate queueing analysis to the 
Air Force MEP.  General procedures are presented to give analytical direction and a feel for 
queueing situations.  The following are basic queueing principles. 
25.1.1.  During post/position manpower situations in particular, queueing analysis is useful in 
determining the total number of positions needed to meet varying levels of service. 
25.1.2.  Defining the queueing system is critical to ensure the application of the correct 
queueing formulas. 
25.1.3.  Queueing analysis results in a deterministic result, i.e., using process averages always 
ends in the same mathematical result. 
25.1.4.  Queueing and simulation modeling hold much in common. 
25.1.4.1.  For simple solutions with Poisson distributed arrivals and an exponentially 
distributed service time, choose queueing analysis. 
25.1.4.2.  As the model becomes more detailed, or the system is inherently complex, 
choose simulation modeling.  Refer to Chapter 12. 
25.2.  Queueing Systems and Analysis. 
25.2.1.  A queueing system refers to the entire process of a customer arriving, being served, 
and leaving the system.  Figure 25.1 illustrates the basic steps of a queueing system.  A specific 
definition is needed to understand the term customer.  In queueing, customer is used in a 
general sense and does not necessarily refer to a human customer and could represent anything, 
animate or inanimate, awaiting service.  The following are examples of customers: 
25.2.1.1.  A vehicle waiting to enter a US Air Force base’s main gate. 
25.2.1.2.  A morale call waiting to be answered by a telephone operator. 
25.2.1.3.  A patron waiting in line at checkout at the commissary. 
Figure 25.1.  General Flow of a Queueing System. 
 
25.2.2.  Queueing analysis can be a powerful addition to data analysis when developing a 
manpower determinant.  Although traditional work measurement techniques apply to a 
situation where the next item to be processed is available when the worker is ready to start, in 
systems where the workload develops (arrives) randomly, queueing theory applies.  For 
184 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
example, and in keeping with examples above, queueing analysis could provide considerable 
insight when: 
25.2.2.1.  An analysis of the appropriate number of posts or positions is in question.  For 
example, the number of Security Force posts required to maintain a specified wait time or 
average number of vehicles in the queue at a base entry control point. 
25.2.2.2.  There are differing levels of service, particularly when a function’s performance 
measures deal with customer wait time, and the resultant manpower impact is being 
explored.  For example, the number of telephone operators required to answer a customer 
phone call within 10, 20, or 30 seconds. 
25.2.3.  After completing the mathematical analysis of a queue and the creation of a queueing 
model, the following queueing system metrics can be predicted: 
25.2.3.1.  The probability of a customer(s) waiting or not waiting. 
25.2.3.2.  The average number of units waiting to be served. 
25.2.3.3.  The average time spent in the queue. 
25.2.3.4.  The average time spent in the system. 
25.2.4.  Given any of the aforementioned metrics as part of the function’s performance criteria, 
a decision can be made regarding what level of service is acceptable and the resulting 
manpower impact.  For example, the analyst can determine the number of cashiers needed to 
make sure a customer’s desired average waiting time is not exceeded. 
25.2.5.  In the final analysis, a queueing model does not result in the final decisions.  Rather, 
the model provides important information to base decisions upon.  Thus, it becomes important 
to objectively apply the tools of work measurement and analysis to ensure the best information 
is provided. 
25.3.  Defining a System for a Queueing Analysis and Queueing Formulas.  Before doing a 
queueing analysis, carefully research and define the entire queueing system.  Figure 25.2 presents 
the type of information needed and further delineations of that information needed to perform a 
queueing analysis.  It is critical to correctly define the system in terms of these information 
categories as specific queueing formulas are needed to correctly compute the accurate solution for 
a specific type of queueing system. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
185 
Figure 25.2.  Types of Information Needed in Queueing. 
 
25.3.1.  Customer (Source) Population.  The size of the customer population, also known as 
source, is a count of the actual system user population and is classified as either finite or 
infinite. 
25.3.1.1.  Finite Customer Populations.  A customer population that has a fixed size is 
finite.  Once a customer has arrived and been serviced, the total customer population to be 
serviced is reduced by one and directly affects the probability of arrival of the remaining 
customers.  In a fixed customer population, the probability of a customer arriving for 
service is based on the number of customers already in the system.  For example, consider 
repairing lathes.  A machine shop has five lathes (i.e., customer population equals five) that 
are serviced by a single repairman.  These machines break down occasionally (arrive for 
service).  When this occurs, the down machine is repaired and put back in service.  While 
the one machine is down for repair, the customer population is not the same as now only 
four remain in service affecting the probability of occurrence of the next arrival. 
25.3.1.2.  Infinite Customer Populations.  When a customer population is so large it is 
unaffected by the service capacity of the system, the population can be considered infinite.  
In an infinite customer population, the probability of a customer arriving for service is 
independent of the number of customers already in the system. 
25.3.1.2.1.  For example, assume the aforementioned machine shop has now been 
equipped with a sufficient number of spare lathes.  When one machine is down, a spare 
lathe is immediately substituted.  Hence, the customer population to be serviced 
remains constant at five, even if one lathe is down for repair.  Since a machine down 
no longer affects the customer population, the population in this case can be correctly 
termed infinite. 
186 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
25.3.1.2.2.  For another example, consider a commissary’s customer population.  Here, 
the commissary’s customer population is finite because only people with commissary 
privileges are customers.  However, this customer population is so large when 
compared to the service capacity of the commissary, the population effectively 
becomes infinite as the customer population is considered inexhaustible. 
25.3.2.  Service Channels.  Service channels are concerned not only with the number of service 
facilities but also with the associated queue(s).  A queue is characterized by the maximum 
number of customers it can hold.  A queue is considered finite when a given number of 
customers are already waiting in a queue and customers are denied entry into the queue until 
others are served.  An infinite queue does not have such restrictions and can handle an 
unlimited number of customers.  Service channels can be considered single or multiple.  A 
single service channel has only one queue or waiting line.  Multiple service channels can have 
one queue, such as a barbershop with multiple barbers and a general waiting area where 
customers are served on a first-come, first-served basis.  Multiple service channels can each 
be served by different queues, such as a commissary with several checkout lines. 
25.3.3.  Queue Discipline.  A queue’s discipline refers to the method used to select customers 
to be served from the queue.  Some of the common queue disciplines are listed below. 
25.3.3.1.  First-Come, First-Served.  The next available server services the first customer 
in the queue line. 
25.3.3.2.  Priority.  A customer is given some sort of priority on entering the queue.  Those 
customers with higher priorities are served before those with lower priorities.  Two types 
of priority are preemptive and head-of-line.  Preemptive priority is when a customer with 
high priority is allowed to enter the service channel immediately even if a customer with a 
lower priority is being serviced.  Head-of-line priority puts a higher priority customer at 
the head of the line but does not preempt any ongoing service. 
25.3.3.3.  Random Selection.  With random selection, the order of customers being served 
is independent of arrival time and customers are selected to be serviced with no particular 
pattern. 
25.3.3.4.  Bulk Selection.  In a bulk selection, a group of customers are selected for service 
at one time. 
25.3.3.5.  Note:  Importantly, queue disciplines may alter when customers do not behave 
as expected.  For instance, a customer may jump from one service channel to another.  A 
customer may also balk, i.e., leave prior to entering the waiting line; or leave the queue 
after becoming impatient and deciding to no longer wait in line. 
25.3.4.  Customer Arrivals and Inter-arrival Time.  The arrival pattern of customers to a 
queueing system can be described by: 
25.3.4.1.  Customer Arrival Rate.  The average number of customer arrivals to the system 
per some unit of time (i.e., the mean arrival rate).  For example, four commissary customers 
per minute arrive in the system. 
25.3.4.2.  Customer Inter-arrival Time.  The average time between successive customer 
arrivals (i.e., the mean inter-arrival time).  For example, a commissary customer arrives to 
the system on average every 15 seconds. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
187 
25.3.4.3.  Note:  The customer arrival rate is measured in customers per unit of time, and 
the inter-arrival rate is measured in time between customer arrivals.  For the same system 
and data, one measure is the reciprocal of the other. 
25.3.5.  Service Patterns.  The service pattern of customers within a non-empty queueing 
system can be described by its: 
25.3.5.1.  Customer Service Rate.  The average number of customers served per some unit 
of time (i.e., mean service rate).  For example, 400 customers are served per day. 
25.3.5.2.  Average PAT.  The average time to service a customer (mean service time).  For 
example, it takes two hours per aircraft inspection. 
25.3.5.3.  Note:  The relationship between customer service rate and average PATs are 
simply the reciprocal of the other measure. 
25.4.  Further Queueing Analysis.  To complete queueing analyses, analysts should consult 
available textbooks and online resources.

CONSULTANT SERVICES AND MANAGEMENT ADVISORY STUDIES 
Chapter 26 
CONSULTANT SERVICES 
26.1.  Overview. 
26.1.1.  General Concepts.  A core capability within the manpower function is providing 
consultant services to unit commanders and functional managers at all organizational levels.  
Organizations may request manpower consultant services to facilitate problem solving or for 
general information and advice regarding manpower management or process related issues. 
26.1.2.  Definition.  Consultant services direct manpower competency toward problem 
resolution, effective resource usage, or mission performance improvements.  These services 
may include brief consultation with management, or a more in-depth consultation requiring a 
study contract and report.  Analysts should acquire broad based management skills, knowledge, 
and behaviors to be successful consultants.  Table 26.1 lists three categories of skill sets key 
to providing successful consultation services.  Note:  The OMM can be used as a consultant 
tool to help identify improvement opportunities in an organization (refer to Chapter 3).

26.1.3.  Management Consultant Framework.  It is important to recognize no skill set is greater 
than the other and a balance is needed to perform at the optimal level to provide maximum 
value to clients.  The management consultant framework at Figure 26.1 illustrates a continuous 
flow of various skill sets whereby usage is dependent on the scope and complexity of the 
provided consultant service. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
189 
Figure 26.1.  Management Consultant Framework. 
 
26.2.  Consulting Skill Sets. 
26.2.1.  Facilitation.  The facilitator’s primary role is making sure the group comes to a 
designated outcome in an effective and efficient manner.  The facilitator accomplishes this by 
providing structure and keeping things on schedule.  Effective facilitators focus on two main 
elements during a consultation: 
26.2.1.1.  Content.   Defining the tasks to be accomplished and ensuring the group stays 
focused. 
26.2.1.2.  Process.  The flow of the session(s) and the methods used to achieve the 
objectives.  This includes procedures; format and tools; group dynamics; norms; and 
cultural climate. 
26.2.2.  Tools and Processes.  A process or technique is the approach used by a facilitator to 
help participants achieve the goals of a workshop or meeting, such as sharing information, 
generating and organizing ideas, or making decisions.  Several different processes are usually 
employed during a workshop.  Models or methodologies provide a framework.  Processes, 
tools, and techniques are used to compliment that framework.  Tools and techniques include, 
but are not limited to:  brainstorming or idea generation; affinity diagramming; value stream 
and process mapping and criteria matrix; and ranking. 
26.2.2.1.  Example Technique for Brainstorming, Affinity, and Ranking.  The Nominal 
Group Technique is a useful problem-solving and idea-generating strategy.  This technique 
is controlled by the facilitator and includes these steps:  silent generation, round robin 
listing, clarification, and voting and ranking. 
26.2.2.1.1.  Step 1.  Silent Generation.  The silent generation step typically takes about 
10 min.  During this step, the facilitator prompts the group to independently generate 
as many ideas as possible in the time allowed. 
190 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
26.2.2.1.2.  Step 2.  Round Robin Listing.  The facilitator then calls on participants, in 
turn, to read one of their written responses.  This phase continues until all the ideas 
produced by the group are listed and displayed. 
26.2.2.1.3.  Step 3.  Clarification.  Once all the items have been recorded, the facilitator 
calls on the author of each item to offer clarification if needed. 
26.2.2.1.4.  Step 4.  Voting and Ranking.  After ideas have been developed, facilitators 
work with the group to categorize and rank similar ideas.  Affinity diagrams are a useful 
technique for categorizing ideas.  Ranking can be done utilizing several methods such 
as multi-voting. 
26.2.2.2.  Additional Techniques.  More detailed accounts of other resources, tools, and 
methods can be found online or in other manuals. 
26.2.3.  Project Management.  A project manager is tasked with overseeing all aspects of a 
study, ensuring it is on task, on time, and within budget.  They follow the project management 
process:  initiating; planning; executing; monitoring and controlling; and closing. 
26.2.4.  Managing Client Relationships.  A consultant displays competency in this area when 
the techniques required to develop, maintain, and manage relationships with clients are 
understood.  This includes managing client expectations; establishing and maintaining 
relationships at all levels of the organization; and increasing commitment and support 
throughout the course of engagement and after project closure. 
26.3.  Business Skill Sets. 
26.3.1.  Analytical and Proactive Thinking.  Consists of working systematically and logically 
to resolve problems, identifying root cause, and anticipating unexpected results.  Involves a 
methodical step-by-step approach to thinking that allows consultants to break down complex 
problems into single and manageable components.  This type of thinking also requires 
consultants to compare sets of data from different sources, identify possible cause and effect 
patterns, and draw appropriate conclusions from these datasets to arrive at appropriate 
solutions.  Analytical thinking can be broken into the following steps: 
26.3.1.1.  Gathering Information.  Gather all the necessary information required to solve 
the problems.  Ask appropriate questions to gain the necessary insights to make more 
effective decisions about the problems being solved. 
26.3.1.2.  Performance Data.  Take statistical information to evaluate how an organization 
is performing.  Review performance data to determine which products/services, staff, or 
departments are most efficient and determine areas of improvement. 
26.3.1.3.  Consultant Acumen.  Consultants with this skill tend to display a superior 
understanding of the following four areas: 
26.3.1.3.1.  Understanding Thought Processes.  The consultant is mindful of the 
context, scope, and details of the situation at hand; is prepared to make sense of 
complexity and confusion; and demonstrates the ability to react, showing resilience and 
flexibility. 
26.3.1.3.2.  Developing Consultant Knowledge.  Knowledge relating to elements of an 
organizational model. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
191 
26.3.1.3.3.  Effective Use of Management Processes.  Management processes are the 
tools, procedures, and ideas that give structure to organizational thinking and 
communication about activities. 
26.3.1.3.4.  Management and Leadership Skills.  The ability to manage the various 
personal relationships essential to the enterprise’s success. 
26.3.2.  Negotiation.  A method by which people settle differences.  It is a process by which 
compromise or agreement is reached while avoiding argument and dispute.  Follow a 
structured approach to achieve a desirable outcome: 
26.3.2.1.  Preparation.  Before any negotiation, decide when and where a meeting will take 
place and who will attend to discuss the problem.  To clarify positions, ensure all relevant 
facts of the situation are known.  Preparing before discussion avoids further conflict and 
wasted time during the meeting. 
26.3.2.2.  Discussion.  Participants put forward their understanding of the situation.  Key 
skills during this stage include questioning, listening, and understanding.  It is helpful to 
take notes during the discussion stage to record all points put forward in case there is need 
for further clarification.  Each side should have an equal opportunity to present its case. 
26.3.2.3.  Clarification of Goals.  Clarify all differing goals, interests, and viewpoints from 
the discussion.  Clarification is an essential part of the negotiation process; without it, 
misunderstandings are likely to occur which may cause problems and barriers to reach a 
beneficial outcome. 
26.3.2.4.  Negotiate Towards a Positive Outcome.  This stage focuses on an outcome where 
both sides feel their points of view have been taken into consideration.  It is essential for 
participants to keep an open mind to achieve an acceptable solution.  A win-win outcome 
is usually the best result.  If this is not possible, then alternative strategies and compromises 
need to be considered.  Compromises can often achieve greater benefit for all concerned 
compared to holding to the original positions. 
26.3.2.5.  Agreement.  This is achieved once both sides viewpoints and interests have been 
considered.  Decisions need to be definitive and communicated clearly to participants. 
26.3.2.6.  Course of Action.  After agreement on a decision, a course of action must be 
implemented. 
26.4.  Technical Skill Sets. 
26.4.1.  Effective Communication.  Combines a set of skills, including nonverbal 
communication, engaged listening, stress management in the moment, the ability to 
communicate assertively, and the capacity to recognize emotions. 
26.4.1.1.  While effective communication is a learned skill, it is more effective when it is 
spontaneous rather than formulated.  It takes time and effort to develop these skills to 
become an effective communicator. 
26.4.1.2.  There are four key skills that translate to better and more effective 
communication:  active listening, attention to nonverbal signals, managing stress, and 
assertiveness. 
192 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
26.4.2.  Emotional Intelligence.  The ability to recognize emotions, understand what has been 
said, and realize how those emotions affect others.  This allows consultants to manage 
relationships more effectively.  Emotional intelligence is made up of four core skills under two 
primary competencies, personal competence, and social competence. 
26.4.2.1.  Personal Competence.  Made up of self-awareness and self-management skills, 
focusing more on the individual than interactions with other people.  Self-awareness is the 
ability to accurately perceive emotions.  Self-management is the ability to use awareness 
of these emotions to stay flexible and positively direct personal behavior. 
26.4.2.2.  Social Competence.  Made up of social awareness and relationship management 
skills.  Social awareness is the ability to understand moods, behavior, and motives to 
improve the quality of relationships.  Relationship management is the ability to use 
awareness of those emotions and the emotions of others to manage interactions 
successfully. 
26.4.3.  Continuous Innovation and Improvement Skills and Tools.  As a consultant, 
competence and skills in the MEP methodology, tools, and techniques, and the CI2 process is 
necessary to be successful.  The purpose of CI2 engagement is to document, improve, and 
standardize the processes of an Air Force function.  This guides a process improvement team 
logically from problem definition to implementing solutions linked to root causes. 
26.4.3.1.  The Practical Problem Solving Method (PPSM) provides a standardized 
approach similar to Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA), and Define, Measure, Analyze, 
Improve, and Control (DMAIC).  The activities of the PPSM are listed below: 
26.4.3.1.1.  Clarify and validate the problem. 
26.4.3.1.2.  Break down the problem and identify performance gaps. 
26.4.3.1.3.  Set improvement targets. 
26.4.3.1.4.  Determine root cause. 
26.4.3.1.5.  Develop counter measures and implementation plan. 
26.4.3.1.6.  See countermeasures through. 
26.4.3.1.7.  Confirm results and process change. 
26.4.3.1.8.  Standardize successful processes. 
26.4.3.2.  Consistent application of the PPSM provides a concise and common format for 
presentation of data, problem solving facts, and information.  The common structure 
provides a common language which easily translates into a common understanding.  To 
attain superior understanding of both the CI2 process and PPSM and MEP methodologies 
requires knowledge and practical application of a multitude of CI2 skills.  Effective 
consultants are proficient using the tools found in Table 26.2.

26.5.  Providing Consulting Services. 
26.5.1.  Providing effective management consultant services requires the manpower consultant 
to continuously develop and improve a myriad of skills.  The key to being a successful 
consultant is to strike an appropriate balance amongst the various skill sets that meets the needs 
of the Air Force community. 
26.5.2.  Do not agree to provide consultant services if the sole purpose is to justify 
predetermined manpower increases or decreases or there is an expectation for the consultant 
to make a line management decision for the client.

Chapter 27 
MANAGEMENT ADVISORY STUDY 
27.1.  General Concepts.  Analysts can provide a MAS in-house at base, command, and Air 
Force-wide levels. 
27.1.1.  Any client (AF commander, functional manager, or supervisor) may request MAS 
assistance.  The base manpower function may perform a MAS for any base or tenant unit.  
With the client’s permission, official parties may receive the study results.  The client has the 
final authority to reject or accept and implement proposed initiatives.  AFMAA can be used as 
a sounding board by the base-level manpower function during a local advisory study.  
However, these communications should not violate the client-consultant relationship. 
27.1.2.  Every organization should constantly seek improvement.  Improvement can be 
measured in dollars, time, and quality factors.  It leads to improved operational effectiveness 
and cost-savings.  The improvement process should be managed if it is to have a significant 
and lasting effect.  The changing military environment creates challenges each organization 
adapts to meet.  Completing a MAS is helpful in the following situations: 
27.1.2.1.  A short-term analysis is needed to resolve an issue. 
27.1.2.2.  A client cannot devote time to the problem. 
27.1.2.3.  Specialized knowledge and skills are not available within a client’s own 
resources to identify or solve a problem. 
27.1.2.4.  An objective and/or impartial viewpoint is needed to give a fresh approach to a 
problem or to resolve conflicting issues. 
27.1.3.  Do not use a MAS in the following scenarios: 
27.1.3.1.  To justify manpower changes. 
27.1.3.2.  Approve or lend credence to a preconceived solution. 
27.1.3.3.  Discredit another organization or individual. 
27.1.3.4.  When the client expects the manpower enterprise to assume the decision-making 
role of organizational management. 
27.1.3.5.  To quantify manpower or man-hours for the purpose of programming future 
requirements. 
27.2.  Conducting a Management Advisory Study. 
27.2.1.  Skills.  Use a wide range of skills involving organizational analysis, investigation of 
management functions, work methods and procedures, and resource utilization.  These skills 
are acquired through formal training and practical experience. 
27.2.1.1.  It is critical to gain the client’s confidence, accurately define the problem, build 
a solution, and persuade the client to adopt the recommendations. 
27.2.1.2.  Effective communication and mutual understanding between the client and 
consultant are essential to the success of the study. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
195 
27.2.2.  Scope.  The length, approach, and degree of formality depends on the MAS.  At times, 
the client and the consultant can decide informally on the scope.  However, more often, an 
expanded study is needed, especially if the client cannot clearly define the problem, or the 
problem is too complex or broad. 
27.2.3.  Preliminary Research. 
27.2.3.1.  Identifying and Defining the Problem.  Most MASs are problem-solving 
exercises.  The problem statement describes symptoms and probable causes.  It provides 
guidance for use during analysis.  Problem symptoms are often mistaken for causes, 
therefore, probe for the root of the problem.  While the problem definition may show only 
the client's limited viewpoint, the study may produce other views. 
27.2.3.2.  Stating the Goals and Limitations. 
27.2.3.2.1.  Goals are desired outcomes clearly identified during preliminary research.  
Some typical goals are:  to decrease total processing time; to improve work procedures 
or workflow; to decrease space requirements; to improve the use of critical skills; to 
improve work quality; or to decrease resource expenditures (people, money, or 
material).  Goals are stated in specific terms and ranked in priority.  In final form, these 
goals spell out the study objectives. 
27.2.3.2.2.  Limitations or restrictions put barriers on study goals.  Occasionally, 
certain specific limitations identified in preliminary research (e.g., regulatory 
requirements, local managerial preferences, etc.) may prove to be direct contributing 
causes to the problem.  Attempt to mitigate these limitations. 
27.2.3.2.2.1.  At times, the client wants to study the cause and effect of directives 
that are controlled by an authority higher than the client.  When this occurs, it is 
better to charter the study at the level that can change the directive.  Although it is 
a limiting factor not to have a charter at that level, it is not a reason to not do the 
study.  There are proper channels for staffing directive changes, either through the 
client's functional OPR or Air Force MEP channels. 
27.2.3.2.2.2.  On occasion, a good MAS solution to a problem is dismissed by the 
client.  Do not treat this as a study limitation unless the client wants it to be listed 
accordingly. 
27.2.3.3.  Determining Feasibility.  Factors such as cost, study timing, consultant and client 
workload, time needed to build a solution, and study priority impact the feasibility of the 
study. 
27.2.3.4.  Proceeding with the MAS.  After the problem is defined and the study goals, 
scope, limitations, and anticipated benefits identified, the consultant (perhaps jointly with 
the client) decides whether the study can continue.  If the study does not currently warrant 
consultant resources, decline, or recommend a study delay or cancellation. 
27.2.3.5.  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).  Make sure that both the client and 
consultant clearly understand and agree to the objectives and scope of the study in a MOU.  
Figure 27.1 details the purpose and content of the MOU. 
196 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
Figure 27.1.  Memorandum of Understanding. 
27.2.3.6.  Study Design.  Study design is an extension of the initial study definition, as 
specified in the MOU.  Design efforts complement and support feasibility. 
27.2.3.6.1.  During study design, formalize plans and schedule for conducting the 
study.  Careful planning lays the groundwork for efficient use of consultant personnel 
and helps save the client’s time.  A plan serves to focus effort on common objectives 
and maintains consistency of action. 
27.2.3.6.2.  Study design includes study approach (e.g., measurement techniques, a 
synopsis of the nature of the work); strategies for study completion (e.g., data collection 
methods); and any other pertinent information needed to facilitate study completion.  
Develop a working plan for fact-finding and to determine the type data to acquire; the 
sources of data; the techniques to collect the data; and the reporting format. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
197 
27.2.3.6.3.  Define study team personnel requirements and qualifications and possible 
sources of expertise (e.g., consultants, client operating personnel, and other outside 
offices and/or agencies).  Identify each individual study team member’s roles and 
responsibilities. 
27.2.3.6.4.  State how findings are to be coordinated and exchanged (such as interim 
briefings, reports, and interim decisions). 
27.2.3.6.5.  Identify the required study actions and/or milestones.  Identify when vector 
checks are to be conducted to check on study progress and/or for updating the study 
plan. 
27.2.3.6.6.  Consider cost in the design process so that the benefit outweighs the cost.  
Obviously, there is a point of diminishing returns in the amount of time that can 
justifiably be spent improving a management practice.  Study benefits can take on 
intangible forms, such as improved morale, increased service, or better managerial 
control. 
27.2.4.  Data Gathering.  Data gathering forms the basis for later analysis and 
recommendations for improvement.  The data gathered should be accurate, unbiased, and 
comprehensive.  Failure to collect and document pertinent and accurate facts could undermine 
the validity of the results.  These are the three objectives for data gathering: 
27.2.4.1.  Objective 1.  Collecting Facts.  Usually, three versions of "the facts" are 
discovered; what the directives state, what operating officials think is being done (or should 
be done), and what is actually being done.  For this reason, direct the examination at the 
regulatory, managerial, and performance levels. 
27.2.4.2.  Objective 2.  Collecting Opinions and Suggestions.  Encourage client personnel 
to voice opinions.  Opinions are personal judgments, not specific events or facts.  Good 
ideas may come from client personnel, their suggestions should be recorded and given 
careful consideration. 
27.2.4.3.  Objective 3.  Promoting Acceptance of Improvements.  The technical aspects of 
a study are often relatively straightforward if the proper study technique is selected.  In 
fact, the most challenging task may be to convince operating personnel and the client to 
accept needed improvements.  To help facilitate acceptance of improvements, identify a 
test period for new procedures, layout, or organization, as needed.  Advise who is 
responsible, and when, for procedural development, briefings, orientation of personnel 
taking part in the test, conducting the test, and evaluating the results. 
27.2.4.4.  Basic Principles for Data Gathering: 
27.2.4.4.1.  Stay within the scope, schedule, and objectives stated in the plan. 
27.2.4.4.2.  Determine the breadth and depth needed for fact gathering by starting at 
the top and working down.  This approach gains proper perspective and support from 
each level of supervision. 
27.2.4.4.2.1.  Only a few aspects of the overall problem dominate others.  Focus 
data collection on identifying these issues, unless causes and workable solutions 
are found, the study may have little or no value.  But when solved, the issues create 
a chain reaction for resolution of lesser concerns. 
198 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
27.2.4.4.2.2.  How much data is enough?  Irrelevant data or data defined as only 
"nice to know" are a waste of consultant time.  It is better to have too much data 
than too little.    Remain flexible when deciding how, when, where, and what data 
to collect.  In the end, the experienced judgment of the consultant is essential for 
these decisions. 
27.2.4.4.3.  Record data in a planned, orderly fashion so that valuable facts are not lost 
later in the study.  Clearly identify each item so that an audit trail is left which shows 
when, where, and from whom data was obtained. 
27.2.4.4.4.  Personnel and documentation are two main sources of information in data 
gathering.  These sources complement each other and are to be used in every possible 
case.  Obtain information from these sources by one or more of the following methods:  
documentation review, interviews, observation, and questionnaires. 
27.2.4.4.5.  Validate data.  Errors, omissions, or misunderstandings in data can lead to 
unsound recommendations and result in confusion, excessive expense, and personal 
embarrassment.  Make sure that analyses and recommendations are based on facts, not 
on unfounded rumors or misunderstandings.  Verify all important information against 
basic documents or factual data. 
27.2.5.  Data Analysis. 
27.2.5.1.  Use proper techniques to display data to find relationships, verify facts, and 
ensure that all required facts or information is known. 
27.2.5.2.  Pick the type, detail, and arrangement that best answers the questions of who, 
what, where, when, why, and how it is done.  The most creative part of the improvement 
process is developing new methods or procedures. 
27.2.5.3.  Improvement recommendations are often obvious.  At other times, a systematic 
study of operations, processes, relationships, or procedures are needed to find good 
solutions. 
27.2.6.  Developing Recommendations.  Strive to develop practical recommendations that are 
realistic in terms of resources and the client is most willing to accept.  Remember resistance to 
change is normal, so take every opportunity to discuss new proposals with everyone involved. 
27.2.6.1.  Make every effort to get client personnel involved with the improvement process.  
The more personnel are involved in developing improvements, the more readily the 
changes are accepted. 
27.2.6.2.  Periodic discussions centered on tentative recommendations help the client and 
consultant focus on developing sound and practical solutions. 
27.2.7.  Briefing the Results. 
27.2.7.1.  Address all the main facts surrounding the data gathering process, the 
conclusions reached, the recommended improvements, and the detailed implementation 
plan.  State all facts, conclusions, and recommendations in positive terms. 
27.2.7.2.  Be prepared to discuss major ideas with alternatives in mind.  Many times, an 
alternative is preferred by a client and results in the improvement being implemented. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
199 
27.2.7.3.  Ensure recommendations that involve other functions are properly coordinated 
and documented. 
27.2.8.  Implementing Study Results.  The client is responsible for implementation of study 
findings with the assistance of the consultant. 
27.2.9.  Ending the Study.  The client may want a final briefing to end the study after 
improvements are implemented and the follow-up visits are conducted. 
27.2.9.1.  This is a good opportunity to discuss initial improvements the client chose not to 
implement or new ideas that resulted from implementation of recommendations. 
27.2.9.2.  Be careful to avoid being involved in a never-ending study of a single 
organization.  Stay within the boundaries of the scope established in the MOU. 
27.3.  MAS Documentation.  The MAS report provides the client enough information to make 
valid decisions and carry out the recommendations. 
27.3.1.  MAS Report.  The report meets the client's needs by providing solid justification for 
all recommended actions.  Additionally, if approved for release, it provides findings and 
recommendations for other potential users and documents the efforts of the consultant. 
27.3.2.  Client Approval and Reporting Criteria.  To protect the client-consultant relationship, 
be sure the client concurs with the release of the abstract and/or MAS report (i.e., have the 
client sign an acknowledgement for release).  If the client has agreed to release, then forward 
a copy of the abstract to AFMAA for cross-feed purposes.  If the client does not concur, note 
this in the report and abstract and file it along with the other study documents.  Do not forward 
MAS documents that have not been released by the client.

Terms 
Adjustment Factor—A specific computed value used to adjust an individual process time or 
associated work unit count. 
Aggregation—The procedure of summing fractional work center manpower requirements 
(generated by application of manpower determinants) before applying rounding procedures.  This 
definition is applicable only when the term is associated with fractional manpower. 
Air Force Manpower Determinant—A management and programming tool that quantifies the 
manpower requirements for an organization, work center, or function.  This tool determines the 
204 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
minimum level of manpower required based on the approved SWD.  The AFMD may contain Air 
Force approved variances (see variance definition).  Applies to two or more commands. 
Air Force Mission Model—A management and programming tool that quantifies the manpower 
requirements for an organization, work center, or function.  This tool determines the minimum 
level of manpower required based on the approved SWD.  The AFMD may contain Air Force 
approved variances (see variance definition).  Applies to one command. 
Allowance—A time increment included in the standard time for an operation to compensate the 
worker for production lost due to fatigue and normally expected interruptions, such as for Personal, 
Fatigue, and Delay (PF&D).  It is usually applied as a percentage of the normal or leveled time to 
determine Standard Time (ST). 
Allowance Factor—A coefficient, based on authorized allowances, that is applied to productive 
time (leveled time, if appropriate), and results in the productive allowed time. 
Allowed Time—The leveled time plus allowances for rest and delays.  If leveling is neither 
required nor feasible, the allowed time is the actual productive time plus necessary allowances for 
PF&D as appropriate. 
Analysis of Alternatives—An analysis of direct aircraft maintenance and munitions requirements 
using simulation software and associated tools.  An AoA provides decision makers with reliable, 
objective manpower assessments in response to varying levels of current LCOM change 
(alternatives) or new model engineering estimates. 
Assigned Strength—Computed monthly average number of military and civilian personnel 
assigned to a work center during the data collection period (e.g., the personnel actually in-place to 
accomplish the collected workload).  Includes full-time and/or part-time over hires, CMEs 
accomplishing work center responsibilities, borrowed personnel from other functions to include 
ARC augmentation (e.g., man-days), and documented uncompensated overtime.  Excludes 
personnel deployed or loaned out to other functions. 
Assumed Work—Work being done that is not necessary to work center productivity.  Assumed 
workloads are not compensated for in the requirements determinant. 
Available Time—Assigned man-hours dedicated to performance of primary duties, plus time 
specifically allowed for PF&D, standby, and travel activity.  This is computed by subtracting the 
nonavailable hours from the assigned hours.  
Avoidable Delay—Any unnecessary delay, regardless of source, that causes work stoppage.  Time 
lost to avoidable delay is not included in the determinant. 
Bivariate—A type of equation that contains only two variables, such as X and Y. 
Borrowed Time—Time on loan from another work center. 
Continuous Improvement and Innovation—Anchored in Lean, an operating philosophy that 
emphasizes the relentless eradication of non-valued activity in pursuit of mission effectiveness.  
CI2 uses several widely accepted methodologies, including application of Lean tools, Six-Sigma 
Analysis, Theory of Constraints Analysis, and Business Process Reengineering Analysis.  Enables 
Airmen to eliminate waste while maximizing customer value. 
Contract Manpower Equivalent—The amount of manpower required if the contract workload 
were done in-house at the same workload and level of performance as the contractor.  CMEs are 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
205 
in terms of civilian manpower requirements.  During the application process, manpower 
determinants are computed.  CME values (representing workload included in the determinant) are 
subtracted from the computed requirement to yield the in-service portion of the work center 
requirements. 
Control Chart—A chart showing time-related performance of a process.  It is used to determine 
when the process is operating in or out of statistical control, using control limits defined on the 
chart. 
Control Limits—A statistically derived limit for a process that indicates the spread of variation 
attributable to chance variation in the process.  Control limits are based on averages. 
Desired Accuracy—The maximum amount of error acceptable in a sample.  This is stated as 
absolute accuracy or relative accuracy. 
Determinant Application—A systematic determination of required or allowed manpower 
authorizations for Air Force activities using manpower determinants.  The process consists of 
relating prescribed workload factor volumes to manpower models or tables resulting in a numerical 
identification of whole authorizations normally by AFS, skill level, and grade.  Often referred to 
as “pricing out a determinant.” 
Determinant Development—A study process that designs, measures, analyzes, and determines a 
work center or function’s manpower requirements. 
Direct Time—Productive time expenditure that can be identified with and assessed against a 
particular end product (work unit, workload factor, etc.) or group of products accurately and 
without undue effort and expense. 
Directed Requirement Technique—An OA technique that recognizes many activities and some 
positions as directed requirements.  These requirements may apply to whole-man positions; to 
directed frequencies, such as monthly inspections; or to directed time values, such as the periodic 
run up of a standby electrical power generator. 
Extrapolation—Extension of the regression line beyond the range of the input data to increase 
the determinant’s utility, to expand the manpower determinant’s applicability, and to prevent rapid 
obsolescence due to workload changes. 
F-Test—Any statistical test in which the test statistic has an F-distribution under the null 
hypothesis.  It is most often used when comparing statistical models that have been fitted to a data 
set, in order to identify the model that best fits the population from which the data were sampled. 
Facilitator—An individual who functions as the coach/consultant to a group, team, or 
organization and ensures all parties are heard, the team starts and finishes on time, and all 
objectives of the activity are met. 
Fatigue Allowance—An allowance made in a manpower determinant to account for mental or 
physical weariness caused by job difficulty and environmental conditions. 
Flow Diagram—A representation of the location of activities or operations and the flow of 
materials between activities on a pictorial layout of a process.  Usually used with a process 
flowchart. 
Fractional Manpower—Manpower requirements to do a specific workload, expressed in 
fractional parts of whole persons. 
206 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
Frequency—The number of times a specific value occurs within a sample of several 
measurements of the same dimension or characteristics on several similar terms.  In work 
measurement, the number of times an element occurs during an operation cycle. 
Function—A group of personnel that use similar machines, processes, methods, and operations to 
do homogeneous work usually located in a centralized area. 
Functional Estimating Equation—An estimating equation that is used to predict manpower 
requirements for a functional group.  Each functional estimating equation has two parts:  a 
mathematical equation and a series of percentage factors by program element code. 
Functional Model—A mathematical representation of the relationship between the manpower in 
a specific function and relevant policy, program, or workload variable. 
Gemba—A Japanese word meaning “the actual place.” In Lean practices, the Gemba refers to 
“the place where value is created,” or where the work of an organization actually takes place (e.g., 
shop floor in manufacturing, the job site on a construction project, workstation of an office worker, 
etc.).  “Gemba walks,” denotes the action of going to see the actual process, understand the work, 
ask questions, and learn from members who do the work. 
Groupthink—A pattern of thought characterized by self-deception, forced manufacture of 
consent, and conformity to group values and ethics. 
Idle Time—Any time expended by the worker either in an avoidable delay status or in doing 
unnecessary work when work is available.  It does not include time for PF&D.  Idle time is not 
included in a manpower determinant.  An individual who goes to the base exchange, commissary, 
barber shop, etc., and meets the above conditions, is classified as being on idle time. 
Indirect Allowance Factor—Represents a portion of total productive work and is used to quantify 
productive, indirect work man-hours associated with nine standard indirect work activities.  It is 
applied as a percentage of total monthly direct man-hours to determine the total monthly allowed 
man-hours required by the work center. 
Indirect Time—Time that does not add to the value of a product but must be done to support the 
manufacture of the product.  It may not be readily identifiable with a specific product or service. 
Inferred Work—Workload that is defined as the responsibility of another work center.  It can be 
treated by transferring either the workload, prior to measurement, or the time expended on that 
workload (loaned time) to the appropriate work center, after measurement. 
Input—Products and/or services received from suppliers in order to perform a process. 
Layout—The physical arrangement, either existing or on plans, of facilities or items necessary to 
do a work task. 
Layout Analysis—Studies used to improve production, ease physical exertion, and shorten travel 
for material and personnel. 
Lean–—A process improvement methodology used to establish a continuous, proactive method 
of identifying opportunities for improvement, implementing changes based on such opportunities, 
measuring the impact of such changes, and eliminating waste from an organization’s processes. 
Leveled Time—Actual productive time adjusted to account for differences in pace of observed 
workers. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
207 
Leveling—Process whereby an analyst evaluates observed operator performance in terms of a

Loaned Time—Time loaned to other work centers.  This time is not accountable to the work 
center providing the loaned time. 
Logistics Composite Model—A determination of direct aircraft maintenance and munitions 
requirements using simulation software and associated tools.  LCOMs capture the variety, 
complexity, and uncertainty of maintenance environments; and are easily amendable for AoAs. 
Manpower Assessment—Assessments are special efforts or initiatives, which serve a useful 
purpose in evaluating required manpower when formal determinant development is not feasible.  
Due to their situational application, assessments may or may not follow the discipline or rigor of 
the more formal manpower determinant development process. 
Management Advisory Study—A consultant service requested by a base-level work center 
supervisor or manager and generally applicable only to that base.  Specific results are released with 
permission of the requesting office of primary responsibility. 
Man-hour—A unit of measuring work.  It is equivalent to one person working at a normal pace 
for 60 min, two people working at a normal pace for 30 min, or a similar combination of people 
working at a normal pace for a period of time equal to 60 min. 
Man-hour Availability Factor—A factor reflecting the average number of man-hours per month 
an assigned individual is available to do primary duties. 
Man—hour Population—The total set of man-hours that a sample is drawn from reflecting the 
required man-hours for a work center.  This set includes:  man-hours for all personnel assigned, 
borrowed time, and overtime.  It does not include loaned time. 
Manpower Model—Mathematical equation that describes the relationship between independent 
variables (workload values) and manpower or man-hours. 
Manpower Requirements—Human resources needed to accomplish specified workloads of 
organizations.  There are two types of manpower requirements:  funded and unfunded.  Funded 
manpower requirements are those that have been validated and allocated.  Unfunded requirements 
are validated manpower needs that have been deferred because of budgetary constraints. 
Modular Equations—A series of equations that represent one work center.  These equations are 
appropriate when all required man-hours for a work can be subdivided into separate independent 
modules. 
Multicollinearity—An undesirable condition when two or more of the independent variables are 
found to be highly correlated with each other during multivariate correlation and regression 
analysis.  The correlated independent X-variables add similar (thus, little additional) information 
to the model. 
Multivariate Equation—A type of equation containing two or more independent variables. 
Nonavailable Time—Assigned man-hours allowed for participation in those activities directed, 
recognized, and approved by the Air Force, that render the individual unavailable for assigned 
primary duties. 
Normal Time—A Per Accomplishment Time adjusted by pace rating. 
208 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
Observation—In WS, the act of noting what the people in a work center, or in a specified portion 
of a work center, are doing at a specific instant.  Such an observation yields a number of samples 
equal to the number of people observed.  See Sample. 
On-Call Time—A nonproductive category of time when an off-duty worker can be contacted by 
telephone or other means at a prearranged location other than the work station.  Only the productive 
time spent by the worker in the work center or at the work location, including necessary associated 
travel, is to be credited to the work center. 
Organization Maturity Model—A scalable, web-based assessment tool used to objectively 
baseline and prioritize improvement opportunities within an organization.   
Outliers—A term used to describe those data points that do not conform to the general pattern or 
trend described by a data array or scatter gram, (for example, data points that are beyond 
established control limits or that are significantly divergent from an otherwise apparent trend). 
Overtime—Time expended in excess of regularly scheduled working hours. 
Output—A final product or service rendered.  The result of a process with required steps that has 
a definitive beginning and end. 
Pace (Performance) Rating—The act of comparing an actual performance by a worker against a 
defined concept of a normal performance.  Various methods of performance rating are in use.  
These methods differ primarily as to the basis on which the comparisons are made.  Pace rating is 
the method of performance rating prescribed for use in the MEP.  See Leveling. 
Per Accomplishment Time—The time it takes to accomplish a single task one time. 
Personal Allowance—Time included in a determinant to permit a worker to attend to personal 
necessities, such as obtaining drinks of water or making trips to the restroom (usually applied as a 
percentage of the leveled, normal, or adjusted time). 
Post/Position Manpower—A method of developing a determinant that couples a functional OPR-
approved requirement with a predetermined manpower factor. 
Post/Position Manpower Factor—A fractional manpower computation that shows the manpower 
required to man a position.  This factor is dictated by the need for one or more individuals to be 
on duty, although these individuals may not be continuously productive. 
Post/Position Qualification Time—A constant man-hour requirement directed by higher 
headquarters policy.  It is used to determine the post/position manpower factor. 
Post/Position Related Time—Consists of the average monthly man-hours needed for processed 
which must be done either before or after position coverage starts.  Applies only to Security Forces 
post requirements. 
Practical Problem Solving Method—Standardized approach to properly define a problem, its 
root cause, countermeasures, and countermeasure implementation.  Provides a concise and 
common format for presentation of data, problem solving facts and information.  Eases 
benchmarking and sharing of leading practices when similar problems arise in other areas.  The 
structure provides a common language which more easily translates into common understanding. 
Predictability—A significant attribute that allows reliable predictions for future time periods to 
make a determinant useful for programming future requirements. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024

aircraft authorization. 
Procedure—A sequence of written operations established to get uniform processing by telling 
what actions are to be taken, who takes them, the sequence to be followed, and the tools to be used. 
Procedure Chart—A graphical display showing the flow of material or information in an 
organization.  It reflects the flow of information between work stations and between work centers, 
shows decisions made, and actions taken by individuals. 
Process—A sequence of work activities needed to accomplish the output.  It is a procedure with a 
definitive input and output.  A process involves worker interaction with such things as equipment, 
material, other people, and information.  In other words, the process produces a product or service 
for a customer. 
Process Flowchart—A diagram is created by using connecting lines and a set of conventional 
symbols; shows the relationships between different activities and helps to communicate how the 
process is performed. 
Productive Time—Time spent doing work that is useful and essential to the mission of the work 
center.  See Direct Time and Indirect Time.

accomplished to develop a determinant.  This method is generally used for single location 
determinants. 
Regression Analysis—A mathematical examination of relationships between two or more 
variables showing how useful these variables can be for prediction purposes. 
Relatability—A characteristic relating to manpower requirements.  A change in the value of the 
workload factor produces a corresponding change in the man-hours needed to do the task. 
Rest—An allowance made in a manpower determinant to account for mental or physical weariness 
caused by job difficulty and environmental conditions. 
Sample—A single recorded status of one person during an observation of a work center. 
Sample Size—The number of samples taken usually for a desired level of accuracy. 
Scatter Diagram—A two-dimensional chart on which known values of two variables are plotted.  
Examination of the chart shows the form of relationship which exists between the variables - for 
example, straight line or curvilinear. 
Simulation—A non-measurement method used to determine total work center manpower 
requirements.  The most common technique is queueing. 
210 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
Staffing Pattern—Man-hours allowed, usually on a one-for-one basis, in work centers that are 
not governed by rate of production but are established for management functions. 
Standard—An exact value, physical entity, or abstract concept established and defined by 
authority, custom, or common consent to serve as a reference, model, or rule in measuring 
quantities or qualities, establishing practices or procedures, or evaluating results.  A fixed quantity 
or quality. 
Standard Activity Time—A validated Per Accomplishment Time included in a Standard Work 
Document. 
Standard Time—(1)  The time that is considered necessary for a qualified worker, working at a 
normal pace under capable supervision and experiencing normal rest and delays, to do a definite 
amount of work of specified quality when the prescribed method is followed.  (2)  Time measured 
by use of rigid statistical methods, for example, time study.  (3)  The normal or leveled time plus 
allowances for rest and unavoidable delays. 
Standard Work Document—A document reflecting a list of improved standard processes, 
activities, standard activity times, outputs, sources/methods of count, and ancillary work required 
for AFMD and AFMM development. 
Standby Time—When the worker is required to be present to do time-sensitive work and is in a 
ready status to do this work but is prevented from doing it because none is available.  Time can be 
classified as standby only when it is essential to mission accomplishment and when no work can 
be done or made available during that period. 
Statement of Conditions—A part of the requirements determinant that identifies the environment 
and impact of conditional factors on the time needed to perform work center activities and 
identifies the basis for deviations and the projected impact, i.e., potential benefits from new 
equipment, automation, facilities, etc. 
Statement of Work—An official document that specifically defines and outlines the scope (the 
breadth and limitations) and performance requirements (tasks developed to satisfy program needs) 
of a contract. 
Study Sponsor—The HAF functional representative for DAF studies, MAJCOM functional 
representative for MAJCOM studies, or wing-level functional representatives for single point 
studies. 
Study Sponsor Representative—The subject matter expert appointed by the study sponsor that 
works closely with the study lead to ensure completion of a study. 
Technical Estimate—A determination of the standard hours required for a given task, based on 
an estimate by individuals who are technically and professionally competent to judge the time 
required. 
Time Study—A work measurement method consisting of careful time measurement of the task 
with a time measuring instrument.  The study is adjusted for any observed variation from normal 
effort to pace.  It allows adequate time for unavoidable or machine delays, rest to overcome fatigue, 
and personal needs.  Learning or progress effects may also be considered.  If the task is long, it is 
normally broken down into short, relatively homogeneous work elements, each of which is treated 
separately by, and in combination with, the rest. 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
211 
Transferable Work—Work that is essential to the work center but may be done at any time or 
during any period.  It may be direct or indirect type of work. 
Unavoidable Delay—An occurrence that is essential and outside the worker's control or 
responsibility that prevents the accomplishment of productive work. 
Unit Manpower Document—A detailed manpower listing reflecting the distribution of 
manpower allocations into a finite structure of authorizations (by work center). 
Variance—A condition that exists that either adds to or subtracts from the core workload or 
impacts the way the work is performed.  A variance can be the result of environmental, mission or 
technological differences, and can be either negative or positive. 
Variation—A measure of the dispersion or scattering of values about the mean of a distribution. 
Work Center—A group of personnel that use similar machines, processes, methods, and 
operations to do homogeneous work usually located in a centralized area.  The term is used to 
identify a relatively small activity within a broad functional segment.  Personnel within a work 
center do work that basically contributes to the same end product or result (duties are similar or 
closely related). 
Work Cycle—(1)  A pattern or sequence of tasks, operations, or processes with a distinct 
beginning and ending point.  (2)  A pattern of manual motions, elements, activities, or operations 
that are repeated without significant variation each time a unit of work is completed. 
Work Distribution Analysis—A technique to improve production that helps find out what work 
is being done, how much time is spent on it, and who is doing it. 
Workflow—The flow or movement of things being processed from one operation to another. 
Work Measurement—Process to obtain data necessary to compute accurate manpower 
requirements.  Techniques include WS, time study, and good operator timing and technical 
estimate.  Usually results in a manpower determinant or guide. 
Work Sampling—The application of statistical sampling theory and techniques to the study of 
work systems.  The characteristics of the sampled (observed) work done are used to produce 
estimates of the amounts of work and types of activity done.  Work sampling data can be used in 
conjunction with associated work counts to compute determinants. 
Work Unit—The basic identification of work accomplished or services performed.  Work units 
should be easy to identify; convenient for obtaining productive count; and usable for scheduling, 
planning, and costing. 
Work Unit Count—The number of work units done during a specified time period. 
Workload—An expression of the amount of work, identified by the number of work units or 
volume of a workload factor, that a work center has on hand at any given time or is responsible for 
doing during a specified period of time. 
Workload Factor—(1)  An index or unit of measure that is consistently expressive of, or relatable 
to, the manpower required to accomplish the quantitatively and qualitatively defined 
responsibilities of a work center.  (2)  An end product (or a combination of products) that represents 
the work done in the work center.  It may be either something physically produced in the work 
212 
AFMAN38-102  5 JULY 2024 
center (referred to as a production-type workload factor) or something that is external to, but served 
by, the work center (referred to as a work generator-type workload factor).
