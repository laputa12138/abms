PURPOSE:  The Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-42 series of 
publications is the primary reference for medical combat support capability.  This AFTTP, 3-42.56, 
provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support 
(HAAMS) for special operations, research and development, humanitarian and psychological 
warfare during peacetime and wartime operations.  Since HAAMS is only one component of the 
larger Department of Defense (DoD) mobility airlift enterprise, the guidance is designed to assist 
planners in the successful integration of HAAMS into mobility airlift operations and interface 
successfully with joint operations.  Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed 
in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, 
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Disposition 
Schedule (RDS) maintained in the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) 
located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.  Refer recommended changes and 
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.  Route AF Form 847 through the appropriate 
chain of command and parent Major Command (MAJCOM).   
 
APPLICATION:  This publication applies to active duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air 
National Guard personnel on flying status, passengers in certain types of aircraft, and other 
personnel who perform HAAMS.  The doctrine in this document is authoritative but not 
directive. 
 
SCOPE:  The primary mission for the HAAMS Center/Physiology Technician (PT) is to provide 
in-flight physiological support IAW AFI 11-409, High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support 
Program, to aircrews, parachutists and mission essential ground personnel performing 
unpressurized airdrop operations at 20,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) and above.  These airdrops

could be, but are not limited to: DoD Special Operations High Altitude Low Opening 
(HALO)/High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) personnel and equipment drops, Military 
Information Support Operations (MISO-formally PsyOps), equipment testing and research 
operations, and humanitarian aid operations.  Air Mobility Command Surgeon General 
(AMC/SG) is the Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) Responsible Agency 
(MRA).

CHAPTER 1 
HIGH ALTITUDE AIRDROP MISSION SUPPORT OPERATIONS 
 
1.1.  Purpose.  This document describes the TTP for HAAMS Unit Type codes (UTCs) FFQBB 
(personnel team) and FFQB1 (equipment pallet).  In accordance with AFI 11-409 High Altitude 
Airdrop Mission Support Program, HAAMS personnel are specially trained PTs (AFSC 43A3 or 
4M0).  PTs provide in-flight physiological support to aircrews and Special Operations Forces 
(SOF) High Altitude Parachutist (HAP) performing unpressurized airdrop operations at 20,000 
feet MSL and above (or upon aircraft or airborne commander’s request).  These airdrops could 
be, but are not limited to: DoD SOF HALO/HAHO personnel and equipment drops, MISO, 
equipment testing and research operations, and humanitarian aid operations.  Any unpressurized 
airdrop missions at 20,000 feet MSL and above require USAF HAAMS trained/certified PTs 
IAW AFI 11-409.   
 
1.2.  HAAMS Capabilities.  Personnel UTC FFQBB are fully capable of deploying with the 
FFQB1 equipment package or independently.  PTs will be permanently assigned as Operational 
Support Flyer (OSF) to support a deployed, forward-based, and/or other fixed airbase operation.  
Team members are designed to operate under the control of the deployed commander and/or user 
group and meet OSF requirements IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1, Aircrew Training.  
 
1.2.1.  UTC FFQBB.  The FFQBB Mission Capabilities Statement (MISCAP) provides 
two-person teams for physiological support to aircrew and on-board personnel during 
unpressurized flights at or above Flight Level (FL) 200 or as otherwise requested.  PTs 
are specially trained and are responsible for monitoring aircrew, parachutists and other 
on-board personnel.  Team(s) will be equipped to function 30 days without re-supply.  
Only active duty, world-wide deployable personnel with AFSC 43A3, 4M051, 4M071 
and 4M091 skill levels may fill this UTC.  AFSC substitutions are not authorized without 
prior approval from AMC/SG.   
 
1.2.2.  UTC FFQB1.  UTCs must be capable of stand-alone operations within their 
functional area.  The manpower UTC must be able to perform its mission from a bare 
base or established main operating base or, if designed to meet main operating base 
requirements, must be able to combine with additional UTCs to meet requirements of 
bare base operations.  The FFQB1 was designed for this purpose and its MISCAP 
describes and lists aeromedical equipment and supplies for the two-person HAAMS 
team.  The equipment package allows the team to support various contingency operations 
for 30-days without re-supply.

CHAPTER 3 
PRE-DEPLOYMENT/PLANNING 
 
3.1.  Overview.  The Pre-Deployment/Planning phase includes maintenance of UTC team 
member training, qualifications and/or equipment, and planning for employment of medical 
assets in support of contingency/non-contingency operations.  UTCs FFQBB/FFQB1 are 
enablers.  They do not deploy in AEF Tempo Bands; however, they may deploy with short-
notice, requiring the member(s) or package to be in a ready state at all times. 
 
3.2.  Mobility Status/Medical Readiness.  Only MR PTs will occupy UTC positions.  Status of 
MR PTs filling a UTC position will be strictly monitored by the HAAMS Program Manager.  
The HAAMS Program Manager will be notified immediately of changes in a PT’s mobility 
status.  MR PTs must complete all required ground and flight Mission Essential Task List 
(METL) items as well as Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP) requirements.  MR PTs 
will also be evaluated by Stan/Eval every 17 months. 
 
3.3.  Pre-Mission/Deployment Planning.  This phase formally begins when tasked.  However, 
mission demands can occur with little notice and it’s each PT’s responsibility to be ready and 
prepared to deploy quickly.  They will complete each item on the Mission Checklist (refer to AFI 
11-409).  Essential equipment must be carried, or coordinated with user group, and approved for 
use IAW the HAAMS Equipment List (Attachment 2).  PTs will be placed on operational 
support AOs and receive intelligence threat briefings based on mission, location and user group.  
PTs will contact the user group as soon as possible and discuss expectations, show times, drop 
schedule, aircraft availability for pre-rigging and contact information (e.g., cell phone number, 
lodging).  Contact the local flight surgeon and obtain 24-hour medical emergency contact 
information, nearest hyperbaric facility, and physiological incident plans.  Discuss pre-breathing 
requirements, exposure limits and rigging configurations with the user group and aircrew.  The 
loadmaster (LM) is the final approving authority for all rigging configurations.  If necessary, 
ensure an instructor aircrew member conducts emergency and egress procedures for all PTs.  
Document ground training on AF Form 4022 Aircrew Training Folder.  PTs will brief aircrew, 
parachutists and MEGP prior to any drop at or above FL200.  Additional briefings will be given 
as required for new personnel not briefed previously and during extended missions for refresher 
purposes.  PTs should also brief personnel on any SII or problem areas observed on previous 
missions.  
 
3.4.  Passport.  All members, upon assignment to the FFQBB, will obtain official passports 
purchased at government expense. 
 
3.5.  HAAMS Pre-Deployment Training Contingency Course(s).  The FFQBB UTC may be 
called to support various DoD user groups with unique missions.  These groups may require pre-
deployment user group orientation, HAAMS specific equipment, intelligence, combat training 
and/or briefings.  This additional training is conducted at Little Rock AFB.  Specific list and 
length of course(s) will be included in the AEF tasking, and the PT must expect and plan for this 
training prior to deployment.     
 
 
9 
 
3.6.  Equipment and Supplies.  The FFQB1 is the UTC HAAMS equipment package and will 
be inventoried at least annually IAW AFI 41-209.  The FFQBB team chief is responsible for the 
familiarity of all members with the HAAMS equipment package content inspections and pack-
out guide.  Teams will deploy with either an electronic or hard-copy listing of the AS for pack-
out and re-supply actions.  Deploying FFQBB members should also perform an inventory of the 
FFQB1 equipment package against the AS upon notification of deployment to ensure the 
package is complete and that items with expiration dates will not expire during the deployment.  
FFQBB team members will complete their own Shipment Declaration of Dangerous Goods 
forms for hazardous items in their deploying equipment.  They will present these forms to the 
appropriate agencies IAW the base Installation Deployment Plan and present a copy to the 
deploying commander. 
3.7.  Aircrew Flight Clothing and Equipment.  PT members must be properly equipped to 
perform duties in the flying environment to include issue of aircrew-specific personal protective 
clothing items.  HAAMS members must have the same flight personal protective clothing, 
equipment, and protection equipment as aircrew.  Each member will be issued initial protective 
clothing and equipment items (e.g., flight suit, gloves, boots, flight jacket, etc.) for non-
contingency HAAMS flight operations.  For individuals tasked to deploy, a list of minimum-
required protective clothing and equipment items for flight operations will be listed on the AEF 
Center website.  HAAMS operations do not fall under the Operations Group for training and 
equipping and do not receive support from Aircrew Flight Equipment personnel.  It is the 
responsibility of the home station Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF)/CC to properly train and 
equip each member identified to fill HAAMS position requirements.   
3.8.  Pre-Deployment Health Risk-Assessment.  All members will complete DD Form 2795, 
Pre-Deployment Health Risk Assessment, as soon as possible after they have been tasked or 
within 60-days prior to deployment.  This self-assessment is immediately reviewed by a health 
care provider.  DD Form 2795 is required for OCONUS deployments to a non-fixed MTF for 
more than 30-days.

                                                                   CHAPTER 4 
OPERATIONS/PRE AND POST-DEPLOYMENT 
 
4.1.  Execution Authority.  Personnel may be deployed to support various DOD user groups.  
Deployment tasking will provide additional information on the organization requesting support.  
Each member will be briefed on their Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) chain of 
command once they arrive in theater.   
 
4.2.  Employment.  High altitude personnel and equipment airdrop procedures may be employed 
during clandestine operations or in areas where small arms threats preclude conventional low-
altitude deliveries.  Airdrops above 3,000 feet above ground level (AGL) are considered high 
altitude drops.  At least one PT is required per 16 personnel, or as required by mission design 
series (MDS)-specific instructions, for all unpressurized high altitude missions conducted at or 
above 20,000 feet MSL.  It is recommended that at least two PTs be assigned to each mission, 
one of which must be MR.  PTs also may support missions below 20,000 feet MSL when 
requested by an air tasking order, the aircrew, or the user’s operations mission planner.      
 
4.3.  Prior to First Mission Sortie.  PTs will review current applicable regulations, aircraft 
instructions, and HAAMS checklists and briefing guide.  PTs will be placed on 9C operational 
support AOs and receive required intelligence threat briefings.  They will utilize the HAAMS 
briefing guide in AFI 11-409 and brief all aircrew, parachutists and/or MEGP prior to any 
mission at or above FL200.  They will coordinate with the local flight surgeon on procedures for 
transfer of individuals suspected of decompression sickness to a hyperbaric facility.  They will 
brief the aircrew, jumpmaster and/or other essential personnel on handling procedures of in-
flight equipment and medical emergencies.  They provide pre-flight briefings on the 
physiological/physical hazards of the mission, pre-breathing procedures, effects of 
environmental stresses, proper use of in-flight supplemental oxygen equipment, and any other 
special physiological considerations (depending on the mission profile) to all aircrew, 
parachutists, and additional passengers prior to the mission.  PTs monitor aircrew, parachutists, 
MEGP and passengers during the mission and manage in-flight physiological reactions until 
relieved by a flight surgeon.  They advise aircraft commanders and jumpmasters on safe 
decompression schedules, altitude and time restrictions, and the disposition of in-flight 
decompression sickness reactors requiring hyperbaric treatment.  PTs also advise and assist 
aircrew and jumpmasters on aircraft equipment rigging and in-flight operation, monitoring and 
management of supplemental oxygen consoles and aircrew/parachutist portable oxygen 
equipment. 
 
4.4.  During Mission Sorties.  The PTs will provide adequate support to aircrew, jumpers and 
MEGP during flight(s).  PTs will maintain oxygen discipline and monitor and record times and 
altitudes to which crew and other personnel were exposed from take off to landing. 
 
4.5.  Post-Mission/Deployment.  The team leader is responsible for completing the post-mission 
checklist and submitting a trip report to the HAAMS Program Manager within 10 calendar days 
of returning.  The team leader will complete applicable flight forms (e.g., AF Form 4022 Aircrew 
Training Folder, AF Form 4023 Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF Form 4024 Aircrew 
Training Accomplishment Report and AF Form - 4025 Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report) for 
 
11 
 
each mission.  If applicable, the team leader will ensure flight forms are accomplished to 
accurately record NMR and/or MR PT’s evaluation and progress.  These forms will be placed in 
PT’s 6-part FEF.   
 
4.6.  Redeployment to CONUS.  If applicable, members will inventory and re-pack all FFQB1 
medical equipment assets according to the pack-out list.  Any hazardous items will require 
appropriate documentation.  All personal gear will be packed in personal bags only.  DO NOT 
pack personal items in FFQB1 asset containers. 
 
4.7.  Flight Records.  In accordance with AFI 11-401, Aviation Management,  the original copy 
of the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document must be provided to the 
HARM office no later than 5 days after the end of the month in which the flights were 
performed.  For example, the AFTO Form 781 for a flight flown in March must be turned in to 
the servicing HARM office no later than (NLT) 5 April. 
 
4.8.  Post-Deployment Health Risk-Assessment.  All members will complete DD Form 2796, 
Post-Deployment Health Risk Assessment, before entering reconstitution or leave status.  DD 
Form 2900, Post-Deployment Health Reassessment, will be accomplished online 90-180 days 
after return. 
 
4.9.  Mission Folder.  All HAAMS PTs will maintain a mission folder which will contain, at a 
minimum, the following items:  Current AF Form 1887, Aeronautical Order (PA) Aviation 
Service,  AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying for Special Operational Duty; 
AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record or AF Form 1274, Physiological 
Training; AFTO 781 (blank); AFI 11-403, AFI 11-409, AFI 11-410, High Altitude Airdrop 
Procedures Section of Applicable Aircraft 11-2C-XV3, Oxygen Requirements Section of AFI 
11-202V3, Checklists, Forms, Reports, HAAMS Program Manager’s Emergency Contact 
Numbers, and if applicable, line badge and passport.   
 
4.10.  Security.  All aspects of communications security (COMSEC) and operational security 
(OPSEC) are fully implemented and rigidly enforced.  Personnel will be in/out-briefed on the 
sensitivity/classification of the operations they are supporting once they arrive on-site.  The use 
of Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) is expected for sensitive or classified 
information.  Member(s) will communicate with their user group to determine classification level 
before sending information forward.

CHAPTER 5 
LOGISTICS 
 
5.1.  Overview.  The FFQB1 UTC improves HAAMS PT’s ability to support airdrops at 
deployed locations.  It provides a world-wide deployable medical equipment and supplies pallet 
for two-person HAAMS team.  This UTC is generally used in conjunction with FFQBB, which 
provides the support personnel.  Agile combat support is required and the pilot unit is the 
HAAMS Center at Little Rock AFB, AR.  
 
5.2.  Inspection/Inventory Requirements.  The FFQB1 pallet is governed by AFI 41-209, 
Medical Logistics Support.  This instruction provides guidance for establishing and operating 
medical logistics support for MTFs.  Perform a complete or cyclical inventory so all items are 
inventoried within 12 months of their previous inventory (the actual due date for inventory 
completion is the final calendar day of the anniversary month, e.g., if the previous inventory 
closed on 15 March, the next must be completed NLT 31 March of the following calendar year). 
 
5.3.  Allowance Standard (AS).  The FFQB1 pallet enables PTs to perform their mission for 30-
days without re-supply.  The pallet contains specialized oxygen equipment used to perform 
HAAMS.  It is built on a standard USAF 463L pallet with an overall dimension of 88 X 108 
inches with usable dimensions of 84 X 104 inches.  This allows two inches around the load to 
attach straps, nets, or other restraint devices.  The 463L pallet system and nets will restrain up to 
10,000 pounds of general cargo 96 inches high.   
 
5.4.  Re-Supply, Re-Constitution/Sustainment.  Expeditionary Medical Logistics provides 
timely re-supply of ordered items to deployed medical units.  Upon deployment notification, 
Medical Logistics personnel should contact the Air Force Medical Logistics Operations Center 
(AFMLOC), to receive re-supply guidance for the specific destination/location at DSN 343-
4172/2883/4294, email afmoa.sgalx.afmloc@detrick.af.mil or the Air Force Medical Logistics 
Readiness website https://medlog.detrick.af.mil/index.cfm?event=medlog.readiness.  Re-supply 
orders will flow from the closest designated host medical treatment facility or reach-back 
support facility. Once logistical support is present, the Theater Lead Agent for Medical Materiel 
(TLAMM) may become the source for all medical supply needs.  Refer to AFTTP 3-42.8, 
Expeditionary Medical Logistics System, for further guidance.  Members are expected to predict 
supply needs so regular logistic channels and support can be used.  
 
5.5.  Post Deployment Inventory and Reconstitution.  PT(s) will coordinate with the HAAMS 
Program Manager and/or the pilot unit to determine where the pallet(s) will be returned for 
inventory and re-supply.  Members are responsible for identifying any equipment that failed, 
requires maintenance, or is missing at the time the assets are returned.  AMC/SG supplement to 
AFI 41-209 requires the Medical Logistics Flight to perform a complete inventory and report 
stick status within 30 days upon receipt of re-deployed assets.

CHAPTER 6 
TRAINING 
 
6.1.  Introduction/Objective.  The overall objective of the PT training program is to develop 
and maintain a high state of MR PT personnel for rapid employment across the full spectrum of 
operational requirements.  PT personnel will be able to interface with airlift operations, prepare 
any mobility aircraft for high altitude equipment or personnel airdrops, and provide appropriate 
en route and post mission physiological support using certified PT equipment. 
 
6.2.  Responsibilities.  HQ AMC/SG is the HAAMS MRA and is responsible for UTC 
manpower and ensures personnel tasked are properly trained and equipped to conduct operations 
IAW the FFQBB MISCAP.  The AF HAAMS Program Manager approves training, operations 
and Stan/Eval procedures.  The HAAMS Center is responsible for conducting and tracking all 
training and Stan/Eval across the AF. 
 
6.3.  Documentation.  As OSF members, PT’s contribute to flight safety and effectiveness 
through training and experience.  Accurate, detailed documentation is necessary to track progress 
and ensure each PT is qualified to support various types of missions.  All NMR and MR PT 
initial and mission qualification evaluations and continuation training will be documented and 
maintained in the individual’s HAAMS 6-part FEF or equivalent. 
 
6.3.1.  AF Form 1522 ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report/4022 Aircrew 
Training Folder – Used to document all ground training events.  Only Mission-Designed 
Series (MDS) instructor designated aircrew member(s) can sign off on egress and 
Emergency Procedures (EP) training using AF Form 1522.  This training will be 
transferred over to AF Form 4022. Maintain AF Form 1522 in member’s 6-part FEF until 
the training is re-accomplished. 
 
6.3.2.  AF Form 4023 Aircrew Training Progress Report – Used to document member’s 
progress on academics, hands-on and flight training.  This form will be used to document 
each training event and will include a statement of progress (e.g., student on track). 
 
6.3.3.  AF Form 4024 Aircrew Training Accomplishment Report - Lists ground and flight 
METL and other special interest items (SII).

tags. 
 
6.5.  PT Training. The HAAMS Center will coordinate, conduct, document and track academic, 
ground, flight, and on-the-job training.  
 
6.5.1.  Initial Qualification Training.  This training is for individuals who have little to no 
HAAMS experience or who were previously qualified but have not been involved in 
airdrops for more than five years.  Individuals undergoing initial qualification training 
will be considered NMR.   
 
6.5.1.1.  Prerequisites for Initial Qualification Training. 
 
6.5.1.1.1.  At least 2 years experience in Aerospace and Operational 
Physiology career field 
 
6.5.1.1.2.  Minimum AFSC 4M051 or 43A3 
 
6.5.1.1.3.  Complete HAAMS Center Director/Superintendent and 
HAAMS Program Manager interview.  Purpose is to ensure each 
candidate demonstrated good motivation, judgment and maturity and 
understands required training, roles and responsibilities.  Additionally, 
candidate’s knowledge, skills and ability to recognize and treat 
physiological reactors will be assessed. 
 
6.5.1.1.4.  Complete two C-130 low-level flights to assess adaptability to 
the flying environment. 
 
6.5.1.1.5.  After the candidate meets the above criteria, the HAAMS 
Program Manager will initiate a volunteer letter outlining standards and 
expectations.  The letter will be signed by the candidate and maintained in 
the individual’s 6-part FEF. 
 
6.5.1.2.  Required Courses:  The following courses must be completed prior to 
receiving MR PT status: Combat Survival S-V80-A, Emergency Parachute 
Training S-V80-B, and Water Survival S-V86-A.  These courses may be 
completed concurrently with MR initial qualification training.  In the event of a 
physiologic event, Physiology Technicians, unless otherwise trained to the EMT-
B, will render assistance at the self-aid and buddy care level only. 
 
15 
 
6.5.1.3.  Recommended:  Basic Emergency Medical Technician, Arctic Survival 
S-V87-A, Water Survival Non-Parachuting S-V90-A, U.S. Army’s Basic 
Airborne, Military Freefall Parachutist, and manufacturer’s oxygen equipment 
operators/maintenance courses. 
 
6.5.1.4.  HAAMS Course.  The HAAMS Program Manager is responsible for 
conducting the self-paced academic and hands-on training course.  It will 
commence once prerequisites listed in paragraph 6.5.1.1. have been completed.  
Course duration is approximately 10 duty days and will cover subjects and 
equipment listed in the METL.  If available, local C-130 equipment and/or 
parachute sorties will be coordinated to familiarize NMR PTs with various types 
of flight operations and missions.  Additional Special Interest Items (SIIs) may be 
added to the course.  Certificate of completion will be signed by the HAAMS 
Program Manager and HAAMS Center Director and placed in the member’s 6-
part FEF. 
 
6.5.1.5.  Initial Ground Qualification Training.  The primary MDS for HAAMS is 
the C-130 and C-17.  If possible, hands-on C-130 and C-17 egress and EP training 
will be accomplished by any instructor designated aircrew member.  Minimum 
requirements are listed in the AFI 11-2C Vol 1 series of each MDS and include 
local area survival, aircraft emergency procedures and equipment, ground and in-
flight safety issues, compatibility of PT equipment with the aircraft, and a ground 
training period.  An MDS instructor certifies requirements on AF Form 1522.  
PTs will then transfer training information to AF Form 4022. 
 
6.5.1.6.  Initial Flight Qualification Training.  The HAAMS course and initial 
ground qualification training must be completed prior to flight training.  Flight 
training involves real-world non-contingency tasking or local sorties.  Each NMR 
PT will participate in a minimum of five oxygen equipment sorties (additional 
sorties recommended and as deemed necessary) with two at or above FL200, 
accompanied by an MR PT.  The NMR PT will progressively assume more 
responsibilities until capable of handling all aspects of a mission.  MR PTs will 
use AF Form 4023 and document NMR PT’s progress on each sortie.  
 
6.5.1.7.  Initial Qualification Evaluation.  When the NMR PT satisfactorily 
completes flight training and the minimum number of sorties, he/she will act as 
the team leader on a subsequent mission and be evaluated by a MR PT using the 
evaluation checklist.  This mission evaluation includes, but is not limited to, pre-
mission, mission and post-mission checklist compliance.  Based on the NMR 
PT’s performance, the MR PT will use AF Form 4025 and recommend 
upgrade/not upgrade to MR status.  The HAAMS Program Manager will review 
the NMR PT’s 6-part FEF and make a final determination of NMR or MR status.  
Individuals not selected for MR status will be counseled and a personalized 
training plan will be designed to assist in their upgrade training. 
 
 
16 
 
6.5.2.  Mission Ready PT.  An MR PT is someone who is trained, current and available 
short-notice for world-wide deployment for contingency and non-contingency missions. 
MR PTs are responsible for immediately reporting any changes to their status to the 
HAAMS Program Manager.  
 
6.5.3.  Requalification Training.  Previously qualified PTs who have not been involved in 
airdrops for three years but less than five years will receive requalification training based 
on individual proficiency.  Specific training requirements will be determined by the 
HAAMS Program Manager. 
 
6.6.  Continuation Training.  MR PTs are specially trained and are qualified in various types of 
oxygen support equipment and deploy on different types of MDS aircraft.  As a result, MR PTs 
must continuously improve their knowledge, skills and experience to be fully operational and 
capable of supporting non-contingency and contingency operations. 
 
6.6.1.  Readiness Skills Verification Program.  The HAAMS Program Manager will 
design a quarterly training program that includes items listed in the ground and flight 
METL.  The objective is to cover all items once/year.  Special Interest Items, or high 
interest items as determined by leadership, may be added.  NMR PTs may participate to 
fulfill requirements for MR status.  RSVP training will be documented by the Unit 
Training Manager in the Medical Readiness Decision Support System (MRDSS).
