Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1.  Purpose.  This document provides airspace management instructions on creating and 
maintaining airspace that allows the USAF to meet operational needs for military readiness.  
This manual provides guidance for airspace planning compliance with Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) regulations, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 42 U.S.C. 
Section (§) 4321, et. seq., and other environmental guidance to include the Air Force’s Planning 
Requirements in the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (PREIAP).  Additionally, this 
document outlines the Director of Training and Readiness (AF/A3T) airspace review process as 
required by Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section (§) 989.28, Airspace and 
Range Proposals, current edition. 
1.2.  Scope.  This manual applies to the Department of the Air Force services (USAF and USSF), 
each Major Command (MAJCOM), and Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) functioning as the 
USAF/USSF component of a unified command, the NGB, AFR, and subordinate units. 
1.2.1.  USSF has responsibility over Space Force installations and activity.  The services will 
work cooperatively under Headquarters Air Force (HAF) direction to meet the requirements 
contained in this manual.  USSF has a close relationship with USAF activity and support 
responsibilities.  USAF and USSF relationships and lines of responsibility are still being 
determined and will be updated in this manual as they become known.  To the maximum 
extent possible USSF intends to leverage USAF expertise and requirements. 
1.2.2.  For the purposes of this AFMAN, NGB refers to the ANG component and shall be 
treated as a MAJCOM.  Due to the distinctive structure of the NGB, some functions 
described in this AFMAN are delegated to the NGB in accordance with 32 CFR § 989.3, 
Responsibilities, current edition to serve as lead staff organization (see NGB supplement to 
AFMAN 13-201 for additional details).  In each case, close coordination with the HAF 
counterpart is required. 
1.2.3.  DRUs are units that report directly to HAF without benefit of MAJCOM assistance.  
DRUs may require airspace and range management on a case-by-case basis, but are most 
often tenant units whose airspace actions are processed through host unit and MAJCOM 
channels.  If DRUs have airspace and range responsibilities, they will comply with all 
requirements of a MAJCOM as outlined in this manual.  (T-2). 
1.3.  Military Airspace:  Generally, military airspace is established for National Defense, 
National Security, and/or National Welfare under the authority of the FAA.  The USAF 
categorizes military airspace into two types of airspace: Special Use Airspace (SUA) and other 
airspace for military use. 
1.3.1.  SUA is airspace of defined dimensions identified by an area on the surface of the earth 
wherein activities must be confined because of their nature and/or wherein limitations may 
be imposed upon aircraft operations that are not part of those activities.  SUA includes the 
following types of charted airspace: Military Operations Area (MOA), Restricted Area (RA), 
Warning Area, Alert Area, Prohibited Area, and National Security Area (NSA).  Controlled 
Firing Areas are the seventh type of SUA but are not published on aeronautical charts. 
6 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
1.3.2.  The following are additional types of non-SUA airspaces used for military activities: 
Aerial Refueling (AR) Tracks/Anchors, Air Traffic Control Assigned Area (ATCAA), Low 
Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) areas, Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR), Orbit 
Areas, Military Training Route (MTR) (Instrument Route (IR) and Visual Route (VR)), and 
Slow Route (SR).  LATNs and SRs do not require coordination with the FAA for 
establishment.  These airspaces are contained solely in military documents, either locally at 
the unit or within Department of Defense (DoD) Flight Information Publications (FLIPs). 
1.3.2.1.  Low-Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Area: MAJCOMs will determine 
establishment criteria.  There is no required coordination with the FAA.  LATN areas are 
not published on aeronautical charts.  Environmental documentation in accordance with 
Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process 
(EIAP), current edition, is required. 
1.3.2.2.  Send copies of LATN areas to the appropriate Air Force Representatives 
(AFREP). 
1.3.2.3.  A full description of the LATN area(s) and any restrictions will be maintained in 
the Operations Support Tactics office. 
1.3.3.  Special Activity Airspace is established by the FAA for scheduling purposes and shall 
be scheduled by Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE) system.  (T-1). These include some 
SUA and other airspace for military use including the following airspace types: RAs, 
Prohibited Areas, MOAs, ATCAAs, Warning Areas, TFRs, AR Tracks, stationary Altitude 
Reservations (ALTRVs), orbit areas, temporary SUAs, IRs and VRs, and the Special Flight 
Rules Area in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. 
1.4.  Joint Use Airspace Policy (Military/Civilian):  Military users shall schedule only that 
airspace required for mission accomplishment (to include weather back-up if conditions dictate) 
and release the airspace to the FAA or host nation (HN) in a timely manner when not in use or no 
longer required.  (T-0). 
1.5.  Waivers and Exemptions:  Waivers to this manual are authorized and are processed in 
accordance with DAFI 33-360.  For compliance items not identified with a Tier number, waiver 
authority is delegated to the Headquarters Air Force Operational Training Infrastructure Division 
(AF/A3TI).  Non-Tiered and Tier 0 compliance items must be coordinated through the 
MAJCOM before they are submitted to AF/A3TI for action.  For Tier 1 compliance items, 
publication approval authority concurrence coordination for this manual is delegated to 
AF/A3TI.  At the unit level, the Airspace Manager should monitor implementation of this 
manual and review authorized waivers anytime the circumstances that prompted the waiver or 
the impacts of the excepted activity change substantially.  NOTE: Attachment 2 and 
Attachment 3 contain waiver request formats; waivers to 14 CFR are addressed in Chapter 4.  
Exemptions are permanent exceptions to a specific requirement and will be granted when the 
conditions cannot be alleviated and increased risk is acceptable. 
1.5.1.  Waiver requests.  Waiver requests must include the information specified in DAFI 33-
360, para 1.9.4.2.  (T-1).  Additional content is at the discretion of the waiver authority. 
1.5.2.  Supersonic waiver information is located in Chapter 3.

1.6.  Supplements:  This publication may be supplemented at any level.  Supplements may 
change, or add procedures, as applicable, to this manual, but changes can be no less restrictive 
than this manual.  All supplements are published in accordance with DAFI 33-360 on www.e-
Publishing.af.mil. 
1.6.1.  For MAJCOM supplements, MAJCOMs must submit a copy to AF/A3TI for review 
and coordination prior to publication. 
1.6.2.  For wing or unit supplements, units must submit a copy to the MAJCOM for review 
and coordination prior to publication.  (T-1).  When wing or unit supplements require update 
due to a significant change in airspace operations, submit an updated supplement to the 
MAJCOM within 120 days of signature.  (T-1).

Chapter 2 
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
2.1.  Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF):  The SECAF approves broad policy for Air Force 
use of National Airspace System (NAS) resources to ensure Force Readiness, and reviews all 
proposed airspace actions prior to entering the Environmental Impact Analysis Process. 
2.2.  Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations, Environmental & 
Logistics (SAF/IE):  SAF/IE develops planning policy and oversight of the Environmental 
Impact Analysis Process.  Consistent with 32 CFR Part 989 and HAF Mission Directive 
(HAFMD) 1-18 Assistant Secretary Of The Air Force (Installations, Environment And Energy), 
SAF/IE approves and signs (or designates signatory for) all Records of Decision for airspace 
actions. 
2.3.  Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations (AF/A3):  HAF Mission Directive 1-54, Deputy 
Chief of Staff, Operations, and AFPD 13-2 designate the AF/A3 as the office of primary 
responsibility for airspace issues. 
2.4.  Director of Training and Readiness (AF/A3T):  HAFMD 1-54 further designates the 
AF/A3T responsible for matters pertaining to airspace and ranges. 
2.5.  Operational Training Infrastructure Division (AF/A3TI) Responsibilities:  AF/A3TI is 
designated the focal point for USAF airspace and range policy and management.  AF/A3TI shall: 
2.5.1.  Develop and provide guidance for airspace and range policy, programming, and 
requirements. 
2.5.2.  Conduct the Airspace Request Review Panel (ARRP).  The ARRP is an O-6 level 
forum from across the HAF by which the AF/A3T reviews airspace and range actions in 
accordance with 32 CFR § 989.28 prior to public release.  The ARRP reviews airspace action 
requirements and reasonable alternatives to apply a DoD-wide review to ensure defendable 
requirements are met while minimizing or mitigating adverse impacts to the NAS and the 
environment.  The ARRP provides a forum for the proponent MAJCOM to present airspace 
concepts, prior to A3T adjudication.  This allows linking of mission and Combatant 
Commander’s requirements to volume, proximity, time, and attributes of airspace to support 
any given mission.  For non-SUA airspace and temporary airspace actions an electronic 
ARRP will be conducted and feedback will be provided back to the proponent following 
review of documents provided.  Temporary airspaces will be approved by the ARRP for the 
initial proposal; subsequent requests for the same temporary airspace will be briefed at the 
ARRP for situational awareness only.  Proponent MAJCOM/A3 will provide memorandum 
to the AF/A3T stating that the attributes of the temporary airspace are identical to previous 
submissions.  The ARRP uses the Strategic Airspace Action Process (SAAP) as described in 
Chapter 3 to accomplish this review process. 
2.5.2.1.  The ARRP is chaired by the Deputy Chief, Operational Training Infrastructure 
Division (AF/A3TI).

2.6.2.23.  Coordinate as necessary with MAJCOMs for Air Traffic Representatives 
(ATREPs) visits and evaluations of USAF ATC facilities in accordance with FAA Order 
JO 7610.4. 
2.7.  MAJCOM Airspace Manager Responsibilities:  Each MAJCOM that manages, utilizes, 
or has a potential requirement for military airspace shall appoint an Airspace Manager to perform 
the following: 
2.7.1.  Ensure airspace is used in accordance with FAA regulations and publications, USAF 
and DoD directives as listed in Attachment 1 of this publication.  Also, in accordance with 
host nation (HN) Aeronautical Information Publications (AIPs), International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) rules and practices, unified and specified command directives, and 
letters of agreement for conducting operational activities. 
2.7.2.  Serve as the focal point for coordinating and processing command airspace 
requirements.  The MAJCOM Airspace Manager interacts with other MAJCOMs, AF/A3TI, 
unified combatant or specified commands, other military department airspace related 
activities, HN teams (United States (US) Embassy Defense Attaché Office, or liaison office, 
where established, and with the AFREP for FAA matters. 
2.7.3.  Certify annual airspace utilization reports for completeness and accuracy. 
2.7.4.  Review and validate all airspace proposals to ensure a valid requirement prior to 
submission of new or modified airspace and ranges to AF/A3TI (ARRP) and/or formal FAA 
consideration.  Airspace Managers will track the status of all concepts and formal proposals, 
and schedule and provide briefings to HAF organizations as required.  MAJCOM airspace 
managers shall send HAF a graphical representation of their LATNs. 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
13 
2.7.5.  Assist units in the preparation of airspace Test/Training Space Need Statement 
(T/TSNS).  NOTE:  See Chapter 3 (Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, 
and all US territories only). 
2.7.6.  Ensure units have coordinated with other DoD agencies (HN for outside of the 
Continental United States (OCONUS) units) for use of existing SUA before attempting to 
establish new or modify airspace. 
2.7.7.  Ensure airspace managers at appropriate levels of command actively participate in all 
planning initiatives requiring requisition or alteration of military airspace.  Notify AFREPs of 
such initiatives at the earliest opportunity and include them in planning meetings as 
appropriate (CONUS, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Alaska only). 
2.7.8.  Proceed as the proponent for airspace initiatives and ensure the Environmental Impact 
Analysis Process is initiated at the earliest possible time to avoid unnecessary delays, 
consistent with 32 CFR Part 989 for airspace initiatives (CONUS, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto 
Rico, and Alaska only). 
2.7.8.1.  The proponent of the airspace proposal is responsible for complying with the 
Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) and shall ensure integration of the EIAP 
during the initial planning stages of proposed action so that planning and decisions reflect 
environmental values, delays are avoided later in the process, and potential conflicts are 
precluded (32 CFR § 989.3(d)). 
2.7.8.2.  The proponent is supported by the Environmental Planning Function (EPF) (32 
CFR § 989.3(e)).  Proponents should consult with the EPF and apply the fundamentals of 
PREIAP. 
2.7.8.3.  The proponent’s Test/Training Space Needs Statement (T/TSNS) is the 
foundational document that will evolve into the NEPA Description of Proposed Action 
and Alternatives (DOPAA).  Before preparation of the DOPAA, airspace proposals 
require HAF/A3T review in accordance with 32 CFR § 989.28.  The preparation of the 
T/TSNS and HAF/A3T review are integral to SAAP as described in paragraph 3.1 of 
this manual. 
2.7.9.  Ensure aeronautical proposals are complete prior to forwarding to the AFREPs.  
Environmental documentation should accompany all proposals to join the airspace proposal 
at the FAA Service Area (CONUS, Hawaii, Alaska, and all US territories only). 
2.7.10.  Coordinate matters affecting airspace management with the service area AFREP.  
Solicit AFREP assistance in negotiating and coordinating military airspace proposals. 
2.7.11.  Provide the AFREP details of any substantial change in the use of a military or joint 
use airfield, landing area, or missile/rocket site including any substantial change in the type 
of air vehicle, concept of operation, traffic pattern flow, volume of activity, and activation or 
deactivation.  At overseas locations, excluding Alaska, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii, 
coordinate through host nation, (Sub) Unified Command, and country team channels. 
2.7.12.  Ensure military airspace documentation required by this AFMAN is accomplished by 
the subordinate units that have scheduling responsibility for SUA. 
2.7.13.  Ensure units file SUA utilization reports according to this AFMAN (Chapter 5) and 
FAA Order JO 7400.2 (does not apply in areas outside FAA jurisdiction). 
14 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
2.7.14.  Include an airspace management overview in MAJCOM, DRU, or Numbered Air 
Force orientation courses or programs for newly assigned wing, operations group, and flying 
squadron commanders as needed. 
2.7.15.  Send information to the theater commander, AF/A3TI, and other component 
commanders when theater/host nation airspace policy differs from USAF policy.  NOTE: 
USAF airspace policy does not override theater or host nation airspace policy. 
2.7.16.  Coordinate with the US Embassy Defense Attaché Office or theater commander’s 
airspace control representatives when establishing an ATC and airspace liaison activity with 
host-nation agencies or facilities affecting USAF operations. 
2.7.17.  Ensure airspace managers assist unit Training and Standardization/Evaluation offices 
in educating aircrew about operating in accordance with the DoD speed exemption to Title 
14, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 91.117, Aircraft Speed, current edition, (CONUS, 
Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Alaska only).  NOTE: FAA speed exemption can be found 
in Appendix 4 of FAA Order JO 7610.4. 
2.7.18.  Ensure alleged pilot deviation packages are completed by the unit in a timely manner 
and forwarded to the AFREP.  Include details of corrective actions if the alleged violation is 
substantiated (CONUS, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Alaska only).  Procedures for 
addressing alleged pilot deviation packages for the ANG wings will be spelled out in the 
AFMAN 13-201 NGB Supplement. 
2.7.19.  Encourage unit airspace managers to participate in Midair Collision Avoidance 
(MACA) programs in accordance with AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention 
Program. 
2.7.20.  Assist base-level EPFs with determining the potential NEPA ramifications of a 
proposed airspace action. 
2.7.21.  Ensure Airspace Manager Special Experience Identifier (SEI) “OUL” is awarded to 
officers and “350” is awarded to enlisted personnel in accordance with AFI 36-2101, 
Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  Accurate awarding of SEIs ensures 
experienced airspace managers are identified for airspace management assignments (N/A for 
NGB and AFR).  NOTE: Airspace managers require 6 months of consecutive experience in 
airspace management and completion of the USAF Military Airspace Management course. 
2.7.22.  Ensure on-the-job training programs for newly assigned unit airspace managers are 
established for all MAJCOM units with emphasis on unit specific airspace policies, plans, 
and procedures.  (T-3).  Wing airspace managers should complete the training program 
within the first 6 months of being assigned airspace manager duties and ensure the proper 
SEI (if applicable) is assigned in the individual's personnel records.  (T-3).  See Attachment 
7 for recommended training program content (Not applicable to NGB and AFR). 
 
 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
15 
2.7.23.  Ensure airspace managers advise operations personnel to assist the Base Civil 
Engineer Squadron in establishing and maintaining (where applicable) an active Air 
Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) program by providing flying operations data 
required for developing noise contours.  Support development of maximum feasible land use 
compatibility between air installations and neighboring communities according to policy and 
guidance issued by AF/A4CI.  For specific information on the AICUZ program, see AFI 32-
1015, Integrated Installation Planning and AFH 32-7084, AICUZ Program Manager’s 
Guide. 
2.7.24.  May serve as a member of the MAJCOM Mission Sustainment Team and coordinate 
as necessary with AF/A3 in supporting the AF Mission Sustainment Working Group in 
accordance with AFI 90-2001 Mission Sustainment and 32 CFR Part 211 Clearinghouse 
Implementing Regulation.  May also serve as the MAJCOM focal point to coordinate 
informal and formal review of projects/filings required for submission through the FAA 
Obstruction Evaluation/Airport Airspace Analysis (OE/AAA) and participate on Mitigation 
Response Teams authorized by the DoD Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting 
Clearinghouse.  This function may be accomplished by another office (e.g., mission 
sustainment, encroachment) within the MAJCOM in which case coordination with that office 
is important. 
2.8.  AF NEPA Center (AFCEC/CZN) / NGB/A4 Responsibilities:  (NGB/A4 assists the 
ANG proponent in meeting EIAP requirements and has the EPF responsibility for NGB airspace 
actions, see ANG supplement to AFMAN 13-201 for more details). 
2.8.1.  AFCEC/CZN acts as the MAJCOM EPF and assists the proponent in meeting 
requisite EIAP requirements. 
2.8.2.  Proponents identify EIAP requirements to EPFs at installation level and/or 
AFCEC/CZN in advance of required execution in accordance with the Program Objective 
Memorandum cycle.  Requirements that are not identified and budgeted through the Program 
Objective Memorandum process are, by default, funded by the proponent organization. 
2.8.3.  Proponents will coordinate with AF/A3TI, AF/A4CIB, and AFCEC/CZN to determine 
modifications of the normal EIAP to protect classified information and define procedures for 
specific classified actions, in furtherance of Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 
989.26, Classified Actions (40 CFR § 1507.3(c)), current edition. 
2.9.  Airspace Regional Councils (ARC):  NGB sponsors one national and three regional ARCs 
per year.  The ANG will describe the ARC charter in a Supplement to AFMAN 13-201.  The 
ARCs are forums for ANG leadership and airspace managers to meet with sister services, FAA, 
and industry partners to discuss best practices, challenges, and other relevant issues affecting 
new and proposed airspace modifications as well as all aspects of military airspace.  Participation 
by SAF, HAF, MAJCOM, wing leadership, wing airspace managers is encouraged.

Chapter 3 
PROCESSING AIRSPACE ACTIONS 
3.1.  Strategic Airspace Action Process (SAAP):  The SAAP is the process through which the 
AF/A3T reviews airspace actions in accordance with 32 CFR § 989.28.  In order to build public 
awareness and ensure the accuracy of information disseminated, the USAF encourages public 
access to an unprecedented amount of information on airspace actions.  SAAP is conducted in 
two phases.  First is the Concept Phase, in which the T/TSNS is proposed, developed and 
adjudicated by the AF/A3T.  Second is the Proposal Phase, in which the T/TSNS is developed 
into the Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA) as described in the Planning 
Requirements in the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (PREIAP).  The DOPAA (normally 
expressed as chapters 1 and 2 of an environmental document) is developed and internal scoping 
activity managed by the proponent and the EPF.  Once the DOPAA is stabilized, an engagement 
plan is created and executed followed by the NEPA process as outlined in 32 CFR Part 989. 
Figure 3.1.  Strategic Airspace Action Process. 
 
 
 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
17 
3.1.1.  Concept Phase.  Airspace actions in this phase of development should be referred to as 
“concepts,” since there is no assurance that the initiative will be developed into a formal 
action.  At a minimum, concepts should include a problem statement (what is not being 
accomplished and why) and how to fulfill this need based on volume, proximity, time, and 
attributes.  General public release should not occur during this phase, as concepts may 
change frequently and proliferation of misinformation can be damaging to the overall effort.  
During informal liaison with stakeholders (e.g., federal agencies, state agencies, civic groups, 
aviation businesses, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, ballooning clubs, hang gliding 
clubs, skydiving companies, renewable energy developers, offshore oil and gas developers), 
use of the term “concept” ensures all parties understand the initiative is flexible in nature and 
will not be confused with a formal aeronautical proposal. 
3.1.1.1.  Test/Training Space is defined as air, land, or sea that is used to conduct military 
test, training, or operational activities.  Using a T/TSNS, proponents describe the 
operational requirements, initial concept, potential alternatives, and a review of other 
known potential interests.  Actions to establish or modify military airspace, as defined in 
paragraph 1.3, except those purely administrative in nature, will be developed by the 
unit, validated by the MAJCOM, evaluated by the Airspace Request Review Panel 
(ARRP) (including the AFREPs), and adjudicated by AF/A3T (CONUS, Hawaii, Guam, 
Puerto Rico, and Alaska only).  (T-1). Coordination should include the MAJCOM offices 
responsible for Environment Analysis, Legal, and PA offices. 
3.1.1.2.  All modifications to military airspace (except Aerial Refueling (AR) 
Tracks/Anchors and Orbit Areas) will be reviewed by the ARRP.  Changes to military 
airspace that do not expand the physical dimensions, altitudes, times of use, or reverse the 
direction of an MTR (e.g., changing the designation of the controlling or using agency, 
correction of typographical errors in the published description, Letter of Agreement 
(LOA) procedural changes, etc.) will be reviewed by the MAJCOM, but do not require a 
T/TSNS.  (T-2). 
3.1.1.2.1.  Temporary airspace actions jointly determined by the proponent MAJCOM 
and A3TI to be non-controversial or to which a CATEX can reasonably be applied, 
will be referred to an electronic ARRP. 
3.1.1.2.2.  AF/A3TI will provide an initial response to the proponent within 30 days 
of submission. 
3.1.1.3.  The T/TSNS shall provide clarity, depth, and scope sufficient to enable a 
reasonable review and assessment.  Development of the T/TSNS should be an "in-house" 
effort.  The general format for a T/TSNS is as follows: 
3.1.1.3.1.  Title.  The title of the T/TSNS should consist of a concise description of 
the airspace proposal.  Include the T/TSNS proponent’s name and phone number on 
the title page. 
3.1.1.3.2.  Operational Requirement/Justification.  Describe specific requirement(s) 
driving the action.  Explain the unit’s mission, operational requirements not currently 
being met, other units affected, weapon system characteristics, and coordination 
accomplished to date. 
18 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
3.1.1.3.3.  Concept.  Briefly describe the concept.  Include maps illustrating current 
and future airspace/range configuration to include altitudes, legend, and a scale.  The 
concept should detail who wants to do what, where, and why, including objectives of 
the action.  Include boundary dimensions and description (nautical miles (NM) x 
NM), the volume (e.g., 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) to flight level (FL) 600), 
proximity to the installation, time (frequency and periods of use, e.g., 0800-2200 
Monday-Friday), and attributes (e.g., use of chaff and flares, supersonic, threats, 
targets, frequency spectrum, mountainous terrain, etc.).  This concept should not be 
so detailed as to prematurely eliminate potentially reasonable alternatives. 
3.1.1.3.4.  Alternatives.  Briefly list the alternatives to the concept including a “No 
Action” alternative.  Reasonable alternatives include those that are practical or 
feasible from a common sense, technical, and economic standpoint.  In developing 
alternatives, consider alternatives that may be procedural or non-material in nature 
(e.g., renegotiation of LOAs with sister services or the FAA or implementation of 
seasonally-based deconfliction procedures during peak use periods).  “No Action” 
means the continuation of present management activities without implementing the 
concept.  Impacts may include quantifiable degradation to training, inability to meet 
mission objectives or higher headquarters direction, inefficiencies, costs, etc.  If 
applicable, include a section that addresses “Actions Considered but Not Carried 
Forward” with the rationale as to why these options do not meet requirements. 
3.1.1.3.5.  Air Traffic Control Coordination.  Coordinate with DoD/FAA ATC 
facilities prior to forwarding the T/TSNS.  Informal discussions with ATC facilities 
may provide guidance on how the T/TSNS will impact air traffic flow for the affected 
area.  List any concerns voiced by the ATC facilities in this section. 
3.1.1.3.6.  Other Interest Potential.  T/TSNS actions have the potential to raise 
controversial issues, reaching to the national level, very early in the planning process.  
Therefore, it is critical that USAF planning and review processes are as thorough as 
possible, with involvement of concerned parties, public and private, early in the 
decision phase.  Public involvement and notification of airspace actions and proposals 
is not only a legal requirement, but an effective way to increase the probability of 
success.  USAF proponents should develop a plan to involve groups with competing 
interests early in the process.  Use all available resources (e.g., base environmental 
planning with Civil Engineers, PREIAP and AFCEC/CN staff, subject matter 
expertise, previous environmental actions, etc.) to identify potential competing 
interests from stakeholders that may be impacted by this action.  Briefly state in bullet 
format whether the concept or any of the alternatives may impact recreational areas 
(e.g., federal, state, and local parks); Native American reservations, lands, or areas of 
special interest; grazing or farming; endangered species; wildlife refuges; 
consultation with other state/federal agencies; archaeological sites; hunting and 
fishing areas; population centers, communities, previously identified or potential 
noise sensitive areas; ongoing litigation; other training space actions; and regional 
actions by other MAJCOMs or military departments.  Identify outside agencies that 
have requested or would support the concept (federal, state, local, and/or stakeholder 
groups) and if any coordination has been completed to date. 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
19 
3.1.1.4.  Airspace proposals are closely scrutinized by the public; as such, it is imperative 
that a T/TSNS is based upon valid and defendable operational/training requirements.  The 
MAJCOM/A3 will evaluate each T/TSNS to validate the requirements.  If a T/TSNS 
affects more than one MAJCOM, then one MAJCOM will be designated the proponent 
MAJCOM.  Close coordination may be required at the unit, base, and MAJCOM levels to 
ensure a successful, coordinated action.  Each action has its own characteristics and roles, 
and must be clearly defined in the original scoping.  As an example, if “MAJCOM A” 
requires additional airspace to operate from “MAJCOM B’s” installation, normally 
MAJCOM A will be the proponent working closely with MAJCOM B’s unit and base 
organizations and coordinating with MAJCOM B’s A3 directorate. 
3.1.1.5.  Upon completion of the MAJCOM validation, the T/TSNS will be forwarded to 
A3TI to begin the A3T’s adjudication.  This adjudication process has three steps; a 
review by the other MAJCOMs, TAGs, and AFREPs; followed by a review by the 
ARRP; and lastly a final adjudication by the A3T.  This adjudication will primarily 
consider if the requirement is valid and defendable.  However, airspace design, analysis 
of alternatives, practicality, and future force structure, etc., will be considered.  This final 
adjudication allows the concept to proceed to the Proposal Phase. 
3.1.1.5.1.  The T/TSNS will be sent to the AFREPs, all MAJCOMs, and affected 
TAGs (via NGB/A3) for their coordination.  (T-1). AFREPs will review the T/TSNS 
with other service area MILREPs to determine impacts, if any, to other service 
airspace actions.  Results will be referred to the ARRP. 
3.1.1.5.2.  The ARRP is chaired by the AF/A3TI and its members will include, at a 
minimum, Military & Civilian Aviation Integration Division (AF/A3OJ), Planning 
Division Office of the Air Force Civil Engineer (AF/A4CI), the AF NEPA Center 
(AFCEC/CZN), AF General Counsel Environment and Installations Law office 
(SAF/GCN), Air Force Environmental Law and Litigation Division (AF/JAOE), 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations (SAF/IEI), Air Force 
Public Affairs Current Operations (SAF/PAO) (if applicable), and Air Force 
International Affairs (SAF/IA) (if applicable). 
3.1.1.5.3.  After a successful review by the MAJCOMs, TAGs, AFREPs, and ARRP, 
the T/TSNS will be forwarded to the AF/A3T for final adjudication. 
3.1.1.6.  Initial HAF review shall be completed within 60 calendar days of AF/A3TI 
receipt.  Final T/TSNS adjudication from AF/A3T may exceed the 60 calendar days, in 
which case the MAJCOM will be notified by AF/A3TI.  HAF will identify issues during 
the initial review.  If either the validating MAJCOM or HAF determine the T/TSNS to be 
insufficiently supported by defendable requirements, it will be returned to the originator 
with specific issues identified for further examination. 
3.1.1.7.  The final step in the concept phase is the determination if an EA or EIS analysis 
is required.  If a Categorical Exclusion (CATEX) is appropriate, then MAJCOMs have 
authority under current USAF policy to apply using the AF Form 813 Request For 
Environmental Impact Analysis.  If an EA/EIS is required, then the concept will be 
briefed to the SAF/IEI for approval before public involvement. 
20 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
3.1.2.  Proposal Phase.  With final adjudication from AF/A3T (or SAF/IEI if required), the 
proposed action described on the T/TSNS moves into the Proposal Phase to initiate PREIAP 
and produce and stabilize the Draft DOPAA.  The Draft DOPAA covers the same subject 
matter as the T/TSNS; however, it expands upon the T/TSNS basic elements and is expected 
to address all items of the proposal in the level of detail required to begin the environmental 
phase. 
3.1.2.1.  The unit or MAJCOM acting as the proponent, completes AF Form 813 as per 
32 CFR Part 989 to initiate the PREIAP with the EPF (installation, NGB, and/or AF 
NEPA Center) to produce the Draft DOPAA and other data.  As part of the PREIAP, the 
proponent MAJCOM/A3 will evaluate and approve each Draft DOPAA to ensure it is in 
accordance with established, current requirements.  In a case where multiple MAJCOMs 
are involved in an airspace action, additional MAJCOMs (non-proponent) will also 
coordinate on the DOPAA. 
3.1.2.2.  Restricted Area proposals requesting designation from the surface will indicate 
that the proponent owns, leases, or by agreement controls the underlying surface.  (T-0).  
Failure to do so prior to submission of the proposal may delay processing. 
3.1.2.3.  Engagement Planning.  Units should begin the development of the engagement 
plan as early as possible to ensure that a final plan is ready for execution shortly after the 
proposal is briefed to the SAF/IEI.  (T-2).  After SAF/IEI approval, first notification of 
the concept should be made to the affected area’s congressional delegation(s), which will 
be coordinated through AF/A3TI to SAF/LL channels (NGB/LL for NGB airspace 
issues) (CONUS, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Alaska only).  Notification to affected 
TAGs will be made following congressional notification.  These notifications should take 
place prior to public notification.  Public engagement will take place as directed in AFI 
35-108, Environmental Public Affairs, and in accordance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 as promulgated in 32 CFR Part 989. 
3.1.2.4.  NEPA Compliance.  Airspace and range actions are subject to environmental 
analysis in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  
MAJCOMs develop concepts (including the aeronautical proposal) that concern airspace 
under FAA jurisdiction according to the procedures outlined in FAA Order JO 7400.2 
and FAA Order JO 7610.4 (CONUS, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Alaska only).  
Overseas units will coordinate with host nation and/or liaison officers regarding proposed 
airspace actions.  (T-0). Once the concept is recommended by the SAF/IEI in accordance 
with paragraph 3.1.1.7, MAJCOMs submit USAF airspace actions (both environmental 
analysis and aeronautical proposals) to the FAA through the AFREP. 
3.2.  Processing airspace action after SAAP:  Upon competition of SAAP, the proposed 
airspace action must complete two parallel processes before the action will be finalized and 
published.  (T-0)  The first is the Air Force decision process under the NEPA which analyzes the 
actions for impacts and provides the decision maker with the facts to come to an informed 
conclusion.  The second process concerns the aeronautical proposal which is the legal description 
used by the FAA as outlined in FAA Order JO 7400.2. 
 
 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
21 
3.2.1.  NEPA is the process by which federal agencies make major decisions.  In accordance 
with the FAA Order JO 7400.2, normally AF initiated airspace action to support AF 
requirements designates the AF as the lead agency and asks the FAA to serve as a 
cooperating agency.  Other federal agencies (e.g., the Bureau of Land Management, National 
Park Service, sister services) may also be asked to serve as cooperating agencies. 
3.2.2.  The Air Force NEPA policy is delineated in 32 CFR Part 989, Environmental Impact 
Analysis Process (EIAP).  The AFCEC replaced the environmental planning function (EPF) 
at the MAJCOM level (except the ANG) and should be consulted on all airspace actions.  
The initial step of EIAP is to determine which of the three levels of analysis is required: 
Categorical Exclusion (CATEX), EA, or EIS. 
3.2.2.1.  A CATEX is the lowest form of analysis, should be considered first, and is listed 
in 32CFR Part 989, Appendix B.  Once a potential CATEX is identified, the EPF will 
conduct an analysis to ensure there are no unique impacts that would preclude use of the 
CATEX.  As an example (and not limited to these examples), items to consider for 
uniqueness are: greater scope or size than generally experienced in other actions; 
presence of threatened or endangered species, archaeological remains, historical sites, or 
other protected resources; adversely affecting areas of critical environmental concern, 
such as prime or unique agricultural lands, wetlands, coastal zones, wilderness areas, 
floodplains, or wild and scenic river areas; or disproportionately high and adverse human 
health or environmental effects on minority populations or low-income populations.  If 
the EPF determines there is no unique circumstances that would prohibit the application 
of the CATEX, the EPF should coordinate with the cooperating agency to determine that 
agency has a CATEX that can be applied to the action.  If the Air Force decides to rely on 
a CATEX for its action and the cooperating agency cannot rely on a CATEX for its 
action, the Air Force will provide information and analysis the cooperating agency 
identifies as necessary for the cooperating agency's NEPA review.  The cooperating 
agency may request that the Air Force prepare an EA or fund the preparation of an EA or 
EIS. 
3.2.2.2.  Environmental Assessments are utilized for actions which do not require an EIS, 
cannot be categorically excluded, and end with a Finding of No Significant Impact 
(FONSI).  Currently, the FAA (routinely a cooperating agency) normally requires an EA 
for SUA in accordance with FAA Order JO 1050.1, Environmental Impacts: Policies and 
Procedures. 
3.2.2.3.  If the airspace action creates a potential significant impact, cannot achieve a 
FONSI, or creates significant controversy, then an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
is appropriate.  The EIS will conclude with a Record of Decision (ROD).  Normally, after 
a ROD is established, the proponent unit will create and submit a Mitigation Monitoring 
Plan in accordance with 32 CFR Part 989 to ensure compliance with the EIS and ROD.  
The Mitigation Monitoring Plan compliance should be reviewed quarterly and be 
available to the public upon request.  As a technique, review of the Mitigation Monitoring 
Plan may be accomplished as part of the Airfield Operations Board. 
3.2.3.  In parallel with the decision process described in paragraph 3.2.2 above, the FAA 
processes an aeronautical proposal (AP) in accordance with FAA Order JO 7400.2 to comply 
with the FAA’s mandate of safe and efficient management of the NAS. 
22 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
3.2.3.1.  The progression of the EIAP and AP are not exclusive to each other and should 
be timed to conduct the aeronautical study and circularization required by the AP process 
during the public scoping/hearings required by EIAP. 
3.2.3.2.  in accordance with FAA Order JO 7400.2, an aeronautical proposal should be 
submitted to the FAA Service Center Airspace Specialist when the AF provides a draft 
environmental document to the FAA Service Center Environmental Specialist for their 
review.  The FAA will conduct an aeronautical study and Circularization (if applicable).  
Ideally, this will take place simultaneously with the Air Force’s development of the final 
environmental document.  Both the Air Force and FAA process may alter the final 
environmental document and help to develop an informed decision.  Once the 
environmental decision is made and adopted by the FAA, the aeronautical proposal is 
then final for the FAA to complete using either their rulemaking or non-rulemaking 
processes. 
3.3.  Processing a National Security Area Request:  NSA proposals should clearly state the 
rationale for the NSA requirement and the proposed boundaries of the NSA (include a map).  All 
NSA proposals should be coordinated through the installation airspace and ATC offices.  Unit 
airspace management offices shall coordinate with respective ATC and security forces offices.  
(T-1) If local ATC service is not provided by the requesting unit or host installation, coordinate 
the initiative with the ATC facility providing this service before forwarding to the 
wing/installation commander for approval. 
3.3.1.  Following wing/installation commander approval, all NSA proposals will be 
forwarded to the MAJCOM airspace management office for coordination, with an 
information copy to the AFREP.  (T-1). AFREPs will not take action on NSA proposals until 
formal coordination has been requested by AF/A3TI. 
3.3.2.  Once approved by the MAJCOM, forward the NSA proposal to AF/A3TI. 
3.3.3.  AF/A3TI will coordinate the proposal with SAF/GCN, AF/JAOE, and other HAF 
agencies as appropriate.  Once approved, AF/A3TI will forward the proposal to the AFREP 
for coordination with the FAA. 
3.3.4.  The USAF recognizes the potential vulnerability of certain facilities to threats from 
the air.  However, concerns about the effect of flight-restricted airspace on the NAS have 
traditionally outweighed the potential security benefits provided by such a designation.  
Based upon historic FAA responses to restricted flight over USAF installations/activities, 
units 
should 
not 
plan 
to 
permanently 
establish 
flight 
avoidance 
areas 
over 
installations/activities to satisfy local security requirements.  Should a specific and credible 
threat to an installation be identified, a TFR is the preferred alternative. 
3.4.  Letter of Agreement:  Develop actions that concern airspace under FAA jurisdiction 
according to the procedures outlined in FAA Order JO 7400.2 and FAA Order JO 7610.4.  
Additional information on creating a LOA with the FAA can be found in FAA Order JO 7210.3, 
Facility Operation and Administration and AFMAN 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures 
and Programs. 
 
 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020

3.5.  Supersonic Operations:  CONUS, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Alaska only. 
3.5.1.  Military supersonic operations are conducted under the authority of DoD as FAA 
authority for supersonic operations are limited to civilian operations.  Sonic booms from 
supersonic operations are considered noise and therefore may need both AF and FAA 
consideration during the NEPA process.  When operationally necessary, units must conduct a 
NEPA analysis and obtain authorization from the AF/A3O (or delegated authority as outlined 
below).  (T-0). 
3.5.2.  Supersonic consideration under NEPA for airspace should take place during initial 
analysis of new airspace or during analysis of beddown of new aircraft.  If supersonic 
operations are considered for existing airspace, units should consider using an existing 
CATEX in 32 CFR Part 989, Appendix B. 
3.5.3.  When considering supersonic operations, units must consider “Avoidance Locations,” 
as well as HAF specified critical areas listed in DoD Flight Information Publication AP/1B 
(FLIP AP/1B), Area Planning, Military Training Routes (North and South America) and plan 
to avoid areas of population concentration.  (T-3).  If planned operations are over open water 
areas, above 10,000 feet MSL and more than 15 NM from any land area or over land areas, 
above 30,000 feet MSL, approval authority is delegated to unit commander. 
3.5.4.  If units require supersonic flight operations outside the parameters above, submit a 
waiver request through the MAJCOM/A3 (include coordination with the MAJCOM and unit 
level EIAP program managers).  (T-1). Waiver requests shall include the appropriate level of 
environmental analysis and an airspace analysis documenting the requirement for existing 
and projected airspace utilization, availability, and deficiencies (see Attachment 2).  (T-1).  
Provide the material and waiver request to AF/A3TI for HAF review, coordination (AF/A4CI 
at a minimum), and approval.  Waivers will be valid for a period not to exceed three years. 
3.5.4.1.  Units will submit requests for supersonic tests/exercises of short duration (30 
days or less) through MAJCOM/A3 channels to AF/A3TI for approval (with AF/A4CI 
concurrence) at least 60 days prior to mission requirement date.  (T-1).  Accompany 
waiver requests with the appropriate level of environmental analysis (Environmental 
Assessment, unsigned Finding of No Significant Impact, or draft Environmental Impact 
Statement). 
3.5.4.2.  For recurring tests/exercises or tests/exercises of duration greater than 30 days, 
submit requests not later than 60 days prior to the mission start date.  (T-1). 
3.5.5.  The MAJCOM/A3, in coordination with the MAJCOM environmental office, will 
review and approve supersonic flying waivers for renewal every 3 years.  The review will be 
conducted to ensure operations, affected environments, and resulting impacts are consistent 
with the environmentally assessed and approved actions.  Evaluate all adopted mitigation 
measures and commitments made in initially approving the supersonic flying operations for 
compliance.  Detail changes to land use underneath the area of supersonic flight that have 
occurred since the original approval and include any updated environmental analysis.  
MAJCOM airspace management offices, environmental office, and other offices, as 
necessary, shall develop and maintain a management system for ensuring compliance and 
periodic monitoring. 
24 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
3.5.5.1.  MAJCOM Airspace Mangers will advise AF/A3TI of any environmental or 
operational condition warranting reconsideration of the decision approving supersonic 
flight operations (e.g., a different weapon system, environmental conditions, or a change 
in tactics).  (T-1). See Attachment 3. 
3.5.5.2.  If the waiver renewal is not completed prior to the 3 year expiration date, the 
controlling MAJCOM/A3 (with EPF coordination) is authorized to approve temporary 
continuation of existing supersonic operations below 30,000 feet MSL until the waiver is 
renewed.  All requirements and restrictions imposed by the original approval remain in 
effect. 
3.5.6.  MAJCOM airspace management offices shall notify AF/A3TI of MAJCOM/A3 
waiver renewals or temporary continuation of existing supersonic operations within 30 days 
and maintain supporting documents for a minimum of 6 years. 
3.5.7.  MAJCOM airspace managers will maintain a list of all airspace approved for 
supersonic operations to include waiver information.  This list will be forwarded to AF/A3TI 
no later than 1 November for the previous fiscal year. 
3.5.8.  Sonic Boom Events.  A sonic boom event is defined as an individual aircraft reaching 
the speed of sound (Mach 1.0) as recorded by the aircraft on board systems.  The 
characteristics of sonic booms are such that they may result in damage to property and may 
create an audible nuisance impact. 
3.5.8.1.  The USAF adjudicates sonic boom claims caused by Air Force, AFR, and ANG 
aircraft.  The Air Force staff judge advocate nearest the incident location normally 
investigates claims or complaints.  Commanders of units operating aircraft capable of 
supersonic flight or units that manage airspace used by such aircraft will establish 
internal methods to document supersonic flight activities over land or within 15 NM from 
any land area.  (T-1).  The remarks section in the Aircrew Resource Management System 
may be used for this purpose.  Training or scheduling/utilization tools are also acceptable.  
Minimum information to be retained includes callsign, type aircraft, unit, location of 
supersonic event, and route of flight in accordance with disposition schedule.  This data is 
not required for supersonic activity that is part of combat or combat support missions. 
3.5.8.2.  Acknowledgment of unauthorized supersonic activity will be made to the 
originating or scheduling activity of the airspace.  (T-1).  Identification of involved DoD 
aircraft permits the investigating judge advocate to confirm USAF involvement and 
obtain aircraft and flight data that are useful for computing the approximate magnitude of 
sonic booms. 
3.5.8.3.  If flight data is classified, pilots should provide the minimum information 
needed to identify the flight and home base.  Prompt acknowledgment of supersonic 
activity enables the judge advocate to conduct an immediate investigation, helps to 
promptly resolve pending claims, and enables PA officials to promptly respond to 
community and news media inquiries.

3.6.  SUA Review Teams:  The FAA SUA Review Program provides for a continuing review of 
all airspace allocations in accordance with FAA Order JO 7400.2.  To supplement routine 
airspace programs and the annual review afforded by Restricted Area/Military Operations Area 
utilization reports, the FAA may use SUA review teams as required to examine selected areas.  
These teams coordinate their visits to USAF units with the MAJCOM through the AFREP. 
3.6.1.  SUA review teams review selected areas, determine required actions, and recommend 
a plan for efficient and safe use of airspace.  They examine the current and planned use of 
SUA to minimize conflict with other airspace users.  Based on each user’s requirements and 
actual use of airspace, they evaluate the need to retain, change, revoke, or establish SUA.  
Consideration should be given to returning associated ATCAAs when returning MOAs to the 
NAS. 
3.6.2.  MAJCOMs should be prepared to consolidate and provide the teams detailed 
documentation regarding scheduling, utilization times, altitudes, geographical areas used, 
type of air activities conducted, and future use plans (for the ANG, units will provide this 
documentation through their respective Adjutant General (TAG)).  (T-2).  Address national 
security requirements at an unclassified level unless team member security clearance 
authorizations are appropriately verified prior to the team visit.  Military participation will be 
on a case-by-case basis. 
3.6.3.  Based upon the team's recommendations, the FAA, with military concurrence, may 
initiate procedural changes or airspace modifications. 
3.7.  Airspace Disposition Process:  Responsible stewardship of airspace resources involves 
identifying parcels of airspace no longer required by the USAF.  However, such airspace may 
meet the requirements of another user.  This process may be achieved through a Regional SUA 
Optimization Plan which involves coordination from all stakeholders.  Take the following steps 
to return unneeded airspace to the NAS: 
3.7.1.  Originating activity notifies the MAJCOM of intent to return airspace.  (T-2). 
3.7.2.  MAJCOMs solicit input from other units within the MAJCOM to determine if there 
are other USAF units with a need for the airspace.  If a requirement is identified, the 
MAJCOM will notify the AFREP of their intention to reassign the airspace.  AFREPs will 
assist with the FAA process.  NOTE:  Changes in use of airspace, other than administrative 
in nature, require environmental consideration per the EIAP. 
3.7.3.  If no requirement is identified within the MAJCOM, the MAJCOM will notify 
AF/A3TI, who will solicit input from other MAJCOMs. 
3.7.4.  If AF/A3TI determines there is no USAF requirement, they will notify the Airspace 
and Policy Subgroup of the PBFA to determine if there is any other DoD requirement.  If 
another Service has a need for the airspace, that Service assumes the lead for transferring the 
airspace.  If there is no requirement, AF/A3TI will initiate action through FAA/AJR-01 to 
return the airspace to the NAS.

DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
Chapter 4 
AIRSPACE PLANNING AND OPERATION 
4.1.  Importance of Effective Community Relations:  Effective community relations dictate 
mutual respect for, and recognition of, factors affecting or affected by USAF operations.  
Properly addressing community and stakeholder concerns or interest about current or proposed 
USAF operations can be greatly assisted through effective community relations.  Additionally, 
for new proposed airspace actions, community involvement activities are a requirement of the 
Environmental Impact Analysis Process, as described in 32 CFR Part 989.  Units must 
coordinate all community relations issues with the wing/installation or MAJCOM PA office, and 
the EPF office for new proposed airspace actions.  (T-2). 
4.1.1.  Commanders should highlight in their PA programs the need for operational readiness 
and actions that contribute to the state of readiness.  PA programs should fully explain all 
measures taken by the USAF to avoid or mitigate disturbances to civilian communities, 
especially those communities underlying or near military airspace.  Present this information 
not only to those communities in the immediate vicinity of the facility, but when applicable, 
to other stakeholders such as Indian Tribes, FAA, National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM), US Forest Service (USFS), US Fish and Wildlife Service 
(USFWS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), state aviation officials, and other bodies/groups 
focused on national aviation issues. 
4.1.2.  The USAF has a responsibility to protect the public, to the maximum extent 
practicable, from the hazards and effects associated with flight operations. 
4.1.2.1.  Units must be sensitive to USAF environmental and safety responsibilities and 
to the concerns of affected communities and aviation groups.  Evaluation of flight 
activities will be an agenda item for the airspace manager at the wing Airfield Operations 
Board at least annually and meeting minutes may serve as documentation of the annual 
evaluation (T-3). 
4.1.2.2.  Review the effects of mission changes.  Changes to air operations are likely to 
cause public concern or comment regarding environmental impacts and require 
environmental analysis as prescribed in 32 CFR Part 989. 
4.1.3.  It is important for the USAF to recognize and communicate to the public the 
difference between an “operational impact” and a “readiness impact.”  Although a particular 
public concern may have an impact on operations (routes, altitudes, turn points, etc.), the 
potential change to operations may not impact readiness.  Conversely, a proposed restriction 
that would prohibit a bomber wing from dropping training ordnance could clearly affect the 
readiness of that unit.  Recognizing the difference between these two concepts may create an 
opportunity for cooperation in negotiating or mitigating airspace issues. 
4.1.4.  Readily available public information can be helpful in gaining support for USAF air 
operations.  Units will: 
4.1.4.1.  Establish a program to distribute information on military airspace and supersonic 
areas.  (T-2). Ensure coordination with the appropriate FAA facility (CONUS, Hawaii, 
Guam, Puerto Rico and Alaska only).  (T-2). 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
27 
4.1.4.2.  Develop an explanatory letter outlining the purpose, routes, areas, altitudes, 
intensity, day, and time of use of the areas or routes and location of existing operating 
areas or routes in the vicinity.  (T-2). Use aids such as charts, photographs, and/or film 
footage for visual clarification.  Send the letter and appropriate visual materials through 
PA for release to appropriate community news media.  (T-2).  Send this information to 
each interested stakeholder.  (T-2).  
4.1.4.3.  Provide PA offices with information to be used in news releases for new areas 
and routes or major modifications to existing ones.  (T-2).  Provide additional 
information for follow-up news releases as required.  (T-2).  
4.1.4.4.  Ensure community and news media inquiries on changes to operations areas or 
routes are answered promptly.  (T-2). 
4.1.5.  Because of increased public and political sensitivities associated with military 
airspace, appropriate congressional offices should be informed of significant emerging 
mission requirements at the earliest opportunity.  Furthermore, to promote a better 
understanding of the USAF’s flying mission and to prepare congressional offices to address 
public comments, timely and accurate responses to congressional inquiries is paramount. 
4.1.5.1.  AF/A3TI will be the A3 focal point for inquiries received at the HAF and will 
coordinate through the MAJCOM airspace or range management function for 
inputs/responses to inquiries (congressional inquiries involving the ANG will be routed 
through NGB/LL). 
4.1.5.2.  Avoid referring callers to other military departments or government agencies 
without first attempting to answer questions concerning aircraft noise through all 
available means. NOTE:  The intent of this paragraph is not to circumvent or supersede 
the MAJCOM or unit PA office role in these issues.  PA should be provided the 
opportunity to coordinate on responses to all Congressional inquiries. 
4.1.6.  State Adjutants General are important resources for MAJCOMs as an entry point to 
state executive and legislative branches.  Informing state governmental organizations early in 
the airspace proposal process is important in garnering public support. 
4.1.7.  Official visits to the FAA will be coordinated through the USAF Senior Liaison to the 
FAA.  (T-1).  Coordinate all official visits to FAA Service Area offices through the 
applicable AFREP.  (T-1).  Inform the AFREP of all issues other than routine operational 
coordination between the USAF and applicable FAA offices.  MAJCOMs or HAF must 
approve comments, commitments (LOAs, Memorandums of Understanding, etc.), and 
opinions regarding airspace or other aeronautical matters covered by this manual prior to 
forwarding to outside agencies.  This does not prevent routine coordination between 
operating elements of the USAF, the FAA, and host nation ATC agencies or officials. 
 
 
28 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
4.2.  Applicable Federal Aviation Requirements: 
4.2.1.  Public Law 85-726, The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, created the FAA 
and charged the FAA Administrator with managing all national airspace under US 
jurisdiction, including US Protectorates and designated Flight Information Regions.  Because 
DoD airspace requirements often compete with those of commercial and general aviation and 
may impact freedom to transit certain airspace, DoD military services have a special interest 
in presenting credible requirements to the FAA and managing allocated airspace efficiently. 
4.2.2.  Title 5 United States Code §§ 551–559, Administrative Procedure Act, requires public 
notice before the FAA can carry out certain airspace management actions, including military 
actions.  The FAA notifies the public of an airspace proposal through a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register, or by distributing a non-rulemaking 
circular that describes the proposal to known interested parties.  Either of these methods sets 
forth the proposal and specifies a period of time in which the FAA will receive comments or 
suggestions.  The FAA will publish its final decision, stating whether or not the proposal was 
modified as a result of the comments or suggestions received.  If the FAA's final decision 
makes minor changes to the original proposal, a second NPRM or circular is not normally 
required.  In all cases, the FAA makes the final decision on SUA proposals. 
4.2.3.  14 CFR § 91.117 covers aircraft speed.  Recognizing that some DoD aircraft 
performance requirements exceed 250 knots, the FAA issued an exemption to 14 CFR § 
91.117.  However, the exemption is not a blanket waiver.  Conditions under which operations 
exceeding 250 knots are authorized below 10,000 feet MSL can be found in FAA Order JO 
7610.4. 
4.2.4.  Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 91.119, Minimum Safe Altitudes: 
General current edition.  Recognizing there is a requirement to train below these altitudes, 
the FAA issued an exemption to 14 CFR to permit DoD, to the extent necessary, to conduct 
all-weather low-altitude route operations. 
4.2.5.  Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 77, Safe, Efficient Use, and Preservation 
of the Navigable Airspace, current edition and FAA Order JO 7400.2 allocates special use 
airspace for designated military activities.  When the airspace is not being used for a military 
activity, the airspace shall be returned to the controlling agency in accordance with joint use 
provisions. 
4.2.6.  Additional waivers to 14 CFR are processed by forwarding four copies of FAA Form 
7711-2, Certificate of Waiver or Authorization Application, (available from FAA Service 
Area Offices) through military command channels to Headquarters, Air Force Flight 
Standards Agency (AFFSA) Director, Operations Policy & Standards, AFFSA/A3O.  
AFFSA/A3O sends the original and two copies to the FAA. NOTE: Waivers for airshow 
issues (speed, minimum safe altitudes, parachute jumping, etc.) should be submitted directly 
to the local Flight Standards District Office. 
4.2.7.  Requests for civilian use of SUA will be evaluated in accordance with DoD policy and 
AF policy as listed in Attachment 1 of this publication.  (T-1). 
4.2.8.  MAJCOM Airspace Mangers will inform A3TI of any civilian use of USAF 
controlled SUA, with the exception of Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB) and 
operations under Defense Support of Civilian Authorities.  (T-1). 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
29 
4.3.  International, Foreign National Operations, Civil Use of SUA and Combat 
Airspace:  USAF procedures governing operations in international or foreign national airspace 
must recognize the right of a foreign government to establish and enforce procedures for 
operations within its sovereign airspace.  AF/A3TI oversees international and foreign operations 
and coordinates with MAJCOMs as applicable. 
4.3.1.  Host nation laws, regulations, and procedures are detailed in AIPs, ICAO Rules and 
Practices, or locally published directives.  Non-conflicting USAF and DoD directives in 
Attachment 1 apply in foreign national airspace. 
4.3.2.  A designated US military operational command may manage combat or contingency 
airspace during times of tension, contingencies, or war.  AF/A3TI oversees combat airspace 
control and development of related policy and doctrine. 
4.3.3.  ICAO documents specify standards and recommend practices for international flight 
operations and ATC.  ICAO governs USAF flight operations in international and foreign 
national airspace by these standards and practices, as supplemented by each ICAO member 
nation’s AIPs, non-conflicting applications of USAF or DoD directives, and special LOAs 
for strategic, tactical readiness, or training operations.  Review FLIPs and DoD Foreign 
Clearance Guide for specific foreign national airspace. 
4.4.  sUAS/RPA Certificate of Waiver and Authorization (COA):  Unrestricted sUAS/RPA 
operations in the NAS are limited to Prohibited, Restricted, and Warning Areas.  Operations 
outside of Prohibited, Restricted, or Warning Areas require an FAA COA or a lead MAJCOM 
airspace authorization in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding Between the 
Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration For Unmanned Aircraft 
Systems Operations in the National Airspace System (DoD/FAA MOU).  The latest copy of this 
MOU is maintained by the PBFA and may be requested through AF/A3OJ.  Both the FAA COA 
and DoD/FAA MOU ensure sufficient safety mitigations are in place to meet a “See and Avoid” 
capability as required by Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 91.113(b) Right-of-way 
Rules: Except Water Operations, current edition.  FAA Order JO 7200.23A, Processing of 
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) describes the COA application process.  The DoD/FAA 
MOU grants the DoD authority to approve sUAS/RPA operations within airspace delegated to 
DoD ATC facilities.  For Air Force sUAS/RPA operations, airspace access authority is delegated 
to the lead MAJCOMs listed in paragraph 4.4.1.1 or paragraph 4.4.1.2  Air Force units may 
not implement the provisions of the DoD/FAA MOU without coordinating through the 
appropriate lead MAJCOM.  (T-1). 
4.4.1.  Units requiring NAS access outside of Prohibited, Restricted, or Warning Areas 
(including transit requirements to get to those areas) must consult with the respective lead 
MAJCOM for access to the FAA’s COA Application Processing System (CAPS) web site.  
(T-2).  Units must coordinate all sUAS/RPA COA/airspace authorization requests through 
the appropriate lead MAJCOM.  (T-2)  While informal discussions with the FAA may be 
beneficial and lead to expedited COA processing, units will not formally contact the FAA 
directly.  (T-1).  The USAF designated lead MAJCOMs for sUAS/RPA COA/airspace 
authorizations submissions are as follows: 
 
 
30 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
4.4.1.1.  ACC is the lead MAJCOM for all Group 4 and 5 RPA operations per AFPD 10-
9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems.  ACC/A3AA 
(acc.a3aa@us.af.mil) is the primary POC for integration and COA/airspace issues.  ACC 
will establish policy and procedures to support lead and user command responsibilities in 
their supplement to this publication. 
4.4.1.2.  AFSOC is the lead MAJCOM for all Group 1 through 3 sUAS operations per 
AFPD 10-9.  AFSOC/A3OU (AFSOC.A3OU.WF@us.af.mil) is the primary POC for 
integration and COA/airspace authorization issues.  sUAS Group 1 through 3 airspace 
policy and procedures are located in AFMAN 11-502, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems. 
4.4.2.  Accident and Incident Reporting:  Wing Safety will report accident/incident data 
through the standard USAF safety process.  (T-2).  AF/A3TI and A3OJ, in conjunction with 
the USAF Safety Center, will review the data and share appropriate data with the FAA.  (T-
1).  Units will not report accident/incident data directly to the FAA.  (T-1). 
4.5.  Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) Responsibilities:  Disseminate time critical information 
regarding changes impacting airspace (scheduling procedures, altitudes, etc.), either temporary or 
not sufficiently known in advance, via NOTAM.  A NOTAM may serve as notification of an 
alteration until permanent publication on aeronautical charts or in other publications.  It is the 
responsibility of the airspace scheduling agency to ensure that NOTAMs are revised and 
submitted in accordance with the FAA Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020

Chapter 5 
AIRSPACE SCHEDULING AND REPORTING 
5.1.  Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE):  CSE is the Air Force wide web-based tool for 
scheduling, managing, and recording the utilization of airspace and ranges.  All Air Force units 
shall use CSE to manage, schedule, and report the utilization of Special Activity Airspace.  (T-
1).  MAJCOM Airspace Managers can provide CSE user guidance. NOTE: Air Education and 
Training Command Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training locations are exempt from the 
requirement to schedule airspace in CSE by individual sortie and are authorized to block 
schedule special use airspace. 
5.2.  Need for Reports.  Report data is of ever-increasing value to airspace managers at all 
levels.  Accurate reporting is critical in many decisions affecting military airspace (e.g., BRAC 
data collection, environmental impact analysis, legal actions, etc.).  The CSE system will serve 
as a repository for the data associated with airspace scheduling, management, and utilization.  
This repository will provide a real-time report generation capability to unit, wing, MAJCOM, 
and HAF as necessary.  CSE does not track supersonic events, therefore a supersonic log must be 
maintained at the unit level.  (T-1). 
5.3.  Supersonic Log.  All USAF units shall maintain a log of supersonic events.  (T-1).  Each 
event shall be recorded in CSE.  (T-1). 
5.4.  Airspace Denial Report:  Each USAF using agency shall maintain FAA denial information 
in CSE.  (T-3).  Until so equipped and trained, airspace denial reports will be submitted in 
accordance with Attachment 9.  (T-2).  Include both denials of airspace and restrictions on 
availability of military airspace.  MAJCOMs may stipulate other reporting requirements. 
5.5.  Annual Restricted Area and Military Operations Area (MOA) Utilization Reports: 
5.5.1.  Under Title 49 United States Code Section 40101, the FAA is charged with ensuring 
the safe and efficient use of the nation’s airspace to include airspace that has been delegated 
to the DoD.  In carrying out this responsibility, the FAA requires that DoD using agencies 
submit annual reports detailing the use of all assigned Restricted Areas and MOAs in 
accordance with FAA Order JO 7400.2.  Actual utilization data of all assigned Restricted 
Areas and MOAs, captured either real-time or post-mission, will be entered into CSE to 
ensure accurate reporting.  (T-0).  All CSE sites will develop local Standard Operating 
Procedures designed to accurately and efficiently capture actual airspace utilization times.  
(T-2). 
5.5.2.  Prior to submission to the FAA, AF/A3TI will generate the annual report from CSE 
and submit to MAJCOMs for verification.  MAJCOM airspace managers will review the data 
provided for accuracy and completeness.  If actual utilization is less than 75 percent of the 
time activated then the MAJCOM airspace manager will determine the reason and provide a 
response to AF/A3TI via memorandum.  If information is available, the impact of weather 
and/or ATC delays on the actual utilization of the area should be considered when evaluating 
this item.  After the MAJCOM reviews and validates the data, AF/A3TI will submit the 
report to the AFREP for submission to the FAA. 
32 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
5.6.  Release of Airspace Utilization Data:  Although the USAF does not release detailed 
information to the public, generic data (e.g., we flew 77 sorties on VR 123, MOA, etc., during 
the month of June 2020) is an acceptable response to inquiries requesting information on SUA 
utilization.  More detailed data should be considered For Official Use Only. 
5.7.  Military Training Route (MTR) and SR Evaluations:  MTR and SR evaluations consist 
of both a route review and annual flight evaluations.  Units with scheduling authority for an 
MTR and SR will conduct and document route review for all MTRs and SRs with a floor at or 
below 1,500 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) by the last day of the anniversary month of 
publication, or month of the last route review.  (T-3).  Annual Flight evaluation will be 
conducted by the last day of the anniversary month of publication, or month of the last flight 
evaluation (T-3).  All MTRs/SRs shall be surveyed across their entire route width and length and 
aircrew route briefing guides updated to reflect new areas of concern.  (T-3).  The SUA/MTR 
Review, Attachment 8, contains additional information required when reviewing MTRs/SRs. 
5.7.1.  Route reviews will be conducted by the unit airspace manager using the Chart 
Updating Manual (CHUM), FLIP AP/1B, Sectional Aeronautical Charts, Tactical Pilotage 
Charts, and other aeronautical charts.  (T-3).  Route reviews should annotate the following: 
5.7.1.1.  Charted/uncharted obstacles or hazards within 100 feet of the MTR/SR floor and 
2 NM of the lateral boundary. 
5.7.1.2.  Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of public-use airports. 
5.7.1.3.  Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of Class B, C, and D airspace.  Also 
consider Class E airspace associated with non-towered airports and instrument approach 
procedures. 
5.7.1.4.  Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of airways and charted visual flight rules 
(VFR) flyways. 
5.7.1.5.  Potential bird attractant areas within 2 NM of a route where large concentrations 
of birds may be present. 
5.7.1.6.  Potential noise-sensitive areas within 3 NM of a route.  Review areas where 
restrictions are identified to minimize the impact of noise. 
5.7.1.7.  TFRs established by FAA NOTAMs/Defense Internet NOTAM Service (DINS) 
(i.e., Department of the Interior environmentally sensitive animal breeding areas or 
parachute jumping areas). 
5.7.1.8.  Other potential flight safety hazards. 
5.7.1.9.  Verify the accuracy of aircrew route briefings and ensure MTR/SR Special 
Operating Procedures and Remarks published in FLIP AP/1B are accurate and complete.  
Review previous route evaluations to ensure any other previously identified findings have 
been appropriately addressed. 
5.7.1.10.  Wing/base civil engineering environmental office shall review the route for 
environmentally sensitive areas.  (T-2). 
 
 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020

5.7.2.  MTR Annual Flight Evaluation.  The annual flight evaluation provides important data 
and complements the ongoing route evaluation program by continuing the operational check 
of the route, which ensures a comprehensive operational review of the MTR, as it is not 
completed under the same mission conditions (e.g., aircraft type, speed, required systems 
checks, etc.).  Owning unit will conduct the evaluation during the anniversary month of 
publication or the last day of the month in which the previous flight evaluation was 
accomplished (MTR segments with a floor higher than 1,500 feet AGL need not be 
evaluated).  (T-3). 
5.7.2.1.  Failure to meet the annual suspense shall preclude the use of MTRs until 
evaluation requirements are met.  (T-3). 
5.7.2.2.  The route should be evaluated to ensure obstruction clearance at the minimum 
altitude usable for training.  The evaluation aircrew should consider the route’s minimum 
defined altitude when considering an obstacle’s flight safety potential, as other units may 
train at lower altitudes.  Commanders are authorized to use Non-Rated Airspace 
Managers as evaluators and provide unrestricted Mission Essential Ground Personnel 
status for them to accomplish this route evaluation program. 
5.7.2.3.  Flight evaluation crew members should be familiar with low-altitude flying and 
evaluation requirements.  They should receive a pre-brief from the scheduling activity 
and provide a de-briefing to the scheduling activity. 
5.7.2.4.  The scheduling activity, in coordination with the airspace manager, must 
develop an MTR survey schedule.  (T-3).  The airspace manager must ensure the 
necessary charts are available for the evaluation and inform the OE/AAA Program 
Manager of uncharted obstructions within 100 feet below the floor and within 2 NM of 
the lateral boundary of the MTR or any other hazards to air traffic affecting low-altitude 
navigation.  (T-3). 
5.7.2.5.  All users should be alert for new obstructions/hazards.  Aircrews should be 
briefed to report any observed construction (i.e., temporary cranes, mines, temporary 
helipads, etc.) or uncharted obstructions/hazards to the scheduling agency/airspace 
manager.  Information should include latitude and longitude coordinates, estimated 
height, and description of each obstruction/hazard.  NOTE:  Professional judgment is the 
key to effective evaluations.  Visual acuity may vary greatly and the parameters above 
are provided as guidelines only.  Evaluation aircrews should, at a minimum, consider the 
impact of foliage, haze, clouds, fog contrast (light), airspeed/ground speed, terrain, snow, 
and task saturation. 
5.7.2.6.  The evaluation aircrew should consider the following when conducting 
evaluations: 
5.7.2.6.1.  Accuracy, adequacy, and availability of mission planning materials for the 
route. 
5.7.2.6.2.  Accuracy and completeness of the aircrew route briefing. 
5.7.2.6.3.  Potential hazards during entry and exit procedures, to include possible 
ATC conflicts, ATC center/sector boundaries, communication problems, frequency 
congestion, and task saturation. 
34 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
5.7.2.6.4.  Identify obstacles not listed in the CHUM that pose a hazard.  Instrument 
Routes must be evaluated for enroute obstacle clearance.  (T-1). 
5.7.2.6.5.  Possible ATC conflicts from public-use airports to include portions of the 
route within 5 NM of Class B, C, and D airspace.  Also consider Class E airspace 
associated with non-towered airports and instrument approach procedures. 
5.7.2.6.6.  Possible ATC conflicts for airways, charted VFR flyways or practice areas, 
and other MTRs. 
5.7.2.6.7.  Potential for bird strikes from bird attractant areas to include known 
migratory routes. 
5.7.2.6.8.  Built-up areas showing new development (buildings) including evidence of 
mining activity. 
5.7.2.6.9.  Environmentally sensitive areas not previously identified. 
5.7.2.6.10.  Possible interference to night vision goggle operations. 
5.7.2.6.11.  Other potential flight safety hazards. 
5.7.2.7.  The evaluation aircrew should return the survey documentation to the scheduling 
agency/airspace manager.  Aircrews should also debrief the scheduling agency/airspace 
manager on specific observations and their potential to create conflicts and/or task 
saturation. 
5.7.3.  Evaluation Results.  Airspace managers must coordinate with schedulers and the 
senior operational commander on any route, or a segment of a route, found to contain 
potential flight safety hazards.  (T-3).  An assessment of the hazard must be conducted prior 
to closing or reopening the route or route segment.  (T-3).  Ensure corrective actions are 
documented. 
5.7.3.1.  Aircrews report uncharted obstacles on MTRs to the scheduling agency/airspace 
manager as soon as possible after landing.  (T-2).  Airspace managers shall update 
uncharted obstacles within 100 feet of the floor and 2 NM of the lateral boundary of the 
MTR for inclusion in the Special Operating Procedures in FLIP AP/1B of the evaluated 
route.  (T-3). 
5.7.3.2.  Units shall remove all references to charted obstacles from the route Special 
Operating Procedures in FLIP AP/1B.  (T-3).  Include uncharted obstacles in the aircrew 
route briefing guides. 
5.7.4.  Aircrew Route Briefing Guides.  Units shall prepare and maintain aircrew route 
briefing guides for each MTR for which they are the scheduling activity.  (T-2).  Briefing 
guides will include special operating procedures and constraints and may emphasize items 
already mentioned in FLIP AP/1B.  (T-2). 
5.8.  FLIP AP/1B.  FLIP AP/1B provides information and operating instructions for all MTRs.  
It is critical that units ensure information listed in FLIP AP/1B is complete and accurate.  
Originating and scheduling agencies must ensure FLIP AP/1B identifies procedures for the safe 
and efficient operation of aircraft on their respective MTRs.  (T-2).  Units shall include the 
following in Special Operating Procedures or FLIP Remarks. 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
35 
5.8.1.  Potential hazards during entry, exit, and flying of the route.  Include listing all Class 
B, C, and D airspace within 5 NM of the route.  Include reference to the applicable Sectional 
Aeronautical Chart.  (T-2). 
5.8.2.  Unpublished/uncharted obstruction data pending publishing/charting.  (T-2). 
5.8.3.  Route deconfliction procedures.  (T-2). 
5.8.4.  Possible bird attractant areas and migratory routes.  (T-2). 
5.8.5.  Noise and low-level flight sensitive areas.  (T-2). 
5.8.6.  Uncharted airports.  (T-2). 
5.8.7.  Other potential flight safety hazards.  (T-2).

Terms 
Aeronautical Proposal—A written proposal of (but not limited to) construction of any new 
airport, any manmade obstruction that would extend into navigable airspace, establishment or 
change of SUA (including any special or unusual ATC procedures) or establishment of or change 
to any new or existing NAVAID.  This proposal is accomplished via the preliminary review 
process (T/TSNS) in accordance with Chapter 3 prior to initiating any aeronautical proposal 
action associated with establishment or change of SUA. 
Aerial Refueling (AR) Airspace—Airspace developed to conduct air refueling.  Permanent air 
refueling airspace is designated as either a track or an anchor or established via a letter of 
agreement (LOA) with the appropriate ATC facility responsible for the airspace.  After 
coordination with ATC, refueling routes or anchors are processed through the appropriate 
AFREP for publication in FLIP.  Temporary or special AR airspace may also be established by 
coordination/agreement with the ATC facility having purview over the airspace (FAA Order JO 
7610.4). 
Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA)—Airspace of defined vertical/lateral limits, 
assigned by ATC, for the purpose of providing air traffic segregation between the specified 
activities being conducted within the assigned airspace and other Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) 
traffic. (FAA Order JO 7610.4) 
Airspace Action—The procedural act of designation, redesignation, modification, or revocation 
of a parcel of airspace. 
Airspace Concept—For identification purposes, an informal initial requests for additional 
military airspace is referred to as a “concept” and is part of the T/TSNS process. 
Airspace Proposal—Having been through the T/TSNS process, an airspace proposal is the 
formal portion of requests for airspace through the FAA.  There must be a clearly defined need 
and justification for obtaining or revising airspace. 
Alert Area—Airspace which may contain a high volume of pilot training activities or an unusual 
type of aerial activity neither of which is hazardous to aircraft. (FAA Order JO 7400.10) 
Altitude Reservation (ALTRV)—Airspace utilization under prescribed conditions normally 
employed for the mass movement of aircraft or other special user requirements which cannot 
otherwise be accomplished.  ALTRVs are approved by the appropriate FAA facility, Central 
Altitude Reservation Function, Pacific Military Altitude Reservation Function, or European 
Central Altitude Reservation Function.  They can be either Moving or Stationary. (FAA Order 
JO 7610.4) 
 
 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
43 
Controlled Firing Area (CFA)—A controlled firing area (CFA) is airspace designated to 
contain activities that if not conducted in a controlled environment would be hazardous to 
nonparticipating aircraft.  CFAs provide a means to accommodate, without impact to aviation, 
certain hazardous activities that can be immediately suspended if a nonparticipating aircraft 
approaches the area.  (CFAs are not charted and their volume is only defined locally). (FAA 
Order JO 7400.2) 
Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)—The process, as outlined in 32 CFR Part 
989, used to assess environmental impacts resulting from a proposed action. 
Instrument Routes (IR)—Routes used by the DoD and associated Reserve and Air National 
Guard units for the purpose of conducting low-altitude navigation and tactical training in both 
IFR and VFR weather conditions at airspeeds in excess of 250 knots-indicated air space (KIAS) 
below 10,000 ft MSL. (FAA Order JO 7610.4) 
Joint Use—Under the “joint use” concept, SUA is released to the controlling agency and 
becomes available for access by non-participating aircraft during periods when the airspace is 
not needed by the using agency for its designated purpose.  Such use enhances safety and 
benefits the NAS.  The USAF encourages the use of military radar units and the provisions of 
military air traffic services for SUA complexes when such services are available to enhance 
safety and utility. 
Low-Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Area—Usually large geographic areas established 
for random VFR, low altitude navigation training to preclude flying over the same point more 
than once per day.  Activities are in accordance with all applicable FARs and flown at an 
airspeed of 250 knots or less.  MAJCOMs will determine establishment criteria.  There is no 
required coordination with the FAA.  LATN areas are not published on aeronautical charts. 
Military Airspace—Also known as SAA, a collective term used to indicate SUA and/or other 
airspace for military use. 
Military Airspace Data Entry (MADE)—A web based tool used to deliver special use airspace 
schedules to the overlying FAA ATC facility with SUA responsibility.  This tool replaces older 
phone, fax and email methods. 
Military Operations Area (MOA)—Airspace designated outside of Class A airspace to 
separate or segregate certain nonhazardous military activities from IFR Traffic and to identify for 
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic where these activities are conducted.  MOAs are designated to 
contain nonhazardous, military flight activities including, but not limited to, air combat 
maneuvers, air intercepts, low altitude tactics, etc. (FAA Order JO 7400.2) 
Military Training Routes (MTR)—The MTR program is established by the FAA and the DoD 
for the purpose of conducting low-altitude and/or high-speed training.  Generally, MTRs are 
established below 10,000 feet MSL for operations at speeds in excess of 250 knots.  Each 
segment of an MTR route is allocated a floor and ceiling altitude and lateral boundaries, 
described in NM left and right of centerline.  MTRs are established according to the criteria in 
FAA Order JO 7610.4.  Routes are established as either IR or VR.  The DoD has a speed 
exemption to 14 CFR § 91.117 (see FAA Order JO 7610.4).  The FAA has approval authority 
over IR establishment and the appropriate MAJCOM approves establishment of VRs.  
Environmental documentation in accordance with 32 CFR Part 989, is required to establish 
MTRs.  VRs are processed through the FAA via the AFREP.  AFREPs assign all route numbers.  
44 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
Ultimately, MTRs are published in FLIP AP/1B and charted on FLIP AP/1B Area Planning 
Chart, and FAA sectional charts.  Some MTRs are on DoD Low IFR enroute charts. 
National Security Area (NSA)—A national security area (NSA) consists of airspace of defined 
vertical and lateral dimensions established at locations where there is a requirement for increased 
security of ground facilities.  The purpose of such national security areas is to request pilot 
cooperation by voluntarily avoiding flight through the NSA.  When circumstances dictate a need 
for a greater level of security, flight may be temporarily prohibited by regulation under the 
provisions of 14 CFR § 99.7, Special Security Instructions.  Such prohibitions will be issued by 
FAA Headquarters and disseminated via the US NOTAM System. (FAA Order JO 7400.10) 
Non-rulemaking Actions—Cases relating to FAA decisions or activities affecting airspace for 
which FAA does not generally issue a rule, regulation, or order.  These actions include 
establishing (or eliminating) FAA or military NAVAIDs as well as designating controlled firing 
areas, alert areas, MOAs, warning areas, and airports provided the action of one of these items 
does not impact on a mandatory rulemaking action. 
Orbit Area—This activity is used to occupy an expanded area used for holding or maneuvering 
aircraft.  Orbit areas are used by DoD surveillance aircraft (e.g., E-2, E-3, E-8) and are normally 
contained within ATCAAs. (FAA Order JO 7610.4) 
Other Airspace for Military Use Designations—Used to collectively identify non-SUA assets.  
These designations are in FAA Order JO 7610.4 or military documents.  None are rulemaking 
actions and some (contained solely in military documents) do not require coordination with the 
FAA for establishment. 
Planning Requirements in the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (PREIAP)—
PREIAP ensures the early identification of appropriate requirements, collection of pertinent 
baseline data and agreement among key stakeholders on the proponent’s Draft Description of 
Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA).  Air Force installations or major commands 
(MAJCOMs) will follow the PREIAP process for all EISs and EAs of special concern.  (T-1)  To 
the extent possible, accomplishment of these procedures will occur prior to initiation of the 
formal NEPA analysis process.  PREIAP does not change the requirements of 32 CFR Part 989 
and will not provide any authority for challenging Air Force decisions or actions.  PREIAP 
highlights the importance of existing, ongoing proponent responsibilities. 
Prohibited Area—A prohibited area is airspace established under Title 14, Code of Federal 
Regulations, Part 73, Special Use Airspace, current edition, provisions, within which no person 
may operate an aircraft without permission of the using agency.  Prohibited areas are established 
when necessary to prohibit flight over an area on the surface in the interest of national security 
and welfare. (FAA Order JO 7400.2) 
Restricted Area—A restricted area is airspace established under 14 CFR § 73 provisions, within 
which the flight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject to restriction.  Restricted 
Areas are established when determined necessary to confine or segregate activities considered 
hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. (FAA Order JO 7400.2) 
Rulemaking Actions—Procedures where FAA assigns, changes, or rescinds airspace and 
manages its use by rule, regulation, or order.  These actions include establishing (or eliminating) 
jet routes, airways, restricted areas, prohibited areas, and various classes of airspace. 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
45 
Slow Routes (SR) —Used for Slow Speed Low-level training routes used for military air 
operations conducted at or below 1,500 feet AGL at airspeed of 250 knots or less.  Unlike IR and 
VR MTRs, SRs are not technically part of the MTR system and therefore have no directive 
guidance in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) or FAA Order JO 7610.4.  MAJCOMs 
will determine establishment criteria.  There is no requirement for coordination with the FAA.  
SRs are published in FLIP AP/1B; however, they are not published on aeronautical charts.  
Environmental documentation in accordance with 32 CFR Part 989 is required.  There is no 
overall mechanism to inform military or civilian aviators that an SR is active, as Automated 
Flight Services Stations are not notified. (FAA Order JO 7610.4) 
Special Activity Airspace (SAA)—Any airspace with defined dimensions within the National 
Airspace System wherein limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations.  This airspace 
may be restricted areas, prohibited areas, military operations areas, ATC assigned airspace, and 
any other designated airspace areas. 
Special Use Airspace (SUA)—Airspace that is of a defined vertical and lateral dimension that 
alerts users to areas of unusual flight hazards and separates those activities from other airspace 
users to enhance safety.  Certain limitations or restrictions may be placed on non-participating 
aircraft. 
Temporary Airspace—There are multiple types of temporary airspace that can be utilized to 
meet temporary requirements or for exercise planning.  A temporary MOA, temporary restricted 
area or stationary Altitude Reservation (ALTRV) can meet these temporary requirements, but are 
not designed to circumvent the process of establishing permanent SUA.  Existing SUA must be 
used to the maximum extent possible to meet temporary airspace requirements.  FAA guidance 
on temporary MOAs and Restricted Areas is contained in FAA Order JO 7400.2.  Stationary 
ALTRV guidance is listed in FAA Order JO 7610.4. 
Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR)—TFR is a type of Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).  A TFR 
defines an area restricted to air travel due to a geographically-limited, short-term, airspace 
restriction.  Temporary flight restrictions often encompass hazard/natural disaster areas (Title 14, 
Code of Federal Regulations, Section 91.137(a)(1-3), Temporary Flight Restrictions in the 
Vicinity of Disaster/Hazard Areas, current edition)  TFRs are used for: Air shows (Title 14, Code 
of Federal Regulations, Section 91.145, Management of Aircraft Operations in the Vicinity of 
Aerial Demonstrations and Major Sporting Events, current edition); Space launches (Title 14, 
Code of Federal Regulations, Section 91.143, Flight Limitation in the Proximity of Space Flight 
Operations, current edition); Presidential/VIP movements (Title 14, Code of Federal 
Regulations, Section 91.141, Flight Restrictions in the Proximity of the Presidential and Other 
Parties, current edition); or Special Security Instructions/National Special Security Events (14 
CFR § 99.7) 
Temporary Special Use Airspace (TSUA)—The military and the FAA have the ability to 
create Temporary Military Operations Areas or Temporary Restricted Areas to accommodate the 
specific needs of a particular military exercise.  This information is available via either the 
NOTAM system or by direct contact with the FAA Regional Headquarters.  TSUAs are usually 
established to accommodate the military's need for additional airspace to periodically conduct 
exercises that supplement routine training, when existing airspace is inadequate to accommodate 
these short-term military exercises, TSUA actions are coordinated through the cognizant FAA 
Regional/Service Area Office. (FAA Order JO 7400.2)

DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
Test/Training Space (T/TS)—Any air, land, or sea area that is used to conduct military training 
or operational activities. 
Tier—AF effort to reduce MAJCOM and HAF oversight on wings, where it makes sense.  As 
part of the effort, all AFIs are being rewritten to include a Tiering breakdown identifying the 
appropriate level of waiver authority and annotate the Tier following any AFI directive at Wing 
level.  Tier definition breakdown is as follows: 
Tier 1 (T-1)—- Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders or the USAF Air and Space 
Professionals, commanders, or the DAF strongly at risk of mission or program failure, 
death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.  The waiver authority 
is the MAJCOM/CC, delegable no lower than MAJCOM Director, with the concurrence 
of the AFI Certifying Official coordination of the publication’s Approving Official. 
Tier 2 (T-2)—- Non-compliance may degrade mission or program effectiveness or 
efficiency and has potential to create moderate risk of mission or program failure, injury, 
legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.  The waiver authority is the 
MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than MAJCOM Director). 
Tier 3 (T-3)—- Non-compliance may limit mission or program effectiveness or 
efficiency and has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or program 
failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste, or abuse.  The waiver 
authority is the Wing/DRU/ Field Operating Agencies /CC (delegable no lower than 
Group/CC or equivalent). 
Tier 0 (T-0)—- Determined by respective non-AF authority (e.g., Congress, White 
House, Office of the Secretary of Defense, JS).  The waiver authority is non-applicable, 
or external to AF. 
Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)—Are further defined as: 
Group 1 (sUAS):—Typically weighs up to 20 pounds and normally operates below 
1,200 feet AGL at speeds less than 100 knots. 
Group 2 (sUAS)—- Typically weighs 21–55 pounds and normally operates below 3,500 
feet AGL at speeds less than 250 knots. 
Group 3 (sUAS):—Typically weighs more than 55 pounds but less than 1,320 pounds 
and normally operates below 18,000 feet MSL at speeds less than 250 knots. 
Group 4 (RPA):—Typically weighs more than 1,320 pounds and normally operates 
below 18,000 feet MSL at any speed. 
Group 5 (RPA):—Typically weighs more than 1,320 pounds and normally operates 
higher than 18,000 feet MSL at any speed. 
Visual Routes (VR)—Routes used by the DoD and associated Reserve and Air National Guard 
units for the purpose of conducting low-altitude navigation and tactical training under VFR 
conditions at airspeeds in excess of 250 KIAS below 10,000 ft MSL. (FAA Order JO 7610.4)

Warning Area—A non-regulatory warning area is airspace of defined dimensions designated 
over international waters (3 or 12 nautical miles (NM) outward from the coast of the United 
States) that contains activity which may be hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft.  The purpose 
of such warning areas is to warn nonparticipating pilots of the potential danger. (FAA JO 
7400.10)

T/TSNS INSTRUCTIONS AND SAMPLE T/TSNS 
A6.1.  The T/TSNS is the avenue which units can voice a requirement up to the MAJCOM and 
Air Staff.  Keep in mind the audience that reviews this document:  airspace managers, 
environmental planning specialists, legal professionals, and the AFREP.  Some of these persons 
may not be familiar with your unit or the potential issues with your mission. 
A6.2.  The T/TSNS is the precursor to the DOPAA.  If done properly, the T/TSNS is the initial 
scrub of the key issues that will be explored in great detail through the environmental and 
aeronautical processing of the formal proposal once submitted to the FAA.  The T/TSNS is 
organized as outlined below. 
A6.2.1.  Chapter 1: Title.  Explain what this proposal is trying to accomplish through this 
T/TSNS.  Give a brief overview of the options being pursued in this T/TSNS (which will be 
explained further in chapter 3). 
A6.2.2.  Chapter 2: Operational Requirement/Justification.  This should be based on factual 
data.  Examples include Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) shortage/delta, flying hour delta, 
current airspace not of sufficient volume to meet requirements (as specified in an AFI or 
other regulatory guidance), or other deficiencies in the proximity, time, or attributes as 
defined in the Air Force Ranges Strategic Vision (Dec 06).  If there are other specific units 
that support this initiative, list those units and why they require this airspace modification 
and provide similar factual justification as listed above. 
A6.2.3.  Chapter 3: Concept/Proposed Actions.  It is preferred that units look at more than 
one possible modification to meet their requirements.  It is better to analyze more than one 
action, if feasible, so as to prevent the appearance of being pre-decisional.  This requires 
equal analysis of all proposed actions.  Only actions that meet the stated operational 
requirements should be mentioned here.  For those options considered but not meeting 
operational requirements, list those under Chapter 4:  Alternatives as “Actions Considered 
But Not Carried Forward” with the rationale as to why these options could not meet the 
requirements. 
A6.2.4.  Chapter 4: Alternatives.  A no-action alternative must be specified.  (T-0).  As 
stated earlier, Actions Considered But Not Carried Forward should be included here to 
demonstrate other options that could be suggested by other airspace stakeholders (civil 
aviation, Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, etc) have been reviewed, but cannot meet 
the stated requirements. 
A6.2.5.  Chapter 5: Air Traffic Control Coordination.  As specified in this AFMAN, the Air 
Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) must be coordinated with prior to forwarding this 
T/TSNS.  (T-3).  Without this coordination, this concept is a wish list.  The ARTCC will 
provide guidance on how this will impact air traffic flow for that affected area.  If the 
proposal will affect terminal airspace, the applicable approach controls should also be 
contacted to ensure all initial concerns are addressed and potentially resolved early.  The 
more outreach conducted at this point will result in a smoother process later once the formal 
proposal is provided to the FAA.  List any potential concerns that could be addressed later in 
the aeronautical or environmental processing of this proposal. 
54 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
A6.2.6.  Chapter 6: Other Interest Potential.  This is the critical portion for the 
environmental side of the concept.  Conduct thorough research to determine what potential 
issues can come about should the concept be approved to go forward as a formal proposal.  If 
more than one proposed action meets the requirement, equal consideration must be given 
under each category for each option.  MAJCOM Environmental Planning Office or AFREP 
may provide additional assistance for specific category data. 
A6.2.7.  Chapter 7:  Engagement Planning Phase.  Units should develop an engagement plan 
as early as possible to ensure that a final plan is ready for execution shortly after the proposal 
is briefed to the SECAF.  After the SECAF is briefed, first notification of the concept should 
be made to the affected area‘s Congressional delegation(s), which will be coordinated 
through AF/A3TI to SAF/LL channels (NGB/LL for NGB airspace issues) (CONUS, 
Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico and Alaska only).  Notification to affected TAGs will be made 
following congressional notification.  These notifications should take place no later than one 
day prior to public notification.  Public engagement will take place as directed in AFI 35-
108, Environmental Public Affairs, and in accordance with the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 as promulgated in 32 CFR Part 989.

1.  Overview. 
1.1.  Concept/Purpose.  This T/TSNS addresses the requirement to establish airspace 
sufficient to accommodate AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile 
(AMRAAM) tactics and Low Altitude Air-to-Air Training (LOWAT) tactics.  This T/TSNS 
looks at the modification of the Milhouse Military Operations Area (MOA) and the Crowe 
MOA to meet military training needs.  The minimum altitudes of Milhouse 1 and Milhouse 2 
MOAs would be lowered to support LOWAT.  The current maximum altitudes for both 
Milhouse MOAs will remain unchanged, but will amend the boundaries to accommodate the 
new requirement for the AIM-120/AMRAAM.  The new MOA would be divided into 
Milhouse 1 & 2 and Sideshow MOAs.  The Crowe MOA would require the lowering of the 
current MOA floor and the establishment of an ATCAA that mirrors the existing Crowe MOA 
lateral boundaries.  The 999th FW plans to analyze both MOA options in this T/TSNS and in 
the NEPA process.

2.  Operational Requirements/Justification 
2.1.  Unit and Mission.  The 999th Fighter Wing flies the F-16 out of Spaatz Air Force Base 
in Springfield, NA.  The F-16 is a multi-role fighter, with operations at all altitudes from 
surface to 50,000+ feet.  Pilot operational and training requirements require missions to be 
accomplished in the low, medium, and high altitude regimes.  During a real world intercept, 
pilots are cleared to descend down to LOWAT minimums or current pilot qualification, 
whichever is higher.  If a pilot is not current in LOWAT requirements, then the pilot is 
technically not legal to descend down to lower altitudes where most real world intercepts 
take place.  If a pilot does descend lower than they are currently qualified, they are placing 
themselves and others, both in the air and on the ground, at risk.  Today, the alert tasking of 
the 999th Fighter Wing continues 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and the real world tasking 
does not allow for any of the wing’s pilots to lose their LOWAT currency.  The concept to 
modify the Milhouse or Crowe MOA is the best answer to the unit’s training requirements. 
Two years ago, the 999th Fighter Wing was converted from an air defense mission to a 
general-purpose mission.  It was originally conceived during the MAJCOM SATAF that the 
Tooey MOA could accommodate the LOWAT training requirements for this new mission.  
A review of the past two years RAP data shows this is not the case (see table below), 
primarily because three unit compete for this LOWAT airspace and it prevents all three units 
from meeting their RAP requirements.  Additionally, Spaatz AFB F-16s will be equipped 
with the AIM-120 AMRAAM starting in six months.  The minimum prescribed airspace for 
65 NM AMRAAM set-ups is 85 miles.  This allows the two forces to orbit without the other 
forces seeing the “picture” too early.  As currently configured and at its longest length, the 
Milhouse MOA is only 60 NM in length, but allows for two 60 X 25 NM segments of 
airspace.  The Crowe MOA does allow for the 85 X 25 NM airspace segments, but has a 
floor of 5,000’ MSL. 
LOWAT mission definition and requirements are described in Air Force Instruction 11-2F-
16V1.  LOWAT missions are defined as “an event performing realistic, mission oriented air-
to-air operations while in a LOWAT certified low-altitude block (at or below 1,000 ft 
AGL)”.  A minimum altitude less than 1,000’ AGL is required in allow pilots to update their 
LOWAT currency.  RAP requirements for every qualified F-16 pilot include 16 LOWAT 
missions annually, requiring 768 for the wing per year for 48 assigned aircrew members.  A 
review of wing RAP performance for the past two years shows that 20% or 153 missions 
were not completed.  In addition, pilots are not meeting RAP requirements for Low 
Slow/Visual Identification intercepts and Slow Shadow intercepts, which are essential 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
61 
training for both Air-Superiority and 24-hour Air Defense Alert role.  Additionally, A-10s 
from Jones ANGB and Smith ARB also require low altitude training airspace (24 assigned 
aircrew at each unit).  Due to high utilization of the Tooey MOA, these two units only 
complete 288 of 384 and 268 of 384 RAP requirements, respectively.  Both Jones ANGB 
and Smith ARB support this initiative to aid in overcoming their respective RAP shortfalls.

2.2.  Need for Low-Altitude Training Airspace.  All three units currently use the Tooey MOA 
and VR-999 to accomplish LOWAT training.  Tooey MOA’s activation period is limited to 12 
hrs per day and it currently cannot meet the LOWAT RAP demand for all three units 
(combined delta of 364 RAP missions).  Jones ANGB attempted to expand Tooey MOA’s 
effective times, but there was resistance from the FAA and Harrison International Airport.  
VR-999 is a narrow, one-way, low-level corridor, portions of which lie underneath the 
Milhouse MOA.  This low-level route does not allow LOWAT annual training requirements to 
be accomplished due to its restrictive nature.  Since VR-999 is a one-way route, it does not 
allow for reversing direction on the route (defensive reactions) or intercepts from a high to low 
altitude regime on maneuvering targets (LOWAT intercepts). 
 
3.  Concept/Proposed Airspace Actions 
 
3.1.  Modification of the Milhouse MOAs and Creation of the Sideshow MOA.  The altitudes 
of the current Milhouse 1 & 2 MOA airspace would have to be amended as stated below and 
shown in Section 1.2 above:  The Milhouse 1 and Milhouse 2 MOA’s minimum altitude would 
be lowered from the current 7,000’ MSL to 5,000’ MSL and the current boundaries for both 
Milhouse MOA’s will extend 20 NM east.  The new AMRAAM requires 65-mile (minimum) 
set-ups (85 NM airspace), and Milhouse MOA is only 60 miles in length, so the extension to 
the east will allow the unit to train properly to their new RAP requirements.  A new MOA, 
Sideshow MOA, would be from 500’ AGL up to but not including 5,000’ MSL below the 
revised Milhouse 1 & 2 MOA.  This would allow more efficient scheduling of airspace, since 
Sideshow MOA would only be activated if F-16/A-10s were performing LOWAT missions.  
This MOA is anticipated to be activated no more than four hours per day, five days a week 
(Monday – Friday).  The Milhouse 1 & 2 MOAs will continue to be activated at their current 
utilization rate. 
 
62 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
3.2.  Establishment of the Crowe 2 MOA and Big Brinley ATCAA.  The Crowe MOA is of 
required volume to support the AMRAAM requirements except it has no associated ATCAA 
above the existing MOA to support either higher altitude operations or a floor sufficient for 
LOWAT tactics.  ATCAA airspace from FL 180 up to at least FL 230 is required to support F-
16 air-to-air tactics.  A lower MOA, the Crowe 2 MOA, would provide the perfect volume of 
airspace for LOWAT training.  The Crowe 2 MOA would meet the LOWAT mission 
requirements of Spaatz AFB, Jones ANGB and Smith ARB with the same anticipated 
activation of no more than four hours per day, five days a week (Monday – Friday). 
4.  Alternatives.   
4.1.  No Action Alternative.  Twenty percent of the 999th FW pilots currently do not meet 
requirements for annual LOWAT training and would continue to be deficient in this area 
without appropriate low-level training airspace.  The ability to perform real world Air Defense 
Missions/Homeland Security Missions would continue to suffer due to the current LOWAT 
training shortfall and could prevent us from successfully completing some Homeland Security 
Missions (i.e., any requiring an intercept on an airborne target below 1,000’ AGL). 
4.2.  Use of Other Airspace.  The wing airspace office conducted a search of all LOWAT-
capable airspace within 125 miles of the home station.  The Warning Areas that are use daily 
are entirely over water.  Air Force Regulations restrict us from training below 1000’ MSL over 
the ocean due to risk for spatial disorientation due to visual illusions that are common over the 
water at low altitudes. 
4.3.  Actions Considered But Not Carried Forward. 
4.3.1.  Expansion of the Tooey MOA.  The Tooey MOA is available 12 hours per day, 265 days 
per year (Monday-Friday).  The following shows the RAP deficiencies for LOWAT for the 
three mentioned units: 
 
 
Authorized Scheduled Utilized 
Tooey MOA 12.0 
11.5 
10.8 
The average daily utilization for Tooey MOA is contained in the following chart.  Authorized 
is the maximum number of hours the MOA can be scheduled.  Based on the current 
utilization rate, there is not adequate time remaining to accommodate the LOWAT RAP delta. 
The 1.2 delta between utilized and authorized is scattered throughout the day in between goes 
and does not allow for a continuous block of time that would be useful to any of the units.  
This option was considered, but not pursued as Jefferson ARTCC said they could not support 
any lateral or time extension of this MOA due to arrival and departure routes into numerous 
airports. 
4.3.2.  Lowering of Airspace under Milhouse 1 & 2 MOAs without the Eastern Expansion.  
This option would allow us to meet out LOWAT RAP requirements, but presents problems 
for AMRAAM training.  AMRAAM requires 65-mile (minimum) set-ups (85 NM airspace), 
and Milhouse MOA is only 60 miles in length.  Tooey MOA is less than 85-miles in length 
and its high utilization rate prevents the 999 FW from considering it for additional airspace 
usage. 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
63 
4.3.3.  Eastern Expansion without the Development of Sideshow MOA.  This would allow us 
to effectively meet the AMRAAM RAP requirements; however, all three units would still be 
deficient due to inability to meet LOWAT RAP requirements. 
4.3.4.  Not Establishing the Big Brinley ATCAA.  This option would be of limited value as 
AMRAAM tactics require a volume of 18,000’ of airspace.  With the floor established at 
5,000’, ATCAA airspace is required to effectively train using the AIM-120. 
4.3.5.  Deployment for LOWAT Training.  This option would be prohibitively expensive to 
implement requiring multiple deployments by the unit in order to fulfill the 153 LOWAT 
RAP missions that are required by each pilot for Spaatz AFB.  Estimates are that it would 
require three, three-week deployments to other locations to meet 153 RAP delta for LOWAT 
(364 for all three units).  Given the cost estimate of the last two weapons deployment training 
TDYs ($160K and $210K), this option is not economically feasible. 
4.3.6.  Use of the Adams MOA.  This option was considered, but not pursued as this MOA is 
155 miles from Spaatz AFB and would not permit training times of significant duration to 
accomplish necessary training. 
5.  Air Traffic Control Coordination 
On 1 Apr 07, an informal coordination meeting was held between Jefferson ARTCC and 
999th Fighter Wing representatives, with attendance from other affected agencies.  Jefferson 
ARTCC informed us that expansion of the Milhouse MOA to the north, west, or south would 
not be supportable due to existing jet route and victor airway structures and arrival procedures 
into Harrison International Airport.  Feedback from this meeting is reflected throughout this 
T/TSNS, with all affected agencies giving positive responses to the lowering of Milhouse 
MOA.  One airport, Monroe Regional Airport, voiced concerns over possible confliction with 
their ILS approach procedure.  Madison Approach Control was contacted to develop 
procedures to release a portion of the proposed Sideshow MOA to Madison Approach when 
that airspace is needed to protect IFR aircraft on the ILS approach to runway 13.  The exact 
volume of airspace has not been determined at this time; however, we will address this issue 
should this concept go forward as a formal airspace proposal.  Initial discussion suggested a 
subdivision of the Sideshow MOA.  Establishment of the Fat Brinley ATCAA above FL 210 
would create traffic flow problems for Jefferson ARTCC and exact shaping of that ATCAA 
would have to allow for the expanding waypoint system currently in development for the 
Next Generation Air Transportation System. 
6.  Other Interest Potential 
The conceptualized action and alternatives may impact the following: 
6.1.  Recreational Areas:  (Parks – federal, state, and local).  Milhouse MOA would 
overlie Roosevelt Creek National Park east of Carter County.  The park offers picnicking, 
camping, hiking, fishing, and horseback trails.  Wing leadership has briefed local park staff 
about the concept and informally assessed impacts to the natural soundscape.  The unit has an 
excellent relationship with the Chief Ranger and the Superintendent and will work further 
together to refine local procedures to minimize impacts to specific areas of the park.  There 
are no concerns for the airspace under the proposed Crowe 2 MOA. 
 
64 
DAFMAN13-201  10 DECEMBER 2020 
6.2.  Native American Reservations, Lands, or areas of special interest.  After discussion 
with public affairs and informal contact with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, there have been 
none identified for either the Sideshow or Crowe MOAs. 
6.3.  Grazing and/or farming.  The majority of the area under the conceptual airspace is 
rural; land used predominantly in forestry, and farming operations.  With a significant 
lowering of the lower altitude of the airspace, an impact is expected for these land uses.  The 
wing plans on balancing this impact by activating the Sideshow MOA no more than four 
hours per day.  There are no grazing or farming operations under the Crowe 2 MOA. 
6.4.  Endangered species.  The following endangered species are listed for the counties 
underlying the conceptual airspace:  Indigo Bat, Running Buffalo Clover, and Emerald 
Dragonfly.  The following species are listed as threatened in the vicinity of the Sideshow 
MOA:  Niagara Darter and Springfield Sneezeweed.  There are no associated species under 
Crowe 2 MOA. 
6.5.  Wildlife refuges.  The Reagan Wildlife Refuge lies just under the southeast portion of 
the Sideshow MOA.  After initial informal discussions with state and federal representatives, 
there appears to be little or no impact.  There are no impacts with the Crowe 2 MOA. 
6.6.  Hunting and fishing.  The majority of south central Johnson County offers excellent 
hunting and fishing opportunities, which is located under the current Milhouse MOA.  No 
major impoundments are affected by the concept airspace; major waterways include the Ford 
River and Kennedy Creek.  There are small ponds associated under the Crowe 2 MOA. 
6.7.  Archaeological sites.  None identified for either concept. 
6.8.  Population centers, communities, previously identified or potential noise sensitive 
areas.  The towns of Truman and Kennedy all border the conceptual Milhouse MOA to the 
west and should only experience minimal noise intrusion.  There are minimal population 
centers under the Crowe 2 MOA. 
6.9.  Ongoing litigation that may be impacted.  Ongoing litigation that may be impacted.  
Per coordination with the installation’s servicing legal office, there have been none identified 
for either concept 
6.10.  Other training airspace actions that may be impacted by this initiative.  After 
meeting with the AFREP, the wing is not aware of any other initiative in the area that will be 
impacted.  As there is no other initiative to create additional LOWAT airspace this is the only 
course of action. 
6.11.  Regional Actions by other MAJCOM or Military Services.  After briefing this 
concept at the Western Pacific Airspace and Range Council Meeting, there are no other 
duplicative actions ongoing, nor any other current airspace that will meet these requirements. 
6.12.  Consultation with other state/federal agencies.  As mentioned previously, various 
components of this concept have been briefed to FAA Air Traffic Control Management 
personnel, union representatives, and the ATREP in Springfield, NA.  Initial, informal 
feedback was very positive from each of these agencies.

6.13.  Other Aviation interest groups and agencies such as:  Aircraft Owners and Pilots 
Association (AOPA), National Business Aircraft Association (NBAA), Air Transport 
Association (ATA), State Department of Transportation and any local airport 
commission or Fixed Base Operators (FBO).  After informal discussions with local 
transportation officials, there will be little impact to the general aviation community.  The 
wing MACA program identified four FBOs whom could potentially be impacted and the 
wing has contacted two, with plans to meet with the other two in the next four months during 
normal MACA visits. 
6.14.  Other interested or affected parties.  None identified. 
7.  Engagement Planning.  To be created by unit.
