POLICIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
1.1.  Introduction.  This instruction establishes operating procedures for personnel assigned to a United 
States Air Force (USAF) Air Support Operations Center (ASOC).  Personnel will have varying 
backgrounds and skills with different levels of experience and proficiency. 
1.1.1.  ASOC Mission and Function.  The ASOC is the primary control agency of the Theater Air 
Control System (TACS) for execution of air and space power in direct support of land operations—
its primary mission is to control air operations short of the Fire Support Coordination Line (FSCL).  
Normally collocated with the senior Army fires element, the ASOC coordinates and directs air 
support for land forces at the tactical level.  The ASOC is directly subordinate to the Air and Space 
Operations Center (AOC), and is responsible for the coordination and control of air component 
missions in its assigned area.  Located within the supported ground commander’s Area of Operation 
(AO), the ASOC’s designated area typically extends to the FSCL for actual control of mission 
execution, and may extend to the corps’ forward boundary for planning and advisory purposes.  Air 
missions that fly within the ASOC’s control area but do not directly support the ground component 
will normally be coordinated through the ASOC to deconflict with ground force maneuver and fires 
in addition to receiving target and threat updates. 
1.2.  Policies.  The operating procedures outlined in this instruction facilitate the employment of ASOC 
personnel to effectively and efficiently accomplish their duties and responsibilities.  This instruction is 
applicable to operations and support personnel assigned to ASOC duty positions. 
1.3.  Responsibilities.  Specific responsibilities are listed in Table 1.1.  Air Combat Command (ACC) is

Chapter 2 
AIR SUPPORT OPERATIONS CENTER MISSION AND ORGANIZATION  
2.1.  General.  This chapter describes the composition and mission of the ASOC, and its mission within 
the TACS.  The chapter identifies responsibilities of the ASOC, describes the various ASOC duty 
positions, and how an ASOC integrates with the Army and Air Force elements of the TACS. 
2.2.  Mission.  The ASOC is the principle command and control (C2) node for integrating air and space 
power into counterland operations within the land component commander’s area of operation (AO).  As 
a subordinate element of the air and space operations center (AOC), the ASOC is responsible for the 
direction of air component assets involved in air operations directly supporting the ground combat 
element in its assigned area.  It processes and coordinates air missions requiring integration with other 
supporting arms and ground forces.  Its primary mission is to control air operations short of the fire 
support coordination line (FSCL).  The ASOC is organized into Operations and Support. 
2.2.1.  Operations.  Matches allocated air component assets to prioritized land component 
requirements.  Executes that portion of the Joint Force Air Component Commander’s (JFACC’s) Air 
Battle Plan requiring integration with ground force supporting arms and maneuver objectives.  
Maintains and enhances situational awareness to all agencies contacting the ASOC.  Provides 
procedural control of air component assets within the supported ground commander’s AO requiring 
integration with supporting arms and ground forces; processes CAS requests, and controls the flow 
of allocated aircraft; integrates aircraft operating within its assigned area (normally short of the 
FSCL) using airspace coordination measures/fire support coordination measures (ACM/FSCM); 
assigns and directs allocated air component aircraft to the joint terminal attack controllers (JTACs); 
and manages the Air Force Air Request Net (AFARN)/Joint Air Request Net (JARN) and allocated 
tactical air direction net (TAD) frequencies.  Additionally, the ASOC may coordinate in other 
mission areas, to include air interdiction (AI), information operations (IO), electronic warfare (EW), 
intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses 
(SEAD/DEAD), and joint personnel recovery, normally short of the FSCL. 
2.2.2.  Support.  The support section provides the following: administrative management and 
personnel accountability for ASOC and subordinate tactical air control party (TACP) personnel, 
long-haul communications, theater deployable communications-integrated communications access 
package (TDC-ICAP) operations, theater battle management core systems (TBMCS) connectivity, 
ASOC GATEWAY operations, Joint Range Extension and Datalink Interface Control/network 
management, power production, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), vehicle operation 
and logistics/supply operations.  Additionally, provides maintenance of assigned equipment to 
enable combat operations. 
2.2.3.  Location.  The ASOC usually collocates with the senior Army tactical echelon and 
coordinates operations with the aligned TACP, Army Fires Cell (FC), Airspace Command and 
Control (AC2) and other supporting arms (e.g. ISR), allocated aircraft, and the AOC.  The ASOC 
Director, Assistant Director and planners must consider several factors in choosing a location: 
2.2.3.1.  Communications.  The single most important factor to consider for ASOC location is its 
ability to communicate.  The ASOC should be located and equipped to maintain reliable, secure 
communications with aircraft (voice and/or digital) to its maximum operating depth.  The ASOC 
must also be able to communicate securely and effectively with all elements of the TACS, 
assigned land component tactical operations center, and other ground-based agencies.  As a 
6 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
 
subordinate element of the AOC, the ASOC must be able to collaborate and share situational 
awareness with the AOC via TBMCS, datalink, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) operations. 
2.2.3.2.  Security.  Protection from the enemy’s direct and indirect fire weapons is essential for 
the ASOC to maintain continuous operations.  As the ASOC operates in a net-centric 
environment, security of communications, networks, and datalinks is critical to mission success. 
2.2.3.3.  Multiple command posts.  The ASOC is a centralized operations center and cannot be 
split between command posts. 
2.2.4.  Functions.  The ASOC provides tactical C2 to ensure the proper, real-time integration of 
offensive air power with U.S. and coalition ground forces anywhere in the world.  As such, the 
ASOC will perform, but is not limited to, the following key functions: 
2.2.4.1.  Executes the air tasking order (ATO) as directed by the JFACC to meet the ground 
commander’s objectives by coordinating and integrating air, space  and cyber power in support 
of air component operations. 
2.2.4.2.  Provides procedural control of CAS aircraft operating in the AO inside the FSCL.  
Provides procedural control of other air component aircraft as required. 
2.2.4.3.  Establishes, maintains, and operates the autonomous reach-forward and reach-back 
communications architecture/infrastructure necessary for mission execution, to include the 
AFARN/JARN. 
2.2.4.4.  Provides decentralized execution of immediate air support in coordination with the 
established ground commander’s weight of effort and priority of fires.  Obtains clearance of fires 
from the FC. 
2.2.4.5.  Integrates, coordinates, directs and controls other air component missions, as required, 
within its assigned area (primarily inside the FSCL) in direct support of land maneuver 
objectives, and as directed by the JFACC. 
2.2.4.6.  Coordinates air missions that fly within the ASOC’s control area but do not directly 
support the ground component and other supporting arms activities (i.e. ATACM missions) to 
deconflict with ground force maneuver and fires, in addition to receiving target and threat 
updates. 
2.2.4.7.  Assists with time-sensitive targeting and friendly force location information to CAS, AI, 
SEAD, airlift/airdrop, ISR, IO, and personnel recovery missions within their AO. 
2.2.4.8.  Assists the senior air liaison officer (ALO)/TACP with advising the senior ground 
maneuver commander on the proper integration of air, space and cyber power, to include CAS 
employment, target nominations for those AI and SEAD missions that support the ground force, 
and that part of airborne ISR and airlift that directly supports the land component. 
2.2.5.  Procedures. 
2.2.5.1.  The ASOC receives the ATO, airspace control order (ACO), air operations directive, 
special instructions (SPINS), OPTASKLINK, and rules of engagement (ROE) from the AOC, 
and transmits this information, if required, to the TACPs collocated with ground maneuver units. 
2.2.5.2.  During execution of the ATO, the ASOC provides C2 for all missions tasked to the 
ASOC within the ground commander’s AO, and provides coordination, situational awareness 
and battlespace integration for air operations. 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
7 
 
2.2.5.3.  The ASOC responds to changing situations by processing requests for immediate air 
support submitted by TACPs/JTACs sent to the ASOC primarily via the AFARN/JARN, or other 
means as the ASOC directs.  Once the JTAR is approved by the ground force, the ASOC tasks 
allocated on-call missions or diverts (with supported commander approval) scheduled missions.  
The AOC will normally grant the ASOC control (launch and divert authority) of missions tasked 
to it on the ATO. 
2.2.5.3.1.  If the ASOC has not been given control of on-call or scheduled missions, they 
must receive permission and instructions from the AOC to launch or divert air support 
missions. 
2.3.  ASOC Operations Personnel and Duty Position Descriptions.  Operations personnel include 
fighter duty officers; fighter duty technicians; intelligence duty officers; and intelligence duty 
technicians.  The duty position descriptions for ASOC Operations personnel are as follows: 
2.3.1  ASOC Director.   The senior ALO, normally the corps ALO, becomes the ASOC director and 
exercises operational control (OPCON) of all subordinate TACPs.  The ASOC director is the joint force 
air component commander’s (JFACC’s) primary representative to the senior tactical ground commander. 
2.3.2.  Assistant ASOC Director.   When deployed, the ASOS commander (or designated 
representative, e.g. ASOG Deputy Commander) acts as the assistant ASOC director, and performs 
overall supervisory functions of the ASOC and personnel resources. 
2.3.3.  Fighter Duty Officer (FDO).   The FDO is normally a rated officer (pilot, navigator or air 
battle manager), but may also be a senior 1C4XX (1C471 or higher).  They are responsible for 
executing operational functions in the ASOC.  The FDO performs the following duties: 
2.3.3.1.  Senior Air Director (SAD).   The Senior Air Director is the senior ASOC officer that 
oversees ASOC personnel, and is responsible for ASOC operations.  The SAD acts as the 
primary operational liaison between the supported ground unit and the AOC on ASOC matters.  
The SAD assists the senior Corps/Division ALO with advising the senior ground maneuver 
commander on the proper integration of airpower, and coordinating air support requests (ASRs) 
through Army channels. 
2.3.3.2.  ATO Manager (ATOM).   The ATOM monitors CAS stacks; maintains situational 
awareness (SA) on the ground fight; assigns air missions to active joint tactical air strike requests 
(JTARs); maintains the status of the web air request processor (WARP) in the Theater Battle 
Management Core System (TBMCS); maintains tactical level liaison with the CAS Duty Officer 
(CASDO) at the AOC; maintains tactical level liaison with the FC duty officer in the Army 
command post (CP); and reviews target locations. 
2.3.3.3.  Air Space Manager (ASM).   The Air Space Manager, in conjunction with the Army 
AC2, assists in managing the airspace in the ground commander’s AO.  This includes 
coordinating/using ACMs, FSCMs, and killboxes/joint fires areas; and maintaining SA on all 
missions under ASOC control.  The ASM ensures ground fires and other supporting arms are 
deconflicted with ASOC controlled aircraft.  The ASM maintains tactical level liaison with 
Army’s AC2, the FC and aviation duty officers in the Army CP, control and reporting center 
(CRC), AOC Airspace Control Cell, the AOC Interdiction Duty Officer, and the Corps/Division 
TACP Interdiction Coordinator.  They also review target locations, and coordinate mission 
routing and target airspace. 
2.3.4.  Fighter Duty Technician (FDT).   The FDT assists the FDO with all his responsibilities.  The 
FDT performs the following duties: 
8 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
 
2.3.4.1.  Crew Superintendent (CS).   The Crew Superintendent is the senior enlisted 1C4 that, in 
conjunction with the SAD, oversees ASOC operations.  The CS focuses on the technical aspects 
of the ASOC processes, ensuring the JARN and PC duty position personnel are effectively 
accomplishing their duties.  The CS works with the ATOM to process immediate JTARs, and 
monitors the status of assigned TACPs and JTACs. 
2.3.4.2.  JARN Voice Operator(s).   This duty position manages the voice JARN system (i.e. 
UHF SATCOM and/or high frequency [HF]).  They record and review immediate voice JTARs 
(hardcopy DD Form 1972) to begin the JTAR tasking process.  The JARN Voice Operator 
passes the JTAR approval or disapproval (DD Form 1972 Section II or III data) back to the 
requestor.  They notify the TACPs/JTACs when assigned aircraft have checked-in with the 
ASOC, and take mission reports from the TACPs. 
2.3.4.3.  JARN Digital Operator(s).   This duty position manages the digital JARN (i.e. TACP-
Close Air Support System [CASS] to TBMCS).  Through the WARP function in TBMCS, they 
review immediate digital JTARs (softcopy DD Form 1972 in WARP) to begin the JTAR tasking 
process.  The JARN Digital Operator electronically passes the JTAR approval or disapproval 
back to the requestor.  Additionally, they are responsible for recording JTARs received by other 
digital means (i.e. integrated work station [IWS]/Internet Relay Chat [IRC], email, joint 
automated deep operations coordination system [JADOCS], etc.) and entering these JTARs into 
WARP. 
2.3.4.4.    Procedural Controller 1 (PC1).   In conjunction with the ASM, Procedural Controller 1 
is responsible for the procedural control of assigned aircraft.  PC1 coordinates with the CRC to 
accept aircraft hand-off, provides aircraft check-in briefs, and maintains SA on all ASOC 
controlled aircraft, including stack deconfliction.  They must be able to communicate with 
assigned aircraft operating in their AO.  The PC1 provides situational awareness to aircrews on 
Army supporting arms that are a factor to operations, situation update, 9-line, and targeting data, 
when available.  Position may also be manned by a FDO.  The situation update should include 
the unit mission, enemy disposition, threat activity in the target area, weather, friendly positions 
and current FSCMs/ACMs, whenever possible. 
2.3.4.5.    Procedural Controller 2 (PC2).   In conjunction with the ASM, Procedural Controller 2 
is also responsible for the procedural control of assigned aircraft.  Their duties include relaying 
JTARs to aircraft once they are tasked, and ensuring these tasked aircraft receive a hand-off to 
the TACP/JTAC.  They accept/provide aircraft check-out briefs, and ensure the aircraft receives 
a positive hand-off to a control agency upon check-out.  The PC2 records Phase 1 battle damage 
assessment (BDA) or any other in-flight report and any JTAC mission effectiveness reports, and 
provides this information to the appropriate Intel agencies.  PC2 coordinates with the CRC to 
provide hand-off of aircraft and directs aircraft back to CRC control.  Like PC1, they maintain 
SA on all ASOC controlled aircraft, and Army air missions in the vicinity of ASOC missions.  
Position may also be manned by a FDO. 
2.3.5.    Intelligence Duty Officer/Intelligence Duty Technician (IDO/T).   Intelligence personnel 
work with the FDOs and FDTs in ASOC operations as well as provide intelligence support to the 
ASOC Director.  They operate various systems to assist them in the accomplishment of the duties, 
and establish and maintain close ties to AOC intelligence functions and aligned Army G2 
intelligence staffs. 
2.3.5.1.  Monitor the battlespace, and deconflict/validate CAS requests with all targets on the 
joint integrated prioritized target list (JIPTL), as well as the restricted target list (RTL) and no-
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
9 
 
strike list (NSL).  They conduct combat assessments, and are knowledgeable in the employment 
of ISR and Non-Traditional ISR assets and capabilities. 
2.3.5.2.  Track enemy and friendly disposition, monitor order of battle, land component priority 
of fires, CAS allocation and priority, weather, and keep the ASOC aware of all threats prior to 
and during air operations.  Intel personnel ensure the ASOC is equipped with an accurate and 
effective intelligence common operating picture (COP), and perform ad hoc tasks to provide SA 
to all ASOC personnel.  They also ensure threat and AO updates are relayed to subordinate 
TACPs/JTACs and aircrew via PC 1. 
2.3.5.3.  Intel specialists record BDA and other pertinent Mission Report (MISREP) data to the 
DD Form 1972 section III via WARP, and ensure BDA and MISREP data is channeled to the 
appropriate Air Force agencies. 
2.3.5.4.  Coordinates with collocated Army intelligence cell (G-2), the ISR Division in the AOC, 
and intelligence personnel at the wing operations centers (WOC) and TACP for mission planning 
requirements.   Maintain liaison with the AOC SIDO and G-2 ISR Cell for on-going ISR flight 
operations within the ASOC’s assigned area. 
2.3.5.5.  Assist in the production of essential elements of information published in the ATO 
SPINS.  They produce and disseminate effects summaries from in-flight reports and situation 
reports from deployed TACPs/JTACs. 
2.3.5.6.  Fuse information from multiple sources to produce an ASOC common operating picture 
for better situational awareness. 
2.4.  ASOC Support Personnel and Duty Position Descriptions.  Support personnel include 
communications officers; satellite communications (SATCOM); communications/computer; ground 
radio; personnel management, power professional; HVAC; supply; and vehicle maintenance specialists. 
2.4.1.  Communications Flight Commander.   The Communications Flight Commander is the officer 
responsible for integrating communications between the ASOC, Army and AOC.  They manage and 
employ all communication and C2 networks, direct the operations of the maintenance control center 
cell, and oversee the ASOC support personnel. Manages the ASOC Gateway/datalink. 
2.5.  ASOC Integration. 
2.5.1.  Mission Integration.   The ASOC, as part of the TACS, works with the AOC, CRC, 
subordinate TACPs, forward air controllers (airborne) [FAC(As)], airborne warning and control 
system (AWACS), and joint surveillance target attack radar system (JSTARS).  The ASOC must 
coordinate directly with the elements of the Army Air-Ground System, specifically the Army 
FECC/FSE/FC, AC2, and the G-2, to establish good working relationships. 
2.5.2.    Fire Support Integration.   The ASOC must ensure the effects of air operations are closely 
integrated with the desired results of the ground commander’s scheme of maneuver.  This requires 
ASOC operations personnel to be knowledgeable of the Army’s Military Decision Making Process 
(MDMP) and its possible/selected courses of action (COAs).  This involvement includes assisting 
the Corps/division ALO/TACP in the development of ground force CAS priorities and SEAD 
contingency plans and ensuring the proper use of ISR and tactical airlift assets. 
2.5.2.1.  Fires Cell (FC).   Within the senior maneuver force commander’s staff resides the 
targeting function that supports air-to-ground operations.  Shared battlespace must be 
coordinated with the affected ground force commanders to identify and integrate with supporting 
arms (ISR, Fires, airlift, etc.) posing a threat to the safe access of air component aircraft to the 
10 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
 
target area.  The FC has the delegated authority to clear all fires within the maneuver force 
boundaries.  The ASOC and FC should have organic liaison personnel and communications with 
their respective cells.  The FC integrates lethal and non-lethal targeting processes for the ground 
commander.  The FC is responsible for target development, fire support planning and 
coordination, and electronic attack currently dispersed among multiple units and staff sections.  
Ground commanders delegate authority to the FC to conduct effects planning, recommend 
allocation of effects resources, and coordinate the supporting effects regardless of arm or service.  
The FC has electronic linkages to joint C2 systems, and receives joint personnel and equipment 
augmentation, when required.  The FC could also be referred to as the Fires and Effects 
Coordination Cell (FECC) or the Fire Support Element (FSE). 
2.5.3.  Army G-2 ISR Integration.   Land force commanders normally use an interrelated process to 
enhance joint fire support planning and interface with the joint targeting cycle by a methodology 
known as decide, detect, deliver, and assess (D3A).  D3A facilitates synchronized maneuver, 
intelligence, and fire support.  Upon execution of the collections plan, ISR assets detect HPTs and 
firing units deliver fires on them in accordance with the commander’s guidance.  The use of organic 
Army UAS assets for target acquisition and tracking presents a unique hazard to Joint Airpower 
integration requiring continuous ASOC coordination to ensure airspace deconfliction, Armed-FMV 
integration, and sensor-to-shooter support to aircrew. 
2.5.4.    Airspace Integration.   The ASOC coordinates airspace operations in the Army’s deep, close, 
and rear AOs.    This requires continuous involvement with AC2.  The ASOC and AC2 will 
nominate ACMs through Army channels to the Battlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD) for 
inclusion in the ACO.  The ASOC develops minimum risk routes (MRR) for safe passage of aircraft 
transiting through their AO, and coordinates aircraft routing from rear orbit/hold points to forward 
contact/initial points.  The ASOC monitors all ACMs within its AO.  The goal is to deconflict fixed-
wing assets with Army assets maneuvering or firing within the AO while maximizing freedom of 
maneuver and operational effectiveness.  The ACO, along with the timely execution of airspace 
coordination areas, forms the basis for procedural control that deconflicts and integrates air 
component assets.  Additionally, the ASOC should ensure its contact points are within UHF radio 
range and situate their communications systems to maximize coverage throughout the AO. 
2.5.5.    AOC Integration.   The AOC is the senior operational-level TACS element responsible for 
planning, directing, coordinating, controlling and assessing air and space operations.  The AOC 
exercises overall command and control of CAS aircraft.  The ATO, ACO, and SPINS task, 
deconflict and integrate CAS aircraft.  The ASOC is responsible for the coordination within its 
assigned area.  The ASOC normally exercises TACON of joint forces made available for tasking by 
the AOC.    The ASOC collaborates with the AOC through TBMCS, IRC, and digital/secure phone 
coordination with various combat operations elements, including the CASDO, SODO and SIDO. 
(see paragraph A2.2) 
2.5.6.    AWACS Integration.   The AWACS may provide aircraft hand-off and radio relay to the 
ASOC.  It can communicate with the ASOC via secure, jam-resistant (e.g., HAVE QUICK II) UHF, 
secure very high frequency (VHF) voice, UHF tactical satellite (TACSAT) communications, and 
Link 16.  The ASOC must plan and coordinate with AWACS air battle managers to effectively 
integrate aircraft flow and rapidly resolve airspace conflicts.  The ASOC should always notify 
AWACS and the AOC immediately upon scrambling ground-alert missions. (see paragraph A2.5) 
2.5.7.  JSTARS Integration.   The JSTARS can provide the ASOC with enhanced battlefield SA to 
facilitate effective and responsive AI and CAS operations.  It can communicate with the ASOC via 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
11 
 
secure, jam-resistant (e.g., HAVE QUICK II) UHF, secure VHF voice, and UHF TACSAT 
communications.  The ASOC or Army FC, if equipped with a Joint STARS Work Station, may be 
able to receive JSTARS moving target indicator and synthetic aperture radar imagery. (see 
paragraph A2.7) 
2.5.8.    CRC Integration.   The CRC may provide aircraft hand-off to the ASOC, and can 
communicate with the ASOC via UHF TACSAT, IRC, voice, and Link 16 communications links.  
The ASOC must plan and coordinate the CRC air battle managers to effectively integrate aircraft 
flow and rapidly resolve airspace conflicts.  The ASOC will notify the CRC and the AOC 
immediately upon scrambling ground alert missions. 
2.5.9.    TACP Integration.   The ASOC must correlate TACP/JTAC location(s) with CAS tasking to 
ensure that JTACs are available at the right place and the right time to provide required terminal 
attack control.  Additionally, TACP must report their status to the ASOC with sufficient frequency 
and detail for the ASOC to understand their operational capabilities and limitation and how the 
ASOC can support the TACPs. 
2.5.10.  FAC(A) Integration.   FAC(A), being an airborne element of the TACS, can provide the 
ASOC with the speed, flexibility and range to quickly get terminal attack control capability 
anywhere on the battlefield.  The ASOC must provide the FAC(A) with all the information pertinent 
to operating area where the ASOC tasks them.  When a TACP/JTAC is not already there, the ASOC 
must provide contact frequencies and callsigns of the ground commander and fires functions in 
addition to commander’s intent and scheme of maneuver. 
2.5.11.    TAC(A) Integration.   The Tactical Air Coordinator (Airborne) is an extension of the 
ASOC.  It is an airborne element of the TACS located far enough from threats and jamming to 
provide a communications relay between the ASOC, TACPs, and JTACs, and provides procedural 
control of CAS aircraft outside the communications range of the ASOC.  The ASOC must provide 
the TAC(A) with all of the information pertinent to the operating area where the ASOC works with 
them.

Chapter 3 
ASOC OPERATIONS 
3.1.  ASOC Execution.  The ASOC planning and coordination is meant to support ASOC execution.  In 
many instances, planning, coordination and execution will be occurring concurrently to minimize the 
time from requirement identification to support on scene.  To execute quickly and correctly and for 
maximum effect, ASOC situational awareness of assets available, land component priorities and 
pertinent coordination requirements must remain high. 
3.1.1.  CAS Execution.   Command and control of air component assets to execute joint fire support 
to meet land component requirements.  Immediate CAS missions may be filled by on-call CAS, 
diverting scheduled CAS, or requesting AOC re-role aircraft tasked to perform another mission.  The 
method depends on the ground commander’s priorities and available assets. 
3.1.1.1.  Preplanned.   Preplanned CAS are allocated CAS missions that the land component 
coordinated through their channels in time for inclusion in the ATO.  Preplanned CAS requests 
are submitted IAW procedures outlined in theater SPINS and Army standing operating 
procedures (SOPs), and are normally submitted through the fires cell (FC) at each echelon of 
command, and coordinated through the commander, TACP, FC, and G-3/S-3 at each echelon.  
Ultimately, the requests are passed to the BCD in sufficient time for inclusion in the ATO.  The 
important thing to remember about preplanned CAS is that the requesting forces must forward 
the requests up through the land component channels as soon as the need is identified.  
Preplanned CAS missions can be tasked on the ATO as either scheduled or on-call. 
3.1.1.1.1.  Scheduled.   Through the ATO planning process, scheduled CAS missions are 
designated a target and given specific mission information to meet planned ground force 
operations.  Scheduled CAS missions are designed to be employed at a flow rate that 
complements the ground commander’s scheme of maneuver.  Additionally, the ATO tasks 
these assets to support a specific ground element.  This provides lower echelons with a CAS 
window and type of aircraft/munitions availability. 
3.1.1.1.1.1.  Scheduled missions have all necessary information to find and contact the 
ASOC/TACP/JTAC.  Normally, the aircraft will contact the airspace control agency 
(CRC or AWACS) prior to transfer to the ASOC.  The JARN operator should query the 
TACP/JTAC for any mission updates prior to aircraft check-in and pass updates to the 
PC.  The PC, in turn, will pass any necessary updates (mission or threat), route the 
aircraft to the assigned contact/initial point (normally via an MRR), and include call sign, 
number and type of any other aircraft working in the area, along with any other 
supporting arms activity affecting mission accomplishment. 
3.1.1.1.1.2.  If the TACP/JTAC (on ground commander authority) cancels their scheduled 
CAS mission, the ASOC will need to look for an alternate target or killbox for the 
mission.  This may require the ASOC to place the mission into an orbit (procedural 
deconfliction) until the mission can be retasked (see paragraph 3.1.1.3 on CAS 
Divert/Retasking). 
3.1.1.1.2.  On-call.   On-Call missions identify an anticipated requirement for CAS to be 
available during a specific time period, and configured with ordnance for the anticipated 
target/desired effect.  On-call missions will not have specific information on tasking in the 
ATO, and generally maintain two alert postures: ground alert (GCAS) and airborne alert 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
13 
 
(XCAS).  The ASOC will have to pair this mission to a specific air support request and relay 
mission details.  As soon as the pairing is complete, the ASOC should relay mission details to 
the aircraft or preferably to the wing operations center, CRC and AOC prior to aircraft launch 
to provide aircrew the maximum opportunity for mission planning and target area study.  
Updates and aircraft routing should follow scheduled mission procedures once the ASOC has 
paired and passed mission details.  While awaiting tasking, the ASOC should consider on-
call aircraft’s capability to concurrently perform non-traditional ISR. 
3.1.1.2.    Immediate requests.   Immediate requests are requests that do not meet the time criteria 
for inclusion in an ATO.  The land component must provide a relative priority of immediate 
requests against other immediate and preplanned requests for the ASOC to know how to allocate 
available air component assets.  Immediate requests are passed directly to the ASOC primarily 
via the AFARN/JARN.  The ASOC must coordinate closely with the FC to understand land 
component priorities among all requests and in light of published priorities of fires. 
3.1.1.2.1.    JTAR Process.   Typically, a JTAC sends the immediate JTAR to the ASOC via 
the AFARN/JARN.  The JARN Operator receives and reviews the request.  If there are any 
discrepancies or omissions, the request will go back to the sender for clarification.  The 
request then goes to the IDO/IDT that checks the target information, threats, friendly 
locations, target environment, etc.  Again, if there are any discrepancies or omissions, the 
request will go back to the sender for clarification.  The request will then go to the ATOM.  
The ATOM will coordinate with the Army (FC, G-3 Air, or designated representative) for 
approval, and then match the request against an available CAS asset.  When the Army 
approves or disapproves a request, the JARN Operator notifies the requesting JTAC 
immediately.  The ATOM in turn notifies the ASM, who will then coordinate the routing and 
mission airspace for the assigned CAS mission sortie. 
3.1.1.2.2.  Command levels between the corps/division and originating requestor may 
disapprove the request, with reason, over the AFARN/JARN.  Silence, over the voice 
AFARN/JARN, is implied approval from intermediate echelons.  If disapproved at the 
corps/division level, the ASOC notifies the TACP of the disapproved request with the reason 
for disapproval in section 2 of the JTAR.  If approved, the ASOC sends the JTAC section 3 
of the JTAR, which includes mission number, aircraft call sign and type, number of aircraft, 
ordnance, and time-on-target. 
3.1.1.2.3.  In summary, the ASOC processes a JTAR IAW ground commander’s approval 
and guidance, deconflicts the routing and target area (coordinates with Army AC2, G-2, and 
FC, and AOC), and then matches it against available CAS missions.  Final 
approval/disapproval rests with the Army, either the ground commander or designated 
representative. 
3.1.1.2.4.  Ground Alert CAS (GCAS).   GCAS assets maintain a capability to takeoff under 
a specified launch time criteria.  Normally, the AOC delegates scramble authority to the 
ASOC.  The ASOC should scramble GCAS sorties, as necessary, to fill immediate requests 
or to backfill diverted pre-planned missions.  The ASOC contacts the WOC and directs the 
aircraft to the CP/ROP where mission information and TACP hand-off occur.  If the AOC 
retains scramble authority for ground alert aircraft, the ASOC must contact the AOC to 
request that aircraft be scrambled and sent to a CP/ROP.  Coordinate with the FC prior to 
scrambling aircraft to confirm that known requests’ priorities are sufficiently high to 
outweigh potential future requests because once the aircraft launch they cannot launch again 
14 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
 
until being refit and rearmed.  Inform TACPs/JTACs, CRC and AC2 of scramble plans and 
time before assets will be on station. 
3.1.1.2.5.  Airborne CAS (XCAS).   XCAS are airborne assets that loiter at a predetermined 
orbit point awaiting tasking.  If not tasked prior to a designated fuel state or end of 
vulnerability time, the aircraft must be tasked to a secondary target or killbox/ACM/FSCM to 
optimize air assets.  Unpaired airborne on-call missions will probably be the most responsive 
available asset, but may not have optimum ordnance, sensors or target acquisition.  
Coordinate XCAS pairing to immediate requests with the FC.  Inform TACPs/JTACs, CRC 
and AC2 of pairings. 
3.1.1.3.  CAS Divert/Retasking.   For immediate requests with a higher priority than pre-planned 
missions, when on-call assets are not available or cannot achieve the desired effect, the ASOC 
will coordinate with the FC to divert the pre-planned mission to the higher priority immediate 
request.  With FC/ground commander approval, inform the pre-planned requester (TACP/JTAC) 
of the diversion and any plans to backfill the diverted assets.  Inform all affected TACPs/JTACs 
of CAS divert plans. 
3.1.1.4.    Re-role Missions.   Should the ASOC exhaust all allocated assets or the land 
component submit immediate requests requiring specialized effects, the ASOC may need to 
request a re-role of other assets under AOC control to meet land component requirements.  Final 
approval/disapproval authority for a re-role mission is at the AOC.  Should the AOC re-role 
assets, the ASOC will have to provide re-roled aircrews with all mission details for planning and 
execution.  Additionally, coordinate with the FC to fully integrate re-roled aircraft into the land 
component fire support plan. 
3.1.1.5.    Aircraft Check-in.   ASOC must provide aircrew with pertinent information for 
mission accomplishment.  The ASOC must inform aircrew of threats (enemy or environmental) 
within their working AO, land component’s priority targets, closest friendlies (if available), any 
friendly artillery missions (include impact coordinates, gun to target line, max ordinate) or other 
friendly supporting arms activity affecting their AO (ISR, EW, helicopters, etc.), other aircraft 
operating in the AO, and call sign, frequency and handover point of agency providing control 
and clearance of fire.  This may include directing the mission aircraft from the CP/ROP to the 
appropriate IP for execution.  For pre-planned missions, the ASOC only needs to provide 
changes or situation updates to ATO information and threat briefs.  The ASOC should 
authenticate any aircraft not operating in secure modes after routing aircraft to prevent conflicts.  
The procedural controller normally receives the hand-off from the CRC and checks in aircraft.  If 
out of voice radio range of the CP/ROP, the process can use Link-16 or the CRC, AWACS, 
JSTARS or FAC(A) to relay the pertinent information. 
3.1.1.6.    Aircraft Check-out.   ASOC must understand and disseminate aircraft generated 
effects.  Aircrew should pass mission results, including BDA, during check-out for the ASOC to 
document on the Inflight Report (JP 3-09.3) to indicate air component fulfillment of the land 
component request.  ASOC must route aircraft to prevent conflict and to expedite the aircraft’s 
RTB for refit and rearm.  The procedural controller normally notifies the CRC of the hand-off 
and checks out aircraft. 
3.1.2.    ISR Execution.  Many land component requests will include specified or implied requests 
for ISR support.  ASOC personnel must anticipate and actively pursue ISR that enhance fulfilling 
land component support requests. 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
15 
 
3.1.2.1.  Collection Management changes.   ASOC intelligence functions must maintain 
situational awareness on available ISR assets and leverage their capabilities to enhance or fulfill 
land component requirements.  The ASOC must maintain a close liaison with the AOC SIDO 
and request information available from AOC level ISR sources. 
3.1.2.2.    Non-traditional ISR options.  Tactical level target acquisition and avionics systems 
include an inherent capability to provide ISR.  The ASOC must leverage these non-traditional 
sources of ISR when the opportunity presents itself.  The ASOC can use unpaired XCAS holding 
in CAS stacks, aircraft enroute to or from target areas and completed mission with time on 
station still available to meet land component ISR requirements without tasking additional air 
component assets. 
3.1.3.    Air Interdiction.  AI missions are normally under the control of the JAOC and 
CRC/AWACS, however, AI missions short of the FSCL must be coordinated with the ASOC.  The 
ASOC must coordinate with the FC, AC2, G2, and AMD to ensure safety of friendly personnel.  The 
ASOC may be responsible for coordinating the opening and closing of killboxes or Joint Fires Areas 
for AI engagements.  While the ASOC normally does not provide targeting information to AI 
missions, it may be required to do so for dynamic attacks.  The ASOC is also responsible for 
tracking AI missions in their supported ground unit’s AO. 
3.1.4.    SEAD Execution.   Enemy air defense present a direct threat to the effective and efficient 
application of airpower.  The ASOC should use all avenues to mitigate threats to CAS assets and 
other assets supporting the land component 
3.1.4.1.  Pre-planned SEAD.   ASOC should preview pre-planned missions for SEAD plans and 
allocated SEAD assets for mission scheduled into areas of known threats.  Query TACPs if 
SEAD plans are inadequate. 
3.1.4.2.  Pop-up SEAD.   ASOC should request SEAD support for all pop-up threats that will 
affect known missions.  First request SEAD support from organic land component assets before 
requesting theater level SEAD support from the AOC. 
3.1.4.3.  Clearance of fire.  If non-land component assets are providing SEAD support, the 
ASOC must plan how the assets will get clearance of fire to expend ordnance within the land 
component AO.  The ASOC can request that the assets contact the JTAC to get clearance of fire 
from the local ground commanders or the ASOC can work clearance of fire through the FC.  If 
requesting clearance of fire from the FC, provide attack axis, TOT window and launch altitude 
3.1.5.  EW/IO Execution.   EW/IO assets operating with the ASOC AO require procedural control 
and integration within the ASOC airspace.  Transit routes or orbits and altitudes must mesh with 
other airspace users.  The ASOC must maintain reliable communication contact in order to meet 
their procedural control responsibility 
3.1.5.1.  Kinetic (leaflet drops, etc) and Non-Kinetic (Jamming) EW/IO effects must also be 
coordinated to allow freedom of action for Joint Air operations.  IO effects may negatively 
impact other Counterland operations without coordination with the ASOC. 
3.1.6.    CSAR and other specialized missions.   CSAR or other specialized mission may require 
large volumes of airspace requiring ACMs that may not be under the control of the ASOC.  ASOC 
planning must include any missions that will transit or have ACMs in the ASOC AO.  The ASOC 
will coordinate with the AOC, CRC, and assist the on-scene commander as required/directed.  Even 
though the ASOC will not have control, the on-scene commander or controlling agency may require 
the ASOC to coordinate land component clearance of fires for assets working there. 
16 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
 
3.1.7.  Airlift.   Airlift is not an inherent function of the ASOC, but airlift/airdrop missions operating 
within the ASOC AO may require procedural control and integration from CRC hand-off to entry in 
their restricted operating area (ROA)/restricted operating zone (ROZ).  Once in the ROA/ROZ, if 
aircraft are under ASOC control, the ASOC normally hands-off the aircraft to a terminal controller.  
ASOC airspace planning must incorporate all airspace users even if not under direct mission control 
of the ASOC. 
3.1.8.  Air Tasking Order/Airspace Control Order/Special Instructions Dissemination.   The AOC 
disseminates the ATO to the ASOC via TBMCS.  If TBMCS is not available, the AOC may use 
other means, such as the secret internet protocol network (SIPRNET), the Army’s JADOCS, or 
AFATDS via the BCD to transmit the ATO.  The ASOC parses the pertinent information from the 
ATO, ACO and SPINS, and if required, sends that information to their assigned TACPs.  TACPs 
should be able to parse their own pertinent information from JADOCS or AFATDS. 
3.2.  ASOC Coordination.  The ASOC mission to execute the Air Battle Plan requiring integration with 
Army supporting arms and maneuver requires coordination crossing functional component boundaries.  
To make timely and appropriate Airpower decisions, to include matching land component requirements 
to airpower capabilities, the ASOC must have high situational awareness and be able to coordinate with 
all affected agencies in near real time.  This requires that the ASOC have systems capable of interfacing 
into air and land component command and control systems. 
3.2.1.  Systems.   The ASOC must have and use systems that permit cross component collaboration, 
that can gain the situational awareness necessary to make well founded recommendations that 
correctly match air component capabilities to immediate land component air support requests, and 
systems that automate mission tracking to maintain all affected agencies’ SA. 
3.2.1.1.  Collaboration.   Tools include internet chat rooms, meetings/briefings, telephone calls 
and VTCs.  Systems include, but not limited to, TBMCS Web applications (WARP, ESTAT, 
etc.), SIPRNET, JABBER, Adobe Connect, IRC, IWS, JADOCS Managers, VOIP/ROIP, 
Command Post of the Future (CPoF), and telephone switches. 
3.2.1.2.  Common Operating Picture.   The ASOC must maintain a common operating picture to 
maximize SA of its AO.  The necessary information includes pertinent data from the land and air 
components on friendly/enemy orders of battle, maneuver boundaries, active FSCMs and ACMs, 
current reference points, current air tracks, target and air threat locations.  Systems include 
JADOCS, C2PC, TBMCS WEBMAP, TACP-CASS, Falconview, and various ISR feeds. 
3.2.1.3.  Automated mission tracking.   TBMCS automated mission tracking displays the current 
Air Battle Plan execution, and provides all users with current information on the status and 
tasking of air component resources.  ESTAT/WARP applications show available resources and 
permit automated matching of allocated air component resources to preplanned and immediate 
land component requirements.  Each command and control center updates the system during 
mission progression.  That information gives the ASOC necessary data to choose the best option 
for meeting dynamic situations. 
3.2.2.    Internal Coordination.  Prior to executing, the ASOC needs to share information, situational 
awareness, confer and reach a conclusion on the best course of action to take based on land 
component requirements and priorities.  An internal ASOC chat room has proved successful as a 
collaboration tool to disseminate information across all positions rapidly.  Each duty position should 
have input, but the final decision will rest with the SAD or in his absence the ATOM. 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
17 
 
3.2.3.    External Coordination.  The ASOC links the air component to the land component and 
melds the operational to the tactical.  The ASOC has a requirement to coordinate with air and land 
command and control at operational and tactical levels. 
3.2.3.1.  Land Component. 
3.2.3.1.1.  FC/FECC/FSE.  The ASOC must coordinate with the FC when changing planned 
resources or matching on-call assets to immediate requests.  The ASOC must also get 
clearance of fire from the FC for air component assets employing ordnance not under the 
control of a JTAC. 
3.2.3.1.2.  AC2.  As the delegated land component authority for airspace, the ASOC must 
coordinate and integrate air component airspace requirements with AC2.  Procedural control 
plans, reference points and ACMs needs close coordination with AC2 to ensure air and land 
components make maximum use of AO airspace. 
3.2.3.1.3.  G2.  Land component intelligence sources can provide a plethora of information 
on enemy ground order of battle and courses of action.  Establishing, maintaining and 
enhancing links between air and land intelligence functions can only improve ASOC 
situational awareness and understanding of land component collection requirements. 
3.2.3.1.4.  Ground Commander.  As the delegated authority within maneuver boundaries, the 
ground commander initiates preplanned and immediate air support requests that creates a 
requirement for air support.  The ASOC’s conduit for coordination with the ground 
commander is the TACP. 
3.2.3.2.  Air Component. 
3.2.3.2.1.  AOC.  As the senior element of the TACS, the AOC does the operational planning 
that results in the allocated resources of the ATO.  The ASOC needs to keep operational level 
decision makers’ situational awareness as high a possible by providing mission updates via 
TBMCS ESTAT/WARP. 
3.2.3.2.1.1.  CASDO.  As the designated manager of JFACC CAS assets, the CASDO is 
a key element for the ASOC to consult in recommending assets to the land component.  
The CASDO also acts as a conduit for the ASOC to leverage supplemental resources for 
SEAD, CSAR, tankers and re-role AI assets from other members of the combat 
operations cell. 
3.2.3.2.1.2.  SIDO.  As the designated operational manager of JFACC intelligence, the 
SIDO is a key element for the ASOC to consult when needing information and real time 
ISR.  Since the JFACC is normally designated collection operations management (COM) 
authority, the CCO exercises COM for JFACC ISR assets.  Through close coordination 
with the SIDO, the ASOC IDO/IDT can use the RSTA to ensure the supported land 
component has the necessary ISR assets available if/when an immediate request arises.  
In some cases, the SIDO can delegate COM for tactical ISR assets to the ASOC to assist 
the TACP, e.g. MQ-1. 
3.2.3.2.1.3.  Airspace Management Cell.  The airspace management cell of the AOC 
normally fulfills the JFACC assigned responsibility for Airspace Control Authority.  In 
conjunction with AC2 the ASOC should coordinate ACMs and procedural control plans 
with the AOC airspace management cell in order for the ACO/SPINS to contain the 
necessary information for aircrew and controllers. 
18 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
 
3.2.3.2.2.  Aircraft/WOC.  To optimize combat airpower and enhance safety of friendly air 
operations, the ASOC needs to create and coordinate procedural control plans that allocated 
aircraft can easily understand and execute.  The broader the dissemination of their local 
airspace control plan through such vehicles as the ACO will permit aircrew and wings to plan 
more efficiently. 
3.2.3.2.3.  TACP/JTAC.  Mobile field units may not always have access to all C2 systems.  It 
is incumbent on the ASOC to ensure subordinate TACPs/JTACs have all necessary 
information, to include ATO, ACO, and SPINS, in a useful format.  This may mean that the 
ASOC parses and reformats ATO, ACO, and/or SPINS information and disseminates to 
subordinate TACPs/JTACs via secure and reliable methods.  This may require using 
available land component systems such as JADOCS or AFATDS.  War is a dynamic 
endeavor and the ASOC should query TACPs/JTACs on status and obtain situation updates 
about their tactical situation and equipment operability. 
3.2.3.2.4.  CRC/AWACS/JSTARS.  The ASOC must provide and get information from all 
other TACS elements.  CRC and AWACS provide airspace information and aircraft handoff 
sequencing.  JSTARS provides information on the dynamics of the ground situation.  As a 
command and control node, the ASOC must work to maintain and provide high levels of 
situational awareness to all entities with which it has contact. 
3.3.  ASOC Planning.  While TACP ALOs and JTAC have primary responsibility for planning air 
support of ground forces, the ASOC must remain cognizant of these planning efforts and the criteria 
applied in deciding on the approved course of action.  Similarly, while the AOC has primary 
responsibility for planning air operations, the ASOC must perform many planning functions in deciding 
what capability to match to immediate air support requests. 
3.3.1.  Understand the joint force commander’s objectives with associated operational-level effects 
and assessment indicators and the implications to ASOC Operations.  The CONOPS will set 
priorities between and among the functional components that directly affect resources allocation and 
hence ASOC resource allocation real-time decisions of air support assets to land component 
requirements. 
3.3.2.  Understand the land component air support requirement driven by the CONOPS, primarily in 
the Operational Fires section. 
3.3.2.1.  Know land component objectives.  The MDMP (See Attachment 3) will produce a five 
paragraph operations order (OPORD) or fragmentary order (FRAGO) that contains all critical 
information outlining ground commander’s intent, objectives, scheme of maneuver and fire 
support plan that drives the requirement for air component delivered joint fire support.  ASOC 
daily planning starts with reviewing and understanding the current OPORDs and FRAGOs. 
3.3.2.2.  Know land component priority of fire/fire support concept, and review land component 
target synchronization matrix.  That same OPORD or FRAGO will either have paragraphs that 
spells out priority of fires among and between the various subordinate units or may have an 
Annex D that gets even more specific about joint fire support concepts.  ASOC decisions must 
reflect these same priorities. 
3.3.2.3.  Understand land component battlespace and its implications to ASOC operations. 
3.3.2.3.1.  Unit maneuver boundaries and associated TACP/JTACs.  ASOC planning must 
include a detailed understanding of the friendly order of battle and how the various maneuver 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
19 
 
units will accomplish the scheme of maneuver.  This ASOC planning also needs to correlate 
ground unit designation with associated TACP/JTACs. 
3.3.2.3.2.  Fire support coordination measures.  Permissive and restrictive fire support 
coordination measures will apply equally to all components whether the fire is ground or air 
delivered.  The ASOC must know and then communicate these measures to aircraft and 
TACPs. 
3.3.2.3.3.  Enemy ground order of battle.  Equally important to understanding friendly order 
of battle is detailed knowledge of enemy order of battle that correlates unit designation to 
combat capability and equipment type. 
3.3.2.3.4.  Know the Support Crew requirements for proper site location(s) for the TDC-
ICAP equipment, and logistics areas for maintenance and personnel support. 
3.3.2.3.5.  Know the requirements for the life support area site setup, and Army-provided 
requirements such as security, food, water, ammunition, and medical care. 
3.3.3.  Understand the air component commander’s direction/intent and those resources allocated to 
support land component objectives from the AOD and ATO. 
3.3.3.1.  Know the air component resources allocated to support land component from the AOD 
and ATO as driven by JFC apportionment. 
3.3.3.1.1.  Know preplanned and on-call CAS resources.  ASOC planning must discriminate 
between allocated missions that have already been planned and approved within ground force 
coordination channels and missions that the JFACC allocated to CAS but are on-call to meet 
emerging land component requirements.  Preplanned missions have sufficient information 
within the ATO to find and contact their JTAC in order to complete their tasking, but will 
require updated information from the ASOC on factors impacting safe access to the target 
area.  Supplemental information from the ASOC will improve mission accomplishment 
through situation updates and enhance safety of flight through procedural control integration 
and deconfliction with other airspace users.  On-call missions, either XCAS or GCAS, will 
require additional information from the ASOC or other command and control agencies to 
provide fire support or create effects.  By studying and understanding mission types, the 
ASOC can customize situation updates for aircrafts. 
3.3.3.1.2.  Understand the capability and limitations of ATO allocated resources. 
3.3.3.1.2.1.  Aircraft.  Know aircraft data such things as speed, range, fuel capacity and 
primary mission/pilot proficiency to consider mission impact on time to reach a target 
area versus time available, number of engageable targets, loiter time in target area and 
time required to integrate into the ground commander’s fire support plan.  Know the 
aircraft digital communications capabilities and addresses.  Other important factors are 
susceptibility to air defenses (ground or air), available countermeasures and 
communications capability. 
3.3.3.1.2.2.  Munitions (kinetic and non-kinetic).  Know munitions data such things as 
specific number and type of munitions carried, guidance methods (precision, non-
precision) and requirements (coordinate type, laser/thermal), effects of weather, weapons 
effects and ways to alter effects, danger close distance and potential impact on friendly or 
follow-on forces.  GPS system accuracies based on current satellite configuration. 
3.3.3.1.2.3.  Sensors and avionics.  Know how the sensors and avionics available in 
20 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
 
targeting pods, radars or munitions along with navigation and data links will assist in 
target acquisition and engagement. 
3.3.3.1.2.4.  Enemy air order of battle/air defense.  Know and understand the air defense 
threat of the ASOC AO and its impact on allocated aircraft types to include planning how 
to suppress threats prioritized by mission.  Find this information in air component 
intelligence summaries. 
3.3.3.1.3.  Identify pertinent supplemental support resources available. 
3.3.3.1.3.1.  ISR, SEAD, EW, IO, AI/INT, Tanker, CSAR, Airlift.  Know available assets 
and how to access their capability through the AOC divisions, cells or teams or other 
TACS agencies.  The land component may require ISR, EW, IO, CSAR or airlift effects.  
Aircraft allocated to work with the ASOC may require SEAD, EW, Tanker or CSAR 
effects.  AI/INT is a possible source should CAS priority require re-role of assets. 
3.3.3.2.  Understand airspace as outlined in the ACP, ACO, SPINS, ADP and host nation 
procedures. 
3.3.3.2.1.  ASOC lateral and vertical limits.  The FSCL, unit boundaries and hand-off points 
will likely define the lateral limits of airspace where the ASOC will exercise procedural 
control.  Know the vertical limits as well.  The coordinating altitude is usually the ASOC 
floor and requires coordination with AC2 for aircraft working below that altitude.  The upper 
limit depends on many factors, but it should generally not be less than 20,000 ft with at least 
10,000 feet of vertical altitude available.  SPINS should contain information on altitudes, 
ingress and egress routes. 
3.3.3.2.2.  Adjacent control agencies.  Know the call sign and contact frequency or 
coordination method for all adjacent agencies, lateral and vertical.  For air component 
frequencies, consult the SPINS.  For land component frequencies, consult the command and 
signal paragraph of the OPORD. 
3.3.3.2.3.  Applicable airspace coordination measures and reference points.  Know and plot 
all ACMs within the vertical and lateral limits of the ASOC airspace.  Know distances to 
important ACMs such as tanker tracks and MRRs.  Know and plot orbit/hold points, contact 
points, hand-off/over points, TACP/JTAC initial points.  Provide inputs as required to change 
ACO reference points.  Coordinate with AC2 to understand land component airspace. 
3.3.3.2.4.  Understand implications of current and forecast weather conditions for the ASOC 
AO, as well as the launch/divert base status.  Knowing all the above, know how weather will 
affect/limit ASOC procedural control options and capability to safely route aircraft to and 
from tasking.  Base weather conditions could affect aircraft availability and timing.  
Coordinate as needed with AWACS and CRC to mitigate any identified limitations.  Air 
Force weather teams, collocated with ground forces, will have weather information available. 
3.3.3.2.5.  Plan aircraft ingress and egress routing from hold/orbit points to TACP/JTAC 
contact/initial points.  Use altitudes in accordance with the above and promulgated 
procedures in SPINS.  Using all the above planning information develop aircraft ingress and 
egress routes and altitudes that minimizes potential conflicts and optimize the flow of aircraft 
into the land components battlespace. 
3.3.4.  Understand joint, land and air components’ communications plans from J6, G6 and A6. 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
21 
 
3.3.4.1.  Know allocated frequencies.  Use assigned frequencies to maintain connectivity with the 
AOC, TACPs, aircraft and assigned ground unit headquarters. 
3.3.4.2.  Air control and tactical air direction nets. 
3.3.4.2.1.  JARN/AFARN.  Operate and disseminate JARN protocols. 
3.3.4.2.2.  ASOC chat rooms.  Create or find appropriate chat rooms to coordinate and 
execute each duty position.  As a minimum, the ASOC should plan to have an internal chat 
room for coordination between crew positions and an external chat room to disseminate 
ASOC guidance or direction.  The ASOC should be in an FC, CASDO, SIDO and 
AC2/Airspace Management Cell chat room, if established.  Chat room organization should 
be identified in the component communication plans. 
3.3.4.2.3.  Tactical data links.  The ASOC must set up and use ASOC systems to establish 
and maintain data link connectivity.  The ASOC is responsible for ensuring OPTASKLINK 
compliance by subordinate TACPs and JTACs, activating filters, evaluating link 
effectiveness, monitoring track exchanges, validating ad ensuring tracks are dropped when 
directed, and initiating data link messages onto the link when directed.  The ASOC will also 
provide the TACP/JTAC with track numbers and update the Mission Planner file. 
3.3.4.3.  Know command and control communications architecture.  Communication flight needs 
to understand how they fit into the larger command and control network and what unique 
capabilities, such as TDC-ICAP, ASOC Gateway and TACP-CASS that they bring to their AO. 
3.3.4.3.1.  Air component – reference SPINS and component communication plans. 
3.3.4.3.2.  Land component – reference OPORD/FRAGO command and signal paragraphs.

THEATER AIR CONTROL SYSTEM 
A2.1.  Theater Air Control System (TACS) Integration.  The TACS, based on the tenet of centralized 
control and decentralized execution, is well suited for CAS planning and execution through liaison with 
the ground forces.  In the AOC, CAS planning and execution is facilitated through integration of the 
battlefield coordination detachment (BCD), special operations liaison element (SOLE), naval and 
amphibious liaison element, and Marine liaison officer.  Finally, the AOC CASDO works with the 
ASOC to provide assets to the TACP or JTAC in the field who have the responsibility to direct the 
delivery of weapons on target. 
A2.2.  AOC Combat Operations.  The CASDO and the SIDO are normally the focal point for CAS 
issues in the AOC Combat Operations Division.  ASOCs work in close coordination with the CASDO 
and SIDO for immediate CAS concerns with the AOC.  The CASDO is often in charge of a CAS cell 
made up of CAS experts, JTACs, or ALOs and is responsible for the following: 
A2.2.1.  Monitors execution of the ATO to optimize support to the battle situation. 
A2.2.2.  Ensures the WOCs for each asset are informed of changes in the ATO, and the WOCs 
coordinate their own changes with the AOC. 
A2.2.3.  Remains in close contact with the ASOC via radio, phone, or secure Internet relay chat 
programs (e.g., IRC, IWS or Jabber). 
A2.2.4.  Informs the senior operations duty officer (SODO) of potential deviations from the ATO.  
Additionally, up channels recommendations if inefficiency is noted in areas such as inappropriate 
munitions load, aircraft not flying primary mission, excessive tanker off load, and so forth. 
A2.2.5.  Coordinates with the BCD to ensure the joint force land component commander (JFLCC) 
CAS objectives are being met. 
A2.2.6.  Coordinates with the SODO and BCD to re-role AI missions to CAS, when necessary. 
A2.2.7.  Ensures SODO/chief of combat operations is updated on killbox/ACM/FSCM status. 
A2.3.  Battlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD).  The BCD is the JFLCC’s liaison to the air 
component.  The BCD represents the JFLCC and keeps the AOC informed of changing ground unit 
locations, requests airspace control measures for the JFLCC, advises of shifting CAS priorities, receives 
preplanned CAS requests, and aids in CAS request prioritization for ATO inclusion. 
A2.4.  Special Operations Liaison Element (SOLE).  Like the BCD, the SOLE provides the same 
functions for the special operations component command.  Due to the nature of special operations forces 
(SOF), it is imperative that deconfliction for airpower, especially in open Air Force killboxes/joint fires 
areas or beyond the FSCL, is coordinated real-time with the SOLE. 
A2.5.  Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Integration.  The AWACS can provide 
aircraft hand-off and radio relay to the ASOC.  It can be connected to the ASOC via secure, jam-
resistant (HAVE QUICK II) UHF, clear VHF voice, and secure UHF SATCOM.  The ASOC must 
effectively plan and coordinate with AWACS via the air operations C2 net to integrate aircraft flow and 
resolve airspace conflicts.  The ASOC should always notify AWACS and the AOC immediately upon 
scrambling ground-alert CAS missions. 
A2.6.  Control and Reporting Center (CRC) Integration.  The CRC provides control of air assets, 
provides aircraft hand-off to the ASOC or other controlling agencies (e.g. U.S. Marines’ direct air 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
29 
 
support center), and can be connected to the ASOC via HAVE QUICK UHF, secure VHF voice, and 
secure UHF SATCOM links.  The CRC also provides air defense warnings to the ASOC when required. 
A2.7.  Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Integration.  JSTARS can provide 
the ASOC with enhanced battlefield SA to facilitate effective and responsive CAS operations.  The 
ASOC or Army FC, if so equipped, may be able to receive JSTARS moving target indicator (MTI) and 
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery.  MTI is normally used to locate enemy units and potential 
targets.  MTI/SAR imagery can also be cross-checked with other real-time ISR feeds from unmanned 
aerial vehicles (UAVs) and RC-135 Rivet Joint.  The ASOC can also use the MTI display to correlate 
friendly and enemy information attained from other sources used in the target prioritization process.  
When required, the AOC can delegate limited ASOC functions to the JSTARS.  It is imperative that an 
Army G-3 element with CAS approval authority be in immediate radio contact with the JSTARS 
mission crew. (For more information on JSTARS integration, see AFTTP 3-1.30, Tactical Employment 
– JSTARS) 
A2.8.  Forward Air Controller (Airborne) [(FAC(A)].  Due to the inherent nature of airpower, the 
FAC(A) brings several important advantages to the fight: rapid response, range, and agility on the 
battlefield; broader situational awareness; good communications linkage with other elements of the 
TACS; and an airborne perspective of the battlefield.  When able to work in conjunction with JTACs, 
the FAC(A) complements the JTAC’s unique capabilities and perspective on the battle as an airborne 
extension of the TACP. 
A2.9.  Tactical Air Control Party (TACP).  The TACP is the principal Air Force liaison element 
aligned with Army maneuver units from battalion through corps.  The primary mission of corps through 
brigade-level TACPs is to advise their respective ground commanders and staffs on the capabilities and 
limitations of air, space and cyber power, and assist the ground commander in planning, requesting, 
deconflicting, and coordinating CAS, air interdiction, airlift, and ISR.  The battalion TACP provides the 
primary terminal attack control of CAS in support of ground forces. 
A2.10.  Joint Special Operations Air Component (JSOAC).  Although not part of the TACS, the 
JSOAC maintains a small fleet of fixed- and rotary-wing assets for use by the joint force special 
operations component commander (JFSOCC).  Some of these aircraft, such as the AC-130, are capable 
of performing CAS but may only be used if released to the JFACC for tasking. 
A2.10.1.  Special Operations Command and Control Element (SOCCE).  The SOCCE is subordinate 
to the JFSOCC, and performs C2 or liaison functions according to mission requirements and as 
directed by the JFSOCC.  Its level of authority and responsibility may vary widely.  It is the C2 focal 
point for CAS requests for SOF units in support of a conventional joint or Service force. 
A2.11.  Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance (SCAR).  A mission flown for the purpose of 
detecting targets and coordinating or performing attack or reconnaissance on those targets. Strike 
coordination and reconnaissance missions are flown in a specific geographic area and are an element of 
the command and control interface to coordinate multiple flights, detect and attack targets, neutralize 
enemy air defenses and provide battle damage assessment. (JP 1-02)  SCAR missions may serve as an 
extension of the ASOC in areas where FAC-As are not available. 
A2.12.  Tactical Air Coordinator (Airborne) [TAC(A)].  An officer who coordinates, from an aircraft, 
the actions of other aircraft engaged in air support of ground or sea forces. (JP 1-02)   The TAC-A 
serves as an extension of the ASOC.  The TAC(A) may provide communications relay between the 
ASOC and aircraft under its control, and may assist the ASOC by providing localized area control 
between the ASOC and JTAC, such as during ―heavy traffic‖ CAS operations.

MILITARY DECISION MAKING PROCESS 
A3.1.  General.  While the ASOC is a primary C2 node in the TACS, it is also a customer of 
information produced by the Army’s Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).  The TACP is 
primarily responsible for participating in MDMP; however, understanding the process provides greater 
ASOC insight into actual ground force requirements.  Furthermore, ASOC personnel may be required to 
assist ALOs with the planning process as a tertiary ASOC function.  Detailed information on the MDMP 
can be found in FM 5-0, Army Planning and Orders Production 
A3.1.1.  The Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) has seven steps.  Each step in the process 
begins with an input that builds upon the previous steps, and each step has an output that drives 
subsequent steps. 
A3.2.  MDMP Steps.  The seven steps in the MDMP are:  Receipt of Mission; Mission Analysis; 
Course of Action (COA) Development; COA Analysis; COA Comparison; COA Approval; and Orders 
Production. 
A3.2.1.  Step 1 – Receipt of Mission.  The decision making process begins with the receipt or 
anticipation of a new mission, and is itself a six-part process that takes approximately 45 minutes.  
Typically, a corps may be planning for an operation 72 hours in advance, a division for 48 hours, a 
brigade for 12 to 24 hours, and a battalion for 6 to 8 hours; although based on the type of mission, 
time to execute could be compressed.  Receipt of mission consists of staff alert (ALO notified), 
preparation (read applicable portion of HHQ notification), initial assessment conducted (determine 
resources and constraints), available time allocation, commander’s initial guidance issued (ALO 
assists), and warning order issued. 
A3.2.2.  Step 2 – Mission Analysis.  Mission analysis is the most crucial step of the MDMP.  
Mission analysis is a 17-step process (steps are not included in this document) which uses the 
METT-TC (Mission, Enemy, Terrain and weather, Troops and support available – Time available, 
Civil considerations) process to define the mission objectives.  It is also the beginning of the process 
to determine possible courses of action.  The ground commander will release the approved mission 
statement which will clearly define the unit’s mission. 
A3.2.3.  Step 3 – Course of Action (COA) Development.  After receiving guidance, the staff 
develops COAs for analysis and comparison.  The commander’s guidance and intent focuses staff 
creativity toward producing a comprehensive, flexible plan within available time constraints.  COA 
development consists of six steps: 
A3.2.3.1.  Analyze Relative Combat Power.  Typically accomplished by weighing the individual 
effectiveness of air and space platforms against anticipated enemy surface forces, including 
ADA threats and assigning numerical values in order to determine force ratios. 
A3.2.3.2.  Generate Options.  Develop the possible COAs. 
A3.2.3.3.  Array Initial Forces.  Identifies the total number of units needed, develops a base of 
knowledge to make decisions, and identifies possible methods of dealing with the enemy during 
scheme of maneuver development. 
A3.2.3.4.  Develop the Scheme of Maneuver.  Develops the scheme of maneuver, which 
describes how arrayed forces will accomplish the commander’s intent.  The ALO assists in 
developing engagement areas, target areas of interest, triggers, objective areas, and obstacle plan, 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
31 
 
and a movement plan.  This also includes determining - at the division and brigade - who will 
work at the tactical operations center (TOC) and tactical command posts.  For the battalion, this 
means determining where to place the forward-based JTAC teams. 
A3.2.3.5.  Assign Headquarters.  Staff assigns headquarters to groupings of forces, and creates a 
task organization. 
A3.2.3.6.  Prepare COA Statements and Sketches.  Involves development of COA statements and 
battle graphics sketches to clearly portray how the unit will accomplish the assigned mission. 
3.2.4.  Step 4 – COA Analysis (War Game).  The COA analysis identifies the best COA based on the 
commander’s intent.  The war game is a disciplined process that attempts to visualize the flow of a battle.  
During the war game, the staff begins to develop a detailed plan and determines the strengths and 
weaknesses of each COA. 
3.2.5.  Step 5 – COA Comparison.  COA comparison is a systematic method for choosing the best COA 
from the developed COAs.  The TACP must identify strengths and weaknesses associated with each 
COA.  The TACP must provide accurate Air Force data for inclusion in the Army decision matrix.  The 
planning team will decide the best means for employment of air and space power based on the decision 
matrix.  The TACP must compare, critique, and refine the plan based on the tenets of air and space 
power. 
3.2.6.  Step 6 – COA Approval.  The ground commander selects the optimum COA during this stage.  
The staff will start the entire process over again if the commander rejects all developed COAs.  The 
approved COA is refined into a final plan and is normally the basis for the OPORD. 
3.2.7.  Step 7 – Orders Publication.  Once the rehearsal results are known, the staff issues the OPORD 
based on the commander’s final guidance.  The commanders ensure each TACP and ASOC member 
understands the plan and are prepared to implement it.

COMMUNICATIONS LINKS/NETS 
A4.1.  Air Force Air Request Net (AFARN)/Joint Air Request Net (JARN).  The AFARN/JARN is 
the C2 link between the ASOC and subordinate JTACs for request and coordination of immediate air 
support.  The ASOC controls the AFARN/JARN and will activate and operate as many nets as necessary 
depending on requirements, available equipment, and allocated frequencies.  The normal mode for the 
AFARN/JARN will be secure UHF SATCOM digital communication using TACP-CASS.  The ASOC 
must be capable of operating the AFARN/JARN (secure) on other radios or on other C2 systems (e.g. 
HF, IRC, IWS, Jabber or TACP-CASS) when the tactical situation requires. 
A4.2.  TACP Administration (Admin) Net.  This HF (VHF/AM backup) net is used to pass urgent 
administrative, logistics, and command information between the ASOC and TACP elements.  This can 
also be accomplished using an Internet Relay Chat function or using the TACP-CASS digital Chat (via 
TACSAT). 
A4.3.  Tactical Air Direction (TAD) Net.  This UHF net (VHF or FM backup) is used by the ASOC, 
TACPs or FAC(A)s for directing and/or controlling air support mission aircraft.  The TACP is the prime 
user of this net and is allocated specific frequencies to conduct tactical operations.  The ASOC is also 
authorized to enter this net to pass time-sensitive information.  The TAD net should be reserved for time 
critical terminal attack control information only.  The list of TAD frequencies is published in the SPINS.  
TAD frequencies may be secure or non-secure.  Do not discuss the TAD frequency on a non-secure net; 
use the TAD number. 
A4.4.  In-Flight Report Net.  This UHF net is used for the airborne transmission of in-flight reports to 
the elements of the TACS.  Aircraft normally pass ASOC personnel an in-flight report when departing 
the ASOC AO.  In the case of degraded communications, the CRC, AWACS, or JSTARS can relay this 
information to the ASOC. 
A4.5.  Tactical Air Control Net.  The purpose of this net is to coordinate mission direction of airborne 
aircraft under control of the CRC.   The ASOC interfaces with the air control net through the command 
and control net. 
A4.6.  Command and Control Net.  This net may also be referred to as the air operations net or the air 
defense command and control net.  The air operations net interfaces with other ground and airborne 
TACS units primarily through UHF SATCOM systems that are always secure.  This net is used for 
command traffic (normally from the AOC to the CRC, AWACS and JSTARS, including operations and 
air defense warnings.

AIR SUPPORT OPERATIONS CENTER EQUIPMENT 
A5.1.  General.  An ASOC uses many different types of radios and equipment to aid in communications 
and navigation. 
A5.2.  Radio Equipment.  An ASOC has a combination of vehicle and man-portable radio systems to 
use. 
A5.2.1.  AN/MRC-144/AN/GRC-206 Communications System.  The AN/GRC-206 communications 
pallet can be mounted in an M-series high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV).  The 
consolidated system is referred to as an AN/MRC-144.  The AN/GRC-206 communications pallet 
can also be mounted in an M-113 armored personnel carrier or an M-2 Bradley infantry fighting 
vehicle.  The GRC-206 version 5 consists of two VHF/FM Single Channel Ground to Air Radio 
System (SINCGARS), a UHF/AM HAVE QUICK II, a VHF/AM, and an HF/SSB automatic link 
establishment (ALE); it may be remotely located up to 3 kilometers with no degradation.  The GRC-
206 version 6 cannot access HF/SSB ALE nets.  Version 5 is principally designed to be placed at 
each TOC where remote operations are required.  The specific radios used include the AN/VRC-83, 
AN/URC-113 and AN/VRC-91. 
A5.2.1.1.  AN/VRC-83 (VHF-UHF).  Two VRC-83s are mounted in the radio set.  When 
configured for UHF operations, it is HAVE QUICK/HAVE QUICK II-capable.  Secure voice is 
provided on both radios with the KY-57 or the KY-99A.  The system is line-of-sight (LOS) 
limited. 
A5.2.1.2.  AN/URC-113 (HF).  The URC-113 is a pallet-mounted HF/SSB radio.  When 
operated over short distances (30 to 300 miles), it is best used with a near vertical incidence 
skywave (NVIS) antenna.  Secure voice is provided by the KY-99A.  Signal reliability is limited 
by environmental and atmospheric conditions. 
A5.2.1.3.  AN/VRC-91 (VHF/FM).  There are two VRC-91 SINCGARS radio sets mounted in 
the pallet.  The system is LOS limited. 
A5.2.2.  Man-portable/Manpack radios. 
A5.2.2.1.  AN/PRC-150 (HF).  The AN/PRC-150(C) is an advanced HF-SSB/VHF-FM manpack 
radio that provides reliable tactical communications through enhanced secure voice and data 
performance, networking, and extended battery life.  In addition to the HF capability, the 
transceiver’s extended frequency range (to 60 MHz) provides secure voice and data in the VHF 
band. 
A5.2.2.2.  AN/PRC-113 (UHF-VHF/AM).  The PRC-113 portable transceiver is HAVE 
QUICK/HAVE QUICK II-capable.  The RT-1319B can be pallet mounted without any loss of 
operational capability.  It is secure capable with the KY-57 or KY-99A.  This system is limited 
to LOS only. 
A5.2.2.3.  AN/PRC-117F Tactical Radio.  The PRC-117F is a man-portable, tactical radio that 
weighs 15.9 pounds with batteries.  It operates in the 30 to 512 MHz frequency range with 
embedded crypto in which COMSEC can be loaded.  The radio is software programmable and is 
capable of multi-band communications in VHF-FM, VHF-AM, UHF-AM, and UHF-SATCOM.  
It is PSN-11/PSN-13 compatible for TOD transfer and coordinate display via the keypad display 
unit (KDU).  The KDU is remote capable from the radio set up to 250 feet.  It is SINCGARS SIP 
34 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
 
and HAVE QUICK/HAVE QUICK II-capable.  Power output is maximum 20 watts FM and 10 
watts AM.  The UHF-SATCOM mode power output is 20 watts. 
A5.2.2.4.  AN/PRC148 Multi-Band Inter/Intra-Team Radio (MBITR).  The MBITR is a hand-
held ruggedized radio that weighs less than 2 pounds with battery.  It is capable of 30 to 512 
MHz continuous frequency coverage in the AM/FM spectrum with voice or data.  It is 
SINCGARS SIP and HAVE QUICK II-capable.  Power output is 5 watts continuous.  With the 
low power output, satellite communications requires precise antenna orientation.  A power 
amplifier is available and recommended for uninterrupted satellite communications. 
A5.3.  Navigation Equipment. 
A5.3.1.  Global Positioning System (GPS).  The NAVSTAR GPS provides continuous, real-time, 
all-weather, global, 3-dimensional navigation information.  A GPS receiver needs to have line of 
sight to at least four GPS satellites to accurately calculate position, velocity and time.  GPS provides 
two levels of navigation accuracy:  the standard positioning service (SPS) (an unencrypted signal 
available to all users) and the precise positioning service (PPS) (an encrypted signal for US military 
users). 
A5.3.1.1.    Datums.  Geodetic datums define the size and shape of the Earth, as well as the origin 
and orientation of the coordinate system used to reference and map the Earth.  Using the wrong 
geodetic datum can induce GPS position errors as great as or greater than all of the other types of 
GPS errors combined, as much as hundreds of meters.  The standard for GPS receivers is the World 
Geodetic System-1984 (WGS-84) datum plane.  For operations in the field, the user’s map/chart may 
be a datum plane different than WGS-84.  It is imperative to recognize any datum mismatch 
scenarios and resolve the issue. 
A5.3.1.2.  GPS Vulnerabilities.  Adversaries may attempt to jam or spoof the GPS navigational 
signal.  Additionally, friendly jamming operations may interfere with GPS receiver operations. 
A5.3.1.2.1.  Jamming.  Typically, jamming will prevent a receiver from locking onto the 
GPS signal during its initialization or signal acquisition phase.  If the jamming is strong 
enough, it can cause the receiver to break-lock and cause the navigation solution to fail.  
Report unexplained GPS anomalies to the G-2/S-2 and AOC. 
A5.3.1.2.2.  Spoofing.  Spoofing is when the adversary provides deceptive GPS signals, 
thereby misguiding the GPS receiver with false location data.  SPS receivers are very 
susceptible to spoofing because they rely on the unencrypted signals; PPS receivers using the 
encrypted signal are not.  When operations permit, use the encrypted PPS signal. 
A5.3.2.  PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR).  The DAGR is the replacement GPS 
receiver for the PSN-11 Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR).  The GPS program office 
began replacing PLGRs with the DAGR in FY05 and plans to replace all fielded PLGRs by FY13.  
The Rockwell Collins DAGR is advertised to incorporate five times the capabilities and functions of 
the PLGR while reducing the overall size, weight and power requirements of the receiver.  The 
receiver includes a graphical user interface which greatly enhances the user's effectiveness and 
safety.  The DAGR also incorporates anti-jam/anti-spoofing improvements for enhanced protection 
and is the first U.S. program to include the next generation security device, the Selective Availability 
Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM), for handheld GPS receivers. 
A5.4.  Tactical Air Control Party – Close Air Support System (TACP-CASS). 
AFI13-114V3  1 JUNE 2009 
35 
 
A5.4.1.  The TACP Close Air Support System (TACP-CASS) mission software package is the key 
integrating component of TACP/ASOC digital communications networks.  At its core, TACP-CASS 
is a data base that processes and stores messages, target data, friendly tracks, ATO/ACO 
information, and Falcon View based maps and imagery.  A graphic user interface allows operators to 
view maps, view imagery, compose messages, create new tracks, and other functions. 
A5.4.2.  Although the same TACP-CASS program is loaded on computers fielded at all echelons 
from the ASOC down to the front-line JTACs, software configurations and permissions are changed 
to provide those functions required at each echelon of the TACP/ASOC C2 architecture.  At the 
ASOC level, TACP-CASS receives air support requests over the JARN via UHF SATCOM or HF 
radio transmissions.  TACP-CASS then automatically passes these requests through TBMCS to the 
web-based air request processor (WARP) application that allows ASOC operators to pair CAS 
missions with the air support request. 
A5.4.3.  TACP-CASS is also a key component of the ASOC Gateway.  TACP-CASS receives 
Target track information via UHF SATCOM from forward TACPs/JTACs, processes the 
information, and passes JTIDS formatted messages to the Gateway’s JRE software for transmission 
on Link 16 and SADL networks.  Then, when Link 16 and SADL aircraft tracks are received by the 
Gateway, JRE forwards this information back to TACP-CASS for display in the ASOC and 
forwarding via SATCOM to forward TACPs and JTACs. 
A5.4.4.  Finally, TACP-CASS provides LOS UHF/VMF digital communications with strike aircraft 
equipped with improved data modems using AFAPD message protocols (F-16C Block 40/50 aircraft 
and some attack helicopters), MTS protocols (AV-8B), and VMF protocols (F/A-18 now and A-10C, 
B-52, and F-35 in the future). 
A5.5.  Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER).  The full motion video (FMV) 
downlink provides the ground user the ability to gain real-time intelligence/targeting video for use.  
FMV is passed to ground control stations and manpacks such as the ROVER III.  The ROVER III 
receiver system is comprised of an omnidirectional antenna, receiver/decoder/control unit, and laptop 
utilized to receive the transmitter data and provide real-time video feed to the user.  Although only a few 
downlink-capable targeting pods are currently fielded, all Litening AT and Sniper XR pods will be 
upgraded for downlink capability in the future.  Platforms capable of transmitting FMV include 
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)/remotely piloted vehicles (RPV), SCATHEVIEW C-130, P-3, AC-
130, and aircraft equipped with downlink-capable targeting pods, but future Litening AT and Sniper XR 
pods will be downlink capable.
