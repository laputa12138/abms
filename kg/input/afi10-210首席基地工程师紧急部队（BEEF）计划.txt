System component of MEFPAK contains the UTC logistics details for equipment and supplies 
listing (ESL). AFCEC/CXX will use the ESL as the source document for the Logistics Force 
Packaging System database when building the logistics details. (T-1) Further guidance is found 
in DAFI 10-401. 
2.2.7.  Prime BEEF personnel must maintain security clearances in accordance with tasking 
reporting instructions and Permanent Change of Station requirements per DoD Manual 
5200.02_AFMAN 16-1405, Air Force Personnel Security Program. (T-1) 
2.3.  Project Approval.  A unit’s Prime BEEF construction, maintenance, and repair activities 
will follow project programming requirements and approval levels. (T-2) Work accomplished by 
Prime BEEF forces must be executed and tracked according to the standardized work prioritization 
system outlined in AFI 32-1001, Civil Engineer Operations. (T-2) Regular Air Force and Air 
Reserve Component forces shall follow Joint Publication 3-34, Joint Engineer Operations, for 
project approval procedures while deployed on a joint or combined contingency operation. (T-0) 
Civil engineer commanders should coordinate with higher headquarters (e.g., Commander, Air 
Force Forces, or component command staffs) for area of responsibility project approval 
procedures. 
2.4.  Observations, Innovations, and Lessons.  All squadron commanders deployed to a 
contingency location will submit a unit-level after action report on either non-secure internet 
protocol router or secure internet protocol router as soon as practical to permit timely action. (T-3) 
Submit After Action Reports through the Joint Lessons Learned Information System or by 
submitting an AF Form 4329, AF Observation, Issue or Lessons Learned (for use on the 
NIPRNET) or AF Form 4330, After Action Summary Report (for use on the NIPRNET). (T-3) 
These reports are accomplished after deployment, exercise, or other major event. See AFI 10-1302,

AFI10-210  25 OCTOBER 2023 
Chapter 4 
TRAINING 
4.1.  Philosophy.  Prime BEEF forces train to meet a full range of tasks expected in a contingency 
environment. These tasks are contained in each Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) 
and in this instruction. This instruction and the Wartime Task Standard, located on the AFCEC 
Expeditionary Engineering SharePoint® site at https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/13072/default.aspx, are 
the source documents for Prime BEEF training. All Prime BEEF training requirements are vetted 
and approved through the civil engineer governance structure. 
4.2.  Applicability.  Military personnel assigned to Regular Air Force (RegAF) and Air Reserve 
Component (ARC) civil engineer units will train to standards identified in paragraph 4.3. (T-2) 
Headquarters, major commands, primary subordinate units, direct reporting units, staff 
augmentation teams, and individual mobilization augmentee civil engineers, receive, at a 
minimum, the ancillary training listed in DAFI 36-2670, Total Force Development. Ancillary 
training is conducted as required prior to deploying. Civilian personnel assigned to deployable 
UTCs, and civilians identified to provide wartime home station support will meet training 
requirements as defined by parent MAJCOMs and DRUs. (T-2) 
4.3.  Requirements.  Military personnel assigned to civil engineer units will complete 
foundational training, skills and knowledge, and Silver Flag mission qualification per training 
tables in Attachment 2, Attachment 3, Attachment 4, and Attachment 6. (T-1) All training 
identified in these attachments are considered mission essential and are resource and capability 
reportable. See AFI 10-201 for more information. Schedule contingency training not conducted at 
home station through AFCEC/CXX. MAJCOMs and DRUs coordinate these training requirements 
during official data calls from AFCEC/CXX. 
4.3.1.  Foundational training. Provides the foundation to building ready engineers and is 
identified in Attachment 2, Prime BEEF Training Requirements. Foundational training 
includes knowledge-based and hands-on training. Units should make every effort to 
incorporate realism into their respective foundational training programs. Field gear (to include 
primary weapons or training weapons) should be used during hands-on training such as convoy 
operations, defensive fighting positions, etc. When available, incorporate chemical, biological, 
radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) individual equipment during training events. Consider 
wearing field gear and/or CBRN individual equipment during normal daily activities to 
acclimate Airmen to conducting tasks. Institutional forces will accomplish foundational 
training upon deployment notification. (T-2) 
4.3.1.1.  MAJCOMs and DRUs may direct additional command-required training to 
maintain optimum readiness. 
4.3.1.2.  Foundational training schedule. RegAF units will conduct monthly foundational 
training in accordance with the annual standardized schedule located on their respective 
SharePoint® sites (Fire and Emergency Services, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, and 
Emergency Management, and Prime BEEF). (T-3) Adhering to this standardized schedule 
ensures all mandatory training is accomplished as directed in Attachment 2 and prior to 
deployment cycle. 
AFI10-210  25 OCTOBER 2023 
17 
4.3.2.  Skills and knowledge training requirements. The training focuses on bare base beddown 
and sustainment operations using basic expeditionary airfield resource (BEAR) assets in a 
realistic environment. Engineers will perform individual contingency tasks per Attachment 4. 
(T-1) Where possible, combat skills are added to training events to ensure realism and help 
fortify warrior ethos. 
4.3.2.1.  Wartime or contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and 
unique mission-essential equipment not used in day-to-day civil engineer operations. Due 
to cost and complexity, mission-essential contingency equipment and trainer expertise are 
not commonly found at continental United States installations. However, inadequate 
training on these key equipment items can negatively impact mission capabilities required 
for contingency operations success. Allowance Standard 429LOOJ provides authorizations 
for training assets that Prime BEEF units can procure to support home station training, field 
training, and local base exercises. Field training sets consist of items such as tents, 
generators, various BEAR electrical equipment items, and environmental control units. 
Prime BEEF units should contact their MAJCOM functional area managers for further 
information on this allowance standard. 
4.3.2.2.  Mission essential equipment training (MEET). Airmen will train to proficiency 
levels prescribed in the approved curriculum in accordance with the Expeditionary 
Training Working Group-approved objectives. (T-1) Where local training capabilities do 
not exist, specialty training sites listed in Attachment 5 can be utilized. The skills and 
knowledge training table in Attachment 4 identifies the minimum number of trained 
personnel per UTC. Units should make every effort to train and certify additional personnel 
who could be tasked as alternates to fill a critical position. Airmen holding a 3-skill level 
may complete training, however, those 3-levels are not included in resource readiness 
reportable calculations. 
4.3.2.3.  Mission essential equipment training instructor certification requirements. To 
ensure mission essential equipment instructors are competent and proficient in delivering 
effective training, the following certification tasks must be completed, prior to instructing 
their first mission essential equipment course. 
4.3.2.3.1.  MEET instructor certification. Candidate instructors must be current in 
AFSC MEET course(s). (T-1) Must shadow a certified instructor for a minimum of two 
courses with one course completed at any of the following regional training site (RTS) 
locations: 119th, 145th, 163rd, or 201st. (T-1) See Table A5.1 for site information. 
AFCEC/CXX will provide funding for travel to these locations. (T-1) 
4.3.2.3.2.  Certified instructor will evaluate candidate instructors. (T-1) The evaluation 
will be recorded on an AETC Form 281, Instructor Evaluation Checklist. (T-1) 
4.3.2.3.2.1.  The evaluator provides recommendation to the candidates NCOIC, 
senior enlisted leader, and commander, along with recommendations for correction 
or reevaluation, if needed. (T-1) 
4.3.2.3.2.2.  New instructors will not individually instruct a MEET course until a 
MEET instructor has certified them. (T-1)

4.3.2.3.2.3.  Training locations will send AETC Form 281 to AFCEC CXXT and 
AFCEC Operations Directorate, Force Development Division (AFCEC/COF) after 
instructor certification, for records keeping. (T-1) 
4.3.2.3.3.  Reoccurring MEET instructor qualification. Every 36 months, MEET 
instructors will have a follow-up evaluation for each MEET course they instruct. (T-1) 
This evaluation will be performed by a certified instructor with the same AFSC. (T-1) 
The evaluation will be recorded on an AETC Form 281. (T-1) 
4.3.2.3.3.1.  Evaluator will provide recommendation to the training location 
NCOIC, senior enlisted leader, and commander of the instructor, along with, 
recommendations for correction or reevaluation, if needed. (T-1) 
4.3.2.3.3.2.  Training locations will send AETC Form 281 to AFCEC CXXT and 
AFCEC/COF after instructor re-certification for records keeping. (T-1) 
4.3.3.  Rapid damage repair (RDR) training. The RDR process is critical to the recovery of an 
airfield. Due to the limited number of installations that are equipped and able to train the RDR 
process, specialty training sites (Attachment 5) have been established to provide training 
opportunities to the total force. 
4.3.3.1.  The required AFSCs that will attend RDR training are 3E0XX-3E6XX. (T-2) At 
a minimum, units will ensure 25% of each identified AFSC with a 5 or 7 skill level attend 
RDR Training. (T-2) Training is valid for 24 months (RegAF) and 48 months (ARC). 
4.3.3.2.  Rapid damage assessment (RDA). For units postured with the 4F9DA, Damage 
Assessment UTC, a rapid airfield damage assessment system (RADAS) training event 
must be conducted every ninety (90) days with the entire RADAS team (addition of two 
Geospatial Expeditionary Planning Tool (GeoExPT) operators). (T-1) This event may be 
combined with other training events. The training event must be a minimum of thirty (30) 
minutes, have at least two (2) takeoff and landings, and exercise initial data collection and 
mission re-taskings. (T-2) Furthermore, units must exercise Airfield Damage Assesment 
Teams (ADATs) on operational airfield pavements every ninety (90) days. (T-2) Collected 
data must be processed thru GeoExPT. (T-2) Recommend this be conducted in conjuction 
with the RADAS exercise. 
4.3.4.  Silver Flag mission qualification. Engineers demonstrate performance of critical 
contingency tasks that support their assigned Air Force, force generation force element. The 
Silver Flag mission qualification validates a unit’s ability to complete bare base beddown, 
sustainment, and recovery operations using basic expeditionary airfield resource assets in a 
realistic environment. Units ensure force elements complete a Silver Flag mission 
qualification, as a UTC, in their “Prepare” or “Certify” phase. The Silver Flag mission 
qualification will be conducted at an AFCEC approved contingency training location. (T-1) 
4.3.5.  Government vehicle and heavy equipment operations training. All military Prime BEEF 
personnel who operate vehicles and heavy equipment will have a valid state motor vehicle 
license in accordance with AFI 24-301, Ground Transportation, and have a government 
driver’s license for vehicles. (T-1) For equipment not requiring licensing, documentation 
verifying they may operate the equipment will be identified in training records and tracked in 
ARIS. (T-1) Attachment 3 identifies vehicle and equipment requirements, per AFSC. 
AFI10-210  25 OCTOBER 2023 
19 
4.3.6.  Prime BEEF 96-Hour contingency training event. Each military member assigned to a 
Prime BEEF UTC will participate in a 96-hour Prime BEEF contingency training event per 
Attachment 2. (T-1) When completing this requirement, refer to the AFCEC optional 
contingency training template located on the AFCEC Expedtionary Engineering SharePoint® 
at https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/13072/default.aspx. 
4.3.7.  Enhanced technical information management system. Certain AFSCs require the use of 
Technical Orders (T.O.s) in the accomplishment of their jobs. These AFSCs include Electrical 
Power Production (3E0X2), Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 
(3E1X1), Structural (3E3X1) and Engineering (3E5X1). Access to T.O.s require an account, 
accessible via the Air Force Portal. AFSCs (3E0X2, 3E1X1, 3E3X1 and 3E5X1) should 
maintain a shop level account with each member of the shop added to the account. Secondly, 
each AFSC should have a baseline number of T.O.s added to the account that captures 
equipment experienced in a contingency environment. Accounts access ensure these AFSCs 
have current information necessary to maintain contingency equipment and enable worldwide 
missions. 
The 
CE 
Dash 
(https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/CEDASH/scripts/homepage/home.aspx) provides the list of 
minimum T.O.s maintained and updated by appropriate Force Development Manager. 
4.4.  Documentation.  The Prime BEEF Manager will document training administered through 
the Prime BEEF program following guidelines established in the Records Disposition Schedule 
and will document training utilizing ARIS. (T-2) Use course sessions and sign-in rosters to show 
completed training requirements. (T-2) Upload signed rosters for each course session into ARIS 
as the source documents for training attendance validation. (T-2) Commander endorsed 
memorandums can be used in lieu of a signed course roster. Civil engineer commanders may give 
credit for applicable foundational training to individuals who performed and documented tasks. 
For deployment related training use the return date from the contingency or exercise deployment 
as the training completion date. 
4.5.  Task Qualification Training (TQT).  Referenced in AFI 10-2501, Emergency Management 
Program, Career Field Managers identify wartime tasks to be performed and task-certified while 
wearing CBRN individual protective equipment. Wartime training tasks are considered TQT and 
are identified in civil engineer Air Force specialty codes, career field education and training plans. 
Unit Commanders follow guidance of AFI 10-201 to document the status of TQT using the 
chemical, biological, defense readiness training report. (T-0) TQT should be completed in Mission 
Oriented Protective Posture Level 4, unless otherwise stated in each civil engineer AFSC career 
field education and training plans (CFETP) or identified by Career Field Managers. 
4.6.  General Contingency Responsibilities. 
4.6.1.  Upon assignment to the unit, civil engineer commanders ensure all military personnel 
receive Prime BEEF orientation training as identified in Table A2.1. This training should 
emphasize an individual’s role and how they fit into the program. It includes an overview of 
civil engineer doctrine and explains the organization, training, equipment, operating concepts, 
and contingency missions pertaining to the unit. The Prime BEEF Manager will update unit 
personnel on significant changes to the programs as they occur. (T-2)

service flights, and units not assigned at least one 4FPET UTC are exempt from the 
contingency project requirement except: Kadena AB, Ramstein AB, Joint Base Elmendorf-
Richardson and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. 
4.7.  Expedient Methods. 
4.7.1.  Expedient methods provide civil engineer craftsmen with ideas, options, and procedures 
for accomplishing expedient repairs to damaged structures and utility systems when standard 
equipment and materials are not available or when necessary for minimum-essential restoration 
of base facilities and services. Civil engineer commanders should incorporate lessons learned, 
playbooks and tactics, techniques, and procedures into foundational training to develop ready 
Airmen engineers. 
4.7.2.  Force beddown. For civil engineers to expediently beddown forces, training on basic 
BEAR package configurations, and playbook options are essential. These lessons cover items 
such as base layout, utility systems, facility hardening, and environmental management. 
4.7.3.  Environmental Management. Civil engineer units play a lead role in environmental 
management at home station and deployed locations. Civil engineer commanders ensure there 
is sufficient environmental management expertise on deployable UTCs. Personnel will comply

Chapter 5 
EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES 
5.1.  Mobility Equipment and Supplies.  Civil engineer commanders will equip their Prime 
BEEF unit type codes (UTCs) per the respective equipment and supplies listing (ESL). (T-2) 
5.1.1.  Requirements, documents, and databases. The civil engineer community uses three 
documents/databases to manage UTC equipment and supplies: the ESL, allowance standards, 
and the Logistics Force Packaging System. These documents and databases define equipment 
and supply requirements, authorization for accountable equipment items, and information for 
building the logistics details. 
5.1.1.1.  The ESL source document, generated from Automated Readiness Information 
Systems (ARIS), is the authoritative source document for all civil engineer UTC equipment 
requirements. ARIS is also the only source for details on how to report equipment items in 
the Air Force Input Tool for Resource Readiness. This document enables the civil engineer 
community to standardize requirements between UTCs and is the primary document used 
to conduct annual inventories and forecast funding for those UTCs. Most continental 
United States UTCs are stored centrally at Grissom Air Reserve Base, IN. EOD UTCs are 
stored at each installation that are tasked with a specific deployment mission. Outside the 
continental United States units store and manage their UTCs locally. Units outside the 
continental United States and units with non-centralized UTCs will conduct inventories 
and inspections annually or after deployments/exercises, whichever is soonest, comparing 
the on-hand assets to the ESL and updating the results in ARIS. (T-2) When shortages in 
wartime equipment are noted, units should take immediate action and budget to acquire 
missing items or conduct commercial market analysis to determine suitable substitutes. 
AFCEC/CXX reviews the ESL every three years and submits for approval through the civil 
engineer governance structure. (T-2) Once approved, AFCEC/CXX updates ARIS to 
reflect changes. 
5.1.1.2.  Allowance standards provide authorizations for units to acquire accountable 
equipment items listed in the ESL. 
5.1.1.3.  The Logistics Force Packaging System contains the pallet load and packing list 
information for each UTC. AFCEC/CXX will ensure the Logistics Force Packaging 
System details include all items as listed in the latest approved ESL. (T-1) 
5.1.2.  Personal clothing. All regular Air Force civil engineers will maintain a personal bag 
with items listed in Table 5.1. (T-3) All civilian members assigned to a deployable UTC should 
be encouraged to maintain an equivalent personal bag. Until activation, Air Reserve 
Component personnel require only those uniform items prescribed in AFI 36-3012, Military 
Entitlements. 
5.1.2.1.  Commanders will forecast funding, initially issue, and replace the mandatory 
items in Table 5.1 as required. (T-3) 
5.1.2.2.  Each Airman’s personal bag contains both mandatory and personal items. 
Mandatory items are authorized, and unit funded or initial issue items. Personal items, 
except for initial issue are highly recommended and the responsibility of each Airman to 
procure.

5.1.3.  Mobility bags. Each person assigned to a standard deployable UTC is allocated one 
general purpose bag (A-bag), one extreme cold weather bag (B-bag), and one CBRN individual 
protective equipment bag (C-1) according to sustainment groups listed in AFI 23-101, Materiel 
Management Policy. The ESL lists mobility bag requirements. The A- and B-bag items are 
listed in AFI 23-101, and C-bag requirements are listed in AFI 10-2501, Emergency 
Management Program. Logistics Readiness Squadron will maintain the standard bags. (T-3) 
Exceptions: Each person assigned to an EOD UTC is issued and maintains their mobility bags 
except for the C-1 bag listed in the ESL. (T-1) Units provide the EOD individual equipment 
and unit retention items through the Battlefield Airmen Rapid Refresh & Replenishment 
System. (T-1) Mobility bags are only required for the maximum simultaneously deployable 
capability of the unit. 
5.1.4.  Special protective clothing. Units will maintain properly sized protective clothing for 
each Pest Management (3E4X3) and assigned Fire and Emergency Services (3E7X1) 
technician. (T-1) Units will also maintain arc flash gear, cotton Operational Camouflage 
Pattern and fire-resistant undergarments (if cotton uniforms are not available, 100 percent 
cotton coveralls suffice) for each Electrician (3E0X1), Power Production (3E0X2), Heating, 
Ventilation, Air Conditioning & Refrigeration (3E1X1) and Water and Fuel Systems 
Maintenance (3E4X1) technician assigned to a deployable Prime BEEF UTC. (T-1) 
Individuals holding these AFSCs who are assigned to UTC will deploy with properly sized 
special protective clothing and undergarments as listed in the ESL. (T-1) Firefighter operations 
and EOD personnel will wear fire-resistant/flame retardant variants of approved Air Force 
uniforms as the daily uniform due to the inherently dangerous and quick response nature of 
their duties. (T-3) EOD Flights will issue all assigned EOD personnel the required items in the 
Battlefield Airmen Rapid Refresh and Replenishment System to include cold and inclement 
weather protective clothing items. (T-3) 
5.1.5.  Team and tool kits. Prime BEEF UTCs will include the full complement of team and 
consolidated tool kits in accordance with the ESL. (T-1) Units can contact local Logistics 
Readiness Squadron to obtain a copy of the Allowance Standards 429, 456, 459, 490, 538, and 
660 which contain equipment authorizations for Prime BEEF UTCs. 
5.1.6.  Weapons and ammunition. The primary duty weapon for civil engineers is the M-4. 
Each position of a 4FP* UTC requires one M-4 rifle and 210 rounds of ammunition unless 
otherwise stated by mission requirements. (T-1) Each rifle requires seven 30-round magazines. 
(T-1) Headquarters staff, Civil Engineer Staff Augmentation Teams, Civil Engineer 
Maintenance, Inspection, and Repair Teams, and Airfield Pavements Evaluation Team UTCs 
may optionally equip using pistols only; however, this does not relieve these units of having 
the M-4s. All EOD funded military authorizations, postured in either standard or non-standard 
UTCs requires their primary duty weapon and pistol. (T-1) Emergency Management funded 
military authorizations, postured in either standard or non-standard UTCs require their primary 
duty weapon and pistol. (T-1) 
5.1.6.1.  Civil engineer commanders may authorize pistols and accompanying ammunition 
for cargo couriers, armory guards, or other such duties where the M-4 would hinder 
operations. 
 
 
26 
AFI10-210  25 OCTOBER 2023 
5.1.6.2.  Table 5.2  lists the maximum number of rifles and pistols authorized per UTC. 
For weapons and demolition munitions authorizations, refer to Allowance Standard 538 
and Ground Munitions Authorization Tables located on the Global Ammunition Control 
Point. 
5.1.6.3.  Per the Ground Munitions Authorization Table, unit Prime BEEF Managers will 
forecast annually for mobility ground ammunition (5.56 mm, 9 mm, 2¾ bird shot, and 2¾ 
buck shot) for all Prime BEEF requirements (excluding EOD). (T-1) Prime BEEF 
managers must contact the local Munitions Accountable Supply Officer for creating, 
forecasting, and maintaining mobility ground ammunition requirements. (T-1) 
5.1.6.4.  If weapons are stored and/or maintained on a civil engineer equipment account, 
Prime BEEF managers will be responsible for maintaining AF Technical Order Form 105, 
Inspection Maintenance Firing Data for Ground Weapons, and quarterly and annual 
inspections. (T-1) If weapons are centrally stored and maintained on a single account 
managed by the Logistics Readiness Squadron, then documenting AF Technical Order 
Form 105 with quarterly and annual inspections is conducted by the local Logistics 
Readiness Squadron as directed in AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms Program. (T-1)

7.2.4.  S-Team must meet training table requirements as listed in Attachment 6. (T-1) In 
addition to this training, S-Team personnel should be familiar with key plans, standards, and 
policies of their unit’s supported command. This includes Operations Plans, Base Support 
Plans, Time-Phased Force Deployment Data, and theater construction standards. S-Teams 
need proper clearance to review plans. Personnel should also receive Air Force Forces staff 
training provided by the supported command prior to contingency operations or major 
exercises at the staff level. Prior to supporting operations in other countries, members should 
familiarize themselves with GeoBase imagery and Host-Nation construction capabilities. 
7.3.  Civil Engineer Maintenance, Inspection, and Repair Teams (CEMIRT).  CEMIRT 
provides in-theater depot-level maintenance and repair of diesel driven power generators, electrical 
distribution, and control systems, and fixed or mobile aircraft arresting systems. CEMIRT also 
provide emergency troubleshooting, maintenance, and repair to bare base and real property 
installed electrical power generation and distribution equipment. DoD emergency-essential 
civilians provide increased capability to CEMIRT when assigned. 
7.4.  Airfield Pavement Evaluation (APE).  APE is the DoD’s sole entity providing full-
spectrum airfield pavement evaluations across the globe. Capabilities include surface condition 
inspection and determination of pavement section’s structural capacity using non-destructive 
heavy weight deflectometer and destructive testing with pavement coring, concrete flexural 
strength testing, automated dynamic cone penetrometer testing and soil analysis. They perform 
runway friction/slope analysis, and power check apron anchor proof load testing. APE also 
provides reach back support in areas of pavement and geotechnical engineering and construction. 
7.5.  Base Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR).  The 635th Materiel Maintenance 
Squadron (MMS) is the pilot unit for BEAR UTCs, advises on acquisition of BEAR assets, and 
provides technical expertise on war reserve materiel (WRM) in support of Air Force forces 
requirements. The 635 MMS provides expertise associated with planning, set-up, and employment 
of BEAR assets in a contingency environment where little or no infrastructure exists. The 635 
MMS is the sole training location in the construction, inspection, maintenance, and repair of large 
area shelters to ensure life cycle management of these assets. As enablers, 635 MMS engineer 
teams deploy to support joint force commanders when needed and can employ rapid response 
teams for camp beddown and recovery efforts after natural disasters where WRM assets may be 
needed.

Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)—The Air Force procedures promulgated at 32 
CFR Part 989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process provide for environmental impact analysis 
both within the United States and abroad. The authority for, and rules governing, each aspect of 
the EIAP differ depending on whether the action takes place in the United States or outside the 
United States, the EIAP separate procedures for each type of action. The focus of the EIAP 
regulation deals primarily with environmental impact analysis under the authority of the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 USC 4321-4347), while the primary procedures 
for environmental impact analysis of actions outside the United States are in accordance with EO 
12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions and contained in 32 CFR 989.37, 
Procedures for Analysis Abroad and 989.38, Requirements for Analysis Abroad and AFI 32-7091, 
Environmental Management Outside the United States, Chap 5. The EIAP procedures are essential 
to achieve and maintain compliance with NEPA and the President’s Council on Environmental 
Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-
1508) (“Council on Environmental Quality Regulations”). To comply with NEPA and complete

training and is preassigned to an Active Component organization, a Selective Service System, or 
a Federal Emergency Management Agency billet that must be filled on, or shortly after 
mobilization. Individual mobilization augmentees train on a part-time basis with these 
organizations to prepare for mobilization. Inactive duty training for individual mobilization 
augmentees is decided by component policy and can vary from 0 to 48 drills a year. 
42 
AFI10-210  25 OCTOBER 2023 
Lead Service—The Service that ensures the planning, design, coordination of requirements, 
construction, operation of the location, and provision of base operations support to the mission and 
tenants at a contingency location (DoDD 3000.10). 
Logistics Force Packaging Systems—A Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging subsystem 
that provides equipment and materiel requirements and summarized transportation characteristics 
through its logistics detail component. 
Manpower Force Packaging System—Subsystem of Manpower and Equipment Force 
Packaging. For each UTC it provides: (1) the title of the unit or force element and its unique UTC; 
(2) the MISCAP statement; and (3) the manpower detail by function, grade (officers only), and 
Air Force specialty code required to meet the defined capability. 
Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK)—A data system designed to 
support contingency and general war planning with pre-defined and standardized manpower and 
equipment force packages. Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging operates in the command-
and-control environment and is composed of two subsystems: the Manpower and Equipment Force 
Packaging System and the Logistics Forces. 
Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP)—A short paragraph describing the mission

a contingency. (DoDI 4715.19) 
Operation Plans—A plan for one or more operations that deployed units conduct simultaneously 
or in a series of connected stages. Higher authorities normally issue operation plans as directives 
based on stated assumptions to allow subordinate officers to prepare supporting plans and orders. 
Rapid Airfield Damage Assessment System (RADAS)—A remotely operated system for rapid 
damage assessment of airfield damage and UXO after an attack and supplies data necessary to 
select minimum airfield operating surface (MOAS). 
Rapid Airfield Damage Recovery (RADR)—Encompasses all actions required to rapidly repair 
runways and runway support structures to recover operations on an airfield after an attack. RADR 
actions include rapid airfield damage assessment, rapid mitigation of explosive hazards, and rapid 
repair of damaged surfaces and critical infrastructure. 
 
 
AFI10-210  25 OCTOBER 2023 
43 
Rapid Damage Assessment (RDA)—First phase of RADR. Focuses on collecting and analyzing 
data to determine the presence of hazards and overall airfield condition to include the number, 
location and type of craters, UXO, and other damage characteristics such as camouflets and spalls. 
Assessment is accomplished using a combination of manual and automated data collection 
systems. Automated systems such as RADAS reduce the UXO threat to Airmen and the assessment 
timeline. Data collected during this phase is used to select the most appropriate MAOS to repair. 
Rapid Damage Repair (RDR)—Third phase of RADR. Once the explosive hazard threat is 
sufficiently mitigated in a repair zone, RDR teams begin repairing craters, camouflets, spalls, and 
other damage impeding flying operations on the MAOS. In some scenarios, hundreds of craters 
could require repair within acceptable time frames to meet the commander’s Air Tasking Order 
(ATO). This requires multiple teams, each using an assembly line process to achieve repair 
objectives. Where logistics supply/resupply cannot support the repair in a timely manner, repair 
capabilities are prepositioned. 
Rapid Explosive Hazard Mitigation (REHM)—Phase two of RADR. Due to high probability 
that significant numbers of UXO will be present on access routes, in equipment and material 
staging areas, and on the selected minimum airfield operating surface. A family of UXO 
assessment and mitigation tools, platforms, and systems provides EOD technicians the capability 
to safely and rapidly mitigate the UXO threat. These platforms and systems, operated (or 
supervised) by EOD personnel, allow surface and subsurface UXO positive identification, 
neutralization, collection, removal, and ultimate disposal on and off the airfield operating surfaces, 
access routes, and equipment and material staging areas. 
Regular Air Force (RegAF)—The Regular Air Force is comprised of active-duty forces. 
Unit Deployment Manager (UDM)—The unit deployment manager is a member assigned to a 
unit that manages all deployment readiness and training aspects for all deployable personnel and 
equipment within their unit to ensure they are deployment ready. In addition, unit deployment 
manager’s support redeployed personnel in the Redeployment Support Process with 
commanders/civilian leaders of their units. 
Unit Type Code (UTC)—A Joint Chiefs of Staff developed and assigned code, consisting of five 
characters that uniquely identify a “type unit.”

PRIME BEEF SPECIAL TRAINING SITES AND LOCATIONS 
A5.1.  Silver Flag Sites.  Silver Flag mission qualification is conducted at Tyndall Air Force Base 
FL; Ramstein Air Base, GE; and Andersen Air Base, GU. These sites focus on training students to 
perform critical contingency tasks as a team. The training focuses on bare base beddown and 
sustainment operations using basic expeditionary airfield resource assets in a realistic 
environment. Where possible, combat skills are added to the curriculum to ensure realism and help 
fortify a warrior ethos throughout the training. 
A5.2.  Expeditionary Combat Support-Training and Certification Center (ECS-TCC).  The 
ECS-TCC is located at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, GA. The Center provides certified instructors 
to administer and facilitate Skills and Knowledge training, Mission Essential Equipment Training 
(MEET), expeditionary, contingency, and upgrade training on behalf of Headquarters AFRC/A4O 
and AFCEC/CX. The site also provides other individual-focused specialized training to include 
core task certification, special purpose vehicle credentialing and licensing in accordance with
