1.  Overview.  This policy directive establishes Air Force policy for the management of 
information assets (all forms of data and content), across all AF information sources, as both a 
strategic resource and corporate asset supporting the warfighter during mission and support 
operations. 
1.1.  Enable “information aggregation” to promote the development, implementation, 
management, and control needed to make “information decisions” visible to any interested

these decisions are made for the benefit of the entire AF enterprise, Joint, Coalition, or inter-
agency partners. 
1.2.  Provide policy to achieve and maintain decision superiority to include, but not limited 
to, information access programs such as Records Management and the Privacy Act Program. 
2.  Policy.  It is AF policy to:
