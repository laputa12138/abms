Chapter 1 
OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Definition.  The development of NMPs is a total force career development effort to provide 
deliberate career management and professional development to all Airmen and Guardians who 
have equity in the DAF nuclear mission.  While understanding the importance of the Service’s 
nuclear mission is the responsibility of all Airmen and Guardians, NMPs are Airmen and 
Guardians who, through the course of a career, perform duties in the nuclear mission and 
specifically contribute to the delivery of nuclear capability to combatant commanders.  
Additionally, the DAF recognizes that a broad, deep pool of fully qualified, knowledgeable NMPs 
should be developed as Nuclear Thought Leaders to preserve a credible nuclear deterrent that 
protects the homeland, assures allies and partners, and deters adversaries. 
1.2.  Authorities.  The following paragraphs describe the authorities given to AF/A10 to execute 
nuclear cross-functional authorities for the development and management of NMPs. 
1.2.1.  Per Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Mission Directive (MD) 1-60, Deputy Chief of Staff 
of the Air Force Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration, AF/A10 provides direction, 
guidance, integration, and advocacy regarding the nuclear deterrence mission and serves as the 
HAF accountable officer responsible to the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) and the Chief 
of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) for the Air Force nuclear mission. 
1.2.2.  As the Air Force Nuclear Enterprise (NE) Functional Authority (FA) appointed by the 
SecAF per Headquarters Air Force Mission Directive (HAFMD) 1-60, AF/A10 provides 
direction, advocacy, and integration for the health of nuclear-related career fields.  It does so 
through the accession, retention, resourcing support, deliberate development, and management 
of NMPs as described in AFI 13-500, Air Force Nuclear Mission Responsibilities. 
1.2.3.  AF/A10 provides strategic-level guidance to the functional communities that contribute 
to cross-functional capabilities, provides Career Field Managers (CFM) with requirement 
validation guidance and procedures, forecasts force development requirements, and advocates 
nuclear cross-functional issues to functional communities. 
1.2.4.  AF/A10 will coordinate, as appropriate, with the Deputy Chief of Space Operations for 
Operations (SF/COO) to ensure collaborative force management and development actions for 
Guardians. 
1.3.  Purpose.  The purpose of nuclear professional development is to deliberately develop 
Airmen and Guardians by means of a network of interrelated education, training, and experiential 
(e.g., learning) efforts underpinned by nuclear occupational competencies (reference Attachment 
2). These efforts provide the right learning opportunities to NMPs at the right time. Deliberately 
developing nuclear Airmen and Guardians ensures they serve effectively as integral members of 
the Joint warfighting community. Its structure cultivates knowledgeable and experienced Airmen 
and Guardians skilled in employing nuclear mission capabilities and equips them with the requisite 
skills to develop and implement nuclear mission doctrine, strategy, integration, and policy. Nuclear  
 
 
6 
DAFI13-504  23 NOVEMBER 2021 
professional development will encompass both foundational and nuclear occupational 
competencies. This requires a combination of HAF and Headquarters Space Force (HQSF) support 
(direction, guidance, integration, and advocacy regarding the nuclear deterrence mission), major 
command (MAJCOM) and Field Command (FIELDCOM) support, and a NMP population that 
satisfies validated position requirements. Accurate identification and tracking of individual skills 
and position requirements is vital to these efforts. 
1.4.  Nuclear Mission Professionals.  NMPs are DAF assigned military and civilian personnel 
performing nuclear duties in support of the nuclear mission. NMPs are assigned to an organization 
that has nuclear mission equities as identified on the Nuclear Organization List (Chapter 4). NMPs 
are divided into core (primary), secondary, and associate career field disciplines as described in 
Chapter 5 of this publication. 
1.5.  Nuclear Occupational Competencies and USAF Foundational Competencies.  NMP 
development rests on the CSAF’s foundational (formerly institutional) competencies as described 
in DAFPD 36-26, Total Force Development and Management, Air Force Doctrine Publication 1, 
The Air Force, and Air Force Handbook (AFH) 36-2647, Competency Modeling. Attachment 2 
identifies nuclear occupational competencies that complement Service-wide foundational 
competencies. 
1.6.  Conformity to Department of Defense (DoD) and Congressional Requirements.  Per 10 
United States Code (USC) Section (§) 115b, Biennial Strategic Workforce Plan, DoD is required 
to identify workforce competencies, assess gaps, and implement workforce strategies to satisfy 
mission needs, thereby mitigating mission risk. In addition, Volume 250, Civilian Strategic Human 
Capital Planning (SHCP), of DoD Instruction 1400.25, Civilian Personnel Management, requires 
the establishment of a common taxonomy for enterprise-wide competencies. In combination, DoD 
development of models for civilian occupational series and assessment of civilian employee 
capabilities satisfy objectives prescribed by 10 USC § 115b. Consequently, functional 
communities are encouraged to take a proactive approach to civilian workforce planning, 
competency modeling, and risk mitigation, which AF/A10 extends to all Airmen and Guardians 
assigned to DAF nuclear missions through this publication. 
1.7.  Elements of NMP Development. 
1.7.1.  Deliberate development of NMPs addresses the need to develop nuclear cross-
functional acumen in conjunction with functional expertise throughout a career. Their learning 
is achieved through Professional Military Education (PME), technical instruction, nuclear-
specific Professional Continuing Education (PCE) (reference Attachment 3), and experience, 
now known as “learning.” 
1.7.2.  Cross-functional authority interaction with Functional Authorities is necessary to ensure 
nuclear mission requisites (e.g., long- and short-term manpower forecasts, human capital 
requirements, and learning requirements) are included in comprehensive Service-level 
requirements for each Air Force Specialty Code and occupational series. These inputs enable 
Development Teams (DT) to effectively grow NMPs based on specific learning and 
certification requirements. 
1.7.3.  Assignment Process. Experiential development of NMPs through the assignment 
process is vital to their successful talent management. Reference AFI 36-2110, Total Force 
Assignments.

Chapter 3 
NUCLEAR BILLET MANAGEMENT 
3.1.  Overview.  This section establishes guidance and procedures for the designation and 
management of nuclear billets.  There are four types of nuclear billets: 1) KNBs (military and 
civilian); 2) civilian billets vetted for the Nuclear Civilian Development Billet; 3) NC3 billets 
(military and civilian); and all other billets (military and civilian) that reside in units named on the 
Nuclear Organization List (Chapter 4).  All nuclear billets are coded in the MPES for stakeholder 
visibility and managed by the owning MAJCOM/A1M. AF/A10-approved billet lists can be found 
at 
the 
AF/A10D 
SharePoint® 
document 
library 
at 
https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/13449/SitePages/Home.aspx (site access available by request).  Site 
access requirements include an active Air Force Network account, site membership, and common 
access card authentication; users must login using a .mil domain. Mission partners without .mil 
domain should email AF.A10DF.WORKFLOW@us.af.mil. (T-1). 
3.2.  Process. 
3.2.1.  Nominations. AF/A10D in conjunction with AF/A1M will solicit nominations 
biennially. 
3.2.1.1.  All nominated positions must be funded. Billets that are projected to be funded 
within the same fiscal year may be nominated. 
3.2.1.2.  MAJCOMs and FIELDCOMs will consider Host Nation billets that are funded on 
Unit Manpower Documents (UMD). 
3.2.1.3.  Organizations requesting out-of-cycle nominations will contact AF/A10D through 
the appropriate chain of command for coordination and approval. Out-of-cycle 
nominations will only be accepted due to a significant mission change (e.g., activation or 
inactivation of a unit or when a mission transfers from one unit to another) or in instances 
where a newly funded billet is added to the UMD between nomination calls. 
3.2.1.4.  MAJCOMs, FIELDCOMs, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), HAF, Joint 
agencies, other DoD and non-DoD agencies rely on the expertise of NMPs (as defined in 
Attachment 1) to fill important positions and shall: 
3.2.1.4.1.  Designate a representative as the single point of contact (Colonel, GS-15 or 
equivalent) for inquiries and processing of billet nominations. 
3.2.1.4.2.  Process all nominations through their Deputy Commander, Director of Staff, 
HAF Director, or Agency Commander for approval. 
3.2.1.4.3.  Code the AF/A10-approved billets as delegated by AF/A1M guidance 
through their Manpower Office or equivalent function responsible for managing 
manpower requirements. 
3.2.1.5.  Director, Manpower, Organization and Resources, Chief, Requirements Division 
(AF/A1MR) is an essential partner for the nuclear billet management program and shall: 
 
 
DAFI13-504  23 NOVEMBER 2021 
25 
3.2.1.5.1.  Publish MPES XFA coding guidance, to include AF/A10D provided 
nomination template and timeline, to MAJCOM/A1Ms or equivalent manpower offices 
responsible for managing manpower requirements. 
3.2.1.5.2.  Provide AF/A10 current nuclear billet list from MPES. 
3.2.2.  Review. AFPC executes personnel policies and maintains a centralized database for 
human capital analytics.  AFPC will review each nomination and provide input on the impacts 
to the career field (military) or career field domain (civilian).  AF/A1MR will validate 
nominations to ensure nominated billets are funded and comply with guidance. 
3.2.3.  Validation. Nominations are coordinated through the appropriate CFM for validation. 
AF/A10DF provides each CFM their portion of the nominations.  CFMs review, annotate, and 
return the nominations to AF/A10DF for processing.  Any non-concur must be adjudicated by 
the CFM with the appropriate nominating representative.  CFMs should consider any 
definitions provided in this chapter and propriety of the nomination from a functional 
perspective.  CFMs should also consider what career field deliberate development efforts are 
in place to grow qualified Airmen and Guardians for these select nuclear assignments. (T-1). 
3.2.4.  Final Adjudication and Approval.  
3.2.4.1.  AF/A10 will adjudicate nominations and publish the approved list, which will 
remain effective until the next validation cycle results in a revised billet list. (T-1). 
3.2.4.2.  AFPC Nuclear Integration Office will distribute the final lists in spreadsheet form 
to all assignment teams to use for personnel assignments. (T-3). 
3.2.5.  Coding. Once AF/A10 approves a billet to be designated as a nuclear billet, AF/A1M 
will direct owning MAJCOM/A1M or equivalent manpower offices responsible for managing 
manpower requirements to code the billets in MPES per the AF/A1M guidance and Table 3.1 
(T-1). 
3.2.6.  Assessments. AF/A10D will assess the billet lists biennially during the nomination 
process. CFMs, AF/A1M, and AF/A10D will participate to ensure functional validation, 
confirm compliance, and ensure coding accuracy.  AF/A10D may conduct additional 
assessments of the KNB list outside of this normal timeline. (T-1). 
3.3.  Key Nuclear Billets. 
3.3.1.  Purpose. The KNB Program is a talent management program that governs key positions 
of leadership, nuclear expertise, and high-level responsibilities crucial to NDO, nuclear 
acquisition, and nuclear surety.  The program ensures that appropriately qualified nuclear 
personnel fill these positions.  It is the purpose of this program to delineate clearly where 
specialized nuclear talent is required across the USAF.  This enables Functional Authorities to 
better manage career paths and to provide vectoring, analysis, assessment, and policies that 
deliver nuclear expertise to commanders.  This program will provide a pool of cross-functional 
nuclear-steeped thought leaders within nuclear career fields. KNBs are rendered the highest 
assignment priority where resources are limited and executed through AF/A1 assignment 
policies.  Incumbents must be appropriately experienced Airmen and Guardians to prevent 
unacceptable risk to mission execution and nuclear surety. The availability of Airmen and 
Guardians to be assigned to a KNB is not a prerequisite for KNB designation. 
26 
DAFI13-504  23 NOVEMBER 2021 
3.3.2.  Nuclear Proficiencies. Each KNB is a position of responsibility within the nuclear 
mission and requires Airmen and Guardians who demonstrate an advanced or expert nuclear 
proficiency level in each applicable nuclear competency. 
3.3.3.  Advanced. At the advanced proficiency level, Airmen and Guardians leverage 
knowledge of nuclear strategies and issues to develop, present, and implement solutions.  
Airmen and Guardians consult with other subject matter experts and have a deep understanding 
how actions taken in one area of competence impact other related areas.  These Airmen and 
Guardians contribute to the development of new levels of nuclear capabilities by articulating 
the benefit of proposed solutions to leadership and staff within their organizational area.  In 
addition, they may lead or manage large, complex, multi-tiered organizations.  Billets are 
typically graded as master sergeant through chief master sergeant, GS-14, or lieutenant colonel 
through colonel (and equivalent). 
3.3.4.  Expert. At the expert proficiency level, Airmen and Guardians apply depth of nuclear 
knowledge, education, and expertise for broad strategic problem solving across DAF mission 
objectives. They synthesize information to develop solutions to complicated nuclear 
challenges.  They are recognized SMEs and nuclear thought leaders inside and outside their 
own organizations, and represent the DAF externally.  They promote critical thinking and 
diversity of thought within the nuclear mission, and direct rigorous nuclear-wide assessment 
and improvement.  They expertly articulate, arbitrate, and advocate for the nuclear mission.  
They may lead large, complex, multi-tiered organizations.  Billets are typically graded as GS-
15 and equivalent, colonel through General, or Senior Executive Service (and equivalent). 
3.3.4.1.  Airmen and Guardians are immediately mission effective in their responsibilities 
upon assignment. 
3.3.4.2.  CFMs must build into their career path pyramids the deliberate development 
necessary to qualify their Airmen and Guardians for a KNB assignment.  This is done to 
develop enough qualified Airmen and Guardians to fill vacated KNB positions through the 
normal assignment process.  The desired ratio of qualified Airmen and Guardians per KNB 
vacancy is four to one. 
3.3.5.  Designation. Military and civilian billets vetted through this process are designated in 
the MPES with a code of “NK” for KNB or “NP” if the billet is both a KNB and supports NC3. 
(Table 3.1). 
3.4.  Nuclear Civilian Development Billet List. 
3.4.1.  Overview. Civil service employees provide a continuity of expertise across the nuclear 
mission set. Although many may transfer between conventional and nuclear assignments to 
gain leadership experiences, civil service employees provide consistent and reliable experience 
to a rigorous mission.  It is the objective of the NE FA to ensure civilian employees are 
deliberately developed through nuclear education, training, and assignment experiences. The 
Nuclear Civilian Development Billet list identifies the billets core (primary) to strategic 
deterrence and NDO.  
3.4.2.  Scope. The nuclear mission set is broad in scope. For civil service employees, it expands 
across multiple occupational series and functions.  The NE FA determines human capital 
requirements for civilian Airmen and Guardians assigned to the nuclear domain. 
DAFI13-504  23 NOVEMBER 2021 
27 
3.4.3.  Purpose. Identifying core nuclear billets and incumbents presents the opportunity to 
support and strengthen the nuclear mission. 
3.4.3.1.  Nuclear stakeholders use this list to prioritize resources, build career paths, 
categorize nuclear work, and differentiate billets for particular actions. 
3.4.3.2.  Program managers are encouraged to prioritize personnel actions such as 
classification, hiring, and training quotas for core nuclear civilian billets and incumbents. 
3.4.3.3.  Partner CFMs are informed by the list to better manage and develop nuclear 
expertise for their nuclear professionals and integrate functional development initiatives 
such as Career Broadening, Key Career Position Program, KNBs, Civilian Developmental 
Education, and Developmental Team vectoring. 
3.4.3.4.  The Nuclear Civilian Development Billet List informs performance measurements 
used in assessing the human capital health of the nuclear mission. 
3.4.4.  Designation. A civilian billet is automatically considered a nuclear civilian billet when 
one of the following holds true: 
3.4.4.1.  The position is already designated a KNB. 
3.4.4.2.  The position is designated as Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) Codes A, D, I, 
N, Z in accordance with DoDM5210.42_AFMAN 13-501, Nuclear Weapons Personnel 
Reliability Program (PRP). 
3.4.4.3.  The position is the MAJCOM/FIELDCOM/DAF/A10 or S10 staff (Excluding 
administrative functions). 
3.4.4.4.  The position is a Special Weapons System Mechanic (Occupational Series 6656). 
3.4.4.5.  The position is a Nuclear Engineering (Occupational Series 0840). 
3.4.4.6.  The position is a civilian billet previously vetted under this process and MPES 
coded as “NB”, KNB (code NK), NC3 (code NB), or both (code NP) (Table 3.1). 
3.4.5.  Assessing the nomination.  When the billet is not already coded as listed above, the 
billet is assessed using this directive, AF/A10 guidance, and AF/A1M MPES XFA coding 
guidance. 
3.4.5.1.  Assessments will include a review from the MAJCOM or FIELDCOM lead 
civilian for that functional community (e.g., a developmental engineer GS-15 assigned to 
USAFE/A5 when considering a 0800 occupational series billet assigned to USAFE-
AFAFRICA) to inform the process. 
3.4.5.2.  Billets are assessed holistically with respect to the position’s nuclear 
responsibilities.  The billet location, nuclear program element code, organizational code, 
duty title, and other attributes, should be taken into consideration when designating the 
billet as core nuclear.

DAFI13-504  23 NOVEMBER 2021 
3.5.  NC3 Development Billet List.  Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of 
authority and direction by the Commander-in-Chief of the United States (US) Armed Forces, 
through established national command authority lines over nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons 
systems, and nuclear weapon operations of military forces.  The NC3 system is the means through 
which this NC2 authority is exercised and operational command and control of nuclear operations 
is conducted.  In order to provide robust NC3 capability to nuclear stakeholders, USAF NC3 billets 
are identified to ensure the necessary development and management of Airmen and Guardians. 
This section establishes the guidance and procedures to develop and manage the NC3 
Development Billet List. 
3.5.1.  NC3 Mission Essential Functions.  
3.5.1.1.  Force Management. Force Management is the set of Command, Control, and 
Communications (C3) activities relating to the assignment, training, deployment, 
maintenance, and logistic support of nuclear forces and weapons before, during and after 
any crisis. 
3.5.1.2.  Planning. Planning is the set of C3 activities relating to the development and 
modification of plans for employment of nuclear weapons and other operations in support 
of nuclear employment. 
3.5.1.3.  Situation Monitoring.  Situation Monitoring is the set of C3 activities relating to 
the collection, maintenance, assessment, and dissemination of information on friendly 
forces; adversary forces and possible targets; emerging nuclear powers; and military, 
political, environmental, and other events. 
3.5.1.4.  Decision Making.  Decision Making is the set of C3 activities relating to the 
assessment, review, and consultation regarding consideration for use or movement of 
nuclear weapons or the execution of the nuclear control orders. 
3.5.1.5.  Force Direction. Force Direction is the set of C3 activities relating to the 
implementation (preparation, dissemination, and authentication) of decisions regarding the 
execution, termination, destruction, and disablement of nuclear weapons. 
3.5.2.  The NC3 system includes interconnected elements composed of the following: 
3.5.2.1.  Warning Systems. Includes space-based and ground-based sensors and radars that 
provide warning data to command centers and senior leaders. 
3.5.2.2.  Communications Systems.  Includes terrestrial networks and satellite 
communication systems that transmit warning data, host leadership decision conferences, 
and disseminate orders. 
3.5.2.3.  Fixed, Mobile, and Airborne Command Centers. Plan nuclear options, manage 
crises, facilitate conferences, and execute emergency action procedures. 
3.5.2.4.  Warfighting System Control Centers and Command Posts.  Receive, process, 
relay, and/or execute nuclear orders to include Intercontinental Ballistic Missile launch 
control centers; bomber, refueling, and reconnaissance aircraft associated with the nuclear 
mission; and the Wing Command Posts that support those systems. 
3.5.3.  Designation. A billet is designated for NC3 coding when one of the following holds 
true: 
DAFI13-504  23 NOVEMBER 2021 
29 
3.5.3.1.  The position duties requires incumbents to perform one or more NC3 mission 
essential functions as part of the NC3 System defined above. 
3.5.3.2.  The personnel assigned to the billet will acquire, operate, sustain, maintain, or 
integrate portions of the NC3 Systems. 
3.5.3.3.  The position is core to the NC3 operations or maintenance of the facilities, 
equipment, and/or communication for elements of the NC3 System. 
3.5.3.4.  Military and civilian billets vetted through this process are designated in the 
MPES as code “NB” for NC3 or “NP” if both a KNB and NC3 billet. (Table 3.1). 
3.5.4.  Nuclear Proficiency. Airmen and Guardians deliver the preponderance of worldwide 
NC3 capability to combatant commanders. While their technical training is a functional 
responsibility and PCE courses are available through AETC, all NC3 Airmen and Guardians 
will also train to a proficiency level in the nuclear competencies (see paragraph 6.2).  NC3 
Airmen and Guardians will achieve a minimum proficiency level of intermediate in the specific 
NC3 competency and basic in all other nuclear competencies.  Some Airmen and Guardians 
may be required to achieve an advanced or expert level in the NC3 competency.

ORGANIZATIONS IN THE NUCLEAR MISSION (PASCODE LIST) 
4.1.  Overview.  Organizations provide an important boundary when defining the scope of the 
nuclear mission set.  When coupled with the nuclear career field list or the Nuclear Civilian 
Development Billet List, the organization list provides an accurate accounting of the Airmen and 
Guardians and mission sets that support NDO. The Nuclear Organization List is found at 
SharePoint® site: https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/13449/SitePages/Home.aspx.  Site access 
requirements include an active Air Force Network account, site membership, and common access 
card authentication; users must login using a .mil domain. Mission partners without .mil domain 
should e-mail AF.A10DF.WORKFLOW@us.af.mil.  (T-1). 
4.2.  Nuclear Mission Organization.  A nuclear mission organization is one whose mission 
responsibilities are to operate, maintain, warn or detect, secure, store, dispose, transport, load, 
inspect, manage, procure, research, develop, test, establish policy, perform NC3, service, train, or 
account for nuclear weapons, equipment, Airmen or Guardians. 
4.2.1.  Some units support the execution of NDO in the capacity of an enabler.  Much like the 
Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) construct, an enabler organization provides a unique capability. 
4.2.2.  In some cases, an Airman and Guardian’s duties support NDO but the entire 
organization does not. Therefore, the entire organization is not considered to be in the nuclear 
functional area.  Instead, only the billet(s) is (are) included on the list.  For example, United 
States Central Command is not deemed a core nuclear organization; however, their Command 
Center performs NC3, executes Emergency Action processes, and maintains Strike Facilitator 
responsibilities. Consequently, the Command Center billets are considered part of the nuclear 
mission. 
4.3.  Review and Revalidation.  AF/A10D will review and revalidate the Nuclear Organization 
List biennially. 
4.3.1.  CCMDs, MAJCOMs,FIELDCOMs, HAF, HQSF, Joint Staff and other agencies may 
nominate their organizations for consideration. 
4.3.2.  AF/A10 provides additions/deletions to AF/A1M to validate nominated billets are 
funded and comply with published guidance. 
4.3.3.  AF/A10 will adjudicate, approve, maintain, and distribute the final Nuclear 
Organization List. (T-1).

Chapter 5 
NUCLEAR ENTERPRISE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN CAREER FIELDS 
5.1.  Overview.  This chapter establishes an overview of all NE military career fields and civilian 
functional domains. The NE FA human capital responsibilities are inherently cross-functional, 
broader in scope, and not limited to one DAF career specialty or MAJCOM/FIELDCOM.  The NE 
FA facilitates human capital solutions not only for one or a family of related AF career specialties, 
but for all career fields across the enterprise. The NE FA purview includes Airmen and Guardians 
with duties in nuclear operations to include nuclear weapon storage facilities, test and evaluations, 
NC3, cyber surety, security, safety, transportation, maintenance, facility management and 
maintenance, explosive ordnance disposal, aircrew certified for support to nuclear operations, 
weapons loaders, warning and attack assessment, management of the PRP and the Personnel 
Reliability Assurance Program, or research, development and acquisition of nuclear systems. 
5.2.  Nuclear Enterprise Military Career Fields.  The NE is a cross-functional community of 
career specialties identified as primary (core), secondary, and associate nuclear career fields. This 
designation is determined not by access to the weapon (e.g., PRP Program), the propensity of 
nuclear duties relative to the whole of the career field responsibilities, or manning/operational 
tempo levels (e.g., AF/Al Stressed List), but by their relationship to successful NDO and NC3. 
The purpose of this stratification is to prioritize the development of nuclear competencies and to 
ensure Airmen and Guardians successfully contribute to the delivery of nuclear and NC3 
capabilities as they transition in and out of the NE. Revising each list of disciplines is at the 
discretion of the NE FA (AF/A10). 
Table 5.1.  Primary/Core Nuclear Career Fields (Military).

DAFI13-504  23 NOVEMBER 2021 
33 
5.3.  Civilian Career Fields.  The DAF civilian workforce of the NE provides continuity of 
expertise to nuclear mission sets. The civilian workforce provides steady and reliable experience 
with infrequent transfers between nuclear and non-nuclear assignments. Primary nuclear civilian 
employees are best identified as the incumbents in billets specifically nominated by 
MAJOM/FIELDCOM/DRU/FOA/applicable units and CFMs and subsequently approved for 
identification as core NE civilian positions by AF/A10. Core nuclear billets are defined as those 
where the incumbent is required to have nuclear education, training, certification, or nuclear 
experience for their position. This includes USAF positions that contribute to operations that 
support NC3. 
5.3.1.  Primary (Core) Nuclear Civilians are civil service employees who (a) serve in a civilian 
position that requires specialized nuclear-related training, knowledge, experience and/or 
education to perform their duties and/or support NDO or (b) serve in a billet coded for KNB, 
PRP, HAF/MAJCOM A10 staff, SF/S10N staff, Special Weapons System Mechanic 
(Occupational Series 6656), or Nuclear Engineering (Occupational Series 0840).  Primary 
nuclear billets and incumbents should be the highest priority in accessing and managing 
resources and processes. Civilians serving in a Primary (Core) Nuclear position will endeavor 
to achieve a minimum proficiency level of advanced in all six nuclear competencies; some 
positions will require the higher proficiency level of expert in the appropriate nuclear 
competency. 
5.3.2.  Secondary Nuclear Civilians support NDO as their primary mission area in a unit listed 
on the Nuclear Organization List.  While these civilians benefit from added nuclear-related 
education and training to instill a culture of nuclear excellence, in-depth nuclear 
education/training is not a mandate.  Secondary nuclear billets and incumbents should be the 
second highest priority in accessing and managing resources and processes.  Civilians serving 
in a secondary nuclear position will endeavor to achieve a minimum proficiency level of 
intermediate in all six nuclear competencies.  Some positions may require a higher proficiency 
level in the appropriate nuclear competency.  
5.3.3.  Associate Nuclear Civilians work in units that support other missions in addition to 
NDO and the unit is listed on the Nuclear List as an “enabler.” Similar to the AEF construct, 
an enabler organization provides a unique capability. Some examples of enabler organizations 
are AF/A1 and air refueling organizations. Accessing personnel and managing resources and 
processes to support enabler billets and incumbents should be prioritized as needed to 
accomplish the nuclear mission. Civilians serving in an Associate Nuclear position will 
endeavor to achieve a minimum proficiency level of basic in all six nuclear competencies. 
Some positions may require a higher proficiency level in the appropriate nuclear competency.

Chapter 6 
DEVELOPING AND MANAGING NUCLEAR MISSION PROFESSIONALS 
6.1.  Purpose.  When Airmen and Guardians serve in a special weapons mission, it is important 
they understand the importance of their contribution to the national strategy in addition to the 
technical proficiencies directed by their career field leadership. Nuclear competencies with 
proficiency levels support a nuclear Continuum of Learning. Coupled with other position 
requirements established by CFMs, proficiency in the appropriate nuclear competencies puts 
Airmen and Guardians in a position of knowledge to excel in a special weapons mission.  The 
purpose is to grow Airmen and Guardians who are able to advocate, influence, and lead in Joint, 
Interagency, intergovernmental and multinational environments. 
6.2.  Nuclear Competencies.  All Airmen and Guardians serving in the Nuclear Enterprise will 
learn nuclear competencies at some proficiency level, as directed by cross-functional policy and 
directives. Reference Attachment 2 for the following nuclear occupational competencies: 
6.2.1.  Nuclear Operations and U.S. Nuclear Forces.  Comprehend U.S. nuclear force structure, 
with an emphasis on DAF forces, to understand the strengths, challenges, and support 
requirements of each element of the force. 
6.2.2.  Unique Aspects of the Nuclear Mission. Understand the nuclear operating environment 
produces unique challenges for leadership, personnel, and systems. 
6.2.3.  U.S. Nuclear Support and Infrastructure.  Recognize acquisition, infrastructure, and 
support requirements for nuclear forces and weapons to sustain the nuclear mission. 
6.2.4.  Nuclear Surety.  Understand DAF nuclear weapons surety program to assure nuclear 
weapons system safety, security, and reliability, and to ensure nuclear weapons remain under 
positive control per Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 3150.02, DoD Nuclear 
Weapons Surety Program. (T-0) 
6.2.5.  Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications.  Understand NC3 requirements, 
functions, related authorities, and policies, and how NC3 systems support planning and 
execution of the nuclear mission. 
6.2.6.  Nuclear Policy and Strategy. Comprehend the complexities of the changing 
international security environment, to include treaties and agreements, and the role of nuclear 
weapons in U.S. security policy to deter aggression and coercion and to assure allies and 
partners. 
6.3.  Proficiency Levels.  From lowest to highest, the proficiency levels are Basic, Intermediate, 
Advanced and Expert, correlating to proficiency examples found in AFH 36-2647, Competency 
Modeling. Proficiency in each nuclear occupational competency is cumulative; for example, 
Airmen and Guardians occupying a billet that requires an Expert level of proficiency in NC3 
should demonstrate the behaviors of all four proficiency levels in NC3. Reference Attachment 2 
for the nuclear occupational competencies and the definitions of the four proficiency levels (Basic, 
Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert).

6.4.  Integrated Career Pyramids. 
6.4.1.  Military NMPs serve in many nuclear-related mission sets, functional domains, and 
career fields. Their technical skills require training and management directed by their 
functional domain. While assigned to the nuclear mission, their career paths may expand to 
include much broader and more in-depth nuclear education requirements. When the nuclear 
occupational competency tables (reference Attachment 2) overlay a career field pyramid, the 
resultant career path is an optimized roadmap for military and civilian NMPs. 
6.4.2.  The nuclear CoL in Figure 6.1 complements the career field pyramids of functional 
communities that contribute to the nuclear mission. Learning levels are position and grade 
appropriate to deliver a hierarchy of nuclear education designed to enhance the Airman and 
Guardian’s understanding of the nuclear mission and their functional effectiveness. 
6.5.  Nuclear PCE Requirements.  To best leverage limited resources, many nuclear education 
courses sustain prioritized attendance policies. Airmen and Guardians assigned to KNBs are 
prioritized for tiered nuclear development to support functional communities with essential nuclear 
responsibilities. Likewise, core career fields (Chapter 5) and Nuclear Civilian Billet List 
incumbents are prioritized. Specific nuclear education requirements to support the nuclear CoL are 
described in Attachment 3.

6.6.  Military NMP.  The officer and enlisted nuclear career diamonds (Figure 6.2 and Figure 
6.3) reflect an overarching nuclear path for military NMPs. 
6.6.1.  Some joint and other Agency courses serve as equivalent courses to USAF PCE courses.

Figure 6.3.  Career Diamond for Military Nuclear Mission Professionals (Enlisted). 
 
6.7.  DAF Civilian Nuclear Mission Professionals.  DAF Civilian nuclear professionals serve in 
most of the same nuclear mission-sets as do military nuclear professionals. Their skills require 
education, training, and management as directed by their functional domain. The development of 
the Civilian NMP may include greater learning requirements for nuclear occupational 
competencies (Attachment 2) and proficiencies as their career progresses. As nuclear 
requirements mesh with functional requirements, the nuclear career pyramid (Figure 6.4) serves 
as a roadmap for civilian NMPs. 
6.7.1.  To assist in the purposeful development of civilian NMP, the Nuclear Civilian 
Workforce Developmental Training and Education Handbook should be integrated into their 
professional development planning. The handbook is available for download from the 
AF/A10D 
SharePoint® 
document 
library 
at 
https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/13449/SitePages/Home.aspx. 
6.7.2.  Site access requirements include an active Air Force Network account, site membership, 
and common access card authentication; users must login using a .mil domain. Mission 
partners without .mil domain will email AF.A10DF.WORKFLOW@us.af.mil.

6.8.  Nuclear Thought Leaders.  Some Airmen and Guardians, military and civilian, will require 
more nuclear acumen as they lead in the technical expertise of NDO or the strategizing of Strategic 
Deterrence. These Nuclear Thought Leaders will require a nuclear-related career path integrated 
into their own functional career pyramid that qualifies them to serve in KNB and senior leader 
assignments. 
6.8.1.  The goal of nuclear thought leader development is to deliberately foster critical thinking 
and diversity of thought in leaders to advocate for nuclear deterrence policies, strategies, 
operations, 
conventional-nuclear 
integration 
and 
acquisition-related 
sustainment, 
modernization, and recapitalization plans. The expected benefit of these efforts is that the DAF 
will grow a cadre of highly desired and greatly respected nuclear thought leaders that build 
enduring partnerships, foster integration, and enhance leadership across the Joint Force and 
with allies and partners. 
6.8.2.  Nuclear Thought Leaders think jointly and holistically about deterrence.  They 
understand how global strike, strategic deterrence, space operations, conventional-nuclear 
operations, the post-detonation nuclear environment, and cyberspace operations integrate to 
create a more effective deterrent that underpins all DAF missions through a well-developed 
and sufficiently manned cadre of nuclear Airmen and Guardians. 
6.8.3.  Nuclear Thought Leaders are CMSgts, Colonels, GS-15s, and above who will develop 
to the Expert proficiency of the appropriate nuclear competency. Their attendance in nuclear 
PCE will be prioritized. Deliberate development requirements will be determined through 
cross-functional policy.

Chapter 7 
MEASURING THE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR MISSION 
PROFESSIONALS 
7.1.  Purpose.  Monitoring and assessing DAF nuclear capabilities, in human capital terms, 
validates that sufficient funding, resourcing, policy, and leadership investments are made to 
appropriately advance the development and management of nuclear professionals. 
7.2.  Monitoring and Measuring.  The monitoring and measuring of DAF nuclear capabilities 
answers the degree to which the DAF satisfies its nuclear operational requirements, sustains 
nuclear operational capacity, and addresses future operational requirements as determined by 
ongoing risk analysis. 
7.2.1.  The Human Capital area focuses on talent management and force development.  
Authoritative Data Sources, studies, reports, and other authoritative sources provide 
assessment data and analysis. 
7.2.2.  Human capital elements include, but are not limited to training, education, assignments, 
career advancement, retention, manning levels, quality of life, recognition, and compensation. 
7.3.  Impacts.  The impacts of human capital will be assessed in the nuclear strike missions of 
cruise missiles, gravity bombs, and intercontinental ballistic missiles and the nuclear support 
missions of NC3, surveillance, reconnaissance, acquisition, and mobility (air refueling and airlift).  
NC3 includes the AN/USQ-225 weapon system, Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack 
Assessment, and satellite and aerial layer communications. 
7.4.  Transparency.  While data provides the “what” of any scenario, only the analysis can 
provide the “why.”  Likewise, the specific functional community determines the appropriate plan 
for resolution.  AF/A10 will share results of data monitoring and metrics with mission partners to 
ensure a thorough perspective is delivered to senior leaders.

Attachment 2 
NUCLEAR OCCUPATIONAL COMPETENCIES 
A2.1.  Overview.  Nuclear occupational competencies (reference Table A2.1) establish what is 
important about a mission set for all Airmen and Guardians to understand. The Nuclear Enterprise 
Functional Authority (AF/A10), in coordination with community stakeholders, develops 
competencies for the Air Force nuclear mission to inform curriculum development and improve 
nuclear education in support of a career-long CoL. Nuclear competencies and proficiency levels 
are foundational to nuclear force development. Table A2.1 describes nuclear occupational 
competencies. For competency modeling, reference AFH 36-2647. 
A2.2.  Linkage.  Nuclear occupational competencies complement CSAF-approved Air Force 
foundational competencies. Nuclear occupational competencies reinforce an Airman’s capacity to 
develop themselves, others, ideas, and organizations which are the four, broad competency 
categories of USAF foundational competencies. Nuclear occupational competencies are enduring. 
AF/A10, in partnership with AETC, periodically reviews and biennially assesses the nuclear 
competencies for relevancy and curriculum effectiveness. 
A2.3.  Application.  All nuclear military and civilian Airmen and Guardians should be 
knowledgeable in the nuclear occupational competencies: Nuclear Policy and Strategy; Nuclear 
Operations and U.S. Nuclear Forces; U.S. Nuclear Support and Infrastructure; Nuclear Surety; 
NC3; and Unique Aspects of the Nuclear Mission, at the appropriate proficiency level. 
Additionally, these competencies inform PME, DE, orientations, and many training platforms to 
ensure all Airmen and Guardians get a basic understanding of this special weapons mission and its 
importance in the National Strategy. 
A2.4.  Proficiency.  Each nuclear occupational competency is coupled with a proficiency level. 
The proficiency levels (from lowest to highest) are Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 
A2.4.1.  Basic. Focus is on Airmen and Guardians developing a foundation of nuclear 
education. They are new or relatively new to the DAF, acclimating to and learning the 
fundamental role of the DAF’s nuclear mission. Basic proficiency is a general awareness of 
the nuclear mission required of all Airmen and Guardians, as indicated in Figure 6.1 It is also 
the foundation for understanding and appreciating the special weapon mission for all Airmen 
and Guardians assigned to supporting that mission. 
A2.4.2.  Intermediate. Airmen and Guardians continue learning and developing nuclear 
professional skills, understanding how to leverage other NMPs and other knowledge sources, 
and beginning to apply their required job knowledge to their work. They are learning their role 
and the impacts of what they do on the DAF’s nuclear mission. 
 
 
DAFI13-504  23 NOVEMBER 2021 
47 
A2.4.3.  Advanced. At this level, NMPs leverage knowledge of nuclear strategies and issues 
to develop, present, and implement solutions. They may lead organizations with a nuclear 
mission and/or supervise teams in direct support of the nuclear mission, and understand the 
contributions and consequences of their role in the nuclear mission. Advanced NMPs consult 
with SMEs and share an understanding of how areas of competence influence each other. 
Advanced NMPs who may lead or manage large, complex, multi-tiered organizations 
contribute to the development of nuclear capabilities by articulating the benefit of solutions. 
NMPs achieve an advanced competency when completion of nuclear education coursework is 
coupled with requisite training and experience. 
A2.4.4.  Expert. At this level, NMPs apply their nuclear education, expertise, and knowledge 
to strategic problem solving for nuclear mission objectives. As recognized SMEs and nuclear 
thought leaders, expert NMPs synthesize information to develop solutions to complex nuclear 
challenges and promote critical thinking and diversity of thought. They may lead large, 
complex, multi-tiered organizations, direct rigorous nuclear-wide assessments, and lead 
improvement efforts. These NMPs expertly articulate, arbitrate, and advocate for the nuclear 
mission and may represent the DAF externally. NMPs achieve Expert competency when 
completion of nuclear education coursework is coupled with requisite training and experience.
