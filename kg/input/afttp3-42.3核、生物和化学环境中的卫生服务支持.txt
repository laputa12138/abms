PURPOSE: This tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) publication provides tactical 
deployed medical commanders (DMCs) guidance and procedures to plan, prepare, and employ 
their assigned assets in nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) environments.  Founded in joint 
and Air Force counter NBC and health service support (HSS) operational level doctrine (Joint 
Publication [JP] 3-11, Joint Doctrine for Operations in Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical 
Environments; JP 4-02 [Final Draft], Doctrine for Health Service Support in Joint Operations; 
Air Force Doctrine Document [AFDD] 2-1.8, Counter Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical 
Operations; and AFDD 2-4.2, Health Services), this TTP provides procedures for HSS to US Air 
Force operational missions.  It forms the bridge between operational doctrine, other Air Force 
Medical Service (AFMS) TTPs, AFMS unit type code (UTC) concepts of operations (CONOPS), 
and tactical policy and guidance as referenced throughout this publication. 
 
APPLICATION: This publication applies to all Air Force military and civilian personnel 
(including Air Force Reserve Command [AFRC] and Air National Guard [ANG] units and 
members).  The doctrine in this document is authoritative but not directive. 
 
SCOPE: Each forward operating location (FOL) will be unique.  Medical NBC defense 
operations will be deliberately planned in the base support plan (BSP), chapter 16, (refer to AFI 
10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning).  This TTP provides a common 
operating picture to the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR), planning staff on the 
notional laydown, time-phased employment, and utility of the various AFMS UTCs in NBC 
environments.  This TTP is warfighting doctrine, written for air and space expeditionary task 
forces (AETF) in high intensity operations in high NBC threat operational areas, but it has 
applicability across the spectrum of military operations.

Chapter 1 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1.  Overview. 
 
1.1.1.  This TTP provides roles and responsibilities as well as planning and logistical 
considerations for the deployed medical commander (DMC).  Although the focus of this 
document is on expeditionary medical operations in nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) 
threat environments, it is relevant to medical commanders at main operating bases in similar 
environments.  Air Force Medical Service NBC defense operations are organized in terms of 
two force health protection concepts—casualty prevention and casualty care.  Casualty 
prevention operations are further categorized under the NBC passive defense concepts of 
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.  Casualty care operations 
include patient decontamination, triage, clinical care of NBC casualties, patient movement on 
the airbase, aeromedical evacuation, and restriction of movement/quarantine.  This TTP 
references other publications and resources for specific tactical details and defines education 
and training procedures for DMCs to ensure their personnel are trained and prepared to 
execute missions in NBC environments.  See attachment 2 for a summary of the mission 
capability statements (MISCAPS) of NBC-related AFMS UTCs and attachment 5 for a 
reference bibliography. 
 
1.1.2.  Air Force Health Service Support in Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) 
Environments reflects the US Air Force ground support operational environment.  Air 
operations conducted in high NBC threat areas may launch from airfields that are likely 
primary targets of enemy NBC attack—air bases are lucrative targets.  Air Force Medical 
Service assets support the passive defense (PD) component of Air Force operational counter 
NBC doctrine (refer to AFDD 2-1.8, Counter Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Operations), as 
well as the tactical surveillance and identification components of the cross-cutting element of 
command, 
control, 
communications, 
computers, 
intelligence, 
surveillance 
and 
reconnaissance (C4ISR).  Routine disease surveillance information may be the sentinel 
indication of biological agent use—early disease recognition enables intervention and 
minimizes combat capability degradation.  The DMC has a need-to-know and must be 
cognizant of operational intelligence of the enemy NBC threat.  The DMC and key staff need 
appropriate security clearances for access to this information and they need to be integrated 
into the AETF battlestaff and NBC Defense Cell. 
 
1.1.3.  Biological warfare attack may create a disease mass casualty situation in the AETF.  
The DMC has the core knowledge and competency for many biological warfare passive 
defense actions.  The AFMS is fielding deployable and forward-deployed assets that employ 
biotechnology to rapidly and accurately identify specific pathogens of military concern.  This 
capability coupled with health surveillance systems built on advanced information 
technology and management architecture—such as the Global Expeditionary Medical System 
(GEMS)—may provide early recognition of a covert biological warfare attack and rapid 
identification of the agents, vastly improving commander situational awareness and enabling 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002

early intervention.  Casualty prevention assets identify and quantify chemical and 
nuclear/radiological agent exposure and provide health-based operational risk assessments to 
commanders to minimize operational impact of the agents.  Medical assets and information 
save lives and maximize combat effectiveness by providing critical components of the air 
base passive defense, tactical NBC surveillance and identification missions, and by treating 
and stabilizing NBC casualties. 
 
1.2.  Asymmetric Threat.  Adversarial use of NBC weapons creates an asymmetric threat that 
will challenge the execution of air operations.  This section provides a general overview of the 
types of NBC agents or materials, weapons, and their medical effects and implications.  The 
DMC or senior medical officer (SMO) must have access to operational and tactical intelligence 
information, estimates, and resources impacting their specific area of operations in order to 
effectively carry out their responsibilities and adjust medical posture based upon the threat 
presented.  It is imperative that all medical personnel know the command and control structure if 
and when an NBC attack occurs, in order to most effectively support force health protection.  
Refer to AFMAN 32-4017, Civil Engineer Readiness Technician’s Manual for Nuclear 
Biological and Chemical Defense for further details.  
 
1.3.  Chemical and Biological (CB) Weapons.  CB weapons are a relatively cheap force 
multiplier that many nations or non-state individuals or groups are in the process of obtaining or 
have already obtained.  The production processes for chemical and biological weapons are very 
similar to those of industrial-use chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  Therefore, any country with a 
developed chemical or pharmaceutical production capability has the inherent ability to produce 
CB agents/weapons.  The capability to produce these agents does not necessarily equate with the 
ability to effectively deploy them. 
 
1.4.  Biological Warfare (BW) Agents. 
 
1.4.1.  BW weapons can be employed by an enemy to produce mass casualties and disrupt air 
operations.  These actions have the potential to significantly burden or even overwhelm 
deployed medical assets.  Primary targets are support facilities such as ports, airfields, and 
industrial sites where large numbers of susceptible personnel may be exposed.  Vaccines do 
not exist for all potential BW agents.  Widespread and sporadic BW attacks would force a 
protective posture, thereby degrading US operational effectiveness.  Feasible threats include 
development of alternate BW agents such as hemorrhagic fever viruses for which there are 
no available vaccines or effective treatment, and altering properties of bacterial, viral, and 
toxin BW agents so that current treatment is ineffective.  Effective NBC defense requires 
detection, identification, and warning; individual protection and collective protection; 
hardening; and decontamination capabilities; as well as real-time health surveillance and 
epidemiology, and rapid diagnostic capability to facilitate prompt medical treatment. 
 
1.4.2.  Due to proliferation of biological agent production capabilities and means of delivery, 
the possibility of a BW attack or exposure event poses a significant threat.  Munitions that 
combine fragmentation or flechette effects can be used, inflicting conventional-type injuries 
combined with effects of biological agents.  BW agent events can occur at times other than 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002

deliberate hostile action, such as a BW facility accident, military strike on a BW installation, 
a covert/overt bioterrorism incident, covert contamination of food/water, or exposure 
downwind to an agent from a distant target.  There may be a characteristic delay in 
symptoms that may mimic those related to endemic or common disease processes, which 
complicates warning and response.  Early warning detection and rapid differential 
identification are crucial to casualty prevention and casualty care.  Most infectious BW 
agents, such as Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent for anthrax, cause disease after two or 
more days in unprotected, directly exposed individuals.  If not treated immediately, the 
inhalation form of the disease is usually fatal.  Some agents, such as the organisms that cause 
smallpox and plague, are transmitted person to person and could initiate highly contagious 
spread beyond those directly exposed. 
 
1.4.3.  Biological weapons include both pathogens and toxins.  Pathogens are defined as 
organisms that cause disease in man and include bacteria, rickettsia, viruses, and fungi.  
Bacterial agents that produce anthrax, plague, tularemia, and Q-fever may be grown and 
exploited for military purposes.  These organisms can produce a wide range of results, with 
varying degrees of morbidity and time of onset.  Routes of entry include: percutaneous, 
ingestion, inhalation, and parenteral, which impact dramatically on the effective dosage of 
the agent.  Alternatively, organisms can be grown to produce toxins that are exploited in 
weapons, for example, Clostridium botulinum, which produces neurotoxins that cause 
botulism.  It can cause debilitating or lethal effects within a few hours of exposure, but is not 
contagious. 
 
1.4.4.  Toxins are poisonous compounds produced by living organisms.  They are usually 
proteins that act upon specific receptors in the body.  Toxins can be either lethal or highly 
incapacitating, with some having potentially greater toxicity than well-known CW agents.  
Toxins are produced by a variety of organisms, including microbes, snakes, insects, spiders, 
sea creatures, and plants.  Algal toxins (derived from algae) are suited for BW purposes 
because of their high toxicity, the lack of vaccines and medical treatment, and the lack of 
detection systems deployed against them. 
 
1.4.5.  For BW agent characteristics (e.g., transmission, incubation period, persistence, etc.), 
refer to Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook published by the US Army 
Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).  The handbook can be 
downloaded from their website: http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebook.html. 
 
1.5.  Chemical Warfare (CW) Agents. 
 
1.5.1.  CW agents can be divided into four types:  nerve, cyanide (blood), vesicant (blister), 
and pulmonary (choking) agents: 
 
1.5.1.1.  Nerve agents include the G series and V series.  These agents affect the nervous 
system’s ability to function correctly, thereby interrupting bodily functions such as 
breathing.  Specifically, they inhibit acetylcholinesterase and the medical effects are a 
result of excess acetycholine. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002

1.5.1.2.  Cyanides (blood agents) are absorbed into the body primarily by inhalation.  
They prevent the normal utilization of oxygen by the cells and cause rapid damage to 
body tissues.  Blood agents such as hydrogen cyanide (AC) and cyanogen chloride (CK) 
are highly volatile and in the gaseous state dissipate rapidly in air. 
 
1.5.1.3.  Vesicants (blister agents) are used primarily to cause medical casualties.  These 
agents may also be used to restrict use of terrain, to slow movements, and to hamper use 
of materiel and installations.  Vesicants affect the eyes and lungs and blister the skin.  
Sulfur mustard, nitrogen mustard, and lewisite are examples of blister agents. 
 
1.5.1.4.  Pulmonary (choking) agents are the oldest chemical warfare agents and include 
phosgene and chlorine.  Because they are gases, they are nonpersistent and dissipate 
rapidly in a breeze. 
 
1.5.2.  There are also a whole range of nonlethal agents that have been developed to include 
tear gas, vomiting agents, and incapacitating agents.  These agents would generally be used 
in conjunction with lethal agents.  For example, use of a vomiting agent to keep troops from 
donning protective masks would be deployed first, followed by a lethal CW agent. 
 
1.5.3.  The effective use of chemical weapons relies on many factors including an effective 
employment strategy, a delivery platform, and the agent itself.  While many nations possess 
chemical agents or the capability to produce them, few have well defined employment 
strategy to use them in any manner other than as a weapon of mass terror.  A nation must also 
have a method to deliver the agent.  Most conventional munitions can be modified to deliver 
lethal and nonlethal chemical agents.  Typical delivery methods include:  aerial bombs, 
artillery rockets, artillery shells, mortar rounds, bomblets, mines, and missile warheads.  
Chemical agents can also be dispersed using air and ground-based aerosol generators or 
sprayers. The number of casualties depends on the number of people in the area, the length of 
warning, and the degree of protection, as well as the persistency and lethality of the agent 
used.  Weather and terrain are also major factors as they affect chemical agent dispersal and 
dissipation. 
 
1.6.  Nuclear Weapons/Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDDs). 
 
1.6.1.  These weapons range greatly in size and energy yield and can be employed by a 
variety of means.  A radiological dispersal device (RDD) is a device that contains explosives 
and radioactive material.  The media often refers to this device as a “poor man’s nuclear 
weapon.”  The device is intended to disperse radioactive material and does not require the 
use of sophisticated nuclear components.  Deployment of a RDD could result in life 
threatening radiation injuries without the blast or heat effects that accompany a nuclear 
weapon. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
8
1.6.2.  Nuclear capability is possessed by a growing number of countries.  While blast and 
thermal injury will account for most of the casualties, radiation effects will also be 
significant. 
 
1.6.3.  A nuclear incident has the potential to instantaneously produce a very large number of 
casualties, severely burdening the entire medical evacuation and treatment system.  The 
difference between conventional weapons and nuclear weapons is the different types and 
extent of injuries produced.  Many of the patients injured by nuclear weapons will require 
evacuation.  A patient with multiple injuries will be at extremely high risk, frequently 
requiring ventilator respiratory support.  Effectiveness of treatment is related to appropriate 
supply levels and numbers of medical personnel, advanced diagnostic capability, use of 
equipment and techniques within the current standard of care, specialty consultation, medical 
information access, communication and air evacuation, and ability to process tests and data 
rapidly.  Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) released by the blast may disrupt communications, 
computers, and biomedical equipment and certainly could have medical impact. 
 
1.6.4.  In addition to the effects of blast, heat, and radiation on equipment, personnel, 
facilities, and communications, the psychological effects of such weapons are enormous.  
Potential for a mass casualty situation is significant. 
 
1.7.  Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs). 
 
1.7.1.  There is a growing concern that the wide availability of many TICs and TIMs makes 
them potential tools for attacks against our forces.  While relatively benign and not usually 
considered a primary threat, these materials are generally available from commercial sources 
and can be easily obtained in large quantities.  Their release could cause casualties or disrupt 
operations.  Gases and vapors can pose serious atmospheric health or explosive hazards, 
whereas liquids and solids may be used to contaminate potable water or food supplies.  Some 
materials may be made more toxic with relatively simple chemical modifications.  Hostile 
forces could target industrial plants, agricultural warehouses, or treatment facilities located 
on or near a deployed site.  TIC/TIM examples include: insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers, 
and the raw chemicals/solvents used to manufacture them (i.e., chlorine gas, acids, etc.); 
petrochemical facilities (explosive gases, flammable liquids); nuclear materials (research 
laboratories, nuclear medicine, nuclear power plants); and research laboratories (chemical 
and biological materials). 
 
1.7.2.  Depending on the type and quantity of TICs/TIMs, a deliberate release could present a 
short- or long-term hazard at the release site and for those within the downwind chemical 
plume.  They would disperse similarly as chemical warfare agents.  The vapors tend to 
remain concentrated downwind from the release point and in natural low-lying areas such as 
valleys, ravines, or man-made underground structures.  High concentrations may remain in 
buildings, woods, or any area with low air circulation.  They can be stable and persistent.  
Immediate evacuation outside the hazard’s path is the best course of action in case of 
TIC/TIM release.

1.7.3.  The protective mask, ensemble, and military standard collective protection (CP) filters 
may provide only limited protection.  Shelter-in-place procedures may be ineffective for 
certain toxic gases.  The greatest risk from a large-scale toxic chemical release occurs when 
personnel receive little or no warning, are unable to escape the immediate area, and are 
overcome.  Refer to the following for planning and response guidelines: AFI 10-2501 
[Draft], Full Spectrum Threat Response Operations; AFH 10-2502, WMD Threat Planning 
and Response Handbook; AFMAN 32-4002, Hazardous Materials Emergency Planning and 
Response Program; AFMAN 10-2602 [Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and 
Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards; AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel 
Protection and Attack Actions; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pocket 
Guide to Chemical Hazards; and US Department of Transportation, North American 
Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG), to preplan and predict downwind hazard distances 
for day or nighttime release.  Refer to HQ AFCESA publication Protective Actions For A 
Hazardous Material Release, A US Air Force Protection Actions Planning Guide For 
Individuals and Facility Managers for shelter in-place guidelines and protective actions.

Chapter 2 
 
COMMAND, CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATIONS 
 
2.1.  Command and Control.  Command and control of Air Force medical assets is vested in 
the line of the Air Force (LAF).  The information in this chapter is consistent with AFDD 2, 
Organization and Employment of Aerospace Power, and AFTTP 3-42.1 [Draft], Medical 
Command and Control. 
 
2.2.  Operational Command Relationships. 
 
2.2.1.  The air and space expeditionary task force (AETF) is the designated US Air Force 
organization to fulfill the joint task force (JTF) and joint forces air component commander 
(JFACC) campaign objectives.  Within the AETF organizational structure, expeditionary 
wings, groups, and squadrons are established to provide administrative control (ADCON) of 
air force forces. 
 
2.2.2.  An AETF encompasses all US Air Force forces assigned or attached to the JTF and 
includes other forces dedicated to the JTF mission provided via reachback.  The command 
element includes the AETF commander (the COMAFFOR), a staff, and a command and 
control (C2) function.  The joint force commander (JFC) should delegate operational control 
(OPCON) of assigned/attached US Air Force forces to the COMAFFOR.  The COMAFFOR 
typically does not delegate OPCON to subordinate commanders. 
 
2.2.3.  The supported air component will establish command relationships within an AETF in 
the tasking orders.  Medical force packages deployed into the theater of operations should be 
activated by special order as an expeditionary medical squadron or group, unless attached to 
a larger medical unit (a small logistics team may be attached to an expeditionary medical 
operations squadron [EMOS]).  Deployed medical forces should be under the operational 
control of the COMAFFOR, who also exercises specified ADCON over these forces when 
attached. 
 
2.2.4.  Medical force packages may be designated by tasking order as deployed in direct 
support to an expeditionary unit; or in general support to multiple units, or to the entire 
theater.  As an example, an EMOS may be deployed to Base-X in direct support of the host 
wing and should be attached to that wing for ADCON purposes.  A theater epidemiological 
team (TET), or other expeditionary medical support (EMEDS)-independent UTCs, may also 
be deployed to Base-X and be attached to the same wing for ADCON purposes but tasked in 
general support to the theater under operational control of the COMAFFOR. 
 
2.3.  Operational Communications. 
 
2.3.1.  The Annex K and Annex Q of the operation plan (OPLAN) detail the communications 
architecture between echelons of command and between supported and supporting units, and 
provide security procedures and frequencies.  In cases where no OPLAN is published, the 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
11
tasking order should provide communications detail or it is determined in predeployment 
planning between the DMC and the supported Air Force forces (AFFOR) Surgeon (SG) for 
medical communications such as between DMC and the patient movement requirements 
center [PMRC] and within the deploying aerospace expeditionary force (AEF) for internal 
communications.  It is critical to ensure that communications assets and systems are 
compatible with systems used in the theater of operations. 
 
2.3.2.  A wing staff is usually established at the air expeditionary wing (AEW) level to 
provide ADCON support to attached forces.  This staff provides personnel, intelligence, 
operations, logistics, plans, and communications support.  Upon beddown, it is important for 
the DMC to establish a support relationship with the wing staff.  The medical logistics 
noncommissioned officer (NCO) needs to know how to access logistics support.  The 
medical communications NCO needs access to communications and systems support.  
However, the AEW’s staff likely has no medical representative to provide medical-unique 
support.  Therefore, upon beddown it is critical for the DMC to reestablish communication 
with the AFFOR Surgeon’s staff for medical-unique logistics support, medical intelligence, 
and functional guidance.  This relationship should already exist from communications during 
predeployment planning. 
 
2.3.3.  In a high-threat NBC area, the communications architecture includes lines of 
communication among deployed combat units, medical units tasked with medical care, and 
specialized units providing NBC detection and warning functions, either in direct support to 
deployed unit, or in general support to several units or the theater.  The DMC must 
understand this NBC-related communications architecture to effectively gain NBC threat 
intelligence and associated guidance, and to upchannel information and data for analysis by 
specialized teams tasked with NBC surveillance functions.  Chapter 4, “Planning 
Considerations,” addresses specialized NBC teams and their lines of communication.

Chapter 3 
 
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
3.1.  Deployed Medical Commander (DMC) or Senior Medical Officer (SMO).  The DMC or 
SMO will face medical tasks unprecedented in modern American warfare in the event of an NBC 
attack on an air base.  Mass casualty situations inherently exceed the capability of normal 
medical care and NBC events may further stress these systems to the point of breaking.  
Therefore, the DMC must aggressively plan and prepare prior to an event in order to provide 
appropriate force health protection to the wing mission and to prepare his/her unit’s ability to 
operate in NBC environments.  Ensuring AETF mission success is paramount—proper planning, 
aggressive casualty prevention programs integrated into the wing mission, triage and life saving 
activities will minimize the effect of adversary use of NBC weapons and contribute to AETF 
mission success.  This chapter describes roles, responsibilities, and tasks for DMCs and senior 
personnel during predeployment, deployment, and postdeployment to NBC high threat areas.  
Predeployment is assumed to start upon receipt of a warning order or other notification of 
imminent deployment. 
 
3.2.  DMC Medical Planning. 
  
 
3.2.1.  The DMC’s assets and capabilities must be fully integrated into the wing mission to 
ensure mission success.  There will be a variety of in-place and/or deployed medical assets and 
capabilities.  The DMC will use this TTP, other TTPs in the 3-42 series, AFMAN 10-2602 
[Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and 
Standards, UTC CONOPS, local plans, line of the AF guidance, and their operational knowledge 
and experience to employ limited resources to support the wing mission and assure effective 
passive defense in an NBC attack.  In most cases, NBC planning and response are coordinated 
through the AETF survival recovery center (SRC) by the Civil Engineer Readiness Officer 
and/or NCO.  The DMC, as a member of the battlestaff, must ensure the AETF knows and 
understands the medical capabilities and constraints in NBC environments and the requirements 
of the deployed medical facility (DMF) to support the wing mission in NBC environments.  The 
DMC should ensure a Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) or NCO (if available) is tasked to the 
SRC to serve as the health risk assessor and command advisor for nuclear, biological, and 
chemical attacks and recovery actions.  The biological augmentation team (BAT) or theater 
epidemiology team (TET) can be consulted for preliminary biological agent identification and 
consultation.  Additionally, the assigned public health officer is a resource for BW agent 
consultation regarding the medical effects, epidemiology, prevention and control, surveillance, 
vaccination, prophylaxis and treatment. When this specialty is not locally available, the DMC 
should contact the COMAFFOR for guidance and support.  Refer to AFH 32-4014, Vol 1, USAF 
Operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) Warfare Environment, CB Planning and 
Analysis, for specific guidance on how the wing NBC SRC is normally organized.  (Note:  AFH 
32-4014 will be superseded by AFMAN 10-2602 [Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and 
Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.)

3.2.2.  DMCs must know and understand the operational concept and intent of their 
commanders and the COMAFFOR as expressed in the various OPLANs/operation orders 
(OPORDs) and annexes (Annex Q and other NBC relevant annexes).  Communication between 
the DMC (through their chain of command) and the COMAFFOR’s staff should ensure that the 
DMC fully understands and is able to support the mission with assigned resources.  DMC 
reporting should include any limiting factors (LIMFACS) through medical reports (MEDREPs) 
and/or situation reports (SITREPs).  The DMC must create and maintain a communications link 
with the AFFOR Surgeon and ensure health surveillance reporting requirements are 
implemented.

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
 
4.1.  Operational Planning.  Operational doctrine for the employment of AFMS deployable 
assets is in development.  The Air Force theater medical system operates within the AETF and 
JTF structures to support combatant commander objectives.  When the threat of NBC use is high, 
a robust expeditionary NBC structure is required to support the mission.  To assist operational 
planners and the AFFOR Surgeon as they develop contingency specific medical CONOPS in 
support of joint force commander (JFC) deliberate and crisis action plans, this document offers 
the following planning guidance for employment of AFMS assets in NBC environments.  
Planners must review and understand the MISCAPS and CONOPS of the various AFMS UTCs 
to fully understand how best to employ them.  Attachment 2 is a summary of the UTC MISCAPS 
with NBC relevance. 
 
4.2.  Commander, AFFOR (COMAFFOR).  COMAFFOR medical assets—both NBC 
specialty and general casualty care—are available to provide health service support in the theater 
of operations.  Using his/her operational knowledge and experience, the COMAFFOR must 
balance available lift and time against the NBC and conventional threats to lay down medical 
assets at theater and wing levels to maximize health service support.  Medical UTCs are 
modularized and employed incrementally using a tiered approach with a tailored response based 
upon mission requirements, medical threat, and population at risk (PAR).  Increasing NBC and 
other medical threats should be considered when evaluating the proper order of buildup of 
capabilities.   In operations where the planner cannot lay down a more robust medical NBC 
capability, they should use a hub and spoke concept and utilize opportune transportation to 
support far forward locations.  This approach increases response time and NBC risk at each 
location and must be balanced against lift constraints and NBC threat in the theater and at each 
operating location. 
 
4.3.  Medical Unit Type Code (UTC) Laydown.  Successful NBC attacks may produce mass 
casualty events.  When the AFFOR theater medical concept of operations is developed, planners 
must consider the risk of NBC attack and the increased burden on medical infrastructure.  The 
medical laydown and CONOPS for NBC environments should be seamless and consistent with 
non-NBC CONOPS to the extent possible.  The same building block approach should be used, 
where medical NBC-specific assets are laid over conventional medical assets.  The flow of these 
assets into the theater must be driven by the mission needs of the JFC and relative medical 
threats. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
15
 
4.3.1.  The operational planner should understand the capabilities and limiting factors 
(LIMFACS) of the UTCs when planning health service support (HSS) throughout the theater 
of operations in NBC environments (refer to UTC CONOPS, MISCAPS, and Allowance 
Standards).  The medical UTCs and their potential application in NBC environments are 
listed in Table 4.1.  Unless otherwise indicated, without CP, UTCs will be unable to treat 
casualties in chemical contaminated environments and may suffer operational degradation in 
radiological or biological environments.

Note 1—Clinical capabilities from squadron medical elements (SMEs) and independent duty 
medical technicians (IDMTs) will provide only minimal ability to treat and care for NBC 
casualties, and these assets do not have CP systems.  Without CP, their ability to treat casualties in 
NBC environments will be limited.  CP begins at the EMEDS Basic level.  The contingency 
aeromedical staging facility (CASF)/mobile aeromedical staging facility (MASF) do not currently 
have CP and any patients awaiting movement during an attack will require individual protective 
equipment (IPE) or protective patient wraps. 
Note 2—The population at risk (PAR) will determine if Basic, +10, or +25 bed sizes are adequate.  
[Note the definition of PAR as it is used in this document; not to be confused with NBC defense 
personnel’s use of the acronym to mean post-attack reconnaissance.] 
Note 3—The combat stress team, the theater epidemiology team, and the Air Force radiation 
assessment team (AFRAT) are deployed in general support of the theater of operations rather than 
as direct support installation-level medical assets. 
Note 4—The PAM and SPEARR teams are organic to the EMEDS packages and have limited 
NBC defense capabilities and resources.  Although these teams may already be in place or may be 
deployed to a NBC environment, these assets should not be intentionally deployed alone.

4.3.2.  Figure 4.1 reflects a notional time-phased incremental employment of many of the 
capabilities listed in Table 4.1.  This figure is intended to guide the considerations and aid the 
operational art of the planner—the planner must balance available lift against threat of NBC 
use and population at risk.

Note 1—The TET is deployable to the theater level in support of the joint task force (JTF) surgeon 
(SG) or the air component SG. 
Note 2—The AFRAT is deployable (in nuclear threat environments) to the theater level in support 
of the joint task force (JTF) surgeon (SG) or the air component SG. 
Note 3—The CHATH will be deployed to support tent, expandable, modular, personnel 
(TEMPER)-tented medical configurations (primarily in PACAF) until they are replaced with 
Small Shelter System (i.e., EMEDS) tents in the inventory. 
 
4.3.2.1.  For instance, deployable CP systems will not be available until CP EMEDS 
Basic.  Smaller medical units (i.e., ATC, PAM, GRL, SPEARR) and any aeromedical 
staging facility (ASF)/mobile aeromedical staging facility (MASF) will have limited 
clinical capabilities in contaminated environments.  Commanders of these assets must 
plan and prepare to cease shirtsleeve clinical care and don individual protective 
equipment (IPE) (both medical personnel and patients) upon chemical or biological 
attack.  Upon attack warning, medical personnel will place patients who cannot wear IPE

due to their injuries in NBC protective wraps (if available) and continue lifesaving care to 
the greatest extent possible. 
 
4.3.2.2.  Commanders of medical assets must preplan alternate facilities, as well as 
route/mode of evacuation for contaminated casualties, in the event their infrastructure is 
contaminated with persistent chemical agents.  Casualty prevention-oriented UTCs 
should arrive prior to treatment-oriented UTCs, once basic medical care coverage (e.g., 
SME, PAM, IDMT, etc.) is in place on site.  Prevention through disease surveillance and 
risk management may limit exposed populations.  Wartime Medical Decontamination 
Teams (WMDTs), and/or local line/medical personnel and materiel of opportunity will be 
used to provide patient decontamination should the need occur.  Two FFGLB teams may 
be required to sustain 24-hour patient decontamination capability. 
 
4.3.3.  Figure 4.2 illustrates the beddown to support a medical CONOPS that uses squadron 
medical elements (SMEs) at forward operating bases.  They are supported by mobile trauma 
stabilization and fixed-wing aeromedical evacuation (AE) from the Level 3 deployed medical 
facility at the intratheater airlift hub.  Base B has organic EMEDS Basic support due to a 
larger PAR and distance from the airlift hub.

4.3.4.  The beddown in Figure 4.3 supports the same medical CONOPS as in Figure 4.2 but 
adds medical NBC capability to account for the high NBC threat.  Two patient 
decontamination teams with one equipment set, one biological augmentation team, one 
bioenvironmental engineering NBC team, and one augmented infectious disease team (IDT) 
provide direct support to the CP EMEDS+25 at the airlift hub and provide general support to 
specific forward operating locations.  One patient decontamination team with 
decontamination equipment (FFGLA) is attached to the EMEDS Basic at Base B, due to the 
distance from the airlift hub.  Additionally, one theater epidemiology team and a radiological 
assessment team are attached to the wing at the airlift hub for ADCON, but are in general 
support to the theater under OPCON of the COMAFFOR (refer to paragraphs 2.2.2. and 
2.2.3.).

developing Task, Time, and Treater files for use in the MAT for various NBC casualty profiles.  
These files can be used to determine Class VIII equipment and supply requirements.  The 
Services are responsible for generating casualty estimates and tracking casualty rates for 
contingency operations.  In the Air Force, this is the responsibility of the planning and operations 
communities. 
 
4.5.  Protective Measures with Treatment Areas.  The senior Air Force commander may 
delegate the authority to determine Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) levels and other 
protective measures within medical areas or sectors to the DMC or SMO.  To implement this 
action, the medical facility must have the capability to provide NBC detection and identification 
capabilities similar to that provided by Civil Engineer NBC Reconnaissance Teams.  This 
authority, if exercised, must be personally delegated by the senior Air Force commander.  The 
medical staff must also verify with the NBC defense cell that medical areas are not within the 
downwind vapor plume of an agent disposition area.  Medical personnel will conduct detection, 
monitoring, and contamination assessment within these designated areas.  See AFMAN 10-2602 
[Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and 
Standards for additional information on protective measures and MOPP.  (Refer to paragraph 
5.4.8 for details).   
 
4.6.  Tactical Planning. 
 
4.6.1.  Predeployment Planning Considerations and Responsibilities (In-Garrison).  
Most of these actions should have been accomplished prior to receiving the warning order—
the intent of this section is to serve as a reminder to the DMC to ensure his forces are 
prepared to deploy, quickly reach initial operational capability (IOC), and conduct their 
mission.  The deploying medical commander is responsible for preparing medical forces to 
deploy and providing force health protection guidance to the deploying wing commander for 
use in the development of wing deployment plans. 
 
4.6.1.1.  Medical Deployment Plans.  Request and review the COMAFFOR’s 
supporting plan to the combatant commander’s operation plan, the NBC passive defense 
plans, the OPLAN Annex Q, the deliberate plans from the beddown base (Base X 
Disaster Preparedness Plan 32-1 [refer to AFI 32-4001, Disaster Preparedness Planning 
and Operations to be superseded by AFI 10-2501 (Draft), Full Spectrum Threat 
Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations], the medical contingency response plan 
(MCRP) [refer to AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training] or equivalent, 
and the Base X Support Plan [refer to AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site 
Planning]). 
 
4.6.1.2.  Predeployment Plan.  This plan defines how the medical force will arrive at the 
beddown location, detailing tasks required to set-up and achieve IOC status.  Based on 
tasking order direction and the NBC threat assessment, the DMC considers NBC passive 
defense measures in generating the beddown plan.  In the chronology of beddown 
actions, the deploying DMC should determine when detection, surveillance, protective, 
and decontamination capabilities need to be operational, driving beddown task priorities 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
20
and assignments.  Specifically, when multiple medical UTCs deploy as a force package, 
the DMC must determine the balance between casualty care and NBC detection/defense 
capabilities when tasking work details to orchestrate set-up.  Key tasks to be prioritized 
by threat and command direction: 
 
4.6.1.2.1.  Establish chemical detection and reporting capability for the DMF within 
medical areas or sectors. 
 
4.6.1.2.2.  Establish NBC sampling capability. 
 
4.6.1.2.3.  Establish pathogen identification capability. 
 
4.6.1.2.4.  Establish radiation detection capability to ensure DMF is equipped to 
detect radiation if unit is deployed in a location where a nuclear/radiological threat is 
expected.   
 
4.6.1.2.5.  Initiate medical surveillance to support early biological agent detection and 
disease and nonbattle injury (DNBI) reporting. 
 
4.6.1.2.6.  Establish communication links with medical intelligence and NBC 
reporting systems. 
 
4.6.1.2.7.  Establish medical collection protection capability where available. 
 
4.6.1.2.8.  Establish patient decontamination capability. 
 
4.6.1.2.9.  Determine PAR and any NBC casualty estimates. 
 
4.6.1.2.10.  Tailor personnel and equipment to meet JFC and COMAFFOR required 
capabilities. 
 
4.6.1.2.11.  Ensure appropriate deploying unit NBC training has occurred. 
 
4.6.1.2.12.  NBC and Conventional Defense Training (NBCCDT) and self-aid/buddy 
care (SABC)—ensure all personnel can don/doff mission-oriented protection posture 
(MOPP) gear and conduct mission essential tasks at appropriate MOPP levels.  Refer 
to AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, and AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel Protection 
and Attack Actions (to be superceded by AFMAN 10-2601 [Draft], Counter NBC 
Operations and Standards), for specific actions. 
 
4.6.1.2.13.  UTC specific—ensure mission specific UTC training has been 
accomplished (refer to AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training). 
 
4.6.1.2.14.  Identify NBC-related shortfalls/LIMFACS to wing and major command 
(MAJCOM). 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
21
 
4.6.1.3.  Civil Engineer (CE) Support.  Medical and CE personnel work together to 
provide the base with a fully integrated NBC defense capability.  The specific roles and 
responsibilities of medical and CE UTCs are described in Attachment 6, NBC Defense–
Related Task Summary.  The DMC should coordinate with CE Readiness when 
integrating NBC considerations into the beddown plan.  This coordination prevents 
duplication of effort and closes capability gaps.  CE support may reduce the time required 
to establish medical care capability by allowing the DMC to emphasize casualty care set-
up first. 
 
4.6.1.4.  Load Plan.  Based on beddown plan priorities and the time-phased flow of 
medical materiel and personnel, the DMC coordinates with the wing’s logistics planner to 
generate a load plan.  The plan enables beddown in an NBC area by deliberately flowing 
NBC passive defense capabilities into the beddown location at the most appropriate time 
in the wing’s overall materiel and personnel flow schedule.   
 
4.6.1.5.  Wing Deployment Plans.  The DMC uses NBC threat assessments to formulate 
force health protection recommendations to the deploying wing commander.  Some force 
health protection actions may be clearly specified in the JFC’s tasking order.  
Considerations include prophylaxis and vaccinations, medical screening criteria, and 
medical threat briefings to establish individual risk management procedures.  Key tasks: 
 
4.6.1.5.1.  Provide guidance to deploying forces on appropriate NBC force health 
protection (FHP) actions. 
 
4.6.1.5.2.  Ensure vaccinations are administered and chemical prophylaxes are issued. 
 
4.6.1.5.3.  Ensure NBC related combat stress issues are addressed/considered. 
 
4.6.1.5.4.  Ensure deploying forces are current in self-aid and buddy care (SABC). 
 
4.6.1.5.5.  Receive joint operations area specific threat brief from wing intelligence. 
 
4.6.1.5.6.  Ensure deploying forces are trained and equipped to meet those threats. 
 
4.6.1.5.7.  Ensure senior medical staff fully understands medical effects and 
ramifications of the enemy order of battle and operational environment. 
 
4.6.1.5.8.  Conduct predeployment health assessments of deploying forces (DD Form 
2795) in accordance with (IAW) combatant commander and MAJCOM requirements 
(refer to CJCS Memo MCM 0006-02, Updated Procedures for Deployment Health 
Surveillance and Readiness). 
 
4.6.1.5.9.  Provide medical intelligence analysis and briefings to commanders and 
deploying forces. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
22
 
4.6.2.  Deployment Considerations and Responsibilities.  Upon beddown, the DMC 
generates or refines the existing Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP) to tailor 
execution details to the specific mission, NBC threat, location, and conditions consistent with 
Base X Support Plan.  Also, the DMC provides medical representation to wing battlestaff and 
survival recovery center (SRC) and NBC Defense Cell tasked with generating or refining the 
wing’s NBC contingency plans.  Refinement of the wing’s plans will cause further 
refinement of the supporting MCRP. 
 
4.6.2.1.  Key DMC actions upon beddown of deployed medical assets and capabilities: 
 
4.6.2.1.1.  Conduct a vulnerability analysis.  Consider intelligence information and 
enemy threat assessments, meteorological data, terrain information, and the tactical 
order of battle of the beddown air base.  Coordinate with wing operations and CE 
Readiness to determine casualty estimates.  Additional information is addressed in 
chapter 5, “Casualty Prevention.” 
 
4.6.2.1.2.  Determine specific actions, procedures, and materiel to maximize NBC 
contamination avoidance. 
 
4.6.2.1.3.  Evaluate the location of the DMF relevant to base operations in NBC 
environment—CW sectoring, NBC detection and reporting network, patient 
movement, and patient decontamination are relevant issues for the DMC and staff to 
consider. 
 
4.6.2.1.4.  Implement or change deliberate planning factors (Base X Support Plan, 
Base OPLAN 10-2, or equivalent).  Develop medical NBC related plans (MCRP or 
equivalent) supporting the wing NBC passive defense plans and consider mutual 
support arrangements with other coalition and host-nation medical facilities. 
 
4.6.2.1.5.  Integrate into wing NBC threat working group and the survival recovery 
center (SRC)—assign medical representatives to battlestaff and SRC. 
 
4.6.2.1.6.  Receive and assess local NBC threat and intelligence briefings—posture 
DMF to meet the threat. 
 
4.6.2.1.7.  Establish communication and procedures with the patient movement 
requirements center (PMRC) for patient movement of NBC casualties. 
 
4.6.2.2.  Review casualty prevention responsibilities (see chapter 5, “Casualty 
Prevention,” for detailed procedures): 
 
4.6.2.2.1.  Employ and conduct medical/environmental surveillance and disease-early 
warning.  Employ the GEMS or other surveillance system as approved for use by the 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
23
supported combatant commander.  Ensure/establish mechanism for reporting medical 
information that may indicate covert BW agent attack to commanders and the SRC. 
 
4.6.2.2.2.  Conduct health-based NBC risk assessments and advise commander.  
Continuously review and update these assessments as necessary. 
 
4.6.2.2.3.  Conduct sampling and analyses to identify, evaluate, record, and report 
NBC agent and occupational and environmental exposures. 
 
4.6.2.2.4.  Conduct a food and water vulnerability assessment.  Take appropriate 
countermeasures to protect the food and water supply from possible sabotage or 
inadvertent contamination. 
 
4.6.2.2.5.  Provide vaccines, prophylaxes and postexposure countermeasures 
consistent with theater directives. 
 
4.6.2.2.6.  Conduct baseline vector surveillance to identify local vectors of disease 
and potential breeding sites. 
 
4.6.2.2.7.  Capture medical and environmental exposure data.  Ensure procedures are 
maintained for appropriate reporting and archiving of health surveillance data and 
reports.  Document notable exposures in individual health records. 
 
4.6.2.2.8.  Conduct or arrange for BW agent presumptive identification and diagnosis. 
 
4.6.2.2.9.  Implement the transportation mechanism for shipping samples to 
laboratories for definitive analyses that cannot be accomplished by local assets. 
 
4.6.2.2.10.  CP of medical materiel and assets.  Operate deployed CP EMEDS+10/25.  
Plan for alternate DMF in the event the existing facility is contaminated and rendered 
unusable. 
 
4.6.2.3.  Review casualty care responsibilities (see chapter 6, “Casualty Care and 
Management,” for detailed procedures): 
 
4.6.2.3.1.  Provide casualty management consistent with deployed level of casualty 
care, logistical tail, and available CP. 
 
4.6.2.3.2.  Establish patient decontamination policy.  Decontamination of casualties 
minimizes the detrimental effects of contamination, protects those who move and 
treat them, and prevents contamination of the medical facility.  Units and individuals 
have primary responsibility for decontamination during the self-aid and buddy care 
process (i.e., M-291 kits).  This should be done as soon as contamination is found and 
prior to moving them to the medical facility—quick action saves lives.  Upon 
completion of SABC efforts and first responder actions, contaminated casualties 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
24
should be moved into the medical treatment system as soon as possible, even if 
decontamination is not complete.  The medical facility will plan for and provide 
patient decontamination.  The wartime patient decontamination team (UTC 
FFGLA/FFGLB) provides this capability.  Medical units without a WMDT may need 
to establish decontamination capability using line and/or medical personnel and 
materiel of opportunity. 
 
4.6.2.3.3.  Establish ground movement policy for NBC casualties on the air base. 
 
4.6.2.3.4.  Recommend restriction of movement and quarantine procedures for 
infectious biological warfare agent casualties as well as for relevant vectors and

4.6.2.3.5.  Ensure availability of vehicles and establish routes for movement of 
contaminated casualties to the DMF. 
 
4.6.2.3.6.  Establish contaminated casualty flow routes within the DMF area. 
 
4.6.3.  Postdeployment Considerations and Responsibilities. 
 
4.6.3.1.  Prior to redeployment, ensure postdeployment health assessments (DD Form 
2796) are completed.  Particular emphasis on actual or perceived environmental 
exposures to NBC agents or materials should be highlighted. 
 
4.6.3.2.  Prior to redeployment, ensure environmental surveillance data addressing 
perceived environmental exposures has been properly documented and stored through 
systems such as GEMS and Command Core. 
 
4.6.3.3.  Continue medical treatment of casualties per established treatment protocols.  
Thorough and accurate documentation of exposures and any treatments received is of 
paramount importance.  
 
4.6.3.4.  Monitor redeploying Service members for the duration of the latency period of 
the biological threat agents of concern as indicated by intelligence assessments. 
 
4.6.3.5.  Write and transmit lessons learned IAW Service requirements and the Joint 
Uniform Lessons Learned System (JULLS).

CASUALTY PREVENTION 
 
5.1.  Overview. 
 
5.1.1.  Casualty prevention is an NBC passive defense force multiplier focusing on threats 
posed by enemy forces and complex endemic and environmental health threats.  Failure to 
counter these threats jeopardizes mission accomplishment. 
 
5.1.1.1.  Enemy Threat.  The enemy threat depends on the enemy’s willingness and 
ability to use conventional and nonconventional weapons systems; munitions; and 
nuclear, biological, and chemical agents (NBC).  Aggressive application of 
countermeasures enhances the force’s ability to minimize combat injuries, combat and 
operational stress reactions, and exposure to NBC agents or materials. 
 
5.1.1.2.  Health Threat.  The health threat depends on a complex set of environmental 
and occupational factors that combine to produce disease and nonbattle injury (DNBI).  
 
5.1.2.  Casualty prevention is an integral part of counter NBC defense operations through 
passive defense and tactical surveillance.  Information provided by ongoing health 
surveillance and DNBI reporting is critical to counter NBC defense operations.  Passive 
defense protects personnel from the effects of an NBC attack and improves the 
capability of personnel to survive and sustain operations in an NBC environment.  The 
three passive defense measures are contamination avoidance, protection, and 
contamination control.  This chapter provides information to the DMC or SMO on casualty 
prevention 
responsibilities 
and 
actions 
during 
predeployment, 
deployment, 
and 
postdeployment. 
 
5.1.3.  Passive defense includes force health protection measures, a process that begins 
before deployment, and encompasses the entire deployment scenario including contamination 
avoidance, protection, and contamination control.  Preparations for operations in potential 
NBC environments begin early in predeployment and include threat assessments, medical 
screening, preexposure immunizations, pretreatments, prophylaxis, quantitative fit testing 
(QNFT) and risk-based training on the ability to survive and operate (ATSO) in NBC 
environments. 
 
5.1.4.  During deployment the casualty prevention aspects of passive defense must be 
aggressively pursued and institutionalized throughout the base and deployed medical facility 
operation to maximize combat effectiveness.  Health surveillance may provide the first 
indication of biological warfare attack.  Chemoprophylaxis may be the sole defense 
sustaining an affected force and could very well be the critical combat force multiplier.  
Casualty prevention seeks to provide the line commander the best available health-based risk 
assessment of the tactical situation—improving his/her situational awareness and enabling 
the warfighter.

5.2.  Predeployment Actions. 
 
 
5.2.1.  Medical Estimate of Situation. 
 
5.2.1.1.  Casualty prevention initiatives using passive defense measures are planned for 
early in the predeployment planning process.  The Public Health Officer (PHO)/NCO or 
designated Medical Intelligence Officer (MIO), in conjunction with the medical NBC 
defense officer and the NBC casualty management officer, evaluates the supported 
operation/mission and all aspects of the deployed location (additional information on 
roles and responsibilities are found in AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and 
Training).  The theater air component provides the medical estimate of the situation to 
deploying bases, usually through reporting instructions to the personnel readiness unit 
(PRU) or Wing Plans (XP).  The PHO/MIO at the deployed base uses this information to 
generate detailed medical threat information with their associated countermeasures and 
provides this information to deploying forces to minimize battle and DNBI.  Refer to 
Annex Q of pertinent deliberate/crisis OPLAN or OPORD.  The DMC must review the 
medical estimate prior to deployment to adequately plan for the deployed medical threat. 
 
5.2.1.2.  Medical threat is the composite of all ongoing or potential enemy actions and 
environmental conditions that will reduce combat effectiveness through wounding, 
injuring, disease, and/or degrading performance.  Weapons or environmental conditions 
that will generate wounded, injured, and sick personnel, beyond the capability of the 
medical system to provide timely medical care from available resources, are considered 
major medical threats.  Weapons or environmental conditions that produce qualitatively 
different wound or disease processes are also major medical threats.  Elements of medical 
threat are used to define the vulnerability of and the risk to deployed forces.  Medical 
threats from both environmental and adversary sources are shown below in Table 5.1.

5.2.2.  Casualty Prevention Measures.  The DMC must ensure that all of the following 
predeployment actions are accomplished prior to deployment:  
 
5.2.2.1.  Immunizations.  Immunizations are provided IAW AFJI 48-110, Immunizations 
and Chemoprophylaxis.  DOD is working to position sufficient quantities of vaccine to 
protect the force from suspected BW agents.  When vaccines are available to protect 
against a validated BW threat, it is DOD policy (DODD 6205.3, DOD Immunization 
Program for Biological Warfare Defense) that personnel will be immunized with 
sufficient time to develop immunity before deployment to threat areas.  [Ensure 
investigational new drug (IND) protocols are followed, if applicable.] 
 
5.2.2.2.  Chemoprophylaxis.  Chemoprophylaxis for some biological and chemical 
agents is available and will be issued at the time of deployment IAW theater policy or 
issued from bulk storage at forward deployed locations (see chapter 7, “Logistics”).  
Theater deployers must be trained prior to deployment on the proper use of these 
preventive measures.  Examples include nerve agent pretreatment, nerve agent antidote 
kits, and antibiotics.  [Ensure IND protocols are followed, if applicable.] 
 
5.2.2.3.  Medical Threat Briefing.  The MIO will brief deploying troops on the deployed 
medical threat including: environmental hazards, endemic diseases, hazardous insects, 
plants, and animals, NBC threat, and appropriate countermeasures.  MIO guidance is 
found in AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training.  Medical intelligence is 
available from many sources.  The primary source is the Armed Forces Medical 
Intelligence Center (AFMIC); however, the MIO should also acquire and be cognizant of 
current operational intelligence of the NBC threat at the deployment location.  The 
medical threat briefing should be provided sufficiently early (ideally at the concept 
briefing, and directly to the troops) to permit deploying troops to pack needed clothing 
and supplies and to take appropriate actions prior to deployments. 
 
5.2.2.4.  Medical NBC Defense Officer Briefing.  The Bioenvironmental Engineer 
(BEE) (or NCO) in the SRC or Command Post should provide information on medical 
aspects of the NBC threat and related passive defense measures at the deployment 
location.  The quantitative fit training (QNFT) of protective masks provides training to 
personnel deploying to medium and high NBC threat environments on the fit-factor 
protective levels and the best way to don their individual mask which gives them 
confidence that it fits properly.  Refer to AFMAN 32-4006, Nuclear, Biological, and 
Chemical (NBC) Mask Fit Liquid Hazard Simulant Training for procedural guidance for 
administering quantitative fit training (QNFT) using the M-41 Protection Assessment 
Test System (PATS).  Also important is the availability and capabilities of radiological, 
chemical and biological agent detectors in theater. 
 
5.2.2.5.  Predeployment Medical Questionnaire.  All deploying troops must be 
administered a predeployment medical questionnaire IAW CJCS Memo MCM 0006-02, 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
28
Updated Procedures for Deployment Health Surveillance and Readiness, to establish 
their predeployment health status baseline. 
 
5.3.  Deployment Actions.  The DMC/SMO should be intimately knowledgeable with the 
capabilities of the various medical UTCs assigned to the DMF and the local medical capabilities 
at the deployed location and the reachback capability provided by medical assets assigned to 
support the theater.  Reference Attachment 2 for a description of the NBC related UTC 
MISCAPS.  The DMC has specific passive defense responsibilities to ensure casualty prevention 
during all phases of deployment.  The deployment phase consists of pre-attack, trans-attack, and 
post-attack postures. 
 
5.4.  Deployment Phase: Pre-attack Casualty Prevention Measures. 
 
5.4.1.  Site Selection:  The DMC in conjunction with the Civil Engineer commander ensures 
optimal site selection and deployment of medical assets.  The DMC should consult the 
preventive medicine assets (i.e., PHO/PH technician, BEE, IDMT, flight surgeon, SME, etc.) 
as these people have the expertise and training in site selection.  The DMC must employ 
operational risk management techniques to balance the mission needs of patient movement 
against the threat of attack and contamination avoidance.  For example, move the CP 
EMEDS to a position that enables the deployed medical facility to stage patients for AE 
while negating potential casualty movement bottlenecks at non-CP MASFs.  Refer to 
AFPAM 10-219 Vol 5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning Guide, for specific considerations 
related to site selection. 
 
5.4.2.  Health Surveillance and DNBI Reporting:  The single most effective tool for 
identifying and targeting health hazards is a robust health surveillance and DNBI monitoring 
and reporting system.  The assigned medical team must develop a DNBI monitoring and 
reporting system that supports local as well as higher headquarters’ (AFFOR Surgeon) 
requirements.  The team must educate all providers on the importance of accurate reporting 
and follow-up.  This process is critical to health risk assessment and may produce the first 
indication of biological agent attack, particularly if no BW agent point detection systems are 
deployed. 
 
5.4.2.1.  The assigned medical personnel, IDMT, SME, or Prevention and Aerospace 
Medicine 
(PAM) 
team 
immediately 
upon 
arrival 
establishes 
a 
medical 
surveillance/reporting function to support early recognition and reporting of infectious 
disease events, including BW agents, and DNBI incidence.  A system available for this 
process is the Global Expeditionary Medical System (GEMS).  (See Figure 5.1.)  GEMS 
helps ensure medical surveillance, disease early warning, and reporting of medical 
information that may indicate covert BW agent attack to the wing commander, SRC, and 
theater surgeon.

5.4.2.2.  PAM team personnel should establish a surveillance plan to capture exposure 
data for occupational and environmental health hazards to deployed personnel using 
applicable reporting modules such as the Theater Occupational Model (TOM) module of 
GEMS.  This mechanism can also be employed to track personnel NBC exposures.  As in 
the occupational setting, most exposures will not result in a clinical outcome if personal 
protective and collective protective measures are employed or the exposure is at a level 
below that causing recognizable acute symptoms.  This fact makes retrospective analysis 
of NBC attacks or other environmental exposures for long-term health effects difficult if 
not impossible as no record of exposure exists in the clinical encounter based medical 
record. 
 
 
5.4.3.  Vulnerability Assessments and Surveillance Plans. 
 
5.4.3.1.  Medical NBC Vulnerability Assessments.  Deployed forces must have clean 
air and water, and safe food in order to carry out their assigned missions.  Air, water, and 
food are highly vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional contamination from 
human activities, including contamination with NBC agents and toxic industrial 
chemicals/materials (TICs/TIMs). 
 
The Global Expeditionary Medical System (GEMS) 
 
GEMS is a suite of tools to provide Air Force-wide medical force protection through 
standardized medical surveillance, analysis, and C2.  GEMS components include: 
 
-- A Patient Encounter Module (PEM) provides a standard electronic medical record for 
worldwide patient expeditionary surveillance and rearward connectivity. 
 
-- A Theater Epidemiology Module (TEM) aggregates field medical data, monitors 
deployed troops for BW/epidemic events, and provides theater medical C2 capability. 
 
-- Algorithms produce disease epidemiology reports as indicators of potential BW attack.  
Personnel may modify these algorithms to meet local requirements. 
 
-- A Theater Occupational Module (TOM) designed to monitor and track complex endemic 
and environmental concerns in the deployed setting. 
 
-- Force-wide, command-level, data analysis of deployed medical occurrences is archived 
at Brooks AFB, Texas. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002

5.4.3.1.1.  The vulnerability assessment begins with the site survey and continues 
throughout the deployment phase to redeployment.  Careful documentation and 
resolution of vulnerabilities are critical to protecting the health of the deployed force 
and resolving postdeployment health concerns. 
 
5.4.3.1.2.  The vulnerability assessment must address intentional and unintentional 
man-made, as well as natural, exposures.  PAM teams conduct, maintain and 
continuously update the vulnerability assessment.  Additionally, the PAM team 
conducts ongoing assessments of food, water, air, and other potential 
occupational/environmental exposures that could impact the health of the deployed 
population.  With this information, a local commander can have an impact on the four 
phases of food and water systems—procurement sources, transportation/distribution 
systems, preparation, and storage. 
 
5.4.3.1.3.  The DMC should conduct a risk-based assessment consisting of identifying 
potential threats and performing an ongoing analysis of vulnerabilities in the 
deployment area.  A medical force health protection assessment fuses intelligence 
from human (HUMINT), signals (SIGINT), imagery (IMINT), and measurement and 
signature (MASINT) sources.  Counterintelligence, environmental, medical, 
information, and threat data, and additional information sources assist in developing a 
cohesive threat picture helpful to force protection decision makers. 
 
5.4.3.2.  Food and Water Vulnerability.  Commanders should assess the specific threat 
of conventional as well as intentional contamination to their food and water using 
available intelligence sources.  This assessment should be a part of a focused analysis of 
the unit’s vulnerability and potential mitigation measures.  The assessment should be 
conducted initially and the results reviewed as frequently as the unit’s mission and theater 
of operations dictate.  The results of this assessment should be used to determine 
emergency food and water supplies needed by the installation. 
 
5.4.3.2.1.  It is unreasonable to assume that current food and water protective 
measures in the deployment theater are adequate.  Food and water safety, in addition 
to security, should be implemented jointly by Medical, Security Forces, Services, 
Civil Engineer, Transportation, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), 
Intelligence, and Contracting personnel.  The results from vulnerability assessments 
warrant critical review by local and theater leadership, prioritized planning for 
mitigation, and systematic implementation.  This institutionalized process will best 
ensure improved safety and security of food supplies for consumption by Air Force 
personnel.  (Attachment 3 contains Table A3.1, Threat Potential of BW Agents to 
Drinking Water and Table A3.2, Effects of Certain Agents on the Appearance of 
Food.)  Refer to AFI 10-245 Air Force Antiterrorism(AT) Standards for additional 
guidance. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
31
 
5.4.3.2.2.  Roles and responsibilities are: 
 
5.4.3.2.2.1.  Installation Commander.  The installation commander should direct 
the overall food and water safety and security program and appoint a food and 
water safety and security assessment team. 
 
5.4.3.2.2.2.  Deployed Medical Commander.  The DMC is responsible for the 
medical aspects of food and water protection throughout the chain of production 
or procurement and for establishing an ongoing food and water monitoring 
program during deployment.  The DMC, or his/her representative, is a member of 
the installation food and water safety and security assessment team.  The 
vulnerability of the food and water system to intentional contamination should 
also be considered when developing a food and water safety surveillance plan.  
The DMC appoints the public health officer (PHO) and Bioenvironmental 
Engineer (BEE), as a minimum to the assessment team.  In the absence of a PHO 
or BEE, an IDMT or SME may be appointed.  The DMC reports any suspected 
outbreaks of foodborne or waterborne contamination through Service and joint 
command and control structures.  The DMC, through the PHO and BEE, is 
responsible for the inspections of stored food and water supplies to include 
inspection of food service facilities, prepared foods, and water.  In addition, food 
and water supplies, including local water bottling facilities, should be inspected 
for signs of tampering and contamination. 
 
5.4.3.2.2.3.  Contracting Officer.  The contracting officer should incorporate 
safety and security measures in contracting instruments for food and water 
supplies.  These measures are in addition to standard food and water safety 
requirements, directed in Air Force and DOD directives.  The specific measures 
taken should be determined from assessment processes addressed in food and 
water force protection guidance documents. 
 
5.4.3.2.2.4.  Transportation Commander.  The transportation commander 
should ensure all transportation sources are aware of requirements for shipment, 
manifest, and container security. 
 
5.4.3.2.2.5.  Security Forces Commander.  The security forces commander 
should be responsible for ensuring the security of all shipments upon arrival at the 
installation and at a minimum, should inspect for intact seals and locks, should 
review manifests for accuracy, should review driver documentation for accuracy, 
should notify food service personnel of the arrival of food and water shipments, 
and should notify CE of the arrival of bulk potable and nonpotable water supplies.  
Physical security (a preventive measure) is the preferred mitigation option.   
 
5.4.3.2.2.6.  Services Commander.  The services commander should ensure 
adequate precautions such as controlling access to food facilities, employee 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
32
identification and background checks, physical security measures and ensuring 
employees are properly trained in all aspects of food security.   
 
5.4.3.2.2.7.  Civil Engineer.  In conjunction with the BEE, CE should ensure 
safety and security of bulk water supplies (e.g., wells, reservoirs, lakes, etc.) in 
addition to standard sanitation requirements. 
 
5.4.3.2.2.8.  AFOSI and Intelligence.  AFOSI and Intelligence resources should 
maintain the capability to determine and validate intentional contamination threats 
to installation food and water supplies.  
 
5.4.3.2.2.9.  All Unit Commanders.  All unit commanders should maintain the 
capability to ensure the safety and security of food and water supplies by being 
aware of the specific vulnerabilities in their locations, ensuring unit personnel 
inspect food and water supplies prior to consumption and report all suspect 
supplies. 
 
5.4.3.2.3.  The principles of prevention, surveillance, control, and response for 
naturally occurring food/waterborne illnesses should also apply to some extent for 
mitigating the effects on intentional contamination.  Deployed forces must have clean 
air, water, and safe food in order to carry out their assigned missions; and depending 
on the location of the installation, some food and water assets may be more critical 
than others.  The DMC is referred to the Force Protection Battlelab, Commanders 
Guide to Food and Water Systems Force Protection for further guidance. 
 
5.4.3.3.  Vector Surveillance.  Deployed medical assets will conduct appropriate 
surveillance of vectors of medical importance to include insects, rodents, and animals 
capable of transmitting diseases in man.  The first deployed asset possessing this 
capability is the PAM team.  Refer to US Army FM 21-10, Field Hygiene and Sanitation, 
for additional guidance on disease vectors and personal protective measures. 
 
5.4.4.  In-processing Deploying Service Members.  The PAM team, the SME, or the 
deployed IDMT, accomplishes the following tasks: 
 
5.4.4.1.  Ensures that all medical force health protection measures are accomplished. 
 
5.4.4.2.  Reviews force health protection measures required for the area of responsibility 
(AOR) that were accomplished during the predeployment phase and corrects any 
deficiencies identified. 
 
5.4.4.3.  Collects DD Form 2766, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flow Sheet, or 
equivalent (deployed Medical Record) from all members. 
 
5.4.4.4.  Provides an updated site-specific medical threat briefing and medical aspects of 
ATSO training. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
33
 
5.4.5.  Field Sanitation and Hygiene.  Strict adherence to field sanitation and hygiene 
measures minimize DNBI and spread of NBC agents or materials.  US Army FM 21-10, 
Field Hygiene and Sanitation, provides specific guidance on this subject.  This task will 
typically be accomplished by the PAM team but may also be accomplished by a SME or 
IDMT as required. 
 
5.4.6.  Collective Protection:  Collectively protected assets are prepositioned in NBC high-
threat areas.  The smallest collectively protected capability is the CP EMEDS Basic.  The 
DMC may not have in-place or deployed CP and must plan accordingly for decontamination 
or alternate facilities if their non-CP DMFs are contaminated and become nonfunctional.  
The DMC must coordinate these requirements with the deployed AETF and document the 
requirements in the site Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP) or other deliberate 
plans. 
 
5.4.7.  Individual Protective Equipment (IPE).  All deployed medical personnel must be 
intimately familiar with MOPP levels and donning the Individual Protective Equipment 
(IPE).  The deployed medical facility personnel will follow [deployed] wing procedures for 
donning and doffing IPE.  The MOPP levels for the installation or sectors (if used) are 
determined by the senior Air Force commander and communicated to the base population 
and to each unit control center (UCC).  The deployed medical facility area of responsibility 
may be designated as an individual sector when the senior Air Force commander delegates 
MOPP reduction authority to the DMC or SMO.   
 
5.4.8.  Medical Sector NBC Detection and Contamination Control Plan.  The base will 
most likely be divided into NBC sectors and the deployed medical facility will be responsible 
for NBC detection and contamination control within their sector (refer to AFMAN 10-2602 
[Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and 
Standards).  Normally, the medical sector is limited to the medical area of responsibility in 
the immediate area surrounding medical facility and facilities.  In accordance with the Law 
of Armed Conflict, medical organizations may not be assigned responsibility for an area or 
sector that includes non-medical missions or capabilities or contains activities that are 
inconsistent with the non-combatant status of medical forces.  Key to casualty prevention in 
an NBC environment is preventing the spread of post-attack NBC agents or materials.  
Essential components include detection, marking, communication, avoidance, and 
decontamination. 
 
5.4.8.1.  The DMC will develop and employ a NBC Detection Plan at the direction of CE 
Readiness.  The BEE NBC team or other preventive medicine assets will assist.  In 
addition to the M8/M9 Paper capability that all base units possess, the medical unit may 
have more robust capabilities for detection to include vapor phase detection of CW 
agents, DOD sampling tickets for detection of BW agents, polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) for identification of BW agents, and radiological measurement capability, 
depending on deployed UTC laydown. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
34
5.4.8.2.  A biological agent attack may be covert or not detected by employed point 
detectors.  The detection of BW agents requires healthcare provider awareness of clinical 
symptoms associated with various BW agents.  In addition, a robust DNBI surveillance 
system performing real-time monitoring with seamless data reporting is necessary to 
detect a BW attack.  Table A3.1 identifies possible biological agents threat potential to 
drinking water and the duration of impact. 
 
5.4.8.3.  The CW Detection Plan must address reporting to the base NBC Defense Cell 
and marking of any known areas of contamination (refer to AFI 10-206, Operational 
Reporting).  Detailed procedures for sector monitoring are found in AFMAN 32-4005, 
Personnel Protection and Attack Actions; and AFH 32-4014, Vol 4, USAF Ability to 
Survive and Operate Procedures in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) 
Environment [will be replaced by AFMAN 10-2602 [Draft], Nuclear, Biological, 
Chemical, and Conventional Defense Operations and Standards]. 
 
5.5.  Deployment Phase: Trans-attack Casualty Prevention Measures.  The DMC is 
responsible for the safety of medical personnel.  Operations conducted will be consistent with the 
procedures specified in AFH 32-4014, Vol 4, USAF Ability to Survive and Operate Procedures 
in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Environment [will be replaced by AFMAN 10-
2502 [Draft], WMD Threat Planning and Response Handbook]. Casualties can be minimized 
through proper education of personnel on local alarm conditions, donning the IPE, understanding 
MOPP levels, operation of CP systems, and adherence to ATSO principles for an NBC 
environment.  The deployed medical assets cannot provide passive defense and treat NBC 
casualties if they themselves fall victim to an NBC attack. 
 
5.6.  Deployment Phase: Post-attack Casualty Prevention Measures. 
 
5.6.1.  The DMC is responsible for NBC surveillance for health risk assessment and 
treatment.  This surveillance quantifies NBC exposure data to determine personnel’s short- 
and long-term health risk in executing the mission in contaminated environments.  It also 
includes identification of NBC agents or materials, either through clinical samples and 
diagnosis, or environmental sampling.  The DMC is also responsible for detection of NBC 
agents or materials within the medical sector (only) and in the base drinking water and food 
supplies.  Detection provides the general information necessary to facilitate operations while 
identification provides the specific information necessary for a tailored medical response and 
health surveillance. 
 
5.6.2.  Detection generally refers to determining the presence of a class of agents (G-series 
nerve agents, for example) and its relative abundance.  This also applies in biological agent 
detection where hand-held bioassays employed may not have the sensitivity to reliably detect 
and identify BW agents. 
 
5.6.3.  Identification refers to determining the specific NBC agent employed.  Identification 
in the form of clinical diagnoses may be the first indication of a covert attack using biological 
agents.  This distinction becomes important in the response to biological agent incidents 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
35
since presentation in the clinical setting and diagnostics may occur after a prolonged 
incubation period following release.  Rapid recognition and identification using deployed 
health surveillance and advanced NBC agent analytical tools—such as the GEMS and 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based pathogen identification—vastly improves medical 
and commander situational awareness to NBC attacks. 
 
5.6.4.  Contamination Avoidance. 
 
5.6.4.1.  Medical Sector Detection, Marking, and Reporting.  When directed by the 
SRC, the deployed medical unit immediately after the attack will conduct sector 
reconnaissance for NBC hazards as well as conventional munitions damage, and report 
this information to the SRC by means of the medical control center (MCC).  Refer to 
AFMAN 10-2602 [Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) 
Defense Operations and Standards for post attack reconnaissance, marking, and reporting 
procedures.  Initial medical NBC detection capability is limited to chemical agent 
detection in the form of M8 and M9 Paper that is contained in the individual’s C-bag.  
Upon arrival of the PAM team, the chemical detection capability is augmented with 
M256A1 and M272 detection kits (vapor and water).  This capability will be 
supplemented with the arrival of the BNBC (to be superseded by medical NBC [MNBC]) 
team that possesses more advanced chemical detection (chemical agent monitoring 
system [CAMS]), biological agent detection (hand-held bioassays), and radiological 
measurement (ADM300).  The medical unit will report the results of this survey as soon 
as possible to the SRC. 
 
5.6.4.2.  Basewide Surveillance.  As soon as operationally feasible, the DMC will 
resume health surveillance and reporting activities of food, water, NBC exposures, 
vectors, environmental, and DNBIs using applicable reporting modules such as GEMS. 
 
5.6.4.3.  Basewide Agent Identification.  Once an NBC event has occurred, the DMC 
should continue to execute detection and ensure rapid identification for medical treatment 
and recording of personnel exposures.  Environmental samples of contaminated media 
are collected by the BNBC team and transported for analysis.  
 
5.6.4.3.1.  Identification of the specific agent may require several instruments and 
further analysis.  For biological pathogens, deployed BAT teams can conduct 
expedient presumptive agent identification.  There are additional capabilities within 
specific theaters of operations.  For example, the biological warfare defense 
laboratory (BWDL) at Osan AB provides capability designed for and specific to the 
operation of the PORTAL SHIELD biological warfare detection system.  Sister 
Service laboratories deployed to the theater (e.g., the 520th Theater Army Medical 
Laboratory [TAML]) may be used to provide additional quantitative analyses.  
Definitive identification of biological warfare agents is accomplished at USAMRIID. 
 
5.6.4.3.2.  Definitive identification of specific chemical and radiological agents and 
contamination levels—particularly low-levels—must be accomplished using

theaterwide assets or reach-back laboratories, to include the capabilities of the other 
Services.  These capabilities exist within the Air Force Radiation Assessment Team 
(AFRAT) for radiological contaminants (FFRA 1/2/3).  Other assets that may be 
available in the theater of operations include the 520th TAML, the Navy Forward 
Deployed Laboratory (NFDL), Navy Environmental Preventive Medicine Unit 
(NEPMU) assets, or labs in the continental United States (CONUS). 
 
5.6.5  Protection. 
 
5.6.5.1.  The DMC provides technical medical information and advice to the SRC 
including information on physiological and psychological effects of contamination.  The 
DMC advises the commander on the administration and use of chemical or biological 
agent pretreatment drugs, prophylaxis medications, and antidotes.  The DMC advises 
mortuary affairs on concerns regarding handling and disposition of contaminated 
remains. 
 
5.6.5.2.  Enforcing sanitation, hygiene, and infection control is a leadership 
responsibility. Following a biological agent attack, the DMC should stress the importance 
of good infection control practices within the DMF and base-wide line commanders 
should stress the importance of field sanitation and hygiene measures to minimize cross 
contamination.  Washing with soap and water is the most effective and simplest measure 
for controlling communicable disease.  Of the potential BW agents, only plague and 
smallpox are readily spread person-to-person by aerosol and require more than standard 
infection control precautions (gown, mask with eye shield, gloves). 
 
5.6.6.  Contamination Control. 
 
5.6.6.1.  The DMC is responsible for medical decontamination of patients and deployed 
medical facility resources within the medical sector.  Upon arrival, the Wartime Medical 
Decontamination Team (WMDT) provides this capability.  In the absence of the WMDT, 
the DMC may organize and train an ad hoc team of available personnel if medical patient 
decontamination is tactically necessary, using line and/or medical personnel and materiel.  
(Refer to AFMS CONOPS for WMDT decontamination procedures.) 
 
5.6.6.2.  Movement between sectors is controlled by the base sectoring plan.  The 
deployed medical facility is responsible for contamination control within its sector.  DMF 
personnel contaminated pursuant to their duties will process through the medical 
facility’s ambulatory decontamination line. 
 
5.6.6.3.  PAM/BEE NBC teams will advise the SRC on appropriate decontamination and 
treatment techniques for food and water contaminated with NBC agents or materials. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002

5.7.  Post Deployment Actions. 
 
5.7.1.  The DMC needs to continue the ongoing health surveillance program.  Performing 
postdeployment health assessments (DD Form 2796) ensures exposures are documented; 
ensures follow up of exposures and treatment; and ensures the deployed medical record 
returns with the individual.  Documentation of NBC exposures, medical interventions, and 
use of prophylaxis and antidotes in the individual’s deployed medical record is critical. 
 
5.7.2.  The provider (IDMT, SME, or PAM team member) administers this assessment to all 
redeploying personnel within 5 days of redeployment. 
 
5.7.3.  Up-channel surveillance data to the DOD central data repository as specified in Joint 
Policy Memorandum on Deployed Occupational Health and Environmental Health 
Surveillance.

CASUALTY CARE AND MANAGEMENT 
 
6.1.  Overview.  This chapter gives a general overview of procedures and references for NBC 
casualty 
management, 
combat 
stress 
management 
in 
NBC 
environments, 
patient 
decontamination, patient movement, and patient evacuation.  (A description of medical 
capability available at each level of care can be found in AFTTP 3-42.7, Aerospace Medical 
Contingency Ground Support System.) 
 
6.2.  Casualty Care and Management in NBC Environments.  The deployed medical facility 
should be able to provide, or arrange for the provision of, the following patient care services in 
an NBC threat environment: (Refer to AFMS CONOPS,  Wartime Medical Decontamination 
Team.) 
 
6.2.1.  Protect medical personnel and patients against exposure to or contamination by NBC 
agents or materials. 
 
6.2.2.  Provide basic life- and limb-saving care to casualties while in an NBC-contaminated 
environment, prior to and during the decontamination process. 
 
6.2.3.  Decontaminate arriving casualties and medical staff. 
 
6.2.4.  Treat casualties from initial resuscitation through definitive care or evacuation. 
 
6.2.5.  Evacuate (intratheater/intertheater) decontaminated casualties suffering the effects of 
radiological, biological, or chemical agents, provide appropriate care en route, and prevent 
spread of contamination during the evacuation process. 
 
6.2.6.  Track and follow-up medical care of personnel exposed to NBC contamination. 
 
6.2.7.  Provide prophylactic measures, such as immunizations and medications, to all 
supported personnel in the threat area. 
 
6.2.8.  Conduct medical surveillance to determine if a biological agent is in use in the area. 
 
6.2.9.  Initiate treatment of nuclear event casualties, including treatment of blast injury, burn 
injury, and injury from ionizing radiation. 
 
6.2.10.  Initiate treatment of internally contaminated radiological casualties within 6 hours of 
arrival at a Level 3 or higher medical facility. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002

6.3.  Triage of Suspected Contaminated Casualties (Mixed Casualties). 
 
6.3.1.  The purpose of triage is to mitigate the effects of an NBC event and to effectively 
allocate medical resources.  Triage will be based on conventional injuries and NBC exposure 
(agent type, physical state, route of exposure, and severity of exposure).  Triage occurs at 
three specific points in time—decontamination, treatment, and evacuation.  However, it is an 
on-going process that requires continuous reevaluation of the patient throughout treatment 
and evacuation.  Patients who appear stable may later deteriorate.  Patients with life- or limb-
threatening conditions will receive immediate emergency medical treatment before 
decontamination.  (Refer to JP 3-11, Joint Doctrine for Operations in Nuclear, Biological 
and Chemical [NBC] Environments.) 
 
6.3.2.  A discussion of triage categories and first aid for chemical, nuclear, and biological 
agents can be found in US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense 
(USAMRICD), Medical Management of Chemical Casualties Handbook, Armed Forces 
Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), Medical Management of Radiological Casualties, 
and USAMRIID, Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook.  A general 
discussion of triage categories is included in attachment 4. 
 
6.4.  Medical Decontamination. 
 
6.4.1.  The purpose of decontamination is to remove external contamination to prevent 
further injury to the patient, or contamination of medical personnel, other patients, or medical 
assets.  Medical treatment of casualties is difficult in protective equipment.  Definitive 
medical care will require the patient to first be decontaminated and to receive treatment in a 
collectively protected or uncontaminated facility.  For detailed decontamination 
procedures, refer to the AFMS CONOPS, Wartime Medical Decontamination Team, or US 
Army FM 8-10-7, Health Service Support in NBC Environments. 
 
6.4.2.  Decontamination starts with self-aid and buddy care.  Priority in decontamination 
should be given to physical removal of the agent as rapidly as possible.  This is accomplished 
by first removing the patient from further exposure to the agent, then removal of the agent 
from the patient.  Spot decontamination should be immediately applied to areas of liquid 
contamination.  This should be followed by thorough decontamination as soon as possible.  
Although skin decontamination is not generally necessary after exposure to vapor alone, 
clothing should be removed because it may contain trapped vapor.  The skin should be 
thoroughly cleaned using soap and water or other approved skin decontamination solutions, 
following clothing removal. 
 
6.4.3.  Medical units must be prepared to accept contaminated casualties.  Ideally, casualties 
should be decontaminated to the greatest extent possible in the field during the SABC 
process.  However, some individuals may arrive at the deployed medical facility that have 
not been decontaminated, are still partially contaminated, or that have become contaminated 
en route.  These individuals must be decontaminated before they are admitted to prevent 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
40
further injury to the patient and prevent contamination of medical personnel, other patients, 
or the DMF. 
 
6.4.4.  The deployed medical facility will provide emergency life- and limb-saving medical 
treatment to casualties prior to and during the decontamination process.  Care provided to 
contaminated casualties may include airway management, assisted ventilation, control of 
hemorrhage and shock, and medication administration.  Available medical resources will 
determine the scope of care provided to casualties awaiting decontamination.  As a 
minimum, Basic Life Support will be provided.  Deployed medical commanders are 
responsible for allocating treatment resources to support medical management of 
contaminated, as well as uncontaminated and decontaminated casualties. 
 
6.4.5.  At the deployed medical facility entry control point, arriving casualties will be 
monitored for contamination.  Contaminated casualties will be sent to a medical 
decontamination area where they will be triaged, treated for life- and limb-threatening 
conditions, and decontaminated as soon as possible.  Non-contaminated casualties will be 
sent directly to the treatment area.  (See Figure 6.1.)  All patients arriving at the treatment 
location (decontaminated and originally uncontaminated) will be re-triaged prior to entry into 
the definitive care area.  (See paragraph 6.3, “Triage of Suspected Contaminated Casualties 
(Mixed Casualties).”)  Ambulatory personnel with no significant symptoms should process 
through standard Contamination Control Areas whenever practical for decontamination.

6.4.6.  Ideally, the Wartime Medical Decontamination Team (WMDT) UTC FFGLA/FFGLB 
will be provided.  Bedded deployed medical facilities (fixed sites, EMEDS + 10 and larger 
deployable assemblages), should be assigned WMDT assets in high NBC threat 
environments.  Smaller medical units such as air transportable clinics, IDMT clinics, and 
small portable expeditionary aeromedical rapid response (SPEARR) teams will generally not 
have WMDT teams collocated.  EMEDS Basic units may or may not have an assigned 
WMDT.  If a dedicated medical decontamination team is not available, augmentation 
personnel will be identified and trained.  Preplanning for this scenario is vital.  The senior 
medical officer must work through the line commander to obtain sufficient personnel and 
decontamination materiel of opportunity. 
 
6.5.  Patient Treatment. 
 
6.5.1.  Chemical Event.  Basic principles of emergency medical care are the same for all 
chemical agents—airway, breathing, circulation, drugs (appropriate therapeutic intervention), 
and decontamination (ABCDD).  Supportive therapy must also be provided.  Refer to 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
42
AFJMAN 44-149, Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties and Conventional Military 
Chemical Injuries; USAMRICD, Medical Management of Chemical Casualties Handbook; 
and the Textbook of Military Medicine for specific procedures for treatment and management 
of chemical agent casualties. 
 
6.5.1.1.  Nerve Agents.  Three drugs are used to treat nerve agent exposure—atropine,  
pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl.), and diazepam.  The Mark I autoinjector includes a 2 
mg atropine injector and 600 mg of 2-PAM Cl in a second injector.  Individuals with 
mild symptoms of nerve agent exposure should receive one Mark I injector.  One to two 
additional doses should be given at 5-minute intervals if symptoms persist.  Patients with 
severe symptoms (involvement of two or more organ systems) should receive 3 
autoinjectors immediately, followed by diazepam injection.  Medical personnel may need 
to administer additional atropine and diazepam.  Pyridostigmine bromide (P-tabs) may be 
used as a pretreatment prior to nerve agent exposure.  It is not an antidote.  Issue or use of 
P-tabs requires approval at the Secretary of Defense level.  Mark I antidote kit treatment 
will still be required following actual nerve agent exposure. 
 
6.5.1.2.  Vesicants (Blister Agents).  Treatment for vesicant exposure is symptomatic, 
based on site of injury.  Vesicants predominantly affect the skin, eyes, and respiratory 
tract.  Severe vesicant exposure can also affect the gastrointestinal and immune systems.  
Treatment of skin and eye injuries is similar to that for other thermal or chemical burns, 
except less aggressive intravenous (IV) fluid replacement is typically needed.  Symptoms 
may be delayed following exposure to vesicants.  Respiratory distress may occur in 
otherwise healthy individuals several hours following exposure. 
 
6.5.1.3.  Cyanides (Blood Agents).  Cyanides inhibit cellular utilization of oxygen.  Mild 
exposures may be treated with oxygen and supportive therapy.  Exposure to cyanides 
agents may result in immediate death.  Severe exposure will likely require mechanical 
ventilation, oxygenation, circulatory support, correction of metabolic acidosis, and 
seizure control as well as specific antidotal therapy.  Antidotal therapy is provided in a 
two-step process.  First, a methemoglobin forming agent such as inhaled amyl nitrite or 
intravenous sodium nitrite should be administered.  This is followed by sodium 
thiosulfate 
administered 
intravenously. 
 
Methemoglobin 
forming 
agents 
are 
contraindicated in smoke inhalation patients with high carboxyhemoglobin levels.  These 
patients should be treated with sodium thiosulfate and oxygen alone.   
 
6.5.1.4.  Pulmonary, Incapacitating, and Riot-control Agents.  Treatment is specified 
in AFJMAN 44-149, Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties and Conventional Military 
Chemical Injuries; USAMRICD, Medical Management of Chemical Casualties 
Handbook; and the Textbook of Military Medicine. 
 
6.5.2.  Biological Event.  Key treatment issues are addressed below for different types of 
biological casualties.  Detailed treatment information for biological casualties is found in 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
43
AFMAN (I) 44-156, Treatment of Biological Warfare Agent Casualties and USAMRIID, 
Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook. 
 
6.5.2.1.  Anthrax.  Anthrax is a known potential biological weapon.  The causative agent 
is Bacillus anthracis.  Exposure can occur through inhalation, ingestion, or skin 
absorption.  An FDA-licensed vaccine is available.  Personnel should be vaccinated IAW 
current Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program (AVIP) guidelines.  Ciprofloxacin and 
doxycycline antibiotics can be used for exposure or prophylaxis.  Anthrax is not 
contagious and isolation is not necessary. 
 
6.5.2.2.  Plague.  Plague can be transmitted by infected fleas (bubonic) or person-to-
person (pneumonic) through respiratory droplets.  The causative agent is Yersenia pestis.  
Pneumonic plague is a highly contagious disease and droplet precautions are necessary.  
Effective field sanitation and preventive medicine measures are required to minimize 
bubonic plague transmission.  As a general practice, plague patients should be transported 
only with other plague patients during aeromedical evacuation.  Plague prophylaxis is 
accomplished with doxycycline (preferred) and ciprofloxacin (may also be effective).  
Early administration of antibiotics and supportive therapy is very effective.  However, 
pneumonic plague is 95% fatal if the disease is not treated within 48 hours of symptom 
onset.  Streptomycin is the drug of choice for treatment.  Gentamicin, cyprofloxacin, and 
doxycycline are also effective.  There is no licensed vaccine for pneumonic plague. 
 
6.5.2.3.  Tularemia.  Tularemia (also known as rabbit fever and deer fly fever) is a 
zoonotic disease.  Humans typically acquire infection through contact of their skin or 
mucous membranes with tissues or body fluids of infected animals, or from bites of 
infected deerflies, mosquitoes, or ticks.  Francisella tularensis can remain viable weeks 
in water, soil, carcasses, and hides.  It is resistant to sub-freezing temperatures for several 
months.  It is easily killed by heat and disinfectants.  The primary threat is by aerosol 
release.  Contamination of food or water supply is also possible. 
 
6.5.2.3.1.  Preexposure prophylaxis is provided by a live attenuated vaccine 
available as an IND.  Postexposure prophylaxis, following a BW attack includes 
doxycycline, tetracycline, or ciprofloxacin. 
 
6.5.2.3.2.  Supportive care may include respiratory support and hydration.  Open 
lesions should be covered and topical antibiotics applied.  Tularemia may be treated 
with streptomycin, gentamicin, or ciprofloxacin.  Fatality rate for inhalation tularensis 
is unknown. 
 
6.5.2.3.3.  Control of infection is through the application of standard precautions.  
Tularemia is not communicable person to person.  Patients may be evacuated 
observing Standard Precautions during evacuation. 
 
6.5.2.4.  Q-Fever.  The endemic form of Q-fever is a zoonotic disease caused by a 
rickettsia, Coxiella burnetii.  Natural reservoirs are sheep, cattle, and goats.  The 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
44
organisms grow to especially high concentrations in placental tissues.  Exposure to 
infected animals at parturition is an important risk factor for endemic disease.  The 
organisms are also excreted in animal milk, urine, and feces.  Humans acquire the disease 
by inhalation of aerosols contaminated with the organisms.  Heavy environmental 
contamination with C. burnetii could pose a long-term risk due to environmental 
persistence.  Dusts generated from the contaminated environment may continue to 
transmit the disease. 
 
6.5.2.4.1.  Preexposure Prophylaxis.  A formalin-inactivated whole cell vaccine is 
available as an IND for immunization of at-risk personnel.  
 
6.5.2.4.2.  Postexposure Prophylaxis.  Postexposure prophylaxis is accomplished 
with tetracycline or doxycycline.  Antibiotics given prophylactically after exposure 
may delay but not prevent the onset of symptoms. 
 
6.5.2.4.3.  Medical Management.  Medical management is with doxycycline or 
tetracycline.  Treat patients who are unable to take tetracycline with ciprofloxacin or 
other quinolones. 
 
6.5.2.4.4.  Infection Control.  Q-fever is not communicable person to person.  
Patients exposed to Q-fever by aerosol do not present a risk for secondary 
contamination or re-aerosolization of the organism.  Observe standard precautions 
when handling patients. 
 
6.5.2.4.5.  Decontamination.  Exposed clothing and equipment should be 
decontaminated.  Decontamination is accomplished with soap and water, 5% 
microchem plus (quaternary ammonium compound), 70% ethyl alcohol, or 0.5% 
hypochlorite solution. 
 
6.5.2.4.6.  Aeromedical Evacuation.  Patients may be evacuated with other classes 
of patients. 
 
6.5.2.5.  Smallpox.  Variola virus causes smallpox.  It is a member of the Orthopox virus 
family and is very contagious to humans.  Despite the global eradication of smallpox and 
continued availability of a vaccine, the potential weaponization of Variola continues to 
pose a military threat.  Humans are the only natural reservoir of Variola.  Transmission 
usually occurs by respiratory droplet, following close face-to-face contact.  Smallpox is 
also transmitted by direct contact with skin lesions or drainage, or with contaminated 
objects. 
 
6.5.2.5.1.  Preexposure Prophylaxis.  US forces are no longer routinely immunized.  
When the threat indicates, senior leadership may direct vaccination of personnel, 
pending vaccine availability. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
45
6.5.2.5.2.  Postexposure Prophylaxis.  All individuals exposed to or suspected of 
being exposed to smallpox BW agents should have active immunization.  Contacts 
should be vaccinated, or receive booster vaccinations as soon as possible, optimally 
within 24 hours. 
 
6.5.2.5.3.  Medical Management.  Provide supportive care since there is no specific 
antiviral therapy available for smallpox. 
 
6.5.2.5.4.  Infection Control.  Strict (standard, contact, and airborne) isolation and 
quarantine of all patients must be maintained until scabs have separated. 
 
6.5.2.5.5.  Aeromedical Evacuation.  Smallpox is an internationally quarantinable 
disease (IQD).  Apply strict quarantine measures.  Isolate and evacuate all smallpox 
patients with other smallpox patients only.  Evacuation of smallpox patients across 
national boundaries requires close coordination between the supported and supporting 
combatant commanders and the Department of State.  See paragraph 6.5.5, 
“Quarantine and Isolation.” 
 
6.5.2.6.  Toxins. 
 
6.5.2.6.1.  Clostridium botulinum Toxin.  Botulinum toxins are a group of proteins 
produced by the bacillus Clostridium botulinum.  There are seven distinct but related 
neurotoxins, A through G, produced by different strains of the clostridial bacillus.  
All seven types act by similar mechanisms.  The toxins produce similar effects when 
inhaled or ingested.  The time course may vary depending on the route of exposure 
and the dose received.  Covert contamination of water supplies by botulism toxin 
should be addressed.  Although an aerosol attack is by far the most likely scenario, 
enemy special forces or terrorists might use this agent to produce foodborne botulism 
in those so targeted.  The reservoir is soil, animals, and fish.  High-risk foods are 
primarily improperly canned foods and dried meat or fish.  Transmission is via the 
consumption of food contaminated with the C. botulinum toxin. 
 
6.5.2.6.1.1.  Pre-exposure Prophylaxis.  A pentavalent toxoid of Clostridium 
botulinum toxin types A, B, C, D, and E is available under an IND status.  
 
6.5.2.6.1.2.  Postexposure Prophylaxis.  Currently, postexposure prophylaxis is 
not available.  Animal experiments demonstrate that botulinum antitoxin is 
effective; however, human data or practice guidelines are not available.  
Botulinum antitoxin should be considered in extraordinary circumstances. 
 
6.5.2.6.1.3.  Medical Management.  Supportive care includes respiratory 
support, hydration, bowel, bladder and skin care, nasogastric suctioning for ileus, 
physical therapy, and psychological support. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
46
6.5.2.6.1.4.  Antitoxin.  Administration of antitoxin is reasonable if disease has 
not progressed to a stable state.  A trivalent equine antitoxin has been available 
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for cases of foodborne 
botulism. 
 
6.5.2.6.1.5.  Contamination Control and Aeromedical Evacuation.  Botulism 
is not communicable person to person.  Patients may be evacuated with other 
classes of patients.  Observe standard precautions for evacuation. 
 
6.5.3.  Radiation Exposure Event. 
 
6.5.3.1.  Patients who are contaminated with radiological material should be 
decontaminated by removal of surface contaminants.  This should be accomplished by 
clothing removal and skin washing with soap and water.  As with biological and chemical 
agents, do not delay emergency medical treatment for radiologically contaminated 
casualties.  Once decontaminated, a patient is not “radioactive.”  However, patients 
suffering from radiological exposure may require reverse/barrier isolation due to bone 
marrow suppression and a compromised immune system.  As a minimum, this should 
include gloves, masks, and strict hand washing at all levels of care.  Systemic exposure 
may affect the bone marrow, gastrointestinal system, cardiovascular system, skin, and the 
central nervous system.  Radiation injuries, including systemic exposures, will require 
supportive care at all levels of care.  Once patients are decontaminated externally, the 
potential for cross-contamination to uncontaminated areas and personnel is minimal.  
Supportive care includes airway management, fluid administration with volume 
expanders, antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications, and aggressive therapeutic treatment 
when signs and symptoms of infection appear. 
 
6.5.3.2.  Internal contamination may occur from inhalation, ingestion, or absorption.  
Intact skin is a barrier to alpha particles; however internal contamination can occur 
through abrasions and punctures in the skin.  Organs affected by internal contamination 
include the lungs, liver, thyroid, and bones.  Blocking or diluting agents, and chelation 
therapy, may reduce total exposure to radioactive materials in the body. 
 
6.5.3.3.  Detailed treatment information for radiological casualties is found in AFMAN(I) 
44-161, Treatment of Nuclear and Radiological Casualties and Armed Forces Radiology 
Research Institute (AFRRI), Medical Management of Radiological Casualties.  For 
patients with internal contamination, low-levels of radioactive material may be excreted 
in the urine, feces, sweat, and other body fluids. 
 
6.5.4.  Mental Health Service Support. 
 
6.5.4.1.  NBC events will generate stress, fear, panic, and uncertainty.  US forces have 
little real world operational experience in NBC environments, and fear of the unknown 
will cause both acute stress and delayed stress reactions among personnel in all ranks.  
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
47
The senior medical officer must provide the installation commander consultation on 
mental health issues and stress management. 
 
6.5.4.2.  Stress will manifest itself in different ways at different times during the NBC 
event.  In the pre-attack phase, fear of the unknown and uncertainty of the adequacy of 
defensive equipment and emergency plans may produce excessive stress.  During an 
NBC event, the psychological effects of death, suffering, and destruction; the 
physiological and psychological effect of wearing protective equipment; and being 
isolated and not knowing what is happening, will be the greatest stressors.  After an NBC 
event, debilitating injury for wounded personnel, “survivor guilt,” and fear of long-term 
health consequences (particularly reproductive) are mental health concerns. 
 
6.5.4.3.  The following techniques are recommended to minimize these stressors and their 
negative impact on mental health. 
 
6.5.4.3.1.  Keep people informed as much as security concerns will permit. 
 
6.5.4.3.2.  Train aggressively and exercise response plans.  Improve these as needed. 
 
6.5.4.3.3.  Encourage open discussion about possible health affects and related 
concerns at all levels of supervision and command.  Provide fact-based risk 
assessments to unit leadership that neither diminish nor exaggerate the threat. 
 
6.5.4.3.4.  Take steps to ensure all personnel are assigned clear roles and 
responsibilities in response to an NBC event.  Hold personnel accountable for 
understanding and performing their jobs. 
 
6.5.4.3.5.  Encourage open and realistic, but respectful and appropriate, discussion of 
stress and fear.  Emphasize to personnel that they can succeed in their jobs despite 
their fear. 
 
6.5.4.3.6.  Rapidly intervene at the lowest command level possible for individuals 
displaying signs and symptoms of acute or delayed stress reactions.  Recognize that 
stress is a normal reaction.  Recommend treatments that emphasize reassurance, 
temporary rest and removal, and return to duty (RTD) as soon as medically advisable. 
 
6.5.4.3.7.  Establish guidelines for medication and evacuation of stress casualties in 
severe cases. 
 
6.5.4.3.8.  Coordinate with Life Skills Support Center and Chaplain Services for 
counseling and mental health support at the installation. 
 
6.5.4.3.9.  Determine location and establish plans for accessing mental health care 
providers if not available at the deployed medical facility. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002

6.5.5.  Quarantine and Isolation. 
 
6.5.5.1.  Quarantine Considerations.  BW agents may display a wide range of times 
between exposure and the onset of clinical symptoms (botulinum toxin, 12 to 36 hours; 
and smallpox, 7 to 17 days).  Multiple agents can lead to the presence of coinfection-
acute illness with short incubation and longer incubating agent such as smallpox (which 
may declare itself after patients have been evacuated for evaluation or treatment of the 
short incubating disease).  Therefore, consideration should be given to quarantining 
patients for 17 days after AE from a BW area if plague, smallpox, and viral hemorrhagic 
fevers cannot be excluded.  Administrative quarantine of the entire military 
installation/facility may be required in the event of a large disease outbreak, BW, or 
terrorist event. 
 
6.5.5.2.  Isolation Considerations.  Isolation should be in designated tents or other 
structures.  The use of surgical masks on patients is appropriate when separate tents or 
structures are not available.  Infection control practices can be modified after the agent is 
identified.  Most agents require only standard precautions. 
 
6.5.5.3.  References.  Refer to AFMAN(I) 44-156, Treatment of Biological Warfare 
Agent Casualties, and USAMRIID, Medical Management of Biological Casualties 
Handbook, for additional information.  Contact the AFFOR/SG for current quarantine 
and isolation guidance and policy. 
 
6.5.5.4.  Mass Casualty Situations.  Infection control procedures should be reinforced 
for mass casualty situations with undifferentiated febrile illness following a suspected 
BW attack.  Isolate patients and use respiratory droplet precautions, in addition to 
standard precautions, until contagious disease can be excluded.  Field conditions may 
dictate actual isolation practices.  The precautions listed below should be complied 
with to the fullest extent possible. 
 
6.5.5.5.  Respiratory Protection.  Base personnel use the NBC mask for protection from 
biological agents.  When biological agent contamination is limited to a quarantine or 
isolation area within the DMF, alternative respiratory protection may be appropriate.  
Bioenvironmental Engineering personnel, in consultation with infection control 
personnel, should determine alternative respiratory protection requirements.  The 
following should be considered when determining respiratory protection: 
 
6.5.5.5.1.  The degree to which the agent is infectious (i.e., Will it spread person to 
person?). 
 
6.5.5.5.2.  The degree to which aerosolization of the agent is possible:  If spread by 
respiratory droplets (e.g., Plague), they are heavy and are believed to not travel more 
than 3 feet from the patient, versus droplet nuclei (Smallpox, TB) which are small and 
can travel on air currents for long distances.

6.5.5.5.4.  Existing ventilation and infection control procedures. 
 
6.5.5.5.5.  Respiratory protection alternatives may include the use of air purifying 
respirators with N, P, or R-series filters at 95, 99, or 100% efficiency. 
 
6.5.5.6.  Standard Precautions. 
 
6.5.5.6.1.  Wash hands after patient contact. 
 
6.5.5.6.2.  Use gloves when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and 
contaminated items. 
 
6.5.5.6.3.  Use respiratory protection.  Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) and 
atmosphere supplying respirators may also be used when filtering face piece devices 
and other air purifying respirators will not provide adequate protection during 
procedures likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or 
excretions. 
 
6.5.5.6.4.  Use eye protection and wear a gown during procedures likely to generate 
splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions. 
 
6.5.5.6.5.  Handle contaminated patient-care equipment and linen in a manner that 
prevents the transfer of microorganisms to people or equipment. 
 
6.5.5.6.6.  Practice care when handling sharps. 
 
6.5.5.6.7.  Use a mask or other ventilation device as an alternative to mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation when practical. 
 
6.5.5.6.8.  Ideally, place the patient in a private room when feasible if they may have 
a contagious illness.  Use cohort isolation of patients with similar infection if unable 
to isolate individual patients. 
 
6.5.5.7.  Specific Precautions.  Include standard precautions plus: 
 
6.5.5.7.1.  Airborne Precautions.  This isolation strategy must be thought through 
based on the physical nature of the structure from which care is provided, i.e., 
hospital versus tent. 
 
6.5.5.7.1.1.  Hospital.  Place the patient in a private room that has negative air 
pressure, at least six air changes per hour, and appropriate air filtration before it is 
discharged from the room. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
50
 
6.5.5.7.1.2.  Hospital.  Use respiratory protection when entering the room; i.e., N-
95 particulate respirator. 
 
6.5.5.7.1.3.  Hospital.  Limit movement and transport of the patient.  Use a mask 
on the patient if they need to be moved. 
 
6.5.5.7.1.4.  Tent.  This isolation will pose one of the greatest challenges as it 
requires a special negative pressure ventilation, which a tent does not have.  
Therefore, considerations will include the following: 
 
6.5.5.7.1.5.  Tent.  First, put a mask on the patient immediately.  If available, use 
the N-95 particulate respirator.  If it is not available, use the cup style surgical 
mask as a second choice.  If that is not available, use the tie style surgical mask 
with the goal being to ensure a very close fit around the edges so respiratory 
particles do not escape.  If the patient cannot tolerate a mask then try to avoid 
having them enter the tent, have all healthcare workers in a mask and begin to 
consider options. 
 
6.5.5.7.1.6.  Tent.  Evaluate the patient as soon as possible.  If they have to be 
admitted and the Infectious Disease Team component is not present then consider 
setting up an alternate shelter outside (downwind) if the weather permits, OR, 
placing the patient as far as possible from all other patients AND keeping the 
patient masked at all times.  The mask will have to be changed approximately 
every two hours, as the moisture from exhalation will decrease its ability to act as 
an effective barrier.  If the Infectious Disease Team component is present they 
will have the capability to set up a tent specifically for the care of patients 
requiring airborne precautions. 
 
6.5.5.7.1.7.  Tent.  Another intervention can be the use of a curtain to create a 
“cubical” for this type of patient.  They will still have to wear the mask but it may 
offer some additional protection to others in the tent. 
 
6.5.5.7.1.8.  Tent.  Teach the patient to use a facial tissue to cover their mouth 
and nose if they need to remove the mask for coughing or clearing secretions.  
Provide them a trash bag in which to place their facial tissue. 
 
6.5.5.7.1.9.  Tent.  Healthcare workers will wear a mask when providing 
immediate care to this type of patient.  For healthcare workers, the mask is worn 
once for a patient encounter and then discarded into the regular trash.  Attempts to 
try and save or reuse these masks are usually unsuccessful due to limited space 
and the potential to cross contaminate each other’s mask. 
 
6.5.5.7.1.10.  Tent.  Other protective apparel to include gloves and gowns are 
worn as appropriate for the task being performed. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
51
 
6.5.5.7.1.11.  Tent.   Transporting the patient within the tent area requires  the 
patient wear the N-95 respirator mask, properly fitted to cover the nose and 
mouth. 
 
6.5.5.7.2.  Droplet Precautions. 
 
6.5.5.7.2.1.  Hospital.  Place the patient in a private room or with someone with 
the same infection.  If not feasible, maintain at least 3 feet between patients. 
 
6.5.5.7.2.2.  Hospital.  Use respiratory protection within 3 feet of the patient.  A 
surgical mask that is well fitted to the face, such that it is not gapped open on the 
sides, is adequate. 
 
6.5.5.7.2.3.  Hospital.  Limit movement and transport of the patient.  Use a well 
fitting mask on the patient if they need to be moved. 
 
6.5.5.7.2.4.  Tent.  The easiest way to prevent the spread of these droplets is to 
place a surgical mask on the patient.  If available, use the cup-style as it fits more 
closely to the face. 
 
6.5.5.7.2.5.  Tent.  Patient condition and weather permitting, the patient may also 
be evaluated outside the tent, downwind preferably.  If they require entry in the 
tent or need to be admitted, the mask is required for the patient.  If admitted they 
should be placed as far as possible from other patients, at the far end of the tent. 
 
6.5.5.7.2.6.  Tent.  It is recommended that a tent curtain/divider be used to create 
a “cubical” for the patient.  As long as they are enclosed in the cubical they will 
not have to wear a mask because the respiratory droplets are large and will not 
travel far (3 feet is the general rule).  If this type of cubical cannot be created, it 
would be wise to keep a mask on the patient until such time as they are no longer 
infectious. 
 
6.5.5.7.2.7.  Tent.  Healthcare workers providing immediate care to the patient 
will wear a cup-style surgical mask. 
 
6.5.5.7.2.8.  Tent.  Other protective apparel to include gloves and gowns are worn 
appropriate for the task being performed. 
 
6.5.5.7.2.9.  Tent.  Transporting the patient within the tent area requires the 
patient wear a cup style surgical mask as a minimum.

6.5.5.7.3.  Contact Precautions. 
 
6.5.5.7.3.1.  General.  In addition to standard precautions use contact precautions 
for patients known to or suspected to have serious illnesses easily transmitted by 
direct patient contact or by indirect contact with items in the patient’s 
environment.  The patient is restricted to the room during isolation. 
 
6.5.5.7.3.2.  Hospital.  Place the patient in a private room or with someone with 
the same infection if possible. 
 
6.5.5.7.3.3.  Hospital.  Use gloves when entering the room.  Change gloves after 
contact with infective material. 
 
6.5.5.7.3.4.  Hospital.  Wear a gown when entering the room if contact with 
patient is anticipated or if the patient has diarrhea, a colostomy, or wound 
drainage not covered by a dressing. 
 
6.5.5.7.3.5.  Hospital.  Limit the movement or transport of the patient from the 
room. 
 
6.5.5.7.3.6.  Hospital.  Ensure that patient-care items, bedside equipment, and 
frequently touched surfaces receive daily cleaning. 
 
6.5.5.7.3.7.  Hospital.  Dedicate use of noncritical patient-care equipment to a 
single patient or cohort of patients with the same pathogen.  If not feasible, 
adequate disinfection between patients is necessary. 
 
6.5.5.7.3.8.  Tent.  Any patient or group of patients suspected of having an illness 
spread via contact should be separated, either by distance or a barrier such as a 
curtain, from the rest of the patients.  This is not because the germs will jump 
from patient to patient but instead to act as a reminder to healthcare workers that 
this particular patient requires something extra. 
 
6.5.5.7.3.9.  Tent.  Guidance for wearing personal protective attire (PPA):  
Gloves are required when entering the patient’s cubical or providing direct care.  
Gown and gloves are required for all personnel and visitors when in close or 
direct contact with the patient, or used patient equipment (e.g., over bed table, 
etc.), or supplies.  Close contact is defined as within 3 feet of the patient or 
contaminated equipment or furniture.  If the patient has an ileostomy, colostomy, 
or diarrhea, gowns are required at all times. 
 
6.5.5.7.3.10.  Tent.  Guidance for transporting the patient within the tent:  For 
personnel transporting the patient, wear gloves and preferably an isolation gown.  
Cover the patient with a clean sheet. 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002

6.5.6.  Patient Movement in NBC Environments. 
 
6.5.6.1.  Patient evacuation must be conducted, even in contaminated environments.  
Operation in NBC contamination may slow evacuation and increase patient holding 
times.  Adequate planning and training will help to mitigate these difficulties.   
 
6.5.6.2.  Evacuation may be conducted using personnel, vehicles, or aircraft.  Use of 
personnel to physically carry casualties is labor intensive and difficult in IPE and adverse 
climatic conditions.  This should only be used for short distances.  Ground vehicles are 
readily available and are easier to decontaminate and replace than aircraft.  The primary 
means of evacuation will be by ground vehicle.   
 
6.5.6.3.  The NBC environment forces the commander to consider what assets will be 
committed to evacuation from the contaminated area.  Minimize the number of medical 
evacuation assets that are exposed to contamination, taking into account the number and 
rate of casualties requiring evacuation.  Use those vehicles that are already contaminated 
prior to committing additional assets to the contaminated area.  Consider use of non-
medical vehicles of opportunity that are already contaminated.  If possible, dirty vehicles 
should not leave the contaminated area.  Use these vehicles to shuttle patients to the 
decontamination or transload point.  If contaminated vehicles must travel outside of the 
contaminated area, use the same route for all contaminated vehicles to travel to the 
decontamination area and return.  This route should be considered “dirty” and should not 
be crossed by clean vehicles or troops.  The route should be coordinated with higher 
headquarters and the host nation to prevent unintended exposure of vehicles or personnel.  
Patient protective wraps (PPWs) should be used to protect decontaminated patients if 
they must be transported through contaminated areas. 
 
6.5.6.4.  Helicopter rotorwash may disturb contaminants on the ground posing a risk of 
contamination to adjacent areas.  The landing zone should not be located upwind of 
decontamination or “clean” areas.   
 
6.5.6.5.  Fixed wing air evacuation may be limited.  Contaminated casualties should be 
transported by ground vehicles and decontaminated prior to entry into the MASF or air 
evacuation holding area.  Air evacuation of potentially contaminated patients requires the 
approval of the destination country, and of any country where the aircraft will land or 
overfly.  Foreign nations may not permit contaminated aircraft to land or overfly their 
airspace. Coordination between the supported combatant commander and Department of 
State may be required.  Authorization to transport contaminated patients on US Air Force 
aircraft requires approval of the Theater and US Transportation Command combatant 
commanders.  If an aircraft is committed to the contamination zone, patients should be 
decontaminated prior to transfer to clean aircraft, vehicles, or facilities.  This should be 
accomplished at a remote transload point or isolated ramp area, keeping in mind the off-
load and decontamination areas will become contaminated.  (Refer to AFTTP 3-42.5, 
Aeromedical Evacuation, for additional information.) 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
54
 
6.5.6.6.  Air evacuation personnel should be able to provide en route care for NBC 
casualties.  Normally casualties will be decontaminated prior to air evacuation.  However, 
biologic casualties may remain infectious.  The US Army maintains an Aeromedical 
Isolation Team (AIT) at USAMRIID.  This is a rapid response team designed to safely 
evacuate and manage patients with potentially lethal communicable diseases under high-
level containment.  The AIT cannot provide mass casualty evacuation.  
 
6.5.6.7. 
 
Air 
evacuation 
crews 
should 
have 
required 
immunizations 
and 
chemoprophylaxis.  Capabilities for isolation of infectious casualties and disposal of 
contaminated wastes need to be in place.  Procedures for decontamination of non-
disposable medical equipment should be identified.  All Air Evacuation personnel should 
know isolation and universal protective precautions and be competent in operation in 
required personal protective equipment to include IPE.  Protocols for transport of 
contaminated and infectious patients should be developed and exercised for each air 
evacuation platform.   
 
6.5.7.  Management of Human Remains. 
 
6.5.7.1.  Management of human remains is primarily a Services responsibility.  The 
medical community advises to protect health and prevent the spread of disease.  For more 
information, reference JP 4-06, JTTP for Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations and 
AFMAN 10-2602 [Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional Defense 
Operations and Standards. 
 
6.5.7.2.  Human remains should be rendered safe for transportation into the United States 
and for release to mortuaries.  Remains should be evacuated to military port mortuaries in 
CONUS.  Remains contaminated by chemical agents can normally be rendered safe by 
external decontamination.  Biologically contaminated remains must be embalmed and 
transported in appropriate sealed containers.   
 
6.5.7.3.  The Mortuary Affairs Decontamination Collection Point (MADCP) is an 
operational element under oversight of the Joint Mortuary Affairs Office (JMAO).  The 
MADCP is staffed by specialized mortuary affairs and NBC defense personnel.  In the 
event of a large number of NBC casualties spread over a wide area, the resources of the 
MADCP may be overwhelmed.  Local initial decontamination or contaminated remains 
collection points may need to be established.  US Air Force, mortuary affairs activities 
are performed by Services personnel. Medical consultation may be required in the event 
of contaminated casualties.  Large numbers of contaminated remains may require 
alternative procedures.  If adequate decontamination capability is not available, 
contaminated remains may have to be buried in place.  The area commander, with 
consultation of the JMAO, may authorize mass burials.

LOGISTICS 
 
7.1.  General.  Protecting medical supplies and equipment from the effects of NBC 
contamination is absolutely essential to maintaining operational capability of any deployed 
medical unit.  The Medical Logistics Supply Chain must be able to deliver essential medical 
supplies in an NBC environment.  Medical supplies must continue to arrive at the deployed 
location free of contamination and in serviceable condition.  Deployed medical units must be 
able to protect their limited supply stocks from becoming lost due to NBC attack. 
 
7.2.  Protecting Medical Materiel on Site. 
 
7.2.1.  Every effort must be made to protect all medical supplies and equipment during NBC 
defense operations.  This includes materiel kept at the various sections throughout the DMF.  
Placing supplies and equipment under sufficient cover will decrease the potential for loss.  
Supplies should be wrapped in plastic and placed under tents or stored in CP locations if 
possible.  Wrapping supplies in two layers of plastic with M-8 paper placed on the outer 
layer to assist in the identification of post-attack chemical agent contamination.  The thicker 
the plastic the longer it will protect. 
 
7.2.2.  Plastic wrap is not part of allowance standards and must be obtained prior to 
deployment into an NBC threat area or obtained immediately upon notification of an 
increasing threat.  Base supply or CE is the  source for plastic coverings; contact them prior 
to deployment to palletize necessary supplies. 
 
7.2.3.  Protection from the thermal and blast effects of nuclear detonations requires more 
elaborate measures.  Placing supplies in trenches, inside earthen berms, behind substantial 
stonewalls, or in other field expedient depressions or facilities will enhance the protective 
posture of supplies and equipment from nuclear effects. 
 
7.3.  Protecting Medical Materiel During Transportation. 
 
7.3.1.  Normal transportation methods offer a reasonable amount of protection from BW/CW 
agents by virtue of their design.  Supplies are normally shipped in boxes that are transported 
in closed aircraft and or trucks.  In addition to being placed in boxes most items are shrink-
wrapped and or placed under plastic if built onto a 463L aircraft pallet. 
 
7.3.2.  Supplies en route are most vulnerable when awaiting transfer at transshipment nodes.  
It is recommended that supplies destined for a known NBC environment or a designated high 
threat area be placed in plastic bags or wrapped in plastic before being placed in shipping 
boxes or containers.  This will further protect the cargo from exposure.  This extra protection 
will add minimal procedural changes at the source of supply and the deployed location. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
56
7.3.3.  Coordination with the sustaining base must be made to ensure steps are taken with 
vendors and other sources of supply to protect cargo during and immediately after 
transportation. 
 
7.4.  Biomedical Maintenance Support in an NBC Environment. 
 
7.4.1.  To minimize exposure to NBC agents or materials, medical equipment should be 
covered with plastic or tarps when practical.  Maintenance on biomedical equipment will 
become more complex under NBC conditions. 
 
7.4.2.  After exposure, the decontamination of some medical equipment may be a problem 
for maintenance personnel.  The use of standard decontamination agents may cause damage 
beyond repair to some biomedical and electronic equipment.  In some instances, removal of 
chemical agents from medical equipment will require aging (off gassing). 
 
7.4.3.  Decontamination of biomedical equipment must be performed in MOPP Level 4 until 
decontamination is completed. 
 
7.5. Biological Warfare/Chemical Warfare (BW/CW) Personal Protection Items.  The 
chemical/biological ensemble provides adequate protection for most internal radiological 
hazards.  An area contaminated with radioactive material would require the donning of a lead 
suit as protection from the external radiation hazards.  However, the donning of mask, gloves, 
and boot covers will minimize the inhalation and ingestion of radiological contamination. 
 
7.5.1.  Issue.  When directed by appropriate authority BW/CW individual protection items 
will be issued IAW AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 5, chapter 15.  This 
means that most units arriving in-theater will receive their BW/CW protection items prior to 
deployment and have them when they arrive.  Units already in theater will require their 
BW/CW items to be issued when notified by the appropriate authority.  There will also be 
units and individuals arriving in-theater without some or all of their BW/CW items.  They too 
must be issued their required BW/CW items IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 5, chapter 15.   
Recognize that medical logistics must be able to accommodate units or individuals that will 
require occasional re-issue of some or all items due to various reasons.  This means it may be 
necessary for deployed medical logistics activities to periodically requisition BW/CW items 
through the established supply chain. 
 
7.5.2.  Accountability.  The procedures in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 5, chapter 15, will 
account for quantity and lot numbers issued.  This provides a starting point for possible 
quality assurance recall actions.  They also provide a starting point for implementing 
investigational new drug (IND) protocol accountability requirements if applicable.  Troop 
commanders and individuals are to maintain accountability of the items from time of issue 
until turn-in.  The medical logistics activity cannot account for BW/CW items once they are 
issued to units or individuals. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
57
7.5.3.  Turn-in.  The turn-in of all unused BW/CW individual protective items will be 
accepted by the issuing medical logistics activity.  If this is not feasible, assets may be 
returned to any Air Force medical logistics activity.  At recurrent deployment sites, 
prepositioning assets at the deployed location based on the UMD will reduce wastage of 
supplies.  BW/CW items turned back in will not be considered for re-issue.  Medical logistics 
activities will separate turn-in items and hold them until disposition instructions are provided.

EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
 
8.1.  General. 
 
8.1.1.  The role of the Air Force HSS in the NBC environment is to mitigate and to minimize 
the effects of NBC wounds, injuries, and disease in order to maintain and sustain sortie 
generation.  It is through education and training that Air Force medical personnel will obtain 
the necessary counter NBC operational skills required to ensure an optimal degree of success. 
 
8.1.2.  The goal of education and training, formal or informal, is to impart a working 
knowledge of the concepts, principles, and procedures of operating in the NBC environment.  
This education and training shall address the individual, collective unit, and leadership skills 
needed to support combatant commander requirements. 
 
8.1.3.  It is clear that there is a core set of skill requirements that apply to every medic, 
regardless of specialty.  However, the level of expertise brought to bear on the NBC event 
will determine the breath and depth of understanding and level of proficiency.  Through 
education, the basis for training will be established.  Training will include hands-on exposure 
to NBC defense techniques and procedures, and exercises.  Stressing, realistic exercises are 
the best ways in which to demonstrate and revalidate operational capability of the medical 
response to an NBC event.  These exercises will not only reinforce skill sets but will serve to 
provide a tool to objectively measure the desired mission outcome.  In the end, the desired 
goal of all NBCCDT is to develop a working knowledge of the required skill set and to 
demonstrate an appropriate level of proficiency. 
 
8.1.4.  The combination of core skill requirements and mission specific or UTC specific 
requirements represent the full-spectrum requisite NBC training.  The Manpower and 
Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) for each UTC establishes a mission essential task 
list (METL) which identifies the key skills required by UTC members to function effectively 
in the NBC environment.  UTC-specific training requirements are derived from the METLs. 
 
8.1.5.  Medical readiness education and training building blocks begins with initial training 
received upon entry into the Service and continues with periodic refresher training throughout 
the lifecycle of the Service member.  The pieces of the blocks can best be described in three 
phases: initial training, sustainment training, and just-in-time (JIT) training. (See Figure 8.1.) 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002

Figure 8.1. Training Building Blocks 
 
8.1.5.1.  Initial Training.  Initial NBCCDT will occur at the accession/entry-level 
courses.  NBCCDT is described in AFI 10-2501 (Draft), Full Spectrum Threat Response 
(FSTR) Planning and Operations, and includes, but is not limited to, the proper use of 
individual protective equipment (IPE).  For the enlisted, these entry-level courses may 
include Basic Military Training (BMT) at Lackland AFB, the Expeditionary Medical 
Readiness Course (EMRC) at Sheppard AFB, or Basic Expeditionary Medical Readiness 
Training (BEMRT) at Brooks AFB.  Officers receive initial training by attending the 
Commissioned Officer Training (COT)/Reserve Commissioned Officer Training (RCOT) 
course, or through a commissioning program such as a Service academy, Reserve Officer 
Training Corps (ROTC), or Officer Training School.  All personnel that do not receive 
NBCCDT through these accession programs must be trained at the unit level within 6 
months of their assignment. 
 
8.1.5.2.  Sustainment Training. 
 
8.1.5.2.1.  Air Force specialty code (AFSC) sustainment training (AFSC-specific 
Readiness Skills Verification Program [RSVP]) is designed to maintain medical skills 
of a fully qualified member to adequately perform the duties required by the 
member’s AFSC in a deployed setting.  All personnel assigned to deployable UTCs 
must participate in appropriate AFSC specific training.  MAJCOMs may provide 
supplemental guidance for all other medical personnel (e.g., nondeployable UTCs, in-
place/generation/forward deployed units, CONUS reception/expansion, and those 
personnel not assigned to UTCs) to complete RSVP training, based on readiness 
missions. 
 
8.1.5.2.2.  Enlisted personnel enter into the sustainment training upon award of the 5-
skill level.  Officers enter sustainment training after completion of unit orientation 
program and completion of a fully qualified AFSC.

8.1.5.2.3.  The RSVP training database, maintained by the Wartime Medical Planning 
System Office (WAR-MED PSO) is the primary guide for medical specialty specific 
medical readiness training.  Units will use AFSC specific training RSVP requirements 
as part of their annual medical readiness training plan to ensure that every opportunity 
to conduct training is identified, planned, and documented appropriately.  Training 
tasks, which are identified in the AFSC specific sustainment training database, are the 
catalyst for training program development. 
 
8.1.5.2.4.  Several venues for sustainment training that address AFSC-specific and 
UTC-specific requirements are available to medical personnel.  Formal courses 
provide an opportunity for a standardized approach to training.  Additionally, 
maximum utilization of distance learning capabilities will be integral in reducing 
temporary duty (TDY) costs and time away from home station.  Reference materials 
(e.g., NBC toolkit, CD-ROM training, etc.) should be incorporated as needed to 
augment initial training. 
 
8.1.5.3. Just-in-time (JIT) Training.  Although JIT training is a component of education 
and training, it is not the optimal or desired method of training.  Therefore, JIT training 
should occur just prior to the deployment phase (predeployment) of the operation or 
while deployed.  The goal of JIT training is immediate reenforcement of critical NBC 
skills only (e.g., wear of the protective mask, proper inspection of individual protective 
equipment [IPE], use of auto-injectors, etc.). 
 
8.1.6.  Field Exercises.  Training conducted outside the classroom, normally employing unit 
equipment, and operating under simulated NBC conditions.  An example of a field exercise is 
a circumstance in which a unit focuses on setting up its medical equipment and simulates all 
aspects of the deployment phase of an NBC operation.  Essential elements of the exercise 
should include aspects of triage, decontamination, treatment, and transportation of casualties.  
These tasks should be performed both with and without IPE. 
 
8.2.  Core NBC Requirements.  Core requirements are those essential or critical NBC training 
requirements that if not received would significantly degrade the individual’s or unit’s ability to 
operate in an NBC environment.  These critical skills, common to every medic regardless of 
deployment status, forward location, or home-based assignment, are identified in support of the 
three pillars of force health protection (FHP): healthy and fit force, casualty prevention, and 
casualty care management, as outlined in AFDD 2-4.2, Health Services, and JP 4-02 [Final 
Draft], Doctrine for Health Service Support in Joint Operations.  Specifically, all health care 
providers must attend in-residence or take by satellite course the following courses:  Medical 
Management of Biological Casualties Course (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, Maryland), Medical 
Management of Chemical Casualties Course (USAMRICD, Aberdeen, Maryland), and Medical 
Effects of Ionizing Radiation Course (AFRRI, Bethesda, Maryland).  Enlisted medical personnel 
should attend the Field Management of Chemical and Biological Casualties Course 
(USAMRIID/USAMRICD).  Attachment 5 contains a list of NBC references for health care 
providers.

8.2.1.  Healthy and Fit Force.  A healthy and fit force increases resiliency to overcome 
adversity.  All personnel should make every effort to promote emotional and physical health 
and fitness, both individually and as a unit.  The DMC’s leadership skills will include: 
 
8.2.1.1.  Planning factors: 
 
8.2.1.1.1.  Chain of command/lines of communication. 
 
8.2.1.1.2.  Threat. 
 
8.2.1.1.3.  Unique factors during predeployment, deployment and postdeployment 
phases of operations (e.g., plans, vulnerability assessments, beddown considerations, 
lessons learned, etc.). 
 
8.2.1.1.4.  Required capability necessary to meet threat. 
 
8.2.1.1.5.  Combat stress control. 
 
8.2.1.2.  Logistics considerations: 
 
8.2.1.2.1.  Protecting materiel. 
 
8.2.1.2.2.  Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET) support. 
 
8.2.1.2.3.  Issuing BW/CW countermeasures. 
 
8.2.2.  Casualty Prevention.  Core requirements for casualty prevention will include the 
following passive defense actions: 
 
8.2.2.1.  Contamination avoidance. 
 
8.2.2.2.  Decontamination. 
 
8.2.2.3.  IPE. 
 
8.2.2.4.  Chemoprophylaxis. 
 
8.2.2.5.  Medical intelligence/NBC threat to base population. 
 
8.2.2.6.  In-processing immunization.

8.2.2.9.  Containment. 
 
8.2.3.  Casualty Care Management.  Core requirements for casualty care management will 
include: 
 
8.2.3.1.  First responder—those units/personnel who are first on the scene when medical 
care is required.  These individuals provide initial life saving/life sustaining care to NBC 
casualties prior to the transport of the patient to the next level of care.  These situations 
include, but are not limited to in-flight emergencies (IFEs), mass casualty situations, 
hazardous materials (HAZMAT) response, and other emergency responses.  In some 
cases, triage teams may be classified as first responders.  All 4NOX1 first responders will 
be nationally registered as Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)-Basic as a minimum 
level of qualification.  Physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and IDMTs who also may 
ride in ambulances, will have even higher levels of certification and inherently meet this 
requirement.   
 
8.2.3.2.  Principles of the phases of care: 
 
8.2.3.2.1.  Triage. 
 
8.2.3.2.2.  Decontamination. 
 
8.2.3.2.3.  Treatment. 
 
8.2.3.2.4.  Transportation. 
 
8.2.3.3.   Self-aid/buddy care (SABC). 
 
8.2.3.4.  Surgical stabilization. 
 
8.2.3.5.  Surveillance (disease, vector). 
 
8.2.3.6.  Security. 
 
8.2.3.7.  Medical management of NBC casualties. 
 
8.2.3.7.1.  Pathophysiology. 
 
8.2.3.7.2.  Clinical effects/presentation. 
 
8.2.3.7.3.  Medical management (prophylaxes). 
 
8.2.3.7.4.  Protective measures and containment (isolation, universal precautions).

8.3.  Summary 
 
8.3.1.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff has identified four resources of measurement to determine 
the readiness of any unit.  This measurement tool, known as the Status of Resources and 
Training System (SORTS), assesses equipment/supplies, equipment/supplies condition, 
personnel, and training.  Of these, training is by far the easiest to influence for optimal 
effectiveness. 
 
8.3.2.  Education and training is a vital determinant to the success or failure in any operation, 
whether in an NBC environment or conventional.  Education and training of Air Force 
Medical Service personnel in support of combatant commander requirements and FHP 
activities will minimize the medical effects of an NBC event on operational units and 
increase survivability during NBC environments. 
 
8.4.  Forms Prescribed. 
 
DD Form 2766, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flow Sheet. 
DD Form 2795, Predeployment Health Assessment. 
DD Form 2796, Postdeployment Health Assessment.

MEDICAL NBC UTC MISCAPS 
 
NBC-Related AFMS UTCs.  UTC CONOPS can be located at USAF/SGX homepage, 
https://www.afms.mil/sgxr/index.cfm. 
 
Wartime Medical Decontamination Team (WMDT)(UTCs FFGLA and FFGLB): UTC 
FFGLA is equipment and UTC FFGLB is a 19-person team.  Provides decontamination (decon) 
personnel to support theater bed-down locations as determined by the medical planner.  The 
Patient Decontamination Team consists of medical personnel and is equipped to decontaminate 
500 patients over a 30-day period without resupply.  Each Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH) is 
authorized and may require two personnel teams per equipment set, capable of operating on a 24-
hour basis. Low threat areas may have one team assigned at the discretion of the Theater 
AFFOR/ASETF Surgeon. 
 
Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) Nuclear/Biological/Chemical (NBC) Team (UTC 
FFGL1) (Note, this UTC is undergoing modernization to a new name (Medical NBC Team) 
and reduction in personnel size to 3 persons; ECD for revision is Sep 02): Provides increased 
wing survivability through NBC surveillance, detection, and abatement.  Advises wing survival 
recovery center (SRC) on NBC threats, decontamination options, personnel protective equipment 
capabilities, and NBC health risk to deployed personnel.  Provides field NBC detection through 
augmentation of the base NBC Defense Cell.  Advises SRC on threat impact, protective action, 
and recovery activities.  This six-member team includes equipment. 
 
Biological Augmentation Team (BAT) (UTC FFBAT): Provides advanced diagnostic 
identification capability for pathogens of operational concern at the deployed location.  Team 
members analyze samples and interpret results using a nucleic acid based testing platform.  The 
two-member team deploys based on threat assessments and may deploy along with the EMEDS 
forces or individually, depending on mission needs. 
 
Infectious Disease: Provides infectious disease augmentation to an AFTH with two UTCs: 
FFHA2, Infectious Disease Team, and FFHA5, Infectious Disease Augmentation Team. 
 
Infectious Disease Team (UTC FFHA2): Provides infectious disease support and 
equipment to 25-bed or larger AFTH facilities (generally centrally located at one to three 
locations per theater).  The 15-member team (consisting of one infectious disease physician, 
a clinical nurse trained in infection control, six clinical nurses, six medical technicians, and 
one public health technician) identifies, controls, and provides treatment for infectious 
diseases in the deployed theater. The team provides public health surveillance and 
specialized care for patients with biological warfare, nosocomial, and DNBI infections 
transmissible to other patients and personnel.  Identifies, confirms, and reports use of 
biological warfare agents.  Provides consultation to preventive medicine teams, uses 
telemedicine capabilities for consultation with theater epidemiology team (UTC FFHA1), 
AFTTP 3-42.3  26 AUGUST 2002 
 
72
BEE NBC team (UTC FFGL1), and CONUS-based medical and all biological and infectious 
disease centers.  Oversees operation of six-bed patient isolation area. 
 
Infectious Disease Augmentation Team (UTC FFHA5): Provides two personnel who 
provide manpower to augment infectious disease and infection control support in the theater.  
Normally deploys after UTC FFHA2 to AFTHs with more than 100 beds where a significant 
threat of biological warfare or infectious disease casualties exists.  Augments ability to 
identify, control, and provide treatment for infectious diseases and biological warfare agents 
in the theater.  Provides intratheater infectious disease consultation. 
 
Theater Epidemiology Team (TET) (UTC FFHA1):  Provides theater level support to Air 
Force component command surgeon or joint task force surgeon.  Provides medical 
environmental and occupational threat assessments, support for outbreak investigations, and 
recommendations for preventive countermeasures and needed surveillance systems.  Coordinates 
with other medical and line force protection teams and with federal and international agencies.  
Collocated with their theater surgeon or appropriate headquarters element. 
 
Air Force Radiation Assessment Team (AFRAT):  The AFRAT Nuclear Incident Response 
Force (NIRF) 1 and 2(FFRA1 and FFRA2), and the Radioanalytical Assessment Team (RAT) 
(FFRA3) are globally responsive specialty asset teams that provide specialized field radiological 
monitoring and consequence management support to the assigned theater medical authority.  The 
team measures, analyzes and interprets radiological measurements in and around the affected 
area.  Team capabilities include radiological dose rate measurements, air concentrations, ground 
deposition, and plume modeling.  They provide expert guidance on the type and degree of 
radiological hazard that face deployed forces.  Based on these assessments, recommendations are 
made to optimize force protection in light of achieving mission objectives.  Typical deployment 
scenarios could include consequence management operations from nuclear weapons accidents 
(Broken Arrows), nuclear reactor accidents (Faded Giants), and terrorist use of radiological 
dispersion weapons or improvised nuclear devices, or humanitarian assistance operations to 
countries that have experienced a nuclear exchange.  The AFRAT NIRF 1 consists of two health 
physicists, two Bioenvironmental Engineering Craftsman, two Bioenvironmental Engineering 
Journeyman and one Instrument Craftsman.  AFRAT NIRF 2 consists of four Health Physicists, 
two Bioenvironmental Engineers, six Bioenvironmental Engineering Craftsman, six 
Bioenvironmental Engineering Journeyman, and two Instrument Craftsman. The activation of 
these assets would be scaled to the specific mission needs. AFRAT NIRF 1 only, or AFRAT 
NIRF 1 followed by NIRF 2.
