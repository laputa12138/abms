Preface 
The United States Air Force (USAF) is committed to maintaining 
environmental quality to ensure long-term access to the air, land and water 
needed to protect U.S. interests abroad. Although a high level of 
environmental quality can be difficult to achieve during contingency 
operations, this goal is becoming less of an option and more of a mandate in 
successfully accomplishing the mission. By their very nature, contingency 
operations are rapid and time-constrained. Time is not always available to 
conduct comprehensive environmental planning prior to entering foreign 
countries when confronting enemies, conducting disaster relief or performing 
humanitarian operations. During initial stages of a conflict, the focus will be 
on accomplishing the mission and preserving human life. However, we must 
recognize failure to maintain basic environmental standards could result in 
illnesses, diseases and even death. An unacceptable disease and non-battle 
injury (DNBI) rate resulting from poor environmental conditions will most 
certainly impact the mission at the tactical level. We must also understand how 
tactical level environmental incidents impact mission support at the 
operational level, making it difficult to achieve U.S. strategic objectives. 
Contingency operations and environmental functions are interdependent. The 
mission is dependent upon the environment for sustainment, and the 
environment is dependent upon us for preservation and maintenance. We 
simply cannot afford to neglect environmental concerns during contingency 
operations without clearly understanding the risks involved. 
This handbook contains guidance. It does not create any rights, duties, 
obligations, or causes of action, implied or otherwise, in any third parties. 
Nothing contained in this handbook may be construed as an admission that the 
USAF has not complied with any environmental law in the past during 
contingency operations, or intends to violate any such laws in the future.

Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. Civil Engineer (CE) Hierarchy of Publications. This handbook supports 
implementation of Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness. It 
contains tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for civil engineers 
supporting overseas contingency operations. It builds upon lessons learned, 
doctrinal precepts outlined in Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 4-0, 
Combat Support and AFDD 3-34, Engineer Operations, and current AF 
policy. This relationship is illustrated in the Air Force CE hierarchy of 
publications (Figure 1.1.). This handbook contains guidance for achieving 
environmental objectives at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

1.2. Overview. This handbook addresses environmental considerations during 
contingency operations overseas. As defined in Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, 
Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, a 
contingency operation is a military operation designated by the Secretary of 
Defense (SECDEF) as a contingency operation or becomes a contingency 
operation as a matter of law. It is designated by the SECDEF as an operation 
in which members of the Armed Forces are or may become involved in 
military actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the U.S. or 
against an opposing force; or is created by definition of law. A contingency 
operation exists if a military operation results in the (1) call-up to (or retention 
on) active duty of members of the uniformed Services under certain 
enumerated statutes and (2) the call-up to (or retention on) active duty of 
members of the uniformed Services under other (non-enumerated) statutes 
during war or national emergency declared by the President or Congress. This 
handbook addresses environmental planning, actions during initial beddown, 
methods for maturing existing environmental functions during sustainment, 
and actions to prepare operating locations for closure or transfer during 
contingency operations. It does not address disposal of munitions or explosive 
residue. Guidance on disposal of waste munitions and explosive residue is 
covered in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Military Munitions 
Rule (MMR) on the Defense Environmental Network and Information 
Exchange (DENIX) website at https://www.denix.osd.mil/mmrp, DOD 
Manual 6055.09-M Volume 5, and AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance 
Disposal (EOD) Program.  
1.3. Goals. USAF environmental goals during contingencies are geared 
towards minimizing risks to human health and safety and preventing 
unnecessary damage to the environment while maximizing the natural 
resources available to support readiness and operational effectiveness.   
1.3.1. Protection. Health and safety of personnel are critical in any military 
operation. Safe, medically assessed food and water, and means of properly 
disposing of waste must be ensured. Effective controls and countermeasures 
must be implemented to prevent loss of life due to DNBI. In addition to 
protecting the health of the force, protecting the environment sustains 
operational capability and assists commanders in accomplishing their mission 
and achieving national objectives. 
 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012

1.3.2. Prevention. Prevention is the preferred means of environmental 
protection. Although competing priorities during contingency operations often 
complicate environmental management efforts, commanders should consider 
every means to minimize damage to the environment, conserve resources, and 
reduce health and safety hazards. Prevention focuses on efforts such as 
eliminating pollution at the source, reducing the amount of waste generated, 
reusing materials and recycling materials, conserving resources, product 
substitution, process changes, and spill prevention.  
1.3.3. Planning. Considering the role environmental considerations play in 
achieving DOD operational objectives, proper environmental planning for the 
various stages of contingency operations is of significant importance. Plans 
should be developed for managing water sources, solid wastes, regulated 
medical wastes, wastewater, hazardous material (HM), hazardous waste (HW) 
(excluding munitions and explosive residue), archeological, cultural, historical 
and religious sites, and flora and fauna. Plans should emphasize pollution 
prevention to protect natural resources including water, soils, and air from 
contamination. In addition, identifying potential environmental impacts in the 
early planning stages allows commanders to evaluate potential environmental 
impacts and develop strategies and issue guidance to mitigate these effects on 
the mission, personnel, and the environment or consider alternative courses of 
action. Knowing what to expect also provides the insight needed to effectively 
prepare for hazards that could threaten personnel health and safety and 
determine what areas may need to be avoided altogether.  
1.3.4. Management. Effective management techniques should be applied to 
environmental functions during contingencies to protect the force, protect the 
environment, and achieve the objectives and overall intent of the combatant 
commander (CCDR). Priorities include pollution prevention, solid waste 
management, HM/HW management, spill prevention and response, and 
compliance with CCDR guidance set forth in the environmental annex of the 
operational order (OPORD). The BCE assumes management of environmental 
functions and works with unit commanders, Medical, Bioenvironmental, 
Safety, and other key experts to provide effective environmental leadership. 
 
 
 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012

1.3.5. Mitigation. Once it is determined a site is to be closed or transferred, 
mitigation of adverse environmental impacts may be required by international 
agreement or CCDR policy. Commanders can use environmental surveys and 
condition reports conducted prior to and throughout site occupation to mitigate 
environmental hazards that present danger to human health and safety. Make 
contact with the CCDR’s environmental staff for guidance on site closure and 
environmental mitigation policies. 
1.4. Environmental Policy and Key References. Overseas contingency 
operations are excluded from most U.S. environmental laws. Environmental 
guidance for contingency operations will likely come from sources such as 
presidential executive orders (E.O.), treaties, Status of Forces Agreements 
(SOFAs) and other International Agreements (IAs),  multinational doctrine, 
DOD directives, joint doctrine, the Operational Plan (OPLAN) and/or OPORD 
under which military action is being executed, and DOD Guide 4715.05-G, 
Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD) if adopted 
by the CCDR and included in the environmental annex of the OPORD. The 
following paragraphs describe environmental guidance and other references 
that may be adopted when contingency operations transition to sustainment.    
1.4.1. Treaties and International Agreements. It is important to be aware of 
treaties and international agreements that could impact the conduct of military 
operations, whether the U.S. is party to the treaty or not. For example, the 
Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous 
Wastes and their Disposal, is an international treaty designed to control the 
movement of HW between nations, and specifically, prevent transfer of 
hazardous wastes from developed countries to less developed countries for 
recovery or disposal. Another example is the May 2002 Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) decision on transboundary 
movements of waste destined for recovery operations. The OECD decision 
applies to the U.S. and other OECD member nations and restricts cross-border 
movement of wastes destined for recovery within the OECD area. 
Standardization Agreements (STANAGs) also affect military activities. North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) STANAG 7141 EP, NATO Doctrine for 
Environmental Protection During NATO Led Military Activities, outlines 
NATO environmental doctrine for NATO led military activities and provides 
guidance on environmental planning. For planning purposes, always contact 
the MAJCOM or CCDR’s Judge Advocate (JA) for guidance on treaties and 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
11 
 
international agreements that may affect the conduct of military operations in a 
particular area of responsibility (AOR).  
1.4.2. Executive Order (E.O.) 12114. E.O. 12114, Environmental Effects 
Abroad of Major Federal Actions, provides policy guidance regarding 
environmental planning when major federal actions may have significant 
effect on the environment outside the geographic territory of the U.S. and its 
possessions. This E.O. requires responsible officials of Federal agencies to be 
informed of environmental considerations and take those considerations into 
account while making decisions on major federal actions. 
1.4.3. 
DOD 
Directive 
6050.7. 
DOD 
Directive 
(DODD) 
6050.7, 
Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Department of Defense Actions, 
implements E.O. 12114 and requires consideration of environmental effects 
prior to taking major federal actions that do significant harm to the 
environment of places outside the geographic territory of the U.S. and its 
possessions.   
1.4.4. Joint Publication 3-34. Joint Publication (JP) 3-34, Joint Engineer 
Operations, provides doctrinal guidance for integrating environmental 
considerations into joint military operations to ensure compliance with 
relevant international agreements and CCDR guidance.  
1.4.5. OPLANs and OPORDs. The CCDR’s engineer staff prepares the 
“Environmental Considerations” annex, usually “Annex L”, of the OPLAN 
during contingency and crisis action planning. The OPLAN is transformed 
into an OPORD when the CCDR sets an execution time or designates an event 
that triggers the operation. The environmental annex to OPLANs and 
OPORDs is intended to protect personnel from potential environmental 
hazards and minimize the impact of military operations on the environment. 
Once established, commanders are responsible for complying with the 
applicable environmental requirements established by the environmental 
annex, and must keep senior leadership informed of any conditions that may 
result in noncompliance with the annex.  
1.4.6. The OEBGD. This document prescribes implementation guidance, 
procedures, criteria, and standards for environmental compliance on DOD 
installations outside the U.S., but does not directly apply to ships, aircraft, 
contingencies or deployments off DOD installations. In countries where no 
FGS have been established, the OEBGD outlines minimum environmental 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
12 
 
standards and can be adopted for contingency operations if approved by the 
Environmental Executive Agent (EEA) in coordination with the Joint Task 
Force (JTF) Commander. In this case, the guidance would be included in the 
environmental annex of the OPORD.   
1.4.7. Final Governing Standards (FGS). The FGS are published by the 
designated EEA for each host nation where DOD operates an installation and 
it is determined the level of DOD presence justifies establishment of FGS. For 
a list of EEAs, see DODI 4715.5, Management of Environmental Compliance 
at Overseas Installations. The FGS are country-specific, substantive 
provisions addressing limitations on wastes, discharges, etc., or a specific 
management practice. The standards are developed by comparing OEBGD 
standards to host nation (HN) laws, SOFA, and international agreements. 
Generally, the more protective standards are adopted and included in the FGS. 
The FGS once established and issued, are applicable in foreign countries 
where DOD maintains substantial installations. Although they are country 
specific standards and do not apply to contingency operations, FGS contain 
valuable and useful environmental guidance for planners.  
1.4.8. Armed Forces Pest Management Board - Technical Guide (TG) No. 
24. TG No. 24, Contingency Pest Management Guide, provides guidance on 
using pesticides, pesticide application equipment, and other techniques to 
control 
arthropods, 
vertebrate, 
vegetation, 
and 
other 
pests 
during 
contingencies. Pesticides are used in conjunction with traditional pest 
management methods as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
program. Additional guidance on pest management during contingency 
operations can be found on the Armed Forces Pest Management Board website 
located at http://www.afpmb.org/.  
1.5. Responsibilities. Protection of the environment is everyone’s 
responsibility. Although contingencies present some challenges, diligence and 
persistence will ensure everything possible is done to protect personnel health 
and safety, and minimize damage to the environment. 
1.5.1. Combatant Command Environmental Staff. The environmental staff 
develops combatant command environmental policy and procedures to ensure 
all personnel comply with current applicable guidance including CCDR 
policy, DOD guidance, treaties and international agreements. The staff 
maintains records of all surveys and assessments conducted in the AOR and 
provides assistance on all environmental matters.      
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
13 
 
1.5.2. Installation Commander. Installation Commanders guide activities of 
personnel under their authority and instill an environmental ethic by personal 
example and proactive leadership on issues that affect the environment. They 
ensure personnel comply with environmental guidance. During joint 
operations where sites may be occupied by more than one Service, a Joint 
Environmental Management Board (JEMB) may be established per JP 3-34. 
The JEMB integrates environmental protection efforts of all components under 
a single authority. The senior Air Force commander on site provides 
experienced representation to the JEMB, and ensures all personnel are aware 
of the environmental policies and procedures established by the JEMB.    
1.5.2.1. Judge Advocate. The Judge Advocate (JA) provides advice relating 
to applicability of environmental laws, regulations, treaties, and international 
conventions, and assists in their interpretation. They provide legal assistance in 
developing the environmental annex, determining environmental analysis and 
impact requirements, assist in negotiating transit agreements for HW 
shipments, provide advice on environmental remediation issues during 
operations and upon closure, and assist in processing claims for environmental 
damage.  
1.5.2.2. Contracting. Contracting ensures contracts comply with applicable 
environmental guidance, the Performance Work Statement (PWS) stipulates 
environmental requirements, and contract proposals include detailed plans and 
costs that must be addressed. The contracting officer provides continuous 
oversight to ensure terms of the contract are being met.  
1.5.2.3. Medical Group. The Medical Group includes a Preventive and 
Aerospace Medicine (PAM) team comprised of Aerospace Medicine 
Specialists, Public Health (PH), Base Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE), and 
Independent Duty Medical Technicians (IDMTs). This team is designed to 
prevent 
DNBI 
during 
contingency 
operations. 
The 
team 
assesses 
environmental and occupational health hazards and risks; evaluates 
safety/vulnerability of local food/water sources; performs Toxic Industrial 
Chemical (TIC)/Toxic Industrial Material (TIM) assessments and contributes 
to 
emergency 
responses 
involving 
hazardous 
materials; 
performs 
epidemiological risk assessments; evaluates local medical capabilities; 
performs vector/pest risk assessments; determines the adequacy of billeting 
and public facilities; and provides medical intelligence. The PAM team 
provides input on site layout and operations, food, waste, water quality, 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012

billeting, and medical and sanitation facilities. The PAM team leader is 
considered the functional expert in casualty prevention. 
1.5.2.4. Safety. The Safety staff assists with siting HM/HW storage areas and 
developing plans and procedures for proper storage and segregation, disposal, 
and transportation. They conduct inspections of storage and accumulation 
areas to ensure compliance with applicable safety guidance. To ensure the 
safety of personnel working with HM/HW, the Safety staff coordinates with 
commanders to ensure spill prevention and response procedures are adequate 
and equipment is on hand, approved containers and labels are used, Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) are being used, and the required Material Safety 
Data Sheet (MSDS) is available. The Safety staff also assists in PWS 
development for contracting efforts.   
1.5.3. Unit Commanders. Unit commanders are also responsible for building 
an environmental ethic in their personnel and setting the tone for 
environmental compliance. Unit commanders should designate an individual 
to manage HM/HW and perform preventive tasks necessary to reduce or 
eliminate negative environmental impacts on human health and the 
environment. This individual is the Unit Environmental Coordinator (UEC).   
1.5.3.1. Unit Environmental Coordinator (UEC). The UEC provides 
support and oversight for HM/HW management activities. They work closely 
with commanders, environmental officers, Safety and medical personnel on a 
range of issues including developing unit environmental procedures, spill 
prevention and response plans, proper utilization and storage of HM/HW. 
UECs may also conduct environmental awareness training for unit members.  
1.5.3.2. Individuals. Every individual should maintain environmental 
awareness. They should be aware of requirements associated with the 
deployed location, avoid areas declared off-limits, identify risks associated 
with certain tasks, immediately respond to and report HM/HW spills, provide 
input to reduce reliance on HM, support waste reduction, recycling and reuse 
efforts, and strictly comply with guidance on wear of PPE when required.  
1.5.4. Base Civil Engineer (BCE). In conjunction with the BEE, PH, and 
Safety, the BCE is responsible for planning and implementing environmental 
functions during contingencies. The BCE appoints, guides, and supervises the 
environmental officer’s actions throughout the deployment. The BCE ensures 
the environmental staff is properly resourced with dedicated individuals to 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
15 
 
avoid deteriorating environmental conditions that threaten personnel health 
and safety and lead to costly, long-term action to clean up hazards that could 
jeopardize mission objectives. As part of the BCE organization, the Fire 
Department is involved in all aspects of environmental planning, particularly 
where HAZMAT is involved.    
1.5.4.1. Environmental Officer and Staff. A dedicated environmental officer 
should be appointed in writing immediately upon deploying. This individual 
serves as the commander’s advocate for environmental considerations 
throughout all phases of planning and execution. The environmental officer 
should contact key personnel in the AOR to obtain all available information on 
the beddown location, and participate in all surveys and assessments of the 
beddown location. Some key responsibilities include: (1) developing 
mitigation and preparation measures to address environmental hazards, (2) 
identifying required environmental knowledge/skills and conducting training, 
(3) obtaining needed equipment and supplies, (4) assist as required in 
preparing environmental annexes to support OPLANs and OPORDs, (5) 
developing and implementing environmental plans and site-specific operating 
procedures, (6) sustaining environmental standards, and (7) preparing 
operating locations for closure and transfer. Individuals selected to serve as 
environmental officers or on the environmental staff during deployments 
should pursue training through the Civil Engineer School at Air Force Institute 
of Technology (AFIT) prior to deploying. A list of courses available can be 
downloaded from their website at http://www.afit.edu/. 
1.5.5. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition Services. DLA 
Disposition Services provides on-site support within or near the AOR to 
manage disposal of HW. However, they are subject to applicable force 
protection and/or security concerns. DLA Disposition Services develops 
guidance on turn-in procedures for HW and excess HM. Attachment 7 
contains examples of documentation that may be required. Once turned in by 
U.S. forces, DLA Disposition Services is responsible for ensuring the HW is 
properly treated and disposed of in an environmentally safe manner. They 
determine the optimum HW treatment and disposal options for the AOR and 
ensure contracts achieve cost-effective disposal consistent with DOD's 
emphasis on environmental leadership. For additional information on DLA 
Disposition Services, go to http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/.  
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012

1.5.6. Contractors. Contractors providing services under a PWS must comply 
with DOD environmental regulations. Contractors are responsible for 
complying with pollution prevention, HM/HW management, solid waste 
disposal, waste minimization, recycling, spill response and reporting, and 
natural and cultural resource preservation standards included in contract 
statements. Contractors must include proposed methods to ensure compliance 
in the proposal and fully comply once the contract is initiated.  
1.5.7. Coalition Forces. U.S. forces work closely with forces from other 
nations during contingencies. When the U.S. is responsible for maintaining 
base operations, environmental considerations are integrated into plans and 
coalition forces are expected to adhere to guidelines expressed in these plans 
to protect the environment as well as the health and safety of all personnel. 
Coalition forces should also be knowledgeable of environmental guidance 
issued by the CCDR and ensure their personnel are provided environmental 
awareness training prior to and throughout multi-national military operations.

Chapter 2 
ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING 
 
2.1. Overview. Environmental factors have a significant impact on military 
operations and must be considered throughout all phases, from initial plans to 
site closure and redeployment. Planning identifies activities that pose risks to 
human health and safety or the environment, and provides commanders with 
alternatives to mitigate these effects. Although environmental considerations 
may not be a high priority initially, pollution prevention and environmental 
protection quickly takes on significance when the health of the force or local 
relations is adversely affected. Integrating environmental considerations is also 
essential to achieving U.S. strategic objectives. Past operations have shown 
when U.S. forces respect the environment and the local population has access 
to essential resources and infrastructure, they are less likely to support 
insurgent activities. This concern for the environment also contributes to local 
stability and reconstruction efforts. Figure 2.1. illustrates how engineers 
integrate environmental considerations into agile combat support (ACS) 
master processes (Ref: AFDD 4-0, Combat Support). Chapter 2 focuses on 
initial environmental planning conducted by civil engineers as part of overall 
ACS efforts to ready the force and prepare the battlespace.

2.2. Site Selection and Survey. The site selection and survey processes are 
critical aspects of planning. Site selection decisions are usually made at the 
operational level. AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning, 
governs the Expeditionary Site Planning (ESP) process. Once sites are 
selected, the Expeditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP), a subset of ESP, is 
used to guide the survey effort. A great deal of information on a proposed site 
may already be available as a result of previous deployments to the area. 
Aerial or space-based imagery may also be available. This data can be used as 
a starting point for the site survey. Site survey teams can be sourced from 
different organizations or AF Contingency Response Groups (CRGs) may be 
tasked. These units can be augmented by functional experts from other areas 
including Safety, Security Forces, Civil Engineer, Medical, Contracting, 
Communications, Fuels, Munitions, Legal, and Weather. The environmental 
officer should make every effort to be a part of the survey team to identify 
potential hazards and ensure environmental considerations are integrated into 
site layout and beddown planning. Key environmental factors should be 
addressed during the survey. Topography, hydrology, climate, cultural and 
historic resources, flora and fauna, natural resources, water sources and 
supplies, drainage, and water tables are examples of the factors to be 
considered (see EBS sample at Attachment 2). Industrial facilities located 
nearby should be examined to determine if operations could pose a health and 
safety hazard such as noise or pollution. This type of information is used to 
determine where to set up industrial activities, airfield support, storage, dining, 
billeting, etc., and what force health protection countermeasures need to be 
developed to address potential hazards associated with the environment. While 
planning, anticipate and designate potential expansion areas to allow for safe 
distances between airfield operations and personnel work and living areas. 
Also consider space needed to attain and maintain minimum force protection 
standoff distances. Existing resources that can be used to achieve 
environmental standards should be identified. This is also an opportunity to 
begin developing a list of equipment and supplies that will be needed (i.e., 
spill kits, drums, tarps, concertina wire, etc.) to manage HM/HW until 
resupplies begin to arrive or approval is granted to procure such items locally 
(see Attachment 5). The remainder of this chapter covers environmental 
aspects that should be considered during planning.

2.3. Geospatial Information Systems. GIS can be a force multiplier in 
conducting environmental planning and assessments if information is available 
for the proposed deployment location. GIS data saves commanders a 
considerable amount of time since all of the information needed to effectively 
plan does not have to be obtained through ground surveillance or from other 
potentially unreliable sources. The need to deploy reconnaissance forces into 
potentially dangerous areas to obtain information can be eliminated in some 
cases if GIS information is available. Keep in mind, however, GIS data 
analysis alone cannot suffice for a full-blown site survey where air, water, and 
soil sampling is conducted along with the identification of numerous other 
potential health threats. Satellite imagery can assist commanders with critical 
tasks such as terrain analysis and water source identification. The National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) provides satellite imagery (usually 
classified), often accompanied by reports outlining a variety of environmental 
factors for a particular location. These reports may also include historical data 
that will assist with site planning. GeoReach, an expeditionary site mapping 
tool, compiles all expeditionary site survey data into a single view. Contact the 
combatant command environmental staff to determine if this information is 
available for a particular site or region. The Air Force Special Operations 
Command (AFSOC) has developed a GIS tool that assesses risks at forward 
operating locations. The Global Situational Awareness Tool (GSAT) is an 
assessment model that aids the site selection process, unit basing, and troop 
movement planning. It integrates a variety of environmental, geographical, and 
epidemiological information with user-defined areas of interest to assess 
suitability, safety, and occupational health risks and provides alternatives for 
mitigating risks where possible. GSAT is designed to work with existing 
mapping and expeditionary basing tools, such as GeoReach, to provide risk 
reports and scalable effects maps of areas on surrounding airfields, 
encampments, and movement areas. It provides detailed reports, maps, and 
data that can be used to assess risks to personnel, health and readiness that 
might result from factors such as weather, flooding, soil composition, pests, 
industrial discharges, nuclear contamination, and endemic diseases. Contact 
the AFSOC Environmental Office or Command Surgeon to gain access to this 
information.

2.4. Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP). AFCAP is also 
a force multiplier. This contract option is used to augment civil engineer 
capabilities, principally in lesser contingencies and sustainment operations, 
when it is expected an operation will continue for an extended period of time 
(Figure 2.2.). AFCAP support generally cannot be used during initial 
beddown in high-threat environments. However, once combat operations begin 
to stabilize, AFCAP support can be used to help transition from initial facility 
and utility beddown standards to temporary or semi-permanent facilities and 
infrastructure. Contractors employed under this option will have access to any 
commercially available equipment (i.e., generators, HVAC equipment, 
vehicles, tools, etc.) and can assume management of critical functions such as 
Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) storage and distribution, solid waste 
(SW) management, HM Storage Area (HMSA), HW Storage Area (HWSA), 
pest and vegetation control, and limited cleanup activities. Employing AFCAP 
support increases the commander’s ability to integrate environmental 
considerations into day to day activities, reduce health, fire, and other safety 
hazards associated with environmental neglect, and improve the chances for 
mission success. The environmental officer should consider this option during 
the earliest stages of planning. Requests for AFCAP support are channeled 
through the MAJCOM Civil Engineer. For more information on AFCAP 
support capabilities, access the AFCESA website at: http://www.afcesa.af.mil/.

2.5. Environmental Plans. To ensure environmental considerations are 
continually addressed, site-specific environmental plans, or SOPs should be 
developed to include methods and procedures to address operations that can 
affect the environment and pose safety, fire, and health risks. AF 10-219 series 
pamphlets and 10-222 series handbooks cover many of the field expedient 
methods to address environmental concerns and much of the equipment that 
will be used during contingencies. Plans should reinforce higher level 
guidance and instruct personnel on accomplishing routine tasks in an 
environmentally safe manner. In developing plans, the Environmental Annex 
of the OPLAN or OPORD should always be used as a source of reference 
unless the CCDR specifies use of other guidance. Ideally, the Environmental 
Annex is developed using the EBS conducted on the area. If it was not used, 
planners will need both documents since the EBS describes existing 
infrastructure and environmental challenges and constraints. Use all data 
gathered on the deployed location to develop strategies to eliminate or mitigate 
the adverse effects military operations may have on personnel and the 
environment. Assumptions may need to be made when site data is lacking, 
however, this should be avoided if possible. Once plans are developed, 
personnel must be organized, trained, and equipped to perform assigned duties 
prior to deploying. Following are some plans that should be included in 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): 
 Plan for preventing the contingency site from being polluted   
 Plan for producing, testing, and managing field water supplies  
 Plan and methods treating, reusing, and disposing of wastewater  
 Plan for safe and proper disposal of non-hazardous SW 
 Plan to handle, transport, segregate, store, label and issue HM 
 Plan to handle, collect, segregate, store, label and dispose of HW 
 Plan to store, secure, issue petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL) 
 Plan for storing, segregating, treating, disposing of medical waste 
 Plan to store, secure, utilize and dispose of pesticides/equipment 
 Plan for spill prevention, response, containment, and cleanup 
 Plan to minimize the impact of storm water on water resources 
 Plan to minimize air pollution resulting from military activities 
 Plan to protect/preserve natural, cultural, and historical sites 
 Plan to protect and preserve flora and fauna within the region 
 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012

2.6. Planning Considerations. Many factors are considered in developing 
environmental plans. Some examples include: (1) the operational threat 
environment, (2) locally available resources, and (3) local support available. 
Lack of a functioning government affects planning also since this contributes 
to environmental degradation due to environment laws or standards not being 
enforced. Planners should address many factors and develop workarounds for 
limiting factors that could affect the mission. Plans should address how units 
will adhere 
to applicable environmental 
requirements, international 
agreements, and guidance issued by the CCDR. This is also the time to 
develop a site closure plan that addresses any areas where some cleanup may 
be needed and HM/HW turn-in procedures. If contract support will be 
available, generic performance work statements can be developed for the 
support needed and tailored for the site and location once initial beddown 
actions have been completed. Following are some considerations for 
environmental planners:   
 Level of support from local population (hostile, cooperative, etc.) 
 Applicable international agreements, CCDR environmental guidance 
 Climate conditions of the region, including seasonal weather hazards 
 Safe and adequate water resources, location, and means of protection 
 Soil type/percolation rates on construction and waste management 
 Potential impact of natural and/or cultural resources on the mission 
 Potential impact of regional precipitation and flood plains 
 Impact of vectors and poisonous or dangerous rodents and animals 
 Potential for existence of unexploded ordnance or depleted uranium 
 Potential for site contamination from previous occupation/activities 
 Potential for contamination from off-base/local industrial plants 
 Potential for water source contamination from storm water runoff 
 Potential for air pollution from the site or nearby industrial activities 
 Potential for noise pollution from the site or nearby local activities 
 Resources needed/available to support HM/HW management 
 Resources needed/available to support wastewater management 
 Resources needed/available to support SW management 
 Resources needed/available to support medical waste management 
 Resources needed to close site as described in the site closure plan

23 
 
2.7. Risk Management. Risk Management is an effective method for ensuring 
all environmental concerns are addressed and should be integrated into all 
planning activities. Environmental risk management can be used to identify 
when, where, and how health and safety of personnel might be affected by 
environmental conditions and identify those activities that may cause damage 
to the environment and to what extent. These factors could be addressed 
during the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) or Environmental 
Baseline Survey (EBS), discussed later in this chapter. With this knowledge, 
commanders can quantify the risks, detect problem areas, and adjust plans or 
put in place controls to minimize adverse effects on personnel and the 
environment without jeopardizing the mission. Further guidance on risk 
management can be found in AFTTP 3-2.34, Risk Management.  
2.8. Environmental Training. Prior to deploying, individuals should receive 
training on environmental health hazards and ways to protect themselves and 
the environment. Training should include all protective measures outlined in 
environmental annexes, international treaties, SOPs, job-related hazards, spill 
prevention and response, use of MSDSs, first aid procedures, HM/HW storage, 
handling, and transportation, field sanitation, and personal health and hygiene. 
Those who will have duties requiring them to certify HM/HW shipments 
should also attend HM/HW certification courses. In addition the BCE 
environmental officer and staff may require additional training on 
environmental considerations during contingencies and HM/HW operations 
and emergency response actions. Courses are available through the AFIT, 
USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM), and U.S. Army 
Environmental Command (USAEC).           
2.9. Effective Documentation. The key to effective environmental planning is 
documentation. Planners need to obtain all information available on proposed 
beddown locations. In many cases the combatant command environmental 
staff and the servicing Logistics Plans office may already have survey data. 
There are also automated tools and databases that may contain needed data. If 
no information has been previously collected, surveys, photos, Geospatial 
Information Systems (GIS) information, Global Positioning System (GPS) 
data, and local interviews are some methods planners can use to collect and 
record environmental data throughout the course of planning. 
 
 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012

2.10. Surveys and Reports. Several surveys and reports are usually required 
when assessing potential beddown locations. Many surveys have already been 
conducted over multiple regions of the world, as well as past and potential 
beddown locations. This information is typically available at the Major 
Command (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit 
level and can be used for environmental planning. Following are surveys and 
reports conducted and prepared to assist the headquarters environmental staff 
in determining the adequacy of proposed beddown locations. 
2.10.1. Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessment 
(OEHSA). The OEHSA is normally the first report prepared for a potential 
deployment location. It is usually prepared by AF Bioenvironmental Engineers 
or the U.S. Army Public Health Command (USAPHC). The OEHSA is 
conducted in accordance with AFMAN 48-154. The purpose of the OEHSA is 
to identify any contaminants present, disease vectors, or environmental 
conditions that may pose health risks. During the assessment, medical 
personnel identify areas of concern where deployed personnel may become 
exposed to hazards such as radiological or other hazardous waste burial or 
storage sites, known contamination and pollution affecting the air, soil and/or 
water sources, climate conditions, etc. The report will contain results from 
soil, air, surface water, and drinking water sampling. In addition, industrial 
facilities such as chemical or power plants located near the potential site are 
examined to determine if current operations or accidental releases could result 
in catastrophic risk to deployed personnel.

2.10.2. Environmental Assessments, Impact Statements, Studies, and 
Reviews. Executive Order (E.O.) 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of 
Major Federal Actions, requires environmental impacts to be considered when 
planning federal actions outside U.S. territory. DOD Directive (DODD) 
6050.7, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Department of Defense 
Actions, implements E.O. 12114 and requires preparation of an environmental 
assessment prior to a major federal action that will significantly affect the 
environment of the global commons (i.e., geographic areas outside the 
jurisdiction of any nation, such as the oceans outside territorial limits, outer 
space, and Antarctica). The assessment is used to determine if an 
environmental impact statement  is required.  For major actions that will 
significantly affect the environment of a foreign nation or protected global 
resource, the DODD requires preparation of an environmental study or 
environmental review. The E.O. and DODD exempt certain actions from their 
EIAP requirements.  The exemptions include actions taken at the direction of 
the President or SECDEF in the course of armed conflict or when either 
national security or national interest is involved. If a proposed action is 
covered by an exemption, the proponent should document the exemption 
status before taking the actions. An AF Form 813, memorandum for record, or 
other signed written statement can be used to document the exemption. The 
exemptions also include disaster and emergency relief actions. Procedures for 
analysis of environmental actions abroad are contained in 32 CFR Part 989, 
Environmental Impact Analysis Process and DODD 6050.7. This directive 
provides 
comprehensive 
policies, 
definitions, 
and 
procedures 
for 
implementing E.O. 12114. The JA, MAJCOMs, and CCDR’s environmental 
staff can assist in determining environmental requirements.  
2.10.2.1. Engineer planners assist in performing a risk analysis to include an 
assessment of military actions that may result in unnecessary damage or 
destruction to the environment and/or pose imminent and substantial danger to 
the health of U.S. forces or the local population. Limiting unnecessary 
environmental damage can increase the overall chance of mission success. 
2.10.2.2. Engineers can assist operational planners by providing an assessment 
of potential consequences of targeting certain infrastructure such as industrial 
or chemical plants that may result in hazards that threaten personnel health and 
safety. Planners also consider time and effort required to repair infrastructure 
for use by friendly forces or in support of stability operations.  
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
26 
 
2.10.3. Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS). The EBS is a multi-
disciplinary survey of air, soil, surface water, and groundwater sources at 
potential beddown locations. It should be conducted prior to deploying, along 
with the initial site reconnaissance. If this is not possible, it must be conducted 
immediately upon arrival. Its purpose is to document existing environmental 
conditions, determine the potential for past and present site contamination, and 
identify environmental hazards that may affect personnel health and safety. 
Potential hazards could include existing problems with quality of air, water, 
soils, terrain, weather, presence of HM/HW, sensitive cultural sites, or threats 
from animals, insects, or plants. Planners assess the risks associated with 
hazards and develop solutions or strategies to eliminate or mitigate the effects. 
In addition to protecting personnel health, the EBS can help commanders 
identify type and scope of contamination caused by U.S. forces. In conducting 
an EBS, use of all available tools such as satellite imagery and aerial 
photography should be considered. Surveyors address environmental data such 
as pollution, geography, water sources, soil characteristics (Figure 2.4.), 
previous use, and local population. Field Manual (FM) 3-100.4, 
Environmental Considerations in Military Operations, contains guidance on 
preparing the EBS for contingency operations. Instructions are also provided 
in Attachment 2. However, always review the environmental annex of the 
OPORD and check with the CCDR’s environmental staff for specific guidance 
on preparing and staffing the EBS.

2.10.4. Environmental Condition Report (ECR). The ECR is a concise 
summary of environmental conditions at a site, supported by maps, ground and 
aerial photographs, and backup documents (Figure 2.5.). An ECR can be 
prepared periodically to document existing site conditions or when a 
potentially significant environmental incident such as a spill occurs. It 
provides "interim snapshots" of site conditions over a period of time and 
documents the types of HM/HW stored at the site. The ECR can be used as a 
situation report, and should be used as a reference document to complete the 
site closure report. Along with the EBS and closure reports, the ECR can help 
defend the U.S. from pressure to remediate or pay for environmental damages 
at sites used by U.S. forces during contingency operations. See Attachment 3 
for the ECR format. 
Figure 2.5. Environmental Condition Report. 
 
2.10.5. Closure Report. The closure report is prepared upon notification that a 
site is to be abandoned. It is used to document post-occupation environmental 
conditions at a particular site. This report is compared to the EBS prepared 
upon initial occupation to determine what contamination resulted from 
activities conducted by U.S. forces at the beddown location. The closure report 
can protect the U.S. against unsubstantiated claims of environmental damage. 
The report should include photographs and detailed information on all 
environmental factors (e.g. quality and condition of air, water, soils, natural 
resources, and cultural and historic properties) considered during the initial 
EBS. Every topic covered in the EBS should be covered in the closure report.

2.11. Pollution Prevention (P2). Without proper emphasis on P2, it won’t 
take long before bad habits lead to extensive environmental degradation 
(Figure 2.6.). P2 is the preferred means of protecting the environment and 
complying with applicable environmental laws, international agreements, 
military orders, and guidance during contingencies. Early planning efforts 
should focus on training and resources needed to prevent or minimize 
environmental degradation and exposure to environmental hazards. Leaders 
should place strong emphasis on ensuring every individual is aware of their 
responsibilities to prevent pollution, and provide the resources needed to 
support this effort. One of the goals of P2 is to reduce the amount of hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste generated at the source. To achieve this objective, 
environmental planners should focus on practicable solutions such as waste-to-
energy technology, product substitution, procedural changes, conservation, 
reuse, and recycling. Identifying effective pollution prevention requirements 
early ensures commanders are able to minimize the impact of military 
activities on the environment and personnel health and safety, and lessens the 
need to expend valuable time and resources for costly site cleanup activities. 
Requisition equipment and supplies (Attachment 5) during initial planning 
and ship the items with the operational equipment. If the site is already 
occupied by U.S. or coalition forces, contact the personnel involved with 
environmental functions to get as much information as possible. This will help 
determine what will be needed immediately upon arrival.

2.12. Water Sources. A safe and adequate supply of water must be available 
for deployed personnel. Planners must ensure all water sources identified are 
approved by the BEE, and develop a plan for purifying, storing, testing, 
transporting, and distributing potable water to predetermined water points 
(Figure 2.7.). Ensure there are adequate resources for purification, storage, 
and distribution. Also, factor in the amount of water that will be needed to 
sustain any anticipated buildup.  Population estimates will be needed in order 
to calculate the amount of potable water needed to be produced and stored to 
sustain the anticipated force, including contractors and local personnel directly 
supporting the mission. While developing estimates, it is also important to 
determine the effect use of natural water resources will have on the local 
population. Consult the BEE to ensure there will be sufficient space between 
water resources and other planned activities such as leach fields, retention 
ponds, HM\HW storage, and waste disposal activities. The BEE is also 
consulted to determine when and where water purification and testing can be 
conducted. To ensure personnel health and safety, potable water supplies must 
always be tested for temperature, total dissolved solids, turbidity, chlorine 
residual, pH, and presence of bacteria. The BEE determines the potability of 
drinking water. For specific guidance on establishing and maintaining a 
potable water production capability and testing procedures during 
deployments, refer to AFPAM 10-219, Volume 5, Bare Base Conceptual 
Planning Guide, and AFMAN 48-138_IP, Sanitary Control and Surveillance 
of Field Water Supplies.

2.13. Wastewater. Wastewater generated during contingency operations can 
total 16 gallons per person per day. Estimates of black water (predominantly 
human waste) and gray water (wastewater from showers, laundry, kitchen, 
etc.) that will require collection, treatment, and disposal must be considered in 
deployment planning. Identifying expedient methods and supplies needed to 
manage wastewater early will minimize unsanitary and working conditions 
that pose significant risks to personnel health and safety. If expeditionary 
methods are used to manage wastewater, site latrines, dining facility (DFACs), 
laundry facilities, leach fields and ponds at least 30 meters (100 feet) 
downgradient from water sources, intakes, and surface bodies of water. Leach 
fields and ponds should also be downwind of living and work areas. Always 
consult the BEE when siting wastewater management and disposal activities. 
Consider use of individual waste aggregation bags for solid human waste in 
the very early stages, since the bags are biodegradable, spill-proof, and can be 
disposed of in any landfill. Plan to separate gray and black water storage and 
treatment areas, and consider constructing a gray water collection pond 
(Figure 2.8.) to collect and use gray water for activities not requiring potable 
water such as dust suppression or construction activities. Depending on usage, 
gray water may need to be treated (BEE makes this determination) before 
using it for other purposes. It’s also important to minimize the impact of U.S. 
forces’ wastewater activities on the local water supply. For details on 
constructing field expedient wastewater collection and treatment systems, see 
AFH 10-222, Volume 1, Civil Engineer Bare Base Development, and FM 21-
10, Field Hygiene and Sanitation.

2.14. Solid Waste. During contingency operations, expeditionary bases can 
generate 9 to 12 pounds of SW per person per day. At this rate, it won’t be 
long before piles of garbage begin to threaten the health and safety of 
personnel. DOD policy requires operational commanders to develop and 
approve a SW Management Plan (SWMP) for each contingency operation. 
This SWMP should be developed as early as possible, particularly when plans 
indicate a relatively high base population and the duration of the operation is 
unknown. If determined by previous site surveys that local contracting might 
be available, coordinate these efforts as soon as possible, including force 
protection requirements. If the local contract option is not available, engineers 
will have to implement expedient methods to manage SW disposal consistent 
with the SWMP. Expedient methods include landfills, incinerators, and burn 
pits; although DOD policy imposes restrictions on the use of burn pits 
(reference DODI 4715.19, Use of Open-Air Burn Pits in Contingency 
Operations). DODI 4715.19 states open-air burn pits are designated for the 
purpose of disposing of solid waste by burning in the outdoor air at a location 
with more than 100 attached or assigned personnel and that is in place longer 
than 90 days. SW plans should include provisions to transition to a more 
acceptable means of disposal. This becomes particularly important as bases 
mature and populations surge. Landfills can be constructed to dispose of SW 
and/or ash created by burn pits and incinerators. Whatever method(s) used, 
SW disposal activities should be sited in the predominate downwind direction 
and a safe horizontal distance from personnel and water sources, probable 
inversion layers, away from areas with high water tables, channels, creeks, and 
areas significantly impacted by storm water runoff (always consult the BEE 
when siting these activities). Consider soil characteristics; look at topography, 
soil permeability, potential for runoff, etc. Keep in mind SW activities attract 
rodents, snakes, etc., and must be considered in pest management plans and 
coordinated with the Public Health (PH) staff.

2.15. Hazardous Material/Hazardous Waste. HM include any material, 
based on chemical or physical characteristics (i.e., corrosive, explosive, 
flammable, reactive, toxic) that pose a threat to human health and/or the 
environment if improperly disposed of, handled, stored, labeled, or 
transported. As described in the OEBGD, HW are discarded material that may 
be solid, semi-solid, liquid, or contained gas and exhibits a hazardous 
characteristic (i.e., ignitability, corrosivity, toxicity or reactivity). Ignitable 
wastes are any liquids having a flashpoint less than 140°F; any non-liquids 
capable of causing a fire through friction, absorption of moisture; or any 
ignitable compressed gas (reference 40 CFR 261.21 and Appendix 1 of the 
OEBGD). Corrosive wastes consist of acids and bases with a pH less than 2 or 
greater than 12.5. Toxic wastes, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 
asbestos, and lead-based paint contain certain levels of specific materials that 
are harmful to living organisms. Reactive wastes include unstable materials 
such as munitions and other explosive components. Proper management of 
HM/HW will reduce personnel injuries and help to protect valuable resources 
and the environment. Some HM used extensively during contingencies include 
POL, batteries, antifreeze, bleach, grease, solvents, and paints. During 
planning, HM/HW storage areas (Figure 2.10.), supplies, and equipment (i.e. 
containers, spill kits, PPE, etc.) needed immediately upon arrival must be 
identified (always consult the fire dept and BEE when siting these activities). 
Planners also develop SOPs for HM/HW management, including procedures 
and training on spill prevention and response (see paragraph 3.8.) for 
personnel who will handle or be exposed to HM/HW. Information on 
managing HM/HW can be downloaded from the DENIX website and the Air 
Force

Engineering

2.16. Regulated Medical Waste (RMW). RMW (also referred to as 
infectious medical waste) are those wastes generated from medical and dental 
treatment of human beings or animals that are potentially capable of causing 
disease. RMW includes cultures and stocks of infectious agents; pathological 
wastes including human tissues, organs, amputated limbs or other body parts; 
blood, blood products, or body fluids; contaminated animal carcasses and body 
parts; and sharps, including needles, syringes, scalpels, and blades. RMW 
must be separated from general waste at the point of origin since handling, 
storage, and disposal procedures differ significantly from other types of 
wastes. Plan to store RMW near medical units and make sure these areas can 
be secured (Figure 2.11.). For pathological wastes, factor in space for power 
generators and refrigeration units needed for storage. Also plan for space 
needed to store supplies, including spill and cleanup kits, medical storage 
bags, sharps containers, storage drums, PPE, etc. If contract disposal will not 
be immediately available, plan to set aside an area near the SW disposal 
facility to set up an incinerator. Also ensure equipment will be available to 
construct a berm or fence around the area to prevent unauthorized access. For 
additional information on RMW, refer to U.S. Army Technical Guide 177, A 
Commander’s Guide to Regulated Medical Waste Management.

2.17. Pest Management. Historically, DNBI accounts for the majority of 
battlefield admission to medical facilities. Planners must focus on identifying 
entomological hazards in the deployment region. Of primary concern are 
vector-borne diseases carried by arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, and 
mites. Additional hazards include biting/stinging arthropods (fire ants, spiders, 
scorpions, etc.), rodents, snakes, bats, birds, and poisonous plants. Although 
initial protection will rely on personal protective measures such as repellants 
and netting, a vector management plan for use of pesticides should be 
developed in consultation with BEE and PH, and integrated into the applicable 
OPORD. Once the plan is developed, review the AFPMB contingency 
pesticide list at: http://www.afpmb.org/content/dod-standard-pesticides-and-
pest-control-equipment to obtain equipment and supplies needed prior to 
deploying. TG 24 contains information on emergency procurement of 
pesticides and equipment. Consider space needed for mixing pesticides 
(Figure 2.12.), storage of safety equipment/supplies, secondary containment, 
conducting pest management activities far from personnel and water sources, 
etc. Plan for fencing to control access and storm water retention areas to 
control contamination runoff.  Plan to treat leach fields, ponds, and storm 
water retention areas. Designate an area adjacent to the SW disposal area to 
incinerate and/or bury pests found on the site. Remember to consult the Fire 
Department, Safety, BEE and PH when planning to site pest management 
facilities. The AFPMB maintains a wealth of information on controlling pests 
and disease vectors during contingency operations.

2.18. Storm Water. Planning for storm water is critical to determining the 
amount of equipment and supplies that may be needed immediately upon 
arrival. Storm water is precipitation that runs off impervious surfaces and does 
not naturally infiltrate the soil. As a result, it eventually flows into lakes, 
rivers, streams, and other bodies of water. This happens either naturally or by 
conveyance as a means to prevent flooding and eliminate standing water in 
certain areas (Figure 2.13.). Storm water can carry contaminants, such as 
suspended solids, plastic bags, detergents, heavy metals, chemicals, biological 
contaminants, and other pollutants, directly into natural water resources. These 
pollutants can come from several sources including HM/HW storages areas, 
maintenance facilities, fuel points, construction sites, and landfills. 
Additionally, water pooling in areas that can become breeding grounds for 
disease-carrying insects is another health concern. During planning, consider 
factors such as soil permeability and natural features that minimize the impact 
of storm water runoff. Although these and other factors should be considered 
during site selection, the flexibility to avoid certain areas during contingencies 
may not always be available. Plans must be made to minimize the impact of 
storm water runoff on natural water sources and in camp areas.

2.19. Air Pollution. In the U.S., where strict environmental laws are in place 
to govern activities that contribute to air pollution, safe air to breathe might be 
taken for granted. For military operations in foreign countries, the quality of 
air is of significant importance. Military operations suffer if DNBI rates 
caused by air pollution in foreign countries begin to take a toll on personnel. 
This potential hazard must be considered by civil engineer, safety, BEE, and 
PH personnel during planning and site selection. The EBS and OEHSA will 
provide crucial information concerning the quality of air in the proposed 
region of deployment. If these reports were previously prepared, they will be 
invaluable for planning. All of the information gathered about the site should 
be used to develop strategies to minimize the impact of air pollution on the 
health of deployed personnel. Nearby industrial plants (Figure 2.14.) that use 
toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in their processes could pose a significant 
health risk to personnel and must be considered during planning. Chapter 3 
contains information that can help minimize air pollution during initial stages 
of contingency operations. Chapter 4 provides additional information and 
guidance focused on integrating environmental practices into daily operations 
and further protecting the environment and the health of deployed personnel.

2.20. Historical and Cultural Resources. Historical and cultural resources 
(including archeological sites and assets) are preserved for the inspiration and 
benefit of the country’s citizens. The National Historic Preservation Act 
requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings 
on resources included on the World Heritage List or the host nation’s 
equivalent of the National Register of Historic Places. Because of their value 
to the country or international community, these assets could restrict beddown 
plans and limit certain military activities. While planning, research all sources 
of information available on the region, contact personnel in the AOR, and 
query the local population during the site survey, if feasible, to obtain 
information about such assets in the region. Map these areas (i.e., districts, 
sites, buildings, miscellaneous structures, etc.) in relation to proposed 
beddown locations. Attempt to site military activities at least 50 meters (165 
feet) from these areas. Consider developing a plan to protect these areas by 
making personnel aware of these assets and developing SOPs that can be 
integrated into official environmental guidance applicable to the military 
operation. If any operation may result in damage or destruction to these assets, 
commanders must be made aware and given the opportunity to make 
adjustments to plans and/or balance this factor against the need to maintain 
operational capability. Since engineers may be tasked to provide targeting or 
basing recommendations during operational planning, they should also be 
familiar with international laws such as the 1954 Hague Convention for the 
Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. This 
convention provides planners with a good base of reference for use in 
balancing military necessity with the need to protect these assets to the greatest 
extent possible. 
 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012

2.21. Natural Resources. Natural resources includes those naturally occurring 
resources such as air, land, lakes, streams, rivers, oceans, flood plains, 
marshlands, fossil fuels, rock, mineral resources, and forestry (Figure 2.15.). 
Natural resources also include raw materials such as natural gas, petroleum, 
coal, gold, copper, lead, iron ore and salt. These resources are essential for 
human survival, possess significant value, and can sometimes cause conflicts 
between nations. In addition to a means of survival, the abundance or lack of 
natural resources can also determine a nation’s wealth and prosperity. To avoid 
loss of support and alienating or angering the local population, these resources 
must be respected to the greatest extent possible during contingencies. Two 
ways to accomplish this is by focusing on conservation and preservation. 
Conservation involves sustainable use of natural resources. If natural resources 
are renewable the focus would be on ensuring they are not consumed faster 
than they can be replaced. For nonrenewable natural resources such as fossil 
fuels, the focus would be on ensuring these resources are available for future 
use. Preservation focuses on maintaining natural resources and not affecting 
them at all (e.g. wetlands). Conserving and preserving natural resources should 
always be a key consideration. Unnecessary damage, depletion, or exploitation 
of natural resources could threaten the livelihood of local populations, 
destabilize the country, and make it difficult to achieve U.S. strategic 
objectives.

39 
 
2.22. Flora and Fauna. Flora and fauna include all plant and animal life 
found in a particular region (Figure 2.16.). Although mission needs take 
precedence during contingencies, care must be taken to avoid unnecessary 
damage or destruction to flora and fauna significant to the country’s pride and 
culture. Implement plans to eliminate or minimize the impact of military 
operations on these assets to ensure continued local support and access to 
strategically important areas. Efforts should be made to avoid conducting 
noncritical military operations and siting risky activities such as HM/HW 
storage and fueling points near sensitive areas, particularly endangered species 
habitats. Military personnel should also be aware of international and U.S. 
laws governing wildlife trade. The Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), U.S. Endangered 
Species Act, and the Defense Travel Regulation (DTR) prohibit military 
personnel from purchasing or transporting products made from or containing 
parts of threatened or endangered species. Planners should research flora and 
fauna for the deployment region, consider potential environmental impacts of 
activities in or near these areas, advise commanders, and develop appropriate 
plans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) maintains 
the world’s most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of 
plant and animal species, referred to as the “Red List”. This is a good place to 
start research on flora and fauna for a particular country or region. The IUCN 
website can be accessed at http://www.iucn.org/.

Chapter 3 
INITIAL BEDDOWN 
 
3.1. Overview. Initial beddown actions by engineers underpin ACS efforts to 
position the force and employ the force. This stage is usually characterized 
by austere facilities and limited supplies and equipment which could 
complicate environmental protective efforts. This chapter covers actions that 
can be taken during initial beddown to ensure personnel health and minimize 
degrading effects on the environment. The Environmental Officer (with 
assistance from FES, EM, BEE, and PH) should begin conducting awareness 
training. As a minimum, everyone should be familiar with: (1) environmental 
guidance issued by the CCDR; (2) the site environmental SOP; (3) handling 
hazardous materials/waste; (4) use of PPE; (5) spill response and reporting; (6) 
maneuver restrictions, (7) vector hazards; (8) endangered species; (9) cultural 
and historic assets; and (10) applicable international agreements and treaties. 
Personnel regularly working with or exposed to HM or appointed to respond 
during emergencies such as spills should receive advanced training (e.g., 
HAZCOM, HAZWOPER). Following are some key tasks for integrating 
environmental considerations during initial beddown:  
 Establish environmental continuity (SOPs, contacts, file plans, etc.) 
 Appoint trained personnel to manage HMSA and HWSA 
 Appoint UECs to manage and oversee unit environmental activities 
 Appoint spill teams and conduct spill prevention/response training 
 Appoint trained personnel to manage burn pit and landfill operations 
 Establish plan to manage SW, potable water, gray water, black water 
 Requisition any additional sustainment equipment/supplies needed 
 Assess whether proposed site layout might threaten personnel health 
or safety, or the environment, and make necessary recommendations  
 Focus on pollution prevention; begin monitoring site activities 
 Research ideas for SW/HM/HW substitution, reduction, recycling 
 Initiate research on disposal options via DLA or local contract 
 Site industrial facilities and noisy equipment away from high use 
facilities, billeting, and work, construct barriers to minimize noise    
 
 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
41 
 
3.2. Pollution Prevention. The preferred means of protecting human health 
and the environment is through P2. During initial beddown, the operational 
tempo is high and the focus is primarily on generating the mission. However, 
force protection (including environmental health and safety) should always 
underpin all military activities. If environmental considerations are not 
immediately integrated, the environment will become degraded very quickly, 
personnel health will begin to suffer, and safety problems will escalate. 
Individuals should understand the difficulties in relying on a contaminated and 
polluted environment to maintain health and accomplish the mission. 
Following are some considerations for minimizing the impact of pollution on 
personnel health and safety during initial beddown:  
 Conduct pollution prevention training for all personnel on site 
 Identify pollution sources; develop goals for reduction/elimination 
 Develop site-specific P2 plan in conjunction with PH, BEE, Safety 
 Establish HMSA/HWSA; appoint trained personnel to manage 
 Ensure HMSA/HWSA located away from billeting and work areas 
 Ensure liners and secondary containment used at HMSA/HWSA 
 Resist stockpiling, particularly HM; maintain only what is needed 
 Appoint and train spill prevention/response team; conduct exercises  
 Assist HW generators to establish HW accumulation points 
 Encourage recycling/conservation; focus on HM/HW/SW/water 
 Strongly encourage reuse of hazardous and non-hazardous materials  
 Prohibit wastes from being improperly dumped/buried on site 
 Establish SW activities downwind/downgradient of water sources 
 Properly site burn pits/landfills; research SW disposal alternatives 
 Separate RMW at point of generation and consult BEE on disposal 
 Properly site latrines; ensure treatment and disposal of human waste 
 Construct leach fields at a lower elevation, far from water sources 
 Construct holding ponds at a lower elevation, far from living areas 
 Maintain native vegetation if possible to reduce erosion, control dust   
 Collect, treat, and reuse gray water for vegetation and dust control

42 
 
3.3. Water Sources. Very few activities will take on more importance than 
establishing a safe supply of potable water during initial beddown. If this is not 
done immediately, the entire operation could be in jeopardy. Water sources 
must be identified and approved by medical personnel with assistance from 
civil engineers during planning and while conducting pre-deployment site 
surveys. Considering these sources may be scarce and demand is usually high 
during contingencies, engineers must work closely with BEE, PH, Safety, Fire 
Department, and Security personnel to ensure water sources are adequate to 
support the expected population and are protected from intentional or 
unintentional contamination. Refer to AFMAN 48-138_IP for details on 
managing field water supplies. Following are key points to consider in 
managing water resources during the early stages of deployments: 
 Develop site-specific SOP for managing water supplies/resources  
 Test several water sources to determine the sources of higher quality 
 Ensure all water sources have been approved by medical personnel 
 Ensure all treated water is certified as potable by medical personnel 
 Establish water storage and water points; include alternate locations 
 Routinely test water supply points (tanks, trailers, bladders, etc.) 
 Frequently test water sources and water supplies for contamination 
 Protect source from contamination from soil erosion/storm water 
 Plan to secure and protect water sources from intentional sabotage 
 Designate a secure and covered area to store bottled water supplies 
 Ensure control/surveillance of water supplies per AFMAN 48-138 
 Test distribution points (showers, laundry, etc.) for contamination 
 Use local support for water requirements if agreed upon and approved 
 Absent local support, establish in-house water purification operation 
 Ensure waste disposal activities are downgradient of water sources 
 Ensure refueling operations are as far from water sources as possible 
 Minimize refueling operations over raw water sources if possible 
 Closely monitor quantity of water purification equipment/supplies 
 Clean and disinfect water storage/distribution equipment regularly 
 Encourage water conservation based on resource availability

3.4. Wastewater. Wastewater is typically separated into different types, in-
cluding gray water and black water (human waste). Although it is preferable to 
connect to existing wastewater treatment and disposal facilities or use portable 
latrines or holding tanks with local service support, the operational environ-
ment or existing infrastructure may make this difficult. Upon arrival at the de-
ployed site, technicians may need to immediately begin employing expedient 
methods to manage wastewater for kitchen, shower, and latrine facilities. Ex-
amples of expedient methods include use of BEAR assets, burnout latrines, 
pipe urinals, sewage treatment lagoons, gray water lagoons, evaporation 
ponds, and soakage pits or trenches. In addition to guidance in Chapter 2, de-
tailed guidance for managing wastewater during contingencies can be down-
loaded from the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) or the 
USAPHC website.

44 
 
3.4.1. Gray Water. Gray water is the by-product of activities such as showers, 
laundries and kitchens. It is captured in a variety of ways for treatment/reuse 
or disposal. Due to limited supply of potable water in field environments, it 
may be necessary to treat and reuse gray water for activities that do not 
demand potable water. Gray water from showers and laundry facilities can be 
treated and reused for washing vehicles, vegetation, fire fighting, dust 
suppression, construction activities, etc. This reduces the volume of 
wastewater requiring disposal. If current expeditionary assets cannot be 
configured for this purpose, commercial plumbing assets can be used to direct 
gray water into collection areas, or it can be stored in bladders or tanks, then 
pumped out and transported to collection areas for treatment. There may be 
some restrictions on gray water reuse. For example, medical authorities may 
only allow gray water from showers and laundries to be recycled back to the 
generating activities. Requirements for treating and reusing gray water can be 
found on the USAFSAM and USAPHC websites. Gray water produced from 
kitchen activities such as food preparation and sanitation is heavily 
contaminated with food particles, cooking oils, grease, detergents, and other 
cleaning agents, and usually cannot be reused for other non-potable purposes. 
For disposal, gray water should be conveyed to evaporation or absorption pits, 
or evaporation lagoons via transport, plumbing, trenches, etc. Following are 
considerations for managing gray water during initial beddown:  
 Erect field expeditionary assets for use in managing wastewater  
 Designate areas for soakage pits and trenches for gray water disposal 
 Perform soil percolation test on areas designated for pits/trenches 
 Use grease traps to remove fats, oil, grease from kitchen wastewater 
 Construct soakage pits near DFAC to avoid transporting wastewater 
 Provide two pits to allow a rest period for each pit every other day 
 Use trenches if the groundwater table is too high for soakage pits 
 Use evaporation beds in hot/dry climates with bad soil percolation 
 Build enough evaporation beds to flood each one on successive days 
 Inspect areas for standing water; could indicate bad soil percolation 
 Locate gray water collection areas downstream of water sources 
 Devise a method to convey gray water to collection areas 
 Collect, treat, reuse nonpotable gray water for approved activities 
 Include gray water collection areas in pest management program 
 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
45 
 
3.4.2. Black Water (Human Waste). Black water refers to latrine water 
containing human waste. If not properly handled, this waste can become 
extremely hazardous to human health. Black water must be collected and 
disposed of in a manner that best protects personnel health under the existing 
operational environment. Effective treatment and disposal will prevent the 
spread of disease and ensure the site does not become infested with flies, rats, 
and other vermin that cause diseases such as dysentery (amoebic and 
bacillary), typhoid, paratyphoid, and cholera. Preferred methods include use of 
existing sanitary latrines, sewers, and treatment plants, BEAR assets, or locally 
serviced chemical latrines. When these options are unavailable or not feasible, 
expedient methods are employed using, evaporation ponds, sewage treatment 
lagoons, or package wastewater treatment plants. Additional guidance on 
managing human waste during contingencies can be found in TB MED 593, 
the Environmental Annex of OPLANs, or specific guidance issued by the 
CCDR. Following are some considerations for managing black water during 
contingencies:    
 Consider connecting to a local wastewater treatment system 
 Consider portable facilities with local servicing support 
 Consider on-site packaged wastewater treatment plant 
 Recover/transport waste to on-site or off-site disposal facility 
 Determine if any applicable guidance prohibits expedient latrines 
 Base type of latrines on location, duration, climate, legal restrictions 
 Site latrines at least 100ft downhill and downwind of DFAC, water 
sources, and billeting areas 
 Coordinate with the PAM team (BEE, PH) on the amount, type, and 
proposed location of expedient latrines 
 Build 1 commode/urinal per 25 males; 1 commode per 17 females 
 Construct separate latrine facilities for urination/defecation 
 Construct screens around latrines to prevent filth fly breeding 
 Conduct open burning of human waste downwind of populated areas 
 Ensure field hand washing devices are located adjacent to latrines 
 Include all latrine areas in pest management program 
 Construct lagoons for physical, biological, chemical treatment 
 Locate sewage lagoons at least ½ mile from populated centers  
 Include black water collection areas in pest management program

3.5. Solid Waste. Considering that expeditionary sites can generate 9-12 lbs of 
SW per person per day, SW buildup can quickly become a health hazard 
during contingency operations, attracting dangerous animals and disease-
carrying insects. Examples of solid wastes include construction debris, 
aluminum, paper, cardboard, packing materials, plastic bottles, food waste, 
and scrap wood. Under ideal conditions, a local contract could be acquired and 
a property holding area (PHA) established to manage SW generated by 
military operations. However, support from the local population may not be 
integrated into operations until the region is stabilized, and local contracting 
may not be an option if the infrastructure cannot support the site’s SW 
disposal requirements or the operational environment makes this option 
impractical. Initially, engineers will have to implement expedient methods to 
manage SW disposal. Expedient methods used to dispose of SW can include 
burn pits, landfills, and incinerators. However, plans should consider 
initiatives such as waste minimization, reuse, recycling, and composting to 
reduce the amount of SW requiring disposal. Composting operations should 
not be located within 1,200 feet of aircraft operations and should not include 
food wastes that could attract wildlife. Additional information on managing 
SW during contingencies can be found in TB MED 593, Guidelines for Field 
Waste Management, or downloaded from the USAFSAM or USAPHC 
website. Following are considerations for SW management during initial 
beddown: 
 Develop site SOP for collecting/disposing of non-hazardous SW 
 Maintain an estimate of SW generated daily based on population 
 Coordinate local methods and assistance in disposing of SW  
 Coordinate plans for burn pits with BEE, PH, Safety, FES 
 Locate landfill operations downstream, far from water sources 
 Use liners in landfills to prevent leachate release into groundwater 
 Cover landfill area daily with soil to control insect/rodent infestation  
  Designate space for the PHA and develop a plan to secure the area 
 Separate hazardous solid waste in PHA; do not allow it to be burned 
 Extract items that can be recycled/reused to reduce the waste stream 
 Coordinate with other units for access to, or purchase an incinerator 
 Monitor contracts approved by CCDR’s environmental staff

3.5.1. Burn Pits. During initial stages of contingencies, burn pits are an 
expedient method for thermal destruction of large quantities of SW generated. 
Although DOD policy imposes restrictions on using burn pits to manage SW 
during contingency operations, this may be the only option available initially. 
Because burn pits, even properly segregated may produce fumes that can 
affect the health of personnel, they are a short-term solution for SW disposal 
and must be replaced by more appropriate means of disposal, particularly as 
the site matures and the population increases. The following paragraphs 
describe DOD policy and guidance on use of open-air burn pits, planning, 
construction, and operations.   
3.5.1.1. DOD Burn Pit Policy. DOD guidance indicates burn pits are a short-
term solution to SW disposal where no other alternative is feasible. For the 
longer term, incinerators, engineered landfills, or other accepted solid waste 
management practices should be used for SW disposal.  DODI 4715.19, Use of 
Open-Air Burn Pits in Contingency Operations, was issued to protect 
personnel health and safety to the greatest extent possible when burn pits are 
used. The policy states when used, open-air burn pits shall be operated in a 
manner that prevents or minimizes risks to human health and safety of DOD 
personnel and, where possible, harm to the environment. It requires the 
operational commander to establish a solid waste management plan (SWMP) 
for contingency operations. Use of open-air burn pits shall not be allowed 
unless included in the SWMP. It also establishes policy to prohibit the disposal 
of covered waste in open-air burn pits during contingency operations except 
when the CCDR determines no alternative disposal method is feasible. 
Covered waste includes tires, treated wood, batteries, compressed gas 
cylinders (unless empty with valves removed), fuel containers (unless 
completely evacuated of contents), aerosol cans, polychlorinated biphenyls, 
petroleum, oils, and lubricant products (other than waste fuel for initial 
combustion), asbestos, mercury, and foam tent material. If the CCDR 
determines there is no alternative to burn pits for disposing of covered wastes, 
the determination must be sent to USD(AT&L) within 15 days for 
congressional notification. Justification for continued disposal of covered 
waste must be made every 180 calendar days thereafter.  Justification packages 
shall include a detailed health risk assessment IAW paragraph 6.2 of DODI 
6490.03, Deployment Health. These assessments can take months, and should 
be initiated as soon as possible for burn pits having a probability of operating 
over 180 days to meet the 180-day notification to congressional committees.   
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
48 
 
In no case are munitions or explosives allowed to be disposed of in burn pits 
with any other wastes (see DOD 6055.09-M for guidance on destruction of 
munitions and explosives). Engineers should always consult the Fire 
Department, BEE and PH in determining items that can be burned. 
3.5.1.2. Burn Pit Planning and Construction. Engineers coordinate with 
medical personnel to site burn pits downwind and as far away from living, 
dining, and work areas as operational considerations permit. They are also 
located where burning or presence of garbage will not pose an unsafe 
attraction to birds or other wildlife that may interfere with safe air operations 
and air traffic control. Weather personnel track wind speed and direction to 
help establish typical or prevailing wind data to best orient burn operations to 
keep the path of plumes away from other activities as much as possible. Solid 
waste generation estimates are used to determine the size of burn pits, taking 
into consideration possible future expansion. Aboveground pits may be needed 
in areas with high water tables. Construct several pits to allow one to burn 
while others collect waste. Pits should be far apart to allow equipment to 
maneuver. Optimally, design each pit to hold a week’s estimated waste. High 
density liners can be used to minimize soil contamination. Use earthen berms 
and fencing to restrict access. Designate space adjacent to the burn area to 
establish a PHA for segregating and items not being burned. 
3.5.1.3. Burn Pit Operations. Burn pits are operated in a manner that: (1) is 
safe and secure for operators; (2) minimizes attraction for wildlife and disease 
vectors; (3) prevents or minimizes risks to human health and safety and the 
environment. Personnel should be trained in offloading, segregating, igniting, 
and observing operations from a safe distance. They should have proper PPE 
as determined by the BEE. The best time to operate burn pits is 3 hours after 
sunrise to 3 hours before sunset. Before conducting burns, coordinate with the 
FES, BEE, Safety, and PH. An ash disposal plan should be developed. Ash 
samples are taken and characterized as either hazardous or non-hazardous. If 
ash is determined to be hazardous, inspect the waste stream to identify and 
remove the source of hazardous ash. Store hazardous ash securely near the 
burn pit until HW disposal methods are established. Non-hazardous ash can be 
disposed of in a landfill. A system should be established (by the BEE) to 
monitor for high pollution emissions (reference DODI 6055.05, Occupational 
and Environmental Health [OEH], and DODI 6490.03). Sources of high levels 
of pollutants are identified and quickly resolved. Pits are inspected often for 
compliance with CCDR and DOD guidance. If burn pit operations are 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
49 
 
contracted, engineers should work with contracting officials to ensure 
performance work statements reflect the most current DOD and theater 
guidance, particularly any restrictions. 
3.5.2. Thermal Destruction. During contingency operations, disposal 
methods should transition to thermal destruction as the site matures and 
population increases. When acquiring incinerators, make sure they are 
certified where manufactured. Also ensure they are operated according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Work with medical and weather personnel to site 
incinerators as far as possible from populated areas in a manner where 
prevailing winds take smoke away from these areas. Emissions should be 
routinely monitored by BEE personnel for high levels of pollutants and causes 
identified and quickly resolved. Do not burn materials that give off hazardous 
pollutants such as POL products, rubber, tar paper, asphalt, shingles, tires, 
treated wood, batteries of any type, aerosol cans, compressed gas cylinders, 
plastic, paint, paint thinner and strippers, pesticides, pesticide containers, 
asbestos, appliances and electrical equipment, and electrical wires. These 
should be recycled or disposed of as hazardous waste. Also, do not place 
ammunition or explosives in incinerators. Thermal destruction equipment 
should be used only for their intended purpose (e.g., HW, SW, RMW). 
3.5.3. Landfill Operations. Landfill operations attract large birds and flocking 
birds that are hazardous to aircraft operations. If possible, landfills should be 
sited at least 10,000 feet (approximately 2 miles) from active aircraft ramps, 
taxiways, and runways where fixed-wing and variable geometry wing jet 
aircraft operate. This may not always be practicable when deployed in support 
of contingency operations in foreign countries. The working face of the 
landfill should be kept as small as possible. Use protective measures to prevent 
landfill leachate from contaminating local soil and ground water resources. 
Solid wastes should be compacted and covered daily with a minimum of six 
inches of soil to discourage bird activity. Units should deploy with lethal bird 
control and dispersal equipment along with trained personnel. Pyrotechnics are 
very effective and highly recommended for bird dispersal. The use of shotguns 
for lethal control may be necessary to reinforce dispersal techniques. If it is 
impracticable to site a landfill outside of the criterion, dispersal and lethal 
control activities must be coordinated with air traffic control to avoid 
dispersing birds into the path of arriving and/or departing aircraft. Before 
employing lethal controls, ensure birds targeted for depredation are not 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
50 
 
protected by local laws or international treaties. For details on landfills, see 
AFPAM 10-219, Volume 1.  
3.6. Hazardous Material. Upon arrival at the deployed location, those units 
with HM may need to use whatever space is available to properly store highly 
volatile items, poisons, and corrosives. Supplies may also be very limited, and 
those supplies that are available may not be the items specified by different 
manufacturers for handling certain types of HM. Resourcefulness and 
creativity are essential traits for properly “making things happen” during initial 
stages of contingencies. Engineers may establish an HMSA to centrally 
manage all HM on site.  
3.6.1. Siting. During initial beddown, site the HMSA in an industrial area 
large enough to meet anticipated needs, but not near base perimeters or other 
areas where they create force protection problems by becoming potential 
targets for enemy forces. Work with the Safety, BEE and weather personnel to 
ensure the HMSA is sited downwind and downgradient, and a considerable 
distance away from living and work areas.  Also, make sure the area is not 
near a water source and the surface is level. The site should be near service 
roads for access by vehicles and potential contractors. Do not site HM storage 
in areas prone to flooding (Figure 3.2.), particularly if equipment and supplies 
needed to construct overhead cover and ensure secondary containment are not 
yet available. Use all available data including topography, geology, weather 
data, aerial photography and geospatial information in siting HM storage.  
Figure 3.2. Flooded Storage Area. 
 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
51 
 
3.6.2. Construction. Employ whatever techniques and materials are available 
to prevent pollution and properly manage HM storage. Excess tent parts can be 
used for expedient storage, and expired fuel bags and sandbags can be used 
temporarily as liners for containment. Wooden pallets can be used for flooring 
and scrap wood, and camouflage netting can be used to build cover for storage 
areas. Ensure the storage area has proper ventilation and enough space to 
segregate incompatible materials (reactives, ignitables, corrosives, oxidizers, 
and toxics) to prevent fire or explosions. Also provide some type of 
emergency eyewash and shower. Construct berms around HMSA storage areas 
to contain leaks, and fencing to prevent unauthorized access to the area. As 
soon as possible, the area should be upgraded to include concrete flooring that 
can serve as secondary containment. Although not generally applicable to 
contingency operations, UFC 4-442-01N, Design: Covered Storage, can 
provide planners with basic requirements for constructing covered storage 
facilities for HM, considering resources available and operational constraints. 
The UFC can be downloaded from the Whole Building Design Guide 
(WBDG) website. 
3.6.3. Procedures.  The Environmental Officer, in conjunction with the FES, 
BEE, Safety, and PH should develop a site-specific environmental SOP which 
includes HM management and spill prevention/response. The SOP should 
address how the site will manage, issue, and track HM. AFI 32-7086, 
paragraph 2.6 should be used as a reference in developing this SOP. However, 
keep in mind environmental guidance in applicable international agreements 
or the relevant OPLAN/OPORD (CCDR’s guidance) takes precedent over 
guidance provided in Service instructions and other policy.  Everyone 
involved with managing HM must be trained and equipped with proper 
protective equipment, and know what to do in the event of a spill, fire, or 
explosion. They should ensure materials are properly containerized, labeled, 
segregated, and stored, and MSDSs are available for each HM stored. 
Procedures are established to conduct periodic inventories to maintain 
accountability. Personnel should avoid stockpiling HM, and reduce the HM 
stored and HW generated through reuse, recycling, or product substitution. 
The Environmental Officer, FES, Safety, and BEE should conduct periodic 
inspections of HMSA to detect and correct any existing or potential hazards. If 
HMAPs will be set up, establish procedures to periodically inspect these areas 
as well.

3.7. Hazardous Waste. The primary means of disposing of HW during 
contingencies is through DLA Disposition Services in country (if the proper 
disposal facilities and capabilities exist) or retrograding it back to the U.S. for 
disposal. Another option could be transit agreements and arrangements to 
transport HW to nearby countries with acceptable disposal facilities. However, 
these options may not be immediately available. Until that time, HW must be 
properly managed. Initially, commanders appoint trained personnel to manage 
HW during contingencies. These individuals can establish a centralized 
HWSA to consolidate all wastes until proper turn-in procedures can be 
established locally or through DLA Disposition Services 
3.7.1. Siting. Engineers work closely with medical, safety, and weather 
personnel to locate the HWSA far from and downwind of living areas, work 
areas, or other highly populated areas to minimize the risk and impact of 
accidental spills or releases of vapors. The storage area should be large enough 
to meet anticipated needs, and be near a road that is accessible by material 
handling equipment (Figure 3.3.). Keep in mind there also needs to be enough 
space available to segregate ignitables, reactives, flammables, and corrosives 
(See Attachment 6). Since the HWSA could become a target for intentional 
sabotage, it should be far enough inside the camp boundary so that it is not 
easily accessible by the local population. Also, make sure it is downwind and 
downgradient of water sources and in an area not prone to frequent flooding. 
Prevailing wind data should also be used in siting to minimize the impact of 
accidental releases of toxic fumes on populated areas or the mission. 
Figure 3.3. Hazardous Waste Storage Area. 
 
 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
53 
 
3.7.2. Construction. The HWSA must have enough space to segregate 
incompatible wastes, allow for unobstructed movement, store spill response 
and decontamination equipment, and provide secondary containment. The area 
should be graded to provide a level surface, and under cover to minimize the 
impact of runoff from flooding. Equip the HWSA with fire extinguishers, first 
aid kits, emergency eyewash, and a shower in case of accidents, spills or other 
emergencies. A berm or fence should surround the area to control entry. Post 
warning signs (i.e., “Danger, Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out,” “No 
Smoking,” etc.) in both English and the language predominant for the area. 
Although not generally applicable to contingency operations, UFC 4-451-10N, 
Design: Hazardous Waste Storage, can provide planners with basic 
requirements for constructing a HWSA, considering resources available and 
other operational constraints. It can be downloaded from the WBDG website. 
3.7.3. Procedures. Key aspects of HW management include collection, 
storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal. The Environmental Officer, in 
conjunction with the FES, BEE, Safety, and PH should develop a site-specific 
environmental 
SOP 
covering 
all 
these 
areas 
including 
spill 
prevention/response. A HWSA staff should be appointed, trained, and 
equipped with proper PPE. These individuals must know what to do in the 
event of a spill, fire, or explosion. They ensure materials are properly 
containerized, labeled, segregated, and stored. They ensure HW turned in is 
accompanied by a HW profile sheet (DRMS Form 1930) and DD 1348-1A 
(Issue Release/Issue Receipt Document). The HWSA staff also assists HW 
generators in setting up Hazardous Waste Accumulation Points (HWAPs) at or 
near the point of generation and under the control of the HW generator (keep 
in mind HWAPs cannot store more than 55 gallons of HW or 1 quart of acute 
HW per waste stream before it must be transferred to the HWSA). Periodic 
inspections of the HWSA and HWAPs are conducted to ensure accountability 
is being maintained and to detect and correct any existing or potential hazards 
(see Attachment 4). Refer to TG 217, Hazardous Material/Hazardous Waste 
Management Guide for Maneuver Units During Field and Deployment 
Operations, and additional guidance on HW management located on the 
DENIX website.

3.8. Identification and Storage of Unknowns. During contingency 
operations, unknown chemicals and other substances may be discovered that 
are not labeled or otherwise properly identified. These items are usually 
quarantined and BEE and/or Emergency Management personnel are 
immediately notified. Such unknown items should always be handled as 
potentially dangerous. If tests can identify these chemicals or other substances, 
they should be sealed for proper storage. 
3.8.1. Consider establishing a separate facility for unknown chemicals or 
substances. Locate the facility away from all others, downwind of the camp, 
and preferably in a bunker-type location. Ideally, this facility should be 
capable of being secured to prevent items from being dropped off without 
coordination. All unknown chemicals can then be taken to this location for 
testing. While exercising extreme caution, tests can be taken to attempt to 
identify the chemical or substance (Figure 3.4.).  If a proper identification is 
not possible, the item should remain in storage. 
3.8.2. Unknown chemicals or substances not generated by U.S. personnel 
cannot be disposed of through normal U.S. channels. For this reason, it is 
important to keep these items separate. Keep in mind it is possible to have 
some U.S.-generated unknown chemicals or substances. If these can be 
identified by any means of investigation, the waste must be disposed of 
through normal U.S. channels.

3.9. Spill Prevention and Response. Although U.S. forces should focus on 
P2, during fast-paced, large-scale military operations involving a vast array of 
vehicles and equipment, spills are likely. In preparation, the spill prevention 
and response plan developed prior to deploying should be tailored for the site 
and maintained anywhere spills might likely occur, particularly the HMSA, 
HWSA, HWAPs, and refueling points (Figure 3.5.). The plan should include 
emergency contact information, notification and evacuation procedures, and 
local methods and procedures for preventing and responding to spills, fire, and 
explosions.  
3.9.1. Prevention. Spill prevention involves strict adherence to guidance, 
proper use of supplies and equipment, and frequent inspections. Some actions 
that can be taken to prevent or contain spills include: 
 Secondary containment at HMSA/HWSA, HWAPs, refuel points 
 Locate HM/HW storage areas on existing paved surfaces 
 Provide overhead cover for HM/HW storage to prevent runoff  
 Empty any water accumulated in secondary containment; test and 
dispose of as HW if necessary 
 Use proper containers/lids, ensure containers are in good condition 
 Conduct  frequent inspections of containers; checks for leaks 
 Turn in full containers as soon as possible for proper disposal 
 Use spill containment liners for parked vehicles and equipment  
 Ensure use of liners and secondary containment at refueling points 
 Devise methods to prevent spills from overflowing secondary 
containment and reaching soil, drains, ditches, etc. 
 Ensure all HM/HW transported on vehicles comply with combatant 
command guidance and spill kits are readily available

AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
56 
 
3.9.2. Response. The spill response team (Figure 3.6.) is appointed and 
trained prior to deploying to ensure they are immediately prepared to safely 
stop or contain spills and execute cleanup actions. To remain proficient, the 
team frequently practices procedures outlined in the SOP to detect and correct 
deficiencies. Team members must be trained on the dangers of HM/HW they 
may be exposed to, safety precautions, use of emergency apparatus such as 
alarms, fire extinguishers and emergency eyewash, first aid procedures, use of 
MSDSs and PPE, and be adequately equipped with supplies and equipment 
needed for spill response (see Attachment 5). Following are some actions that 
should be taken in response to spills:  
 Responders should approach spills from the upwind direction  
 Evacuate area if necessary based on amount/type of material spilled 
 If spill poses danger to the site, notify/warn all personnel   
 Identify spill material and follow MSDS guidance 
 If material is flammable, shutdown electrical and notify FES 
 Ensure proper PPE is being worn and used based on MSDS 
 Ventilate the area to allow any toxic fumes to escape 
 Use spill kit to safely stop or contain the spill IAW SOP 
 Contact key personnel outlined in SOP to report the spill 
 Qualified personnel clean up spill and properly dispose of wastes 
 Replace equipment and supplies used to clean up the spill 
 Ensure proper vehicular transport of HM/HW and availability of spill 
response kits/supplies to quickly clean up any spills

3.10. Landfarming. Spills are likely to occur in the contingency environment 
due to the rapid pace of beddown and mission priorities. When they do occur, 
contaminated soil must be removed to protect human health. Most spills tend 
to be POL-related; accidents usually occur during fueling, de-fueling, 
transport, transfer and maintenance activities. Contaminated soil should be 
removed and placed in a designated area for aeration and/or microbe treatment 
(Figure 3.7.). This is referred to as landfarming, a bioremediation treatment 
process. The contaminated soil is mixed with healthy soil containing 
microorganisms that will metabolize the waste contents of the contaminated 
soil. Once the site is designated, construct a bermed area and install liners to 
contain the contaminant. This is where the contaminated soil will be mixed 
with healthy soil. Have a plan to turn the soil (aeration) and keep it moist 
(spraying or other means) to enhance biodegradation. The soil may have to be 
covered to keep it moist. There is no set timeframe for this process. Once 
landfarming has begun, the soil will have to be tested periodically to determine 
the remaining level of contamination. Detailed information on landfarming is 
outlined in Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS) 02 54 20, 
Bioremediation of Soils Using Landfarming Systems. It can be downloaded 
from the WBDG website.

3.11. Regulated Medical Waste. As stated earlier, RMW includes those 
wastes with the potential for causing infection and for which special 
precautions are prudent. The medical unit generating RMW is responsible for 
proper storage, handling and disposal; however, engineer assistance is usually 
required. During initial beddown, expedient methods may need to be 
employed to construct a storage area for managing RMW until medical waste 
incinerators or local support can be obtained. Storage areas should be marked 
with the universal biohazard symbol and the word “BIOHAZARD” in both 
English and the local language. Expedient disposal methods can include open-
burning and burying (as a last resort, after treatment). Medical personnel are 
familiar with specific procedures, unique equipment and supplies, and HN 
laws governing RMW disposal. To ensure proper disposal, RMW is separated 
from other wastes at the point of origin. Personnel involved must wear 
appropriate PPE (skin, eye, and respiratory protection). If SW is mixed with 
RMW, it is handled and disposed of as RMW. Following are some 
considerations for managing RMW during contingencies: 
 Become familiar with site-specific RMW disposal SOP 
 Ensure all personnel involved in handling RMW are trained 
 Wear proper PPE for handling, transporting, disposing of RMW 
 Use “red bags” or any uniquely identified or marked bags for RMW 
 Use sharps containers/closed metal pails for syringes, needles, etc. 
 Do not snip or cut needles; discard items intact into containers 
 If 55-gallon drums are used for storage, do not add fuel to the drums 
 Research option of having RMW picked up/disposed of via contract 
 If contracted, state specific requirements for proper disposal 
 If possible, dispose of RMW via incineration (preferred method) 
 Consider retrograding sharps to a location with a waste incinerator 
 Consider constructing inclined-plane incinerator (ref: FM 21-10-1) 
 Obtain approval to use inclined-plane incinerator to burn wastes 
 Ensure any burning takes place downwind of work and living areas 
 Store medical waste ash in a drum to be retrograded back to the U.S. 
 Consider steam sterilization to treat sharps (use autoclave bags) 
 Bury sharps when no other method medical waste disposal available 
 Sterilize sharps and other RMW to remove pathogens before burying 
 If sharps must be buried, bury below scavenger depth (approx 8 ft)

3.12. Pest Management. In the field, pest management personnel have dual 
responsibilities: vector/pest control and proper HM/HW storage (see TG 24). 
During contingencies, pest management activities are focused on removing 
disease vectors and medical pests from the site and, later on, surveillance to 
evaluate the problem species and disease threat. Controlling wild animals, 
insects, rodents, and heavy bird populations that threaten personnel health and 
aircraft operations is the main focus during initial beddown. Bird/Wildlife Air 
Strike Hazard (BASH) mitigation measures must be coordinated with flight 
safety and airfield operations. Disease vectors (some species of mosquitoes, 
ticks, sand flies, etc.) can transmit causative agents responsible for rabies, 
malaria, leishmaniasis, dengue, etc. Although conventional integrated pest 
management (IPM) techniques that include pesticides still apply during 
contingencies, implementation is complicated by limited control and 
equipment, inadequate supplies, construction and manpower priorities, pest 
problems not previously encountered, and a public health infrastructure that 
may not yet be fully established. Pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, 
rodenticides) and repellents can affect personnel through direct contact, water, 
air, and food. Additionally, many insecticides are cholinesterase inhibitors, 
which may predispose personnel to chemical warfare agents, set off chemical 
alarms or adversely affect personnel with chemical sensitivity. Pesticides must 
be applied by certified applicators wearing proper PPE and in accordance with 
label instructions (Figure 3.8.).

3.13. Storm Water. Storm water, while often seasonal, poses a serious hazard 
to contingency operations and the environment. Sites constructed on land that 
is relatively dry most of the year may be under water in a short period of time 
during the rainy season if soils become impervious and do not allow for quick 
drainage. This could affect terrain, vehicle movement, initial beddown options, 
mission generation, and efforts to bring the site to full operational capability. 
This is why it is important to have plans in place to minimize the impact of 
storm water prior to deploying. Following are some recommendations for 
consideration in managing storm water during initial beddown.  Additional 
information on managing storm water can be found in UFC 3-210-10, Low 
Impact Development. 
 Avoid destroying vegetation to minimize storm water runoff 
 Grade/slope site in a manner to prevent flooding /standing water 
 Minimize the amount of impervious surfaces to be constructed  
 Construct trenches/retention ponds capable of diverting storm water 
 Construct drainage/storm water collection areas to control runoff 
 Use natural low-lying areas for retention ponds/collect storm water 
 Ensure watershed protection is considered in construction activities 
 Prohibit constructing paved surfaces near groundwater sources 
 Avoid construction activities that contribute to storm water runoff 
 Clear construction sites daily of trash, material scraps, debris, etc.  
 Designate vehicle/equipment fueling area away from const area   
 Store HM/HW on level surfaces, downgradient of all water sources 
 Const berms around HM/HW storage to limit runoff contamination 
 Ensure HM/HW storage/maintenance areas under protective cover 
 Test storm water for POL contamination; locate/neutralize source 
 Collect, treat, use storm water for fire fighting, vegetation, dust  
 Collect, treat storm water contaminated from construction activities 
 Upkeep vehicles/equipment to prevent leaks on impervious surfaces 
 Install oil/water separators in maintenance areas; inspect regularly 
 Regularly inspect septic systems; immediately make needed repairs

3.14. Air Pollution. Air pollution poses a serious threat to the health of 
deployed personnel. Although we cannot control natural occurrences such as 
the fierce sandstorms experienced in Southwest Asia exposing personnel to 
particulate matter, attempt to minimize sources of pollution over which we do 
have some degree of control. Many opportunities exist to limit sources of air 
pollution resulting from military operations. Much of the equipment and 
supplies used during military operations emit various concentrations of 
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and can possibly be substituted. 
Minimizing air pollution at the height of contingency operations can be 
challenging. However, it is important to focus on limiting exposure to 
unnecessary hazards. Civil engineers should always consult with medical and 
weather personnel when making determinations on siting industrial, storage, 
and waste management activities considered sources of air pollution. Ensure 
stationary sources of pollution are sited a substantial distance downwind to 
ensure changes in wind direction will not result in an inadvertent exposure to 
personnel. Where practicable, air dispersion modeling can be used to estimate 
concentration of pollutants and determine stack heights and safe distances for 
pollution sources such as incinerators. Modeling can also be used to identify 
cost-effective pollution control equipment. Contact the combatant command 
environmental staff or AFCEE for information on air dispersal modeling. 
Following are recommendations to reduce air pollution during contingencies:  
  
 Develop site-specific SOP to minimize sources of air pollution 
 Investigate any off-site sources of TIC in the near vicinity   
 Establish local contracts to remove/dispose of SW if possible 
 Locate burn activities downwind/far away from living/work areas 
 Locate HMSA/HWSA downwind/far away from living/work areas 
 Segregate SW materials; remove all hazardous SW before burning 
 Reduce SW generation; recycle/reuse to maximum extent possible 
 Minimize fuel jettisons during flying ops; reduce vapors if possible 
 Acquire power generation equipment with newer filtration systems 
 Acquire larger power units; cover more area/reduce emissions 
 Locate older equipment where emission hazards are minimized 
 Extend smoke stacks on older heating units above breathing zones 
 Acquire modern heating units equipped with filtration systems  
 Use treated gray water or soil solidification products to reduce dust 
 Keep vehicles/fueling equipment well maintained and inspect often 
 Replace equipment/substitute products for those emitting less VOCs

3.15. Historical and Cultural Resources. During initial beddown, civil 
engineers work closely with senior leadership in developing and issuing local 
guidance to ensure all personnel understand the importance of historical and 
cultural resources and their responsibilities to protect these assets to the 
greatest extent while focusing on the mission. Engineers thoroughly review all 
of the research information gathered during planning to ensure accuracy and 
make adjustments to plans as necessary. Make contact with key environmental 
personnel in the AOR and local officials to gather any additional information 
on historical and cultural resources that might impact the course of operations. 
Considering the operational environment, also look for opportunities to query 
the local population. If necessary, update maps developed during planning. All 
of this information provides commanders situational awareness with respect to 
historical and cultural resources that can be useful during decisionmaking. If 
adjustments must be made, ensure these assets are considered prior to starting 
construction, and military activities and maneuvers are able to remain at least 
50 meters (165 feet) from these areas. As operations continue, keep 
commanders informed of on-going activities that may result in damage or 
destruction to these assets and propose alternatives that could minimize adverse 
effects without degrading operational capability. Following are some 
considerations for historical and cultural resources during initial beddown:   
 Integrate CCDR’s historical/cultural resource policy into site SOPs 
 Maintain maps identifying environmentally sensitive areas in region 
 Consider declaring environmentally sensitive areas off limits 
 Query local population on locations of historical/cultural resources 
 Seek to avoid areas of significant historical importance 
 Seek to avoid areas of significant spiritual importance 
 Seek to avoid archeological sites that may contain historical artifacts 
 Construct temporary barriers to prevent entry into sensitive areas 
 Post warning signs at entrances to environmentally sensitive areas 
 Assess impact of required excavation on historical/cultural resources 
 Avoid sensitive areas in plans for expansion or during construction 
 Prohibit removal of historically or culturally significant artifacts

3.16. Natural Resources. During initial beddown, care must be taken to 
conserve and preserve natural resources. If not accomplished during planning, 
efforts should be made upon arrival to map sensitive areas and gain as much 
information as possible to assist commanders in decisionmaking. As an 
example, siting military operations in strategic locations may require clearing 
forests and vegetation. In this situation, the CCDR would determine if military 
necessity outweighs the environmental impact of this action, keeping in mind 
the impact on the local population and sensitivities of the country. Efforts 
should be made to site activities such as HM/HW storage and refueling points 
far from natural resources such as surface waters and wetlands. Personnel 
should also be educated on their responsibilities to protect and preserve natural 
resources while maintaining operational capabilities. The swift pace of 
operations during initial beddown will make it difficult to be proactive in 
protecting natural resources. However, if the environmental staff is keeping 
senior leaders informed on the potential impact of military operations and other 
activities on natural resources, the chances of causing significant damage to 
these resources should be minimized. Following are some considerations for 
natural resources during initial beddown:    
 Develop SOP with goals for conserving/preserving natural resources 
 Maintain maps/records on location/condition of natural resources 
 Consider placing wetlands off-limits to preserve biodiversity  
 Avoid activities that unnecessarily contribute to deforestation 
 Develop plans to mitigate damage to natural resources from fires   
 Develop plans to minimize damage to farming/agricultural resources 
 Avoid excavating in areas known to contain valuable raw materials 
 Prohibit open-dumping/burning near wetlands, lakes, rivers, streams 
 Apply pesticides in manner to minimize impact on natural resources 
 Manage HM/HW in manner to minimize impact on natural resources 
 Determine existence of threatened or endangered species in area; 
develop plans to prevent destruction or minimize damage to habitats 
 Determine existence of threatened or endangered flora in area; 
develop plans to prevent destruction or minimize damage to habitats

3.17. Flora and Fauna.  Flora and fauna are environmentally sensitive issues 
that must be taken into consideration before initiating military operations and 
throughout the length of the deployment. Since flora and fauna are often 
sources of pride for different countries, damage or destruction of these assets 
could adversely affect U.S. long-term relationships with other countries. 
During initial beddown, plans designed to minimize impact to these assets may 
need to be adjusted to accommodate on-going operations (i.e., expanded camp 
area, adjusted site layout, excavation required, etc.). Plans should consider 
potential changes and different courses of action to accommodate any changes. 
Upon arrival, areas of significant importance to the different species’ survival 
should be identified/marked and avoided if possible. Personnel should also be 
educated on prohibited actions such as wildlife trade and their responsibilities 
to protect and preserve flora and fauna and while maintaining operational 
capabilities. If adjustments must be made to initial plans, ensure environmental 
effects on flora and fauna is continually assessed and addressed in beddown 
and operational decisions. The combatant command environmental staff is also 
a source of information concerning flora and fauna for the particular region. 
Following are some elements to be considered to minimize damage to flora 
and fauna during initial beddown: 
 Integrate JFC’s policy on flora and fauna into site-specific SOPs 
 Maintain maps identifying all environmentally sensitive areas 
 Avoid constructing landfills or storing HM/HW near these areas 
 Avoid expanding into areas inhabited by sensitive flora/fauna 
 Avoid planning military maneuvers that may damage flora/fauna 
 Officially declare all environmentally sensitive areas off limits 
 Construct fencing or berms to prevent entry into sensitive areas 
 Post warning signs to inform personnel entering sensitive areas 
 Prohibit construction activities in these areas if at all possible 
 Require permits prior to allowing any excavation on/near the site 
 Assess the impact of all required excavation on flora and fauna 
 Be aware of the seasonal behaviors of all wildlife in the region

Chapter 4 
SUSTAINMENT 
 
4.1. Overview. Once operations begin to stabilize, increased focus should be 
placed on environmental concerns. At this stage, environmental activities 
should be focused on supporting ACS efforts to sustain the force. Austere 
facilities, utility systems, and disposal methods can be upgraded and 
augmented with contract support. These efforts will increase the level of 
protection for human health and further limit losses as a result of DNBI. 
Significant gains can be made in waste minimization. The model shown in 
Figure 4.1. depicts, from top to bottom, the most desirable to least desirable 
options of dealing with wastes. Prevention and source reduction are given the 
highest preference since these options can eliminate the need to handle it in the 
first place. Reuse and recycling helps to preserve raw materials, which reduces 
the amount of wastes requiring disposal. Energy recovery is an option that is 
increasingly being considered for the contingency environment. Treatment 
makes the waste less hazardous (and possibly reusable). Disposal is the least 
preferred option, which usually involves returning wastes to the land, air, or 
water (following treatment). This model can be applied to environmental 
processes in an effort to minimize environmental impacts. Additional 
information sustaining environmental resources can be located on AFCEE’s 
Accessible kNowledge for Sustainable Resources (ANSR) website at:  
https://cs.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/eDASH/default.aspx.

66 
 
4.2. Pollution Prevention. Once initial beddown is complete and military 
operations become more stabilized, sustaining P2 efforts will require diligence 
and commitment. P2 should be continually promoted as the primary means of 
achieving environmental standards. The frequency and amount of education 
and training should be increased, particularly in areas experiencing high 
turnover. Adequate supplies should be available, and facility and utility 
infrastructure upgrades may be completed at this point. The Environmental 
Officer should be preparing regular ECRs to document the site’s condition. 
This is particularly important after any known imminent and substantial 
endangerment has been identified or eliminated, or following a significant 
environmental event such as a spill. Following are some key elements for 
consideration to enhance and sustain P2 efforts once contingency operations 
shift towards sustainment: 
 Revise SOP to reflect additional P2 and pollution reduction goals 
 Focus on source reduction, reuse, recycling to support P2 efforts 
 Focus on waste minimization; reduce SW going in to landfills 
 Reduce the HM inventory through conservation and reuse initiatives 
 Reduce amount of HW generated by reducing dependency on HM 
 Substitute HM for those less hazardous to personnel & environment 
 Require HM/HW procurement/disposal requests be documented 
 Upgrade HWSA (UFC 4-451-10N can serve as a good reference)    
 Establish procedures for contract disposal of HW through DLA 
 Establish local contract for SW, RMW, and wastewater disposal 
 Request AFCAP support to manage/handle various functions/tasks 
 Transition any open-pit burning to SW incineration and/or landfills    
 Construct semi-permanent facilities/systems to control pollution 
 Implement energy conservation plans; identify targets of opportunity 
 Consider purchasing and installing more energy-efficient equipment 
 Consider purchasing, installing equipment with emission controls 
 Prohibit vehicle operations in certain areas to reduce exhaust fumes 
 Consider use of renewable energy in those areas where it is practical 
 Compost SW to reduce waste stream; use for vegetative needs 
 Reduce fuel expulsions during flight activities as much as possible 
 Use gray water for construction activities, dust control, composting 
 Acquire and install packaged wastewater treatment plant on site 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
67 
 
4.3. Water Sources. An adequate supply of safe, potable water is critical to 
sustaining contingency operations. Once initial water supplies are established, 
planners need to investigate factors that could affect water production and 
storage. Key factors include the anticipated duration of the operation, potential 
changes in mission, anticipated population (including surges), and transient 
support the site may need to provide, and any additional water sources 
available. All of these factors can affect water production operations. From 
initial beddown to sustainment, estimates of water requirements must be 
reevaluated and production and storage requirements adjusted as needed. 
Additional resources, such as RED HORSE or AFCAP, may need to be 
considered if well-drilling or other requirements exceed on-hand capabilities. 
The site layout should be reexamined (from a perspective of sustainment 
rather than expediency) and decisions made on whether to relocate HW 
storage, SW disposal, or refueling activities to prevent water sources 
contamination. Following are some recommendations for managing water 
resources once military operations shift more towards sustainment:         
 Consider adopting water quality standards and procedures in 
OEBGD, country-specific FGS (if available), etc. 
 Update SOP; add new requirements, methods, procedures, etc. 
 Investigate use of local municipal water system as a source 
 Establish local contracts to provide purified water if approved  
 If bottled water remains a source, consider contract bottling plant 
 Ensure aggressive oversight of any contracted water activities 
 Ensure AFMAN 48-138 guidance on field water supply is followed 
 Continually inspect/safeguard water purification equipment 
 Continually inspect, disinfect water storage/distribution equipment 
 Develop schedule to test water points (tanks, trailers, bladders, etc.) 
 Maintain adequate inventory of water purification chemicals/test kits 
 Replace water storage bladders with fiberglass water tanks 
 Replace distribution system with buried distribution lines 
 Acquire chilled water trailers and install chilled water fountains  
 Refine plans to control contamination via soil erosion/storm water 
 Refine plans to secure water sources and protect from sabotage 
 Refine emergency plans; include additional water points/locations 
 Minimize or prohibit aircraft refueling over raw water sources

4.4. Wastewater. Once in the sustainment phase, begin to explore and take 
advantage of opportunities to improve how wastewater is managed. Some 
slight risks may have been taken during the initial beddown due to the urgency 
of the mission, operational tempo, limited personnel, resources, and equipment 
that need not be taken at this point. Means of adequate and safe disposal of 
wastewater must be achieved to sustain a military force after initial beddown 
has occurred. Access to an on-site or municipal wastewater treatment plant 
(WWTP) is preferable. Other options such as use of a local treatment system 
or contracting for wastewater removal usually require approval by the EEA. If 
the contracting option is used, the contract should specify the method of 
disposal to ensure wastewater removed from the site is being disposed of 
properly. Following are some items for consideration in managing wastewater 
after initial beddown has occurred: 
 Consider adopting wastewater standards/procedures in OEBGD, 
country-specific FGS (if available), etc. 
 Contract for provision/servicing of chemical latrines  
 Lease sewer trucks to collect/transport waste to municipal WWTP 
 Construct semi-permanent latrines with locally procured septic tanks 
 Negotiate use of local facilities wastewater collect/treatment system 
 Tie field expeditionary waste collection system to municipal WWTP 
 Tie expedient wastewater treatment system to local sewer system 
 Purchase and install package wastewater treatment plant on site 
 Purchase materials locally; construct semi-permanent WWTP on site 
 Install sewer lines and lift stations to convey wastewater to lagoons 
 Consider designating area for composting sewage sludge if practical 
 Contract to haul gray water to approved off-site treatment plant 
 Use government vehicles/equip to haul gray water to off-site facility 
 Consider RED HORSE to construct wastewater treatment system 
 Consider AFCAP for operating and maintaining wastewater system 
 Replace expedient grease traps with commercial grease traps 
 Reuse gray water for dust control, firefighting, composting, etc. 
 Inspect/treat gray water; sewage collect/treatment areas frequently

4.5. Solid Waste. Once initial beddown has occurred and operations stabilize, 
look for opportunities to more effectively manage SW, especially if the site 
population begins to increase. The Environmental Officer must always be 
thinking ahead and planning for different possible scenarios. Ways for 
reducing the amount and volume of SW in landfills include conservation, 
recycling, reuse, composting, and incineration (Figure 4.2.). Following are 
some elements to consider for improving SW disposal during sustainment: 
 Consider adopting solid waste standards/procedures in OEBGD, 
country-specific FGS (if available), etc. 
 Update SOP; include updated guidance/procedures for SW disposal 
 Establish waste reduction goals via recycling, reuse, conservation 
 Purchase/lease incinerators meeting CCDR standards for SW disposal 
 Procure equipment to shred water bottles; reduce the volume of SW 
 Transfer PHA ops to DLA for recycling, resale, redistribution 
 Designate area for composting, identify types of wastes to compost 
 Provide designated containers for recyclable and compost materials 
 Contract for SW disposal (see sample PWS in Attachment 8) 
 Designate SW collection/pickup points; inspect areas frequently 
 Ensure containers/dumpsters are clean; have secondary containment  
 Consider AFCAP support for SW collection/disposal activities

70 
 
4.6. Hazardous Material. During sustainment, focus on upgrading facilities 
standards (Figure 4.3.) and equipment, and improving processes for HM 
management. Several sources can be helpful in this effort. Although AFI 32-
7086 is primarily applicable to permanent bases located in the U.S. or U.S. 
territories, paragraph 2.6 contains tailored guidance for deployments and 
contingency operations outside the U.S. The Hazardous Materials Information 
Resource System (HMIRS) located at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/hmirs/ is a 
central repository for MSDSs developed and maintained by the DLA. Another 
valuable reference is the Military Items Disposal Instructions (MIDI) database 
located on the USAPHC website. This database provides guidance for 
disposal of military items. Following are some elements to be considered in 
managing HM during sustainment: 
 Consider adopting HM management standards and procedures in 
OEBGD, country-specific FGS (if available), etc. 
 Consider relocating HM/HW storage areas for additional security 
 Properly containerize, label and segregate HM; obtain all MSDSs  
 Install fire alarm and intercom sys; upgrade safety equip, spill kits 
 Implement standard training program and begin refresher training 
 Implement automated tracking system HM received, issued, stored  
 Conduct weekly inspections of storage areas with FES and Safety  
 Reduce HM dependency via substitution, conservation, and reuse 
 Replace fuel bladders with steel tanks and upgrade distribution lines 
 Consider contracting options available for HM management 
 Requisition supplies/equipment to address areas of noncompliance 
 Consider procedures for checking AF Form 3952 authorizations 
For units requesting HM, particularly at well established locations

71 
 
4.7. Hazardous Waste. Once contingency operations stabilize, DLA 
Disposition Services will most likely be the disposal agent for HW. 
Nevertheless, the focus should be on improving overall HW management and 
bringing site activities more in line with environmental compliance if more 
stringent standards are adopted or applied to the operation. At this point it will 
probably be useful to consult the CCDR’s environmental staff on developing a 
HW management plan (HWMP). Following are some considerations for 
managing HW during sustainment: 
 Consider adopting HW management standards and procedures in 
OEBGD, country-specific FGS (if available), etc. 
 Apply Waste Management Hierarchy of Preference model  
 Revise HW SOP to reflect updated procedures for managing HW  
 Ensure full-time, dedicated, trained environmental staff is in place  
 Consider relocating HWSA if needed to expand the access perimeter  
 Requisition supplies/equipment needed to address noncompliance  
 Construct semi-permanent facilities with segregated storage areas 
 Consider upgrading HWSA to UFC 4-451-10N standards  
 Request FES make recommendations on smoke/fire alarm systems  
 Construct access roads to facilitate HW transport to collection areas  
 Focus on projects needed to secure area (i.e., fencing, alarms, etc.)  
 Ensure HW warning signs are posting on the facility and fencing  
 Ensure appropriate containers, labels, testing equipment are on hand  
 Acquire additional safety equipment, PPE, first aid kits for HWAPs  
 Develop guidance; conduct frequent inspections of HWSA/HWAPs 
 Require periodic reports from HWAPs; conduct frequent inspections  
 Install automated inventory/tracking system for accurate accounting  
 Increase contact with other units in to expand reuse/recycle efforts  
 Establish contract to dispose of HW off-installation  
 Turn over HWSA management to DLA; update site-specific SOPs

4.8. Regulated Medical Waste. The medical facility coordinator will most 
likely be managing RMW activities during sustainment with assistance from 
the BEE, but may also require assistance from civil engineer environmental 
personnel. If the scope of contingency operations begins to expand, additional 
equipment (i.e., generators, refrigeration units, etc.) may be required to ensure 
RMW can be properly stored/managed. Storage facilities may need to 
transition from temporary to semi-permanent standards with additional safety 
equipment and security. Specialized medical waste incinerators meeting more 
stringent standards may need to be installed. Engineers assist in all of these 
efforts. Information, including fact sheets on managing RMW during 
contingencies can be found on the USAPHC website. Following are some 
considerations and recommendations for managing RMW during sustainment: 
 Consider adopting RMW management standards and procedures in 
OEBGD, country-specific FGS (if available), etc. 
 Revise site SOP; incorporate lessons learned from initial beddown  
 Ensure RMW disposal techniques consistent CCDR’s standards 
 Acquire additional equipment/supplies needed to manage RMW 
 Ensure RMW separated from other waste at point of generation 
 Ensure RMW containers marked with universal biohazard symbol 
 Ensure containers labeled “BIOHAZARD”; identifies generator 
 Establish controls to prevent unauthorized access to RMW 
 Purchase RMW incinerators meeting DOD or CCDR standards 
 Determine if RMW incineration ash is hazardous or nonhazardous 
 Dispose of hazardous ash from RMW incineration as HW  
 Use steam sterilization to decontaminate RMW; maintain logs 
 Use chlorine solution for sharps containers for biological organisms 
 Consider transporting RMW to nearest installation for disposal 
 Consider contracting with medical waste facility for RMW disposal 
 Consider local contract/AOR contract for RMW incineration 
 Ensure contractor oversight for proper RMW management   
 Purchase/install commercial medical waste treatment system 
 Consider retrograding RMW to U.S. for treatment and disposal if in-
country or in-theater disposal not practicable

73 
 
4.9. Pest Management. Some key areas to place additional emphasis on 
during sustainment include training, pest surveillance, and IPM. Site personnel 
should continuously be made aware of threats from pests and disease vectors, 
and ways they can contribute to minimizing these threats with good field 
hygiene and sanitation practices. Training should be part of in-processing, 
since personnel will likely be rapidly rotating in and out and transiting through 
the site. Pest surveillance should begin as soon as possible. In a general sense, 
this involves determining the presence and estimating the density of pest and 
vector species, determining the health risk they pose, and implementing IPM 
techniques to reduce the population to an acceptable level. Medical personnel 
usually lead pest surveillance efforts. IPM is aimed at preventing pests and 
disease vectors from threatening personnel health and safety or causing 
unacceptable damage to property. This is accomplished through a variety of 
methods including habitat modification, biological control, regulatory control, 
and judicious use of least-hazardous pesticides. Details on IPM can be found 
in TG 24. Following are some considerations for pest management activities 
during sustainment:  
 Consider adopting pest management standards and procedures in 
OEBGD, country-specific FGS (if available), etc. 
 Along with BEE, develop aggressive awareness/training program 
 Begin pest surveillance efforts to identify and respond to threats  
 Implement IPM plan in coordination with BEE and PH 
 Reduce pesticide usage while increasing other IPM measures 
 Record pesticide use on DD Form 1532, Pest Management Report, 
and DD Form 1532-1, Pest Management Maintenance Record 
 Ensure safety and other guidance on pesticide labels are followed 
 Ensure herbicides are applied as approved in pest management plan   
 If necessary get assistance on airfield wildlife control problems from 
CCDR’s environmental staff or BASH team at AF Safety Center       
 Follow manufacturer and CCDRs guidance on managing HM/HW  
 Increase spill response capability (e.g. equipment, and supplies) 
 Upgrade pesticides storage area; ensure secondary containment 
 Dedicate clearly marked vehicles for transporting pesticides 
 Consider contract option for IPM; ensure strong oversight

74 
 
4.10. Storm Water. Once initial beddown is complete, the environmental 
officer should begin focusing on upgrading expedient methods used to manage 
storm water to higher construction standards, particularly if there is indication 
of a surge in site population or it appears the site will be occupied for an 
extended period. A Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) can be 
developed at this point to identify sources of pollution, guide design and 
construction activities, and prescribe methods and treatment to minimize soil 
and groundwater contamination. An analysis of the site can reveal areas where 
ponding tends to occur, attracting mosquitoes and other disease causing 
vectors, and migratory birds that could be hazardous to flying operations. 
These areas can then be graded (sloped) or filled in. A network of drains and 
ditches can be constructed to direct storm water away from the camp, 
construction areas, HM/HW storage areas, vehicle refueling points, and 
potential water sources. Retention ponds can be constructed to capture and 
treat storm water for nonpotable uses. Following are some considerations for 
managing and minimizing the effects of storm water during sustainment: 
 Incorporate lessons learned from initial beddown into a SWPPP 
 Require watershed protection to be considered during construction   
 Require written approval for any activities that destroy vegetation 
 Purchase tanks to collect/treat/store storm water for non-potable use 
 Use compost to prevent storm water from reaching water sources 
 Relocate HM/HW storage downgradient of water sources if needed 
 Construct berms around HM/HW, POL and pesticide storage areas 
 Focus on grading areas to minimize the impact of storm water 
 Install catch basins and oil/water separators in maintenance areas 
 Ensure oil/water separators are working properly; clean as needed 
 Ensure waste collection containers have lids and are leak free   
 Designate level areas with cover for waste collection containers 
 Provide secondary containment for waste collection containers 
 Ensure toxic or hazardous substances are not placed in dumpsters 
 Have solid waste picked up frequently and keep containers clean 
 Regularly inspect septic systems and immediately repair any leaks 
 Regularly inspect all storm water management efforts and maintain 
best management practices to continually improves these efforts

75 
 
4.11. Air Pollution. During sustainment, efforts to minimize air pollution 
should become more focused. If the site population increases, so will the 
sources and amount of pollution. The environmental officer should have 
knowledge of the sources of pollution at this stage. Focus on sources of 
particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and 
lead; particulate matter is usually generated from factories, power plants, 
incinerators, vehicles, equipment, burn pits, burn-out latrines, construction 
activities and fugitive dust. The BEE will analyze occupational health and 
environmental health exposure pathways and monitor for pollutants as 
necessary. The environmental staff should be aware of these sources and 
involved in minimization efforts. Following are some recommendations for 
minimizing the impact military operations have on the quality of air and 
personnel health. Additional information concerning air pollution during 
contingencies can be found on the USAPHC website. 
 Update SW management procedures from lessons learned 
 Reassess impact of nearby industrial plans and the effect of TICs  
 Establish local contracts to remove and dispose of SW if possible 
 Eliminate open burning for SW; purchase high-quality incinerators 
 Establish procedures to routinely sample emissions from incinerators 
 Minimize fuel jettisons during flight activities to reduce vapors 
 Minimize refueling at hottest part of day; reduce VOC emissions 
 Acquire modern power generation equipment with filtration systems 
 Acquire larger units to cover more area and reduce overall emissions 
 Establish guidance to prevent intentional/accidental release of ozone 
depleting substances 
 Avoid demolition/renovation activities that would disturb asbestos    
 Locate older equipment where it poses the least hazard to personnel 
 Extend the stack on older heating units well above breathing zones 
 Acquire heating units equipped with modern filtration systems 
 Upgrade exhaust systems on vehicles; limit traffic in certain areas 
 Use gray water; soil solidification products to reduce air particulates 
 Issue PPE (i.e., goggles, cravats, etc.) to protect against dust, sand  
 Focus education and training efforts on product recycling and reuse 
 Substitute HM products with those less harmful to environment

4.12. Historical and Cultural Resources. Although initial phases of military 
operations are typically conducted without knowing exactly where all of these 
sites and resources are located, they are often discovered when activities shift 
more towards sustainment. As an example, pottery, bones, graveyard markers, 
religious sites, or other sensitive areas might be discovered during excavation 
or other types of construction activities. At that time, all activities should stop. 
Although operations might be temporarily affected, destruction of a national 
asset will seriously impede long-term diplomatic and peacekeeping efforts. 
One way to reduce the possibility of destroying or degrading these assets is by 
requiring permits coordinated by environmental officials to be accomplished 
prior to any activity. Permits can also prevent personnel from unknowingly 
damaging existing electrical or communication lines, water, sewage, POL 
distribution systems or underground storage equipment. Following are some 
considerations for managing efforts to protect and preserve historical and 
cultural resources during sustainment:   
 Continually update the SOP as additional resources are discovered 
 Maintain list of historical and cultural resources in the area 
 Advise leadership of potential impact of missions on resources 
 Maintain location of all sensitive areas on maps and other diagrams 
 Conduct training to make personnel aware of assets and policies 
 Declare sensitive areas off-limits if operational mission is unaffected 
 Conduct training and military maneuvers away from these areas 
 Construct fencing, berms, signage to protect areas; warn personnel 
 Establish policy requiring coordination with BCE environmental staff 
prior to digging 
 Require leadership approval for activities near these resources 
 Relocate HM/HW storage areas hastily sited during initial beddown 
 Relocate refueling/maintenance areas hastily sited during beddown 
 Minimize effects of demolition/munitions activities near these areas

4.13. Natural Resources. During sustainment, additional efforts can be placed 
on protecting, conserving, and sustaining natural resources. Time should be 
available to reassess actions taken during initial beddown to ensure site plans 
and activities take into consideration impact on natural resources. The 
environmental staff will need to continually focus on education and awareness 
training as personnel rotate in and out, particularly for transient personnel and 
units who will only occupy the site for a short period of time. The CCDRs 
policy on management of local natural resources should become part of normal 
in-processing procedures during sustainment. Along with the policy and a map 
of the area indicating sensitive habitats and other areas that should be avoided, 
a list of protected plants, animals, and other species can be provided to 
individuals upon arrival. Following are some considerations for managing 
natural resources during sustainment:         
 Update SOP goals for protecting/conserving natural resources 
 Advise leaders of potential impact of missions on natural resources 
 Increase training on protecting and conserving natural resources 
 Consider placing certain areas off-limits to military activities 
 Periodically prepare ECRs indicating condition of natural resources 
 Increase air sampling capability; minimize pollutant emissions  
 Increase spill response capability; explore landfarming options 
 Increase efforts to protect surface waters from storm water runoff   
 Establish policy requiring coordination with BCE environmental staff 
prior to removing vegetation 
 Establish policy requiring coordination with BCE environmental staff 
prior to excavating  
 Reduce the number of HWAPs to reduce risks of accidental spills 
 Implement IPM program to minimize amount of pesticides used   
 Limit impact maneuvers and refueling activities on natural resources  
 Relocate HM/HW storage areas hastily sited during initial beddown 
 Minimize demolition/munitions activities near natural resources 
 Explore opportunities to recycle/reuse to conserve natural resources 
 Explore renewable energy to reduce demand for natural resources 
 Limit local contracting efforts that deplete scarce natural resources

4.14. Flora and Fauna. During sustainment, efforts to avoid or minimize 
damage to flora and fauna should remain a high environmental priority. As 
contingency operations begin to stabilize, there may be a tendency to expand 
and explore areas further outside of the initial camp boundaries. This could be 
caused by a surge in operations to achieve certain CCDR objectives, such as 
reducing insurgent activities supporting stability operations. Care should be 
taken not to encroach upon areas inhabited by environmentally sensitive flora 
and fauna and/or threatened or endangered species. The environmental officer 
must continually advise leadership on operational plans that could damage or 
destroy these assets so informed decisions can be made. Following are some 
additional recommendations to consider when planning for the protection of 
flora and fauna during contingency operations:   
 Consider adopting standards and procedures in OEBGD or country-
specific FGS (if available) to protect flora and fauna 
 Integrate commander’s policy into SOPs affecting daily operations 
 Officially declare environmentally sensitive areas off limits 
 Construct fencing or berms to prevent entry into sensitive areas 
 Post signs warning personnel about environmentally sensitive areas 
 Continually update maps identifying sensitive areas as discovered 
 Prohibit construction activities in these areas if at all possible 
 Establish policy requiring coordination with BCE environmental staff 
prior to construction activities 
 Establish policy requiring coordination with BCE environmental staff 
prior to vegetation removal 
 Enforce CITES and DTR to protect threatened/endangered species 
 Assess the impact of mission-essential excavation on flora and fauna 
 Be aware of the seasonal behavior of wildlife in the deployed region 
 Seek to avoid areas inhabited by sensitive flora and fauna 
 Avoid habitats of endangered and threatened species   
 Expand training efforts on laws governing wildlife trade

Chapter 5 
SITE CLOSURE/REDEPLOYMENT 
 
5.1. Overview. Once it is determined a site occupied by U.S. forces will be 
closed and forces redeployed, ACS efforts shift to those actions needed to 
recover the force. In addition to necessary logistical and administrative 
actions, environmental activities will be driven largely by international 
agreements, combatant command (to include subordinate unified command) 
policy, and the environmental annex of the OPORD. 
5.2. Closure Survey. Upon notification of site closure, the environmental 
function should conduct a thorough environmental survey of the site. This 
survey is conducted IAW international agreements and/or guidance issued by 
the CCDR via the environmental staff. The purpose of the survey is to identify 
critical environmental issues that must be resolved prior to departure. The 
environmental officer, BEE, PH, and Safety personnel should conduct the 
survey together. It is important to compare the results of this survey with the 
EBS, conducted upon initial occupancy of the site, to assess the effectiveness 
of environmental initiatives and also determine what remedial actions might be 
required. The list is not all-inclusive, but it can provide a good starting point to 
develop a site environmental closure plan. Maintain all documentation to 
prepare the final closure report prior to redeployment.     
5.3. Site Environmental Closure Plan. The site environmental closure plan is 
developed to ensure all tasks necessary to properly close the site are identified. 
Attachment 9 contains a checklist that may be useful. It might be helpful to 
use backwards planning if a reasonably firm date for redeployment has been 
established. Start with the redeployment date and work backwards, 
establishing timelines for every action required to properly close the site. At a 
minimum, address procedures for turn-in and accountability of HW and excess 
HM, remediation and documentation of POL spills, emptying and cleaning 
POL tanks and separators, and POL waste turn-in. Stay in contact with the 
combatant command environmental staff and maintain all documentation. This 
will assist in preparing the final closure report prior to redeployment. 
5.3.1. Determine Contract Support. At this point in contingency operations, 
DLA Disposition Services will likely be established within or near the AOR to 
oversee proper disposition of excess HM and HW. This resource, as well as 
any local contracts established (e.g., SW removal, medical waste collection 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
80 
 
and disposal, etc.) should be considered in the closure plan. Coordinate with 
these resources to establish timelines for cleanup and disposal activities and 
address terminating any contracts no longer required.  
5.3.2. Shut Down Disposal Sites. The closure plan should also address 
timelines and procedures for cleaning, clearing, and closing disposal sites, 
including burn pits, landfills, lagoons, latrines, etc. 
5.4. Closing Standards. Ensure closure actions are consistent with applicable 
guidance (e.g., international agreement, combatant command [to include 
subordinate unified command] policy, OPORD). Key areas include: 
5.4.1. Equipment Retrograde. When retrograding supplies or equipment 
upon closing a site, planners must be aware of E.O. 13112, which directs 
federal agencies to prevent introduction of invasive species into the natural 
ecosystems of the U.S. Use of wash racks for thorough cleaning helps ensure 
equipment pass inspection by Customs and the Department of Agriculture.  
5.4.2. Medical Supplies. Serviceable medical supplies should be collected and 
retrograded through medical channels. Medical waste will be removed and 
disposed of with guidance from medical personnel. 
5.4.3. Pesticides. Serviceable pesticides will be collected and reissued within 
the AOR or retrograded to home station. 
5.4.4. Solid Waste. Collect and dispose of all solid waste through existing 
means. Also make sure any contractor-provided equipment is removed from 
the site IAW contract provisions. Collect serviceable metals and scrap (e.g., 
drums, concertina wire, vehicle parts, etc.) for turn-in/ reissue. 
5.4.5. Pits and Latrines. Cover and mark the date of closure and unit 
designation on all urine, soakage, SW, and burn pits. Empty burn-out latrines. 
5.4.6. Recycling. Wood and cardboard products should be collected and 
turned in through supply channels for recycling if this option is available.     
5.4.7. Fuel Equipment. Fuel bladders, liners, and fuel distribution equipment 
should be thoroughly cleaned for retrograde or disposed of as appropriate.   
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
81 
 
5.5. Disposition of Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste. 
5.5.1. Reissue. Turn in excess HM to the established supply function for 
transfer to main supply points or other units in the AOR that may require the 
material for continued operations. 
5.5.2. Recycling. This alternative can be used for select HW if consistent with 
local practices and medical personnel determine there is no risk to human 
health and safety and the environment. Approval should be obtained from the 
combatant command environmental staff. 
5.5.3. Retrograde. If necessary, HM or HW can be transported back to home 
station. In this case, make sure containers are properly packaged, labeled, and 
prepared for transportation and shipped according to combatant command 
guidance and Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements. Also, 
comply with 40 CFR Part 262 and consider international agreements (i.e., 
SOFA, transit, and disposal agreements) and the laws of all countries involved 
with transporting the HM or HW from its origin to destination.  
5.5.4. Disposal. HM that cannot be reissued to other units in the AOR, or for 
which it has been determined to be impractical to transport back to home 
station, can be disposed of as HW. If DLA Disposition Services is established 
in or near the AOR, they will be assisting in proper disposal. Any HM/HW not 
disposed of via DLA Disposition Services should be reported through the 
chain of command to the combatant command environmental staff. 
5.5.5. Local Contract. Disposing of HM/HW via local contract is allowed if 
done in a manner protective of human health and safety and the environment. 
Obtain approval from the combatant command environmental staff. 
5.5.6. Abandonment. If authorized by international agreements and 
combatant command (to include subordinate unified command) policy, and the 
OPORD, HM/HW may be abandoned if senior leaders determine it is 
necessary under combat or other hostile conditions. If this becomes necessary, 
note the quantity, type, and location so it can be recovered as soon as 
practicable upon cessation of hostile conditions. 
5.6. Site Remediation. Upon determination to close a site, forces may be 
required by international agreement or combatant command policy to address 
environmental contamination caused by U.S. forces during the course of 
operations. Guidance for conducting site cleanup at non-permanent DOD 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
82 
 
installations overseas is usually issued by the combatant command or may be 
contained in the Environmental Considerations Annex of the applicable 
OPORD.  
5.7. Closure Report. The purpose of the closure report is to document the 
environmental conditions of the site at the time of redeployment. This report 
should be prepared by the environmental officer with assistance from BEE, 
PH, and Safety after all closure activities are completed. The report is used to 
document the condition of water sources, soil, natural and cultural resources, 
air quality, and other environmental conditions as compared to the initial EBS. 
The closure report can also be used to help the U.S. defend against pressure to 
remediate or pay for environmental damage not caused by U.S. activities at the 
contingency site. Ensure the report includes maps, photos, and grid 
coordinates for all areas where activities potentially harmful to the 
environment are located (e.g., maintenance functions, burn pit, HWSA, 
medical facilities, landfills, latrines, etc.). Contact the combatant command 
environmental staff for complete guidance on preparing the closure report. 
Once completed, a copy of the closure report should be forwarded to the 
combatant command environmental staff or as directed in the Environmental 
Annex of the OPORD.

ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE SURVEY INSTRUCTIONS 
 
A2.1. Purpose of EBS. State reason(s) for the EBS, the site/location where the 
survey was/is being conducted, and include the date(s) of the survey. 
A2.1.1. The primary reasons are to identify environmental, health, and safety 
conditions that pose a potential health threat to deployed personnel and to alert 
personnel to existing contamination at a site prior to a deployment. 
A2.1.2. The EBS is also used to document environmental conditions during 
initial occupancy. It captures predeployment environmental damages and 
serves as a basis for comparing post-deployment environmental conditions to 
determine the extent, if any, of damage caused by U.S. personnel.  
A2.2. Survey Methodology. State the methods, procedures, and techniques 
used to gather and analyze the information. 
A2.2.1. Methods, procedures, and techniques usually involve searching for and 
analyzing existing surveys, inspection reports, HWMPs, spill plans, utility 
drawings, previous EBS, etc. Other sources include maps, titles, and deeds that 
can be used to determine locations of tanks/equipment.  
A2.2.2. Sample collections can be taken to determine water quality, quality of 
surface and ground water supply, radon levels, presence of PCBs or lead paint, 
and sources of contamination. 
A2.2.3. Interviews with personnel familiar with the site/location or persons 
who live nearby are useful in gathering information to complete the EBS. 
Interpreters may be needed if interviewers do not speak the local language. 
A2.3. Findings. Describe the history, current use and condition. 
A2.3.1 History.  
A2.3.1.1. Contact the combatant command environmental staff to obtain 
relative data, review chain of title records if available and accessible, and 
analyze any reports that can be obtained locally. In addition, conduct 
interviews with persons in the area who are familiar with the site/location. 
A2.3.1.2. Attempt to identify specific chemicals and/or materials associated 
with the site, and determine whether any spills or cleanup actions took place. 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
90 
 
A2.3.1.3. Evaluate aerial images to help determine past uses or to provide 
indications of previous beddowns, HM usage and storage, HW storage and/or 
disposal, storage tanks, landfill areas, etc. 
A2.3.2. Current Use. Identify current use and each facility therein. 
A2.3.2.1. Describe the land area, all structures, roads, and utilities. 
A2.3.2.2. If there are training areas, describe how they are used.  
A2.3.2.3. Interview individuals on the site/location and those nearby. 
A2.3.2.4. Describe areas adjacent to the site/location; include past use and 
determine for what purpose the adjacent property is currently being used. 
A2.3.2.5. Describe proposed site usage including expected duration, activities 
to take place and equipment to be used. Determine possible effect activities 
might have on the health and safety of deployed personnel and the locals. 
A2.3.3. Environmental Condition. 
A2.3.3.1. Check for problems with air quality in all facilities on the site.  
A2.3.3.2. Identify water source(s), capacities, and the condition of water 
supply lines (check for corrosion, leaks, lead pipes, etc.). Determine if samples 
were taken and if medical personnel inspected water sources. Check supply 
lines; assess vulnerability of water source to tampering or contamination. 
A2.3.3.3. Identify sources of wastewater and describe the capacity and 
condition of existing wastewater systems (pits, catch basins, dry wells, 
lagoons, etc.). Describe how wastewater is collected, treated, discharged or 
reused, and how it will be done under the proposed usage. 
A2.3.3.4. Determine if HW was stored at the location. Check for hazardous 
substances and petroleum products. Check aboveground and underground 
storage tanks, wells, and drums for HM or HW. Look for vent pipes, fill pipes, 
or other indicators of underground storage tanks. Look for signs of spills, 
leakage or contamination (stained soil, distressed vegetation, dead/diseased 
wildlife). Determine the effect on the proposed usage. 
A2.3.3.5. Identify SW disposal areas. Check for signs of dumping. Try to 
determine what materials were dumped. Look for areas where SW may have 
been burned or buried. Determine if disposal contracts or other agreements 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
91 
 
exist and describe how deployed forces will handle SW, including proposed 
layout of storage areas in relation to beddown areas.  
A2.3.3.6. Identify sources of medical/biohazard wastes, accumulation and 
disposal areas. Check for signs of dumping. Look for areas where medical 
waste may have been buried. Describe how deployed forces might handle 
medical waste, including proposed collection and disposal areas and their 
relation to beddown areas, food service areas, and water sources.  
A2.3.3.7. Determine if any fixed petroleum distribution points exist and look 
for ground contamination. Look for signs of aboveground or underground 
storage tanks and check for leaks, spills, and/or contamination. Determine if 
the tanks are still in use; if not, attempt to determine when they were taken out 
of service. Look for petroleum storage areas and document the conditions.  
A2.3.3.8. Determine if any areas at the location or areas adjacent to the site 
might present a noise hazard that may need to be avoided. Also, based on 
proposed activities at the site, determine if any areas might pose restrictions on 
deployed forces based on the noise produced by the proposed activities. 
A2.3.3.9. Describe pesticide and herbicide storage and use. Try to determine 
what chemicals were stored, used, where and how often. Look for indications 
that pesticides or herbicides may have been dumped or buried. Apply the same 
criteria to adjacent areas to determine the impact these activities might have on 
deployed forces, water sources, beddown areas, etc.   
A2.3.3.10. Determine cultural or historical areas or facilities and what 
restrictions might be placed on deployed forces or activities as a result. 
A2.3.3.11. Look for species of threatened or endangered plants or animals, 
wetlands or wildlife habitats. Describe these resources in detail, and determine

STORAGE SEGREGATION 
 
A6.1. Generators of HW must ensure waste streams remain segregated. 
Improper segregation of HW streams at the point of generation could result in 
an incompatible waste mixture that may pose a significant health risk. 
A6.2. If hazardous wastes and non-hazardous wastes are mixed, the wastes 
must be managed and disposed of as hazardous waste. This will drastically 
increase the cost of disposal. 
A6.3. Proper segregation at the point of generation simplifies overall 
management and goes a long way towards protecting human health and the 
environment, reducing disposal costs, and enhancing recycling potential. 
Figure A6.1. General Incompatibilities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A6.4. 
Segregate 
storage 
into 
general 
categories 
(i.e., 
reactives, 
flammables/ignitables, corrosives, toxics, etc.). 
 
        
AFH 10-222 Volume 4, 1 September 2012 
 
103 
 
A6.5. Further segregation may be required based on the compatibility of 
individual materials. Reference the MSDS for each material to identify 
appropriate storage. 
A6.6. Storage sections should be separated by a distance of six feet or a 
physical barrier to prevent incompatible materials from mixing and producing 
chemical reactions or toxic fumes (see charts below). 
A6.7. Containers that hold reactive or flammable materials or waste should be 
grounded during storage, and only non-sparking tools should be used when 
handling these containers.
