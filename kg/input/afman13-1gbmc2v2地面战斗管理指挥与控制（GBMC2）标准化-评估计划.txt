2.3.2.12.  The HHQ Evaluation Standardization Assessment Program (ESAP). 
2.3.2.12.1.  HHQ ESAP Description: 
2.3.2.12.1.1.  The HHQ ESAP consists of a series of crew evaluations performed 
by HHQ examiners limited to crewmember positional evaluations. The intent of the 
program is to ensure that the unit crew evaluation system is providing accurate 
information to the unit CC regarding the qualification of the unit’s mission crews. 
The program assesses the capability of the unit’s examiners to make accurate 
objective decisions and consistent subjective decisions during unit crew 
evaluations. The program evaluates the examiner’s ability to construct and execute 
a thorough and fair evaluation. 
2.3.2.12.1.2.  Evaluations are conducted in accordance with AFMAN 13-1MDS 
Volume 2 (Includes AFMAN 13-1BCC Volume 2, Battle Control Center (BCC) 
Evaluation Criteria; AFMAN 13-1CRC Volume 2, Control and Reporting Center 
(CRC) 
Evaluation 
Criteria; 
and 
AFMAN 
13-1AOC 
Volume 
2, 
Standardization/Evaluation Program -Air Operations Center (AOC)/Operation 
Center (OC), the unit’s designed operational capability (DOC) statement and 
associated publications. Unit Stan/Eval (CCV) administrative programs are 
inspected separately under DAFI 90-302. 
2.3.2.12.1.3.  The HHQ ESAP is part of the UEI cycle. The results are reported to 
the MAJCOM/Inspector General and may be included in the wing’s final UEI 
report. The HHQ ESAP may be completed in one visit, or in multiple visits, 
depending on the unit’s schedule and availability of HHQ evaluators. The timing 
of the ESAP visit(s) may be aligned with any UEI on-site inspection, or as stand-
alone HHQ/Stan/Eval visit, but must be completed before the end of the Capstone 
visit to ensure the results are incorporated into the wing’s final Inspector General 
(IG) report. 
2.3.2.12.1.3.1.  If an ESAP cannot be accomplished during an inspection 
period, ACC/A3TV will document the circumstances (e.g., lack of funding, 
manning resources, etc.) to be incorporated into the final UEI report via 
Memorandum for Record (MFR) or Inspector General Evaluation Management 
System (IGEMS) note entry. 
2.3.2.12.1.4.  The ESAP visit schedule is coordinated between NAF Stan/Eval 
and/or MAJCOM Stan/Eval offices and the unit’s Group Stan/Eval office based on 
the unit’s schedule and HHQ evaluator availability. The desired window for an 
ESAP is six months prior to the UEI Capstone event. NAF or MAJCOM Stan/Eval 
offices then provide the final ESAP visit schedule to MAJCOM/IG gatekeeper. 
10 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
HHQ evaluators will primarily be sourced from applicable MAJCOM and aligned 
NAF Stan/Eval offices. If not available, the MAJCOM and NAF Stan/Eval may 
source HHQ evaluators from other MAJCOMs, NAFs and/or wings. As a last 
resort, HHQ evaluators may be sourced from the inspected unit. 
2.3.2.12.1.4.1.  All ESAP HHQ Examiners that are not assigned to the 
MAJCOM or NAF Stan/Eval Offices are identified on a temporary HHQ Flight 
Examiner (FE) letter for the period identified for the ESAP event. The 
temporary letter requires a memorandum signed by the Chief of ACC/A3TV. 
2.3.2.12.2.  HHQ ESAP Goals: 
2.3.2.12.2.1.  Establish number of FE Objectivity SPOT Evaluations to be 
accomplished prior to arrival at the evaluated unit based on availability of unit 
Standardization and Evaluation Examiners (SEEs) and planned evaluations during 
the inspection window. Planned number will be included on ESAP report. 
2.3.2.12.2.2.  This percentage is accomplished by two means: Establish number of 
Qualification/Mission (QUAL/MSN) evaluations to be accomplished prior to 
arrival at evaluated unit based on availability of aircrew and planned evaluations 
during the inspection window. Planned number will be included on ESAP report. 
2.3.2.12.2.2.1.  Direct evaluations by HHQ Examiners 
2.3.2.12.2.2.2.  Evaluations provided by unit examiners that are observed 
during HHQ examiner objectivity SPOT evaluation. 
2.3.2.12.2.3.  Crew Evaluations should contain an even sampling of QUAL/MSN 
evaluations for each crew position. The exact composition of evaluation types is up 
to the ESAP visit team lead and the unit chief of Stan/Eval. 
2.3.2.12.3.  HHQ ESAP Reporting: 
2.3.2.12.3.1.  The ESAP visit team chief reports the results to the unit commander 
using the format in Figure 2.1. A copy will be sent to the inspected WG/CC, 
WG/IG, OG/CC, Squadron/CC, Squadron/CCV, NAF/A3, NAF/A3V, Air Combat 
Command Director of Operations (ACC/A3), Air Combat Command Flight 
Operations Division (ACC/A3T), ACC/A3TV, ACC/A3C, ACC/A3CG, National 
Guard Bureau Airfield Operations and Command and Control Forces Division 
(NGB A3/10) (Air National Guard units) and applicable MAJCOMs no later than 
2 weeks after the end of each ESAP visit. If the ESAP visit is executed at the same 
time as the UEI Capstone visit, the ESAP visit report will be submitted to the 
MAJCOM/IG in time to be included in the inspected wing’s UEI final report. 
2.3.2.12.3.2.  Superior performers may be recognized on the ESAP report at the 
discretion of the ESAP visit team chief. 
2.3.2.12.3.3.  A template for the ESAP visit report can be found at the ACC/A3TV 
SharePoint®

3.3.2.16.2.  Document waivers in Stan/Eval board minutes (see Attachment 2). 
3.3.3.  Transfers. 
3.3.3.1.  Qualifications/certifications. Upon arrival of a member into the unit, the Chief of 
Stan/Eval will, after reviewing the member’s FEF, make a recommendation to the 
Squadron Commander (Sq/CC) whether to execute a qualification transfer or refer the 
member to Operations Training for formal IQT. The Sq/CC will review current 
qualifications and certifications to determine actions needed for member to operate unit 
mission and equipment. If the member holds a current qualification (positional and/or 
instructor) in an equivalent duty position (e.g., WD to WD, Mission System Operator 
(MSO) to MSO, Air Weapons Officer (AWO) to ABM, Senior Director to Section Lead 
ABM) from another battle management MDS that operates a like system (as identified in 
the MDS Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Message (RTM)), the Sq/CC may accept the 
member’s current AF Form 8 in lieu of the gaining unit’s CRC/BCC/DRU/BMC2 QUAL 
evaluation via a qualification transfer. (Note: CCs can choose to retain positional 
qualifications with or without the INSTR qualification. An INSTR qualification can also 
by accepted but their ability to perform instructor duties restricted via the unit letter of 
qualification/certification until the desired experience level is achieved). 
3.3.3.1.1.  Qualification Transfers are not a substitute for conversion training from 
legacy crew positions (e.g., Surveillance Technician (ST) QUAL cannot transfer to 
MSO, nor does an Air Surveillance Officer (ASO) directly transfer to ABM). Any 
exceptions to this will be approved/documented on a case-by-case basis by ACC/A3C). 
Qualifications will retain their expiration dates, eligibility periods, and approved 
extensions as well as any area restrictions (as applicable). 
3.3.3.1.2.  CCs may also choose to retain mission qualifications. This does not 
automatically make the member Combat Mission Ready (CMR) but acknowledges the 
member has completed Mission Qualification Training (MQT) and can receive tailored 
20 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
theater specific training as necessary before documenting their ability to perform 
missions via the unit letter of qualification/certification. (Note: All BCC qualifications 
are considered QUAL/MSN evaluations so CCs may choose to retain the Qualification 
but require the completion of MQT followed by an MSN Checkride). 
3.3.3.1.3.  Transfer Requirements. Member’s qualification must be complete and active 
(cannot be unqualified (UQ), missing requisites, or require additional training). 
Transfers do not remove any existing restrictions. (Example: WD or ABM with control 
restrictions do not get removed without a SPOT evaluation on applicable areas or 
completion of a full evaluation). 
3.3.3.1.4.  Stan/Eval offices will ensure members who transfer qualifications are 
briefed that their next evaluation will be in accordance with the current MDS Volume 
2 areas to include any new/unique gradings that were not part of their previous 
qualification requirements (e.g., BCC AWO to ABM is now graded to the “Air 
Refueling” area). 
3.3.3.1.5.  Members being granted a qualification transfer must satisfactorily complete 
Operations Training prescribed MDS difference training (via a tailored training plan), 
to include the unit's local orientation program, as directed by the Sq/CC and 
administered by the Squadron Director of Operations (Sq/DO). 
3.3.3.1.5.1.  Following MDS difference training the member will remain with 
Operations Training to complete MQT (if an MSN qualification is not transferred). 
Once MQT complete, the member will be released to Stan/Eval to be administered 
an INIT MSN evaluation. The Chief of Stan/Eval is authorized to direct a combined 
INIT QUAL/MSN evaluation to align qualification timelines, at their discretion. 
3.3.3.2.  Documentation. Qualification transfers will be documented by memorandum for 
record, signed by the Sq/CC, and maintained in the member’s digital/hardcopy FEF (see 
attachment 8). Date of the transfer will be added as an AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation 
entry “Qualification Transfer.” The memorandum will specify the following information: 
3.3.3.2.1.  MDS/Crew Position and Qualifications being transferred. 
3.3.3.2.2.  Certifications being transferred. 
3.3.3.2.3.  AF Form 8 Restrictions. 
3.3.3.2.4.  Qualification expiration dates. 
3.3.3.2.5.  Additional Remarks. Provide brief justification detailing the members 
experience level and training background. This can include total primary/instructor 
hours, examiner experience, combat deployments, exercise event support, or any other 
details relevant to member’s battle management command and control background. 
This area can also be used to document any qualifications/certifications that are not 
being transferred. 
3.3.3.2.6.  AF Form 8 to be transferred from previous MDS as attachment. 
3.3.3.2.7.  Local Area Procedures/Closed Book Exam date and score. (Note: the 
qualification transfer is complete once the member has taken the appropriate closed 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
21 
book exam. Individuals can enter off station MQT (as required) so long as the gaining 
Sq/CC has signed the qualification transfer MFR.) 
3.3.3.3.  AETC qualification acceptance. Following review of an individual’s AF Form 8, 
the unit commander may accept evaluations administered at the 607th Air Control 
Squadron (607 ACS), the CRC formal training unit (FTU), or evaluations administered at 
units utilizing the Battlespace Command and Control Center (BC3) system software (e.g., 
BC3-AF, BC3-T, etc).  The unit commander may also accept the AF Form 8s awarded to 
graduates of the Weapons Director Ground-Based Training Course at the 337th Air Control 
Squadron (337 ACS) in lieu of IQT.  (Note: BMC2 designated qualifications for ABMs at 
the 337 ACS will follow qualification transfer procedures outlined in paragraphs 3.3.3.1 
through 3.3.3.2.7.). 
3.3.3.4.  Individuals on temporary duty (TDY) status to a unit, with like equipment, can 
perform unsupervised operations duties if the crewmember: 
3.3.3.4.1.  Provides a current Department of Defense (DD) Form 2992, Medical

Chapter 5 
EVALUATIONS 
5.1.  General.  The Stan/Eval program utilizes mission crew qualification evaluations to ensure 
qualification of crewmembers and supplementary evaluations to ensure standardization of 
operations. 
5.1.1.  The mission crew evaluation is an assessment of individual crewmember’s capability 
to accomplish assigned mission crew duties in specific duty positions. 
5.1.2.  A crew qualification is a documented designation that identifies a crewmember as 
having the capability to accomplish specific crew duties. These crew qualifications are broken 
into three types: 
5.1.2.1.  Basic Qualification. Designation allowing a crewmember to perform the basic 
duties of a particular crew position in the unit’s specified MDS. 
5.1.2.2.  Mission Qualification. Designation allowing a crewmember to employ the 
assigned MDS in accomplishing the unit’s operational or DOC statement mission. 
5.1.2.3.  Instructor Qualification. Designation allowing a crewmember to instruct and 
provide operations crew supervision of unqualified and/or uncertified crewmembers. 
5.1.3.  Multiple Qualifications. Multiple qualification guidance applies to crewmembers who 
maintain qualification in two or more mission crew positions in an MDS. Multi-qualified 
individuals will complete MSN evaluations, if applicable, in accordance with AFMAN 13-
1MDS Volume 2 for their secondary or tertiary qualifications. (T-2) (Exception: Units where 
MSN evaluations consist of only an MSN exam). 
5.1.3.1.  Members who maintain an equivalent aircrew qualification on an airborne 
platform (e.g., E-3) do not need MAJCOM/A3 approval as this is an AFMAN 11-202 
Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program, paragraph 5.10 requirement 
that applies only to aircrew on multiple aircraft. (Example: The 552 ACW/CC can maintain 
both an E-3 and CRC ABM qualification without specific MAJCOM/A3 approval). 
5.1.4.  Group or unit supplements may provide guidance for local evaluation profiles of 
crewmembers who hold multiple qualifications to ensure grading areas that are common 
among those qualifications are only evaluated once within a single evaluation cycle. 
5.1.5.  The positional phase is conducted during a Live/Virtual/Constructive mission scenario 
to evaluate crewmember performance. If it is infeasible to accomplish a required area live (e.g., 
aircraft emergency), the examiner may elect to evaluate the area(s) by an alternate method 
(e.g., simulator or verbally), to complete the evaluation. If the examiner determines the 
required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, then an additional 
mission will be required. (T-2) 
5.1.6.  Examinees on duty not involving control status may receive an evaluation in the virtual 
or constructive environment if not restricted by a DD Form 2992 and agreed upon by the 
examinee and approved by the unit CC. 
5.1.7.  For CRCs, evaluations may be accomplished on the CRC portion of the Consolidated 
Simulation Building (CSB) located at Tinker Air Force Base (AFB); or any facility or system 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
25 
utilizing the BC3 system software. See Ground Battle Management Systems RAP Tasking 
messages 
for 
current 
list 
of 
acceptable 
“like-systems” 
(https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/10680/Test/Forms/AllItems.aspx). 
5.1.7.1.  With DRU CC’s approval, WD and ABM evaluations may be conducted on the 
Tinker AFB CSB or other unit employing a BC3 system. (e.g., 81 ACS, 8 WPS) Approval 
will be documented on the member’s AF Form 8 in the Additional Comments section of 
the AF Form 8, Section VIII, Comments. 
5.1.8.  To facilitate implementation of the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) Family of 
Systems (FoS) framework, evaluations may be performed on any of the systems associated 
with TOC-Light/Medium/Fixed (L/M/F) with the approval from the unit CC and concurrence 
of the examiner/examinee. Approval will be documented in the Additional Comments section 
of the AF Form 8, Section VIII, Comments. Reference paragraphs 7.3.4.3.2 through 7.3.4.3.4 
for guidance on MDS usage and providing Form 8 comments on equipment/system utilization. 
5.2.  Evaluation Types.  There are four types of evaluations: QUAL, MSN, INSTR, and SPOT; 
each consisting of two structured phases, ground, and flight. (Exception: SPOT evaluations may 
consist of either a ground or flight phase). Each type except for SPOT evaluations requires the 
completion of requisite tasks. 
5.2.1.  Qualification (QUAL) Evaluations. 
5.2.1.1.  Purpose. QUAL evaluations are to assess a crewmember’s ability to perform the 
basic duties of a particular crew position within the specified MDS and to obtain/maintain 
Basic Qualified (BQ) status in that MDS. The intent of the qualification evaluation is for 
the examinee to demonstrate proficiency with the system (for example, switch actions, 
sensor knowledge, system capabilities) and an ability to effectively employ that system. 
Successful completion of a QUAL evaluation in combination with meeting INIT 
qualification training requirements in accordance with AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 1 leads 
to BQ status and entry into mission qualification training. 
5.2.1.2.  Execution. All crewmembers will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their 
assigned crew position(s), to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFMAN 13-
1MDS Volume 2. (T-2) Qualification evaluations consist of two structured phases, ground 
and positional. The ground phase, when required, is a requisite for a positional evaluation 
usually in the form of a written examination. 
5.2.2.  Mission (MSN) Evaluations. 
5.2.2.1.  Purpose. MSN evaluations are to assess a crewmember’s ability to employ the 
unit’s assigned MDS in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational or DOC statements 
mission(s). The intent of the mission evaluation is for the examinee to demonstrate 
proficiency while employing the system in a live/virtual large force scenario (for example, 
crew coordination, battle management, sensor employment). Successful completion of an 
MSN evaluation leads to CMR or BMC status. 
5.2.2.2.  Execution. The MSN evaluation shall reflect the type and difficulty of tasks 
required in the performance of the MDS operational or director of operations control-
tasked missions. (T-1) All crewmembers will complete an MSN evaluation in accordance 
26 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
with AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2 except as noted for multi-qualified individuals in 
paragraph 5.1.3. (T-1) 
5.2.2.2.1.  The requirement for an MSN evaluation may be waived or combined for 
those crew positions where performance of normal operational, test and training events 
involve tasks covered during the accomplishment of a QUAL evaluation as specified 
in AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2. Document waiver or combined evaluation on the AF 
Form 8. 
5.2.2.2.2.  Units should determine the profile of these evaluations and adhere to the 
appropriate overall grading criteria in this manual. Tactical employment subareas 
should be evaluated and graded according to parameters in AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 
2. 
5.2.3.  Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. 
5.2.3.1.  Purpose. INSTR evaluations are to assess crewmember’s instructional ability in 
their MDS/crew position and to obtain/maintain instructor qualification. Due to the unique 
mission of the 266 RANS and the UTTR, their instructors maintain instructor certifications. 
However, other DRUs (e.g., 81 ACS, 8 WPS, 64 AGRS, etc.) will utilize ACC approved 
ground instructor course syllabi to train new instructors or continue to evaluate previously 
qualified instructors according to this publication and their corresponding AFMAN 13-
1MDS Volume 2. 
5.2.3.2.  Execution. Crewmembers obtaining/regaining instructor qualification must 
complete an evaluation of instructional capability in that weapon system/crew position. 
(T-2) When instructor qualified crewmembers are selected to be upgraded to another duty 
position, their instructor qualification is not automatically transferred to the new duty 
position. These crewmembers must meet requirements in AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 1 
before nomination for instructor upgrade in the new position. (T-3) 
5.2.3.2.1.  For units undergoing conversion, when a complement of current and 
qualified instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit instructor qualification, 
with MAJCOM (ACC/A3CG, USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3ZJ for USAFE-AFAFRICA 
units or PACAF/A3/6CX for PACAF units) coordination the Group/CC (or equivalent) 
may establish an initial cadre (minimum required for initial conversion) of instructors 
who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. See also paragraph 5.11. 
5.2.3.2.2.  Crewmembers selected to become instructors (for the first time in their 
current MDS), following training, must complete an INIT INSTR evaluation. (T-2) 
5.2.3.2.3.  Crewmembers require a single INIT INSTR within a FEF for a given MDS 
(preferably in their primary crew position). An INIT INSTR is not required for each 
crew position that a member is qualified to perform. Multi-qualified instructors will 
receive instructor evaluations in secondary/tertiary crew position. (T-2) Unit letter of 
qualification/certification will designate all crew positions each member is authorized 
to instruct. (T-3) (Note: Units accepting an INSTR qualification transfer detailed in 
paragraph 3.3.3.1 do not require a separate INIT INSTR evaluation). 
5.2.3.2.4.  Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations by instructing an actual student on an 
instructional mission whenever possible. When students are not available, or 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
27 
mission/crew composition requirements prevent inclusion of students, another 
crewmember or the examiner may serve as the student. 
5.2.3.2.5.  INIT INSTR evaluations may be combined with a required periodic 
evaluation if all required positional phase requirements are completed during the 
instructor evaluation and the examinee subsequently completes all ground phase 
requirements for the evaluation within the periods described in paragraph 5.7. Label 
the evaluation appropriately (For example, "INIT INSTR and QUAL/MSN"). Do not 
add on missions to complete the requirements for a prior to eligibility period evaluation 
unless the unit CC concurs with the crewmember’s desire to realign the evaluation 
expiration date and approves the additional requirements (document in accordance with 
paragraph 7.3.4.4.). 
5.2.3.2.6.  Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during subsequent 
QUAL evaluations. (T-1) 
5.2.3.2.6.1.  Instructors whose QUAL evaluations have expired are not qualified to 
instruct and will require a requalification (RQ) INSTR evaluation. (T-2) 
5.2.3.2.6.2.  Instructors who have a current QUAL evaluation, but whose MSN 
evaluation(s) have expired, may instruct QUAL areas only. Instructors will not 
instruct MSN related areas/events/training. (T-2) 
5.2.4.  SPOT Evaluations (Optional). 
5.2.4.1.  Purpose. An optional evaluation of a specific event or requirement without 
intending to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an INIT INSTR 
evaluation. (e.g., evaluating a qualification area to remove a restriction from the current 
AF Form 8). 
5.2.4.2.  Execution. SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements, unless 
specified in MAJCOM supplements but may be no-notice in accordance with paragraph 
5.2.5.4. HHQ appointed examiners can administer SPOT evaluations at any time in any 
MDS. 
5.2.4.2.1.  A SPOT evaluation may be used to update a QUAL/MSN evaluation 
expiration date provided all requirements for the evaluation are completed within the 
periods described in paragraph 5.9 (document on the AF Form 8 in accordance with 
paragraph 7.3.). CCs may authorize additional events in order to assist crewmember’s 
accomplishment of periodic requirements. 
5.2.4.2.2.  Any other event requiring a qualification, or an evaluation not listed in 
paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.3 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation. (T-2) 
5.2.4.3.  Examiner Objectivity SPOT Evaluations. Examiner objectivity SPOT evaluations 
are evaluations used to assess the objectivity, decision making and skill of an examiner in 
administering an evaluation. 
5.2.4.3.1.  Upgrading examiners are required to receive an objectivity SPOT evaluation 
prior to being appointed as a squadron examiner. During ESAP visits, this decision is 
at the discretion of the ESAP visit team lead examiner. Examiners whose primary duty 
position changes will not be required to accomplish another objectivity evaluation. 
Group or unit supplements will specify any additional requirements. (T-2) 
28 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
5.2.4.3.1.1.  Use SPOT as the type of evaluation under the Flight Phase section of 
AF Form 8, then explain in the mission description that the evaluation was an 
examiner objectivity evaluation. The qualification level for the examiner 
objectivity evaluation will be either qualified (Q-1 or Q-2) or unqualified (Q-3). 
Base the overall rating for an examiner objectivity evaluation on the evaluation 
criteria defined in Attachment 5. 
5.2.4.3.1.2.  Observations, analysis, and other substantial actions are directed 
primarily at the examiner conducting the evaluation and will not interfere with or 
affect the individual on position except for flight safety issues. 
5.2.4.3.1.3.  An examiner objectivity SPOT evaluation does not fulfill the 
requirements of a qualification evaluation. 
5.2.4.3.2.  A qualified rating (Q-1) indicates the examinee complied with HHQ and 
local Stan/Eval directives, properly briefed and debriefed the examinee, correctly 
identified discrepancies, awarded the correct grade for each evaluated area, awarded 
the appropriate overall grade, properly documented the evaluation and if required, 
assigned appropriate additional training. 
5.2.4.3.3.  MAJCOM/NAF examiners maintaining a CMR or BMC qualification in any 
MDS may perform an objectivity evaluation on any examiner. 
5.2.4.3.4.  Unit chief of Stan/Eval (or other unit examiner) may perform objectivity 
SPOT evaluations in any crew position within their MDS. 
5.2.4.3.5.  Examiner SPOT objectivity evaluations will be documented on an AF Form 
8 and placed in the member’s FEF. (T-1) 
5.2.5.  Prefixes. 
5.2.5.1.  The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe the 
evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 - 5.2.3. 
5.2.5.2.  Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor 
qualification in a MDS (e.g., INIT QUAL, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR, INIT QUAL/MSN 
(BCC)). 
5.2.5.2.1.  A “INIT QUAL” evaluation must be completed by the end of the third month 
following the release from IQT. If a crewmember exceeds the allotted time for 
completion, the SQ/CC reviews the situation and directs appropriate action. Document 
the circumstances with a memorandum for the record to be included in the AF Form 8 
(see paragraph 7.3.11.3.6.5.). 
5.2.5.2.2.  Individuals who fail their evaluation are returned to DOT in accordance with 
AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 1, MDS Training, to complete additional training. 
5.2.5.2.3.  There is no prefix of an evaluation following a failed INIT evaluation since 
no qualification/mission evaluation was achieved. 
5.2.5.2.4.  A “INIT MSN” evaluation that incorporates the QUAL evaluation areas can 
be considered a combined evaluation regardless of the eligibility period window. (T-3) 
5.2.5.3.  Requalification (RQ). 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
29 
5.2.5.3.1.  An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of qualification due to: 
5.2.5.3.1.1.  Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The requalification 
evaluation will be in accordance with the guidance for that periodic evaluation. 
(T-2) 
5.2.5.3.1.1.1.  Qualification transfers where the instructor qualification is not 
retained by gaining unit. (Example: Instructor ABM on E-3 transferring to 64 
AGRS where Sq/CC chooses to retain QUAL only due to unique mission 
requirements. To become instructor qualified again, member will accomplish a 
RQ INSTR evaluation). 
5.2.5.3.1.2.  Failed periodic evaluation or a CC-directed downgrade. The 
requalification will be in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5.8.2. (T-2) 
5.2.5.3.1.3.  Failed instructor qualification evaluation (N/A for INIT INSTR 
failure). If an instructor passes the MSN or QUAL portion of the evaluation, but 
fails the instructor portion of the evaluation, the subsequent evaluation to regain 
instructor qualification will be a RQ INSTR. (T-2) 
5.2.5.3.2.  The RQ prefix does not apply under the following circumstances: 
5.2.5.3.2.1.  If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to 
complete one or more of the requisites and the Group/CC (or equivalent) 
determines that the qualification will be re-established by completion of the 
requisites without re-accomplishment of the evaluation. (T-3) 
5.2.5.3.2.2.  Following a failed INIT evaluation. 
5.2.5.4.  No-notice (N/N). 
5.2.5.4.1.  The N/N evaluation program provides CCs a sampling of daily operations 
performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness. 
5.2.5.4.2.  An N/N evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the evaluation 
at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The beginning of normal 
preparation for a mission will be defined in supplements to this manual or local 
operating instructions. (T-2) The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for the 
mission. 
5.2.5.4.3.  An examinee, with unit CC concurrence, may utilize a N/N evaluation to 
update a QUAL/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the 
evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.7. If all 
requirements were not completed on the first simulation or flight phase event, 
subsequent simulation or flight phase events are authorized to complete all required 
areas. 
5.2.5.4.3.1.  If the examinee chooses to utilize a N/N SPOT to update their 
QUAL/MSN, document the evaluation as a N/N QUAL/MSN. 
5.2.5.4.3.2.  If the examinee elects not to update a QUAL/MSN evaluation 
expiration date, the evaluation will be documented as a N/N SPOT evaluation. 
(T-2) 
30 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
5.2.5.5.  Simulated (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase is conducted during a 
virtual/constructive mission scenario as defined in AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2. 
5.2.5.6.  Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation 
(e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined 
evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the 
evaluation) will be explained under Mission Description in the Examiner’s Remarks on the 
AF Form 8 in accordance with paragraph 7.3.6.1.2. (T-2) 
5.2.6.  Combined Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient use of operational resources, 
accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practicable. If combined, include the 
designation of each evaluation in the Flight Phase section of the AF Form 8 (for example, 
QUAL/MSN). 
5.2.7.  Cross-Command Evaluations. To provide flexibility to units having trouble in 
performing evaluations due to deployments, examiner availability, or other unique concerns, 
evaluations may be conducted across MAJCOMs. The requesting unit must justify the need 
and explain the reasons to go outside their parent MAJCOM. (T-3) ACC and CONUS ANG 
units (to include 141 ACS) are not required to submit a cross-command evaluation request as 
they are considered part of ACC. Process cross-command evaluation requests as follows: 
5.2.7.1.  Units identifying a need for a cross-command evaluation must coordinate through 
their chain of command to their MAJCOM OPR. (T-2) 
5.2.7.2.  Requests must come from CCs of the affected unit through the command chain up 
to the requesting unit’s MAJCOM OPR. (T-2) 
5.2.7.3.  The requesting unit’s MAJCOM OPR coordinates approval of the evaluation with 
the requested MAJCOM OPR and forwards the approval through channels to the 
requesting unit. 
5.2.7.4.  Cross-command evaluation requests may be sent via email or memorandum and 
include the following: 
5.2.7.4.1.  Reference and text of the specific requirement for which the commander is 
requesting an evaluation. 
5.2.7.4.2.  Rationale. 
5.2.7.4.2.1.  Explain why the evaluation cannot be accomplished within the unit’s 
command. 
5.2.7.4.2.2.  Unit cannot comply with the requirement due to a lack of resources 
(for example trainers, evaluators, equipment, or evaluation scenarios). 
5.2.7.4.3.  Recommended unit to conduct the evaluation and any pre-coordination 
between units. 
5.2.7.4.4.  Impact if request is disapproved. 
5.2.7.4.5.  Approved requests will be filed within the individual’s FEF and 
incorporated on the AF Form 8. 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024

5.3.  Grading and Qualification Level.  Individual grades are assigned to each grading area and 
subarea. The aircrew evaluation qualification level is based upon the requisite results and the 
aircrew evaluation area and subarea grades. 
5.3.1.  A grade is a characterization of examinee performance in a grading area or subarea. 
5.3.2.  Grading areas/subareas are specifically evaluated abilities or skill sets within an 
evaluation. Grading areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading 
system in accordance with AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2. Document discrepancies against the 
established areas/subareas. 
5.3.2.1.  “Q” indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the area/subarea tasks. The 
examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of all required information and 
performed crew duties within the prescribed AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2 tolerances. 
5.3.2.2.  “Q-” indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea 
tasks. The examinee demonstrated limited knowledge and/or marginal performance within 
the prescribed AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2 Q- tolerances. Q- must not jeopardize safety 
as outlined in the category. Q- requires debriefing and/or additional training as determined 
by the examiner. 
5.3.2.3.  “U” indicates the examinee is not qualified to perform the area/subarea tasks. “U” 
indicates that performance was outside allowable AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2 Q and Q- 
tolerances; 
thereby 
compromising 
safety 
with 
deviations 
from 
prescribed 
procedures/tolerances that adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated 
performance constituted a breach of discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea 
grade of “U” requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the examiner. 
5.3.2.4.  Remedial Action. All grades of “Q-” or “U” require remedial action that includes 
either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training. 
5.3.2.4.1.  Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the 
evaluation wherein the examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the 
discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or 
proficiency to remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area description is annotated 
with “Debriefed” in paragraph B “Discrepancies” of the Examiner’s Remarks section 
of the AF Form 8, Section VIII, Comments. 
5.3.2.4.2.  Additional Training. Training recommended by an examiner to remedy 
deficiencies identified during an evaluation that a debrief cannot adequately cover. 
5.3.2.4.2.1.  Units will follow procedures outlined in AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 
1 and Group or unit supplements to ensure additional training is accomplished. 
(T-3) 
5.3.2.4.2.2.  If a crewmember exceeds the allotted time for completion of additional 
training, the Sq/CC reviews the situation and directs appropriate action. Document 
the circumstances with a memorandum for the record to be included in the AF Form 
8 (see paragraph 7.3.11.3.6.5.). 
5.3.2.4.2.3.  Once additional training is complete, it is documented in Section V of 
the AF Form 8. Outline additional training requirements in paragraph C, 
Recommended Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks in the AF Form 8,

Section VIII, Comments section. 
5.3.2.4.2.4.  The instructor who completed the additional training (or final event if 
more than one instructor is used) notifies the COT, or NCOIC if COT is 
unavailable, the training is complete. The COT, or NCOIC if COT is unavailable, 
will then sign as the Certifying Official in Section V of the AF Form 8 verifying 
completion of all assigned training outlined in paragraph C, Recommended 
Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks of the AF Form 8. (T-2) 
5.3.2.5.  The examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the general and 
specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2. (T-1) Any 
additional areas/subareas observed during an evaluation will be graded in accordance with 
AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2. 
5.3.2.6.  Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are acceptable, 
provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not 
jeopardize safety or mission accomplishment. Consider cumulative deviations when 
determining the overall area/subarea grade. 
5.3.2.7.  The examiner may further identify an area/sub-area as “commendable” if, in the 
examiner’s determination, the crewmember has demonstrated exceptional skill and 
knowledge in that area/sub-area. Document commendable areas in the Additional 
Comments section of the AF Form 8, Section VIII, Comments. 
5.3.3.  Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned to the crew evaluation. The 
aircrew evaluation qualification level is based on the compilation of the requisite results as 
well as the aircrew evaluation grading areas and subareas. 
5.3.3.1.  Base the qualification levels performance standards on the following: 
5.3.3.1.1.  Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The crewmember demonstrated desired 
performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment, and directives within tolerances 
specified in the grading criteria. Examiner will award a Q-1 when no discrepancies 
were noted. (T-3) Examiner may award Q-1 when discrepancies are noted if: 
5.3.3.1.1.1.  No “U” grades being given in any areas/subareas. 
5.3.3.1.1.2.  In the judgment of the examiner, none of the Q- grades precludes 
awarding of an overall “Q-1.” 
5.3.3.1.1.3.  No remedial actions required additional training, only debriefed 
discrepancies. 
5.3.3.1.2.  Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The crewmember demonstrated the ability to 
perform duties safely, however: there were one or more grading areas/subareas where 
additional training was assigned. The examiner will assign this qualification level if: 
5.3.3.1.2.1.  A non-critical area/subarea grade of “U” was awarded. 
5.3.3.1.2.2.  In the judgment of the examiner, is justification based on Q- 
performance in one or several grading areas/subareas. 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
33 
5.3.3.1.3.  Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The crewmember demonstrated an 
unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge. The examiner will assign this 
qualification level if: 
5.3.3.1.3.1.  An area grade of “U” awarded in a critical area requires an overall “Q-
3”for the evaluation. 
5.3.3.1.3.2.  An overall judgment of the examiner, there is justification based on Q-
/U performance in one or several non-critical grading areas/subareas. 
5.3.3.2.  Assigning the overall qualification level. 
5.3.3.2.1.  The examiner completing the evaluation is responsible for assigning the 
overall qualification level. 
5.3.3.2.2.  A qualification level of “Q-1” or “Q-2” will be given only after all evaluation 
requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due 
consideration. 
5.3.3.2.3.  A qualification level of “Q-3” may be awarded at any time. 
5.3.3.2.4.  Examiner judgment will always be the determining factor in deciding the 
evaluation qualification level. 
5.3.3.2.5.  AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2 dictate the highest grade for the aircrew 
evaluation based on grading area and subarea performance. However, the examiner can 
be more restrictive, but not less restrictive than the AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2 
qualification level guidance. 
5.3.3.3.  Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. The examiner may award an EQ only 
to the total evaluation not to separate requisites. Award the designation when the 
crewmember has achieved both of the following criteria: 
5.3.3.3.1.  Received a Q in all grading areas of the evaluation and demonstrated 
exceptional skill and knowledge in all phases of the evaluation. 
5.3.3.3.2.  Achieved a score of 96% or greater on all written examinations. 
5.4.  Evaluation Criteria.  ACC/A3C, in coordination with applicable user MAJCOMs, will 
establish and maintain standardized MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the 
appropriate AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2. ACC/A3C is also responsible for coordinating the 
establishment of grading areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those 
areas required for evaluation completion. 
5.5.  Requisites.  Unless a variation is authorized by the Sq/CC, examinees will complete INIT 
qualification academic testing prior to any positional portion of the evaluation. (T-2) For 
requalification and periodic evaluations, complete the written examination in accordance with the 
unit supplement but within their examinee’s eligibility period. The requisites for each evaluation 
include: 
5.5.1.  QUAL Examination. The general knowledge written test for a QUAL evaluation. 
5.5.2.  MSN Examination. (Optional). The crew position written test for an MSN evaluation 
as defined in the unit’s MSN evaluation profile. (Note: Not applicable for DRUs). 
34 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
5.5.3.  QUAL/MSN Examination. The general knowledge crew position written test for a 
combined QUAL/MSN evaluation. Separate QUAL and MSN examinations are not required. 
5.6.  Aircrew Evaluation.  The aircrew evaluation includes live/virtual/constructive environment 
event execution in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator profile that will allow evaluation 
of individual performance. 
5.6.1.  The profile used to fulfill the aircrew evaluation must incorporate all appropriate 
requirements set in the applicable AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2 and allow an accurate measure 
of the proficiency of the examinee. 
5.6.2.  Evaluation profiles should be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily 
training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission. Review 
evaluation profiles annually and document on the front page of the evaluation profile. 
Examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas on-position during the selected 
mission event. (T-3) When necessary, examiners may supplement (not substitute) some aspects 
of an evaluation area with verbal evaluation. 
5.7.  Requisite Completion.  For all evaluations, accomplish requisites as follows: 
5.7.1.  In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or N/N periodic evaluations in the eligibility 
period, examinees must complete all requisites within the six-month eligibility period of the 
current evaluation. The Group/CC (or equivalent) may waive this requirement on a case-by-
case basis (document on the AF Form 8 in accordance with paragraph 7.3.4.4.). 
5.7.2.  Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility period, 
examinees must complete all requisites within a six-month period beginning with the month in 
which the aircrew evaluation was administered. (T-2) (Exception: For extended evaluations, 
requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month eligibility period and the 
extended expiration date.) 
5.7.3.  One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined evaluations 
as defined in AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 2. 
5.7.4.  Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations 
provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each evaluation. 
5.8.  Crewmember Evaluation Failure. 
5.8.1.  A downgrade resulting from a “Q-3” in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to that 
specific crew position in a particular MDS for which the evaluation was administered, unless, 
in the opinion of the examiner, the discrepancy is applicable to additional crew positions. 
Crewmember must be placed on supervised status, with supervision by instructors or 
designated supervisors qualified in the specific crew mission (as specified in AFMAN 13-
1MDS Volume 1) if the crewmember receives unsatisfactory performance or is placed on 
restriction. (T-2) 
5.8.1.1.  The examiner that administered the original evaluation should not administer the 
requalification evaluation. 
5.8.1.2.  The examiner may annotate that the requalification evaluation be accomplished 
verbally or in a simulator (document in accordance with paragraph 7.3.11.3.).

5.8.1.3.  Requisites remain valid that were successfully passed within the 6-month period 
as described by paragraph 5.7.1 or 5.7.2 for a failed aircrew evaluation. 
5.8.2.  Status Downgrade. Crewmembers receiving a grade of Q-3 on an evaluation shall be 
downgraded as follows: 
5.8.2.1.  Q-3 QUAL. Downgrade crewmember to UQ (N/A for INIT QUAL as the 
crewmember has not obtained BQ status). 
5.8.2.2.  Q-3 MSN. Downgrade crewmember to BQ (N/A for INIT MSN as the 
crewmember has not obtained CMR or BMC status). 
5.8.2.3.  For combined evaluations that result in different grades for the QUAL and MSN, 
downgrade the crewmember to UQ for an overall grade of Q-3 on the QUAL and 
downgrade to BQ for an overall grade of Q-3 on the MSN (for areas unique to MSN 
evaluation). 
5.8.3.  Restrictions. When called for by this manual or deemed necessary in the judgment of 
the examiner, restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until successful completion of 
assigned additional training and a requalification evaluation. (T-1) 
5.8.3.1.  Restrictions will address the specific phase (for example, live control) and/or 
operations that require supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions. (T-2) 
Restrictions directed through an evaluation that awarded a grade of Q-1 or Q-2 – “No 
additional training required” will be removed through a subsequent or SPOT evaluation 
unless otherwise specified within the AFMAN 13-1MDS Volumes 1 or 2. (T-2) 
5.8.3.1.1.  QUAL Evaluation. Place the examinee on supervised status in the crew 
position in which the evaluation was administered unless the discrepancy is applicable 
to additional crew positions for multiple qualified crewmembers (where the 
crewmember will also be on supervised status). 
5.8.3.1.2.  MSN Evaluation (N/A for DRUs). The examinee may perform basic 
qualification tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on supervised 
status for mission tasks. 
5.8.3.1.3.  INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are 
being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor area(s) 
will not perform instructor duties until a successful instructor RQ is completed. (T-1)

Form 8 in accordance with paragraph 7.3.9. Restrictions associated with failed requisite 
examinations are not documented on the AF Form 8. 
5.9.  Timing of Qualification Evaluations. 
5.9.1.  Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th month 
following the month in which the previous periodic crewmember evaluation (and any 
additional training) was successfully completed. (e.g., a periodic evaluation in which the 
aircrew evaluation was completed on 9 Oct 24 expires on 31 Mar 26.). 
5.9.2.  Eligibility Period. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period, defined as the 
six-month period prior to the expiration date.

area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. 
5.10.4.  A CC may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g., instructor) or 
completely unqualifies an individual. 
5.10.5.  Downgrades may be directed without administering an evaluation using the following 
guidance: 
38 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
5.10.5.1.  Examples of positional-related cases include breach of crew discipline, safety, 
etc. Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner but may be recommended 
by an examiner from any MDS/crew position.

other administrative, disciplinary, punitive or Uniform Code of Military Justice actions (for 
example, Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.) (Note: Consult with the supporting Staff 
Judge Advocate office for legal advice in these cases). 
5.10.5.3.  Use in cases where such incidences directly affect the CC’s lack of confidence 
in the crewmember’s ability to safely operate the equipment (for example, lapse in 
judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the crewmember’s decision-making 
abilities). 
5.10.6.  For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an 
individual, the affected crewmember will cease performing in the qualification(s) from which 
they have been downgraded effective the date the CC initiated the downgrade. (T-3)

Chapter 6 
WRITTEN EXAMINATION PROGRAM 
6.1.  Purpose.  The written examination program measures crewmember knowledge of normal 
procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective operation of their 
assigned MDS through the administration of written or computer-based examinations. 
6.2.  Scope.  This chapter applies to ABMs (13BXX), command and control battle management 
operators (1C5/1C5D), and applicable Canadian equivalent command and control operations 
personnel when assigned. Examinations in this chapter include requisite examinations for periodic 
evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include the MQF examination 
as described in paragraph 6.4.1. The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by 
the management of examination content and use of appropriate MQFs. 
6.2.1.  For INIT evaluations, crewmembers will accomplish requisite examinations prior to the 
flight phase unless authorized by the Sq/CC. 
6.2.2.  For RQ and periodic evaluations, the written examinations will be completed at the 
discretion of the Chief f Stan/Eval, but within their eligibility period. (T-2) 
6.3.  Administrative Procedures. 
6.3.1.  Documentation. Units will outline the unit examination process in the unit supplement. 
(T-3) 
6.3.2.  Computer Based Examinations. PEX or other MAJCOM-approved testing program 
may be used to fulfill the requirement for exams. 
6.3.3.  Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded examination answer sheets/computer 
records until the AF Form 8 is completed. When unable to use PEX for examinations, the 
Stan/Eval section will retain graded exam answer sheets/computer records for one year for 
trend analysis purposes. (T-2) 
6.4.  Examination Sources. 
6.4.1.  MDS-Specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOM will ensure MDS-specific MQFs are available 
for MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable crew duty positions. Units will make the 
question file and sources accessible to all operational personnel. (T-2) 
6.4.1.1.  The major emphasis of the MQF will be on the specific weapon system, applicable 
AFIs/AFMANs, and operational procedures as applicable to each crew position. The 
questions are derived from operational publications and MAJCOM training materials. 
6.4.1.2.  The unit Chief of Stan/Eval is authorized to make corrections, change spelling, or 
correct erroneous or invalid questions resulting from recent changes to systems and/or 
operational procedures, however, subject matter may not be changed. 
6.4.1.2.1.  The unit Chief of Stan/Eval must submit these corrections and any new 
questions resulting from revisions/changes to directives through Stan/Eval channels to 
the appropriate MAJCOM office of primary responsibility. (T-2) 
6.4.1.2.2.  The unit Chief of Stan/Eval will maintain a file copy of all recommendations 
until the next update is accomplished. (T-2) 
40 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
6.4.2.  Local Procedures MQF (LPMQF). LPMQFs are used to supplement the MAJCOM 
MQF. Units may include information necessary for safe operation and mission 
accomplishment specific to their unit and not included in the MAJCOM MQF. 
6.5.  Examination Management.  Units will either maintain requisite examinations for each crew 
position or generate a unique test for each crewmember requiring an exam. (T-2) 
6.5.1.  Examination Question Review. The NAF, Group, and CCV functions will review all 
MQFs and generated exams (if used) annually and as soon as possible after any changes in 
source documents. (T-2) If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document 
change, it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will follow the procedures for exam 
reviews in the Group (or equivalent) or unit supplement and report the review in the Stan/Eval 
board minutes. (T-2) 
6.5.2.  Master question files and requisite examinations maintained and generated in PEX or 
other MAJCOM-approved testing program do not require two tests to be maintained as PEX 
is capable of generating unique tests per crew position. 
6.5.3.  If prepared examinations are maintained for each crew position: 
6.5.3.1.  CCV will develop and control a minimum of two examinations for each crew 
position. (T-3) Exception: Units having crew positions in which there are ten or fewer 
crewmembers require only one examination for those positions. 
6.5.3.2.  When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are 
not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position. 
6.5.3.3.  CCV will change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared 
examination each calendar year. (T-3) 
6.5.3.4.  CCV should ensure that no more than 50 percent of the questions are duplicated 
between tests. 
6.5.3.5.  CCV should ensure the question database is clearly labeled with a “Current as of” 
date. 
6.5.3.6.  CCV should conduct an annual review and approval of the MQF to ensure 
questions are updated in accordance with the latest guidance. 
6.5.4.  QUAL Examination. The written test for a QUAL evaluation will consist of 85 
questions from the MAJCOM MQF and 15 questions from the LPMQF. 
6.5.5.  QUAL/MSN Examination. Crew position written test for a combined QUAL/MSN 
evaluation will consist of 85 questions from the MAJCOM MQF and 15 questions from the 
LPMQF. If the unit chooses to require an MSN requisite exam in addition to the QUAL 
requisite exam the test will consist of 70 questions from the MAJCOM MQF, 15 questions 
from the LPMQF and 15 questions from the unit MSN MQF. 
6.5.5.1.  BCC. The crew written test for a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation will consist 
of 70 questions from the MAJCOM MQF, 15 questions from the unit MSN MQF, and 15 
questions from the LPMQF. (T-3) 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
41 
6.6.  Examination Security.  The Stan/Eval section maintains positive control of all requisite 
exams, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media. To prevent 
compromise when not in use, secure examinations and answer keys in a locked container. 
6.6.1.  The overall classification of the MQF is determined by the highest classification of its 
contents. 
6.6.2.  The CCV should mark tests appropriately and protect in accordance with security 
directives. Whether they contain classified questions or not, handle the tests as controlled 
items. 
6.7.  Grading.  The minimum passing grade for all requisite examinations is 85 percent. All 
questions missed should be reviewed immediately following the exam. Stan Eval NCOIC or 
assigned member will grade examinations prior to examinee performing operational duties. (T-3) 
6.8.  Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.  An evaluation will not be complete until the examination 
is successfully accomplished. Chief of Stan/Eval will place crewmembers who fail a requisite 
examination in a supervised status until successful completion of retesting. (T-1) When an 
individual fails a requisite examination, CCV must notify, in writing, the unit CC, DO, and Chief 
of Training. (T-3) 
6.8.1.  Crewmembers who fail a requisite examination must successfully complete the 
examination before the end of their eligibility period or the crewmember loses the qualification 
covered by the evaluation. (T-1) 
6.8.2.  Crewmembers who fail a requisite examination must be afforded an adequate study 
period (at least 24 hours) prior to reexamination. (T-3) An alternate exam will be used. (T-3) 
Failure of the reexamination will result in a downgrade to “UQ” status or retention in training 
status for INIT examination. The AF Form 8 is used to document the second failure as an MSN 
“Q3”. 
6.8.3.  For crewmembers who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status resulting 
from failure of the examination applies to all crew position(s) for which the examination is a 
requisite. 
6.9.  Periodic Examinations.  Each OGV/CCV function may conduct periodic testing of all 
crews. The intent is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such 
as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, 
etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit. Most of the questions must come 
from sources other than the MAJCOM-approved MQF. (T-3) 
6.9.1.  This exam may be open or closed book, but will not count as a requisite exam, nor will 
a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam. 
6.9.2.  If utilized, units should describe this program in the unit supplement to include 
procedures for failed exams.

Chapter 7 
DOCUMENTATION 
7.1.  Scope.  Administration of the crewmember evaluation program requires accurate 
documentation. This chapter provides documentation guidance for crewmembers that require an 
evaluation to establish a qualification. 
7.1.1.  The results of evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8. The chronological history of 
evaluations for a crewmember is recorded on an AF Form 942. These forms are maintained in 
the FEF. 
7.1.2.  In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is encouraged and authorized, 
to include use of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs. Computer-generated forms 
must mirror AF Forms published on the Air Force e-publishing website in accordance with 
DAFI 90-160. 
7.2.  Qualifications versus Certifications.  Qualifications are attained through evaluations are 
documented on the AF Form 8. Certifications attained through methods other than evaluation are 
documented in accordance with AFMAN 13-1MDS Volume 1. 
7.3.  Air Force (AF) Form 8. 
7.3.1.  Purpose. The AF Form 8 is the source document used to record and verify the 
qualification of a crewmember. 
7.3.1.1.  Use the AF Form 8 to record crewmember’s maintaining qualification in a single 
MDS. 
7.3.1.2.  The AF Form 8 is accomplished by the examiner, Reviewing Officer, Final 
Approving Officer, the Examinee, and a Certifying Official (if additional training was 
required). 
7.3.2.  General Data Entry. 
7.3.2.1.  For all data entry into an electronic form, units will use the electronic form’s 
format. 
7.3.2.1.1.  For example, an “X” can be replaced with a “√” or other form standard, as 
long as such preference is standardized throughout the document. 
7.3.2.1.2.  For date fields either the two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year 
format (for example, 09 Aug 20) or four-digit year format (15 Mar 2020) is authorized. 
7.3.2.2.  The “Eligibility Period” and “Expiration Date of Qualification” should use a three-
letter month and two-digit year format (Aug 20). If the eligibility period spans over a 
calendar year, then both years are indicated (for example, Dec 19 – May 20). 
7.3.2.3.  Except where specifically noted otherwise (that is, annotating the type of 
evaluation “INSTR”), use upper- and lower-case letters. 
7.3.2.4.  Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left, or centered) of 
data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as 
desired. 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
43 
7.3.2.5.  Units may use the standard format established by the PEX Stan/Eval module AF 
Form 8. Electronically signed AF Forms 8 are authorized. 
7.3.2.6.  Units without access to the PEX Stan/Eval module AF Form 8 will use the e- 
Publishing AF Form 8 with electronic signature ability and route the AF Form 8 through 
encrypted emails for electronic signatures. (T-2) 
7.3.3.  Date Completed. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or 
flight phase) and the additional training if assigned. 
7.3.4.  Examinee Identification (Section I). 
7.3.4.1.  Name, Grade (“CIV” for Government Civilians or “CTR” for Contractors) and 
the Department of Defense Identification Number (DoD ID) or Non-US Identity Code 
(NUSIC). Note: Automated systems may default to the examinee’s Rank rather than Grade 
(e.g., Capt versus O-3). Either is acceptable so long as it’s consistent across unit FEFs. 
Additionally, systems such as PEX may automatically add characters to the DoD ID 
number (e.g., 157004), and do not require entries in the minor discrepancy log. 
7.3.4.2.  Organization and Location. 
7.3.4.2.1.  Enter unit designation/office symbol and location where the examinee is 
assigned or attached. 
7.3.4.2.2.  For FTU courses in which an evaluation is administered, the organization 
and location will reflect the FTU organization/location. 
7.3.4.3.  MDS/Crew Position. Enter the MDS in which the evaluation was given by using 
MDS designators. 
7.3.4.3.1.  Enter the examinee's “qualified” duty position for the evaluation in that 
MDS. For INIT INSTR and/or periodic QUAL/MSN involving an instructor, the crew 
position will be prefaced with an “I”. (T-2) In cases where confusion may exist a 
hyphen may be inserted (e.g., an Interface Control Technician (ICT) Instructor would 
be I-ICT). Also, examiner is not a qualification, it is a certification, and should only be 
entered when the examiner is receiving a SPOT examiner objectivity evaluation. (Note: 
Section Lead and Electronic Protection Technician are certifications not 
qualifications.) 
7.3.4.3.2.  Direct Reporting Unit MDS. DRUs will enter “DRU” as their MDS in 
Section I of the AF Form 8 (e.g., an instructor Weapons Director at the 8 WPS or 81 
ACS will use “DRU/IWD”). 
7.3.4.3.3.  Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) MDS. Utilize “BMC2” 
in the MDS section for crew members assigned to units performing ground battle 
management command and control missions on similar control equipment to that of the 
BCC/CRC/DRU but do not hold that official designation. (Note: “BMC2” is not an 
actual MDS but serves as an AF Form 8 placeholder for circumstances where 
BCC/CRC/DRU either do not apply or units are transitioning to a new designation. The 
AF Form 8 remarks will detail system specifics described in paragraph 7.3.4.3.4.) 
7.3.4.3.3.1.  BMC2 Example. The 728th Battle Management Control Squadron 
(728 BMCS) at Robins AFB will use “BMC2” during their transition to a BCC. 
44 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
Once the unit transition is complete, and BCC AFMAN volumes apply, they may 
utilize BCC as their new MDS. 
7.3.4.3.4.  Details regarding the specific system or equipment utilized while performing 
the evaluation will be documented in Section VIII, paragraph “A. Mission 
Description”. (e.g., an AF Form 8 from a Nellis AFB DRU might read “Equipment 
consisted of the BC3 system at the Range Operations Center (ROC) utilizing remote 
radios, sensors, and datalink equipment on the Nevada Test and Training Range 
(NTTR)). 
7.3.4.3.5.  Units will document each evaluation for crewmembers holding multiple 
qualifications on a separate AF Form 8. (T-1) 
7.3.4.4.  Eligibility Period. 
7.3.4.4.1.  Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last periodic 
qualification evaluation of the same category (for example, if the last MSN evaluation 
expires Sep 20, enter Apr-Sep 20). 
7.3.4.4.2.  Enter N/A (N/A) for INIT, SPOT, RQ, and out-of-the-eligibility period 
evaluations. 
7.3.4.4.3.  For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the previous 
evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.9.3.2, enter the 6-month 
period preceding the original expiration date (extensions only extend the expiration 
date, not the eligibility period). 
7.3.4.4.4.  Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if last 
QUAL evaluation expires Nov 19 and MSN evaluation expires Jan 20, enter “QUAL: 
Jun-Nov 19/MSN: Aug 19-Jan 20” for a QUAL/MSN evaluation). 
7.3.5.  Requisite Information (Section II). 
7.3.5.1.  Requisites. 
7.3.5.1.1.  Make a separate entry for each requisite. Note discrepancies in the 
Examiner’s Remarks. 
7.3.5.1.2.  If requisites exceed available lines, make combined entries or document 
additional requisite completion in the Comments section. 
7.3.5.1.3.  Annotate "Closed Book" for requisite examinations. 
7.3.5.2.  Date. Enter the date the requisite is successfully completed. 
7.3.5.3.  Results. Enter failed examination score with successfully completed score as 
follows: 84/98. 
7.3.6.  Aircrew Evaluation Information (Section III). 
7.3.6.1.  Aircrew Evaluation. 
7.3.6.1.1.  Use the following designations to describe the type of evaluation(s): QUAL, 
MSN, INSTR, and SPOT. If combined, include the designation of each evaluation 
(QUAL/MSN, etc.). 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
45 
7.3.6.1.2.  Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of 
evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and SIM. More than one prefix may be used to describe an 
evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.5.6. 
7.3.6.1.2.1.  The only annotations of INSTR are INIT INSTR and RQ INSTR as 
described in paragraph 5.2.3.2.5 and paragraph 5.2.3.2.6.1. 
7.3.6.1.2.2.  INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form 8 crew 
position is already annotated with the instructor designation (e.g., Instructor Air 
Surveillance Technician (IAST)). (T-3) 
7.3.6.1.2.3.  When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of instructor 
qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT). 
7.3.6.1.3.  Make a single line entry to document the event(s) used to complete the 
evaluation. 
7.3.6.1.4.  Make multiple single line entries for each event if two or more events are 
required and administered either by different examiners or on separate days. 
7.3.6.1.5.  Where a single mission consists of multiple events over one or more days 
with the same examiners, a single line entry may be used. 
7.3.6.2.  Date. 
7.3.6.2.1.  Enter the date the mission/event was completed. 
7.3.6.2.2.  For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple events over one 
or more days (see paragraph 7.3.6.1.5), use a single line entry with the date the 
mission was completed. Document the mission details and inclusive dates in the 
Examiner’s Remarks in accordance with paragraph 7.3.10.1. 
7.3.6.2.3.  For evaluations conducted on missions spanning more than one day, use a 
single line entry with the date the mission was completed. Document the details in the 
Examiner’s Remarks in accordance with paragraph 7.3.10.1. 
7.3.7.  Qualification Level (Section IV). 
7.3.7.1.  Annotate the examinee’s qualification level in accordance with the definitions of 
paragraph 5.2.4.3.2 by placing a “1” (for Q-1) or “2” (for Q-2) in the qualified block or a 
“3” (for Q-3) in the unqualified block. 
7.3.7.2.  Combined evaluations (for example, QUAL/MSN) require only one qualification 
level if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level. If the overall level varies for 
each type of evaluation accomplished, indicate the qualification level for each part 
separately (for example, “MSN: 1” and “QUAL: 2” in the qualified block or “QUAL: 3” 
in the unqualified block). 
7.3.7.3.  Expiration Date of Qualification. 
7.3.7.3.1.  For evaluations that establish a new eligibility period (that is, QUAL and 
MSN), enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which the flight 
phase of the evaluation was successfully completed. Following an INIT MSN 
evaluation, the QUAL eligibility period is automatically extended to the month and 
year that is 17 months after the month in which the flight phase of the MSN evaluation 
46 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
was successfully completed. The tracking method for this extension period will be 
defined in local supplements and is not required to be reported in semi-annual SEB 
minutes. 
7.3.7.3.2.  For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period enter “N/A.” 
7.3.7.3.3.  Combined evaluations (e.g., QUAL/MSN) require only one date if all parts 
of the evaluation were successfully completed and/or “N/A” if all parts were assigned 
an unqualified grade. 
7.3.7.3.4.  For a combined evaluation where one category is successfully completed 
and/or one category is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by assigning a new 
expiration date for those categories completed successfully, and “N/A” for those 
categories awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and MSN 3, then enter 
“QUAL-Jul 20” under Qualified and “MSN-N/A” under Unqualified). 
7.3.8.  Additional Training (Section V). If additional training is not required, annotate each of 
the blocks described below with “N/A.” 
7.3.8.1.  Due Date(s). 
7.3.8.1.1.  Enter a date not to exceed the last day of the third month following the event 
requiring additional training (a crewmember evaluation on 21 Mar 23 equates to a 30 
June 23 due date). See paragraph 5.3.2.4.2.2 for exceptions. 
7.3.8.1.2.  If more than one date or type of training is required, preface the due dates 
with an appropriate description (Academics, SIM, Positional, etc.). 
7.3.8.2.  Date Additional Training Completed. 
7.3.8.2.1.  Enter the date(s) the examinee completed additional training, otherwise 
enter “N/A”. 
7.3.8.2.2.  If more than one date or type of training is required, preface the due dates 
with an appropriate description (Academics, SIM, Positional, etc.). 
7.3.8.2.3.  If additional training cannot be completed in the allotted time, the examiner 
in conjunction with the unit COT, will request a training extension from the Unit/CC 
and will annotate in the Additional Comments section of the AF Form 8, to include the 
date of the waiver. 
7.3.8.3.  Certifying Official, Grade and Organization. 
7.3.8.3.1.  The instructor who completed the additional training (or final event if more 
than one instructor is used) will notify the COT, or NCOIC if COT is not available, 
who will then sign as the Certifying Official in Section V of the AF Form 8. (T-3) 
7.3.8.3.2.  If additional training is not completed due to the examinee’s withdrawal 
from training (for additional qualifications), enter N/A for Date Additional Training 
Completed, and annotate reason for non-completion of additional training in Additional 
Comments. 
7.3.9.  Other (Section VI). Restrictions/EQ/CC-directed downgrade. Place an “X” or “√” in the 
appropriate block when comments are annotated in Section IV. Do not annotate for restrictions 
resulting from failed requisite examinations. 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
47 
7.3.10.  Endorsement (Section VII). 
7.3.10.1.  Examiner. 
7.3.10.1.1.  The examiner signing the AF Form 8 is responsible for the content and 
should not sign Section VII until verifying all required items (in accordance with this 
manual and AFMAN 13-1MDS V2) are documented. If additional training is 
prescribed, the examiner will not sign the AF Form 8 before the certifying official has 
signed off that additional training has been completed. (T-1) 
7.3.10.1.2.  The examiner signing the AF Form 8 will place an “X” or a “√” in the 
remarks block and make comments on the AF Form 8, Section VIII, Comments block. 
(T-1)

Section VII of the AF Form 8. (T-1) 
7.3.10.1.4.  Any other examiner(s) will enter remarks in the Mission Description block 
on the AF Form 8, Section VIII, describing those parts of the evaluation they evaluated, 
complete the fields, and sign the signature block at the bottom of the second page. (T-1) 
7.3.10.1.5.  Examiner upgrade candidates receiving an objectivity evaluation to 
complete the upgrade process are not current examiners at the time of the objectivity 
evaluation. The qualified examiner administering the objectivity evaluation will sign 
all Stan/Eval documents relating to both the examinee being upgraded and the 
crewmember sitting in the primary position. (T-2) The qualified examiner is 
responsible for all information on the documents. 
7.3.10.1.6.  NAF examiners and unit chief of Stan/Eval are not authorized to change or 
direct a change of rating (area or overall) on an AF Form 8 completed by a unit 
examiner unless a valid administrative error was made. 
7.3.10.2.  Reviewing and Final Approving Officers. 
7.3.10.2.1.  The Reviewing and Final Approving Officers (officers holding these 
positions or acting in their stead during the period of the signature process -- not 
necessarily the date of the evaluation) will review the content of the AF Form 8 and the 
assigned qualification level. (T-2) If the reviewing or final approving officer finds all 
required additional training adequate to correct any notified deficiencies and that all 
such training is complete, the reviewing or final approving officer will place an “X” or 
“√” (in accordance with paragraph 7.3.2.1) in the “Concur” block. (T-2) 
7.3.10.2.1.1.  If either or both officers do not agree with any portion of the AF Form

Notes: 
1. Levels shown are minimum required. 
2. If Unit/CC is the examiner, Reviewing Officer will be the Unit/DO and Final Approving 
Officer will be Group/CC (or equivalent), Unit/CC supervisor, AOC/CC, or NAF chief of 
Stan/Eval. 
3. If the unit/DO is the examiner, the Reviewing Officer will be the unit chief of Stan/Eval and 
Final Approving Officer will be the Unit/CC. 
4. If the unit/DO evaluates the unit chief of Stan/Eval, the reviewing officer will be the 
Unit/CC and Approving Officer will be the Group/CC (or equivalent), Unit/CC supervisor, 
AOC/CC, or NAF chief of Stan/Eval. 
5. If the Unit/CC evaluates the unit/DO (or vice versa) the reviewing officer will be the unit 
chief of Stan/Eval with the Group/CC (or equivalent) (if oversight is provided), Unit/CC 
supervisor, AOC/CC, or NAF chief of Stan/Eval as the approving officer. 
6. If position is vacant, Group Stan/Eval Chief can sign as the Reviewing Officer. 
7. Examinee’s supervisor will be debriefed on results of evaluation and annotated on AF Form 
8 Additional Comments section.  
7.3.10.3.  Organization Block Format. The format and content of data for the Organization 
block for the examiner, reviewing officer, and final approving officer will be as follows: 
7.3.10.3.1.  Examiner. Annotate unit/organization and office symbol of the examiner 
that completed the evaluation (for example, 729th Standardization and Evaluation (729 
ACS/CCV), 1st Air Force Standardization and Evaluation (1AF/A3V), 552d Air 
Control Group Standardization and Evaluation (552 ACG/CCV)). 
7.3.10.3.2.  Reviewing and Final Approving Officer. Annotate unit/organization and 
office symbol accordingly (for example, 606th Air Control Squadron Director of 
Operations (606 ACS/DO), 552d Air Control Group Commander (552 ACG/CC)). 
7.3.10.4.  Annotate the examinee’s Name and Grade. The examinee will sign, date and be 
the last dated signature on the AF Form 8 after the Final Approving Officer, acknowledging 
that he/she has been debriefed and understands the action(s) being taken, if any. (T-2) 
7.3.11.  Comments (Section VIII). 
7.3.11.1.  Restrictions (if required). 
7.3.11.1.1.  Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will 
be documented as the first item of Section VIII. 
7.3.11.1.2.  Document each restriction by annotating the specific restriction, level of 
supervision required, and criteria for removal of the restriction. 
7.3.11.1.3.  BCC.  Retention of instructor qualifications. Members who upgrade to a 
new crew position but maintain their instructor qualification in the previous or 
secondary qualified position, will clarify what positions they can instruct either via AF 
Form 8 restrictions or the unit letter of qualification/certification. For example, a 
member receiving an INIT QUAL evaluation as a Senior Director (SD), who was 
previously an Instructor Air Weapons Officer (IAWO), will record their crew position 
as “ISD”. One method of documenting the restriction on an AF Form 8 is 
“RESTRICTION: Examinee may only instruct Air Weapons Officer/Weapons Director 
50 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
crewmembers.” To lift this restriction, instructor areas must be evaluated to the new 
crew position (SD) either by SPOT evaluation or assessed on subsequent recurring 
evaluations. Alternatively, the restriction may specify “RESTRICTION: Examinee 
may 
only 
instruct 
crew 
positions 
annotated 
on 
the 
unit 
letter 
of 
qualification/certification.” This requires the restriction to be tracked by the unit letter 
of qualification/certification but can more easily be lifted as required. (T-2) 
7.3.11.2.  EQ Designation (when used). Enter designation in all capital letters. Document 
justification (for example, areas of excellence) before Examiner’s Remarks. Do not use 
Officer Performance Report/Enlisted Performance Report style statements (that is, 
stratification). 
7.3.11.3.  Examiner’s Remarks. 
7.3.11.3.1.  General. For evaluations requiring two or more missions/events, the 
mission description and each required subsequent paragraph/subparagraph will be 
annotated with First Mission/Event/Sortie, Second Mission/Event/Sortie, etc., as 
applicable. 
7.3.11.3.2.  In all instances, except for the mission description, if no verbiage is needed 
annotate with “None”. 
7.3.11.3.3.  Paragraph A. Mission Description. Mission descriptions will be in 
accordance with AFMAN 13-1MDSV2. A comment addressing demonstrated 
instructional ability is mandatory for all instructor evaluations. 
7.3.11.3.4.  Paragraph B. Discrepancies. Document discrepancies by annotating the 
grading area, grading area title, grade awarded (Q-/U), short description of discrepancy, 
and annotation if discrepancy was debriefed. If there are no discrepancies, annotate 
paragraph B as, “Discrepancies. None.” Example: Area 19 – Aerial Refueling Missions 
“Q-” (Debriefed). (Specifics here). 
7.3.11.3.5.  Paragraph C. Recommended Additional Training. Training to improve 
performance for discrepancies identified, other than those that were “Debriefed.” 
Record the grading area in which the additional training is required. If there is no 
additional training, annotate paragraph C as, “Recommended Additional Training. 
None.” 
7.3.11.3.5.1.  Descriptions of assigned additional training include how satisfactory 
knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to an examiner or an instructor. 
7.3.11.3.5.2.  If additional training items will not fit on the AF Form 8, at a 
minimum, annotate the proficiency that will be required by the examinee prior to 
the requalification. 
7.3.11.3.5.3.  Evaluation discrepancies will be listed separately. If there is no 
additional training, annotate paragraph C as, “Recommended Additional Training. 
None.” 
7.3.11.3.6.  Paragraph D. Additional Comments. Comments are restricted to significant 
information dealing with the evaluation not documented elsewhere. 
7.3.11.3.6.1.  Document any commendable items (paragraph 5.3.2.7) under 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024

Chapter 8 
FLIGHT CREW INFORMATION FILE (FCIF) 
8.1.  Purpose. 
8.1.1.  Units establish and maintain a FCIF consisting of a current read file and publications 
library. The FCIF consists of six volumes organized as shown in Table 8.1 and will be filed in 
accordance with DAFMAN 90-161 in either hard copy or electronic format. (T-1) If a unit 
establishes an electronic FCIF, the location will be readily accessible and easily navigable by 
all crewmembers. (T-2) MAJCOMs may supplement Table 8.1 and Table 8.2 with additional 
documents within each volume. Units may also supplement Table 8.1 and Table 8.2 to meet 
unit requirements. 
8.1.2.  If any part of the FCIF is maintained electronically and not specifically addressed in 
this chapter or DAFMAN 90-161, units ensure that the information is current and accessible 
for concurrent viewing by multiple crewmembers. 
8.1.2.1.  At a minimum, units maintain the required index and location of electronic files 
in a hard-copy binder in a location easily accessible to all unit crewmembers. 
8.1.2.2.  Units utilizing electronic media should ensure backup copies of FCIF Volumes I 
and II (paper or electronic) are maintained and readily available. 
8.1.2.3.  If a hard copy library is used, CCV will establish local procedures for maintaining 
accuracy and currency of HHQ issued messages in the local supplements or process guides. 
(T-2) 
8.1.2.4.  Documents in the FCIF will be made available for deployments via either 
electronic or hard copy means. (T-1) 
8.1.2.5.  The AF Form 50, Flight Crew Information File, is the source document used to 
issue FCIFs. For details see Attachment 4. 
8.1.2.5.1.  Use the AF Form 50 to generate FCIF messages in which pertinent 
information is published to units (see paragraph 8.3.). MAJCOMs may tailor the form 
to reflect MDS information as necessary. 
8.1.2.5.2.  Units will utilize the AF Form 50 to release unit specific pertinent FCIF 
messages. (T-3) 
8.1.2.5.3.  Units are not authorized to rescind HHQ issued FCIF/Special Interest Items 
(SII) messages without the releasing authority’s written approval, unless past the 
rescind date. 
8.1.2.5.4.  Rescission requests are routed through functional Stan/Eval Channels for 
Releasing Authority determination. 
8.1.3.  The FCIF index and library is filed in accordance with DAFMAN 90-161, regardless of 
hard copy or electronic format. Procedures for maintaining, updating, and backup to prevent 
loss or corruption of the electronic version of the FCIF will be outlined in the unit supplement. 
8.1.4.  Required Volumes. If units choose hard copy format and the contents of any volume 
exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional binder, and identify the first and subsequent 
62 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024

FLIGHT CREW INFORMATION FILE (AF FORM 50) GUIDANCE 
A4.1.  AF Form 50.  FCIF and SII messages are generated using the AF Form 50. 
A4.1.1.  Instructions for posting published messages on the AF Form 50 can be found on page 
3 of the Form. 
A4.1.2.  Page 3 of the AF Form 50 is for reference only and is not to be printed or posted into 
the FCIF library. 
A4.2.  Generation of the AF Form 50. 
A4.2.1.  FCIF or SII. The originator determines the type of message to be published and selects 
the appropriate FCIF or SII block. 
A4.2.2.  Applicable MAJCOM. Non-lead MAJCOMS will develop procedures for 
coordination and publishing the AF Form 50. For AF Forms 50 generated below the MAJCOM 
level, units will select the unit’s assigned MAJCOM as the applicable MAJCOM. (T-2) 
A4.2.2.1.  For messages that may apply across multiple MAJCOMs, to reduce staffing and 
coordination efforts, MAJCOM POC will coordinate draft messages with MAJCOMs 
known to own the affected MDS for applicability determination. If during coordination a 
reviewing MAJCOM identifies the message as applicable, return comments should 
indicate that message should apply to the responding MAJCOM and include a POC to the 
draft message originator for inclusion in paragraph 4 of the final message draft. When all 
coordination comments have returned, the originator completes the document and forwards 
the completed (unsigned) form to each applicable MAJCOM Stan/Eval for routing to the 
respective MAJCOM/A3’s signature. After signatures are obtained, the MAJCOM 
Stan/Eval will publish the AF Form 50 to the affected units in that MAJCOM. 
A4.2.2.2.  For example, if the message applies to the CRC, the MAJCOM POC originator 
coordinates with other MAJCOMs known to have CRCs to determine applicability. The 
originating MAJCOM identifies the affected CRC MAJCOMs to be included in “the 
applies to” block. The reviewing MAJCOM provides applicability comments and the name 
of their primary POC for inclusion of the final draft. The originator compiles all the CRCs 
and POCs and forwards the final draft to applicable MAJCOM Stan/Eval to route for A3 
signature. 
A4.2.3.  Release Date. Date distributed to applicable/affected units/users. 
A4.2.4.  Unit Post Date. Date directed for unit to post the message. 
A4.2.5.  SUBJECT. The title of the published message. 
A4.2.6.  MESSAGE CONTENT. This section is the main content of the message to include 
the directive message, background information, administrative paragraph, POC information 
and list of attachments. See example AF Form 50 below. Information may continue on the next 
page in Amplifying Information or add an origination page as needed. 
A4.2.7.  ORIGINATOR SIGNATURE BLOCKS. Signature blocks are completed at the 
leadership level directing the message. 
78 
AFMAN13-1GBMC2V2  20 MAY 2024 
A4.2.7.1.  RELEASE AUTHORITY. The signature block and signature of the commander

A4.2.8.1.1.  If the message was issued at the MAJCOM or NAF level, the unit release 
authority is the wing or operations group Stan/Eval. 
A4.2.8.1.2.  If the message was issued at the wing or operations group level, and was 
posted for all subordinate units, then the wing/unit release authority is not required. 
A4.2.8.1.3.  If the message was issued at the wing or operations group level, and 
subordinate units are required to post the message and complete the DATE POSTED 
block, then the posting CCV function is the unit release authority and should sign upon 
posting. 
A4.2.8.1.4.  Units will ensure original AF Form 50 is posted, including attachments, in 
FCIF libraries in accordance with Chapter 8. (T-2) Wing/Group Stan/Eval will ensure 
compliance at all subordinate levels. (T-2) 
A4.2.8.2.  UNIT RELEASE AUTHORITY. 
A4.2.8.2.1.  If the message was issued at the MAJCOM or NAF level, and the wing or 
operations group released the message to be posted at the unit level, then the posting 
CCV function is the unit release authority and should sign upon posting. 
A4.2.8.2.2.  If the message was issued at the MAJCOM or NAF level, and the wing or 
operations group posted the message for all subordinate units, then the unit release 
authority is not required. 
A4.2.8.2.3.  If the message was issued and posted at the wing or operations group level 
for all subordinate levels, Unit Release Authority is not required.
