Introduction 
The new publication title is Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Mortuary Affairs in 
Theaters of Operations. The content in ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 includes 
updated terms and definitions that accurately reflect the audience and focus to enhance operational 
effectiveness of the United States Armed Forces. This publication provides official advice and standardized 
guidance on topics relevant to the employment of multi-Service forces. This serves as a planning and 
operations guide for all personnel engaged in Mortuary Affairs (MA) within a theater. As defined in JP 4-0, 
MA provides for the search, recovery, identification, preparation, disposition, and the handling of personal 
effects of deceased personnel for whom the Services are responsible by status and executive order. 
During large-scale combat operations, multi-Service commanders will be challenged to achieve superiority 
across multiple domains while accounting for all of their losses and maintaining the morale and welfare of 
the living. It is vital to the success of the campaign that MA tasks synchronize with sustainment warfighting 
functions, posturing multi-Service MA capabilities for maximum efficiency in unified land operations. 
Geographic combatant commanders should leverage multi-Service MA resources for MA staff planning and 
Service-specific capabilities available to search for, recover, process, and evacuate deceased personnel from 
the operational environment for the fullest possible accounting. In the event that evacuation is not possible, 
planning considerations for temporary interment of Department of Defense-affiliated persons is the last resort 
after exhausting all other courses of action. 
The tactics, techniques, procedures, and guidance in this publication are authoritative. Personnel will follow 
this publication except when, in the judgment of the commander, exceptional circumstances dictate 
otherwise. If conflicts arise between the contents of this publication and the contents of Service publications, 
the Service publication will take precedence. Commanders of forces should follow multinational doctrine 
and procedures ratified by the United States when operating as part of a multinational (alliance or coalition) 
military command. For doctrine and procedures not ratified by the United States, commanders should 
evaluate and follow multinational doctrine and procedures where applicable and consistent with United States 
law, regulations, and doctrine. 
This publication includes several changes. One significant change is that each military Service has its own 
Service-specific chapter and publication number. The chapters are arranged by common MA topics, MA staff 
planning, Service capabilities sustaining the warfighter in a large-scale combat operations environment, and 
the MA role in defense support of civil authorities. 
This publication contains 13 chapters and 4 appendices: 
Chapter 1 provides an overview of MA and related policy, roles, and responsibilities. 
Chapter 2 explains MA staff planning for all Services, planning considerations, formal agreements, 
operational contract support, MA planning roles and responsibilities, and Service command and support 
relationships. 
Chapter 3 discusses planning considerations for operations within a multi-domain extended battlefield. 
Chapter 4 discusses search and recovery operations. It describes phases of search and recovery and includes 
planning and procedures for immediate recovery of human remains and personal effects, unit non-MA 
recovery team responsibilities, deliberate search and recovery operations, and evacuation from the recovery 
site. 
Chapter 5 discusses mortuary affairs collection point (MACP) operations, roles and responsibilities, mission 
planning, capability and capacity, site selection and establishment, MACP protocols, mobile integrated 
remains collection system, MA equipment, required support, and MACP techniques and procedures. 
Chapter 6 discusses theater mortuary evacuation point operations, mission, roles and responsibilities, 
capability, equipment, required support, site selection and establishment, and evacuation.

Chapter 1 
Overview of Mortuary Affairs 
This chapter provides an overview of mortuary affairs activities. The Department of 
Defense mortuary affairs program covers the return of human remains across the 
continuum of conflict. Commanders at all echelons will use this information for theater 
of operations logistics staff planning, and personnel involved in military operations. 
MORTUARY AFFAIRS PROGRAM 
1-1. The Department of Defense (DOD) mortuary affairs (MA) program broadly provides for the care and
disposition of deceased personnel and the handling of their personal effects (PE) across a continuum of
conflict ranging from peace through war. This publication addresses the overarching conduct of MA logistics
for military operations outside the continental United States (OCONUS) with limited focus on continental
United States (CONUS) support. Subsequently, MA capabilities for processing remains at OCONUS
mortuary affairs collection points (MACPs) should not be used as a basis for planning factors in a defense
support of civil authorities (DSCA) mission under a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
mission assignment (see chapter 13 in this publication). For information on casualty operations and mortuary
facility operations refer to Service-specific regulations.
1-2. Military operations are increasingly trans-regional, multi-domain, and multifunctional in nature. These
operations may cut across multiple combatant commands (CCMDs) and across multiple domains. The
CCMDs and the Services provide MA support across the range of military operations to—
⚫
Search for, recover, and evacuate DOD-affiliated or covered fatalities, consistent with applicable
laws and regulations, during military operations.
Note. This publication does not address the recovery of remains from past conflicts. 
⚫
Operate MA processing points during military operations. MA processing points include transfer
points, MACPs, theater mortuary evacuation points (TMEPs), mortuary affairs contaminated
remains mitigation sites (MACRMS), temporary interment sites, and PE depots.
⚫
Collect, inventory, store, and process PE of deceased and missing DOD-affiliated or covered
persons.
1-3. MA personnel strive to avoid risk while returning human remains (HR) contaminated with biological,
chemical, or radioactive agents through routine MA channels unless mitigation of the contaminant is not
possible. Returning deceased personnel safely is a high priority. If mitigation to a safe level is not possible,
protecting the health of Service members and the public must take precedence over the rapid repatriation of
remains. Temporary interment of those contaminated remains that pose a threat to public health is the
recommended method of disposition until safe processing is possible with the approval of the geographic
combatant commander (GCC).
MORTUARY AFFAIRS POLICY 
1-4. DODD 1300.22 provides overarching policy for DOD’s development of tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTP) for mortuary affairs, including for joint operations. The DOD will recover, identify, and
return the remains of eligible personnel to their families as expeditiously as possible while maintaining the
dignity, respect, and care of the deceased, and protecting the safety of the living. The preservation of human
remains is a high priority, and every effort will be made to preserve the condition of the remains.
Chapter 1 
1-2
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
1-5. In accordance with (IAW) DODI 1300.29, personnel will not photograph, film, or videotape human
remains except as authorized by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES), a military criminal
investigative organization, or federal investigative agency with jurisdiction.
1-6. MA personnel provide the remains of contractors authorized to accompany the force (CAAF), allied
and multinational force (MNF) partners, and host nation (HN) or other country nationals the same dignity
and respect afforded to United States (U.S.) personnel.
1-7. Personnel will handle and process enemy dead with the same respect afforded to friendly military dead.
In addition, DOD personnel must protect enemy dead from disrespectful or degrading acts. For further
information on the international law, requirements relating to the treatment of enemy dead (see the
Department of Defense Law of War Manual).
1-8. The transportation of fallen Service members and other DOD-affiliated personnel is a very sensitive
matter, and personnel must handle the movement of human remains with the reverence, care, priority, and
dignity befitting them and the circumstances, IAW DTR 4500-9R, Part VII.
1-9. Temporary interment should only be used as a last resort to protect unit health and safety, but only
after exploring all other courses of action. In an overseas location, authority for temporary interment in an
overseas location rests with the GCC for their respective area of responsibility (AOR). The GCC may not
delegate this responsibility to subordinate commanders. (See chapter 8 for further information.)
1-10. A ship’s captain may authorize committal at sea when a preservation capability is not available aboard
ship and transfer to shore is not operationally feasible. This authorization may be without the knowledge or
consent of the deceased’s family only when HR pose a health hazard. Prior to a committal at sea, commanding
officers should attempt to consult with the AFMES and the military criminal investigative organization that
has investigative jurisdiction IAW Title 10, United States Code (USC), Section 1471.
1-11. For DOD policy concerning cremation, refer to DODD 1300.22 and DODI 1300.29.
STAKEHOLDER RESPONSIBILITIES 
1-12. The DOD assigns roles and responsibilities that contribute to the DOD MA program. Refer to DODI
1300.29 for additional information.
ARMED FORCES MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM 
1-13. IAW DODI 5154.30, the AFMES—
⚫
Serves as the DOD scientific authority for the identification (ID) of human remains of DOD-
affiliated personnel spanning the full range of military operations.
⚫
Conducts or reviews forensic pathology investigations, which may include autopsy examinations
of the deaths of Service members or other DOD-affiliated personnel. In some instances, it may
deploy medical examiners or medicolegal death investigators to conduct forensic investigation
within the AOR during military operations.
⚫
Revises standard MA procedures to support the recovery and ID of human remains following
specific events or operations, if necessary.
MILITARY SERVICES 
1-14. The military Services are responsible for the administration and support of the forces assigned or
attached to combatant commands.
1-15. Each Service should train, equip, fund, and organize to recover, tentatively identify, and transport
human remains spanning the full range of military operations.
1-16. Unit commanders who sustain losses in combat operations are responsible to coordinate and execute
recovery and evacuation of deceased personnel to the nearest MACP. DOD does not require an escort during
theater evacuation. (For more information, see chapter 4.)

ARMY 
1-17. In addition to the military Service recovery responsibilities, the Army must maintain a force structure
capable of providing theater-level MA coverage. The Army is responsible for establishing and operating
MACPs, TMEPs, and theater personal effects depots (TPEDs). When assigned, the Army will provide
general support (GS) or direct support (DS) to the other Services.
1-18. The Army also has the responsibility to conduct MACRMS operations. Today, there is no current
enduring capability to perform this mission. This capability gap has been addressed at the DOD level and
current interim solutions have been identified for low fatality single chemical events only. The DOD TTPs
for contaminated human remains are under development. (See JP 3-11 for the requirements for MA
mitigation procedures, personnel, equipment, and facilities in the event of a chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear [CBRN] incident.)
GEOGRAPHIC COMBATANT COMMANDER 
1-19. The GCC gives direction and guidance on providing MA support to all assigned and attached forces
physically present in the AOR, with the exception of United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM).
The USNORTHCOM AOR encompasses the 48 contiguous states and a portion of United States Alaskan
Command, making the military Services responsible for the administration and support of their mortuary
forces during peacetime. However, during DSCA and Homeland Defense operations in the USNORTHCOM
AOR, mortuary forces will most likely be assigned to the lead Service supporting USNORTHCOM. The
GCC ensures all guidance is IAW law, executive order, and DOD policy.
1-20. The GCC ensures accomplishment of the following tasks:
⚫
Establish a joint mortuary affairs office (JMAO) to provide oversight of MA support within the
AOR. The GCC authorizes a theater mortuary affairs office (TMAO) when the JMAO has an
extended area of operations (AO).
Note. The JMAO and TMAO are responsible for detailed MA planning, execution of the MA 
support mission, guidance, and policy within the AOR. 
⚫
Designate a Service component to serve as the lead Service for the theater MA support program
for the AOR. When military operations are trans-regional, the GCC may designate a lead Service
at selected subordinate joint force commander levels and assign responsibilities, tasks, and assets.
Note. The lead Service may also have the responsibility for establishing a TMAO. 
⚫
Authorize temporary interment in an overseas location during large-scale combat operations when
the number of fatalities overwhelm immediate evacuation capabilities from the AOR.
⚫
Review formal agreements for the release of DOD fatalities to U.S. control, evacuation, and return
of allied and coalition fatalities with those military partners. The GCC has the authority to institute
MNF agreements and acquisition and cross-servicing agreements (see CJCSI 2120.01D) for MA
during military operations including—
▪
QSTAG 655, which identifies shared procedures between the American, British, Canadian,
Australian, and New Zealand Armies.
▪
NATO STANAG 2070 Ed: 5, and NATO Allied Tactical Publication ATP-92 Edition A,
Version 1, which establish procedures to use when evacuation of HR out of the CCMD is not
possible during contingency operations. (For more information, see NATO Allied Tactical
Publication-92.)
⚫
Coordinate for release of HN fatalities. This task resides with the GCC in conjunction with the
Department of State through the American Embassy, the International Committee of the Red
Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross, and Red Crescent Societies, as appropriate.

Respond to requests from the Department of State, and when approved by the Secretary of
Defense; collect, inventory, store, and process the PE of U.S. citizens and others. When directed,
collect the PE of MNF partners, third-country national, local national, and adversary personnel.
1-21. The GCC should limit the use of HN or other country national support to general labor, administration,
transportation, or facility support. Commanders should only utilize DOD military, DOD civilian mortuary
officers, or DOD-contracted civilians, all of whom are U.S. citizens, to accomplish search, recovery, and
processing of U.S. human remains and the inventory of PE. If a negotiated agreement does not exist,
commanders should ensure personnel perform MA support under current U.S. military procedures.

Chapter 2 
Mortuary Affairs Planning 
From the strategic to the tactical level, mortuary affairs staff planning requires 
logistical problem solvers that can coordinate and synchronize efforts with the 
evacuation of human remains and PE. Linking available movement assets with 
elements that require mortuary affairs support will be the most challenging in multi-
domain and large-scale combat operations. As fatalities occur in the operational area, 
mortuary affairs staff planners at all echelons work in unison to evacuate the human 
remains and PE back to the aerial port of embarkation for onward movement to the 
CONUS port mortuary for final disposition. Planners will make a collaborative effort 
to work with multi-Service, interagency, and MNF partners, leveraging support 
relationships with stakeholders throughout the operational area to identify risks and 
assist commanders with decision making. At all levels, the reporting, tracking, and 
processing of fatalities requires a partnership that combines support relationships with 
all the Services, agencies, and commands in order to preserve, safeguard and 
expeditiously evacuate the fallen. 
OVERVIEW OF MORTUARY AFFAIRS STAFF PLANNING 
2-1. The planning required for using MA assets during contingency or large-scale combat operations will
necessitate coordination between staff planners at all echelons including the JMAO at the GCC level and the
TMAO.
2-2. During contingency and combat operations, MA operations require considerable resources, are highly
complex, and receive extensive media and political attention. The JMAO and the TMAO must coordinate
the actions of the combatant command MA and transportation processes to evacuate all DOD-affiliated HR
in a timely manner. Overseas GCCs support the military departments in coordinating for the recovery,
tentative ID, preparation, and evacuation of HR to a DOD mortuary.
2-3. During multi-Service and multinational operations, MA staff planners must ensure that joint doctrine
takes precedence. Specifically, it is imperative that MA planners and MA personnel process all HR in the
same manner IAW JP 4-0, appendix M, and all applicable international and cooperative agreements in the
specific theater. For more information, refer to chapter 5 in this publication on site selection, setup, layout,
maintenance, and any other planning requirements for MA operations.
SUPPORT PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
2-4. Providing adequately trained and sustainable MA support in a joint operations area (JOA) requires
effective planning and coordination. Proper planning across all functional areas of a CCMD staff allows for
a systematic examination of all relevant factors of an operation that support interoperability with other plans.
Planners should analyze the joint force’s mission, threat, fatality estimates, duration of the operation, HR
evacuation modes, availability of lift assets, and available MA assets. Planners should also assist with
determining the phasing and number of MA assets required during an operation.
2-5. The threat is a composite of ongoing enemy actions, characteristics of both friendly and enemy forces,
occupational, environmental, geographical, and meteorological conditions, and the possible employment of
weapons of mass destruction.
Chapter 2 
2-2
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
2-6. The manpower and personnel directorate of a joint staff prepares a personnel estimate that should
contain fatality projections. In addition, each Service formulates fatality estimates according to individual
Service directives supporting operational planning and assessments, future force planning, and training.
Planning for MA support should be continuous and flexible to adjust for unexpected situations. Planners
should review and amend plans and orders as new facts become available, resources change, and other
variables become apparent.
2-7. Establishing evacuation routes for remains using defined logistics channels is critical to smooth MA
operations in the JOA. Transportation of HR from MA facilities is on a first in, first out basis. MA planners
should consider all modes of transportation for evacuating remains. MA personnel should evacuate HR as
quickly as possible using air transport (preferred mode) or retrograde convoys to the TMEP.
2-8. The GCC supports the military Services in coordinating for the recovery, tentative ID, processing, and
evacuation of HR. The MA concept of operations for a given mission supports the requirements of the forces
and agencies involved. The concept of operations may differ in scope, detail, objectives, and available
resources for specific operations. (For more information on concept of operations, see JP 3-0.)
2-9. Changes to the commander’s intent or the mission require the MA planner to update the concept of
operations ensuring continuity of MA support. When operations involve a declared conflict, there is generally
a need to establish theater MA facilities to include MACPs, TMEPs, and TPEDs. (For additional guidance
on the preparation of the concept of operations, see CJCS GDE 3130.)
INTEGRATION OF ASSIGNED MORTUARY AFFAIRS ASSETS 
2-10. The military Services deploy MA capabilities throughout the entire JOA, which require proper
integration and support to carry out their mission successfully. Staff elements at all levels of command must
understand the importance of providing the proper required support for MA personnel. The commander must
ensure that adequate planning and support is in place to prevent mission failure. Military and political
objectives can hinge upon the success of the MA mission.
IMPACTS ON MORTUARY AFFAIRS MISSION 
2-11. The consequences of a failed MA mission or disrespectful handling of HR can have a negative impact
in the following key areas:
⚫
Morale within the losing unit.
⚫
National public support.
⚫
Coalition support.
⚫
Local national support.
⚫
Enemy treatment of HR or prisoners.
Strategic and Operational Level Integration 
2-12. Cross-leveling strategic and operational MA planning is critical in the success of fully integrating MA
assets. The MA planners must follow several key steps to maximize the probability of MA mission success.
These processes are not linear and may occur simultaneously. Planners may enhance campaign operations
by requesting multi-Service MA assets to deploy, occupy, and execute tasks that support a GCC joint task
force. Additionally, the time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) is not static; real-world situations,
events, and competing priorities influence the scheduling of arriving units. Therefore, MA planners should
continually update and rework their portion of the operational plan:
⚫
The first step is a thorough TPFDD scrub to ensure adequate allocation of MA resources to the
theater. Planners base this determination upon the operational plan analysis and casualty estimates
for all forces and civilians in the JOA.
⚫
Next, the MA planner will allocate MA resources to specific units listed on the TPFDD. Based on
the operational plan analysis, planners allocate resources to ensure the proper positioning of
adequate MA resources supporting current and future operations. Planners must clearly identify
and articulate proper command relationships to subordinate units.
Mortuary Affairs Planning 
03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
2-3
⚫
Following the allocation of MA resources to specific units, MA planners will ensure these assets
flow into the same aerial port of debarkation, seaport of debarkation, or staging area as the
supported unit. To expedite this integration, MA planners will ensure MA personnel arrive with,
or as close as possible to, the MA equipment.
⚫
Once MA personnel and equipment arrive and link up, they must successfully integrate into their
supported unit. Successful integration of MA assets with the supported unit facilitates the
completion of the reception, staging, onward movement, and integration process and allows the
GCC to generate combat power.
Tactical Level Integration 
2-13. Tactical units must ensure successful integration of their assigned MA equipment and personnel. The
logistics planners must execute several key steps to achieve this goal:
⚫
Units will receive allocated MA assets from higher command. Once assigned, unit leadership must
make every effort to complete the integration process prior to the unit starting operations. If
successful integration is not possible, staff planners must inform commanders of the tactical and
political risks associated with conducting operations with no MA assets.
⚫
Planners must develop and inform the supported unit of their command relationship with MA
assets. To facilitate the proper reporting and reassignment of MA assets, a clear understanding of
this relationship by all parties involved is imperative.
⚫
All subordinate units must clearly understand the proper evacuation procedures for both HR and
PE. This includes the PE associated with the HR and the PE left in the unit areas. (See chapter 6
for more information on PE.)
2-14. Planners must ensure that all subordinate units understand the priorities of forward and rearward
movement of personnel and material. Evacuation of HR must always be of the utmost priority.
FORMAL AGREEMENTS 
2-15. Formal agreements assist in establishing procedures for the release of U.S. human remains not
currently under U.S. control. Review formal agreements such as—
⚫
North Atlantic Treaty Organization standardization agreements.
⚫
Quadripartite standardization agreements.
⚫
MNF agreements (mortuary).
⚫
Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements (see DODD 2010.09 and Title 10 USC 2341 and
2342).
⚫
Status-of-forces agreements.
⚫
Defense security agreements.
2-16. In addition to formal agreements, international law including treaties, the law of armed conflict, the
Geneva Conventions, and customary international law may have an impact on procedures for the release of
U.S. remains not under U.S. control. See the DOD Law of War Manual for additional information.
2-17. The CCMD may enter into additional supplemental agreements with the HN to facilitate the transfer
of remains from the HN to U.S. control. These agreements may take various forms. The lead Service for the
MA program within the GCC should maintain copies of all such agreements. These agreements can
supplement the status-of-forces agreements or other overarching agreements in any of the following:
⚫
Implementing agreements.
⚫
Implementing instructions.
⚫
Technical agreements.
⚫
Exercise support agreements.
2-18. Establishing liaison with nongovernmental organizations (for example, International Committee of the
Red Cross or Red Crescent) is beneficial to support the MA mission for releasing HR of non-U.S. personnel.

OPERATIONAL CONTRACT SUPPORT 
2-19. Operational contract support (OCS) is the process of planning for and obtaining supplies, services, and
minor construction from commercial sources in support of GCC-directed operations. MA operations may
include OCS items such as ice, refrigerated storage, and the use of cadaver dogs to support search and
recovery (S&R) operations. Potential situations requiring this type of support would include mass fatality,
aircraft mishap, or a structural collapse.
2-20. OCS for the use of cadaver dogs to support S&R operations will include provisions for cadaver dog
health and welfare requirements, including veterinary care. Planning considerations may also include
protective gear, mitigation measures to reduce risk of hypothermia or hyperthermia, and facilities and
supplies for performing decontamination after exposure to threats and hazards, such as toxic industrial
chemicals or materials. Army Veterinary Service personnel can advise MA planners on these requirements.
2-21. The number of personnel in the JOA, its geographic size, and the specific location will have a large
impact on allocation, type of support, and placement of MA facilities.
2-22. The level of infrastructure development or availability (examples include facility location, lines of
communication, airfields, and other support facilities) may affect sustainment operations.
2-23. Availability of host-nation support for facilities and contract support items may affect logistical support
requirements.
2-24. To reduce the logistical footprint, MA planners should review OCS options to fulfill requirements for
equipment and supplies such as ice machines, additional refrigeration units, and vehicles.
Note. DOD MA operations must limit the use of HN support, local national support, or other 
country national support to general labor, administration, transportation, and facility support. Only 
allow U.S. military, United States Government (USG) civilians, and DOD-contracted civilians, 
(all of whom are U.S. citizens) to accomplish search, recovery, processing, and evacuation of U.S. 
human remains and PE. 
2-25. For non-U.S. human remains and PE, follow current U.S. military procedures. Failure to negotiate an
agreement to provide MA services should be resolved by the JMAO at the GCC logistics directorate (J-4).
2-26. Personnel support contracts with commercial companies will identify the eligibility of contractor
personnel to receive DOD MA support in the event of a contractor fatality. Potential contractor fatalities may
significantly affect the size and scope of MA planning and operations. Additionally, MA operations must
account for the cost of military MA services rendered on behalf of contract personnel in order for contracting
officers to obtain appropriate reimbursement from the company.
2-27. Planning should include provisions to provide MA support to CAAF. The terms and conditions of the
contract between the DOD organization and the contractor dictate the level of authorized and provided MA
support, which is either on a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis. Transport of contractor remains may
be subject to local HN laws and jurisdiction prior to arrival at a civilian aerial port of embarkation (APOE).
The company of the deceased contractor is generally responsible for notification of next of kin and transfer
of HR and PE. Companies may or may not be responsible for storage of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
samples to facilitate ID of the deceased.
2-28. Contracting officers will account for and facilitate reimbursement for costs of MA services provided
to contractors as appropriate.
2-29. HN and U.S. laws establish legal jurisdiction affecting release of human remains to U.S. control.
2-30. MA planners should consider the religious and faith associated beliefs of the deceased and local
populations that may affect MA operations and evacuation timelines. For additional information on this topic,
see appendix D and a list of religious references in this publication.
2-31. MA personnel may provide support to all DOD-affiliated personnel (including U.S. citizen CAAF on
a reimbursable basis) involved in an AO. This support can extend beyond U.S. citizens, employees of other
Mortuary Affairs Planning 
Publication Date 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
2-5
USG departments and agencies, and CAAF who die OCONUS. The DOD may provide this service on a non-
reimbursable or a reimbursable basis. In addition, it can extend to unified action partners involved in a given 
mission. 
2-32. There are MA liaison personnel within sustainment organizations that will assist with evacuating
remains to the TMEP. The MA liaisons provide a conduit for coordination between DOD and outside
agencies as needed.
COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT 
2-33. An effective communications system is vital to planning and conducting successful MA programs. The
MA unit should be able to communicate directly with the casualty reporting personnel and the
communications system should be compatible with other Service and MNF systems.
2-34. Planners should specifically ensure the availability of an unclassified computer network and
unclassified DSN voice communication support at the MA facility location to enable continuous support for
the Mortuary Affairs Reporting and Tracking System (MARTS) and Defense Casualty Information
Processing System (DCIPS). Tactical communications, including secure computer and voice access, should
be available at the MA facility or as close as possible when regulations do not authorize access in the MA
facility. The MA personnel operating at the facility should possess the necessary security clearance to conduct
MA operations.
2-35.  Efficient and effective MA support increasingly depends upon the DOD information network to fulfill
its role. Threats include state and non-state actors, criminals, insider threats, and the unwitting individuals
who intend no malice. A single vulnerability within this network can place units and operations at risk,
potentially resulting in mission failure. Every individual is responsible for compliance with the proper
practices and procedures for safeguarding information and information technology. (See FM 3-12, AR 25-2,
and the Service-specific cyberspace security publications.)
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
2-36. During military operations, fully protecting personnel, equipment, facilities, and the environment may
not always be possible. MA planners should specifically address—
⚫
Occupational safety and health considerations.
⚫
Exposure control plan.
⚫
Work practice controls.
⚫
Other potentially infectious materials.
⚫
Regulated medical waste.
⚫
Contaminated HR and associated PE.
2-37. For additional information, see TG 195A and 29 CFR 1910.
2-38. The DOD must anticipate a request for assistance to provide MA support for non-DOD affiliated
personnel within the JOA. Consequently, MA planners should review agreements, entitlements, laws, and
regulations for the provision of DOD MA services, eligibility for transportation, and consult with the staff
judge advocate as needed.
OTHER PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
2-39. Additional considerations for MA planning include—
⚫
Command and control (C2) of the MA operation (reporting officials, chain of command,
communications equipment, and administrative requirements).
⚫
Number and location of MACPs, TMEPs, and TPEDs required.
⚫
Location of major road networks, alternate routes, rail lines, airports, and seaports.
⚫
Time required for MA facilities to reach full operational capability.
⚫
Time required to call-up Reserve Component (RC) MA forces.

⚫
Interface with nongovernmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, embassy
officials, and other USG personnel as needed. (Important when coordinating temporary interment
locations as a last resort.)
⚫
Establishing protocols for potential contaminated human remains.
2-40. During humanitarian assistance, DSCA, or homeland defense operations, the use of various
investigation teams has proven to be effective to support the MA mission. Investigative elements will
interview area personnel and conduct an on-site assessment to conduct recovery operations. Planners should
consider requesting the appropriate specialized assets to support MA investigative teams.
2-41. Theater-level MA planners should have available MA site surveys for countries within their AOR. The
MA site survey assesses MA infrastructure value for contingency operations. If a country survey is not
available or is not current, theater planners should request a survey be conducted by the logistics planners on
the ground. If there are no logistics planners available to conduct the survey, the theater planners conduct
one to determine refrigerated container and refrigerated facility support, morgues, embalming capabilities,
and identify current MA procedures already resident in the country that apply to U.S. forces.
2-42. The Office of the Secretary of Defense for public affairs has published strict guidelines regarding
release of information, photographing, and video recording of any type for deceased personnel, flag draped
transfer cases, and transportation ceremonies (see detailed guidance on these topics in DODI 1300.29). The
MA plan should support the commander’s communications strategy by addressing public affairs topics, such
as—
⚫
Handling casualty press releases.
⚫
Prohibited photography and video recording of the evacuation of human remains.
⚫
Ensuring media requests are routed through the command public affairs office for—
▪
Release authority and guidance on casualty and mortuary affairs.
▪
U.S. and multinational prisoner of war matters or missing in action.
▪
Enemy prisoner of war matters.
2-43. There are instances where embedded media and public affairs may interact with MA personnel and
facilities.
2-44. For additional information on public affairs and media support in the JOA, see JP 3-61 and consult the
command public affairs for the latest guidance from the DOD public affairs office.

Mortuary Affairs and the Operational Environment 
Multi-Service mortuary affairs in the extended multi-domain operational environment 
must optimize combined operations. The U.S. Armed Forces must use technical 
dominance, global power projection, and operations through the tactical, operational, 
and strategic levels of war in support of national defense and the national military 
strategy. Mortuary affairs must synchronize as a part of the sustainment warfighting 
function across the Services for efficient execution of global mortuary affairs 
operations throughout each prospective theater of operations. Services within the DOD 
must provide full disclosure of mortuary affairs capacities and capabilities with 
engaged multi-Service planning and collaboration to ensure projection of mortuary 
affairs resources and personnel at scale to ensure deceased Service members and 
associated PE are evacuated expeditiously from theaters of operations to their 
designated family members.  
MULTI-DOMAIN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT 
3-1. The extended multi-domain operational environment (OE) will demand that Service members are
strategically-minded joint warfighters who think critically and creatively, and execute globally integrated
MA operations under conditions of disruptive change. Service members executing multi-Service MA
operations must utilize lethality, mobility, and protection to search and recover, process, and evacuate HR
and associated PE from theaters of operations.
3-2. The extended multi-domain OE provides peer adversaries with capability to contest the U.S. Armed
Forces in all domains with increased lethality and ever-increasing complexity. Multi-Service theater MA
operations must mitigate anti-access and area denial systems that create multiple layers of standoff. Multi-
Service theater MA personnel and equipment require external protection for effective execution of MA
operations. Multi-Service MACPs will require staffing to support two 12-hour shifts during 24-hour
operations due to the inherently high fatality rates associated with large-scale combat operations. As the battle
intensifies, planners must identify the multi-Service MA teams that will operate in a DS capacity to maneuver
elements throughout the JOA; these MA teams must rely on the supported unit for force protection.
3-3. In addition to providing multi-Service MA personnel and equipment, planners must ensure MA
capabilities in direct support of combat units are properly employed, with a presence in both designated
consolidation areas and remote areas. As maneuver units push and pull, retrograde, and refit, MA must extend
support through all available means. Multi-Service MA operations must synchronize MA processes to ensure
optimal utilization of assets. In large-scale combat operations, evacuation operations will require optimal
throughput of remains and associated PE from tactical areas to the CONUS port mortuary using established
sea and aerial ports in the JSA.
THEATERS OF OPERATION 
3-4. The United States Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, and Southern CCMDs control
and coordinate multi-Service MA operations within their operational theaters. Shaping the OE requires threat
and infrastructure assessments in order to designate logistics requirements for a theater to execute the GCC’s
intent. Operational theaters present inherent characteristics that determine operational plans for achieving
national objectives. Planning considerations for multi-Service theater MA operations must shape operational
environments with resources from all components of the U.S. Armed Forces to sustain major military
operations supporting large-scale combat operations.

ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
3-5. Multi-Service theater MA operations are simultaneous and geographically dispersed operations that
vary by environment. The Service component commands provide responsive support by synchronizing MA
resources in highly contested and lethal areas. The common operational picture for multi-Service theater MA
operations reflects the employment of MA assets throughout the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of
war. Planners must identify MA teams that require force protection and conditions for MA support.
3-6. Planners must establish throughput methods within their theater logistics overviews identifying flat
rack transfer points, aerial delivery locations, and available sustainment resources to increase evacuation of
HR and associated PE. Considerations for reconstitution of MA personnel and materiel will be critical during
large-scale combat operations. Designated distribution and retrograde channels may use additional
transportation nodes for remains and associated PE due to high fatality numbers during offensive operations.
3-7. Prepositioning of MA resources in prepositioned stocks and sustainment command warehouses will
contribute to the MA support and resupply of MA materiel during large-scale combat operations. Planning
processes must continuously consider multi-Service MA operations to consolidate gains. The execution of
MA operations throughout operational environments must support national strategic objectives. Multi-
Service MA personnel must understand, balance, and assume risk to ensure responsive MA support to
operational forces.
Integration 
3-8. Service component staff planners should integrate MA assets and capabilities into operational plans.
This requires deliberate coordination and synchronization with component partners to achieve
complementary and reinforcing effects for the full continuum of mortuary affairs operations.
Anticipation 
3-9. Planners must forecast support and throughput for high fatality numbers during large-scale combat
operations. They must utilize the experience and training of multi-Service MA personnel and staffs. Planners
must be able to visualize and identify necessary resources and capabilities providing MA support to theaters.
Planners must account for competing priorities for required external support. These deciding factors will
establish the theater multi-Service MA common operational picture for commanders.
Responsiveness 
3-10. To reduce travel time and increase responsiveness, theater-level sustainment planners should
coordinate for MA support to be in position as close as possible to the tactical units prior to offensive
operations. Joint large-scale combat operations may require multi-Service MA augmentation capabilities to
support MACPs and TMEP evacuation operations. MA support should be resourced to provide the right
support in the right place at the right time. A detailed common operating picture will facilitate phased MA
support through each OE.
Simplicity 
3-11. MA assets provide a full spectrum of MA support to U.S. Armed Forces and allies. The MA units must
be equipped, structured, and trained to execute sustainment missions in support of maneuver operations.
Personnel and equipment must be allocated to theaters of operations in relation to the number of forces
operating within the region.
Economy 
3-12. MA planners ensure campaign plans identify theater logistics capabilities and shortfalls for more
efficient execution of operations. Staffs and units must have visibility of governmental organizations, allied
nations, and host-nation support available in theaters of operation.

ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
3-3
Survivability 
3-13. Planners integrate air defense countermeasures into logistical consolidation areas to protect
sustainment forces. Because sustainment is often vulnerable to enemy attacks, sustainment survivability
depends on active and passive measures and maneuver forces for protection.
Continuity 
3-14. Sustainment is dependent upon joint and strategic integration and planners meticulously coordinate
across echelons to ensure continuity in resourcing MA operations to reach the point of employment.
Improvisation 
3-15. Planners must take into consideration that each OE is fluid, complex, ever changing, and require
flexible MA support for maneuver courses of action.
EXECUTION DURING MULTI-DOMAIN OPERATIONS 
3-16. Multi-Service MA operations execute support during decisive action at the strategic, operational, and
tactical levels of war. MA operations at each echelon must provide responsive support during extended multi-
domain operations. MA support must be as close as possible to tactical units in order to reduce evacuation
travel time. Aerial delivery and additional modes of transportation are required to assist with the intra-theater
evacuation of deceased personnel and associated PE. Failure to provide efficient support during offensive
operations can cause tactical pauses, culminate offensive operations, and prevent consolidating gains.
Strategic 
3-17. GCCs develop campaign and contingency plans that include using multi-Service MA to support joint
forces in the JOA. The JMAO in the J-4 joint logistics operations center works closely with the Service
component commands to identify MA assets. The GCC can task another Service as the lead Service in joint
operations. For example, the Department of the Air Force may be assigned as the joint task force commander.
The joint task force requires a force multiplier from the Army, such as MA units. These units would fall
under the C2 of an air expeditionary task force (AETF) and report up a non-Army Service component
command (ASCC) level chain of command.
Operational 
3-18. A joint logistics element in the theater may be managed by either an Army assistant chief of staff for
logistics (G-4), theater sustainment command (TSC), Marine logistics group, Navy logistics readiness center,
or an Air Force A-1 AETF using force support squadron personnel, and all drawing MA expertise to operate
as the TMAO. The MA sustainment planner for the theater focuses on the operational sustainment
management responsible to synchronize with higher, adjacent, and joint enabling agencies that require MA
resources. It is imperative that the command and staff understand what each partner provides to support the
GCC and Service component command objectives. In most cases, the Army staff at the ASCC level manages
MA functions as the lead agent for MA operations and delegates this task to the TSC.
Tactical 
3-19. During large-scale combat operations, the Service component command responsible for MA will
assign assets to the highest sustainment echelon in an AO, which simplifies how tactical commands will
receive MA augmentation support. MA specialists are assigned forward as MA teams, platoons, and units to
the highest sustainment echelon for employment with maneuver elements. These MA assets may require
consolidation for maximum MA support to recovery and evacuation operations.
SUSTAINMENT DURING EXTENDED MULTI-DOMAIN OPERATIONS 
3-20. The TSC establishes C2 of operational-level logistics for MA operations by employing one or more
expeditionary sustainment commands (ESCs), which provide a rapidly deployable, regionally focused,
Chapter 3 
3-4
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
forward-based C2 capability until a TSC can assume that function. When the Army is the predominant land 
force operating within an AO, the TSC or ESC, at the discretion of the joint force commander, has the 
capability to become a joint logistics headquarters providing logistics support to all joint forces within the 
JOA. This is contingent upon the other Services, DOD agencies, and CCMDs providing the appropriate 
augmentation of personnel and capabilities to support this joint mission. Even though the majority of MA 
logistics capabilities are sourced from the RC, the Army and Marine Corps have MA common-user 
equipment and adhere to the same processes that expedite the evacuation of remains and PE from the AOR. 
3-21. Multi-Service MA liaison personnel synchronize efforts by communicating MA support requirements
through the joint force commander. This collaborative support is constantly challenged by tailoring the right
support for increased operating tempo and consolidating resources for the GCC’s air and surface theater
movement of remains and PE. The JMAO, on behalf of the GCC, ensures continuity in the JOA in accordance
with the GCC’s overall priorities.
OPERATIONS DURING CONSOLIDATION OF GAINS 
3-22. The execution of multi-Service MA operations during consolidation of gains will contribute to
achieving the GCC end state. Emphasis will shift from supporting maneuver units defeating threat forces to
transferring responsibility from multi-Service MA personnel to HN government, interagency partners, and
other organizations. Multi-Service MA operations transitioning to humanitarian relief for HN populations, in
coordination with unified action partners, can add value to any Service sustainment package. As maneuver
operations defeat enemy forces, logistics formations can expand the MA footprint, which also facilitates
increased throughput of remains and associated PE from the tactical areas to the JSA.

Chapter 4 
Search and Recovery Operations 
Commanders of all Services have the responsibility to care for deceased personnel 
within their AO. The search and recovery of human remains is the first step in the care 
and handling of deceased personnel. A search and recovery operation is the systematic 
process of searching for and recovering HR and PE, plotting and recording locations, 
and evacuating the HR and PE to the nearest MA facility. Commanders must make 
every reasonable effort to successfully search for, recover, and evacuate all human 
remains within the AO. When a unit is unable to recover its own deceased personnel, 
the unit will coordinate with the appropriate higher headquarters to request search and 
recovery support from MA personnel through the TMAO. 
SECTION I - SEARCH AND RECOVERY OVERVIEW 
4-1. Each Military Service is responsible for the search, recovery, and tentative ID of deceased personnel
when possible in the AOR. Commanders at all levels are responsible for recovery.
4-2. Deceased personnel that are assigned and attached (military, DOD civilian and covered contractors)
are evacuated from the incident site to their nearest MA facility. For personnel accountability, commanders
are also responsible for S&R operations for deceased personnel of other nations and Services within their
AO. Units can contact the TMAO or the lead Service for MA within the AOR for further guidance on
recovering deceased personnel from allied or MNF partners, or other Services. (See JP 4-0, appendix M for
additional information.)
4-3. S&R is the first step in the MA process on the battlefield. Commanders must make every reasonable
effort to successfully recover and evacuate all deceased personnel in their AO. Daylight hours are the normal
S&R periods. However, commanders may direct recovery operations during hours of darkness to move a
fatality to the unit casualty collection point (CCP). Prior to deployment, the unit commander identifies those
personnel to train and equip as part of the unit recovery team to conduct the recovery tasks.
4-4. When a unit suffers a loss, leaders must initiate a DA Form 1156, Casualty Feeder Card (for Army
personnel) or the parent Service-specific form for reporting a fatality. Units send the casualty feeder form to
the higher headquarters (HQ) personnel office or casualty liaison team. This will assist commanders and
casualty liaison teams in producing the initial casualty report in DCIPS.
4-5. If possible, commanders will ensure a unit representative accompanies the deceased to the MACP to
establish tentative ID. In addition to the associated PE found on the remains, all individual combat clothing
and equipment stays on the deceased and travels with the remains for forensic examination by the AFMES.
When a unit is unable to recover its own deceased personnel, the unit coordinates with the appropriate higher
HQ to request S&R support from MA personnel. During the handling of HR, personnel must take care to
avoid exposure to blood or body fluids IAW universal precautions as outlined in TG 195A.
4-6. The command will use the unit recovery team to conduct the initial search and recovery. Unit recovery
teams are non-mortuary affairs personnel available to conduct immediate recovery operations.
Mortuary affairs personnel do not normally staff these teams. MA liaison personnel may accompany the team
to provide guidance if available, and if doing so does not impact MA operations.
4-7. There are three distinct phases of search and recovery: combat, post-combat, and area clearance. The
S&R phases describe the actions that occur during the two types of recovery operations.
Chapter 4 
4-2
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
4-8. There are two types of search and recovery operations:
⚫
Immediate recovery operations are performed by the unit recovery team to search for and
recover human remains and personal effects during the combat phase when the tactical
situation permits a recovery with the forces at hand without detailed planning or
coordination.
⚫
Deliberate search and recovery operations are performed during the post-combat and area
clearance phases, when enemy threat is minimal, and adequate time is available to use all
the detailed techniques.
COMBAT PHASE 
4-9. The combat phase of S&R begins with immediate recovery operations. During military operations, the
unit commander is responsible for the initial search and recovery of all human remains within their AO. It is
important for personnel making the initial recovery to not remove any clothing, individual equipment, and
PE found on the remains, document the site location, and report this information to the MACP or closest MA
facility. MA-trained personnel will use this information to conduct a site closure or area clearance phase
search. If remains are not recovered due to the movement of organizational elements, lack of sufficient
personnel, or tactical or logistical conditions, specific location of remains and all pertinent facts must be
reported by the commander to the next higher-level HQ for appropriate action to effect recovery and
evacuation at the earliest time.
POST-COMBAT PHASE 
4-10. The purpose of the post-combat phase is to locate remains that were not recovered prior to the
movement of combat elements from the battle area as soon as it is practical. This phase immediately
supplements initial immediate recovery operations and is accomplished by the unit recovery team or MA and
additional personnel as needed. The higher-level HQ assigns a plan for deliberate S&R operations to
supplement the immediate S&R operations. The MA personnel from the closest supporting logistics
command may be tasked to assist with the deliberate S&R operations; however, removing MA personnel
from an MACP should be a last resort as it will degrade the MACP capability to process and evacuate HR
and PE. Commanders must make every effort to recover their deceased personnel during this phase,
documenting the location of the search area and providing this information to the higher-level HQ who will
assist with the site closure or area clearance phase.
AREA CLEARANCE PHASE 
4-11. The area clearance phase represents a final thorough deliberate search and recovery of each area where
military forces were engaged in combat. The purpose of this search is to locate and recover all remains not
recovered during combat or post-combat phases, and to ascertain that no recoverable remains are in the area.
GCCs should conduct area clearance operations using MA personnel to recover and account for deceased or
missing personnel immediately after fighting has ceased.
4-12. The Defense Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Accounting Agency will conduct search and recovery
for past conflicts as outlined in 10 U.S. Code § 1509 (a). This agency’s mission is to achieve the fullest
possible accounting of all Americans missing as a result of the nation's past conflicts, and has site closure
responsibility for past conflicts.
SECTION II – UNIT RECOVERY TEAM 
4-13. This section describes the unit recovery team and its associated duties and training. Commanders
appoint personnel to a unit recovery team on official written orders, ensuring that they maintain the assigned
recovery equipment and receive adequate training to conduct immediate recovery operations. Non-MA unit
personnel will follow guidance in this chapter for search and recovery operations. Commanders should ensure
multiple teams receive training and are available if required for mass fatality recovery operations, as in large-
scale combat operations.

UNIT RECOVERY TEAM OVERVIEW 
4-14. The commander is responsible for the conduct and safety of the unit recovery team. The team consists
of at least five personnel, with a minimum of one noncommissioned officer (NCO) assigned as the team
leader. Unit commanders will ensure the following:
⚫
Commanders should integrate unit recovery team training into the training schedule semiannually,
for all contingency operations, and during deployments.
⚫
Unit leaders must ensure the unit recovery team has medical and occupational health support
available to support the team’s immediate medical needs, provide health and wellness checks to
monitor injury or illness, and respond to exposure to bio-hazardous blood and body fluids IAW
TG 195A.
⚫
Unit leaders must ensure that all appointed unit recovery team members receive the high-risk
occupation immunizations required by their Service medical regulation (for example, AR 40-562).
⚫
Commanders may request additional MA guidance from the MA Officer or NCO on staff at their
supporting logistics command, or as a last resort, the supporting MA facility (Navy, refer to
NAVMEDCOMINST 5360.1).
⚫
MA personnel responsible for training the recovery team will ensure the appropriate equipment
and location is available to support the training or rehearsal.
4-15. In order to adequately resupply unit recovery team operations, logistics units that own supply support
activity warehouses will stock human remains pouches (HRPs) at 25% strength of all units within their
designated support area. The Air Mobility Command (AMC), Defense Logistics Agency, and appropriate
depot-level supply source will stock HRPs and human remains transfer cases (HRTCs) or the insulated human
remains transfer case (IHRTC) for theater resupply to MA operations. The JMAO will monitor theater
stockage levels and request additional stocks from the TMAO.
Note. Units that stock HRPs should track and monitor their storage and shelf life (60 months). MA 
planners will track and report stockage and consumption rates through support operations (SPO) 
channels. 
UNIT RECOVERY TEAM TRAINING 
4-16. Non-MA unit recovery team training includes—
⚫
S&R training on immediate recovery operations (minimum semiannually).
⚫
Instruction on safeguarding and accounting for PE recovered at the incident site.
⚫
Familiarization with the individual and team equipment, including applicable S&R forms.
⚫
Training from occupational health on blood-borne pathogens, the donning and doffing of personal
protective equipment (PPE), and medical requirements to handle HR (see appendix A).
⚫
Training on operational public health and safety, preservation of HR awaiting transport and in
temporary storage, and proper disposal of bio-hazardous material.
⚫
Training from qualified MA personnel:
▪
Army: Logistics command staff MA NCO.
▪
United States Marine Corps (USMC): Personnel Retrieval and Processing (PRP) company or
Marine logistics group MA staff officer or NCO.
▪
United States Navy (USN): Supply corps personnel officer or a PRP company representative.
▪
United States Air Force (USAF): Force Support personnel such as Prime Readiness in Base
Services (RIBS).
4-17. Requests for training support should go through command channels when the logistics command
cannot provide a qualified trainer for non-MA unit personnel.

UNIT RECOVERY TEAM LEADER 
4-18. The unit recovery team leader must ensure—
⚫
The team searches the whole area completely using strict search discipline (see figures 4-1 and 4-
2 on page 4-10).
⚫
All site-related hazardous waste is disposed of IAW TG195A and reports any blood-borne
pathogens exposure to the medical treatment facility.
⚫
HR are transported in a covered vehicle to provide proper dignity by concealing from view.
⚫
HR are carried on a litter feet first and face up, keeping the HR shrouded at all times, and evacuated
to the CCP for movement to the nearest MACP.
⚫
The team conducts S&R operations properly and completes the proper reports IAW the Service-
specific format. If HR are irretrievable or incomplete (missing major portions), initiate the proper
reports. (See appendix C in this publication for additional information.)
Note. Army personnel see FM 6-99 for U.S. Army report and message formats. 
4-19. The unit recovery team leader is also responsible for team member work site safety and health, and
ensures that—
⚫
The team leader trains and rehearses with the unit recovery team training (minimum
semiannually).
⚫
The team receives PPE, proper wear training, and has sufficient MA supplies to sustain the unit
recovery team mission.
⚫
Wellness checks are performed upon mission completion.
4-20. The unit recovery team leader is responsible for ensuring the required MA supplies are on hand and
serviceable. Prior to deployment, the unit should maintain quantities of MA supplies required to accomplish
HR recovery (HRP, PE bags, footlockers for PE) based upon 10% percent of the unit's strength. Contact the
higher HQ MA staff NCO for resupply.
UNIT RECOVERY TEAM MEMBERS 
4-21. Non-MA unit recovery team members must be appointed on orders by the commander, ready with the
proper fitting PPE, and participate in unit recovery team training at a minimum of twice per year. Team
members must plainly understand the unique security requirements and demands encountered when dealing
with HR. They should also maintain individual and recovery team equipment and MA supplies for mission
readiness.
4-22. Team members should be medically screened and receive the appropriate immunizations to perform
MA functions. They should also have access to spiritual support and behavioral health as needed.
IMMEDIATE RECOVERY OPERATIONS 
4-23. Immediate recovery operations are initiated when the threat of enemy attack is high, and time to recover
sensitive items, remains, portions, and PE is limited. Unit personnel develop a plan to provide security of the
recovery site to accomplish the recovery of remains, portions, and sensitive items as a priority. Recovery sites
are areas where human remains or other material evidence have been deposited, or are believed to
have been deposited. Remains, portions, and sensitive items have first priority for recovery over PE due to
the evolving enemy threat. Conditions do not allow time for a thorough detailed grid search of the incident
site.
4-24. Also known as hasty recovery, these techniques are used when active combat operations are still
ongoing, enemy threat is high, or very limited time is available to conduct S&R to reduce risk to troops (for
example, downed aircraft). Hasty recovery sites may always be followed up by a deliberate search and
recovery when conditions allow. However, some technology must be destroyed in place to prevent
Search and Recovery Operations 
03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
4-5
compromise if it cannot be recovered. In these cases, a hasty recovery should be conducted if commanders 
determine conditions allow. 
4-25. During the combat phase, non-MA units should make every effort possible to safely recover deceased
personnel with the wounded. If the HR cannot be recovered safely, unit leaders must report the grid
coordinates and the condition of unrecovered HR to the unit commander. The unit commander will plan to
initiate a deliberate S&R mission as soon as tactical conditions allow or during the post-combat phase. Units
should make every attempt to conduct S&R operations during daylight hours.
Note. Exception to this guidance is for immediate recovery operations occurring during hours of 
darkness. Tactical use of the cover of darkness to move a fatality to the CCP will be at the 
discretion of the commander. 
4-26. For non-MA unit recovery teams, the minimum equipment it should carry to conduct immediate
recovery operations includes—
⚫
Covered vehicle (for evacuation).
⚫
PPE (latex-free disposable gloves, eye protection, and N-95/Single-Use Protective Mask).
⚫
Litter (recover and evacuate fatalities).
⚫
HRP, National Stock Number (NSN) 9930-01-331-6244.
⚫
DD Form 1380 (Tactical Combat Casualty Care Card) if attended by a medical provider.
⚫
Global Positioning System (GPS) devices.
⚫
PE Bags.
HEALTH AND SANITATION 
4-27. One of the basic dangers of S&R operations is the sustained contact with HR. Proper personal health
and sanitation practices are vitally important as handling HR in various stages of decomposition can result in
both medical and biological hazards. Infectious organisms may be associated with the HR and the areas where
the HR are found or processed. Personnel may be exposed to a number of pathogens that can cause infection
when they perform MA operations. When a person dies, the human body undergoes a series of biological
changes, collectively referred to as decomposition. These changes stem from two key factors: the cessation
of biological functions within the body and the spread and activity of bacteria after death. However, this does
not happen immediately, and the transmission of an infectious agent from a deceased human to a living person
can occur.
4-28. Therefore, each person involved in recovery, evacuation, or processing of HR must ensure successful
implementation of safety and health procedures. (For more information on health and safety information for
MA personnel, see appendix A in this publication and refer to TG 195A.)
RECOVERY TEAM PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

planning estimate and the analysis of mission variables. Specialized personnel may be required to conduct
the S&R mission.
4-31. When planning for a S&R, it is important to gather all pertinent data on—
⚫
Mission (hostile or non-hostile).
⚫
Fatalities.
⚫
Appropriate equipment (for example, engineer).
⚫
MA supplies required.
⚫
Specialized personnel required.
4-32. Analysis of the mission variables will greatly influence different missions, S&R teams, and MA
capabilities available to respond to a mass fatality incident. Planning may require coordination with several

different outside agencies or units for security, logistics (including transportation), and augmentation of MA 
personnel. The mission variables consist of— 
⚫
Mission.
⚫
Enemy.
⚫
Terrain and weather.
⚫
Troops (or Service members) and support available.
⚫
Time available.
⚫
Civil considerations.
SPECIALIZED PERSONNEL 
4-33. It is essential to mission success that personnel who are familiar with the people, equipment, and
munitions located at the S&R site are present. Some specialized personnel include—
⚫
CBRN personnel.
⚫
Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel.
⚫
Security personnel.
⚫
Linguists.
⚫
Medical personnel.
⚫
AFMES staff (medicolegal death investigator or forensic pathologist).
⚫
Engineer support personnel.
⚫
Transportation personnel.
⚫
Other required personnel (for example, losing unit or other Service personnel).
⚫
MA personnel (pending availability, mission dictated).
UNIT COMMANDER ACTIONS 
4-34. The unit commander must execute the following actions for a theater death:
⚫
Report the fatality to higher HQ via telephonic status report and message format, initiating the
initial fatality report for DCIPS.
⚫
Activate the unit recovery team to conduct S&R, and resource the team to the maximum extent
possible.
⚫
Return all government property (maps, weapons, sensitive items, or equipment) issued to or found
with the deceased to the unit supply section. These items do not accompany the remains to the
MACP.
⚫
Ensure the deceased being recovered is transported to the nearest MA facility with all protective
equipment (body armor and helmet included) for the AFMES forensic examination.
⚫
Coordinate for a person (unit leaders, first-line supervisor, roommate, or close friend), if available,
to do the visual recognition of the deceased on DD Form 565 (Statement of Recognition of
Deceased).
⚫
Ensure all PE found on the remains at the time of the recovery are transported to the MACP.
⚫
Refer to the Service-specific regulation on MA for unit commander actions concerning a fatality
(Army personnel see AR 638-2 and DA PAM 638-2).
⚫
Initiate a DA Form 1156 (or parent Service form) and notify higher HQ.
⚫
Ensure the appointed summary courts-martial officer (SCMO) or summary courts officer (SCO)
is available for the inventory of PE remaining in the unit area per Title 10 USC 816 and Manual
for Courts-Martial United States Rule 1301(a). The Summary Courts Martial Convening
Authority appoints SCMOs and SCOs (see chapter 7 and respective Service publications for more
information).

SECTION IV – SEARCH AND RECOVERY TECHNIQUES 
4-35. This section describes and outlines the techniques used by all military Services for MA search and
recovery operations in a theater. Personnel and equipment requirements are identified in this section.
DELIBERATE SEARCH AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS 
4-36. When it is suspected that HR or portions have been left on the battlefield during the combat phase,
commanders should begin planning for deliberate S&R operations using the unit recovery team.
Note. Marine Corps commanders should report potentially unrecovered HR to higher HQ so the 
Personnel Retrieval Platoon can be tasked to conduct the deliberate S&R. See chapter 10 for more 
information on Marine Corps MA. 
4-37. MA personnel should be used as a last resort as to not degrade the theater's capability to process and
evacuate HR. The following rules apply:
⚫
The team leader for the deliberate S&R mission will follow all priorities listed in this chapter.
⚫
Conduct S&R operations during daylight hours.
Note. Moving a fatality to the unit CCP during hours of darkness is executed at the discretion of 
the commander. 
⚫
When recovering HR, the team will immediately transport to the unit CCP, the nearest MACP, or
MA facility, whichever is closest.
⚫
If a unit cannot recover a member of their unit, the unit commander must request MA support
from their higher HQ as quickly as possible to recover the unaccounted HR.
⚫
For reporting fatality incidents, complete and forward a Human Remains Search and Recovery
Status Report (REMAINSARSTAT) to higher HQ (See appendix C for a sample). For other than
Army, the military Service that suffers the loss will initiate a casualty report IAW Service-specific
regulatory guidance.
USE OF ADDITIONAL SPECIAL SKILLS PERSONNEL 
4-38. In the post-combat phase, it is more likely to have a greater availability of specialized personnel to
assist during deliberate S&R operations. These personnel may include, but are not limited to—
⚫
Linguists.
⚫
Life support technicians.
⚫
EOD.
⚫
CBRN.
⚫
Additional MA personnel.
⚫
Medical personnel, including behavioral health and preventive medicine personnel.
⚫
AFMES staff (for example, forensic pathologist, medicolegal death investigator).
⚫
Canine search teams (non-DOD asset).
⚫
Anthropologists.
DELIBERATE SEARCH AND RECOVERY EQUIPMENT 
4-39. The recommended equipment items for conducting deliberate S&R operations include, but are not
limited to—
⚫
Proper PPE for the MA task, (see table 4-1 on page 4-6).
⚫
Additional PPE (M-40 or M-50 protective masks, or full-face respirators to protect against
depleted uranium, asbestos fibers, carbon fibers, and other associated hazards).

⚫
Human remains pouch.
⚫
Axe, machete, or hatchet to remove vegetation or clear an area prior to a search.
CONDUCTING DELIBERATE SEARCH AND RECOVERY 
4-40. When conducting a deliberate S&R mission, the S&R team arrives at the dismount point and receives
instructions from the team leader. The team follows a systematic method (see figures 4-1 and figure 4-2 on
page 4-10) to allow team members to cover the entire established search area thoroughly. At a minimum,
each team should consist of a team leader, two flankers, and enough people to cover the search area
adequately, but team composition can vary depending on the mission requirements. The team leader should
have predesignated duties for each member and perform pre-combat inspections on individual and team
equipment prior to departing for the site.

4-11
LEADERS ACTIONS 
4-41. Prior to executing S&R missions, the leader conducts reconnaissance to assess the site and determine
if there are any additional personnel or resources required. Teams use this assessment to establish boundaries,
identify danger areas, coordinate security, and determine the search methodology to use. This assessment
may need to be coordinated with the logistics command for aerial reconnaissance of the recovery site search
area. Army personnel should use TC 3-25.26, and other Service personnel should use their appropriate
Service reference for land navigation information when conducting S&R operations. In preparation for S&R
operations, the team leader—
⚫
Assesses the search area to determine the best search method to use: open or closed search pattern:
▪
Open search formation (double-arm interval) is used for open or sparsely vegetated areas.
▪
Closed search formation (single-arm or close interval) is used for densely vegetated areas or
difficult terrain with limited visibility.
⚫
Equips the recovery team with the necessary equipment (for example, GPS, compasses, sketch
map paper, map overlays), appropriate PPE (minimum of gloves, goggles, and masks to protect
against depleted uranium, asbestos fibers, carbon fibers, and other associated hazards), and a
machete or hand ax, if required, to clear ground brush.
⚫
Ensures adequate security personnel stay at the dismount point to relay communications.
4-42. For established S&R responses where an incident commander, military criminal investigation
organization, or other investigative agency is present, the MA team leader should consult with this on-site
representative to determine the evidence to document and collect. The focus of the MA team's recovery
should be for associated and disassociated personal effects and evidence on or in vicinity of the human
remains. For S&R responses where no incident command or external agency structure is established, the MA
team should consult with the TMAO for further guidance and distinction.
4-43. During deliberate S&R operations, the team should consider HR and PE as armed with improvised
explosive devices (IEDs) or unexploded ordnance (UXO) until determined otherwise. Teams should take
proper precautions prior to handling any HR, portions, or PE. Teams can check small portions and PE for
possible IEDs by close visual examination prior to searching the site. If IEDs or UXO are present, halt
operations, move away from the incident, and request EOD support.
4-44. After the EOD checks have been completed, the team should move single file, with the team leader
and communications operator in the center of the formation. Once the team leader has determined the team
is within approximately 100 meters of the given recovery site location, the team either will assemble into an
open or closed formation.
4-45. Based upon available resources and the defined search area, teams may employ several search
methods:
⚫
Strip or line search for covering large or open areas.
⚫
Zone or sector search assists a team to divide a larger search area into zones or sectors.
⚫
Point-to-point search method for small, confined areas.
⚫
Spiral or circular search for outdoor sites with one to two personnel conducting the search.
⚫
Clockwise search and counterclockwise search are inside search patterns with two personnel
conducting the search.
Note: Search methods are shown in figure 4-1 on page 4-10. 
4-46. The fields of view of the adjacent searchers should overlap. The team should then use the straight-line
box search method (see figure 4-2 on page 4-10) with the team leader in the rear-center of the formation:
⚫
The S&R team will search in a slow and steady pattern, searching side-to-side for items pertaining
to the operation and potential recovery site.
⚫
The team leader should ensure the team maintains proper intervals, moves in the direction of the
potential recovery site, and always stays on line.
Chapter 4 
4-12
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
4-47. Time and threat level permitting, team members may observe an item that may be relevant to the
search. The team will use a predetermined verbal or hand-and-arm signal to alert the team to halt for—
⚫
The team leader to examine the items, and if the item is deemed to be HR, portions of HR, or
disassociated personal effects. Disassociated personal effects are personal effects not found on
the human remains or cannot be associated at the time of recovery.
⚫
The team leader to mark the item with a predetermined color pin flag or other suitable marking
method.
⚫
The team leader to mark any item that could be associated with the event. Collect and return these
items to the MACP for forwarding to the AFMES for examination when in doubt.
⚫
Annotation of the S&R number assigned to the item and a description in a field notebook and site
sketch.
Note. An R number (for example, R-1) will be assigned to any item found that constitutes more 
than 50 percent of a human body that is intact and includes a majority of the torso. The team leader 
will make this determination. If there are no items representing more than 50 percent, all portions 
will receive a sequential P number (examples of this would be P-1, P-2, and P-3). A torso will be 
marked as HR. Body regions such as an isolated head or legs, even if attached at the pelvis, will 
be marked as a portion. 
4-48. This search and marking method will continue until the team has reached a point at least 100 meters
past the last marked item:
⚫
The team leader will halt the team and direct either the left or right flanker to face about, depending
on which direction the search will proceed.
⚫
The remaining team members will pivot around the flanker, remaining online until the team is
facing in the opposite direction.
⚫
This search should extend 100 meters past the last recovery item found in each direction. If deemed
necessary, the team leader may expand the limits of the search area.
⚫
The team leader directs the team to search until they find all HR or until there are no portions of
HR in the area.
4-49. Team members must be aware of areas where HR may be located:
⚫
The team should search unusual ground disturbances that may be due to temporary interments,
collapsed bunkers, hasty burials, isolated interments, or fighting positions.
⚫
The team should be aware of unusual odors, and congregations of insects, scavenger birds, or
animals. All these are indicators that may lead to finding hidden HR.
RECOVERY PRECAUTIONS 
4-50. All personnel handling HR, portions, or PE must wear the proper PPE (see table 4-1 on page 4-6),
based on the exposure potential stemming from—
⚫
The probability of contact with blood and other potentially infectious materials.
⚫
The likely amount of contact.
⚫
The expected duration of contact.
4-51. Once the entire area has been searched and all relevant items marked, the recovery team will begin the
documentation and recovery process:
⚫
During combat, recovery teams should consider HR and disassociated personal effects as
potentially having an explosive device.
⚫
Recovery teams should always take proper precautions prior to handling any HR, portions, or PE.
⚫
For small portions and disassociated personal effects, check for possible IED traps by close
examination prior to handling.

03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
4-13
⚫
If the recovery team discovers an IED or UXO, the team should immediately request EOD
assistance to clear the area of any additional explosive threats and conduct a blast analysis on the
HR.
⚫
Once the EOD specialist or team has determined the area is clear of explosive threats, the recovery
team will continue the collection of the HR, to include fragmentation of the HR or PE that
disassociated from the HR because of the explosion.
⚫
Teams should place the PE items in an HRP with the HR, as the teams already marked all
preexisting disassociated evidence.
WARNING POSSIBLE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES 
HR represent a higher probability of having a suspected explosive 
device, so visual inspection may not always locate the presence 
of these devices. 
4-52. Team members should complete the following tasks:
⚫
Designate personnel to document and safeguard PE. This should be the first personnel to encounter
the HR after IED/UXO checks are complete. These personnel must thoroughly check the entire
HR for PE, including the hands, neck, pockets, boots, and load-bearing vest.
⚫
Designate a two-person team (or multiple teams if large amounts of PE are identified) to document
and safeguard PE. One person maintains clean-hands and writes data on forms, PE bags, and clear
sealed zip-closure bags. The second person handles remains, portions, and soiled PE
(biohazardous items) to expose data needed for documentation and packages for transportation.
Note. Pay particularly close attention to locating the ID tags and the ID card. Leave ID tags or ID 
cards in place on the HR. Use official ID media found as a basis for establishing tentative ID. 
Leave all ID media, PE, clothing, and organizational equipment on the HR for forensic analysis. 
Inventory the PE and record these items on DD Form 1076. 
⚫
Place the PE in a clear, sealed zip-closure bag, and then place in a PE bag.
⚫
Secure the PE bag to the left wrist of the HR if possible. If not, securely attach the PE bags to
another location on the HR.
⚫
Sign DD Form 1076. This becomes the chain of custody document for PE.
⚫
Place DD Form 1076 in a clear sealed zip-closure bag with PE.
⚫
Ensure the team uses proper S&R techniques and submits the proper report REMAINSARSTAT
(FM 6-99) or the military Service-specific format to report a fatality. (See appendix C for a
sample.)
⚫
Initiate the proper reports (Report of Unrecovered Remains and Report of Unrecovered/Missing
Portions) if HR are irretrievable or incomplete (missing major portions). (See appendix C for a
sample format of these memorandums.)
⚫
Document the completed S&R mission, which should include DD Form 567, DD Form 565, DD
Form 1076, site sketch, and a log of coordinates. When applicable, teams should generate a DD
Form 1074. (See appendix C for more information on these forms.)
Field Site Notebook 
4-53. During recovery operations, the team leader should keep a detailed record of every aspect of the
recovery operation in a field site notebook. The field site notebook should—
⚫
Include site sketch and detailed sequence of events on TTPs used to conduct the S&R mission.
⚫
Include the team leader’s information, date of recovery, and signature on the last page.
⚫
Be forwarded with the HR as evidence to the MA facility and onward to the AFMES. If the team
does not find any HR, or if the team must suspend operations for tactical reasons, the team leader
Chapter 4 
4-14
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
will report this information and the extent of the search to higher HQ. The team leader includes as 
much detailed information as possible to aid any future S&R missions. 
Note. If the team cannot complete any forms at the recovery site, the team will complete the 
necessary forms at the CCP or nearest MA facility. Contact the MA NCO at the supporting 
logistics command or see appendix C in this publication for completing the MA forms. 
Recording Identification Media 
4-54. Personnel designated to locate and record items of official ID media should—
⚫
Check the HR thoroughly, in all areas, for clothing and equipment like uniform nametape, laundry
markings, helmet band marks, and uniform and equipment sizes.
⚫
Look for any items or markings such as serial numbers and markings on items of unit-issued
equipment.
⚫
Annotate U.S. Government ID Card, ID tags, rank insignia, and uniform patches on DD Form 567.
Note. Do not annotate PE items on DD Form 567. 
4-55. All equipment is transported with the HR, including body armor, and the information is recorded on
DD Form 567 minus (weapons, ordnance, sensitive items, or unit-essential equipment)—
⚫
Ensure not to remove the body armor from the deceased. The body armor and helmet will stay on
the HR until the remains arrive at the AFMES location for forensic examination.
⚫
Remove all weapons, ammunition, and explosive ordnance from the HR. Record serial numbers
for weapons and return these items to the unit.
Obtaining Statement of Recognition of Deceased 
4-56. When there are S&R team members or other personnel in the recovery area who can visually identify
the HR, a designated team member should complete DD Form 565. The S&R team member completing the
form will annotate as much information as possible using information provided by the acquaintance out of
sight of the HR. Once these blocks are completed, after verifying the HR are identifiable, the team member
will escort the acquaintance to the HR and determine if the HR can be visually recognized.
4-57. During the viewing, the team will note in the remarks block of DD Form 565 any discrepancies they
find with the descriptions previously provided.
Note. HR will not be washed or have clothing removed to aid the recognition process. 
4-58. The team must complete all remaining blocks on the form and the acquaintance must sign in the
appropriate block (see appendix C for more information on DD Form 565). The team member completing
the form will sign in the witness block.
4-59. As the unit recovery team conducts the recovery, it is important to—
⚫
Document the site location (at minimum the grid coordinates) and identify major landmarks and
terrain features.
⚫
Create a map overlay and site sketch, if possible, in case another team must return to the site.
⚫
Report this information to the MA NCO serving on the logistics command staff. Teams may use
this information to conduct a post-combat phase S&R or area clearance.
⚫
Complete a REMAINSARSTAT (or parent Service) report. (See appendix C for a sample.)

4-15
Questioning Local Inhabitants 
4-60. During search or recovery operations, if teams encounter local civilians that may have information
pertaining to the loss, a designated team member should attempt to complete DD Form 1074 and the
following actions (teams may need linguists or interpreters to accomplish tasks):
⚫
Teams should attempt to gain information on other unrecovered HR in the area.
⚫
The teams then forwards this report to the JMAO or TMAO with other documents, even if the
team finds no HR.
COMPLETING TAGS FOR HUMAN REMAINS, PORTIONS, AND 
DISASSOCIATED PERSONAL EFFECTS 
4-61. The designated (clean hand) team member should prepare two S&R tags for each remains, and one tag
for each portion and disassociated personal effects. Attach one S&R tag to the center of each HR and the
other to the zipper tab of the HRP.
4-62. The S&R tags for HR should have the S&R number on one side that consists of the mission number,
the branch of Service of the recovering unit, the unit designation, and the number assigned to the HR. See
figure 4-3.
Figure 4-3. Multiple human remains ground 
Note. 015/AR 387th QM/4of6 would be the S&R number. The tag would represent the 15th S&R 
mission for the Army 387th quartermaster (QM) company. These HR would be the fourth of six 
HR recovered on this mission, or R-4 for HR.

DEPLETED URANIUM 
For HR recovered from any vehicle suspected to contain depleted 
uranium, teams should mark DU (depleted uranium) on the reverse side 
of the S&R tags as a precaution, see figure 4-6. 
4-65. Figure 4-6 is an example of a tag for an immediate S&R number, Army B Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd

4-67. Portions recovered from the same general location should not be individually bagged, unless instructed
to do so by an AFMES official. The recovery location for each portion is critical to conducting an
investigation. When at all possible, maintain skeletal integrity and keep skeletal HR together. Place the
portions in an HRP for evacuation.
4-68. Never combine portions recovered from different S&R sites or missions in the same HRP or transfer
case.
4-69. If the team suspects commingling, place the portions together in an HRP. The AFMES staff will
examine and sort.
4-70. Mark the outside of the HRP to indicate portions. Place the tag or automated identification technology
device inside a clear, sealed zip-closure bag or in a sealed, watertight container. Place the zip-closure bag or
watertight container inside the HRP or attach it to the outside of the HRP.
4-71. See figure 4-8 for an example of S&R tags for disassociated personal effects. These tags should have
the number assigned to the effects annotated on one side and the reverse side should be blank.

HRP as effects. Place a tag or automated identification technology device (if available) inside the HRP or
attach it to the outside of the HRP.
DECEASED CASE FILE FORMS 
4-73. After completing all information on the MA forms (DD Forms 1076, 565, 567, and 1074), the team
leader will designate a team member to ensure custody of the forms and to keep them dry.
4-74. Place the MA forms inside a sealed, watertight container or clear sealed zip-closure bag and place the
bag inside the proper HRP.
4-75. Place the documents prepared for each HR, portions, or PE into a sealed watertight container or slide
interlocking sealed (clear plastic) bag and place the bag inside the proper HRP.
EVACUATION FROM THE RECOVERY SITE 
4-76. Use distribution backhaul to evacuate remains to the higher HQ consolidation area or nearest MA
facility. When evacuating HR, the S&R team should—
⚫
Treat the deceased with dignity, honor, reverence, and respect.
⚫
Place the HR into an HRP.
⚫
Always keep the HR shrouded (or covered) prior to moving when an HRP is not available.

⚫
Ensure the S&R tags are properly attached and marked:
▪
One tag is attached to each HR.
▪
One tag is attached to the zipper tab on the HRP.
⚫
Carry the remains on a litter feet first, face up. This is mandatory for reverence and respect to the
deceased.
Transporting Human Remains 
4-77. Load feet-first towards the front of the covered vehicle for ground transportation and the same on a
rotary-wing aircraft.
4-78. Load head-first toward the nose of the fixed-wing aircraft.
Moving Human Remains 
4-79. CAAF personnel may assist in carrying and transporting HR on the battlefield:
⚫
U.S. deceased personnel will be accompanied by DOD-affiliated personnel to the nearest MA
facility (for example, MACP or TMEP).
⚫
The S&R team will coordinate with the respective area MA NCO for transportation of the HR
from the CCP to the nearest MACP or MA facility (whichever is closer).
4-80. When evacuating large numbers of fatalities during large-scale combat operations, HR will be
transported using all available means as quickly as possible, since refrigeration will not be as readily available
as during smaller-scale operations. Leadership will request transportation assets and movement control
personnel to accommodate fatalities as needed.
Closing the Site 
4-81. Prior to evacuation, the team leader will conduct two final searches of the site to ensure no further
evacuation items are located. This process will continue until no further evacuation items are found. The
team will process any additional evacuation items as outlined above.
SECTION V – AREA CLEARANCE OPERATIONS 
4-82. Area clearance is a final and thorough S&R for all remains and PE not previously recovered during
either the combat or the post-combat phase. Immediately after a conflict, MA units should conduct area
clearance operations to recover or account for deceased or missing personnel from all known recovery
sites. The Defense Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Accounting Agency is the lead agency for
conducting area clearance operations of all Americans missing as a result of the nation's past conflicts.
4-83. The methodology employed can vary dependent on the lead stakeholder, which may be an investigative
agency, scientific identification authority, or GCC representative. These lead stakeholders will exercise best
judgement to maintain provenience, maintain integrity of evidence, and facilitate scientific identification.
The discovery, excavation, and documentation techniques explained below are common and proven
operating practices. However, any and all of these processes may be conducted differently if any of the lead
stakeholders determine a more suitable methodology should take precedence.
GRIDDING THE RECOVERY SITE 
4-84. Recording coordinates with GPS technology is the preferred method of site documentation and
recovery. When this technology is not available, and circumstances call for a more thorough and lengthier
search, the gridding of a recovery site may be exercised. Using the union grid system will ensure a more
thorough and accurate documentation of the recovery site. The recovery site is an area where human
remains or other material evidence have been deposited, or are believed to have been deposited.
4-85. Once the area has been searched and all items marked, a permanent point of reference or datum is
selected. This datum should be in the southwest corner of the defined recovery site. There should be no
known HR, portions, or disassociated personal effects located to the south or west of this position.
Chapter 4 
4-20
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
⚫
Before excavating HR from the recovery site, the datum should be marked to be easily located in
the future. This can be done in several ways, such as by driving a metal stake into the ground or
even by stacking rocks. If the southwest corner has a prominent object that can be used as a datum,
mark it so that it is easily distinguishable from other like items in the area.
⚫
The line from the datum running due north (0 degrees) is called the meridian line. This line extends
in uniformed increments (meters) until it surpasses the northernmost marked item in the recovery
area.
Note. The smaller the increments, the more accurately the site will be documented. 
⚫
Wood or metal stakes are placed at the proper increments in a direct line from the datum to the
northernmost boundary of the recovery area.
⚫
The line from the datum running due east (90 degrees) is called the baseline. This line extends in
the same increments as the meridian line until it surpasses the easternmost marked item in the
recovery area.
Note. The length of the baseline is rarely the same as the length of the meridian line. 
⚫
To build the grid interior, start with the meridian and base line. Once the meridian and baselines
have been emplaced, a measuring tape or rod is extended north from the first stake east of the
datum on the baseline and east from the first stake north of the datum on the meridian line. An
additional stake is placed at the point where these two devices intersect. This process is continued
northward until the end of the meridian line is reached. The devices are moved over one stake to
the east and the process repeated. This process is continued until the entire recovery area is
gridded. This process will create a graph-like appearance comprised of small boxes, which are
called units. Twine or engineer tape can be strung between the stakes to better define these units.
⚫
The Pythagorean Theorem is used to check the accuracy of square of the units. The square of the
hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The units
are measured diagonally and the theorem A2 + B2 = C2 is used. Example: A 4-meter (m) × 4m unit
measured diagonally should be 5.657m.
⚫
The numbering system used to define each unit within the recovery site begins with the datum.
The datum should always be numbered for example, N500/E500. The numbers for each unit north
and east of the datum will ascend in the increments the units were emplaced. For example, if each
unit is 2m × 2m, then the first stake north of the datum on the meridian line will be numbered
N502/E500, since it is 2m north and 0m east of the datum. Likewise, the first stake east of the
datum on the meridian line will be numbered N500/E502 since the unit is 2m east and 0m north
of the datum. The unit to which these numbers correspond will be the unit directly north and east
of the stake.
⚫
Each unit is comprised of four individual quadrants: northwest, northeast, southwest, and
southeast. Indicating in which quadrant of a particular unit an item was found will make
documentation of the recovery more accurate. For example, if an item found was noted that item
P-7 was found in N512/E504 on a recovery site comprised of 2m × 2m units, the variance of
marking the location during a site recreation would be 2m. However, if it were noted that item P-7
was found in the SW quadrant of N512/E504, the variance would be reduced to only 1m.
EXCAVATING THE RECOVERY SITE 
4-86. In order to recover HR from interment sites, collapsed bunkers, and especially aircraft mishaps,
excavation of soil within the recovery site may be required. During aircraft mishaps or military criminal
investigations, the S&R team leader must coordinate with the lead for the investigating organization to ensure
S&R does not interfere with the investigation and vice versa. The equipment used for excavation can vary
from large earth-moving machines to small hand trowels and horsehair brushes. It is important to always
recover as much of the HR as possible. With modern technological and scientific methods, it may be possible
Search and Recovery Operations

4-21
to make a scientific ID using a small portion of soft tissue, or hard tissue found amongst thousands of 
fragments from several different individuals. 
4-87. During catastrophic events, there may be an abundance of minuscule pieces of HR. Sometimes these
portions can be present as scattered surface materials or buried at a depth of several feet interspersed with
aircraft debris, foliage, and soil. Excavation of these types of recovery sites usually employ the methods of
archaeology and are often very slow, standard S&R operations. If the tactical situation permits, all
recoverable HR and portions of HR should be recovered and evacuated to help ensure ID and proper
repatriation of all individuals involved in the loss.
4-88. Excavation and recovery operations employ several types of strategies, methods, and techniques. Basic
excavation strategies employed on a recovery site must be flexible and adaptable to investigative,
environmental, cultural, and physical challenges. There are two types of excavation strategies: strategy-
discovery and strategy-recovery.
⚫
Strategy-discovery is used when the exact location of remains within a defined perimeter is
unknown. The excavation methods used are usually trenching and large-scale testing.
⚫
Strategy-recovery is used when available information points to a specific location within the
recovery site. The preferred excavation method is block-excavation.
4-89. Teams determine which excavation method to employ within a recovery site by the circumstances of
the loss and relevant information gathered. There are four basic excavation methods: large-scale testing,
trenching, block-excavation, and collection.
⚫
The large-scale testing excavation method consists of excavating alternate same-sized units
throughout the recovery site by the use of a random numbering system. These test pits are usually
50 centimeters (cm) × 50 cm and dug to a depth determined by the team leader or recovery leader.
⚫
The trenching excavation method consists of digging long, linear units parallel to each other.
Teams can examine large areas of the recovery site for soil profiles and material evidence. The
unexcavated areas between rows, or balks, should be uniform in width, usually no more than 50
cm, and be removed from areas where HR or other materials are found.
⚫
Block-excavation is the preferred excavation method and consists of excavating contiguous units
within the recovery site. Dig all units down to a sterile depth. Sterile soil is the soil that is
undisturbed and free of HR, artifacts, or other material evidence.
⚫
The collection excavation method is employed whenever no soil is present and all HR, artifacts,
and material evidence are located on the surface, such as on a rock-slope.
4-90. Teams employ three basic types of excavation techniques on a recovery site: fine-scale, coarse-scale,
and mechanical collection.
⚫
The fine-scale excavation technique consists of the use of hand tools including, but not limited to,
hand trowels, toothbrushes, dental picks, paintbrushes, and bamboo picks. It is usually used when
remains or other material evidence are located and adjacent soil must be removed.
⚫
The coarse-scale excavation technique consists of the use of hand tools such as picks and shovels.
It is the most common technique for excavating recovery sites and is used when teams must
remove and screen large amounts of soil. Teams sometimes combine fine-scale excavation when
HR or soil disturbances exist.
⚫
The mechanical excavation technique consists of the use of mechanical equipment including, but
not limited to, bulldozers, belly scrapers, and front-end loaders. Teams normally employ this
method when it is necessary to remove large amounts of overburden (soil that has been deposited
on top of the recovery site).
4-91. Basic recovery techniques are the methods used to recover HR and other material evidence during
excavations. There are three types of basic recovery techniques: collection, dry-screening, and wet-screening.
⚫
The collection recovery technique is employed when no soil needs to be excavated and all HR,
artifacts, and material are present on the surface, such as on a rock-slope.
⚫
The dry-screening recovery technique is employed when conditions permit the conveyance of
excavated soil to a location outside of the recovery site. The soil is placed into ¼-inch wire meshed
screens in an attempt to locate HR, artifacts, or other material evidence. The soil passes through
Chapter 4 
4-22
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
the screen by shaking or pressing by hand. Place all material evidence in a clear plastic bag. Check 
periodically or prior to closing the unit. 
⚫
The wet-screening recovery technique is employed when conditions will not allow soil to pass
through the screen without assistance. Soil from the recovery site is conveyed to an outside area,
placed in a screen, and water pressure is used to degrade the soil to a point where it will pass
through the screen leaving behind any material evidence and organic matter larger than the
diameter of the wire mesh.
DOCUMENTING THE RECOVERY SITE 
4-92. It is vital to document all aspects of the recovery operation. This documentation provides a spatial and
contextual reference as to where HR, artifacts, and other material evidence are found within the recovery site.
Documenting the recovery operation is done using maps, field notebooks, and photos. Photographs are not
authorized unless the military authority having jurisdiction grants approval for official use only.
4-93. ATP 3-90.15 provides techniques and procedures for documenting sites, detecting, collecting,
analyzing, and disseminating forensic and biometric information.
MAPPING AND RECORDING THE RECOVERY SITE 
4-94. Making accurate maps of every recovery site is essential. GPS technology allows for the most accurate
record of S&R and plotting on a map. A map of the recovery site showing the locations of HR, portions, and
any disassociated personal effects in relation to the datum. This information will be useful for future
excavations and re-creation of the recovery site (see figure 4-9).

Mortuary Affairs Collection Point Operations 
MACPs provide a key service within the sustainment function of logistics. The Army, 
Marines, and Air and Space Forces provide around-the-clock mortuary affairs support 
for the GCC’s mortuary affairs program. This program consists of direct or general 
support for MACP operations in the receiving, establishing chain of custody, and 
evacuating human remains and PE.  
SECTION I –ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
5-1. MACPs may be employed in either a DS or GS role. They require proper placement and
synchronization within theater logistics channels during major combat operations.
5-2. MACPs may support S&R and interment operations, but must maintain sufficient personnel at the
MACP to continue the primary mission of receiving, processing, and evacuating remains to the TMEP. (See
chapter 8 for temporary interment and disinterment operations.)
5-3. The core functions of the MACP are to—
⚫
Provide dignity, honor, reverence, and respect.
⚫
Receive and safeguard HR and PE.
⚫
Initiate or continue chain of custody.
⚫
Establish tentative ID (name association).
⚫
Store and evacuate HR and PE.
⚫
Complete required documentation and initiate MARTS case entry.
5-4. All HR will undergo processing within 4 hours of arrival at the MACP. Augmentation personnel may
be required for handling or moving the remains, but MACP personnel are the only authorized persons to do
the processing. Remains should be evacuated as quickly as possible using air transport (preferred mode of
transport when available) or backhaul convoys to the TMEP. The TMEP is usually located in a secure area
on or near an APOE. Inform the TMAO immediately of any delays in evacuating HR.
FORWARD (DIRECT SUPPORT) MISSION 
5-5. MACPs are designed to be highly mobile, tailorable, and located in forward logistics support areas.
MACPs are established at the consolidated support areas of Army BCTs or Marine air-ground task forces
(MAGTFs) and provide DS for these maneuver elements within their tactical footprint. Forward MACPs
receive and process HR and PE, establish a chain of custody, establish tentative ID, and evacuate to the
nearest MA facility (Main MACP or TMEP) depending on the threat situation.
5-6. The forward MACP will quickly evacuate HR to the main MACP located at the division support area
(DSA), resupply, and return to the forward consolidated support area. The MACP secondary mission is to
conduct deliberate post-combat S&R missions. The appropriate higher HQ generates the tasking for
deliberate post-combat S&R missions when the supported unit has exceeded its capability to safely recover
fatalities. (See chapter 4 for more information on S&R support.)
5-7. MACPs may require augmentation during prolonged conflict, large-scale combat operations, or as the
threat or adversary situation escalates. These MACPs may require additional MA collection teams and
equipment to sustain continuous operations. Additional MA teams will increase throughput capacity and
allow for a larger number of remains to be processed and evacuated, reducing backlog.

ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
MAIN (GENERAL SUPPORT) MISSION 
5-8. Main MACPs provide GS to a given area or major command, are larger, and have a more stable
structure than forward MACPs. Main MACPs serve as evacuation hubs or intermediate collection points for
MACPs that are positioned forward with maneuver elements. These MACPs move with the supported
command logistics base and may be task-organized with increased receiving and processing capability. U.S.
Air and Space Forces Force Support Squadron enlisted personnel with an Air Force Specialty Code 3F1X1
may augment MACP locations that have aerial port capabilities.
5-9. Depending on the evacuation support plan in place and transportation available, HR may have to be
evacuated through several MACPs serving as intermediate transit points before arrival at a TMEP. Although
not staffed to process PE containers, MACPs can be used as a transfer point to account for received PE
containers (not individual items of PE). When not employed, MA teams may conduct or assist in limited
temporary interment operations, even though not specifically designed or resourced for this function. The
GCC, through the JMAO, is the approving authority for interment operations. (See chapter 8 for information
on temporary interment operations.)
SECTION II – PLANNING, CAPABILITY, AND CAPACITY 
5-10. The employment of MACPs depends on the GCC’s MA program for the AOR. The JMAO provides
recommendations for the development and implementation of the combatant commander’s MA plan. The
JMAO also prepares the MA annex that recommends the Service that has sufficient resources for the mission
in the AOR. Depending on the available support infrastructure, the Service operating the MACPs will rely
on the guidance issued from the TMAO as they converge through the reception, staging, onward-movement,
and integration in the theater.
MORTUARY AFFAIRS COLLECTION POINT CAPABILITIES 
5-11. Most military Services are required to maintain an organizational MACP capability to support their
individual Service needs:
⚫
The Army has two Active Component (AC) and six Reserve Component (RC) MA companies.
Each company has MA platoons with MACP capability:
▪
Each Army MA platoon consists of four MA collection teams.
▪
Each MA collection team consists of six MA personnel, military operational specialty (MOS)
92M, resourced to provide DS or GS support to logistics commands supporting maneuver
elements.
▪
See chapter 9 for more details on Army capabilities.
⚫
The Marine Corps maintains an RC MA capability with its PRP company. Once activated, the
PRP company can establish an MACP and conduct S&R support for a Marine expeditionary force
or MAGTF:
▪
The PRP company maintains four operational platoons with three squads in each platoon.
▪
The PRP company contains Marine Corps MOS 0471 personnel to provide DS or GS MA
support to a Marine expeditionary force.
▪
See chapter 10 for more specifics on the Marine Corps MACP capability.
⚫
Air Force MACP capability is limited based on mission requirements:
▪
It may augment theater MACPs in a GS role.
▪
Air Force MA capabilities include 3F1X1 personnel working in both the USAF and the U.S.
Space Force.
▪
See chapter 12 for more information on USAF capabilities.
⚫
The Navy does not have an MACP capability. (See chapter 11 for details on Navy MA
capabilities.)
5-12. Assigned and available resources determine each Service’s ability to establish MACPs. A MACP is
composed of at least six MA personnel and has three basic sections: receiving, processing, and evacuation.
Mortuary Affairs Collection Point Operations 
03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
5-3
During large-scale combat operations, the minimum personnel requirement doubles to 12 MA personnel. 
Each MACP should be staffed, equipped, and trained to support theater MA operations based on GCC or 
Service-level MA requirements. 
5-13. HR processing capabilities also vary between Services. Many factors will affect MACP design and
processing throughput, including factors affecting the morale and well-being of MACP personnel. (See
appendix A for more information on physical and mental well-being of MA specialists.)
5-14. Some factors for commanders to consider when planning for MACP operations are—
⚫
Size of supported operational forces.
⚫
Number of required MACPs for the operational area.
⚫
Number of required MA personnel to staff MACPs.
⚫
Fatality estimates.
⚫
MACP processing time per HR (2 hours per HR).
⚫
Total number of remains processed per day (up to 20 HR per 24-hour period).
⚫
Processing throughput reductions due to available manpower and resources.
⚫
Storage capacity at each MACP.
SITE SELECTION 
5-15. MACP site selection depends on the type of support mission performed and available MACP structure.
A MACP structured to provide DS to a forward maneuver element will be located within the brigade support
area (BSA) and requires protection while processing and evacuating remains. Depending on the situation and
threat level, an MACP may operate out of a Mobile Integrated Remains Collection System (MIRCS). A site
selection plan should choose a site that restricts access and view of MA operations, considers area camouflage
requirements, and provides cover for protection. The main MACP (GS) will follow the same guidelines as
the DS MACP, but will provide additional support to increase evacuation capabilities.
5-16. Commanders should consider the following when selecting a DS MACP site:
⚫
Integrated with supported unit protection assets.
⚫
Provides adequate space to setup a MIRCS with additional space for overflow shelter tents.
⚫
Close to a main supply route to facilitate delivery and evacuation.
⚫
Easily recognizable to combat units.
⚫
Close in proximity to life support, personnel services, and medical treatment facilities, but out of
sight of medical treatment, and morale, welfare, and recreation facilities.
⚫
Away from any water sources, shower and laundry facilities, dining facilities, and if possible,
downwind from living areas.
5-17. In addition to the DS MACP considerations, the GS MACP site selection should be based upon the
following:
⚫
Large enough for anticipated needs and future expansion.
⚫
Structured to support the forward MACPs and the higher-echelon command in the vicinity.
⚫
Ability to build a road network on site or use an existing road network.
⚫
Ability to build a helipad on site or use an existing helipad, landing strip, or airport.
⚫
Proximity to engineer support for construction or maintenance of a road network and helipad.
⚫
Proximity to a landing strip, airport, or helipad (if available).
⚫
Away from banks of streams, rock formations, swampy lands, and dwellings.
⚫
Adequate drainage.
⚫
Proximity to tactical communications support with internet access (for radio, combat service
support automated information systems interface, and MARTS).
⚫
Ability to write data to radio frequency identification (RFID) tags or other approved advanced
information technology devices.
⚫
Ability to utilize natural screening or screening material.

5-4
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
⚫
Potential to utilize the terrain as a temporary interment site.
⚫
Ability to accommodate additional refrigerated storage, mobile refrigeration containers, or trucks.
PRIORITIES OF WORK 
5-18. The MACP noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) is responsible for initiating MACP
operations. After arriving and establishing the MACP at a new location, the NCOIC will notify both the
supported unit and the MA higher HQ once the MACP is ready to receive HR.
5-19. The NCOIC is responsible for ensuring completion of the following MACP priorities of work:
⚫
Establish site security.
⚫
Establish communication.
⚫
Coordinate administrative, life, personnel, and medical support.
⚫
Establish a habitual transportation link (for example, transport remains from the medical treatment
facility to the TMEP).
⚫
Establish or create signs to identify the MA facility.
⚫
Coordinate engineer support for road network preparation and other mission requirements.
⚫
Prepare refrigeration and remains shelter (overflow).
⚫
Construct munitions holding area per EOD guidance.
⚫
Ensure shielding of MA facilities from public view using latrine screen, overhead camouflage
screening materials, or fence with canvas attached for privacy.
⚫
Establish work rest cycles for personnel that facilitate 24-hour operations.
⚫
Prepare to receive HR.
RESTRICTED ACCESS TO MORTUARY AFFAIRS FACILITIES 
5-20. Access restrictions to MACPs should be included in theater MA support plans and standard operating
procedures and circulated to all supported ground forces in the MACP operational area. Closely monitor
reporters and media embedded with fighting forces or in close proximity to MA facilities to prevent
unauthorized photography of HR. This also includes unauthorized photography using any other electronic
device, including cell phones.
5-21. Refer media questions regarding DOD S&R efforts or any other fatality inquiries to the CCMD public
affairs officer. Send all Service component news releases and samples of media coverage to the CCMD public
affairs for review.
PROTOCOLS 
5-22. MA personnel perform a delicate mission in caring for the HR of DOD and affiliated persons during
military operations. Commanders at all levels established protective measures for MACP site security and
access control. All MA facilities should maintain appropriate protocols and an official access roster to prevent
unauthorized personnel from disclosing sensitive details. Access to MACP facilities is normally limited to—
⚫
Unit personnel escorting HR to the MACP for processing.
⚫
Medical personnel supporting MACP operations and personnel.
⚫
Law enforcement agencies performing investigative duties.
⚫
PE inventory officer while delivering PE for shipment to the Joint Personal Effects Depot (JPED).
⚫
Religious support team (RST)/religious ministry team (RMT) offering appropriate religious
ministry support.
⚫
Behavioral health personnel providing support to MA personnel.
⚫
MACP direct chain of command (limited to administrative area) while processing HR.
⚫
Other authorized personnel designated by the theater sustainment command or TMAO.
⚫
Personnel authorized for HR transfer to the International Committee of the Red Cross or
equivalent.

5-5
5-23. MACPs will follow the required protocols listed below while conducting operations:
⚫
Operate 24 hours per day, seven days a week to process fatalities for evacuation.
⚫
Observe dignity, reverence, and respect at all times in vicinity of the MACP.
⚫
Implement and enforce strict access restrictions. Only personnel that conduct business with the
MACP are permitted, which ensures privacy and respect for the deceased. The MACP will
generate a specific list of authorized personnel.
⚫
Require visitors (any personnel not assigned to the MACP) to complete an entry on the MACP or
TMEP access log with their printed name, Department of Defense identification (DOD ID)
number, unit of assignment, date of visit, time entered, reason for visit, and signature as a record
of personnel access to the MACP.
⚫
Prohibit photography of any kind (including electronic devices) in and around the MACP, unless
authorized by the AFMES, a military criminal investigative organization, or federal investigative
agency with jurisdiction.
⚫
Implement a no hat, no salute area within vicinity of the MACP location due to possible health
and cleanliness incident risks for biohazard, work interruption, and respect for the deceased inside
the MACP.
⚫
Enforce covering or shrouding of HR at all times when outside of refrigeration, especially when
there is no processing taking place or HR is awaiting evacuation.
⚫
Ensure every effort is made, when time and personnel are available, to assist personnel responsible
for the PE inventory, in-theater SCMO or SCO duties, or turning in personal property to MACP.
⚫
Prohibit access of reporters and media in and around the MACP and contact the command public
affairs office for additional guidance.
⚫
Prohibit MA personnel from retrieving fatalities from the medical treatment facility except when
no other means of transportation is available and the MACP has no HR on hand.
⚫
Ensure all MA facilities have required internet and voice communications for processing fatalities
in MARTS and coordinating evacuation of HR.
⚫
Shield MACP from public view to protect morale, prevent unnecessary interruptions during
processing, and show respect for the deceased.
FORWARD LAYOUT (DIRECT SUPPORT) 
5-24. A MACP is composed of three basic sections: receiving, processing, and evacuation. The facility
layout is based upon the type of structure used and the support mission. Forward MACPs will have
refrigeration capabilities available to slow decomposition for the HR on hand.
5-25. The movement of the supported unit affects the MACP’s ability to establish a temporary facility. The
MACP layout must be flexible and based on the current tactical situation. This flexibility allows the MACP
to operate from a MIRCS, a refrigeration container, the back of a vehicle, inside a frame or modular tent, or
even a designated area on the ground. The MACP may be in a remote area and not always in the same forward
area as the supported maneuver units.
5-26. A forward MACP may not have the time or support required to conduct full standard processing
operations. If this is the case, the MACP transitions to processing the HR with minimal procedures and
evacuating to the TMEP. This would most likely be the case for large-scale combat operations.
MAIN LAYOUT (GENERAL SUPPORT) 
5-27. Main MACP operations are larger scale than forward MACP operations, with additional personnel,
MA supplies, and equipment available to accomplish normal processing procedures.
5-28. Once the site selection is complete, the MACP should—
⚫
Tailor the facility layout to blend in with the geographic and manmade features of the area.
⚫
Construct a perimeter to prevent unauthorized personnel, including news media, from entering the
area.

signs to reduce congestion and confusion associated with heavy traffic flow.
⚫
Erect screening material at the earliest possible moment to prevent the operations of the MACP
from being viewed by the public.
⚫
Arrange engineer support to establish or improve a road network and perimeter for the point.
⚫
Coordinate engineer support to construct a helipad near the MACP if one does not already exist.
⚫
Establish separate areas within the MA facility for each section (receiving, processing, and
evacuation) to avoid confusion.
MOBILE INTEGRATED REMAINS COLLECTION SYSTEM 
5-29. The MACP may operate out of a MIRCS. These refrigerated containers are used for processing,
conditioning, and storing remains (see figures 5-1 and 5-2). Currently, Army MA companies assign each MA
collection team with this equipment (see chapter 9 for more information). The Marine Corps PRP company
has begun the MIRCS acquisition process. Future Marine Corps operations may utilize this system.
5-30. The MIRCS has a footprint of approximately 6,219 cubic feet, a 1-hour setup and 1-hour tear down
time, and provides all terrain mobility. The MIRCS is a self-contained, soft shelter canvas, expandable unit
housed within an International Organization for Standardization container frame. This container is an
intermodal container that is manufactured according to the specifications outlined by the International
Organization for Standardization. These containers are suitable for ship, rail, and truck and can be used in a
mobile or stationary capacity.
5-31. For planning purposes, the MIRCS has provisions to condition 15 intact HR in refrigerated storage.
During transport, the 5kW refrigeration generator maintains an optimal temperature for transport.
Note 1. Does not provide necessary cover. The MIRCS has administrative and processing area 
platforms whose soft walls provide no protection from direct or indirect fire. 
Note 2. Provides no protection from a CBRN exposure. Its soft walls make decontamination of 
the system impossible. 
5-32. The MIRCS contains a 5-kilowat (kW) refrigeration unit to condition stored HR. An integrated diesel
engine powers the refrigeration unit. An onboard fuel tank supplies JP-8 fuel for the engine.
5-33. There is also a 15-kW advanced medium mobile power sources generator set, MEP-1050, which is a
self-contained, skid mounted, portable unit. It is equipped with controls, instruments, and accessories
necessary for operation. The generator set consists of a diesel engine, brushless generator, excitation system,
speed governing system, fuel system, 24 VDC starting system, control system, and fault system. The
generator set can be used with any equipment requiring a medium source of alternating-current power. An
external electrical source or the on-board 15-kW, MEP-804B or MEP-1050 can power the refrigeration unit.
The generator set also supplies power to the MIRCS environmental control unit, on-board lighting, and water
supply systems.
5-34. The MIRCS is capable of continuous HR storage in the transportation mode and MA processing
operations on ground and at trailer level. The MIRCS is transported with a heavy expanded mobile tactical
truck with load handling system. The MIRCS was designed with the capability to store up to 16 HR in
refrigeration, but the refrigerated storage unit compartment on the top right tray is obstructed by the
refrigeration unit and cannot fit an intact HR with combat gear. The obstructed compartment is typically used
for smaller items such as portions, disassociated personal effects, or forensic evidence being preserved for
the AFMES forensic examination.

5-35. When refrigerating HR—
⚫
Maintain temperature in the refrigeration unit between 34 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit or 1.1 to 4.4
degrees Celsius to prevent freezing or advance decomposition.
⚫
Ensure evaporative fan-coil unit is not overflowing and not dripping water on the floor.
⚫
Keep temperature gauge clean and visible.
⚫
Follow sanitation guidelines outlined in TG 195A.
⚫
Conduct preventive maintenance checks and services IAW TM 10-4110-263-10.
5-36. The environmentally controlled system can operate in extreme temperatures. Air changes 12 times per
hour in the work areas to protect personnel from airborne pathogens. An on-board 15-kW generator provides
power to run all onboard systems. An onboard fuel tank allows for self-sustaining operations for 24 to 72
hours. The MIRCS and its associated equipment provide a more sanitary environment for MA teams.
5-37. The MIRCS provides running hot and cold water, pumped from external sources, for use in sanitizing
personnel and equipment. The system has the capability to store wastewater in four 10-gallon bio-waste
containers. The MACP should coordinate with the supported logistics command MA NCO to properly
dispose of biohazard wastewater with operational public health or preventive medicine. The system includes
four separate, unrefrigerated, external, collapsible temporary HR holding shelters that provide an overflow
capacity of 24 hours (see figure 5-3). These shelters can protect HR from the elements as they await
processing or evacuation, but does not offer refrigeration.
5-38. Dependent on the availability of evacuation and refrigeration assets, place a higher priority on
evacuation. For preservation purposes, refrigerate HR awaiting processing or the arrival of evacuation assets.

SECTION III – MORTUARY AFFAIRS COLLECTION POINT PROCEDURES 
5-47. This section describes the procedures used within the different sections of the MACP. It also
establishes protocols that are consistent with processing remains in the theater as specified by the AFMES.
5-48. Handling or working around HR in various stages of decomposition requires enforcement of strict
health and sanitation procedures to ensure the safety of all personnel involved. The potential for infection
and the spread of contagious disease is always present.
5-49. MACP personnel handling HR or other personnel working in areas where HR have been, should always
be aware of sanitation hazards and keep themselves and their work areas clean. Personnel should wear PPE
described in table 4-1 on page 4-5.
5-50. MACPs are not resourced to pick up remains from any medical treatment facility (MTF) or unit areas.
Coordination should be made through logistics channels to secure covered vehicle transportation to the
nearest MACP. The MTFs will coordinate with their assigned logistics assets for the movement of deceased
personnel from the MTF to the MACP. Medical evacuation vehicles will not be used to evacuate HR to the
MACP.
5-51. The use of computers, when available at the MACP, will help expedite processing of HR throughout
the theater using MARTS. Recommend preparing blank case files (for example, forms, security seals, blank
manila tags, and slide closure bags for PE) for rapid processing. Prefabricated case files will ensure original
and duplicate case files are prepared and ready to prevent unnecessary delays. Initiate original and duplicate
case files in the event MARTS automated files cannot be accessed. MACP personnel will always be in the
appropriate PPE when handling, processing, and evacuating HR.
RECEIVING SECTION 
5-52. MACP receiving personnel will—
⚫
Inspect all HR and PE for UXO, IED, and other hazardous items immediately prior to entering the
receiving area. MACP receiving personnel must verify these steps.
Mortuary Affairs Collection Point Operations 
03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
5-13
⚫
Notify EOD personnel immediately if there are any UXO items found. Cease all processing until
the HR are cleared. For their safety, MACP personnel should take further instructions from EOD
personnel.
⚫
Confirm the actual number of HR being delivered. The HR should come with only the PE found
on the HR and basic information to begin establishing chain of custody.
⚫
Check the HR for recovery tags, DD Form 1380, and any other accompanying paperwork. If
recovery tags or DD Form 1380 are present, remove and place in the case file folder. If no
information is available, do what is necessary to obtain the missing information. Do not delay
processing and evacuation for lack of information.
DANGER RECEIVING AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES 
Be aware of any items brought into the MACP receiving area, as 
part of an HR fighting load may appear undamaged but still pose a 
threat due to potential heat and impact damage sustained as part 
of the fatality-producing incident. 
⚫
Initiate an original and duplicate case file. The top portion of the file should have believed to be
name, rank, last four digits of the Social Security number (SSN) or DOD ID number, seal number,
and evacuation number. Store the duplicate case file at the MACP as a quick reference for
questions about HR transitioning through the MACP.
⚫
Initiate a case file in MARTS by accepting the HR into the system. Prepare all MA documents in
MARTS if available. If MARTS is not operational, follow the guidance for preparation of paper
forms. (See appendix C in this publication for information on completing hard copy paper forms.)
⚫
Annotate required information on DD Form 1077 for all unidentified, believed to be HR, and
portions of HR received at the MACP. Obtain this information from the transport driver, S&R
team leader, or DD Form 567:
▪
The DD Form 1077 is a daily log of HR received at the MACP, whether unidentified, believed
to be, or portions.
▪
Prepare a new register each day the MACP is in operation. The reporting period starts at 0001
and ends at 2400 (local time).
▪
Retain a copy of all registers at the MACP for internal records until that MACP is required to
archive records, per direction of the JMAO.
▪
Upon arrival of HR, MACP personnel record all required information on DD Form 1077.
Confirm the actual number of HR delivered.
5-53. If no documents accompany the HR, gather information to annotate on DD Form 565. The MACP
personnel will—
⚫
Interview the unit representative and complete the information on the DD Form 565.
⚫
Conduct the interview away from the deceased, and then allow the person to visually identify the
deceased.
⚫
Ensure the original accompanies the HR. Retain a copy in the MACP case file.
BUILDING AN EVACUATION NUMBER 
5-54. Assign an evacuation number to the HR. See figure 5-5 on page 5-14 for the components of an
evacuation number and sample evacuation tag.
5-55. Complete two evacuation tags for each believed to be HR:
⚫
Front side—Record the last name, first name, middle initial, and the DOD ID number or last four
digits of the SSN.
⚫
Reverse side—Record the evacuation and security seal numbers:
⚫
Attach one tag to the HR.

⚫
Attach the second tag to the HRP.
5-56. Evacuation numbers are sequentially issued in MARTS or created manually based on the evacuation
item received (HR or PE). When manually building an evacuation tag, place a letter before the sequential
number to identify the type of evacuation item:
⚫
R: represents believed to be or unidentified HR.
⚫
P: represents a portion of HR.
⚫
E: represents PE and disassociated personal effects.
⚫
T: represents transfer of items through an additional MACP during the current calendar year.
Note: The following rules apply. The receiving MACP will not assign a new evacuation number 
when receiving a transfer item. The receiving MACP will receive the item and evacuate the item 
utilizing the current evacuation number. Place a T before the evacuation number on DD Form 
1077 to designate that it is a transfer item from another MACP to avoid double counting the item. 
Figure 5-5. Evacuation tag for human remains 
5-57. For unidentified HR—
⚫
Front side of evacuation tag: Write “UNIDENTIFIED” (see figure 5-6).
⚫
Reverse side: Record the HR evacuation number. The number should match the information on
DD Form 1077.
⚫
Below the evacuation number, annotate the number from seal on the HRP:
▪
Attach one tag to the HR.
▪
Attach the second tag to the HRP.

Figure 5-6. Sample of unidentified evacuation tag 
5-58. When MACP personnel receive portions of HR, the evacuation tag is completed as follows:
⚫
Per the AFMES guidance, portions recovered from the same general location should not be
individually bagged, unless instructed to do so by an AFMES official. The recovery location is
critical for each portion to an investigation. Maintain anatomical integrity of all HR and portions
whenever possible.
⚫
In the case of skeletal remains, consolidate all skeletal remains found in concentration in the same
bag, as to preserve provenience of the skeletal assemblage. Place the HR, portions, or skeletal
remains in an HRP for evacuation.
⚫
Annotate “PORTIONS” on one side of the tag. Beneath “PORTIONS” annotate the sequential P
number of portions.
⚫
Complete the reverse side in the same manner as an HR tag.
⚫
When portions recovered are from the same incident site, do not individually bag each portion,
place all the portions into as few clear plastic bags as possible within an HRP. Each individual bag
will be tagged; do not attempt to associate any portions. All positive ID will be done with the
AFMES at the Dover port mortuary. Information for each portion is critical to the forensic
investigation.
⚫
Ensure the HRP has an evacuation tag on the front, annotated with the word “PORTIONS”.
Beneath that, annotate the total number of portions inside the HRP as shown in figure 5-7.
⚫
Bag portions recovered from geographically or incidentally distinct areas separately.
⚫
Place HRPs with tagged and sealed portions inside a second HRP to consolidate them for transport.
This means there would be a second protective HRP, into which the first sealed HRP containing
the packaged portions would be placed.
⚫
The evacuation tag would be marked on the front “PORTIONS”, and beneath it, the total number
of portions contained in the HRP from both internal pouches. The back of the tag is completed the
same as for portions (see figure 5-7 on page 5-16).
Note. An R number will be assigned to any item found that constitutes more than 50 percent of a 
human body and includes a majority of the torso. The team leader will make this determination. 
Classify items not representing more than 50 percent as a portion and the item will receive a 
sequential P number. A torso will be marked as HR. Body regions such as an isolated head or legs, 
even if attached at the pelvis, will be marked as portions.

Figure 5-7. Sample of portions of human remains evacuation tag 
DO NOT PHYSICALLY ASSOCIATE ANY PORTIONS 
WITH HUMAN REMAINS 
A HRP can contain unidentified HR, believed to be HR, or portions of 
HR. Comingling of these categories in an HRP is not authorized. For 
example:  
A HRP may not contain both a believed to be HR and portions. 
A HRP may not contain both an unidentified HR and portions.  
A HRP may not contain both an unidentified HR and a believed to be 
human remains. 
PROCESSING DISASSOCIATED PERSONAL EFFECTS 
5-59. When receiving disassociated personal effects at an MACP, do not attempt to associate them with any
particular HR. Request a memorandum for record (with contact information) from the person delivering the
disassociated personal effects containing as much detail as possible about the recovery. The information in
the memorandum will be critical for the JPED SCMO to potentially associate an item to a particular HR.
Maintain item integrity during transit (for example, if a backpack arrives at the MACP, return all items within
the backpack. Then, place the items into a plastic bag with a slide interlocking seal or biohazard bag to
prevent comingling with other PE). When receiving disassociated personal effects, MACP personnel will—
⚫
Open a file in MARTS for the disassociated personal effects. Create a file using the DD Form
1076.
⚫
Generate two disassociated personal effects tags (see figure 5-8):
▪
Front side—Write the words “DISASSOCIATED PERSONAL EFFECTS” and assign a
sequential E number.
▪
Backside: Record the evacuation and security seal numbers.
⚫
Place the disassociated personal effects with one copy of the DD Form 1076 and the tag in a plastic
bag with slide interlocking seal. If there are multiple disassociated personal effects items from an
incident site, each piece of disassociated PE will have an E-number (for example, E-1 of 2, E-2 of
2):

03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
5-17
▪
For transportation to the AFMES, store in one or more PE bags (depending on the size of the
PE) or an opaque plastic bag, as needed.
▪
Place the other tag on the PE bag.
⚫
The disassociated personal effects will have their own evacuation number. The disassociated
personal effects are treated as a separate item when evacuating with other HR from the MACP.
⚫
Retain a copy of the DD Form 1076 at the MACP as a file copy in the case file.
⚫
Manually record the item on the DD Form 1077, ensure the evacuation number matches the
disassociated personal effects tag for that item.
Figure 5-8. Sample of disassociated personal effects evacuation tag 
5-60. Based on the workload, move the HR and PE to the processing area. If a backlog is keeping the HR
from further processing, move the HR to a refrigerated holding area. Once the backlog is gone, retrieve the
HR from the holding area and move to the processing area to continue processing.
PROCESSING SECTION 
5-61. MACP normal processing includes the following procedures:
⚫
Continue to check for any ammunition, explosives, weapons, or classified material:
▪
Return unused ammunition, explosives, and weapons to unit.
▪
Turn in classified material to the unit intelligence or operations section for disposition.
⚫
Keep the HR covered or shrouded when not undergoing processing.
⚫
Examine the state of the HR to ensure they are intact:
▪
Check to see if there are any recovery tags for HR or portions.
▪
If HR are missing major portions, ensure there is documentation from the unit recovery team
that they searched for the missing portions.
▪
If there is insufficient documentation for the missing major portions, attempt to contact the
unit for a report.
▪
After exhausting all attempts to recover major missing portions, generate a memorandum
certificate of non-recoverability of missing major portions. Include this in the case file (see
appendix C for a sample memorandum.)
Note. Do not delay the evacuation of the recovered HR to search for missing portions.

5-18
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
▪
If any information on the missing portions is received after the evacuation of the recovered
HR, prepare a message stating all pertinent information and forward through higher HQ to
the TMAO and JMAO.
⚫
Examine all documents accompanying the HR received in the MACP case file for:
▪
DD Form 1380 (Tactical Combat Casualty Care Card).
▪
SF 600 (Chronological Record of Medical Care).
▪
DD Form 2064 (Certificate of Death Overseas). Certified medical authority will pronounce
death and complete DD Form 2064 or other appropriate documents for transport of the HR
back to a designated military mortuary. On the death certificate, list the cause of death as
Pending Armed Forces Medical Examiner Determination.
⚫
Update the deceased individual case file folder with any documents received.
⚫
Continue the automated processing of the MARTS file using the HR and PE data.
⚫
Complete any missing information on the DD Form 1077.
⚫
Prepare evacuation tags according to believed to be HR, unidentified, or portions (if not created
in the receiving section).
⚫
Attach evacuation tag to the HR wrist or another extremity (if not already attached).
⚫
Place the HR in an HRP.
⚫
Store HR awaiting further processing or transportation in a refrigerated container when space is
available and no processing is taking place.
⚫
Document the inventory of PE on DD Form 1076:
▪
Maintain two-person control while conducting a PE inventory and establishing chain of
custody.
▪
Identify, inspect, and record all official military and personal ID media, personal clothing,
and personal items on DD Form 1076.
▪
Search all personal equipment, clothing, pockets, and the areas around the neck, wrists, and
fingers for PE.
▪
Minimize handling of PE to preserve physical and biological evidence. Exercise care not to
contaminate or destroy any forensic evidence.
▪
Take care when checking items in pockets to record the contents found.
▪
Leave all items found on remains in place, even if the item is protruding from the remains
(for example, medical equipment or shrapnel), as these items are a part of the forensic
examination and not recorded as PE on the DD Form 1076.
▪
Use official ID media found as a basis for establishing tentative ID.
▪
Leave all ID media, PE, clothing, and organizational equipment worn on the HR for forensic
analysis by the AFMES.
▪
Secure all loose PE found on remains and place in a clear sealed zip-closure bag along with a
copy of the DD Form 1076.
Note. To prevent bodily fluids from damaging the PE, place the clear sealed zip-closure bag inside 
a PE bag. Secure the PE bag to the wrist of the HR. 
▪
Remove only sensitive items and other organizational unit property and equipment not worn
on the HR and keep it segregated from the PE.
▪
Forward all serviceable organizational equipment to the appropriate supply activity or the unit
concerned, if available, and obtain a hand receipt for the items.
Note. If the remains arrive at the MACP without any combat gear, ensure to contact the unit or the 
MTF that cared for the deceased. AFMES insists that the helmet and body armor (combat gear) is 
included as a part of the forensic examination.

⚫
Attach an evacuation tag to the outside zipper of the HRP.
⚫
Annotate information from numbered security seal on evacuation tags and case file documents
before placing numbered metal security seal inside the case file.
⚫
Place the HR in the refrigeration container while awaiting transportation.
⚫
Inspect original case file that will travel with the deceased to the TMEP.
⚫
Prepare a duplicate case file to keep at the MACP until determination of further disposition by the
TMAO or JMAO for archiving.
⚫
Verify forms in the case file (original case file accompanies the HR):
▪
DD Form 565 (prepare an original for the original case file and a copy for the MACP file) if
possible.
▪
DD Form 567 (if MA personnel performed the S&R mission).
▪
Any recovery site sketch, map overlay, or information on deceased’s recovery.
▪
DD Form 1074 (if MA personnel performed the recovery and if applicable).
▪
DD Form 1076 (ensure there are three copies).
▪
DD Form 1380 and SF 600 (if provided to the MACP by the MTF or unit), if available.
▪
DD Form 2064 (provided by the MTF).
5-62. In cases when neither the DD Form 2064, DD Form 1380, nor SF 600 documents are present, attempt
to coordinate with a medical officer to complete a certificate of death, if feasible. Do not delay the evacuation
of HR to obtain a certificate of death.
5-63. When using a transfer case, complete the following:
⚫
Secure metal security seals to HRP, head, and foot of transfer case.
⚫
Place the original case file inside a clear sealed zip-closure bag and lay it in the documents drawer
(if using an IHRTC).
⚫
Retain a duplicate case file at the MACP.
5-64. Normal processing at an MACP is dependent on workload, available MA personnel and equipment,
and operational constraints. The MACP will comply with the theater standard operating procedures and the
GCC regulation or memorandum of instruction for MA. GCC and Service component operational orders will
identify support available to evacuate remains from theater.
STORAGE/EVACUATION SECTION 
5-65. If possible, keep HR awaiting evacuation in refrigeration. Maintain the temperature of the refrigeration
container between 34–40 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1–4.4 degrees Celsius). Holding HR in a refrigeration
container will slow decomposition. Do not allow HR to freeze under any circumstances. Ensure the
temperature is monitored at periodic intervals. Additionally, perform the required maintenance checks and
services as prescribed in the applicable technical manual.
5-66. When possible, use RFID tags or other available automated identification at the MACP to track HR
and PE. Using RFID for in-transit visibility will provide better accountability of HR and PE. The MA
personnel in the storage and evacuation sections will following these procedures:
⚫
Prepare the required information and input into MARTS to include tracking information such as
a barcode tag or RFID tag prior to loading and evacuation of HR and PE.
⚫
Write and activate RFID tags prior to evacuation using the appropriate equipment.
⚫
Coordinate with higher HQ for transportation to evacuate the HR. When using vehicles, ensure
they have a covered cargo area. Utilize aircraft as the preferred mode of transportation for
evacuating HR, when possible.
⚫
Coordinate with SPO for movement of HR in the tactical area utilizing normal distribution
backhaul from the CCP to the MACP, when possible.
5-67. MACP evacuation personnel will perform the following procedures:

⚫
Use the first received/first evacuated process when coordinating for the arrival of transportation
assets.
⚫
Secure the case file with all pertinent documents for evacuation.
⚫
Coordinate transportation assets through the supported logistics unit’s MA NCO:
▪
If HRTCs or IHRTCs are available, ensure the transfer cases are sanitized and record the
transfer case numbers in the case files and MARTS.
▪
Coordinate for ice support through the supported unit logistics officer (S4) or the logistics
supply operations.
▪
To assist with preservation, place 7 bags of crushed wet ice (approximately 9 to 10 pounds
[lbs.] each) on the bottom tray of the transfer case. Two additional bags of crushed wet ice
are placed on top of the HRP once the remains are placed in the transfer case. Double or triple
bag the ice to prevent condensation.
▪
Use approximately 60 to 90 lbs. of crushed wet ice. Ensure bagged ice does not come into
direct contact with the HR per the AFMES guidance.
▪
Place the ice inside the transfer case (see chapter 6 for the recommended placement of ice).
▪
Complete the Mortuary Affairs Evacuation Ice Worksheet MACP entries, including the
departure temperature as indicated on the transfer case temperature gauge, upon loading the
transfer vehicle.
▪
Place the HRP with the remains zipped up at the head inside the transfer case according to the
label (head and foot). See chapter 6 for instructions on securing an HR inside a transfer case.
⚫
Ensure the transport operator is a DOD-affiliated military, civilian, or contractor authorized to
transport HR onboard:
▪
Ground transportation—Ensure use of a covered vehicle (for example, military cargo vehicle
or commercial box truck).
▪
Air transport (rotary wing)—Load the HR with the head towards the tail of the aircraft.
▪
Air transport (fixed wing)—Load the HR with the head towards the nose of the aircraft.
⚫
Initiate a DD Form 1075. List all the HR being evacuated from the MACP at the same time on the
same DD Form 1075 if space is available. (See appendix C for form instructions.)
⚫
Load the HR on the covered transport vehicle. Ensure HR are handled with dignity, reverence,
and respect at all times when loading HR onto a covered vehicle. Always carry HR feet first and
face up. Position the HR in such a manner as to prevent stacking. Secure the HR in such a manner
as to prevent shifting during transport.
⚫
Ensure the driver signs a DD Form 1075 listing all the HR on their vehicle.
⚫
Give the original signed copy of DD Form 1075 to the driver. Maintain a duplicate copy at the
MACP for internal records. Annotate the evacuation location for the HR on the appropriate DD
Form 1077.
⚫
Ensure all documents in the deceased case file are uploaded to MARTS as a permanent historical
record.
MINIMUM PROCESSING 
5-68. This occurs during large-scale combat operations or mass fatality incidents when the MACP exceeds
its capability and capacity to perform standard processing of HR. The NCOIC will contact the TMAO for
authorization to conduct minimum processing for rapid evacuation. If the MACP has no communications
with the TMAO, the MACP NCOIC may request authorization from the local commander on the ground to
switch to minimum processing but must continue to try and relay this information to the TMEP and TMAO.
5-69. No DD Form 1076 will be completed during minimum processing since the priority will be to record
tentative ID media (SSN or DOD ID number) for a rapid evacuation on DD Forms 1075 and 1077. Relay this
information to the TMEP, and the TMAO will issue further guidance if the DD Form 1076 is required.
5-70. The MACP minimum processing procedures are as follows:
⚫
Search remains for any ID media (for example, common access card, driver license, or ID tags).

5-21
⚫
Remove any ammunition, explosives, and weapons from HR.
⚫
Create an evacuation tag number with remains believed to be information.
⚫
Create an individual deceased case file that travels with the HR. Label the top portion of the file
with the believed to be name, rank, last four SSN or DOD ID number (if available), metal security
seal number for HRP, and evacuation number.
⚫
Complete a DD Form 565, (only if situation permits and a unit member is present to sign the form).
⚫
Complete DD Form 1077 for an MACP permanent record.
⚫
Complete DD Form 1075 for evacuation and create a duplicate copy for the MACP.
⚫
Forward any documents accompanying the remains in the case file to travel to the TMEP:
▪
Check for recovery tags.
▪
Check for DD Form 1380.
▪
Check for DD Form 2064 (signed by a medical authority).
▪
Check for SF 600.
▪
Place HR in an HRP (if not already in one) with PE bag (if required).
⚫
Attach an evacuation tag to the outside zipper of the HRP.
⚫
Place the case file with all documents inside a slide interlocking sealed plastic bag for evacuation
with the HR. Secure this plastic bag inside the HRP, awaiting evacuation.
⚫
Place the HR in the refrigeration container while awaiting transportation (omit this step if ready
to evacuate).
⚫
Load the HR on the transportation vehicle for evacuation.
⚫
Obtain the driver signature on DD Form 1075. Retain a copy for MACP permanent record.
⚫
Upon arrival at the TMEP, remains will be processed using standard procedures using MARTS
unless situation does not allow before evacuation.
5-71. Refer to figure 5-9 for a pictorial layout of MACPs in the AO. (See FM 1-02.1 and FM 1-02.2 for
additional information on operational terms and military symbols.)

DISPOSITION OF FILES 
5-72. The JMAO and TMAO establish MACP locations in theater to support the JOA. As MA teams rotate,
the teams must exchange information and review the MACP and TMAO standard operating procedures
(SOPs) as a part of the incoming MA team’s integration into the theater. In order for the outgoing team to
redeploy, the incoming team and associated equipment must be in place and ready to assume responsibility
for the mission. All MACP files will also transfer to the new MA team in accordance with the TMAO SOP.
The TMAO will notify the JMAO when the relief in place occurs with a new MA team.
5-73. As the JMAO closes MACP locations within the theater, forward the MACP case files to the TMAO
for disposition. The original case file travels with the deceased inside the transfer case to the AFMES for
final disposition. Contact the TMAO for guidance on case files for HR that have a destination other than
AFMES. Upon deactivation of the MACP, the files are transferred to the TMAO for forwarding to the GCC
JMAO for archiving. Once the TMAO terminates operations and returns to the current death program, files
are transferred to the JMAO for archiving.
5-74. GCCs will establish a formal process for the archiving of all documents prepared or obtained in the
disposition of all human remains processing, to include documents relating to recovery, presumptive
identification preparation, temporary interment, and transportation from their geographic area of
responsibility pursuant to DODI 5015.02.
TRANSIT COLLECTION POINT OPERATIONS 
5-75. Theater-level MA operations may require logistics support that spans multiple countries. In such cases,
an MACP can also act as a transit point. Do not assign a new evacuation number to HR that arrive at a second
MACP in transit to the TMEP. Instead, place a T before the original evacuation number on supporting
documentation (DD Form 1077 and on the evacuation tags) to signify a transit item. This will assist with
avoiding the duplicate counting of HR and PE items. An example of a transit number for HR is
TR7-19/AR54thQMCO/MACP1.
5-76. MACP personnel will not remove any numbered security seals or further process the HR and PE when
at a transit location. If a numbered security seal is broken in transit, the receiving MACP notifies the TMEP,
TMAO, JMAO, and the appropriate investigative agency, as required. Before replacing a broken security
seal, annotate the new numbered security seal information on the case file and evacuation tags.
5-77. Upon arrival at the MACP, make a note of the transfer case temperature gauge reading. Ensure the
Mortuary Affairs Evacuation Ice Worksheet MACP entries are completed, including the temperature noted
at arrival, and the departure temperature as indicated on the transfer case temperature gauge upon loading
onto the transfer vehicle for onward movement.
5-78. To complete the DD Form 1077, enter T in block 6, enter the evacuation number, enter the security
seal number in block 7a, and complete blocks 12 and 13.
SPECIAL CONDITIONS FOR HANDLING HUMAN REMAINS 
5-79. Contact the TMAO for special conditions and procedures on handling HR that are local nationals,
MNF partners, detainees, and civilian internees. These categories of deceased personnel have specific
requirements for processing and evacuation. Contact the AFMES for further guidance and disposition
instructions in the event there is a commingling of these categories of remains with U.S. DOD-affiliated
personnel. Contact the JMAO for coordination instructions on repatriating any of these above categories to
an appropriate location.
5-80. There is a requirement to report all suspected law of war violations and detainee deaths to the servicing
judge advocate or legal advisor. Make timely reports to higher HQ and military criminal investigatory
agencies as required IAW the Department of Defense Law of War Manual and FM 3-63.

PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING LOCAL NATIONAL HUMAN REMAINS 
5-81. The MACP coordinates with the TMAO and the TMEP for the return of local national HR and PE to
the host nation government. Enemy combatant and host nation HR processing is performed with the same
care and respect afforded United States or partner nation remains. If possible, store local national HR in a
separate refrigerated container not used for U.S. remains or partner nation HR. Encourage the utilization of
international agencies for coordinating the repatriation of host nation HR back to local control (for example,
International Committee of the Red Cross or equivalent).
PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING MULTINATIONAL FORCE PARTNER HUMAN REMAINS 
5-82. Accomplish handling of MNF partner HR according to current international agreements,
standardization agreements, or contracts (for third-country nationals). If no agreements or policies are in
place, then use U.S. policies and procedures for handling the HR. Afford MNF partner remains the same care
and respect given to U.S. remains. The MACP coordinates through the TMEP, TMAO or JMAO, and
embassies for processing guidance and repatriation of MNF partner HR to their country of origin.
PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING DETAINEE HUMAN REMAINS 
5-83. The investigative agency representative accompanies the detainee HR to the nearest MACP facility for
transport and evacuation IAW the GCC’s regulations and procedures. The AFMES will determine
requirements for an autopsy. Do not release detainee HR from U.S. custody without authorization from the
AFMES and the responsible commander. Place the detainee HR in an HRP with a security seal and prepare
for movement. The MA personnel at an MACP or TMEP will assign an evacuation number and prepare
appropriate shipping documents and a case file in MARTS. The JMAO will coordinate through the TMAO
for movement of the detainee HR.
PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING CIVILIAN INTERNEE HUMAN REMAINS 
5-84. The U.S. commander of the facility or U.S. unit exercising custody over the HR shall report the death
to the responsible investigative agency and TMAO or JMAO. The TMAO or JMAO and investigative agency
will contact the AFMES to coordinate disposition. The AFMES will determine the requirement for an
autopsy. Do not release civilian internee HR from U.S. custody without authorization from the AFMES and
the responsible commander.
5-85. The investigative agency representative accompanies the civilian internee HR to the nearest MACP
for transport and evacuation according to the GCC’s regulations and policies. Place the civilian internee HR
in an HRP with a security seal and prepare for movement. The MA personnel will assign an evacuation
number, prepare appropriate shipping documents, and create a case file in MARTS. Procedures for handling
and disposition of civilian internee HR will be IAW FM 3-63, GCC MA Support Regulation or Memorandum
or Letter of Instruction for MA Operations, and the AFMES authority.
MILITARY WORKING DOGS 
5-86. The following references establish guidance for the DOD Military Working Dog (MWD) Program:
⚫
DODD 5200.31E.
⚫

5-87. MA personnel will provide very limited assistance when requested, as human remains take precedence.
Initially, it is the responsibility of the supporting Army veterinary services personnel to manage deceased
MWD remains after recovery and find temporary refrigeration if the postmortem cannot be performed
immediately. Refer to the GCC theater guidance on MWD remains within the AOR.
5-88. If brought to the MACP, place the MWD remains and all PE in a designated area separate from HR
and contact the supporting veterinary services asset. Place the MWD remains in a marked (military working
dog name, tattoo number, and unit) HRP and place in a designated area of cold storage (if available). If an

HRP is unavailable, a leak-proof bag with a marked overlay such as a poncho, blanket, or wet weather gear 
may be used. The MA personnel may need to assist the owning unit or veterinary unit with supplies or by 
arranging transportation of the MWD remains to the closest Army veterinary asset for postmortem 
examination. The MWD may be covered in a U.S. Flag during transportation. 
5-89. If comingled with human remains, evacuate the MWD remains with the HR to Dover Air Force Base
for the AFMES examination and for DNA and separation. Contact the Joint Pathology Center Veterinary
Pathology Services for further collaborative assistance.
5-90. If supporting veterinary services assets do not have temporary refrigeration capability, MACPs,
transfer points, or TMEPs with refrigeration capabilities can temporarily store MWD remains, if space is
available, until transportation can be arranged for postmortem examination. Isolate the MWD remains in a
separate, clearly marked area from the human remains. Treat the MWDs with dignity, reverence, and respect.
5-91. After postmortem examination, coordinate transportation of MWD remains with the MWD-owning
unit commander or the U.S. Forces that the MWD team was attached to, or operating with, if death occurs in
a deployed location. Options for disposition of remains may include clean cremation or medical incineration
followed by return to the MWD parent organization

Theater Mortuary Evacuation Point Operations 
The TMEP provides mortuary affairs processing, tentative identification, and storage 
and evacuation of HR not processed at a mortuary affairs collection point. The TMEP 
is task-organized to perform quality assurance checks on existing documentation, 
provide refrigeration capability for HR awaiting transportation, and coordinate 
available airlift for evacuation to the designated mortuary for forensic examination and 
final disposition. When required, all Services may augment the TMEP operation with 
mortuary affairs personnel in order to facilitate the processing and expedite the 
evacuation of all DOD-affiliated HR and accompanying PE. 
SECTION I – MISSION AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
6-1.  The TMEP has the primary mission of evacuating all HR and PE to a military mortuary. The TMEP
also has the responsibility to initiate required movement control documents, provide storage, and coordinate
the evacuation of HR and PE from the theater to either the port mortuary or as indicated by the AFMES. The
Army is tasked with the theater-level mission to operate a TMEP.
6-2. The TMEP is task-organized to—
⚫
Receive HR and PE from any theater location.
⚫
Perform quality assurance checks on existing documentation or initiate, complete, or obtain
required processing documentation. It can receive HR in MARTS or initiate documentation in
MARTS if a file does not exist.
⚫
Prepare the HR for evacuation and refrigerate the remains while arranging transportation out of
theater if possible.
⚫
Coordinate for aircraft and initiate all required shipping and special handling documents.
⚫
Load, palletize, tie down transfer cases, and transport pallets to the AMC cargo special handling
area if required.
6-3. The TMEP can operate a theater PE transfer point (see chapter 7) as a secondary mission and is
organized to—
⚫
Receive pre-inventoried and packaged PE from either the SCMO, SCO, or personal effects
inventory officer (PEIO) in theater.
⚫
Store and safeguard PE until transportation is coordinated.
⚫
Load, palletize, tie down PE tri-walls, and transport pallets to the AMC cargo holding area for
shipment to the CONUS JPED.
6-4. The TMEP is responsible for initiating any missing required documentation. Evacuation will not be
delayed awaiting documentation from the unit. It is paramount to preserve forensic evidence to the maximum
extent possible for the forensic pathology investigation.
6-5. When feasible, the TMEP is responsible for processing, tentative ID, storage, and evacuation when
minimum processing procedures were used at an evacuating MACP.
SECTION II – CAPABILITIES, PLANNING, AND LAYOUT 
6-6. A TMEP consists of one Army MA platoon and contains four sections: receiving, processing,
administrative, and evacuation. The TMEP minimum staffing requirement is 28 personnel, which can be
Chapter 6 
6-2
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
augmented with additional Army MA platoons and multi-Service MA personnel. During large-scale combat 
operations, the TMEP requires two to four platoons depending on surge requirements. 
6-7. TMEP capabilities —
⚫
Process up to 250 HR a day per one Army MA platoon.
⚫
Move a transfer case in excess of 450lbs using a four to six-person team.
⚫
Conduct continuous 24-hour operations.
⚫
Maintain a stock of 500 HRTCs or IHRTCs. (The HRTCs and IHRTCs, as well as HRPs, PPE,
and sanitation cleaning materials, are replenished by the MA lead Service with MA supplies.)
6-8. The minimum recommended composition of personnel required to operate a TMEP includes—
⚫
One TMEP officer in charge (OIC) (MARTS and DCIPS access).
⚫
One MA NCO (MOS 92M); TMEP NCOIC supervisor (MARTS and DCIPS access).
⚫
Four MA NCOs (MOS 92M); TMEP section/team leader (MARTS and DCIPS access).
⚫
Four MA NCOs (MOS 92M); each operate in a section (MARTS access).
⚫
Sixteen MA specialists (MOS 92M); divided into the four sections as receiving, processing,
administrative, and evacuation specialists (at least eight personnel with MARTS access).
⚫
Support personnel: MOS 91C, Utilities Equipment Repairer (one per four MIRCS). Additional
refrigeration requires more refrigeration mechanics than the aforementioned 1:4 ratio. This
requirement is based on maximum use for 24 hours. Additionally, a 92M MA specialist is required
as a dedicated driver.
6-9. The TMEP is responsible for ensuring quality control for each section:
⚫
The receiving section receives HR and PE into the TMEP from the main, transfer, and forward
MACPs. It may also receive HR and PE directly from local units that have sustained fatalities.
⚫
The processing section processes HR and PE from the receiving section in the TMEP.
⚫
The administrative section either prepares or updates the original individual deceased case file,
creates the TMEP file copy, and conducts all associated administrative actions that support the
TMEP.
⚫
The evacuation section prepares and conducts quality assurance checks on the HR and PE for
transport, coordinates transportation, and evacuates the HR and PE to the designated mortuary.
ASSIGNMENT AND ALLOCATION 
6-10. The TMEP mission is assigned to the Army. The quartermaster (QM) MA companies execute this
mission with multifunctional MA platoons. The MA company is more versatile during a full company
deployment, capable of assigning any MA collective task to any of the platoons. A MA company can support
a force of 165,000 personnel while assigning missions to separate MA platoons. When tasked to establish
and operate a TMEP, the MA platoon should operate in within the JSA. In cases where multiple MA
companies must deploy to support large-scale combat operations, the ASCC or the Service component
command lead for MA will call forward those MA units to backfill or go forward to support maneuver units.
(See chapter 9 in this publication for more information on the Army MA company.)
6-11. The JMAO determines the employment of MA capabilities along with the ASCC or the MA lead
Service that manages the TMAO. The ASCC or the Service component command lead for MA submits the
TPFDD for an MA company (or more) to deploy by separate standard requirement code to fill theater MA
authorizations. Throughout the requirements selection process, the assigned MA unit will establish and
operate the TMEP. Other MA platoons will move forward to support the JOA as the theater is set. Once
coordination is complete and unit placement is determined, the TMEP will contact the TMAO to publish the
TMEP location to all units within the JOA.
6-12. The TMAO will direct all Services operating in the JOA to evacuate remains through the TMEP. The
location of the TMEP in the JSA supports MA teams and units evacuating HR and PE all the way from the
forward area to the theater rear for onward movement to the CONUS port mortuary. The TMEP will submit
updates and reports to the TMAO and facilitate the distribution of correspondence throughout the JOA on
behalf of the TMEP.

ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
6-3
6-13. All TMEP personnel, equipment utilization, and theater MA supply status reports and updates
submitted to the TSC are also reportable to the ASCC or Service component command lead for MA. Daily
reports and updates contain information on HR and PE processed, evacuated, and backlogged in refrigerated
storage awaiting transportation. This data helps provide the GCC a common operational picture of the status
of MA support across the theater and helps identify increased requirements for equipment and supply support.
It also helps forecast surge planning estimates, unit rotation timelines, and assets required to reinforce the
theater.
6-14. When established, the MA platoon operating the PE depot will be co-located with the TMEP. If assets
are available, a separate MA platoon will initiate TPED operations (see chapter 7).
SITE SELECTION 
6-15. The TMEP should be located in the JSA, adjacent to a major air or sea port of embarkation (POE). The
TMEP personnel must coordinate with the area commander prior to selecting a site to ensure the proposed
site will not interfere with any ongoing flight line (if APOE) or base operations. The area needs to be secure
and segregated from the living, but do not compromise site security by completely isolating the TMEP.
6-16. Additional TMEPs may be established at other APOE throughout the theater based on the following
factors:
⚫
The geographical size, population, and location of units in the theater.
⚫
The projected number of HR and the availability of aircraft to evacuate them.
⚫
The operational concept and scheme of maneuver for all units in the theater.
6-17. Location of the TMEP is key to the overall success of its mission. Choose a site based on the following
factors:
⚫
Quick, easy access to and from all flight lines.
⚫
Quick, easy access to AMC operations, transportation, and cargo or special handling areas.
⚫
Ability to use existing facilities, and build or install temporary fixed facilities with trailers,
additional refrigeration vans (40 or 53 foot), and cold storage units.
⚫
Area to set up multiple MIRCS or other refrigerated containers.
⚫
Wash rack area (for cleaning and disinfecting transfer cases, vehicles, misc. equipment).
⚫
Large space to store bulk quantities of transfer cases, HRPs, and MA PPE.
⚫
Ability to use an existing road network or build one to handle and regulate large traffic flow.
⚫
Ability to use existing or install cooling and ventilation systems, electrical lines, additional phone
lines, and water lines.
⚫
Ability to access the internet, government email (non-classified), MARTS, and DCIPS, and write
data to RFID tags or other approved advanced in-transit visibility devices.
6-18. The suggested organizational and facility layout is a guide and will vary based on the size of the
operating area. When developing a facility layout, consider the following:
⚫
Vehicle and helicopter traffic flow, including parking.
⚫
Space for additional contracted refrigeration containers (for example, 40 or 53-foot trailers).
⚫
Electrical power source or generators.
⚫
Bulk water and ice delivery support.
⚫
Fuel pod.
⚫
Communications.
⚫
Connex space.
⚫
Waste disposal (regular and biohazard).
⚫
Ordnance disposal area.
⚫
Supply, equipment, and publication storage.
⚫
Laundry and personal hygiene facilities.
⚫
Dining, and morale, welfare, and recreation facilities.

⚫
Ability for future expansion to meet potential mission requirements.
6-19. When establishing the actual layout for the TMEP, structure the facility in a manner that minimizes
the manual lifting of HR (see appendix A for ergonomics information). Figure 6-1 illustrates a suggested
TMEP layout, however, operational constraints may warrant other layouts.

⚫
Maintenance personnel.
⚫
Aircraft cargo loading specialists or laborers.
Note. TMEP personnel must remember the overall sensitivity of their mission when they use HN 
labor. 
ICE-MAKING CAPABILITY AND PROCUREMENT 
6-23. When operating out of permanent, hard standing facilities (such as with past counterinsurgency and
stability operations), attempt to acquire access to ice making equipment. Procure ice-making machines
capable of producing large quantities of ice. When required, use operational contract support to locate
vendors that make large quantities of ice for preserving HR for transport. Use all possible capabilities without
degrading operations that support the living (for example, dining or recreation facilities).
6-24. During large-scale combat operations, the large number of fatalities may outpace the ability to create
ice. Plan for and establish an alternate storage mechanism. This may be a container, refrigerated if possible,
but not required. MA activities may improvise ice-making capabilities, providing that the ice bottles or other
devices can be secured in the transfer case and do not pose a threat to damage or inflict more harm to the
remains.
6-25. When ice is available, ice the HR immediately prior to sealing the transfer case for evacuation.
Recommend double or triple-bagging with approximately 60-90lbs bags of ice around the outside of the HRP
(AFMES guidance for icing remains listed in paragraph 6-35).
Note. Ice, ice-water, or melted ice used in MA must not be re-used for consumption or cooling of 
class I (food or water for consumption). 
FORMS AND REPORTS 
6-26. See appendix C for the following shipping documents used by the TMEP in the return of HR, portions,
and disassociated PE:
⚫

SECTION III – THEATER MORTUARY EVACUATION POINT TECHNIQUES 
6-28. The TMEP uses a four-section system to process HR, portions, and disassociated personal effects. The
TMEP sections are receiving, processing, administrative, and evacuation. (See chapter 5 for non-U.S. human
remains and PE handling techniques.)
RECEIVING SECTION 
6-29. The receiving section will—
⚫
Meet the delivering driver outside in the reception area and obtain DD Form 1075.
⚫
Check HR for UXO using a handheld metal detector at a safe standoff distance from the area. If
UXO is discovered, clear the area around the HR, take cover, and call for EOD support. (Refer to
ATP 4-32 for proper EOD support procedures.)
⚫
Verify HR, portions, and PE are safe for transportation. Ensure seals are untampered prior to
signing the receipt on DD Form 1075.
⚫
Move remains into the TMEP receiving area or staging area. Make a note of the transfer case
temperature gauge reading upon arrival at the TMEP.
⚫
Ensure the Mortuary Affairs Evacuation Ice Worksheet entries are completed for the TMEP
including the temperature noted at arrival.
⚫
Create a TMEP case file and copy forms found in the MACP case file, if present. Initiating a case
file in MARTS will automatically generate a new evacuation number (refer to chapter 5 for
instructions on manually creating an evacuation number).
⚫
Remove MACP evacuation tags and place in the individual deceased case file folder.
⚫
When receiving HR from a transfer MACP, record the HR data on the DD Form 1077 using the
originally assigned evacuation number. The TMEP will receive the HR in MARTS and issue a
new evacuation number for onward movement to the port mortuary.
⚫
Prepare three evacuation tags (for example, HR, HRP, and transfer case) using a TMEP evacuation
number. If the TMEP is the first MA facility to receive the HR or PE, the TMEP—
▪
Completes the inventory of PE using the two-person control system to maintain the integrity
and chain of custody for the received PE.
▪
Completes the DD Form 1076 in MARTS for each HR received that has PE.
⚫
Secure one TMEP evacuation tag to the HR, one tag to the HRP, and one tag to the transfer case.
Once HR are received at the TMEP, the TMEP evacuation number becomes the primary tracking
number and the MACP evacuation number is no longer used. Record the evacuation tag number
in the paper case file.
⚫
Enter the deceased case file data on DD Form 1077.
⚫
Initiate a case in MARTS or receive in MARTS if a main MACP has initiated a case file.
⚫
Give the case file to the processing section upon completion of the receiving tasks.
PROCESSING SECTION 
6-30. The processing section uses a three-step process (inspect, process, and quality control) to—
⚫
Verify all paperwork and evacuation tags match the HR, portions, and PE.
⚫
Complete the missing required forms for the individual deceased case file. If the TMEP is the first
MA facility in the chain to receive HR and PE or if there is no inventory with the case file—
▪
Inventory any undocumented PE found. Use the two-person control system to maintain the
integrity and chain of custody for the received PE.

▪
Complete DD Form 1076 and upload in MARTS for each HR received that has PE. In the
event that an HR has arrived at the TMEP without any PE, initiate a DD Form 1076 with a
line crossed through the upper most line of block 7 and block 8 with the caption “nothing
follows”.
Note. Make a comment in the MARTS file that the HR arrived to the TMEP with no PE. 
⚫
Verify DD Form 2064, DD Form 1380, or SF 600 is present, with the cause of death pending
Armed Forces Medical Examiner Determination. If DD Form 2064 is missing, contact the
supporting medical treatment facility to examine the HR and complete the required forms for
transport.
⚫
Process the HR using normal procedures (see chapter 5) if the evacuating MACP used minimal
processing procedures and workload allows.
⚫
Inventory all forms, tags, and case files, including the MARTS entries. Quality assurance/quality
control will do the inventory.
⚫
Scan and upload all accompanying documents or TMEP-prepared documents into MARTS, if not
already uploaded.
⚫
Place paper forms in the TMEP case file and original individual deceased case file that will
accompany the HR, portions, and PE.
⚫
Give the case files to the administrative section.
⚫
Place the HR in refrigerated storage or deliver to the evacuation section as the situation dictates.
ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION 
6-31. The administrative section is responsible for updating the original individual deceased case file,
establishing the TMEP case file folder, and performing the following tasks:
⚫
Directs the transfer of the HR from storage to the processing area.
⚫
Receives the case folder and paperwork from the processing section.
⚫
Scans and uploads accompanying documentation in the original individual deceased case file or
TMEP-prepared documents into MARTS (DD Form 2064, DD Form 1380, DD Form 1076, DD
Form 565, and SF 600).
⚫
Calls the air terminal operations center to determine flight schedules, flight times, and dates.
Informs the air terminal operations center how many HR are ready for shipment.
⚫
Requests an immediate evacuation flight. Requests a flight diversion when remains are held longer
than 24 hours or a longer delay is projected.
⚫
Obtains flight mission number and estimated time of departure from the air terminal operations
center and informs the TMEP evacuation section leader.
⚫
Prepares three copies of transportation documents:
▪
DD Form 1384.
▪
DD Form 1387 (Figure 6-2).
▪
DD Form 1387-2 (Figure 6-3).
⚫
Places the transportation documents and original individual deceased case file documents in the
case folder.
⚫
Places photocopies of the same documents in the TMEP case file folder.
⚫
Inputs required evacuation and shipping information into MARTS:
▪
Uses automatic identification technology system for capturing data (barcode or RFID tags)
and adds automatic identification technology data into the MARTS case file.
▪
Transmits data to CONUS.
⚫
Dispatches the shipping priority message to the message center (within 2 hours of flight departure).
At a minimum, the message must be addressed to United States Transportation Command, AMC
at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, the destination military mortuary, and the JMAO.

6-32. In addition to the above tasks, the administrative section also checks with airlift personnel for any
requirement to stack transfer cases. In the case of multiple HR, transfer cases may be either floor-loaded or
palletized for transport (aircraft crew chief determines based on mission). Personnel must work with aerial
port and operations support squadron lead personnel to verify pallet specifications and space requirements
for transport aircraft. The following list includes planning factors for palletization of transfer cases:
⚫
A maximum of 12 transfer cases may be loaded on a 463-L pallet, stacked no more than four high.
⚫
C-5 aircraft can carry a maximum of 36 pallets for a total of 432 transfer cases.
⚫
C-17 aircraft can carry a maximum of 18 pallets for a total of 216 transfer cases.
⚫
C-130 aircraft can carry a maximum of 5 pallets for a total of 60 transfer cases.
⚫
Only palletize transfer cases to maximize limited aircraft space during transport. Draping transfer
cases with the U.S. flag is not authorized when cases are palletized.

Note. U.S. flags are authorized for draping of transfer cases during conflict and will be used when 
available. The transfer case will be inspected and prepared for dignified transfer upon arrival in 
the U.S. prior to being transferred to the port mortuary. 
EVACUATION SECTION 
6-33. The evacuation section’s primary functions are to prepare HR and documentation for evacuation,
certify customs documents, and transport the remains to the AMC for airlift to the designated DOD mortuary.
The only authorized reasons for delaying transport are insufficient transfer cases, limited airlift, or
extenuating circumstances as approved by the commander.
6-34. The evacuation section will—
⚫
Receive the HR from the processing section or the refrigeration unit.
⚫
Verify that the case folder paperwork from the administrative section matches the HR and HR
tags.
⚫
Report any delay in departure time if the time requirement for return of HR cannot be met:
▪
Immediately notify the TMAO and AFMES of the reason for the delay (the TMAO will notify
the applicable Service casualty offices).
▪
Coordinate with Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operations to attempt to resolve any delays.
⚫
Inspect the transfer case for any damage, cleanliness, and transfer case number.
⚫
Double-seal the case file in the plastic slide closure bag and secure.
⚫
Tape the case file to the inside top (above the foot area) of the HRTC or place in the document
compartment drawer box (if using the IHRTC).
6-35. Follow AFMES guidance on icing the HR:
⚫
Never use dry ice.
⚫
Never place ice directly against the skin or over the face of the HR.
⚫
Ensure the transfer case is sanitized and the number is assigned to the remains for evacuation.
⚫
Ensure ice bags are double or triple-sealed bags (individually) to prevent leakage and reduce
condensation. This is to maintain preservation of the HR.
⚫
Prepare nine bags of crushed wet ice weighing approximately 9-10lbs each. Position seven of the
ice bags in the empty bottom tray of a sanitized transfer case.
⚫
Place ice bags according to the diagram provided in figure 6-4. Typical placement of ice bags will
vary according to condition of the HR:
⚫
Place the bags of crushed wet ice in the following locations:
▪
Head—Two bags, one on each side of the head (do not place over face).
▪
Chest—Three bags, one on each side of the torso (oblique), and one over chest.
▪
Lower Extremities— Three bags, one on each side of lower extremities, and one over the
groin area.
▪
Feet—One bag under the feet.
⚫
Before positioning the HRP in the transfer case, verify that the remains are assigned to that transfer
case.
⚫
Lay the HRP over top of the wet ice bags in the bottom tray of the transfer case.
⚫
When using pre-bagged crushed wet ice, place on the outside of the HRP.
⚫
Do not use ice in place of a head block, as it will melt, leaving the head and neck region under-
elevated. This will result in blood becoming fixed permanently.
⚫
Secure the HRP and ice bags with the white engineer tie-down straps crisscrossing the straps or
550-cord over the HRP and the ice. Use the metal ring attached to the inside of the transfer case
to prevent shifting during transport.

Note 1. If access to ice is not available, but refrigerated cold storage assets are on hand, leave the 
HR in the cold storage until preparing for evacuation from the theater. 
Note 2. When applying ice to the HR for transportation to the port mortuary or re-icing at an aerial 
port, it may be necessary to place additional bags of ice to compensate for climatic conditions. 
USAF expeditionary force support personnel, specifically the Prime RIBS team members, 
routinely re-ice HR at in-transit locations using 60-90 lbs. of crushed wet ice. (See chapter 12 for 
information on re icing procedures.) 
Figure 6-4. Recommended placement of ice for human remains 
6-36. Prepare the HR for evacuation:
⚫
The MA NCO inspects and certifies the HR and PE inside the transfer case for transport.
▪
The mortuary affairs individual present during the preparation and inspection of remains will
ensure that each HR and transfer case/container is examined for prohibited and restricted
items prior to closure of the transfer case/container.
▪
MA certifies completion of the examination by annotating “The attached HR transfer case
contains no prohibited items or commodities” on the DD Form 1384 and signing the form
(instructions for completing the DD Form 1384 are located in Appendix C).
⚫
Secure the lid to the transfer case and put the metal security seals on opposite corners.
⚫
Complete the next re-icing block entry on the MA Evacuation Ice Worksheet. If no sheet was
included from the previous evacuation, fill out a new worksheet.
⚫
Affix DD Form 1387 on top of the transfer case at the head end approximately six inches from the
edge (do not cover the transfer case number).

on the transfer case if palletizing.
⚫
Place the cargo net and tie-down straps on or over cargo (usually done at cargo special handling).
⚫
Use material handling equipment to lift pallets onto the truck.
⚫
Use a six or eight-person dignified carry when not using material handling equipment.
⚫
Provide the driver with copies of DD Form 1384 and DD Form 1387-2 for each HR.
⚫
Ensure the TMEP driver delivers the HR to the airfield flight line cargo and special handling
section in time for the joint inspection and palletizing.
⚫
Ensure the driver, aircraft commander, or loadmaster signs three copies of DD Form 1075 and
retains the original and one copy.
⚫
Return one copy of the signed DD Form 1075 to the TMEP administrative section for upload to
MARTS, evacuate the HR in MARTS, and file the signed DD Form 1075 in the TMEP case file
folder.
6-37. When preparing only PE for evacuation—
⚫
It must be free of narcotics, drugs, and other contraband items prior to movement to a CONUS
JPED or family members/next of kin.
⚫
An MA NCO will conduct an inspection/examination of the PE, ensure the containers are sealed,
and will affix a DD Form 2855 certifying it as cleared of any prohibited items (see figure 6-5).
⚫
Ship the PE to the JPED through the military transportation system or official US mail. Current
Customs and Border Patrol prohibited and restricted items are listed at the web site URL in the

SECTION II – PERSONAL EFFECTS ACTIVITIES 
7-8. There are several MA activities, both in theater and in CONUS, which perform functions involving the
handling, processing, and evacuation of PE. The level of processing varies between the different activities.
This section describes the roles and functions of these activities and their relationship with each other.
JOINT PERSONAL EFFECTS DEPOT 
7-9. The JPED is a permanent PE depot located in CONUS and maintained by the U.S. Army IAW DODD
1300.22. The JPED receives PE from mortuary evacuation channels and is responsible for the receipt,
safeguarding, inventory, screening, cleaning, packaging, and shipment of PE IAW DODI 1300.29.
Furthermore, is also responsible for coordinating the transfer of PE to the appropriate Service representative
for delivery to the person eligible to receive effects. The JPED is located on the MA campus, next to the
Dover Port Mortuary and the AFMES, on Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. The JPED operates under the
auspices of the Army Casualty and Mortuary Affairs Operations Division, Human Resources Command
(HRC) at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Policy changes and guidelines are made available through Service-specific
publications.
THEATER PERSONAL EFFECTS DEPOT 
7-10. The mission of the TPED is to receive, safeguard, inventory, store, process, and evacuate the PE of
deceased and missing personnel to the JPED. Establishing a TPED eliminates the need for a Service to handle
Personal Effects

progress of the investigation if the discrepancy cannot be resolved internally.
⚫
Obtain the correct casualty status of the individual for each package of PE.
⚫
Process the PE of deceased personnel for shipment to the JPED. Ensure all data is properly entered
into MARTS.
⚫
Secure and store PE until they are shipped to the JPED.
Processing Section 
7-13. The processing section will assist the PEIO with the following tasks if the PEIO has not already
inventoried and containerized the PE:
⚫
Check the case file to determine the exact location of all PE for the individual.
⚫
Screen and inventory all items.
⚫
Remove any organizational clothing and individual equipment (OCIE) and unit-issued equipment
for return through the appropriate supply channels. Do not send OCIE to the JPED.
⚫
Document all PE on DD Form 1076 as required.
⚫
Place the inventory documents in the case file.
⚫
Place items inventoried into a container with the documents and take them to the shipping section
or into secure storage.

Secure all high-dollar-value items and official personal papers in an individual container and store
the container in a safe or in a locked security cage if the PE are not going directly to shipping.
Annotate on the case file where those items are stored.
⚫
Complete the documents for any items removed from the PE that are not being shipped. (Remove
government property or items that are classified, hazardous, or that did not meet customs
requirements.) Update the entries in MARTS.
Shipping (Storage) Section 
7-14. The shipping section will—
⚫
Prepare the PE for shipment:
▪
Select proper size containers for shipment (It is recommended to use footlockers for
packaging PE. Tri-wall containers are the preferred method of shipment for footlockers).
▪
Line all containers with packing material.
▪
Use assigned MA specialists who have been certified as customs border certification agents
to conduct the inspection and certification. Coordinate for a customs inspection to coincide
with the actual packing of PE if there are no customs border certification agents assigned to
the TPED.
▪
Wrap all items that may be damaged during shipment.
▪
Place items in the container in the reverse order of that appearing on the inventory to allow
for the unpacking of the items in the order shown on the inventory.
▪
Place a copy of the inventory on top of the PE inside the container prior to closing.
▪
Close and seal the containers for shipment.
▪
Write data to automatic identification technology devices, such as RFID tags. Enter the RFID
data into MARTS.

Ensure the containers are shipped on either a government bill of lading, or by registered or insured
mail.
⚫
Check disposition instructions, verify request and implement for oversized items.
⚫
Write data correctly to the RFID tag and ensure that the tag information matches the information
in the server.
⚫
Complete the required shipping documents and coordinate with AMC transportation personnel for
airlift. Palletize containers and arrange transport for pallets to the AMC cargo special handling
section. Send a representative with the pallets to the AMC cargo area. Upon delivery of the pallets,
the TPED representative will obtain a signature from the AMC representative on the shipping
documents.
⚫
PE shipment must meet customs requirements IAW DTR 4500-9R, Part V chapter 502-20, see

THEATER PERSONAL EFFECTS TRANSFER POINT 
7-17. A surge in combat operations may overwhelm normal PE evacuation channels. The TMEP may act as
an intermediate transfer point between the units in theater and the JPED if a TPED is not operational. The
TMEP is then responsible for the receipt, storage, palletization, and evacuation of PE to the JPED.
Chapter 7 
7-6
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
Note. During large-scale combat operations when using minimum processing procedures in 
theater, do not use the TMEP as a theater PE transfer point. Recommend requesting additional 
personnel to establish a TPED, since the TMEP may already be overwhelmed or additionally 
tasked to conduct other MA operations. 
7-18. When the TMEP handles PE while operating as an in-transit transfer point, it—
⚫
Verifies that packages are sealed and properly labeled. The chain of custody receipt will reflect
acceptance of the secured PE containers only.
⚫
Conducts a two-person confirmation inventory if the containers are damaged, or if the seals or
locks are broken. The PEIO delivering the PE must conduct a confirmation inventory with the MA
specialist receiving the PE.
⚫
Documents any missing items on a memorandum for record. Add the memorandum to the PE
documentation that is forwarded to the JPED. Notifies the appropriate investigating authority in
an effort to recover the missing items if theft or negligence is suspected. If no inventory is required,
the chain of custody receipt will reflect secured PE containers only.
⚫
Provides a receipt to the PEIO. The receipt documents the acceptance of the PE, confirms the
chain of custody, provides an inventory of items, and relieves the PEIO of responsibility for PE.
⚫
Attaches an RFID tag, barcode tag, or package label to the outside of the PE container (include
casualty status, decedent, PE, and organization).
⚫
Verifies the name on the package label matches the name of the signed inventory sheet and
annotates on the inventory sheet the package was sealed at arrival. The signing of the chain of
custody receipt only assigns responsibility for the sealed package, not the individual package
contents.
⚫
Establishes an electronic effects case file in MARTS to document the receipt of PE from a PEIO.
Uploads all inventory documents, completes necessary shipping documents (ensure special
handling code “KY” is indicated to ensure hand-to-hand custody and safeguarding required by
Service regulations), coordinates movement, and ships to the next MA facility in the evacuation
chain. Ensures each package of PE has a printed case file.
⚫
Assigns an evacuation number for all packages pertaining to a particular individual. The
evacuation number consists of three parts:
▪
A numerically sequential case number.
▪
The location of the TMEP.
▪
The number of packages containing PE for the particular individual.
⚫
Records the evacuation number on the case file, all applicable inventory sheets, and DD Form
1076 inside the file.
⚫
Prepares and secures an evacuation tag to each package pertaining to a particular individual.
⚫
Places a plastic packing list envelope on each package, and places a copy of the inventory sheet
for that package inside the envelope.
Note. Ship PE within 24 hours of receipt, or as soon as mission constraints allow. 
SECTION III – PERSONAL EFFECTS INVENTORY OFFICER 
7-19. PEIOs are unit officers appointed by commanders on written orders, who provide a full accounting of
all decedent PE. This section provides in-depth discussion of the procedures PEIOs use to inventory and
accurately record PE, and provides guidance on the identification, removal, and disposition of certain
unauthorized items. It also outlines the final actions required for the PEIO to successfully complete the
assignment and be released back to regular duties.

RESPONSIBILITIES 
7-20. Once appointed, the PEIO is responsible for—
⚫
Collection, inventory, and safeguarding of the PE of Service members, DOD-affiliated civilians,
or contractors under the command’s control or jurisdiction.
⚫
Completing the PE inventory within 12 hours of being appointed.
⚫
Delivery of all PE in inventoried, sealed PE containers to the MACP or TPED for shipment to the
JPED (In some instances the MACP, TMEP, or TPED may be used as in-transit PE transfer
points).
⚫
Per Service regulation, unit evacuates PE to the home base through supply channels for injured or
medically evacuated.
Note: If the unit mistakenly evacuates PE to home base, the home station detachment should 
contact the home station SCMO and JPED to coordinate shipment of PE to JPED. PE packages or 
containers received must not be opened to ensure chain of custody is not broken. 
7-21. U.S. Navy ship commanding officers at sea should appoint PEIOs IAW Service policy and regulations.
PEIOs should prepare to debark when the ship next makes port, or coordinate for helicopter support if close
enough to shore. Once in port, the PEIO should report to the beach detachment for assignment until all tasks
have been completed, and the sealed and inventoried PE boxes have been signed for by the nearest MACP,
TMEP, or TPED for shipment to the JPED.
7-22. Unit PEIOs are responsible for recovering all PE and government equipment located at MTFs. MTFs
have procedures to safeguard the PE of personnel receiving care, however, safeguarding PE is of secondary
importance to patient treatment. The medical staff will collect, safeguard, and inventory the PE of patients
and decedents upon completion of medical treatment. Patient personal property or decedent PE should
accompany them whenever possible. MA Staff should inquire about personal protective gear if the deceased
arrives from an MTF without body armor, plates, vest, or helmet for AFMES analysis.

Chapter 8 
Temporary Interment and Disinterment Operations 
This chapter identifies the requirements, responsibilities, planning considerations, and 
procedures for temporary interment and disinterment operations. These operations will 
vary based on the ability to evacuate human remains from a theater and the availability 
of resources to execute temporary interment after exploring all other options. The GCC 
is the sole approval authority for conducting temporary interment, disinterment, and 
reinterment operations within the AOR. 
SECTION I – OVERVIEW 
8-1. Military operations have the potential to produce large numbers of fatalities that may overwhelm
military and civilian capabilities. This may impede the evacuation of deceased personnel from theaters of
operations. Weapons of mass destruction attacks and man-made or natural disasters have the potential to
create fatalities with the added complexity of contaminated human remains. The GCC may authorize
temporary interment in the AOR and should plan for this possibility during large-scale combat operations
and CBRN response operations, but only when all other options for processing the remains have been
exhausted.
8-2. There is presently no enduring solution or program of record within the DOD MA program that
facilitates the repatriation of contaminated HR from OCONUS back to CONUS. There is a limited
contaminated HR processing capability developed to support a combatant command operational needs
statement. Until there are tactics, techniques and procedures approved to return contaminated remains, the
GCC must resort to the extreme measure of temporary interment to protect and safeguard the living while
maintaining the preservation of deceased personnel in the AOR. Although this is a risky course of action,
combatant commanders will need to reserve the appropriate land required to execute this function.
8-3. With limited resources to search, recover, and evacuate HR from a theater, temporary storage or
interment may be the only course of action available at that time. Planners will have to exhaust all avenues
of evacuation before utilizing this option.
SECTION II – PURPOSE AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
8-4. Commanders are responsible for temporary storage, interment, and disinterment operations to ensure
the preservation and accountability of deceased personnel under their control. The primary objectives of these
operations are to maintain morale and field sanitation, and to comply with the law of war, international law,
and international agreements.
PURPOSE 
8-5. Temporary interment is a site for the purpose of interment of human remains, if the circumstances
permit, or the reburial of human remains exhumed from an emergency interment (JP 4-0). The temporary
interment site is established so HR can be organized and preserved in a known location; it serves as a
temporary resting place for those remains that cannot be returned to CONUS immediately. HR that cannot
be returned in a timely manner may pose a serious health and morale threat to U.S. and coalition forces.
Temporary interment allows for the HR to be disinterred and returned in the future if conditions in the OE
permit. In most cases, exhumation will occur during the post-combat or area clearance phase after the conflict.
Chapter 8 
8-2
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
8-6. Some temporary interment sites from past conflicts eventually became the final resting place for U.S.
Service members, and today are overseas cemeteries.
RESPONSIBILITIES 
8-7. MA assets in the AOR are responsible for staffing and maintaining the interment site and associated
records. Whenever possible, a record of the site should be forwarded to the next higher echelon MA asset
and the TMAO for final disposition to the JMAO. The GCC maintains the responsibility of returning all U.S.
DOD-affiliated HR, both military and non-military, to CONUS.
SECTION III – PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
8-8. Planners should take into consideration all types of interment possibilities before committing to an
acquisition of property that will have a significant impact on the surrounding nations or HN. When interment
is necessary, the interment site should be under U.S. control and on high ground with good drainage. Avoid
areas that have high water tables or flood easily. Engineer support should be coordinated for assistance in
digging the necessary trenches.
SITE SELECTION AND ESTABLISHMENT 
8-9. The JMAO will provide courses of action to the GCC for temporary interment operations using large
land mass areas that can accommodate several thousand remains. These courses of action will address options
for the GCC to potentially expand the interment site for future use as a temporary cemetery. This would be
beneficial for exhuming HR from emergency burial sites, isolated interments, and other temporary interment
sites. The temporary interment site may also have an above ground cold storage site on location to
accommodate contaminated HR from a CBRN incident. The JMAO will maintain data and records on all
temporary interment or cold storage sites and the recovery status of all deceased and missing personnel for
the AOR.
8-10. The JMAO planner should incorporate air reconnaissance for a survey team to visit proposed sites, and
coordinate clearance for the proposed locations with the HN. The team will be required to survey the large
land mass that will potentially be used for the temporary interment site. The team should consist of MA
personnel, preventive medicine personnel, and engineers to determine if the locations meet the requirements
for an interment operation. During the survey of the site, ensure that pilot holes are dug to check for
underlying rock formations and ease of digging. Use preexisting sites when available. Engineer support
(personnel and equipment) is required for establishing temporary interment sites.
8-11. MA unit leaders responsible for temporary interment site personnel should consult with operational
public health and preventive medicine personnel for occupational and environment health site assessments.
They should also be documenting suspected or known occupational and environmental health or CBRN
exposures in accordance with DODD 6490.02E. Commanders responsible for temporary interment site
personnel should coordinate behavioral health support for the temporary interment operations team.
8-12. MA unit commanders must obtain permission from the GCC to conduct temporary interment
operations. The temporary interment site will establish separate plots or sites for temporary interment of U.S.,
MNF partner, and adversary deceased. Inter all PE with the HR, do not remove ID tags or ID card, and mark
the interment site for future recovery teams with ten-digit grid coordinates when possible.
RELIGIOUS CONSIDERATIONS 
8-13. When conducting interment or disinterment operations, it is important to consider cultural customs and
religious beliefs.
8-14. Interment site leadership should consult with chaplains and religious leaders from all major faiths at
the interment site for appropriate customs and guidelines that should be followed IAW their guidance. Some
cultures place a great deal of importance on certain customs and courtesies to provide honor and respect to
the deceased. Follow these rituals as much as possible to provide the greatest level of dignity and honor.

FORMS AND REPORTS 
8-17. The GCC establishes a formal process for the archiving of all documents prepared or obtained in the
disposition of all HR processing, to include documents relating to recovery, presumptive identification
preparation, temporary interment, and transportation from their geographic area of responsibility pursuant to
DODI 5015.02.
8-18. For temporary interment operations, consult with the JMAO for guidance on developing temporary
interment site records until a DOD Form for temporary interment is published.
8-19. The following forms (see appendix C) are required for temporary interment and disinterment
operations:
⚫
DD Form 1075 (Chain of Custody for Transportation of Remains and Personal Effects of
Deceased Personnel).
⚫
DD Form 1076 (Record of Personal Effects of Believed to Be (BTB) Deceased).
⚫
DD Form 1079 (Disinterment Register from Temporary Interment Sites) (disinterment only).
⚫
GCC temporary interment site register (JMAO guidance required).
8-20. Upon receipt of HR, the receiving section will accept all documentation and information. If there is a
DD Form 1075 listing all the believed to be HR present, verify the list of HR being offloaded. Upon
verification, MA personnel sign for the HR on the DD Form 1075. Forms that will not be scanned, or that
may be interred with remains, should be completed legibly in pencil. Avoid using ink; it may smear when
wet, or evaporate and degrade over time to become faint or invisible on paper. Pencil is more enduring and
appears better than ink after many years have passed. For disinterment operations, use DD Form 1079 (see
appendix C for form instructions).
8-21. The MA company conducting the temporary interment or disinterment operations will provide the
JMAO with a memorandum report. The memorandum will be sent to the JMAO through the TMAO for
archiving and disinterment at a future date. The memorandum report will contain the following information:
⚫
Details of the type of operations.
⚫
MA company conducting operations and duty description of any augmenting personnel.
⚫
Site sketch showing GPS reference points, plots, rows, and spaces labeled along with interment or
disinterment records attached.
8-22. Send the memorandum to the TMAO for forwarding to JMAO. Potential future disinterment planning
will rely on archives with this important temporary interment data. Scan all records and ensure the scan is
clear and writing is legible.

INTERMENT TRIGGERS 
8-23. The process of HR decomposition poses a health risk to personnel. It is a biohazard risk in itself, and
can also attract insects and predators that carry transmittable diseases. When the number of HR exceed the
logistical support capabilities required to repatriate them, or if the unit is isolated from the higher HQ,
temporary interment may be necessary.
8-24. Depending upon the time of the year or temperature, units may not need to dig interment trenches. If
temperatures are at or below freezing, the HR will be in a frozen state and interment may not be necessary.
At temperatures below freezing, decomposition will be slowed drastically, and insects, vectors, and predators
will not be attracted to the HR.
Note. Frozen HR sustain cellular damage due to the development of small ice crystals. When 
thawed, HR will begin to rapidly decompose. 
MASS FATALITY ENTRENCHMENT TECHNIQUES 
8-25. When authorized by the GCC, mass fatality entrenchment is part of temporary interment. Planners will
assign this mission to an MA company. Entrenchment requires many resources and synchronization between
MA units and personnel supporting the operation. Responsibilities for this mission are delineated to the MA
company. The NCOIC, and the receiving, administrative, and interment sections will function simultaneously
while receiving and interring HR. The temporary interment site will receive, process, and inter deceased U.S.
military, DOD-affiliated, MNF, local national, and adversary personnel with the associated PE.
SECTION IV – INTERMENT SITE AND PROCEDURES 
8-26. When interment is authorized during large-scale combat operations, establish a temporary interment
site utilizing mass fatality entrenchment. The number of plots depends upon the terrain and the number of
temporary interments.
8-27. The interment site consists of a plot identified by a letter (A through Z, minus the letter I). A plot will
have no more than 10 rows, with each row holding 10 remains (spaces), head to foot, lengthwise, for a total
of 100 remains per plot. When more than 25 plots are required, lettering will continue with AA through ZZ,
AAA through ZZZ, and so on. Mass fatality entrenchment plots are constructed using the following
instructions:
⚫
Use earth-moving equipment if possible as it can open all types of soil with relative ease.
⚫
All rows in a plot should be constructed by digging three feet deep by three feet wide.
⚫
All rows in a plot are approximately 70 feet long (not to exceed 75 feet), as wide as the earth-
moving equipment blade (minimum of 2.5 feet).
⚫
All rows in a plot will have a space of seven feet between rows.
⚫
Ideally, all rows in a plot should be side by side, but may not be if terrain conditions prohibit. (See
figure 8-1 on page 8-6 for a depiction of the site.)
⚫
Do not individually bag disassociated portions recovered from same general location.
⚫
Bag portions recovered from geographically or incidentally distinct areas separately from one
another.
⚫
Do not remove the ID tags or ID card from the HR.

INTERMENT SECTION 
8-31. The interment section will complete the following tasks:
⚫
Coordinate engineer support to manually survey the land, use a drone (if available) to create an
aerial photograph, and to open trenches with earth moving equipment. Refer to ATP 3-34.10 and
ATP 3-34.40/MCWP 3-17.7 to assist when discussing interment instructions with the engineer
platoon leadership.
⚫
Establish a datum point for the first row of each plot by using a metal circle around the metal
stake.
⚫
Mark a ring around each stake at ground level with spray paint.
⚫
Mark interment trenches as indicated on the interment site map with stakes and engineer tape.
⚫
Coordinate with the chaplain for interment rites.
⚫
Receive the HR and any case files from the administrative section.
⚫
Verify the interment processing number with the tag on the remains, HRP, and the GCC temporary
interment site register.
⚫
Receive the plot-row-space assignment from the NCOIC (for example, U.S.-A-9-6):
▪
The plot indicates the category (example, U.S.).
▪
The row indicates what the row number is in the plot (example, 9).
▪
The space indicates location where the HR will be interred in that row (example, space
number 6).
⚫
Place the HR in an HRP or wrap with shrouding material (if not already in an HRP). Attach the
metal tag with the interment processing number to the HR and attach the other tag to the outside
of the HRP or shroud.
⚫
Assign the next available interment site row and space number (for example, Row 9, Space 6), on
the GCC temporary interment site register.
Note: While the receiving section writes the sequential processing number on the GCC temporary 
interment site register, the assignment of the actual plot, row, and space number for the HR should 
not take place until the HR are located at the interment site and assigned a location. 
⚫
Annotate the following on the GCC temporary interment site register:
▪
The plot identifier (United States, MNF Partner, and Enemy), which indicates HR by category
(for example U.S., MNF, E).
▪
The row number in that plot (dependent on space allocated for that plot).

the metal tag to the stake (see figure 8-3):
▪
Engrave the plot indicator to identify the category (U.S., MNF, or Enemy).
▪
Engrave the alphabetical plot designation.
▪
Engrave the row to identify the numbered row in that plot (no more than 10 rows in a plot).
▪
Engrave the calendar year to indicate the calendar year that the interments were done.
⚫
Inter enemy, MNF, and Armed Forces of the U.S. HR in separate rows to aid in later disinterment
operations. When multiple plots are used, it is preferred to dedicate an individual plot to one
category of deceased when possible.
⚫
Enter the plot, row, and space number on the top right-hand corner of DD Form 1076. Place the
HR in the assigned row and space, in a head to foot relationship to other HR. Place all completed
forms in the case folder. Write the believed to be name, DOD ID Number, and SSN of the HR on
the folder label, along with the processing number.
⚫
Move HR feet-first, face-up to the assigned interment space.
⚫
Lower the HR gently into the interment space.
⚫
Close the rows when they are full.
⚫
The appropriate interment officials must fill in the preparing official and verified by fields on the
GCC temporary interment register.
⚫
Safeguard the GCC temporary interment register, maintaining an original and a copy of the
interment register at the interment site facility office.

GUIDANCE ON INTERMENT AND DISINTERMENT OF NON-UNITED STATES MILITARY 
8-33. MA support for military dependents or U.S. civilians accompanying or employed by U.S. forces is
performed in a manner similar to that provided for U.S. military personnel. The same records and reports are
used.
8-34. For multinational operations, the U.S. may or may not be the lead nation for the MNF. Use existing
standardization agreements whenever possible to facilitate common policies and procedures among
participating nations. If agreements do not exist and the U.S. is the lead nation, USG policy and doctrine have
primacy. If agreements do not exist and another nation is charged with lead nation responsibility, U.S. policy
would apply only to U.S. forces and citizens, unless otherwise adopted by the MNF. The GCC should exercise
situational judgment if required to blend MA throughout the MNF.
8-35. The following techniques are applicable where no other guidance is available:
⚫
When possible, complete and maintain the same records and reports as for U.S. military personnel.
⚫
When interment is required, establish separate interment sites for the interment of MNF and enemy
dead. Provide separate sections for U.S., MNF, and enemy deceased when circumstances require
interment in a U.S. temporary interment site.
⚫
PE of MNF personnel is processed IAW standing agreements. In the absence of agreements,
process PE in the same manner as in current MA procedures.
⚫
HR and PE of enemy prisoners of war will be processed IAW the 1949 Geneva Convention (III)
relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.
⚫
Civilian detainees will be processed IAW the 1949 Geneva Convention (IV) relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.
8-36. Personal health and sanitation practices are vitally important, as handling HR in various stages of
decomposition can result in exposure to physical, chemical, and biological hazards.

03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
8-11
8-37. The potential for infection and spread of contagious disease, although low, is always present.
Decedents with blood borne viruses (hepatitis or human immunodeficiency), tuberculosis, or diarrheal
disease have a higher chance of spreading infection than those with epidemic-causing infections such as
plague, cholera, typhoid, or anthrax.
8-38. Most infectious organisms do not survive beyond 48 hours with exceptions such as human
immunodeficiency virus. Therefore, personnel handling or working in the areas where HR have been must
be conscious of sanitation hazards and keep themselves and their work areas clean.
8-39. To prevent the contraction or spread of infection, personnel handling HR should adhere to the
following health and sanitation guidelines:
⚫
Wear disposable surgical gloves, N-95 respirator or surgical masks, aprons or over-garments, and
eye protection at all times. Change the gloves after each use and dispose of properly in a biohazard
bag.
⚫
Scrub hands, forearms, and any other body portion that came into contact with the HR or the bodily
fluids of the HR. Use a medicated or disinfectant soap.
⚫
Avoid wiping the face or mouth with hands.
⚫
Shower, cleansing the entire body, including the hair at the end of the duty day in which HR were
handled.
⚫
Dispose of all contaminated protective equipment IAW local policy.
⚫
Wash and disinfect all equipment, clothing, and vehicles that came into contact with HR or fluids
of the HR thoroughly.
⚫
Maintain current vaccinations recommended for medical personnel and first responders.
Identification, Personal Effects, and Records of Human Remains 
8-40. When the HR identity is known, the case file associated with the HR should be labeled as believed to
be and the name of the deceased. All PE will stay on the HR when interment occurs. Maintain the case file
in the administrative section of the interment site.
Unidentified Human Remains 
8-41. Process unidentified HR in the same manner that would be done processing an unknown fatality at an
MACP or TMEP.
Enemy/Adversary/Unknown Detainees 
8-42. All enemy HR should be collected, processed, and given the same dignity, reverence, and respect that
would be given to U.S. military HR. Coordination for repatriation or return of the HR to an enemy or
adversary should be coordinated with the guidance of the JMAO. Record and turn over all records to the joint
MA office for disposition.
CLOSING THE SITE 
8-43. When all interments have been completed in each row, the row may be refilled. A bucket loader-type
vehicle should be used for refill. Care should be taken not to drive over the rows, even after they have been
refilled:
⚫
Mark the beginning and end of each row with a metal stake. The stake should extend into the
ground at least two feet, and two feet should be left above ground.
⚫
Securely affix a metal tag to each stake indicating the row number. Use a GPS device (if available)
to determine the location of each row and record it on GCC temporary interment register.
⚫
Hand-carry all forms and records by special courier to the JMAO or TMAO. The JMAO or TMAO
will provide one copy of all records of HN or adversary interments to the HN government.
8-44. All interments conducted by U.S. forces will be maintained by the JMAO for later disposition.

OTHER TYPES OF INTERMENT 
8-45. Other types of interment are emergency burial, individual graves, and burial at sea. TTPs for CBRN
temporary interment operations are being developed at the time of this publication and are not included within
this chapter.
EMERGENCY BURIAL 
8-46. Emergency graves are shallow graves used only when extracting the HR is not possible due to tactical
constraints. Shallow graves should be dug just enough to obscure the HR from sight. Forward the coordinates
of the site to a higher command so they may be recorded for future recovery operations. Emergency war
burial procedures can also be found in Allied Tactical Publication-92.
INDIVIDUAL GRAVES 
8-47. Individual shallow graves are constructed to prevent leaving HR unattended in open areas when no
other method of interment or means of transporting the casualty to a mortuary affairs collection point is
possible. All PE and other ID media should be interred with the HR. Leave any ID tags or ID cards on the
HR. Be sure to mark the interment site for future recovery teams and forward the location to higher HQ for
record keeping. Individual graves are used in an organized fashion in the manner that any cemetery is
organized. Only remove unit property or classified documents for safeguarding and transfer back to the unit,
or to an intelligence officer for reviewing sensitive media.
BURIAL AT SEA 
8-48. When the death occurs aboard ship or the HR are recovered from the sea, the HR should be preserved
for burial on land. Burial at sea should only be used as a last resort when refrigerated storage facilities are
unavailable aboard ship and transfer to an MA site on land cannot be accomplished within a reasonable time,
or when current conditions do not permit access to land. The authority for final determination of burial at sea
resides with the commanding officer of the ship.
SECTION V – DISINTERMENT PROCEDURES 
8-49. The purpose of disinterment operations is to return all fallen Service members back to CONUS.
Disinterment operations should be conducted as soon as the tactical situation permits. When the order to
disinter remains from the temporary interment site is given, it is important that heavy equipment not be used
past the first 18 inches of dirt. After removing the first 18 inches, small hand tools and fine-scale excavation
methods should be used. If HR are not in the marked area or HRP damage is noticed, conduct a search of the
surrounding area for any evidence of bone matter or PE. The HR should be disinterred on a first in-first out
basis.
8-50. Disinterment techniques are carried out in the reverse order of interment operations (see previous
section). Instructions for completing DD Form 1079 for disinterment are located in appendix C in this
publication.
8-51. When all disinterment operations are complete, it is the responsibility of the unit operating the site to
restore the land so it may be returned to the HN in the same manner it was received. This process, known as
transferring the land, must be properly coordinated through the JMAO.
8-52. Whenever personnel are conducting disinterment operations, they should wear N-95 high efficiency
particulate air respirators, gloves, aprons, and other types of protective clothing IAW Service health and
safety guidance.
8-53. Once in the general area of the interment site, use a GPS device in conjunction with maps to determine
the exact location of each row.
8-54. A chaplain or RMT, if present, may offer a prayer or other appropriate religious support. If not, the
senior military person may lead those present in 60 seconds of silence, with bowed heads, as a memorial.
Perform the following disinterment procedures:

03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
8-13
⚫
Open the row from either end. Using a backhoe and digging with care, the operator may dig down
approximately 18 inches. Multiple rows may be opened simultaneously depending on the
availability of equipment. Dig the remaining depth with hand tools so as not to mutilate the HR.
⚫
Remove the dirt from all sides of the HR carefully. Look for the metal tag that was pinned to the
outside of the HRP or shroud.
⚫
Match the number on the tag to the GCC temporary interment register processing number recorded
during interment operations.
⚫
Complete the DD Form 1079 (front side of the form for that plot and row). Prepare processing tag
in the same manner as in interment operations. Attach this tag to the HRP or shroud.
⚫
Sift the soil in the immediate area for skeletal anatomy and PE if the HRP or shroud is not intact.
⚫
Place the HRP with the HR on a litter and remove from the interment site.
⚫
Refill all rows and return the area as closely as possible to the original condition after all rows
have been opened and the HR removed. Process the HR at an MACP adjacent to the disinterment
site.
8-55. The NCOIC will report through command channels to the JMAO or TMAO when all HR have been
disinterred from the interment site and will include the condition of the restored land being vacated in this
report. Upon closure of the disinterment site, the NCOIC is responsible for delivering all disinterment records
to the JMAO. Once a site has been evacuated, the JMAO or TMAO is responsible for turning the land back
to the appropriate host government agency. If HR from other nations are still buried at the site, maintain the
site if operationally feasible or until custody of the site can be turned over to the appropriate government.
8-56. The use of non-military MA support, host-nation support, and local or third-country national support
should be limited to general labor, administration, transportation, and facility support. Only U.S. military,
U.S. government civilians, or DOD CAAF should be used to conduct interment processing of U.S. remains
and inventory of PE. Theater-specific Logistics Civil Augmentation Program agreements will identify MA
functions to be performed by CAAF. If an agreement cannot be negotiated, MA support is performed under
current U.S. military procedures.

MAJOR ARMY COMMAND, ARMY SERVICE COMPONENT COMMAND, AND DIRECT
REPORTING UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES 
9-3. Due to the unique structure of the MA evacuation channel, MA generally operates within a JOA. GCCs
assign lead Service common-user logistics responsibilities, normally through the contingency planning
process, in order to achieve efficiencies and eliminate redundancies. They usually assign lead Service
responsibilities to the dominant user or most capable Service for a particular common supply item or Service.
In many cases, the Army serves as the lead Service for common-user logistics and other support such as MA
within a joint force or MNF.
9-4. Theater Army planners play a critical role in shaping support by leveraging MA resources for
integration in the JOA. In addition to the capabilities provided by the lead Service, a GCC will exercise
directive authority for logistics. This ensures necessary logistics directives, including peacetime measures,
are issued to subordinate commanders to ensure the effective execution of approved operation plans
(OPLANs).
ARMY SERVICE COMPONENT COMMAND 
9-5. The ASCC for a GCC enables interagency access, sets the theater, enables expeditionary maneuver,
and protects joint bases, nodes, and networks. The ASCC sets the conditions for operational and tactical
convergence by calibrating force posture with CCMDs, the Joint Staff, and HQDA to ensure that required
multi-Service MA supplies and capabilities are in the theater and accessible. The ASCC MA officer and NCO
work closely with the JMAO and the TMAO providing theater policy and guidance for all MA operations in
the JOA.
9-6. The commanders will—
⚫
Execute ASCC Title 10 responsibilities, HQDA and CCMD mission assignments for MA, enforce
the administration of the DOD MA policy, and ensure the processes are compliant with policies
and mandatory tasks established in AR 638-2 and this publication.
⚫
Establish an MA lead Service office to provide control and coordination of MA support.
⚫
Establish a TMAO to provide control and coordination of MA support.
⚫
Execute duties, when tasked as MA lead Service office.
⚫
Coordinate MA actions and planning with the JMAO and TMAO.
⚫
Enable subordinate commanders to train basic MA tasks on handling and evacuating HR and PE
IAW policy, procedures, and standards in this publication.
⚫
Establish disaster MA response teams to recover DOD-affiliated HR and PE at multiple fatality
incidents within their geographic AOR.
⚫
Establish a TPED to support the transfer of PE for Army and Army-sponsored personnel.
⚫
Maintain accuracy of reports for fatalities and associated PE by monitoring DCIPS and MARTS.
⚫
Maintain liaison with, and provide MA information to, all Army units, installations, activities, and
MTFs within the AOR.
⚫
Maintain the required theater quantity stocks for MA (transfer cases, HRPs, PE bags, and MA PPE
items).
⚫
Maintain reports for MA common user equipment, operational contract, and maintenance support
for MA facilities within the JOA.
⚫
Maintain an MA office in the G-4 logistics operations supply and services directorate with an
officer and NCO:
▪
Mortuary affairs officers (MAOs) Army logistics officer 90A92 with additional skill identifier
4V, major (O-4) or an Army civilian equivalent with this additional duty.
▪
Senior MA Sergeant, MOS 92M5O2S (additional skill identifier 2S for battle staff qualified),
master sergeant (E-8).
Note. All ASCCs are authorized an Army 92M Master Sergeant (E8), except for U.S. Army North, 
which is authorized an Army civilian as the MAO.

MAO (U.S. Army Europe, U.S. Army South, and U.S. Army Africa). 
9-7. See FM 3-94 and ATP 3-93 for more information on ASCCs.
STAFF PLANNER RESPONSIBILITIES 
9-8. Army MAOs serving as MA staff planners are—
⚫
Army MA-qualified officers with an additional skill identifier 4V.
⚫
Commissioned and warrant officers.
⚫
DOD civilians serving in the capacity of an MAO with the additional skill identifier 4V.
⚫
MOS 92M NCOs who are battle staff qualified with additional skill identifier 2S.
9-9. MA NCO staff planners serve on logistics command staffs at all levels from battalion to theater Army.
Their responsibilities include—
⚫
Planning the employment of assigned MA assets.
⚫
Providing advice to commanders on MA operations.
⚫
Developing and reviewing operational plans for military operations supporting Army forces across
the JOA.
⚫
Identifying the priority and movement of logistics support for each phase of the MA concept for
proper execution.
⚫
Ensuring their concept/plan nests with that of their higher HQ to incorporate simultaneity, depth,
synchronization, and flexibility to employ MA resources properly.
9-10. MA planners must train to anticipate and understand the support requirements of the tactical plan or
the independent course of action. Additionally, MA planners must be able to assess sustainment feasibility
while identifying support requirements for synchronization with the commander’s intent. For this reason,
commands must ensure these planners attend the SPO and battle staff courses to enhance the overall
sustainment planning capability within the SPO.
9-11. Staff planners developing MA plans must be aware of several factors that affect MA activities and
operations. These factors include—
⚫
The type of conflict (regional or global).
⚫
The size of the theater of operations (TO) and corresponding lines of communication for a
contiguous AO, or lack of lines of communication for a noncontiguous AO.
⚫
The logistics resources available, including assets within the AOR, existing contingency contracts,
pre-positioned assets, and assets within the time-phased force and deployment data.
⚫
The level of infrastructure development, including fixed facilities for mortuaries and airfields for
evacuation.
⚫
Fatality estimates and MA team requirements for different levels of support.
⚫
The MA assets to support the commander’s intent and concept of operations.
⚫
The procedures for reporting war crimes and violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice
and the Geneva and Hague Conventions.
⚫
Temporary storage (requested through the TMAO or JMAO) for contaminated HR if MACRMS
has not been established.
⚫
MACRMS personnel requirements.
9-12. For more information on sustainment, see ADP 4-0 and FM 4-0.
9-13. Staff planners are crucial in developing the operational concept and initiating the entire planning
process. The MA staff officer or NCO responsibilities include—

9-15. Staff planners will ensure non-MA company level units are involved in the MA mission or operation.
Unit commanders must identify unit recovery teams within their AO. Unit recovery teams must be briefed
on the local customs and courtesies for dealing with HR. The teams are trained to the MA standard by the
MA liaison officer at the lowest echelon available, with the understanding that all HR are treated with the
utmost dignity, reverence, and respect. For more information on non-MA unit responsibilities, see chapter 4.

Mortuary Affairs Staff Planners in Multi-Service Positions 
9-18. In the JOA, Army MA staff planners organize, plan, train, and execute operations with a common
language that is clearly articulated and universally understood. Within the JMAO, the MAO and MA staff
planners are assigned to the J-4. The MA staff planners will—
⚫
Maintain a centralized office that oversees MA operations to provide oversight of, coordinate, and
manage MA support within their AOR.
⚫
Give direction and guidance on providing MA support to all assigned and attached forces
physically present in their AOR.
⚫
Develop and provide input to the Appendix 1 (Mortuary Affairs) to Annex C (Distribution
Network Processes) of the theater distribution plan for operational controls in their AOR.
⚫
Provide information and submit reports on MA support for Army forces; develop Tab H (Mortuary
Affairs) of Appendix 1 (Logistics), Annex F (Sustainment) of the operations order.
⚫
Monitor DCIPS and MARTS for accuracy to report on fatalities and associated PE in the
command.
9-19. For more information on the operation order, OPLAN, and concept plan formats, see CJCS GDE 3130,
JP 4-0, Appendix M, JP 5-0, Appendix A, and FM 6-0.
COMMAND AND SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS 
9-20. Clearly defined command and support relationships throughout the AO are critical for providing
effective MA support. Army command relationships indicated in this chapter will highlight the type of
support to MA along with the command responsibility and authority. Army support relationships define the
purpose, scope, and effect desired when one capability supports another.
9-21. Army command relationships define superior and subordinate relationships for unit commanders. By
specifying a chain of command, these relationships unify effort and provide maximum flexibility to
commanders employing MA forces. They also identify the authorities and degree of control of the gaining
commander. The type of command relationship selected often relates to the expected longevity of the
relationship between the units involved, and determines the administrative and logistics support
responsibilities for both the gaining and losing commanders. (For more information on Army command
relationships, see FM 4-0.)
9-22. Army command relationships include—
⚫
Organic: assigned to and forming an essential part of a military organization (table of organization
and equipment).
⚫
Assigned: unit stays subordinate to the higher HQ (years).
⚫
Attached: unit temporarily subordinate to the gaining HQ (months).
⚫
Operational control: gives gaining commanders the authority to assign missions and further task-
organize forces placed under their control (specific mission).
⚫
Tactical control: gives gaining commanders the authority to assign missions, but not further task-
organizing forces placed under their tactical control (specific mission).
9-23. A support relationship is established between superior and subordinate commanders when one
organization should aid, protect, complement, or sustain another force on a temporary basis. Designating
support relationships is an important aspect of C2 that provides a flexible means of establishing and changing
priorities with minimal additional instruction. Each Army support relationship identifies specific authorities
and responsibilities between the supported and supporting units, including which unit has the authority to
United States Army Mortuary Affairs

9-7
sustain, establish communication with, position, and set priorities for the supporting force. (See FM 4-0 for 
more information.) 
9-24. For example, when establishing an AO or a JOA within a theater, the ASCC commander establishes
support priorities IAW ARFOR requirements to achieve the GCC objectives. The ARFOR and the TSC
establish a support relationship that permits the TSC to employ theater-wide MA resources to provide timely,
responsive operational-level support to the Army forces (ADP 5-0). Figure 9-3 depicts command and support
relationships for MA support.
9-25. Examples of support relationships could include—
⚫
A sustainment element (TMEP) in general support of multiple units employed in the JOA having
priorities of support established by its parent unit (associated with the TSC TMAO).
⚫
An MACP attached to a BSB in direct support of the BSA. The maneuver unit establishes priorities
and the BSB synchronizes support with the BCT for MA support.
9-26. The following list identifies the four Army support relationships and provides MA-related examples:
⚫
DS: MACP providing MA support to the BSB for a BCT.
⚫
GS: TMEP providing MA support to the TSC in the JSA.
⚫
Reinforcing: reallocating resources, normally provides additional MA assets to the decisive
operation.
⚫
GS-reinforcing support: MA platoons standing by in the JSA or corps support area for further
assignment.

Corps Headquarters 
9-27. The corps HQ is organized, trained, and equipped to serve as ARFOR in campaigns and major
operations, with command of two or more Army divisions, together with supporting theater-level
organizations, across the range of military operations. As the ARFOR for the joint force command, the corps
serves as an operational-level HQ, conducting land operations as the Service component command. A corps
Chapter 9 
9-8
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
can control up to five Army divisions in large-scale combat operations and normally has one ESC in direct 
support. Other theater-level assets are attached as required. The corps HQ organizational structure allows it 
to adapt to operational or tactical-level roles, depending upon the GCC’s requirements (FM 3-94). 
9-28. The corps has the following organic MA personnel:
⚫
Corps MAO, Captain (O-3), serving in the G-4.
⚫
No authorized MA NCO.
Theater Sustainment Command 
9-29. The TSC is the ASCC’s common-user logistics provider within the TO. The TSC is responsible for
providing the ASCC with a common logistical picture, establishing the TMAO, and ensuring that the flow
of MA assets into theater is timed properly. The GCC (JMAO) and the ASCC (MA lead Service office)
directives must specify the authorities delegated to the TSC as well as the importance of the delineation of
responsibilities between them. The theater MA concept of operations, OPLAN, and operations orders
delineate responsibilities between the ASCC and TSC so the joint functions are clearly explained to the
supported units in the AOR. The TMAO will control the Army theater MA mission, request for forces, and
employ MA resources per the GCC and ASCC directives.
9-30. An MA company is normally assigned to the TSC but can be temporarily assigned to the highest
sustainment echelon in the AO until the TSC establishes a forward presence. One MA company can support
a three-division corps. It can provide DS to the corps BCTs with 12 forward MACPs and can also provide
reinforcing support for a main MACP in the corps support area. The TSC assigns MA teams to support the
corps AO, with planners positioning MA units to support corps, division, and brigade support areas. One MA
company is allocated per corps. AC MA companies are capable of establishing, operating, and maintaining
up to 16 MACPs; RC MA companies can establish, operate, and maintain up to 20 MACPs.
9-31. Individual sections may detach from the MA company and operate separately as the mission and
logistics requirements dictate. This allows supported units the flexibility required to operate effectively
within the AO. The MA company operations section is attached to the TSC special troops battalion and
performs duties with the TMAO staff, providing additional QM functional expertise. It is responsible for the
oversight of all MA assets in the TO, including tracking HR and PE to the CONUS port mortuary and the
JPED using DCIPS and MARTS. However, the increased modularity places additional responsibility upon
MA staff officers to produce and maintain accurate MA estimates. The estimates prepared are for planning
both the timeline and the number of assets deploying.
9-32. The MA company, minus the operations section, will be attached to the combat sustainment support
battalion (CSSB). The MA company minus is positioned to support the mission of the TMAO within the
JSA. Two MA platoons will establish and operate the TMEP and TPED (if required), while the two remaining
MA platoons go forward to support the corps, divisions, and BCTs with MACPs.
9-33. The TSC monitors the MA mission across the AOR, providing the ESC MA staff with the concept of
sustainment for future operations. During certain operations, MA staff may recommend holding specific
administrative or management functions at the TSC level or may augment the ESC. This recommendation
will depend on an assessment of mission and operational variables. For more information on the TSC and
ESC, see ATP 4-94. The TMAO—
⚫
Establishes theater MA policies, procedures, and reports for the MA lead Service office and
JMAO.
⚫
Recommends redistribution of MA assets throughout theater as required.
⚫
Monitors and manages MA-specific equipment and supply stockage levels throughout theater.
⚫
Monitors DCIPS for accuracy of fatality reporting, manages the MARTS operators, and delineates
responsibilities for the MA facilities throughout the TO (see appendix B in this publication).
⚫
Identifies transportation requirements for movement of HR and PE.
⚫
Tracks HR movement throughout the TO, and to the designated CONUS port mortuary using
DCIPS, MARTS, USTRANSCOM Single Mobility System, and RFID information.
⚫
Manages and tracks PE cases in the theater using MARTS and RFID.

⚫
Operations NCO: Staff sergeant (E-6) automated logistics supply NCO with MOS 92A3O.
⚫
Shower and Laundry NCO: Sergeant (E-5) with MOS 92S2O.
⚫
MA Specialist: E-4 or below with MOS 92M1O.
Expeditionary Sustainment Command 
9-36. ESC MA staff personnel are assigned to the distribution management center, SPO field services
section. This section operates in the corps support area and plans, recommends resourcing, monitors, and
analyzes field services support to deployed Army forces. The ESC, in coordination with the TSC TMAO and
the JMAO, determines the requirements for and placement of Army theater MA assets. Requirement and
placement considerations include fatality estimates from the ASCC operations and plans section, force
structure, and the MA concept of logistics support. When tasked, or in absence of the TSC, the ESC acts as
the TMAO to facilitate the processes involved with evacuating HR and PE from the theater.
9-37. When the ESC MA office is responsible for the theater MA mission, the MA company operations
section provides the same augmentation to the ESC staff as it does to the TMAO. The operations section is
attached to the CSSB and performs duties with the ESC MA staff. The ESC MA staff consists of only two
personnel:
⚫
MAO: Army logistics major (O-4) with MOS 90A92 and additional skill identifier 4V
⚫
Senior Mortuary Staff NCO: Sergeant first class (E-7) with MOS 92M4O2S.
9-38. The ESC MA staff planner duties include, but are not limited to, the following:
⚫
Recommend redistribution of MA assets throughout the TO, as required.
⚫
Monitor and manage MA-specific equipment and supply stockage levels throughout the theater.
⚫
Process flight requests; track HR movement throughout the TO and to the designated CONUS
port mortuary.
⚫

9-44. The MA staff NCOs that perform those functions are—
⚫
Supporting brigades; 92M MA NCO, Staff Sergeant/E-6 or Sergeant/E-5, varies by the table of
organization and equipment (TO&E).
⚫
BCT (Armored, Infantry, Stryker); BSB; 92M MA NCO.
Combat Sustainment Support Battalion 
9-45. CSSBs may have Army QM MA companies, platoons, or teams assigned or attached to perform a
variety of MA functions (for example MACP, TMEP, TPED, or MACRMS). These elements may augment
corps and division MA staff sections. Theater MA assets and companies remain consolidated at a higher level
until required. The CSSB has C2 responsibility for the Army QM MA company at the JSA or in the corps
AO, and task organizes MA units to conduct operations as required (see ATP 4-93.1). There are no organic
MA personnel on the CSSB staff.
9-46. Coordination through the CSSB logistics officer is vitally important for additional MA logistical
requirements, medical supplies, and supplemental transportation for evacuating HR from the MTF to the

AND ALLOCATION 
9-47. Army MA specialist, MOS 92M, is a low-density career field managed by the Army QM proponent.
The 92M critical mission is to ensure the U.S. Army carries out DOD directives to handle all fatalities with
dignity, reverence, and respect.
9-48. Within the MA force structure, MA specialists assigned to the AC, RC, and National Guard contribute
to the overall MA mission. The following are authorized 92M positions:
⚫
Army MA specialists assigned to work in an Army mortuary.
⚫
Armed Forces Medical Examiner System.
⚫
Joint personal effects depot.
⚫
Observer controller/trainer, combat training center.
⚫
Defense Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Accounting Agency.
⚫

⚫
MOS instructor.
⚫
MA staff planners (all echelons, all components).
⚫
MA company (first sergeant, platoon sergeant, section chief, MA collection team leader).
⚫
MA detachment (Army liaison team).
MORTUARY AFFAIRS COMPANY MISSION 
9-49. The MA company mission is to perform a full range of MA operations and provide tailored support
for unified land operations and large-scale combat operations in the JOA. MA company personnel conduct
search, recovery, and evacuation operations for deceased U.S. military and designated U.S. civilian and allied
personnel, receive and process PE, and maintain essential records and reports. The MA company is designed
to be modular, maintaining the ability to deploy at the team level. This modularity is essential to support the
Army and provide GS for the other Services when requested. Each MA platoon can perform any of the MA
tasks in support of decisive action, but cannot perform all tasks concurrently.
9-50. The MA company as a whole can perform several MA functions with each platoon providing a
different capability. Performing either the TMEP or MACRMS mission greatly reduces the ability to provide
other MA functions.
DEPLOYMENT ROTATIONS 
9-51. QM MA company elements deploy for 6-month rotations if actively conducting MA operations during
extended deployments. This methodology has reduced the post-traumatic stress disorder cases among MA
personnel. Leaders must ensure that their personnel are allowed to properly decompress after deployments
and should coordinate with the local chaplain and behavioral health team to plan and implement a
decompression program. Leaders should also maintain a resiliency program that promotes physical and
mental fitness and a healthy lifestyle. For more information on resilience, see appendix A in this publication.
MISSION-ESSENTIAL TASKS 
9-52. The Army QM MA company has two different configurations, but they have identical mission-
essential task lists (see table 9-1 on page 9-12). The mission essential tasks for collective training can be
found on the Army Knowledge Online, Army Training Network, and Combined Arms Training Strategies
web sites. Web site URLs are provided in the references section of this publication.

MORTUARY AFFAIRS PLATOON AND SECTION MISSIONS 
9-57. The QM MA company design allows it to tailor support and attach capabilities throughout the AO.
COMPANY HEADQUARTERS PLATOON 
9-58.  The company HQ section provides C2 and administrative and logistical support to the company and
any attached elements operating within the company. In the deployment phase, the commander and first
sergeant may deploy ahead of the company as an early entry module with other advance forces to allocate
and place the MA unit for integration within the JOA.
9-59. The maintenance section provides unit-level maintenance management, direct maintenance
supervision of the company subordinate elements, equipment repair, and vehicle recovery. The MA company
commander will place and assign maintenance personnel with forward deployed elements for best support to
the MA teams or facilities.
9-60. The operations section is comprised of Soldiers and NCOs from across all the major functional
proponents within the QM discipline to provide subject matter expertise to complement the first sergeant.
Upon arrival as an early entry module or advance party, this section integrates with the TSC MA section to
be a cell for the support operations division. Once integrated, this cell acts as a coordination and logistics hub
for the assignment and placement of all Army MA assets going through the reception, staging, onward
movement, and integration into the JOA. Once all company MA assets are in position, this section is
responsible for the oversight and overall execution of the MA mission at the corps level.
MORTUARY AFFAIRS PLATOON HEADQUARTERS 
9-61. The MA platoon HQ provides supervision, coordination, and scheduling for MA operational elements
of the platoon. The platoon HQ can also serve as an early entry module for the MA company or MA platoon
to allocate or place MA assets on the battlefield.
MORTUARY AFFAIRS PLATOON COLLECTION TEAMS 
9-62. The collection team conducts limited search, recovery, and evacuation operations of deceased U.S.
military, certain U.S. civilian personnel, and allied personnel. Each MA team is capable of receiving,

03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
9-15
inventorying, and coordinating the evacuation of deceased personnel and their PE. The teams may be 
combined for modular support to perform MACP, MA transfer point, main collection point, TMEP, TPED, 
or MACRMS operations. The platoon can be tasked to perform any one task. It cannot perform the tasks 
concurrently. 
9-63. A MA collection team consists of six personnel with a dedicated MIRCS and prime mover (M1120A4
truck palletized load handling system). The team can temporarily store 15 HR in refrigeration and process up
to 20 HR per day. The MA collection teams are capable of processing HR in fixed facilities, tents, MIRCS,
or makeshift MACPs.
ASSIGNMENT AND DEPENDENCIES 
9-64. The following paragraphs discuss the characteristics for assigning and allocating an Army MA
company throughout the AO.
ASSIGNMENT 
9-65.  MA units are assigned to a CSSB or DSB. When performing MACP operations, the MA collection
teams may be attached to a supported BCT (see chapter 5). Within the DSA, the DSB serves as the C2 for
the MA company and works with the TMAO to employ MA assets in support of the theater MA mission.
Commanders and staff planners must understand the MA company’s ability to accomplish their TO&E
mission. Tasking the MACP with performing additional duties and responsibilities outside of its scope will
have a severe degradative impact on the MACP mission.
9-66. The MA company commander or a designated representative must continually inform the chain of
command about current responsibilities and the capabilities of the unit. The chain of command should know
how any additionally assigned responsibilities affect the ability of the MA company to adapt and flex to
future operations. Upon a full MA company deployment, a DSB receives an MA platoon. This platoon
provides forward MACPs to support each BCT with an MA team to stay in the division support area.
DEPENDENCIES 
9-67. The QM MA company is dependent upon—
⚫
Appropriate elements of the division, corps, or theater for religious, legal, engineer, EOD, medical
support (including role 1-3, behavioral health support, and operational public health for biohazard
management guidance), finance, personnel and administrative services, supplemental
transportation support, and QM supply company support to establish the TPED.
⚫
The CBRN company to provide augmentation personnel for the contamination mitigation of
personnel and equipment and CBRN technical support to the MA company. The CBRN company
assists with the mitigation and monitoring of chemically, biologically, or radiologically
contaminated HR during the tentative ID process at a MACRMS.
⚫
A field feeding company or supported BCT for field feeding support.
⚫
GCC theater support for a MACRMS, including specialized personnel (AFMES, Federal Bureau
of Investigation, and medical), additional refrigeration capability, additional containers for above
ground storage, and transportation assets to evacuate HR for large-scale combat operations.
⚫
The ASCC theater MA lead for theater project stock of HRTC, IHRTCs, HRPs, PE Bags, MA
supplies and PPE for all MA facilities supporting the JOA.
MOBILITY 
9-68. The MA company requires 100 percent mobility of its TO&E to be transported in a single lift using
organic vehicles. The unit can deploy the MA platoons separately but do not have all the company resources
to accompany the MA platoons.
9-69. The MA company can conduct intra-theater transport of 100 percent of its TO&E equipment and
supplies in a single lift by using its authorized organic transportation assets with supplemental transportation.
Chapter 9 
9-16
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
EMPLOYMENT 
9-70. The MA company will deploy and establish operations in theater as required by the GCC, and IAW
the theater Army priorities established by the TMAO. The company establishes MA activities and conducts
operations in the JSA, DSA, and BSA.
BASIS OF ALLOCATION 
9-71. The MA company supports deployed forces with a variety of MA operations during contingency, large-
scale combat operations, and DSCA missions, as required. One MA company will be allocated per corps and
each MA platoon will support a division. The division positions the MA teams to provide DS to the BCT
from the BSA. Based on mission requirements and the duration of the fight, an additional MA company can
augment the corps and call forward MA platoons for reinforcing support to the divisions.
9-72. The Army has two AC and six RC MA companies. Figure 9-6 below depicts all the locations of the
MA units. The RC MA company in Hawaii has MA platoons dispersed throughout the pacific.
Figure 9-6. Army mortuary affairs company locations 
MORTUARY AFFAIRS COMPANY CAPABILITIES 
9-73. The RC MA company is capable of establishing up to 20 MACPs (16 for AC). Additionally, the
company is able to establish a main collection point and provide MA staff augmentation to supported corps
and division HQ. Each MACP is capable of processing up to 20 HR per day, which includes the receipt,
processing, and evacuation of HR along with all associated PE. The main collection point is capable of
receiving and managing remains and PE received from the forward MACPs on a 24-hour basis. When called
forward, the company operations section is able to act as the early entry module to assist the TSC with the
reception, staging, onward movement, and integration of MA units.

03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
9-17
9-74. Operational capabilities drop significantly if the MA company is also tasked to conduct S&R, operate
a TMEP, conduct MACRMS operations, or temporary interment and disinterment operations. The MA
company can—
⚫
Establish MACP locations. May establish a main collection point at corps or division level when
required and evacuate fatalities to the TMEP.
⚫
Operate a TMEP with the ability to process up to 250 HR per day to the CONUS port mortuary.
⚫
Establish a TPED.
⚫
Provide limited support for deliberate S&R, including contaminated HR recovery operations.
⚫
Recover, secure, account for, and evacuate PE with the HR.
⚫
Operate a MACRMS.
⚫
Provide theater-level MA support to other Services.
⚫
Maintain essential records and reports.
⚫
Perform field maintenance on all organic equipment, except communications security equipment.
9-75. The MA company is capable of providing its own unit maintenance (minus communications security
equipment). When co-located with the command being supported, the supported unit must provide any
required external maintenance. The unit maintenance section requires maintenance contact team support for
MIRCS maintenance while deployed.
9-76. The JMAO or the MA lead Service office manages MA-controlled supplies and equipment and
forwards to the MA activities. They may forward reusable controlled items (for example, transfer cases) to
the MACP level based upon the situation and AO. The MA company has minimal capability for
contamination mitigation operations in a CBRN environment. The MA unit relies on the supported element
to provide operational decontamination and the CBRN company for thorough decontamination of personnel
and equipment.
9-77. The MACPs may operate out of a MIRCS. The MACP should not move until all HR have been
processed and evacuated. However, when the MACP operates out of a MIRCS, the MACP may relocate prior
to evacuation of the HR onboard, if required. Priority is to evacuate the HR to the rear where the TMEP is
located as well as the APOE for transportation to the CONUS port mortuary for final disposition. The Army
MA companies have the MIRCS authorized as common user equipment. (See chapter 5 for more details on
this equipment.)
9-78. When refrigeration of HR is required, the following apply:
⚫
The refrigeration unit should be clean, and temperature should be maintained between 34-40
degrees Fahrenheit, to prevent freezing and/or advance decomposition, as indicated in TG 195A
and TM 10-4110-263-10.
⚫
The MA leaders must use the first-in, first-out concept for the placement of HR in refrigeration.
⚫
MA refrigeration is not a storage unit; do not factor this equipment into planning estimates for
additional storage.
⚫
Place no other items, such as class I (food and perishables) or Class VIII (medical supplies) in MA
refrigeration assets.
⚫
If additional refrigeration is required, the NCOIC should contact the BSB SPO or division G-4 to
initiate augmentation by external units or local contract.
⚫
According to TM 10-4110-263-10, the MIRCS consists of 16 morgue tray compartments but can
only hold 15 intact HR. The top right tray is partially blocked by a refrigeration conductor.
However, HR portions or PE that are soiled with blood borne pathogens can be stored in this
compartment awaiting evacuation.
⚫
The refrigeration unit strictly holds HR until they can be processed or evacuated.
⚫
If military working dogs or other government-owned animal remains will be stored in a
refrigeration unit with DOD-affiliated HR they must be isolated from HR unless the remains are
comingled with the military working dog or other government owned animal remains (for
example, IED incident). Working animal remains will be processed IAW AR 40-
905/SECNAVINST 6401.1B/AFI 48-131, and DAFI 31-121/AR 700-81/OPNAVINST
5585.2C/MCO 5585.6.

03 August 2022 
⚫
Four temporary HR holding shelters are supplied with the MIRCS. Each ambient temperature,
non-refrigerated shelter is capable of holding six HR for a total of 24 HR, see figure 23 in TM 10-
4110-263-10 (for MIRCS operational characteristics, see chapter 5 in this publication).
MORTUARY AFFAIRS COMPANY REQUIRED SUPPORT 
9-79. MA company support requirements include—
⚫
Life support.
⚫
Field feeding support.
⚫
General logistics support (water, fuel, and replenish MA supplies).
⚫
External maintenance (including refrigeration) support.
⚫
Religious ministry support.
⚫
Health service support.
⚫
Force health protection (for example, behavioral health, operational public health, and preventive
medicine).
⚫
Legal support.
⚫
Finance.
⚫
Engineer.
⚫
EOD support.
⚫
CBRN personnel and equipment decontamination.
⚫
Additional transportation.
⚫
Unit-level communications security maintenance.
⚫
Automation and cyber support.
⚫
Ice support or ice-making capability (if situation allows).
MORTUARY AFFAIRS OPERATIONS 
9-80. Upon deployment, the MA company commander and first sergeant must work closely with the TSC,
G-4, and sustainment operations division. This coordination provides MA leaders visibility of the
transportation, personnel, and logistics assets available throughout the AO to resolve issues. It also allows
the leadership to mitigate any MA issues, specifically those concerning transportation, communications, and
command and support relationships.
9-81. MA leaders must continually produce logistics estimates in order to identify operational shortfalls that
impact availability of personnel and equipment. Before deploying to a specific JOA, the commander or a
designated representative must coordinate with the TSC. The key areas to coordinate are synchronizing the
TPFFD, matching unit personnel to equipment, and identifying equipment shortfalls. MA leaders should—
⚫
Coordinate daily with the appropriate individuals who have oversight for MA issues and continued
support.
⚫
Attend recurring briefings to obtain current and vital information needed to make informed MA
decisions.
⚫
Provide the SPO in the supported command with accurate flow of information on MA issues.
⚫
Safeguard fatality information (treat as sensitive information).
9-82. Upon arrival at a new location, the MACP NCOIC will notify both the supported unit and the TMAO.
The supported unit provides C2 for the MACP, but the NCOIC continues to communicate and report MA
issues to the TMAO. The MACP will follow additional reporting requirements IAW the supported unit SOP.
9-83. The MACP NCOIC is responsible for initiating MACP priorities of work that specifically include
establishing and maintaining site security. The increased presence of embedded media within combat
formations requires that MA leaders strictly control access to the processing area. The MA leadership has an
inherent responsibility to safeguard information related to fatalities and protect death information from
unauthorized media reporting.
United States Army Mortuary Affairs 
03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
9-19
9-84. Refer media questions about DOD S&R efforts or any fatality to the CCMD public affairs office. All
Service component news releases and samples of media coverage are copied to the CCMD public affairs
office.
SITE SELECTION AND ESTABLISHMENT 
9-85. Site selection is dependent upon unit of attachment and their defensive structure. Generally, the MACP
will be located in the BSA and integrated into the overall defense plan. The MACP should be located in an
area that allows for restricted access and viewing of the operation. A MACP operates out of a MIRCS for
mobility, which should be placed IAW the MACP site selection considerations and criteria provided below.
SELECTION CONSIDERATIONS AND CRITERIA 
9-86. The MACP should be highly mobile and prepared for rapid-load operations while providing DS to
maneuver units. The following should be taken into consideration when determining the location of an
MACP:
⚫
Accessibility for combat units evacuating HR and marked clearly for easy recognition.
⚫
Ability to establish a screen area using natural screening or screening material.
⚫
Proximity to a main supply route to facilitate delivery and evacuation of HR.
⚫
Ability to build a road network on-site or to use an existing road network.
⚫
Ability to build a helipad on site or to use an existing helipad.
⚫
Proximity to engineer support for construction and maintenance of a road network, interment site,
and helipad.
⚫
Proximity to a landing strip or airport.
⚫
Proximity to life support, human resource personnel services, and MTF, but out of sight from the
patient decontamination site or CCP.
⚫
Proximity to tactical communications support.
⚫
Access to mobile refrigeration containers (overflow).
PRIORITIES OF WORK 
9-87. The NCOIC implements the priorities of work:
⚫
Tie-in with adjacent unit.
⚫
Establish site security.
⚫
Establish communication.
⚫
Coordinate life, administrative, personnel, and medical support.
⚫
Establish habitual transportation link.
⚫
Establish or create signs to identify the MA facility.
⚫
Coordinate engineer support to prepare road network and other mission requirements.

Prepare refrigeration (overflow).
⚫
Construct munitions holding area per guidance from EOD personnel.
⚫
Shield the MA facility from public view by using a latrine screen, overhead camouflage screening
materials, or fence with canvas attached for privacy.
⚫
Prepare to receive HR, and notify the supported unit and higher HQ that the MACP is ready to
receive HR.
9-88. The command responsible for the MACP or TMEP (sustainment brigade, BSB) duties include:
⚫
Command team, chaplain, and MA NCO monitors MA team for sustainment and readiness.
⚫
Provides PPE, MA supplies, ice (if available), bulk water and fuel for the MACP operations.
⚫
Maintains close liaison with MA team for MA facility maintenance, biohazard waste disposal, and
additional equipment and personnel requirements.
Chapter 9 
9-20
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
Note. The MACP and TMEP are not resourced with additional personnel or equipment to retrieve 
HR and PE from the unit, CCP, MTF, or another MACP. Evacuation of HR and PE is a logistics 
function. 
9-89. Roles and responsibilities for HR evacuation differ by organization:
⚫
Unit-level. The unit S&R team recovers the unit’s loss and—
▪
Transports the HR to the nearest MACP.
▪
Ensures all appropriate documentation accompanies HR to the MACP along with associated
PE, government ID, organizational clothing, individual equipment, and body armor to aid in
the tentative ID and determine the manner of death.
▪
Completes a DD Form 565 at the MACP.
⚫
Medical treatment facility. If the Service member dies at an MTF, the staff will—
▪
Coordinate for transporting the HR to the nearest MACP.
▪
Ensure appropriate documentation accompanies the HR to the MACP.
▪
Ensure all associated PE, government ID, and government equipment (helmet and body
armor) accompany the HR to MACP.
▪
Transport HR using a covered vehicle and resources that are not dedicated for air or ground
ambulance medical evacuation.
⚫
Commands responsible for MACP or TMEP support (for example, sustainment brigade, BSB).
The supporting unit provides a detail with personnel available to assist only with remains handling,
driving, and clean up. These personnel do not process the HR, PE, or any portions.
⚫
MA facility personnel coordinate with the command MA liaison officer or NCO for transportation
(ground or air):
▪
Follow all procedures in chapters 5 and 6 for processing at an MACP and TMEP.
▪
Prepare HR for transport in a transfer case from the MA activity (icing HR, complete case file
information, and account for PE and body armor for AFMES staff).
▪
Complete all transportation documentation, enter fatality information into MARTS for
evacuation with flight information from the MACP or TMEP to the CONUS port mortuary,
and transport in a covered vehicle from the MA facility to the USAF cargo special handling
area.
MORTUARY AFFAIRS COLLECTION POINT AND THEATER MORTUARY EVACUATION POINT
PROTOCOLS 
9-90. Army MA teams require observation of the following protocols:
⚫
Army MACPs operate 24 hours per day, seven days a week processing fatalities for evacuation.
⚫
Show dignity, reverence, and respect at all times in and around the vicinity of the MACP.
⚫
Strictly control access, permitting only personnel that conduct business with the MACP and TMEP
for privacy and respect to the deceased.
⚫
Prohibit photography of any kind in and around the MACP and TMEP, unless authorized by the
AFMES, a military criminal investigative organization, or federal investigative agency with
jurisdiction.
⚫
Establish a “No hat/No Salute” area within the vicinity of the MACP and TMEP.
⚫
Cover or shroud HR at all times when outside of refrigeration, especially when there is no
processing or awaiting evacuation.
⚫
Make every effort to assist those responsible for the PE inventory, SCMO duties, or personal
property turn-in to the MACP.
⚫
Do not permit reporters and media in and around the MACP and TMEP. Refer them to the public
affairs office.

03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
9-21
⚫
MA personnel will not recover fatalities from MTFs unless no other means are available and no
other HR are at the MACP.
⚫
All MA facilities require internet and communications to input HR data in MARTS, generate
reports for casualty liaison teams, and coordinate evacuation.
⚫
Use screening material to shield facility from public view to protect morale, prevent unnecessary
interruptions to HR processing, and show respect for the fallen.
THEATER MORTUARY EVACUATION POINT REQUIREMENTS 
9-91. The Army has the responsibility to establish and operate TMEPs when required.
9-92. The MA platoon operating the TMEP must comply with the GCC regulation for MA support and
established theater MA policies and procedures. The TMEP must complete any HR preparation for
evacuation not completed at an MACP. The TMEP must be able to process up to 250 HR per day and
requires—
⚫
One MA platoon (minimum) to operate and process HR and PE.
⚫
An additional workforce of personnel to augment the TMEP. Multi-Service MA personnel to assist
with any Service-specific concerns and to process any surge in remains and effects because of
backlog from large-scale combat operations.
⚫
A location in close proximity to the APOE.
⚫
A covered vehicle for transporting HR and PE to and from the flight line (preferably a commercial
refrigerated box truck). The TMEP is usually located in a secure area on, or near, an APOE with
additional storage space for transfer cases.
⚫

⚫
Administrative, uniform code of military justice, life support, medical (physical and behavioral
health), and external maintenance support for organic vehicles and refrigeration units.
SITE SELECTION AND ESTABLISHMENT 
9-93. Site selection is similar to the MACP except the TMEP will be located in the JSA and require
integration into the overall defense plan. A TMEP normally operates out of a fixed facility or large tents and
has at least four MIRCS and additional refrigeration storage containers. The TMEP should operate in an area
that allows for restricted access and limited viewing of the operation. The TMEP placement should follow
the site selection considerations and criteria provided in chapter 6.
THEATER MORTUARY EVACUATION POINT ACTIONS 
9-94. The following actions must take place at the TMEP:
⚫
Log in HR using DD Form 1077.
⚫
Provide quality control actions, complete case files, coordinate fatality documentation and
evacuation, and enter data into MARTS prior to evacuation.
⚫
Receive all HR and accompanying PE destined for the CONUS port mortuary from MACPs.

temperature gage on the MA evacuation ice work sheet.
⚫
Transport the HR to the APOE (flight line) for evacuation to the CONUS port of entry mortuary.
Note. All deaths from an operational theater are AFMES cases. Medical verification of the death 
will be annotated as “Pending Armed Forces Medical Examiner Determination” on DD Form 
2064. The final death certificate will be prepared by the AFMES. 
MORTUARY AFFAIRS IN LARGE-SCALE COMBAT OPERATIONS 
9-95. As operations intensify, MA assets will disperse throughout the OE. During large-scale combat
operations, MA operations will require additional personnel and equipment resources for planning estimates.
To facilitate fatality processing, the Army MA collection teams will be processing fatalities 24 hours a day
and must conduct MACP operations with at least two MA teams (12 personnel) at an MACP. See figure 9-7
for placement of MA assets in the JOA. See FM 1-02.2 for more information on military symbols.
Note 1. All deaths from an operational theater are AFMES cases unless AFMES specifically 
declines jurisdiction when they accept competent local medical authority’s cause and manner of 
death. For these AFMES cases, a copy of the medical verification of the death or theater death 
certificate will be annotated as, Pending Final AFMES Determination. Forward the death 
certificate with the remains and upload the document into MARTS. For these AFMES cases, 
AFMES will complete the final death certificate. The original unaltered death certificate will be 
sealed in an envelope, the envelope marked with original death certificate and forwarded with 
remains. The original death certificate, without the AFMES annotation, will not be uploaded to 
MARTS. 
Note 2. On AFMES declined cases, the death certificate from theater may become the final death 
certificate. Ensure the U.S. Embassy has been notified of the death and has determined if a 
Consular Report of Death of a U.S. Citizen Abroad is required. Frequently, this report is required 
by surviving next-of-kin to accomplish official death reporting to local, state, and federal US 
Agencies and insurance companies when foreign death certificates are not accepted or recognized. 
PLANNING 
9-96. During large-scale combat operations, the tactical commands that will simplify MA operations is the
ESC and DSB. The ESC provides a forward presence of the TSC within an AOR. This logistics command
supplements some TSC functions during high volume theater operations. The tactical commands that will
simplify MA operations is the Army DSB.

⚫
The ESC oversees tactical execution of sustainment operations, adjusting operations plans within
an AOR, and provides mortuary affairs DS to a division.
⚫
The DSB conducts tactical execution of logistics, delivering support to the supported elements,
and provides mortuary affairs DS to a brigade support battalion (BSB)
9-97. The MA teams may not be able to use the MIRCS effectively due to huge surge in HR processing or
evacuation. Therefore, upon entering the TPFDD to request for forces, another consideration is to request
additional MA common equipment and interchange with larger refrigeration or storage containers. The peer
adversary along with the high volume/demand to process will challenge the MACP. The capacity the MA
collection team has to process large numbers beyond the normal with minimal resources and lack of
preservation techniques is challenging. For more information on MACP operations, see chapter 5 in this
publication.
9-98. Commanders, SPO, and unit logistics officers determine which supplies are needed and how often to
supply MA equipment repair, retrograde, reconstitution, and replacement of multi-Service MA personnel.
CBRN and explosive incidents require unique supplies that must be incorporated into the replenishments
cycle. Individual personal protective equipment (IPE), personal protective equipment (PPE), medical CBRN
countermeasures, and disease prevention materials such as insect repellent must be incorporated into the
replenishments cycle. MA support elements within the ASCC provide support to echelons above brigade and
division units. BCTs require multiple sustainment missions executed forward of the brigade support area
(BSA) by maintaining replenishment and evacuation of remains and associated PE with forward support
battalions and forward support companies.

shore, a Marine Corps Personnel Retrieval and Processing company is postured to support a Marine 
expeditionary brigade with up to 12 MACPs and S&R capability in the JOA. 
SEARCH AND RECOVERY 
9-100. The S&R operations in a large-scale combat operations environment will not have the flexibility to
have time as a resource. The evacuation of the living and wounded will have the highest priority; however,
the methods for accelerated processing for immediate evacuation will rely heavily on available transport,
temporary storage awaiting transportation, and ability to preserve HR and tentative ID media for the AFMES
positive ID. The senior commander will maximize the use of 92M personnel by designating S&R teams using
available Army 92M MA personnel to lead S&R teams embedded with unit-level non-MA personnel in the
mass fatality AO. The JMAO and TMAO will provide S&R CCP locations for the commanders on the ground
to recover their personnel. A MIRCS may deploy to support recovery operations if conditions warrant. For
example, if there are a total number of fatalities that require multiple airlifts and/or ground evacuations, with
limited available assets or if recovery operations are expected to last multiple days before evacuation is
possible.
FORWARD MORTUARY AFFAIRS COLLECTION POINT OPERATIONS 
9-101.  When MACPs are forward in DS to a combat maneuver element, they should be highly mobile and
located in the forward logistics support area with the combat maneuver element. The MACP refrigeration
section of the MIRCS does not have up-armored protection surrounding the MIRCS, so traveling behind the
maneuver element is a tactical challenge for the load handling system as the prime mover. Main challenges
for MACP teams will be to be able to sustain more than 20 HR per day and continue that rate to collect and
evacuate HR as quickly as possible. The mission is to get HR evacuated to the aerial and seaport of
embarkation so United States Transportation Command can identify the mode of transport required in order
to evacuate HR back to the CONUS port mortuary.
GENERAL SUPPORT MORTUARY AFFAIRS COLLECTION POINTS 
9-102. When providing GS to a given area or major command, MACPs are generally more stationary in
their operation and are located at large logistics bases. GS MACPs are task-organized with increased
receiving, processing, refrigeration, and evacuation capacities, like a main MACP. They are more fixed in
nature and maintain the modular capability to deploy forward with the logistics base or the major command.
The GS MACPs also provide backup theater level support for other Services. (For more information on MA
in large-scale combat operations, see chapter 3 in this publication.)
TEMPORARY INTERMENT OPERATIONS 
9-103.  Planning for any type of interment operations will require authorization from the GCC who is the
only authority in the theater when evacuation is not possible, when all options have been exhausted, and as
the last resort. Planners must advise commanders on identifying the trigger that will result in requesting
authorization during large-scale combat operations. Temporary interment will be executed under the auspices
of the JMAO at the GCC and the TMAO for accomplishing this table of organization and equipment MA
unit mission. Responsibilities for executing this mission are within the scope of the MA unit and require
significant assistance from engineers for the planning, execution, and excavation required to perform these
temporary interment tasks.
EVACUATION OPERATIONS 
9-104. When coordinating air evacuation, the TMAO personnel will coordinate with the military airlift
terminal to determine 463L pallet space availability for transfer cases based on the aircraft that is ready for
transportation of HR. Normally, four flag-draped transfer cases with fatalities fit on a 463L pallet (no
stacking). During large-scale combat operations mass fatality evacuation, to maximize space availability, 12
transfer cases will be loaded on a 463L pallet (no flags draped on them except after arrival to the port
mortuary). Cargo special handling will dedicate pallets with transfer cases to hold 5 pallets per C-130 aircraft,

9-25
18 pallets per C-17, and 36 pallets per C-5 aircraft. Before offloading, MA personnel will ensure that each 
transfer case is draped with a U.S. flag. 
DEFENSIVE TASKS 
9-105. Defensive tasks are not a passive activity nor are they stationary units awaiting an attack. Defensive
operations use mobile and static elements. Operationally, the defense is used to buy time, economize forces,
and develop conditions favorable for resuming offensive tasks. The commanders will position sustainment
MA assets to best support the forces.
9-106. Sustainment MA planners must have full understanding of the operations and the commander’s
intent. Specifically, planners must be prepared to resume any offensive tasks projected to follow the defense.
The plan must take into account both the enemy’s most probable course of action and the most dangerous
courses of action. These two courses of action will have direct impact on the placement of MA assets in the
AO and will determine current and projected locations of the MACPs and if needed, a MACRMS.
9-107. MA planners must strive to support the defense in depth. Because of the fixed nature of MA assets
and evacuation routes, they are more vulnerable to enemy action. MA planners must identify both primary
and secondary line of communications for evacuating the HR of friendly, enemy, and local nationals. Due to
the unique nature of defensive operations, MA units will handle fewer friendly HR but most likely larger
numbers of enemy and local nationals. Planners must be aware of policies and procedures established for the
prompt, dignified return of these HR to local government officials, Red Cross, Red Crescent, or family
members. Coordinate with the JMAO/TMAO for clarification on these policies.
9-108. All individual units must identify an MA evacuation plan, including reconnaissance assets located
away from the defensive lines. Additionally, units must develop contingency plans and alternate evacuation
routes for HR if their supporting MACP is lost to enemy activity. As with all operations, refrigeration assets
are used for HR storage while awaiting transportation; however, large-scale combat operations may not
permit the use of refrigeration units or standard MACP processing due to a large volume of fatalities being
recovered and brought to the MACPs. The HR received are processed and evacuated as soon as transportation
has arrived. MA units must arrange to evacuate HR to the nearest MA facility (TMEP) or the most expedient
transportation available to the rear as quickly as possible, see FM 3-90-1 for more information.
OFFENSIVE TASKS 
9-109. Offensive tasks are characterized by speed, precision, mobility, and high intensity. These operations
generally seek to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative to defeat the enemy decisively. Army forces attack
simultaneously throughout the AO to throw enemies off balance, overwhelm their capabilities, disrupt their
defenses, and ensure their defeat or destruction. Often during offensive tasks, planning is conducted in a time-
constrained environment where the focus is to quickly develop a flexible, tactically sound, and fully
integrated and synchronized plan.
9-110. Fatality rates of friendly forces tend to be higher during offensive tasks generally coupled with fast-
paced forward movement of troops and material. With these characteristics in mind, planners allocating
adequate MA resources is essential in large-scale combat operations. Plans should be flexible enough to allow
for units to adapt to the rapidly changing situation. In addition to operational flexibility, MA plans must
provide mobility and options to the GCC. The MA planner must ensure the commander is not limited to one
course of action because of mismanagement or inadequate MA planning.
9-111. Planners must consider a fatality increase as well as more frequent moving of the logistics bases
associated with offensive tasks. During these tasks, ground communications are frequently congested with
forward movement of troops and material. During large-scale combat operations, the battlefield
communications may begin to lengthen between the rapidly moving force and the support areas from which
MA personnel operate. These factors place greater importance on MA planners coordinating evacuation of
HR that must go to the rear using the most expedient logistical means possible.
9-112. MA planners must strongly emphasize the evacuation of HR using any assets available (ground and
air backhaul). Evacuating HR is always a national priority. However, the instability and congestion of ground
Chapter 9 
9-26
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
communications places greater emphasis on air evacuation during offensive operations. Once evacuation 
assets have arrived, processing of HR is complete then refrigeration assets are used as a storage area. 
STABILITY TASKS 
9-113. Stability tasks are often conducted in noncontiguous AOs, are often time/manpower intensive; they
are inherently complex and place great demands on small units. The MA planner must take into account the
noncontiguous OE. MA assets must be placed into positions that best support the commander’s intent and
increase the effectiveness of the overall mission. Sustainment and MA in stability operations often involve
supporting U.S. and MNF in a wide range of missions.
9-114. These missions range from long-term logistics-focused operations in humanitarian and civic
assistance to major short-notice peace enforcement missions. Tailoring MA assets and resources to the
specific requirements of the stability mission is sustainment operations contribution to supporting victory.
(See ADP 3-07 for more information on stability operations.)
9-115. Often MA assets operate far from their traditional line of communications. The MA units must be
tailored to the actual mission and may be deployed by nontraditional methods. For example, an MACP
positioned on an APOE in a small-scale stability operation may serve as a TMEP if fatality estimates are less
than 20 per day. In this situation, the MA planner must ensure evacuation assets leaving the APOE are capable
of reaching a port of entry mortuary.
9-116. Stability tasks often result in frequent and direct contact with the locals. Planners must define the
process of returning civilian fatalities to the local government, Red Cross, Red Crescent, or family members.
This includes not only local nationals, but those of any additional subcontractors brought to support the AO.
Due to the increased contact with the locals, MA personnel may be required to operate local contract
equipment and facilities. Integrating this equipment to existing MA theater assets or establishing separate
MA facilities are some of the challenges faced with local sourcing of MA assets.
9-117. As offensive and defensive tasks may be necessary to defeat enemies that oppose a stability
operation, MA plans must remain flexible at all times and should plan for handling HR of joint and MNF
coalition Soldiers, civilians, and contractors in the AO. The desired end-state of stability tasks requires a
long-term commitment. Due to the distinctive MA mission, a long-term plan must include a rotation schedule
of personnel that must include an adequate battle handover for the incoming unit and decompression time for
the returning personnel. See figure 9-8 for information on large-scale combat operations tasks in relation to
operations to consolidate gains.

Chapter 10 
United States Marine Corps Mortuary Affairs 
Expedient and respectful repatriation of deceased personnel to the person authorized 
to direct disposition of human remains is the top priority of the mortuary affairs 
program. The Marine Corps’ primary means of executing mortuary affairs operations 
and integrating with the joint logistics enterprise during protracted operations is the 
PRP company. All small-unit leaders and commanders bear some responsibility for 
fatality management and augmenting mortuary affairs services. The process begins at 
the point a Service member dies. Formal chains of evacuation and accountability begin 
at the small-unit level by establishing seven-person search and recovery teams and 
following reporting procedures. These search and recovery teams properly recover and 
evacuate HR with care, dignity, and respect to the nearest mortuary affairs collection 
point. 
MORTUARY AFFAIRS 
10-1. The Marine Corps MA program closely aligns with the roles, responsibilities, and contingency support
provided by the Army MA program. The PRP company and Marine Corps MA planners follow the planning
and training requirements set forth in chapter nine of this publication.
10-2. Service MA capability resides within the two PRP companies in the Marine Corps RC. They provide
MA services for Fleet Marine Forces in support of combat or contingency operations, and expedite recovery,
processing, and evacuation of HR to designated facilities. PRP companies will task-organize to form scalable
units as required, capable of deploying in support of maneuver units (see table 10-1 on page 10-3). The PRP
company can—
⚫
Conduct MACP operations.
⚫
Conduct mass fatality operations.
⚫
Conduct fatality management operations.
⚫
Provide temporary theater-level MA support.
⚫
Provide MA support to disaster relief operations.
⚫
Conduct interment and disinterment operations.
⚫
Conduct search and recovery operations (limited capacity).
⚫
Provide MA support teams for unit planning and recovery training. (See chapters 4 and 5 in this
publication).
FORMAL TRAINING 
10-3. Assigned PRP personnel attend the formal U.S. Army MA Specialist Course located at Fort Lee,
Virginia.
⚫
Enlisted personnel attend a four-week MA Specialist Course (USMC MOS 0471, PRP Specialist).
⚫
Officers attend a two-week MAO course to obtain the additional MOS of 0407.
⚫
Active-duty Marine staff NCOs (E6-E9) and officers are authorized to attend the two-week MAO
course with a colonel (O6) approval letter. Officers who attend the two-week MAO course obtain
the additional MOS of 0407. The MAO course is beneficial for MA planners who may serve as
MA advisors or planners for deployed Marine forces. MAO-trained personnel are key enablers to
set up MA operations for an austere theater prior to the establishment of the PRP.

10-4. Marine Corps MA planners are embedded in all elements of the MAGTF (commonly resident within
logistics staff sections) as advisors to commanders in leveraging MA capabilities across the conflict
continuum.
10-5. MA during expeditionary advanced basing operations and distributed maritime operations planning
considerations include—
⚫
MAGTF planners will experience reduced MA capabilities during expeditionary advanced basing
operations and require owning units to manage HR until evacuation from the area of operations
can be coordinated.
⚫
Due to the nature of expeditionary advanced basing operations, units will have limited access to
both air and sea connectors. This will require immediate access to refrigerated storage, ice, or the
owning unit to request authorization for temporary interment through their chain of command.
⚫
Only the GCC can authorize temporary interment of HR.
⚫
Commanders should be prepared to conduct HR recovery during amphibious operations (ship to
shore).

COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITIES 
10-12. Commanders are ultimately responsible for fatality management and the recovery of HR from their
units. They must be prepared to recover HR in CONUS and OCONUS, before and after MA missions are
established. The scope of responsibilities includes, but is not limited to—
⚫
Initiate immediate S&R operations for deceased Service members, or as soon as conditions permit.
⚫
Provide for the recovery, tentative identification, storage, and evacuation of deceased U.S. military
personnel, designated civilians, and allied and enemy dead (as authorized) within geographical
AORs.
⚫
Prepare to receive and incorporate MA capabilities. Attach teams as available to subordinate
commands for life support and administrative control based on the tactical situation.
⚫
Prepare and operate MACPs for all Services within the command's AO once PRP personnel arrive.
⚫
Provide appropriate personal protective equipment for MA missions, teams, and augmentees.
⚫
Establish a temporary TMEP near an airstrip, landing zone or seaport to evacuate an anticipated
number of HR prior to arrival of MA personnel.
⚫
Negotiate with HN authorities for necessary land, excavation capability, cold storage facilities,
ice-making capability, sanitation, and general labor to assist in opening and operating collection
points, temporary TMEPs, or temporary interment sites.
⚫
Evacuate PE (normally done by losing unit) through supply channels. PE on remains will be
evacuated with the HR to the TMEP, unless the PRP MA platoon is operating as an interim TMEP.
In that case, the HR and associated PE will be evacuated to the CONUS port mortuary. (See
chapter 7 for more information on PE.)
⚫
Ensure the unit has received the appropriate level of training and has a fundamental understanding
of remains recovery operations. At a minimum, a unit recovery team should consist of seven
Marines with an NCO assigned as team leader. The team must clearly understand the unique
requirements and demands of their mission. Ensure all body armor is returned with the human
remains as this will be returned to the AFMES for forensic analysis. All appointed recovery team
personnel must receive high-risk occupation immunizations and be issued PPE for recovering HR.
(See chapter 4 for PPE requirements and unit recovery team responsibilities.)
⚫
Conduct recovery team training annually. The unit may solicit a PRP MA support team to conduct
annual training and provide an assessment of unit readiness.
⚫
Determine if a contaminated site is safe enough for a recovery team in appropriate CBRN
protective equipment to recover HR. However, the Marine Corps does not possess the capability
to process contaminated HR.
PERSONAL EFFECTS 
10-13. PE are any effects located on the HR that will stay on the remains throughout the MA process. The
body armor (vest, helmet) will stay on the remains and be returned to the AFMES for analysis. PE located
within a personal living or workspace will be handled according to MCO 4400.201-V-13.
Note. The Army is no longer the executive agent of the DOD mortuary affairs program; however, 
the Army is the DOD executive agent for the Chemical and Biological Defense Program pursuant 
to Title 50, USC, sections 1522 and 1523. This governs research, analyzes, and develops MA 
products and guidelines pertaining to effective management of biological, chemical, and 
radiological contaminated HR in accordance with DODD 5160.05E. 
PERSONNEL PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL AUGMENTATION 
10-14. The PRP company generally does not require augmentees. However, during significant incidents or
sustained operations, the PRP company will provide a program of instruction and evaluations to designated
personnel to train and equip them for MA responsibilities. The PRP company may also require augmentation
of support personnel. Their duties may include, but are not limited to:

DIGNITY AND RESPECT FOR DECEASED PERSONNEL 
10-15. In combat, PRP company personnel will typically not be the first to see or handle HR. All units
should have personnel aware of basic recovery, records, PE, storage, and handling of HR to ensure deceased
Service members are treated with due dignity. The appropriate, dignified, and respectful handling of HR is
critical to maintaining morale within the unit and joint force and maintaining trust and confidence of the
American public.

United States Navy Mortuary Affairs 
MA, in any theater of operations, focuses on the expeditious search for, recovery, and 
movement of deceased personnel. The Department of the Navy Mortuary Affairs 
Program works for the return, care, and disposition of recovered deceased naval (Navy 
and Marine Corps) personnel and other eligible persons. 
MORTUARY AFFAIRS RESPONSIBILITIES 
11-1. Unit commanding officers are responsible for the operational and administrative reporting of deaths in
their unit and following theater policy. Commanding officers must balance the duty to repatriate deceased
personnel with maintaining combat effectiveness and efficiency IAW theater guidance. Afloat unit
commanding officer responsibilities include S&R and tentative ID of HR. They are also responsible for
disposition of PE to the JPED, and evacuation of HR to the closest MACP or MA facility at the discretion of
the commanding officer, or as operations dictate. Commanding officers are not required to provide a
uniformed escort with HR.
11-2. Upon arrival at the port mortuary, AFMES forensic specialists conduct a post-mortem examination
and scientific ID of remains. Navy Personnel Command and Commander, Navy Installations Command are
both responsible for notification of next of kin, transportation and escort of HR once released by the AFMES,
as well as funeral and honors support.
AFLOAT UNIT MISSION 
11-3. The afloat unit mission is to execute S&R efforts and coordinate movement of HR as operations allow:
⚫
HR should be processed, stored (see paragraph 11-14), and evacuated as operations dictate.
⚫
Navy units will always follow Navy administrative protocols for administration and notification
tasks.
⚫
The afloat commanding officer will coordinate the transfer of the HR through established logistics
hubs.
⚫
Additionally, the PE of the deceased shall be collected, inventoried, safeguarded, and shipped
IAW NAVSUP P-485 VOL 1, Part D, section 1310.
Note. In the event afloat units are unable to properly transfer or store HR IAW 
NAVMEDCOMINST 5360.1 due to operational requirements, Navy units shall conduct a combat 
burial at sea IAW procedures established by the GCC or the afloat commanding officer. 
ASHORE UNIT MISSION 
11-4. Shore-based units will rely heavily upon multi-Service support to handle MA tasks immediately. For
naval personnel embedded with other Services, processing, storage, and transfer of HR will generally follow
lead-Service protocols for MA IAW DODD 1300.22. Navy units will follow Navy administrative protocols
for administration and notification tasks.
Note. Navy units embedded with joint commands will follow lead Service MA protocols.

necessity, the Navy could allocate 40% of the current staffing to equipped field mortuaries, if available.
11-9. When deaths occur aboard ship, the Navy will—
⚫
Store HR in a refrigerated container.
⚫
Evacuate HR to the nearest port or facility, then to the port mortuary.
⚫
As a last resort, perform a burial at sea following the established protocol.
BURIAL AT SEA 
11-10. The Department of the Navy has long recognized the sea as a fit and final resting place for personnel
who perish at sea. However, burial at sea will only be utilized in exigent circumstances as established by
cognizant operational authority. Burial or committal at sea is permissible only when refrigerated storage
facilities cannot be made available aboard ship and transfer to shore cannot be accomplished within a
reasonable time or is operationally inadvisable:
Note. Safety considerations due to operational activity or CBRN contamination may hinder the 
execution of the following steps. Commanding officers should attempt to obtain as much evidence 
and documentation as possible, without endangering the crew. 
⚫
Prior to committal, the ship’s commanding officer ensures the identity of the HR. When feasible,
the commanding officer should—
▪
Contact the AFMES for guidance on obtaining ID media and biological samples prior to
committal.
▪
Examine ID tags and then securely place them on the HR.
▪
Remove PE from the HR and examine them for ID value.
▪
Establish an ID case file, which consists of a statement of recognition from two individuals
and a certificate of death signed by a medical officer.
▪
Take fingerprints, dental x-rays, and a blood or tissue sample (for DNA), if assets are
available, and place into the ID case file.

11-3
▪
Include any onboard medical and/or dental records in the ID case file.
⚫
The ship’s commanding officer appoints an officer to be in charge of the committal. An embarked
chaplain and the RST/RMT will work with the OIC to ensure a dignified and appropriate
committal is carried out. The OIC is responsible for—
▪
Accurately recording all facts, including the exact latitude and longitude of the committal, in
the ship’s log.
▪
Ensuring due respect and honors to the deceased are rendered.
▪
Preparing the deceased for committal by covering or shrouding with an appropriate cloth or
suitable material.
▪
Making sure the HR is weighted to ensure rapid submersion.
⚫
For the HR of U.S. military personnel—
▪
Drape the HR with the U.S. flag.
▪
Conduct religious services, if a chaplain is not present, the commanding officer or an officer
designated by him/her, conduct committal services.
▪
Conduct military honors as authorized according to applicable regulations.
Note. The flag is used to drape the HR prior to interment; it is not interred with the HR, nor is it 
committed to the sea. If the HR identity is unknown, no U.S or other national flag shall drape the 
body. The HR may be committed to the sea with the words appropriate for the individual being 
committed. 
⚫
The OIC is responsible for—
▪
Ensuring that all PE belonging to the deceased are gathered, inventoried, packaged, sealed,
and safeguarded until proper disposition is arranged.
▪
Shipping PE to either the PE depot, TMEP, or if the PE have been properly screened, directly
to the person eligible to receive effects IAW USN regulations. (Depending on the MA
program and support structure that is in place).
▪
Sending the ID case file and a report containing the facts of the committal, including the
distribution list of the PE and the fleet commanding officer, to the JMAO and the Navy
Casualty Office upon committal at sea.
MISSION ESSENTIAL TASKS OVERVIEW 
11-11. Mission essential tasks include reporting, S&R, processing, identification, evacuation of HR, other
afloat storage, and PE.
REPORTING 
11-12. Report fatalities to leadership IAW theater guidance:
⚫

civil authorities located in the area of the fatalities, as necessary under local S&R procedures.
⚫
Cooperate to the fullest extent possible in providing information and assistance in the S&R efforts
to the GCC, JMAO, any other unified commands, fleet, and others in the conduct of the
commanding officer’s recovery operation.
PROCESSING HUMAN REMAINS 
11-14. For processing HR—
⚫
Place decedent in the HRP; include all clothing, PPE, and PE on them at the time of their death.
⚫
Refrigerate and take every precaution to ensure the HR does not freeze. Maintain the prescribed
temperature range of 34 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
⚫
Monitor the temperature frequently to prevent degradation of the HR, which could affect the
medical examiner’s ability to determine cause of death.
⚫
Prohibit photography of HR unless directed by the AFMES, military law enforcement, or another
authorized investigative body.
⚫
Remove PE if needed to aid in believed to be ID, and place back with HR once completed for
transportation. Evacuation of HR should occur as soon as possible to facilitate medicolegal
examination by the AFMES.
HUMAN REMAINS IDENTIFICATION 
11-15. Units will make every effort to assist identifying the HR and document the ID. Two protected signed
copies of DD Form 565 will accompany the HR. The AFMES will determine and document the positive ID.
EVACUATION OF HUMAN REMAINS 
11-16. Navy afloat units, to include hospital ships, are not configured to support multiple HR storage and
transportation and carry a limited supply of HRPs. Larger afloat units have a limited refrigeration storage for
HR (for example, carrier vessel nuclear [2 to 4 HR] and landing helicopter dock [up to 12 HR]).
Note. In an emergency, at the discretion of the commanding officer, other afloat units may store 
one to two HR in food service refrigerators, though only after removing all food items stored in 
the refrigerator. Clean and disinfect the refrigerator prior to replacing food. 
11-17. Items will not be placed on top of HR at any time and should be placed on either side. Navy ashore
units with no evacuation capability will rely entirely on external support. Navy units are not authorized to
handle, store, or transport CBRN-contaminated HR.
OTHER AFLOAT STORAGE 
11-18. Other afloat storage and transport capabilities can be coordinated with Military Sealift Command
and United States Transportation Command.
PERSONAL EFFECTS 
11-19. The PE located on a decedent should be left in place and accompany the HR in transit. Any residual
PE should be inventoried and shipped IAW Department of the Navy Service regulations regarding PE,

Department of The United States Air Force Mortuary 
Affairs 
The purpose of the United States Air and Space Forces MA program during 
contingency operations is to ensure that human remains are evacuated to the port 
mortuary in the most expeditious way possible and to preserve the remains for 
identification and preservation of evidence of death. Air and Space Forces members 
support the mortuary affairs mission through either augmentation or operational 
control of MA collection point, TMEP, or aerial staging facility operations. If the return 
of HR in a timely manner is not possible, the Air and Space Forces leaders with MA 
responsibilities will secure temporary refrigerated storage or temporary interment in 
accordance with this publication. This chapter details the established Air and Space 
Forces guidelines required for Airmen and Guardians to successfully support MA 
operations. 
SECTION I – STRATEGIC CONTINGENCY REQUIREMENTS 
12-1. Air and Space Forces senior leaders, with direction from the CCMD and TMAO, must identify whether
MA operations will be established as an augmentation role or if they will have operational control of MA
operations at the contingency location. In instances where Air and Space Forces have operational control of
MA operations, senior leaders must ensure that MA teams are appropriately trained, manned, and equipped
to successfully fulfill mission requirements. Air and Space Forces members must be pre-identified and
receive initial MA operations and MARTS training from the Joint Mortuary Affairs Center (JMAC) prior to
supporting contingency operations.
12-2. Air expeditionary force agile combat support provides force capabilities that can rapidly respond by
creating, sustaining, and protecting all air power capabilities to accomplish mission objectives. Agile combat
support produces the combat support capabilities critical to decisive air power. By focusing on the
expeditionary capabilities of agile combat support, expeditionary combat support concepts assure air
expeditionary forces are supported and are able to operate with a support footprint and streamlined
infrastructure requirements.
12-3. AETF force modules are a method of packaging C2, operational mission, and expeditionary combat
support forces for presentation to a combatant commander through the Commander, Air and Space Forces.
These force modules provide a standardized template optimizing initial planning through rapid requirements
generation.
12-4. The AETF force modules consist of six scalable, modular elements: Open the Base, Command and
Control, Establish the Airbase, Generate the Mission, Operate the Airbase, and Robust the Airbase.
12-5. The Open the Base AETF force module contains the minimum essential combat support functions
necessary to seize and open an austere bed-down location. These forces will normally arrive first and assess
the base for establishment of minimum airfield operating parameters, C2, and supporting host-nation support
capabilities. The capabilities contained in this module fall under the following eight categories: assess the
base, establish minimum operating strip, protect the forces, initial C2 of forces, conduct airfield operations,
establish communications, handle cargo/passengers, receive/bed-down initial forces.
12-6. This congressionally mandated airspace control system mission requirement will be executed with the
lethality and capability required to support the joint warfighter. The basic expeditionary airfield resources
Chapter 12

03 August 2022 
base mortuary unit type code (UTC) XFWXN will be sourced to arrive during the Open the Base AETF force 
module. 
12-7. Forward operating location priorities in a contingency environment will adjust based on the mission,
situation, and flow of resources and manpower. The general objective is to protect United States interests at
home and abroad. Services Prime RIBS team members must be prepared to fulfill their mission requirements
across the full range of all military operations. The Air and Space Forces have multiple MA operating
locations with capabilities across the globe:
⚫
The Air Force has a regional mortuary located at Yokota Air Base, Japan for OCONUS current
death support, which includes limited logistical mortuary storage and regional distribution in
support of contingency operations.
⚫
Air Force MA Operating Location Europe in Ramstein Air Base, Germany, and Location Pacific
Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii support current death and concurrent return programs.
⚫
Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operations, Mortuary Affairs Division will prepare, casket, and ship
remains and PE per disposition instructions provided by the person authorized to direct
disposition, primary next of kin, or sponsor.
SECTION II – CONTINGENCY MORTUARY AFFAIRS PROCEDURES 
12-8. In a contingency environment, the roles and responsibilities for the USAF MA program and Prime
RIBS team members are to provide support throughout the theater during military operations, which
include—
⚫
Establishing, operating, and supporting MACPs, TMEPs, military mortuaries, and interment sites.
⚫
Processing information into MARTS for return of remains for onward movement.
⚫
Collecting, accounting, storing, and processing PE of deceased and missing U.S. and enemy
personnel IAW DODD 1300.22, DODI 1300.29, DAFI 34-160 (chapter 13), and this publication.
⚫
Ensuring preparation, coordination, and evacuation of HR for final disposition.
⚫
Responding to mass fatality incidents.
⚫
Training all management and lead UTC personnel on wartime and contingency S&R procedures.
⚫
Training S&R teams (minimum of 11 force support personnel) through home station and force
support contingency training. If operational constraints exist, the mortuary officer or designated
representative will request base augmentation. Augmentees will receive just in time training
conducted by the S&R team.
CONTINGENCY FLOW OF HUMAN REMAINS 
12-9. Subsequent paragraphs outline the flow of HR from the CCP to an OCONUS military mortuary or the
CONUS port mortuary. Re-Icing and quality assurance checks must be accomplished in the event the HR is
transported to an OCONUS aerial port.
12-10. Figure 12-1 shows the flow of HR in the TO. The figure depicts evacuation flow from the unit CCP,
through the TO, to the Dover Air Force Base Port Mortuary for final disposition.

Figure 12-1. Contingency flow of human remains 
12-11. Ideally, the CCP is located near a medical facility. The casualty collection point is a location that
may or may not be staffed, where casualties are assembled for evacuation to a medical treatment facility
(ATP 4-02.2). Medical personnel may or may not be available to staff these points, and combat lifesavers
and ambulatory casualties may be required to perform self-aid, buddy aid, or enhanced first aid. An Air and
Space Forces representative will coordinate with the CCP to begin actions to receive the deceased. CCP
personnel may request a competent medical authority or designated medical representative, which is required
to declare death and complete generation of the draft DD Form 2064 (the DD Form 2064 is a controlled form
that is maintained by the competent medical authority for issue only when requested). When CCPs are not
established, the MACP may take the role of receiving the deceased. CCP personnel may request that a
competent medical authority or designated medical representative to declare the death and present a DD Form
2064. Additionally, it is the responsibility of the decedent’s unit through the Buddy Care process to transport
remains to the MACP or CCP. Furthermore, DD Form 2064 is a controlled form that is maintained by the
competent medical authority for issue only when requested.
Note. The draft DD Form 2064 is not final and should not be used for any other purpose other than 
to transport from theater to the location AFMES directs for autopsy. The draft will be marked 
"Pending AFME Determination." When the AFMES declines jurisdiction, coordination must be 
made with medical authorities for a final death certificate. 
MORTUARY AFFAIRS COLLECTION POINT OPERATIONS 
12-12. The MACP mission is to prepare HR along with accompanying PE for transport to the TMEP or
port mortuary as quickly as possible. Air and Space Forces MACP operations can be established as a stand-
alone entity providing general support for joint operations or in operations led by the Air and Space Forces.
The Army, as the lead agent for MA, will provide pre-deployment MACP and MARTS training for Air and
Space Forces Prime RIBS team members. Air and Space Forces Prime RIBS team members must be pre-
identified. When requested by the TMAO, the Air and Space Forces can establish and conduct MACP
operations. For standard remains processing procedures, follow instructions provided in this publication.
When the JMAO and TMAO publish theater specific guidance, the published guidance takes precedence.
MACPs may receive HR from other sources (for example, buddy care, other units, and tactical assembly
area). In this case, a request for competent medical authority or designated medical representative support
for declaration of death is required.

12-13. Site selection is dependent upon the type of aircraft and flight line operational support for the transfer
of HR. If flight line operational support is available, the senior NCO or NCOIC will notify the expeditionary
mission support group, expeditionary civil engineer’s prime base engineer emergency force, and rapid
engineer deployable heavy operational repair squadron engineers to coordinate the MACP site selection near
the flight line.
12-14. The MACP site location should be coordinated with the expeditionary security forces squadron,
prime base engineer emergency force, and rapid engineer deployable heavy operational repair squadron
engineers personnel and added to the base defensive structure considerations for site planning. Planning
factors should include concertina wire, HESCO-MIL barriers, and concrete barriers for camouflage,
concealment, and deception measures. Camouflage, concealment, and deception measures is the use of
materials and techniques to hide, blend, disguise, decoy, or disrupt the appearance of military targets and/or
their backgrounds. Camouflage, concealment, and deception measures helps prevent an enemy from
detecting or identifying friendly warfighters, equipment, activities, or installation priority resources. Properly
designed camouflage, concealment, and deception techniques take advantage of the immediate environment,
shields surveillance, and enhances MACP safety and security operations.
12-15. The following illustration in figure 12-2 shows the general Air and Space Forces MACP layout.
Figure 12-2. Mortuary affairs collection point operational layout 
12-16. Designated mortuary UTCs will deploy with the initial basic expeditionary airfield resources war
reserve material MA kit (XFWXN, UTC title). The XFWXN UTC is equipped with initial MACP and S&R
equipment capabilities. At a minimum, the dimensions of the MACP will be 52 x 29.5 x 15 feet (1,534 square
feet). Members with lead responsibility over MACP operations will need to replenish disposable supplies
through local supply channels as soon as possible.
12-17. If the XFWXN UTC is utilized, MA teams must conduct a thorough inventory of all items prior to
set-up of MACP operations and provide a situational report to the Service component (for example, United

States Air Forces Central Command, the Combined Air Operations Center) through the combatant command 
(for example, United States Central Command). In a contingency environment where the Service component 
(Air Force) or air component (Air Force) is given the authority as the base operating support-integrator, the 
Air and Space Forces will assume MACP airspace control system requirements for each location. Table 12-

SUPPORT AGENCIES 
12-18. When Air and Space Forces personnel are the MA lead Service, planning and considerations must
be made when establishing MA operations using the UTC: XFWXN. The MACP personnel should utilize
equipment and supplies previously listed in Table 12-1. All MACP and MA leaders must also establish
communications with, and compete for support from, other Air and Space Forces agencies at deployed
locations for set-up and maintenance of their MACP operations. Required support and the corresponding Air
Force agencies that may assist with set-up and long-term support of MACP operations include—

The Air and Space Forces contract augmentation program is a force multiplier that augments civil
engineer and Service capabilities to support worldwide contingency planning and deployment
operations. However, the Air and Space Forces contract augmentation program will not be utilized
to augment MACP, S&R, or re-icing mission requirements. Based on unique training,
qualifications, and highly sensitive operational support, this is strictly a Prime RIBS team
requirement.
12-19. The Air and Space Forces role within TMEP operations is to assist or manage the evacuation of HR
along with accompanying PE to CONUS or OCONUS military mortuaries. Designated Air Force Services
Prime RIBS team members may be selected to augment TMEP operations. When tasked to support or manage
TMEP operations, Air and Space Forces members must be provided MA operations and MARTS training
from the JMAC prior to assignment to TMEP operations. For standard TMEP operations guidance, refer to
chapter 6 of this publication.
12-20. The responsibility of the aerial staging facility (ASF) is to conduct quality assurance checks, re-ice,
and process HR for transport (if practical) to CONUS or OCONUS military mortuaries. In the event HR must
be transported to an OCONUS MA ASF, re-icing and quality assurance checks will be accomplished IAW
the instructions outlined in this chapter.
12-21. The MA technician of the aerial port has the responsibility to conduct quality assurance checks, re-
ice, and process HR for transport if practical to CONUS or an OCONUS military mortuary.
12-22. The AFMES—
⚫
Exercises custody over HR received until released for disposition.
⚫
Makes positive scientific ID of HR through dental, fingerprint, or DNA analysis.
⚫
Determines the manner and cause of death.
⚫
Releases custody of the HR and PE to CONUS or OCONUS military mortuaries to prepare, casket,
and transport the HR and PE (per disposition instructions provided by the person authorized to
direct disposition of HR, primary next-of-kin, or person eligible to receive effects) pursuant to
Section 1471 of Title 10 USC.
SPECIAL RECOGNITION FOR HUMAN REMAINS 
12-23. Installation or unit members may desire to pay respects to a fallen comrade during departure to a
mortuary facility or place of rest. Leadership must ensure when a send-off occurs, it does not under any
circumstances impact the scheduled departure time.
12-24. A send-off is not a ceremony, but instead is a dignified carry whereby a small cadre of persons from
the member’s unit, and possibly select leaders from the installation, are present. Those in attendance form up
and salute when the carry team moves the deceased from the transport vehicle to the aircraft.
12-25. The number of persons from the unit and installation should be small; an exact number cannot be
specified. However, it should not create a burden on the local mortuary team or special handling team whose
purpose in this event is to ensure the on-time departure of the aircraft. No photography or video recording is
allowed by anyone participating or witnessing the send-off. No internal or external media is allowed.
Uniforms for those participating can be Airmen combat uniform, or flight suit, but not Service dress.
12-26. Base or local leadership will not comment upon nor eulogize the fallen member. Time-permitting,
it is permissible for a chaplain to pray over the deceased. It is not permitted to have the honor guard parade
the colors or to have a band present, which would be part of a ceremony and not a send-off.
SEARCH AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS 
12-27. Air and Space Forces base operating support responsibilities (for example, bed-down locations) will
be required to execute S&R operations in support of incidents on or near their installation for minor incidents
with two or fewer fatalities. Prior to conducting any S&R operations, the mortuary officer must contact the
air component HQ Air Force director of manpower, personnel, and services staff. This staff will coordinate
with the TMAO to determine who will conduct S&R. When Air and Space Forces personnel will conduct
the S&R, certain guidance applies:

12-8
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
⚫
If operational constraints exist, the mortuary officer or designated representative will request for
base augmentation through local leadership channels. Force support leaders will outfit the 11 core
3F-series UTC personnel with additional augmentation to ensure a minimum of 26 personnel,
depending on the severity of the incident scene. If additional manning is needed outside of the 26
S&R-trained personnel, force support leaders may request that additional forces receive just in
time training conducted by the S&R team leader or designated representative to ensure mission
success.
⚫
Conduct S&R only under conditions that do not endanger their members. Senior leadership will
make all attempts to conduct S&R operations during daylight hours. Under hostile conditions, the
installation or incident commander will determine when it is safe to begin S&R. Under non-hostile
conditions, EOD, CBRN (USAF emergency management), fire emergency services, and security
forces will determine if the area is safe to conduct S&R. For further information on S&R, see
chapter 4.
⚫
Establish leadership roles for the S&R team using 3F1X1 core personnel:
▪
A senior NCO or junior officer that has real world S&R experience or possesses strong verbal
and leadership skills should serve as the S&R team leader. MA leaders supporting S&R
operations will, at a minimum, complete force support combat training, MA training along
with mortuary training provided by JMAO or JMAC. Ideally, the S&R team lead will also be
affiliated with the local MA program.
▪
Assign an S&R team member as the grid plotter, which holds the responsibility of search site
photography. This member should be trained by civil engineering on the proper use of GPS,
union gridding system (explained in Chapter 4), and basic photography skills through the
local public affairs office.
▪
Ensure the S&R team flankers maintain line integrity and proper spacing throughout the
search. Flankers must also act as active search team members during the entire S&R mission.
▪
Pre-designate team member duties to document and safeguard PE. Immediately conduct IED
checks. Personnel must thoroughly check the entire HR for PE.
▪
The S&R team leader must establish HR bag and tag procedures. Bagging and tagging can
either be done independent of the standard line searchers or conducted by designated members
behind the S&R search line.
⚫
The Air and Space Forces do not have a MACRMS capability and rely on the GCC for proper
handling of contaminated HR through coordination with the joint staff logistics directorate,
JMAO, or TMAO.
⚫
For specific S&R procedures not mentioned in Chapter 4, refer to Air Force Handbook DAFH
34-102, located on the Air Force Mortuary Affairs Share Point (see website URL in the references)
or contact Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operations (AFMAO) for further guidance.
⚫
Transport HR and the PE on remains to the nearest MACP or TMEP as soon as possible for onward
movement to a CONUS or OCONUS military mortuary.
⚫
The S&R team leader will ensure that all requests for equipment and supplies needed for S&R
operations go through the MA office utilizing the list in Table 12-1 or XFWXN UTC.
SECTION III – MORTUARY OPERATIONS AT AERIAL STAGING FACILITIES 
12-28. This section introduces common processes and procedures when processing HR at an Air and Space
Forces-led MA ASF operation. When establishing MA operations at an ASF, Air and Space Forces senior
leaders within the force support community will request adequate manning and equipment to ensure that the
re-icing mission is prepared to support the flow of remains mission. It is also important that Air and Space
Forces senior leaders establish support agreements with local agencies to include special cargo handling,
logistics, and base operations to ensure effective support procedures are established for mission success. MA
activities at an ASF must request deviation from the below standard operating procedures through the TMAO,
in coordination with AFMAO.

12-30. The proper re-icing procedures for HR processing through ASF operations are explained in order of
completion in the following paragraphs.
TRAINING AND MANNING REQUIREMENTS 
12-31. Senior leadership with ASF responsibility will establish a fully trained HR handling team consisting
of one team lead and two additional members. Additional members may be required when there are two or
more HR in need of re-icing. When identifying teams, make sure the members are medically qualified to
conduct the re-icing mission. Prior to assignment, HR handling teams will train on proper techniques and
procedures when processing HR for transportation to the CONUS port mortuary.
RE-ICING MISSION PREPARATION 
12-32. The team lead will receive notification of HR inbound for re-icing and will gather as much
information as possible in preparation. Below are common questions to ask when gathering data:
⚫
When is the HR scheduled to arrive?
⚫
What is the aircraft layover time?
Chapter 12 
12-10
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
⚫
How many transfer cases with HR on board?
⚫
What is the cargo configuration, and are there passengers on board?
⚫
What is the aircraft parking location, and is there need for K-Loader?
⚫
Has MARTS access been requested and obtained by aerial port ASF mortuary personnel?
12-33. The team lead will notify team members, and relay mission information along with the start time for
re-icing. The team lead will call the ASF of embarkation one hour prior to confirm the flight arrival time and
will relay changes to team members. Upon aircraft arrival, the team lead will notify the special handling team
of HR team's arrival and start prepping for the initial re-icing process. The team will complete the following
measures:
⚫
Gather on-hand equipment and supplies in preparation for initial re-icing.
⚫
Fill six to nine double-bagged small plastic bags with ice that will hold 8-10lbs of ice per bag.
Remove trapped air and double or triple bag ice to prevent leaks and prevent condensation from
occurring.
⚫
Gather required PPE (surgical gloves, masks, face shields, and aprons).
⚫
Ensure a wet/dry shop vacuum marked with biohazard labeling is available.
⚫
Secure supplies (for example, 2-ply paper towels and biohazard bags).
⚫
Secure U.S. interment flags, dimensions 5’ X 9.5’ cotton.
⚫
Secure opaque elastic bands (flag holders).
⚫
Secure a clear rain guard cover (5mm clear vinyl), if available at the location.
⚫
Complete the MA Evacuation Ice Worksheet (see JMAC milSuite or AFMAO Share Point site
listed in the references section of this publication).
⚫
Print and ensure the events log is available to document important data.
Note. Refer to the equipment and supply listed in Table 12-2 on page 12-9. 
12-34. Special handling personnel will either move the transfer case to the re-icing preparation area, or will
escort the re-icing team to the aircraft for re-icing on the aircraft for short layovers. Once the transfer case is
safely moved to the re-icing preparation area, the quality assurance check will be conducted.
Note 1. No one other than the re-icing team is authorized to be in the room or hanger where re-
icing is being conducted. Commanders, escorts, losing unit, and special handling members are 
among those not authorized. 
Note 2. Pictures, videos, and media outlets are prohibited while conducting re-icing. 
QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECK PROCEDURES 
12-35. The team will do the following:
⚫
Don PPE prior to the start of re-icing procedures.
⚫
Annotate the date and time the team arrived to conduct the re-icing on an events log.
⚫
Walk around the transfer case; inspect the U.S. flag for any stains, tears, or anything out of the
ordinary.
⚫
Annotate the condition of the flag on the events log.
⚫
Prepare and place one U.S. flag on the transfer case if one is not already placed.
⚫
Ensure the latches on the transfer case are not broken, and free of major dents and rust that may
impair operational capability.
⚫
Check if there is a temperature gauge present; annotate the reading on the events log.
⚫
Check for damage to the transfer case. If there is damage, a replacement transfer case will be
required.

03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
12-11
⚫
Ensure the replacement transfer case is located near the re-icing, if required.
⚫
Ensure there is adequate manning when transferring HR to the replacement transfer case. This will
mitigate sagging and protect the HR from unnecessary harm.
⚫
Position the replacement transfer case next to the damaged one containing the HRP (ensuring the
lids are removed from both). Once ready, remove the HRP from the damaged transfer case and
place it into the replacement.
Note 1. Replace the transfer case if there are not at least three handles on each side, or if an original 
handle is missing. This applies to the older transfer case, which weighs 125lbs empty. 
Note 2. The new IHRTC is equipped with a temperature gauge, a file drawer to protect the MA 
evacuation and transportation documents, and weighs 160lbs empty. 
12-36. The re-icing team should—
⚫
Check the transfer case. It should arrive with numbered metal security seals. There are two seals,
located at the head and foot of the transfer case.
⚫
Log the correct security seal number for the head and the foot on the events log.
⚫
Use shears or cutting snips to remove both the head and foot security seals off the transfer case
latches. Place the seals in a small interlocking plastic bag.
⚫
Ensure the cut seals are secured and placed back inside of the transfer case once re-icing is
complete.
⚫
Unclasp all latches from transfer case. If the flag is in good condition, lift the lid not to damage
the flag. If the flag is not in good condition, remove it and replace it with a new one.
Note 1. Some transfer cases have labels to identify the head and foot. If the transfer case is not 
labeled, follow the direction of the U.S. flag to determine the head and foot locations. When 
looking from the field end (the foot), the union portion of the flag should be placed on the left side 
of the transfer case at the head. 
Note 2. Do not disturb the positioning of the flag. Place fingertips in the gap where the transfer 
case lid stops and the base of the transfer case begins. Remove the lid off the base of the transfer 
case and place the lid to the side. 
Note 3. Ensure proper lifting techniques are used (see appendix A). 
Note 4. Never place the lid of the transfer case on the floor if a flag is already on the case. 
Note 5. Members must document information into MARTS prior to release of HR to AFMAO for 
further movement. 
12-37. The team should conduct a proper inspection of the HRP:
⚫
Ensure the HRP has a numbered metal seal.
⚫
Inspect the HRP for any damages, tears, or defects:
▪
Annotate whether the HRP arrived with or without a seal on the events log.
▪
Note the seal number if present.
▪
Avoid cutting or removing the seal attached to the HRP.
▪
Check the HRP for rips, tears, or holes.
▪
Inspect the HRP for damage. If damaged, place the HRP inside an additional HRP and secure
it with a new seal.
▪
Annotate the condition of the HRP in the events log.

12-12
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
▪
If there is a tag on the HRP with the believed to be information on it, copy that information
onto the events log.
Note 1. The metal seal secures the HRP and deters tampering with the HR. 
Note 2. At no point should the HRP ever be opened and expose the HR. 
Note 3. If the transfer case has a green PE bag attached to the handles or exterior, remove the bag. 
Place it inside the storage drawer (if using the new IHRTC) or inside a plastic bag in the transfer 
case to protect it from water damage. Annotate the new placement on the events log. 
REMAINS RE-ICING PROCEDURES 
12-38. Count the number of ice bags and note their condition in the events log.
12-39. Interior transfer case maintenance tasks include—
⚫
Removing all bags of ice and water from the transfer case.
⚫
Removing excess water in the bottom of the transfer case using a wet/dry shop vacuum.
⚫
Drying off the top and bottom (underneath) of the HRP as well as the interior base of the transfer
case using cloths.
⚫
Disposing of all used material in a bioenvironmental approved dumpster.
⚫
Working with medical personnel to develop a plan for disposal of the waste.
⚫
Placing pre-bagged crushed wet ice around the outside of HRP. Typical placement of bags will
vary according to condition of the HR. At the ASF, place 60 to 90 lbs. of crushed wet ice, divided
into six to nine bags (8 to 10 lbs. each) in the following locations:
▪
Head: Two bags, one on each side of the head (do not place over face).
▪
Chest: Three bags, one on each side of the torso (oblique) and one over chest.
▪
Lower Extremities: Three bags, one on each side of lower extremities, one over the groin area.
▪
Feet: One bag under the feet.
12-40. Proper ice placement is depicted in figure 12-3.
12-41. Do not place ice directly against the skin (place on outside of HRP). Using dry ice for the
preservation of remains is prohibited.
Note. If a temperature gauge is not present on the transfer case (new IHRTC only) and the HRP 
feels warm or hot, increase the amount of ice placed on the HRP. 60 to 90lbs of ice should be 
sufficient to lower the temperature of the HR. The goal is to preserve the HR as much as possible. 
Ideal temperature should remain steady at 34 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If multiple re-icings are 
needed, reduce time increments between re-icings from 6 to 8 hour increments down to 4 to 6 hour 
increments until the temperature is at 34 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. 
12-42. Once re-icing is complete, place the lid back on the transfer case and lock down all of the latches.
Note 1. If only conducting re-icing for one HR, proceed to final re-icing below. If more re-icings 
are needed, skip the next two steps. 
Note 2. If re-icing disassociated or subsequent portions, use four to five bags of ice (depending on 
size of portions) and place the bags where the portions are located; however, avoid placing ice 
bags directly on top of the portions if possible.

⚫
Remove all trash (towels, paper, gloves, and masks) and discarding in approved bio-environmental
bag.
⚫
Provide a final inspection of the transfer case and flag to ensure they are set for departure. Check
that the seals are secured, and that the flag is properly affixed and secured with an opaque elastic
band.
⚫
Dispose of all melted ice IAW TG 195A.
⚫
Request the DD Form 1075 from the special handling team once final re-icing procedures have
been completed.
⚫
Pick up all used material and place in an approved bioenvironmental dumpster or turn over to
designated disposal area.
⚫
Email the aircraft manifest, DD Form 1075, and events log to the senior mortuary representative
on location for coordination.
⚫
Annotate in an email who participated in the re-icing along with the date and time it was
completed.
⚫
If multiple re-icings were performed, note the times of completion and any issues that arose during
the re-icing process (for example, missing seals, damaged transfer case or HRP). Members must
document information into MARTS prior to release of HR to AFMAO for further movement.
Note 1. Never transport biohazardous waste in a privately-owned vehicle. Only transport in 
government vehicles.

Note 2. For in-aircraft re-icing procedures, perform all the steps in accordance with the HR re-
icing procedures in previous paragraphs. Normal quick-turn missions are only on ground for 30 
to 45 minutes. 
REMAINS RE-ICING PROCEDURES (MULTIPLE REMAINS) 
12-44. The following procedures should be followed when re-icing multiple HR:
⚫
Inform the special handling team when initial re-icing is complete.
⚫
Ensure the special handling team holds the transfer case in a secure area that is under guard or
locked.
⚫
Notify the special handling team on the times the team will return. If the mission is to depart earlier
than expected, the special handling team will inform the team lead if final re-icing is needed
sooner.
⚫
Complete the additional quality assurance checks.
⚫
Ensure the re-icing occurs every 6 to 8 hours.
⚫
Conduct the final re-icing, no less than one and a half to two hours prior to departure of the aircraft.
⚫
Annotate the date and time re-icing occurred on the MA Evacuation Ice Worksheet.
⚫
Annotate the re-icings times in the events log, when complete.
⚫
Finish the re-icing by completing additional quality assurance checks, ensuring re-icing occurs
every 6 to 8 hours, and conducting final re-icing.
SECTION IV – FATALITY SEARCH AND RECOVERY TEAM CAPABILITIES 
12-45. The mission of the Air National Guard (Title 32) fatality search and recovery team is to locate and
recover remains of victims killed in hostile actions or natural disasters that may have hazardous conditions
and contamination. Some key attributes of this Air National Guard team are—
⚫
Specialized training for a weapons of mass destruction environment. Equipment meets National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health /Occupational Safety and Health Administration
standards.
⚫
Does not perform mitigation of hazard on the HR or collection point tasks.
⚫
Can be utilized in State Active Duty, Title 32, or Title 10 status.
⚫
There are 27 fatality search and recovery teams, aligned with the 10 FEMA regions:
▪
27 Fatality Search and Recovery Teams—17 FEMA/10 Homeland Response Force.
▪
Stand-alone or as part of the CBRN enhanced response force package.
▪
Under state control (Title 32)—may act as initial response.
▪
Traditional Guardsmen—not full-time.
▪
The figure 12-4 depicts the 10 FEMA Regions in CONUS.
12-46. FEMA is organized into ten regions. Each region serves as the focal point for organizing and
coordinating state and federal emergency management for incidents within the respective region.

Chapter 13 
Mortuary Affairs Support in the United States 
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 enhances the ability of the United States 
to manage domestic incidents by establishing a single, comprehensive National 
Incident Management System that is to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover 
from terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. 
OVERVIEW 
13-1. DOD primarily organizes, trains, and equips forces to conduct combat operations. It also has the
capability to respond to domestic emergencies, disasters, and provide a response capability known as Defense
Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). DODD 3025.18 refers to DOD support provided as directed by the
Secretary of Defense as provided in JP 3-28.
13-2. The NRF identifies the lead federal agency providing the core response. The lead federal agency
emergency response will entail a highly coordinated, multiagency local, tribal, state, and federal effort. The
USG treats crisis management and consequence management as a single, integrated function, rather than
separate functions IAW Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5. The framework outlines responsibilities
(including DOD) and provides an outline for coordinating civil-military requirements.
13-3. In addition, the NRF is designed to ensure that all levels of government have the capability to work
efficiently and effectively using a national approach to domestic incident management. It serves as the core
strategic national-level plan for coordinating incident management activities for terrorist attacks, disasters,
and incidents of national significance. The DOD could be asked to provide capabilities that other agencies
do not possess, have exhausted, or that have been overwhelmed, under the authority of the mission process
or immediate response authority. Support is provided with the provision it does not conflict with DOD’s
mission or its ability to respond to military operational contingencies.
13-4. The NRF employs a functional approach to response using emergency support functions that group the
type of assistance a state will need, as well as operations support to sustain response actions. MA
responsibilities are identified in Emergency Support Function #8 (Public Health and Medical Services)
activities. The Department of Health and Human Services is the lead federal agency for Emergency Support
Function #8 based on authorities, resources, capabilities, and expertise in a specific area. Lead federal
agencies, in conjunction with their support agencies, are responsible for overall planning and coordination of
the delivery of support function-related assistance to their state counterparts.
13-5. United States Northern Command and United States Indo-Pacific Command have principal
responsibility for coordinating military assistance under national planning frameworks such as the NRF. This
support normally includes personnel, equipment, and supplies in the absence of other national disaster system
resource capabilities. The NRF is only one of five national planning frameworks (prevention, protection,
mitigation, response, and disaster recovery).
DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES 
13-6. There are numerous mass fatality scenarios (natural, manmade, or terrorist incidents) where DOD may
be asked to support. These events can overwhelm and exceed capabilities of local, tribal, state, and federal
authorities.
13-7. The responsibility for responding to disasters and emergencies rests with local and state authorities.
The local and state medical examiner or coroner have jurisdictional responsibility for MA. During mass
fatality incidents, local resources are used first, and then state or neighboring state resources are used if
Chapter 13 
13-2
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
necessary. The state (Governors or representatives) requests federal assistance through the NRF. Limited MA 
assets are available through Emergency Support Function #8. If requested, the Secretary of Defense can 
approve requests for the mission assignment of military MA to assist. 
DIRECTIONS AND GUIDANCE 
13-8. The President and Secretary of Defense establish priorities and determine what DOD resources will be
available for DSCA operations. GCCs will ensure that resources are used judiciously by adhering to the
following principles:
⚫
Provide DOD resources only when requirements exceed the capabilities of civil authorities (as
determined by the FEMA or another primary federal agency).
⚫
Staffing of military forces remains under military C2 under the authority of the DOD lead agent
at all times.
⚫
Use the incident command system within National Incident Management System for civilian
communities. The MA units assisting civil authorities will have to interface with the incident
command system and ensure the DOD chain of command maintains situational awareness of the
civilian incident. The incident commander is responsible for all aspects of the disaster site and
normally works out of the incident command post. When authorizing DOD assets, a unified
command structure establishes and ensures an integrated response. The lead law enforcement
agency and medical examiner or coroner will determine procedures and the handling of all forensic
evidence.
CIVILIAN MASS-FATALITY INCIDENTS 
13-9. The DOD may provide Dover Air Force Base Port Mortuary as an option available following a mass
fatality incident to civilian authorities, like in the humanitarian relief mission of the earthquake in Haiti. An
incident of this type will generally result in considerable confusion and a lack of personnel to handle the
caring of the deceased. Federal, state, and local governments may request DOD assistance. Once properly
tasked, military support must be provided quickly and efficiently.
13-10. Unlike DSCA operations, DOD conducts foreign humanitarian assistance operations outside of the
U.S. homeland. Foreign humanitarian assistance operations are DOD activities, normally in support of the
United States Agency for International Development or Department of State, conducted outside of the U.S.
and its territories to relieve or reduce human suffering, disease, hunger, or privation. See JP 3-29 for further
guidance and information on foreign humanitarian assistance.
13-11. The procedures used by outside agencies requesting MA support are found in DSCA. The Stafford
Act also provides the procedures for declaring an emergency or major disaster, as well as the type and amount
of federal assistance available. See JP 3-28 for further guidance.
13-12. The DOD provides temporary support to civil authorities when permitted by law. DSCA operations
are routinely undertaken when an emergency overtaxes the civil authorities and are quite often multiagency
and multi-jurisdictional.
13-13. Support provided by DOD mortuary affairs will be tailored to the needs of the supported authority.
This support may include transporting fatalities, assisting in ID, or, as a last resort, assisting in temporary
interment. For example, the DOD provided Army MA personnel to operate MACPs in New York City and
Washington, D.C. during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 pandemic, including an advisor/planner assigned
to the New Jersey region as an MAO. Federal and local laws regulate how operations are conducted. The
local medical examiner or coroner with jurisdictional authority (city, county, or state) over the mass fatalities
will determine what and how functions are performed.
13-14. The medical examiner or coroner, and lead law enforcement agency have approval authority over
all MA site activities. The medical examiner or coroner only controls the HR in most jurisdictions (local laws
will define full authority). They will also manage ante mortem data collection, next of kin notifications, and
PE policies for the deceased. Other site activities will be governed by the incident commander or designated
representative.

ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
13-3
13-15. Within the mission assignment, a civilian point of contact is provided to the tasked unit to begin the
military and civilian integration process. Coordination between the military and civilian agencies should
incorporate—
⚫
How both agencies will interface operations involving—
▪
Other efforts affecting the MA mission.
▪
Other elements present.
▪
Overall operations layout.
⚫
Civilian special operating instructions and requirements.
⚫
Military requirements.
⚫
Retention of military responsibility for safety and care of their personnel within the context of the
civilian effort. Coordination should be made with civilian and other military entities to limit risk
and promote safe operations.
13-16. The medical examiner or coroner, depending on the incident, will work with the military and civilian
incident commander’s public media relations representative. Together they will determine how media
operations will be conducted, and how photographic materials will be used. Military personnel will follow
command guidance on how to interact with the media.
13-17. All recovery information should be documented as required by the medical examiner or coroner with
jurisdiction.
13-18. The MA tasks that can be requested in support of civil authorities include reception, advising,
photography, administrative and logistic support, DNA sample collection, S&R, transportation, fatality
storage (refrigerated), and disposition operations. In addition, DOD can be asked to provide contamination
mitigation support of the deceased. To accomplish the vast variety of potential assignments, DOD will
integrate other agencies along with MA personnel to conduct operations.
13-19. MA units may be asked to provide basic mortuary just in time training to non-MA units and other
augmentation personnel. MA will provide technical advisors for oversight and assistance insuring proper
techniques, safety considerations, and rightful respect for the deceased.
LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 
13-20. If an incident is caused by a terrorist or suspected terrorist act, or involves weapons of mass
destruction, it then becomes a crime scene. If such crimes are suspected, then all clothing, articles, and debris
are now potential evidence and should be carefully preserved.
13-21. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is the lead agency with jurisdiction over the investigation of all
weapons of mass destruction incidents. They will coordinate the MA activities with the medical examiner or
coroner to ensure the collection of evidence, including on or in the deceased is complete. Normally,
contamination mitigation of the deceased will involve forensic documentation and collection on the
contamination mitigation line. Military contamination mitigation teams should ensure a complete plan is in
place, and that law enforcement agencies and the medical examiner or coroner have concurred before
operations begin.
13-22. During the integration process and ongoing operations, there may be some unresolved issues or
disputed areas. If unable to resolve issues, commanders should seek additional higher HQ guidance. It is
important to remember the military and civilian efforts should be a partnership focused on providing the best
and most appropriate consequence management response to the American people. To do this, it requires both
parties to develop a cooperative relationship and positive attitude addressing the needs of the military and
civilian community. Commanders should consult with their servicing office of the staff judge advocates and
involve them in the process.
13-23. CONUS installations may have losses even if a fatality event occurs partially or completely off of
the installation. The medical examiner or coroner will most likely establish an emergency family assistance
center to collect ante mortem data from the families, complete notifications of death, and provide assistance
to next of kin as required. Installation and Service component commanders should consider pre-planning
Chapter 13 
13-4
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
with local authorities, and offer help with casualty assistance officers, in local emergency family assistance 
centers with the military members’ data collection, notifications, and return of PE. 
13-24. Below are types of federal military installation jurisdictions—
⚫
Exclusive jurisdiction is an area over which the federal government exercises and maintains legal
control without interference from the jurisdiction and administration of state law.
⚫
Concurrent jurisdiction exists when both state and federal governments retain all their legislative
authority.
⚫
Partial jurisdiction exists when both state and federal authorities have some legislative authorities,

Health and Safety Information for Mortuary Affairs 
One of the intrinsic dangers of mortuary affairs operations is the sustained contact with 
human remains. This exposes mortuary affairs personnel to special physical and mental 
risks. Proper personal health and sanitation practices are vitally important, as handling 
remains in various stages of decomposition can potentially carry infectious organisms 
and operation-specific chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. The 
related exposure to many unique psychological stressors poses a threat to the morale, 
welfare, and spiritual well-being of mortuary affairs personnel. Therefore, each Service 
member involved in recovery, evacuation, or processing of remains must ensure strict 
adherence to all Occupational Safety and Health Administration procedures, as well as 
unit behavioral health programs and stress reduction techniques before, during, and 
after deployment. 
SECTION I – OPERATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND OCCUPATIONAL 
SAFETY 
A-1. This section covers occupational health and safety considerations, infectious disease considerations,
ergonomic safety, recommended minimum PPE standards, and handwashing for personal hygiene. The safety
standards developed for MA personnel can also be located in TG 195A.
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS 
A-2. To reduce exposure to pathogens, personnel conducting MA functions should—
⚫
Adhere to the industry standard precautions for Occupational Safety and Health Administration
procedures when dealing with HR outlined in TG 195A.
⚫
Develop and implement an effective safety and health program that identifies and manages risks
associated with workplace hazards that include, but are not limited to—
▪
Blood borne pathogens and other potentially infectious materials (29 CFR 1910.1030).
▪
Hazardous chemicals (29 CFR 1910.1200).
▪
Musculoskeletal injuries (MIL-STD-1472H page 415, DA PAM 40-21, and DAFMAN
91-203).
▪
Stress associated with handling HR (consult with chaplain or mental health team).
A-3. Planning considerations for MA personnel safety include—
⚫
PPE (levels, items, size, quantity, and resupply).
⚫
Water source for sanitation of workstations and personnel.
⚫
Medical support requirements and access to the nearest MTF in the event of occupational
exposure, injury, or illness.
⚫
Cleaning supplies, including cleaning solutions and plastic brushes for wiping away biohazards.
⚫
EOD inspection procedures.
⚫
Biohazard storage and disposal.
⚫
Access to a burn site and required PPE for burning biohazardous material.
⚫
Documenting suspected or known occupational and environmental health or CBRN exposures
IAW DODD 6490.02E.
Appendix A 
A-2
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
A-4. Personnel responsible for biohazardous material disposal must ensure compliance with the safety
requirements outlined by the Code of Federal Regulations for Environmental Compliance, established
intergovernmental agreements, and GCC interim operational policy for environmental compliance:
⚫
Use proper PPE IAW established safety and sanitation guidelines.
⚫
Incinerate all disposable protective clothing, bandages, dressings, sheets, towels, and other items
coming into direct contact with the HR or body fluids.
⚫
Develop a contingency plan in the event that an incinerator is not available at their location.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONSIDERATIONS 
A-5. Many infectious agents associated with medical and paramedical environments are classified as
opportunistic pathogens or microbial agents normally considered to be of low virulence. Such organisms are
commonly associated with HR and environmental areas adjacent to the storage of HR. The implementation
of personal health and sanitation procedures as outlined in TG 195A will help prevent—
⚫
Spreading diseases from HR to personnel working in or located at an MA facility.
⚫
Contracting diseases from the MA facility environment (for example, walls, floors, protective
clothing, equipment, and supplies used to handle and process HR) by individuals who work in or
visit an MA facility.
⚫
Spreading contracted or carried diseases between people.
A-6. Leaders responsible for MA personnel should—
⚫
Incorporate occupational health and operational public health preventive medicine measures into
plans to identify requirements and resources available to MA personnel.
⚫
Identify procedures for reporting blood-borne pathogen exposure to medical authorities. Annual
blood-borne pathogen training is required for all MA personnel.
⚫
Identify behavioral health support available to MA personnel and establish procedures for
accessing that capability. This includes critical debriefing and interventional counseling assets.
⚫
Identify occupational health or preventive medicine operational public health support available to
MA personnel and establish procedures for accessing that capability.
⚫
Identify immunization requirements for personnel upon completion of their respective DOD-
affiliated technical training. The same environmental hazards exist for medical and MA personnel
and immunization requirements should be a standard prophylaxis.
⚫
Ensure baseline immunization requirements and testing include (at a minimum), hepatitis B,
human immunodeficiency virus (also called HIV), tuberculosis, and tetanus. Additional
immunizations may be required based on the hazards in the region; check with the supporting
immunization department for a complete list of recommended immunizations.
ERGONOMIC SAFETY 
A-7. Engineering controls and equipment for lifting, moving, transferring, pushing, pulling, and any other
manual handling tasks should be considered and used whenever possible. In an environment where use of an
engineering control is not feasible, use administrative controls (for example, ensuring the proper number of
lifters) as dictated by MIL STD 1472H.
A-8. Use proper lifting technique to execute single-person lifts safely. There are three basic methods of
lifting: straight back-bent knees, free-style, and kinetic. Each has advantages and limitations.
A-9. Seek and obtain assistance when required to manually move heavy or unusually shaped items. Never
attempt to move these items alone. When two or more people are required to move or carry an object, adjust
the load so each person bears an equal amount. Test lifts should be made before proceeding. The key to lifts
using two or more personnel is to make every move in unison. One person should be designated to call out
the moves to keep the team in unison. The supervisor and workers are responsible for assessing all available
methods described above to safely handle materials and use mechanical assistance whenever possible.

MINIMUM PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT STANDARDS 
A-11. For the minimum PPE standards required for an MA activity or task, see table 4-1 on page 4-5.
SECTION II – FIELD SANITATION AND HYGIENE CONSIDERATIONS 
A-12. This section covers personal hygiene, hand washing, regulated medical waste, showers, and laundry
for MA occupational health and safety.
A-13. After removing PPE, it is vital to wash both the hands and arms to reduce the risk of infection and
transmission of any pathogenic agents to which MA personnel may be exposed. Follow these hand washing
procedures:
⚫
Wet hands and arms under clean hot or warm water.
⚫
Apply soap and work into a rich lather.
⚫
Scrub vigorously for a minimum of 30 seconds.
⚫
Rinse under clean hot or warm water.
⚫
Dry immediately with clean, disposable towels.
⚫
Dispose of towels in the appropriate biohazardous waste container.
⚫
Avoid making direct contact with the wash station using a bare hand.
⚫
Always use a clean towel to turn the faucet off after use.
REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE 
A-14. Regulated medical waste is potentially capable of causing disease in personnel and can pose a risk to
health if not disposed of properly. MA personnel should wear disposable gloves at a minimum when handling
regulated medical waste. For more information on regulated waste, see TM 3-34.56, NAVFAC MO-213/AFR
91-8/TM 5-634, TB MED 593, and Service and CCMD-specific regulations.
A-15. Examples of regulated medical waste include—
⚫
Blood.
⚫
Bodily fluids.
⚫
Items contaminated with blood or bodily fluids.
⚫
Wastewater from facility and equipment cleaning or self-care when contaminated with blood or
bodily fluids.
⚫
Used medical sharps.
⚫
PPE soiled with the above.
A-16. A waste disposal contractor within CONUS and OCONUS generally removes regulated medical waste.
Contact the higher HQ or local medical treatment facility to determine the means of disposal available in the
AOR.
A-17. For more information on regulated medical waste, see references for medical waste management for
deployed forces.

03 August 2022 
SHOWERS AND LAUNDRY 
A-18. The requirements listed in ATP 4-42 provide for shower and laundry support. The AFMES requires
that DOD-affiliated MA personnel, along with other personnel working in direct contact with human remains,
will require additional showers and laundry for occupational health and cleanliness. The logistics command
supporting the MA teams in their AO will ensure and coordinate for the MA teams to receive the additional
showering and laundry support.
A-19. When MA personnel process HR and PE, they will require additional showering and the laundering of
clothing to remove blood-borne pathogens, especially during a change in shift. Additional showers and
laundry contribute to the prevention of spreading biohazardous pathogens that could lead to sickness among
all personnel that potentially share living space. Dealing with death and grief on a daily basis has a significant
impact on the MA teams’ physical and mental health. Personal cleansing following this type of shift work
may not allow the team to completely forget what they have seen; however, it does provide a modicum of
physical and mental comfort after the end of their duty day. Thus, the hygienic benefits of showering and
fresh, clean laundry promote morale, safety, and overall good health, and therefore is paramount to mission
success.
SECTION III – STRESS, RESILIENCY, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORT 
A-20. The DOD MA mission places unique stressors on the military and civilian personnel charged with this
mission. The AFMES and other MA personnel are limited to six-month tours of duty on a rotating basis
during long operations. Following deployments, leaders must ensure personnel have the opportunity to
decompress after recurring and repeated exposure to the unique circumstances of this mission. Coordination
should be made with the home station or local chaplain and behavioral health personnel to plan and
implement a decompression program for DOD Service members and civilians upon return to home station.
CONCEPT OF RESILIENCE 
A-21. Responses to environmental conditions and experiential circumstances are varied and unique to the
individual. Consequently, similar circumstances may have differing risk levels based upon the personal
resilience of the individual. An individual’s response to stress is relative, not absolute, and the degree of
resistance to stressors varies over time. Resilience in the face of adversity is an interactive process, one that
depends upon the operation of protective factors and interactive processes within the individual and the
environment.
A-22. Stressful experiences may either strengthen the resilience of Service members or make them more
sensitive to future adversity. Resilience is the ability of an individual to “bounce back” from adverse
circumstances and life changes. It is characterized by action, with a definite aim in mind, and a strategy of
how to achieve that objective based on self-esteem, self-confidence, and belief in one’s own ability to deal
with change. The self-confidence that fosters resilience and positive adaptive behaviors can be cultivated
through mastery experiences. Guidelines presented here are designed to help personnel achieve successful
mastery experiences throughout the planning, execution, and follow up of operations involving death and the
dead.
A-23. Stressors can occur prior to, during, and after an operation, and may manifest themselves long after the
conclusion of the event.
ANTICIPATION 
A-24. Apprehension or anxiety prior to a mortuary operation is normal. Mortuary personnel may wonder
what they will see and do, how they will react, how they will be seen by others, and what they will tell their
family. Leadership should present information accurately, neither exaggerating risks nor ignoring questions
and concerns. No amount of training can fully prepare MA personnel for every possible scenario, and even
experienced personnel can be apprehensive about confronting new issues and stressful events. Leadership
can use anticipation to assuage fears of contamination from nuclear, biological, and chemical material by
directly addressing the risks and fears inherent to these operations.
Health and Safety Information for Mortuary Affairs 
03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
A-5
A-25. Assuring MA personnel that PPE and contamination detection devices are on-hand, and that medical
support is available in the event contamination is detected, can help to mitigate potential stressors for MA
personnel. Regardless of whether the scenario is for training purposes or in preparation for an actual mission,
leaders should elicit questions and facilitate discussion amongst team members. Personnel should be
reminded that no question is stupid, and that others may have similar concerns. Leaders should share personal
experiences with the MA mission and encourage others to do the same. Leaders may also find it useful to
remind personnel that each mission and situation is unique, and that they may never be comfortable handling
all types of HR.
PAST EXPERIENCE 
A-26. Having workers with prior operational experience is extremely valuable for training and supporting
inexperienced personnel. Leaders should not avoid discussions about Service members’ bad experiences, but
instead consider them prime opportunities to teach their personnel. Mission participation can either become
a mastery experience for a Service member, or it could be a traumatic event for that person and their team.
One way for leaders to approach the topic is to ask people about their fears and anxieties, and whether their
fears are based on a past experience or anticipation of the unknown. There could be strategies to help the
Service member get through future experiences, such as by pairing the Service member with another
experienced member of similar rank and age.
COMMON STRESSORS 
A-27. Leaders should tell personnel what they are likely to experience and offer suggestions as to how they
can approach the situation from both a physical and mental standpoint. For example, when working with PE,
personnel are likely to encounter details of the deceased’s personal life, or they may experience
overwhelming sensory (sight, smells, and sounds) stimulation while working with the HR. The following
paragraphs outline the most common stressors and offer suggestions for potential strategies to mitigate their
immediate effects.
Personal Effects 
A-28. For many, exposure to and handling of PE is more difficult than handling HR. The deceased are likely
to have photos, letters, watches, or rings, all of which can provoke thoughts about the deceased’s life. The
personal material contained within electronic media presents its own unique set of challenges. Exposure to
personal material can inadvertently draw one into the story of the deceased’s life. As one learns more about
the deceased, emotions may become involved and feelings of loss and grief are more likely. It is best to keep
exposure to a minimum by taking breaks, avoid dwelling on the PE or their content, and avoid becoming
emotionally involved. It may help personnel to share their thoughts with others, and keep in mind that the
family will appreciate what is being done for their loved one.
Sights 
A-29. Mortuary personnel may see a wide variety of causes and manners of death like penetrating wounds,
blasts, burns, drownings, accidents, suicides, homicides, and natural deaths. Reactions to HR may include
surprise, shock, horror, curiosity, anger, and grief. Some HR, such as remains of children, are more
universally stressful to process. The remains of family or friends, as well as deceased Service members who
were about the same age, sex, race, and wearing the same uniform also tend to be stressful.
A-30. Exposure to HR should be kept to a minimum to reduce the risk of emotional involvement. Some stress
reduction techniques include—
⚫
Avoid looking at the hands or face.
⚫
Do not dwell on the cause or manner of death.
⚫
Avoid imagining what the person’s last moments might have been like.
⚫
Remember the soul is gone and the worker is performing a job.

03 August 2022
Smells 
A-31. Unpleasant odors associated with HR cannot be avoided and people are likely to feel sick when they
first encounter them. Some supervisors will recommend using masks or applying a masking smell like
menthol cream below or inside nostrils (a potential drawback is that the masking smell may become
associated with the particular work). Mouth breathing tends to be an effective way of diminishing unpleasant
odors. While some people can become used to the unpleasant odors associated with their duties, adaptation
is often very difficult, if not impossible.
A-32. The memory has an excellent ability to recall scents, as well as associate those scents to past events
and experiences. One should not be surprised to discover they recognize scents associated with their work
outside the mortuary setting. Fortunately, these effects tend to be short in duration.
THREE TYPICAL PHASES OF AN OPERATION 
A-33. The following information describes the three typical phases of an operation: prior to operations,
during operations, and after operations.
PRE-DEPLOYMENT 
A-34. Training and education are the primary methods of building the adaptive skills to use when facing
adversity. Training should include the essentials of behavioral health support, including skills for self-help
and helping others. The goal is to have units where Service members monitor and support one another. At a
minimum, training should teach personnel to—
⚫
Recognize mental health issues in oneself and others.
⚫
Use adaptive skills and stress reduction techniques.
⚫
Build supportive relationships.
⚫
Overcome barriers to seeking care.
⚫
Access care.
A-35. As opposed to passive learning experiences (for example, viewing slides), this training can be
integrated into daily operations and across deployment cycles. Experiential training that involves the learner,
such as group discussions, role playing, and exercises that integrate behavioral issues into an operational
training event, are more likely to be assimilated and become part of the operational routine. While some
training is best delivered by behavioral health professionals, stress management training is best delivered by
commanders and peers who can present the training in realistic scenarios that consider the strategic and
operational impact of the mission. Commanding officers can consult with behavioral health professionals
regarding the content of the stress management training they provide.
Training for Challenging Experiences 
A-36. Training that addresses experiences MA personnel may find stressful provides an opportunity to talk
about approaches and techniques that may be helpful in the future. Examples of potentially challenging topics
include—
⚫
Working with potentially distressing HR:
▪
A child or pregnant woman.
▪
A decedent who was known and cared for.
▪
Partial, decomposed, or gruesome HR.
▪
A decedent who suffered prior to death.
▪
Burned HR (for example, coping with smells).
▪
Contaminated HR (for example, contamination by CBRN).
▪
Mass death (for example, following a pandemic or natural disaster).
⚫
Interacting with unit members and family members of the deceased.
⚫
Working under fire or recovery missions in dangerous locales.
⚫
Working in austere environments.

03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
A-7
⚫
Observing people enduring extreme suffering and hardship (for example, without food or
resources).
⚫
Conducting operations when systems and resources are overwhelmed (for example, following use
of weapons of mass destruction).
A-37. Training does not make one invulnerable to stress or ensure the individual will not feel distress when
confronted by adverse situations. However, training can develop the experience and skills necessary to build
the resilience required to face adversity, and to aid in achieving mastery experiences.
A-38. Consulting behavioral health professionals regarding the content of stress management training cannot
be stressed enough to commanders charged with the MA mission.
Behavioral Health Support Within the Unit 
A-39. Consulting with local supporting behavioral health providers on distress recognition is particularly
important for commanders and is strongly encouraged. Training should include being alert to signs of distress,
being open and approachable by subordinates, providing support (for example, listening skills and offering
guidance and advice), and knowing when and to whom to make referrals. It is a commander’s responsibility
to ensure personnel know what support is available, how to access it, and how to promote a healthy
environment. Service members should support one another and encourage each other to seek help.
A-40. Commanders and support personnel should talk to MA personnel regularly and listen for signs of
distress. Peer support and buddy care involves teaching personnel to watch out for one another, being mindful
of signs of distress, providing support, encouraging communication, and assisting a distressed individual in
seeking professional help if needed. There are DOD-affiliated civilian personnel that endure the same
stressors as their military counterparts working within the MA community, and ensuring support is available
is a command responsibility.
Behavioral Health Support Outside the Unit 
A-41. Pre-operational medical assessments have standard procedures to detect specific behavioral health
problems. Formal behavioral health screening is not conducted. Current evidence does not support universal
mental health screening beyond what is recommended the by U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and
required Periodic Health and Deployment Health Assessments in accordance with current DOD and Service
policy.
DEPLOYED ENVIRONMENT 
A-42. A theater may have varying levels of support to MA personnel. It is helpful to have visibility from
higher command and civilian authorities, but not to the extent that it hinders operations. Isolation of the
working units should be avoided. Depending on the support arrangements, MA personnel can be isolated by
design or by accident. Visits by mobile mental health teams and religious service providers should be
encouraged; however, these visits should ideally be made by personnel with prior experience with the MA
mission or have demonstrated a willingness to learn.
Jurisdiction, Authority, and Cultural Awareness 
A-43. There should be clear lines of command authority and jurisdiction. This can be difficult with a mixture
of military Services, civilian authorities, and workers from other nations. This authority extends to the
requirement for security of operations, property, and personnel. Leaders must provide an organization and a
structure to manage the scene and the necessary personnel and equipment to accomplish the job. Cultural
norms should be considered at every step in a disaster situation. A consultant familiar with the local religion,
customs, and traditions should be available to command.
Managing Exposure and Work Fatigue 
A-44. Due to the effects of strong visual and olfactory stimuli, the duration of exposure to HR should be kept
to a minimum. Though MA personnel may desire to work until the mission is completed, schedules should
be managed with the mindset that the mental and physical health of the attendants are paramount. Personnel
Appendix A 
A-8
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
should be encouraged to take breaks, leave the work area, and to rest during the course of their duties. 
Neglecting one’s physical condition (hydration, food, and ergonomics) can contribute to the deterioration of 
both mental and physical health. Schedules should not be unrealistic, such as three shifts per day or working 
until the entire job is completed, in order to facilitate the long-term health of MA personnel. Supervisors 
must be vigilant in monitoring the stress of their subordinates and take measures appropriate to the individual 
and situation. 
Encourage Verbal Interaction 
A-45. Personnel should be encouraged to communicate their thoughts, feelings, and concerns to their peers,
and to trained professionals in the behavioral health and chaplain communities. The experience of being
around death has the propensity to lend one to introspection and to withdraw from their environment.
Conversations about topics unrelated to the MA mission can help others penetrate this shell and to lessen the
stressors of this mission. Humor is one way to relieve stress; however, caution should be exercised to ensure
humor does not become detrimental to unit morale, the mission, or the wider Army and U.S. community.
Humor should never be used in reference to the deceased as this violates the dignity, respect, and reverence
of our fallen comrades.
Experienced Versus Inexperienced Personnel 
A-46. Experienced Service members are extremely valuable in training younger inexperienced personnel. It
is recommended that inexperienced personnel be paired with experienced personnel. However, not all
experience is good. A Service member who has had a bad previous experience could cause negative reactions
in an inexperienced Service member. Pairing should be with people who are compatible and feel comfortable
working together. The experienced Service member should adopt the role of a mentor.
Motivation 
A-47. People can do very difficult things when they understand the importance of what they are doing. It is
recommended that personnel be reminded of the positive aspects of their work. MA personnel are part of a
long and faithful tradition of service:
⚫
Care of the dead is an American priority and a pillar of every branch of the military.
⚫
All who depart in the defense of this nation will return.
⚫
Care of our fallen soldiers is a national tradition and source of pride.
⚫
When we respect our fallen, should we fall, we can expect the same level of respect in return.
⚫
Our nation owes a tremendous debt to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, and we will
carry this tradition of honor forward.
A-48. Remind personnel their work has implications beyond the immediate operation which may include:
⚫
Affording family and loved ones the opportunity for closure.
⚫
Knowledge that the fallen was respectfully cared for can provide a degree of comfort to their
families and loved ones.
⚫
Knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the event facilitates the grieving process of family
and friends and helps them heal from their tragedy.
⚫
Alleviates some of the burden in preparing for funerals, monuments, and memorials.
Healthy Behaviors 
A-49. Sleep and maintaining a good work/life balance is crucial to the overall health of MA personnel.
Encouraging rest, exercise, hobbies, and other enjoyable activities, and remaining in touch with family,
friends, and loved ones is a key component to maintaining overall individual and unit health and well-being.
Behavioral Health Support Within the Unit 
A-50. During operations, commanders and peers can provide support by being available to talk and listen to
a distressed individual. Peer support becomes more challenging when there are too few personnel at an
Health and Safety Information for Mortuary Affairs 
03 August 2022 
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
A-9
operational location. There may be few people to talk to and no one to relieve stressed personnel of their 
duties, especially when the operating tempo is high. Personnel may have little to no peer support from military 
personnel outside of their environment. This may be in part due to not having trained or deployed with the 
larger units to which they have been attached for support. 
A-51. Ostracism by non-MA personnel is an occupational hazard of the mission. Others may consider MA
personnel to be bad luck, different, or find it difficult to relate to them. This could potentially be humiliating,
demoralizing, and place additional burdens on an already stressful mission. Supervisors should actively
engage and participate with the wider military community to help reduce this form of stress.
Behavioral Health Support Outside the Unit 
A-52. Other resources can be available depending on the support in the immediate AO. MTFs typically have
mobile combat stress teams and clinics with professional support. Chaplains can provide spiritual support
and counseling, if desired. Commanders can request a site visit from a behavioral support team such as
combat and operational stress control. Routine visits by the support team may facilitate acceptance and reduce
barriers to seeking care when needed. The goal for behavioral support during operations is to provide the
support as near to the operation as possible and keep the distressed individual with their unit.
Critical Events 
A-53. If personnel experience a specific potentially traumatic event, the command may conduct an
operational debriefing or after action review. A group reconstruction of events is not a mental health
intervention in which people are encouraged or required to talk about their feelings. It will help participants
learn what other people did, what was learned, and how others experienced the event in what may have been
a novel situation. This is a time for teaching, and this type of communication helps to build experience. The
debriefing or review should not require attendees to talk about the traumatic aspects of the event or how they
reacted to it as such a requirement may increase distress.
A-54. It may be necessary to talk about all aspects of a traumatic event if doing so increases survivability
during subsequent operations. Commands can acknowledge that people may be feeling distress and set the
tone for recovery by stating that individuals may be experiencing normal reactions to a difficult event and
that food, rest, exercise, leisure activities, camaraderie, talking about the event (when one is ready to talk),
contacting loved ones, and the passage of time are likely to reduce distress. A point of contact should be
provided in case individuals have questions after the debriefing or review is over.
Families of Mortuary Personnel 
A-55. Leadership should be aware of the needs of the families of MA personnel. This can be done by giving
family members a briefing on the general aspects of the operation and facilitating communication between
personnel and families. Leadership can inform families what they can do to support their family member
before, during, and after the operation.
POST-DEPLOYMENT 
A-56. After operations, it is helpful to have a period of decompression where personnel remain together, but
workload is minimal. This can be a time to acknowledge and reward personnel for the work performed. There
may be screenings to assess well-being, and briefings and educational opportunities provided after
deployment. They can address and normalize the potential psychological impact of the work, and reinforce
personal skills related to attaching meaning to the event and mastering feelings. While still together,
personnel continue to support one another and transition as a group towards garrison and home life.
A-57. Post-deployment screenings should be conducted in accordance with current DOD and Service policy.
Upon return from deployment, MA personnel complete a mental health assessment that is integrated into the
DOD Periodic Health Assessment. However, they may require additional screening intended to aid in early
identification and intervention of behavioral health conditions. This will enable access for deployed personnel
to available behavioral health and other support resources.

ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
Recognition and Rewards 
A-58. Personnel should be recognized for their work following its completion. This may involve awards,
commendations, and letters of recommendation. Sincerely thanking MA personnel may often serve as an
impactful and beneficial form of appreciation.
Training 
A-59. Reintegration to the family, home, and unit can be a source of stress for those returning from
deployment. This is not limited to the MA mission itself, but also includes everyday challenges such as
finances and legal matters. Briefings as to what one can expect upon return are beneficial to both the MA
personnel as well as their families and can help alleviate some of the distress faced upon the member’s return.
Leave Time 
A-60. There is often a tendency to have personnel resume work immediately. It is advisable to allow some
time off to relax and take care of business that may have gone untended for some time. Some will want time
with family or friends while others may want to be alone.
Return to Work 
A-61. Unsympathetic leaders can place an unnecessary burden upon personnel transitioning from the MA
mission to normal duties. Leadership should be aware of the unique experiences of former MA personnel
and exercise vigilance to identify any potential signs of distress on the part of that individual.
A-62. In garrison, behavioral health support is available from military behavioral health clinics. Additional
resources can be obtained through Military OneSource, respective Service Family Support Centers, and other

Mortuary Affairs Reporting and Tracking System 
MARTS is used to store official DOD information related to Service members who die 
in a theater of operations. This system is the Army MA program of record for the 
reporting, tracking, and evacuation of both HR and PE during MA operations. The 
primary users of the system are MA personnel conducting operations at established or 
designated MA facilities during combat operations. 
MORTUARY AFFAIRS REPORTING AND TRACKING SYSTEM 
B-1. MARTS is used by all Service branches and DOD personnel to provide real-time tracking of HR and
PE from an MACP to a final destination, such as the CONUS port mortuary or JPED, both located at Dover
Air Force Base, Delaware. During combat operations, MARTS provides MA personnel with the ability to
electronically record information in real time and generate DOD forms on the recovery, preparation, and
evacuation of HR and PE. MARTS has three main functional areas, each with specific subsections for data
recording:
⚫
MACP operations—initial data entry relating to HR or PE in a TO.
⚫
MACP management—manage incidents of fatalities, associate/import DCIPS fatalities, and
define capabilities and roles of MACPs.
⚫
Administration—grant new user access to MARTS by assigning MACP roles, privileges to roles,
and deletion of functions in MARTS.
B-2. MARTS is hosted on the DCIPS website portal. Access is restricted to authorized users only. For
detailed information on system description, capabilities, functions, and access requirements, authorized users
can refer to the MARTS User Manual and HRC Access Policy at the JMAC milSuite site (website information
listed in references).
RESPONSIBILITIES 
B-3. The configuration control board chaired by the Chief, Troops Support Division, HQDA deputy chief
of staff, G-4 provides functional oversite of MARTS. The Army G-4 provides the required funding for the
operation and sustainment of the system, which is performed by the Army assistant chief of staff, personnel.
The Director of Supply, deputy chief of staff, G-4 is the approving authority for all changes, proposals, and
upgrades to MARTS. The MARTS configuration control board consists of representatives from all Services.
The configuration control board provides effective and efficient management of the MARTS configuration,
using a structured process to consider proposed changes and incorporate them into specified MARTS releases
to meet the needs of joint forces.
B-4. The Army HRC hosts MARTS for the Army G-4 and is responsible for—
⚫
Performing technical operation and maintenance of MARTS.
⚫
Performing hardware, software, and technical security upgrades to MARTS to include normal
maintenance activities.
⚫
Performing bug fixes and enhancements to the MARTS application when requested by the Army
G-4.
⚫
Vetting and creating user accounts (through the Army HRC DCIPS support team) to access the
DCIPS web portal where MARTS resides:
▪
The Army HRC collaborates with TSCs that have established a TMAO to assist them with
the setup and configuration of TMEPs and MACPs for a particular theater.
Appendix B 
B-2
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
▪
The theater MA officer should contact the DCIPS support team as soon as MA activities
employment is determined.
B-5. AFMAO, as the CONUS port mortuary, utilizes MARTS in the operations control center to track HR
from a TO until arrival at Dover Air Force Base for the dignified transfer. The command, control, and
communications controllers use MARTS to receive information on HR and disassociated portions in transit
from MACPs and TMEPs and input the arrival of the HR to Dover Air Force Base. MARTS access will only
be granted to USAF personnel who are currently responsible for management of an MACP within a CCMD
where MARTS is being utilized, AFMAO staff, aerial port staff, or select training cadre at Silver Flag Sites.
B-6. The AFMES uses MARTS to track the flow of HR and gather data related to time of death, transit
issues, and estimated time of arrival at the port mortuary. Real-time information available in MARTS is
crucial to members who support the AFMES and is used throughout the MA program. The AFMES enlisted
personnel, medicolegal death investigators, and associate medical examiners only use MARTS for tracking,
as they do not input data. AFMES personnel will receive training and authorization upon assignment.
B-7. The JPED staff can use MARTS to answer PE-related questions from next of kin by accessing the PE
inventory that is uploaded to MARTS in theater. PE can arrive with the deceased Service member, or may
be shipped by the in-theater SCMO or PEIO. The JPED staff has real-time evacuation information from
forward MACPs and the TMEP. PE moving through the theater can be tracked from one facility or location
to another until arrival at the CONUS port mortuary or JPED.
B-8. The TMAO and senior MA staff NCO are responsible for coordinating with the HRC DCIPS data
manager to create the MA locations for a particular operation electronically in MARTS. The MA NCO and
MAO (with special skill identifier 4V) must be trained in MARTS to provide the appropriate level of
administrative support to MA forces and oversight of all data entries in MARTS for accuracy. The TMAO
staff and the MA NCOs assigned to a TSC should coordinate with JMAC for MARTS training to prepare
Service personnel for imminent deployments.
B-9. The TMAO will—
⚫
Act as approval and vetting authority for MARTS production site access for all requesting Service
members operating an authorized MACP, TPED, TMEP, or Air Force ASF.
⚫
Serve as theater MARTS administrator and point of contact between the HRC and units
performing the theater MA mission.
⚫
Coordinate with the HRC DCIPS data manager for the creation of MACP, TMEP, TPED, and Air
Force ASF locations for a designated TO.
⚫
Determine if requesting unit or Service personnel have a need-to-know to access MARTS.
⚫
Process and sign DD Form 2875 (System Authorization Access Request), as supervisor, for all
personnel granted MARTS access to perform MA functions in an MACP, TPED, or TMEP.
⚫
Submit all DD Form 2875 through the appropriate theater security manager for clearance
validation and digital signature IAW HRC access policy.
⚫
Assign authorized users to appropriate MA facilities in MARTS (MACP, TPED, or TMEP).
⚫
Activate user roles, permissions, and privileges in MARTS based on user functions at an MACP,
TPED, or TMEP.
⚫
Maintain a roster of all theater authorized MARTS users and send to HRC.
⚫
Notify HRC immediately to deactivate MARTS user account once the user access is no longer
required and before user departs the theater.
B-10. The JMAC, on behalf of HQDA, G-4, provides MARTS functional expertise, advance individual
training, and mobilization training to all Service components with MA units and personnel, and maintains
the administrative functions of the MARTS configuration control board. When requested, JMAC collaborates
with the HRC DCIPS support team to assist all the Services in obtaining MARTS training accounts in
preparation for deployments and training exercises, and to fulfill Service component command requirements.
The JMAC operations division also provides reach-back support to the TMAO on areas ranging from
troubleshooting, assignment of user roles, MACP management, and providing general guidance pertaining
to the usage and administration of MARTS.

UNIT LEVEL TRAINING 
B-11. To properly maintain the knowledge and skills required to master all the functional areas of MARTS,
unit commanders must incorporate MARTS into all unit-level training that supports the unit mission essential
task list (see the JMAC milSuite for more information). Units can use the MARTS User Manual to learn how
to use and navigate the system. Below are the MARTS-related MACP and TMEP critical tasks for 92M (MA
Specialist) and Marine Corps MOS 0471 that require quarterly training:
⚫
101-92M-1108 Input Data into the Mortuary Affairs Reporting and Tracking System.
⚫
101-92M-2106 Confirm Data Entry into the Mortuary Affairs Reporting and Tracking System.
⚫
101-92M-3120 Confirm the Mortuary Affairs Reporting and Tracking System.
⚫
101-92M-4720 Validate the Accuracy of Information in Mortuary Affairs Reporting and Tracking
System.
B-12. JMAC introduces and conducts training on MARTS as a system during MOS-producing institutional
training. While this training familiarizes Service members with MARTS and provides fundamental overall
knowledge, units will have to provide refresher training for personnel to develop individual skills and
improve proficiency. Army, Marine Corps, and Air & Space Forces units can request a staff assistance visit
to receive MARTS training as a train-the-trainer program. It is important that commanders consider
developing a quarterly training plan to ensure all Service members maintain proficiency in executing MARTS
functions. Additionally, Department of The Air Force cadre and SILVER flag instructors that train members
on MA operations should be required to participate in this training.
PRE-DEPLOYMENT TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GEOGRAPHIC COMBATANT
COMMANDS AND MORTUARY AFFAIRS STAFF PLANNERS 
B-13. In coordination with the GCC and the Service component command lead for MA, pre-deployment
requirements for MARTS to meet mission demands must be pre-coordinated in OPLANs. Paragraphs B-14
through B-19 can be used to develop a recommended special requirements message. GCCs can use the
aforementioned paragraphs to include the MARTS training requirements. Additional MA requirements can
be added to a force tracking number when identifying MA assets for a deployment to a specific AOR. The
MA staff planners must provide input including MARTS support requirements for TMAO operations as part
of the GCC’s OPLAN under the MA tab detailing the training, support requirements for access, and
instructions when real-time access is not available.
THEATER MARTS ACCESS 
B-14. Service members assigned to the following positions or locations require theater MARTS access:
⚫
TMAO.
⚫
MACP.
⚫
TMEP.
⚫
TPED, when established.
⚫
MA staff level positions.
⚫

Appendix D 
Religious Considerations in Mortuary Affairs 
Religious considerations are critical factors in mortuary affairs. Honoring and 
respecting the deceased with regard to religion and culture are important to the morale 
and resiliency of U.S. forces, and the public support of operations involving disaster 
and death. RSTs/RMTs are available to advise the command on the impact of religion 
on operations such as mortuary affairs. 
GENERAL GUIDANCE 
D-1. Beliefs and practices concerning how HR are to be treated differ between religious faiths, regions, and
subcultures within a country. Details for preparing HR, mourning, burial, or cremation practices affect joint
and multinational operations. MA personnel will treat all HR with the utmost respect, and within reason,
endeavor to handle the HR according to the practices, beliefs, and desires of the decedent, as much as the
circumstances and mission allow.
D-2. When handling remains of an indigenous population or HN, MA personnel should coordinate with HN
authorities and RSTs on specific religious practices associated with populations within the AO. Those
practices should be adhered to by the first unit that comes in contact with the HR and is responsible for
evacuation.
D-3. Chaplain support is made available to MA personnel for accessing behavioral health support.
RELIGIOUS MINISTRY SUPPORT FOR DEFENSE SUPPORT OF 
CIVIL AUTHORITIES 
D-4. Non-DOD federal fatality management assets under the National Disaster Medical System include
spiritual care capabilities, which may be deployed once a mission assignment has been approved. Upon
Secretary of Defense approval of DOD assistance, DOD chaplains provide primary support to DOD
personnel; chaplains may only provide support to non-DOD civilians in exceptional circumstances as
outlined in JG 1-05.
D-5. Considerations should be made for interment and disinterment operations. RSTs/RMTs are available
to advise MA personnel on the religious impacts of interment and disinterment operations, to include
advisement regarding appropriate religious elements offered in conjunction with these operations. Examples
of these services include prayers to consecrate sites and appropriate memorials, and prayers for the dead and
their families. For further guidance, refer to JG 1-05.
CATASTROPHIC TEMPORARY INTERMENT 
D-6. Prior to interment, or upon removal of HR at disinterment, chaplains or religious leaders generally
offer prayers and other rituals and services specific to their faith to consecrate those sites as sacred.
MASS REINTERMENT 
D-7. When possible, religious leaders representing all faith groups of those interred should be invited to
offer prayers in conjunction with interment of HR at their final resting place.
Appendix D 
D-2
ATP 4-46/MCRP 3-40G.3/NTTP 4-06/AFTTP 3-2.51 
03 August 2022 
MASS BURIAL 
D-8. Decisions for mass burial dispositions should consider practical alternatives to burying people of many
faith groups together.
D-9.  A chaplain, if present, may offer a prayer or other appropriate religious service. If a chaplain is not
available, a willing person may read a written prayer provided by a chaplain or the senior military person
may provide appropriate respects. This situation is also applicable with individual graves, temporary
interments, and DSCA events.
