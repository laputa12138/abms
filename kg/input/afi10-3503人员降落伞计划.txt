Chapter 1 
USAF PERSONNEL PARACHUTE PROGRAM 
1.1.  Purpose.  This 
instruction 
establishes 
procedures 
governing 
the 
authority 
and 
administration of the USAF Personnel Parachute Program (PPP), parachute qualifications and 
requirements and procedures applicable to premeditated personnel parachuting. 
1.2.  Objectives.  The requirement for the USAF PPP originates with DoD Directive (DoDD) 
5100.01, Functions of the Department of Defense and Its Major Components. The directive tasks 
the Department of the Air Force with “preparation of forces necessary for the effective 
prosecution of war” and identifies Air Force functions. A primary function of the Air Force is to 
“develop concepts, doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures and organize, train, equip, and 
provide forces” for specific functions listed in DoDD 5100.01. The Army coordinates and 
develops airborne doctrine, procedures and equipment on behalf of itself and the Marine Corps. 
While this instruction draws extensively upon the combat, operational, and training base of the 
joint services, the nature of USAF parachuting also requires tactics, techniques, procedures and 
equipment not addressed in sister service publications. Objectives for the USAF PPP are divided 
into operational, functional and management categories. 
1.2.1.  The operational objective of the USAF PPP is the tactical employment of forces 
across the range of military operations. 
1.2.2.  The functional objectives of the USAF PPP are: 
1.2.2.1.  Test, evaluate and certify systems and equipment that contribute to improved 
survivability during either premeditated or emergency parachute egress. 
1.2.2.2.  Instruct and demonstrate proper premeditated and emergency egress procedures 
to improve survivability, develop confidence and establish an airmanship foundation. 
1.2.2.3.  Conduct support to public and/or military events to showcase military 
preparedness, demonstrate capabilities, promote good community and international 
relations, support USAF recruiting and retention efforts and render military honors in 
accordance with AFI 11-209, Participation in Aerial Events. 
1.2.3.  Management objectives of the USAF PPP include: 
1.2.3.1.  Provides standards for training, qualification and currency of USAF parachutists. 
1.2.3.2.  Approves parachuting equipment and maintain a central equipment listing. 
1.2.3.3.  Increases mission effectiveness and safety. 
1.2.3.4.  Ensures compliance with DoD and USAF activity, mishap, incident and 
malfunction reporting requirements. 
1.3.  General.  Compliance with this instruction requires risk evaluation and mitigation by 
subordinate organizations. Use AFI 90-802, Risk Management, as guidance for the risk 
management processes. 
 
 
8 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
1.3.1.  The USAF PPP does not govern cargo equipment parachute operations, cargo 
equipment parachute rigging, or non-premeditated parachute equipment. This includes 
emergency bail out parachutes and ejection seats. Emergency parachutes are covered by the 
appropriate technical order or manual. Joint airdrop equipment procedures are prescribed by 
AFI 13-210_IP, Joint Airdrop Inspection Records, Malfunction/Incident Investigations, and 
Activity Reporting, which “provides policies and assigns responsibilities for initial 
notification, investigation, reporting, and airdrop load malfunctions incidents.” In addition, 
AFI 13-210_IP standardizes joint airdrop inspection requirements as well as outlines the 
duties and responsibilities of the malfunction officer (MO). For information on drop zones, 
refer to AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. 
1.3.2.  Organizations will conduct all parachuting operations in accordance with published 
guidance, utilizing equipment approved through the process described in Chapter 4. (T-1). 
1.4.  Deviations.  Do not deviate from policies in this AFI except when the situation demands 
immediate action to protect against death or serious bodily injury and/or an urgent requirement 
exists. In this case, the parachutists’ officer in charge (or ranking jumpmaster in their absence) 
will evaluate all options and take the appropriate action to ensure the safety of the parachutists. 
(T-2). 
1.4.1.  Units will report all deviations without an approved waiver to the appropriate waiver 
authority (with AF/A3S as informational addressees) within 24 hours or when 
tactically/operationally feasible. (T-1). 
1.4.2.  When it is necessary to protect those under their control from a situation not covered 
by this instruction and immediate action is required, the parachutists’ officer in charge (or 
ranking jumpmaster in their absence) has ultimate authority and responsibility for the course 
of action to be taken. 
1.5.  References.  During unilateral operations, use this instruction in conjunction with AFMAN 
11-420/TC 3-21.220, Static Line Parachuting Techniques and Training; Army Techniques 
Publication (ATP) 3-18.11, Special Forces Military Free-Fall Operations; Training Circular 
(TC) 18-11, Special Forces Double-Bag Static Line Operations; Air Force Tactics, Techniques, 
and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1.Guardian Angel (GA), Tactical Employment, and AFTTP 3-
3.Guardian Angel, Combat Fundamentals. These publications constitute the primary guidance 
and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for static-line (S/L) and military free-fall (MFF) 
parachuting. For unique USAF parachuting exceptions to the above references, see Chapter 10. 
NOTE: During parachute operations conducted under a joint commander, personnel must use 
guidance dictated by the joint organization (e.g., United States Special Operations Command 
(USSOCOM) Manual 350-3, Training Airborne Operations (Parachuting)). (T-0).

AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
Chapter 3 
ADMINISTRATION 
3.1.  Authority.  This instruction provides USAF guidance for compliance with the legislative 
and departmental directives that govern parachute operations. It directs USAF PPP 
administration, characterizes in-flight duties performed by parachutists and complies with the 
references listed in paragraph 1.5 to assure the legality, safety and effectiveness of mission 
segments that involves premeditated personnel parachuting. 
3.2.  Validating Permanent Parachute Positions.  A parachute position is a designated unit 
manning document (UMD) or joint manning document (JMD) position that has been approved 
by AF/A3S that requires the member to perform deliberate, regular and recurring parachute duty 
as a part of the organization’s mission. These billets are identified by a “J” prefix on the Duty 
Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) and typically referred to as “J-prefix” positions. Since 
positions are validated based on recurring requirements, the intent of a J-prefix position is that 
the member will maintain standards, qualification and currency. Failure to pursue or maintain 
active parachute status precludes service in the position without a MAJCOM PPPM waiver. 
3.2.1.  Requests for initial or updates to parachute positions consist of the following: 
3.2.1.1.  An AF Form 4322, Active Parachutist Justification, completed by the requesting 
organization. The justification must be consistent with the PPP objectives in paragraph 
1.2 and will specifically address the following: 
3.2.1.1.1.  Whether the position is for S/L or MFF (MFF inherently includes S/L). (T-
1). 
3.2.1.1.2.  The position’s operational requirement and impact on the organization’s 
ability to prosecute its mission. (T-1). 
3.2.1.1.3.  The program that will support the qualification, training, currency, 
Stan/Eval and rigger/materiel requirements incurred by the jump position. (T-1) If the 
organization requesting the J-Prefix or jump inherent position does not have an 
organically supported parachute program that meets all requirements of AFI 11-
301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, associated volumes (or sister 
service equivalent) and AFI 13-210_IP, then the request must contain fully endorsed 
letters of attachment or memorandums of agreements/support agreements with an 
organization that does. (T-1). 
3.2.1.2.  The responsible MAJCOM PPPM will coordinate a request letter for parachute 
position validation from the MAJCOM/A3 to AF/A3S. (T-1). Requests concerning 
USAF positions at joint organizations should substitute the joint command’s operations 
officer for the MAJCOM/A3, even if this is not a USAF officer. Where appropriate, 
release authority for requests concerning billets at O-5 grades and below shall be 
delegated to the first O-6 in the MAJCOM PPPM’s chain of command or the Air Force 
Element Commander at the joint organization, respectively. (T-1). 
 
 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
17 
3.2.1.2.1.  The MAJCOM, in exercising its requirement vetting function, will 
consider factors such as equipment, training, medical support, flying hours, funding 
and opportunity cost of coding a position (e.g., what the position won’t be able to 
accomplish in light of the new parachute qualification, training and currency 
requirements). (T-1). 
3.2.1.2.2.  Internal coordination and request format are at the requesting 
organization’s discretion, but will include at a minimum, coordination by the affected 
AFS Functional Manager, the Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) functional manager 
and the PPPM. (T-2). 
3.2.2.  Forward parachute position request packages to the USAF PPPM electronically at 
AF.A3S.Workflow@us.af.mil or to AF/A3S, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 
20330-1480. The USAF PPPM will accomplish coordination at HAF on behalf of the 
MAJCOM. (T-1). 
3.2.2.1.  For requests concerning billets at grade O-6 or below, the USAF PPPM will 
coordinate requests with the affected CFM, A3TM and the Directorate of Manpower, 
Organization and Resources (AF/A1M). (T-1). CFMs generally consider factors 
pertaining to how the permanent billet will fit into the career field plan as a whole, the 
pool of available volunteers for parachute duty, modifications to training quotas and 
operational integration. AF/A3TM will review for fiscal/operational supportability, then 
AF/A3S accomplishes requirement vetting and serves as the approval authority for 
position validation. (T-1). 
3.2.2.2.  The Chief of Staff designates general officer parachute positions in the same 
fashion that applies to other flying positions. The USAF PPPM will coordinate requests 
or revisions to general officer parachute positions with the General Officer Management 
Office (AF/DPG), AF/A3, AF/A1, Secretary and Chief of Staff Executive Action Group 
(AF/CX), Assistant Vice Chief of the Air Force (AF/CVA) and the Vice Chief of Staff of 
the Air Force (AF/CV). (T-1). AF/CC is the approval authority for these requests. 
3.2.3.  Upon request approval, AF/A3S will provide AETC/A3S with an update of positions 
and AFSCs with validated requirements for inclusion and prioritization for Initial and 
Advanced Skills Training. (T-1). 
3.2.4.  MAJCOMs and comparable organizations will maintain approved parachute position 
validation packages on file for accountability. (T-1). AF/A3S will perform periodic reviews 
of all parachute positions (typically every two years). (T-1). 
3.2.5.  Only HAF notification (not coordination) is required to reassign a J-prefix to another 
position, provided it remains in the original organization and AFS. Any other action must 
include a full justification package submission. (T-1). 
3.2.6.  The UMD or JMD reflects the number of members authorized parachute duty in a 
given organization by referencing either a J-prefix position or a jump-inherent specialty. 
Guidance on double billeting for valid student authorization and AF/PPPM approval is 
provided in AFMAN 11-402. (T-1). Requesting organizations will forward double billeting 
requests to the USAF PPPM according to paragraph 3.4 (T-1). 
18 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
3.3.  Validating Permanent Parachute Positions Using Jump-Inherent Primary Air Force 
Specialty Codes (AFSCs). 
3.3.1.  Certain AFSCs require the performance of deliberate, regular and recurring parachute 
duty to accomplish assigned missions. These AFSCs are central to the ability of the USAF 
PPP to carry out its assigned functions, providing a pool of qualified and current mission 
parachutists independent of the manpower positions in which they serve. In these cases, 
parachute duty is considered inherent to the Air Force Specialty and the member will 
maintain standards, qualification and currency. (T-2). Legitimate possession of a jump-
inherent Primary AFSC constitutes a valid parachute position and exempts its holder from 
the process described in paragraph 3.2 
3.3.1.1.  MFF inherent Air Force Specialties are: 19ZXA/C (Legacy 13C/D), 1Z1XX, 
1Z2XX, and 1Z4XX. 
3.3.1.2.  Currently there are no S/L inherent Air Force Specialties. 
3.3.1.3.  Non-inherent Air Force Specialties authorized S/L qualification independent of 
the positions in which they currently serve (only members assigned to an authorized 
parachute position per paragraph 3.2 or paragraph 3.4 may maintain active parachutist 
status, including currency after initial qualification): 
3.3.1.3.1.  19ZXB (Legacy 13L) and 1Z3XX member require initial S/L qualification 
(Basic Airborne) to provide a force wide capability to support Airborne units with 
only unit level training requirement to regain qualification/currency. 
3.3.1.3.2.  1T0XX members require initial S/L qualification and completion of the 
1T0XX Emergency Parachute Instructor POI in order to provide SMEs capable of 
executing the PPP’s functional objectives in accordance with paragraph 1.2.2 
3.3.2.  Permanent disqualification from parachute duty precludes service in a jump-inherent 
DAFSC. Exceptions to policy are authorized by AF/A3S. 
3.3.3.  The exemption from position validation for jump-inherent Air Force Specialties does 
not extend beyond the Primary AFSC (e.g., secondary AFSC, tertiary AFSC, etc.). 
3.4.  Temporary Parachute Positions.  Temporary parachute positions allow commanders to 
place qualified members on active parachute status in the absence of validated parachute 
positions. They are used to permit MAJCOMs to respond to short-duration mission requirements. 
Approved temporary positions convey active status and parachute pay entitlement. The 
MAJCOM/A3 may approve temporary positions amounting to 365 days or less (12 or less 
months parachute pay) in a 24-month period. Requests concerning USAF positions at joint 
organizations should substitute the MAJCOM/A3 for the joint command’s operations officer, 
even if this is not a USAF officer. The following requirements apply to temporary parachute 
positions: 
3.4.1.  Members in temporary parachute positions must: 
3.4.1.1.  Be qualified and maintain currency in accordance with this instruction. (T-1). 
3.4.1.2.  Complete at least 30 months on active parachute status. (T-2). 
3.4.2.  Before permitting members to participate in temporary parachuting, MAJCOM/A3s, 
or joint equivalents, will evaluate the following: 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
19 
3.4.2.1.  Interest of the service compared to that of the member. (T-1). 
3.4.2.2.  Impact on operational resources. (T-1). 
3.4.2.3.  Cost and impact on logistics. (T-1). 
3.4.2.4.  Likelihood that the member will return to a permanent parachute position. (T-1). 
3.4.2.5.  Costs of retraining. (T-1). 
3.4.2.6.  Availability of a communication process for parachuting and safety information. 
(T-1). 
3.4.3.  Temporary parachute positions are subject to considerable scrutiny. Requests for 
temporary parachute positions within the approval authority of the MAJCOM/A3, or joint 
equivalent, follow the procedure in paragraph 3.2.1 except they must also include a copy of 
applicable qualification course certificates and a copy of the member’s current ARMS 
Individual Data Summary and Jump History Report. (T-1). A sample request letter can be 
found in Attachment 3. MAJCOMs must coordinate parachute pay funding approval 
through AF/A3TM and forward a copy of the approved documentation to the USAF PPPM 
electronically at AF.A3S.Workflow@us.af.mil or to AF/A3S, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, 
Washington, DC 20330-1480. (T-1). MAJCOMs will maintain a copy of the approved 
package on file. (T-1). Requests that affect general officers must be coordinated through 
AF/DPG. (T-1). For requests outside the approval authority of the MAJCOM/A3 or joint 
equivalent (i.e., those for more than 365 days in a 24-month period), staff the above package 
to AF/A3S using the procedure in paragraph 3.2 
3.5.  Placing Members on Active Parachute Status.  Authorities listed in paragraph 3.5.1 will 
only initiate aeronautical orders (AOs) in accordance with AFMAN 11-402 to place an 
individual on active parachute status when required to fill a valid parachute position, when in 
initial training leading to such a position, for student authorizations at USAF Academy parachute 
programs, or when filling an approved temporary parachute position. (T-1). Members will not be 
assigned to active parachute status unless a member meets the standards and qualification criteria 
in Chapter 6 or is in initial training leading to that qualification. (T-1). Parachutist qualifications 
and status are awarded based on mission requirements and will not be used as part of an 
incentive or recognition program. (T-1). Active parachute status is commonly referred to as 
“jump” status. 
3.5.1.  The following authorities may enter or withdraw members from active parachute 
status: 
3.5.1.1.  AF/A3S. 
3.5.1.2.  MAJCOM commanders, the MAJCOM/A3 or joint equivalents. 
3.5.1.3.  Commanders of organizations with validated parachute positions on the UMD or 
JMD, in coordination with the Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office 
responsible for maintaining their unit’s jump records. 
 
 
20 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
3.5.2.  Aviation Service Codes (ASCs) are used to indicate flying status and incentive pay 
entitlement. ASCs pertaining to parachuting will only be authorized for members qualified 
per Chapter 6 who are required to fill validated parachute positions as defined in paragraph 
3.2 and paragraph 3.3, when in initial training leading to such positions as explained in AFI 
11-401, or when filling approved temporary parachute positions according to paragraph 3.4 
(T-1). Per 37 U.S. Code § 301, parachute duty pay is a component of HDIP. It is calculated at 
one of two rates based on the category of active service: S/L or MFF. 
3.6.  Documentation. 
3.6.1.  USAF personnel must be on valid AOs authorizing active parachute status in 
accordance with AFI 11-401, AFMAN 11-402, AFMAN 11-421, and this instruction before 
engaging in military parachute operations, to include initial parachutist training. (T-1). 
3.6.2.  Parachutists are subject to the provisions of AFI 11-403 and AFI 48-123. Document 
medical examinations on DD Form 2992, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special 
Operational Duty. Members may also be subject to more restrictive performance standards 
required by joint, MAJCOM and unit guidance. 
3.6.3.  The ARMS is the system of record for documenting and maintaining parachute 
qualifications, ratings, activity and currency data. Members are also encouraged to maintain 
personal parachute records. Training and currency documentation is subject to Career Field 
Education and Training Plans, MAJCOM guidance and joint publications. Notify the HARM 
office of the member’s parachute duty requirements (MFF, S/L, or both) so accurate AOs can 
be published and the HDIP entitlement rate can be determined. Properly completed AOs, on-
the-job training (OJT) records and currency requirements constitute the commander’s 
designation for parachute duty. Refer to AFMAN 11-421 for information on Jump Record 
Folder (JRF) management. The HARM office is the focal point for questions concerning 
entitlements and JRF contents. ARMS is capable of generating the Individual Data Summary, 
Jump History Report and Individual Jump Record. The HARM office will validate HDIP 
entitlement and manage AOs, MPOs and JRFs in accordance with AFI 11-401, AFMAN 11-
402, AFMAN 11-421, and this instruction. (T-1). In the case of an AFI conflict, this 
instruction takes precedence for all parachute-related issues. 
3.7.  Preparing Aeronautical Orders.  Guidance on units that enter parachutists into active 
parachute status and HARM office submission requests is provided in AFI 11-401, AFMAN 11-
402 and this instruction. (T-1). 
3.7.1.  Commanders must certify eligibility for parachute duty. (T-1). Certification will 
include requirement for active parachute status as described in paragraph 3.5, review of past 
parachute duty or training to preclude performance issues, and ensure member has not been 
previously disqualified. (T-1). 
3.7.2.  Requests will include, at minimum, the member’s name, grade, unit of assignment, 
DAFSC, UMD or JMD position number, date assigned to the unit, formal qualification 
certificate or letter of completion, expiration date of the current Special Warfare (or Flying 
Class III) physical that clears the member for parachute duty and type of parachute duty 
required (MFF, S/L or both). (T-1). 
3.7.2.1.  For previously qualified parachutists, the dates assigned to the authorized 
parachute position will be included. (T-1). 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
21 
3.7.2.2.  For members attending initial parachute training, the class start date and location 
will be included. (T-1). 
3.7.2.3.  For temporary parachute positions, the effective duration and a copy of the 
approval paperwork will be included. (T-1). 
3.7.3.  Guidance governing effective dates, durations and procedures for AOs that authorize 
active parachute status is contained in AFI 11-401 and AFMAN 11-421. 
3.7.4.  Commanders will submit requests to publish parachute rating AOs to the HARM 
office in accordance with this instruction and AFMAN 11-402. (T-1). 
3.8.  Removing Members from Active Parachute Status.  Officers vested with the ability to 
place members on active parachute status per paragraph 3.5 will remove members from active 
status when no longer serving in a position approved through paragraphs 3.2.4, when the 
requirement for that position no longer exists, upon completion of USAF Academy parachute 
programs, or when suspended or disqualified for reasons listed in AFMAN 11-402 and this 
instruction. (T-1). 
3.8.1.  Notify the HARM office when a member changes parachute duty type (MFF, S/L, or 
both) or is removed from active parachute status entirely. Since termination of active 
parachute status results in non-eligibility for parachute duty pay, provide the member as 
much notice as possible. Parachutists suspended or disqualified for cause do not require 
advance notification. 
3.8.2.  Commanders may remove any parachutist from status for cause, for lack of 
qualification, or for failure to meet standards per Chapter 8. Use the same reasons and 
procedures identified for aircrew members in AFMAN 11-402 to suspend and disqualify 
parachutists. 
3.8.3.  Supersede AOs in accordance with AFI 11-401, AFMAN 11-402 and AFMAN 11-
421. 
3.8.4.  Parachutists may be moved to inactive status for reasons articulated in AFI 11-401, 
AFMAN 11-402, AFMAN 11-421 (e.g., ASC 9J when filling non-parachute positions or 
ASC 9L for non-parachute courses of instruction lasting 180 days or longer). 
3.9.  Permanent Disqualification Actions.  Members are permanently disqualified when they 
fail to satisfactorily perform parachute duty, when they voluntarily terminate parachute duty, or 
at the commander’s recommendation. Disqualification ASCs are governed by AFMAN 11-402. 
While final action is pending, a commander may suspend a parachutist for no more than 180 
days after which MAJCOM/A3 approval is required; assign ASC 04 in these cases. Include a 
copy of the suspension AO with the commander’s request for permanent disqualification. If not 
suspended, the member may continue to perform parachute duties. 
3.10.  Non-permanent Disqualification Actions.  Disqualify parachutists in the same manner as 
non-rated aircrew members and in accordance with AFMAN 11-402. Typical non-permanent 
actions include failure to maintain medical fitness and humanitarian disqualifications. 
 
 
22 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
3.11.  Parachute Duty Requalification.  Parachutists who are disqualified for non-permanent 
reasons listed in AFMAN 11-402 may be requalified upon removal of the impediment to 
parachuting. Approval is based on the needs of the Air Force. Guidance on members who are no 
longer assigned to a parachute position is provided in AFI 36-2110, Total Force Assignments. 
(T-1). Process requalification requests in accordance with AFMAN 11-402. 
3.12.  Parachutist Code Identifiers.  Assign a J-prefix to a member’s AFSC upon completion of 
qualification requirements in Chapter 6. The prefix is kept on the primary, secondary or 
additional AFSC as long as the member remains qualified, even though the requirement for 
parachute jump duties may end. When the parachutist also holds a “C” prefix (commander), a 
prefix of “B” (operations officer), “D” (Vector Position), “W” (Weapons Officer/Weapons 
School Graduate), “X, K or Q” (aircrew), or other qualification/position prefix, place a statement 
on the AO indicating that the member occupies a J-prefix position. Jump inherent Air Force 
Specialties do not require a J-prefix. 
3.13.  Funding for Parachute Duty Pay.  The Air Force programs and budgets based on 
validated parachute positions. AF/A3 is responsible for the flight/parachute pay budget and 
manages this program in accordance with AFMAN 11-402. AF/A3S will periodically revalidate 
parachute positions. (T-1).

Chapter 4 
ACQUISITION AND SUSTAINMENT 
4.1.  Equipment Acquisition.  This chapter constitutes the primary equipment acquisition and 
sustainment guidance for parachutists operating under the USAF PPP. During joint parachute 
operations conducted under a joint commander, comply with applicable guidance. 
4.1.1.  Requirement Generation. Guidance on MAJCOMs establishing operational 
requirements for parachute systems and equipment in accordance with Directorate of 
Operational Capability Requirements (AF/A5R), Requirements Development Guidebook, and 
applicable acquisition and test guidance is provided in AFI 63-101/20-101, and AFI 99-103, 
Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation. (T-1). 
4.1.2.  Requirement Configuration and Validation. When MAJCOMs generate new category 
I/II requirements (as defined in paragraph 4.4), the MAJCOM PPPM must first validate the 
requirement through the USAF PPPM to preclude expending personnel and financial 
resources on pre-decisional items. (T-1). During this initial analysis, the USAF PPPM 
determines whether a MAJCOM’s requirement will be presented to the PPP Executive 
Committee or proceed directly to equipment testing and evaluation. When a requirement is 
coordinated through the committee, the purpose is to; determine if the same need exists in 
other organizations, ascertain the appropriate amount of standardization, or promote safety 
and affordability. When executing its functions, the committee should incorporate 
parachuting subject matter experts (e.g., Aircrew Flight Equipment specialists, logistics 
managers, and supply technicians). Items must meet formal criteria in the following 
documents/institutes/processes to be considered validated; Department of Transportation 
Technical Standard Order 23, TSO-C23 Personnel Parachute Assemblies, the American 
National Standards Institute, a DoD operational testing and evaluation process, or other 
approved DoD service process. (T-0). Commercial-off-the-shelf solutions for category I/II 
requirements will be considered but not until a minimum introductory period (typically 12 
months) has elapsed. (T-1). The end result is a validated requirement that enters the testing, 
evaluation, and certification process. 
4.1.3.  Acquisition Management. Unless equipment will be obtained through local purchase, 
as validated by the USAF PPPM, the committee will request that SAF/AQ identify program 
management responsibility. (T-1). The program manager will develop an acquisition strategy 
and coordinate funding responsibilities pertaining to multiple MAJCOMs, if applicable. (T-
1). 
4.2.  Equipment Test and Evaluation.  AFMC is the USAF OPR for personnel parachute 
systems, equipment and jump platform developmental test and evaluation. Designated MAJCOM 
operational test organizations are responsible for operational test and evaluation of personnel 
parachute systems and equipment. These designated organizations will be coordinated through 
the respective MAJCOM PPPM and USAF PPPM. (T-1). The PPP Executive Committee will 
include superintendents of chartered test organizations with PPP test responsibilities. (T-1). 
4.3.  Equipment Certification.  The Test Parachutist Program (TPP) is the USAF OPR for the 
certification of personnel parachute systems, equipment and jump platforms. Requests for TPP 
action will be submitted through the MAJCOM PPPM. (T-1). 
24 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
4.3.1.  Guidance on items belonging to categories I and II, as detailed in paragraph 4.4, 
undergoing a design safety assessment, test, and evaluation, is provided in AFI 99-103. (T-
1). Replacement items will be reviewed by the TPP to assure they replicate the original item 
as it pertains to function and safety. (T-1). After reviewing an item, the TPP will publish all 
test results, design studies, documentation and a usage recommendation on the AF Personnel 
Parachute Program collaborative website: https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/AF-PPP (T-1). 
AF/A3S will make a usage approval decision and authorize modification of the USAF PPP 
AUL. (T-1). Developmental test and evaluation and operational test and evaluation should be 
combined whenever applicable. 
4.3.2.  Items belonging to category III, as described in paragraph 4.4, are part of a 
parachutist’s individual equipment for which operational needs will be the primary selection 
criteria. (T-1). When an item will be employed in an exposed configuration (i.e., could 
possibly interfere with the operation of the parachute system) or could pose a safety hazard to 
parachutists, it must be approved by the MAJCOM on its category III attachment to the 
USAF PPP AUL. (T-1). In order to enhance safety, MAJCOMs will prescribe item jump 
configuration or mounting guidelines as required. (T-1). Approval must be based upon 
sound, experienced judgment that the equipment both enhances mission performance and 
does not pose a safety hazard to the parachutist. (T-2). There is no requirement to list 
unexposed items that do not pose a safety hazard on the USAF PPP AUL. 
4.4.  Equipment Approval.  Parachute systems and equipment are authorized via the USAF PPP 
AUL, which is approved by AF/A3S. The USAF PPP AUL will include at a minimum: item 
description, National Sock Number/part number, model number/manufacturer and authorized 
users. (T-1). Approval of items in category III is delegated to MAJCOMs, thus the USAF PPP 
AUL does not include category III items. Instead, MAJCOMs are responsible for maintaining 
command category III lists and may coordinate to post to the AF Personnel Parachute Program 
collaborative website: https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/AF-PPP. MAJCOMs approve category III 
items per paragraph 4.3.2 
4.4.1.  Category I— AFE maintained parachutist equipment that is worn by, or otherwise 
attached to the parachutist. Category I includes parachute canopies, parachute components, 
harnesses, containers, oxygen breathing equipment, helmets, automatic activation 
devices/electronic automatic activation devices and altimeters. 
4.4.2.  Category II—Equipment that is potentially hazardous to the parachutist. Category II 
includes items such as life vests/preservers, equipment, equipment components, equipment 
bags, strobe lights and public relations devices used during parachuting demonstrations. 
4.4.3.  Category III—Equipment (individual equipment) typically worn exposed or used in 
premeditated parachuting which: 1) is available in a broad selection of acceptable options, 2) 
does not create a life-threatening hazard to a reasonably prudent parachutist and 3) is carried 
by USAF parachutists in support of a mission requirement. Category III includes items such 
as plate carriers, navigation devices, weapons and eye/hearing protection. Items requiring 
specific jump configuration or mounting guidelines will be published in accordance with 
paragraph 4.3.2 (T-1). 
4.4.4.  Exception  : With MAJCOM PPPM concurrence, units may use Category I-III 
equipment listed on a sister service or USSOCOM AUL equivalent. 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
25 
4.5.  Equipment Sustainment.  AFLCMC/WNU is responsible for serving as the single focal 
point for category I/II equipment sustainment and modernization efforts for both commercial-
off-the-shelf and government off-the-shelf items. This function will serve as the primary 
interface with parachute systems and equipment manufacturers and is responsible for the 
following functions: 
4.5.1.  Monitor the readiness and reliability of the existing parachute fleet through such 
mechanisms as periodic reevaluations and activity, incident and malfunction reporting. (T-1). 
4.5.2.  Disseminate manufacturers’ safety notices and information bulletins in a timely 
fashion 
via 
the 
AF 
Personnel 
Parachute 
Program 
collaborative 
website: 
https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/AF-PPP 
(T-1). 
AF/A3S 
should 
promulgate 
pertinent 
information to the USAF parachute community. 
4.5.3.  Maintain close interaction with comparable sister service functions to benefit from 
like efforts and disseminate pertinent findings. (T-1). 
4.5.4.  Maintain close ties with the acquisition manager, if this is a separate function.

Chapter 5 
ACTIVITY, MISHAP, INCIDENT AND MALFUNCTION REPORTING 
5.1.  DoD Reporting Requirements.  Ensuring compliance with DoD activity, incident and 
malfunction reporting is a management objective of the USAF PPP. AFI 13-210_IP prescribes 
guidance and identifies procedures and forms used in preparing joint airdrop inspection records, 
airdrop malfunction investigations and airdrop activity reports. All USAF organizations 
conducting premeditated parachute operations must have AFI 13-210_IP on hand and all 
malfunction officers and jumpmasters must be familiar with its contents. (T-1). Where AFI 13-
210_IP and this instruction conflict, this instruction takes precedence. MAJCOMs may 
supplement reporting requirements, provided they fully adhere to the provisions of this chapter. 
The Aerial Delivery and Field Service Department (ADFSD) at Ft. Lee, VA maintains the 
SharePoint®™ website (Common Access Card restricted) which contains training, malfunction 
information 
and 
electronic 
forms 
for 
DoD 
reporting 
at 
https://army.deps.mil/Army/CMDS/CASCOM_QM/ADFSD/ADMMO/default.aspx. Note: 
To login to the website, member should use the appropriate certificate. 
5.2.  Activity Reporting.  Activity reporting is a unit responsibility. In accordance with AFI 13-
210_IP 5-6 a. (3), units will submit the previous month’s data to include, unit, aircraft, parachute 
system and number of jumps no later than the tenth business day of the next month using the 
electronic DD Form 1748-3. (T-0). See paragraph 5.1 and Attachment 6. 
5.3.  Mishap Reporting.  Mishap reporting is a unit level responsibility. A mishap is defined as 
an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that result in damage or injury. 
5.3.1.  Mishaps involving civil aircraft or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) functions 
(such as Air Traffic Control) shall require additional actions per Air Force Pamphlet 91-206, 
Participation in Military or Civil Aircraft or Space Safety Investigations. 
5.3.2.  Major mishaps, especially those involving destroyed aircraft or fatalities, may also 
require legal investigation and reporting per AFI 51-307, Aerospace and Ground Accident 
Investigations. 
5.3.3.  Any activity meeting the following criteria qualifies as a mishap and must therefore be 
reported and investigated in accordance with AFI 91-204. (T-1). Wing Safety offices, 
AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports and AFMAN 91-224, Ground 
Safety Investigation and Hazard Reporting have additional support and information support. 
The “Airman Safety App” available for Android®™ and iPhone®™ provides a systematic 
information collection tool that also provides the information to the safety office in an Air 
Force Safety Automated System importable format. 
5.3.3.1.  Class A: Fatality, permanent total disability, destruction of a DoD aircraft or 
mishap cost of $2,500,000 or more. 
5.3.3.2.  Class B: Permanent partial disability, inpatient hospitalization of three or more 
personnel or mishap cost totaling $600,000 or more but less than $2,500,000. 
5.3.3.3.  Class C: An injury or illness causing loss of one or more days away from work 
not including the day or shift it occurred, an injury or illness resulting in permanent 
change of job, or mishap cost totaling $60,000 or more but less than $600,000. 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
27 
5.3.3.4.  Class D: Reportable injury or physiological incident not classified as a Class A-
C or mishap cost totaling $25,000 or more but less than $60,000. 
5.3.3.5.  Class E: A work-related mishap that falls below Class D criteria. Most Class E 
mishap reporting is voluntary; however, see discipline-specific safety manuals for a list 
of events requiring mandatory reporting. Note: See AFI 91-204, Attachment 1 for more 
detailed mishap classification information. 
5.4.  Malfunction and Incident Reporting. 
5.4.1.  In addition to the above listed reporting requirement, units must submit 
Malfunctions/Incidents reports within 24 hours of occurrence, or as soon as possible after it 
is tactically or operationally feasible via functional channels to the ADFSD. (T-0). Initially, 
timeliness is more important than detail, so do not delay initial reporting to collect all 
requested information. See Attachment 5 for reporting procedures. Note: In accordance with 
AFI 13-210_IP, injuries caused by parachute landing falls will not be reported to ADFSD; 
however, paragraph 5.3 reporting requirements still apply. (T-1). See AFI 91-204 and the 
unit’s servicing Wing Safety office for information and procedures. 
5.4.2.  A malfunction is defined by AFI 13-210_IP as, “the failure of an airdrop item or 
component of an airdrop system to function as it was intended or designed”. Some examples 
of malfunctions include, but are not limited to: failure of a main canopy to properly deploy, 
static line breaking, parachute panel or gore blowout. 
5.4.3.  An incident is defined by AFI 13-210_IP as, "any procedure that prevented the 
successful completion of any planned airdrop operation.” Some examples of incidents 
include, but are not limited to: improperly setting the automatic activation device (AAD) that 
resulted in a dual canopy deployment; inadvertent/premature activations; entanglements 
resulting in reserve parachute deployment; high flare of the canopy resulting in jumper 
injury; parachutist loss of consciousness during jump sequence; and misrouted static line that 
resulted in a towed jumper (cutaway or retrieved). 
5.5.  Malfunction Officer.  AFI 13-210_IP prescribes qualifications and duties for malfunction 
officers. Training will be conducted by qualified MO using the annual malfunction training 
package. (T-1). The MO training will be documented in the individuals training records. (T-1). 
The MO training can be found on the ADFSD SharePoint®™ site listed in paragraph 5.1 To 
access the MO training, navigate to the gray MRB Info tab in the middle of the screen. Once 
there, select the “Annual MO training package” button to the left of the table, underneath Job 
Aids. 
5.5.1.  In addition to the grade/Air Force Specialty requirements of AFI 13-210_IP (i.e., 
qualified Air Force Joint Airdrop Inspector), AFSOC, Special Tactics, Guardian Angel or 
Special Reconnaissance operations, or drop zone controller (DZC) qualified, the malfunction 
officer must be identified prior to commencing operations and will be qualified as either a 
parachutist or AFE technician on the system(s) being employed. (T-2). 
5.5.2.  During AFSOC, Special Tactics, Guardian Angel or Special Reconnaissance 
parachute activities, the MO and DZC duties may be performed by the same person. 
However, malfunction actions take precedence and the DZC/MO will suspend drop zone 
operations until all MO responsibilities (malfunction investigation and documentation) are 
complete and they can return to DZC duties. (T-1). 
28 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
5.6.  Malfunction and Incident Investigations.  Investigations are second in priority only to 
medical care for injured personnel. The primary purpose of an investigation is rapid 
identification of safety-related factors that have bearing on the conduct of DoD parachute 
operations and, when appropriate, to consider changes to administration, qualifications, 
standards, requirements, currency, training and procedures. Guidance on malfunctions and 
incidents being investigated is provided in the procedures and checklists in AFI 13-210_IP and, 
if applicable, AFI 91-204. (T-0). Report events according to paragraph 5.3 and 5.4 Table A5.1 
provides a printable form for use in initial data collection.

Chapter 7 
FUNCTIONAL CERTIFICATIONS 
7.1.  General.  Functional certifications are those mission requirements that necessitate 
oversight, standardized progression and certification, but do not lead to the award of parachutist 
ratings. MAJCOMs may authorize functional certification programs when the mission requires 
specialized skill sets beyond the scope of standard parachute operations. The determination as to 
whether certifications eventually convey to another MAJCOM is made by the gaining 
MAJCOM. Personnel entered into functional certification must be highly skilled parachutists, 
able to maintain superior air awareness, provide instruction and advanced mission capabilities. 
(T-2). Unit commanders will designate by letter parachutists who are authorized functional 
certifications. (T-1). Approval for courses or programs of instruction, including changes, is 
delegated to the MAJCOM/A3. The MAJCOM PPPM will send courses or programs of 
instruction to AF.A3S.Workflow@us.af.mil for coordination prior to finalizing and one copy 
after publication. (T-1). AF/A3S reviews MAJCOM courses and programs of instruction 
biennially and designates mandatory requirements for certain functional certifications as detailed 
below. 
7.2.  Instructor Upgrade/Instructor Candidate Program.  The instructor candidate program 
establishes standardized training progression for selected parachutists identified to perform 
instructor duties. Only members on active parachute status qualified in accordance with Chapter 
6 and certified through a MAJCOM-approved instructor course or program of instruction are 
authorized to conduct instructor parachutist operations. Certification and training are 
documented in accordance with the OJT program. Prerequisites and currency are established 
through MAJCOM directives. 
7.3.  Air-to-Air Videography/Camera Certification.  Only members on active parachute status 
qualified in accordance with Chapter 6 and certified through a MAJCOM-approved free-fall 
camera course or program of instruction according to paragraph 7.1 will be authorized to 
conduct air-to-air camera operations. (T-1). 
7.3.1.  Certification and training are documented in accordance with the OJT program. 
Prerequisites and currency are established through MAJCOM directives. 
7.3.2.  Exception  : When designated in writing by the unit commander, members may jump 
with small form factor digital point of view cameras (e.g., Contour®™, GoPro®™, etc.)

9.3.4.  Units will coordinate with their servicing contract office to ensure the applicable 
provisions of DoD Instruction 4500.53, this publication, and other relevant guidance is 
incorporated into the contract. (T-0). 
9.3.5.  Units will develop and implement door procedures for any contracted aircraft 
configuration to mitigate hazards associated with military free-fall operations. (T-2). 
9.4.  Lift Tickets.  Subject to paragraphs 9.1 and 9.3, unit commanders may authorize the 
purchase of “lift tickets” when civilian aircraft are required to conduct free-fall parachute 
training. As the government is leasing a seat on the aircraft, and not necessarily reserving all 
available seats, it may not be possible to restrict these lifts to military personnel. Separate passes 
should be used to deconflict government employed/contracted parachutists from other 
parachutists for liability purposes. When separate passes are not feasible, exits made by 
government employed/contracted parachutists and other parachutists on the same pass will be 
separated by an appropriate delay. (T-2). In these cases, government employed/contracted 
parachutists and other parachutists must maintain adequate separation during free-fall and under 
canopy. (T-2). The senior USAF JM is responsible for ensuring airspace deconfliction through 
such tools as exit order, aircraft speed, ground speed, winds aloft and free-fall speeds/tracking 
plans of other groups. The senior JM should also include a brief to the pilot and the civilian 
parachutists/organizers on pertinent details of the jump and loads of military parachutists. Drop 
zone requirements apply as defined in Chapter 10 and AFI 13-217. 
9.5.  Documenting Parachute Jumps.  Parachutists may only enter authorized jumps on an AF 
Form 3503 per Attachment 2 and subsequently have them entered in ARMS. (T-1). Authorized 
jumps may occur under the operational or tactical control of a unilateral, joint or coalition/multi-
national force commander. Parachute jumps are only considered authorized when the following 
conditions are met: 
9.5.1.  The jump is made for official purposes. 
9.5.2.  The jump is made by members on active parachute status per paragraph 3.6 
9.5.3.  The jump is made using equipment in keeping with paragraph 9.1 
9.5.4.  The jump is made from DoD aircraft or those aircraft described in paragraphs 9.2 
through 9.4 
9.6.  Foreign Military Parachutists.  Foreign military parachutists participating in combined 
operations, combined training, joint airdrop/air-transportability training, aerial events, exercises 
and US-run military parachute courses are authorized to conduct military jumps from aircraft 
owned, leased or operated by the USAF. 
9.6.1.  US Jump Host. The jump host is the US government organization that sponsors 
foreign military parachutists who are required to parachute from aircraft owned, leased or 
operated by the USAF. The US jump host is typically a unit with a parachute mission; 
however, other entities (such as the Defense Attaché Office, MAJCOM staffs or units having 
control of jump aircraft) may accomplish US jump host duties where appropriate. The US 
jump host will: 
9.6.1.1.  Ensure that foreign parachutists conduct safe parachute operations in accordance 
with US standards while aboard US aircraft. (T-1). Foreign commanders are responsible 
for their parachutists once the parachutists have exited the aircraft. 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
41 
9.6.1.2.  Ensure foreign parachutists are authorized to perform the parachute operations 
by the foreign commander of airborne forces. (T-1). Foreign commanders will verify that 
foreign parachutists are physically, physiologically, professionally and administratively 
qualified to perform the parachute operations in accordance with applicable foreign 
military standards. (T-1).  
9.6.1.3.  Gain approval to conduct parachute operations according to paragraph 9.6.4 
(T-1). 
9.6.1.4.  Inform the USAF flying unit of the participation of foreign military personnel. 
(T-2). 
9.6.1.5.  Ensure that foreign military personnel receive system specific training per 
paragraph 8.1 if they will utilize US systems or equipment. (T-2). 
9.6.1.6.  Provide a US jumpmaster to perform safety oversight to ensure foreign 
parachutists adhere to US-specific procedures and meet minimum jump, equipment, and 
support requirements dictated by US jump regulations. (T-2). US jump host will not 
conduct foreign parachutist inspections. (T-1). Preparation, rigging, donning and wear of 
parachutes and equipment will be the responsibility of the foreign parachutist and foreign 
jumpmasters. US jumpmasters will monitor and correct observed discrepancies that affect 
foreign parachutist safety or mission accomplishment. (T-2). 
9.6.2.  Language Requirements. To ensure that aircraft procedures, safety considerations and 
jumpmaster instructions are fully understood, aircraft crewmembers and jumpmasters must 
be able to communicate with the foreign parachutists. (T-0). The approval authorities listed 
in paragraph 9.6.4 determine their requirements for communication and translators. 
9.6.3.  Foreign parachutists may use US personnel parachute systems provided they are 
trained in its use according to US standards or the foreign parachutists’ country standards. 
The senior parachute commander/jumpmaster or the designated representative will ensure 
S/L or MFF qualified foreign parachutists, who are not familiar with the US parachute 
systems, receive sufficient training on the type of parachute systems used in order to ensure 
safe operation. (T-2). 
9.6.4.  Approval Authorities. MAJCOM A3, including Theater Special Operations 
Commands and overseas Commanders of Air Force Forces having operational control of 
jump aircraft, have the authority to authorize foreign military members to conduct military 
parachute jumps from aircraft owned, leased, or operated by the USAF and US personnel 
parachute systems and equipment. These commanders are authorized to delegate approval 
authority within their respective commands. Additional detail on the transport of foreign 
military personnel can be found in DoD Instruction 4515.13, Air Transportation Eligibility 
and AFI 11-401.

AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
9.7.  Civilian Parachutists. 
9.7.1.  DoD Civilian Employees. MAJCOM/A3s may authorize DoD civilian employees to 
perform official parachute jumps from aircraft owned, leased or operated by the USAF. 
Requests concerning USAF civilian positions at joint organizations should substitute the 
MAJCOM/A3 for the joint command’s operations officer, even if this is not a USAF officer. 
Additionally, if the member’s position description specifies parachute duty requirements, the 
member’s commander is the approval authority. DoD civilians do not occupy centrally 
managed parachute positions or draw parachute duty pay and are exempt from the 
requirement to utilize ARMS for documentation purposes. Units with DoD civilian 
parachutists must develop other mechanisms for tracking qualifications and currency. (T-1). 
9.7.2.  US Citizens Not Employed by the DoD. The approval authority for US citizens not 
employed by the DoD to perform official parachute jumps from aircraft owned, leased or 
operated by the USAF is the MAJCOM/A3 or designated representative. US citizens not 
covered by the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act must sign the hold harmless 
agreement contained in Attachment 4. (T-1). US citizens who are not employed by the DoD 
must be members of the United States Parachute Association, possess a D-license, and be 
certified for the skill being accomplished. (T-1). At no time will the scope of operations 
exceed the parachutist’s certifications or guidelines, as they apply to the parachutist. (T-1). 
This paragraph also applies to personnel performing government contracts since they are not 
considered DoD civilian employees by virtue of their contract and are generally not covered 
by Federal Employees’ Compensation Act. When contractors must perform parachute-related 
services, the hiring authority will delineate the requisite qualifications in the contract. (T-1). 
When the government requires that contractors comply with other portions of this instruction, 
cite the applicable references in the statement of work. 
9.7.3.  Foreign Citizens Not Employed by their Armed Forces. Flight Operations Division 
(AF/A3T) is the approval authority for requests to allow foreign civilians to fly aboard and 
jump from aircraft owned, leased or operated by the USAF in accordance with AFI 11-401. 
When authorized, these parachutists must sign the hold harmless agreement contained in 
Attachment 4. (T-1). 
9.8.  Crew Rest and Duty Limitations. 
9.8.1.  AFMAN 11-202V3 establishes crew rest criteria. Due to the unique nature of ground 
operations, parachutists are frequently unable to satisfy these provisions. When commanders 
are unable to comply with published crew rest guidance, they must determine the level of 
acceptable risk to the force and make a judgment concerning mission accomplishment. (T-2). 
9.8.2.  Members will not perform parachute jumps: 
9.8.2.1.  Within 72 hours after completing a hypobaric (altitude) chamber ride at or above 
25,000 feet MSL. (T-1). Requirements for actual operations are covered in the most 
recent version of AFI 11-409. 
9.8.2.2.  If any alcohol is consumed within 12 hours prior to exiting the aircraft or if 
impaired by alcohol or any other intoxicating substance, to include the effects or after-
effects (T-1).

Chapter 10 
PARACHUTE PROCEDURES 
10.1.  Static-Line Guidance.  For S/L parachute operations conducted by USAF units, the 
procedures defined in AFMAN11-420/TC 3-21.220 are authoritative except as noted below. 
Note: Special Warfare members covered under an AFTTP 3-3 series publication should follow 
the published TTPs and deviate by exception. 
10.2.  Exceptions to Published Static-Line Guidance.  Due to the unique nature of USAF 
parachuting, the following exceptions are granted to organizations with parachute missions 
governed by this instruction: 
10.2.1.  USAF units are not required to use non-jumping safety personnel. The JM may 
designate aircrew members to act as safety personnel if it does not interfere with their 
primary duties. Aircrew members performing safety duties will be thoroughly briefed and 
trained in the handling and control of static-lines. (T-2). 
10.2.2.  USAF units are not required to designate a Departure Airfield Control Officer 
(DACO). Establishing mechanisms for accountability and accomplishing other functions 
traditionally associated with the DACO are unit responsibilities 
10.2.3.  USAF unilateral operations only require a single JM on the aircraft, and the JM may 
be the first parachutist to exit on a pass. When an aborted exit leaves parachutists without a 
current JM, the parachutists must land with the aircraft. (T-2). 
10.2.4.  Units will conduct sustained airborne training in accordance with paragraph 8.2.1 
(T-1).  
10.2.5.  Equipment for USAF parachute operations is authorized via the USAF PPP AUL in 
accordance with Chapter 4. 
10.2.6.  Surface Wind Restrictions. During operational missions, the commander of the force 
should weigh the risks to the force and mission and coordinate wind restrictions with the 
airborne mission commander. Guidance on surface wind criteria during exercises and 
trainings provided in AFI 13-217. 
10.3.  Ram Air Parachutes.  Hybrid parachute systems have the ability to deploy the main 
canopy via static-line or free-fall activation. These systems will only be used by parachutists 
qualified through paragraph 6.6 (USAF basic military free-fall parachutist rating) who have 
received system specific training per paragraphs 7.6 and/or 9.1.1.3 (T-1). Consult the system 
specific TO/TM for instructions and restrictions. Note: Paragraph 6.6 refers to parachutists 
qualified though. Note: For RASL operations, aircrew and jumpmasters will use MFF wind 
limits and drop zone criteria. (T-3). If planned exit is below 3,500 feet above ground level 
(AGL)/above water level, parachutists and jumpmasters will ensure the AAD (if installed) is 
turned off. (T-3). 
 
 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
45 
10.4.  MFF and RASL Guidance.  For MFF and RASL parachute operations conducted by 
USAF units, the procedures defined in ATP 3-18.11 and TC 18-11 are authoritative except as 
noted below. Note: Special Warfare members covered under an AFTTP 3-3 series publication 
should follow the published TTPs and deviate by exception. Note: During parachute operations 
conducted under a joint commander, use guidance dictated by the joint organization. 
10.5.  Exceptions to Published Free-Fall and RASL Guidance.  In addition to the exceptions 
listed in paragraph 10.2, and due to the unique nature of USAF parachuting, the following 
exceptions are granted to organizations with parachute missions governed by this instruction: 
10.5.1.  Exit and Parachute Activation Altitudes. Minimum altitudes indicated below are 
listed in either AGL or above water level, as appropriate. In the absence of USAF-validated 
or DoD proponent published guidance, the manufacturer’s recommendation and 
configuration will be used (T-1). 
10.5.1.1.  Overland. 
10.5.1.1.1.  For jumps made with mission parachute equipment (non-NTRAPS), the 
exit altitude will be in accordance with approved published capabilities of the 
parachute system. (T-2). 
10.5.1.1.2.  When using NTRAPS equipped with the electronic automatic activation 
device, the exit altitude will be no lower than 3000 feet with planned pull no lower 
than 2500 feet. (T-2). 
10.5.1.2.  Overwater. During overwater free-fall operations using parachutes equipped 
with or without an electronic automatic activation device, the exit altitude will be no 
lower than 3000 feet with planned pull no lower than 2500 feet. (T-2). 
10.5.2.  Altimeters. Each parachutist will wear an altimeter when conducting overland free-
fall operations. (T-2). If waterproof altimeters are available, they will be used for overwater 
free-fall operations. (T-2). At a minimum, water jumps will have one operational altimeter in 
the aircraft for parachutist use. (T-2). During night operations, altimeters either will have an 
integrated light or configured with a light source adequate to illuminate the altimeter’s face. 
(T-2). Parachutists using any style camera will use an additional audible altimeter. (T-2) 
10.5.3.  Automatic Activation Device (AAD). Parachutist exiting an aircraft under MFF 
conditions will be equipped with an armed and functional AAD. (T-1). When waterproof 
AADs are available, they will be used for overwater free-fall operations. (T-1). Inspection, 
calibration, arming and documentation procedures for AADs are contained in applicable 
TOs/TMs and manufacturer’s instructions. 
10.5.4.  Surface Wind Restrictions. During operational missions, the commander of the force 
to be inserted will weigh the risks to the force and mission and coordinate wind restrictions 
with the airborne mission commander. (T-2). During exercises and training, the surface wind 
criteria listed in AFI 13-217 will be used. (T-1). 
 
 
46 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
10.5.5.  Free-Fall Drop Zone Criteria. The JM will determine the minimum sized drop zone 
(DZ) based on the number of personnel to be dropped, parachutist proficiency and prevailing 
winds in accordance with AFI 13-217. (T-1). For DZ criteria, see AFI 13-217 and Chapter 
11 of this instruction. During operational missions, the commander of the force to be inserted 
will weigh the risks to the force and mission and coordinate DZ criteria with the airborne 
mission commander. (T-2). 
10.5.6.  Oxygen Requirements. Pre-breathing, high-altitude airdrop mission support 
technician and procedural requirements for MFF operations that require oxygen are 
prescribed in AFI 11-409. 
10.5.7.  Contact Flying. Contact flying is defined as pre-meditated contact between 
parachutists during free-fall. Personnel conducting contact flying will document progression 
in OJT records. (T-1). 
10.5.8.  Canopy Relative Work (CRW). CRW is defined as the intentional maneuvering of 
two or more open parachute canopies in contact with one another during descent. USAF 
parachutists will not engage in any CRW while on duty. (T-1). 
10.6.  Jumpmaster Requirement.  The primary JM will be responsible to the appropriate 
commander (e.g., Ground Force Commander, Mission Commander, Flight Commander, etc.) for 
the conduct of all phases of the mission that pertain to the parachute operation. (T-2). Proper 
planning and execution by the JM are a critical aspect of tactically inserting parachute forces and 
supports the operational, functional and management objectives of the USAF PPP. Each aircraft 
dropping parachutists will have a minimum of one JM, although two are preferable. (T-2). 
During operations conducted by USAF units, the procedures defined in AFMAN 11-420/TC 3-
21.220, ATP 3-18.11 and TC 18-11 are authoritative except as noted below. Note: Special 
Warfare members covered under an AFTTP 3-3 series publication should follow the published 
TTPs and deviate by exception. Note: During parachute operations conducted under a joint 
commander, use guidance dictated by the joint organization. 
10.7.  Jumpmaster Employment Planning.  When the commander determines that parachute 
employment is required, the JM will be given responsibility for planning and executing the jump. 
(T-3). 
10.7.1.  Establishing mechanisms for accountability and accomplishing other functions 
traditionally associated with the DACO are unit responsibilities that may or may not be 
delegated to the JM. The JM should be intimately familiar with the post-jump movement 
plan since it influences the individual parachutist’s equipment requirements. 
10.7.2.  Guidance on conducting DZ surveys and site evaluations is provided in AFI 13-217. 
(T-1). For DZs at higher elevations, anticipate an increased rate of descent. During combat 
operations or operations short of war for which it is not tactically feasible to conduct a 
survey, units assess intended landing areas through the most accurate means available. 
 
 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
47 
10.7.3.  A weather evaluation must be made by the JM to determine current and forecasted 
drop conditions. (T-2). Wind characteristics are amongst the most important evaluation 
items. During operational missions, the commander of the force to be inserted will weigh the 
risks to the force and mission and coordinate wind restrictions with the airborne mission 
commander. (T-2). Maximum allowable wind velocity depends on the experience and ability 
of the team, the equipment, the terrain and urgency of the mission. Guidance on surface wind 
criteria during exercises and training is provided in AFI 13-217. (T-2). 
10.7.4.  The JM is responsible for the items in paragraph 2.13 and for ensuring that all 
parachutists meet currency, refresher training and recurring training requirements in Chapter 
8. At a minimum, the JM briefing during sustained airborne training will consist of the 
mission purpose and type, equipment requirements, plan of action, special requirements and 
safety considerations. (T-1). 
10.8.  Jumpmaster Coordination. 
10.8.1.  The JM will coordinate support requirements to include transportation, DZ 
scheduling, ground party availability, aircraft utilization and equipment. (T-2). 
10.8.2.  The JM will ensure that the DZC has a complete understanding of the operation, 
equipment requirements, number of personnel involved and special requirements. (T-2). 
10.8.3.  The JM will retain overall responsibility for the accuracy of mission parachutist data 
on the passenger manifest. (T-2). 
10.8.4.  The JM will maintain ultimate responsible for briefing safety personnel and aircrew 
in accordance with the guidance applicable to the planned type of parachute employment, 
conducting a thorough inspection of the airdrop aircraft and determining the load and exit 
order. (T-2). 
10.8.5.  The JM will keep parachutists informed of mission progress and changes. (T-2). 
10.8.6.  The JM will complete and certify AF Form 3503 in accordance with Attachment 2. 
(T-1). 
10.9.  Rigging and Inspecting Parachutists and Equipment. 
10.9.1.  The JM will ensure the JM kit is prepared and available per unit SOPs. (T-2). 
10.9.2.  The JM is responsible for rigging door bundles and will inspect personnel parachutes 
and equipment. (T-2). 
10.9.3.  When only one JM is available, specifically trained and certified personnel will 
conduct a JM personnel inspection (JMPI) on the JM if the JM is rigged to jump. (T-1). 
These personnel will be selected based on experience and recommendation from an OJT 
certifier and will receive JMPI training for systems they will inspect. (T-1). JMPI training 
will be conducted in accordance with the references in paragraph 10.6 and the plans or 
courses of instruction in paragraphs 6.4.2, and 6.7.2 (T-1). For military personnel, JMPI 
training will be documented in the member’s training records via AF Form 623A. (T-1). 
Note: The primary JM may approve alternate rigging of personal equipment if it does not 
interfere with the fit, safety and operational use of the parachute system being utilized.

AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
 
10.10.  Safety.  The JM maintains control of parachutists in and around aircraft and enforces 
safety standards. The JM also ensures all parachutists leave the aircraft properly configured and 
employ authorized techniques. Additional detail on JM actions in the unit area, at the departure 
airfield, and in flight are contained in the references in paragraph 10.6 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020

Chapter 11 
DROP ZONE PROCEDURES 
11.1.  Drop Zone Guidance.  For parachute operations conducted by USAF units, the 
procedures defined in AFI 13-217 are authoritative. This chapter defines additional requirements. 
During parachute operations conducted under a joint commander, use guidance dictated by the 
joint organization. Training jumps should closely duplicate conditions that could be encountered 
during operational missions, to include rough terrain, open sea and unfamiliar or unimproved 
areas. Care will be taken to ensure that all conditions, especially those that are safety-related are 
identified to the JM and parachutists. 
11.2.  Drop Zone Personnel Requirements.  Drop zone personnel requirements are contained 
in AFI 13-217. Drop zone wind readings may be captured using analog or digital anemometers. 
Note: USPA certified drop zones with a manifest controller meet the requirement for a drop zone 
controller when conducting “lift ticket” jumps. 
11.3.  Medical Coverage.  Medical coverage must be provided for all non-contingency 
personnel parachute operations. (T-1). In the event of a medical emergency, medical personnel 
and equipment will be capable of immediate and appropriate intervention. (T-1). Medical 
coverage will be located on or immediately adjacent to the DZ and will be co-located with the 
DZC. (T-2). If the medical response capability is dislocated from the DZC, they must have 
functional 2-way communications throughout the jump operation. (T-2). Medical coverage for 
USAF personnel parachuting operations consisting of six or less parachutists per pass will be a 
minimum of one appropriately equipped and current Emergency Medical Technician qualified at 
the Basic level (EMT-B) or higher and a dedicated driver. For passes consisting of greater than 
six parachutists, a minimum of two appropriately equipped and current EMT-Bs, or higher, and a 
dedicated driver must be present. (T-2). Additionally, analyze Risk Management for higher risk 
operations and increase medical coverage as appropriate. Note: Exception: The first O-6 in the 
chain of command can waive this requirement when jumping USPA-certified drop zones and an 
advanced life support level response in under 15 minutes can be pre-coordinated. 
11.3.1.  Medical personnel must be equipped with functional emergency lifesaving and 
stabilization equipment as well as the means to transport patients to definitive medical care. 
(T-1). Equipment will include, but is not limited to a medical kit, positive pressure oxygen, 
pelvic binder, femur traction split, spinal immobilization and a litter suitable for medical 
evacuation (with flotation if required). (T-1). 
11.3.2.  The requirement for medical personnel will be satisfied when two or more 
parachutists who meet the requirements in paragraph 11.3 exit the aircraft as part of the first 
group on the first pass, and the stick consists of six or less parachutists (including the medical 
personnel) and a transport mechanism is available. (T-2). In this case the paragraph 11.3.1 
listed equipment should be co-located with the drop zone controller, the transportation 
mechanism, or otherwise immediately available. 
11.4.  Intentional Water Operations.  Support for intentional water operations will include a 
boat operator and a qualified safety swimmer for every boat. (T-1). Training requirements for 
parachutists participating in intentional water jumps are listed in paragraph 8.2.3 
50 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
11.4.1.  Safety swimmers must be capable of assisting parachutists who cannot maintain 
buoyancy, who are rendered unconscious, or who become fouled in their equipment or 
parachute system. (T-1). Equipment and requisite qualifications for safety swimmers are 
described in AFMAN 11-420/TC 3-21.220. Graduates of the following courses are qualified 
to perform as safety swimmers: any military diving course, Special Forces Water Infiltration 
Course, Navy Rescue Swimmer Course, Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance Course, 
Coast Guard Aviation Survival Technician A-School, Army Class 1 advanced survival 
swimmer (in accordance with Training Circular 21-21, Water Survival Training), Army 
Basic Scout Swimmer, USMC Basic Scout Swimmer, USMC CWS1, Navy 1st class, 
American Red Cross life guard, or American Red Cross open water rescue. Commanders 
may require that safety swimmers be qualified military divers when conditions warrant. 
11.4.2.  Safety boat personnel must be trained and equipped to quickly locate and recover 
distressed personnel on the surface. (T-1). Military or civilian training programs, including 
the United States Coast Guard Boat Operators Course, are acceptable. 
11.4.3.  During USAF intentional water operations, one power driven recovery boat must be 
present for every three parachutists on a single pass in accordance with AFMAN 11-420/TC 
3-21.220. (T-1). When all parachutists are military divers, the minimum number of power-
driven recovery boats must be one for every six parachutists on a single pass. (T-1). 
Airdropped boats are not considered functional until operational, at which point they may be 
used for recovery operations. Planners will ensure that parachutists will not exceed Coast 
Guard and manufacturer boat load limits, and watercraft will not be smaller than a combat 
rubber raiding craft. (T-1). Safety boats must be appropriately equipped to support water 
recovery operations in accordance with AFMAN 11-420/TC 3-21.220. (T-1). A working 
search light must be present for night operations. (T-1). 
11.4.4.  Medical coverage must be in place prior to personnel airdrops. (T-1). If medical 
personnel are not in the same safety boat as the drop zone controller, communications must 
be assured. (T-1).

Chapter 12 
PARACHUTE RELATED AERIAL EVENTS 
12.1.  Charter.  In keeping with USAF PPP objectives, the Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT) is 
chartered to conduct parachute related aviation support to public and/or military events, to 
support general USAF and jump-inherent specialty recruiting, and to instruct premeditated 
parachute procedures that improve survivability, develop confidence and establish an airmanship 
foundation. 
12.2.  Administrative Guidance.  All parachutists at the AFPT must follow the procedures and 
documentation requirements detailed in Chapter 3, as clarified in this paragraph. (T-1). 
12.2.1.  Parachute Positions. AFPT military staff parachutists occupy valid parachute 
positions and will be eligible to draw parachute duty pay based on the same rules that apply 
to other USAF parachutists. (T-1). Aviation cadets assigned to the AFPT support its charter 
and are required to be on active parachute status; however, they are not eligible to draw 
parachute duty pay and are not assigned an ASC in conjunction with paragraph 3.5.2 As 
such, these parachutists occupy student authorizations rather than parachute positions, which 
imply a budget obligation. 
12.2.2.  Documentation. Aviation cadets who are both assigned to the AFPT and eligible for 
the basic parachutist rating are authorized to document parachute jumps in the ARMS 
operational or training databases in order to ensure compliance with standards, requisite 
qualifications and currency. Members will not count parachute jumps made as an aviation 
cadet towards advanced ratings, unless these jumps are made while enrolled in another 
program, such as those in Chapter 6. (T-1). 
12.3.  AFPT Procedures.  While AFPT members qualified through paragraph 6.3.2 are not 
considered MFF parachutists (unless also qualified through paragraph 6.6), they are MFF 
parachutists subject to the provisions in paragraphs 10.4-10.7 and elsewhere in this instruction, 
as clarified in this chapter. 
12.3.1.  Certification. Apart from the qualification training prescribed in Chapter 6, AFPT 
progression and competencies (e.g., non-JM upgrade progression, certification to jump public 
relations devices, etc.) are considered functional certifications and will be administered by 
the MAJCOM in accordance with paragraph 7.1 (T-1). During parachute competitions 
where parachutists must perform aerial videography in accordance with competition rules, 
the AFPT’s parent MAJCOM is the waiver authority for the restrictions contained in 
paragraph 12.6.4 concerning separation between government employed/contracted 
parachutists and other parachutists. (T-2). 
12.3.2.  Currency. In addition to the provisions in Chapter 8, in order to jumpmaster active 
AM-490 students, a JM must have performed duties within the previous 365 days where 
parachutists exited the aircraft. (T-1). Non-current JMs and parachutists will accomplish 
refresher training in accordance with procedures. (T-1). 
 
 
52 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
12.3.3.  Equipment. In accordance with paragraph 8.5 of this instruction, the AFPT is 
authorized to satisfy its requirement for parachute rigging by employing senior or master 
riggers qualified through FAR Part 65. Parachutists assigned to the AFPT are exempt from 
the 50-jump minimum prior to NTRAPS transition and, with unit commanders approval, are 
authorized to deviate from Chapter 9 canopy wing loading and minimum canopy size 
requirements, not to exceed manufacturer’s recommendation. Transition plans will be 
utilized in accordance with locally developed procedures. (T-1). 
12.3.4.  Exit and planned pull altitudes. The minimum planned pull altitude for AFPT 
parachutists using NTRAPS is 2500 feet AGL per paragraph 10.5.1.1.2, however AFPT 
members using NTRAPS may exit at 2500 feet AGL (clear and pull). During parachute 
demonstrations and competitions, the drop zone control officer may waive both the exit and 
the planned pull altitude to no lower than 2000 feet AGL (clear and pull). AF/A3S will not 
waive planned exits or pull altitudes below 2000 feet AGL. 
12.3.5.  Guidance on the AFPT being exempt from completing formal drop zone surveys 
based on the nature of the aerial event mission is provided in AFI 13-217. (T-2). The AFPT 
will adhere to MAJCOM-approved procedures to mitigate risk in this area. (T-2). 
12.4.  Aerial Event Guidance.  A functional objective of the PPP is to provide parachute related 
aviation support to public and/or military events to showcase military preparedness, demonstrate 
capabilities, promote good community and international relations, support USAF recruiting and 
retention efforts and render military honors. AFI 11-209 governs USAF participation in aerial 
events. Parachutists typically participate in two types of aerial events: static displays and aerial 
demonstrations. Attachment 1 defines terms that pertain to aerial events. Forward requests for 
events that involve USAF parachuting in accordance with AFI 11-209. Commanders of flying 
organizations are encouraged to provide airlift support for parachute participation in aerial 
events. 
12.4.1.  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Guidance. Parachutists participating in aerial 
events must comply with applicable FAA guidance, including Federal Aviation Regulation 
Part 105, Order 8900.1, Flight Standards Information Management System; Advisory 
Circular 90-66B, Non-Towered Airport Flight Operations; Advisory Circular 91-45C, 
Waivers—Aviation Events; and Advisory Circular 105-2E, Sport Parachuting. (T-0). 
12.4.2.  United States Parachute Association (USPA) Guidance. Parachutists participating in 
public aerial events must comply with applicable USPA guidance contained in the Skydiver’s 
Information Manual. (T-1). 
12.4.3.  Parachute jumps made in direct support of other PPP objectives are not considered 
aerial events. In these cases, a MAJCOM PPPM will be responsible to determine when FAA 
and USPA guidance apply. (T-2). 
12.4.4.  Unless specifically noted, guidance articulated elsewhere in this instruction is 
applicable to personnel and aircraft participating in aerial events. 
 
 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
53 
12.5.  Capabilities Demonstrations or Capabilities Exercises (CAPEX).  A CAPEX is a type 
of aerial demonstration in which parachutists demonstrate operational equipment and TTPs 
common to the military capability being displayed. Parachutists will not be authorized to jump 
flags, streamers, banners, smoke or other public relations devices in conjunction with a CAPEX. 
(T-1). MAJCOM PPPM approved capability demonstrations using operational S/L and/or MFF 
parachute systems and TTPs may be conducted using personnel who maintain qualifications and 
currency according to this instruction. 
12.6.  Parachute Demonstrations.  A parachute demonstration is a type of aerial demonstration 
conducted during public or military events principally for community and international relations, 
esprit-de-corps, or recruiting purposes. As they showcase precision parachuting, demonstrations 
require planning, detailed coordination, strict adherence to applicable guidance, routine practice 
and an experienced team. 
12.6.1.  Minimum Qualifications. Commanders will carefully select parachutists to 
participate in parachute demonstrations based upon experience, maturity and demonstrated 
capability. (T-2). For demonstrations that call for free-fall employment, parachutists must 
have a minimum of 100 ram air canopy jumps. (T-1). Commanders will identify and certify 
members for participation in aerial events on AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard 
Continuation/Command JQS. (T-1). 
12.6.2.  Organizations that conduct parachute demonstrations are encouraged to utilize a 
narrator to help interpret the experience for the audience. Narration is a functional 
certification that should tie introductory, historical, descriptive and contingency scripts into 
USAF messages such as general or jump-inherent specialty recruiting. 
12.6.3.  Parachutists who jump flags, streamers, banners, smoke or other public relations 
devices will be functionally certified for the task by their MAJCOM. (T-1). These devices 
must not interfere with the safe deployment and operation of any parachute system. (T-1).  
12.6.4.  The demonstration of canopy relative work (CRW) will be limited to AFPT members 
only. (T-1). AFPT members will be functionally certified to conduct CRW by their parent 
MAJCOM. (T-1). 
12.6.5.  As it relates to aerial events, the term parachute demonstration does not refer to the 
functional PPP objective of instructing and demonstrating proper premeditated and 
emergency egress procedures as a part of survival or parachute training programs. 
12.7.  Parachute Competitions.  Parachute competitions are a type of aerial demonstration, 
generally conducted as a public event by an event organizer. 
12.7.1.  Minimum Qualifications. The squadron commander will carefully select parachutists 
to participate in parachute competitions based upon experience, maturity and demonstrated 
capability. (T-2). The minimum experience is normally dictated by competition category by 
the event organizer. Commanders will identify and certify members for participation in aerial 
events on AF Form 797. (T-1). 
 
 
54 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
 
12.7.2.  The conduct of competition CRW will be limited to AFPT members only. (T-1). 
AFPT members will be functionally certified to conduct CRW by their parent MAJCOM. (T-
1).

Terms 
Aerial Demonstration—a subset of aviation support, includes virtually every type of aerial 
participation in public or military events. 
Aerial Event—synonymous with aviation support, comprises static display, flyover, aerial 
review and aerial demonstration. Parachutists are principally involved in aerial demonstrations 
and static displays. 
60 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT)—the USAF parachute team, popularly known as the 
“Wings of Blue.” The AFPT has showcased parachute capabilities during aerial events for public 
and military audiences since 1964. 
Capabilities Demonstration or Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX)—associated with either 
aircraft or parachutists demonstrating operational equipment and tactics, techniques and 
procedures. A CAPEX is a type of aerial demonstration. 
Capability Development Document (CDD)—captures the information necessary to develop a 
proposed program, and outlines the affordability increment of capability for a spiral acquisition 
strategy. The CDD provides the operational performance attributes and is updated for each 
increment so the values only apply to the increment considered. 
Combat Capability Document—used to document deficiencies arising during combat or crisis 
operations. It is used in the Rapid Response Process to accelerate the fielding of critical systems 
to meet theater-specific wartime needs. The CDD replaced the Combat Mission Needs Statement 
(C-MNS) and is described in AFI 10-601, Operational Capability Requirements Development. 
Combined Operation—an operation conducted by forces of two or more allied nations. 
Drop Zone Controller (DZC)—a qualified individual in charge of a DZ operation who 
represents the appropriate commander per AFI 13-217. 
Free-Fall Parachute—a parachute system in which the canopies are deployed by the parachutist 
during free-fall descent. 
Incident—any procedure that prevented the successful completion of any planned airdrop 
operation. 
Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)—makes a case for a capability to resolve a gap identified 
by JCIDS analysis. Defines gaps in terms of functional areas, relevant range of military 
operations, time, obstacles to overcome and key attributes with appropriate measures of 
effectiveness, as well as proposes a recommended solution serving as the beginning for analysis 
of alternatives. Once approved, it is not normally updated. 
Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)—Chairman, Joint Chiefs of 
Staff system for identifying, assessing and prioritizing joint military capability needs. It 
implements a capabilities-based approach to better leverage the expertise in government 
agencies, industry and academia to identify improvements to existing capabilities, and to develop 
new warfighting capabilities. Parachute requirements are generally delegated to the lowest 
approval level in the process due to the comparatively small force size and low monetary 
thresholds involved. 
Joint Operation—a general term to describe military actions conducted by joint forces or 
service forces in relationships (e.g., supported, supporting, coordinating), which, of themselves, 
do not constitute joint forces. In this context, a joint operation is any operation conducted under 
the authority of a joint commander. When a USAF commander is the supported commander, that 
commander may have this instruction govern employment of the joint force. 
Malfunction—the failure of an airdrop item or component of an airdrop system to function as it 
was intended or designed. 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
61 
Military Event—an official DoD event conducted in support of an assigned mission, including 
purposes of esprit-de-corps, primarily for military or civil service personnel, dependents, and 
limited guests. The event must be hosted on a facility owned, leased or operated by the DoD. 
Mishap—an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or injury. 
Non-Tactical Ram-Air Parachute System (NTRAPS)—A Commercial ram air systems 
(canopies, harness, container and AAD) that are generally not maintained in accordance with a 
TO/TM and are principally designed for the sport parachuting market. NTRAPS are primarily 
intended for use by parachutists who possess functional certifications, by members who are in 
training leading to functional certification and by the Air Force Parachute Team. 
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)—the originating office for a publication. The author 
of the publication is an individual within the office, in this case the USAF PPPM. 
Parachute Badge—a distinctive emblem worn on a member’s uniform that signifies attainment 
of a USAF parachutist rating. Parachutist badges correspond to USAF parachutist ratings and are 
permanent unless specifically revoked. 
Parachute Rating—a classification that represents a member’s level of parachute experience. 
The USAF awards basic ratings by publishing an AO when a member meets the standards and 
qualification requirements in Chapter 6 and the requirements listed in AFMAN 11-402 
pertaining to length of service and number and type of jumps. The USAF awards advanced 
ratings to members who attain specified levels of experience. 
Pass—an approach made over the DZ by an airdrop aircraft. Several groups or sticks of 
parachutists may exit on a single pass. 
Public Event—community relations event not connected with the military functioning of the 
DoD and intended primarily for non-military audiences. Some examples include military open 
house events, ceremonies, exhibitions, expositions, athletic contests, fairs, parades, tattoos, 
airshows, international airshows and trade exhibitions, or similar programs. These events may be 
on- or off-base, CONUS or Outside the Continental United States. Public events can be 
sponsored by either DoD or non-DoD organizations. Military exercises, movements, maneuvers 
or operations are not considered public events merely based on being incidentally observed by 
the general public. Such events can be good community relations and recruiting opportunities. 
Rigger—an individual qualified to inspect, packs and repair parachutes. 
Static Display—a subset of aviation support, the ground display of personnel and equipment that 
comprise a military capability. 
Static-Line Parachute—a parachute system in which a line or strap is attached from the 
parachute to an anchor cable in the aircraft so that, when the parachutist exits the aircraft, the 
parachute is deployed automatically. 
 
 
62 
AFI10-3503  23 SEPTEMBER 2020 
Student Authorization—a term used uniquely to define a position that requires parachuting at 
the USAF Academy that is not subject to the validation process in paragraphs 3.3., 3.4., or 3.5. 
Personnel in student authorizations are typically cadets, but not universally (e.g., unassigned 
Regular Air Force personnel attending AM-490). Student authorizations are used to place 
members on active parachute status for the purpose of enrollment in AM-490, AM-491 or AM-
496. Personnel in student authorizations are not assigned an Aviation Service Code and are not 
authorized to draw parachute duty pay, however cadets enrolled in AM-491 or higher-level 
programs are authorized to document parachute jumps in the ARMS operational or training 
databases in order to ensure compliance with standards, requisite qualifications and currency. 
AFPT military staff parachutists occupy valid parachute positions as opposed to student 
authorizations. 
Unilateral Operation—an operation conducted by a single service. In this context, any 
operation conducted under the authority of a USAF commander where joint participation is 
incidental to the overall operation.
