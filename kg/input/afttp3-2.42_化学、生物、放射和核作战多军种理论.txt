Preface 
SCOPE 
This publication provides tactical-level commanders and staffs with keystone doctrine for operations to prevent, 
counter, defend, and mitigate the entire range of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats, 
hazards, and effects—including support to combating weapons of mass destruction (CWMD) activities in all 
operational environments. It addresses operational concepts, principles, fundamentals, planning, operational 
considerations, and training and support functions. 
Note. While certain domestic response plans address high-yield explosives, this publication does 
not include high-yield explosives as a specific CBRN threat or hazard per Joint Publication (JP) 
3-41. 
PURPOSE  
The purpose of this publication is to guide tactical commanders and staffs while they are conducting operations 
to shape the CBRN threat and hazard, facilitate the larger joint force mission, and serve military and national 
strategy. This includes two important objectives: 
• 
To enhance mission effectiveness by preparing personnel, equipment, and facilities to react to, survive, 
and recover from hazard conditions. 
• 
To prevent, counter, defend, and mitigate to enable deployed forces to continue mission-critical 
operations under CBRN hazard conditions.  
This publication serves as a foundation for developing multi-Service and Service-specific manuals, standing 
operating procedures, and response standards and for refining existing training support packages, mission 
training plans, training center and unit exercises, and Service school curricula. It drives the examination of 
organizations and materiel developments applicable to the military support of CBRN operations. At a minimum, 
this manual— 
• 
Serves as the overarching and integrating doctrinal bridge to all supporting CBRN multi-Service 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) publications and their application in support of CWMD at 
the tactical level.  
• 
Provides a link between CBRN operations multi-Service doctrine and the appropriate joint doctrine, 
namely JP 3-11, JP 3-40, and JP 3-41. 
• 
Provides a reference summary of relevant strategic and operational guidance for CWMD contained 
within national security and national military policy, strategy, and treaties. 
• 
Introduces and summarizes the challenges associated with global CBRN threats and hazards. 
APPLICATION 
This publication applies to the Active Army, the Army National Guard (ARNG)/Army National Guard of the 
United States (ARNGUS), and the United States Army Reserve (USAR) unless otherwise stated.  This 
publication is designed for use at the tactical level and supports military and nonmilitary commanders and 
staffs.

Introduction 
This manual— 
• 
Addresses CBRN threats and hazards.  
• 
Defines CBRN operations and how they support U.S. policy and strategy through weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD) proliferation prevention, WMD counterforce, CBRN defense, and CBRN 
consequence management. 
• 
Introduces installation CBRN protection. 
• 
Introduces military health system support in a CBRN environment. 
This revision of the March 2003 Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and 
Chemical Defense Operations into Multiservice Doctrine for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear 
Operations represents a significant change to our key tactical level doctrine for military operations conducted in 
environments where potential, threatened, or actual CBRN hazards may be present.  
This edition includes several key changes that were necessary to transform former nuclear, biological, and 
chemical defense doctrine into the broader range of CBRN operations, which are consistent with the current and 
future operational environments. At the national level, this was recognized by the National Strategy to Combat 
Weapons of Mass Destruction and by the corresponding National Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of 
Mass Destruction. Joint concepts and doctrine have also been updated to reflect the operational environment 
and the current and projected guidance for conducting military operations.   
The publication begins with an overview of CBRN threats and hazards. It explicitly distinguishes between 
threats (associating them with WMD) and other CBRN hazards, including toxic industrial materials and weapon 
effects. This deliberate separation of WMD from toxic industrial materials is one of the key underlying themes 
for this doctrinal update. Adversarial intent in the use of WMD was the traditional defense concern for military 
operations in the past, but a broader range of hazard potential from toxic industrial materials has proven to be 
tactically significant during recent military operations. Further, an understanding of the WMD proliferation 
continuum allows us to address the unique challenges for successful military operations in these and related 
environments.   
From this baseline understanding of CBRN threats and hazards and the nature of the operational environment, 
we can then turn our attention to U.S. policy and strategy. This manual provides a brief overview of national 
policy and strategy and related military strategies, policies, and doctrine. From these strategic and operational 
implications, we then present a current framework for CBRN operations, including a tactical level task 
taxonomy to support commanders. This framework for CBRN operations represents a major shift from the 
former, passive defense nature against nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons to a broader, active, and 
preventive approach toward a wider range of CBRN threats and hazards. 
It is important to implement a fundamental framework that is employed in support of tactical, operational 
objectives. This revision presents a CBRN operations framework that is consistent with strategic themes and 
presents operational level tasks in a series of chapters that translate them into tactical level tasks for the armed 
forces. These tactical tasks include activities that directly or indirectly support strategic objectives in an effort to 
prevent WMD proliferation or to counter WMD proliferation once it has occurred and resulted in the potential 
or actual employment. The tasks also include consequence management activities that are necessary to mitigate 
the effects of CBRN hazards, whether or not they are intentionally employed. This material represents a 
significant doctrinal shift from “reactive” to “proactive” military capabilities. These actions are being performed 
at the tactical level, perhaps, now more than ever. 
This publication also introduces emergency management doctrine for DOD installations to address protection 
from CBRN and other threats and hazards. Our Services frequently combine CBRN operations with an all-
hazard approach to protect DOD installations and related locations such as bases, base camps, and key 
activities.

Finally, this manual introduces common themes for the military health system support in CBRN operational 
environments. These measures enable protection and preservation of the force from health hazards associated 
with the effects of CBRN hazards. 
There are three supporting appendixes that provide supplemental material which is fundamental to 
understanding the nature of CBRN operations. An appendix that addresses CBRN hazards provides additional 
details (description, physiological actions, and effects) for each of the four hazard types. There is also an 
appendix with an introduction to key treaties and policies so that the reader may better understand the 
operational environment in which other nations are involved. The last appendix includes the basic standards of 
proficiency for multinational operations in CBRN environments as agreed upon by a North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) standardization agreement.

Chapter 1 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Threats 
and Hazards 
This chapter discusses CBRN threats and hazards within the construct of the WMD 
proliferation continuum and describes how key players, such as state and nonstate 
actors, attempt to acquire WMD-related materials. Understanding the difference 
between CBRN threats and hazards; the terms threat reduction cooperation, 
contamination avoidance, and chemical warfare; and the relationships between 
individuals and groups that may seek to harm the United States is critical to 
supporting the nation’s strategy to combat WMD. 
OVERVIEW 
1-1. CBRN operations include the employment of tactical capabilities that counter the entire range 
of CBRN threats and hazards through WMD proliferation prevention, WMD counterforce, CBRN 
defense, and CBRN consequence management activities. CBRN operations support operational and 
strategic objectives to combat WMD and operate safely in a CBRN environment. A CBRN 
environment consists of conditions found in an area resulting from immediate or persistent effects of 
CBRN attacks or unintentional releases. The following definitions are provided: 
 
WMD. WMD are CBRN weapons that are capable of causing a high order of destruction or 
mass casualties and exclude the means of transporting or propelling the weapon if such means 
are a separate, divisible part of the weapon.  
 
Threat reduction cooperation. Threat reduction cooperation consists of activities that are 
undertaken with the consent and cooperation of host nation authorities in a permissive 
environment to enhance physical security and to reduce, dismantle, redirect, and/or improve the 
protection of a state’s existing WMD program, stockpiles, and capabilities. 
 
Contamination avoidance. Contamination avoidance is individual and/or unit measures that are 
taken to reduce the effects of CBRN hazards. 
 
Chemical warfare. Chemical warfare is all aspects of military operations involving the 
employment of lethal and incapacitating munitions/agents and the warning and protective 
measures associated with such offensive operations. Since riot control agents and herbicides are 
not considered to be chemical warfare agents, they will be referred to separately or under the 
broader term of chemical, which will be used to include all types of chemical munitions/agents 
collectively. 
1-2. It is important to understand that not all terrorist incidents are CBRN incidents and not all CBRN 
incidents are terrorist incidents. For a terrorist incident to be categorized as a CBRN incident, a CBRN 
element that results in a high level of destruction must be involved. This definition omits incidents that 
involve the use of only high-yield explosives. This publication does not include high-yield explosives in the 
definition of CBRN and would, therefore, not categorize events involving only high-yield explosives as 
CBRN incidents. However, certain domestic response plans do address high-yield explosives. 
THREATS 
1-3. Hostile state and nonstate actors, including terrorists and supporters of terrorists, seeking to acquire 
WMD materials may pose a threat to the United States and its allies. CBRN threats include the 
intentional employment of, or intent to employ, weapons or improvised devices to produce CBRN 
hazards.

FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42 
1 July 2011 
PROLIFERATION 
1-4. Proliferation refers to the transfer of WMD-related materials, technology, and expertise from 
suppliers to hostile state or nonstate actors. The proliferation of WMD and supporting technologies and the 
expansion of terrorism have made the potential use of these weapons against the United States and its allies 
more likely. In some cases, the entire CBRN development process can be accomplished in hard and deeply 
buried targets/underground facilities, making it more difficult to generate the intelligence to locate, 
identify, and characterize CBRN infrastructures.  
1-5. The proliferation continuum illustrates how hostile states and terrorists may seek to acquire WMD-
related materials in attempts to threaten the United States and its allies and cause chemical, biological, or 
radiological contamination in military operational areas. The proliferation continuum refers to a series of 
activities that adversaries may execute to develop and/or acquire WMD. The generic activities of 
proliferation include the decision to proliferate, infrastructure and expertise development, production, 
weaponization, deployment, and employment (see figure 1-1). This continuum may be encountered in a 
nonsequential fashion; for example, an adversary may buy a weapon system that is ready for immediate 
employment and bypass stages such as production and weaponization.

FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42 
1-3 
1-6. A proliferant group or nation requires the will, equipment, technical knowledge, people, money, and 
time to successfully develop and sustain this process. Completely halting proliferation is impossible, but 
restricting it is vitally important and achievable. To that end, the DOD is playing an active role in 
technology transfer and export controls and in the implementation of arms control and nonproliferation 
regimes. 
GLOBALIZATION 
1-7. The proliferation of missile technology has enabled many states to acquire delivery systems that can 
range well outside their immediate regions. A number of states have systems that can strike targets within 
the United States. Long-range WMD delivery systems enable an adversary to deter U.S. action, deny access 
to its territory or intermediate staging bases, preempt a pending operation, strike U.S. allies to affect U.S. 
policy, or simply coerce the United States to alter its policy.  
1-8. U.S. forces have global reach and are capable of engaging threats, influencing potential adversaries, 
assuring friends, and promoting peace and stability with a variety of capabilities. However, global reach 
and influence are not just the purview of nation-states. Globalization and emerging technologies allow 
small transnational groups to use asymmetric approaches (including criminal activity, terrorism, or armed 
aggression with international reach) with relative ease and little cost.

1-9. A program is considered to be a WMD program if it is funded and developed for that purpose and 
has a process or procedure designated strictly for WMD development. A program need not be sufficiently 
advanced to yield a weapon or device to be considered a WMD program since it takes years or decades to 
fully develop that type of program—depending on technology; engineering; funds; materials; and the 
determination of a state actor, nonstate actor, or terrorist group. The United States acknowledges that some 
nations have a WMD program. However, when WMD programs are developed by adversaries who may use 
them to threaten the United States and its allies, the United States and its forces may take actions to disrupt, 
prevent, deny, dissuade, reverse, reduce, or destroy WMD and related programs through interdiction, 
elimination, or offensive operations.  
1-10. The presence of WMD poses a great challenge within a region. It disrupts U.S. and international 
efforts to foster stability and curtail proliferation activity. Additionally, the perceived imbalance in power 
can lead to active proliferation among neighboring states (such as Pakistan and India), delivering a severe 
blow to ongoing nonproliferation, counterproliferation, or other diplomatic and economic efforts. The 
challenges of states possessing WMD, even short of employment (presence, proliferation, and stability 
disruption), may prove to be the most challenging and dangerous to U.S. interests. The growing availability 
of WMD-related technologies, precursors, and expertise and the sophistication of these technologies 
compound the threat. Precursors are any chemical reaction that takes place at any stage in the production of 
a toxic chemical by whatever method, including key components and multicomponent chemical systems. 
STATE AND NONSTATE ACTORS 
1-11. Threats from the proliferation of WMD come from state and nonstate actors. State actors may have 
incentives to acquire CBRN weapons in spite of their adherence to international agreements and treaties 
forbidding such actions, and nonstate groups may not consider themselves bound by such agreements and 
treaties. State and nonstate actors may have incentives to operate outside the norms of acceptable 
international behavior, especially when important interests are involved.  
1-12. There are no official definitions for state and nonstate actors. However, a state actor can be described 
as a person or persons who are acting on behalf of a governmental body. Nonstate actors are individuals or 
groups on the international level who are not governmental representatives; they may reside within a 
governing state, but they are not recognized by the state. Examples of state and nonstate actors are shown 
below: 
 
State actors. 
 
United States. 
 
Germany. 
 
Argentina. 
 
Nonstate actors. 
 
Terrorist organizations (such as al-Qaida). 
 
Militias. 
 
Warlords. 
 
Rebel opposition forces. 
 
Drug cartels. 
 
Criminals. 
 
Nongovernmental organizations (as part of civil society and generally harmless, but having 
internal governing powers). 
1-13. Key states may assist rogue nations who are attempting to acquire the ability to proliferate WMD 
through materials, technology, and expertise. However, individuals may also contribute illicitly to the 
proliferation efforts, despite a state’s disapproval or lack of knowledge of such actions occurring; for 
example, the actions of Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. The following vignette demonstrates how 
networking across borders (possibly without government knowledge) and operating through black markets 
have placed nuclear materials and technology into the hands of adversaries who will attempt to threaten the 
United States and its allies if their nuclear program becomes weaponized.

1-5 
1-14. Identifying the potential threats of state and nonstate actors is a continual challenge for the United 
States and its allies, given the elusive nature of adversaries and the ever-increasing speed of global 
communications, adversarial adaptability, enhanced networking, and intelligence resources.  
TERRORISTS 
1-15. The term terrorism is defined in JP 1-02 as the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of 
unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the 
pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological. A critical factor in the understanding 
of terrorism is the importance of the emotional impact of the terrorist act on an audience other than the 
victim. 
1-16. The National Security Strategy of the United States of America (more commonly known as the 
National Security Strategy) highlights the threat from adversaries possessing WMD. It emphasizes the need 
to be “prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use WMD 
against the United States and our allies and friends” and discusses preemptive options against such 
adversaries. 
1-17. The National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction asserts, “We will not permit the 
world’s most dangerous regimes and terrorists to threaten us with the world’s most destructive weapons. 
We must accord the highest priority to the protection of the United States, our forces, and our friends and 
allies from the existing and growing WMD threat.” Protection is the preservation of the effectiveness and 
survivability of mission-related military and nonmilitary personnel, equipment, facilities, information, and 
infrastructure deployed or located within or outside the boundaries of a given operational area. 
1-18. A terrorist group’s selection of targets and tactics is a function of the group’s affiliation, level of 
training, organization, and sophistication. Security forces generally categorize terrorist groups according to 
their operational traditions: 
 
National. National groups operate within the boundaries of a single nation. 
 
Transnational. Transnational groups operate across international borders. 
A.Q. Khan Proliferation Network 
The Khan network was, first and foremost, an elaborate and highly successful illicit procurement network 
that Khan created in the 1970s to supply Pakistan’s gas centrifuge program. The developing program aimed 
to make highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. He built his centrifuge procurement network on an 
extensive collection of sensitive information that he stole or otherwise acquired in Europe in the middle and 
late 1970s. In addition, he was involved in acquiring overseas nuclear weapon technology for Pakistan and 
procuring equipment and materials for this endeavor. 
Because of Pakistan’s weak industrial infrastructure, it was unable to develop gas centrifuges or nuclear 
weapons without extensive foreign assistance. Khan relied on the support of many foreign businessmen and 
experts and on the supply of goods and technologies from foreign countries, especially Europe. Pakistan’s 
nuclear weapons program still depends on the foreign supply of spare parts, special materials, and 
instruments. 
Khan and his associates slowly expanded their import operation into a transnational illegal network that 
exported (mostly to Muslim countries) whole gas centrifuges, production capabilities, and designs for nuclear 
weapons. By the late 1990s, the Khan network had evolved into an organization that could provide “one stop 
shopping” for the wherewithal to produce weapons grade uranium and for nuclear weapon designs and 
instructions. The motive was to turn a profit while providing additional business for their international 
collaborators. In addition to money, Khan was also motivated by pan-Islamism and its hostility to Western 
controls on nuclear technology. 
Khan has admitted that his main customers were Iran, Libya, and North Korea. Reports indicate that other 
countries (including Egypt, Iraq, and Syria) were offered assistance, but they purportedly turned down the 
offers. However, investigators are still trying to verify these claims and determine exactly what assistance 
each country accepted or refused. In addition, questions remain as to whether members of the Khan 
network, including Khan himself, offered nuclear weapon assistance to terrorists in Afghanistan prior to the 
fall of the Taliban.

 
International. International groups operate in two or more nations and are usually assumed to 
receive direction and support from a foreign government. 
INCIDENTS 
1-19. A CBRN incident is any occurrence involving the emergence of CBRN hazards resulting from the 
use of CBRN weapons or devices, the emergence of secondary hazards arising from counterforce targeting, 
or the release of toxic industrial material into the environment. A CBRN incident is characterized on the 
basis of the intent, opportunity, and capability of the occurrence. There are three basic reasons why a 
CBRN incident happens, regardless of the type and nature: 
 
Intentional. An intentional CBRN incident may include— 
 
Criminal acts such as the deliberate dumping or release of hazmat to avoid regulatory 
requirements.  
 
Malicious acts such as the poisoning of one or more individuals.  
 
Terrorist acts that involve serious violence to persons or property for a political, religious, or 
ideological purpose and/or that are a matter of national interest. 
 
Accidental. An accidental CBRN incident is an event caused by human error or natural or 
technological reasons. Accidental incidents are usually referred to as hazmat accidents and may 
include— 
 
Spills. 
 
Releases. 
 
Leakages. 
 
Natural. A natural CBRN incident is a second- or third-order effect from a natural disaster. 
Examples include— 
 
Toxic chemical release. 
 
Biological waste. 
1-20.  Intent is the distinguishing difference between the three reasons that CBRN incidents happen. To 
ensure proper assessment when filtering through the information pertaining to an incident, it is important to 
know the intent category.  
Note. A CBRN weapon is a fully engineered assembly that is designed for employment to cause 
the release of a chemical or biological agent or radiological material onto a chosen target or to 
generate a nuclear detonation.  
HAZARDS 
1-21. CBRN elements that could cause an adverse effect through accidental or deliberate release, 
dissemination, or impacts are called CBRN hazards. CBRN hazards are often present in conjunction with 
the incident effects of a WMD device.  
1-22. CBRN hazards include those created from accidental or intentional releases of toxic industrial 
materials, biological pathogens, and radioactive matter. Toxic industrial material is a generic term for toxic 
or radioactive substances in solid, liquid, aerosolized, or gaseous form that may be used or stored for 
industrial, commercial, medical, military, or domestic purposes. Toxic industrial material may be chemical, 
biological, or radiological and are described as toxic industrial chemicals, toxic industrial biologicals, or 
toxic industrial radiologicals. Figure 1-2 shows the sources of CBRN hazards.

1 July 2011 
FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42 
1-7 
1-23. CBRN hazards may result from WMD employment. The key distinction between WMD and CBRN 
hazards is that WMD refers to the actual weapon, while CBRN refers to the contamination or effects 
resulting from the employment of WMD and from the dispersal of CBRN materials. When DOD 
capabilities are called upon to conduct WMD consequence management activities, they will essentially be 
responding to CBRN hazards or contamination, such as—  
 
The deposit, absorption, or adsorption of radioactive material or a biological or chemical agent 
on or near a structure, area, person, or object. 
 
Food and/or water that is unfit for consumption by humans or animals due to the presence of 
environmental chemicals, radioactive elements, bacteria or organisms, the byproduct of the 
growth of bacteria or organisms, decomposing material (includes the food substance itself), or 
waste in the food or water.  
CHEMICAL HAZARDS 
1-24. Historically, chemical hazards of military concern were limited to a small group of uniquely 
manufactured chemical weapons referred to as chemical warfare agents. However, the types of chemical 
hazards of concern to the military have expanded tremendously over the last decade and now include a 
large number of toxic industrial chemicals. Chemical hazards are any chemicals (manufactured, used, 
transported, or stored) that can cause death or other harm through the toxic properties of those materials. 
This includes chemical weapons (prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention), chemical agents, 
and toxic industrial chemicals.

1 July 2011 
Chemical Weapons 
1-25. Together or separately, chemical weapons include― 
 
A toxic chemical and its precursors, except when intended for a purpose not prohibited under the 
Chemical Weapons Convention.  
 
A munition or device, specifically designed to cause death or other harm through the toxic 
properties of the above chemicals, which would be released as a result of the employment of 
such munition or device.  
 
Any equipment specifically designed for use directly in connection with the employment of 
munitions or devices specified above. 
Chemical Agents 
1-26. A chemical agent is a chemical substance that is intended for use in military operations to kill, 
seriously injure, or incapacitate, mainly through physiological effects. The term excludes riot control agents 
when used for law enforcement purposes, herbicides, smoke, and flame. Chemical agents are classified 
according to— 
 
Physical state. Agents may exist as a solid, liquid, or vapor.  
 
Physiological action. According to their physiological effects, there are nerve, blood, blister, 
choking, and incapacitating agents. (See Appendix A for detailed information.) 
 
Use. The terms persistent and nonpersistent describe the time an agent stays in an area. An 
adversary may have to expend large quantities of chemical agents in order to cause mass 
casualties or achieve area denial. 
 
Persistent agent. A chemical agent that, when released, can cause casualties for more than 
24 hours to several days or weeks. 
 
Nonpersistent agent. A chemical agent that, when released, dissipates and/or loses its 
ability to cause casualties after 10 to 15 minutes. 
Toxic Industrial Chemicals 
1-27. Toxic industrial chemicals are chemicals that are developed or manufactured for use in industrial 
operations or research by industry, government, or academia. Examples include pesticides, petrochemicals, 
fertilizers, corrosives, explosives, and poisons. These chemicals are not primarily manufactured for the 
specific purpose of producing human casualties or rendering equipment, facilities, or areas dangerous for 
human use. For example, hydrogen cyanide, cyanogen chloride, phosgene, and chloropicrin are industrial 
chemicals that can also be military chemical agents.  
1-28. Toxic industrial chemicals can pose significant toxic hazards and can damage the human body and 
equipment. Many industrial chemicals are corrosive, flammable, explosive, or combustible; these hazards 
may pose greater short-term challenges than the immediate toxic effects. Most toxic industrial chemicals 
will be released as vapor or highly volatile liquid and can have short- and long-term health effects. The 
release of large volumes of hazardous industrial chemicals can also produce environmental damage. 
Other Sources 
1-29. Riot control agents, herbicides, and substances that generate smoke and flame are excluded from 
classification contained in the Chemical Weapons Convention and when used for law enforcement 
purposes. (See Appendix A for more details on riot control agents and herbicides.) Defoliants are chemicals 
that are sprayed or dusted onto plants, causing the leaves to fall off prematurely. Unlike herbicides, 
defoliants do not totally destroy plants.

1-9 
BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS 
1-30. Biological hazards pose unique challenges because they are relatively easy to produce and difficult to 
detect; their production facilities have no unique signature. A biological hazard is an organism or substance 
derived from an organism that poses a threat to human or animal health. This can include medical waste or 
samples of a microorganism, virus, or toxin (from a biological source) that can impact human health.  
Biological Weapons 
1-31. A biological weapon projects, disperses, or disseminates a biological agent, including arthropod 
vectors. Militarily significant characteristics for biological aspects of operations in CBRN environments 
include a normally vulnerable target population, infectious or toxic agents with highly lethal or 
incapacitating properties, agent availability or adaptability for scaled-up production, agent stability, and 
agent suitability for aerosol dispersion. Limiting factors include biological properties (particularly rapid 
decay), environmental factors, and dissemination methods. 
Biological Agents 
1-32. A biological agent is a microorganism that causes disease in people, plants, or animals or causes the 
deterioration of materiel. Biological agents are microorganisms that are capable of spreading disease 
through humans and agriculture. They are categorized as— 
 
Pathogens. Pathogens are disease-producing microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, rickettsia) 
that directly attack human, plant, or animal tissue and biological processes. 
 
Toxins. Toxins are poisonous substances that are produced naturally (bacteria, plants, fungi, 
snakes, insects, and other living organisms), but may also be produced synthetically. Naturally 
occurring toxins are nonliving byproducts of cellular processes that can be lethal or highly 
incapacitating.  
1-33. Biological agents pose a singular threat due to five factors:  
 
Small doses can produce lethal or incapacitating effects over an extensive area. 
 
They are difficult to detect in a timely manner. 
 
They are easy to conceal. 
 
They can be covertly deployed. 
 
The variety of potential biological agents significantly complicates effective preventative or 
protective treatment.  
These factors—combined with small employment signatures; delayed onset of symptoms; detection, 
identification, and verification difficulties; agent persistence; and communicability—can confer 
important advantages to adversaries who use biological agents. 
1-34. Toxic industrial biologicals include any biological material manufactured, used, transported, or 
stored for industrial, medical, or commercial processes that could pose an infectious or toxic threat. The 
release of toxic industrial biological hazards can occur following an incident, attack, or damage at a facility 
that handles, produces, stores, or recycles biological material. Examples include hospitals, medical 
facilities, agricultural facilities, and facilities that recycle biological materials for medical, pharmaceutical, 
or agricultural industries.  
Other Sources 
1-35. Other biological-related hazards are pandemics and naturally occurring diseases. Pandemics may 
include Ebola and West Nile viruses or diseases that are widespread and associated with affecting a large 
portion of the population within a geographic region.  
RADIOLOGICAL HAZARDS 
1-36. Radiological hazards are an emerging threat to U.S. military operations. These hazards can arise from 
many sources other than nuclear weapons and can be dispersed in a variety of ways.  
Chapter 1 
1-10 
FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42 
1 July 2011 
1-37. Radiological hazards include any electromagnetic or particulate radiation that is capable of producing 
ions to cause damage, injury, or destruction. Radiological material causes physiological damage through 
the ionizing effects of neutron, gamma, beta, or alpha radiation. These types of radiation are referred to as 
ionizing radiation. Radiological materials can be found in a number of military and civilian environments 
(nuclear power plants, hospitals, universities, construction sites).  
Note. For the purpose of this publication, the term radiation denotes ionizing radiation unless 
otherwise stated. 
1-38. Radiological hazards also include toxic industrial radiologicals (radiological material that is 
manufactured, used, transported, or stored for industrial, medical, or commercial processes). Possible 
sources of toxic industrial radiologicals that are capable of producing radioactive hazards are civil nuclear 
production, research, recycling, and storage facilities; nuclear waste containment sites; industrial and 
medical nuclear sources; nuclear materials and sources in transit; stolen or smuggled nuclear weapons 
grade material; medical and fossil fuel manufacturing and waste processing plants; and other industrial 
sources. 
1-39. Adversaries could disperse radioactive material in a number of ways, such as arming the warhead of 
a missile with radioactive material from a nuclear reactor, releasing low-level radioactive material intended 
for use in industry or medicine, or disseminating material from a research or power-generating nuclear 
reactor. Unless radioactive sources are thoroughly shielded, improvised devices employing these materials 
will more than likely have a significant radiological signature that can be detected before detonation, 
dispersal, or deployment. The dispersal of radioactive material represents an inexpensive capability that 
requires limited resources and technical knowledge. 
Radiological Dispersal Device 
1-40. A radiological dispersal device is an improvised assembly or process, other than a nuclear explosive 
device, that is designed to disseminate radioactive material in order to cause destruction, damage, or injury. 
Radiological Exposure Device 
1-41. A radiological exposure device is a radioactive source that is placed to cause injury or death. A 
radiological exposure device that remains undetected may increase the potential dose to the intended target. 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND EFFECTS 
1-42. A nuclear weapon refers to a complete assembly (implosion, gun, or thermonuclear) in its intended 
ultimate configuration. Upon completion of the prescribed arming, fusing, and firing sequence, a nuclear 
weapon is capable of producing the intended nuclear reaction and energy release. With regard to the risk of 
proliferation and use by terrorists, the gun type weapon is a relatively simple design and is a concern 
because it does not require as much fine engineering or manufacturing as the other methods. With enough 
highly enriched uranium, nations or groups with relatively low levels of technological sophistication could 
create an inefficient, though still quite powerful, nuclear weapon. A nuclear weapon can be detonated in 
space, in the atmosphere above the earth’s surface, on the surface, or below the surface. The data in this 
chapter focuses on air bursts. When the detonation occurs in the atmosphere, the primary radiation products 
(X-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons) interact with the surrounding air molecules and are absorbed and 
scattered as they radiate from the point of detonation.

1-11 
1-43. Nuclear weapon effects are qualitatively different from biological or chemical weapon effects. The 
nature and intensity of nuclear detonation effects are determined by the type of weapon, its yield, and the 
physical medium in which the detonation occurs. Some characteristics of nuclear weapon effects include— 
 
The distribution of energy and the relative effects of blast, heat, and radiation depend largely on 
the weapon, the altitude at which it is detonated, and features of the target.  
 
A typical nuclear weapon releases most of its energy as thermally generated X-rays at the point 
of detonation. 
 
The amount of fallout depends on the weapon yield, weapon type, and height of burst. 
 
The area affected depends heavily on the wind.  
 
Surface bursts produce the most fallout. 
 
The hazard to personnel depends on the level of radiation present and the duration of exposure. 
 
Weather conditions affect fallout immensely. 
1-44. The effects of nuclear detonations include— 
 
Blast and shock. The blast produces shock waves, high overpressures, and severe winds. 
Personnel suffering critical injuries from blast and shock effects would likely suffer lethal 
radiation exposure as well. 
 
Thermal radiation. Thermal radiation is the heat and light produced by a nuclear explosion. It 
can cause burns over substantial distances. Secondary fires from blast and heat are additional 
hazards. Thermal effects can also disrupt operation plans due to fire and melting snow and ice 
impeding movement.  
 
Electromagnetic pulse. The interaction of gamma radiation with the atmosphere can cause a 
short pulse of electric and magnetic fields that may damage and interfere with the operation of 
electrical and electronic equipment and can cause widespread disruption. The effects of 
electromagnetic pulse can extend to hundreds of kilometers, depending on the height and 
strength of the nuclear burst. High-altitude, electromagnetic pulse can generate significant 
disruptive field strengths over a continental-size area. The portion of the frequency spectrum 
most affected by electromagnetic pulse and high-altitude, electromagnetic pulse is the 
communications band. 
 
Transient radiation. These effects are generally short-lived and can be extremely hazardous to 
aircraft and other electronically dense pieces of equipment. 
 
Ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation includes particulate (alpha, beta, and neutron) and 
electromagnetic (X-ray and gamma) radiation of sufficient energy to displace electrons from 
atoms, producing ions. The initial radiation is a significant threat to personnel and materiel, 
including optical, mechanical, and electronic components. Gamma rays and neutrons have a long 
range in the air and are highly penetrating. Alpha and beta radiation may cause a hazard to 
personnel following a nuclear detonation. 
 
Potassium iodine. Potassium iodine may be used to protect the thyroid from radioactive iodine 
in the event of an accident or attack at a nuclear power plant or another nuclear attack, especially 
where volatile radionuclides (which contain significant amounts of iodine 131) are released into 
the environment. Radioiodine is a dangerous radionuclide because the body concentrates it in the 
thyroid gland. Potassium iodine cannot protect against other causes of radiation poisoning or 
provide protection against a dirty bomb unless it contains radioactive iodine. 
 
Fallout. In addition to the initial thermal and ionizing radiation and electromagnetic pulse, a 
nuclear detonation produces residual radiation that results from the dispersal of radioactive 
materials in the target area and downwind. Fallout may be a lingering, widespread hazard that 
severely limits military operations in the contaminated area. (See Appendix A for further 
details.)

SUMMARY 
1-45. Depending on the adversary’s specific objectives, widespread or limited methods may be used to 
create CBRN hazards. These hazards present physical and psychological effects well beyond the immediate 
target area. The preceding subparagraphs described the characteristics and effects of CBRN hazards and 
selected toxic materials. Appendix A provides additional information on CBRN hazard considerations.

Chapter 2 
U.S. Policy and Strategy  
This chapter briefly discusses policies and strategies that seek to prevent and limit the 
proliferation of CBRN capabilities through international agreements and treaties, 
multilateral initiatives, and unilateral actions in which the DOD plays a significant 
role. This chapter also provides an overview of military objectives that support the 
U.S. government’s political, economic, and diplomatic efforts to carry out the three 
strategic pillars of CWMD (nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and WMD 
consequence management) as highlighted in the National Security Strategy: 
 
Nonproliferation. Actions taken to prevent the proliferation of WMD by 
dissuading or impeding access to, or distribution of, sensitive technologies, 
material, and expertise. 
 
Counterproliferation. Actions taken to defeat the threat and/or use of WMD 
against the United States and its forces, allies, and partners. 
 
Consequence management. Actions authorized by the President of the 
United States or the Secretary of Defense to mitigate the effects of a WMD 
attack or event and provide temporary essential operations and services at 
home and abroad. 
OVERVIEW 
2-1. The deadly, destructive, and disruptive effects of CBRN weapons pose serious challenges to U.S. 
military operations worldwide and merit continuous consideration by commanders. Conflict situations may 
emerge in the international security environment to challenge U.S. interests. Additionally, commanders 
should be aware that interagency and international considerations dealing with WMD may outweigh 
military considerations and that they may be assigned to support an interagency or international CWMD 
operation, even during a major contingency. 
2-2. National strategic objectives and tactical actions are not unique or different for CWMD. In 
operations involving WMD, action or inaction at the tactical level can have profound strategic 
repercussions. While there has been greatly increased emphasis on WMD and CWMD, it is important for 
commanders and planners to understand that WMD is not an adversary. It is a capability that an adversary 
may use to coerce or deter actions or to achieve effects during operations. Thus, CWMD operations should 
not be considered a special or distinct set of activities or a separate mission area to be used only under 
certain conditions. Rather, commanders must consider CBRN operations as part of their operational 
planning.  
2-3. CBRN operations involve the employment of tactical capabilities that counter the entire range of 
CBRN threats and hazards through WMD proliferation prevention, WMD counterforce, CBRN defense, 
and CBRN consequence management activities in support of operational and strategic objectives to combat 
WMD and operate safely in CBRN environments.

POLICY 
2-4. Current U.S. policy is to deter enemy CBRN use through a strong nuclear force in tandem with 
conventional capabilities that include WMD proliferation prevention, WMD counterforce, CBRN defense, 
and CBRN consequence management to enable U.S. forces to survive, fight, and win in a CBRN 
environment. Prevention efforts must be global, regional, and country-specific and directed at—  
 
Shaping international opinion on WMD. 
 
Stigmatizing proliferation.  
 
Influencing the decisions of those seeking, possessing, or supplying WMD.  
 
Minimizing or eliminating associated CBRN threats and hazards.  
 
Closing proliferation pathways.  
2-5. Military activities must be closely integrated with supporting interagency efforts. Security 
cooperation is often vitally important in shaping proliferation incentives and fostering cooperation in 
prevention efforts to dissuade or prevent state and nonstate actors from acquiring or proliferating WMD 
and to deny them access to WMD-relevant capabilities. 
2-6. U.S. policies and strategies aim to prevent and limit the proliferation of CBRN capabilities through 
deterrence. If deterrence fails, the United States will pursue war to a successful conclusion.  
2-7. The United States may use nuclear weapons to terminate a conflict or war at the lowest acceptable 
level of hostilities. The employment of nuclear weapons by the United States is governed by guidance to 
the joint force commander as contained in strategic-level directives. The United States is party to treaties 
and international agreements that limit proliferation, testing, and possession of nuclear weapons.  
2-8. The United States will never use chemical weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention (ratified by 
the United States on 29 April 1997) bans the acquisition, development, production, retention, stockpiling, 
transfer, and use of chemical weapons.  
2-9. The United States will never use biological weapons. Under the terms of the Biological and Toxin 
Weapons Convention (more commonly known as the Biological Weapons Convention), which was ratified 
by the United States on 26 March 1975, parties agreed not to develop, produce, stockpile, or acquire 
biological agents or toxins of types and in quantities that have no justification other than for prophylactic, 
protective, or other peaceful purposes.  
2-10. The United States does not consider herbicides and riot control agents to be chemical agents, but has 
adopted policies concerning their use during an armed conflict. The use of herbicides and riot control 
agents is covered by different policies than those governing chemical warfare agents. Executive Order 
Number 11850 renounces the first use of herbicides in war (except for specified defensive use) and the first 
use of riot control agents in war (except for defensive military modes to save lives).  
Note. See Appendix B for more information on treaties and agreements. 
NATIONAL STRATEGIES 
2-11. This keystone publication links multi-Service CBRN doctrine to national strategies. National 
strategies are documents that are periodically prepared for Congress by the Executive Branch. National 
strategies outline the major national security concerns of the United States and summarize how the 
administration plans to deal with them.  
2-12. The National Security Strategy identifies “preventing our enemies from threatening us, our allies, 
and our friends with WMD” as an essential task for ensuring national security. To achieve this goal, the 
National Security Strategy sets forth an active strategy to counter transnational terror networks, rogue 
nations, and aggressive states that possess, or are working to acquire, WMD. It notes that the United States 
must advance this strategy through strengthened alliances, the establishment of new partnerships, the 
innovative use of military forces, modern technologies, and increased emphasis on intelligence collection 
and analysis. The National Security Strategy highlights nonproliferation concerns in its examination of the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (more commonly known as the Nuclear 
U.S. Policy and Strategy

Nonproliferation Treaty) and its special emphasis on stemming the spread of materials necessary to 
develop WMD. Counterproliferation activities are included in the National Security Strategy’s focus for 
disrupting terrorist networks who are seeking to use WMD against U.S. interests. Figure 2-1 outlines the 
hierarchy of national strategies to DOD planning constructs. 
2-13. The National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction builds on the National Security 
Strategy; articulates a proactive, comprehensive strategy; and guides all U.S. Government activities to 
combat WMD. It states that nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons in the possession of hostile states 
and terrorists represent one of the greatest security challenges facing the United States and that we must 
pursue a comprehensive strategy to counter this threat in all of its dimensions. The National Strategy to 
Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction is built on three principal pillars:  
 
Strengthened nonproliferation to combat WMD proliferation. 
 
Counterproliferation to combat WMD use. 
 
Consequence management to restore essential operations and services at home and abroad after 
WMD use.

2-14. These pillars form a common framework for the interagency conduct of CWMD activities that 
support the critical enabling functions of improved intelligence collection and analysis, research and 
development, strengthened international cooperation, and targeted strategies against proliferants while 
providing a strategic foundation for military operations.  
2-15. The National Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction defines military strategic 
objectives and the means to achieve them through the eight mission areas that are conducted across the 
CWMD continuum. The National Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction supports the 
National Security Strategy by applying the missions across the four pillars to achieve military strategic 
objectives and accomplish the DOD mission to dissuade, deter, defend against, and defeat those who seek 
to harm the United States, its allies, and its partners through WMD use (see figure 2-2). The pillars are— 
 
Defeat and deter WMD use and subsequent use. Adversaries must believe that they will 
suffer severe consequences and that their objectives will be denied if they threaten or resort to 
the use of WMD.  
 
Defend, respond, and recover from WMD use. The purpose of this objective is to respond to 
an adversary who has used WMD on the battlefield or against strategic U.S. interests. To defend 
and recover from WMD use, U.S. armed forces will execute passive defense measures and be 
prepared to conduct WMD consequence management activities.  
 
Prevent, dissuade, or deny WMD proliferation or possession. To prevent, dissuade, or deny 
adversaries or potential adversaries from possessing or proliferating WMD, U.S. armed forces 
will be prepared to conduct offensive operations. The military must also support interdiction 
efforts, security cooperation, and nonproliferation efforts.  
 
Reduce, destroy, or reverse WMD possession. To reverse WMD programs and reduce WMD 
and related material stockpiles, the U.S. armed forces will support threat reduction cooperation 
and be prepared to assist in cooperative stockpile destruction activities.

Note. The military activities associated with each of the pillars are discussed in more detail in 
Chapters 3 through 5.  
STRATEGIC CONTEXT 
2-16. Historically, WMD have been used when conventional munitions were unable to provide the 
necessary advantage to one side or the other. The use of WMD requires the capability and the political will 
to use them. For a nation, that decision has high potential for significant retribution. WMD in the hands of 
an adversary poses a grave danger to the United States, at home and abroad. 
2-17. Today, we describe the employment of WMD as an asymmetrical approach used by hostile state and 
nonstate actors to counter the qualitative superiority of the U.S. military. The events of 11 September 2001 
heightened the concern of DOD leaders for the increased threat of terrorists and rogue nations employing 
WMD. They recognize the need to integrate CWMD into DOD planning frameworks to ensure more 
effective command and control (C2), problem solving, and capabilities-based planning. 
2-18. One of the most difficult challenges that we face is to prevent, deter, and defend against the 
acquisition and use of WMD by terrorist groups. The strategic military framework to combat WMD 
consists of ends (the military strategic goal and associated end state), ways (military strategic objectives), 
and means (combatant commands, military departments, and support agencies) applied across the pillars of 
the National Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction. Forces adapt to the requirements 
of the operational environment and conduct operations within it by using synchronized action, joint

interdependent capabilities, and mission command. The pillars do not stand alone, but rather come together 
as seamless elements of a comprehensive approach. Underlining that point, figure 2-3 outlines how the 
National Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction identified four cross-cutting, critical 
enabling functions (improved intelligence collection and analysis, research and development, strengthened 
international cooperation, and targeted strategies against proliferants) that are critical to integrating the 
three pillars of CWMD (nonproliferation, proliferation, and consequence management).  
2-19. The following are some strategic issues: 
 
The proliferation of WMD is a global problem that routinely crosses the regional boundaries of 
combatant commands. 
 
The increasing availability of highly destructive technology, combined with a variety of 
weapons and means of delivery from state and nonstate actors will challenge military operations 
in the future. 
 
An adversary’s threat or use of WMD will be a likely condition of war, and the proliferation of 
WMD programs will continue to challenge commanders at all levels. 
 
WMD programs have the potential to severely disrupt and damage the United States; its forces, 
allies, and coalition partners; and civilian populations. 
 
Future adversaries may use WMD to inflict casualties on civilian populations, degrade military 
effectiveness, or counter U.S. conventional military superiority. Current and future adversaries 
are state and nonstate actors. 
 
The nature of the War on Terrorism and the operational realities of terrorist threats mean that the 
military aspects of the operational environment will be less distinctly defined than in operational 
environments for other types of operations. 
OPERATIONAL CONTEXT 
2-20. The DOD CBRN mission has expanded to address the immense complexities of the strategic context 
in which we would perform CWMD missions. The war against those adversaries who would use CBRN 
weapons to inflict massive harm on the United States and its military forces and international allies is a 
protracted fight that will require a strategic offensive.

2-21. Commanders should harness all capabilities (including those related to information operation 
capabilities [public affairs, defense support to public diplomacy, civil-military operations], military 
diplomacy, and interagency coordination) to implement a synergistic operational CWMD effort.  
2-22. Effective operational CWMD capabilities will ensure maximum impact on the adversary’s selection 
of CBRN targets, capitalize on CBRN intelligence, and exploit enemy intent. 
2-23. The geographic combatant commanders’ comprehensive joint, interagency, and host nation efforts in 
support of sustained CWMD operations should include innovative methods of coordination to effectively 
deal with the complexities of interdependence. Cohesive operations conducted within the framework of 
U.S. policy and strategies for CWMD and associated CBRN threats and hazards will ensure that members 
of the U.S. military are able to operate as a single team and, ultimately, defeat the efforts of our enemies.  
2-24. Support to joint force commanders is based on the following tenets: 
 
Clearly identified supporting and supported combatant commander roles facilitate the effective 
interface with the interagency community which is required for operational planning efforts that 
will reduce vulnerability and minimize the effects of WMD employed against key host nation 
installations; U.S. installations and facilities; ports of embarkation and debarkation; and the 
United States and its military forces and international allies. 
 
Lethal/nonlethal efforts to eliminate the WMD threat, deter the use of WMD and, when 
necessary, respond to the use of WMD are largely the domain of DOD. In the CWMD context, 
force applications (from conventional to nuclear and from nonlethal to special operations) are 
within the operations span of several different DOD communities that have responsibilities and 
activities relevant to the mission areas.  
 
WMD counterforce operations require specialized capabilities to defeat WMD targets; therefore, 
operational concepts must rely heavily on precise, persistent, and timely intelligence to locate 
and identify targets, understand the characteristics of the effects of CBRN threats and hazards on 
structures, optimize munitions delivery to minimize collateral effects, and assess combat 
effectiveness.  
 
Lead combatant commanders, in conjunction with other key stakeholders, must think and plan 
strategically to promulgate measures that must be taken to prevent the conventional and 
unconventional delivery of WMD. These measures include the detection, diversion, and 
destruction of adversary WMD and delivery systems while en route to their targets.  
 
The role of nonlethal and special operations force capabilities must be synchronized with 
combatant command plans related to CWMD. 
2-25. The joint force commander does not execute military operations in isolation. Unified action requires 
the synchronization, coordination, and/or integration of government activities (U.S. Government, allied, 
and partner) and nongovernment entities with military operations. The joint force commander employs 
resources through the layered and integrated execution of eight military mission areas to influence the 
decisions of WMD actors, allies, and partners; to defeat and deter actions of multiple networks of WMD 
actors; and to mitigate the effects of WMD employment (see figure 2-4). The joint force commander directs 
actions at critical vulnerabilities (tangible and intangible) within the WMD network, combining direct and 
indirect effects to render the network incapable or unwilling to perform its WMD-enabling function. As the 
campaign progresses, the joint force commander must be prepared to execute other branches of strategy as 
the WMD actor takes unexpected actions or makes unanticipated advances in capability development and 
employment.

FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42

2-26. CWMD operational objectives require synchronization between the three strategic pillars in the form 
of eight military mission areas defined below. JP 3-40 establishes doctrine for the integration of the eight 
military mission areas and the National Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction. 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION SECURITY COOPERATION AND PARTNER ACTIVITIES 
2-27. WMD security cooperation and partner activities improve partner and allied capacity to combat 
WMD across the eight mission areas through military-to-military contact, burden sharing arrangements, 
combined military activities, and support to international activities. These operations support international 
efforts and promote improved partnership capacity to combat WMD. Activities include support to treaties 
and agreements, support to operations and exercises intended to foster capability development, common 
threat awareness, coalition building, and interoperability. They may be military-led or in support to DOD or 
other government agencies. These activities also influence adversary decisions through the demonstration 
of U.S. and partner capabilities to impose cost or deny benefits of WMD development or use. WMD 
security cooperation and partner activities are conducted in a permissive environment. 
THREAT REDUCTION COOPERATION 
2-28. Threat reduction cooperation activities are undertaken with the consent and cooperation of host 
nation authorities to enhance physical security and to reduce, dismantle, redirect, and/or improve the 
protection of a state’s existing WMD program, stockpiles, and capabilities. This military mission area is the 
desired successor to the integrated application of other military mission areas that cause WMD actors to 
renounce WMD. Although not a primary combatant commander responsibility, these activities impact other 
combatant command operations; and combatant commanders must maintain visibility that is consistent

with these efforts. In some cases, the joint force commander may provide some politico-military support to 
reduce threat operations that will unequivocally eliminate the WMD networks and programs. For example, 
the WMD actor may require assistance in securing infrastructure, delivery means, or WMD-related 
material. The joint force commander might also provide arms control support or support to remove this 
material to isolate the targeted WMD program and ensure that the actor does not resurrect it. This task is 
primarily strategic in nature and may include tasks such as inspections, monitoring, verification, and 
enforcement support for treaties. Threat reduction cooperation activities are conducted in a permissive 
environment. 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION INTERDICTION 
2-29. WMD interdiction operations track, intercept, search, divert, seize, or otherwise stop the transit of 
WMD, its delivery systems, or related materials, technologies, and expertise. If shaping and deterrence 
operations are not successful in influencing adversaries to stop proliferating, the President or the Secretary 
of Defense may direct the joint force commander to employ or support WMD counterforce operations to 
stop the transit of WMD materiel, expertise, or enabling resources and to delay WMD development. The 
joint force commander may attack operational targets (using lethal means) or conduct engagements on 
operational targets using nonlethal means. This interdiction will likely be nonlethal and may be executed by 
someone other than the joint force. As the WMD actor comes closer to obtaining a WMD employment 
capability, many nonlethal capabilities will be less effective and lethal interdiction by the joint force is 
much more likely. If such interdiction results in the seizure of WMD or related material, interdiction may 
require the joint force commander to reduce the threat by securing and removing (neutralize or transport) 
WMD and related material. If a CBRN hazard occurs as a result of an accidental release in a permissive or 
uncertain operational environment, it may be necessary for the joint force commander to execute 
consequence management operations. Interdiction operations increase the cost and time of WMD 
acquisition and proliferation to the actor.  
Note. See Chapter 4 for more information on WMD counterforce operations. 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS 
2-30. WMD offensive operations disrupt, neutralize, or destroy a WMD threat before it can be used or 
deter the subsequent use of WMD. In hostile or uncertain environments where interdiction efforts have not 
been successful in halting rogue behavior, the President or the Secretary of Defense may direct the joint 
force commander to execute WMD counterforce operations to destroy the WMD network’s ability to 
produce, deploy, or employ WMD. Offensive operations are military-led and may be lethal and/or 
nonlethal operations. They encompass the detection, identification, disruption, and destruction of an 
adversary’s WMD assets, delivery means, associated facilities, and other high-value targets. If an adversary 
attempts to use WMD, offensive operations may help disrupt and weaken the attack, thereby increasing the 
effectiveness of other complementary elements of CMWD such as active and passive defense measures and 
consequence management. These operations impose substantial cost upon the WMD actor. For nonstate 
actors with smaller, more centralized WMD production capabilities, offensive operations may result in 
complete destruction of the program. Offensive operations taken against a WMD program, production, or 
platform require reliable credible intelligence. 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION ELIMINATION 
2-31. WMD elimination operations are undertaken in a hostile or uncertain environment to systematically 
locate, characterize, secure, disable, or destroy WMD programs and related capabilities. Elimination 
operations employ many of the same WMD counterforce operation capabilities as offensive operations to 
reduce the immediate threat and to lay the groundwork to transition the long-term destruction, redirection, 
and monitoring activities of any remaining elements of the WMD program to the threat reduction 
cooperation military mission area. These operations also seek to locate and secure key personnel in the 
program. Since elimination requires some U.S. physical control of the infrastructure to establish attribution, 
the joint force commander must provide passive defense for executing force elements. The joint force 
Chapter 2

commander also provides arms control support to unified action to isolate the targeted WMD program and 
ensure that the actor does not resurrect it.  
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION ACTIVE DEFENSE 
2-32. WMD active defense measures defeat an attack with CBRN weapons by employing actions to divert, 
neutralize, or destroy them or their means of delivery while en route to their target. Throughout the 
campaign, the joint force commander also employs active defense capabilities. These are military-led 
activities to defend against conventionally and unconventionally delivered WMD. Initially, these 
capabilities present benefit denial aspects to the WMD actor and can influence decisions to pursue or 
employ WMD. These capabilities also represent benefits to allies and partners and can influence their 
support. 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION PASSIVE DEFENSE 
2-33. WMD passive defense measures minimize or negate the vulnerability to, and effects of, CBRN 
attacks. This mission area focuses on maintaining joint force ability to continue military operations in a 
CBRN environment. Throughout the campaign, the joint force commander employs passive defense 
capabilities to reduce or negate U.S. and partner vulnerabilities and minimize the effects of WMD use. 
Passive defense protects U.S. military interests, installations, and critical infrastructure. These capabilities 
also represent benefits to allies and partners and can influence their support. 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT 
2-34. The joint force commander employs consequence management capabilities to sustain operations, to 
mitigate undesired effects such as the release of WMD-related material, and to manage the consequences of 
such unintended effects. By demonstrating the ability to deny the benefits of WMD use, consequence 
management capabilities can also influence adversary decisions to employ WMD.  
TACTICAL CONTEXT 
2-35. CBRN operations include the employment of tactical capabilities that counter the entire range of 
CBRN threats and hazards through WMD proliferation prevention, WMD counterforce, CBRN defense, 
and CBRN consequence management activities in support of operational and strategic objectives to combat 
WMD and operate safely in CBRN environments. CBRN operations include tactical capability 
employments that support operational and strategic objectives for CWMD. Understanding the tactical 
context requires defining the tactical construct and identifying what the eight military mission areas mean 
to military personnel at the tactical level of war. 
2-36. It is not feasible to develop a comprehensive approach to CWMD without addressing tactical-level 
capabilities. CBRN operations employ service-unique capabilities to achieve the CWMD objectives for a 
given military mission area. For example, the USA or USMC might not have the level of expertise required 
to conduct dismantling activities during WMD eliminations operations. Commanders at the tactical level 
are concerned with how the eight military mission areas relate to one another and the joint campaign, and 
then they determine whether they are supporting the eight military mission areas in CWMD objectives 
conducting CBRN operations. 
2-37. Activities in the eight military mission areas are not necessarily conducted sequentially and 
discretely in the prosecution of tactical-level military operations; they will occur independently or 
simultaneously in response to a CBRN threat or hazard, depending on whether tactical units are conducting 
CBRN operations or supporting CWMD objectives. Figure 2-5 shows the relationship among tactical tasks, 
tactical objectives, CWMD strategic pillars, and threats and hazards.

2-38. The tactical tasks support the eight military mission areas and the strategic objectives. There are four 
tactical objectives (proliferation prevention, WMD counterforce, CBRN defense, and CBRN consequence 
management). If a CWMD program is successful, adversaries are prevented from acquiring WMD; 
however, successive CWMD program failures may ultimately culminate in a CBRN incident that requires 
mitigation.  
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION PROLIFERATION PREVENTION 
2-39. WMD proliferation prevention is the employment of tactical level capabilities to support 
operational and strategic nonproliferation objectives of combating WMD. The goal of proliferation 
prevention is to exert an early influence in the adversary’s decision cycle that discourages an interest in (or 
the decision to seek or acquire) CBRN materials, WMD precursors, sensitive technologies, or expertise that 
could be used against the United States or our allies. If our proliferation prevention efforts fail and the 
adversary decides to move forward with the intent of WMD acquisition, the U.S. response options escalate 
into WMD counterforce (interdiction, offensive operations, and WMD elimination operations).  
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION COUNTERFORCE 
2-40. WMD counterforce is a tactical objective to defeat the full range of CBRN threats before they 
can be employed as weapons. WMD counterforce operations aim to prevent, dissuade, deny, or defeat 
adversary CBRN capabilities, including research and development, production and storage facilities, 
fielded forces, and related C2. These operations are intended to deter or defeat a CBRN threat or the 
subsequent use of WMD and reduce the level of threats to be dealt with by CBRN active or passive 
defenses.  
Note. Chapter 4 discusses WMD counterforce operations in more detail. 
CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR DEFENSE 
2-41. CBRN defense consists of measures that are taken to minimize or negate the vulnerabilities and/or 
effects of a CBRN incident. CBRN defense operations are proactive tactical capabilities that contain 
reactive characteristics: 
 
CBRN active defense operations attempt to intercept CBRN weapons en route to their targets. 
 
CBRN passive defense operations improve the ability to survive and sustain in a contaminated 
environment through proper planning, training, risk assessment, and vulnerability and hazard 
mitigation. CBRN passive defense includes measures to minimize or negate the vulnerability to, 
and minimize effects of, WMD use against U.S. and partner/allied forces and U.S. military 
interests, installations, and critical infrastructure.

2-42. Consequence management activities are actions that are taken to maintain or restore essential

natural, man-made, or terrorist incidents. CBRN consequence management activities serve to reduce the 
effects of a CBRN attack or event and assist in the restoration of essential operations and services at home 
and abroad in a permissive environment. Consequence management includes actions taken to—

Note. Chapter 5 discusses CBRN consequence management operations in more detail. 
2-43. CBRN operations at the tactical level must be integrated into all military operations to support the 
National Military Strategy to Combat WMD, which requires the synchronization of the following tactical 
tasks:  
 
Providing security cooperation and partner activity support. 
 
Providing threat reduction cooperation support. 
 
Conducting WMD interdiction, offensive, and elimination operations. 
 
Conducting CBRN active defense, passive defense, and consequence management operations.  
SUMMARY 
2-44. U.S. policies and strategies seek to prevent and limit the proliferation of CBRN capabilities. The 
National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction articulates a proactive and comprehensive 
strategy built upon the three pillars of nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and consequence 
management. DOD awareness, responsibility, and focus have shifted to expand the planning, preparation, 
and execution activities in support of the CWMD mission. The eight military mission areas provide the 
framework for ensuring CWMD program success. This multi-Service doctrine provides principles for 
conducting CBRN operations.

Chapter 3 
Nonproliferation Activities 
Nonproliferation activities are actions that are taken to prevent the proliferation of 
WMD by dissuading or impeding access to, or distribution of, sensitive technologies, 
material, and expertise. Examples of nonproliferation activities include diplomacy, 
arms control, multilateral agreements, threat reduction assistance, export controls, 
and WMD interdiction. 
OVERVIEW 
3-1. In recent years, the prevention of WMD proliferation has become much more complex and 
challenging due to the greater availability of components, technologies, expertise, and information. 
Proliferation is the transfer of CBRN-related weapons, materials, technology, and expertise from suppliers 
to hostile states or nonstate actors. This availability stems from the willingness of various state suppliers or 
companies within those states to sell materials and an explosion of more readily accessible information 
from academic and commercial sources or the Internet. Weakened security at some key CBRN-related 
facilities in the former Soviet Union, the search for employment by unemployed scientists and technicians 
associated with active or formerly active Soviet programs, and the transfer or sharing of technology among 
states trying to develop programs have also contributed to the proliferation of this sensitive information.  
3-2. At the tactical level, nonproliferation activities should focus on proliferation prevention as the 
tactical objective and focus on WMD security cooperation and partner activities and threat reduction 
cooperation military mission areas as the means. The tactical tasks necessary for the commander to assist in 
proliferation prevention and dissuade the use of WMD as part of an integrated military objective are 
conducted in support of the mission areas. A tactical mission task is a specific activity performed by a unit 
while executing a form of tactical operation or maneuver. It may be expressed in terms of action by a 
friendly force or effects on an enemy force. CBRN operations supporting nonproliferation are shown in 
figure 3-1, page 3-2, and discussed in this chapter. 
Note. The eight military mission areas of CWMD are not conducted sequentially and discretely 
in the prosecution of tactical-level military operations. They will occur independently or 
simultaneously in response to the CBRN threat or hazard, depending on whether tactical units 
are conducting CBRN operations while supporting CWMD objectives.  
PROLIFERATION PREVENTION 
3-3. Proliferation prevention is the tactical-level implementation of the strategic-level nonproliferation 
pillar. The goal of proliferation prevention is to exert an early influence in the adversary’s decision cycle 
that discourages their interest in, or decision to seek or acquire, CBRN materials, WMD precursors, 
sensitive technologies, or expertise that could be used against the United States or its allies. Commanders 
supporting nonproliferation activities at the tactical level should ensure that forces are trained, equipped, 
and available to conduct essential tasks that meet the nonproliferation objectives. Tactical tasks include 
providing support to security cooperation and partner activities and supporting threat reduction cooperation 
and may include conducting interdiction operations that sustain the military strategic objectives of 
prevent/dissuade/deny.

3-4. The first line of nonproliferation defense is provided by the global nonproliferation treaties—the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Chemical Weapons Convention, and Biological Weapons Convention. 
These treaties have established widely accepted norms for the restriction of WMD acquisition, stockpiling, 
and proliferation; and they continue to advance dialogue and cooperation among nations. Although these 
treaties have established strong global norms, their ability to prevent WMD acquisition is only as strong as 
the signatories’ willingness to comply with their treaty-based obligations and the resolve of compliant 
parties to hold others to their obligations. Experience with North Korea, Libya, Iraq, and Iran provides 
significant lessons learned regarding noncompliance. The United States may take the following measures to 
support nonproliferation: 
 
Pursue active nonproliferation diplomacy by dissuading supplier states from cooperating with 
proliferant states and inducing states to end their WMD and missile programs. 
 
Support and seek to improve the effectiveness of existing nonproliferation and arms control 
regimes.

Note. Additional details concerning individual treaties are provided in Appendix B. 
3-5. United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR)1540 is the latest in a series of internationally 
directed, concrete measures aimed at preventing WMD proliferation and, most particularly, preventing and 
countering terrorist acquisition and use of these deadly weapons.  
3-6. The multilateral export control regimes—the Nuclear Suppliers Group, Zangger Committee, Missile 
Technology Control Regime, Australia Group, and Wassenaar Arrangement—are a second, important layer 
of nonproliferation defense. Each of these export control regimes plays a critical role in identifying key 
WMD- and missile-related material and technology and appropriate approaches to control access to such 
items. Limited-membership, export control regimes in the Zangger Committee, Nuclear Suppliers Group, 
and Australia Group have given greater specificity to items of concern under the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and Chemical Weapons Convention and have broadened the number and variety of controlled 
materials and technologies.  
Note. See Appendix B for detailed information on policies and treaties for the CBRN aspects of 
CWMD. 
SECURITY COOPERATION AND PARTNER ACTIVITIES 
3-7. Tactical commanders provide support to security cooperation and partner activities to pursue CWMD 
objectives. The security cooperation and partner activities mission is a collection of interrelated day-to-day 
activities to deny, dissuade, and prevent potential adversaries from obtaining or proliferating WMD. DOD 
plays a significant, but often overlooked, role in this mission. Activities include traditional export control 
regimes and nonproliferation treaties that allow partner nations to contribute to stemming the proliferation 
of WMD materials and components. Nonproliferation initiatives such as the Missile Technology Control 
Regime and the Nuclear Suppliers Group create international norms regarding proliferation and give 
visibility to export control problems that could otherwise lead to the spread of WMD technology and 
materials.  
3-8. Security cooperation and partner activities are incorporated into the day-to-day military role. 
Commanders must develop CWMD programs that integrate all DOD security cooperation activities, 
including multinational exercises, security assistance, multinational training, multinational education, 
multinational experimentation, defense and military contacts, foreign humanitarian assistance, and Office 
of the Secretary of Defense-managed threat reduction measures. These actions are conducted to deter, 
defeat, and respond to WMD threats in areas of responsibility. 
3-9. Security cooperation is the primary capability used by the U.S. military to build partner capacity to 
combat proliferation. Security cooperation allows the transfer of technology and know-how to partners and 
allows direct observation and interaction to ensure that equipment and training are used properly. 
3-10. Partner activities also support other mission areas as the primary tool for building partner capacity. 
For example, initiatives such as the NATO Multinational CBRN Defense Battalion and Proliferation 
Security Initiative address such mission areas as defense against WMD attack and interdiction. The U.S. 
military is uniquely equipped with capabilities that are readily applicable to border security and can be 
transferred rapidly. Three DOD programs worth noting are the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, 
Proliferation Prevention Initiative, and International Counterproliferation Program. Together, they provide 
the resources to train and equip foreign militaries and civilians to secure WMD facilities and enhance 
border security.  
Note. See Chapter 2 and Appendix B for more information on CWMD-related policies, treaties, 
and agreements.

theater security activities being conducted in an area of responsibility. Tactical commanders provide 
support to the security cooperation effort to prevent, dissuade, and deny proliferation or possession along 
with the ability to reduce, destroy, or reverse possession of WMD programs. The following 
organizations/activities directly or indirectly support the security cooperation and partner activities

THREAT REDUCTION 
3-12. Threat reduction cooperation includes those activities undertaken with the consent and cooperation of 
host nation authorities in a permissive environment to enhance physical security and to reduce, dismantle, 
redirect, and/or improve the protection of a state’s existing WMD program, stockpiles, and capabilities. 
Tactical commanders provide threat reduction cooperation activities in support of CWMD objectives. The 
principle purpose of these activities is to deny rogue states and terrorists access to weapons, material, and 
expertise. Other states may need assistance with more discrete requirements to dismantle or destroy WMD 
in excess of defense needs; to comply with international treaty obligations (such as the Chemical Weapons 
Convention); or to impose export control, border control, law enforcement, and antismuggling capabilities.  
3-13. Threat reduction cooperation also responds to opportunities to roll back or eliminate a state’s WMD 
programs and capabilities on cooperative terms; for example, Libya’s decision to voluntarily dismantle its 
WMD programs. Another challenge is the safety and security of WMD inventories of friendly or nonhostile 
states. Existing security arrangements may be viewed as inadequate to prevent theft, sabotage, or accidental 
release. Threat reduction cooperation occurs in a permissive environment, and while not primarily a 
combatant commander responsibility, combatant commands must maintain visibility of these efforts to 
ensure that theater security cooperation plans and security measures are consistent with threat reduction 
initiatives. The following military tasks directly or indirectly support threat reduction cooperation in a 
permissive environment: 
 
Provide security for current WMD, related materials, and systems from theft, sabotage, or 
unauthorized use. 
 
Support efforts to ensure the safety of WMD and delivery systems from accidental or inadvertent 
release. 
 
Maintain situational awareness of WMD safety and security issues, and communicate concerns 
to senior leaders. 
 
Integrate commander’s safety/security concerns and threat prioritization with operational-level 
guidance. 
 
Assign responsibilities for threat reduction cooperation, and coordinate efforts with other 
commands. 
3-14. Tactical nonproliferation activities are not conducted sequentially and discretely in the prosecution of 
tactical-level military operations, but will occur independently or simultaneously in response to security

cooperation and partner activities and threat reduction cooperation. Tactical commanders should be 
prepared to provide short-notice support to cooperative WMD threat reduction efforts. Supporting tasks 
that are directly or indirectly related to cooperative WMD threat reduction efforts include emplacing 
sensors and conducting monitoring, detection, and security operations. 
SUMMARY 
3-15. This chapter outlined two of the eight military mission areas in support of nonproliferation activities. 
These activities are conducted in permissive environments and directed toward the prevention of 
proliferation. In the event that an adversary decides to proliferate in a permissive, hostile, or uncertain 
environment, CWMD activities may transition from nonproliferation to counterproliferation activities when 
diplomacy fails.  
Note. Counterproliferation activities are discussed in Chapter 4.

Chapter 4 
Counterproliferation Activities  
Counterproliferation includes actions that are taken to defeat the threat and/or use of 
WMD against the United States and its military forces, friends, and allies. The full 
range of Service capabilities will be required to counter the threat and use of WMD. 
The objective of counterproliferation operations is to deter, interdict, defend against, 
and eliminate the WMD threat across the full range of possible WMD acquisition, 
development, and employment scenarios. 
OVERVIEW 
4-1. CWMD has taken on greater national security importance in recent years and has been accorded a 
higher priority in defense planning. Proliferation networks are diverse and operate globally. Additionally, 
these networks share many characteristics and even operate in conjunction with terrorist networks. The 
CWMD challenges demonstrate the need to use a broad construct to combat WMD. To overcome these 
challenges, the military must work in concert with other elements of national power and leverage actions of 
other government agencies and multinational partners to achieve coordinated strategic, operational, and 
tactical effects to combat WMD.  
4-2. Counterproliferation activities are focused on WMD counterforce and CBRN defense. The 
architecture supporting counterproliferation is outlined in figure 4-1, page 4-2. Tactical commanders will 
primarily focus on the five mission areas that support WMD counterforce and CBRN defense objectives 
(WMD interdiction, WMD offensive operations, WMD elimination, CBRN active defense, and CBRN 
passive defense). They will develop the ability to execute the tasks necessary to successfully accomplish 
missions associated with counterproliferation. This does not preclude the use of tactical units to assist in 
WMD security cooperation and partner activities and CBRN consequence management to prevent 
proliferation or mitigate the effects of a CBRN event.  
Note. The eight military mission areas of CWMD are not conducted sequentially and discretely 
in the prosecution of tactical-level military operations. They will occur independently or 
simultaneously in response to the CBRN threat or hazard, depending on whether tactical units 
are conducting CBRN operations while supporting CWMD objectives.  
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION COUNTERFORCE 
4-3. WMD counterforce is a tactical objective to defeat the full range of CBRN threats before they can be 
employed as weapons. WMD counterforce refers to tactical offensive operations to strike adversary CBRN 
weapons and associated production, transportation, and storage facilities prior to use. WMD counterforce 
includes the tasks of conducting WMD interdiction, WMD offensive operations, and WMD elimination 
operations, encompassing the detection, deterrence, denial, degradation, and/or destruction of an 
adversary’s WMD assets, means of delivery, and facilities.

4-4. Associated WMD counterforce capabilities include the ability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and 
assess attacks against WMD targets and the ability to defeat or neutralize CBRN material, weapons, and 
equipment before they can be brought to bear in the area of responsibility, while limiting collateral effects. 
Targeting is an important consideration that links WMD counterforce objectives to tactical actions and 
tasks.  
4-5. Targeting matches the commander’s objectives, guidance, and intent with inputs from each Service 
and staff element to identify forces and effects necessary to achieve the objectives. Targeting operations are 
intended to deter or defeat a WMD threat or subsequent use and to reduce the level of threats that are dealt 
with by CBRN active or CBRN passive defense. WMD targets are integrated into commanders’ existing 
targeting processes and boards, and service publications provide detailed guidance for targeting.

4-6. The following vignette provides an example of counterforce operations. 
Iraq is one country that has suffered repeated counterforce strikes as other states have attempted to destroy 
its WMD capabilities. Starting with the Israeli strike on Iraq’s French-supplied nuclear reactor at Osiraq in 
June 1980 and ending with Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, numerous attacks have been made on 
Iraq’s WMD infrastructure in an attempt to disarm and/or disrupt these threatening programs. While the 
aerial campaign during the Gulf War represented the most sustained and intensive of these efforts, other 
selective attacks in response to various UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission] crises during the 
1990s also targeted Iraq’s WMD programs. 
In 2002, the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] identified Libya, Syria, Egypt, Sudan, Iran, and Iraq as 
countries actively seeking to develop WMD. The threat in the Gulf seems particularly high, especially the 
threat posed to forward-deployed U.S. forces in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab 
Emirates, and Oman. In Iraq, counterforce operations delayed and complicated Saddam’s efforts to develop 
and maintain WMD capabilities. 
Counterforce (dependent on intelligence for targeting) is but one tool available to the United States to deal 
with the emerging threat environment, but it must be employed within the context of a broader campaign 
using a variety of means to disarm a hostile state’s WMD. 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION INTERDICTION OPERATIONS 
4-7. WMD interdiction consists of operations to track, intercept, search, divert, seize, or otherwise stop 
the transit of WMD, its delivery systems, or related materials, technologies, and expertise. WMD 
interdiction is also called counterproliferation interdiction. The transit of WMD-related weapons, 
materials, or expertise may occur in many combinations—from state-to-state, state-to-nonstate, nonstate-to-
state, and nonstate-to-nonstate actors. Commanders must be prepared to intercept and deny or prevent 
WMD-related materials or expertise from moving to its destination.  
4-8. Interdiction may occur more frequently in noncombat situations than during combat operations at 
sea, on land, or in the air, especially in permissive and uncertain environments. Stopping a terrorist who is 
en route to transfer WMD material to a hostile government official is one example of interdiction 
operations. Commanders must be prepared to coordinate with other agencies and multinational partners to 
execute and support interdiction operations in their area of responsibility.  
4-9. Operations to deny and interdict proliferation-related shipments assist the disruption and 
dismantlement of proliferation networks. These operations track, intercept, search, divert, seize, or stop the 
trafficking of WMD, delivery systems, related materials, technologies, and expertise from adversaries. 
Associated activities may include intercepting, identifying, securing, disposing of, or rendering safe suspect 
WMD-related materials. 
4-10. If interdiction results in the seizure of WMD or related material, the commander may be required to 
reduce the threat by securing and removing (neutralize or transport) the WMD and related material. If there 
is an accidental release of CBRN in a permissive or uncertain operational environment, the commander 
may also be required to execute consequence management operations.  
4-11. The focus of WMD interdiction and CBRN active defense operations differ. While CBRN active 
defense focuses on weapons en route to a target, WMD interdiction focuses on stopping the transit of 
WMD capabilities. For example— 
 
If a complete nuclear weapon is being delivered to a buyer, WMD interdiction and CBRN active 
defense are applicable.  
 
If nuclear weapon pieces and/or parts are being shipped to a buyer, WMD interdiction is 
applicable. 
 
If the destination port is the target of nuclear weapon, CBRN active defense is applicable.

4-12. Examples of tactical WMD interdiction tasks include— 
 
Developing a synchronization plan for joint, tactical air/land/sea interdiction operations. 
 
Characterizing WMD implications of the tactical situation. 
 
Conducting tactical WMD interdiction target analysis.  
 
Issuing tactical WMD interdiction planning guidance to subordinate component forces. 
 
Developing tactical intelligence for WMD interdiction requirements. 
 
Exercising C2 in preparation for, and conduct of, WMD interdiction operations. 
 
Coordinating joint/multinational and interagency support. 
 
Conducting tactical-level risk assessment to support WMD interdiction operations. 
 
Establishing CBRN defense information integration and connectivity. 
 
Diverting, disrupting, delaying, or destroying the enemy’s WMD capability before it can be used 
effectively. 
 
Integrating CBRN defense capabilities (sampling, monitoring, identification, and 
reconnaissance). 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS 
4-13. WMD offensive operations consist of actions to disrupt, neutralize, or destroy a WMD threat before 
it can be used or to deter the subsequent use of such weapons. WMD offensive operations include raids, 
strikes, and operations designed to locate and take action against the threat of WMD use. 
4-14. In hostile or uncertain environments where interdiction efforts have been unsuccessful in halting 
rogue behavior, the President or Secretary of Defense can direct the commander to execute offensive 
operations in order to destroy the WMD network’s ability to produce, deploy, or employ WMD. The 
commander may use WMD offensive operations to attack targets (using lethal means), or he may conduct 
engagements on targets using nonlethal means. WMD offensive operations are led by the military and 
encompass the detection, identification, disruption, and destruction of an adversary’s WMD assets, delivery 
means, associated facilities, and other high-value targets.  
4-15. The WMD offensive operations mission area is largely the domain of the DOD, albeit interagency 
cooperation will increase as operational strike capabilities progress toward attacks against WMD targets. 
Since offensive strike operations against WMD targets may result in the release of hazmat, increased 
political and legal scrutiny is normally necessary. This mission area also requires maintaining a capability 
to locate, secure, and recover/destroy stolen WMD. 
4-16. In the event that an adversary attempts to use WMD, WMD offensive operations may help disrupt 
and weaken a WMD attack, increasing the effectiveness of other complementary elements of CWMD, such 
as CBRN active defense, passive defense, and consequence management. These operations impose 
substantial cost upon the WMD actor and require substantial refined intelligence.  
4-17. The operational distinctions between WMD offensive operations and WMD elimination operations 
lie in the overall end state of the actions associated with the military mission areas. While WMD 
elimination operations focus on the systematic elimination of the entire WMD program, WMD offensive 
operations focus only on distinct targets or nodes of the WMD program or capabilities. 
4-18. WMD offensive operations can support WMD elimination operations, but WMD elimination 
operations do not support WMD offensive operations because the end states differ. Examples of tactical 
tasks that support WMD offensive operations include—  
 
Conducting raids to destroy a specific node or target, but not the entire WMD program. 
 
Conducting air strikes to deny enemy access to, or use of, WMD delivery systems.  
 
Conducting operations to board and seize control of, or totally destroy, an enemy’s nuclear 
submarine. 
 
Using special artillery equipment to conduct surveillance operations to detect the enemy’s 
WMD-related activities.

 
Gathering intelligence related to the use of WMD through the interrogation of captured 
personnel or exploitation of material. 
 
Defeating, degrading, destroying, disrupting, neutralizing, securing, seizing, or denying the 
enemy’s WMD capability before it can be used effectively. 
 
Integrating CBRN defense capabilities (sampling, monitoring, identification, and 
reconnaissance). 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION ELIMINATION OPERATIONS 
4-19. WMD elimination operations consist of those actions undertaken in a hostile or uncertain 
environment to systematically locate, characterize, secure, disable, or destroy WMD programs and related 
capabilities. The United States may decide to conduct military operations within the territory of a WMD 
possessor state or against terrorist programs that are operating within a state during WMD elimination 
operations. Expedient WMD elimination operations may be required to ensure the safety of troops, secure 
the freedom of action for combat operations, or protect noncombatants.  
4-20. To an increasing degree, hostile nations and nonstate enemies are developing WMD for potential 
deterrence against the United States and/or to threaten other opponents. More ominously, enemies may 
regard the use of such weapons as politically or militarily expedient. Deterrence strategies may prove 
ineffective against irrational actors. Therefore, completely eliminating an enemy’s capability to acquire, 
store, and employ these weapons becomes a crucial component of any future campaign’s end state. 
Eliminating enemy WMD may be the principal objective of a campaign; the defeat or destruction of the 
enemy’s other military capability would be a necessary step to achieve the larger goal. 
4-21. WMD elimination operations must focus, initially, on the immediate tasks of security (securing sites 
and preventing the looting or capture of WMD and related materials) and the disablement or destruction of 
weapons, materials, agents, and delivery systems that pose an immediate or direct threat to forces and the 
civilian population. The next priority is the exploitation of program experts (for intelligence purposes) and 
previously secured weapons and material to secure, exploit, and disable WMD production capabilities and 
advance the elimination process prior to transitioning elimination operations to an international or host 
nation body. 
4-22. WMD capabilities that are candidates for WMD elimination operations include, but are not limited 
to— 
 
Weapon systems and associated stockpiles. 
 
Raw material/agents or precursor stockpiles. 
 
Artillery/rocket delivery systems, such as mortars, howitzers, multiple rocket launch systems, 
motor vessels, missiles and missile systems, aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems, and other 
unconventional delivery systems.  
 
Dual-use facilities, such as commercial nuclear power facilities, research reactors, research and 
development facilities, laboratories, production facilities, radioisotope thermoelectric generators, 
pharmaceutical/formulation programs, agriculture and fertilizer facilities, and food irradiation 
facilities. 
 
Dual-use expertise, including personnel and documents associated with research, production, 
testing, storage, or proliferation networks or operations. 
4-23. WMD elimination operations employ many of the same counterforce operations capabilities as 
offensive operations to— 
 
Reduce the immediate threat (secure and destroy/remove WMD and related material/resources). 
 
Lay the groundwork to transition the long-term destruction, redirection, and monitoring 
activities of remaining elements of the WMD program to threat reduction cooperation.  
4-24. WMD elimination operations also seek to locate and secure key personnel in the program. Since 
WMD elimination requires some U.S. physical control of the infrastructure to establish attribution, the 
commander must provide CBRN passive defense for the executing force elements.

FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42

4-25. WMD elimination and threat reduction cooperation are two military mission areas that are habitually 
linked, but very different. The difference comes down to the consent and cooperation of the host nation and 
the operational environment in which the missions take place. While the ultimate goal may be the same—to 
characterize and reduce or eliminate the threat of WMD—the operational aspects are very different. Threat 
reduction cooperation activities occur in a permissive environment. Since WMD elimination operations are 
conducted in hostile or uncertain environments, they require intense intelligence efforts to penetrate the 
program. WMD elimination operations may ultimately transition to threat reduction cooperation activities 
as the operational environment changes. WMD elimination tasks may include— 
 
Issuing tactical WMD interdiction planning guidance to subordinate component forces. 
 
Conducting a course-of-action assessment of a CBRN/toxic industrial material incident for the 
WMD mission force. 
 
Moving forces in support of the WMD elimination mission. 
 
Searching facilities/spaces during the WMD elimination mission. 
 
Detecting WMD-related material during the WMD elimination mission. 
 
Characterizing WMD-related material during the WMD elimination mission. 
 
Containing suspect WMD-related material for further disposition. 
 
Gathering forensic evidence in support of the WMD elimination mission. 
 
Performing the immediate decontamination of WMD elimination force personnel and 
equipment. 
 
Conducting medical surveillance based on syndromic information/data. 
 
Maintaining the control of materials related to the WMD elimination mission. 
 
Initiating medical prophylactic measures to counter CBRN/toxic industrial material effects. 
 
Transporting WMD-related material for further disposition. 
 
Training for WMD elimination operations. 
 
Conducting WMD elimination target analysis. 
CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR 
DEFENSE 
4-26. CBRN defense is measures taken to minimize or negate the vulnerabilities and effects of a CBRN 
incident. The combination of active and passive defense measures reduces the effectiveness or success of 
CBRN weapon employment. It is imperative that all commanders integrate CBRN defense into their 
mission planning, regardless of the mission type.  
ACTIVE DEFENSE OPERATIONS 
4-27. CBRN active defense comprises measures taken to defeat an attack with CBRN weapons by 
employing actions to divert, neutralize, or destroy those weapons or their means of delivery while en 
route to their target. CBRN active defense operations to defend against conventionally and 
unconventionally delivered WMD include, but are not limited to— 
 
Missile defense (ballistic and cruise). 
 
Air defense. 
 
Special operations. 
 
Security operations. 
4-28. There is a difference between CBRN active defense and WMD interdiction operations. The goal of 
active defense operations is to achieve a layered capability to defeat the full scope of delivery means in 
defense of the homeland, expeditionary forces, and other assets and interests in forward regions. However, 
WMD interdiction operations focus on stopping the transit of WMD capabilities. Examples of CBRN 
active defense tasks include— 
 
Destroying CBRN-capable artillery battery using counterbattery fires, air strikes, or missiles 
directly on an enemy position. The destruction leverages lethal and nonlethal means. 
 
Destroying enemy aircraft armed with WMD through air-to-air or ground-to-air engagements.

 
Delivering air strikes on trucks that are loaded with ammunition while they are en route to the 
detonation location. 
 
Diverting the enemy’s intent to position WMD for delivery. 
 
Detecting planned terrorist actions. For example, detect a suicide bomber and neutralize him or 
her before detonation is possible. Maximize the use of intelligence assets to discover who, what, 
when, where, and how. 
 
Intercepting, engaging, neutralizing, or destroying WMD en route to a target by using surface-to-
air missiles. This includes disrupting enemy theater missile operations (ballistic missiles; air-to-
surface missiles; and air-, land-, and sea-launched cruise missiles) through an appropriate mix of 
mutually supportive passive missile defense, active missile defense, attack operations, combat 
air patrol, and supporting information systems. 
PASSIVE DEFENSE OPERATIONS 
4-29. CBRN passive defense includes measures taken to minimize or negate the vulnerability to, and 
effects of, CBRN attacks. This mission area focuses on maintaining the joint force’s ability to continue 
military operations in a CBRN environment. CBRN passive defense measures enable air and ground 
military operations to be sustained in a CBRN environment. Success depends on the effective integration of 
equipment; CBRN training; and proven tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
Note. Appendix C provides basic standards of proficiency for individuals and organizations and 
additional standards of proficiency for selected personnel, CBRN defense specialists, medical 
personnel, and commanders. 
4-30. If an adversary succeeds in launching a CBRN attack and CBRN active defense measures fail to 
eliminate the delivery vehicle and/or weapons, CBRN passive defense measures become critical. These 
passive defense measures are designed to mitigate the immediate effects of a CBRN incident and to protect 
U.S. forces who are conducting military missions in a CBRN environment.  
4-31. CBRN passive defense has historically been based on three general principles that specifically 
address the hazards created by CBRN incidents or accidents. The application of the following principles 
helps minimize vulnerabilities, protects friendly forces, and maintains the force’s operational tempo in 
order to achieve objectives: 
 
CBRN contamination avoidance of CBRN hazards. 
 
CBRN protection of individuals, units, and equipment from unavoidable CBRN hazards. 
 
CBRN decontamination to restore operational capability.  
Note. Although C2 is not one of the CBRN principles, it is the mechanism that integrates. 
4-32. Within the DOD, principles associated with CBRN passive defense are organized under the four 
CBRN operational elements: 
 
Sense. 
 
Shape. 
 
Shield. 
 
Sustain.  
4-33. These elements are linked with and provide the capabilities to support the principles of CBRN 
passive defense as outlined in figure 4-2, page 4-8.

Contamination Avoidance 
4-34. Successful contamination avoidance prevents disruption to operations and organizations by 
eliminating unnecessary time in cumbersome protective postures and decontamination requirements. 
Avoiding contamination requires the ability to detect and report the presence of CBRN hazards.  
4-35. The CBRN sense function is a capability to achieve CBRN contamination avoidance. CBRN sense is 
defined as activities that continually provide CBRN threat and hazard information and intelligence in a 
timely manner to support the common operational picture. CBRN sense is key to contamination avoidance 
because it is intended to continually provide critical information about potential or actual CBRN hazards in 
a timely manner through early detection, identification, and determination of the scope of hazards.  
Note. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance for a more detailed discussion of 
contamination avoidance.  
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Protection 
4-36. CBRN protection includes those measures that are taken to keep CBRN threats and hazards from 
having an adverse effect on personnel, equipment, and critical assets and facilities. Commanders must 
implement protective measures that are appropriate to all anticipated threats, including terrorists and the use 
of WMD or other CBRN hazards. CBRN protection often requires capabilities from CBRN active and 
passive defense and also requires the planning, preparation, training, and execution of physical defenses to

negate the effects of CBRN weapons and hazards on personnel and materiel. CBRN protection conserves 
the force by providing individual and collective protection postures and capabilities. CBRN shield 
comprises the individual and collective protection measures that are essential to mitigating the effects of 
CBRN hazards. Protecting the force from CBRN hazards may include hardening systems and facilities, 
preventing or reducing individual and collective exposures, or applying medical prophylaxes.  
Note. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and 
Chemical (NBC) Protection for a more detailed discussion of CBRN protection. 
Decontamination 
4-37. Decontamination is the process of absorbing, destroying, neutralizing, making harmless, or removing 
chemical and biological agents or removing radioactive material that is around or clinging to a person, 
object, or area in order to make it safe . Decontamination is a key component of the overarching concept of 
contamination control and supports the postattack restoration of forces and operations to a near-normal 
capability. Decontamination and contamination control are intended to minimize the time required to return 
personnel and mission-essential equipment to a mission-capable state. Commanders must prioritize 
requirements and decontaminate only what is necessary because assets are limited and decontamination is 
often labor-intensive.  
Note. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, and Nuclear Decontamination for a more detailed discussion of decontamination. 
4-38. Contamination control addresses— 
 
Controlling contaminated waste. 
 
Establishing contaminated-equipment holding and exclusion areas. 
 
Minimizing the levels of contamination where it cannot be avoided. 
 
Conducting split mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) operations. (Split MOPP is the 
concept of maintaining heightened protective posture only in those areas or zones that are 
contaminated, allowing personnel in uncontaminated areas to continue operations in a reduced 
protective posture.) 
4-39. CBRN sustain comprises the decontamination and medical activities conducted to restore combat 
power and continue operations. Mitigation includes planning, initiating, and continuing operations, despite 
threats from CBRN materials, by conducting contamination control and medical countermeasures that 
enable the quick restoration of operational capability. 
Note. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Chemical, 
Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense for a more detailed discussion of contamination 
control. 
Command and Control 
4-40. C2 is associated with the CBRN shape function. As information is characterized, commanders are 
able to make decisions that will support the CRBN principles to— 
 
Plan, conduct, and integrate CBRN defense with other defenses. 
 
Optimize the capability to operate in a CBRN environment. 
 
Minimize negative psychological effects.  
4-41. CBRN shape is the C2 activities that integrate the CBRN sense, shield, and sustain operational 
elements to characterize CBRN hazards and threats and employ necessary capabilities to counter their 
effects.

SUMMARY 
4-42. This chapter outlined WMD counterforce, CBRN defense, and five of the eight military mission 
areas in support of counterproliferation activities. These activities are conducted in nonpermissive 
environments and directed toward defeating the threat or toward the use of WMD against the United States 
and our forces, friends, and allies. WMD counterforce and CBRN defense activities may transition from 
counterproliferation to consequence management activities when CWMD programs fail.  
Note. Consequence management activities are discussed in Chapter 5.

Consequence Management Activities  
CBRN consequence management consists of actions taken to plan, prepare, 
respond to, and recover from CBRN incidents that require force and resource 
allocation beyond passive defense capabilities. CBRN consequence management 
activities performed by U.S. military forces encompass actions taken to mitigate the 
consequences from deliberate and inadvertent releases of CBRN agents or substances 
and assist in the restoration of essential operations and services at home and abroad. 
Properly executed CBRN consequence management mitigates the effects of the event 
and serves as a deterrent for future attacks. 
Note. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, and Nuclear Consequence Management Operations for detailed 
information. 
OVERVIEW 
5-1. The counterproliferation activities of WMD counterforce and CBRN defense actions may not 
eliminate or reduce the effects of deliberate and inadvertent releases of CBRN agents and material that 
have the potential to cause high casualties and large levels of destruction. As technology becomes 
increasingly available, terrorists seek new ways to acquire, manufacture, weaponize, and deploy CBRN 
agents and materials. Addressing the impact of an accidental, intentional, or natural release of CBRN 
material is the basis for the CBRN consequence management activities performed at the tactical level. 
5-2. CBRN consequence management is normally managed at the strategic and operational levels (U.S. or 
host nation government), with DOD providing support as directed. During combat operations, DOD leads 
the operational response in reaction to an incident involving U.S. forces and allies. When directed or 
authorized by the President, the Secretary of Defense may authorize civil support operations. Abroad, when 
requested by a host nation, the President may authorize, and the Secretary of Defense may direct, DOD 
support to U.S. Government foreign consequence management operations.  
5-3. The DOD conducts CBRN consequence management in support of civil authorities to mitigate the 
effects of accidental or intentional CBRN event, usually in support of a primary agency. CBRN 
consequence management operations occur in foreign and domestic settings. DOD must be prepared to 
conduct CBRN consequence management operations when called upon. The Department of Homeland 
Security is the primary agency for a continental United States (CONUS) WMD event. On foreign territory, 
the Department of State is the primary agency for coordinating responses to host nation requests for 
support. DOD leads the operational response for an incident involving U.S. forces and allies.  
5-4. The primary goals of CBRN consequence management are to— 
 
Save lives. 
 
Prevent injury. 
 
Provide temporary critical life support. 
 
Protect critical infrastructure, property, and the environment. 
 
Contain the event. 
 
Preserve national security.  
5-5. Currently, U.S. forces may conduct consequence management operations in a designated joint 
operations area to sustain operations, mitigate undesired effects (such as the release of CBRN hazards), and 
Chapter 5 
5-2 
FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42 
1 July 2011 
manage the consequences of such effects. By demonstrating the ability to deny the benefits of WMD use, 
consequence management capabilities can also influence adversary decisions to employ WMD. 
5-6. CBRN consequence management tasks at the tactical level support strategic and operational 
objectives and must be tailored to make the preservation of life a priority. This is a significant shift in 
mind-set for commanders, staff, and CBRN consequence management planners. CBRN consequence 
management operations supporting consequence management activities are outlined in figure 5-1. 
Note. The eight military mission areas of CWMD are not conducted sequentially and discretely 
in the prosecution of tactical-level military operations. The missions will occur independently or 
simultaneously in response to the CBRN threat or hazard, depending on whether tactical units 
are conducting CBRN operations while supporting CWMD objectives.

PROCESS 
5-7. CBRN consequence management goals focus the conduct of DOD operations and provide a common 
understanding of the purpose of CBRN consequence management. The method of response will use 
standing contingency plans and procedures to determine what forces and capabilities are required and 
committed in support of requests for assistance. 
5-8. CBRN consequence management includes planning, preparing for, responding to, and recovering 
from the consequences of CBRN incidents, no matter what their causes. Accidents may occur at chemical 
plants, nuclear power plants, or other facilities that have the potential for releasing CBRN material or 
during the transport of toxic industrial material. Intentional acts include the use of WMD by adversaries 
(global, regional, or nonstate), sabotage, and other acts of terrorism. CBRN materials present immediate 
and delayed hazards. In some instances, the delayed effects can cause greater problems for joint forces and 
may alter CBRN consequence management response activities.  
5-9. CBRN consequence management planning and preparation activities support the National Response 
Framework prevention efforts, while the response and recovery actions support the National Response 
Framework mitigation efforts. The four CBRN consequence management activities are (see figure 5-2, 
page 5-4)— 
 
Plan. Planning involves the assessment of the operational environment and enables commanders 
to identify minimum standards for training, organizing, equipping, and protecting resources. The 
response unit’s planning process drives preparation and facilitates response and recovery 
operations.  
 
Prepare. Preparation implements the approved plan and relevant agreements to increase 
readiness through training, exercises, and certification. Vulnerability reduction measures are 
initiated by the response unit to support prevention and mitigation functions.  
 
Respond. The respond process addresses the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response 
measures initiated by the response unit include those actions taken to save lives, prevent human 
suffering, protect property, and establish control. 
 
Recover. The response unit initiates the recover process, focusing on restoring mission 
capability and essential public and government services interrupted by the incident. The 
recovery phase also includes completing the mitigation of the immediate hazard. 
CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS 
5-10. An operational environment is a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that 
affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. DOD conducts CBRN 
consequence management operations in three operational environments: 
 
Defense support of civil authorities during a domestic response. This response includes 
assisting federal agencies within the United States and its territories and possessions according 
to guidance in the National Response Framework. DOD supports operations, within its 
capabilities, through liaison with the incident commander. 
 
Defense support to a foreign request. DOD supports the Department of State with operations 
originating from a foreign request. Tasks originate from the host nation through the Department 
of State. However, DOD commanders may take appropriate action in life-threatening situations 
while awaiting DOD or Department of State tasking. 
 
DOD-led operations. DOD leads the operational response for an incident involving U.S. forces 
and its allies across the operational environment. This also includes responding on a DOD 
installation.  
5-11. Depending on the threat and the political and physical environments of the consequence management 
response location, the operational environments may be further characterized as permissive, uncertain, or 
hostile. Given the nature of their actions, most consequence management response operations are 
conducted in a permissive environment.

RESPONDERS 
5-13. CBRN responders are DOD military and civilian personnel who are trained to respond to 
CBRN incidents and certified to operate safely at the awareness, operations, technician, or 
installation level according to Section 120, Part 1910, Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations and 
National Fire Protection Association 472. They may be responsible for tactical planning and the conduct 
of CBRN consequence management operations in domestic, foreign, or theater operational environments, 
including military installations. The levels of CBRN responders are— 
 
Awareness. Awareness level responders witness or discover a CBRN agent or hazmat release 
and are trained to initiate an emergency response sequence. They take no further action beyond 
notifying the authorities.  
 
Operations. Operations level responders react to releases or potential releases of CBRN agents 
or hazmat as part of the initial response to the site for the purpose of protecting nearby persons, 
property, or the environment from the effects of the release. They are trained to respond in a 
defensive fashion without actually trying to stop the release.

 
Technician. Technician level responders react to releases or potential releases of CBRN or 
hazmat for the purpose of mitigation.  
 
Installation. Installation level responders provide technical level expertise to the installation 
commander. They coordinate with internal and external agencies (including local, federal, and 
host nation governments) to provide emergency support for the installation. 
5-14. The incident commander is responsible for all aspects of an emergency response, to include quickly 
developing incident objectives, managing incident operations, applying resources, and assuming 
responsibility for persons involved. The incident commander sets priorities and defines the organization of 
the response teams and the overall incident action plan. The incident commander role may be assumed by a 
senior or higher-qualified officer upon his or her arrival or as the situation dictates. Even if subordinate 
positions are not assigned, the incident commander position is always designated or assumed.

Chapter 6 
Installation Emergency Management 
Installation CBRN protection consists of measures taken to anticipate, recognize, 
warn, evaluate, control, respond to, and recover from CBRN events in order to 
preserve life, prevent human suffering, mitigate an incident, protect critical assets, 
and maintain critical missions. The key elements of installation CBRN protection are 
detecting, assessing, warning, defending, and recovering. 
OVERVIEW 
6-1. Since 11 September 2001, installation protection has been a topic of increasing concern for the DOD. 
The overarching goal is to maintain DOD warfighting capabilities when under attack or after disruption. 
Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 2000.18 states “The Combatant Commanders and Services 
shall develop Service-wide scenarios designed to establish baseline capabilities needed to allow installation 
emergency responders to protect personnel and infrastructure, facilities, other assets, and identify 
vulnerabilities.”  
6-2. Historically, terrorist acts against U.S. interests have been committed abroad. However, the 
bombings of the World Trade Center in 1993 and the Murrah Federal Building in 1995, the attacks of 
September 2001, and the anthrax letter s of 2001 demonstrate the willingness of terrorists to also commit 
acts of violence against U.S. interests on American soil. In response, the DOD has begun to implement 
additional measures to address threats to the U.S. homeland and to U.S. military installations at home and 
abroad.  
6-3. The installation CBRN protection process relies on the persistent detection of threats in an integrated, 
shared understanding of the operational environment and timely dissemination of accurate decisions, 
warnings, and tasking that enable DOD installations and facilities to protect themselves against specific 
attacks and threats. Some installation CBRN protection capability requirements are— 
 
Detect and identify CBRN incidents on an installation. 
 
Issue a warning and report a CBRN attack and the presence of contamination. 
 
Protect personnel, maintain critical military missions, and resume essential operations. 
 
Provide appropriate medical protection, diagnosis, and treatment for CBRN effects. 
 
Be compatible with existing installation power and communication systems. 
 
Employ decision support tools. 
 
Ensure that all installation emergency response personnel are trained to respond to a terrorist 
CBRN attack. 
Note. Memorandums of understanding and agreement will determine the appropriate policy. 
6-4. Installations may not have the resources to support a separate, independent program developed 
exclusively for preparing for, responding to, and recovering from CBRN incidents. Therefore, installation 
CBRN protection must fit into the framework of an installation all-hazards emergency management 
program to be effective. Additionally, the ability to receive emergency support from, and provide mutual 
aid to, the local community depends on common response and incident management protocols developed 
for all hazards. Employing an all-hazards approach encourages interoperability; enables the effective use of 
resources; and protects critical operations, personnel, assets, and the environment during likely emergency 
events. An all-hazards approach to CBRN installation protection also facilitates the coordination of 
programs and resources resulting in rapid, effective response and hazard mitigation.

more information on installation CBRN protection. 
INSTALLATION OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT 
6-5. The installation operational environment is a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and 
influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. Some 
examples are— 
 
Permissive environment. An operational environment in which host country military and law 
enforcement agencies have the control, intent, and capability necessary to assist operations that a 
unit intends to conduct. 
 
Uncertain environment. An operational environment in which host government forces, whether 
opposed or receptive to operations that a unit intends to conduct, do not have totally effective 
control of the territory and population in the intended operational area. 
 
Hostile environment. An operational environment in which hostile forces have the control, 
intent, and capability necessary to effectively oppose or react to the operations that a unit intends 
to conduct. 
6-6. U.S. military installations support operational forces in domestic and foreign environments. The 
particular location of the installation is critical in determining the laws and regulations that must be applied 
and the level of military authority that the installation commander may have in determining response 
actions, including the level of personal protection for the response force.  
6-7. DODI 2000.21 defines foreign locations as any geographic area not reflected in the definition of 
domestic locations, and it lists the following as domestic locations:  
 
CONUS. 
 
Alaska. 
 
Hawaii. 
 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 
 
U.S. Virgin Islands. 
 
U.S. territories of Guam. 
 
American Samoa. 
 
Jarvis Island. 
 
Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands. 
 
Freely Associated States of Micronesia. 
 
Republic of Palau. 
 
Republic of the Marshall Islands. 
 
U.S. possessions of Wake Island. 
 
Midway Island. 
 
Johnston Island. 
 
Baker Island. 
 
Howland Island. 


FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42 
6-3 
6-8. An installation is a grouping of facilities that are located in the same vicinity and support particular 
functions. Installations may include, but are not limited to— 
 
Posts or bases. 
 
Ports (sea or air). 
 
Airfields. 
 
Base clusters. 
 
Staging areas. 
 
C2 nodes. 
 
Logistics nodes. 
 
Other facilities or fixed sites, including expeditionary bases and camps. 
6-9. An emergency management program consists of the following phases that can occur sequentially or 
simultaneously:  
 
Planning. 
 
Preparation. 
 
Response. 
 
Recovery. 
6-10. As discussed in Chapter 5, the U.S. military (due to its unique capabilities and resources) may also be 
asked to provide temporary, short-duration support to civil authorities during an emergency when local and 
state resources are overwhelmed.  
INSTALLATION COMMAND AND STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES 
6-11. The installation commander is responsible for establishing the installation CBRN defense plan, 
including threat assessment, vulnerability analysis and reduction, emergency response, and immediate 
recovery operations across the range of possible CBRN hazards. A summary of tasks is provided in table 
6-1, page 6-4. 
COORDINATION 
6-12. Responding to a CBRN emergency on an installation may require all first and emergency responder 
assets and may exceed the consequence management capabilities of organic installation resources. 
Installation commanders may require extensive federal, state, local, other Service, and/or private or host 
nation support to effectively respond to, and recover from, a CBRN emergency. Close liaison with these 
agencies and departments is essential before an emergency to ensure that civil authorities are responsive in 
protecting DOD resources. 
6-13. Each installation emergency operations center should be a National Incident Management System-
compliant, multiagency coordination system that uses the incident/unified command system’s 
organizational structure to provide a collaboration point and operations center for the installation staff. The 
emergency operations center supports the execution of the installation emergency management and 
antiterrorism plans, defense support of civil authorities, operational/contingency plans of assigned unit 
commanders, National Response Framework, and other supporting plans.

Note. Information management systems provided under installation protection focus primarily 
on providing critical information to installation decisionmakers and do not include automated 
reporting to higher command authorities. Information management system components provided 
under installation protection are intended to leverage preexisting telecommunications 
infrastructures at installations for connectivity. 
6-15. Figure 6-1, page 6-6, is a simplified, notional sequence of CBRN incident phases that illustrates 
when CBRN mitigation measures and supporting installation protection solutions would be implemented. 
Terrorist incidents involving CBRN hazards that occur within the United States, including those occurring 
on DOD installations and facilities, are addressed in the appropriate incident annexes of the National 
Response Framework. 
6-16. The incident annexes of the National Response Framework describe the concept of operations to 
address specific contingency or hazard situations that require emergency response. For installation 
emergency management purposes, the definition of an incident will be based on the appropriate National 
Response Framework definition.  
6-17. Installation CBRN protection solutions enhance mission assurance and consequence management 
efforts during the first 12 hours of a CBRN incident. It is assumed that the response and recovery activities 
of installations after the initial 12 hours will be supported largely by resources of national response 
organizations—which may not arrive at an affected installation until 6 to 12 hours after incident reporting. 
The response time depends on the time required for the resources to be mobilized, the location of the 
affected installation, and other situational factors.

6-18. The coordination of installation emergency management and CBRN solutions aims to improve the 
abilities of affected installations to stabilize attack effects for the short term, followed by the provision of 
national assistance to facilitate long-term community recovery. Emergency management solutions are not 
intended to facilitate the full recovery of installations to preincident conditions.  
COORDINATION ACTIVITIES WITH THE SERVICES 
6-19. Coordination activities between the installation emergency management staff, tenant commands, and 
representatives of organizations directly or indirectly supporting the installation commander focus on 
developing an installation level concept of operations and complementary protection concepts. Installation 
level, concept-of-operations development activities will aim to develop installation level emergency 
operations plan templates that are interoperable and leverage the capabilities of each Service colocated on 
an installation.  
COORDINATION ACTIVITIES WITH DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AGENCIES AND JOINT 
ORGANIZATIONS 
6-20. Installation emergency management staff members will liaise with DOD agencies who are managing 
programs and providing services to installations that are related to protection and CBRN consequence 
management, including— 
 
Defense Threat Reduction Agency for technical and operational reachback services. 
 
Defense Information Systems Agency for the development of complementary relationships with 
area security operations C2 applications and the certification and accreditation of installation 
information systems. 
 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for homeland defense. 
 
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health to address the provision of

COORDINATION ACTIVITIES WITH CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES 
6-21. Members of the installation emergency management staff will work with non-DOD agencies such as 
the Department of Homeland Security and local government agencies, where applicable, to leverage 
services provided through federal programs and existing consequence management capabilities of 
communities in proximity to installations. Specific activities with federal agencies include information 
sharing with— 
 
Domestic Nuclear Detection Office for radiation portal monitor testing and evaluation.  
 
Federal Emergency Management Agency for disaster management interoperability service to 
installations.  
 
Federal Bureau of Investigation for sample and evidence handling procedures.  
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 
6-22. Emergency management, as a subset of incident management, concerns the coordination and 
integration of activities that are necessary to build, sustain, and improve the capability to prepare 
for, protect against, respond to, recover from, or mitigate threatened or actual natural disasters, acts 
of terrorism, or other manmade disasters. Consequence management involves actions that are taken to 
maintain or restore essential services and manage and mitigate problems resulting from disasters and 
catastrophes, including natural, manmade, or terrorist incidents. 
6-23. The National Incident Management System and the National Response Framework provide 
overarching guidance for federal, state, and local governments to work effectively and efficiently to prepare 
for, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents, regardless of cause, size, or complexity. The 
construction of the National Incident Management System and National Response Framework focuses on 
the importance of a nationally mandated incident management system. Within the construct, the 
multiagency coordination system establishes nationally recognized coordination procedures that DOD 
emergency management entities use in partnership with local, state, and other federal agencies. The intent 
is to gain a higher level of cooperation between local, state, and federal (when required) assets.  
Note. Further information on the National Incident Management System and National Response 
Framework is located at <http://www.dhs.gov> and <http://www.fema.gov>. 
6-24. The ongoing threat of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil and the lessons learned as the nation has 
responded to multiple, large-scale natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, have reinforced the 
need to fully coordinate and integrate military and civilian consequence management at all levels of 
government. While cooperative arrangements between civilian and military agencies are commonplace, 
there is a need for improved coordination and integration of emergency management planning. 
6-25. Installation emergency management incorporates a number of existing civilian standards and 
guidelines, many of which are statutory, nonnegotiable, and applicable to disaster preparedness/emergency 
management and the specific issue of DOD installation CBRN incident response.  
6-26. In foreign settings, the Department of State is the primary agency for U.S. government foreign 
consequence management operations, unless otherwise directed by the President. Host nation requests for 
assistance and U.S. Government offers of assistance are made through the primary agency. The DOD 
recognizes that it may be directed to act as the primary agency for U.S. Government foreign consequence 
management operations by the President.

SUMMARY 
6-27. This chapter outlined installation CBRN protection, command and staff responsibilities for 
installation protection, and emergency management activities to protect DOD facilities worldwide, while 
integrating support from other government agencies. Installation CBRN protection also requires the 
integration of various support functions, including a CBRN defense plan that provides the “what” and 
“how” that define “when,” “where,” by “whom,” and in “what” manner that specific CBRN defense 
measures are conducted and coordinated.

Military Health System  
The military health system is a complex system of interdependent and interrelated 
systems that require synchronization and coordination at all levels of command. It is 
the primary intent of this chapter to enhance mission success by providing 
information for use by commanders who are responsible for the military health 
system in a CBRN environment. 
Note. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Health Service Support in 
a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environment for more information. 
OVERVIEW 
7-1. The military health system is responsible for the operational management of health service support 
and force health protection missions for training, predeployment, deployment, and postdeployment 
operations in a CBRN environment: 
 
Health service support. Health service support encompasses all services performed, and 
support provided or arranged, to promote, improve, conserve, or restore the mental and physical 
well-being of personnel.  
 
Force health protection. Force health protection encompasses preventive measures to promote, 
improve, or conserve the mental or physical well-being of Service members. These include 
preventive measures performed by dental, preventive medicine, behavioral health, and veterinary 
services. These measures enable a healthy and fit force, prevent injury and illness, and protect 
the force from health hazards, including CBRN effects.  
HEALTH SERVICE SUPPORT 
7-2. Commanders are responsible for maintaining the health of their commands to ensure mission 
accomplishment in the event of CBRN attacks. Maintaining the physiological and psychological health of 
military forces is a basic requirement for combat effectiveness. All commanders are faced with the 
possibility that any operation may have to be conducted in a CBRN environment.  
7-3. The component command surgeons are responsible for guiding and integrating all military health 
system capabilities available to the command to support mission accomplishment in a CBRN environment. 
In planning for health service support in potential CBRN environments, preparations should consist of 
planning for the effective quantification of contingency requirements for medical personnel; medical 
materiel stockpiles; patient transport or evacuation capabilities; and facilities needed for patient 
decontamination, triage, treatment, and supportive care applicable to the entire force (multinational, 
interagency, and civilian participants).  
FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION PLANNING 
7-4. Medical personnel must include the unique characteristics and effects of CBRN weapons/agents in 
their health service support and force health protection plans. Assessment and vulnerability reduction must 
also address the dangers posed by toxic industrial materials, including radiological contamination and other 
environmental contamination from industrial operations within the commander’s operational area. 
Particular care must be taken when identifying the nature of such hazards because, in many cases, standard 
military CBRN individual protective equipment will not provide the necessary protection. In some 
instances, avoiding the hazard may be the most effective or only course of action. In all circumstances, the 
Chapter 7 
7-2 
FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42 
1 July 2011 
commander should act to minimize immediate and long-term effects of toxic hazards, including low-level 
hazards, to health and mission objectives. 
7-5. Medical personnel should be trained to treat CBRN casualties and to operate in a CBRN 
environment. Force health protection measures are usually initiated before an attack and become 
vulnerability reduction measures. 
7-6. Force health protection against CBRN threats involves integrated intelligence, reconnaissance, and 
surveillance support from nonmedical units and the effective implementation of preventive medicine, 
health surveillance, and clinical programs. Pre- and postdeployment health assessment surveys provide a 
baseline and identify personnel who require long-term follow-up.  
7-7. Medical units and personnel must be afforded physical protection, such as individual protective 
equipment and collective protection systems, to shield them from exposure so that they can sustain the 
force through medical treatment. 
7-8. Medical countermeasures (such as vaccines, barrier creams, and other medical CBRN defense 
materiel) are identified based on the threat. These items help protect the force from injury or provide 
immediate life-saving treatment. 
7-9. Another often-overlooked force health protection measure is psychological preparedness. Training, 
information, and confidence can reduce the number of casualties caused by CBRN combat operations. 
MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE 
7-10. Accurate and timely all-source intelligence is a critical health service support tool for planning, 
preparing, executing, assessing, and sustaining military operations. A clear and commonly shared 
assessment of adversary CBRN capabilities and U.S., multinational, and host nation health service support 
capabilities and limitations in countering adversary CBRN use are of great importance. Therefore, a 
supporting intelligence element should exist in the medical unit chain of command.  
7-11. The health threat is a composite of ongoing or potential enemy actions; adverse environmental, 
occupational, geographic, and meteorological conditions; and endemic diseases that have the potential to 
affect the short- or long-term health (including psychological health) of personnel. Weapons or 
environmental conditions that produce qualitatively different wound or disease processes are also major 
health threats. Added to the combat operational, disease, and nonbattle injury health threats are the 
adversary’s use of the CBRN weapons, agents, and devices described in Chapter 1 and Appendix A. 
Medical readiness provides the means to mitigate these threats. Information provided by ongoing 
comprehensive health surveillance is critical to counter CBRN threats and supports passive defense and 
tactical surveillance for casualty prevention. 
7-12. The National Center for Medical Intelligence responds to requests from the U.S. armed forces for 
emergency, up-to-date medical intelligence assessments. It is the nation’s premier producer and coordinator 
of all-source medical intelligence. The National Center for Medical Intelligence produces intelligence for 
global and homeland health protection to safeguard U.S. interests worldwide and is an integral part of the 
Defense Intelligence Agency. 
7-13. The following specialized DOD organizations provide expert information resources on medical 
aspects of CBRN threats, casualty prevention, sample and specimen collections, and medical care and 
management of casualties: 
 
Defense Threat Reduction Agency. 
 
Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute. 
 
Naval Medical Research Center. 
 
U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. 
 
U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Chemical Defense. 
 
U.S. Army Nuclear and Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction Agency. 


7-3 
7-14. Accurate medical intelligence aids in the risk and vulnerability assessment processes by identifying 
hazards and developing measures to mitigate vulnerability. The fusion of medical intelligence with all-
source intelligence and other data sources enhances the integrated early warning of CBRN attacks. 
Note. For more information on medical intelligence, see the National Center for Medical 
Intelligence Web site at <http://afmic.detrick.army.mil> and the U.S. Army Center for Health 
Promotion and Preventive Medicine at <http://chppm-www.apgea.army.mil>. 
MEDICAL ESTIMATES 
7-15. Medical planner estimates (such as casualty, logistics, evacuation, and personnel cross leveling) must 
be modified for the CBRN environment. New decision support tools are under development and have 
various levels of capability to estimate the number and types of casualties from CBRN events. The data 
from these models can be used to develop medical estimates. Information such as the units affected, 
number of casualties, severity, and course of illness can be obtained in order to estimate the medical force 
structure and Class VIII supply (medical materiel) requirements and to develop and war-game medical 
support courses of action.  
7-16. The joint tool approved for calculating medical requirements is the joint medical analysis tool, which 
provides the capability to generate medical requirements for CBRN casualties. The Services are responsible 
for generating their respective casualty estimates and tracking casualty rates for contingency operations. 
Note. CBRN medical workload estimates can be found in NATO Standardization Agreements 
(STANAGs) 2475, 2476, 2477, and 2478. 
COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH SURVEILLANCE  
7-17. Health surveillance is the regular or repeated collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related 
data and the dissemination of information to monitor the health of a population and to identify potential 
risks to health, thereby enabling timely interventions to prevent, treat, or control disease and injury. It 
includes occupational and environmental health surveillance and medical surveillance. Deployment health 
surveillance includes identifying the deployed population at risk, recognizing and assessing potentially 
hazardous health exposures and conditions, employing specific preventive countermeasures, monitoring 
real-time health outcomes daily, and reporting disease and injury data appropriately.  
7-18. Medical surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data that is 
derived from medical care or evaluation. It includes the reporting of population-based information for 
characterizing and countering threats to a population’s health, well-being, and performance (such as disease 
and nonbattle injury reporting).  
7-19. Occupational and environmental health surveillance is the regular or repeated collection, analysis, 
archiving, interpretation, and dissemination of occupational and environmental health-related data (such as 
air monitoring for the detection of contaminants) that may impact the health of a population. It includes 
timely intervention to prevent, treat, or control the occurrence of disease or injury as necessary.  
Note. For more information, see Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 6490.02E, DODI 
6490.03, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) memorandum MCM 0028-07. 
7-20. Regardless of who conducts CBRN monitoring and sampling, the results must be documented and 
submitted via the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System data portal. It is 
imperative that suspected CBRN-related results be reported to the appropriate chains of command. Prompt 
epidemiological investigations must begin and preventive measures must be implemented to control the 
disease, start chemoprophylaxis, or reduce the number of cases. If required to submit information to 
Service-specific data collection systems, do so according to Service-specific instructions. Newly identified 
significant risks should be communicated to all appropriate organizations, including the Defense 
Intelligence Agency through the National Center for Medical Intelligence, joint task forces, combatant 
Chapter 7

commanders, Services, and Service occupational and environmental health centers. As operations allow, 
report sample results and risk assessments as quickly as possible to local medical units and the joint task 
force surgeon according to the theater policy (see DODI 6490.03, table E4.T4).  
7-21. The determination of unit-specific rates of illness and injuries of public health significance (including 
related CBRN casualties) is the foundation of these health surveillance programs. Disease, nonbattle injury, 
and battle injury rates are important risk management tools at the unit level. Abnormal rates and trends 
indicate that a problem may exist and negatively impact mission readiness; additional preventive medicine 
countermeasures may need to be implemented. Surveillance is closely integrated with the timely 
dissemination of data to those who are responsible for the prevention and control of disease and injury.  
Notes.  
1. Implementing guidance is found in DODI 6490.03.  
2. The establishment of uniform and standardized health surveillance and readiness procedures 
for all deployments is contained in DODD 6490.02E, DODI 6025.19, DODI 6490.03, and MCM 
0028-07.  
7-22. Combatant commanders must ensure compliance with the deployment health policy (for example, 
DODI 6490.03 and MCM 0028-07) as it relates to personnel exposed to CBRN hazards. The key aspects of 
policy requirements include— 
 
Identifying CBRN hazards and assessing personnel exposures using the military operational risk 
management process. 
 
Ensuring the communication of health risks to the population. 
 
Ensuring the reporting and archiving of exposure data and related medical information (disease 
and injury, reportable medical events, occupational and environmental health surveillance data). 
SAMPLING  
7-23. The collection of environmental and food samples is conducted by preventive medicine detachments, 
CBRN specialists, veterinary services personnel, public health officers, bioenvironmental engineers, or 
technical intelligence collection teams. Medical personnel in a clinic or hospital setting will collect 
radiation exposure information and clinical specimens (serum, blood, and other body fluids) and provide 
them to the laboratory for analysis. The collection team transports samples between the collection site and 
the laboratory analysis site. The laboratory team provides consultation, as needed, regarding the types and 
sources of samples/specimens to collect.  
7-24. Clinical specimen collection and laboratory analysis must be integrated into the sample analysis plan 
to aid in the rapid identification of CBRN agents. These procedures must also be regularly exercised.  
LABORATORY ANALYSIS 
7-25. Various types of laboratories  in CONUS and outside the continental United States (OCONUS) will 
use CBRN identification analysis systems, although in somewhat different ways, depending on the role and 
capabilities of the individual laboratory. Precisely which organizations will process which samples will be 
determined by the joint force commander, medical command, or medical treatment facility.  
PATIENT DECONTAMINATION AND TRIAGE  
7-26. Medical personnel must include the unique characteristics and effects of CBRN weapons/agents in 
their health service support and force health protection plans. Most essential medical care is rendered in a 
nontactical environment that is outside the area of immediate combat; however, triage, patient 
decontamination, and initial resuscitative care are necessary in the combat area. With the employment of 
CBRN weapons/agents, a mass casualty situation can present itself at any time and during any role of care. 
Treatment is often limited to life- or limb-saving care, and triage must be conducted within strict 
Military Health System  
1 July 2011 
FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42 
7-5 
guidelines. All casualties are decontaminated as far forward as the situation permits and must be 
decontaminated before they are admitted into a clean medical treatment facility.  
Note. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Health Service Support in a 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environment and Multiservice Tactics, 
Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) 
Decontamination for detailed information on patient decontamination and triage. 
MEDICAL TREATMENT  
7-27. The identification of chemical warfare agents greatly assists in the diagnosis and treatment of 
chemical injuries. Medical management consists of those procedures that optimize medical care to ensure 
the maximum return to duty on the battlefield, including triage, basic medical treatment, decontamination, 
emergency medical treatment, advanced trauma management, evacuation, and the continued protection of 
chemical warfare agent casualties.  
7-28. The impact of biological warfare agents on health service support may be as simple as a few 
casualties with diarrhea or as complex as a mass casualty situation. Biological warfare agents will most 
likely be delivered covertly and by aerosol. Compared with chemical warfare agents, most biological 
warfare agents have a long incubation period from exposure to the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, 
the first indication of a biological warfare attack will most likely be casualties arriving at a medical 
treatment facility with an illness. The treatment depends on the biological warfare agent used.  
7-29. The management of military casualties injured by the immediate effects of nuclear weapons (flash, 
blast, thermal) is the same as for conventional battlefield injuries, although the injury severity may be 
greater. First aid (self-aid, buddy aid, and combat lifesaver aid) is performed for lacerations, broken bones, 
and burns.  
Notes.  
1. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Treatment of Chemical Agent 
Casualties and Conventional Military Chemical Injuries for additional information on the 
treatment procedures for chemical warfare agent casualties. 
2. See Treatment of Biological Warfare Agent Casualties for more information on the treatment 
procedures for biological warfare agent casualties. 
3. See Treatment of Nuclear and Radiological Casualties for more information on the treatment 
procedures for nuclear and radiation casualties. 
PATIENT EVACUATION  
7-30. Patient treatment, patient evacuation, and the protection of medical staffs from exposure to CBRN 
agents are the core missions of medical personnel during a CBRN incident. A CBRN environment forces 
unit leaders to consider the extent of medical evacuation asset commitment to the contaminated area. The 
movement of CBRN-contaminated casualties can spread the contamination to clean areas. If the unit or task 
force is operating in a contaminated area, most or all of the organic medical evacuation assets will operate 
there. However, efforts should be made to keep some evacuation assets free of contamination.  
7-31. After the presence of CBRN agent/exposure has been confirmed and areas of contamination 
identified, subordinate commanders must decide the extent of medical evacuation assets that are not already 
contaminated during the attack. Depending on the situation, there may already be adequate numbers of 
vehicles, watercraft, and aircraft operating within the affected areas to transport the casualties. The full use 
of medical evacuation assets should be made, while keeping the safety and operational exposure of the 
personnel operating them in mind. All patients must be decontaminated before aeromedical evacuation.  
7-32. Patient movement in combat areas uses organic assets (personnel, surface vehicles, and aircraft) and 
is normally a Service responsibility. Due to the likelihood of mass casualties, the use of nonmedical 
Chapter 7 
7-6 
FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42 
1 July 2011 
evacuation assets must be planned. The combatant commander, with advice from the command surgeon, is 
responsible for moving patients within the theater and deciding the extent of evacuation asset commitment 
to contaminated areas. The commander of the U.S. Transportation Command establishes, operates, trains, 
and maintains a common-user, aeromedical evacuation system for intratheater and intertheater patient 
movement. The U.S. Transportation Command provides aeromedical evacuation support to operations. 
However, in a contaminated environment, the U.S. Transportation Command may limit the transportation 
of contagious/contaminated casualties. The commander of the U.S. Transportation Command, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the combatant commander, has waiver authority on the 
movement of contaminated/contagious patients. At this time, there is limited capability to move 
contaminated/contagious patients without undue risks to medical personnel and aircrew members. In the 
case of a contagious disease, it is DOD policy to move treatment forward to prevent the spread of disease. 
Note. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Health Service Support in a 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environment for more information on CBRN 
and conventional medical evacuation operations. 
MORTUARY AFFAIRS OPERATIONS 
7-33. If CBRN activity is suspected or present, commanders and health service support planners must have 
procedures in place for CBRN fatality management and must request mortuary affairs decontamination 
collection point support to perform recovery operations and the subsequent decontamination of remains. 
The joint mortuary affairs office acts as the theater central point of contact for coordination with the 
mortuary affairs decontamination collection point.  
7-34. Mortuary affairs personnel are responsible for coordinating the disposition of contaminated remains, 
including the decontamination of remains when required. In CBRN environments, medical personnel will 
coordinate with mortuary affairs personnel for the transport of contaminated remains from the medical 
treatment facility and the morgue. In coordination with appropriate CBRN and operational elements, 
preventive medicine personnel should help determine if remains are safe for normal processing or if they 
pose a residual CBRN hazard.  
7-35. Human remains from a CBRN environment may not be contaminated. Contamination depends on the 
type and form of agent, the conditions of the release, and/or the results from available monitoring 
equipment. Preventive medicine personnel should go through established military channels for reachback 
preventive medicine subject matter expertise (for example, U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and 
Preventive Medicine) to ascertain the most current guidance and criteria for decontamination verification. 
Medical personnel will monitor mortuary affairs personnel for any adverse health effects during mortuary 
affairs decontamination collection point operations. 
Note. The effective care and management of CBRN fatalities requires planning to process 
contaminated remains as discussed in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for 
Health Service Support in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environment. 
SUMMARY 
7-36. This chapter outlined the military health system support and challenges in a CBRN environment. 
Force health protection and health service support include emphasis on fitness, preparedness, and 
preventive measures; improvements in the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces engaged in 
military operations; and personnel awareness of the health threat before it affects the force. Maintaining the 
physiological and psychological health of military forces is a basic requirement for combat effectiveness.

Appendix A 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Hazards 
CBRN hazards exist in all operational environments, and commanders must decide 
the best course of action to cope with hazards that will place Service members in 
immediate danger. In biological and chemical warfare, “persistency” is the agent 
characteristic that pertains to the duration of its effectiveness under determined 
conditions after its dispersal. Persistency of the agent is critical to the duration and 
effects of chemical hazards. Other considerations include the type of agent used, the 
weather effects on the agent, and the agent affects on personnel and the environment.  
The commander’s first step in preparing for CBRN hazards is to complete a threat 
vulnerability assessment. The start point is intelligence reporting, which assesses the 
capability and intent of the adversary to deliver CBRN weapons for a given 
operational environment. Intelligence gathering, warning, and reporting are the tools 
that allow a commander to take action against CBRN attacks and avoid hazards 
associated with such attacks. As with any military operation, commanders must 
assess the situation in terms of the event and the level of personnel readiness to 
mitigate the effects of CBRN hazards.  
CHEMICAL HAZARDS 
A-1. Chemical hazards of concern to the military can be divided into the following categories:  
 
Chemical warfare agents. These are specific agents (such as nerve or blister) that are 
developed as military weapons and designed to kill or severely incapacitate personnel. Chemical 
warfare agents are generally considered lethal.  
 
Military chemical compounds (other than chemical warfare agents). These are chemical 
compounds that are developed, in part, for military use (riot control agents, smokes, obscurants), 
but not as weapons. Toxic properties are primarily associated with improper use.  
 
Toxic industrial chemicals. These are widely available, commercial chemicals that are acutely 
toxic and pose a risk of direct and immediate harm to personnel. These same chemicals are 
considered plausible candidates for terrorist activities. In general, the risk of a toxic industrial 
chemical being used as a weapon depends on the severity of effects that it may cause and the 
probability that it may be obtained and released in large quantities.  
A-2. U.S. forces frequently operate in environments where toxic materials are present, particularly toxic 
industrial chemicals, which can significantly interfere with campaigns. Toxic industrial chemicals may be 
released as gases, liquids, liquefied gases, or solids. The greatest concern to military operations is large 
numbers of personnel being exposed to a release of a significant vapor/gas plume of an acutely toxic 
industrial chemicals. The emission rate of a vapor/gas to the atmosphere largely depends on its physical 
state at the time of release. Toxic industrial chemicals that are stored/transported as liquefied gases are a 
key concern since a release typically involves large quantities of material and the resulting plume amount 
will be greater than that for liquids or compressed gases. The dissemination characteristics of toxic 
industrial chemicals are similar to those described for chemical agents. High concentrations may remain in 
buildings, woods, or any area that has low air circulation. Explosions may create and spread liquid hazards, 
and vapors may condense to liquids in cold air. 
A-3. If time and mission requirements permit, immediate evacuation outside the path of the hazard will 
eliminate or minimize the impact of the release. The greatest risk from a large-scale toxic chemical release 
occurs when personnel are unable to escape the immediate area and are overcome by vapors or blast 
Appendix A

effects. Military respirators and protective clothing may provide only limited protection against toxic 
industrial chemicals and may perform better or worse than similar commercial equipment.  
Note. For detailed information on toxic industrial chemical hazard exposure and response, 
consult the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine Technical Guide 
230, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Publication 2005-149, and the 
U.S. Department of Transportation 2008 Emergency Response Guidebook.  
A-4. When planning operations in areas where toxic materials may be present, the commander addresses 
these potential hazards as part of the intelligence preparation of the operational environment. These hazards 
could occur from a massive, deliberate or accidental release from an industrial site or a storage or transport 
container. Particular emphasis should be placed on toxic industrial chemicals that produce acute effects 
when inhaled because military respirators may not be effective. Commanders must be alert for potential 
hazards and must monitor for their release.  
A-5. Major rail transport, sea transfer, off-loading facilities, and production facilities may exist adjacent to 
or near many military installations. The purposeful release of material from these facilities may adversely 
impact military operations and personnel on the installation. The CBRN staff will use the most current 
combatant commander-classified toxic industrial chemicals list, the hazardous chemicals list, and site 
surveys to determine the priorities for protection against toxic industrial chemicals. Table A-1 identifies the 
physiological action and hazard effect of chemical warfare agents and military chemical compounds that 
are not considered to be chemical warfare agents.

Description 
Common Agents by Group 
Blister/ 
Vesicant 
A chemical agent that injures the eyes and lungs and 
burns or blisters the skin. Listed on Schedule 1, Chemical 
Weapons Convention. Sulfur mustards and arsenicals are 
considered key WMD threats. Urticants are considered 
possible, but not highly likely, WMD.  
Mustards 
• Sulfur mustard (H)  
• Distilled mustard (HD) 
• Nitrogen mustard (HN) 
• Thickened mustard (HT) 
Arsenicals 
• Lewisite (L) 
• Mustard lewisite (HL) 
Urticants 
• Phosgene oxime (CX) 
Physiological Action 
• Sulfur mustard and arsenicals. Inhalation, ocular, 
and contact hazard. Although sometimes referred to 
as mustard gas, these relatively persistent chemical 
warfare agents cause deoxyribonucleic acid 
(commonly known as DNA) changes at a cellular 
level, resulting in delayed (hours) occurrence of 
tissue damage to the eyes, lungs, and skin. Low 
vapor exposures may only cause eye irritation; 
higher levels and liquid contact can result in 
debilitating, fluid-filled blisters. While referred to as 
burns, these effects are not like an acid burn.  
• Urticants. Inhalation, ocular, and contact hazard. 
Not a true vesicant because they do not produce 
blisters; instead, contact produces solid lesions and 
tissue necrosis. The effect is somewhat similar to a 
strong acid reaction.  
Chemical Hazard Effect 
Target of Choice: Persistent blister; personnel, terrain, 
material, logistics, and C2 facilities. 
Target Effects: Persistent blister; operations tempo 
reduction and mission degradation; lethal or casualty-
producing.  
Blood 
A chemical compound, including the cyanide group, that 
affects bodily functions by preventing the normal 
utilization of oxygen by body tissues. Also identified as 
priority toxic industrial chemicals. 
Cyanides 
• Cyanogen chloride (CK) 
• Hydrogen cyanide (AC) 
Other 
• Arsine (SA) 
Physiological Action 
• Inhalation hazard. Cyanides prevent the normal 
transfer of oxygen from blood to body tissues. Arsine 
causes hemolysis of red blood cells.  
Chemical Hazard Effect 
Target of Choice: Nonpersistent; personnel.  
Target Effects: Nonpersistent; quick-acting casualty agent 
that is potentially deadly.

Description 
Common Agents by Group 
Choking 
Agents that attack lung tissue (primarily causing 
pulmonary edema), cause irritation to the eyes, and 
damage the respiratory tract. Also identified as priority 
toxic industrial chemicals. 
Phosgene (CG) 
Diphosgene (DP) 
Physiological Action 
• Inhalation hazard. These chemicals attack and 
damage lung tissue. At high levels, membranes 
swell, lungs become filled with liquid (pulmonary 
edema), and death results from the lack of oxygen, 
thus choking an unprotected person. Fatalities of 
this type are called dry-land drowning.  
Chemical Hazard Effect 
Target of Choice: Personnel. 
Target Effects: Potentially lethal casualty agent. 
Incapacitant 
A chemical agent that produces temporary disabling 
conditions. Unlike those caused by riot control agents, 
effects can be physical or mental and persist for hours or 
days after exposure to the agent has ceased. Not 
generally considered likely WMD. 
Deliriant 
• 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate 
(BZ)  
Stimulant 
• Amphetamines 
• Cocaine 
• Metrazole 
Depressant 
• Morphine 
• Barbituates 
• Fentanyls 
Psychedelic 
• Lysergic acid 
diethylamide (LSD) 
• Phencyclidine (PCP) 
Physiological Action 
Incapacitating agents differ from other chemical warfare 
agents in that they are not designed to cause serious, 
permanent or lethal effects. They are designed to interfere 
with higher functions of the brain (attention, orientation, 
judgment) to render individuals incapable of concerted 
efforts in the performance of assigned duties. 
Chemical Hazard Effect 
Target of Choice: Personnel. 
Target Effects: The inability to perform any military task 
effectively.  
Riot Control 
Agent 
Less-lethal lachrymatory (tearing) agents produced or 
sold commercially and used by a variety of law 
enforcement personnel and military forces. Not 
considered chemical warfare agents or likely WMD. 
O-hlorobenzylidene (CS) 
Dibenz (b,f)-1:4-oxazepine 
(CR)  
Mace or tear gas (CN) 
Bormobenzylcyanide (CA) 
Capsaicin or pepper spray 
(OC) 
Physiological Action 
Can rapidly produce sensory irritation or disabling 
physical effects that usually disappear within 15 minutes 
(tear gas) and up to 2 hours (pepper spray). Riot control 
agents are of limited toxicity by design; however, some 
are more toxic and/or persistent than others. For example, 
Mace® or tear gas and bormobenzylcyanide are 
particularly toxic and not in the U.S. military inventory. 
Pepper spray is sold with varying potency. 
Chemical Hazard Effect 
Target of Choice: Personnel. 
Target Effects: Short-term inability to perform tasks 
effectively.

Description 
Common Agents by Group 
Lung/ 
Respiratory 
Irritant 
Previously referred to as “vomiting agents” although their 
primary effect is irritation of the lungs and respiratory 
tract. Chlorine is considered a chemical warfare agent 
due to its prominent intentional use during World War I. It 
was also used in 2007 to intentionally cause harm during 
conflicts in Iraq. Because of its toxicity and wide 
commercial availability, chlorine is a priority, acutely toxic 
industrial chemical. It is not considered to be a likely 
WMD  
Chlorine (CI) 
Adamsite (DM) 
Diphenylchloroarsine (DA) 
Diphenylcyanoarsine (DC) 
Physiological Action 
• Chlorine. Primarily lung irritants; highly volatile and 
acutely toxic via inhalation.  
• All others. The irritation effects (cough; burning in 
nose, throat, and chest) are slightly delayed 
(minutes) after exposure and can be followed with 
systemic effects such as headaches, vomiting, and 
diarrhea.  
Chemical Hazard Effect 
Target of Choice: Personnel. 
Target Effects: Intended purpose is to penetrate the 
canister, forcing personnel to remove their masks and be 
exposed to more toxic materials. 
Smoke/ 
Obscurant 
Generated or projected particulants. Smoke and 
obscurants have long been employed by the military as a 
means of concealing battlefield targets. Smoke is an 
aerosol that owes its ability to obscure to its composition 
of many small particles suspended in the air. These 
particles scatter or absorb the light, reducing visibility. 
Hexachloroethane (HC) 
White phosphorous (WP) 
Red phosphorous (RP) 
Fog oil smoke 
Titanium tetrachloride (FM) 
smoke 
Signaling smoke 
Physiological Action 
Most smokes are not hazardous in the concentrations that 
are useful for obscurant purposes. However, high 
concentrations and long durations in smoke may be 
hazardous to the eyes and respiratory tract. 
Hazard Effect 
Target of Choice: Personnel, terrain, infrastructure, and 
buildings. 
Target Effects: To conceal or obscure targets.  
BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS 
A-6. Biological agents are dispersed or employed as pathogens or toxins that cause disease in personnel, 
animals, and plants. Pathogens require an incubation period to establish themselves in the body of a host 
and produce disease symptoms. The onset of visible symptoms may occur days or weeks after exposure. 
Some toxins can remain active for extended periods in the natural environment. This stability creates a 
persistent transfer hazard. Unlike chemical, radiological, and nuclear hazards, biological hazards are 
unpredictable; and it is difficult to classify the extent of the hazard. 
A-7. The operational considerations for biological agents are— 
 
Dissemination. Biological agents may be dispersed or deposited as aerosols, liquid droplets, or 
dry powders. Live microorganisms usually grow in a moist environment; therefore, these agents 
may be disseminated in a liquid medium as wet aerosols. However, microbiological materials 
may also be stored and released in more stable powder mediums. In general, agents dispersed as 
dry powder will survive longer than those dispersed as wet aerosols.

1 July 2011 
 
Persistency. The persistency of biological agents varies greatly and depends on specific agent 
characteristics and environmental conditions. These conditions include solar (ultraviolet) 
radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and temperature gradient. Ultraviolet light accelerates 
the decay of most biological agents. However, encapsulation or genetic engineering may protect 
agents from natural decay and increase their persistency.  
 
Immunization. All personnel must have current immunizations for the diseases known to exist 
in the area where they are operating. Commanders must review the intelligence threat and 
identify the biological warfare agents that are posing a threat in the current operational 
environment. The knowledge of short- and long-term exposure effects of these biological 
warfare agents is key because physiological symptoms may be indicators of biological hazards, 
especially if accompanied by illness that is not due to a natural epidemic. Table A-2 outlines the 
classification of biological agents.

Description 
Pathogens 
Pathogens are also referred to as 
“infectious agents.” The primary 
biological warfare pathogens are 
disease-causing bacteria, viruses, 
and rickettsia. These broad 
categories or classes include a 
variety of microorganisms that may 
be free-living or require host cells to 
replicate and persist. They enter the 
body through the lungs, digestive 
tract, skin, or mucous membranes of 
body openings. Once they enter the 
body, they multiply and overcome the 
body’s natural defenses. Pathogens 
are naturally occurring, and outbreaks 
of disease may occur spontaneously 
in specific regions of the world. 
Certain pathogens, but not all of 
them, may spread between people. 
Bacteria 
Bacteria are microorganisms that 
are capable of reproduction 
outside living cells. They may be 
found in almost any environment. 
Bacteria enter the body through 
the lungs or digestive tract and will 
multiply and possibly incapacitate 
the host if proper treatment is not 
provided. They often respond to 
antibiotics.  
Rickettsia 
Rickettsia are bacteria that are 
unable to multiply unless they are 
inside a living cell. Most rickettsia 
spread via insect vector. 
Virus 
Viruses replicate inside a cell and 
take over the cellular metabolism, 
causing it to produce additional 
viruses instead of normal cellular 
activity. After producing hundreds 
to thousands of virus particles, the 
host cell is often destroyed as 
these particles are released (a 
process known as lysis). Viruses 
are much smaller than bacteria, 
ranging from 0.02–0.2 microns, 
and normally do not respond to 
antibiotics. Certain viruses may 
respond to antiviral compounds, 
but there are few of these 
available.

Description 
Toxin 
Toxins are essentially chemical 
poisons that are produced by, or 
extracted from, living organisms 
(bacteria, fungi, animals). Some 
microbial toxins are only released or 
created once the microorganism has 
been internalized/metabolized in the 
human body. Toxins exert their lethal 
or incapacitating effects by interfering 
with certain cell and tissue functions. 
They can produce a wide variety of 
signs and symptoms that are often 
similar to those associated with 
exposure to chemical agents. While 
toxins cannot spread from person to 
person, their toxicity can be much 
greater than that of nerve agent VX, 
the most toxic chemical warfare 
agent. Botulinium is considered one 
of the most toxic substances known. 
Neurotoxin 
Neurotoxins disrupt nerve 
impulses. Like nerve agents, 
neurotoxins may cause paralysis 
or convulsive seizures that lead to 
coma and death.  
Cytotoxin 
Cytotoxins destroy cells by 
disrupting cell respiration and 
metabolism. They may cause 
vomiting, diarrhea, choking, 
blistering, radiation-like 
symptoms, weakness, coma, and 
death. 
RADIOLOGICAL HAZARDS 
A-8. The Services are responsible for enforcing precautions and establishing tactics, techniques, and 
procedures for handling conventional munitions that employ radioactive materials, such as depleted 
uranium. This includes enforcing standards that protect personnel against alpha particle inhalation and 
ingestion and external beta, gamma, and neutron exposure. In addition, dangerous levels of radiation can 
result from damaged industrial radiation hazard areas. Due to the downwind hazards that such damage can 
produce, avoidance is the most effective individual and unit protective measure against industrial radiation 
hazards. 
NUCLEAR HAZARDS 
A-9. The severity of nuclear hazards depends on the weapon yield, emission spectrum, and distance to the 
target. Residual radiation effects are due to emissions (typically, alphas, betas, and low-energy gammas) 
from fission fragments (heavy atom products produced during fission) and activated environmental 
materials (material that absorbs radiation and become radioactive itself). Collectively, these sources are 
called fallout. Table A-3, page A-8, shows the typical effects of nuclear weapons. 
Note. See Multiservice Tactics Techniques and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance for more information on nuclear hazards.

Target Effects 
Blast 
Crushes, deforms, tumbles, shocks, and creates missiles and 
obstacles. 
Thermal radiation 
Causes fires, burns, and eye damage. 
Electromagnetic pulse and 
high-altitude, electromagnetic 
pulse 
Causes permanent or temporary impairment of electrical, electro-
optical, and electronic equipment. 
Transient radiation 
Affects electronics systems and associated circuitry, including radios 
and computers. Through a high-altitude, low-yield surface or a near-
surface (low-air) burst, transient radiation may reach targets that are 
not damaged by blast and thermal radiation. 
Ionizing radiation 
Can destroy human cells and lead to severe illness or death due to 
acute radiation doses from initial or residual radiation. Intense 
ionizing can damage objects, including optical, mechanical, and 
electronic components by altering their physical properties. 
Potassium iodine 
May be used to protect the thyroid from radioactive iodine in the 
event of an accident or attack at a nuclear power plant or another 
nuclear attack, especially where volatile radionuclides (which contain 
significant amounts of iodine 131) are released into the environment. 
Fallout 
Can remain at lethal levels for extended periods of time. Ionizing 
radiation and electromagnetic pulse produce residual radiation. 
Radioactive material dispersal creates widespread hazards and limits 
military operations.

Treaties and Agreements 
The proliferation environment is dynamic, and proliferation activities are influencing 
the CWMD agenda. Alone, the United States cannot prevent the proliferation of 
CBRN capabilities, but we have achieved significant reductions by supporting 
international policies and participating in international agreements and treaties and 
multilateral initiatives. For example, because illicit trafficking in CBRN materials 
represents a serious threat to the security of individual states and the international 
community, treaties such as the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and Chemical 
Weapons Convention have been established to provide international standards by 
which the global community can gauge and address the activities of potential 
proliferators. The Armed Forces of the United States support these policies and 
strategies within their respective roles and functions. They plan and conduct 
operations to overcome complex simultaneous challenges involving adversaries who 
may be armed with CBRN weapons and pose threats to homeland security and 
CONUS and OCONUS military forces and installations. While any given threat or 
operation may be focused in a particular overseas region, the adversary may have the 
motivation and means to extend the conflict to other regions, including U.S. territory. 
This appendix contains brief descriptions of treaties, legal statutes, and policy 
strictures on the proliferation, testing, possession, and employment of CBRN 
weapons. 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION 
B-1. Arms control and nonproliferation treaties and regimes establish global norms against the 
proliferation of WMD precursors, weapons, their means of delivery, and weapons-manufacturing 
equipment. Currently, there are 187 state parties that are members of the Chemical Weapons Convention, 
which prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. The Chemical 
Weapons Convention does not prohibit the production, processing, consumption, or trade of related 
chemicals for peaceful purposes; but it does establish a verification regime to ensure that such activities are 
consistent with the objective and purpose of the treaty.  
B-2. The Chemical Weapons Convention is enforced through the Organisation for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons, which ensures that all state parties adhere to the articles of the convention and follow 
the constraints outlined in the articles. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons monitors 
elimination operations or the transformation of chemical production facilities and chemical weapons 
stockpiles. 
B-3. The Chemical Weapons Convention is the first multilateral arms control and nonproliferation treaty 
to widely affect the private sector. Although the United States does not manufacture chemical weapons and 
is in the process of destroying its stockpile, it does produce, process, consume, export, and import a number 
of dual-use toxic chemicals and precursors that can be used to produce chemical weapons. The U.S. 
companies who are engaged in activities involving these chemicals may be required to submit declarations 
and/or reports to the Bureau of Industry and Security and may be subject to inspection by the Organisation 
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. In addition, trade in certain chemicals with states who are not 
party to the Chemical Weapons Convention may be prohibited or subject to an export license and/or end-
use certificate.

Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of 
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and 
on Their Destruction 
Signed at London, Moscow and Washington on 10 April 1972. 
Entered into force on 26 March 1975. 
Depositaries: UK, US and Soviet governments. 
The States Parties to this Convention, 
Determined to act with a view to achieving effective progress towards general and complete disarmament, 
including the prohibition and elimination of all types of weapons of mass destruction, and convinced that the 
prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons 
and their elimination, through effective measures, will facilitate the achievement of general and complete 
disarmament under strict and effective international control,  
Recognizing the important significance of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, 
Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, signed at Geneva on June 17, 1925, and 
conscious also of the contribution which the said Protocol has already made, and continues to make, to 
mitigating the horrors of war,  
Reaffirming their adherence to the principles and objectives of that Protocol and calling upon all States to comply 
strictly with them,  
Recalling that the General Assembly of the United Nations has repeatedly condemned all actions contrary to the 
principles and objectives of the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925,  
Desiring to contribute to the strengthening of confidence between peoples and the general improvement of the 
international atmosphere,  
Desiring also to contribute to the realization of the purposes and principles of the United Nations,  
Convinced of the importance and urgency of eliminating from the arsenals of States, through effective measures, 
such dangerous weapons of mass destruction as those using chemical or bacteriological (biological) agents,  
Recognizing that an agreement on the prohibition of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons represents a 
first possible step towards the achievement of agreement on effective measures also for the prohibition of the 
development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons, and determined to continue negotiations to that 
end, 
Determined for the sake of all mankind, to exclude completely the possibility of bacteriological (biological) agents 
and toxins being used as weapons,  
Convinced that such use would be repugnant to the conscience of mankind and that no effort should be spared 
to minimize this risk, 
Have agreed as follows:  
Article I  
Each State Party to this Convention undertakes never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or 
otherwise acquire or retain:

TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
B-7. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons aims to prevent the spread of nuclear 
weapons and weapons technology, to foster the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and to further the goal of 
disarmament. The treaty establishes a safeguard system under the responsibility of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, which also plays a central role under the treaty in areas of technology transfer for peaceful 
purposes. Figure B-4 lists key excerpts from this treaty.  
Note. For a full list of all 15 articles , see the International Atomic Energy Agency Web site at 
<http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf>. 
ARTICLE I 
Each nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever 
nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices 
directly, or indirectly; and not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to 
manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or control over such 
weapons or explosive devices.  
ARTICLE II 
Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transfer 
or whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or 
explosive devices directly, or indirectly; not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other 
nuclear explosive devices; and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons 
or other nuclear explosive devices. 
ARTICLE III 
1. Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes to accept safeguards, as set forth in an 
agreement to be negotiated and concluded with the International Atomic Energy Agency in accordance with 
the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Agency’s safeguards system, for the 
exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfillment of its obligations assumed under this Treaty with a view to 
preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive 
devices. Procedures for the safeguards required by this Article shall be followed with respect to source or 
special fissionable material whether it is being produced, processed or used in any principal nuclear facility 
or is outside any such facility.  
2. Each State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide: (a) source or special fissionable material, or (b) 
equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special 
fissionable material, to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes, unless the source or special 
fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this Article.

COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR-TEST-BAN TREATY  
B-8. A comprehensive test ban treaty is the cornerstone of the international regime on the nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons and the oldest item on the nuclear arms control agenda. The test ban will constrain the 
development and qualitative improvement of current nuclear weapons and the development of new nuclear 
weapons. It also mandates a broad, thorough monitoring regime with an intrusive verification regime that 
permits on-site inspections if treaty breaches are suspected. The comprehensive test ban treaty prohibits all 
nuclear explosions for military or civilian purposes in all environments. The treaty opened for signature in 
New York on 24 September 1996; it was signed by 71 states, including five of the eight states that were 
nuclear-capable at that time.  
B-9. The Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization has 
oversight of the treaty and is responsible for establishing the global verification regime. The verification 
regime consists of an international monitoring system that is supported by an international data center. The 
monitoring system comprises a network of 321 monitoring stations and 16 radionuclide laboratories that 
monitor the earth for the evidence of nuclear explosions.

PROLIFERATION SECURITY INITIATIVE 
B-11. The Proliferation Security Initiative is a global initiative that is aimed at stopping shipments of 
WMD, their delivery systems, and related materials worldwide. The initiative was announced by President 
George W. Bush on 31 May 2003 in response to the National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass 
Destruction, which was issued in December 2002. That strategy recognizes the need for more robust tools 
to defeat the worldwide proliferation of WMD and specifically identifies interdiction as an area where 
greater focus will be placed.  
B-12. In September 2003, 11 countries agreed to and published the Interdiction Principles for the 
Proliferation Security Initiative. This set of principles identifies specific steps for effectively interdicting 
WMD shipments and preventing proliferation facilitators from engaging in this deadly trade. Participation 
in the Proliferation Security Initiative is voluntary, and support for the Proliferation Security Initiative is an 
acknowledgment of the need for stronger measures to defeat proliferators through cooperation with other 
countries. 
B-13. The Proliferation Security Initiative is a set of activities, not a formal treaty-based organization. It is 
best understood as a set of partnerships that establishes the basis for cooperation on specific activities when 
the need arises. It does not create formal obligations for participating states, but does represent a political 
commitment to establish best practices to stop proliferation-related shipments.  
B-14. The goal of the Proliferation Security Initiative is to create a more dynamic, creative, and proactive 
approach to preventing proliferation to or from nation-states and nonstate actors of proliferation concern. 
Actions will be taken in support of the Proliferation Security Initiative, consistent with national legal 
authorities and relevant international laws and frameworks. The Proliferation Security Initiative seeks to 
use existing authorities—national and international—to defeat proliferation. 
B-15. The Proliferation Security Initiative focuses on establishing greater coordination among its partner 
states and promoting readiness to act effectively when a particular action is needed. Actual interdictions 
will likely involve only a few Proliferation Security Initiative participants with geographic and operational 
access to a particular Proliferation Security Initiative target of opportunity. Interdiction training exercises 
and other operational efforts will help states work together in a more cooperative, coordinated, and 
effective manner to stop, search, and seize shipments. 
Note. For more information about the Proliferation Security Initiative, see the U.S. Department 
of State’s Web site at <http://www.state.gov/t/isn/c10390.htm>. 
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION AGREEMENTS 
B-16. NATO is an alliance of 26 countries from North America and Europe who are committed to fulfilling 
the goals of the North Atlantic Treaty that was signed on 4 April 1949. NATO provides a forum in which 
the United States, Canada, and European countries can consult together on security issues of common 
concern and take joint action in addressing them. 
B-17. NATO’s military structure is a multinational force planning, organization, and command system. It 
provides joint planning, training, exercising, and operations under the command of NATO’s strategic 
commanders. As the nature of threats change, NATO is reorienting its defense capabilities toward today’s 
threats by adapting its forces and developing new, multinational approaches to deal with terrorism, failed 
states, and other security threats such as WMD. All NATO decisions are made by consensus, after 
Appendix B  
B-10 
FM 3-11/MCWP 3-37.1/NWP 3-11/AFTTP 3-2.42 
1 July 2011 
discussion and consultation among member countries. Consensus decisionmaking means that there is no 
voting at NATO; consultations continue until a decision is reached that is acceptable to everyone. 
B-18. Extensive efforts are made to improve cooperation and to eliminate duplication in the research, 
development, production, procurement, and logistics support of defense systems, primarily through the use 
of STANAGs. Standardization makes a vital contribution to the combined operational effectiveness of the 
military forces of the alliance and enables the exploitation of opportunities to make better use of economic 
resources. STANAGs are developed and promulgated by the NATO Military Agency for Standardization in 
conjunction with the Conference of National Armaments directors and other authorities concerned. 
B-19. The implementation of STANAGs helps countries achieve required levels of interoperability; better 
accomplish their common strategic, operational, and tactical tasks; understand and execute command 
procedures; and employ techniques and materiel more efficiently. 
B-20. The principal forum for the elaboration of standardization policy is the NATO Standardization 
Organization, which aims to incorporate standardization as an integral part of alliance planning and acts as 
a coordinator between senior NATO bodies addressing standardization requirements. The NATO 
Standardization Organization comprises the NATO Committee for Standardization, NATO Standardization 
Staff Group, and NATO Standardization Agency. The NATO Standardization Organization’s role is to 
enhance interoperability and contribute to the ability of alliance forces to train, exercise, and operate 
effectively, together and with the forces of partner countries and other non-NATO countries, in the 
execution of their assigned tasks.  
Note. For current information on STANAGs, visit the NATO Web site at <http://www.nato.int/ 
docu/standard.htm>. 
QUADRIPARTITE STANDARDIZATION AGREEMENT 
B-21. The American, British, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand Armies’ Program has been in place 
since 1947 and is instrumental to ensuring interoperability and commonality of equipment among the 
program’s forces. In terms of nonproliferation to combat WMD, counterproliferation to combat WMD, and 
consequence management, gathering and sharing information and intelligence among strategically located 
member states clearly supports the three pillars of the National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass 
Destruction. Today, the focus of the program is on interoperability—the ability of alliance forces, and 
when appropriate, forces of partner and other nations, to train, exercise, and operate effectively together in 
the execution of assigned missions and tasks. 
B-22. The mission of the American, British, Canadian, Australian Armies’ Program is to optimize 
interoperability through cooperation and collaboration in the continuous pursuit of standardization and 
mutual understanding in order to integrate the capabilities of the program armies in multinational 
operations. The benefits are being realized through enormous cost savings in all of the armies and in the 
increased operational readiness rates for deployed military personnel. Although this effort has been aimed 
at interoperability and commonality among the armies, several activities that originated under the 
Quadripartite Working Group have been expanded to include interoperability among all NATO nations.  
Note. For more information, see the American, British, Canadian, Australian Armies’ Program 
Web site at <http://www.abca-armies.org>.  
AIR AND SPACE INTEROPERABILITY COUNCIL 
B-23. The Air and Space Interoperability Council, formed in 1948 and previously known as the Air 
Standardization Coordinating Committee, is an active and productive international organization that works 
for the air forces of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States of 
America. Its principal objective is to ensure that member nations are able to fight side by side as airmen in 
joint and multinational operations. The Air and Space Interoperability Council objectives are achieved by 
the standardization of doctrine, operational procedures, material, and equipment. The council also

exchanges technical information and arranges the free loan of equipment between member nations for test 
and evaluation purposes. The results of these tests are usually distributed to all member nations.  
Note. For more information, see the Air and Space Interoperability Council Web site at 
<http://www.dtic.mil/asic/>. 
RIOT CONTROL AGENTS AND HERBICIDES  
B-24. Since the end of the Cold War, conflicts have become increasingly intrastate, and civilians and 
combatants have become far more intermixed. In order to be prepared for the full spectrum of conflict, the 
U.S. military and law enforcement officers must be equipped and trained to deal with nonstate actors and 
their tactics. The pressure to do this in a humane way logically leads to a desire for nonlethal weapons. The 
development and use of nonlethal weapons is a legitimate approach to this new security environment and 
military structure. Chemical-derived riot control agents represent one type of nonlethal weapon.  
B-25. Commanders must clearly understand the appropriate uses of riot control agents and herbicides, 
especially in light of their classification under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Combatant 
commanders must be aware of the views of states that are party to the Chemical Weapons Convention and 
anticipate the potential impact of the use of riot control agents and herbicides by U.S. forces. The Chemical 
Weapons Convention states that the use of riot control agents is acceptable for law enforcement activities. 
The definition of law enforcement should mean domestic law enforcement within the recognized, sovereign 
borders of a country and activities undertaken in conjunction with a United Nations mandate. In other 
words, riot control agents should only be used in a state’s own jurisdiction, unless otherwise deemed 
permissible by the United Nations. All other use must be deemed an act of warfare, which is specifically 
prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention. The use of riot control agents is not limited or restricted 
under other conditions, such as training and peacetime riot control around U.S. bases and installations.  
RIOT CONTROL AGENTS AND HERBICIDES POLICY 
B-26. The global community classifies riot control agents as chemical agents that are prohibited under the 
terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The United States ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention 
in April 1997; however, we do not consider riot control agents to be chemical agents. The United States 
maintained this position consistently throughout Chemical Weapons Convention negotiations, and our 
position is understood by the global community. The use of herbicides in war or military combat operations 
is also prohibited and requires Presidential approval for domestic use to control vegetation on U.S. bases 
and installations and around immediate defensive perimeters.  
B-27. A riot control agent is any chemical not listed in a schedule, which can produce rapidly in humans 
sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of 
exposure. The point that a riot control agent must be classified as a chemical is not included in the 
schedules published by the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Organisation for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons. These schedules essentially classify chemicals according to their toxicity and dual-use 
applicability in order to prevent their use as weapons. For example, a Schedule 1 chemical is toxic and has 
little to no industrial application, whereas a Schedule 3 chemical can be weaponized and has a broad 
peaceful application. 
B-28. The United States renounces the first use of riot control agents in war except when they are used 
defensively to save lives. The use of riot control agents is not governed by the same policy as chemical 
agents. Riot control agents are not used to injure or kill, and their effects are short-lived; consequently, 
situations arise when using them is more appropriate than using conventional weapons.  
B-29. The United States also renounces the first use of herbicides in war except when they are used to 
control vegetation on U.S. bases and installations. Herbicides can also be used around the immediate 
defensive perimeters to clear observation and fields of fire. They have the potential to destroy food 
production and defoliate large areas.

B-30. Presidential Executive Order 11850 (figure B-5) prescribes policy for the use of chemical herbicides 
and riot control agents. Commanders should consult their legal advisors on the implementation of this 
policy on a case-by-case basis. 
Executive Order 11850—Renunciation of certain uses in war of chemical herbicides and riot control 
agents 
The United States renounces, as a matter of national policy, first use of herbicides in war except use, under 
regulations applicable to their domestic use, for control of vegetation within U.S. bases and installations or 
around their immediate defensive perimeters, and first use of riot control agents in war except in defensive 
military modes to save lives such as: 
(a) Use of riot control agents in riot control situations in areas under direct and distinct U.S. military control, 
to include controlling rioting prisoners of war. 
(b) Use of riot control agents in situations in which civilians are used to mask or screen attacks and civilian 
casualties can be reduced or avoided. 
(c) Use of riot control agents in rescue missions in remotely isolated areas, of downed aircrews and 
passengers, and escaping prisoners. 
(d) Use of riot control agents in rear echelon areas outside the zone of immediate combat to protect convoys 
from civil disturbances, terrorists and paramilitary organizations. 
I have determined that the provisions and procedures prescribed by this Order are necessary to ensure 
proper implementation and observance of such national policy. 
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by 
the Constitution and laws of the United States and as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the 
United States, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1. The Secretary of Defense shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the use by the Armed 
Forces of the United States of any riot control agents and chemical herbicides in war is prohibited unless 
such use has Presidential approval, in advance. 
Section 2. The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe the rules and regulations he deems necessary to 
ensure that the national policy herein announced shall be observed by the Armed Forces of the United 
States.

Appendix C 
Basic Standards of Proficiency 
Service commanders and their staffs at the tactical level must be capable of surviving 
CBRN attacks and continuing operations in hazardous conditions. This appendix 
discusses the basic standards of proficiency delineated in STANAG 2150 for 
individuals, selected personnel, CBRN staff, commanders, and organizations. This 
appendix also discusses the medical CBRN training requirements established in 2004 
under the direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. 
Note. This appendix is the implementation of standards of proficiency as it reads in 
STANAG 2150. 
BASIC STANDARDS OF PROFICIENCY FOR INDIVIDUALS 
C-1. Individuals must be trained in the concepts of CBRN defense in order to survive a CBRN-related 
attack and contribute to the survivability and operating proficiency of the organization in a CBRN 
environment. Individual standards of proficiency include basic— 
 
Survival standards. Survival standards are those that the individual must master in order to 
survive a CBRN attack.  
 
Operating standards. Operating standards are those that the individual must master in order to 
contribute to the continued operation of the organization as a whole under CBRN conditions.  
C-2. Service members receive initial CBRN defense training upon entering military service and receive 
refresher training at regular intervals thereafter. DOD support personnel receive basic survival training and 
the training necessary to support commanders and sustain in a CBRN environment.  
C-3. Table C-1, page C-2, provides the basic survival and operating standards for military personnel and 
DOD support personnel who must perform under CBRN conditions.  
Note. Additional information may be found in Service-specific regulations and publications.

Basic Survival Standards 
Recognize indications of a possible CBRN attack or unintentional release, and take appropriate protective 
action. 
Recognize and give CBRN alarms and signals. 
Recognize indications of a chemical, biological, or radiological hazard; and take appropriate protective 
action according to associated standing operating procedures. 
Properly don, seat, clear, and check a respirator or protective mask within 9 seconds and complete the 
adjustment and/or attachment of the hood (if available) within 6 seconds (for a total of fifteen 15 seconds) 
following an alarm or recognition of a chemical or biological attack. 
Properly don protective clothing, and properly perform assigned missions. 
Take appropriate protective measures against thermal radiation (light, flash, and heat), blast wave, and 
nuclear radiation effects of a nuclear explosion. 
Complete the immediate individual decontamination drill, and follow procedures for the removal of 
contaminated CBRN individual protective equipment. 
Recognize contaminated casualties, and perform first aid (self-aid and buddy aid). 
Practice good personal health and hygiene as a protective measure against the spread of disease. 
Basic Operating Standards 
Maintain CBRN individual protective equipment in a high state of serviceability at all times.  
Be proficient in taking specific actions required to maintain operating efficiency before, during, and after a 
CBRN attack in order to mitigate the effects of CBRN weapons.

weapon(s), while wearing individual protective equipment for extended periods.  
Be familiar with decontamination procedures that are specific to the branch of military service. 
Be familiar with the principles of collective protection, including passage through contamination control 
areas. (For detailed application, see STANAG 2515.) 
Demonstrate familiarity with available equipment, such as dosimeters and chemical and biological 
detection and monitoring equipment. 
ADDITIONAL STANDARDS OF PROFICIENCY FOR SELECTED 
PERSONNEL 
C-4. To accomplish operational tasks beyond the scope of mere survival, selected personnel require 
training in addition to that required for individuals, but less than that required for specialists. Additional 
training supports leadership activities and such tasks as CBRN monitoring, survey, reconnaissance, and 
contamination control. Personnel who require additional training include the following: 
 
Aircrews, rescue and survival personnel, and ground personnel are required to know the correct 
use of their CBRN ensemble, CBRN protection for air personnel, and donning and doffing the 
equipment as outlined in STANAGs 2515 and 3497. 
 
All military personnel are required to have knowledge appropriate to their rank and operational 
role in addition to the previously identified individual requirements. 
 
All DOD civilian staff and support personnel are required to have the necessary knowledge, 
skills, and abilities appropriate to their position or duties in support of the tactical command. 
C-5. Table C-2 identifies additional standards of proficiency for selected personnel. These are in addition 
to the basic standards outlined above.
