Preface
PURPOSE: The purpose of this publication is to provide tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTP) for contingency response forces to open the airbase, jointly open ports of embarkation and/
or debarkation, and to operate from worldwide locations where little or no mobility operations
support exists.
SCOPE: This publication will:
• Supplement established doctrine and TTP.
• Provide reference material to assist ground focused expeditionary combat support in plan-
ning and coordinating tactical operations.
• Apply to all personnel planning and conducting Air Force operations including command-
ers, planners, ground forces, special operations forces (SOF), and aviation personnel.
• Promote an understanding of the complexities of contingency response operations empha-
sizing employment of personnel and capabilities.
• Incorporate TTP, lessons learned, information from ongoing combat operations and training 
exercises applicable to contingency response forces.
APPLICATION: This publication applies to the Regular Air Force, the Air Force Reserve, and
the Air National Guard. This publication does not apply to the United States Space Force. TTP
publications are not directive. Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 90-160,
Publications and Forms Management states, “These publications are informational and suggest
guidance that can be modified to fit the circumstances. Complying with publications in this
category is expected but not mandatory.” The tactics, techniques, and procedures in this document
are still authoritative; deviations require sound judgment and careful consideration. The
applicable DAFI will take precedence in cases where this publication and DAFIs conflict. The use
of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in
this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force. In accordance with DOD

Chapter 1
CH1 OVERVIEW
OVERVIEW
1.1. Introduction. This Air Force tactics, techniques, and procedures (AFTTP) volume provides
Airmen with techniques for employing contingency response (CR) in a variety of missions and
supplements both formal and continuation-training programs with Air Force Instruction (AFI)
10-202, Contingency Response Forces and United States Transportation Command Instruction
(USTRANSCOMI) 10-27, Volume 2, Joint Task Force Port Opening. It is not inclusive and
presupposes a working knowledge of basic CR operations, and employment. It is not meant to
replace good common sense, nor is it meant to simply repeat information from other technical
orders (TO) and regulations. In some cases, information from existing regulations will be used to
provide background and/or enhance the effectiveness of a technique. The material included in this
volume is intended for all qualified CR forces members from newly qualified to the instructor.
1.1.1. Supplemental Files. For additional combat support TTP publications, refer to:
https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/TTP/.
1.1.2. Scope. Careful consideration should be given to the use of the word procedures as it
applies to this volume in relation to AFI 10-202 and USTRANSCOMI 10-27, Volume 2. In
any case where this volume conflicts with AFI 10-202 or USTRANSCOMI 10-27, Volume 2,
the AFI or USTRANSCOMI take precedence.
1.1.3. Change Procedures. This is a living, evolving document. Equipment modification,
operational experience, and training experience dictate changes to this text. Old procedures
and tactics are never disregarded simply because they have existed for several years. At the
same time, new and better ways of accomplishing the mission evolve and need to be
incorporated as soon as possible. A rewrite is held every 24 months to review the document
and incorporate new information. Suggested changes are always encouraged and should be
submitted via the “Submit Feedback on the Publication” link located on the Air Force Combat
Support TTP Repository website: https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/TTP/.
1.2. General. Airlift is the cornerstone of our nation’s ability to project military power
worldwide. CR forces assess, open, and operate airfields to support joint force requirements. CR
forces may be composed of a scalable contingency response element (CRE), contingency response
team (CRT) and advanced echelon forces. CR missions include the air component to the joint port
opening capability (JPOC), air base opening (ABO), and support to the Global Air Mobility
Support System (GAMSS). The following discussions are designed to aid in building a strong
foundation of CR knowledge, equipment operation, and employment skills. Refer to AFI 10-202
for more information on CR organization, mission sets, deployable capabilities, and functions.
1.3. Doctrine. The foundational doctrine associated with the CR forces mission is based in full
spectrum air mobility employment. In accordance with Air Force Doctrine Publication (AFDP)
3-36, Air Mobility Operations, Airbase Opening Force Module Construct, CR forces are part of
the open the air base force element (FE). This FE provides the capabilities to open an air base,
regardless of the follow-on mission. Open the air base forces provide initial capabilities for
command and control, force protection, cargo and passenger handling, logistics, airfield
operations, force accountability, finance and contracting, and reception of follow-on forces.
1.4. Logistic Organizations. The following organizations are those that CR forces may integrate
with.
 
 
1-2
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
1.4.1. Deployment And Distribution Operations Center (DDOC). Combatant commands
(CCMD) can create a DDOC (e.g., central command DDOC [CDDOC]) and incorporate its
capabilities into their staff functions. The theater DDOC develops deployment and distribution
plans; integrates multinational and/or interagency deployment and distribution; and
coordinates and synchronizes supply, transportation, and related distribution activities. The
DDOC synchronizes the strategic to operational movement of forces and sustainment into
theater by providing advance notice to CCMD air and surface theater movement control
elements. In concert with CCMD priorities, and on behalf of the CCMD, the DDOC
coordinates common-user and theater distribution operations above the tactical level. United
States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) houses the trans-regional, global DDOC
at Scott Air Force Base.
1.4.2. Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR). The DIRMOBFOR functions as
coordinating authority for air mobility with all commands and agencies, both internal and
external to a joint force. The DIRMOBFOR exercises coordinating authority among theater air
operations center (AOC) (or theater joint air operations center [JAOC], if established), 618
AOC, and the DDOC, for air mobility issues. An essential role for the DIRMOBFOR is
serving as the principal interface between the JAOC, the combatant commander’s (CCDR)
theater’s logistics directorate of a joint staff (J-4), and the DDOC to ensure appropriate
prioritization of air mobility tasks. Refer to Joint Publication (JP) 3-36, Joint Air Mobility and
Sealift Operations.
1.4.3. Joint Air Operations Center (JAOC). The JAOC is the air planning and execution
focal point for the joint task force (JTF) (or other subordinate command).
1.4.4. Air Mobility Division (AMD). Centralized planning, coordination, tasking, and
execution of the air mobility missions occur in the air mobility division of the AOC. CR forces
leadership may work with multiple AOCs in one theater. Refer to JP 3-36 for more
information.
1.5. Air Mobility Capabilities and Joint Mobility Expertise. CR forces may need to educate
and advise Service counterparts on air mobility capabilities and limitations, air mobility agencies,
deployment operations, sustainment operations, mission-tracking systems, and theater command
and control (C2) and air documents (e.g., air tasking order [ATO], airspace control order [ACO]).
1.5.1. Air Mobility Liaison Officers (AMLO). CR forces should be familiar with and
contact the deployed AMLO prior to any operation. AMLOs are rated officers that translate air
mobility and Air Force to our joint partners. The AMLO operates as a high demand,
low-density asset supporting the seven joint functions common to joint operations: C2,
information, intelligence, fires, movement and maneuver, protection, and sustainment. These
relationships are vital to ensure efficiencies and proactively solve joint problems.
1.5.2. Expeditionary Air-Ground Liaison Element (EAGLE). CR forces should be
familiar with EAGLE capabilities prior to any operation. An EAGLE consists of enlisted
aviators and air transportation specialist trained to:
• Train joint inspection preparation.
• Train aircraft cargo load planning.
• Employ immediate and effective air movement team capability.
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
1-3
 
 
1.5.3. Air Mobility Team (AMT). CR forces should be familiar with AMT capabilities. An
AMT consists of aircraft maintenance, aerial port services, and can include a vehicle
maintainer and some command and control expertise to support GAMSS missions in a
permissive environment.
1.5.4. Air Advisors. CR forces should be familiar with air advisors, which assess, train,
advise, assist, equip, enable, and accompany partner nation forces to actualize security force
assistance in permissive, uncertain, and hostile environments. They serve as a force multiplier
in theater, leveraging host nation assets for allied objectives through deliberate
interoperability, ensuring access and building partnerships. The air advisor should be
considered a cultural, language, and subject matter intermediary, liaising between CR forces
and those of the partner nation to enable harmonized mission execution by, with, and through
the host nation force. The air advisor is an expert in their primary Air Force Specialty Code
(AFSC), and knowledgeable in the employment of all types of contingency response forces
across the full spectrum of Air Force operations.
1.6. Deployment Execution Systems.
1.6.1. Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES). JOPES 
is 
the
Department of Defense’s (DOD) primary system for translating policy decisions into
operational plans. JOPES flows information directly into the Deliberate and Crisis Action
Planning and Execution System (DCAPES).
1.6.1.1. Automated Data Processing (ADP). JOPES ADP helps planners build the force
list during force planning. Force planning begins when the combatant commander
identifies the major apportioned forces needed to support his concept of operations and
continues with the identification of combat support and combat service support force
requirements. Initially, for gross planning estimates, notional (generic) units may be
designated. As the process continues, actual units must be identified.
1.6.2. DCAPES. DCAPES is the Air Force’s war planning system and provides an Air Force
feed to JOPES ADP. The objective of DCAPES is to enable improved and streamlined
operations planning and execution processes which include associated policy and procedures,
along with organizational and technology improvements. DCAPES provides standard data
files, formats, application programs, and management procedures that are Air Force unique
and joint guidance compliant and used primarily for force planning, sourcing equipment and
personnel requirements, transportation feasibility estimation, civil engineering support, and
medical planning.
1.6.2.1. DCAPES and JOPES share common business rules and ADP procedures and
policies to plan and execute joint military operations.
1.6.2.2. Air Force planners at all levels will use DCAPES to support the combatant
commander’s selected course of action (COA) in a timely manner.
1.6.2.3. DCAPES supports accurate and timely sourcing which includes validation and
verification.
1.6.2.4. DCAPES also supports sourcing and tailoring of lower levels of detail beyond the
JOPES level of detail.
 
 
1-4
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
1.6.2.5. DCAPES is the source for unit type code (UTC) requirements and should be
referenced when tasking personnel and equipment for a force element.
1.6.3. Logistics Module (LOGMOD). LOGMOD is a logistics-planning program that
receives and maintains the cargo and personnel details for UTCs and taskings. It maintains
detailed cargo records as well as personnel records (levy file positions and the personnel to fill
them) and provides a command and control capability through the LOGMOD schedule.
1.6.3.1. Modules. LOGMOD is composed of two program modules, major command
(MAJCOM) and base level. The MAJCOM module contains three subsystems: logistics
force packaging (LOGFOR), logistics planning (LOGPLAN), and logistics feasibility
analysis capability (LOGFAC) system.
1.6.3.2. LOGFOR. The LOGFOR subsystem provides the capability to create and
maintain the standard database of logistics supplies and equipment for each UTC in the Air
Force. This database is called the logistics detail (LOGDET).
1.6.3.3. LOGPLAN. The LOGPLAN subsystem provides the capability to tailor or
customize the plan unique UTC database of equipment and supplies for each United States
Air Force (USAF) operation or contingency plan.
1.6.3.4. LOGFAC. The LOGFAC subsystem of LOGMOD supports the logistics
feasibility assessment of operation plans.
1.6.4. Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES). GATES is the current Air
Mobility Command (AMC) real-time system of record that supports fixed, deployed, and
mobile sites. It will process and track cargo and passengers, support resource management,
and provide C2 support information.
1.6.4.1. Airlift Integrated Interface (A2I). A2I is the 618 AOC method of submitting
UTC, personnel, and airlift requests to source AMC operated airlift assets.
1.7. Resources. The following abbreviated list of documents provide a brief synopsis of the
nation’s current strategic direction and guidance as well as USTRANSCOM plans to meet CCMD
theater campaign plan requirements. Comprehension of these strategic documents provide CR
forces personnel with a better understanding of where the supported unit fits into the national
context and enables leadership to identify small friction points in the global mobility system that
may have a larger strategic impact. See Table 1.1, Strategic Guidance.

1.8.1. Contingency Response Element (CRE). A CRE consists of 108 personnel and is
designed to open and operate an airbase in a non-permissive environment to support working
two aircraft at a time for 24 hours. This is often referred to as a working maximum on ground
(wMOG) of 2 for 24. The CRE’s core personnel UTCs is the 7E1A2. Specific personnel
AFSCs and equipment requirements are found within See Figure 1.1, JFT-PO J-Staff

1.8.2. Contingency Response Team (CRT). A CRT consists of 25 of appropriately
personnel and is designed to open and operate an airbase in a non-permissive environment to
support working one aircraft at a time for 12 hours before the team needs to pause operations.
This is often referred to as a wMOG of 1 for 12. If 24-hour operations are desired, two CRTs
should be tasked. The CRT’s core personnel UTC is 7E1A1 plus one 7E1PD and one 7E1SF.
Specific personnel AFSCs and equipment requirements are found within DCAPES. See

considerations. Refer to AFI 10-202 for definition of airfield assessment teams, and airfield
survey teams. ADVON, AAT, and AST capabilities vary based on mission requirements and
should be considered for planning and execution. The equipment and personnel for the
assessment team are sourced from the CRE or CRT UTCs.
1.10. Bolt-on Support UTCs. As required to support mission requirements, mission planners
should coordinate for additional capabilities hosted in the CR enterprise (e.g., legal advisor, public
affairs, air traffic control, medical team). Bolt-ons are typically utilized in support of a CRE, but
may be attached to a CRT as mission requirements dictate.

Chapter 2
CH2 MISSION PREPARATION
MISSION PREPARATION
2.1. General. This chapter provides preparation guidance and considerations from initial
mission tasking to predeparture brief.
2.2. Philosophy. Mission preparation requires critical thinking and the prudent application of
sound tactical concepts obtained from lessons learned, operational evaluations, training exercises,
tactics development programs, and threat analysis. Planners at all levels are responsible for
determining the best way to execute a mission in accordance with the commander’s intent, and to
provide commanders with accurate and honest assessments of the risks, threats, and force
capabilities relative to the proposed COA. Involve all required personnel from the outset,
including the user (supported force) who will execute the mission. Sharing critical information
will help clarify objectives, fully assess mission risks, and help develop alternative courses of
action.
2.3. Logistics Integration. A comprehensive understanding of the logistics situation and
operating environment is fundamental to successful mission planning. As a result, integration with
logistics personnel to include wing plans (XP), 2Gs (logistics planners), A2I integrators, aerial
port leads, unit deployment managers (UDM), and installation deployment officer (IDO) should
be accomplished as early as possible and continue throughout the entire process of mission
planning. Logistics personnel should help with the planning and predeployment processes for the
geopolitical and/or military situation, identify the most advantageous logistic support, and
describe the capabilities and limitations of specific capabilities. Commanders and planners should
make all attempts to integrate logistics (e.g., fuels, logistics planners, supply, air transportation,
maintenance) planners in order to facilitate an integrated planning process.
2.4. Intelligence Integration. A comprehensive understanding of the threat situation and
operating environment is fundamental to successful mission planning. As a result, integration with
intelligence personnel should be accomplished as early as possible and continue throughout the
entire process of mission planning. Intelligence personnel provide insights that warn of potential
threats. They are essential to operational planning and determining the capabilities and
vulnerabilities of an adversary. Their responsibilities include analyzing, reporting, and distributing
information to commanders and leaders, facilitating informed decision-making and ensuring the
protection of CR forces. To accomplish pre-departure intelligence support, non-deploying
intelligence personnel will provide the bulk of mission planning cell (MPC) support and build
intelligence community (IC) rosters and shared information sites to level knowledge across Air
Force, joint, interagency, and coalition stakeholders. If there are few intelligence personnel
available, your MPC intelligence support may also be the deploying members potentially splitting
time between MPC support and preparation for the personnel deployment function (PDF)
processing. Commanders and planners should make all attempts to collocate tactics and
intelligence planners in order to facilitate an integrated planning process with optimal
tactics/intelligence interface.
2.5. Planning Environment. The tools and skillsets described in this chapter can be useful for a
variety of situations, but should be tailored to the specific operational or training environment.
Planners should be aware that the objectives, tasks, and mission planning setup for a home-station
exercise may be different from those used for USTRANSCOM JPOC mission planning or by a
 
 
2-2
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
deployed MPC. However, the skills, computer-based planning tools, and interagency relationships
used during mission planning are relatively common to all planning environments, and
proficiency with these capabilities should be continuously developed by all members to ensure
maximum effectiveness during operations. See Attachment 2, for MPC best practices.
2.6. Commander’s Intent. The commander’s intent articulates a clear and concise expression of
the purpose of the operation and the desired military end state, and the acceptable level of risk
(ALR) to accomplish that mission. Planners should reference the commander’s intent (normally
included in the air operations directive or tasked order) throughout the mission planning cycle to
derive operational and tactical-level objectives, ensure compliance with ALR, and seamlessly
integrate with any other similar lines of effort.
2.7. Risk Management (RM). Risk is inherent in any operation, but through planning and proper
execution planners can identify threats and mitigate risks to an acceptable level. Every decision
should include risk assessments as well as risk management.
NOTE: The RM process should not be used to violate directives or other regulatory guidance.
Normal waiver or variance procedures should be followed in all cases. 
2.7.1. Principles of RM. Four principles govern all actions associated with the management
of risk. These continuously employed principles are applicable before, during and after all
tasks and operations.
2.7.1.1. Do not accept unnecessary risk. Unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate
return in terms of real benefits or available opportunities. All missions and our daily
routines involve risk.
2.7.1.2. Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. Making risk decisions at the
appropriate level establishes clear accountability. Those accountable for the success or
failure of the mission should be included in the risk decision process. Anyone can make a
risk decision; however, the appropriate level for risk decisions is the one that can allocate
the resources to reduce the risk or eliminate the hazard and implement controls.
2.7.1.3. Accept risk when benefits outweigh the costs. All identified benefits should be
compared to all identified costs. The process of weighing risks against opportunities and
benefits helps to maximize unit capability.
2.7.1.4. Integrate RM into Air Force doctrine and planning at all levels. To effectively
apply risk management, CR force personnel should dedicate time and resources to
incorporate risk management principles into the planning processes. Risks are more easily
accessed and managed in the planning stages of an operation.
2.7.2. Risk Management Goals. The ultimate objective of RM is maximizing operational
capability and to enhance mission effectiveness at all levels while preserving assets and
safeguarding the health and welfare of all personnel. Beyond reducing loss, risk management
also provides a logical process to identify/exploit opportunities that provide the greatest return
on our investment of time, dollars, and personnel.
2.7.3. RM Matrix. Each exercise, tasking, or event will be assessed for risk utilizing
MAJCOM/wing approved RM matrices. The matrix should be used throughout the planning,
deployment, and redeployment process by leadership. This process aids in the identification of
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
2-3
 
 
high-risk factors, control measure implementation, and when necessary is used to elevate risk
to a higher authority.
2.7.3.1. The risk matrix is accomplished during the mission planning process based on
expected data and assumptions. Once deployed, leadership should reassess the risk based
on the mission planning RM matrix. If the level changes, ensure to elevate the risk to the
appropriate level.
2.7.4. Acceptable Level of Risk. ALR is the combatant command (COCOM), MAJCOM, or
commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR) (with operational control [OPCON]) directive to
define the acceptable balance of risk and potential losses in order to achieve mission
objectives. When used properly by leadership, planners, and CR forces, this becomes the
commander’s main tool to shape both deliberate planning and dynamic execution decisions.
2.7.4.1. Planning. Develop a plan to meet the mission objectives that minimizes the
exposure to risk when possible and mitigates risk when needed. Risks may be known and
inherent to the mission (e.g., weather, fatigue), related to a known threat (e.g., confirmed
indirect fire [IDF] in the area of responsibility [AOR]), or unanticipated (e.g., insider
threat). Planners should construct a mission to avoid known risks, analyze and mitigate
threats through established TTP, and minimize exposure to unanticipated threats using all
available resources. Request joint/coalition assets, additional intelligence support, or
permission intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) if necessary. Continue to
monitor the mission tasking and threat environment for any changes that may require
adjusting the mission plan or requesting additional support to meet the ALR. Examples of
adjusting the mission plan to meet the ALR include delaying the mission until the threat is
degraded, assessing the ALR for specific phases of operation or triggers to accomplish
mission objectives, or including a minimum force of ISR, quick reaction force (QRF),
Blue Air, or other support forces. Planners should also consider the effects of non-kinetic
threats (e.g., cyber, jamming) when analyzing potential risk.
2.7.4.2. Execution. Although actual level of risk can be dynamic in execution, ALR will
not change unless approved by the appropriate MAJCOM, theater, or CCDR. The final
plan should clearly incorporate the acceptance of risk at the appropriate levels and
designate decision makers during key points of mission execution. Ensure that CR force
leadership have a working understanding of both the acceptable level of risk and the actual
level of risk anticipated by executing the mission as planned. Additionally, CR force
leadership should have an understanding of not only their own ALR but also the ALR of
supported ground forces and supported aircraft. Leadership should understand the
appropriate level of acceptance for any additional risk incurred during execution.
2.7.5. Risk Mitigation. Regardless of ALR, CR forces are expected to defend themselves at
all times. In planning and execution, CR forces should plan to and operate within the risk
levels specified by ALR through mitigating risk. If unable to maintain ALR with the allocated
assets, planners should elevate the concern through their chain of command for an elevation of
ALR. If unable to elevate ALR, request additional assets, or modify the plan to execute within
the ALR. The point at which asset/effect fallout changes ALR, is the minimum force.
2.8. Contested, Degraded, and Operationally Limited (CDO-L) Environment. CDO-L
describes the operational environment and planning construct that drives identification of and
 
 
2-4
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
compensation for enemy actions, friendly-force limitations, and operational constraints that
prevent full employment of integrated warfighting or freedom of action. Simply stated, CDO-L
can be barriers to mission success and multipliers of mission risk. CR forces in the joint
environment rely heavily on technology such as Global Positioning System (GPS), and
communications radios to support mission employment. Planners should expect that enemy forces
will seek ways to deny the use of this technology and should work closely with intelligence to gain
a better understanding of adversary capabilities and intentions. Actions should be taken to include
all practical camouflage, concealment, and deception (CCD) methods to reduce adversarial
identification and data collection of personnel, assets, and facilities, regardless of the operational
environment. CR forces should not become over-reliant on technology for mission success and
should ensure mission continuity in contested and degraded operational environments which
should include a primary, alternate, contingency and emergency (PACE) plan for communications.
See Table 2.1, CDO-L Environment for examples.
2.8.1. Contested. Contested operations result when adversary capabilities and actions limit
friendly operations. Contested operations include kinetic attacks as well as enemy activity
attempting to degrade or deny effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum. CR forces should
be proficient in the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures to counter enemy electronic
attack measures such as GPS jamming, communications jamming/spoofing, small unmanned
aircraft system (sUAS) detection and countermeasures, emission control (EMCON) limiting
environments, target camouflage, and data link degraded operations. Training objectives
should emphasize current enemy TTP for kinetic attacks, theater ballistic missile (TBM)
strikes, communication, and navigation system jamming and passive/active means to deny
sensor capabilities. Academic instruction, mission planning, and execution will reinforce
recognition and mitigation methods, as well as risk analysis of continued operations with
partial and full loss of systems.
2.8.2. Degraded. Degraded systems operations result from aircraft malfunctions, battle
damage, or when blue force integration interferes with normal system operations (e.g.,
blue-on-blue jamming). Degraded systems training means intentionally degrading/deselecting
highly reliable systems to achieve desired learning objectives. Include GPS, data link, and/or
communication countermeasures effectiveness into the training scenarios. Brief reduced
performance or total loss of GPS or communication systems prior to execution. Consider the
feasibility of continuing the mission in various degraded states while remaining in contact
with theater air operations center (AOC).
2.8.3. Operationally Limited. Operational limitations are those physical or operational
constraints that do not fall under elements of contested operations or degraded systems.
Examples include theater rules of engagement (ROE) and special instructions (SPINS), C2
limitations (e.g., proximity, capability), friendly/neutral country political border constraints,
and support asset limitations. Support limitations may include intelligence gaps. Operational
limitations also include environmental factors that impact weather and night employment
operations.
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025

Table 2.1. CDO-L Environment
2.9. Command Authority. Planners should clearly understand the command authority as
identified in the mission directives and as described in JP 5-series. The CCMD or JTF commander
usually does not exercise OPCON of non-organic CR forces. If OPCON or tactical control
(TACON) is not transferred, the AOC maintains C2.
2.10. Mission Tasking and Objective. The geographic AOC plans and executes air operations.
This is accomplished through the air operations directive (AOD), SPINS), operational tasking link
(OPTASKLINK), ATO, and/or ACO. These products are produced or updated regularly to
establish mission tasking and objectives. The AOC’s AMD is responsible for planning and
publishing intra-theater airlift in the ATO.
2.10.1. Special Instructions. SPINS provide essential information for all planners and
aircrew to become familiar with prior to operations in the applicable theater. SPINS may
contain waivers to governing publications (i.e., AFI 10-202, Contingency Response Forces),
the baseline ALR for an AOR, some types of airspace coordinating measures (ACM),
communications plans, and specific operational authorizations not found elsewhere (e.g.,
approval for an aircraft to execute mission computer approaches). For example,
USTRANSCOM SPINS apply to most 618 AOC assigned missions, but CR forces should also
be familiar with the theater specific SPINS for any AOR they are transiting.

2.10.2. Air Operations Directive. The AOD relays the joint force air component
commander’s (JFACC) intent, provides operational objectives and tasks, and may establish the
acceptable level of risk for a specific ATO or period of time.
2.10.3. Operational Tasking Data Link. The OPTASKLINK is a portion of the operational
tasking order that applies to tactical data link communications involving participating
platforms and ground stations. OPTASKLINK provides the specific parameters, settings, and
participation procedures for all network participants regardless of system (e.g., situation
awareness data link ([SADL], Link 16, Link-11). Planners should contact the AOC’s joint
interface control officer (JICO) for inclusion on the OPTASKLINK or if desiring to participate
in a tactical data link network.
2.11. Mission Analysis and Planning. Mission analysis and planning begins with indications
and warnings (I&W), warning order (WARNORD), verbal order of the commander (VOCO), or
the publication of a tasking order (TASKORD)/execute order (EXORD). Requirements to
organize, deploy, and employ CR forces should also appear in the order. During mission analysis
and planning, it is recommended to refer to JP 5-0, Joint Planning Process, Chapter 3 as a guide
for the process. See Figure A3.3, Joint Planning Overview for a visual on the process.
2.11.1. Mission Analysis. Data collection and analysis are used to study the assigned tasks
and to identify all other tasks necessary to accomplish the mission. Mission analysis is critical
because it provides direction to the AAT, enabling them to focus effectively on the problem at
hand. The following resources should be familiar to all CR force members during mission
planning. Ensure members assigned to a MPC obtain and maintain login accounts as
necessary. Mission analysis includes the following:
2.11.1.1. Identify/appoint lead mission planner, mission planning cell members, team
chief, and functional leaders.
2.11.1.2. Review tasking (from published order[s] or from VOCO).
2.11.1.3. CCDR’s initial intent and commander’s critical information requirements
(CCIR). The commander’s initial intent describes the purpose of the operations, desired
strategic end state, military end state, and operational risks associated with the mission. It
also includes where the commander will and will not accept risk during the operation. It
organizes desired conditions and the combinations of potential actions in time, space, and
purpose.
2.11.1.4. Constraint. A constraint is a requirement placed on the command by a higher
command that dictates an action, thus restricting freedom of action.
2.11.1.5. Restraint. A restraint is a requirement placed on the command by a higher
command that prohibits an action, thus restricting freedom of action.
2.11.1.6. Specified Tasks. Specified tasks are those that the higher commander assigns to
a subordinate commander directly in a WARNORD, operations order (OPORD), or other
planning directive.
2.11.1.7. Implied Tasks. Implied tasks are additional tasks for the commander to
accomplish, typically in order to accomplish the specified tasks, support another
command, or otherwise accomplish activities relevant to the operation.
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
2-7
 
 
2.11.1.8. A fact is a statement of information known to be true. It is critical to establish
facts for effective mission planning and in order to delineate from assumptions/personal
opinions that could impact the mission.
2.11.1.9. Assumptions. An assumption provides a supposition about the current situation
or future course of events, assumed to be true in the absence of facts. Assumptions that
address gaps in knowledge are critical for the planning process to continue. Assumptions
should be continually reviewed to ensure validity and then either become a fact or are
deleted.
2.11.1.10. Command Relationships. CR forces will be in direct support of CCMD and/or
JTF requirements. OPCON of CR forces normally remains under the commander of AMC,
United States Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA), or Pacific
Air Forces (PACAF).
2.11.1.11. Tasking Criteria. What criteria is higher headquarters (HHQ) asking the CR
force to assess/operate the airfield for? Examples include: JPOC heavy, 2/24 wMOG,
C-130, C-17, C-5, rotary-wing, commercial aircraft, international aircraft, throughput
capability, and contracting support.
2.11.1.12. Funding. The source of funding and a realistic estimate should be made early in
planning especially if coordinating a training mission. Operational missions will be funded
externally but may need to be unit funded initially to move forces into theater. Some
training missions may be entirely unit-funded or split costs if MAJCOM tasked.
Transportation costs for cargo, whether line hauled or airlifted can be significant.
Determine the organization responsible for providing a transport account code (TAC) early
in planning if airlifting cargo, especially for a training mission. Consider maximizing use
of equipment at the employment location if transportation costs are prohibitive.
2.11.1.13. Request for Information (RFI) and Limiting Factors (LIMFAC). Develop a list
of RFIs or questions/unknown information and LIMFACs regarding the tasking. Organize
the RFIs based on who the question is for (e.g., USTRANSCOM, AMC, United States
[US] Embassy, host nation [HN], airfield manager). Assign an OPR in the MPC to
follow-up and coordinate the RFI. Planners may have to make assumptions on each RFI to
continue mission planning.
2.11.1.14. Intelligence, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and Operating
Area Analysis.
• Political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical
environment, time (PMESII-PT). The team should understand the operational
environment.
NOTE: Team size may be greatly limited at the operating location due to logistic or diplomatic
considerations. Coordinating with higher headquarters and US Embassy early to determine
maximum allowable team size will inform planners on what capabilities may be brought in.
• Areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, events (ASCOPE) if
applicable.
• Observation, cover and concealment, obstacles, key terrain, and avenues of approach
(OCOKA) if applicable.

2.11.1.15. Initial Airfield Assessment. Gather/research all pertinent information/data on
the tasked airfield and/or aerial port of debarkation (APOD).
2.11.1.15.1. AF Form 1174, Airfield Survey. Typically filled out by the AST and
reviewed/verified by the AAT, as necessary. The AF Form 1174 is valid for three years
and should be updated every two years or after significant changes. Information feeds
other sources like the Giant Report. The AF Form 1174 is a two-part document that
determines suitability of an airfield for operations of AMC aircraft. Part 1, Airfield
Suitability provides specific information on the physical capability of the airfield to
handle air mobility aircraft. Part II of the survey is a checklist designed to provide
information to determine if the airfield has the facilities to support air mobility
operations.
2.11.1.15.2. Once AF Form 1174 is completed by the survey team, ensure AF Form
1174 is routed to AMC and theater A4 for tracking purposes. A survey may be used to
support austere, prepared, or semi-prepared (unpaved) airfields, but may include an
entire airfield that has unique issues. These issues can include non-existent or
non-operational navigation aids, insufficient lighting, or obstacles that force it to
operate as a landing zone (LZ). AMD tactics is the office of primary responsibility for
LZ suitability issues. If needed, an LZ survey (AF Form 3822, Landing Zone Survey)
can be drafted and is valid five-years from date of survey. See AMC zone availability
report (ZAR) or Talon Point for LZ/drop zone (DZ) information.
2.11.1.15.3. Expeditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP). This is predominately an Air
Force base operating support-integrator (BOS-I) survey process used for expeditionary
site planning. It looks at all facets of an installation, to include: supply, logistics,
maintenance, operations, medical, and infrastructure. The survey is published in a
multiple-chapter document and is supposed to be updated any time content within is
changed through any survey process. Refer to AFI 10-404, Base Support and
Expeditionary (BAS&E) Site Planning, and JP 4-04, Contingency Basing, for more
details. Route ESSP document to AMC and theater A4 for tracking purposes.
Contingency airfield pavement evaluation (CAPE) Report is a report that is conducted
and generated by a CAPE certified engineer and requires to be reviewed and approved
by Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) and/or theater A4C pavement engineer.
Refer to Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 32-1041, Pavement
Evaluation Program. All CAPE reports can be found at:

operations including social, red lines (i.e., do not[s]), key themes, top line messages, and
media questions and answers.
2.11.1.22. Climatology.
• Weather-hot/cold/wet/other weather gear required.
• Sunrise/sunset information.
• Illumination data for night vision goggles (NVG) operations.

AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
• Predominant wind data for landing zone safety officer (LZSO)/landing zone
controller (LZC) drop zone safety officer (DZSO)/drop zone controller (DZC) support
2.11.1.23. Review previous after action reports (AAR) for similar missions.
2.11.1.24. CCMD Considerations. CR units deploying to a different CCMD than they are
presently assigned should reach out to their CR counterparts who are assigned to that
CCMD to reduce gaps in mission planning. For example, a continental United States
(CONUS)-based team deploying to the United States Indo-Pacific Command
(USINDOPACOM) or United States European Command (EUCOM) AOR should
respectively coordinate with the 36th Contingency Response Group (CRG) at Guam or the
435 CRG at Ramstein to get their understanding of the operational environment, lessons
learned/best practices, and get contacts for people who could help facilitate their
requirements in country.
2.11.1.25. Mission Partners. If close coordination with another unit is required to
accomplish the mission, good communication during the planning phase will help align
planning efforts and level expectations upon arrival. The capabilities that each team brings
to the mission should be well understood to allow all personnel to maximize use of the
combined team and reduce friction points. If time and conditions permit, visiting the
mission partner or inviting the mission partner to visit can be very beneficial if time is
spent getting to know lead counterparts and focusing on potential mission execution
concerns. For example, if an after action report said a particular branch or MAJCOM has
struggled with cargo preparation, take time to discuss with their port leads how the team
expects to process cargo for movement or how to coordinate in transit visibility (ITV).
2.11.1.26. Interpreter considerations. If sufficient host nation personnel do not speak
English fluently, coordinate with a CR mobility support advisory squadron, tasking
authority, or the Language Enabled Airman Program (LEAP) at
https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/AFCLC/Language-studies/ to request interpreters to
accompany the team. If integrating capabilities with a host nation team that does not speak
English, ensure enough interpreters are sourced to be available at multiple locations to
allow the team to coordinate with their counterparts at the same time, approximately two
for a CRT or four for a CRE. If the only pre-mission coordination with host nation
counterparts is via written communication, this could mask fluency deficiencies that you
may encounter during face-to-face verbal communication. Early integration with your
interpreters who may not have any CR experience will help them prepare for their mission.
2.11.2. Mission Planning. The desired end state of mission planning produces the best
possible picture of the mission, the deployed environment, the operational plans for
deployment, employment and redeployment; and the required or desired timelines. Coordinate
mission planning as early as practical with other partner units such as an Air Task Force (ATF),
Inland Cargo Transportation Company (ICTC), or other mission partner via combined mission
planning events to ensure smooth mission execution. CR force leadership, the mission planner,
and functional area leaders at all levels should be able to prioritize desired outputs (both
quantitative and qualitative) from the deliberate planning process commensurate with the
operational timelines (i.e., the more time you have for mission planning, the more detailed
your products should be). The absolute minimum for viable planning is contacts and contracts.
Who do you call? How do you call them? What do you both expect from each other?
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025

2.11.2.1. Prepare, Conduct Predeployment, and Execution Briefing. Establish a date, time,
and place for the commander and team predeparture briefing.
2.11.2.2. Murder Board. During the planning process, leadership should set aside time for
the planning team to get together to review the plan and identify shortcomings. This is
critical because it may be the first time one (or more) of the planners has seen the big
picture of the entire planned mission. The three purposes for this brief are to walk through
the big picture, identify potential problems, and assess the plan. Before conducting the
murder board, the lead should identify a scribe to document shortcomings or problems
with the plan. For additional murder board information, see paragraph A2.6.3, Murder
Board.
2.11.2.3. Products. The following describe the output from both mission analysis and
mission planning phases. Mission analysis/planning and execution product templates for
the CR forces are posted on the Air Force Combat Support TTP Repository:

2.11.2.7. Create logistical sequence of events for deployment activation upon order
approval.
2.11.2.8. Hard crew roster, support roster, and additional duty roster.
• Prior to finalizing the hard crew roster, ensure all personnel are deployable in
accordance with AFI 10-401, Operations Planning and Execution theater entry and
arming requirements.
• The support roster will typically include members of the mission planning cell,
equipment custodians, increment monitors (IM), and deployment execution team
(DET).
• Additional duties that need to be assigned include safety representative, victim
advocate (VA) or sexual assault response coordinator (SARC), first sergeant, and
post-attack reconnaissance (PAR) teams.
• Passenger Manifest (XMAN). Expect that passenger terminals will require a list of
all members processing for airlift. Reach out to the passenger terminals you will be
processing out of to get a copy of their preferred manifest document and begin
populating early. Some commonly requested information such as common access card
(CAC) expiration date is not readily available from central Air Force systems and
needs to be gathered from each member. Best practice: Squadron-wide pre-built
XMAN that captures all the data required by their local passenger terminal.
Recommend assigning this task to the A1 lead.
2.11.2.9. Tactical Operations Center (TOC) Layout. The TOC layout will depend on what
facilities are available and mission complexity. Mission planners should determine
potential configurations of their TOC based on available spaces and mission partner
integration which may increase the number of personnel in the TOC. Consideration should
be given to keep the members of the threat working group (TWG) closer together and
ensure a common operational picture (COP) is visible to the team’s leadership.
Additionally, the TOC should have a secure area for communications security (COMSEC)
and classified systems plus a briefing area to provide mission updates and shift change
briefs if applicable. Planners should have a notional TOC tent layout designated to
expedite the set up in execution. For an example, see Figure 2.2, TOC Tent Layout.

2.11.2.10. RFI Tracker. Additional information on the RFI tracker is found earlier in this
chapter under mission analysis. Track the status of all questions by office of primary
responsibility (OPR) through completion. Most RFIs will be answered by the assessment
team (AT) or once the CR force has arrived at the deployed location.
2.11.2.11. Packing List. Issue a packing list to all members of the CR force. The list will
be based on mission requirements (e.g., C-bag, plate carriers, helmets, weapons), and
environmental requirements (e.g., B-bag and long underwear).
2.11.2.12. Communications Plan. The communications plan should include channel
assignments (frequencies may be included if not classified), call signs, communications
check and frequency compromise procedures, CR force contact information (e.g., cell
phones, Iridium/Defense Switched Network [DSN] numbers), and key contact information
for outside agencies (i.e., typically for home station, HHQ, and other agencies interacting
with the CR force). The communications plan should also include all COMSEC
requirements, including COMSEC for GPS devices.
2.11.2.13. A PACE plan should be created showing the primary, alternate, contingency
and emergency forms of communications during contingency operations. This should
reflect both secure and non-secure means of communication.
2.11.2.14. Fuel Plan. This will include transportation, quantity, fueling/refueling
operations (if applicable) and contingency fuel plan. A subject matter expert will develop
a plan based on mission requirements and limiting factors.

2.11.2.15. Patient Movement Plan. Casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) involves the
unregulated movement of casualties aboard ships, land vehicles, or aircraft. Medical
evacuation (MEDEVAC) is the timely, efficient movement and en route care (ERC) by
medical personnel of the wounded, injured, or ill persons from the battlefield and/or other
locations to and between medical treatment facilities (MTF). MEDEVAC is conducted
with dedicated ground and air ambulances, properly marked and employed in accordance
with the Geneva Conventions and the law of war. MEDEVAC involves the movement of
both unregulated and regulated patients. Aeromedical evacuation (AE) refers to the
movement of patients under medical supervision to and between MTFs by air
transportation. The United States Air Force AE system provides for the time-sensitive
ERC of regulated patients, to and between MTFs, using organic and/or contracted aircraft
with medical aircrew explicitly trained for the mission. Prior to arrival, CR forces should
establish proper ERC procedures (i.e., who and how). The plan will vary widely based on
available options during that mission, which may include nearby US or allied bases,
nearby friendly forces, or the host nation.
2.11.2.16. Force Protection/Base Defense Plan with Weapons Status. This is a security
forces generated OPORD describing the overall force protection/defense plan for a
specific CR force location. It should include concept of operations, maneuver, force
protection priorities, and defense posture.
2.11.2.16.1. Weapons Conditions or Weapons Control Status. The following brevity
terms convey different conditions under which fires are authorized:
• Weapons Free. Fire only at targets not identified as friendly in accordance with
current ROE.
• Weapons Tight. Fire only at targets positively identified as hostile in accordance
with current ROE.
• Weapons Hold. Fire only in self-defense or in response to a formal order.
2.11.2.16.2. Weapons and Ammunition. Delegate a security forces member to
coordinate a comprehensive plan for how weapons and ammo will be tracked for
accountability, transported, and stored at the employment location to include
requirements for guarding weapons and ammunition if required. A weapons roster
should be built during the planning phase to allow the unit to verify qualification status
and in execution, the roster should be signed by each member when they check out
their weapons from the armory. For transportation requirements, refer to Title 49
(Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1544.203(f), Firearms in checked baggage, Title
49 CFR Part 175, Carriage by Aircraft, AFI 24-605, Volume 2, Air Transportation
Operations paragraph 2.116. Military Weapons Transportation, Defense
Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9-R, Part I, Passenger Movement, DTR
4500.9-R, Part III, Mobility, Appendix BB, Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 24-604,
Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, Chapter 3, and the DOD
Foreign Clearance Guide (if applicable). The passenger terminal may be able to
provide additional clarification.
2.11.2.17. Medical Assessment Plan. This will be accomplished by attached medical
personnel (if tasked), or the home station installation medical group. This is not a

predeployment medical screening nor theater-specific immunization requirements. This
mission planning medical assessment is the analysis of local food, quality of air,
waterborne concerns, occupational exposure, endemic disease, venomous animals, and
noise. If the GR1 UTC is required, coordinate with AMC surgeon general (SG) to
determine when the GR1 will be available and how it will be transported to the
employment location. Recommend verifying what costs will be charged since some
consumables may not be returned to the clinic they were issued from.
2.11.2.18. Entry Authorization List (EAL). EALs are developed to ensure proper
clearance of individuals in a given area. Typically, EALs are created for both the tactical
operations center (TOC) and SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) area.
Individual identification cards are cross-checked against the CR force developed list for
those seeking entrance into one of these designated areas. Security clearance information
is determined for those not on the EAL prior to allowing them access.
2.11.2.19. Commander’s Critical Information Requirements (CCIR). See the mission
analysis section for more information on CCIRs. Commanders at every level of command
may have their own CCIRs. If the commander needs the information to make a key
decision, the information requirement is typically designated a CCIR. CR force leadership
should understand their commander’s intent and when to report specific items up the
chain.
2.11.2.20. Priority Intelligence Requirement (PIR). This list, typically developed by
intelligence, consists of key items for the commander to know about the enemy to make a
decision. Refer to JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence, for more information on PIRs.
2.11.2.21. Commander’s Critical Information and Indicators List. This list is a
consolidated list of the CR forces critical information and indicators. Mission specific
critical information that must be protected via secure means or indicators that must be
hidden from adversary collection methods.
2.11.2.22. RM Worksheet. See risk management at the beginning of this chapter.
Complete the MAJCOM or wing directed RM worksheet.
2.11.2.23. Mission Authorization Worksheet. This worksheet ensures that all operations
list each participating member and who the team lead is.
2.11.2.24. Mission Booklet. A mission booklet is a venue to distribute printed information
to the entire CR force. Mission booklets typically contain information such as concept of
operations, safety information, contact numbers, ROE, CCIRs, PIRs, mission essential
tasks, CR force organization, battle rhythm, CR force/commander’s policies, operations
security (OPSEC), weather, and public affairs (PA) guidance.
2.11.2.25. Airfield Parking Plan. Airfield management personnel will develop/validate a
parking plan to ensure minimum wing-tip clearances, obstruction mitigation, runway
condition reading and pursuit of waivers to airfield criteria.
2.11.2.26. Consider designating an A2I lead and backup A2I coordinators to ensure load
plans and other required information is being input in time to request airflow when airlift
is required. No airlift will be assigned to move cargo until the A2I process is complete.
 
 
2-16
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
2.11.2.27. Designate ADVON team(s). Depending on mission requirements, ADVON
teams may need to arrive ahead of the main body to facilitate a smooth transition. While
the AAT always arrives ahead of the main body as a type of ADVON, they are not the only
type of ADVON team mission planners need to consider. For example, a port ADVON
team may need to arrive early to download line-hauled cargo. Public health may need to
test the local dining facilities to ensure the safety of the team or ATC may need to get some
familiarity with local operations before operations begin. These considerations should be
identified during the mission planning cells. ADVON is a generalized term in this context
and does not describe a specific team’s capability and will create confusion if referring to
a team as simply ADVON. The aircrew brochure is created to provide inbound aircrew
with the necessary frequencies, call signs, parking details, and locally developed
procedures (e.g., taxi instructions, closed parking spots, CR force capabilities, blanket
waivers).
2.11.2.28. Living Support Area and Beddown Plan. This is typically a civil engineering
developed base layout of CR forces. It will include the life support area, operations area,
and any alternate area (as required). This plan will help the AT assess the expected
operating areas. Ensure this plan is coordinated with security forces as their base defense
plan is based off of this setup.
2.11.2.29. Logistics Execution, Support, and Resupply Plan. This is typically led by a
logistic readiness officer to execute, support, and sustain deployed CR forces across
supply; petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL); maintenance; aerial port; vehicle
maintenance; and vehicle operations.
2.11.2.30. Reports. Applicable report examples include: on station, situation report
(SITREP), deployed personnel and equipment (DP&E), and sustainment plan. These
reports can take up valuable time during initial CR force operations. Create and preload
these reports during the mission planning process and transfer to SIPRNET (as required).
See Chapter 4, Execution, and Chapter 3, Airfield Survey and Assessment, for additional
information on these reports.
2.11.2.31. Execution Checklist (ExCheck). Following a major planning event, subject
matter experts (SME) should accomplish a tabletop review of the team’s pre-departure
sequence and arrival actions at the deployed location via a comprehensive execution
checklist or ExCheck. The ExCheck allows team leads to plan and sequence their
anticipated actions with the rest of the team to ensure required actions are accomplished in
a logical order to reach initial and full operational capability as effectively as possible.
ExCheck timing provides team leadership the ability to determine when expected activities
are behind schedule which may drive a re-allocation of manpower to accomplish critical
actions. The team should rehearse how team leads will call in the accomplishment of their
ExCheck actions and TOC personnel should be delegated to maintain primary ExCheck
awareness to inform the CRT Chief or CRE director of operations (DO) when an event has
not been called in on time. Ensure all personnel who are responsible for calling in their
ExCheck events have a copy of the ExCheck prior to departing home station. An example
ExCheck is found on the Air Force Combat Support TTP Repository at: 
https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/TTP/pages/cr-core.aspx
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
2-17
 
 
2.11.2.32. Rehearsal of Concept (ROC) Drill. Following an ExCheck build, the MPC
leads should accomplish a ROC drill to tabletop the planned execution events so that leads
can evaluate if the timing flows in a logical order with enough time allocated to each event
and identify potential issues and LIMFACs.
2.11.2.33. Predeparture/Execution Brief. This brief encompasses all pertinent mission
analysis and mission planning data into one brief for the entire CR force. At a minimum,
the predeparture brief should include mission, location, dates, objectives, team makeup,
required equipment, training/upgrades, travel arrangements (people and equipment),
intelligence, and RM. Ensure that the CR force understands how they fit into the greater
strategic picture.
2.11.2.34. Redeployment Pre-planning. Prior to departure from home station or previous
location or arrival to deployed location, a withdrawal working group should be created and
should consist of SMEs requisite for planning steps to close the air base. CR forces
assigned the mission to close a base, all of the coordination agencies (e.g., US Embassy,
warfighting headquarters [WFHQ], 618 AOC, home units) should be notified in advance
and a priority/urgency sequence of events must be established at the general officer level.
Without prior notification, the process takes much longer. The closure deadline should be
common knowledge at the deployed site. See Chapter 5, Closure, Redeployment, and
Reconstitution for more details.

Chapter 3
CH3 AIRFIELD SURVEY AND ASSESSMENTS
AIRFIELD SURVEY AND ASSESSMENTS
3.1. Overview. When specifically tasked by USTRANSCOM, AMC, or a geographic combatant
command, airfield assessments typically occur prior to airfield opening. The AAT may be
comprised of CR forces, coalition or multi-Service personnel, inter-governmental or
non-governmental organizations, or civilian representatives. Surveys are similar to assessments in
terms of skill base and criteria evaluated, however surveys are typically more comprehensive and
occur ahead of operations in a Set the Theater capacity. The terms airfield assessment, airfield
survey, and airfield operations are sometimes used interchangeably; however, these terms perform
three separate capabilities. Airfield assessment and survey equipment is embedded in the 7E1A1
and 7E1A2. The AAT and AST members are located within the 7E1A1 and 7E1A2 UTCs as an
organic capability of those UTCs. See Table 3.1, Airfield Assessment and Survey Requirements
for personnel requirements and mission type.
3.1.1. Airfield Operations. An airfield operation team is a combination of these Air Force
specialties: Rated Mobility Officer (11/12M), Airfield Operations Officer (13M), Contingency
Airfield Pavement Evaluation-certified Civil Engineering Officer (32E) and/or enlisted (3E5),
Radar Airfield and Weather Systems (RAWS) (1C8), Airfield Manager (1C7) and
tower-qualified (Special Experience Identifier 055/056), Air Traffic Controller (1C1) in
accordance with AFI 10-202 paragraph 8.2.
3.1.2. Airfield Team. The airfield team is intended to provide basic airfield operations for
airfields to include operating landing zones, drop zones, and helicopter landing zones.
Capabilities can be tailored from LZSO and LZC for prepared/semi-prepared/or unprepared
airfields, instrument approaches, and weather observations. Communication plan templates
for CR forces are available on the Air Force Combat Support TTP Repository:
https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/TTP/SitePages/CR-Core.aspx.
3.1.3. Airfield Survey. The terms airfield survey and assessment are sometimes used
interchangeably, however, surveys and assessments support two distinctly separate missions.
An AST accomplishes assessments to verify known information and evaluate and obtain any
items that were not already identified. Airfield surveys will address areas such as runways,
ramps, taxiways, force protection, communications, and facilities. Completed surveys provide
a recommendation to decision makers on the suitability of future airfield operations (fixed- or
rotary-wing). Team personnel should meet with representatives of the airfield seizure forces,
HN, and follow-on forces to understand the supported commander’s mission for the airfield
and proposed layout assessed. Unlike airfield assessments, this survey is conducted solely in a
permissive environment and provides data for the foundation to future operations conducted in
response to an actual contingency. Airfield survey data is recorded on the AF Form 1174, AF
Form 3822, and AF Form 3823, Drop Zone Survey and can only be approved by a 13M, 32E,
or a 1C7.
3.1.4. Airfield Assessment. An airfield assessment focuses on identifying and overcoming
the impediments to the mission and may occur in permissive or uncertain environment.
Timing for an assessment is immediately following an unopposed entry (permissive) or after
an airfield seizure by the joint force (uncertain). An assessment should validate or determine
the suitability of a designated airfield for a pending air mission, in support of an actual
 
 
3-2
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
contingency, or for other airfield assessment requirements designated by the tasking authority.
Critical assessment aspects include airfield capabilities, limitations, air movement facilities
available, and obstruction clearance in the departure and arrival areas. Planners will need to
consider runway characteristics and taxiway, parking, ramp, and cargo handling areas for
operational suitability, and determine maximum on ground (MOG) limitations. The airfield
assessment should be done as early as possible to verify information and to identify additional
requirements. Report results back through secure, dependable, long-range communications, as
directed, through command channels. It will provide a recommendation on the suitability of
future airfield operations to decision makers. The 7E1A3 UTC can produce an expedient
pavement evaluation and a formal assessment report within 24 hours to assist in
command-level go/no-go decisions. The 7E1AK UTC is an airborne assessment team
consisting of 12th Air Force Contingency Response Force (CRF) personnel capable of fixed
wing (FW) or rotary wing (RW) air-land infiltration and airdrop or overland employment into
a bare-base location. The AAT is not necessarily part of an ADVON; however, after an
assessment, they can set the conditions for follow-on forces.
3.2. Responsibilities. An AAT should validate or determine the suitability of a designated airfield
for a pending air mission, in support of an actual contingency, or for other airfield assessment
requirements designated by the tasking authority. Critical assessment aspects include airfield
capabilities, limitations, air movement facilities available, and obstruction clearance in the
departure and arrival areas. Planners will need to consider runway characteristics as well as
taxiway, parking, ramp and cargo handling areas for operational suitability, and determination of
the parking MOG limitations. When tasked, the airfield assessment should be accomplished as
early as possible in order to verify information and identify additional requirements, see
Attachment 5, Airfield Assessment Team (AAT) Guide and Considerations. Results should be
reported back through secure, dependable, long-range communications as directed through
appropriate command channels. AATs provide a recommendation on the suitability of airfield
operations to appropriate decision makers. Refer to JP 3-36 for more information.
3.3. AAT. The AAT shall be primarily composed of CR personnel. This team is generally
composed of eight Air Force CR forces personnel, including an O-6 (7E1HB CR Senior Leader
10C0 certified as a CRE Commander), airfield operations officer (13M) or airfield manager (1C7)
with 368 SEI, civil engineers (32E and/or 3E5X1), a communications noncommissioned officer
(NCO), a security forces noncommissioned officer (NCO), and a mission-dependent specialty.
Augmentation for specific skills may be required from other DOD agencies or the supported
CCDR as available (e.g., emergency management [EM]/chemical, biological, radiological,
nuclear [CBRN], security forces augmentation). Typically, the O-6 commander will have tactical
control over augmenting forces. Examples of additional qualified CR AAT personnel may include
a 1C1X1 with LZ/DZ qualifications, load plan/joint inspection (JI) certified 2T2, contracting,
ramp coordinator (RAMPCO) operations expediter certified member, etc. The use of 5-level
personnel should be limited while the use of 3-level personnel is prohibited.
3.3.1. CR Senior Leader (O-6). If required for the mission, the CR senior leader is the final
mission authority for assessing and opening the airbase and will make decisions not
specifically assigned to higher authority. Unless otherwise indicated, the CR senior leader may
delegate specific duties to other members (e.g., CRE commander, airfield manager) of the
AAT. The CR senior leader is responsible for the entire mission throughout all phases of CR
airbase opening operations. The O-6 (10C0 such as the 7E1HB) should negotiate and
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
3-3
 
 
synchronize with HN representatives, HHQ, and other joint/coalition partners. If designated
by AMC, or a geographic combatant command, an O-6 will act as the senior airfield authority
(SAA).
3.3.2. Team Lead, CRE Commander. The AAT lead is ultimately responsible for all aspects
of assessment execution at the designated airfield. They provide an aviation perspective and
leverage their depth and breadth of experience to set the priorities and objectives of the team.
They manage execution of the assessment and composition/submission of all reports.
Additionally, this position should be trained as a LZSO.
3.3.3. Airfield Operations (13M/1C7 recommend to be BOTH 368 SEI Qualified). The
airfield operations officer or airfield manager is responsible for conducting initial airfield
suitability and establishes initial airfield management and air traffic control procedures. The
airfield operations officer/airfield manager ensures the airfield meets aircraft support/safety
criteria (e.g., obstacles, clear zones, marking, lighting, terminal instrument procedures
[TERPS]). Additionally, this position is trained as an LZSO and LZC, if the 13M officer
maintains tower certifications.
3.3.4. Civil Engineering (CE) Officer and Craftsman (32E/3E5). CE surveys and assesses
required structural and pavement facilities, including airfield pavement assessment/analysis
(pavement classification number [PCN]). Additionally, they identify initial CBRN defense,
ARFF, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) requirements, and verify the potential beddown
area for the follow-on CRE.
3.3.5. Expeditionary Communications (XCOMM) Technician (1D7). XCOMM
technician ensures integrated, full-spectrum communications support for the entire AAT (e.g.,
secure/unsecure beyond line of sight [BLOS] voice and data, secure/unsecure line of sight
[LOS] voice and data).
3.3.6. Security Forces Specialist (3P). The security forces specialist provides initial force
protection and physical security assessment supporting CR operations. They work with
seizure forces and/or HN security to determine augmentation requirements in uncertain and/or
hostile threat environments. They facilitate seamless reception of follow-on security forces,
and establish a security forces link between CR, HN, coalition forces, and sister Services.
They also coordinate base patrols to protect aircraft transiting the airbase. They will normally
prepare the initial force protection plan prior to CR main body arrival at the deployed location
and then update it as required after the airbase assessment.
3.3.7. Any qualified AFSC, Mission Dependent.
3.3.7.1. CRG 7E1AK. This airfield assessment team includes personnel identified on ATT
to include ATC, medical, weather, and logistics readiness personnel.
3.3.8. Other Potential Augmentee Positions.
3.3.8.1. Logistics Readiness Officer/Logistics Planner. Assessing a field’s ability to
support planned cargo and other logistical functions to include fuel operations, vehicle
holding area and material handling equipment, resupply points, and coordination with host
nation for other logistical considerations as required.
3.3.8.2. Aerial Port. Assessing a field’s ability to support planned cargo operations can be
critical. Port personnel can also assess existing materials handling equipment (MHE) on
 
 
3-4
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
the field and determine additional MHE requirements, as required. To the maximum extent
possible, members should be JI and load plan qualified to expedite deployment/redeploy-
ment operations.
3.3.8.3. Intelligence. Intel personnel can directly serve the assessment team by providing
intelligence preparation of the battle-space focusing on potential impact to both ground
and aviation assets within the operating area.
3.3.8.4. Contracting. Provide contracting support and to set up for follow-on CR forces.
They are the only individuals who can commit government resources for the procurement
of local goods and services to support deployed CR forces. They establish initial
contracting relationships and source lists for follow-on and sustainment forces.
3.3.8.5. AFOSI. AFOSI personnel provide a fast, flexible global response force protection
capability, consisting of antiterrorism, counterintelligence collections and investigative
service equipment, to support Air Force and/or DOD force protection operations. AFOSI
deploys to collect human intelligence (HUMINT) derived counter intelligence collection.
3.3.8.6. Medical. The FFGRL/FFGR1 UTCs have the capability to provide limited
medical care for injuries (Role 1) and illness and preventive medical care in support of
force health protection for deployed CR forces. The FFGRL recommends strategies to CR
commanders for countermeasures against environmental and physiological stressors in
order to enhance mission effectiveness. Additionally, they can assess preexisting
infrastructure for bioenvironmental and public health concerns. Although typically not
part of the AAT, members of the FFGRL can deploy with the team if a medical assessment
is required.
3.3.8.7. Air Traffic Control (1C1X1). 1C1’s serve as the primary landing zone and drop
zone controllers enabling increased capability for air operations. Landing zone controllers
are required when more than four of the same type aircraft or, if there are more than two of
any combination of dissimilar type aircraft operating in the same pattern (refer to Air
Mobility Command Instruction [AMCI] 10-2101, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability
Training, paragraph 3.9.1.1). Crew rest and duty day limitations shall be adhered to in
accordance with AFMAN 13-204, Volume 3, Air Traffic Control.

3.4. Equipment. The AAT equipment typically includes one high mobility multipurpose wheeled
vehicle (HMMWV), two all-terrain vehicles, pavement assessment equipment, landing zone
marking kit, very high frequency and ultra-high frequency capable radios, satellite
communications, personal protective equipment, other forms of mission essential equipment and
life support equipment capable of supporting the team for up to 120 hours (A3/AK).
3.4.1. Assessment Communications. The team leader should initiate a communications/
accountability check at the top of every hour. Assessment members should check in at any
time to report significant LIMFAC or any issue affecting force protection. Ensure you develop
a CHATTERMARK/brevity codes plan should primary frequencies become compromised.

the airfield seizure forces (if applicable), HN personnel, or designated representatives to
discuss local operating conditions, area security, and the likelihood of the airfield supporting
the intended mission. In a permissive environment, the assessment activity coordination
should occur through the defense attaché from the US Embassy. If no embassy personnel are
in-country to accomplish the coordination, an NGO or international government organization
(IGO) representative can accomplish this. Additional forces who may accompany the O-6
include: Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) lead, rapid port opening element lead, airfield
operations, civil engineers, security forces, or any organization necessary for the mission.

3.7.2.2. Establish initial communications (relay on station notification and initiate joint
mission essential tasks).
3.7.2.3. Hold in the staging area and await further permissions from the HN (as required)
or direction from team lead. Visually assess the airfield for any major security
issues/impacts. Ensure accountability of all equipment, COMSEC, and weapons.
3.7.2.4. Establish LOS secure voice network.
3.7.2.5. Request permission to assess airfield from HN or airfield authority to execute
airfield assessment functions (execute assessment functional checklist). See Attachment
4, Functional Checklists.
3.8. Transfer of Authority Phase. The airfield assessment phase ends when all assessment
actions by the AAT are accomplished, and the decision is made to either end operations or transfer
the airfield over to CR/follow-on forces. The AAT members may become part of the CR main
body or can reconstitute in place in order to forward deploy to another location and accomplish
another assessment.
3.9. Command/MAJCOM Specific Information.
3.9.1. JPOC Joint Assessment Team (JAT). The JAT provides CCDRs with a quick
reaction joint team capable of performing APOD assessments. The JAT consists of the Air
Force AAT, DLA rapid deployment team (RDT), and members from the Army’s rapid port
opening element (RPOE).
3.9.2. DLA RDT. RDTs can deploy with the AAT to provide a joint expeditionary capability
and rapidly assess and establish a logistics capability in direct support of CCDR requirements.
A DLA support team (DST) consists of a four-person DLA assessment team (DAT) that
includes a commander, information technology (IT) network support, expeditionary
contracting officer, and tailorable position with an unsecure flyaway IT/communications suite.
All of the DST’s equipment is hand carried. They do not bring any life support equipment and
rely on the Air Force element to provide all food, water, electricity, transportation, workspace
(table/chairs), cots, and living space.
3.9.3. Rapid port Opening element (RPOE). The RPOE deploys four Army personnel to
assess capabilities of a clearance yard, forward node, and transportation route security.
3.10. Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMET). USTRANSCOM guidance is linked to mission
essential tasks derived from the universal joint task list and has been converted into JMETs with
accompanying measures, standards, and conditions (as appropriate). JMETs are found in
USTRANSCOMI 10-27, Volume 2. As the JAT is a joint force, ensure members understand and
utilize all joint capabilities. AATs will review the JMETs during the mission analysis phase and
ensure completion in accordance with the required standards during execution. Recommend AATs
bring a copy of the applicable JMETs to their deployed location with an understanding of how
they will accomplish their tasks in time to meet requirements.
3.11. PACAF. The 36 CRG is PACAF’s sole CR Force and uniquely postured in the
USINDOPACOM theater to respond to contingency and humanitarian assistance (HA) and
disaster relief (DR) missions on behalf of Commander, Pacific Air Forces (COMPACAF). Due to
limitations of being located on Andersen Air Force Base, the 36 CRG is on a 72-hour response
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
3-11
 
 
time managed by PACAF/A39. This timeline can be truncated based on opportune airlift
positioned on Andersen Air Force Base and reallocated to movement of the 36 CRG.
3.12. USAFE-AFAFRICA. The 435 CRG is USAFE/AFAFRICA’s sole CR force and is
postured to respond to contingency and HA/DR missions throughout both AORs. The 435 CRG is
comprised of four squadrons with four different capabilities; 435 Contingency Response
Squadron (CRS) (airfield opening, airfield assessment, airfield survey, and airfield operations),
435th Contingency Response Support Squadron (building partnership capacity, CR enablers with
contracting, resource advisors, public affairs, and intelligence, and medical support), 435th
Security Forces Squadron (airfield security and security forces training), and 435th Construction
and Training Squadron (military construction, silver flag training, specialty training (fire, crane),
and aircraft arresting gear). Unique to the 435 CRG, the 7E1AK UTC is an airborne capable AAT
consisting of 12th Air Force CRG personnel capable of fixed-wing/rotary-wing air-land
infiltration, airdrop, or overland employment. The 7E1AK UTC resembles ATT, with the addition
of air traffic control, medical, weather, and logistics readiness personnel.
3.13. Lessons Learned (LL). See Table 3.5, Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB) Air Base Opening
(2019) and Table 3.6, Hurricane Dorian (2019)—Minimum Assessment Timeline for recent
assessment operations LL. Joint lessons learned can be accessed via the Joint Lessons Learned
Information System (JLLIS) at https://www.jllis.mil. Refer to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3150.25H, Joint Lessons Learned Program for more information.

AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
Table 3.5. Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB) Air Base Opening (2019)
Based on lessons learned (LL) from multiple assessments accomplished in the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia, in support of United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) base openings, we 
have learned every airfield assessment is unique and presents its own problem sets. Using the 
baseline of an ingress via military aircraft, bringing the full team and equipment compliment, 
this assessment differed in the following ways:
• The government of Saudi Arabia limited the number of personnel who could initially enter the
country, and our team was limited to three people-contingency response element (CRE)
commander, airfield operations, and civil engineering.
• We flew into the international airport using commercial transportation and carried minimal
equipment. Instead of using our own vehicles, we contracted to rent sport utility vehicles (SUV)
on the local economy (vetting through the US Embassy).
• The initial airfield assessment team (AAT) was cobbled together using the three above
members of the AAT, an already established United States Forces Central Command
(USAFCENT) leadership package, soldiers from a deployed Army logistics battalion, and
deployed rapid engineer deployable heavy operational repair squadron engineer (RED HORSE)
unit. The total team consisted of 12-service members.
• In-region air mobility liaison officer (AMLO) support was crucial to establishing combatant
command (COCOM) specific contacts in minimal time.
• The AAT was initially deployed in order to right size the follow-on contingency response
group (CRG) package for an airbase opening. However, after this was accomplished, it quickly
expanded to establishing a Patriot Missile battery, preparing for civilian and contract airlift
operations, and laying the groundwork for fighter aircraft operations.
• Host Nation (HN) cooperation and negotiation played a major role in this assessment. It took
several days of meetings and confidence building measures to lay eyes on the airfield.
• Although we were confident US military aircraft could land at Prince Sultan Air Base, we
were not granted access to our operations area and ramp until 3-hours prior to the first
contingency response (CR) chalk arrival. In a way, the 4-hour go/no-go occurred-it just took a
long time to hack the initial clock.
• If we were given HN permission to bring additional team members, having a contracting
officer and security forces members would have been very beneficial.
• Bring gifts for HN officials. Follow the rules for gift-giving, but realize the importance of
developing friendships and positive working relationships with your HN counterparts.
• Chalks will rarely land in the planned order-they did not land in order this time.
• Use the HN assets when mutually beneficial. We used the Royal Saudi Air Force aerial port
squadron to help download our first aircraft. Additionally, we used their fire department to
provide additional crash, fire, and rescue (CFR) support.

Table 3.6. Hurricane Dorian (2019)—DIRMOBFOR Minimum Assessment Timeline
• Based on lessons learned (LL) from multiple airfield assessments that occurred after
Hurricane Dorian, a full airfield assessment can be completed in 2 hours.
• Mission planning prior to launch is critical. The most time-consuming portion of any
assessment are accomplishing dynamic cone penetrations (DCP). The priority for the assessment
begins with the no wind landing surface maximum braking area, followed by areas of concern
from cracking, runway center, and the opposite end maximum braking area.
• The ramp can be tested based on the portion that has seen the most stress/cracking. Civil
engineer (CE) can complete a DCP approximately every 20 minutes, to include drilling. In order
to complete this, it is recommended that the 1A assist the two-member CE team to combat
fatigue.
• The airfield operations officer can complete their assessment in 1 hour, based on
measurements and glideslope on each runways approach ends. The runway distance and width
can be calculated by Global Positioning System (GPS). This is only recommended as a course of
action (COA) if a giant report or landing zone (LZ) survey exists and no portion of the runway
has been lost or is undefinable.
• Concurrently with the team operating on the runway, the 11M (or communications member)
should be working with a host nation (HN) member to complete the assessment team (AT)
report, getting local information on the situation on the ground, to include crash, fire, and rescue
(CFR).

Chapter 4
CH4 EXECUTION
EXECUTION
4.1. Overview. This chapter details transition and execution information for all types of CR
forces: CRT, CRE, and joint task force port opening (JTF-PO).
4.2. Contact Information. Upon arrival at the deployed location, ensure CR forces leadership
exchanges contact information with any airfield representatives (e.g., HN, seizure force,
engineering team). This information should include best times and means for contact.
4.3. Arrival/Transition Actions.
4.3.1. Overview. Transition of the air base is a critical and deliberate process that should be
identified and resourced during mission planning for follow-on forces, subsequent roll up, and
reconstitution. Transition for a CR force can include three phases depending on the operation:
(1) transition of the air base from the seizure force; (2) transition of the air base from AAT to
CR forces; and (3) CR forces transition of the air base to follow-on-forces or the HN; (4)
transition from an air base to closure. Transfer of authorities is a tactical event, and tactical
considerations (e.g., communications between parties, go/no-go contracts, procedures for
requesting follow on forces, and command relationships) need to be considered.
4.3.2. Transition from Seizure to an AAT. Transition from a seizure force to CR forces at
the initial airfield and/or air base opening begins either with elements of the CR forces
imbedded or non-imbedded with the seizure force. In accordance with the agile combat
employment (ACE) concept, it is advisable that the AAT infiltrate with the seizure force to
expedite completion of the assessment and subsequent go/no-go for operations. The AAT
would be expected to possess critical skills equivalent to the seizure force such as air assault,
airborne, and so forth. Discussion topics for this are provided in Attachment 4, Functional
Checklists; see Table A4.35, Transition Checklist for Seizure Force to CR Force. The items in
the checklists are prioritized to aid with brevity, depending on the conditions of the operational
environment, and should be completed prior to the formal handover from the seizure force
commander or designated representative and CR forces commander.
4.3.2.1. Seizure force operations may be characterized by forcible entry, such as an
amphibious assault, airborne assault, or air assault operation led by joint land and/or
maritime forces or a deliberate land offensive operation. Non-imbedded CR forces are
elements that are not part of the planned assault, but are called upon to provide airfield
and/or air base opening capabilities following seizure by joint land and/or maritime forces.
4.3.2.2. CR forces should make every effort to contact an AMLO first, preferably one
assigned to the operation. If the seizure force is still fighting for control of the airfield, do
not expect the ground force commander to initially meet the AAT or CR forces
commander. Once control of the airfield is established, expect the ground force
commander to provide the initial situation.
4.3.3. Transition from AAT to CR Forces. Brief pertinent information to CR forces. Refer
to AFTTP 3-2.68, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Airfield Opening,
Appendix C, Airfield Transition Checklist. See Table A4.31, Assessment Team to Main Body
Functional Handover Checklist Contact Checklist.
 
 
4-2
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
4.3.4. Transition from CR Forces to Follow-on-Forces. A significant, but often
overlooked, process in the operations life cycle is transition to follow-on forces and
subsequent roll-up plan. Consideration should be given to the long-term use of the airfield. See
Table A4.36, Transition of CR Forces to Follow-On Forces Checklist.
4.3.5. Airfield Operations Transfer of Authority. Major events and milestones that occur
during a transition of authority between CR forces and designated follow-on airfield
operations personnel. See Table A4.37, Airfield Operations Transfer of Authority checklist.
Refer to JP 4-04 and JP 3-36 for roles and responsibilities for SAA.
4.4. Command Structure (A-Staff) Responsibilities. When deployed, contingency response
organizes into staff functional responsibilities in order to clearly define roles and expectations.
Figure 4.1, CRE A-Staff Structure is an example of how to organize personnel. When tasked as a
JTF-PO the A-Staff structure transitions into J-Staff, see Table A3.12, Joint Staff Organization.
Figure 4.1. CRE A-Staff Structure
4.4.1. JTF-PO Commander. When the mission of the JTF-PO is tasked, the JTF-PO
commander will act as the sole commander of both the CRE and ICTC (Inland Cargo Transfer
Company), which assumed the role of the RPOE in 2023 to get cargo and resources from the
aerial port of entry (APOE) through the ground line of communication (GLOC) to the
requested and area of need.
4.4.2. CRE Commander. In execution, the command structure will have received an order
(with situation, mission, execution, service and support, and command guidance) through the
command structure authorizing forward movement, mission, and authorities granted to the
force. This order details the structure and expectations that you will use in leading the

deployed force. The commander’s focus during execution is up and out; being the conduit of
the CRE to external agencies (e.g., government representatives, airfield management),
however the health and welfare of the attached Airmen will be the CRE commanders’
responsibility until end of mission. Overall authority and responsibility for mission
accomplishment resides with the CRE commander. Of emphasis, determination on SAA
responsibilities is crucial in determining the CRE’s role and authorities in the greater scheme
of the desired end state. See Table A4.1. CRE Commander Checklist.
4.4.3. Defense Force Commander (DFC). Protection of assigned and attached forces is an
inherent responsibility of all commanders (refer to AFDP 3-10, Force Protection). The senior
Air Force commander responsible for the air base normally delegates operational authority to
air base ground defense to the defense force commander (DFC). The DFC directs the planning
and execution of all base defense operations (refer to DAFI 31-101, Base Defense
Operations). The DFC in CR operations is usually the 31P (security forces officer) assigned to
the CRE. The DFC’s primary duties when deployed are to plan and execute the base defense
plan, integrate intelligence products into defense planning, and institute anti-terrorism
measures as appropriate. When faced with threats, CRE commanders should make every effort
to implement the guidance given by their DFC.
4.4.4. CRT Chief. The CRT Chief is a senior noncommissioned officer (SNCO) (unless
waived) 1A1X AFSC that serves as the final mission authority and makes decisions not
explicitly assigned to a higher-level authority. The CRT Chief is in charge of all aspects of
coordination during planning, execution and reconstitution and serves as a conduit between
outside agencies and the CRT. CRT chiefs perform similar tasks as a CRE commander, but
with a smaller team and less equipment that fits on one C-17.
4.4.5. SAA. CR leadership such as AAT leads, CRE commanders and CRT chiefs have
fulfilled SAA roles in real world operations. SAA refers to the airfield management and
terminal airspace control authority (local ATC) at an operating location. For perspective, and
in accordance with DAFMAN 13-204, Volume 2, Airfield Management, SAA at Air Force
installations is identified as the operations group (OG) commander. SAA may be a civil airport
authority, a joint partner, or an allied military partner. Typically, the SAA is a military
commander, usually an O-6, capable of accepting risk for things impacting airfield operations
at an operating location. Delegation of SAA is highly recommended to be determined in
SPINS, especially when planning to operate at a location with joint and/or allied partners. Any
CR forces leaders who think they may be responsible for SAA need to coordinate with theater
J3 or A3 staffs to codify they have SAA. For more information, refer to AFTTP 3-2.68 and JP
4-04.
4.4.6. CRE Senior Enlisted Leader (SEL). The SEL offer’s pertinent guidance to the
commander to in order to facilitate accomplishment of the mission concerning matters such as
training, health, morale, welfare, and quality of life.
4.4.7. Judge Advocate (51J). When attached, the judge advocate is a resource to CRE
leadership when dealing with complex legal situations. They offer legal advice to CRE
leadership during execution.
 
 
4-4
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
4.4.8. Public Affairs (35P). When attached, public affairs can offer advice to CRE leadership
when operations could have derogatory communication influence on the national and/or
international stage.
4.5. A-1 (Personnel).
4.5.1. Personnel (3F0). The personnel support for contingency operations (PERSCO)
specialist coordinates with the deployed support agencies to assist with establishing
reception/departure processing procedures for all personnel deployed to the location. Develop
manual files to manage collected contingency, exercise, deployment (CED) orders and DAF
Form 245, Employment Locator and Processing Checklist. The following should be
accomplished by coordinating with logistics/transportation agencies to allot time for PERSCO
to collect temporary duty (TDY) orders and complete an AF Form 245 for each passenger.
Implement a duty status program according to DAFI 36-3802, Force Support Readiness
Programs. Implement a casualty program according to DAFI 36-3802. Casualty Services.
PERSCO will additionally build a key personnel listing/point of contact (POC) list for internal
use. During reception, PERSCO will receive all inbound personnel, add to roster and issue
accountability cards. During sustainment, PERSCO will be responsible for reporting and
communicating to CRE leadership accountability for all personnel before and after shift
changes. PERSCO shall conduct accountability checks with the tactical operations center
every odd hour, or CRE DO chief directed. Lastly, report to C2 with any and all duty status
changes.
4.6. A-2 (Intelligence).
4.6.1. Intelligence (14N/14O). Primary duty includes regular, recurring brief to commander
regarding global political, social, economic, and military issues that affect the mobility
mission or the environment of locations to which airmen or assets fly. Topics of particular
interest to the commander may include cyber- or space-related threats to US infrastructure;
emerging military threats developed by near-peer adversaries; health or natural disasters which
have the potential to spur humanitarian relief efforts; terrorist threats against US personnel that
may warrant rapid movement of assets or persons; economic, social, or political upheaval in
areas where CRE/CRTs operate; and the current state of development/intent to use or
proliferate weapons of mass destruction by adversary nations.
4.6.2. Emergency Management (3E9). The focal point for chemical, biological,
radiological, nuclear (CBRN) and EM preparation and response for a CRE or CRT. When
operating in a contested environment, emergency managers make recommendations on alarm
conditions and mission oriented protective posture (MOPP) levels. Also, they will be
responsible for identifying and overseeing PAR teams. When deployed with CBRN detection
capabilities, emergency management personnel have the ability to presumptively detect
CBRN hazards and can make recommendations to leaders based on expected hazard duration
times and decontamination options. When deployed supporting HA/DR operations,
emergency managers are the subject matter experts on EM planning, coordination, command,
and control.
4.7. A-3 (Operations).
4.7.1. Mobility Pilots (11M). They fill the role of CRE/A3 and typically do not deploy or
operate under a CRT. The CRE/A3 is primarily responsible for daily airfield operations to
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
4-5
 
 
include oversight of airflow and cargo movements. Typically, the CRE/A3 supports the CRE
commander during initial arrival actions, TOC-tent buildup, sustainment, and redeployment.
In order to achieve 2/24 operations, a minimum of two CRE/A3s should deploy with the CRE
main body. During execution, the CRE/A3 is responsible for tallying feedback and
continuously developing the operational AAR for review and submission to the CRE/CC, post
mission completion. See Table A4.2, CRE/Operations Officer Checklist.
4.7.2. Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) (1A). CEA’s core function is the role of operations
expediter and CRT chief. For CRT chief, see above. As an operations expeditor, they are
responsible for assessing the parking ramp and surrounding surfaces for cargo throughput
capability, cover all safety concerns and control personnel/equipment/vehicle movement.
They are also responsible for production of aircrew brochure, creating and verifying parking
plans with airfield management and/or LZSO, assist LZSO’s in airfield assessment, follow-me
procedures, aircraft marshalling, and oversee movement of pax/cargo/equipment to and from
aircraft. CEAs shall be liaisons between the CR forces and aircrew. Depending on mission set,
the operations expediter can delegate follow-me and marshalling to aircraft maintenance.
CEAs can be certified in additional airfield operations capabilities like LZSO, DZC, sling-load
operations, and load planning.
4.7.3. C2 Operations Specialist (1C3). C2 personnel ensure the horizontal and vertical flow
of communication throughout CR airbase operations. C2 works directly with the CRE
leadership or CRT Chief to ensure all reports are submitted in compliance with tasking orders,
Air Force, and MAJCOM guidance. C2 is responsible for flight following throughout the
tasked mission. When the mission requires 24-hour operations, a minimum of two 1C3’s
should be deployed; however, it is recommended to have more available. See Table A4.21,
Mobile C2 Controller Checklist.
4.7.4. Airfield Operations (13M). Airfield operations officers are the focal point of activity
on the airfield and surrounding airspace (referred to as an aerodrome or airfield system). The
13M career field education and training plan (CFETP) trains 13Ms in airfield management, air
traffic, and RAWS maintenance functions. As the focal point of airfield operations trained in
airfield core competencies, 13Ms execute airfield operations associated and/or in coordination
senior airfield authority. They arrive with the advanced echelon, establish initial airfield
operations, receive follow-on CR forces. Once the main CRE is established, 13Ms oversee
daily operations and interface with joint, combined, and host nation equivalents ensuring the
execution of CRE operations. They serve as AAT and AST members, and leaders; they serve
as CRE operations officers, CRE commanders, and on the CRE A/J-staff in the A/J-3 staff
role. They are trained LZSOs, can perform LZC duties (with tower training), they can attend
the advanced airfield manager’s course (SEI 368) course, they are eligible for the CAPE
course, Army pathfinder, air assault course.
4.7.5. Airfield Management (1C7). The airfield manager provides many functions to the
CRE and CRT with the ultimate responsibility of ensuring a safe and effective airfield. The
airfield manager is typically the execution authority of SAA responsibilities while providing
risk assessment to the appropriate authority for waivers. It is required in accordance with AFI
10-202 that the LZSO is comprised of two certified members. Limitations are provided within
AFI 10-202 related to traffic warranting a LZC. The airfield manager also has the unique
 
 
4-6
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
capability of performing suitability analysis in conjunction with a civil engineer while
performing airfield surveys and assessments.
4.7.5.1. While on the CRE the airfield manager works with the airfield operations team
providing LZSO/DZS support as well as providing the CRE CC and DOs with critical risk
analysis of current operations, future operations, and LIMFACs related to aircraft, vehicle,
and personnel movement on and near the airfield surfaces. There are two airfield managers
on the CRE. One has a 368 SEI, and the other is a 7 level. The 368 holder will be the
airfield manager and the second will be an airfield management shift lead. The 7 level is
the representative of the 368 holder when they are not on shift.
4.7.5.2. While on a CRT the airfield manager performs all the duty’s as they would on the
CRE. However, they are the only airfield operations career field. Due to this, the airfield
manager will run the air operations flight (AOF) and ATC checklist as applicable. See
Table A4.4, Airfield Operations Officer Checklist, Table A4.5, Airfield Management
Checklist, and Table A4.6, ATC Checklist.
4.7.6. Radar, Airfield, Weather Systems (1C8). Prior to tasking the TRN-41 tactical air
navigation (TACAN) for deployment, the radar airfield weather systems, technician will need
to complete a system operational check, that of which could be found in TO
31R4-2TRN41-6WC-1, Schedule Periodic Inspection Workcard--TACAN Navigational
Set--ANTRN-41. After the operational check has been conducted and the TACAN has passed
inspection, the RAWS technician will submit a frequency request with communications
support with 618 AOC Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) and review airfield data, if
available for the location that the TRN-41 will be functioning. After the frequency request has
been submitted the RAWS technician will want to send an email to AMC TERPS for CONUS
locations and for outside the continental United States (OCONUS) deployments, you will need
to contact the TERPS of the specific AOR. The proceeding arrival actions will be as follows;
the RAWS technician will coordinate with the 13M or airfield manager who is tasked with the
CRE to contact the airfield authority to request a site survey in accordance with TO
31R4-2TRN41-2, Organizational Maintenance Instructions--Navigational Set. The survey
should assist in determining the optimal location for the setup of the radar with little to zero
impedance. Next, establishing reference data and equipment status tracking procedures will
take place, preventative maintenance inspection timelines, and coordinating equipment outage
reporting procedures with ATC. Once the system is up and running daily generator and fault
checks will be completed as well as preventive maintenance inspections (PMI) as needed.
Redeployment will consist of post operational checks and inventory/repack equipment for
redeployment.
4.7.7. Air Traffic Control (1C1). Two air traffic controllers are an organic part of CRE
deployments with the ability to bolt-on two additional controllers. Without the bolt-on, the
CRE is capable of providing 12 hours of air traffic control service up to 6 days. With the
bolt-on, the CRE is capable of providing 24 hours of air traffic control service up to 6 days.
Waiver authority and procedures for controllers to work more than 10 hours a day or more than
6 consecutive days is outlined in AFMAN 13-204, Volume 3. Detailed planning
considerations and capabilities are outlined in the AFTTP 3-2.68, Multi-service Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Airfield Opening, Chapter 1. Air traffic controllers typically
assume the role of LZSO, DZC with other A3 members and act as primary LZC if
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
4-7
 
 
forecasted/actual traffic conditions are met as defined by AFI 10-202. Air traffic controllers
are not organic to the CRT or CONUS CR AATs. However, they are organic to the 7E1AK
airfield assessment UTC for the 435 CRG.
4.7.8. Weather (1W0X1). Weather technicians provide and arrange for weather support
requirements for CR missions, exploiting geospatial, environmental, and meteorological data
to assess potential impacts during mission planning and execution. The core function that
weather provides is observed surface observations for LZ, DZ, and airfield operations with
limited or no indigenous weather footprint. Additionally, weather Airmen forecast and issue
watches, warnings, and advisories to ensure safety of flight and resource protection. They also
act as environmental science subject matter experts, advising the CRE commander or CRT
chief on climatological effects on personnel and equipment, geographical intelligence, and
local flora and fauna.
4.8. A-4 (Logistics and Support).
4.8.1. Security Forces Specialist (3P). The security forces specialist provides initial force
protection and physical security assessment supporting CR operations. They work with
seizure forces and/or HN security to determine augmentation requirements in uncertain and/or
hostile threat environments. They facilitate seamless reception of follow-on security forces,
and establish a security forces link between CR, HN, coalition forces, and sister Services.
They also coordinate base patrols to protect aircraft transiting the air base. They will normally
prepare the initial force protection plan prior to CR main body arrival at the deployed location
and then update it as required after the air base assessment. This should be in coordination
with information received from the intelligence analyst. See Table A4.26, Security Forces
Checklist.
4.8.2. Logistics Readiness Officer (21R). The logistics readiness officer (LRO) is the
primary lead to oversee all logistical components of the mission to include the following:
mobility operations, supply, aerial port, fuel, vehicle management, traffic management, and
logistics plans. The LRO will work closely with CRE leadership in all phases of mission
planning, execution, and redeployment in order to assist with proper logistics execution and
sustainment of forces.
4.8.3. Aerial Porter (2T2). The aerial port operations element provides joint inspection,
hazardous material inspection, load planning, ITV, MHE support, cargo service, and passenger
service functions. Upon arrival air transportation personnel will initiate air mobility operations
by establishing an air terminal operations center (ATOC), cargo yard, and passenger holding
areas. They integrate, if available, with the arrival/departure airfield control group (A/DACG)
and other units, as appropriate, to establish and coordinate air movement processes. See Table
A4.9, Aerial Port Checklist
4.8.4. Vehicle Maintenance (2T3). The vehicle maintenance element provides overall
vehicle management expertise and triage vehicle repair and MHE repair. They provide all
accountability of vehicles assigned to CRE/CRT and are responsible for the vehicle parking
and dispersal plans. They will also coordinate/conduct limited technical inspections for
vehicles in preparation for air transportation. They will work closely with the logistics
function and LRO. See Table A4.28, Vehicle Management Checklist.
 
 
4-8
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
4.8.5. Traffic Management (2T0). The traffic management element provides critical line
haul, route planning, customs clearance, cargo build up, and hazardous material preparation,
and technical inspection for increment monitors for CR forces. Although the CR enterprise
does not have traffic management office (TMO) personnel, they still play a critical role in
deploying and supporting CR missions. In the past, TMO has been sourced from local logistics
readiness squadrons (LRS) or commands to be bolted on to CR forces.
4.8.6. Logistics Plans (2G0). Logistics planner element provides critical and essential
logistic planning for deployment and redeployment of CR forces. They are the focal point of
managing the time phase force deployment data and provide insight to CRE leadership on key
timelines for forces transitioning inter/intra-theater movements. Additionally, they provide
airlift request expertise in communicating with AOCs and deployment distribution operation
cells (DDOC).
4.8.7. Supply (2S0). Supply element manages the sustainment element of the CR forces,
providing Class I/II/III/V/(VII as required) functions. They can be UTC managers for the
CRE/CRT and are the focal point with ensuring equipment accounts are postured for
deployment and work closely with contracting and the LRO to support logistic functions.
4.8.8. Fuels Specialist (2F0). Fuels specialist (i.e., POL) coordinates, validates, and
maintains accurate accounting for ground fuel consumption, resupply, and storage to ensure
mission execution and sustainment. They will work with Air Force Petroleum Office
(AFPET), regional Defense Logistics Agency-Energy (DLA-E) offices, sub-area petroleum
office (SAPO), liaison officers (LNO) and report to CRE leadership any sourcing or resupply
issues. If required, work with contracting to ensure on specification fuel is properly sourced
through DLA-E approved location(s). POL personnel are the subject matter experts on special
fueling operations (SFO) and their capabilities. Builds local tracker that reports current
inventory, date of next resupply, consumption rate/projections, and infrastructure/equipment
status. Communicates findings to A4/C2 for daily operations report/nightly SITREPs.
4.8.9. Aircraft Maintenance (2A5 and 2A3). Aircraft maintenance focuses on immediate
needs to sustain aircraft readiness and operation capability. This involves rapid assessment,
repair and maintenance to ensure aircraft remain operational during contingency operations.
Aircraft maintenance also plays a pivotal role in developing the aircraft parking plan to
include contingency MOG, hot cargo area, engine run areas, etc.
4.8.10. Aerospace Ground Equipment (2A6) and Electrical Power Production (3E0).
Aerospace ground equipment (AGE) and electrical power production (PP) personnel ensure
generators as well as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units and power distribution are
maintained. AGE and PP personnel establish procedures for hazardous waste, gray water,
sewage, and refuse disposal. Oversee maintenance and sustainment of CR force facilities and
infrastructure (includes work centers, sleeping facilities, latrines, showers, power production,
and water source). See Table A4.10, AGE/Power Production Checklist.
4.9. Civil Engineer (32E). CE officers oversee the beddown of all CR forces, including work
centers, sleeping facilities, latrines, power production, and water sources. On initial deployment,
they validate the beddown plans and oversee the erection of all structures (TOC tent, personnel
beddown tents). Beddown can also entail securing off-base and on-base lodging and work centers.
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
4-9
 
 
As a member of the assessment team, the CE officer validates the weight bearing capacity and
suitability of airfield pavements and unpaved surfaces.
4.10. A-6 (Communications).
4.10.1. Cyber Defense Operations (1D7). Cyber defense personnel are responsible to
provide secure and unsecure internal team communications and beyond line of site
communications. They coordinate with CRE/CRT leaders to coordinate antenna locations,
satellite communications (SATCOM) look angles, TOC location, fuel
containment/safety/munitions storage, grounding locations, rainwater accumulation, power
lines and generator placement. They brief necessary personnel on emergency action plans and
locations of hazardous zones. They establish expeditionary communications capabilities to
include both LOS and BLOS voice and data, and situational awareness/common operating
picture equipment as applicable in accordance with UTC requirements. They
distribute/maintain tactical radios and ensure accountability of controlled cryptographic items
(CCI). They work with C2 personnel to create a communications plan and ensure a PACE plan
is established to guarantee communications requirements are met. See Table A4.13,
Communications Checklist and Figure 4.2, Communications Card Example.
Figure 4.2. Communications Card Example
4.11. Reporting Procedures. Required reports and submission guidance is found in AFMAN
10-206, Operational Reporting (OPREP), AFI 10-202, and USTRANSCOMI 10-27. The
following reports are those required for most AMC/USTRANSCOM CR force operations. Refer
to specific MAJCOM or HHQ guidance for submission of required reports, templates, and
timelines-typically from released orders (e.g., EXORD, WARNORD). Each of these report
 
 
4-10
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
templates should be tailored during the mission preparation phase in accordance with the tasked
mission. After creating report templates, transfer to SIPRNET, as required.
4.11.1. On-Station. Submit an initial verbal on-station report to the controlling agency within
60 minutes of arrival (120 minutes for airdrop insertion), via secure means (voice/data as
available). Initial data copy is not required if reported to the controlling agency via secure
voice. Submit a revised on-station report as soon as CR forces are prepared to begin
operations. Use this report to identify limiting factors to mission execution.
4.11.2. Execution Checklist (ExCheck). Upon arrival to the deployed location, the team
leader's designated representative will ensure the completion of the ExCheck and report up the
chain to the team lead if any actions are delayed, allowing for issue identification and
manpower reallocation, as needed. Refer to the Air Force Combat Support TTP Repository:
https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/TTP/pages/cr-core.aspx for an example ExCheck.
4.11.3. SITREP. Commanders will ensure that these formats and timelines are adhered to
only with concurrence of the controlling agency. Commanders will ensure that the SITREP
includes limiting factors to mission execution, location workload, threat environment, force
protection condition (FPCON), airfield capability, equipment status, personnel availability,
and sustainment requirements. Commanders will ensure that the SITREP also contains any
medical, legal or diplomatic problems or changes in the host base/force and deployed force
working relationship. Commanders ensure that reports are sequentially numbered starting with
001.
4.11.4. Sustainment/Resupply Requests. It is critical that CR forces leadership understand
classes of supply requiring sustainment, current supply levels, daily use of those products,
resupply timeline, and status of the resupply. At a minimum, include the class of supply
requested, the quantity of sustainment, and how often each item is required. Mission
requirements dictate which classes are required for sustainment. A technique for leadership to
use for awareness is a PowerPoint® stoplight chart showing the status of sustainment
products. Update the request as required and send to higher HHQ when a status changes that
requires immediate help or coordination. Sustainment products may be procured via the local
economy but should still be tracked.
4.11.5. Request for Forces. Depending on changes to FPCON, ALR, or follow-on force
mission requirements, CR forces may need to coordinate with CCMD/JTF, HN, DOD, and/or
interagency organizations to help establish the request for forces (RFF) or transition operation
requirement. Ensure to pass required capabilities and not a specific unit or force to fill that
capability. For example, 24-hour port capabilities to support a wMOG of 2 for 24 hours.
4.11.5.1. Realize that request for forces and request for support are entirely two different
types of requests. A request for forces, is a request for specific manpower in which you
have the authority to use them for whatever you deem fit. This request routes to the
Secretary of Defense (SecDef) through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS),
and the SecDef balances the request supporting said combatant commander against the
needs of competing combatant commanders. A request for support is a request for a
specific capability, and the validator will determine what that request will be filled with.
The request for support is a temporary one and will typically last only 45 days.
NOTE: If authored with enough detail, these reports can be used to develop the AAR.
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
4-11
 
 
4.11.6. AAR. Provide AARs to the controlling agency in accordance with MAJCOM
guidance. The AAR should contain a summary of the contingency, exercise or operational
mission supported and a brief description of the concept of operations, CR force roles and
responsibilities, airlift volume and reliability statistics, problem areas and lessons learned. In
each area where problems are encountered, the problem should be described, together with
causes, impact, and solutions/recommended solutions. Specific facts and information are
needed to help solve problems and prevent future forces from repeating the same mistakes.
Recommend any processes as a lesson learned or community best practice. For lessons learned
assistance, CR forces can contact their MAJCOM A9 Directorate, United States Air Force
Expeditionary Center A9 and/or the Air Force Lessons Learned Center.
4.11.7. DP&E. CR forces will ensure that the controlling agency is provided updates on
deployed manpower and equipment. The format will be at the discretion of the controlling
agency. Update this report when manpower and equipment changes occur or when requested
by the controlling agency. Sequentially number the reports starting with 001.
4.11.7.1. Department of the Air force (DAF) and CCIR reporting DAF and CCIR reports
use command and control channels to immediately notify commanders of any significant
event or incident that rises to the level of MAJCOM, headquarters (HQ) USAF, or DOD
interests. Submit reports in accordance with theater and MAJCOM directives, SPINS, and
applicable regulations.
NOTE: Refer to the following 1C3 Intelink for the current DAF reporting matrix:
https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/afcommandpost/
NOTE: Recommend uploading AAR to the following SharePoint® site in addition to unit
directed archives for community wide dissemination: https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/TTP/CRRep/.
4.11.8. APOD JAT Report. This product is specific to CR airfield assessments. See Chapter
5, Airfield Survey and Assessment for additional information.
4.11.9. Off Station. To be annotated in conjunction with the final SITREP of the executed
mission. When filled in, deployed forces are not required to call in their off-station report
unless the plan changes. If the redeployment plan changes, a secure voice report is required
daily to the controlling agency until arrival at final destination.
4.12. CR Forces Working Groups (WG). WGs are an enduring or ad hoc organization formed
around a specific function whose purpose is to provide analysis to users. During operations,
leadership utilize the WG function to help analyze the situation and make decision
recommendations to the CR forces commander. See below for example WGs, the following is not
an all-encompassing list.
4.12.1. TWG. The TWG is the CR forces focal point for coordinated threat and risk analysis
in support of the mission. The TWG provides the CR forces commander, with functionally
integrated risk assessments and mission execution recommendations which mitigate threat and
security vulnerabilities. The TWG typically is made up of the following personnel if available:
security forces lead, emergency management, intelligence, AFOSI, Airfield Management, and
team leadership. The chair should be linked with the HHQ TWG, chaired by the A-2.
4.12.2. Logistics Working Group. The members consist of the team leadership, CR LRO,
the supported force logistics staff and logistics planners, logistics operations leads, the
 
 
4-12
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
supported mission generation force lead and maintenance officer or SNCO to maximize
communication and minimize delays to operations. They should jointly prioritize cargo and
passenger missions/chalks.
4.12.3. Civil-Military Operations WG. This group serves as an informal body that meets to
discuss policy and mission related issues relevant to civilian and military personnel. The group
is typically for HA/DR missions and acts as a forum for collaborative problem solving.
• Chair-CR forces commander.
• Members-CRE/commander, CRE/operations officer, LRO, airfield operations
(AOF/airfield manager [AFM]), CE, all NGO’s, and user.
4.13. COP. To the maximum extent, CR forces should utilize a COP for optimal situational
awareness. COPs should be pre-coordinated and built ahead of arrival to the operating location.
Use approved tools (i.e., Command and Control Incident Management Emergency Response
Application [C2IMERA]), to establish a live COP with close to real time updates.

CH5 CLOSURE, REDEPLOYMENT, AND RECONSITITUTION
CLOSURE, REDEPLOYMENT, AND RECONSTITUTION
5.1. Closure Overview. Closure of the air base is a critical and deliberate process that should be
identified and resourced during mission planning. Once the base’s primary mission has drawn
down, deployed commanders can begin the process of drawing down the primary base functions.
At the direction of the CCDR, closure for a CR force has five phases, pre-planning, execution
planning, execution, roll-up, and reconstitution.
5.1.1. Pre-planning. Prior to arrival to deployed location, a withdrawal working group
should be created and should consist of SMEs requisite for planning steps to close the air base.
CR forces assigned the mission to close a base, all of the coordination agencies (e.g., US
Embassy, warfighting headquarters [WFHQ], TACC, home units) should be notified in
advance and a priority/urgency sequence of events must be established at the general officer
level. Without prior notification, the process takes much longer. The closure deadline should
be common knowledge at the deployed site.
5.1.2. Host Nation Agreements. The CCDR’s staff will lead in negotiating HN agreements
with US Embassy staff. The termination of military operations ends with a transition to
civilian control. The result will be a timely, efficient, and effective closure that leaves a
positive message with the HN and that properly marshals US forces and equipment for future
employment.
5.1.3. Execution Planning. Upon arrival, commanders should instruct the team to identify
how to phase out certain activities and functions as the base population begins to decrease. The
drawdown of operations may require reversing the buildup process, including a second
deployment of initial entry air traffic control (ATC) assets who are able to operate without base
support (e.g., Marine air traffic control mobile team [MMT], Army tactical aviation control
team [TACT], or Air Force special tactics team [STT]) to allow for joint force withdrawal. The
end of operations will require a transition or phaseout of ATC services.
5.2. Redeployment. Redeployment planning should commence upon arrival, in preparation to
return to home station or forward deploy and be completed at least three days prior to departure.
This plan forecasts how to end operations and start equipment preparation for redeployment. Plans
should be informed by each functional subject matter expert (SME) to facilitate a smooth
transition and ensure coverage of all functional areas of concern in airfield and air base operations.
At a minimum, the plan should include a list of personnel and equipment, proposed chalk order
sequence, and draft load plans. When reducing CR force capabilities (e.g., from 2/24 wMOG to
1/12), it is important to report change to HHQs.
5.2.1. Roll-Up Plan. In effort to complete a full redeployment of CR forces, the roll-up plan
should capture the phasing down of equipment and capabilities from each functional at a time
which allows the wMOG to decrease. The roll-up plan ties into the overall redeployment plan,
but is focused mainly on equipment prepositioning. For example, a roll-up plan can be
executed three days prior to departure, with each function packaging and prepositioning their
equipment for redeployment/forward deploying. Consideration should be given to preparing
equipment as best as possible before returning to home station to make reconstitution quick
and easy. See Table A4.39, Redeployment/Roll-Up Checklist.
 
 
5-2
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
5.2.2. Example Timeline. Roll-up should begin at least 12 hours prior to the last estimated
aircraft departure for redeployment. However, most actions will begin upon redeployment
notification (i.e., airlift request). Joint inspection for roll-up should begin 6 hours prior to the
first aircraft arrival for redeployment. See Table A4.38, Redeployment/Roll-Up Plan Timeline
Guide. An actual roll-up timeline will be based on airlift schedule.
5.3. Reconstitution. Team leads are responsible for ensuring reconstitution of personnel and
equipment are accomplished. Key considerations to support returning forces should facilitate
transition back to mission ready status and reconstitution for future deployments. This process
entails planning that will return units back to their full combat capability in a short time.
5.3.1. Considerations. While there is no one set way to conduct reconstitution,
considerations should be given to completing a full inventory and function check of all items
in each increment prior to placing items back into their storage spaces Additionally, team leads
should ensure consumables are restored from what was expended during the mission/tasking
and coordinate to recover lost training. Use the weapons roster to verify with each person who
checked out a weapon that they have returned it to the appropriate armory or have the proper
documentation to account for transfer of responsibility.
5.3.2. Situation. Every base/unit will have to assess their own situation based on variables
such as the magnitude, duration, and intensity of a mission/tasking, consumption rates, and the
operational location (i.e., fixed versus austere base). Build a schedule based on aircraft/truck
return time. To the maximum extent, personnel and equipment should be returned to a
deployable state within 72 hours of return to home station. Sometimes this may not be possible
due to phased redeployment or extended travel times of equipment. See Table A4.40,
Reconstitution Checklist.

Attachment 2
ATT2 MISSION PLANNING CELL
MISSION PLANNING CELL (MPC)
A2.1. Introduction. MPCs are responsible for the planning and execution of CR force missions.
The purpose of an MPC is to gather and process verbal or written higher headquarters orders.
When executed correctly, the MPC streamlines the flow of information for CR forces during
deployment and redeployment operations in a contingency environment. This attachment outlines
the objectives, personnel requirements, duties, and processes in which the MPC derives
information and develops plans for CR forces. For additional information on MPC operations,
refer to AFTTP 3-3.IPE, Combat Fundamentals, Integrated Planning and Employment, Chapter
2, Mission Planning Methodology; AFTTP 3-4.7, Contingency Response Forces, Chapter 2,
Mission Preparation; and AMCI 11-207, Weapons and Tactics Program, Chapter 7, Deployed
Weapons and Tactics Flight. See Table A2.2, Mission Planning Checklist.
A2.2. Focus. The MPC’s primary focus is the delivery of a thorough, high-quality, flexible
mission plan that CR forces can successfully accomplish. With this focus, MPC planners work in
a prioritized order to develop the plan. The mission, environment, enemy, effects, capabilities,
plan, phasing, contracts, and contingencies (ME3C-(PC)2) planning methodology described in
AFTTP 3-3 provides guidance on establishing planning priorities. ME3C-(PC)2 provides the
foundation for the tactical plan and dictates what options are available during mission planning
through examination of several factors: (1) mission requirements (e.g., commander’s intent); (2)
mission environment (e.g., terrain, weather, political); (3) enemy (e.g., capabilities, intentions, and
likely/most-lethal COAs); (4) effects (e.g., to mitigate threats); and (5) capabilities (e.g., blue
force assets to achieve effects). With this foundation, planners can begin planning from the
objective area backwards. As planning commences, planners should consider the various phases
of the mission, the contracts required to support effective package integration and the
contingencies operators may face in execution. This methodology provides the proper context for
planning and helps planners work from broad aspects of the mission (e.g., phasing and integration)
to the finer details needed for proper execution (i.e., force protection).
A2.3. Functions and Objectives. The main functions of an MPC are to break out and analyze the
published order, determine the unit’s ability to meet given tasking, recommend alternatives when
not able to comply, publish directives (e.g., SPINS/ROE), and generate mission materials for the
deploying forces. The main objectives of an MPC are to determine manpower and equipment
required to meet specified and implied tasks, develop, and brief the tasked mission and to provide
deploying forces with a complete set of materials needed to execute the plan successfully. In time
critical contingency planning the adherence to standard MPC organization and guidance is critical.
The discipline built through training and knowledge of guiding publications is a foundation that
will be used by members to enable them to form an MPC swiftly but expertly and begin
developing plans and products for deploying forces. It is also important that the discipline that
comes from adherence to published guidance will keep the MPC focused on important tasks and
not distracted by the rush of events. Remember that slow is smooth-smooth is fast.
A2.4. Organization. The MPC should be led by a single mission planning cell chief and two
shifts (as required) of mission planners. Each shift should be led by its own deputy MPC chief
who is responsible to the MPC chief for their shift’s work. The MPC coordinates with and is
answerable to the deploying mission commander but should not be staffed by any deploying
forces. This protects deploying members from the demands of mission planning during their
 
 
A2-2
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
deployment preparation. It also protects the MPC from losing critical personnel in the middle of
the mission planning process. For alert, the MPC staff should be identified on the alert support
roster and recalled per local alert recall guidance.
A2.4.1. Structure. Actual structure will depend on availability of MPC members. Multiple
MPC positions may be filled by a single member based on planning priorities, expertise,
workload, and availability. Positions may also be eliminated or consolidated as mission
requirements dictate. See Figure A2.1, MPC Structure.
Figure A2.1. MPC Structure
A2.5. Roles and Responsibilities.
A2.5.1. Mission Planning Cell Chief. The mission planning cell chief (MPCC) is the
Airman in command of the MPC. The MPCC is responsible for ensuring that planning is
thorough, accurate, and timely. The MPCC has authority for coordinating actions required to
plan and execute CR force taskings. The MPCC should be the most qualified individual
available, regardless of seniority; however, seniority and maturity are critical to the MPCC’s
success and should be factors in this appointment.
A2.5.2. Deputy Mission Planning Cell Chief. The deputy mission planning cell chiefs
(DPMCC) assist the MPCC with the operation of the MPC and ensures compliance with the
vision for the overall mission planning process. There should be one DPMCC per MPC shift.
These individuals serve as the supervisor of the MPC, ensuring timelines are met, products are
well integrated and executable, and that mission planning remains well guided and focused.
The DMPCC steps up to run the MPC when the MPCC is occupied with extensive
coordination/liaising. The DMPCC should be highly experienced in both MPC and operations.

A2.5.3. Intelligence. The Intelligence planning representative will keep the MPC aware of
pertinent changes in threats. The intelligence planning rep will prepare intelligence briefings
for deploying CR forces. They will develop the periodic and relevant intelligence updates at
the deployed location.
A2.5.4. Hard Crew Lead. The hard crew lead will match required personnel with
trained/qualified personnel available to the CR force commander/chief.
A2.5.5. TMW Lead. The TMW lead will develop the worksheet from COAs developed by
the MPC. This member is responsible for ensuring that the worksheet is compliant with the
unit’s deployment process.
A2.5.6. Airfield Operations. The airfield operations lead will gather information that should
include airfield suitability and the determination to conduct a survey/assessment if suitability
information is unavailable. Develop the parking plan and vehicle control plan, provide
information to the airfield brochure, and assist with development of the beddown and
emergency action plan.
A2.5.7. Defense Force Commander. The integrated defense planner will normally be an
experienced security forces member. They will develop the integrated defense plan and
coordinate all security requirements.
A2.5.8. Weapons and Ammunition. The weapons and ammunition planner should generate
a list of personnel who will be arming and confirm each member who is arming is current and
qualified to arm on the firearms they will be assigned to include any heavy weapons. The
arming list will be coordinated with the armory. This planner will also develop the
transportation plan for weapons and ammunition from cargo build up,
deployment/redeployment phases, and employment in place. They will also ensure a weapons
accountability roster is built to ensure serial numbers for each weapon can be annotated next to
each member.
A2.5.9. SME. The SMEs will usually be the equipment leads from the alert support roster.
This can include, but is not limited to finance, contracting AGE, aerial port, aircraft
maintenance, vehicle operations and maintenance, public affairs, legal, current operations,
UMD, contingency response wing (CRW) XP/XPL, IDO, and all other specialties available or
required by the mission. SMEs should also include members of the ICTC, DLA, AFOSI, LRS,
and ariel port squadron (APS), and any supported or supporting agencies (e.g., CCDR staff,
AMC, 18 AF) when they are available. They will advise the MPC on UTC capabilities and
requirements, be available to answer any UTC specific questions, and participate in all murder
boards. SMEs may also be called in from the RPOE, DLA, and any other organization who
will be serving with the deploying CR force.
A2.5.10. Recording and Administration. The recording and administration member will
have two primary responsibilities. First, they are responsible for collecting any products that
leave the MPC to either the wing control center (WCC), DET, or deploying forces and
maintaining version control over those products. Second, they will maintain and events log to
assist the after-action review. For insight and experience, reach back to MAJCOM lessons
learned offices, Air Force Lessons Learned, or engage with onsite active collection SMEs.
Data collection can be conducted by a 1C3, a CRE/operations officer candidate, or an
 
 
A2-4
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
experienced CRT chief (recommend non 1C3 members complete the mobile C3 operations
course).
A2.5.11. Communication. The XCOMM member will assess communication needs based on
tasking, SPINS, and potential threats. Additionally, they will offer direction on site layout,
ensuring efficient equipment placement and meeting line-of-sight criteria to boost
communication effectiveness. Their responsibilities include ensuring deploying forces possess
sufficient communication gear, personnel, and necessary information. They will also oversee
cryptographic requirements, frequency authorizations, satellite access authorizations, and
gateway access authorizations for deploying forces. Collaboration with partner forces will
ensure smooth communication interoperability, effectively aligning operational capabilities.
A2.5.12. Civil Engineer. The civil engineering team is responsible for building the camp
layout/beddown plan in accordance with Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 10-219, Volume 5,
Bare Base Conceptual Planning and AFPAM 10-219, Volume 6, Planning and Design of
Expeditionary Airbases.
A2.5.13. Medical. Medical members will identify any medical threats to deploying CR
forces, develop a mitigation plan, and identify medical support requirements at the deployed
location. They will serve as the primary liaison between the CR forces and home station
medical group.
A2.5.14. LRO. The LRO member will determine the required number of consumables (e.g.,
meals, ready to eat (MRE), water, ammunition, insect repellent, sunscreen) for the deploying
forces will require for the first five days of operations. They will coordination with all the
respective A4 functionals and contracting to continually assess the resupply plan to ensure
supplies are flowing to deployed forces before their stocks reach critical levels.
A2.5.15. Assessment Team. The assessment team will have a limited role in the MPC.
Generally, the assessment team or designated members will collect as much information as
possible about the objective area, develop COAs, and ensure the members are ready to deploy.
They should also ensure that the MPC has a means of communicating with the assessment
team once it arrives at the deployed location to ensure MPC can receive airfield assessment
information, feedback on actual field conditions, and any unforeseen or changed requirements
resulting from the assessment.
A2.5.16. Integration. The integration member is responsible for reaching out to the other
organizations who will be participating in an exercise or operation, especially the supported
command or organizations. They will develop avenues of communication with supported
commands or organizations as well as any other players in the operational area (OA). They
will also identify any capabilities or shortfalls that other organizations will deploy with and
ensuring the CR MPC can fill any gaps of the supported commands or organizations. When
able, organizations that the team will integrate with or work alongside should participate in
MPCs when able either virtually or in person.
A2.6. Predeployment Planning.
A2.6.1. Initial Actions. Immediately after receipt of a verbal or published order (e.g.,
WARNORD, planning order [PLANORD], EXORD) the MPC will stand up and assemble in
a predetermined location. The MPCC will be identified and will ensure MPC members are
called up and assigned specified roles, either from the alert support roster or as the MPCC
 
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
A2-5
 
 
determines necessary if not an alert call up. If necessary, the MPCC will also develop a
manning plan for sustained 24/7 operations. The entire MPC will then determine specified and
implied tasks from the orders. Next, they should determine known (facts), assumed
(assumptions), unknown information (e.g., RFI), and identify applicable lessons learned. The
MPCC will determine mission commander’s requirements and then break the MPC out to their
specified roles. The MPCC will also finalize the MPC’s battle rhythm at this time.
A2.6.2. Progress Checks. The DMPCC should hold a brief progress check meeting with the
MPC to pass information and determine the most recent status of the plan. Then, the DMPCC
should confirm the time and task completion requirements for the next progress check. It
should come about 2 hours later and last 10 to 15 minutes. When gathering the MPC and asset
representatives is difficult, meetings of the whole group should be minimized and the DMPCC
should work one on one to coordinate requirements. The exact progress check time and task
completion requirements will vary depending on the missions assigned.
A2.6.3. Murder Board. The murder board is held at a pre-established time. This meeting
gives all members present the opportunity to assess the plan and identify critical LIMFACs
and shortfalls. It is not intended as a progress check where planners simply brief the status of
their work. It is intended as a forum for members to critically analyze all aspects of the plan to
ensure it is integrated and executable. Murder boards should be attended by all SMEs. This is
their forum to advocate for or against their UTC’s inclusion in any given plan. An effective
means of conducting the murder board is to analyze the mission chronologically to identify
gaps where critical phases of the mission merge. However, the chosen format will depend on
the operational situation and how much mission information is available at the time. It should
take no more than 30 minutes but may vary depending on the complexity of the mission
objectives. Enemy most likely and most dangerous courses of action should be used as the
yardstick for plan effectiveness.
A2.6.4. Contingency Planning. Planning is still critical to identifying capabilities, gaps,
weaknesses and LIMFACs. Contingency plans must be developed to meet both the enemy’s
most likely and most dangerous courses of action. They should also be developed for aircraft
delays, any vehicle or aircraft breakdowns, changes in FPCON, and so forth. By developing
these plans, the MPC will create a framework to deal with enemy action and can use that
framework even if the enemy surprises them. Contingency planning is not a prescription that
must be strictly followed but a means of thinking through potential scenarios. A review of
lessons learned from similar past events should be performed to assist with contingency
planning.
A2.6.5. Sustained Operations. A deployment may take several days to accomplish due to
the size of the deploying forces, distance of the deployment and available airlift. As deploying
forces arrive at the deployed location, they will gain further insights into the operating
environment that will modify the MPC’s initial plans. As soon as an MPCC sees that planning
will require several days to complete, they should divide the MPC into shifts to sustain
24-hour coverage for several days. It is also critical to ensure that lines of communication are
formed between the deployed forces and the MPC to ensure planning meets operational and
tactical requirements.
A2.6.6. General Actions Checklists. Checklists can serve as both a starting point to ensure
planning requirements are being met in a timely manner and as a quality control measure to
 
 
A2-6
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
ensure all planning factors have been accounted for. Do not use checklists as a replacement for
thorough understanding and planning in a scenario. Use the checklists below to form an MPC.
See Attachment 4, Functional Checklists for specific mission planning checklists and product
checklists. See Table A2.1, General Actions.
Table A2.1. General Actions
A2.7. Product Specifications.
A2.7.1. Mission Folder. The mission folder consolidates information and products, digital or
physical for deploying CR forces.
A2.7.2. Products for Individuals. Individual deployers should be provided with their team’s
initial work plan, area brochures to include nearest emergency services, security procedures,
their force protection roles, tailored communication plans, and escape and evasion plans.
These products should be developed with OPSEC as a primary consideration. Products should
not provide the full plan, but information that will supplement a thorough mission briefing to
include applicable lessons learned.
A2.7.3. Deployment Process Products. The MPC will deliver deployment processing
products as required by their unit and host base deployment functions.
A2.7.4. Mission Brief. The mission briefing will be delivered to deploying forces by the
MPCC, DMPCC, and intelligence. This briefing will cover the deployment schedule of events,
facts and assumptions on the ground, primary course of action, contingency plans, contracts,
communication plan, SPINS, ROE, enemy capabilities and intent, most likely COA and most
dangerous COA, as well as any other information that deploying forces will need to know
before they depart home station.

A2.7.5. AAR Documentation. The MPC will accomplish their own internal AAR. The MPC
should maintain an events log to assist in development of both AARs and hot washes. The
administrative member of the MPC will normally maintain these items and the MPCC and
DMPCC will be ready to speak to them during hot washes and AARs. The MPCC is
responsible for conducting or delegating debrief with deployed forces. Reach back as needed
to Air Force Lessons Learned and MAJCOM lessons learned offices for AAR development
assistance.
A2.8. Redeployment Planning. This planning is generally accomplished by the deployed forces.
An MPC can be stood up at home station either to assist the deployed forces or to serve as the
primary redeployment MPC. In either case, strong communication is necessary to ensure the home
station has a clear picture of the facts on the ground and that MPC products meet a high standard.
A2.8.1. Battle Rhythm. Redeployment mission planning will not operate on the same battle
rhythm as deployment mission planning. MPC members will likely also have primary duties in
the deployed location and not be able to work the MPC full time. Instead, the MPCC should
develop a schedule that balances primary mission accomplishment and ensures a plan is in
place prior to beginning the redeployment process.
A2.8.1.1. Initial Actions. Upon arrival at the deployed location the mission commander
(MC) will stand-up their redeployment MPC. The MC should identify an MPCC and fill
out the standard structure with available members. The MPCC will then reach back to
home station for any additional support required from the deployment MPCC. The MPCC
will follow MPC guidance from AFTTP 3-3 especially regarding planning in a deployed
environment.
A2.8.1.2. Progress Checks. Because redeployment planning will occur simultaneously
with operations the MPCC may set planning suspenses over several days. The progress
check then becomes much more important as an opportunity to bring all MPC members
into a single location to discuss planning progress.

offense, halt the questioning and contact the local staff judge advocate (SJA). The AFOSI or the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) may be called in regarding the criminal investigation.
However, if you are advised to speak with the individual, read the following rights for military
personnel, to advise them of their rights under Article 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice, or
civilian personnel, to advise them of their Fifth Amendment rights. See Table A3.3, Advisement
of Rights for military and civilian advisements.

Table A3.3. Advisement of Rights
A3.5. FPCON. Commanders at all levels use terrorism threat assessments plus their own threat
analyses as a basis for developing plans and programs to protect assets within their AOR. These
are called force protection conditions. FPCONs describe progressive levels of terrorist threats and
initiate preplanned defensive or mitigation actions. FPCON declarations are normally provided
through the chain-of-command, public address system, and other available resources. See Table
A3.4., FPCON.
For Military Personnel
I am __________(grade, name) a member of (squadron, base, deployed with _________, team 
member of _________). I am investigating the alleged offenses of _________, which you are 
suspected. I advise you that under the provisions of Article 31 of the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice, you have the right to remain silent, that is, to say nothing at all. Any statement you make, 
oral or written, may be used as evidence against you in a trial by court martial, or in other 
judicial or administrative proceedings. You have the right to consult with a lawyer, if you desire, 
and to have a lawyer present during this interview. You have the right to military legal counsel 
free of charge. In addition to military counsel, you are entitled to civilian counsel of your own 
choosing, at your own expense. You may request a lawyer at any time during this interview. If 
you decide to answer questions without a lawyer present, you may stop the questioning at any 
time.
Do you understand your rights? Do you want a lawyer?
(If the answer is yes, cease all questions at this point.) Do you wish to remain silent or are you 
willing to answer questions?
For Civilian Personnel
I am _________ (grade, name) a member of (squadron, base, deployed with_________, team 
member of_________. I am investigating the alleged offenses of _________, which you are 
suspected. I advise you that under the 5th Amendment to the Constitution, you have the right to 
remain silent, that is, to say nothing at all. Any statement you make, oral or written, may be used 
as evidence against you in a trial or in other judicial or administrative proceedings. You have the 
right to consult with a lawyer, if you desire, and to have a lawyer present during this interview. 
You may obtain a civilian lawyer of your own choosing at your own expense. If you cannot 
afford a lawyer, and want one, one will be appointed for you by civilian authorities before any 
questioning. You may request a lawyer at any time during this interview and, if you decide to 
answer questions without a lawyer present, you may stop the questioning at any time.
Do you understand your rights? Do you want a lawyer?
(If the answer is yes, cease all questions at this point). Are you willing to answer my questions?

Table A3.4. Force Protection Condition (FPCON)
A3.6. Health Protection. The health protection condition (HPCON) framework stratifies
health-protection measures into categories beginning with simple standard precautions and
gradually increasing the level of effort and expense. Standardizing responses within categories
ensures a measured local response, understood by all, up, down, and across command
chains—just like force protection condition levels. See Table A3.5, HPCONs.
CONDITION
DESCRIPTION
FPCON
NORMAL
This condition applies when a general global threat of possible terrorist 
activity exists and warrants a routine security posture. At a minimum, 
access control will be conducted at all Department of Defense (DOD) 
installations and facilities.
FPCON
ALPHA
(Air Force Modified)
This condition applies when there is an increased general threat of 
possible terrorist activity against personnel or facilities, the nature and 
extent of which are unpredictable, and circumstances do not justify full 
implementation of FPCON BRAVO measures.
However, it may be necessary to implement certain measures from 
higher FPCONs resulting from intelligence received or as a deterrent. 
The measures in this FPCON must be capable of being maintained 
indefinitely.
FPCON
BRAVO
This condition applies when an increased or more predictable threat of 
terrorist activity exists. Sustaining BRAVO measures for a prolonged 
period may affect operational capability and military-civil relationships 
with local authorities.
FPCON 
CHARLIE
This condition applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is 
received indicating that some form of terrorist action or targeting 
against personnel or facilities is likely. Prolonged implementation of 
CHARLIE measures may create hardship and affect the activities of the 
unit and its personnel.
FPCON 
DELTA
This condition applies in the immediate area where a terrorist attack has 
occurred or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action 
against a specific location or person is imminent. FPCON DELTA is 
usually declared as a localized condition. FPCON DELTA measures are 
not intended to be sustained for an extended duration.

A3.11. ERO Distances. An engine running on/offload (ERO) expedites the flow of aircraft
through airfields during all airland operations where the reduction of ground time warrants a
departure from normal operating procedures. EROs will only be used for validated operational
requirements after prior coordination through appropriate channels (e.g., air mobility control
center [AMCC], 618 AOC, AMD). See Table A3.11, ERO Distances.
Table A3.11. ERO Distances
NOTE: Do not use ERO procedures when explosive cargo is involved (with the exception of
small arms ammunition—class/division 1.4) unless authorized by the joint airborne and air
transportability training (JA/ATT) exercise operations order or contingency air tasking orders.
Refer to Defense Transportation Regulation, Part III, Appendix Y for detailed ERO procedures.

Table A3.12. Joint Staff Organization
Directorates
Description
J-1
Manpower and 
Personnel
This J-1 division manages personnel and administration, develops 
personnel policies, administers military and civilian personnel within 
the command, and administers prisoners of war.
J-2
Intelligence
The J-2 division ensures the availability of reliable intelligence and 
timely indications and warnings on the characteristics of the area of 
operations and the location, activities, and capabilities of the enemy. 
J-2 emphasis is on the enemy. Activities may include human 
intelligence (HUMINT) and counterintelligence, target identification 
and selection, and electronic intelligence gathering and analysis.
J-3
Operations
The J-3 division assists the joint force commander (JFC) in the 
direction and control of operations. Its work begins with the initial 
planning and extends through the integration and coordination of joint 
operations.
J-4
Logistics
The J-4 division develops logistics plans and coordinates and 
supervises supply, maintenance, repair, evacuation, transportation, 
construction, and related logistics activities. Responsibilities may 
include weapons surety, civil engineering support, transportation 
management, and so forth. Because logistics support is primarily a 
Service responsibility, the thrust of joint logistics operations may be 
to coordinate Service programs and integrate them with the joint 
commander’s concept of support. Knowledge of service policies and 
doctrine is essential.
J-5
Plans and Policy
The J-5 division does the long-range planning. It prepares campaign, 
concept, and operation plans, and the associated commander’s 
estimate of the situation. The J-5 is often responsible for special 
weapons planning. In commands without a separate J-5 division, the 
operations division performs the function.
J-6
Command, Control, 
Communications, and 
Computer Systems
The J-6 division may be found with a variety of names and 
designators. The functions of the division include handling command 
responsibilities for communications and frequency control, tactical 
communications planning and execution, and management and 
development of electronics and automatic information systems.

Attachment 5
ATT5 ASSESSMENT TEAM (AAT) GUIDE AND CONSIDERATIONS
AAT GUIDE AND CONSIDERATIONS
A5.1. Assessments. When tasked by USTRANSCOM or the supported CCDR, airfield
assessments are typically conducted prior to airfield opening and/or the arrival of a larger
contingent of forces. Assessment team personnel must recognize and identify the applicable
airfield or landing zone criteria that is required to support the mission. Furthermore, teams must
consider additional factors such as, but not limited to, security, cargo handling areas, pavement
structural capabilities, emergency response support, and MOG limitations. It is important to note
that a single standard for airfield assessment procedures does not exist, due to the dynamic nature
of the assessment mission.
A5.2. References. The operational environment and anticipated mission will determine the
airfield criteria to apply (e.g., Air Force Class B, International Civil Aviation Organization
[ICAO], North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]). Normally, the AAT will assess airfields as
LZs, as these requirements are less restrictive and allow for expedient operations in austere
environments. Guidance for LZ assessments and operations can be found in DAFMAN 13-217,
Drop Zone, Landing Zone, and Helicopter Landing Zone Operations, Chapter 4.
A5.3. Team Member Responsibilities. Upon arrival to a location, team members will begin
performing their assigned function when cleared by the team lead. It is the responsibility of each
member to up-channel any concerns, hazards, or LIMFACs as soon as possible. Team members
will provide updates to the TOC as required. If a condition is identified that would result in a
no-go assessment, the team lead will be notified immediately.
A5.3.1. Contingency Response Commander (O-6). If required, the CR commander will be
on the ground and serve as the final mission authority for assessing and opening the airbase.
They will continue to negotiate with HN representatives, HHQ, and other joint or coalition
partners. If designated, will serve as senior airfield authority.
A5.3.2. Team Lead, CRE Commander. The team lead will collaborate with airfield
operations to select a suitable TOC and staging location. They will oversee all AAT operations
and provide tactical direction. Upon completion of assessment, will prepare and submit all
reports, RFFs, RFIs, to the appropriate agencies.
A5.3.3. Airfield Operations (13M with 368 or 1C7 with 368). The airfield operations
officer or airfield manager will assess the airfield according to the applicable criteria and
identify any hazards or restrictions that may limit aircraft operations. They will establish
parking plans, MOG, and verify available ARFF capabilities.
A5.3.4. CE Officer and Craftsman (32E with CAPE and 3E5 with CAPE). CE 
will
identify dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) test locations and pavement condition index (PCI)
sections to complete a contingency airfield pavement evaluation or LZ evaluation. They will
process the associated data to identify the airfield PCN and any weight bearing restrictions.
A5.3.5. Expeditionary Communications. The communications technician will establish and
maintain full scope communication capabilities, to include secure/unsecure beyond
line-of-sight voice and data and secure/unsecure line of sight.
A5.3.6. Security Forces (SF) Specialist (3P). SF personnel will lead convoy operations,
develop route maps, and assess security throughout the airfield perimeter. They will begin
 
 
A5-2
AFTTP 3-4.7 3 June 2025
 
establishing an air base defense plan and will coordinate with airfield operations to establish
suitable defensive fighting position (DFP) locations.
A5.3.7. Other Potential Augmentee Positions. Due to the shifting nature of airfield
assessments and tasking requirements, it may be necessary to augment personnel not
previously listed. These positions may include, but are not limited to, aerial port, contracting,
medical, intelligence, AFOSI, ATC, or maintenance personnel. Upon completing their
functional responsibilities, augmentees will follow the guidance of the team lead.
A5.4. Assessment Guidance. On arrival, the AAT will initiate an on station call and will follow
the airfield assessment team checklist located in Table A4.29, Assessment Team (AT) Checklist
Following concurrence from the team lead and HN (if applicable), members will be released to
perform their airfield assessment functions. It is strongly advised that members check in via
hourly radio calls to report status of the airfield and personnel. Due to time-consuming nature of
the contingency pavement evaluation process, it is recommended that team members assist CE
upon completion of their respective functions. Members will rally at the designated point to brief
the team lead on airfield status and fill out the visual indicator stoplight chart in preparation for the
submission of the go/no-go decision to higher authorities. See Figure A5.2, Visual
Indicator—Stoplight Chart.
A5.5. Post Assessment. Following the go/no-go decision, AAT members must prepare the
airfield and their equipment to receive the arriving personnel. Additionally, members should
prepare an initial briefing for follow-on force functional leaders according to the guidance listed in
Table A4.36, Transition Checklist for Seizure Force to CR Force. A complete JAT report must be
submitted within 24 hours of arrival at the airfield/APOD. The JAT report format can be found in
USTRANSCOMI 10-27, Volume 2. See Figure A5.1, JAT Report Page 1.
