SUBJECT:  Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 10-201, Force Readiness Reporting   
 
By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance Memorandum 
(AFGM) immediately implements changes to AFI 10-201, Force Readiness Reporting.  This 
AFGM provides clarifying guidance regarding updates to the Defense Readiness Reporting 
System and implementation of the new readiness information to support the Air Force Force 
Generation (AFFORGEN) presentation model.  Compliance with this memorandum is 
mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Department of the Air Force 
publications, the information herein prevails IAW DAFI 90-160, Publications and form 
Management.  
 
This guidance is applicable to Air Force units that conduct readiness assessments within 
the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS). First, the AFGM makes an official change 
that DOC Statement be referred to as Unit Summary Statement and removes the “full time” 
requirement from the Wing Readiness Office as this statement drove manpower mandates that 
would not be supported with necessary manning or funding actions. Second, the AFGM changes 
FEAT assessments from quarterly to bimonthly and provides additional details to the non-
measured unit definition. Third, the AFGM corrects a typo that changes a reference for 
installation reporting from Chapter 10 to the correct Chapter 11. Lastly, the AFGM clarifies 
FEAT rating definitions and adds Chapter 13 for ATF Reporting guidance. 
 
This memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this 
memorandum, or upon publication of an interim change (IC) or rewrite of the affected 
publication, whichever is earlier.

Guidance Changes 
 
The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this GM are identified with a Tier (“T-0, 
T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following each compliance statement.  See DAFMAN 90-161, 
Publishing Processes and Procedures, for a description of the authorities associated with the 
Tier designators.  Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate 
Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the GM’s OPR for non-tiered compliance items, 
as applicable. 
 
Current guidance in AFI 10-201, Force Readiness Reporting, remains in effect with the 
following changes. 
 
All references to Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement(s) are now referred to as 
Unit Summary Statement(s). 
 
All roles/references to Major Commands (MAJCOMs) are also referring to Institutional 
Commands and Service Component Commands. 
 
CHANGED 2.7.1. Establish a Wing Readiness Office (WRO) which includes, at a minimum, a 
primary and alternate wing readiness POC. The wing deputy chief of staff maintains routine 
oversight for wing readiness reporting on behalf of the WG/CC's. The office must be equipped 
with ready access to Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).     
 
CHANGED 2.7.3. Serve as installation capability assessment authority. Designate the mission 
support group commander, Civil Engineering squadron commander, or the organization that 
supports the installation and facilities as the lead for assessing the installation METL quarterly 
IAW Chapter 11.

Note: All assessments can be accomplished more frequently if needed.  
 
CHANGED 3.1.1.2. Non-Measured Unit Reporting. Non-Measured Units are identified as 
MAJOR “N” units. Non-measured units have traditionally been considered as Wings, groups, 
centers, complexes, training units, etc.  Exceptions to readiness reporting may apply for these 
types of units. These types of units may be required to complete capability and/or resource 
assessments by AF/A3TR or the parent MAJCOM if the unit provides a mission essential 
capability (or capabilities) in support of the DoD, Service, or MAJCOM.  AF/A3TR will 
determine based on MAJCOM recommendation, if non-measured measured units will be 
directed to report readiness. The major unit indicator will be changed from MAJOR “N” to 
MAJOR “Y” for all units that will be required to report readiness.  
 
CHANGED 3.1.1.3.  Installation reporting is accomplished IAW Chapter 11 of this instruction.  
 
CHANGED 3.4.4. HAF FAM specific training will be accomplished with AF/A3TR within 60 
days of appointment as a HAF FAM. (T-1) 
 
CHANGED Chapter 10. FORCE ELEMENT (FE) ASSESSMENTS  
 
CHANGED 10.1. FE Readiness Assessments. FE assessment authority will accomplish a FE 
readiness assessment bimonthly, no matter the phase, by reporting the ability of a FE to execute 
the capabilities defined in its mission capability (MISCAP) statement in major combat operations 
against a peer competitor, as required by the National Military Strategy (NMS). (T-0) This report 
will be completed bimonthly (February, April, June, August, October, December) between the 
11th and 20th of each of the reporting months. (T-1) The assessment will be informed by the 
readiness of the personnel and equipment aligned with each FE, as represented in the UTC 
assessments within DCAPES. UTC assessments are the main source for informing FE 
assessments; however, DRRS unit reports and readiness briefings can provide additional insights 
as outlined in paragraph 2.8.2. (T-2) 
 
CHANGED 10.1.1.2. “Qualified Yes” indicates that some UTCs are degraded, but the FE can 
still execute its MISCAP. To reach this category, the FE’s “Lead UTC” must be “Yes”. (T-2) 
 
CHANGED 10.1.1.3. “No” indicates that the FE cannot execute its MISCAP. (T-2).  
 
CHANGED 10.2. Force Element Availability Assessments. For FEs in the CERTIFY and 
AVAILABLE to COMMIT phases, the assessment authority will also accomplish an availability 
assessment by reporting the ability of the FE(s) to execute assigned tasking (Execution Order, 
OPLAN, etc.) based on FE capabilities defined within the MISCAP (T-1). The assessment will 
be informed by the readiness of the personnel and equipment aligned with each FE, as 
 
represented in the UTC assessments, however, DRRS unit reports and readiness briefings can 
provide additional insights as outlined in paragraph 2.8.2 and successful completion of the 
Certifying Event. (T-1) A FE availability assessment will be accomplished bimonthly during the 
CERTIFY and AVAILABLE to COMMIT phases. (T-1). If significant changes to the UTCs 
occur impacting the FE assessment rating the assessment authority has 24 hours to accomplish a 
new assessment. A new assessment is also required within 24 hours from tasking. (T-1) 
 
CHANGED 10.2.1. FE availability assessment scale. FE availability assessments will fall within 
two categories: 
 
CHANGED 10.2.1.1. “Yes” indicates that the FE can execute its MISCAP and has successfully 
completed a Certifying Event. (T-1) Additionally, the “Lead UTC” must be assessed “Yes” in 
order for the FE assessment to be “Yes.” (T-1) Only FEs that are assessed as “Yes” should be 
offered for tasking. 
 
CHANGED 10.2.1.2. “No” indicates that the FE cannot execute assigned tasking (Execution 
Order, OPLAN, etc.) based on FE capabilities defined within the MISCAP (T-1). FEs assessing 
as “No” in the AVAILABLE to COMMIT phase, will be expected to adhere to DAFI 10-401 
shortfall procedures if tasked. (T-1) 
 
ADDED Chapter 13  
 
ADDED READINESS REPORTING (ATF) FOR AIR TASK FORCE  
 
ADDED 13.1. ATF Reporting Workflow. The ATF will consist of several echelons; a 
Command Echelon that includes an A-Staff, a Combat Air Base Squadron (CABS) that will have 
a leadership element (CC, CD, SEL, & CCF) with the remainder of the CABS detailed as a 
Combat Service Support Team – Lead (CSST-L) and any additional Combat Service Support 
Teams (CSST(s)) as required. ATF Readiness Reporting will consist of Capability Assessments 
at all echelons and will reflect both assigned and detailed forces. The ATF will complete a 
Capability Assessments on a Mission Essential Task List (METL) informed by tasks from the 
Command Echelon, CABS, and CSST(s) assessments. While Capability Assessments are 
subjective, they are informed by the supporting information (DCAPES, AFFORGEN CERT, 
Evaluations, etc.). Due to the limited number of resources assigned, Resource Assessments will 
only be completed at the Command Echelon UIC of the ATF.  
 
ADDED 13.1.1 ATF Support Capabilities. The ATF will have multiple support capabilities in 
the form of Mission Generation Force Elements (MGFEs), Combat Enhancement Teams (CETs), 
Combat Generation Teams (CGTs), etc.  While these capabilities are not organic to the ATF, 
having visibility of their overall readiness allows ATF commanders to understand readiness gaps 
in not only ATF organic capability but also for any support capabilities.  Once support 
capabilities are identified, these capabilities will be “command linked” as information-only data 
for the ATF commanders.  This provides the ATF with a holistic readiness look at all organic 
and support capabilities.

Chapter 1 
READINESS REPORTING GENERAL OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND 
1.1.  Defense Readiness Reporting System  (DRRS). IAW DoDD 7730.65 DoD Readiness 
Reporting System, requirements, the Secretary of Defense (SecDEF) established DRRS as the sole 
readiness reporting system for the Department of Defense (DoD) and is utilized by the Office of 
the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), combatant 
commands (CCMDs), services, and combat support agencies. (T-0) It is the single authoritative 
reporting system within the DoD functioning as the central registry of all operational units in the 
United States armed forces and designated foreign organizations. It provides objective data critical 
to crisis, contingency, and peacetime planning processes, while establishing a subjective 
capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness reporting system, for measuring the readiness 
of military units to meet missions assigned by SecDEF. Readiness assessments will not be used as 
a report card for unit performance. (T-1) These assessments support DoD Semi-annual readiness 
review to congress. 
1.2.  Readiness Reporting.  Air Force readiness reporting in DRRS is comprised of five distinct, 
but closely aligned commander assessments: resource, capability, force element (FE), installation, 
and command mission assessments. DRRS is a DoD system and data contained within can and 
will be viewed at all echelons to include the Joint Staff (JS) and Congress, so it is imperative that 
commanders input clean, concise and accurate information that can be understood by a broad 
audience. (T-1) These assessments are interrelated and feed information from unit resourcing 
through Installation and FE readiness issues. Outside of DRRS, unit type code (UTC) assessments 
are conducted within Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution System (DCAPES). 
1.2.1.  Many authoritative data sources (ADS) provide data feeds into DRRS. For example, 
DCAPES provides UTC assessments, which feed both capability assessments and FE 
assessments. This data must be updated and accurate before starting DRRS assessments. Users 
can find the full list of ADSs supported in DRRS via the “documents” tab by reviewing the 
data load sheet. 
1.2.2.  Resource Assessment. This report objectively measures the effectiveness of the Air 
Force in meeting Title 10 or 32 (as applicable), United States code (USC) responsibilities to 
organize, train, and equip forces for CCMDs. It is also a measured unit commander’s objective 
assessment of the unit’s ability to provide trained personnel and operational equipment to 
execute the full spectrum mission(s) for which the unit was designed. Commanders assess 
measurements against their authorized, possessed/assigned, and available resources to 
determine if the unit is resourced adequately to provide the full level-of-combat capability for 
which the unit is organized. This report is based on unit’s required authorizations and is the 
primary readiness report used to inform the Program Objective Memorandum. Resource 
readiness reports are comprised of four measured areas: (1) personnel, (2) training (3) 
equipment and supplies on hand, and (4) equipment condition. Additionally, this report 
consists of two sub-reports. The chemical, biological, defense readiness training report  
 
 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
7 
(CBDRT) provides an assessment of a unit’s ability to accomplish their mission in chemical, 
biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) environments. The tasked resource assessment 
percentage effective (PCTEF) measures the resource level of assets committed/deployed to 
tasked missions. To support accurate modeling, planning and decision making, unit resource 
assessments must always represent actual resourcing readiness, regardless of Air Force Force 
Generation (AFFORGEN) phasing. Details on resource assessments can be found in Chapter 
4. 
1.2.3.  Capability Assessment. This report is a commander’s subjective assessment based on 
objective data of the unit’s ability to accomplish its mission essential tasks (METs) as required 
by its core mission, as well as any assigned named operation or Top Priority Plan. Commanders 
must ensure the unit can accomplish the capability to the appropriate conditions and standards 
set in the assigned METs. (T-1) For example, can the unit accomplish each task at the required 
frequency, duration, output, etc.?  Headquarters Air Force (HAF) functional area managers 
(FAMs) determine the required level of capacity for each task. Commanders determine 
whether the unit can provide the capability to the required level of capacity. Units must always 
report the core mission area in DRRS. The Top Priority Plans and Named Operations mission 
areas are reported when the unit is assigned those missions. Units at all echelons of command 
can be identified to report capability readiness. To support accurate modeling, planning and 
decision making, unit capability assessments must always represent actual capability readiness, 
regardless of AFFORGEN phasing. Details on capability assessments can be found in Chapter 
9. 
1.2.4.  Force Element (FE) Assessments. FEs are an integrated set of UTCs the Air Force uses 
to offer operational capability to joint force commanders. It is a composition of multiple UTCs 
that represents an operational capability. FEs fulfill service assigned roles and missions. FE 
assessments are conducted in two parts focusing on readiness and availability. FE composition, 
ownership, phase alignment, and mission capability statements (MISCAP) are maintained in 
DCAPES. This data is fed into DRRS to ensure aligned force generation and readiness 
reporting. FE assessments primarily consist of two areas:  FE readiness and availability 
assessments. Combined, these measure the service’s ability to conduct major combat 
operations as required by the National Defense and National Military Strategies and should be 
used for contingency planning and risk management. FE availability assessments measure the 
service’s ability to fulfill the Global Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP) and should 
be used for force allocation and apportionment. Details on FE assessments can be found in 
Chapter 10 and FE quick start guide in DRRS. 
1.2.5.  Installation Capability Assessment. Installation capability assessments are directed by 
the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 7730.66, Guidance for the Defense Readiness 
Reporting System (DRRS). The installation capability assessment contains mandatory reporting 
areas to meet the National Defense Authorization Act requirements. These areas are assessed 
by the host unit or when applicable in cooperation with a joint base host. Details on installation 
capability assessments can be found in Chapter 11.

AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
1.2.6.  Command Mission Assessment. Command mission assessments assess the MAJCOMs 
ability to accomplish METs in a variety of missions (i.e., core, operational plans (OPLANs), 
or Named Operations). These assessments inform HAF and CCMD strategic readiness and 
may link directly to CCMD joint mission essential task listings (METLs). Command level 
tasks describe capabilites provided by the MAJCOM overall as well as specific tasks 
supporting Named Operations or Top Priority Plans. Details on command mission assessments 
can be found in Chapter 12. 
1.3.  Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement.  The DOC statement’s purpose is to 
provide a summary reference document that consolidates information from several 
ADS/documents in a single easy-to-access location. The DOC statement is a non-authoritative 
DRRS system-generated product that consolidates core mission essential task list (METL), UTC 
availability (UTA), and other amplifying data or remarks relevant to the unit. 
1.3.1.  Unit Response Time. Unit response time is defined as Air Force units ready (manned, 
equipped, and trained) for deployment, redeployment, and/or employment within a specified 
time. Air Force units report on whether they can be made ready and available within their 
response time. The unit response timetable resides in the DRRS Air Force tables and is 
developed by the HAF FAM in coordination with the MAJCOM FAM and Air Force Training 
and Readiness Division (AF/A3TR). Most unit response times are standardized for like-type 
units within a MAJCOM. This response time must not be confused with UTC-type response 
times specified in OPLANs/Contingency Plans, which often refer to a partial unit deployment. 
The DOC statement management tool in DRRS automatically populates the standardized 
response times from the Unit Response Time Air Force Table. Response times for units may 
be changed at the request of the MAJCOM FAM to the HAF FAM when OPLANs or 
functional guidance require specific measured units meet a unique response time. The HAF 
FAM coordinates any changes with AF/A3TR for the updates to be included in the Air Force 
tables. If a specific unit requires a variance, MAJCOM FAM coordinates approval with HAF 
FAM prior to updating directly on unit DOC statement. When this variance is implemented, 
update the DOC statement's amplifying notes to include any references requiring the variance. 
1.3.2.  Amplifying Notes. Amplifying notes are intended for MAJCOM/Air Force Installation 
and Mission Support Center (AFIMSC) FAMs to inform units on specific reporting 
instructions that are outside of this AFI and/or a MAJCOM Supplement or are a part of the 
AFI or MAJCOM Supplement but are specific to the function(s) within the Deployment 
Indicator Code-9 (DEPID-9). MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAMs may also use amplifying notes to 
convey HAF FAM direction or explanatory guidance on unit reporting for the DEPID-9. These 
“notes” are free form text and provide units policy/guidance info from their FAM. 
1.4.  Total Force Associations (TFA).  Total Force Associations (TFAs) are critical to Air Force 
operations. TFAs are organizational constructs that functionally integrate collocated work centers 
within organizations from RegAF and Air Reserve Component (ARC). TFAs can be created by 
mutual agreement when one component, the sponsor, shares a mission with one or more associates 
from the other components. The sponsor organization is the organization with primary 
responsibility for mission accomplishment and is normally assigned the preponderance of the 
primary physical resources (i.e., aircraft, weapon systems equipment, weapon system support, and 
production facilities). There are two types of TFAs: classic associations when a RegAF 
organization is the sponsor, and active associations when an ARC organization is the sponsor. For 
additional guidance on TFAs please refer to AFI 90-1001, Total Force Associations (TFAs). 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
9 
1.4.1.  The sponsor and associate unit(s) each have their own, separate DOC statement. 
However, certain elements are the same on the sponsor and associate DOC statements. Both 
the sponsor and associate MAJCOMs (FAM and DOC statement OPR) coordinate on TFA 
DOC statements to ensure consistency and efficiency between the sponsor and associate 
unit(s). DOC statement entries common to the sponsor and associate(s) are unit, UTC and Core 
METL. (T-2) 
1.4.2.  The DOC statements, in the amplifying notes, identify the relationship between the 
sponsor and associate unit using the following format: “Sponsor: wing/squadron/unit 
identification code (UIC) Associate: wing/squadron/UIC”. (T-2) For example, "Sponsor: 2 
BW/96 BS (FFC930). Associate: 307 BW/343 BS (FF1FX1)." 
1.4.3.  Each unit in the association (sponsor and associate) will independently assess their 
resource and capability readiness. (T-1) The sponsor and associate will each assess a core 
METL. (T-1) Sponsor organizations will use the command linking task option to link their 
METL to the readiness assessments of their respective associate organization(s). (T-1) 
1.4.4.  The wing and/or group with administrative control (ADCON) of the associate unit will 
monitor readiness reporting and ensure the associate unit is resourced appropriately to fulfill 
the TFA construct. (T-2) The overall status of TFA organizations can be depicted by reviewing 
the resource assessments from all associated organizations. TFA units will utilize “Command 
Linking” of tasks where applicable. (T-2) 
1.5.  Supplements.  In the event of conflict between this AFI and MAJCOM supplements and/or 
HAF FAM guidance, the guidance in this AFI will take precedence. (T-1) Concerned parties will 
contact AF/A3TR for resolution. (T-1) OSD and CJCS guidance takes precedence over this AFI. 
MAJCOM supplements and interim guidance must be coordinated with AF/A3TR to prevent 
conflicts with JS or Air Force readiness policy/guidance. (T-1)

REPORTING PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES 
3.1.  Air Force Readiness Reporting Requirements.  Air Force Readiness Reporting 
encompasses a variety of reports to meet public law, joint, and departmental needs. Reporting 
occurs at several echelons of command as needed. In general, AF readiness reporting is conducted 
at the unit level. Table 3.1 identifies, by report type, echelon of unit, frequency required, and 
specific date windows required for regular submissions. Note: As prescribed in joint policy, any 
significant change in measured unit status will drive an out-of-cycle assessment to ensure currency.

determination. In this table, “Unit Type” refers to a generic category of unit to help determine 
the type of reporting required and should not be confused with any other unit type codification 
in other programs of the AF. For the purpose of reporting, units are described as measured 
units, non-measured reporting units, installations, major commands, or other types. 
3.1.1.1.  Measured Units. Units that fulfill the AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization, 
description of a unit and have a unit descriptor code (UDC) of combat, combat support, or 
combat service support are considered a “Measured Unit”. (T-1) MAJCOM identified 
detachments/operating locations which have a UDC of combat, combat support, or combat 
service support are considered measured units. (T-1) Measured units will have a DOC 
statement in DRRS and are identified in DRRS with a major unit indicator (MAJOR) of 
“Y”. (T-1) Units should notify their WRO to coordinate with the MAJCOM CRO if 
changes are needed to their MAJOR unit indicator. Maintenance groups and the highest 
tier of a medical organization (medical wing, group, or squadron) are identified as a 
measured unit and required to assess resources and capabilities. (T-2) Medical units above 
the squadron level will include all subordinate units in the assessment. (T-1) 
3.1.1.2.  Non-Measured Unit Reporting. Wings, groups, centers, complexes, etc., are 
generally considered non-measured units and are identified as MAJOR “N” units. This type 
of unit may be required to complete capability assessments by AF/A3TR or the parent 
MAJCOM if the unit provides a mission essential capability (or capabilities) in support of 
the DoD, service, or MAJCOM. 
3.1.1.3.  Installation Reporting. Air Force installations identified on the AF/A3TR 
installation listing, located in the DRRS documents tab, are required to report installation 
METs. (T-1) This listing is updated annually. Installation reporting is accomplished IAW 
Chapter 11 of this instruction. (T-1) 
3.1.1.4.  MAJCOM Reporting. All MAJCOMs are required to report on mission essential 
capabilities using the command mission assessment IAW Chapter 12. (T-1) When 
MAJCOMs are direct components to a CCMD, MAJCOM reporting supports CCMD joint 
mission essential task listing (JMETL) and complies with CCMD reporting policies. Non 
component MAJCOMs should report capability readiness to inform Air Staff of the 
MAJCOM organize, train and equip (OT&E) capabilities. 
3.1.1.5.  Force Element (FE) and other reporting. Wing commanders are directed to report 
FE readiness IAW Chapter 10 when designated as the owner of a reportable FE. (T-1) 
Additionally, specific mission needs may require traditionally non-reporting organizations 
to complete readiness reports when directed. 
3.1.2.  Frequency of Reporting. AF readiness reports covered in this AFI meet frequency 
requirements determined to align with other service, joint, departmental, or public law 
directions.  Unit compliance with reporting frequency ensures higher level compliance and 
data accuracy.  These frequencies represent the minimum compliance windows however 
organizations must complete out-of-cycle reports within 24 hours when changes in status 
occur. (T-1) The CJCS, in coordination with the service chiefs and the affected CCDRs, the 
CSAF and the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations (AF/A3), may require units to 
report more frequently. All units are required to maintain the reporting frequency even if 
completely or partially deployed/employed in response to a crisis or execution of an Operation 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
21 
Order, while on TDY, undergoing service directed resource actions, and during exercises or 
inspections. (T-1) Users should keep the time span for producing and approving reports to as 
few days as possible. Once a draft report has been created, any changes from the ADSs that 
feed the report are not reflected in that draft report. To capture these data changes, the draft 
report needs to be deleted, and a new draft created. 
3.1.2.1.  Monthly Reports. Resource and capability readiness reports for measured units or 
non-measured but otherwise directed units must be completed during the 1st and 15th of 
each month. (T-1) Regular monthly reports should not be initiated prior to the 1st of the 
month to ensure the best system data is populated into the report. (T-1) 
3.1.2.2.  Quarterly Reports. MAJCOM command mission assessments, (unless otherwise 
directed by CCMD), are required quarterly between the 15th and 25th of March, June, 
September, and December. (T-1) Installation assessments are required quarterly between 
the 1st and 15th of March, June, September and December. (T-1) FE readiness assessments 
are required quarterly between the 11th and 20th of March, June, September, and 
December. (T-1) If a FE is tasked without yet having completed an availability assessment 
for the current cycle, assessment authorities will have 24 hours to complete an availability 
assessment. (T-1) 
3.1.3.  Reporting Authorities. Readiness reporting authorities are responsible for the 
information contained in the report. Commanders need to be aware that reports in DRRS have 
immediate visibility to all levels of government upon approval. Significant care should be 
taken to ensure clear professional language is used whenever conducting a report of any kind. 
3.1.3.1.  Measured and Non-Measured Unit unit Authority. Unit commanders are the 
approval authority for resource and capability assessments and should have the UC role in 
DRRS for their assigned unit as directed in paragraph 2.9.1. (T-1) UCs will either be an 
Officer, Non-commissioned officer, or DoD civilian within the organization. (T-1) Ensure 
only senior-level individuals assigned to the unit are designated as additional UCs. (T-2) 
If no UCs are available, a higher echelon commander can be provided UC role by unit UA 
to submit unit assessments to meet reporting timelines. (T-1)  
3.1.3.2.  Installation Assessment Authority. Installation assessments are required by public 
law and joint policy. Designated authorities as described in Chapter 11 ensure the currency 
and accuracy of all defined areas. (T-1) Reportable areas reflect the installation capability 
and are not limited to organizational mission needs. 
3.1.3.3.  Force Element (FE) Assessment Authority. FE assessment authority (wing 
commander or designee (no lower than 0-6 group commander or equivalent)) will 
accomplish a FE assessment(s) (readiness/availability assessment(s) if applicable) 
quarterly, between the 11th and 20th of the reporting month, no matter the phase, by 
reporting the ability of a FE to execute the capabilities defined in its mission capability 
(MISCAP) statement. (T-1) See Chapter 10 and Table 3.1 for further guidance.

AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
3.2.  System Process Support.  Account Support and Management. DRRS users are required to 
create an account using the system prompts and system help and support. Once created, the UA 
can assign new roles within a unit to include changing commanders, adding additional users etc. 
When issues arise the WRO serves as the first point of assistance to determine the cause. Should 
the WRO be unable to resolve the concern, they can raise the issue to their CRO or if appropriate 
the DRRS Help Desk. 
3.2.1.  Unit Office Management. Each reporting organization, by UIC, is required to establish 
and maintain within DRRS an established “office management”. (T-1) This module in DRRS 
establishes one or more offices in the organization with DRRS users that can draft/approve 
reports. Each office must have OPRs with active accounts. (T-1) While the system only 
requires a single office, larger units may find it easier for reporting to have an office established 
in the system for various reporting areas. UAs should conduct annual reviews, at a minimum, 
of office management and ensure only authorized users have access to the unit reporting. 
3.2.2.  UJTL and AFUTL Management. AF/A3TR is the AF service office of primary contact 
for UJTL tasks. AF/A3TR also serves as the OPR for the AFUTL. Changes to any MET task 
will be coordinated with AF/A3TR and the HAF FAM. (T-1) 
3.2.3.  METL Template Management. DRRS contains an administrative module for MET and 
METL management. HAF FAMs build templates of prebuilt tasks along with performance 
measures associated for MAJCOM FAMs to apply to functional units. These templates contain 
the METs common to a specific type of unit. When developing task lists, the UJTL will be the 
first reference to look for a task. (T-2) If the task does not exist in the UJTL the HAF FAM 
reviews the AFUTL for a suitable task. If the task does not exist in either task listing, the HAF 
FAM coordinates with AF/A3TR to create a new AFUTL task. Any concerns with METs 
within a METL template are coordinated via the MAJCOM FAM to the HAF FAM. 
3.2.4.  AF Tables Management. Unit resource readiness reporting is dependent on data tables 
to identify critical personnel Air Force specialty codes (AFSC), reportable training, equipment, 
CBDRT (training and equipment), response times and equipment condition levels. These tables 
reside within DRRS, but informational copies can be found in the DRRS documents tab. 
Change requests to the tables are coordinated with the MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM, the impacted 
HAF FAM, and AF/A3TR. 
3.2.5.  Mission Prioritization Matrix Management. The mission prioritization matrix provides 
units with a 1 to “n” listing of the METL template tasks associated with each unit. This gives 
commanders guidance on which tasks within the unit METL have the greatest priority in the 
event of constrained resources. Change requests to the MPM are coordinated with the 
MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM, the impacted HAF FAM, and AF/A3TR. 
3.3.  Reporting Process Sequence.  To best accomplish the readiness reporting process there is 
an optimal order in which to complete the assessments. In some cases, DRRS requires some 
assessments completed before moving forward. The following order offers the greatest synergistic 
effect on the reporting process. 
3.3.1.  Unit resource assessment. Resource assessments require the unit to objectively review 
overall manning, training, and equipment information. The review of this information prepares 
the assessor for the follow-on assessments by providing an understanding of personnel and 
equipment available and training completed, etc. 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
23 
3.3.2.  Unit capability assessments. METs draw data from resource and UTC assessments to 
populate MET performance measures. To complete the capability assessment, assessors need 
to review elements of both resource and UTC assessments. For example, a task may have a 
performance measure that evaluates the “Personnel-Rating” (P-Rating) from the resource 
assessment and states that “P-Rating” must be ≤ 2. Performance measures may ask the 
readiness status of a specific UTC to inform the MET. 
3.3.3.  FE readiness and availability assessments. These assessments are informed by the 
information in the UTC assessments as well as additional insights from all other unit 
assessments. 
3.3.4.  Higher echelon assessments. Installation assessments, command mission assessments, 
or other higher echelon assessments (NAF, MAJCOM, CCMD, etc.) need inputs from all 
applicable measured units to inform their assessments. 
3.4.  Training.  The DRRS 101 training is mandatory for all DRRS users reporting readiness at 
squadron, group, wing, NAF, MAJCOM, and HAF and will be administered by AF/A3TR. (T-1) 
This training focuses on, but is not limited to, AFFORGEN updates, capacity viewer training, the 
application of the system (mechanics), DRRS functionality and tools, roles, responsibilities, and 
policy as it pertains to resource, capability, installation, FE, and mission command assessments. 
The Air Force and status of resources and training system (ESORTS) modules in the DRRS 
learning management module are mandatory and should be accomplished prior to attending DRRS 
101 training. (T-1) This training can be found in DRRS in the user’s profile menu: “Help & 
Support” “Learning Management”. These modules will be completed within 60 days of 
appointment. (T-1) 
3.4.1.  DRRS program manager training is an annual mandatory requirement for CROs and 
will be administered by AF/A3TR. (T-1) This training focuses on, but is not limited to, 
AFFORGEN updates, FE assessment tool (FEAT) training, and DRRS software 
familiarization/updates. 
3.4.2.  MAJCOM specific training is required, as applicable, for DRRS users to attend through 
their respective FAMs or CRO to provide training for subordinate units to address any 
MAJCOM-specific requirements and considerations. (T-1) This includes, but is not limited to, 
adding context and relevance of readiness assessments, METLs, DOC statements, and Air 
Force tables within DRRS to aid MAJCOM decision making. 
3.4.3.  Additional training can be provided by AF/A3TR, upon request, to CROs and HAF 
FAMs, focused on DRRS management functionality, analytical tools, query tools, 
methodology, and ADS business rules. 
3.4.4.  HAF FAM specific training will be accomplished with AF/A3TR within 30 days of 
appointment as a HAF FAM. (T-1)  
3.4.5.  Commander’s Courses. The Wing Commander’s Course and Squadron Commander’s 
Course will include a force readiness reporting module. (T-2) AF/A3TR is responsible for 
instructing the force readiness reporting module at the Wing Commander’s Course. Respective 
MAJCOMs are responsible for instructing the force readiness reporting module at the 
Squadron Commander’s Course.

Chapter 4 
RESOURCE READINESS 
4.1.  Relationship Between Resource Readiness and Combat Preparedness.  Category-levels 
(C-levels) provide clarity of resource status to advise the SecDEF, CCDRs, and the services on 
current force readiness. C-levels are defined by the JS and derived through quantitative criteria to 
define in qualitative terms the degree to which a measured unit is resourced to provide the level-
of-capability for which it is organized. C-levels reflect the degree to which a unit meets prescribed 
levels of resource-based standards in four measured areas: personnel (P), training (T), 
equipment/supplies on-hand (S), and equipment condition (R). 
4.1.1.  Units will only report on the resources and training organic (assigned or allocated) to 
the measured unit. (T-0) Use only published objective criteria for measurement. (T-1) 
Modification of the computed status of each individually measured resource area is not 
permitted. (T-0) 
4.1.2.  When available, data for the measured areas will be auto populated from the ADSs used 
to manage the personnel, training, and equipment resources. (T-2) 
4.1.3.  Two or more units cannot count the same resource(s) as available. (T-1) 
4.2.  C-levels.  C-levels reflect the degree to which unit resources meet prescribed levels of P, T, 
S, and R. 
4.2.1.  C-1. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake the full 
wartime missions for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training area status 
will neither limit flexibility in methods for mission accomplishment nor increase vulnerability 
of unit personnel and equipment. The unit does not require any compensation for deficiencies. 
4.2.2.  C-2. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake most of the 
wartime missions for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training area status 
may cause isolated decreases in flexibility in methods for mission accomplishment but will not 
increase vulnerability of the unit under most envisioned operational scenarios. The unit would 
require little, if any, compensation for deficiencies. 
4.2.3.  C-3. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake many, but not 
all, portions of the wartime missions for which it is organized or designed. The resource or 
training area status will result in significant decreases in flexibility for mission accomplishment 
and will increase vulnerability of the unit under many, but not all, envisioned operational 
scenarios. The unit would require significant compensation for deficiencies. 
4.2.4.  C-4. The unit requires additional resources or training to undertake its wartime missions, 
but it may be directed to undertake portions of its wartime missions with resources on hand. 
4.2.5.  C-5. The unit is undergoing a Service, Combatant Commander, defense agency, or other 
Department of Defense-directed resource action and is not prepared, currently, to undertake 
the wartime missions for which it is organized or designed. However, the unit may be capable 
of undertaking non-traditional, non-wartime related missions. 
 
 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
25 
4.3.  Not Measured Areas.  P-6/S-6/R-6/T-6 and CBDRT T-6/S-6 designates the unit is service 
directed not to measure the specified area. Units are only authorized to report this if identified 
within the DOC statement and approved by the MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM with HAF FAM 
coordination. Any change to an entire reporting community (i.e., all Air Combat Command 
maintenance units) must be coordinated in writing with AF/A3TR for approval. (T-1) 
4.4.  Assigning Overall C-levels of C-1 to C-4.  Based on unit resource readiness, unit 
commanders or designated alternates, assign the overall C-level each time it is reported. (T-1) The 
lowest level of the measured resource areas is reported as the overall C-level. If the calculated C-
level does not represent the realistic indication of the unit’s readiness based on the C-level 
definitions above, the unit commander can request to override the C-level (see paragraph 4.5.). 
4.5.  Upgrading or Downgrading C-level.  Unit commanders cannot change the unit’s C-level 
without prior approval and must obtain a waiver from the first general officer in their chain of 
command to change, upgrade or downgrade, their C-level assessment submitted that month. (T-0) 
Any changes to an overall C-level should be an exception and only considered in situations or 
circumstances where a subjective change provides a more accurate readiness assessment. (T-0) 
The general officer approving the waiver will ensure the unit can mitigate shortfalls and that the 
upgraded/downgraded level corresponds to the appropriate C-level definition in paragraph 4.2. 
(T-0) If granted, the unit commander will ensure that the reason for the subjective 
upgrade/downgrade is clearly articulated in the “Change C-level” field located in the AF-IT 
“Overall” tab. (T-0) In addition to the reason for the C-level override, unit must include the name 
of general officer, grade, office symbol, and the date of approval. (T-1) Waivers are only valid for 
the 
month 
requested. 
(T-0) 
MAJCOM/AFIMSC 
FAMs 
will 
review 
commanders 
upgrade/downgrade and ensure measurements, ADS(s), and system is not the reasoning for the 
upgrade or downgrade. (T-0) 
4.6.  Assigning Overall C-5.  A parent MAJCOM may authorize use of C-5 for units undergoing 
a service-directed resource action and not prepared to undertake any portion of the mission set for 
which they are organized or designed. MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM will update DOC statements to 
reflect the date when C-5 is authorized, reason for C-5, and maximum duration of C-5 
authorization. (T-1) Units authorized to report C-5 will continue to compute and report measured 
area P-, T-, S-, R-levels IAW paragraph 4.1. (T-1) Units will provide a remark in the “Reason 
For Change” field within the “Change C-level” option located in the AF-IT “Overall” tab, stating 
C-5 authorization start date, end date, and reason for C-5 per DOC statement (for example: “C-5 
authorized 27 JUL 2023, ends 27 JAN 2025. Transitioning from B-1 to B-21 mission.”). (T-1) C-
5 status will not exceed 18 months for RegAF units or 36 months for ARC units. (T-1) Units will 
begin reporting C-5 when the first measured area (P, T, S, R) level reports a level of 4. (T-1) Units 
will report C-5 as the overall C-level until all measured areas (except areas authorized to report 6 
(not measured)) have improved to a level of 3. (T-1) C-5 is only used when authorized by the 
parent MAJCOM and one of the following conditions exists: 
4.6.1.  Unit transition. Unit transitions include modernization/conversion of major equipment 
(i.e., F-15s to F-22s), modernization/upgrade of software in major equipment (i.e., extensive 
equipment testing/personnel user training), a change in a unit’s mission (which can be 
accomplished without changing the major equipment involved), and/or a change in a unit’s 
home station location. Units in transition will follow timelines in paragraph 4.6. (T-1) 
26 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
4.6.2.  Unit activation. Activating units may be authorized to report C-5 until all measured 
areas have reached a reported level of at least 3 (except measured areas authorized to be 
reported 6 (not measured)) or the end of the designated activation period, whichever occurs 
first. (T-1) An activated unit will begin assessing within 30 days when it is determined they 
are a measured unit. (T-1) 
4.6.3.  Unit inactivation. Units may be authorized to report C-5 after the first measured area 
reaches a level of 4 or within three months of inactivation, whichever occurs first. Unit will 
continue to report resource readiness until unit inactivation is authorized by the publication of 
a command order (G-series) and the DOC statement is deleted by the MAJCOM FAM, 
normally 30 days prior to inactivation. (T-2) Unit will be archived in the database when G-
series orders are submitted to AF/A3TR, DOC statement is rescinded, and the Personnel 
Accounting Symbol (PAS) is updated. (T-1) 
4.7.  General Policy for Resource Calculations.  The following policy guidelines apply to all 
measured units. 
4.7.1.  Units will calculate and report area levels for all four measured resource areas (P, S, R, 
and T) unless exempted by the Air Force tables and applied via DOC statement. (T-1) Use 
only published objective criteria for measurement. (T-1) 
4.7.2.  Units reporting a rating level of less than 1 in any measured resource area (P, S, R or T) 
must clearly indicate the reason(s) in applicable remarks. (T-2) 
4.7.3.  The Air Force Input Tool (AF-IT). Air Force units utilize the AF-IT to input, validate, 
and submit resource assessments. To the maximum extent possible, AF-IT automatically 
populates and calculates readiness data from ADSs within the respective measured resource 
areas. 
4.7.3.1.  AF-IT uses a respective unit’s military personnel data system (MilPDS), DEPID-
9 or UIC to apply a given rule set to filter and measure data for each measured area. All 
units with the same DEPID-9 are measured the same regardless of parent MAJCOM. A 
MAJCOM may add additional measured items for units within their command with HAF 
FAM approval. Unique UIC specific rules can also be created and applied with HAF FAM 
approval. The rulesets, or Air Force tables, are hosted on the documents page within DRRS. 
Information is packetized in each measured area to assess specific critical resources 
(personnel, training, and equipment). 
4.7.3.2.  Packets. AF-IT groups data into packets to determine overall criticality. Packets 
are a grouping of like items (i.e., Air Force specialty codes (AFSCs), pieces of equipment) 
that are used to establish the minimum criterion for readiness. HAF FAMs determine 
individual line items or a grouping of line items to facilitate measurement of specific 
resource items. The content of each packet is based upon the specific table the packet 
supports (i.e., personnel, training, or equipment). The packets can be manual or automated 
depending on the determination of the HAF FAM. Manual packets should come with 
guidance from the HAF FAM to facilitate the data input in the manual packet. Auto-
populated packets should be utilized if possible. Manual packets should only be used if 
auto-populated information is not available. 
 
 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
27 
4.7.3.3.  Authoritative Data Source (ADS) information. Units should be familiar with 
applicable ADSs, the currency and frequency of the data pulled into AF-IT, their 
corresponding coordination offices, and the information available for their unit. In cases 
where inaccurate data is populated from the ADS within AF-IT, the unit must work with 
the ADS managers or owners to correct the data so it can accurately reflect in AF-IT. (T-1) 
If an ADS is unable to be fixed prior to assessing, units will provide a remark to identify 
the erroneous data in the assessments and the unit’s intended actions to correct the ADS. 
(T-1) Additionally, if there is an issue with ADS data, the unit will notify the MAJCOM 
CRO/AFIMSC Readiness Office and MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM. (T-1) If a unit’s 
resources are not tracked in an ADS or are tracked in an ADS that AF-IT does not ingest 
data from the ADS, units will notify their S, RMAJCOM/AFIMSC FAMs who will in turn 
work with the HAF FAM and AF/A3TR to capture data for population in AF-IT. (T-2) 
Additional ADSs may be identified and consumed by AF-IT in the future as required. 
4.7.3.4.  Calculating levels. When data involved in calculations is nine or less authorized 
resources in a packet (or possessed, if calculating R equipment condition), AF-IT will use 
Table A2.3., AF-IT Matrix for Measuring 9 or less (aka, Rule of 9’s) to calculate the 
associated percentage. (T-2) For personnel, training, and equipment calculations, AF-IT 
will use Tables A2.4 through A2.9 to convert percentages into associated readiness levels 
(C-, P-, S-, R-, T-levels). (T-1) 
4.8.  Next Change Level.  Unless a unit is assessed as C-1 and forecasting no change in C-level, 
a C-level rating change (CARAT)/C-level rating change date (CADAT) is required. (T-1) The unit 
will utilize the “Next Change level” field in the AF-IT “Overall” tab by choosing the next C-level 
they anticipate achieving, the date of change and a brief explanation or reason for change. (T-1) 
When a unit knows there is a future loss of readiness, the unit is expected to forecast the lower C-
level using the “Next Change Level” field. When a unit reports a C-level less than 1 and is unable 
to forecast a change level and date, the responsible MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM must provide the 
unit assistance to determine the best estimate forecast level and date for unit to report. (T-1) These 
fields should align with the P, S, R, and T remark’s get-well date (GWD). The forecast must be 
reviewed and updated every time a resource assessment is submitted. (T-1) 
4.9.  Tasked Resource Assessment Percentage Effective (PCTEF).  Tasked resource 
assessment PCTEF is a subjective resource assessment of the unit’s currently assigned mission(s) 
supporting Named Operations, also known as its “Assigned level (A-level)” rating. A-level is not 
required to correlate with current C-level as only tasked resources are assessed in PCTEF to 
capture full spectrum unit requirements. For units with multiple assigned missions, AF-IT will 
reflect the lowest A-level (1-4) from the reported assessments. The unit commander will include a 
tasked resource assessment remark for each assigned mission assessed lower than A-1. (T-2) If a 
unit has resources preparing to deploy for an assigned mission, in addition to other resources 
already deployed for an assigned mission that unit will use the tasked resource assessment PCTEF 
to assess its already deployed assets, accompanied by commander’s remarks to show an 
assessment(s) of the other resources preparing to deploy. (T-1) For example, a unit might have 24 
aircraft and 36 crews, but only 6 aircraft and 9 crews are supporting an assigned mission. The 
commander’s assessment would be for the 6 aircraft and 9 crews, and their ability to execute the 
assigned mission. If a unit uses loaned equipment, aircraft and/or personnel to complete an 
assigned mission, then the unit is meeting its assigned mission requirement. 
28 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
4.9.1.  The assessment is required when resources deploy or are employed in place in support 
of a Named Operation. The intent is to capture the readiness of the tasked resources. (T-1) 
Assessments will begin no later than 120 days prior to the deployment/employment or upon 
receipt of an appropriate order. (T-1) Assessments will continue until released from assigned 
mission. (T-1) If a unit is not currently tasked to support a Named Operation, unit will answer 
“No” to “Are any resources deployed/employed, or preparing to deploy/employ within 120 
days” in the PCTEF Tab in AF-IT. If reporting against a Named Operation in PCTEF, it must 
assess the Named Operation in the capability assessment. (T-1) 
4.9.2.  A-levels: A levels reflect the subjective resource readiness of tasked resources and are 
defined as: 
4.9.2.1.  A-1. Unit possesses required resources (personnel and/or equipment) and is 
trained to undertake assigned mission(s). 
4.9.2.2.  A-2. Unit possesses the required resources (personnel and/or equipment) and is 
trained to undertake most of the assigned mission(s). 
4.9.2.3.  A-3. Unit possesses the required resources (personnel and/or equipment) and is 
trained to undertake many, but not all, portions of the assigned mission(s). 
4.9.2.4.  A-4. Unit requires additional resources or training to undertake the assigned 
mission(s); however, the unit may be directed to undertake portions of the mission(s) with 
the resources on-hand. 
4.9.2.5.  AF-IT will format input data into required remark format: the assigned mission(s); 
current status; percent of resources tasked; deployment dates; description of any reduced 
readiness condition(s) for the assigned mission; and any action(s) underway or planned to 
remedy the reduced readiness condition(s) to include a GWD. 
4.10.  Remarks.  Remarks are a critical component of resource assessments and are required when 
a measured resource area calculates a level less than 1. (T-1) DRRS information users often 
selectively retrieve specific pieces of data from the system. For example, this data could be pilot 
training for all F-16 units and the health of the aircraft, or total vehicles assigned throughout a 
specific MAJCOM. The data pulled is used for actionable items for NAFs, MAJCOMs, CCMDs, 
JS, and congressional level inquiries. Accurate and concise remarks help mediate the appropriate 
response and funding decision at the higher levels. 
4.10.1.  All remarks must be written in plain language. (T-1) Remarks should be clear, concise 
and allow for ease of understanding by all consumers. Acronyms, even common Air Force 
acronyms, must be spelled out in each remark area due to JS and non-Air Force usage of data. 
(T-1) 
4.10.2.  Remarks must stand on their own and will not reference previous assessments (i.e., 
“same as last month’s assessment”), other remarks from the same assessment (i.e., “see total 
personnel percentage (PERTP) remark” or “see capability remark”), or other unit assessment 
remarks (i.e., “see maintenance group remark”). (T-1) 
4.10.3.  In general, list resource types with their problems. State numbers authorized, assigned, 
and available; explain the cause of the problem, if known; identify previously requested 
assistance and remedial actions in progress; highlight further actions required; and supply an 
expected GWD for when a unit will attain next level of readiness up to at least C-2. (T-1) 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
29 
4.10.4.  Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF). Provide a strategic summary (two sentence maximum) 
of your unit’s readiness in clear, plain language, in the overall comments section. Units will 
include a BLUF in the overall remarks when their C-level is less than C-1. (T-1) 
4.10.5.  The personnel remark (PRRES), training remark (TRRES), equipment & supplies on-
hand remark (ESRES), and equipment condition remark (ERRES) must contain the following 
information: issue, impact, fix action, and GWD when the measured area is less than one. (T-2) 
4.10.5.1.  Issue (concern/shortfall). Units will provide a thorough explanation of the issue, 
including any limiting factors or change in rating level, using plain language. (T-2) Issues 
must be written so they are actionable. (T-2) 
4.10.5.1.1.  PRRES should specify main driver(s) of why unit is less than P-1 (i.e., 
AFSC shortages, skill-level shortages, civilian shortages by occupational classification 
code (OCC), critical shortages by AFSC, skill-level and/or OCC, and/or availability 
issues of personnel). 
4.10.5.1.2.  TRRES should summarize problems and include if Air Education and 
Training Command formal training school allocation deficiencies exist. A detailed 
summary, to include training course title, of current and future deficiency should be 
included in summary. 
4.10.5.1.3.  ESRES and ERRES should specify all pertinent details such as equipment 
details, on-hand versus authorized quantities, quantity on-hand, quantity on-order, and 
expected delivery date. Units that centrally store equipment or supplies for multiple 
units and are responsible for reporting inventory and status, will note that they centrally 
manage the equipment and will list the stock-level percentage required to be maintained 
by regulation within the remarks. (T-1) 
4.10.5.2.  Impact. Units will describe the mission impact by providing a risk assessment. 
(T-1) Provide an explanation of the mission impact stating what unit is unable to 
accomplish based on resource/training limitations. Clearly state, in plain language, what 
the unit can accomplish if tasked. 
4.10.5.2.1.  PRRES should specify how the lack of personnel or specific critical 
personnel impact the mission of the unit. Critical personnel might not affect day-to-day 
operations, but impact should capture the impact to not having personnel if the unit is 
tasked to perform its wartime mission at a peer-to-peer level of conflict such as impact 
to shift coverage, causing extended timeline to complete mission generation, unable to 
perform coverage of entire base or critical assets. 
4.10.5.2.2.  TRRES should specify how the lack of trained personnel impacts the 
mission of the unit. For example, the impact could include the lack of training to 
conduct specific missions and might require a “spin up” before the unit is ready to 
conduct wartime missions. 
4.10.5.2.3.  ESRES and ERRES should specify any impacts to mission due to missing 
or broken equipment. Impact could include the inability to support specific aircraft 
missions, crash/rescue responses, lack of cyber and communications systems that 
impact command, control, and communications. 
30 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
4.10.5.3.  Fix action (mitigation/solution, way ahead, recommendation). Identify actions 
being taken by unit or assistance needed from other agencies to improve the unit’s 
readiness. (T-1) Identify previously requested assistance and remedial actions in progress. 
Explain unit, group, wing, center, MAJCOM, HAF or an agency exterior to the Air Force 
actions taken or being taken to resolve shortfalls. Include agencies, office symbols, and/or 
names of personnel supporting or needed to support the fixing of the issue. 
4.10.6.  Get Well Date (GWD). Units will provide realistic GWD to a higher rating level for 
each remark. (T-1) At a minimum, determine GWD to reach at least a level of 2 in the measured 
area. If a unit commander is unable to project a GWD, unit must contact the applicable 
MAJCOM FAM for assistance. (T-1) 
4.11.  Overall Reason Codes.  If a unit is reporting less than C-1 for any reason a primary reason 
(REASN) code must be used. (T-1) Additionally, a secondary and tertiary reason (REASN) code 
may be required based on unit assessments. Reference Tables A2.1 and A2.2 for specific overall 
reason codes.

Chapter 5 
PERSONNEL MEASURED AREA 
5.1.  Personnel.  Personnel is used to indicate how well a unit is manned and if it has the personnel 
it needs to support its full spectrum mission(s), as designed, and organized. Personnel rating is 
equal to the lowest level between total personnel and critical personnel rating. Personnel 
measurements are based on a unit’s authorized and funded positions. Units report authorized, 
assigned, and available personnel as part of the personnel category level (P-level) calculation. The 
P-level is the lowest level of total assigned and critical personnel. The following systems are the 
ADSs for calculating personnel: Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES) (funded 
authorizations), MilPDS (assigned individuals to include overages and deployment availability), 
DoD Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) and Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) (medical 
availability). Contractors are not included in the personnel calculation percentage to determine 
total or critical P-level. Individual mobilization augmentees (IMAs) are not included in the 
personnel calculations of RegAF units. 
5.2.  Total Personnel.  Total personnel percentage (PERTP) measures all personnel assigned to 
the unit (includes military, civilians and foreign nationals in US funded/authorized positions). The 
PERTP is calculated by deriving a percentage of total personnel available divided by total 
personnel authorized. 
5.2.1.  Total personnel authorized (TPAUTH) for all units is based on authorized/funded billets 
in the unit manpower document (UMD) which is auto-populated from MPES to AF-IT. 
5.2.2.  Total personnel assigned (TPASG) is determined by counting all military and civilian 
personnel, as reflected in MilPDS, to include foreign nationals, in a unit. All personnel are 
counted for TPASG regardless of AFSC, skill level, or grade and may exceed the TPAUTH 
number. MilPDS and DCPDS are the ADSs for TPASG. See paragraph 5.3 on how to 
determine assigned personnel and exceptions. 
5.2.3.  Total personnel available (TPAVL) is determined by calculating the number of TPASG 
available to the unit. See paragraph 5.5 on how to determine available personnel and 
exceptions. 
5.3.  Determining Personnel Assigned.  Assigned personnel counts the number of personnel 
assigned to the unit. Personnel excluded from assigned personnel count are defined as follows: 
5.3.1.  Do not count TDY personnel from another unit or attached personnel as assigned. 
Personnel temporarily transferred (lent) to, TDY to, or attached to another unit will still be 
counted against the supplying measured unit. (T-1) 
5.3.2.  Air Force Reserve (AFR) and Air National Guard (ANG) personnel attached to a 
RegAF unit will not be included in RegAF personnel calculation. (T-1) Likewise, RegAF 
personnel attached to AFR and ANG units will not be included in the AFR and ANG personnel 
calculation. (T-1) 
5.3.3.  Civilian personnel with reserve or guard commitments are not counted as assigned. 
Civilian personnel with reserve or guard commitments are counted by their unit of military 
assignment. 
32 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
5.3.4.  Non-appropriated funded positions and personnel where DCPDS reports an invalid pay 
plan are not counted as assigned. 
5.3.5.  To ensure authorizations sourced from the UMD are not counted twice or that medical 
students are not counted, personnel billets with resource identification codes (RICs) of 0018 
(Reserve Air Force Off-24 Drill), 0019 (Reserve Air Force Off-48 Drill), 0022 (Reserve Air 
Force Off-Other), 0044 (Act Air Force Off Students), 0118 (Reserve Air Force Enl-24 Drill), 
0122 (Reserve Air Force Enl-Other), 0123 (Reserve Air Force Enl-48 Drill), 0134 (Act Air 
Force Enl Students), 0163 (Reserve Civilian Technicians), and 0170 (National Guard Civilians 
Technicians) are not counted as authorized. 
5.3.6.  Medical units will not count assigned patients (normally assigned AFSC 93P0 or 9P000) 
in personnel calculations. (T-2) 
5.4.  Critical Personnel.  In general, all personnel are important to the mission, but not all 
personnel are critical for mission accomplishment. Critical personnel measures only personnel by 
AFSC or occupational classification code (OCC) as determined by the HAF FAM and identified 
on the Air Force tables. The critical personnel percentage (PERTC) is derived by first calculating 
each critical packet’s AFSCs and/or OCC available divided by the critical packet’s AFSC and/or 
OCC authorizations. Critical packet percentages are averaged together to derive the PERTC. 
5.4.1.  Critical personnel are those identified as essential to the launch, recovery, or 
regeneration of a unit’s weapon system, or direct accomplishment of the unit’s core METL. 
They are critical because their absence would materially affect the core METL 
accomplishment. Personnel are considered “critical” if they meet one or more of the following 
criteria: 
5.4.1.1.  Personnel with AFSCs essential to fulfilling the unit’s mission tasks based on 
authorized/funded billets. 
5.4.1.2.  Absence of personnel possessing AFSC/OCC that would render the unit severely 
deficient or totally unable to execute its mission. 
5.4.2.  Critical personnel authorized (CPAUR) is determined by counting the number of 
TPAUTH positions that match the AFSC/OCC(s) listed in the Air Force tables in each critical 
packet. 
5.4.3.  Critical personnel assigned (CPASG) is determined by counting the number of critical 
personnel assigned to authorized positions on the UMD within a given packet. Enlisted 
personnel are assigned to a critical personnel packet based on matching the critical AFSC from 
the Air Force tables to the primary AFSC (PAFSC), control AFSC (CAFSC) and duty AFSC 
(DAFSC), in this order. Officers are assigned to a critical personnel packet based on matching 
the critical AFSC from the Air Force tables to the DAFSC and PAFSC in this order. The first 
AFSC to match the Air Force tables determines which critical personnel packet they are 
assigned to. For example, if an enlisted member has a PAFSC of 3P051, CAFSC of 3P051, 
DAFSC of 1C331 and the critical AFSC is 3P051, they will populate based on the PAFSC. 
5.4.4.  Critical personnel available (CPAVL) is determined by calculating the number of 
CPASG available to the unit for each packet. See paragraph 5.5 for guidance on available 
personnel. 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
33 
5.4.5.  Critical personnel overages (percentages exceeding 100%) will be calculated for critical 
personnel packets containing only 5-levels or 7-levels. Packets containing officers, 3 levels, 9-
levels or a combination of skill-levels will be capped at 100%. 
5.5.  Determining Personnel Availability.  Availability depends on the combination of medical 
and administrative factors that determine if an individual is available for their full-spectrum 
mission. Units will not consider training status when calculating personnel availability as that 
should be assessed in training. (T-2) The following guidelines will be used to determine if 
personnel are available or not available: 
5.5.1.  Deployed, employed, and TDY personnel conducting the unit’s mission are considered 
available regardless of current deployed/employed location. (T-2) Deployed unit resources are 
not expected to return to home station within the unit response time to be available, instead 
they must be ready to employ/deploy from current location within the unit response time. 
Commanders can downgrade the overall C-level assessment, IAW paragraph 4.5, if their 
deployed/employed personnel are not ready to execute their wartime mission. (T-2) 
5.5.2.  Personnel in permanent change station/assignment (PCS/A) status are available until 
signed into new unit. Personnel on leave are considered available provided they can be recalled 
within the unit response time (includes terminal leave status until final out-processing with 
MPF). (T-2) 
5.5.3.  Personnel with the following Deployment Availability (DAV) codes or any DAV code 
that denotes they are “not available for deployment” or “available except for deployments to 
hostile fire zone” are considered not available for P-rating consideration. However, these 
personnel should be counted as available IF they are fit for duty AND their place of 
employment is home station. This primarily applies to those units who are “Employed In 
Place". Otherwise, personnel will be considered available provided they can be recalled within 
the unit response time (i.e., DAV 81 personnel are still available). (T-2)

regardless of DAV code (for example, pending courts martial, civil trial or other extenuating 
circumstances not codified in the airman’s personnel record). (T-1) 
5.5.5.  Commanders will use IMR when determining personnel medical availability. (T-1) 
Personnel with an IMR status of not medically ready will generally be categorized as not 
available. (T-1) However, these personnel should be counted if they are fit for duty and their 
place of employment is home station. Personnel with an IMR status of fully medically ready, 
partially medically ready, or unknown will be categorized as available. (T-1) 
5.6.  Personnel reason codes.  When P-level is less than P-1, select the most specific reason code 
listed in the personnel sub area in the AF-IT report. A list of P reason codes can be found in

Chapter 6 
TRAINING MEASURED AREA 
6.1.  Training.  T-level is used to indicate how well a unit and its airmen are trained to support its 
full spectrum mission(s), as designed and organized. Training is assessed utilizing three categories: 
Mission Ready, Primary and Secondary categories. 
6.2.  Mission Ready Airman (MRA) Training.  Mission Ready Airman (MRA)/crews training 
will be assessed either as individual airmen or by crews or teams. (T-1) MRA training is intended 
to measure if personnel are trained to undertake their portion of the mission for which their unit 
has been organized, trained, and equipped. 
6.2.1.  HAF FAMs will determine what it means to be “Mission Ready Airman” and 
communicate requirements to AF/A3TR and their functional communities. (T-1) It is highly 
recommended to provide the specific career field education and training plan tasks, job 
qualification standard tasks, certifications, training requirements, or other pertinent data via 
the Air Force tables for clarity in the defining of “Mission Ready Airman.”  HAF FAMs will 
include the definition for MRA in the Air Force training tables for the functional communities 
they manage. (T-1) MRA training packets will align with the critical personnel identified on 
the Air Force tables. (T-1) For example, if 3-levels or a specific AFSC are not considered 
critical personnel, their training will correspondingly not be measured as a critical packet. If 
personnel have an AFSC that is identified on the critical personnel table, their training will be 
assessed regardless if the unit has an authorization for the critical AFSC. For example, if a unit 
has a 2T231 assigned in the unit but they have no authorizations for 2T231, the individual will 
still populate as part of the Mission Ready Airman training calculation. 
6.2.2.  Aviation units will report at a minimum “Mission Ready Crews”. (T-1) It is highly 
recommended that other unit types that utilize crews or teams (i.e., missile squadrons, air 
control squadrons, cyberspace squadrons) utilize the Mission Ready Crew reporting. The HAF 
FAM will determine the best representation of their units based on individuals or the crew/team 
concept. If Mission Ready Crews are assessed, the HAF FAM will determine the crew/team 
composition and provide it via the Air Force training tables along with the narrative defining 
what it means to be “Mission Ready Crews.” (T-1) 
6.3.  Primary Training Category.  Primary training category is utilized to capture training data 
that is significant to identify concerns in personnel training. This category can capture training that 
supports the mission ready category (i.e., individual AFSC training for personnel that are part of a 
Mission Ready Crew or specific training events that are required to make an individual mission 
ready) and the FAM can determine whether each training packet is part of the training category 
level (T-level) calculation or not. Primary training typically measures by AFSC(s), duty positions, 
training events, missions, etc. If crews or teams are identified, the FAM will determine the 
composition. Primary training category items should also capture critical training required for 
METs. (T-1) 
 
 
36 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
6.4.  Secondary Training Category.  Secondary training category is utilized to capture critical 
training data but will never affect the T-level calculation of the unit. The intent for secondary 
training categories is to capture training that does not directly support mission ready or MET 
training, but to capture trend analysis or supporting information that could affect the 
unit/community. Secondary training categories can also be implemented for short duration training 
data call requests by AF/A3TR to support senior leader inquiries. 
6.5.  Training Level calculations.  Unit training percentage is determined by dividing the amount 
of personnel trained by total assigned personnel. Primary training category will be calculated only 
using the measured areas (“Yes”), which will give you an average percentage. (T-1) Between 
mission ready training and primary training category, the lowest percentage will be used for the 
overall T-level. (T-1) 
6.6.  Training Reason Codes.  When T-level is less than T-1, select the most specific reason code 
listed in the training sub area in the AF-IT report. A list of T reason codes can be found in 
Attachment 2. 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024

Chapter 7 
EQUIPMENT MEASURED AREAS 
7.1.  Equipment and Supplies On-Hand Reporting.  S-level is used to indicate the equipment 
and supplies the unit possesses to support its full spectrum mission(s), as designed and organized. 
Equipment and supplies on-hand reporting is based on a unit’s authorizations, through an Air Force 
approved ADS (i.e., Automated Readiness Information System (ARIS), Integrated Logistics 
System-Supply (ILS-S), Defense Property Accountability System (DPAS)) providing authorized 
and possessed equipment and supplies. If equipment is not auto-populated in AF-IT, units will 
work with MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM to ensure it is captured in the Air Force tables or to create a 
manual packet if auto-population is not possible. (T-1) 
7.1.1.  Combat essential and support equipment on-hand. Air Force tables identify what 
equipment is considered combat essential or combat support as determined by the HAF FAM. 
Combat essential equipment is identified as essential to the launch, recovery, or turnaround of 
a unit’s weapon system, or direct accomplishment of the unit’s core METL and full spectrum 
mission. Equipment that does not meet the definition of combat essential will be considered 
combat support. (T-1) Equipment is critical because the absence would materially affect the 
core METL accomplishment. 
7.1.2.  Equipment and supplies on-hand category level (S-level) calculations. AF-IT divides 
the equipment possessed by the equipment authorized to determine each equipment packet’s 
S-level. Combat essential and combat support equipment each have an S-level determined by 
the lowest packet. Overall S-level is determined by the lowest rating between combat essential 
and combat support equipment sections. 
7.1.3.  Item Possession. To determine equipment possessed, the unit must have actual 
responsibility for the equipment according to applicable supply regulations. (T-2) Equipment 
items will not be double counted. (T-1) Deployed equipment will be considered possessed if 
it remains assigned to the unit and is readily available for use at deployed location. (T-2) 
7.1.3.1.  Equipment loaned to another unit to augment their resources will be counted as 
possessed by the owning unit. (T-2) The receiving unit will not count these resources for 
readiness reporting. (T-2) 
7.1.3.2.  Equipment inventory in excess of the number authorized is not included as 
possessed. 
7.1.3.3.  Items in programmed depot-level maintenance or time compliance technical order 
depot modification will not be counted. (T-1) 
7.1.3.4.  For further details on determining if equipment is possessed, reference DoDI 
1225.06, Equipping the Reserve Forces, and Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 23-122, 
Materiel Management Procedures. 
7.1.4.  Equipment and supplies on-hand reason codes. When S-level is less than S-1, select the 
most specific reason code listed in the equipment sub area in the AF-IT report. A list of S 
reason codes can be found in Attachment 2. 
 
 
38 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
7.2.  Equipment Condition Reporting.  R-level is used to measure the combat essential and 
support equipment that are expected to be ready within the unit’s response time to undertake the 
unit’s full spectrum mission. This measurement is also used to indicate maintenance and 
equipment reliability, serviceability, and operational status of assets. This measurement includes 
the status of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability for equipment that carry the requirement. 
Units compute the equipment condition category level (R-level) for combat essential and support 
equipment based on the availability of possessed equipment. 
7.2.1.  Mission Ready and Available. Most equipment is considered mission ready if the 
equipment is safe to use and in suitable condition to perform the functions for which it was 
designed or made ready within the unit response time. If an ADS does not track equipment 
condition, AF-IT will default the condition to available. Deployed equipment will be 
considered available if it is possessed by the owning unit and readily available for use, 
deployment, or employment regardless of location. (T-2) 
7.2.2.  Equipment condition R-level calculations. AF-IT divides the equipment available by 
the equipment possessed to determine each equipment packet’s R-level. Combat essential and 
combat support equipment each have an R-level determined by the lowest packet. Overall R-
level is determined by the lowest rating between combat essential and combat support 
equipment sections. 
7.2.3.  Equipment condition reason codes. When R-level is less than R-1, select the most 
specific reason code listed in the equipment sub area in the AF-IT report. A list of R reason 
codes can be found in Attachment 2.

Chapter 8 
CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE READINESS TRAINING (CBDRT) REPORT 
8.1.  CBDRT C-level.  All measured units will assess the status of training and equipment required 
to accomplish chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) defense. (T-1) The CBDRT 
is used to assess the unit’s ability to survive and operate while conducting the mission(s) for which 
the unit was organized or designed under CBRN environments. (T-1) The CBDRT overall C-level 
is determined by the lowest of the two measured areas: equipment and supplies on-hand (S-level) 
and training (T-level). C-levels reflect the degree to which unit resources meet prescribed levels 
of S and T. CBDRT is its own report and does not affect resource readiness ratings. (T-1) 
8.1.1.  Assigning Overall CBDRT C-1-5. Based on unit resource readiness, unit commanders 
or designated alternates will assign the CBDRT C-level each time it is reported. (T-1) Units 
will assess CBDRT C-level using the CBDRT equipment and CBDRT training tabs of the Air 
Force tables for DRRS. (T-1) The CBDRT C-level is listed in AF-IT, and if less than C-1, a 
reason is listed in the CBDRT REASN remark field. The applicable reason code will be listed 
in the CBDRT REASN field. (T-1) 
8.1.2.  CBDRT C-level Forecast. Use these data elements whenever the CBDRT C-level is less 
than C-1. 
8.1.3.  Remarks. Remarks will be completed and formatted IAW paragraph 4.10 of this 
instruction. (T-1) 
8.1.4.  Overall Reason Codes. If a unit is less than C-1 primary REASN code must be used. 
(T-1) A list of reason codes can be found in Attachment 2. 
8.2.  CBDRT S-level.  CBDRT equipment measurement is used to assess the serviceability of the 
CBRN equipment a unit possesses as compared to what it is authorized as defined by Air Force 
tables within DRRS. (T-1) CBDRT equipment reported can be found under the CBDRT equipment 
tab on the Air Force tables. Item possession will be IAW paragraph 7.1.3. (T-1) When S-level is 
less than S-1, select the most specific reason code. A list of equipment supply reason codes can be 
found in Attachment 2. 
8.3.  CBDRT T-level.  Training measures the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN 
environment. Training requirements will be IAW DAFI 10-2503, Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Program, AFI 10-405, Ready Airman Training, and the 
Air Force tables within DRRS. (T-1) CBDRT training reported can be found under the CBDRT 
training tab on the Air Force tables within DRRS. When T-level is less than T-1, select the most 
specific reason code. A list of training reason codes can be found in Attachment 2.

AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
Chapter 9 
CAPABILITY READINESS 
9.1.  Capability Readiness.  All measured units will accomplish a capability assessment by 
reporting their ability to accomplish METs and their associated standards. (T-0) Base assessments 
on factors such as resource assessments, training, exercises, evaluations, supporting unit resource 
and capability assessments, etc., the unit assesses capability and capacity against mission 
requirements defined in mission directives, OPLANS, concept of operations, Named Operations, 
etc. (T-0) Tasks can be linked in DRRS using “Staff Tasks” (linking to tasks assessed by the 
organizations internal tasks), “Subordinate Tasks” (offices in subordinate UICs), and “Command 
Linked Tasks” (linking to tasks assessed by units outside the UIC and are not subordinate to the 
UIC) to show the elements needed to fully inform the task assessment. Commanders should work 
with their WRO, Wing Plans, MAJCOM FAMs, or other higher authorities to determine what 
OPLANs and/or Named Operations are required to be assessed. Units with multiple assigned 
missions may be required to assess these missions. If reporting against a Named Operation in 
PCTEF, it must also be reported in a capability assessment. (T-1) 
9.2.  Capability Ratings.  Capability ratings reflect the degree to which the unit can execute the 
mission and task(s) to capacity. METs will be assessed via the three-tier (Y / Q / N) scale: 
9.2.1.  “Yes” (Y) Rating. Unit can accomplish the task to established standards and conditions. 
9.2.2.  “Qualified Yes” (Q) Rating. Unit can accomplish all or most tasks to standard under 
most conditions. 
9.2.3.  “No” (N) Rating. Unit currently unable to accomplish the task to prescribed standard 
and conditions at this time. 
9.3.  Assessing Capability.  Commanders will take into consideration factors such as resources 
the unit possesses, and the resources and capabilities possessed by the units that directly support it 
when assessing the unit’s mission(s) (core, Named Operations, Top Priority Plans/OPLANs). 
(T-1) For example, when assessing a MET, an aviation unit should consider the status of their own 
resources and the resources/capabilities of their associated aircraft maintenance squadron, 
operations support squadron, and logistics support as part of the overall MET or mission rating. 
9.3.1.  Assessment ratings of each individual task will be based on capability rating definitions 
in paragraph 9.2 informed by the assessed standards and when assessed. (T-1) If any standard 
could not be achieved, the system will calculate the MET Assessment as “No.” MET 
Assessment ratings can be adjusted by unit commander, but if so, a remark is required to 
explain the adjustment. (T-1) 
9.3.2.  Ultimately the Overall Assessment is the responsibility of the commander and if 
deviating from the guidelines, a remark is required. Overall mission assessment rating will 
apply the following guidelines to ensure consistent readiness assessments: 
9.3.2.1.  If more than half of the METs are assessed as “Yes” and no METs are assessed as 
“No”, then the overall mission assessment should be “Yes”. (T-0) 
9.3.2.2.  If more than half of the METs are assessed as “Qualified Yes” and no METs are 
assessed as “No”, then the overall mission assessment should be “Qualified Yes”. (T-0) 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
41 
9.3.2.3.  If any METs are assessed as “No,” then the overall Mission Assessment should 
be “No.” The commander may subjectively decide the mission can still be accomplished if 
a MET is “No” and upgrade the overall mission assessment. The commander will then 
clearly explain how the full mission will be accomplished despite the inability to 
accomplish one or more MET(s) and any mitigation actions taken. (T-0) 
9.3.3.  Anticipated change rating and date. The anticipated change date in DRRS defaults to 
30 days from date of current assessment. Units must update the rating to a rating other than 
current rating and update the date to the date they anticipate the change. (T-1) If a unit is 
reporting “Yes” and there is no anticipated change over the next 12-month period, the unit will 
update the anticipated change date to reflect at least 12 months from the current report date. 
(T-1) 
9.4.  Mission Essential Task List (METL).  All measured units will assess capability against an 
Air Force METL. (T-1) The Air Force METL template is based on DEPID-9 mission prioritization 
matrix (MPM) and standardizes tasks, standards, and conditions a unit is expected to accomplish. 
9.4.1.  Mission Prioritization Matrix (MPM). The MPM is the source document that establishes 
the standardized capability reporting model for a functional area, referred to as the DEPID-9. 
Currently MPMs are located on the AF/A3TR SIPR Intelink. The goal of the MPM is to 
identify the pacing threat and mission sets. This gives unit commanders clear priorities to 
support strategic efforts when in a resource-constrained environment. The MPM, managed by 
the HAF FAM, identifies the applicable references (National Defense Strategy (NDS), 
National Military Strategy (NMS), Air Force Doctrine, Global Campaign Plans, etc.) utilized 
to identify and prioritize the tasks for the DEPID-9. The MPM will prioritize all METs for all 
units within the DEPID-9. (T-1) The MPM can also identify variant missions for MAJCOMs 
and/or specific units if their mission requirements are different to the core MPM for the 
community. Any identified variant mission also requires applicable references to be identified 
and what MAJCOM or specific units the variant applies to. 
9.4.1.1.  MPM Maintenance. The MPM is the foundation on which the Air Force METL 
template. The METL template identifies the METs required, and performance measures 
used. HAF FAMs will submit any updates via the DRRS METL template tool in DRRS to 
AF/A3TR for approval. (T-1) MPMs will be reviewed annually or upon significant changes 
in the NDS/NMS to ensure accuracy and applicability. (T-1) Change requests to the MPM 
will be coordinated with the MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM, the impacted HAF FAM, and 
AF/A3TR. (T-1) 
9.4.1.2.  MAJCOM FAMs will use the MPM and METL templates to assign applicable 
METs to units. MAJCOM FAMs will determine applicable METs and performance 
measures are applied, and are prioritized as directed by the MPM. (T-1) 
9.4.1.3.  Unit commanders will utilize the MPM to review listed references to ensure unit 
efforts are in line with the priorities as identified and to better understand what is expected 
if utilized during high-end, full spectrum operations. (T-1) 
9.4.2.  Core METL. All measured units will assess a core METL. (T-1) A core METL consists 
of the fundamental capabilities for which a unit was designed and resourced. The core METL 
will be the tasks identified in the core mission or applicable variant from the MPM and 
maintained in the METL template tool in DRRS. (T-1) 
42 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
9.4.3.  Augmenting core METL. Units designed and resourced with excess or limited 
capabilities may request their core METL be augmented through their MAJCOM/AFIMSC 
FAM. MAJCOMs/AFIMSC may not add, delete, or modify tasks and/or task performance 
standards/conditions to any core METL without approval by the owning HAF FAM. The 
MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM will maintain documentation of such approvals and notify the CRO 
of core METL modifications. (T-1) HAF FAM will also update applicable MPM and METL 
template for accuracy. (T-1) 
9.4.4.  Named Operations and Top Priority Plans. Named Operations or Top Priority Plan 
mission assessments do not necessarily correlate with a unit’s core METL assessment. 
Commanders must analyze the Named Operation or Top Priority Plan and determine which 
specific MET(s) from the unit core METL is required by the tasked Named Operation or Top 
Priority Plan. (T-1) Additionally, the specific performance measures in the MET(s) applied to 
the Named Operation or Top Priority Plan are required to be reviewed by the unit commander 
and tailored to match tasked mission. Ensure MET(s) are assigned when loading Named 
Operations or Top Priority Plans. The WRO, wing plans, installation deployment officer, 
and/or MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM will assist units in determining the specific METs and 
performance measures that apply. (T-1) Only METs from a unit’s core mission will be utilized 
in a Named Operation or Top Priority Plan Assessments (reference Table 9.1 for example). 
(T-1) If METs required for the Named Operation or the Top Priority Plan are not part of the 
unit’s core METL, consult the MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM for direction on augmenting the 
METL. See paragraph 9.4.5 and paragraph 9.4.6 respectively for definitions of Named 
Operations and Top Priority Plans.

9.4.5.  Named Operations METL. Named Operations are designated by the President, SecDEF, 
and/or Joint Chiefs of Staff (i.e., Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) or Operation 
NOBLE EAGLE (ONE)). Measured units will assess IAW paragraph 4.9 when supporting a 
single Named Operation or combination of Named Operations. (T-1) 
9.4.5.1.  When assessing, resources already tasked to a Named Operation will be 
considered unavailable for any other Named Operation assessment (i.e., unit personnel and 
aircraft supporting ONE from home station would be considered unavailable for an OEF 
mission assessment). (T-1) While the resources cannot be used for another Named 
Operation or Top Priority Plan, any employed/deployed resources will be counted as 
available IAW paragraphs 5.5.1, 7.1.3, and 7.2.1. (T-1) 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
43 
9.4.5.2.  When assessing a Named Operation, the assessment will only consider those 
assets directly supporting the Named Operation. (T-1) For example, a unit might have 100 
vehicles and 50 personnel, but only 5 vehicles and 10 personnel are tasked to support the 
Named Operation. The commander’s Named Operation METL assessment would only 
assess the capabilities of the 5 vehicles and 10 personnel. If a unit has resources preparing 
for a specific Named Operation in addition to other resources already deployed for the 
same Named Operation, the unit will assess both the deployed resources and those 
resources preparing to deploy in the PCTEF portion of the resource assessment. (T-1) 
9.4.6.  Top Priority Plan METL. Top Priority Plan assessments are only required for level 4 
plans, designated in the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. Any unit assigned, allocated, or 
apportioned to a level 4 plan will assess their ability to provide capabilities tasked in the plan 
and to execute the plan. (T-1) MAJCOMs may direct non-level 4 plans to be assessed as part 
of the unit’s Top Priority Plan METLs. Reporting of the Top Priority Plan will continue until 
released from the plan. (T-1) 
9.4.6.1.  When assessing, resources already tasked to a Top Priority Plan will be considered 
as unavailable for any other Top Priority Plan Assessment (i.e., unit personnel and aircraft 
supporting ONE from home station would be unavailable for a Top Priority Plan Mission 
Assessment). (T-1) Resources at exercises or training events will be counted as available 
for Top Priority Plan METL Assessments. (T-1) 
9.4.6.2.  Assessments will be based on “Planning factors” only. (T-1) Per CJCS Guide 
(GDE) 3130, Joint Planning and Execution Overview and Policy Framework, contingency 
sourced forces (in level 4 Plans) are specific forces identified by actual unit name and UIC 
by the joint force providers, which are assisted by their service components and parent 
services that meet the planning requirement at a specified time. 
9.5.  MET Assessments.  Commanders are responsible for assessing their unit’s ability to 
accomplish the tasks to prescribed performance standards under specified conditions. This 
assessment should consider resource availability and observed performance. However, if observed 
performance is not recent/current, then the commander will use their military experience and 
knowledge of their unit when making an assessed value assessment. When considering currency 
of observed performance, many factors should be considered: complexity of tasks, type of 
exercise/event observed, unit personnel changeover, experience, etc. If no longer current/relevant, 
then remove the observed value and date until the next observation event. The ultimate authority 
for a capability assessment rating is the unit commander. (T-1) Units should use the assessments 
of their subordinate units, internal staff, or other pre-designated external supporting organizations 
to inform their own MET assessments. This information is derived from staff supporting tasks, 
subordinate unit tasks, and command-linked tasks. 
9.5.1.  Assessed Value. The assessed value is the measured value of the performance measure 
rating. Assessed values may be informed by resources or commander’s judgement. This value 
does not require an evaluated event. Assessed value is required by the system to complete a 
MET assessment. System-assigned status of “Achieved” & “Not Achieved” is based on 
assessed value only. 
 
 
44 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
9.5.2.  Observed Value. The observed value and date will only be input when a performance 
measure is performed/observed as part of an evaluated event (i.e., flag exercises, inspector 
general (IG) readiness exercises, operational exercises, etc.). (T-1) Performance measures 
should be periodically observed to validate the assessed value. Observed values and dates are 
only provided when a performance measure (capability) is observed and evaluated. Observed 
value is not required to assess the performance measure and will not affect the performance 
measure rating. (T-1) 
9.5.2.1.  Staff supporting task. Performed by the organization’s internal staff. UAs will 
work with staff elements in determining appropriate tasks, conditions, and standards. (T-1) 
As with METs, these tasks should strongly support and/or impact the mission—they should 
not be routine activities or non-essential tasks (i.e., a MAJCOM could create staff tasks for 
agencies within the MAJCOM that support the task the MAJCOM performs). 
9.5.2.2.  Subordinate unit task. Performed by organizations below unit and in the same 
chain of command. The task owner identifies subordinate unit task(s) from the linked unit’s 
existing METL that are essential to accomplishing reporting units MET (i.e., a maintenance 
group could have a subordinate unit task to the squadrons within its group or a MAJCOM 
could link to an aviation unit as they are in the chain of the command of the unit). 
9.5.3.  Command linked task. Performed by organizations external to the task owner’s chain 
of command. The task owners identify command-linked tasks directly from the linked unit’s 
existing METL, for example: an aviation unit could command-link a task to aircraft 
maintenance or logistics readiness unit as they provide aircraft support but are not in the chain 
of the command of the aviation unit. Or a MAJCOM could command-link a task in another 
MAJCOM or service that supports the MAJCOM task. Command linking will be performed 
when the capabilities of a unit depend largely on the capabilities of a supporting unit (i.e., an 
operational unit linking to maintenance, logistics, and operational support and TFA associate 
unit). (T-1) Command linking can be made at different levels provided both organizations 
agree, and the linking is coordinated. 
9.6.  METL Creation.  Measured units will assess their designed (core) capabilities readiness 
determined by the Air Force standardized core METL associated with their functional area. (T-1) 
Each MET will use a capability-based performance measure focused on “what should the unit be 
able to do” not on “what does the unit have.”  To create a METL, HAF FAMs will first select 
applicable tasks from the UJTL. If one is not found, they will select tasks from the AFUTL for use 
in the core METL. (T-1) If no applicable Air Force Task exists, see the AFUTL for additional 
information about MET/METL development. The AFUTL can be queried by AF/A3TR upon 
request. The METL will be developed and coordinated in advance, if possible, by the POC listed 
in FAM POC listing in functional area manager Common Operating Picture (CoP). (T-1) If a POC 
is not identified in the FAM POC listing, then AF/A3TR will assign a POC to develop the METL, 
usually the HAF FAM. (T-1) For multifunctional units (i.e., operational support squadron or 
logistics readiness squadron), the HAF FAM for the functional area with the preponderance of the 
unit mission, to include equipment, will serve as the OPR. (T-1) The other HAF FAMs for 
multifunctional units will serve as offices of collateral coordinating responsibility. (T-1) 
 
 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
45 
9.7.  Capability Remarks.  Remarks are required whenever a "Qualified Yes" or “No” assessment 
is used, or a “Yes” assessment is used when guidelines would indicate a “Qualified Yes” or “No”. 
(T-1) Comments should be clear and concise, but not at the expense of the details needed. Each 
comment must stand on its own content. As DRRS is dynamic and comments may change from 
assessment to assessment, do not refer to previous assessments. (T-2) Do not submit comments 
referencing other comments. (T-2) To eliminate confusion by DRRS customers, abbreviations and 
acronyms must be spelled out in each comment. (T-2) Comments will be considered SECRET (the 
classification of DRRS) unless otherwise portion marked. All remarks provided must contain the 
following information: (T-2) 
9.7.1.  Issue. Subject/title labeling of the issue impacting the assessment of a specific 
MET/mission. 
9.7.2.  Discussion. Provide a thorough explanation of the issue using plain language. If the 
issue is resource-centric (i.e., lack of equipment on-hand), include the comment date and 
provide appropriate details, such as part numbers, national stock numbers, nomenclature, 
quantity authorized, quantity on-hand, quantity on-order, and expected delivery date. (T-3) 
The specific standards and conditions that cannot be met as well as shortfalls or issues affecting 
the unit's ability to accomplish the task must be clearly detailed in the MET Assessment. (T-3) 
9.7.3.  Impact. Describe the mission impact using plain language, providing a risk assessment 
when appropriate. (T-3) The commander will provide a detailed remark explaining why the 
unit cannot accomplish the designed mission, specifically addressing why possessed resources 
are insufficient to accomplish the METL. (T-1) 
9.7.4.  Mitigation/solution. Identify actions being taken or assistance needed to improve the 
unit’s readiness. (T-3) Identify previously requested assistance and remedial actions in 
progress; explain unit, wing, or MAJCOM/AFIMSC actions taken to resolve shortfalls. (T-3) 
What near- and long-term efforts are being taken to mitigate the risk, and proposed solutions. 
9.7.5.  Timeline for resolution. Provide realistic GWD to higher rating for each remark using 
the day, month, and year (DD MMM YY) date format (i.e., “Qualified Yes on 17 FEB 25”). 
(T-3) When possible, provide progressive GWDs to highest possible level unit anticipates 
reaching (i.e., “Qualified Yes on 01 JAN 25, Yes on 01 JUN 25”). If a unit commander is 
unable to project a GWD, unit must contact the applicable FAM for assistance. (T-3) If GWD 
still cannot be determined after MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM and higher headquarter 
coordination, then it can be considered undeterminable in which case GWD will state: 
“Undeterminable” and include FAM name and office contact information that approved 
undeterminable status. (T-3) 
9.7.6.  Links: Issue’s relationship to overall concerns, other deficiencies, GFM shortfalls, and 
risk drivers. 
9.7.7.  When assessing Named Operations, remarks will include a description of the level of 
effort the unit is providing in support of the Named Operation tasking. (T-1) Commanders 
should consider describing the deployment location, deployment duration, number of 
personnel and equipment deployed, and any special requirements/issues associated with the 
deployment. 
46 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
9.7.8.  If a Top Priority Plan Assessment is degraded (i.e., “Q” or “N”) due to deployed assets, 
then commanders will clearly annotate the degradation reason in the Top Priority Plan remark. 
(T-1) 
9.7.9.  Unit commanders will provide a remark as part of the overall mission assessment for 
their core METL if the capability assessment of the core does not align with resource 
assessment C-level as found in Table 9.2 (T-1) The remark for misalignment would be a 
separate comment in addition to the remarks of the mission assessment. 
Table 9.2.  Alignment of Resource and Capability Assessments Ratings. 
  Resource 
C-1 
C-2 
C-3 
C-4 
C-5 
  Capability 
Yes 
Qualified Yes 
No 
9.7.10.  Table 9.2 does not dictate mandatory rating alignment of capability and resource 
ratings, but intends for the remark to be used to identify any disconnect or misalignment in 
level of capability able to be executed given the level of resources the unit possesses (i.e., if 
unit is C-4, how they can still fully complete their core mission by rating it “Yes” or if fully 
resourced (C-1), why the unit cannot execute its core mission). Unit commanders, FAMs, wing 
POCs, and other users of DRRS may use the example within Table 9.3 as a means for 
identifying misalignments between the capability and Resource Assessment. 
Table 9.3.  Misalignment Example.

Chapter 10 
FORCE ELEMENT ASSESSMENTS 
10.1.  Force Element Readiness Assessments.  FE assessment authority will accomplish a FE 
readiness assessment quarterly, no matter the phase, by reporting the ability of a FE to execute the 
capabilities defined in its mission capability (MISCAP) statement in major combat operations 
against a peer competitor, as required by the National Military Strategy (NMS). (T-0) This report 
will be completed quarterly (March, June, September, and December) between the 11th and 20th 
of each of the reporting months. (T-1) The assessment will be informed by the readiness of the 
personnel and equipment aligned with each FE, as represented in the UTC assessments within 
DCAPES, as well as through additional insights provided via DRRS unit reports and the wing 
readiness briefings, as outlined in paragraph 2.8.2. (T-2) 
10.1.1.  FE readiness assessment scale. FE readiness will be assessed via the three-tier (Y / Q 
/ N) scale: (T-2) 
10.1.1.1.  “Yes” indicates that the FE can unequivocally execute its MISCAP in major 
combat operations against a peer competitor. To reach this category, the FE cannot have 
any “No” UTCs. 
10.1.1.2.  “Qualified Yes” indicates that the FE can execute its MISCAP but is limited in 
some capacity. To reach this category, the FE’s “Lead UTC” (if designated in DCAPES) 
must be “Yes”. (T-2) 
10.1.1.3.  “No” indicates that the FE cannot execute its MISCAP at all. (T-2) 
10.2.  Force Element Availability Assessments.  For FEs in the CERTIFY and AVAILABLE to 
COMMIT phases, the assessment authority will also accomplish an availability assessment by 
reporting the ability of the FE(s) to execute the capabilities defined in its MISCAP as required by 
the most relevant Execution Order, OPLAN, etc. (T-1) The assessment will be informed by the 
readiness of the personnel and equipment aligned with each FE, as represented in the UTC 
assessments, through additional insights provided via DRRS unit reports and the wing readiness 
briefings, as outlined in paragraph 2.8.2, and successful completion of the Certifying Event. (T-1) 
A FE availability assessment will be accomplished quarterly during the CERTIFY and 
AVAILABLE to COMMIT phases until assessed as a “Yes”. (T-1) If the assessment changes to a 
“No” due to any unforeseen circumstances, the FE assessment authority must re-accomplish an 
availability assessment within 24 hours. (T-1)  
10.2.1.  FE availability assessment scale. FE availability assessments will fall within two 
categories: 
10.2.1.1.  “Yes” indicates that the FE can execute its MISCAP and has successfully 
completed a Certifying Event. (T-1) Additionally, the “Lead UTC” (if designated in 
DCAPES) must be assessed “green” in order for the FE assessment to be “Yes.” (T-1) Only 
FEs that are assessed as “Yes” should be offered for tasking. 
10.2.1.2.  “No” indicates that the FE cannot execute its MISCAP at all. FEs that were 
assessed as “No” for the readiness assessment, should default to “No” for their availability 
assessment. FEs assessing as “No” in the AVAILABLE to COMMIT phase, will be 
expected to adhere to DAFI 10-401 shortfall procedures if tasked. (T-1) 
48 
AFI10-201  5 JUNE 2024 
10.2.2.  Capstone Certification Event. When a FE enters the CERTIFY phase, the FE has 
reached the final stages of its training progression that was enabled by the RESET and 
PREPARE phases. The Certifying Event(s) will certify that the personnel and equipment 
within that FE are able to operate as a cohesive entity and perform the capabilities defined in 
the MISCAP. (T-2) If a FE is preparing for a specific tasking, the Certifying Event(s) can be 
focused to prepare and validate the specific tasking requirements. If certification occurs in 
multiple events, enter the name and date of the last event into the FE availability assessment. 
MAJCOMs outline specific Certifying Event requirements and will determine if and how 
Certification Events will be performed for any FEs that exist outside of the 4-phase generation 
cycle. (T-2) FEs adhere to the MAJCOM policy based on where their FE assessment authority 
(i.e., owning wg/cc) is assigned. 
10.2.3.  FE availability assessments and Certifying Event(s) conducted in the CERTIFY phase 
are only valid for the CERTIFY and AVAILABLE to COMMIT phases. (T-1) They are only 
relevant to the current force generation cycle and will reset to “No” once the respective FE 
enters the RESET phase, regardless of whether the FE was tasked during the previous phases 
or not. (T-1) 
10.3.  Indicating Readiness and Availability Limitations.  Anytime a FE is assessed (readiness 
or availability) as less than a “Yes”, the assessor is required to describe both how and why the FE 
is limited, by selecting from the most appropriate option. (T-1) 
10.3.1.  When describing how a FE is limited from achieving a “Yes” rating, assessors should 
select the most appropriate of the following: capability, capacity, duration, or response time. 
10.3.1.1.  Capability is defined as the ability to perform the task. 
10.3.1.2.  Capacity is defined as the volume or extent to which the task can be performed. 
10.3.1.3.  Duration is defined as the ability to accomplish a task for specific duration or 
timescale. 
10.3.1.4.  Response Time is defined as the ability to generate the capability in an expected 
amount of time. 
10.3.2.  Once it has been determined how the FE is limited, assessors should indicate why those 
limitations exist by selecting the most appropriate of the following: personnel, training, 
equipment available, or equipment condition. 
10.3.3.  Get Well Date (GWD). Enter the date for when that FE is expected to be able to recover 
from the limitations noted and achieve a “Yes” rating. 
10.3.4.  Remarks. Remarks should be written to be understood by a wide range of consumers 
and are required anytime a FE is rated (readiness or availability) as less than “Yes”. Each 
comment should stand on its own content and should have appropriate classification portion 
markings. Remarks should be formatted utilizing BLUF, ISSUE, IMPACT, FIX ACTION 
headers (no hash marks) and align with and expound on the capability limitation categories 
that were previously selected. The use of ‘copy’ and ‘paste’ functions should be limited. 
10.4.  Force Element Construct.  A FE assessment will be based on the assigned UTC 
assessments as reported on in DCAPES UTA. If FE Assessment Authorities discover a 
discrepancy of the FE UTCs, contact the MAJCOM GFM office or MAJCOM UTA manager to 
ensure discrepancies of the FE construct are corrected in DCAPES.

Chapter 11 
INSTALLATION CAPABILITY ASSESSMENTS 
11.1.  Compliance.  DoDI 7730.66 and CJCSI 3401.02B outline reporting criteria for installation 
capability assessments. All institutional organizations involved in force generation or support of 
operational forces will report readiness in DRRS to execute their core and assigned missions. (T-1) 
11.2.  Frequency.  Installation capability assessments are conducted quarterly between the 1st and 
15th of March, June, September, and December. (T-1) Units must perform additional assessments 
within 24 hours of any event that significantly changes the installation status. (T-1) Significant 
changes that require updates include an operational incident, natural disaster, climate, or extreme 
weather event affecting the ability of the organization, unit, or element to deploy or execute its 
designed or assigned mission(s). 
11.3.  Completing the Assessment.  For Air Force installations that have an installation UIC 
generated in DRRS, (UIC ending with the letter ‘I’) the installation METL will be reported on 
installation UIC by the responsible Air Force unit. (T-1) In the event the installation does not have 
an installation UIC generated, the installation METL will be reported on the host unit UIC. (T-1) 
11.3.1.  Installations with organizations assigned to multiple MAJCOMs will have the lead 
organization or host wing designated commander complete the overall assessment with inputs 
from all applicable measured units who report on the installation METL. (T-2) 
11.3.2.  In the case of joint base/installations, when the Air Force is designated as the lead 
service for the joint base/installation, the host Air Force unit will report the installation METL 
and coordinate with service partners to create a comprehensive installation assessment in 
DRRS (T-2) 
11.3.3.  When the Air Force is not the designated lead service at a joint base/installation, the 
Air Force units that support installation MET functions will only assess the capabilities they 
provide for the installation. (T-2) If applicable, they will coordinate with the lead service host 
organization to create a comprehensive installation assessment in DRRS. (T-2) 
11.3.4.  For installations that assess ‘range operations’ or ‘airfield operations’ and are 
responsible for more than one range/airfield, provide a separate set of remarks for each that 
includes the name of the range/airfield being sure to list the name of range/airfield in its 
respective BLUF section. 
11.4.  Mandatory Reporting Areas.  Installations will report on the following capabilities: 
airfield operations, port operations, range operations, munitions supply, storage and distribution, 
and billeting capacity. (T-1) Installation METLs may have additional tasks as determined by 
MAJCOM staff if such tasks inform key mission infrastructure. 
11.5.  Consideration Guidance.  When accomplishing installation MET assessments consider the 
following: new encroachment concerns or environmental impacts, natural disasters affecting 
installation operations for over 24 hours, legislative changes impacting training capabilities, or 
infrastructure degradation or failing due to funding. 
 
 
50

COMMAND MISSION CAPABILITY ASSESSMENTS 
12.1.  Compliance.  Services must provide command mission capability assessments and meet the 
minimum reporting criteria outlined in CJCSI 3401.01E, Joint Combat Capability Assessment, and 
this instruction. (T-1) 
12.2.  Frequency.  MAJCOMs conduct command mission capability assessments quarterly 
between the 15th and 20th of March, June, September, and December. (T-1) MAJCOMs must 
accomplish additional assessments within 24 hours of any event that significantly changes the 
MAJCOMs status. (T-1) Significant changes that require updates include an operational incident, 
natural disaster, climate, or extreme weather event affecting the ability of the organization, unit, 
or element to deploy or execute its designed or assigned mission(s). 
12.3.  Air Force Component METL.  When required by supported commanders, Air Force 
components will use all or a portion of the tasks in the core METL as a basis for the Named 
Operation(s) or Top Priority Plan(s) Mission Assessments. (T-1) Task conditions and standards 
should be tailored to the specific Named Operation or Top Priority Plan. These METLs generally 
consist of tasks at the operational or strategic theater level but can include tasks at other levels if 
necessary. It is recommended to utilize task linking, when possible, to fully inform the assessment. 
12.3.1.  Air Force component headquarters, component MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM) or 
component numbered Air Force (C-NAF) will develop METL(s) derived from the CCMD joint 
METL(s) (JMETLs) that include tasks the Air Force provides in support of the CCMD JMETL. 
(T-1) All MAJCOMS will assess their ability to accomplish METs in a variety of missions 
(i.e., core, OPLANS, Named Operations, etc.). (T-1)  
12.3.2.  Components will conduct a mission analysis of the capabilities the Air Force provides 
to the CCMD and develop/report a mission assessment for Named Operation(s) and Top 
Priority Plan(s). (T-2)  
12.3.3.  Non-Component MAJCOMs will develop command METLs which encompass 
capabilities for which they are designed and organized to perform. (T-1) 
12.3.4.  HAF/MAJCOM FAMs will use command linking feature in DRRS to tie unit MET 
assessments to command METs to the max extent possible, where applicable. (T-2) Use of 
linking increases informational awareness and provides direct review of contributing tasks to 
the command capability.
