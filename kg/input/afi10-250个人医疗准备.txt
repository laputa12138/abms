This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness.  This Air Force 
instruction (AFI) applies to uniformed members of the Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve and 
Air National Guard except as specifically stated.  It does not apply to uniformed members who: 
have not completed initial active duty training or follow-on technical training (Air Force 
specialty code-granting training); are in the Individual Ready Reserve; are deemed unavailable 
for deployment, such as Reserve Officer Training Corps cadre, students in deferred training 
status, and recruiters; or are assigned to geographically separated units (GSUs).  This instruction 
does not apply to civilian employees.  This Instruction requires the collection and or maintenance 
of information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (Title 5, United States Code Section 552a) 
and authorized by Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5400.11, DoD Privacy and Civil 
Liberties Programs. This instruction also requires the collection and or maintenance of 
information both protected and authorized by Public Law 104-91, Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996. The applicable System of Records Notice(s) [number and title] 
is (are) available at: http://dpclo.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx.  Ensure that all records 
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with 
AFI 33-322, Records Management and Information Governance Program, and disposed of in 
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located in the Air Force Records 
Information Management System.  Refer recommended changes and questions about this 
publication to the office of primary responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force (AF) Form 847, 
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the 
appropriate functional chain of command. This publication may be supplemented at any level, 
but all direct supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to 
certification and approval. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this

AFI10-250  22 JULY 2020 
publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance 
statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description of the 
authorities associated with the Tier numbers.  Submit requests for waivers through the chain of 
command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the requestor’s 
commander for non-tiered compliance items. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This document has been substantially revised and needs to be completely reviewed.  This 
instruction eliminates Air Force individual medical readiness categories of fully mission capable, 
partially mission capable, and not mission capable.  It links Air Force individual medical 
readiness metrics and goals to Department of Defense Instruction 6025.19, Individual Medical 
Readiness (IMR).  It realigns responsibilities previously assigned to force health management to 
the base operational medicine clinic.  It removes references to unit health monitor, and updates 
the reference for required immunizations.
