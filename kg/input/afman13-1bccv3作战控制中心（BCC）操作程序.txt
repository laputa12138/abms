BATTLE CONTROL CENTER OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Overview.  This manual describes the Battle Control Center (BCC), the tactical level 
command and control (C2) node that conducts defensive counterair operations in the North 
American 
Aerospace 
Defense 
Command/United 
States 
Northern 
Command 
(NORAD/USNORTHCOM) and INDOPACOM areas of responsibility.  Headquarters Air 
Combat Command (HQ ACC) organizes, trains, and equips the units within the Continental 
United States (CONUS).  Headquarters Pacific Air Forces (HQ PACAF) organizes, trains, and 
equips units that operate the BCC within Alaska, Hawaii and Guam, and the theater air control 
system (TACS) units that operate fixed sites within the Republic of Korea and Japan. 
1.2.  Threat Environment.  America and our deployed forces confront a greater diversity of 
threats and challenges than ever before.  While the traditional, strategic threat to our deployed 
forces and Homeland remains, terrorist and asymmetric threats have become preeminent.  In 
addition to long-range military strategic aviation, commercial aircraft (e.g., airliners, charter, 
cargo, and business jets), general aviation aircraft, unconventional aircraft (e.g., crop dusters, 
unmanned aerial vehicles, and ultralights), and cruise missiles (.i.e., both air and sea launched) 
have been included in the overall threat profile. 
1.3.  Purpose. 
1.3.1.  This manual standardizes the structure, functions, and responsibilities for each of the 
ACC and PACAF units listed below.

equipped with the BCC for the Homeland Defense mission.  The Sector Commanders are 
responsible to the Commander, NORAD/USNORTHCOM through the Commander, CONUS 
NORAD Region (CONR)/Air Forces NORTHERN (AFNORTH) for air sovereignty and 
aerospace control during peacetime and air superiority during wartime.  Where Air Force 
Specialty Codes (AFSC) are annotated, the Canadian Forces equivalent is implied. 
1.3.3.  Alaskan Battle Control Center (ABCC).  The ABCC is responsible to the 
NORAD/NORTHCOM Commander through the Alaska NORAD Region (ANR) 
Commander for homeland defense, air defense, air sovereignty, and aerospace warning and 
control of their assigned area of operation.  Where AFSCs are annotated, the Canadian 
Forces equivalent is implied. 
1.3.4.  Hawaii Battle Control Center/Pacific Air Defense Sector (PADS).  The PADS is 
responsible to the INDOPACOM commander through the area air defense commander 
(AADC) for homeland defense, air defense, air sovereignty, and aerospace control and 
warning of their assigned area of operation. 
1.3.5.  United States Air Force (USAF) TACS elements in Korea are responsible to the 7th

resources (e.g., training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower). 
1.5.2.2.3.  Time period or circumstance for which the waiver is required.  (T-2) 
1.5.2.2.4.  Risk mitigation measures the requesting CC implements during the waiver 
period.  (T-2) 
1.5.2.2.5.  Impact if waiver is disapproved.  (T-2) 
1.5.2.2.6.  Approved waivers will be uploaded into the unit's management internal 
control toolset for inspection activity review and publication OPR's situational 
awareness/filing.  (T-2) 
1.5.3.  PACAF/A3/6CX and NGB/A3Y will forward a copy of all approved waivers for their 
units to ACC/A3C.  ACC/A3C will, in turn, forward a copy of all approved waivers for their 
units to PACAF/A3/6CX, NGB/A3Y, and AF/A3O-CS.  Units will forward all approved 
waivers and report all deviations, or exceptions without waiver, through their chain of 
command, to MAJCOM OPR.  (T-2) 
1.5.4.  Duration of waivers may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver 
period or 30 calendar days after the approving CC’s tour length, whichever is shorter. 
1.5.5.  File a copy of approved written waivers with this volume IAW DAFI 33-360.

Chapter 2 
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES (CONUS) BATTLE CONTROL CENTER (BCC) 
2.1.  Mission.  The CONUS NORAD Region (CONR) has been subdivided into two geographic 
air defense sectors, Eastern Air Defense Sector and Western Air Defense Sector (EADS and 
WADS respectively).  Tactical execution of defensive counterair, support to counterdrug 
operations and homeland security is the responsibility of the units that operate the respective 
BCCs.  The BCCs fuse sensor data and additional information into a common tactical air picture 
and distribute the air picture to the 601 AOC and the NORAD/USNORTHCOM Command 
Center.  EADS and WADS maintain the capability to assume the mission essential operational 
functions of the other sector, commonly called expansion operations.  Note: The National 
Military Command Center and interagency partners responsible for homeland security at the 
National Capital Region Coordination Center, though outside the chain of command of the 
BCCs, also receive the tactical air picture. 
2.2.  Battle Staff (BS). 
2.2.1.  The BS is complementary to the BCC mission crew and functions as operations tempo 
dictates.  It provides both operational and unit level administrative support to the mission 
crew.  Members of the BS are not separate personnel authorizations.  The BS is composed of 
members from the operations, mission support and CC’s staff.  The unit CC may form the BS 
as necessary due to changes in the threat or directed missions from higher headquarters 
(HHQ).  The BS may be activated for an indefinite period of time.  When the BS is fully 
formed, the commander assumes overall responsibility for the unit’s activities and determines 
which responsibilities are assumed by the BS and which remain with the mission crew. 
2.2.2.  BS Composition.  The commander, based on the mission tasking, may tailor the BS. 
The CC may also tailor and selectively man positions within the BS for specific operations. 
2.2.3.  The BS normally consists of the CC and/or director of operations (DO), intelligence 
officer, battle management superintendent (BMS) and the communications focal point (CFP). 
The commander adds additional personnel as the operational mission and support activities 
dictate. 
2.2.3.1.  CC.  The commander is responsible to the 601 AOC for the unit’s overall 
execution of the mission, directing, managing, and supervising the mission crew and the 
supporting work centers.  In the absence of the CC, the designated battle commander 
(BC) assumes the duties. 
2.2.3.2.  DO.  In addition to assuming the role of BC when required, the DO is 
responsible for providing AOC direction to the mission crew. 
2.2.3.3.  Intelligence Officer/Non-commissioned Officer (IN).  The IN is responsible for 
receiving operational intelligence assessments and intelligence data and providing tactical 
intelligence updates to the BS and the mission crew.  The IN also coordinates with HHQ 
intelligence sources. 
2.2.3.4.  Battle Management Superintendent (BMS).  The BMS assists in managing the 
unit’s activities, facilitating the interaction between the BS, mission crew and mission 
support functions. 
10 
AFMAN13-1BCCV3  20 OCTOBER 2020 
2.2.3.5.  Communications Focal Point (CFP).  The CFP is a consolidation of all support 
activities within the BCC.  The CFP functions in direct support of the unit's operational 
mission and includes, but is not limited to, maintenance control, telephone administration 
desk, and traditional network help desk.  The CFP collects data from internal and external 
sources (such as unit work centers, the Defense Information Systems Agency, and Air 
Force Network Operations).  In addition, the CFP monitors and coordinates scheduled 
and unscheduled maintenance, maintaining visibility of equipment and systems metrics 
and indicators. 
2.3.  Battle Control Center Mission Crew Function.  The BCC mission crew performs the 
functions of battle management, weapons control, surveillance, identification, tactical data link 
operations and management and track reporting.  The mission crew also provides airspace 
management. 
2.4.  Battle Control Center (BCC) Mission Crew Composition.  The BCC mission crew is the 
focal point for operations.  Supervised by a mission crew commander (MCC), the mission crew 
is tasked to execute the mission on a continuous basis and is manned by a number of personnel, 
tailored to meet mission requirements.  Some duty positions serve as prerequisites to others and 
these prerequisites are located AFMAN 13-1BCC Volume 1, Battle Control Center Training.  
The mission crew will consist of the duty positions identified in Figure 2.1 as described in the 
following sections.  (T-2)  Additionally, the mission crew may have personnel certified to 
augment and assist the battle management, weapons, and tactical data links functional areas.  See 
paragraph 2.9 for certification positions.
