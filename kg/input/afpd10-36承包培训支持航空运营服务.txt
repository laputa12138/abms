This publication is consistent with Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 1322.18, Military 
Training, and Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 11-4, Aviation Service, for contracted 
operational air services for training support necessary to maintain mission qualification and 
continuation training.  This directive establishes policy for Air Force (AF) contracted aircraft 
operations for training support, and assigns roles and responsibilities to support the planning and 
procurement of contracted operational air services, including the sponsorship of contracted air 
services procured by foreign governments.  This policy directive applies to all civilian employees 
of the AF and uniformed members of the Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve, Air National 
Guard, and contractors to the extent required by the applicable contract.  This publication does not 
apply to members assigned to the Air Education and Training Command, the Air Force Test 
Center, or United States Space Force (USSF).  Refer recommended changes and questions about 
this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, 
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This rewrite of AFPD 10-36 changes the responsible government official who has the authority to 
designate contractor-owned civil aircraft to operate as state aircraft outside the National Airspace 
System (NAS) from the Secretary of the Air Force to the Major Command Commander 
(MAJCOM/CC). 
 
 
AFPD10-36  7 FEBRUARY 2022

1.  Overview. 
1.1.  During the process of planning or supporting procurement of contracted operational air 
services for training support, including the sponsorship of contracted air services procured by 
foreign governments, factors such as proper aircraft airworthiness, aircraft status (civil, public, 
or state), aircrew qualification, safety, maintenance, and liability are vital to consider. 
1.2.  Air support for training may be contracted when available organic AF assets are 
insufficient to meet all Special Warfare Airmen and aircrew training requirements to maintain 
combat mission readiness.  Contracts for air operational support for training shall be consistent 
with this AFPD. 
2.  Policy. 
2.1.  Within the NAS, aircraft contracted by the Department of Defense (DoD) or a foreign 
government sponsored by an AF organization for training support shall operate in compliance 
with Federal Aviation Administration, range, and local operating regulations and procedures. 
2.2.  A contracted aircraft may require an assessment for airworthiness in accordance with 
AFPD 62-6, USAF Airworthiness. 
2.3.  Contracted aviation services shall meet the requirements defined in Defense Contract 
Management Agency Instruction (DCMAI) 8210.1/AFI 10-220_IP, Contractor’s Flight and 
Ground Operations. 
2.4.  For flights within the NAS, contracts shall require contractors to operate their aircraft in 
civil aircraft status unless the operations qualify for public aircraft status, and are specifically 
designated and declared as public aircraft by the AF.  Contracts shall require contractors to 
comply with applicable Federal Aviation Administration regulations and guidance for 
designated qualified flights including preflight filing requirements. 
2.5.  For flights outside of the NAS, contracts shall require contractors to operate their aircraft 
in civil aircraft status unless, in rare circumstances, a responsible government official approves 
contracted state aircraft operations and authorized officials designate and declare the particular 
aircraft for operation in state aircraft status. 
2.5.1.  The MAJCOM/CC is the responsible AF official with the authority to designate 
contractor-owned civil aircraft to operate as state aircraft outside the NAS.  The 
MAJCOM/CC may delegate this authority to no lower than the Deputy Commander. 
2.5.2.  Procedures for approving, designating, declaring, and conducting state aircraft 
operations are defined in the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide’s General Volume, 
(https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg.cfm). 
2.5.3.  A contractor shall not operate in state status without written designation by a 
responsible government official specifying state aircraft status for that particular aircraft 
and operation outside the NAS, even if the same contractor aircraft has been designated as 
a public aircraft for operations within the NAS. 
2.5.4.  AF personnel shall consult DoDD 4500.54E, DoD Foreign Clearance Program, 
and the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide, in particular the DoD Commercial Contract 
Aircraft Appendix to obtain procedural guidance regarding operations outside of the NAS.

AFPD10-36  7 FEBRUARY 2022 
2.6.  When the AF designates and declares contracted flights as Public Aircraft Operations 
(PAO) within the NAS, the AF becomes responsible for airworthiness, authorization of 
operations, oversight of the particular operation, oversight of maintenance procedures, and 
verification of aircrew qualifications and training.  The AF may also become responsible for 
safety and accident investigations as described in Title 49 United States Code (USC) § 1132. 
3.  Roles and Responsibilities. 
3.1.  The  Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations (AF/A3) shall:  
3.1.1.  Develop policy for the use of contracted operational air services for training support. 
3.1.2.  Develop guidance to establish specific requirements for contracted aircraft for 
training support. 
3.1.3.  Provide applicable Department of the Air Force oversight of PAO on behalf of the 
USSF Chief Operations Officer (COO) for training support to USSF Field Commands, as 
requested by the USSF COO. 
3.1.4.  Execute SECAF responsibilities flowing from DoDD 4500.54E which relate to the 
designation of contractor aircraft as state aircraft. 
3.2.  The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics 
(SAF/AQ) through the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Combat and Mission 
Support (AFPEO/CM) shall:

with AF/A3 requirements. 
3.3.3.  In conjunction with legal counsel, evaluate the costs and benefits associated with 
the potential use of Civil Aircraft Operations (CAO) after determining whether or not the 
use of contractor aircraft in public or state aircraft status is a legally available option. 
3.3.4.  Designate and declare flights within their contracted aircraft portfolios as PAO, 
when appropriate, in accordance with 49 USC §§ 40102(a)(41) and 40125.
