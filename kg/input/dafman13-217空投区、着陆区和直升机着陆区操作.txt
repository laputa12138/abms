Chapter 1 
OVERVIEW 
1.1 Purpose. This manual establishes AF/A3S as the DAF proponent for assault zones, to include 
DZs, LZs, HLZs, LC-130 skiways and ski landing areas. It provides administrative, management, 
and operational guidance for DAF and subordinate command assault zone surveys, operations, and 
training to standardize procedures, increase mission effectiveness and safety, and ensure 
compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) activity and mishap reporting requirements. Use 
this publication in conjunction with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 11-2 Mission Design Series 
(MDS) publications and applicable DoD, United States Air Force (USAF), and MAJCOM 
instructions and directives. For the purposes of this document and consistent with AF doctrine, the 
term “Air Component Commander” is used to refer to either the Commander of Air Force Forces 
or the Commander of Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF) as applicable based on 
who has OPCON of the DAF forces to which this manual applies. 
1.2.  International 
Agreements.  The 
AF 
implements 
certain 
international 
military 
standardization agreements, to include North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
Standardization Agreement (STANAG). NATO STANAGS are standardization documents that 
specify the agreement of member nations to implement a standard, in whole or in part, with or 
without reservations, in order to meet an interoperability requirement.  This manual addresses 
standards to include, but not limited to: STANAG 3344, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for 
NATO Airborne Operations; STANAG 3345, Data/Forms for Planning Air Movements; and 
STANAG 3570, Drop Zones and Extraction Zones - Criteria and Markings. This manual assists to 
establish international standardization agreements. 
1.3.  Deviations.  Do not deviate from the guidance in this DAFMAN without an approved waiver 
except when the situation requires immediate action to ensure safety. Units will report deviations 
to the MAJCOM or Air Component Stan/Eval office or functional equivalent, with Operational 
Control (OPCON) of the asset which conducted the deviation. MAJCOM, Air Component 
Stan/Eval office or functional equivalent with OPCON will notify the lead MAJCOM. (T-1). 
Deviations resulting in a class A, B or C mishap, MAJCOMs will also report to AF/A3S at 
AF.A3S.Workflow@us.af.mil. (T-1).  
1.4.  Waivers.  Obtain a waiver if there is a requirement for a known or planned divergence from 
this DAFMAN. MAJCOM/Commanders (CCs) may designate the MAJCOM/Deputy Commander 
(CD) or MAJCOM/A3 as standard waiver authority for the T-1 level depending on the mission 
type.  MAJCOM/CC may designate MAJCOM/CD, MAJCOM/A3, or first General Officer in 
Chain as standard waiver authority for T-2 level depending on the mission type. For the contents 
of this manual, standard waiver authority for T-2 level is the MAJCOM/A3, Air Component 
Commander, or designated authority, but no lower than the first General Officer in the chain of 
command or personnel meeting T-1 delegation authorization. The waiver authority will provide 
AF/A3S electronic copies of approved waivers, and notification upon waiver rescission, at 
AF/A3S at AF.A3S.Workflow@us.af.mil. (T-1). Air Force Special Operations Command 
(AFSOC) crews may utilize standing Tier-2 waivers contained in surveys issued and/or approved 
by other MAJCOM/A3s, Air Component Commanders, or designated authorities. Crews must 
comply with all waiver restrictions and/or risk mitigation requirements. (T-2). Other 
MAJCOM/A3, Air Component Commander, or designated authority may elect to accept Tier-2 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
7 
waivers contained in surveys issued/approved by other MAJCOM/A3s, Air Component 
Commanders, or designated authorities if/as specified in a supplement to this DAFMAN. 
1.5.  Contractor Support and Limitations.  The engagement of contractors in one or more of the 
roles contemplated by this issuance is subject to the limitation that contractors cannot perform 
inherently governmental functions. (T-0). In general, this limitation precludes the use of 
contractors in certain operational contexts. Further, the use of contractors in operations in which 
the law of war applies may run the risk of classification as direct participants in hostilities. 
Commanders are to seek legal advice prior to utilizing contractors in operational contexts.

Chapter 2 
ZONE AVAILABILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
2.1 General. The zone availability management system is utilized by the DoD to request, process, 
and publish zone surveys for operations. This chapter directs access, procedures, requirements, 
and approval for zone use common to DZ, LZ, HLZ, and Forward Arming and Refueling Point 
(FARP) surveys. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of this manual and AFI 11-235, Specialized Fueling 
Operations, direct specific procedures, requirements, and approval for each zone type use 
respectively. Conduct all airdrop, air land, and FARP operations at zones with a valid (approved 
and current) survey or other MAJCOM approved source document unless specifically documented 
in a later chapter of this manual or within AFI 11-235. (T-2). 
2.2.  Database.  The Talon Point database contains worldwide valid DZ, LZ, light tactical fixed 
wing (LTFW) LZ, HLZ, and FARP surveys published for military users. Zone survey publication 
on Talon Point is not a requirement for operations, and valid surveys may be located on local or 
MAJCOM systems. The MAJCOM/A3, Air Component Commander, or designated authority shall 
ensure valid surveys are submitted to Talon Point. (T-1). Exception: Submission of tactical 
surveys and unmarked DZ surveys to Talon Point is not required. NOTE: Talon Point may be 
utilized to conduct survey workflow (submission, quality check, review, and approval or 
disapproval). It is the published FARP survey database, and meets the requirements to conduct 
FARP workflow in accordance with AFI 11-235. For assistance contact AFSOC Weapons and 
Tactics (AFSOC/A3TW) at afsoca3.talonpoint.talonpoint@us.af.mil. 
2.2.1.  UNCLASS Talon Point. Talon Point may be accessed on DoD non-classified internet 
protocol router network (NIPR) and/or civilian internet at https://talonpoint.net and has a 
scalable interface for mobile devices (e.g., smart phone, tablets, portable laptops). To access 
survey data, user must have an authorized account. (T-1). For access and, if required, workflow 
roles (i.e., author, quality control, safety of flight, approver, publisher, and administrator) users 
request accounts via the website or are added by a Talon Point administrator. Administrators 
will review all requests from personnel with a valid government email address and approve or 
deny accounts. (T-2). 
2.2.2.  Secret internet protocol router network (SIPR) Talon Point. Talon Point may be 
accessed on DoD SIPR at https://talonpoint.snlca.nro.smil.mil/TalonPoint/home.  and has 
a scalable interface for mobile devices (e.g., smart phone, tablets, portable laptops). On SIPR, 
a Talon Point account is not needed to access survey data. SIPR Talon Point accounts are only 
needed by users that require workflow roles (i.e., author, quality control, safety of flight, 
approver, publisher, and administrator). Users may request accounts via website or Talon Point 
administrators may establish user accounts. Administrators will review all requests from 
personnel with a valid government email address and approve or deny accounts. (T-2). 
 
 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021

2.3.  Roles and Responsibilities.  Personnel in the roles defined below shall utilize Chapters 2, 3, 
4, and 5 of this manual and AFI 11-235 to identify procedures, requirements, and approval for 
each zone type use. (T-2). Workflow may be conducted via Talon Point or other means. However, 
all FARP workflow is via Talon Point, and AFSOC/A3TW is the FARP approval authority in 
accordance with AFI 11-235. 
2.3.1.  Requesting Units. Requesting units that task or request tasking of zone survey(s) will 
submit zone operation requirements within the task or survey request, to include all potential 
uses and users of the zone (e.g., ground units, flying units, supporting units, and aircraft types). 
(T-2). Requesting units should task at the lowest level internally or submit request for zone 
survey support in accordance with paragraph 2.4 Requesting units will ensure that a survey 
requirement exists, the surveyors receive the complete documented task (or that the complete 
documented task is submitted in the support request), and workflow is conducted by the 
appropriate safety of flight and approval authority. (T-2).  
2.3.2.  Surveyors. Surveyors, (“Authors” on Talon Point), will submit survey(s) and notify 
appropriate quality check (or Ground Operations Approval, AF Form 3823, Drop Zone Survey, 
block 4C) personnel to conduct a review of the survey. (T-3). Surveyors will include the 
received documented task with the survey and submit to quality check (or DZ ground 
operations approval) personnel. (T-2). 
2.3.3.  Quality Check. Quality check personnel (or Ground Operations Approval personnel, 
AF Form 3823 block 4C), shall conduct an analysis of all surveys. (T-2). Personnel must be a 
surveyor for the zone type (not the original surveyor) who will ensure the authored survey is 
complete, accurate, appropriate, and ready for submission to safety of flight. (T-2). Tasked 
units may request an outside unit to conduct the quality check as desired or required. Quality 
check personnel will determine and submit survey to the appropriate safety of flight(s) based 
on the tasking, survey request and/or additional MAJCOMs as required for approval. (T-2). 
2.3.4.  Flight Safety Review. Flight Safety reviewers shall accomplish a survey safety of flight 
review and submit the survey for approval, or reject to appropriate level for changes, within 
60 days of receipt. (T-3). MAJCOMs will assign offices with safety of flight duties. AFSOC 
conducts FARP reviews in accordance with AFI 11-235. 
2.3.5.  Approval Authority. The final approval authority shall accomplish a survey review and 
submit the survey for approval, disapproval, or rejection to appropriate level for changes within 
60 days of receipt. (T-3). MAJCOMs will assign offices with approval duties where 
appropriate. 
2.3.6.  MAJCOMs. MAJCOM/A3, Air Component Commander, or designated authority 
(Publishers, Talon Point) shall publish or submit for publication all approved or disapproved 
surveys in Talon Point. Exception: Tactical surveys and unmarked DZ surveys. 
2.3.7.  Publishers. Publishers may restrict survey access in Talon Point to designated 
organizations or individuals. Publishers should upload approved or disapproved surveys not in 
Talon Point for publication utilizing the by-pass workflow function, or submit a request for 
survey publication to AFSOC/A3TW at afsoca3.talonpoint.talonpoint@us.af.mil. If 
operational requirements dictate use of the survey by Air Mobility Command (AMC) 
publishers will notify AMC Combat Operations (AMC/A3D) that a new survey is listed in 
Talon Point. (T-2).

Chapter 3 
DROP ZONE OPERATIONS 
3.1.  General.  This chapter outlines the basic criteria, markings, and procedures used in support 
of airdrops. It describes the responsibilities of the Drop Zone Controller (DZC), the ground unit's 
Drop Zone Safety Officer (DZSO) if required in addition to the DZC, and the DZ survey process. 
3.1.1.  Airdrop Direction. Aircrew or ground units can direct airdrops. 
3.1.2.  Release Point Identification. Aircrew can utilize visual means or self-contained 
electronic means, or a combination of the two, to identify the release point or launch 
acceptability region. The ground unit can also utilize visual means or organic electronic means, 
or a combination of the two, to identify the release point or launch acceptability region. 
3.1.3.  Release Point Comparison. Regardless of who directs the drop, the aircrew and ground 
unit should compare release point or launch acceptability region calculations prior to the 
airdrop. 
3.2.  Responsibility. 
3.2.1.  Shared Responsibility. The airlift mission commander and ground mission commander 
share responsibility for ensuring that any DZ being considered meets the requirements (e.g., 
size, location, acceptable risk level, type airdrop, type airframe) for the operation. For 
deviations, see paragraph 1.3; for waivers, see paragraph 1.4.  
3.2.1.1.  Both the airlift mission commander and ground mission commander should 
conduct a thorough risk assessment during the mission planning cycle to ensure that 
concerns from either organization can be addressed prior to mission execution.  
3.2.1.2.  The ground mission commander shall be responsible for DZ establishment, 
operation, safety, and for the removal, or acceptance of, ground hazards associated with 
the DZ. (T-0). 
3.2.1.3.  The ground mission commander is normally responsible for airdrop accuracy 
when using GMRS or Verbally Initiated Release System release procedures. The Aircraft 
Commander (AC) shall assume responsibility for airdrop accuracy if the aircrew adjusts 
the release point. (T-0). 
3.2.1.4.  The jumpmaster (JM), performing under the authority of the ground mission 
commander, shall be responsible for airdrop accuracy when using Jumpmaster Directed 
(JMD) release procedures. (T-0).  
3.2.2.  Aircrew Directed Airdrop Responsibility. When performing an aircrew directed 
airdrop, the airlift mission commander is normally responsible for airdrop accuracy and safety 
of flight. Aircrew will conduct an airdrop damage estimate in accordance with MAJCOM 
directives. (T-2). 
3.3.  DZ Criteria.  DZ selection factors include (but are not limited to) enemy threats, mission 
requirements, dispersion, risk of unintended airdrop damage, aircraft capabilities, aircrew 
capabilities, parachutist capabilities, type of parachutes used, type of equipment to be airdropped, 
and load or personnel recoverability. The DZ surface, to the greatest degree possible, should be 
relatively flat, smooth terrain with no obstacles, vegetation or significant terrain features. If 
12 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
obstacles or other potentially hazardous conditions at the time of survey do exist, the surveyor 
must identify them on the DZ survey. (T-2). Existing obstacles should be briefed to all personnel 
prior to use. The ground mission commander and/or jumpmaster must brief obstacles not listed on 
the survey and all hazardous conditions to personnel prior to use. (T-2). All airdrops conducted on 
DZs that do not meet DAF minimum size requirements must have a DZ size waiver in accordance 
with paragraph 1.4. (T-1).

e. For C-130J and C-130H using radar verified airdrop, width adjustments not required if all 
aircraft in the formation are flying their own bomb line. 
Note 3: C-17 DZ width adjustments (more than one may be required):  
a. Day/Night pilot directed formation; increase width by 100 yards/92 meters (50 yards/46 
meters on each side). 
b. SKE formation (Heavy Equipment/CDS); increase width by 400 yards/366 meters (200

c. Personnel formation; minimum DZ basic width using center Points of Impact (PIs) is 1240 
yards for 2-ship elements and 1800 yards for 3-ship elements. When using offset PIs, minimum 
basic width is 1050 yards for 2-ship elements and 1300 yards for 3-ship elements. Drop altitude 
adjustments from chart still apply. 
Note 4: Additional Length Adjustments. (N/A with Personnel Recovery [PR] / Combat Search

OPCON to USSOCOM or to a theater special operations command, and for C-130J/C-17 
Embedded Global Positioning System [GPS]/Inertial Navigation System [EGI] drops.) 
a. Night visual airdrops; increase length by 100 yards/92 meters (50 yards/46 meters on each 
end. 
b. May utilize a safety zone: A distance established by agreement between the airlift mission 
commander and the ground mission commander subtracted from the DZ trailing edge to reduce 
the potential for off-DZ drops. For peacetime personnel airdrops, the safety zone will never be 
less than 200 yards. (T-0). Do not compute safety zone distances for high altitude low opening 
or high altitude high opening airdrops. 
c. USSOCOM and AFSPECWAR personnel may compute 75 meters per additional jumper 
starting from the PI. Example: A 600 yard-long DZ with a center point PI, 5 jumpers may exit. 
Note 5: Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB) airdrops conducted on military reservations 
and/or restricted areas can use standard CDS DZ size criteria. During actual instrument 
meteorological conditions (IMC), follow the standard DZ size criteria for the type of SATB 
airdrop being conducted. For C-130 night/SKE formations conducted during visual 
meteorological conditions (VMC), increase DZ radius by 20 yards.  
Note 6: When multiple aircraft conduct door or ramp bundles during combination drops with 
personnel during formation airdrops to the same PI, the lead aircraft may require DZ be 
extended into the axis of approach in the direction of flight from the following aircraft’s PI. If 
required, this extension should be consecutive for each subsequent combination drop aircraft in 
the same formation. Ensure the extension fits within the survey DZ boundaries. 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021

Note 7: 18 feet platforms: Platform placement on the aircraft, as well as the number of 
platforms actually on board, determines the number of platforms used to calculate the 
minimum size DZ; add the number of empty positions between the actual platforms/pallets 
being dropped to the overall number of pallets. (T-0). For example: One platform in position 
1L and one platform in position 4R would require calculations based on five platforms. 
Note 8: 463L or eight feet training platforms: Minimum DZ size is 1600 yards/1463 meters 
long by 600 yards/549 meters wide for the two or three pallet/platform training configuration. 
Note 9: A DZ survey is not required to have a comment stating that it is approved for Joint 
Precision Airdrop System (JPADS). However, if the survey has been reviewed and approved 
for JPADS use prior to being published on the survey database, a comment can be added to the 
block 11 remarks of the AF Form 3823 stating approval for JPADS and PI location. Refer to 
paragraph 3.3.5 for additional restrictions and requirements.

Note 1: For lateral placement, the PI must be located no closer than one-half the width of the 
minimum size DZ (based upon type of airdrop and airdrop formation) from the nearest side of 
the DZ. (T-3). Offset PI will be in accordance with paragraph 3.3.12. (T-3). 
Note 2: The PI may be located anywhere within the surveyed DZ boundaries as long as the 
minimum required DZ size for that type airdrop and airdrop formation fits within the 
boundaries and provided the distance from the leading edge and sides is complied with. All 
participants must be briefed when using this option. (T-1). 
Note 3: DZC must relay all PI coordinates, if different than surveyed or pre-coordinated, to the 
aircrew NLT 15 minutes prior to time on/over target (TOT). (T-3). If PI coordinates are not 
relayed 15 minutes prior, aircrew will advise earliest TOT feasible for new coordinates. (T-3). 
3.3.1.  Water DZ. Water DZs are normally circular and should meet the minimum size criteria 
listed in Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1 Water DZs may be marked or unmarked. Additional 
restrictions will be at the discretion of the supported unit using the Water DZ. (T-2). Parachutist 
flotation requirements are specified in ATP 3-18.11, Special Forces Military Free-Fall 
16 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
Operations, TC 18-11, Special Forces Double-Bag Static Line Operations, and AFMAN 11-
420. Minimum safety boat and swimmer requirements during intentional water drops are 
specified in AFI 10-3503. 
3.3.1.1.  DZ water depth will be a minimum of ten feet, and the area must be free of 
underwater obstructions to that depth. (T-2). The DZ should be free of floating debris, 
moored craft, protruding boulders, stumps, pilings, or other hazards within 440 yards/400 
meters of the DZ center point. 
3.3.1.2.  The DZ should not be located near swift currents. For personnel drops, the current 
limits are at the discretion of the JM and should not exceed two knots. 
3.3.1.3.  Sea state limits are based on the ability of recovery assets to quickly locate and 
recover jumpers and their equipment. Sea state limits are at the discretion of the JM. (T-
2). See Attachment 2 for wind and sea state observation chart. 
3.3.2.  Tactical DZ. A tactical DZ is a DZ that is approved for use in an abbreviated or 
expeditious manner primarily intended to support emerging mission requirements during 
contingencies or exercises. Tactical DZs are normally restricted to exercise or contingency 
missions supporting resupply and personnel infiltration airdrops (versus proficiency jumps, 
routine training, etc.). Tactical DZ surveys are processed and approved in an abbreviated 
manner, do not require an AF Form 3823 to be physically signed, and may be passed 
electronically and/or verbally. Tactical DZs normally require a physical inspection of the DZ 
by the ground mission unit and a safety of flight review. However, computer-based mapping 
tools, imagery analysis, and other standoff tools may be used during exercise or contingency 
operations when tactical conditions do not permit the ground mission unit to physically occupy 
the DZ area to collect survey data. 
3.3.2.1.  Tactical DZ surveys may be required to support highly mobile ground forces. For 
training operations where tactical DZs are both surveyed and controlled by DZC-certified 
AFSPECWAR personnel, Group/CC or O-6 equivalent or higher with authority over 
aviation missions or assets may approve the use of training tactical DZs for the duration of 
the training operation. 
3.3.2.2.  The mode of delivery, load dispersal, and air item recoverability and load 
survivability discussion with the ground mission commander determines the tactical DZ 
size. NOTE: Do not use tactical DZs for routine operations. (T-1). Complete a standard 
DZ survey for recurring operations not covered in paragraph 3.3.2. (T-1). If a tactical DZ 
survey is done to meet new run-in axis requirements on an existing survey, then only a 
safety-of-flight review is required. MAJCOMs may define the minimum information 
and/or format for a tactical DZ survey. Recommended minimum information, (mission and 
tactical considerations may deviate) is located in figure A4.1 to include blocks 1A, 2A, 
2B, 4D, 6A-B or C, 7, 9, and 11 as applicable. 
3.3.3.  Military Free Fall (MFF) DZ (including operations utilizing MFF systems in a Double 
Bag Static Line (DBSL) configuration). The JM will determine the minimum size DZ based 
on the number of personnel to be dropped, jumper proficiency, parachute system being used, 
and the prevailing winds. (T-3). For MFF training operations a minimum DZ size of 55 
yards/50 meters by 110 yards/100 meters (rectangular) or 55 yards/50 meters radius (circular) 
is recommended. See paragraph 3.16.1.1 for parachute demonstration DZ. 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
17 
3.3.4.  Unmarked land DZ. Unmarked land DZs are not authenticated with any type of visual 
or electronic marking. Unmarked DZs are normally used for contingency operations and 
austere polar environments and may or may not have a DZ party present. All participants 
involved in an unmarked drop operation will be thoroughly briefed. (T-3). 
3.3.4.1.  Aircrew/Aircraft/Flying Unit Restrictions. 109th Air Wing (AW) aircraft, 
PR/CSAR assigned or gained aircraft, AFSOC assigned or gained aircraft, aircraft OPCON 
to USSOCOM or to a theater special operation command may utilize unmarked land DZs 
for training, exercises, and operations without a waiver. All other aircrew/flying units 
require a waiver in accordance with paragraph 1.4 prior to conducting unmarked land DZ 
airdrops during training and exercises. During contingency operations, the OPCON 
MAJCOM/A3, Air Component Commander, or designated authority will evaluate the risks 
associated with DZ verification and airdrop accuracy prior to approving non-special 
operations forces to conduct unmarked land DZ operations. 
3.3.4.2.  Airdrop Personnel/Ground Personnel Restrictions. For training and exercise 
missions, only DZC-certified AFSPECWAR personnel; survival, evasion, resistance, and 
escape (SERE) specialists; USSOCOM assigned forces; and 109th AW personnel are 
authorized to control unmarked land DZs. For training and exercise missions, a DZC party 
must be on site for safety. (T-2). Exception: Austere polar DZs do not require a DZC party 
for training or exercises. All other DZC-certified personnel will require a waiver for 
unmarked training and exercise missions. (T-2). During contingency operations, the 
ground forces commander should evaluate the risks associated with airdrop accuracy and 
injury or damage to personnel and equipment prior to approving unmarked DZ operations 
with MAJCOM/A3, Air Component Commander, or designated authority concurrence. 
During training, drops conducted to austere polar DZs are typically unmanned and 
unmarked and do not require a DZC or two-way communications drop clearance. Crews 
will visually clear the DZ to the maximum extent possible. (T-2). 
3.3.5.  Joint Precision Airdrop System/Improved Container Delivery System DZ. JPADS 
refers to both GPS guided systems and traditional ballistic airdrop loads utilizing the 
consolidated airdrop tool or approved programs for more precisely computed release points. 
Prior to airdrop operations, complete and approve JPADS and Improved Container Release 
System (I-CDS) DZ surveys independent of the Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE). For JPADS 
and I-CDS training drops, file a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) for all high-altitude airdrops. (T-
2). The NOTAM airspace must be no smaller than the diameter of the largest failure footprint 
ellipse for the highest drop altitude. (T-2). The minimum altitude for training is 3,500 feet 
above ground level (AGL). 
3.3.5.1.  JPADS (guided systems) DZs are primarily circular, with the PI at the center. If a 
circular DZ survey does not exist, rectangular DZs may be used if applicable circular DZ 
requirements are met within the boundaries of the rectangular DZ. In this case, for the PI 
use the centerpoint of the rectangular DZ (or as close as possible). When using a centerpoint 
of a rectangular DZ, be sure to use the actual elevation. Many DZ surveys do not list the 
centerpoint elevation, they only list elevation for CDS PI, Heavy Equipment PI, Personnel 
PI, and highest. Using one of those four elevations for the JPADS center point is 
unacceptable. Use alternate means to acquire the true DZ centerpoint elevation. It is critical 
to both plan the mission and program the JPADS Autonomous Guidance Unit with the 
correct elevation. 
18 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
3.3.5.1.1.  During training operations, limit GPS guided system drops to DZs located 
in restricted areas and airspace to include all space between load exit and the planned 
landing PI. The aircrew or flying unit must complete a thorough ADE. (T-2). Waivers 
to the airspace criteria are in accordance with paragraph 1.4.  
3.3.5.1.2.  During contingency operations, the ground mission commander will 
determine the JPADS (guided systems) minimum DZ size with the advisement of the 
airlift mission commander, using Table 3.1 as a starting reference. (T-0). Locate the 
JPADS DZ and Launch Acceptability Region (LAR) within a restricted operating zone. 
Select the JPADS DZs to guarantee that all bundles land within the confines of the 
restricted operation zone to the maximum extent possible. (T-2). 
3.3.5.2.  I-CDS DZs are typically normal rectangular CDS and/or High Velocity Container 
Delivery System (HVCDS) DZs in accordance with Table 3.1 However, unlike traditional 
CDS, I-CDS provides the ability to “target” a specific bundle for PI impact. For circular 
DZs, it may be appropriate to target the middle bundle in a stick. For all I-CDS airdrops, 
there is no minimum DZ requirement, but crews will ensure that the ADE, including the 
failed chute ellipse, fits within the surveyed DZ boundaries. (T-2). 
3.3.5.3.  In accordance with MAJCOM/A3 or Air Component Commander guidance, 
aircrew must complete an ADE prior to each JPADS (guided systems) and I-CDS airdrop 
operation. (T-2). Complete a new ADE when time or airdrop conditions have changed to 
create a likelihood of inaccuracy in the previously accomplished ADE. (T-2). Advise the 
ground mission commander on ADE determinations. (T-2). For contingency operations, 
an agency designated by the Joint Forces Commander may be the approving authority for 
risk to the areas surrounding the DZ. 
3.3.6.  Random Approach DZ. All approved rectangular DZs are random approach DZs unless 
block 11, remarks, of the AF Form 3823 specifically restricts it, or for safety reasons; random 
approaches may be used if the airdrop profile requirements can be met within the existing 
confines of the DZ to permit multiple run-in headings to an alternate PI established during 
mission coordination. Refer to Table 3.2 and Figure 3.1 Use of a DZ for random approaches 
does not require a separate survey, but a safety of flight review must be conducted prior to use. 
(T-2). Surveyors and reviewers are encouraged to include random approach axis data, 
applicable altitude parameters, and alternate PI locations on the published survey to enhance 
flexibility for recurring operations. 
3.3.7.  Circular DZ. The PI of a circular DZ is normally at the DZ center to allow for multiple 
run-in headings. For specific missions, the PI location may be adjusted to allow for sequential 
HE or mass CDS, on circular DZs. Refer to Figure 3.1, option 2 for PI placement. Utilizing a 
PI not at the center of the circular DZ may limit the run-in heading to only one direction. When 
dropping mass CDS to a center point PI, aircrews may target the sticks middle bundle to the 
center point. The minimum DZ dimensions for the type and number of loads being dropped 
must completely fit into the surveyed circular DZs. (T-2). For both types of PI placement, use 
Figure 3.1 to determine the number of jumpers per pass. 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021

Figure 3.1.  Circular DZ Computation. 
 
3.3.8.  Area DZ. Area DZs are not applicable to C-17 and C-130 operations except Special 
Operations Low Level II qualified crews and AFSOC aircrews. An area DZ consists of a start 
point (point A), an endpoint (point B), and a pre-arranged flight path (line-of-flight) over a 
series of acceptable drop sites between these points, as shown in Figure 3.2 The distance 
between points A and B generally should not exceed 15 Nautical Miles (NM) and changes in 
ground elevation within ½ NM of centerline should not exceed 300 feet. The reception 
committee may receive the drop at any location between point A and point B within ½ NM of 
centerline. Perform the airdrop once the pre-briefed signal or electronic Navigational Aids 
(NAVAID) has been identified and located. (T-3). 
Figure 3.2.  Area DZ.

DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
3.3.9.  Dropsondes. Dropsondes do not have a minimum DZ size and are deliberately and 
manually released from the aircraft to gather meteorological data for follow-on operations. 
Sonde drops are required prior to certain I-CDS drops. When dropping JPADS, dropsondes 
are not required. However, when dropping near the edge of the Launch Acceptability Region 
(LAR) or in strong and/or variable wind conditions, dropping a dropsonde is strongly 
recommended to improve the drop solution and reduce risk. Drop clearance will be required 
for all sonde releases. (T-2). Exception: USAF Precision Jumpmaster moving target 
operations. (T-2). 
3.3.9.1.  During training and exercise operations, aircrews and jumpmasters ensure that the 
sonde will land on the DZ or within a restricted area to avoid airdrop damage and to aid 
recovery of the sonde. (T-2). Aircrews and jumpmasters will ensure landing location 
coordinate reporting and recoverability are in accordance with MAJCOM guidance. (T-2). 
3.3.9.2.  During contingency operations, dropsondes may be released anywhere in the 
vicinity of the objective area and do not have to land on the DZ. Ground mission 
commander’s and airlift mission commander’s must take appropriate measures to ensure 
dropsondes will not exceed ground mission commanders acceptable level of risk for 
unintended injury or damage. (T-0). 
3.3.10.  Random Point of Impact (RPI). When mission requirements dictate, RPI placement 
within the surveyed DZ may be used in lieu of the surveyed PI. The DZ size, responsibility, 
and accuracy requirements still apply when an RPI is used. Pre-coordination normally includes 
the air unit commander, ground unit commander, jumpmaster, and DZC/DZSO concurrence 
on RPI location and intent for use. Requests will be made at least 24 hours prior to time on 
target (TOT) for training operations. (T-2). Exercise and contingency operations do not require 
requests made 24 hours prior; however, DZC, DZSO, and/or ground force commander must 
establish RPI location concurrence and positive communications with airlift mission 
commander and/or jumpmaster NLT 15 minutes prior to airdrop in accordance with Table 3.2 
(T-3). NOTE: Relay all PI coordinates, if different than those surveyed or pre-coordinated, to 
the aircrew NLT 15 minutes prior to the TOT. (T-3). If PI coordinates are not relayed 15 
minutes prior, aircrew will advise DZ personnel of earliest feasible TOT for new coordinates. 
(T-3). 
3.3.11.  Multiple Points of Impact (MPI). MPI airdrops are authorized if all personnel involved 
have been properly briefed. MPI airdrops are an aerial delivery method that allows for the 
calculated dispersal, both laterally and longitudinally, of airdropped loads to predetermined 
locations on a DZ. The DZ must meet the minimum size for each PI according to the 
requirements listed in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 Additionally, provide the precise location of 
each PI to aircrews. (T-1). 
3.3.12.  Offset PIs. Compute offset PIs from the surveyed PI. Formation personnel airdrops 
may require offset PIs. Use 250 yards left and/or right offset for 3-ship operations, and use a 
125 yards left and/or right offset for 2-ship operations unless pre-coordinated. (T-3). Increase 
the DZ width accordingly to meet the distance criteria from the DZ edge to the PI. (T-3). 
AFSOC Special Operations Low Level II offset PIs will be 150 yards left and/or right of 
centerline and DZ width requirements will be met unless pre-coordinated. (T-3). DZs with 
offset PIs will have a minimum width of 900 yards. (T-3). Offset PIs are authorized but 
centerline PIs are required to be on the DZ survey. (T-3). 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021

3.4.  Instrument Meteorological Condition Airdrops.  USAF or USSF unilateral training and 
exercise airdrops of actual personnel or equipment require a minimum of a 300 feet AGL ceiling 
and one-half mile visibility at the DZ. (T-1). During contingency operations, ceiling and visibility 
minimums are at the discretion of the ground mission commander. For joint training and exercises, 
DAF personnel are authorized to use Army ceiling and visibility minimums. When the ceiling is 
less than 600 feet AGL, the DZC/DZSO will remove all personnel from the DZ NLT 5 minutes 
prior to the scheduled airdrop TOT and ensure they remain off the DZ until completion of the 
airdrop. (T-1). 
3.5.  Hazards, Obstacles, and Restrictions.  Hazards may be present on or in the vicinity of any 
type of DZ. Identify these hazards to all personnel and apply the appropriate risk management to 
mitigate potential injury or equipment damage. Identify DZ hazards to the greatest extent possible. 
(T-2). 
3.5.1.  Terrain Hazards. Terrain hazards are naturally occurring features on the DZ surface 
such as steep slopes, culverts, ditches, berms, boulders, and rock outcrops which create a 
landing hazard to personnel or equipment. Locate the designated PI away from these hazards 
to the greatest degree possible and mark hazards at the discretion of the DZC and ground 
mission commander. Rapidly rising terrain and/or mountainous area, (as defined by 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)), within 10 NM of the DZ center point will 
be documented on the DZ survey. (T-2). 10 NM may not be sufficient for high altitude 
operations. A mountainous area is an area of changing terrain profile where the changes of 
terrain elevation exceed 900 meters (3000 feet) within a distance of 18.5 km (10.0 NM). 
3.5.2.  Airspace Hazards. The existence of instrument flight rules, military training routes, 
visual flight rules (VFR), training routes, and slow routes and airway (Victor, Jet, or ICAO 
equivalent) may be hazardous to aircraft on the run-in or escape course. Document all military 
training routes, VFR routes, and slow routes within a 10 NM radius of the DZ center point, on 
block 11, remarks of AF Form 3823. (T-2). 
3.5.3.  Vegetation Hazards. Vegetation hazards are large trees greater than 35 feet, or other 
plants likely to cause injury or damage to personnel or equipment. Small trees, shrubs, and 
other plants which will crush or break upon impact from a jumper or equipment load are not 
considered vegetation hazards. Locate the designated PI away from these hazards to the 
greatest degree possible. (T-3). DZCs are not required to mark vegetation hazards. 
3.5.4.  Manmade Hazards. Manmade hazards include structures, debris, and operational 
support equipment or vehicles on the DZ. Locate the designated PI away from fixed hazards 
when possible and minimize supporting equipment and personnel inside the surveyed 
boundaries of the DZ during airdrop operations. If required on the DZ, the location of support 
equipment and vehicles may be briefed prior to the operation, and they should be visibly 
marked during night operations to assist in jumper identification and avoidance. 
3.5.5.  Obstacles. Antennas, towers, and aerial cables located outside the DZ can pose a risk to 
both the aircrew and the airdropped equipment or personnel. Document obstacles within 10NM 
that are 300 feet AGL or higher on block 11, remarks, of AF Form 3823. (T-2). For OCONUS 
areas where map data is not available, include any visual observation and note that map data 
was not available. If available, reference obstruction change file. 
22 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
3.5.6.  Aerial Power Line Restrictions. Power lines present a significant hazard to jumpers. 
Personnel can sustain life threatening injuries from electric shock and/or falls from a collapsed 
canopy. All restrictions apply to aerial power lines operating at 50 kilovolts or greater. Power 
lines will be documented on both block 11, remarks, and block 10, DZ diagram, of AF Form 
3823. (T-3). 
3.5.6.1.  If power lines are within 1094 yards/1,000 meters of any boundary (or PI for MFF-
only DZs), coordinate with the power company to shut off power NLT 15 minutes prior to 
TOT. 
3.5.6.2.  If power cannot be shut off, brief all personnel. (T-3). Document power lines on 
the DZ survey, to include status, shut off coordination procedures, and other relevant 
factors. (T-3). The AC, aircrew, and JM must conduct a risk assessment of the mission. (T-
3). Include as a minimum with; type jump, jumper experience, aircrew experience, ceiling, 
and surface/altitude wind limits required to approve, suspend, or cancel the operation. To 
further minimize risks, consider altering the mission profile to raise and/or lower drop 
altitudes, change DZ run-in and/or escape headings, or remove inexperienced jumpers from 
the stick. 
3.5.7.  Water Hazards. A water hazard is any body of water that has a depth of four feet or 
more with an area greater than 40 feet in length and/or 40 feet in width. 
3.5.7.1.  Identify water hazards on both block 11, remarks, and block 10, DZ diagram, of 
AF Form 3823, and brief to operation participants when a hazard is within 1,000 
meters/1094 yards of the DZ boundary for static line operations and 1,000 meters/1094 
yards of the PI for MFF/DBSL operations. (T-2). 
3.5.7.2.  Conduct planning and coordination to ensure parachutist flotation, safety boat, and 
swimmer requirements can be met for all intentional water parachutist operations and, as 
required, static line and/or DBSL land operations with identified DZ water hazards, in 
accordance with AFI 10-3503, ATP 3-18.11, TC 18-11, and AFMAN 11-420. (T-2). 
Additionally, conduct planning and coordination to ensure parachutist flotation 
requirements can be met whenever the planned flight path is over open bodies of water 
large enough to be unavoidable with a maneuverable parachute for one third or more of the 
distance under canopy, and when an open body of water is within 1,000 meters of the 
planned impact point. (T-2). 
3.6.  Airdrop Winds.  DZ wind information is critical to airdrop accuracy and aircrews use it to 
compute the adjusted release point. It is imperative the aircrew receives accurate and timely wind 
data. This includes not only surface wind and the computed mean effective wind, but also any 
unusual observations. Examples are wind shear or local phenomena that could affect wind 
direction, speed, or restrictions to visibility. 
3.6.1.  Surface Wind. The surface wind at the DZ is normally measured using an anemometer 
or other calibrated wind-measuring device. Report wind direction in magnetic degrees and 
wind speed in knots. The direction reported is the direction the wind is coming from. Measure 
and report surface wind from the PI when DZ terrain and/or vegetation affect accurate wind 
readings. Reference Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 for a list of surface wind speed limitations. Use 
Attachment 2, Table A2.2, Summary of Wind Observing Standards, to determine and report 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
23 
wind data for assault zone operations in accordance with the wind chapter of AFMAN 15-111, 
Surface Weather Observations.

Notes:  
1. During operational missions and/or contingencies, the ground mission commander and/or 
team leader will coordinate wind restrictions with the airlift mission commander or AC based 
on operational requirements. (T-0). 
2. Airdrop operations using ram air parachute system which have the capability to be 
deployed in a MFF or static line operating profile (e.g., Special Operations Vector III, MC-5, 
etc.) may use MFF surface wind limitations for all parachute deployment profiles.  
3.6.2.  Mean Effective Wind (MEW). The MEW is a theoretical wind of constant speed and 
direction that extends from the ground to a designated altitude. When required, the DZC 
24 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
determines the MEW by timing the ascension of a helium-filled balloon to a pre-determined 
altitude and measuring the angle of drift. The MEW is an indicator of the drift line and distance 
an airdropped object can be expected to travel. Paragraph A10.1 has the procedure used to 
conduct and report MEW readings. Table A10.1 is used to determine average wind speed from 
the surface to various drop altitudes. 
3.6.3.  Altitude Winds. There are no altitude wind restrictions for fixed wing airdrops. Refer 
to the appropriate MDS-specific aircraft flight manual, AFI or AFMAN, for altitude wind 
restrictions for rotary wing aircraft. If surface winds are not available, altitude winds may 
influence the JM’s decision to drop personnel. 
3.7.  DZ Markings.  A marked DZ is a DZ that has a PI or release point marked with a pre-
coordinated visual or electronic signal. Any type of lighting or visual marking system is acceptable 
if all participating units are briefed and concur. Electronic NAVAID may be used for either day or 
night operations and placed as directed by mission requirements. NOTE: Ground parties and 
aircrews must coordinate and brief NO-DROP markings for all DZs. (T-2). 
3.7.1.  Standard DZ Markings. Exception: Not required with PR/CSAR assigned and/or 
gained aircraft or AFSOC assigned and/or gained aircraft OPCON to USSOCOM, or a theater 
special operations command. 
3.7.1.1.  During day operations, mark the PI with a raised angle marker and/or block letter. 
If authentication is required, use a block letter instead of the raised angle marker. (T-3). 
Authorized letters for PI markings are J, C, A, R, and S. The block letters H and O are 
authorized for circular DZs. Align the block letters with the surveyed DZ axis or with the 
aircraft line-of-flight, if different from the survey. The minimum size for block letters will 
be 35 feet by 35 feet (11 meters by 11 meters) and consist of at least nine marker panels. 
(T-2). Refer to Figure 3.3. 
3.7.1.2.  During night operations, mark the PI with a block letter. The apex of the block 
letter will be located on the PI. (T-3). The minimum size for block letters is 35 feet by 35 
feet (11 meters by 11 meters) and consists of at least nine white lights, with a recommended 
minimum output rating of 15 candelas. When using flanker lights, DZC ensures they will 
be white and located 250 meters/274 yards left and right abeam the PI, unless precluded by 
obstacles or obstructions. (T-3). If using a distance other than 250 meters/274 yards, the 
DZC will brief the aircrew. (T-3). Use a trailing edge beacon during personnel airdrops. 
When used, DZC is responsible to ensure the trailing edge beacon is placed along the 
surveyed DZ centerline 1,000 meters/1094 yards from the PI, or at the DZ trailing edge, 
whichever is closer to the PI. (T-3). During pre-mission coordination for personnel drops, 
aircrews will identify to the DZC their trailing edge beacon requirements. (T-3). For all 
airdrops, the DZC coordinates and briefs the DZ identification to the ground party and 
aircrews. (T-3). Refer to Figure 3.3. 
3.7.1.3.  Infrared Lighting Systems. When mission requirements dictate and aircrews are 
trained, equipped, and qualified, infrared lights may be substituted for overt lights using 
the DZ marking patterns specified in paragraph 3.7.1. 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
25 
Figure 3.3.  Standard DZ Markings. 
 
3.7.2.  Non-Standard DZ Markings. The situation may dictate the use of nonstandard DZ 
markings. When using nonstandard markings or identification procedures, all aircrew, 
jumpers, and DZC, (DZSO/Drop Zone Support Team Leader (DZSTL) when present), 
involved in a drop operation will be thoroughly briefed. (T-2). 
3.7.2.1.  For MFF DZs, the two DZ marking systems commonly used for MFF operations 
are the wind arrow and the green-to-red system. Refer to Figure 3.4. 
3.7.2.1.1.  The wind arrow is formed by placing visual markers on the ground in the 
shape of an arrowhead. Align the arrow pointing into the wind. Place the arrow tip 
marker on the desired impact point. Jumpers fly their approach to land facing the 
direction of the arrow. 
3.7.2.1.2.  The green-to-red system consists of one red light or red panel and one green 
light or green panel. Place the red light/panel on the desired impact point and place the 
green light/panel between 15 and 50 meters downwind. Jumpers will be briefed on the 
actual separation of lights/panels. Jumpers will fly their approach to landing from green 
light/panel to red light/panel. (T-2). 
26 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
Figure 3.4.  MFF DZ Markings. 
 
3.7.2.2.  Marked water DZs will have mutually agreed upon markings (visual or 
electronic). (T-2). Select markings that do not mimic local maritime navigational aids 
(buoys, channel markers, etc.). (T-3). Unmarked water DZ will have predetermined PIs. 
(T-3). Include the coordinates of the PI in any applicable aircrew, DZC, and JM briefings. 
(T-3). GMRS, Verbally Initiated Release System, CARP, or JMD (including moving 
target) procedures may be used on marked water DZs. For GMRS, the position of the 
recovery or safety boat usually marks the intended release point. For water JMD drops, use 
moving target procedures. Refer to paragraph A10.2 Other options may be used to mark 
the DZ; these markings will be pre-briefed. (T-3). 
3.7.2.3.  Single-Marked Multiple Points of Impact (MPI) procedures are authorized for 
heavy equipment and/or container delivery system (CDS) airdrops where only the first PI 
in a series of MPI is marked and all personnel involved have been properly briefed. Single-
marked MPI are restricted to the surveyed DZ axis (no lateral displacement) and to a 
maximum of 1500 yards between the first marked PI and the last unmarked PI. The DZ 
must meet the minimum size requirements for each PI and the precise location of each PI 
must be provided to aircrews. (T-1). Refer to Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 for restrictions. 
3.7.2.4.  JMD airdrop with moving target procedures is used to calculate the jumper release 
point so a parachutist can land in the close vicinity of a moving target. This technique is 
designed primarily to allow forces to join a waterborne craft, equipment item, or person in 
the water that cannot or is not maintaining a constant position. The water dropsonde is 
approved for moving target procedures. Follow detailed moving target procedures and 
moving target pattern instruction in paragraph A10.2 and Figure A10.1. 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
27 
3.8.  Airdrop Communications.  To the maximum extent possible, plan airdrop operations with 
minimum radio transmissions. In general, all missions are flown as planned with additional radio 
calls made “by exception” only. Authenticate as required. Detailed mission planning and pre-
briefed operating procedures can eliminate many flight-following and information only 
transmissions. Limit radio contact with the drop aircraft to drop clearance, safety of flight 
requirements, or issues affecting airborne force employment. This includes air traffic control 
(ATC) directions, range clearance, unsafe surface conditions or mission changes. DZ winds or 
other information may be broadcast in the blind at a coordinated time prior to the scheduled TOT. 
3.8.1.  Airdrop Clearance. Positive radio communication of drop clearance is standard, but not 
required if mission clearance is corroborated by the appropriate visual or electronic markings. 
Airdrop operations conducted without radio communications will be thoroughly coordinated 
prior to mission employment. (T-2). 
3.8.2.  IMC Airdrop Clearance. Training airdrops (both unilateral and joint) conducted during 
IMC or to an unmarked DZ require the DZC to relay drop clearance (i.e., “Cleared to Drop”), 
to the aircraft by way of radio communications or other pre-briefed method. Drop clearance is 
usually accomplished a minimum of two minutes prior to the scheduled TOT. 
3.8.3.  Operational Airdrop Clearance. Mission approval is considered drop clearance for 
operational missions when no reception party is present on the DZ. 
3.8.4.  No-Drop Signals. Indicate a “NO-DROP” condition, DZ closure, or temporary DZ 
closure in one of the following ways with: authenticated radio transmission, red smoke, red 
flares, red lights, scrambled panels, or another pre-planned signal. (T-2). NOTE: During night 
vision goggle (NVG) operations, colored flares may still be used, but due to the delay in 
aircrew recognition of color, star clusters or other obvious signals are recommended. 
3.8.4.1.  During IMC operations, an authenticated radio transmission or the absence of pre-
briefed electronic devices will indicate a “NO-DROP” condition. (T-2). 
3.8.4.2.  Use standard no-drop signals to communicate temporary closing of a DZ or 
postponement of an airdrop. Aircrew should follow up with a radio call to the appropriate 
command and control (C2) facility as the situation dictates. 
3.8.5.  Radio Communications. When using radio communications, the following procedures 
apply: 
3.8.5.1.  Transmit “NO-DROP” advisories early enough to allow time for authentication; 
specifically, not later than one minute prior to actual TOT, unless an emergency arises. 
3.8.5.2.  If last minute conditions preclude a safe drop and time for proper authentication 
is not available, the DZC will immediately and repeatedly transmit cancellation of drop 
clearance, “NO-DROP, NO-DROP, NO-DROP.” (T-3). 
3.8.6.  Authorized Relays. Only qualified, certified and current DZ personnel or personnel in 
DZC training will operate DZ communication equipment. (T-2). 
3.8.6.1.  Relay operational information to the aircraft as requested when abnormal 
conditions necessitate such requests. DZCs should not be required to handle such messages 
on a regular basis. 
28 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
3.8.6.2.  If necessary, inform the aircraft of the source of any messages being relayed 
(DZSO, DZC, ground forces commander, etc.). 
3.8.6.3.  Transmitting the reason for an aircrew initiated “NO-DROP” is not normally 
required. However, if time permits, the aircrew should pass the information to the DZC. 
For a ground initiated “NO-DROP” (if time and security requirements permit), the DZC 
should inform the aircrew of the reason and should coordinate any further action. 
3.8.6.4.  During airborne operations, the ground forces commander may need to determine 
the number of personnel who did not jump to properly account for all personnel. When 
applicable, request the number of “alibi jumpers” from the aircrew. When requested by the 
DZC/DZSO/DZSTL, if the tactical situation permits, the DZC should obtain the total 
number of jumpers remaining on board from the aircrew. This should not be accomplished 
until after the last aircraft over-flies the DZ, and at no time if it compromises safety or 
conflicts with aircrew or DZC duties. Should such a conflict occur, delay or cancel 
transmissions accordingly. During MFF/DBSL operations, if time and flight duty 
requirements permit, the aircrew should pass “jumpers away” and total number of 
personnel and chutes. 
3.9.  Control Point Location.  The DZC establishes the control point taking into account pertinent 
factors such as an unobstructed line of sight, winds, positive control of the DZ, surrounding 
airspace, and security requirements. DZC must consider safety factors when choosing a control 
point location. (T-3).  
3.9.1.  Control Point Safety Location. During actual IMC or HVCDS, the DZC will locate the 
control point off the DZ. (T-3). The control point for multi-ship heavy equipment and all CDS 
equipment airdrops will be offset to the left or right of DZ run-in heading a minimum of 300 
yards for heavy equipment and 200 yards for CDS from the intended PI. (T-3). 
3.9.2.  Control Point Safety Location in Contingency Operations. Threats during contingency 
operations may require placement of the control point in a location not in compliance with 
paragraph 3.9.1 Carefully evaluate the threat against the risk of personal injury due to 
airdropped equipment. Do not use locations not in compliance with paragraph 3.9.1 for a 
given DZ any longer than tactically necessary. The DZC will move back to the standard 
location when the threat is no longer a factor. (T-0). 
3.10.  En Route and Terminal Navigational Aids.  A variety of electronic NAVAIDS and 
beacons are available to support DZ operations. NAVAIDS are utilized at the discretion of the 
airlift mission commander. NAVAID use, to include beacons, will be pre-briefed and pre-
coordinated to ensure the proper device is established with the correct setting and at the proper 
location. (T-2). NAVAID use, to include beacons, will follow applicable technical orders and 
tactics, techniques, and procedures. (T-2). 
3.11.  GMRS.  The DZC can mark a point on the ground with a visual signal to designate the 
CARP to the aircrew when controlling an airdrop. This signal may be a four marker “L”, six marker 
“T”, or seven marker “H” and is placed abeam, and 100 meters/110 yards left of the desired release 
point as depicted in Figure 3.5 Execute the drop when the aircraft is directly abeam, and 100 
meters/110 yards right, of this marker on the pre-briefed inbound heading. A pre-briefed code 
signal or beacon may be collocated with the markers to aid in DZ identification. Follow GMRS;

marking considerations, determining PI location, and marking placement techniques in paragraphs 
A10.3-A10.5 respectively. 
Figure 3.5.  Ground Marked Release System Day and Night Markings. 
 
3.12.  Verbally Initiated Release System.  This procedure may be used when normal drop 
procedures are not tactically feasible. The ground party determines the desired release point, gives 
verbal steering guidance to the pilot to align the aircraft over that point, and then initiates the 
release. Instructions transmitted to the aircraft must be concise and are based on the aircraft flight 
path/heading. (T-2).  
3.12.1.  Transmit “Turn Left” or “Turn Right” to align aircraft on desired inbound heading. 
3.12.2.  Transmit “Stop Turn” after alignment instructions when aircraft is on course. 
3.12.3.  Transmit “Standby” to the aircraft approximately five seconds prior to the release 
point. 
3.12.4.  Transmit “Execute, Execute, Execute” when the aircraft reaches the release point. 
Upon hearing the first "Execute", the navigator, combat systems officer or non-flying pilot 
calls "Green Light." 
3.13.  DZ Personnel.  Pending specific eligibility and restriction criteria below, the following 
individuals, when trained, certified and current in accordance with paragraph 3.13.4, may 
perform DZC responsibilities listed in paragraph 3.13.5 See specific MAJCOM and/or Service 
30 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
guidance for additional DZC eligibility and restriction criteria. NOTE: Authorized personnel, 
other than current and previously certified Combat Control Team personnel (CCT), Special Tactics 
Officers (STO), and qualified, certified, and current Air Mobility Liaison Officers (AMLO), shall 
be restricted to formation airdrops of four or fewer aircraft unless on a military range with active 
range control providing ATC services. (T-2). 
3.13.1.  USAF Personnel (Regular AF, ANG and AFR). AF members (other than CCT/STO, 
AMLOs, DoD civilians or contractors functioning as DZCs) are restricted to a 12-hour duty 
day. The Group/CC or O-6 equivalent may waive the duty day limitation up to 16 hours. 
3.13.1.1.  CCT/STO. The DZC will be an E-4 or above with a 5-skill level or higher, 
certified by the unit commander. (T-3). CCT/STO are authorized to control all airdrops for 
any U.S. or allied military force. See AFSOC guidance for duty day limitations or 
extensions. Current and previously certified CCT/STO that are DoD civilians and 
contractors may perform all DZC functions provided their statement of work requires those 
duties, they are certified by the current unit commander, and meet DZC continuation 
training in accordance with paragraph 3.13.4. NOTE: ANG/AFR Dual Status 
Technicians may perform these duties in a technician status. 
3.13.1.2.  AMLOs. AMLOs are authorized to assume DZC responsibilities for any U.S., 
allied, or coalition military force, in accordance with AFMAN 13-106, Air Mobility Liaison 
Officers. Scheduling restrictions and duty day restrictions for AMLOs are defined in 
accordance with AFMAN 13-106. 
3.13.1.3.  AFSPECWAR personnel, SERE Specialists and AFPECWAR Combat Mission 
Support may perform DZC duties during training missions, exercises and contingency 
operations. NOTE: ANG/AFR Dual Status Technicians may perform these duties in a 
technician status. 
3.13.1.4.  USAF Contingency Response (CR) Forces and Air Advisors (RegAF, ANG and 
AFR). Personnel currently assigned to a Contingency Response Force and Air Advisor 
units may perform DZC worldwide involving U.S., allied, coalition and partner military 
forces for airdrop operations to support training objectives or contingency response 
employment and sustainment requirements. 
3.13.1.5.  USAF Weapons School (USAFWS) Personnel. USAFWS Weapons Officer 
cadre and specified civilian contract personnel supporting USAFWS Weapons Officer 
training perform DZC duties at all approved CONUS DZs in support of USAFWS 
Weapons Officer training syllabi. 
3.13.1.6.  USAF Operations Group Personnel. The Operations Group Commander 
(OG/CC) may certify RegAF, ANG, AFR members and DoD civilian and/or contract 
personnel to perform DZC duties during unilateral AF training airdrops within that 
OG/CC’s local training area. ANG/AFR Dual Status Technicians may perform these duties 
in a technician status. The OG/CC should utilize airlift operations oriented personnel to act

24 months to maintain DZC currency. (T-2). Personnel who fail to accomplish this DZC 
event once every 24 months will not perform DZC duties unless directly supervised by a 
current and certified DZC. (T-2).  
3.13.5.  DZC Responsibilities. 
3.13.5.1.  The DZC represents the appropriate commander as provided in the mission 
directive. 
3.13.5.2.  Prior to personnel airdrops, the DZC ensures adequate medical, evacuation, and 
support coverage for intentional water operations in accordance with AFI 10-3503. (T-2). 
3.13.5.3.  The DZC observes and evaluates: 
3.13.5.3.1.  All factors that may adversely affect the safety of the operation and ensures 
transmission of weather information when required. 
3.13.5.3.2.  Condition of the DZ prior to the airdrop. 
3.13.5.3.3.  Placement of personnel and equipment on the DZ. Only designated 
vehicles (watercraft for intentional water DZ) and personnel will remain on the DZ. (T-
2). The DZC will position recovery and medical personnel and equipment so that 
constant contact is maintained with the DZC. (T-2). During joint operations, the DZC 
and the DZSO are responsible for their respective equipment and personnel. NOTE: 
For actual equipment or personnel airdrops, if the ceiling is less than 600 feet, direct 
all personnel and equipment off the DZ to ensure safety. 
3.13.5.3.4.  The operation of other aircraft that could endanger the drop aircraft, 
equipment load, or parachutists. 
3.13.5.4.  The DZC will have immediate access to ground-to-air communications 
equipment or sufficient signaling aids to operate the DZ. (T-2). Ground-to-air 
communication is required for IMC airdrops. 
3.13.5.5.  The DZC should ensure non-DZC personnel on or in the vicinity of the DZ are 
aware of the “NO DROP” signal in order to prevent an inadvertent signal to the aircraft. 
3.13.5.6.  In the event conditions are unsafe for airdrop operations, the DZC ensures: (T-
2) 
3.13.5.6.1.  "NO DROP” signals are displayed on the DZ. 
3.13.5.6.2.  “NO DROP” or drop cancellation information is transmitted to the aircraft. 
3.13.5.6.3.  The airdrop is cancelled. 
3.13.5.6.4.  The use of standardized “off DZ” terminology during all DZ operations 
related to strike reports and assertive statements for “off DZ” events. The DZC also 
ensures "Cease Operations," "Time-out,” and/or "Knock It Off" are used in accordance 
with paragraph 3.15. NOTE: Airdrops are not suspended or canceled based solely on 
34 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
aircraft alignment with the DZ, but the DZC may advise the aircraft if their alignment 
appears to be off course. 
3.13.5.7.  The DZC will conduct drop scoring in accordance with paragraph 3.14. (T-1). 
3.13.5.8.  The DZC ensures necessary reports, to include AF Form 4304, DZ/Landing Zone 
Control Log (Attachment 7), are properly filled out and submitted to the appropriate 
agencies. 
3.13.5.9.  The DZC may perform malfunctions officer duties if qualified, certified and 
current in accordance with AFJ 13-210(I), Joint Airdrop Inspection Records, 
Malfunction/Incident Investigations, and Activity Reporting. 
3.13.5.10.  The DZC will acquire and utilize the current applicable DZ survey(s). (T-1). 
The DZC assesses all observed obstacles, hazards, or threats not documented on the 
surveys, which may affect operations and reports them to the appropriate supporting and 
supported forces. The DZC should maintain Talon Point accounts for access to current DZ 
surveys and to view and submit assessments. 
3.13.5.11.  The DZC is responsible for all DZSO responsibilities listed below when a 
DZSO is not required. 
3.13.6.  DZSO Responsibilities.  
3.13.6.1.  The USAF does not require a DZSO for DZ operations. When a non-USAF 
supported force requires a DZSO in addition to the DZC, a DZSO should be provided by 
the ground mission unit. When required, the DZSO represents the ground mission 
personnel and equipment and is responsible for the DZC duties listed below. 
3.13.6.2.  The DZSO represents the supported commander as provided in the mission 
directive. 
3.13.6.3.  The DZSO ensures adequate medical coverage is available at the DZ prior to any 
personnel drops. The supported unit normally provides medical coverage during joint 
operations. 
3.13.6.4.  The DZSO clears the area around the PI of all personnel and equipment not 
required for control or as designated to remain (25 yards/23 meters radius around the PI). 
3.13.6.5.  The DZSO determines when surface conditions (e.g., winds, vehicles, 
obstructions) on the DZ are hazardous to airborne or drop operations. The DZSO decides 
to proceed with, suspend or cancel airdrops, and informs the DZC not later than two 
minutes prior to the drop. Use standardized “off DZ” terminology during all DZ operations 
related to strike reports and assertive statements for “off DZ” events; "Cease Operations," 
"Time-out,” and/or "Knock It Off" in accordance with paragraph 3.15. 
3.13.6.6.  The DZSO coordinates all no-drop, medical and emergency actions with the 
DZC. 
3.13.6.7.  The DZSO ensures the condition of the DZ do not affect operations or recovery 
of air items. 
3.13.6.8.  The DZSO ensures the DZ meets operational and safety criteria for the type of 
airdrop operations being conducted. 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
35 
3.13.6.9.  Placement of personnel and equipment on the DZ. Only designated vehicles 
(watercraft for intentional water DZ) and personnel will remain on the DZ. (T-2). DZSO 
will position recovery and medical personnel and equipment so that constant contact is 
maintained with the DZSO. (T-2). During joint operations, the DZC and the DZSO are 
responsible for their respective equipment and personnel. NOTE: For actual equipment or 
personnel airdrops, if the ceiling is less than 600 feet, direct all personnel and equipment 
off the DZ to ensure safety. 
3.13.6.10.  The DZSO ensures a qualified, certified and current malfunctions officer is 
present for airborne operations. The DZSO may perform malfunctions officer duties if 
qualified, certified and current in accordance with AFJ 13-210(I). 
3.14.  DZ Scoring.  Drop scoring is the responsibility of the DZC. 
3.14.1.  Strike Reports. The strike report reflects the circular error or the distance that the 
targeted object (or parachutist) lands from the PI; if a targeted bundle is not pre-coordinated, 
score the first bundle to exit the aircraft. Strike reports are given in yards or meters and relative 
clock position from the PI with 12 o’clock as the relative DZ axis heading. 
3.14.1.1.  Score object impacting within a 25 yard/23 meters radius of the PI as a “PI.” 
3.14.1.2.  Score the accuracy of mass airdrops during joint training and/or exercises, SOF 
standardization/evaluation events and high velocity airdrops as “Satisfactory” if 90 percent 
or more of all airdropped personnel or equipment lands within the boundaries of the DZ, 
(not considered “off DZ” in accordance with paragraph 3.15) Score these drops as 
“Unsatisfactory” if less than 90 percent lands within these boundaries, (considered “off 
DZ” in accordance with paragraph 3.15) Mass airdrops for personnel are considered 
approximately battalion size or larger or as intended by mission directive. Both personnel 
and equipment airdrops may be scored using mass airdrop criteria if the accuracy is 
indeterminable. 
3.14.1.3.  MFF and/or DBSL Airdrops. Do not score MFF and/or DBSL airdrops. Annotate 
actual TOTs and information relevant to any mishap or off-DZ drops. NOTE: Airdrops to 
a DZ smaller than the minimum size (waivered DZ size criteria) are scored based on the 
DAF minimum DZ size criteria. For example, a waivered DZ is 100 yards short of DAF 
minimum size. The drop is considered on the DZ if personnel or equipment land within the 
100-yard difference between the minimum and wavered DZ boundaries. 
3.14.2.  Scoring Methods. There are three methods to score airdrops, and they are listed by 
preference. Only score the first load or parachutist exiting from each aircraft. (T-2). 
3.14.2.1.  Measuring. The distance from the PI to the load is measured when precise scores 
are required. The distance is measured using a precision measuring device (e.g., odometer, 
laser range finders, measuring tape, cyclometer, GPS). 
3.14.2.2.  Pacing. Physically pace the distance from the PI to the place where the 
parachutist or equipment load landed to measure the score. 
3.14.2.3.  Estimating. Used when there is insufficient time or personnel to pace. The 
distance from the PI to the load is visually estimated. To assist in scoring by this method, 
place markers (visible from the PI) at desired locations from the PI at the 3, 6, 9 and 12 
o’clock positions. If the markers are used, indicate this to the aircrew. 
36 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
3.15.  Off DZ and Airdrop Malfunction Reporting Procedures.  In addition to the paragraphs 
below, users will refer to AFJ 13-210(I). (T-0). NOTE: Off DZ personnel landings do not always 
constitute an “off DZ drop” with steerable parachutes for static line and military freefall. Off DZ 
personnel landings may be non-reportable if it is determined that the jumper’s canopy 
manipulation was predominantly responsible for the landing placement and no injuries or 
equipment damage occurred. Before determining the incident to be non-reportable and resuming 
jump operations, the AC, JM and DZC must unanimously concur that the release point was 
accurate, the off DZ impact point was predominantly due to the jumper’s canopy manipulation and 
that no other contributing factors may affect continuing operations. (T-2). Warning: When an “off 
DZ drop” has been confirmed or suspected, the aircrew involved will not attempt another drop for 
the remainder of the mission. (T-2). In the case of an off DZ drop involving injury or death to 
personnel, the mission will be terminated and the aircraft will land as soon as possible. (T-2). 
Standardized “off DZ” terminology during all DZ operations related to strike reports and assertive 
statements for “off DZ” events; "Cease Operations," "Time-out,” and/or "Knock It Off." 
3.15.1.  On-site/Aircraft Actions. Keep all systems running, do not delete any data, save GPS 
trail (if available) and retain all mission paperwork involved in flight to aid in an investigation. 
Aircrews will immediately report information regarding off DZ airdrops that result in damage, 
serious injury, or death to a USAF command post. (T-0). Notify unit tactics and safety offices 
as soon as possible. (T-2). Refer off DZ mishaps resulting in death or serious injury to safety 
and accident investigation boards convened under the applicable regulations. (T-1). 
3.15.2.  Airdrop Incident On-site/Aircraft Actions Planning. Units with DZC/DZSO/DZST 
responsibilities will develop local procedures and communications processes to obtain 
emergency assistance to preserve life and limb, secure the site and notify the airlift and user's 
chain of command. (T-2). The first notification step should be through the airdrop aircraft for 
relay to a USAF command post. Alternative means may include relay through any local U.S. 
military installation. Local installations may also be able to assist with emergency response 
resources including, aircraft rescue and firefighting, law enforcement and public affairs. 
3.15.2.1.  Wings/operations groups will develop guidance for aircrews and DZ personnel 
for the capture and reporting of in-flight data relating to an off-DZ airdrop and/or airdrop 
malfunction. (T-2). This data must have enough detail to re-create the circumstances 
surrounding the incident for the aerial delivery review panel. (T-2). Accurate and timely 
capture of data is critical and is the responsibility of the AC. (T-2). 
3.15.2.2.  Aircrews involved in an airdrop malfunction will not attempt another drop for 
the remainder of the mission unless approved by the unit’s Group/CC or O-6 equivalent, 
or the USAF base airlift Group/CC or O-6 equivalent from which the mission was launched 
and returned. (T-0). 
3.15.3.  Aerial Delivery Review Panel Appointment. The aircrew’s Group/CC, or equivalent, 
shall appoint an aerial delivery review panel to investigate all off DZ airdrops. (T-0). However, 
when performing off-station airdrop missions hosted at an AFB with an AF airlift/airdrop unit, 
the aircrew’s Group/CC or O-6 equivalent may authorize the host unit Group/CC or O-6 
equivalent to perform the aerial delivery review panel in accordance with paragraph 3.15.5 
Panel members should include the Operations Support Squadron (OSS) or OG chief of tactics 
(OSK or OGK, respectively) as chairperson; a tactics pilot, navigator or combat systems officer 
and loadmaster; a Stan/Eval pilot, navigator or combat systems officer and loadmaster; airdrop 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
37 
inspector loadmaster, flying safety officer and crewmembers from the incident. The ground 
unit’s JM may also participate in the aerial delivery review panel when the ground unit is 
involved in the off-DZ drop. The chairperson may modify panel composition based on the 
nature of the situation under review. 
3.15.4.  Reportable Airdrop Incidents. The flight safety officer will determine if the airdrop 
incident is reportable in accordance with AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Hazard 
Reports. (T-1). Prepare the aerial delivery review panel to provide information requested for a 
safety investigation and report, if warranted. (T-1). Normally, the DAF reports injuries and 
damage to their own personnel and equipment. Other military services report injuries and 
damage to their own personnel and equipment. The DAF takes part in these investigations 
when requested by the other service. (T-1). 
3.15.5.  Aerial Delivery Review Panel. Convene an aerial delivery review panel NLT the next 
duty day after the airdrop if the incident occurs in the local area. However, if the incident 
occurs away from home station at a location without an DAF airlift/airdrop unit, convene the 
panel within five duty days (ten days for ANG and AFR units) after the aircrew returns to home 
station. The unit’s Group/CC or O-6 equivalent is the approval authority to allow aircrew to 
continue airdrop operations away from home station at a location without an DAF 
airlift/airdrop unit. Unit commanders will ensure aircrew members involved in an off DZ 
airdrop are not scheduled for any event that would delay convening an aerial delivery review 
panel or for another airdrop until the incident is resolved. (T-2). Upon completion of the aerial 
delivery review panel, the chairperson will submit recommendations to the Group/CC or O-6 
equivalent; if the option listed in paragraph 3.15.3 is used, then the host unit Group/CC or O-
6 equivalent will inform the aircrew’s Group/CC or O-6 equivalent of the panel’s 
recommendations. (T-2). The unit’s Group/CC or O-6 equivalent will make the final 
determination regarding any panel recommended actions. (T-2). 
3.15.6.  Off-DZ Report Repository. AMC Tactics (AMC/A3DT), amc.a3dt@us.af.mil, shall 
be the repository for all DAF off-DZ reports. (T-1). AMC OSS tactics offices will send the 
results of their delivery review panel by memorandum, message, or e-mail to AMC/A3DT 
within 3 duty days after the panel convenes. (T-1). Non-AMC units will forward their report 
to AMC/A3DT through their MAJCOMs NLT 30 calendar days after the incident. (T-1). If the 
aerial delivery review panel determines the incident to be of immediate interest to other airdrop 
units, send an immediate message outlining significant details and recommendations to 
AMC/A3DT with an information copy to the parent NAF. 
3.15.7.  Aerial Delivery Review Panel Report Results. As a minimum, the aerial delivery 
review panel results will include the following information in their final report with: date of 
incident, type aircraft, unit, type load, DZ name and location, type drop (SKE, visual, or 
computer drop), day/night, formation position, drop score (clock position and distance) and 
surface winds. (T-1). The report will also include causes and recommendations. (T-1). 
3.16.  DZ Surveys.  DZ survey accomplishment is the responsibility of the using organization. 
Users must ensure the survey is completed, meets the mission requirements and meets the 
applicable operational and safety standards. (T-2). AF Form 3823 is completed in accordance with 
Attachment 4. Until users complete all steps (survey, ground operations approval, safety of flight 
review and final approval), AF Form 3823 will not be usable and valid. (T-2). NOTE: DZ surveys 
expire 5 years from the date surveyed and Chapter 2 applies. Warning: Prior to using a DZ 
38 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
survey, the aircrew must ensure the DZ meets operational and safety requirements for their type 
aircraft, the airdrop type and the weather conditions during the airdrop period. (T-2).  
3.16.1.  Training Requirement. Except for operations described in paragraphs 3.16.1.1, 
3.16.1.2, 3.16.1.3 and 3.16.1.4, USAF personnel must require a USAF approved DZ survey 
for all training airdrop missions. (T-2). 
3.16.1.1.  Parachute Demonstration Team DZ Surveys. Office of the Assistant to the 
Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs ATSD(PA) MAJCOM sponsored parachute 
demonstration team operations (e.g., “Wings of Blue”, “Golden Knights”, “Leap Frogs”, 
“Para-Commandos”, “Black Daggers”, “Silver Wings”) do not require a formal DZ survey 
for public affairs coordinated high altitude low opening precision parachute demonstrations 
using DAF aircraft. It is the responsibility of the demonstration team leader/JM to ensure 
all service, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and hosting organization requirements 
are met on and around the DZ. It is the responsibility of the parachute demonstration 
organization to file applicable NOTAMs with the FAA. It is the responsibility of the flying 
unit to ensure flight safety will not be compromised. (T-1). It is the responsibility of the 
flying unit, the demonstration team leader/JM to ensure all parties involved are briefed and 
understand all aspects of the planned operation. (T-0). 
3.16.1.2.  Host Nation (HN) DZ Surveys. When dropping HN military jumpers and/or 
equipment on a HN surveyed DZ, the mission may be performed using only a safety of 
flight review, per paragraph 3.16.5 and a HN survey, per paragraph A4.2 A certified 
DZC is required and users remain responsible for ground operations and safety. 
3.16.1.3.  Austere Polar DZ Surveys. Due to the austere and inaccessible nature of Polar 
Regions, a physical inspection of the DZ may not be possible. For polar operations, a 
tabletop review of the austere polar DZ performed by 109th Operations Support Squadron 
Weapons and Tactics (109 OSS/OSK) will be an acceptable alternative to a DZ survey. (T-
2). 
3.16.1.4.  Tactical DZ Surveys. Refer to paragraphs 3.3.2 and 3.16.7 for restrictions and 
criteria. The use of AF Form 3823 is not required for a tactical survey. As much information 
as practical will be obtained and provided for review, approval and use. (T-2). 
3.16.2.  DZ Surveyor. DZ Surveyors should be U.S. DZC, DZSO, or jumpmaster personnel. 
There is no qualification/training required to fill out an AF Form 3823 in accordance with 
Attachment 4. Surveys will be completed, reviewed and approved in accordance with 
Chapter 2 and paragraphs 3.16.3 – 3.16.8. (T-2). NOTE: Reference paragraphs 3.3.2, 3.16.7, 
and 3.16.1.4 for tactical DZ requirements. RAAF CCT that meet qualification, certification 
and currency in accordance with AFSOC/A3T validated AUS-LMP Assault Zone 
Reconnaissance Course and this manual are approved to conduct AF Form 3823 and tactical 
DZ surveys for USAF approval and/or use. 
3.16.3.  Surveying DZs. The surveyor will perform the ground portion of the DZ survey (i.e., 
obtain physical or digital maps and elevations, collect measurements, coordinates, relative 
elevations, calculate size, create diagrams and annotate results on AF Form 3823). (T-2). 
3.16.3.1.  Tasking. The surveyor is tasked in accordance with paragraph 2.3.1 and shall 
support the requirements within the task or survey request to include identification of all 
potential uses and users of the zone (e.g., ground units, flying units, supporting units and 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
39 
aircraft types). (T-2). Additionally, as applicable, the surveyor should clarify any 
requesting user intent and conduct surveyor pre-production/pre-coordination prior to 
physical inspection on-site. 
3.16.3.2.  DZ Surveyor Guides. For personnel that do not regularly conduct DZ surveys, 
MAJCOMs and Joint Services may publish DZ surveyor guides that may be found on local 
systems, MAJCOM systems, or uploaded to Talon Point database. Build and update the 
guides to reduce survey processing delays. 
3.16.3.3.  Physical Inspection. The ground surveyor will conduct a physical inspection of 
the entire proposed DZ surface to identify and evaluate potential hazards. (T-2). 
Exception: Physical inspection limitations in accordance with paragraph 3.16.3.3.1 and 
open water DZs in accordance with paragraph 3.16.3.3.2 The surveyor will identify 
hazards to DZ operations located within 1000 meters/1094 yards of DZ boundary. (T-2). 
Additional surface area within 5 NM of the planned DZ center point should be evaluated 
by physical inspection, map study, aerial photography, GPS and/or electronic mapping 
tools for hazards to airdropped personnel and/or equipment, man-made or natural structures 
and ground personnel. 
3.16.3.3.1.  Physical Inspection Limitations. Operational threats and mission 
parameters may limit the surveyor’s ability to physically inspect the proposed DZ and 
surrounding areas. The surveyor will inspect as much area as possible within 5 NM of 
the proposed DZ center point. (T-2). Areas not accessible will be inspected through 
stand-off means to the greatest degree possible. (T-2).  
3.16.3.3.2.  Open Water DZs. Proposed water DZ locations that do not have land terrain 
features within 2 NM may be surveyed without a physical inspection. If not conducting 
physical inspection, the surveyors must carefully review nautical charts and maritime 
data to identify potential hazards on or in the vicinity of the DZ (e.g., buoys, navigation 
markers, maritime shipping routes). (T-2). Evaluate the surface area within 5 NM of 
the planned DZ center point. (T-2). 
3.16.3.4.  Hazards, Obstacles and Restrictions. Annotate all types of hazards, obstacles, 
restrictions and distance requirements as listed in paragraph 3.5. 
3.16.3.5.  Surveyor Submission. Submit the completed AF Form 3823 for review in 
accordance with Chapter 2. The surveyor is responsible for the accuracy of the survey 
data forwarded for review. Other reviewers may add additional information to AF Form 
3823. Coordinate changes to surveyor data with surveyor. (T-2). 
3.16.4.  Ground Operations Approval. The ground operations review authority is a 
commander’s designated representative documented as capable of performing DZ control and 
surveying. The ground operations review authority ensures the survey form is complete, 
accurate and that the DZ meets the criteria for planned ground operations. The review authority 
will also ensure that coordination has been accomplished with the requesting unit if the data 
for the surveyed DZ did not support any specific requirements submitted within the task. (T-
2). The ground operations approval also fulfills the quality check duties in accordance with 
paragraph 2.3.3. NOTE: Surveyor will not review their own survey. (T-2). 
40 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
3.16.5.  Safety of Flight Review. DZ surveys require a flight safety review and a signature 
certifying the review has been completed. This is the final review prior to the approval 
signature. As such, this review requires both the ground and flight portions of the DZ survey. 
3.16.5.1.  Safety of Flight Reviewers. The Group/CC or O-6 equivalent must document, in 
writing, personnel authorized to perform safety of flight reviews. (T-2). Personnel must 
have documented USAF aircrew airdrop experience as a rated officer. (T-2). Group/CCs 
or equivalents should utilize current/previous rated officer airdrop instructors but are not 
prohibited from using other personnel as long as all requirements are met. In the event 
personnel in the same unit that conducts safety of flight reviews also survey the DZ, the 
safety of flight review will be conducted by a different person. (T-2). 
3.16.5.2.  The Air Component Commander, COMAFSOF, or equivalent, may designate 
safety of flight reviewers to perform safety of flight reviews on DZ surveys. 
3.16.5.3.  Air Operations Center (AOC)/Air Mobility Division (AMD). During 
contingency operations, the tactics office in the AOC/AMD may complete the safety of 
flight review. 
3.16.5.4.  MAJCOMs may accept and use DZ surveys reviewed and signed by other 
MAJCOMs and OPCON authorities. 
3.16.5.5.  For AMC OPCON assets only, AMC requires that surveys that are not routed 
thru a region tactics office receive an additional AMC review prior to use by AMC OPCON 
aircraft. (T-2). 
3.16.6.  Safety of Flight Review Criteria. 
3.16.6.1.  Use a 1:50,000-scale chart and satellite imagery (if available) or MAJCOM 
approved flight planning software or system for the objective area and at least a 1:250,000-
scale chart for the run-in and escape. 
3.16.6.2.  Ensure the form documents all required information. Refer to paragraph 3.16.3 
and Attachment 4 for the list of items the surveyor must annotate on the form. Examples 
are: Terrain, towers, power lines avoidance areas and airspace. Add any required 
information to AF Form 3823 or consider rejecting the survey to the surveyor to add the 
required information to both block 10, DZ diagram and block 11, remarks, within the AF 
Form 3823. 
3.16.6.3.  Evaluate the DZ route of flight (run-in, drop and escape) to determine if there are 
obstructions or over-flight restrictions that may affect an aircraft’s ability to achieve drop 
altitude and airspeed, conduct the drop and safely escape off the DZ. At a minimum, 
evaluate ingress and egress routes 10 NM from PI. (T-2). If hazards/adverse conditions are 
identified, the run-in may be modified/restricted for safety reasons, the minimum drop 
altitude increased, or the safety of flight review denied. 
3.16.7.  Approving Authority Signature. Surveys must be signed by the Group/CC or O-6 
equivalent or higher with authority over aviation missions or assets prior to the survey being 
used for DZ operations. (T-2). Approval authority may be delegated to deputy Group/CC. This 
approval assures that the safety of flight review is complete and the DZ is considered safe for 
air operations. The approval authority does not accept the risks or the responsibility of other 
units utilizing the survey. Approval authority may also be the designated representative who 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
41 
is performing duties as the Group/CC. Tactical DZ surveys do not require a signature and are 
approved for use in accordance with paragraph 3.3.2. 
3.16.8.  Survey Submission. Submit the fully signed and completed survey in accordance with 
paragraph 2.3.5.

DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
Chapter 4 
LANDING ZONE OPERATIONS 
4.1 General. A LZ is any planned landing surface and movement area that has not been evaluated 
or does not meet defined airfield criteria. LZ may be unprepared, semi-prepared, or paved. LZ 
surveys quantify the risk of using a planned landing surface and movement area for air land 
operations and are not airfield certification documents. LZ operations governed under this 
DAFMAN must be conducted using a valid LZ survey unless on a valid airfield in accordance 
with paragraph 4.2.5.(T-2). Aircrew use of short field operations does not drive the requirement 
for a LZ survey. The absence of published airfield information from an authorized source in 
accordance with AFMAN 11-202V3, Flight Operations, and the AFMAN 11-2MDS series drives 
the requirement for a LZ Survey. The use of assault procedures and LZ operations have a higher 
level of assumed risk than normal air land operations. This chapter outlines the basic criteria, 
markings and procedures used in support of LZs. It describes the responsibilities of the Landing 
Zone Controller (LZC), the Landing Zone Safety Officer (LZSO) and the LZ survey process. 
4.2.  Responsibilities. 
4.2.1.  Shared Responsibility. It is the shared responsibility of the air mission commander and 
ground mission commander to ensure that any LZ being considered for use meets the 
requirements for the operation. 
4.2.2.  USAF Aircrew. Aircrew will only use LZ surveys when they have been trained and 
authorized by the MAJCOM to utilize LZ surveys. (T-2). 
4.2.3.  Standard LZ Traffic Vertical Obstruction Clearance Requirements. The lead MAJCOM 
is responsible for determining and publishing vertical obstacle clearance criteria for each 
aircraft type listed in Table 4.2 and in coordination with AMC Airfield Suitability and 
Restrictions Report (ASRR). 
4.2.4.  Waivers to LZ Minimums. Submit waivers to LZ survey data that does not meet 
paragraph 4.3 LZ minimums in accordance with paragraph 1.4 OPCON MAJCOM/A3, Air 
Component Commander, or designated authority may elect to accept waivers granted by other 
commands. 
4.2.5.  Rated Airfields. OPCON MAJCOM/A3 or Air Component Commander designates the 
authority level for formally identifying the need for a LZ survey. LZ Surveys are normally not 
required for air land operations to include assault zone procedures utilized on airfields with a 
Global Decision Support System (GDSS) Airfield Detail (Giant Report) assessment or airfields 
that have Flight Information Program products (e.g., Instrument Flight Rules or VFR 
supplements, instrument approach procedures). LZ surveys are required to airfields archived 
or referred to as LZs within GDSS Airfield Detail. For airfields, GDSS is the primary Mobility 
AFs repository of worldwide airfield suitability information (account with AMC required to 
gain access to link); https://gdss.maf.ustranscom.mil. NOTE: GDSS account is required in 
order to gain access using the URL. If an airfield needed for operations is listed in archived 
status within the Giant Report, then contact the AMC Airfield Help Desk to determine actions 
needed to allow operations at airfield.helpdesk@us.af.mil. A LZ survey should not be 
requested for an airfield listed in the Giant Report unless the airfield detail specifically states 
airfield use as a LZ, or if specific mission operations dictate a LZ survey requirement.  
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
43 
4.2.6.  Approved LZ Surveys. For air land operations to LZs and airfields that require a LZ 
survey in accordance with paragraph 4.2.5, users must ensure the LZ survey is completed, 
meets the mission requirements and meets the appropriate operational and safety standards. 
(T-2). AF Form 3822, Landing Zone Survey, or a Tactical Landing Zone Survey, is completed 
in accordance with Attachment 5 or Table A8.1 respectively. AF Form 3822 or Tactical 
Landing Zone Survey is not considered usable until all steps are completed: Survey, ground 
safety review, safety of flight review and approval signature (may be verbal approval for 
Tactical Landing Zone Survey). (T-2). 
4.2.6.1.  AF Form 3822 expires 5 years from the date surveyed. Tactical Landing Zone 
Surveys expire after mission(s) specified on survey. 
4.2.6.2.  For USAF aircrew, tactical LZs may be required to meet the appropriate 
commander’s objective(s). Tactical LZs are contingency LZs identified and used when 
emergent, time critical operations, or operational environment do not allow for completion 
of AF Form 3822 process or an on-site physical survey of the objective area intended for 
landing/departing aircraft. Tactical LZs may be paved, semi-prepared, or unprepared. Only 
USAF units with a MAJCOM approved requirement as documented in a mission essential 
task list or as permitted by MAJCOM/A3 may use tactical LZs. Caution: Tactical LZs 
have the highest operational risk and highest risk of complete loss of aircraft and personnel. 
4.2.6.2.1.  Approval of the OPCON MAJCOM/A3, Air Component Commander, or 
designated authority is required prior to using a tactical LZ. The OPCON authority will 
also notify the lead MAJCOM of the use of a tactical LZ. (T-2). 
4.2.6.2.2.  CCT/STO surveyor will conduct the Tactical LZ Survey. If on-site physical 
survey of the objective area intended for landing and/or departing aircraft cannot be 
entirely accomplished by a CCT/STO surveyor, than the CCT/STO surveyor will 
validate all data required in Table A8.1 and report data to the OPCON authority as the 
LZ subject matter expert. (T-2). OPCON authority will provide overall operational risk 
management of the LZ data and requirements to operations. (T-2). 
4.2.6.3.  Prior to operations, the AC must ensure the LZ/airfield meets operational and 
safety requirements for their type aircraft, the air land type, operations and the weather 
conditions during the air land period. (T-2). The AC is ultimately responsible for 
determining if the accepted cargo and fuel load will allow for both safe arrival and 
departure from any LZ/airfield. (T-2). ACs are the final authority to conduct risk analysis 
and mitigation for employment of their aircraft. The AC may conduct LZ assessments 
when a LZSO is not present as defined in paragraph 4.3.3. 
4.2.6.4.  LZ operations require LZ Safety Officers (LZSO) unless waived by 
MAJCOM/A3, Air Component Commander, COMAFSOF (O-6) or equivalent. (T-2). 
LZSOs must assess and report on all LZ features (e.g., runways, taxiways, aprons, or 
helipads) required for operations prior to use and must confirm that the LZ meets data listed 
on the current LZ survey. (T-2). LZSOs are not required but may be tasked to perform 
LZSO duties on published airfields. When tasked, LZSOs must assess and report on all 
valid features required for operations prior to use and must confirm that the airfield meets 
data listed in GDSS airfield detail (Giant Report) assessment or flight information program 
products (e.g., instrument flight rules or VFR supplements, or instrument approach 
procedures). (T-2). LZSO assessment and reporting standards, responsibilities and duties 
44 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
are specified in Chapter 2, paragraph 4.3, paragraph 4.13.1, Attachment 9 and AMC 
ASRR.  
4.2.6.5.  OPCON MAJCOM/A3, Air Component Commander, or designated authority are 
responsible to ensure appropriate tasking of LZ site surveys. Determination of threat 
potential (permissive, semi-permissive, hostile) applicable to LZ surveyor personnel as 
defined in paragraph 4.10 must be conducted prior to assigning an appropriate force to 
LZ evaluation operations. 
4.3.  LZ Minimums.  The criteria contained in this DAFMAN is for the survey, evaluation and 
assessment of existing LZs. The criteria found in United Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, 
Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, is for the construction and rehabilitation of LZs. LZ's 
built to UFC criteria should meet minimums and require minimal verification efforts. For all 
airfields and LZs, Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC) is the authority for Weight 
Bearing Capacity (WBC). Surveyors will utilize Tri-Service Pavements Working Group Manual, 
(TSPWG M) 3-260-03.02-19, Airfield Pavement Evaluation Standards and Procedures in addition 
to this manual to identify, collect, analyze and report existing LZ strength. (T-2). Make requests 
for changes to UFC 3-260-01, or TSPWG M 3-260-03.02-19 through the Whole Building Design 
Guide, www.wbdg.org. Define LZ minimums as WBC, geometrics/vertical obstruction clearances 
and LZ assessment. The evaluation of existing LZ and/or valid airfields data must meet LZ 
minimums identified in this manual to ensure airlift safety of flight based upon aircraft 
performance and suitability. (T-2). Waivers to LZ minimums to conduct operations to existing 
LZs are defined in paragraph 1.4. NOTE: When evaluating existing LZs, OPCON 
MAJCOMs/Air Component Commanders should consider how operations may affect a LZ 
deterioration and maintenance requirements. 
4.3.1.  LZ Strength Reporting. Use LZ strength reporting to determine rated WBC of operating 
surfaces. Report LZ features (e.g., runway (rwy), taxiway, apron) as semi-prepared, paved, or 
unprepared. Report paved LZ strength by Pavement Classification Number (PCN). Report 
semi-prepared and unprepared LZ strength by controlling California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and 
soil type. Specifically, for semi-prepared strength evaluated LZs, (includes unprepared), 
surveyors will report the controlling CBR soil strength profile, identify the controlling layer 
and determine the single most restrictive CBR value/thickness for each LZ feature surveyed. 
(T-2). Additionally, surveyors will report the number/type/depth of CBR readings and WBC 
& allowable passes (typically the largest suitable aircraft/weight for each feature). (T-2). 
Surveyors will utilize the Unified Soil Classification System to report the LZ surface soil group 
name (e.g., gravel, sand, clay, silt, or mixture of types). (T-2). Soil types have differing inherent 
properties and differing reactions to environmental conditions (e.g., moisture) that may 
increase or decrease LZ strength and/or suitability. 
4.3.1.1.  Semi-Prepared. Semi-prepared LZs refer to an unpaved LZ which has had some 
amount of construction or maintenance preparation. The surface may be native dirt, 
membrane, landing mat, or any combination of these. Surface preparation may include 
stabilization, adding an aggregate course, compacting in-place soils, matting, or non-
traditional surfaces that do not pose a Foreign Object Damage (FOD) risk to the aircraft 
operations. The amount of engineering effort required to develop and maintain a semi-
prepared LZ depends on the planned operation, the service life of the LZ and existing soil 
and weather conditions. Semi-prepared LZs do not have a set standard surface, so semi-
prepared analysis does not have a single strength reporting value. This is due to the varied, 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
45 
constantly changing surface and subsurface properties that affect LZ strength. (e.g., varied 
layer strengths, wet LZs may or may not have significantly reduced controlling CBR). Use 
surveyed soil type/moisture level/drying factors to predict estimated semi-prepared LZ 
potential use for air lands after rainfall events in accordance with U.S. Army Engineer 
Research and Development Center (ERDC) Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory 
guidelines. 
Evaluate 
semi-prepared 
airfields 
with 
various 
aircraft/allowable 
loads/evaluation criteria using the TSPWG M 3-260-03.02-19, or ERDC Tri Services 
Pavement-Transportation Computer Assisted Structural Engineering (PCASE) software 
programs; PCASE DCP application and AFSOC DCP applications. Careful analysis of the 
DCP data is required to ensure the layer data entered in the program represents the data 
determined in the field. 
4.3.1.1.1.  ACs shall review the survey to identify LZ feature(s) controlling layer, CBR 
values and soil type. (T-2).  
4.3.1.1.2.  ACs shall review the survey when planning, upon having received an 
assessment, and/or when conducting an assessment(s) to determine capability to 
employ or mitigate a condition that may exist that could adversely affect aircraft 
operations. (T-2). NOTE: Recurring use of a LZ with reduced strength risks has an 
increased potential for LZ surface distress. Operation planners may base planned 
operations around LZ survey strength to theorize a number of operational cycles before 
potential surface distress levels could negatively impact operations; Use the planned 
number of aircraft and configuration(s) and reported semi-prepared survey strength to 
identify predicted number of cycles. A single aircraft cycle consists of a single aircraft 
landing, all taxi and single takeoff. Aircraft cycles are not required to be reported nor 
tracked, and the distress level is theorized. Therefore, operations planning does not 
replace the requirement for assessment conducted in accordance with paragraph 4.3.3, 
it is not required in the LZ survey process, and it is not required for survey approval. 
Use surveyed controlling CBR profile and/or WBC/allowable passes to directly 
correlate cycles in accordance with Attachment 9. 
4.3.1.2.  Paved. Paved LZ analysis has a standardized reporting format. Conduct analysis 
in accordance with TSPWG M 3-260-03.02-19. (T-2). LZ surveyors may be certified as 
airfield pavement evaluators to conduct paved runway evaluations. Mark a paved LZ on a 
Class A or Class B runway. The markings may be permanent or temporary but cannot 
interfere with permanent priority runway markings. Existing taxiways, airfields, roads, 
highways, or other paved surfaces are considered paved LZs as long as the surface is a rigid 
or flexible pavement. LZ Surveys for paved surfaces may include WBC information from 
a previously published strength report. Surveyors shall report paved LZ strength by PCN, 
(when strength evaluated as semi-prepared also report semi-prepared strength), as specified 
in paragraph 4.3.1.1, paragraph 4.3.1.2.2 and attachment 5, paragraph A5.1.10.2. (T-
2). 
4.3.1.2.1.  Paved LZ Surveys Conducted Without Airfield Pavement Evaluations. For 
paved LZs where certified airfield pavement evaluators are not tasked nor a valid 
pavement evaluation exists, the LZ surveyor may collect data and report information 
collected (e.g., pavement thickness, distress conditions and where available, underlying 
soil strength). Additionally, surveyors will report the type of existing aircraft currently 
46 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
using the paved surface. (T-2). Refer to paragraph 4.3.1.2.2 below if thickness cannot 
be determined. 
4.3.1.2.2.  Nontraditional Surfaced LZ/Airfields. Surface treatments and macadams are 
evaluated as semi-prepared in accordance with paragraph 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.3.4 for 
assessment. Consider sand asphalt pavement “surfaced flexible pavement” and use 
traditional PCI procedures for flexible pavements. Sand asphalt may lack the lack the 
strength and durability needed for high tire pressures pay particularly close attention to 
identify the extent and severity of distresses, including cracking, rutting, shoving, 
weathering, and raveling. 
4.3.1.2.3.  Non-Standard Paved Asphalt Airfields. For all asphalt paved LZ that do not 
generate an operationally usable PCN, evaluate the pavement cross-section as 
measured. This pavement will produce a reduced load-bearing capability and 
depending upon the intended mission (contingency, number of landings, gross 
weights), that capability may not be sufficient. (T-2). When the concern is to facilitate 
the aircraft mission in lieu of preventing pavement damage, determine the PCN, 
consider the pavement as a FOD sealer and evaluate/report semi-prepared strength in 
accordance with paragraph 4.3.1.1 Operations may result in the destruction of the LZ 
surface. The damage caused by this destruction may constitute a FOD/surface distress 
hazard to both aircraft and ground personnel. (Specific MDS do create more LZ 
destruction than others). Decisions to utilize a LZ to the point of destruction will be 
made by the OPCON MAJCOM/Air Component Commander with Geographic 
Combatant Commander concurrence and should be limited to contingency operations 
only. (T-0). NOTE: Where possible, airfield managers, operators, maintainers, 
surveyors, or pavement evaluators should examine the pavement after each operation 
to identify and report load related distresses. 
4.3.1.2.4.  Paved and Nontraditional Surfaced Strength Review. Prior to Safety of 
Flight submission, the MAJCOM pavement engineer or MAJCOM designated 
representative qualified, certified and current in accordance with paragraph 4.10.4, 
will review all paved and non-traditionally surfaced LZ surveys. (T-2). The MAJCOM 
pavement engineer or designee will confirm or determine pavement strength, suitability 
if applicable and submit remarks as appropriate on LZ survey. (T-2). Each MAJCOM 
will be responsible for establishing a pavement strength review process of paved LZ 
surveys that are evaluated using paved or semi-prepared failure criteria. MAJCOMs 
without MAJCOM pavement engineers or designees may request that AFCEC or other 
MAJCOM conduct review. 
4.3.1.3.  Unprepared. Unprepared (also referred to as unimproved) LZs are a strip of terrain 
without a complete engineering or active effort to prepare the surface. Unprepared LZs can 
be either temporary or permanent. Examples of unprepared LZs are dry lakebed LZs that 
have been used during suitable dry seasons since the 1950s. Unprepared LZs may 
deteriorate rapidly and may require more critical evaluation. Unprepared is evaluated and 
reported as semi-prepared in accordance with paragraphs 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.3.4. (T-2). 
4.3.2.  LZ Minimum Geometrics/Vertical Obstruction Clearances. Select LZs to be of 
sufficient size to permit rapid takeoff, landing and loading operations. (T-3). Table 4.1 and 
Table 4.2 depict the minimum sizes for USAF fixed-wing aircraft. However, LZs are not 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
47 
limited to the USAF standard traffic. Table 4.2 depicts required LZ runway slopes, overruns 
and vertical obstruction clearances. Figure 4.1 depicts required approach and/or departure 
vertical obstruction clearances. LTFW aircraft are any aircraft smaller than USAF C-130 
aircraft. Identify additional LTFW and other aircraft minimums not listed in paragraph 4.3.2 
using paragraphs A9.1-A9.2, Table A9.2, Figures A9.1 and A9.2 All minimums are based on 
the use of maximum effort take-off, landing and taxi procedures by arriving, departing and 
taxiing aircraft. Some minimums defined in this manual for operations to existing LZs may be 
less restrictive than minimums defined for new LZ construction. Build LZs in accordance with 
UFC 3-260-01, Chapter 7. (T-0). MAJCOMs may publish additional LZ minimums in a 
MAJCOM supplement to this manual. Waivers to minimums defined in paragraph 4.3.2, 
Table 4.1 and Table 4.2, Figure 4.1 and Attachment 9 will be processed in accordance with 
paragraph 1.4. (T-2).

Note 1: Minimum lengths do not include any overruns. Minimum required overruns and use of 
overruns are defined in Table 4.2 and paragraph 4.3.2.2. For aircraft that use ground roll 
criteria, refer to paragraph 4.3.2.1. Environmental conditions and mission parameters may 
increase length requirements due to a longer ground roll. Include climatology and a person 
familiar with the performance of the aircraft during the planning phase to preclude a mission 
cancellation due to insufficient LZ length. C-17 minimum LZ runway lengths at different 
pressure altitudes, operating weights, surfaces and runway condition rating (RCR) are found in 
UFC 3-260-01, Table 7-2. 
Note 2: Calculated minimum runway length is ground roll plus (+) 500 feet, however all 
operations less than 3,000 feet require a waiver. Exception: Waiver not required for MC-130. 
Note 3: LZ shoulders are not required for operational LZ evaluation (survey and/or 
assessment) and use, but are required for construction evaluation (survey of initial construction 
or repairs).  
Note 4: Larger width is desired for normal operations. Consult MAJCOM guidance if desired, 
required, or planned use of a runway width is less than those listed in Table 4.1. (T-3).  
Note 5: The 180 degree turn (3 point) widths do not include a safety margin. Increase by ten 
feet for routine operations.  
Note 6: LTFW Aircraft smaller than C-130 not identified in Table 4.1, refer to paragraphs 
A9.1-A9.2, Table A9.2, Figures A9.1 and A9.2.

4.3.2.1.  Ground Roll + Criteria. For all MDS, MAJCOM/Air Component Commander 
may authorize the use of ground roll + criteria. This approval will be documented in an 
approved DAFMAN, MAJCOM supplement to DAFMAN 13-217, MAJCOM instruction, 
or an approved Concept of Operations. (T-2). MAJCOMs may delegate reduction of these 
criteria for non-training mission. Notify AF/A3S of the delegation level via MAJCOM 
Supplement or signed memorandum. (T-1).

Note 1: Slope is in percent grade and length is in feet. Grades may be positive, negative and 
flat. Longitudinal effective gradient (Rwy length slope) must not exceed respective aircraft’s 
value listed at any location along runway/overruns profile. (T-2). Surveyors/LZSO should 
report longitudinal segment gradient change (Rwy slope change) values/locations that exceed 
± 1.5% per 200’. The average transverse grade (Rwy width slope) of the runway must not 
exceed the maximum value listed. (T-2). Record and report any surveyed or assessed 
individual transverse runway and/or overruns grade(s) that exceed the maximum using 
percent grade and location identified in +feet from the primary runway threshold. (T-2). 
Utilize measured individual transverse values to analyze respective vertical obstruction 
clearances.  
 
Note 2: Length is in feet and runway slopes apply. LZ overruns have the same WBC as the 
runway unless otherwise stated. LTFW do not require overruns. 
 
Note 3: Width and height are in feet and inches. Measure Zone A width from edge of useable 
runway and Zone B from edge of Zone A (zones wrap around the entirety of the runway). 
Measure vertical obstruction heights relative to both the runway edge’s elevations and slopes. 
Vertical obstruction width and height maximums assume that the aircraft will land/taxi within 
the useable runway/overruns and that the aircraft will not exceed 5º bank at touchdown or 
during movement. (T-2). Zone A values account for potentially hazardous obstacles to the 
outboard nacelle and Zone B values to the wing tip, illustrated in Figure 4.2. Derive vertical 
obstruction width and height maximums for aircraft not listed in Table 4.1 in accordance with 
paragraphs A9.1-A9.2, Table A9.2, Figures A9.1 and A9.2. 
 
Note 4: Measure GSRs for approach and departure in run over rise (or %, angle); inner edge 
originates at the end of overrun or end of usable (both are the end of evaluated suitable 
surface) along the entirety of the width to the outside corners of B Zones. The length to and 
width of the outer edge of the approach departure vertical obstruction clearances are 
illustrated in Figure 4.1. Controlling GSR for a runway is derived by the most restrictive 
obstacle to air navigation (controlling obstacle) within the controlling region. The controlling 
GSR for at least one runway to a LZ shall meet the minimum GSR (departure obstacle 
clearance requirement) for the aircraft using the LZ. (T-2). Obstacles within the reportable 
region that do not meet the minimum GSR do not drive the controlling GSR to the runway. 
Reporting standards are identified in paragraphs A5.1.11.1. and A5.1.12.2. 
4.3.2.2.  Use of Overruns. LZ overruns have the same WBC, slope and vertical obstruction 
clearance requirements as the runway unless otherwise stated, (LZ overruns, unlike 
published airfield overruns, are evaluated as part of the runway features unless otherwise 
stated). For mission accomplishment, use overruns to increase the runway length available 
for operations.

Figure 4.2.  A and B Zone Vertical Obstruction Clearances. 
 
4.3.2.3.  Use of LZ Displaced Thresholds. Displaced threshold is a runway threshold that 
is operationally required to be displaced farther beyond the surveyed primary threshold 
located in accordance with Table 4.2 and Figure 4.1 Displacement of a threshold may 
52 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
reduce the length of runway available due to unusable runway surfaces, vertical 
obstructions, or controlling GSR required for departure. The portion of the runway behind 
a displaced threshold may be available for takeoffs and/or may be available for landing 
and/or rollout from the opposite direction in accordance with paragraph 4.3.2.2 however 
dependent upon on the reason for the displacement. The controlling GSR terminates at the 
displaced threshold and must be at or beyond the primary threshold. (T-2). Distance for 
required displacement originates from the most restrictive obstacle to air navigation, 
(controlling obstacle), within the controlling region. Identify and report all displaced 
thresholds, their GSRs and controlling obstacles in LZ surveys or assessments. (T-2).  
4.3.2.4.  Accident Potential Zones (APZ) and exclusion areas for LZs. Limit or report APZ 
and exclusion area potential factors to safety of flight that may exist when possible. APZ 
and exclusion areas provide a reasonable level of safety for land usage within the confines 
of LZs. Potential hazards within APZs and exclusion areas are listed in Table A9.1. 
4.3.2.5.  LZ Taxiway/Apron Slopes, Vertical Obstruction Clearances. 
4.3.2.5.1.  Slopes. Utilize Table 4.2 “Rwy length slope” and “Rwy width slope” values 
for maximum taxiway length and width slopes not to exceed. Refer to aircraft operation 
manual for maximum taxiway and apron rate changes not to exceed. 
4.3.2.5.2.  Vertical Obstruction Clearances for Taxiways and Aprons. Utilize Zone A 
and Zone B vertical obstruction clearances listed in Table 4.2 for both taxiways and 
aprons to identify and report all potential obstacle hazards to aircraft. For taxiway and 
aprons, aircrew will not taxi aircraft closer than ten feet to any vertical obstructions, 
nor within 25 feet of an vertical obstructions without a wing walker. (T-3). Identify taxi 
obstacle distances and maximum heights allowed by aircraft not listed in paragraph 
4.3.2 to satisfy AFMAN 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. 
To assist in determining and reporting obstacles and in conducting safe taxi operations, 
refer to ASRR Chapter 6 and/or the MDS-specific Volume 3, or other specific 
guidance. Include the actual measured transverse slopes in the analysis of vertical 
obstruction clearances. 
4.3.2.6.  LZ Apron Parking Setback. Measured from the outer edge of usable runway 
surface to the setback line, aprons may be contiguous with the runway but parked aircraft 
and vehicles must be behind this line. (T-3). Aprons are calculated as the total width of 
zone A and zone B, plus an additional 25'. 
4.3.2.7.  LZ Runway-Taxiway Separation. Measured from the outer edge of usable runway 
surface to nearest edge of parallel taxiway, LZ runway-taxiway separation is calculated as 
twice the total width of Zone A and Zone B, plus an additional 25'. (T-2). 
4.3.3.  LZ Assessment. LZ assessment is the collection, analysis and dissemination of the 
LZ/airfield conditions for operations. They are typically collected on ground by physical 
inspection, but may be collected in air by aircrew or remote methods. On a LZ with a valid 
survey, a LZ assessment serves to report conditions that may affect safe operations during 
missions not limited to weather, environmental conditions, threats, surface distresses, braking 
action/RCR, or any changes to LZ survey or airfield. Also complete LZ assessments to validate 
the need for a LZ survey. 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
53 
4.3.3.1.  AC/aircrew will assess any conditions that affect aircraft performance or safety at 
a minimum and report to unit command and/or LZC/LZSO when present. (T-3). 
4.3.3.2.  The LZSO, when present for operations, is responsible for collection and analysis 
of LZ data to ensure that the LZ/airfield meets the conditions listed on the current LZ 
survey, (or valid airfield’s governing documents). LZSO will assess and report current LZ 
(or airfield) conditions to include deviations to surveyed conditions and/or safety concerns 
to unit command and AC/aircrew. (T-2). NOTE: Aircrew, LZSO, support and planners 
may utilize Talon Point to acquire and/or input relevant and timely assessments when able 
to assist in safe operations and logistics. However, assessments in Talon Point do not fulfill 
responsibilities listed in paragraph 4.3.3.1 or 4.3.3.2 When a LZSO is not present for 
operations in accordance with paragraph 4.2.6.3, aircrews will conduct a minimum of one 
clearing pass prior to the initial touch down at an unattended LZ. (T-2) 
4.3.3.3.  Runway Condition Rating (RCR) and ICAO Braking Action. These values and 
terms are used by pilots to characterize the deceleration associated with the wheel braking 
effort and directional controllability of the aircraft. Aircrews use RCR and braking action 
to determine required runway lengths. The LZSO/LZC will report all available pilot-
reported braking action and correlated RCR, or collected RCR and runway surface 
conditions, when changes in conditions exist. (T-1). In accordance with paragraph A9.4 
and Figure A9.4, LZSO will conduct the vehicle skid tests at 20 mph and report RCR skid 
tested values as “estimated.” (T-2). RCR values and braking action for unpaved surfaces 
are listed in Table A9.13 Estimated Unpaved RCR/ICAO Braking Action, and for paved 
surfaces in Table A9.14 Paved Runway Condition Assessment Matrix (RCAM); also may 
refer to DoD Flight Information Program FIH for RCAM. LZSO/LZC will also utilize FAA 
Order JO 7110.65Y with Change 1-3, Air Traffic Control Order, para 3-3-4 and para 3-3-
5 for RCR/braking action reporting procedures and example phraseology. (T-0). 
4.3.3.3.1.  Skid tests/AFCEC approved methods or pilot reported braking action may 
not be possible to conduct and/or be available. LZSO or aircrew may utilize AFCEC 
guidance to estimate RCR of dry/wet semi-prepared surfaces to include matting or 
stabilized surfaces. 
4.3.3.3.2.  If any runway is evaluated to be flat (that is, if either half of the runway, 
based on centerline, is evaluated to be between -0.5% and +0.5% transverse section 
gradient), or evaluated as concave, inspect for standing/pooling water before 
operations. (T-3). Surveyors will include a remark in block 14 of the AF Form 3822 
annotating this requirement and no waiver is required. (T-2).  
4.3.3.3.3.  For C-17 operations, mission planners will require the RCR a minimum of 
24 hours prior to air land operations. (T-2).  
4.3.3.4.  Semi-Prepared LZ Distress. LZSOs and/or operating aircrews will conduct a 
surface condition assessment of all LZ features required for operations (e.g., runways, 
taxiways, aprons, helipads) in accordance with paragraph 4.3.3. (T-3). ACs will identify 
distress that could affect performance/safety of flight/operations, and make employment 
decisions in accordance with paragraphs 4.2.6.3 and 4.2.6.5. (T-2). When distresses are 
present, LZSO/aircrew will utilize Semi-Prepared Airfield Condition Index (SPACI) 
procedures to assess distresses on unprepared, semi-prepared and non-traditional surfaced 
airfields/LZs. (T-2). SPACI assessment of surveyed surface type shall be in accordance 
54 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
with TSPWG M 3-260-03.02-19 and Table A9.15 for surface distress conditions of semi-
prep, surface-treatments and macadam surfaces. (T-0). First, define surface distress, (e.g., 
ruts, potholes, loose aggregate) and individual distress severity level(s). Second, calculate 
the overall distress severity level for the LZ feature. Finally, report to operating aircrew all 
“Amber” or “Red” level individual distresses according to the following format: “Type, 
distress severity level, dimension, location” (e.g., “Runway 23, ruts, “Red”, seven inches 
deep, 15 feet wide and 500 feet long, on centerline, located 2,500’ from threshold”). 
Additionally, must report any LZ feature (e.g., runway, taxiway, apron) calculated to an 
overall “Amber” or “Red” level to operating aircrew. (T-2). When time and operations 
permit, aircrews and LZSO should report all SPACI assessments to applicable authorities 
and may upload to Talon Point. 
4.3.3.4.1.  Distress Severity levels. Distress severity levels are “Green”, “Amber”, or 
“Red”. 
4.3.3.4.2.  “Green” severity indicates low risk to aircraft operations. MAJCOMs are 
responsible for ensuring training LZs are assessed overall as “green” by having an 
active LZ maintenance program, sustaining “green” and rated strength capability. 
4.3.3.4.3.  “Amber” severity indicates medium risk to aircraft operations and repairs to 
the LZ are needed. The potential risk of FOD damage, ruptured tires and other safety 
of flight issues is increased. Notify the aircrew of the type, distress severity level, 
dimension and location. (T-3). The aircrew will evaluate the LZ distance or width 
available and utilize MAJCOM approved tactics, techniques and procedures as 
required to reduce the risk. (T-3). 
4.3.3.4.4.  “Red” severity indicates high risk to aircraft operations and requires LZ 
repair. Avoid or repair identified high-risk areas before subsequent aircraft operations. 
Notify the aircrew of type, distress severity level, dimension and location. (T-3). The 
aircrew will evaluate the LZ distance or width available and utilize MAJCOM 
approved tactics, techniques and procedures as required to reduce the risk. (T-3). When 
calculating a LZ feature to an overall “Red” level, a MAJCOM waiver shall be required 
for operations in accordance with paragraph 1.4. (T-2). Training and exercise waivers 
will be for the applicable operation use only. (T-2). Contingency waivers may be 
blanketed but will update with each personnel change in waiver authority. (T-2). 
4.3.3.5.  Rolling Resistant Material (RRM) and Rolling Friction Factor (RFF). RRM is any 
type of loose or unbound material (dust, till, jet blast erosion, or surface stabilizer failure) 
on the surface that separates from the solid base and lies on top of the LZ and in ruts. Use 
assessed RRM values to determine RFF using Table A9.16 Waivers based upon RFF 
values will be in accordance with paragraph 1.4. (T-2). Loose material (RRM) that 
correlates to high RFF may require more runway than is available to achieve safe flying 
speed. Only the C-17 utilizes RFF as the take-off and landing data numerical value 
representing the loose till on a LZ. All other aircrew will utilize RRM distress depth/SPACI 
to identify risk and should consider effects RRM may have on aircraft performance and 
take-off and landing data calculations. (T-3). NOTE: Many factors affecting operations, 
not limited to the following, should be considered when thick RRM/high RFF exist: the 
AC may elect to reject cargo to ensure sufficient runway is available; mission planners 
should consider presence of RRM/RFF during the planning phase as it has potential for 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
55 
insufficient takeoff lengths on projected LZ and/or needed equipment being rejected. 
NOTE: For C-17 operations, mission planners require the RFF a minimum of 24 hours 
prior to air land operations. 
4.3.3.6.  C-17 Semi-Prepared Runway Operations Approvals. OG/CC approval is required 
for semi-prepared runway operations within the CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii. OPCON 
MAJCOM/Air Component Commander approval is required in all other instances. 
4.3.3.7.  C-17 Semi-Prepared Runway Operations DCP. Requirements. For semi-prepared 
LZs other than matted surfaces, qualified/certified/current personnel must complete a DCP 
assessment within one week of the first landing to verify the LZ meets C-17 requirements. 
(T-3). The DCP values will be reported back to the OPCON planners. (T-3). NOTE: LZSO 
should perform a DCP analysis following a significant enough rain event on airfields that 
have soil types susceptible to erosion or material strength reduction. Report any collected 
controlling reading(s) in the LZ assessment when the estimated WBC is less than the 
surveyed WBC. (T-3). 
4.3.3.8.  Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF). Aircraft MAJCOMs publish ARFF 
requirements for each aircraft type. An example is Air Mobility Command Instruction 
(AMCI) 11-208, Mobility Air Forces Management. Planners should consult with the 
aircraft OPCON MAJCOM/Air Component Commander early in the planning cycle to 
determine and meet ARFF requirements. For exercises and contingency response 
operations lasting no more than 120 days in a 1-year period, overall USAF ARFF guidance 
is in accordance with Air Fore Pamphlet (AFPAM) 32-2004, Aircraft Fire Protection for 
Exercises and Contingency Response Operations. LZ operations will be in accordance with 
AFPAM 32-2004 correlating to contingency airfields. (T-2). LZSO must relay observed or 
reported ARFF status to aircrew as defined in paragraph 4.8.2.2. (T-2). 
4.3.3.8.1.  Per AFPAM 32-2004, the OPCON MAJCOM/Air Component Commander 
may exclude ARFF for infrequent flying operations as defined by the following 
parameters: C-17s will have no more than two takeoffs and two landings within 7 
consecutive days, C-130 and smaller aircraft will have no more than four takeoff and 
four landings within seven consecutive days. (T-2). 
4.3.3.8.2.  Per AFPAM 32-2004, the aircraft user provides ARFF capability at locations 
other than established USAF facilities. 
4.3.3.9.  APZ and exclusion areas for LZs. LZSO and aircrew should assess LZ’s APZs 
and exclusion areas to limit and report any factors that may affect safety or performance of 
flight. Potential hazards within APZs and exclusion areas are listed in Table A9.1. 
4.4.  LZ Markings. 
4.4.1.  Marking Equipment. Virtually any type of lighting or marking system is acceptable if 
all participating units are briefed and concur with its use. LZs are normally marked with 
frangible visual LZ marker systems. Daylight operations typically utilize LZ marker panels. 
Night operations utilize omni-directional visible lighting systems, with a minimum output 
rating of 15 candela (or equivalent lumens) and strobe lights (if required). Covert infrared 
lighting systems are standard for night LZ operations. The USAF standard is that aircrew 
approved for maximum effort operations are also Night Vision Devices (NVD) qualified. 
During contingency operations, non-NVD aircrew may utilize LZs and overt lights are 
56 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
required. NOTE: Visual marking devices will identify the edge of the surveyed/assessed 
usable runway as defined in paragraph 4.4.3 unless otherwise coordinated. (T-2). Adjust 
markings within the surveyed landing surface as needed to ensure a suitable LZ surface and 
coordinate with using aircrews. (T-2). 
4.4.1.1.  When anticipating landings at both ends of the LZ, ensure touchdown areas are 
marked at both ends. (T-2). 
4.4.1.2.  The LZ markings must be clearly visible to the pilot as early on the approach as 
possible. (T-2). 
4.4.1.3.  Added. To prevent damage to aircraft and injury to personnel, all marking lights 
and associated equipment must be adequately secured to the ground to withstand the rotor-
wash, created by the associated aircraft using the marked HLZ. 
4.4.1.4.  Daytime Markings. 
4.4.1.4.1.  Orientation and Color. Erect marker panels upright and face toward the 
aircraft approach to increase visibility to the pilot. The panels should be orange 
(Fluorescent Orange, Army Shade 230), cerise (Fluorescent Red, Army Shade 229), or 
other similar color clearly visible to increase the pilot’s ability to see them. 
4.4.1.4.2.  Materials and Size. Construct temporary panels of fabric, wood, or other 
materials determined to be suitable by the LZSO. Panel faces should be at least 66 
inches wide and 17 inches tall. Manufactured markers or expedient objects used as 
markers and any supports will be frangible to avoid excessive damage if struck by an 
aircraft. (T-2). 
4.4.1.5.  Mark loading and taxi areas as determined during mission planning or report 
deviations to markings. (T-2). For night operations, place suitable blue lights 500 feet apart 
on the straight portions or report deviations to markings. (T-2). If requested, reflectors may 
be placed halfway between the blue lights. Reduce light spacing to 75 feet on curves and 
at corners or intersections or report deviations to markings. (T-2). 
4.4.2.  Terminal NAVAIDS and Beacons. Special tactics and CRG units can deploy 
NAVAIDS as directed by the Air Component Commander. Modify the standard NAVAID 
and/or beacon procedures listed in paragraphs 4.4.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 as required for the tactical 
environment. NAVAIDs/beacons on LZs should be offset to the edge of the runway to ensure 
safe landing and taxiing vertical obstacle clearance requirements are met. 
4.4.2.1.  NAVAID. When used for instrument procedures, recommended placement is 150 
feet right of runway edge, abeam the first set of approach threshold lights (panels) in an 
area free of excessive aircraft, vehicle and troop movements. 
4.4.2.2.  Beacons. Ensure to brief aircrews on beacon placement. For Airfield Marking 
Pattern (AMP)-1 through AMP-3 landings, place approach threshold beacon 150 feet left 
of the edge of runway abeam the first set of steady lights (panels). Place departure threshold 
beacon 150 feet left of the edge of runway abeam departure threshold set of steady lights 
(panels) or flashing strobe. If only one beacon is used, place at approach. Use beacons as 
depicted in paragraph 4.4.3.1 and 4.4.3.2 for AMP-1 and paragraph 4.4.3.4 for AMP-3. 
4.4.3.  Airfield Marking Patterns (AMP). There are four standard types of airfield marking 
patterns, designated AMP-1 through AMP-4. When required, place panels for AMPs 4’-10’ 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
57 
from the surveyed edge of the runway and place lights for AMPs at 5’-7’ from the surveyed 
edge. (T-2). Ensure all markings are visible for using aircrew. Adjust markings within the 
surveyed landing surface as needed to ensure a suitable LZ surface and coordinate using 
aircrews. (T-2). 
4.4.3.1.  AMP-1. AMP-1 is normally used to support day or night VMC airlift missions. 
See Figure 4.3 for day markings and Figure 4.4 for night/instrument markings. These 
markings also implement STANAG 3570 and Air and Space Interoperability Council 
requirements. When using the AMP-1 pattern, aircrew mission planners and ACs are 
authorized to reduce panel markings for well-defined runways during non-instrument 
approach VMC operations. As a minimum, mark the touchdown zone and the end of the 
usable runway (not including overrun). (T-2). Coordinate reduced marking with all 
participating elements. (T-2). 
Figure 4.3.  AMP-1 Day. 
 
4.4.3.2.  AMP-1 (Instrument Approach). Instrument approaches for contingency LZs 
require special configuration. Use this configuration to support day or night tactical airlift 
missions during times of reduced visibility. Aircrew mission planners must not be 
authorized to reduce or eliminate panels, lights, or electronic navigational aids during 
limited visibility operations. (T-1). NOTE: Instrument approaches to LZs can be 
developed as MAJCOM certified procedures (See AFMAN 11-202V3). Complete a 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight check (instrument approaches) or military 
aircraft fly-ability check prior to using the LZ/airfield for sustained operations (T-1).  
58 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
Figure 4.4.  AMP–1, Night/Instrument Approach. 
 
4.4.3.3.  AMP-2. Use AMP-2 to support day or night tactical airlift requirements. AMP-2 
requires fewer panels or lights than AMP-1. Overt or covert lighting may be used. See 
Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6.

Figure 4.6.  AMP-2 Night. 
 
4.4.3.4.  AMP-3. AMP-3 further reduces the number of panels/lights used to support day 
or night tactical airlift requirements. Use overt or covert lighting. The “Box and One” is 
for runway identification only and the standard box length should be 500 feet. The box 
length may be 500' or 1000' depending on the tactical situation and the box length may be 
200' for LTFW aircraft. If the box length is not 500', it is mandatory the LZ controlling 
authority ensures all participating aircraft are notified of the nonstandard box length. (T-
2). See Figure 4.7 for day markings and Figure 4.8 for night markings.

4.4.3.5.  AMP-4. No markings are used for AMP-4. Unmarked LZs are referred to as AMP-
4 or as AMP-4 operations. 
4.5.  Unmarked LZ.  Unmarked LZs are referred to as AMP-4 or as AMP-4 operations as listed 
in paragraph 4.4.3.5 Aircrew must be approved and trained by the MAJCOM prior to conducting 
unmarked LZ operations. (T-2). MAJCOMs may have different procedures for day and night 
operations. Night operations may be further distinguished by unaided (no NVD or onboard 
equipment), NVD, aircraft equipment aided and lunar illumination requirements. 
4.6.  LZ Communications. 
4.6.1.  Radio Procedures. Radio communication procedures will be in accordance with 
MAJCOM-approved LZSO training. (T-2). 
4.6.2.  Emergency Signals. Standard ATC light signals are normally used if radio 
communications are not established. Signal a go around by using either red flares, a red-light 
beam aimed directly at the pilot, or a radio call to the pilot. See Table 4.3f. NOTE: Coordinate 
and thoroughly brief emergency signals. (T-2). NVG equipped crews may be unable to discern 
colored lights and any light signal pointed at the aircraft may blind the aircrew.

4.7.  LZ Control Point Location.  The LZSO/LZC locates the control point after considering 
pertinent factors such as security, threat, runway in use and view of the airfield and surrounding 
airspace. Separation of aircraft and the ability to detect hazards on or near the operating area 
supersede other concerns. 
4.8.  LZ Personnel. 
4.8.1.  LZSO. LZ operations require a LZSO. A LZC may also be required for operations 
involving multiple aircraft in the terminal area, for airspace de-confliction, and/or movement 
control on the LZ in accordance with paragraph 4.8.3 The LZSO shall be trained, certified 
and current in accordance with paragraph 4.9 The LZSO is normally a 5, 7 or 9 skill level 
CCT/STO, or an AMLO. 7 or 9 level AFSPECWAR personnel, or personnel in specialties 
related to aviation/airfield operation, may be certified as LZSOs. AMC Mobility Support 
Operations (AMC/A3M) may also authorize CR personnel with 7 or 9 skill levels not in 
specialties related to aviation or airfield operations to be certified as LZSOs. (T-2). NOTE: 
Special Operations Group/CCs (or COMAFSOF) may waive the LZSO requirement for a 
single aircraft during infil and exfil for contingency operations. 
4.8.1.1.  USAF Weapons School Personnel. USAFWS Weapons Officer cadre and 
specified civilian contract personnel supporting USAFWS Weapons Officer training may 
perform LZSO duties at all approved CONUS LZs in support of USAFWS Weapons 
Officer training syllabi.  
4.8.1.2.  Air Traffic Controllers and Airfield Operations Officers. Air traffic controllers 
and airfield operations officers require LZSO certification to conduct LZC duties in 
accordance with paragraph 4.8.3.1 Normally, both a separate LZSO and a LZC are

4.8.1.6.  LZSO for Unprepared LZ or in Hostile Environments. CCT/ STO, RAAF CCT 
and MAWTS-1 personnel certified LZSOs are authorized to perform duties in hostile 
environments. AFSOC Special Warfare personnel certified LZSOs may be authorized by 
unit commander to perform duties in hostile environments. Airfield Operations Career 
fields (13M/1C1/1C7), or AMLO personnel certified LZSOs may be authorized to perform 
duties in hostile environments with MAJCOM/A3 or Air Component Commander 
Approval.  
4.8.2.  LZSO Responsibilities. (For operations on LZs and rated airfields). 
4.8.2.1.  The LZSO represents the appropriate commander as provided in mission 
directives. 
4.8.2.2.  If ARFF is present, the ARFF relays status and capability at the LZ prior to the 
beginning air land operations. The LZSO ensures continuous contact with ARFF is 
maintained and reports to aircraft when ARFF coverage is not present at the LZ. 
4.8.2.3.  The LZSO maintains close liaison with the using unit commander, or designated 
representative, during joint operations. 
4.8.2.4.  The LZSO supervises and directs movement of all personnel and vehicles on the 
LZ, taxiways and within the exclusion area. If applicable, the LZSO coordinates with 
ground mission commander to minimize and control troop and vehicle movement. 
4.8.2.5.  The LZSO observes and evaluates all factors that may adversely affect the safety 
and efficiency of the operation. 
4.8.2.6.  The LZSO acquires and utilizes the current applicable zone surveys to assess all 
observed obstacles, hazards, or threats not documented on the surveys which may affect 
operations, and reports them to ground mission and airlift mission commanders. The LZSO 
maintains Talon Point accounts for access to current zone surveys, and to view/submit 
assessments. 
4.8.2.7.  The LZSO assesses, monitors and reports surface distresses when they exist. 
4.8.2.8.  The LZSO assesses, monitors and reports wet and/or dry surface conditions. When 
the LZ or airfield has experienced rainfall or surface distresses (e.g., excessive loose 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
63 
aggregate, layer failure or erosion), the LZSO provides tactical RCR/braking action 
(ICAO) estimates or pilot reports in accordance with paragraph 4.3.3.3 The LZSO 
determines when semi-prepared feature(s) soil type/condition and amount of 
rainfall/moisture require Assessment Cone Penetrometer (ACP) or Dynamic Cone 
Penetrometer (DCP) readings in accordance with paragraph 4.3.1.1 When applicable, the 
LZSO conducts readings for assessment and reports any controlling reading(s) with 
estimated WBC less than surveyed. Additional requirements for C-17 apply in accordance 
with paragraph 4.3.3.7. 
4.8.2.9.  The LZSO monitors the conditions of the landing, taxi, and parking areas and 
ensures the runway is free of obstacles before providing landing or takeoff advisories to 
aircraft operating at the LZ. 
4.8.2.10.  The LZSO ensures LZ markings (to include beacons and NAVAIDs if utilized) 
are correctly placed, secured and operating. 
4.8.2.11.  The LZSO manages, employs, monitors and may assist with ground handling, 
marshaling of aircraft and wing walkers when required. The LZSO also enforces safe 
aircraft parking setback from movement areas. 
4.8.2.12.  The LZSO evaluates and reports meteorological phenomena and surface wind. 
Surface wind is normally measured using an anemometer or other calibrated wind-
measuring device. Then LZSO reports wind direction in magnetic degrees and wind speed 
in knots. The direction reported is the direction the wind is coming from. Use Attachment 
2, Table A2.2, Summary of Wind Observing Standards, to determine and report wind data 
for assault zone operations in accordance with the wind chapter of AFMAN 15-111, 
Surface Weather Observations. Each aircraft type has different crosswind and tailwind 
limitations. Successful LZ operations may depend on referring to climatology data to 
determine optimum LZ orientation and the predominant landing runway direction for a 
given season. Crosswind and tailwind limitations may make a LZ unusable if there are 
obstructions on the wind favorable final course. Ground units should include planners from 
the flying unit early in the planning process to address aircraft wind limitations. NOTE: 
Wind limitations are based on available aircraft control surface authority, and stall 
characteristics are based on high or low wing and rudder size and placement. Due to 
limitations being based on the physical construction of the aircraft, wind limitations are 
rarely waived. 
4.8.2.13.  The LZSO ensures the dissemination of available estimated altimeter settings. 
4.8.2.14.  The LZSO formulates minimum safe altitudes and monitors the de-confliction of 
artillery and close air support operations. 
4.8.2.15.  The LZSO closes the LZ for air operations if conditions are unsafe for landings 
and relays cancellation of operations to aircrew and all appropriate agencies. The LZSO 
re-opens the LZ when safe operations can resume and notifies appropriate agencies. 
NOTE: Aircrew may choose to conduct operations at their own risk. 
4.8.2.16.  If a LZC is present at the LZ, the LZSO maintains contact with the LZC during 
the operation and advises the LZC if conditions are unsafe for landing operations. 
4.8.2.17.  The LZSO coordinates, establishes and enforces runway crossing points. 
64 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
4.8.2.18.  For C-17 Semi-Prepared Runway Operations, the LZSO determines the RFF, 
RCR, or ICAO braking action in accordance with paragraphs 4.3.3.5 or 4.3.3.3 and reports 
the RFF, RCR, or ICAO braking action to the aircrew prior to taxi, departure and arrival. 
After each C-17 departure, or anytime the LZ team notices a discernable deterioration of 
the LZ surface, the LZSO will re-determine values. (T-3). If it is not feasible to determine 
a new RFF, the LZSO must hold C-17 until RFF can be evaluated. (T-3). 
4.8.2.19.  LZSOs should know how to make inputs to special instructions and airspace 
control orders, as well as access the airspace control plan if they have proper clearance.

airframes, even when the ANG is operating in Title 32 status. 
4.12.2.  Safety of Flight Review Criteria. If the safety of flight reviewer discovers fundamental 
errors on the survey they may contact the surveyor to obtain the information, or the safety of 
flight reviewer may elect to reject the survey and return it to the surveyor for correction. 
4.12.2.1.  Use a 1:50,000-scale chart and satellite imagery (if available) or MAJCOM 
directed mission planning software for the objective area and at least a 1:250,000-scale 
chart for the run-in and escape. 
4.12.2.2.  Document all required information on the AF Form 3822. Refer to Attachment 
5 for items the surveyor could annotate on the AF Form 3822. Examples are: Terrain on 
extended final, towers and airspace. Add any required information to the AF Form 3822 or 
consider rejecting the survey to the surveyor to add the required information to both block 
13, LZ diagram and block 14, remarks, within the LZ Survey. 
4.12.2.3.  Evaluate the LZ route of flight to determine if there are obstructions or over-
flight restrictions that may affect an aircraft’s ability to reach a stabilized point. Evaluation 
of terrain/obstructions should include service ceiling and climb. Evaluate a four engine 
fixed wing aircraft for three-engine climb out and evaluate a two engine fixed wing aircraft 
for single-engine climb out. (T-2). 
4.12.2.4.  Evaluate surveyed aprons, taxiways and runways for safe landing and ground 
operations using reported LZ minimum WBC, geometrics and vertical obstruction 
clearances. The ASRR contains AMC criteria in the Suitability Policy and Procedures 
section. Caution: safety of flight reviewers use the performance criteria for all aircraft or 
the most restrictive aircraft assigned/apportioned to their OPCON authority. Additional 
users of the LZ survey must ensure the LZ air and ground portions are suitable for their 
aircraft performance. (T-0). NOTE: Operators of rotary-wing and single engine fixed wing 
engine aircraft will evaluate the availability of suitable emergency landing surfaces as part 
of the initial LZ selection and risk evaluation process. (T-2). 
4.12.2.5.  The AF Form 3822 documents the conditions that existed at the time of the 
survey’s completion and may not account for changes to the LZ due to climatic condition, 
seasonal topography, or man-made adjustments to the previously surveyed area. Prior to 
commencing operations, confirm the condition and status of the LZ. (T-2).

Chapter 5 
HELICOPTER LANDING ZONE OPERATIONS 
5.1 General. Helicopter and tiltrotor aircraft require HLZ procedures to safely operate in areas 
unsuitable for fixed-wing aircraft or outside of valid airfields. HLZs are dependent on the aircraft 
type, size and intended operations to include but not limited to takeoffs and landings, hover, 
Alternate Insertion Extraction (AIE). HLZ surveys are not required if another survey is available 
(i.e., fixed wing LZ survey, FARP survey, or DZ survey) as long as the survey clearly annotates 
applicable hazards. HLZ and tactical HLZ surveys support AIE operations unless otherwise 
specified. HLZ and tactical HLZ surveys intended for landings, takeoffs, or AIEs onto structures 
must include structural limits to support specified aircrafts and operations. 
5.2.  HLZ Survey Selection.  Selecting the HLZ location is the joint responsibility of the AC and 
the ground unit commander. In addition to this guidance, HLZ selection will adhere to MDS 
specific guidance. (T-2). Warning: HLZ selection is dependent on the aircraft type or size. WBC 
is not normally a factor but must be considered if the landing area is a platform raised from the 
surface or is constructed of a material other than compact earth, rocks, or sand. (T-2). Exercise 
additional care to ensure the HLZ is cleared to prevent possible engine damage or personnel injury 
from flying debris due to hover operations. (T-2). 
5.3.  HLZ Markings.  Markings are not required for day or night aided (e.g., NVG, infrared) 
operations. Unaided (e.g., non-NVG, non-infrared) night operations require a minimum of three 
overt lights to clearly mark the edges of the landing aircraft’s footprint. (T-3). Lights may be 
configured as indicated in Figure A6.9, however the samples provided are not all inclusive. Refer 
to service, NATO and partner standard tactics, techniques and procedures for further examples. 
5.3.1.  Added. To prevent damage to aircraft and injury to personnel, all marking equipment 
(panels, markers, supports, lights, etc.) must be adequately secured to the ground to withstand 
the prop-wash, rotor-wash, and/or jet-blast created by the associated aircraft using the marked 
LZ. 
5.4.  HLZ Survey and Assessment Requirements.  The HLZ survey program is a tactics office 
function. Squadron tactics, or designated office, must ensure surveys are conducted in accordance 
with the procedures below and Attachment 6. (T-2). 
5.4.1.  HLZ Survey Requirements and Responsibilities. Completing the HLZ survey involves 
a physical inspection/evaluation of the HLZ, documenting the information on the AF Form 
4303, Helicopter Landing Zone Survey (see Attachment 6), a safety of flight review and final 
approval/disapproval. If the survey was conducted using any other method than on-site GPS-
derived coordinates, surveyors provide the reviewer with the method conducted and raw 
coordinate data, level of accuracy, and any conversion(s). Though HLZ survey is not required 
for an AIE-only site, AIE-only site may be documented utilizing a HLZ survey and surveyor 
shall include the following restriction: “Restricted to Alternate Insertion Extraction use only, 
not intended for landing or takeoff”. (T-2). AF Tiltrotor units (AFSOC) do not require HLZ 
surveys for MAJCOM/Joint Chief of Staff-directed exercises or contingency operations. (T-
2). However, the requirement to complete an AF Form 4303 or to conduct a tactical HLZ for 
training shall remain in effect. (T-2).  
72 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
5.4.1.1.  HLZ surveys document the conditions that existed at the time of the survey’s 
completion and may not account for changes to seasonal topography or vegetation 
encroachment. Base recommended uses on minimum requirements and do not misconstrue 
recommendations to be all-inclusive (e.g., HLZ recommended for two HH-60s may not be 
suitable for a CV-22). It is the responsibility of the flying and ground units involved to 
ensure that any HLZ being considered for use meets the requirements for their specific 
operation. Users must ensure the survey is completed and meets the appropriate criteria for 
operational and safety standards. (T-2). The user should conduct a physical inspection and 
assessment of the HLZ prior to use to identify and evaluate potential hazards to personnel, 
equipment, man-made or natural structures and ground personnel in accordance with 
paragraph 5.5 Recommend adding photos of the HLZ during winter (snow covered) and 
summer to account for seasonal weather changes using the survey and/or assessment 
process. 
5.4.1.2.  Use a 1:50,000 scale chart or less when available for the objective area for the 
ingress and egress. Use MAJCOM approved government owned or civilian owned 
technologies, mapping/imagery programs, or flight/mission planning software instead of 
paper charts. The review lists all obstructions such as terrain, towers, or power lines that 
may affect the helicopter’s route of flight. Also listed on the review are any prohibited 
areas, noise sensitive areas, special use airspace, route of flight to avoid such areas, 
preferred routing, NOTAM requirements, etc. 
5.4.1.3.  HLZ Surveyors. CCT/STO, Pathfinders, qualified DoD civilians or contractors, 
qualified rotary/tiltrotor wing aircrew members, group weapons and tactics personnel, 
sister service rotary/tiltrotor wing aircrew, AFSPECWAR, and any other SOF or 
conventional personnel in aviation/airfield related specialties with the knowledge and unit 
training are authorized to complete the physical inspection of the HLZ and annotate the AF 
Form 4303. Regardless of who conducted the survey or assessment, the commander of the 
using unit shall be responsible for ensuring the HLZ meets the criteria for HLZ operations. 
(T-2). NOTE: RAAF CCT that meet qualification, certification and currency in 
accordance with AFSOC/A3T validated AUS-LMP Assault Zone Reconnaissance Course 
and this manual are approved to conduct HLZ surveys and/or assessments for USAF 
approval. 
5.4.2.  HLZ Survey Conduct and Review Process. The following paragraphs outline the HLZ 
conduct and review process from performing the initial groundwork to the final coordination. 
Forward all completed surveys to the group tactics office, or an office with an equivalent level 
of expertise. (T-2). Re-accomplish surveys when the user and/or provider determine changes 
in the ground or air aspects of the HLZ data require a new survey. (T-2). Users and surveyors 
may maintain Talon Point accounts for access to current HLZ surveys and to view/submit 
assessments when able. 
5.4.2.1.  A surveyor will conduct the HLZ survey (AF Form 4303, Attachment 6), during 
daylight in accordance with paragraph 5.4.1.3. (T-2). The surveyor performs the ground 
evaluation of the HLZ site (e.g., measurements, coordinates, calculating size, obtaining 
maps and creating diagrams) and annotates results on the AF Form 4303. The surveyor 
may be a member of the unit that intends to use the HLZ, or a member of another unit may 
perform the ground portion of a survey if requested and time permits. To facilitate future 
use of surveyed HLZs, initial surveys will encompass the largest area available and will 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
73 
not be limited by specific mission requirements. (T-2). The surveyor will forward the 
completed survey to the group tactics office, or the Group/CC’s or O-6 equivalent’s 
designated office, for review. (T-2). Include recommended use and any deviations from 
HLZ standards contained in service or MAJCOM directives on block 9, remarks, of the 
HLZ Survey. 
5.4.2.2.  The reviewer, in order of preference, is chief (or flight commander) of unit tactics, 
assistant operations officer, squadron operations officer (or the office designated by 
MAJCOM supplement) or AC. The reviewer ensures the HLZ can be safely used from a 
flight perspective and annotates a review was completed on the AF Form 4303, item 4B. 
Throughout the review process, HLZ survey packages will include all applicable maps, 
photos, charts, and diagrams necessary to determine the safety and utility of the HLZ. (T-
2). 
5.4.2.3.  Approval Authority (AF Form 4303, item 4C). Prior to use, the Group/CC, or O-
6 equivalent or higher with authority over aviation missions or assets will approve surveys 
for air operations. (T-2). Approval authority may be delegated to deputy Group/CC, 
squadron commander, squadron operations officer, or assistant operations officer. This 
approval assures the review has been accomplished and the HLZ is considered safe for air 
operations. Tactical HLZ surveys do not require a signature and are approved for use in 
accordance with paragraph 5.4.3. 
5.4.2.4.  Once item 4C of AF Form 4303 is completed, the survey is ready for use. 
Respective group tactics offices are the local area repositories for HLZ surveys. The group 
tactics office will ensure new surveys are uploaded to Talon Point. (T-2). When conducting 
operations at any surveyed HLZ, the commander of the using unit shall be responsible for 
ensuring the HLZ meets the criteria for that operation (T-2). In all cases, the using unit 
must accept responsibility for all personnel injuries and property damage. (T-2). 
5.4.2.5.  Host Nation (HN) or Joint HLZ Surveys. When conducting operations on or over 
a HN surveyed HLZ, complete a safety of flight review of the HN survey before operations 
to the HLZ begin. (T-2). Users remain responsible for ground operational and safety 
criteria. Use Joint or Host nation HLZ surveys in place of the AF Form 4303 process as 
long as the survey has been reviewed and all criteria required within the AF Form 4303 are 
covered. 
5.4.3.  Tactical HLZ Surveys. Tactical HLZ surveys may be required to meet the appropriate 
commander’s objective(s). Conduct tactical HLZ surveys when emergent time critical 
operations, training objectives, or operational environment do not allow for completion of the 
AF Form 4303 process or on-site physical survey of the objective area intended for 
landing/departing aircraft. HLZs may be tactically surveyed by aircrew, ground forces, or the 
use of imagery. Aircrew should conduct an airborne (hi-low assessment) of tactical HLZ prior 
to landing. Though tactical HLZ surveys do not require an AF Form 4303, minimum Tactical 
HLZ requirements are identified by asterisks within Attachment 6, Guidance Concerning AF 
Form 4303. MAJCOMs may determine standard tactical HLZ survey format. For routine use, 
complete an AF Form 4303. (T-2). Additional Joint tactical HLZ operations, considerations 
and briefing within AFTTP 3-2.6, JFIRE, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures 
for Joint Application of Firepower, Appendix G and tables 91 and 92, may be found at 
https://www.alsa.mil/mttps/jfire/. 
74 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
5.4.3.1.  Though preferable, the use of an AF Form 4303 is not required for a tactical 
survey. 
5.4.3.2.  When using a tactical HLZ, the using unit assumes roles/responsibility for safety 
of flight and approval for use. 
5.5.  HLZ Survey Assessments/Updates.  Assess existing HLZ surveys every 12 months. (T-2). 
HLZs that are not assessed in the twelve-month time period will be closed until reviewed using 
the above criteria (does not require a new AF Form 4303). (T-2). The minimum requirement to 
assess a HLZ survey requires a HLZ surveyor in accordance with paragraph 5.4.1.3 to physically 
evaluate the HLZ. The surveyor must ensure items six through ten of AF Form 4303 are still 
accurate. (T-2). Report assessment of HLZ survey in Talon Point database. If not updated in Talon 
Point, physically annotate date assessed and surveyor’s name and unit in block 9, remarks, of the 
HLZ Survey until Talon Point inclusion. An HLZ survey that has not been updated for 24 months 
is expired and a resurvey of the AF Form 4303 is required (requires new reviewer and approver 
signatures). (T-2). When significant changes are identified at any time or during an assessment 
(e.g., obstacles that affect flight or landing safety), the HLZ requires a resurvey. An HLZ survey 
expires 5 years from original date surveyed at which point a new survey must be conducted. (T-
2). NOTE: AFGSC will establish requirements in their supplement for updating missile alert 
facilities and launch facility surveys. (T-2).

Chapter 6 
LC-130 SKIWAY AND SKI LANDING AREA CRITERIA 
6.1 General. These procedures apply to all agencies involved in or supporting LC-130 operations 
and clarify LC-130 Polar LZ requirements. The waiver authority for non-tiered compliance items 
in this chapter is the 109th Operations Group Commander (109 OG/CC). 
6.2.  Selection of LC-130 Landing Sites.  Proposed landing sites must be submitted to 109 
OSF/OSK Polar Tactics at: 1 Air National Guard Road, Scotia, NY 12302-9752. Phone: Comm 
518-344-2640, or DSN 344-2640. Agencies must also provide information on ice depth and 
surface characteristics when applicable. Minimum thickness is discussed in Table 6.1.  
6.3.  LC-130 Polar LZs.  Polar LZs are LC-130 landing surfaces that include ski airfields 
(skiways & ski landing areas (SLAs)), ice runways and open snow areas. 
6.3.1.  Ski Airfields. Ski airfields are prepared (groomed), skis-only polar LZs marked as either 
skiways or SLAs in accordance with this DAFMAN. 
6.3.2.  Ice Runways. These are prepared for wheeled operations and may be constructed on 
compacted snow or native ice. Mark ice runways in the same manner as ski airfields. 
6.3.3.  Open Snow Areas. These are generally unprepared, skis-only, open-field landing areas 
with limited or no markings. Open snow areas include snow fields, glaciers and snow–covered 
ice sheets. Due to lack of surface preparation and airfield markings, open snow operations 
present unique risk elements which require mitigation. 
6.4.  Maximum Aircraft Gross Weight.  The LC-130 C2 establishes the maximum gross weights 
for LC-130 operations at specific polar LZs. 
6.4.1.  Variables Affecting Maximum Operating Gross Weight. Variables which affect 
maximum aircraft operating gross weight include surface roughness, hardness, ice thickness, 
snow cover and snow depth. These characteristics should be continually monitored and 
evaluated for their effect on allowable aircraft gross weight, particularly when the LZ has been 
left unattended or after severe weather conditions. 
6.4.2.  Surface Preparation. Generally, an increased level of surface preparation or grooming 
will allow for increased operating weights. A four-inch elevation change in 20 feet is the 
threshold for what is considered “smooth.” If this threshold is exceeded, structural damage to 
the skis may occur at higher operating weights. 
6.4.3.  Maximum Aircraft Gross Weight References. For detailed maximum aircraft operating 
gross weight information, refer to 109th AW supplements to AFI 11-2C-130V3ADDD, LC-
130 Ski Procedures and Technical Order (T.O.) 1C-130(L) H-1, Flight Manual. 
6.5.  Ski Landing Area.  Several agencies and a large body of scientific research have conducted 
extensive research and testing of ice characteristics and testing data is available to agencies 
interested in ice field or sea ice operations. 
6.5.1.  Ice Weight Bearing Capacity. The load bearing capacity of ice sheets varies with 
thickness, surface temperature, weight of the aircraft and parking time. Minimum ice thickness 
required for LC-130 operations is based on data derived from U.S. Naval Civil Engineering 
Lab, Technical Report R860, Ice Engineering - Study of Related Properties of Floating Sea-
76 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
Ice Sheets and Summary of Elastic and Viscoelastic Analyses, Canadian Forces Air Command 
Manual (CFACM) 10-100, Air Transport Group Ice Strip Requirements for CC 130 Hercules, 
CC 115 Buffalo, and CC 138 Twin Otter Operations and LC-130 aircraft field experience. The 
limits in Table 6.1 are established as minimum values for LC-130 aircraft. They may be 
applied up to the maximum ski landing/takeoff gross weights listed in T.O. 1C-130(L) H-1, 
Operations with ambient temperature above freezing must be evaluated and approved in 
accordance with applicable LC-130 C2. 
Table 6.1.  Ice Weight Bearing Capacity. 
SURFACE TEMPERATURE 
MINIMUM ICE THICKNESS 
-10 deg C or less 
55 inches 
-10 to -5 deg C 
60 inches 
-5 to 0 deg C 
85 inches 
6.5.2.  Ski Landing Area Testing. Conduct testing of ice sheet depth at landing/takeoff areas 
by drilling through the ice at 500-foot intervals on alternated sides for the entire length of the 
landing area. Minimum depth values will not include surface snow or slush. Perform additional 
drill tests weekly during continuous operations or prior to resuming landings/takeoffs after a 
period of non-use of more than one week. Check the area regularly for signs of cracking or 
surface deterioration. 
6.6.  Surface Suitability.  Surface evaluation of potential landing/takeoff areas is necessary to 
assure the area is suitable for LC-130 ski operations. The better the natural conditions, the less 
preparation work will be necessary. The best condition is a relatively smooth surface with 2 or 
more years of snow accumulation to a depth of 12 inches (the minimum acceptable depth is six 
inches). Unsuitable Surface Conditions are as follows. Avoid the following conditions: 
6.6.1.  Undulating or irregular ice. Undulating or irregular ice underneath the snow surface, 
often hidden by the snow cover, can impact the skis during landing or takeoff which may 
damage skis and other aircraft structure. Ice irregularities can do significant damage to skis 
when struck at any speed; an ice crack or pressure ridge with an edge of more than four inches 
may do damage at taxi speeds as the ski bridges the crack and a stress point is applied to the 
ski. 
6.6.2.  Bare ice with little or no snow cover. Snow cover is required to cushion and distribute 
loads over the skis. Even small irregularities or cracks in bare ice can create stress points along 
the ski that can cause damage. 
6.6.3.  Large irregularities in the snow surface. (ridges, humps and surface irregularities 
created by wind action known as “sastrugi”). Sastrugi, ridges, or humps more than four inches 
may do damage at taxi speeds as the ski bridges the crack and a stress point is applied to the 
ski. These irregularities require extensive surface preparation before ski operations or damage 
to skis may occur. 
6.7.  Surface Preparation and Maintenance.  The agency being supported is responsible for 
preparing the surface. Surface preparation must include a thorough survey of the landing area to 
look for ice irregularities and study snow depths and characteristics. Remove any unacceptable 
irregularities. Snow irregularities may be large enough to require the entire surface to be dragged 
or graded to fill low areas and remove high areas. Grade all undulating surfaces to minimize the 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
77 
slope and prevent ski damage. Be careful to not remove the entire snow surface down to bare ice 
because snow cushions and distributes loads during ski takeoffs and landings. If the resulting 
surface is acceptable, ski operations can begin after appropriate marking and certification. 
6.7.1.  Dragging. Dragging is required to remove sastrugi, ridges, or humps; grade undulating, 
uneven, or rough surface areas; and promote ice crystal deformation to harden the loose surface 
snow. Various types of drag devices have demonstrated effectiveness. 
6.7.2.  Cargo Loading Area Grooming. Groom the cargo loading area (Figure 6.2) to harden 
the surface prior to supporting cargo operations. 
6.7.3.  Periodic Maintenance. Maintaining the Skiway or SLA will require periodic dragging. 
Drag the Skiway or Ski Landing Area immediately after fresh snow accumulation, windstorms, 
or when ski landings/takeoffs have disturbed the surface. Regular inspections by the ground 
party and pilot reports will determine if dragging or other maintenance action is required.  
6.7.4.  Ski Landing Area Control Officer (SLACO) Certified Ski LZs. A SLACO will certify 
ski LZs with a snow surface over an ice substrate. The C2 will authorize as defined in 
applicable theater addenda. See paragraph 6.9 for further SLACO information. 
6.8.  Ski Airfield Markings and Layout. 
6.8.1.  Standard Operations. Mark skiways and ice runways in accordance with Figure 6.1, 
Figure 6.2 and Figure 6.3 Mark SLAs in accordance with Figure 6.5 The length and width of 
the marked area may vary with field elevation, snow conditions, operating gross weight and 
duration of use. Minimum length and width is 5,000 feet x 150 feet at sea level. Greater length 
and width may be required at higher elevations. 109th AW will coordinate with the supported 
agency to determine length and width for development of a particular Skiway. In addition to 
skiway markings, mark a cargo loading area (Figure 6.3). Locate a cargo loading area either 
adjacent to the skiway or further removed according to camp requirements. Accumulated cargo 
or other structures must not be closer than 75 feet from any skiway edges. Skiway markers are 
made from nylon mesh and mounted on bamboo poles (Figure 6.4). 
6.8.2.  Temporary Operations. Operations of a temporary nature requiring limited ski 
landings/takeoffs may not require skiway approach markings. The 109th AW, in coordination 
with the supported agency, will determine whether to establish an SLA or skiway for a 
particular operation. 
6.8.3.  Flagging Guidance. The primary differences between skiways and SLAs are the absence 
of lead-in flags and fewer marking flags for an SLA. 
6.8.3.1.  Skiway. Minimum flagging for a skiway should consist of the following (Figure 
6.1): 
6.8.3.1.1.  Mark the thresholds and midpoints with five red flags, laterally spaced, on 
each side. 
6.8.3.1.2.  Place three black flags for each grouping along the full length of both sides 
at 400-foot intervals. A clearly recognizable and contrasting number two (white is 
recommended) attached to inside flags on both sides of the skiway at 2,000 feet 
remaining from each Skiway departure end. 
78 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
6.8.3.2.  Ski Landing Area. Minimum flagging for a typical SLA should consist of the 
following (Figure 6.4): 
6.8.3.2.1.  The thresholds and midpoints will be marked with five red flags, laterally 
spaced, on each side. 
6.8.3.2.2.  Place two black flags for each grouping along the full length of both sides 
of the Ski Landing Area at 400-foot intervals. A clearly recognizable and contrasting 
number two (white is recommended) attached to inside flags on both sides of the SLA 
at 2,000 feet remaining from each SLA departure end. 
6.8.4.  NVG Operations in the Polar Regions. NVG lighting for operations may not coincide 
with AMP configurations. Due to the barren, featureless nature of polar and open-snow terrain, 
ski NVG lighting should more closely coincide with skiway and ski landing area flagging 
requirements. The aircrew will complete a table top review of the NVG lighting configuration 
prior to missions involving non-standard NVG lighting configurations. 
6.9.  Ski Landing Area Control Officer (SLACO).  SLACOs are typically highly experienced 
LC-130 pilots, navigators, or combat systems officers who evaluate LC-130 landing sites. The 109 
AW (ANG unit) develops and maintains procedures to train and certify SLACOs. Due to 
operational constraints, CCT/STO or polar field experts experienced in LC-130 operations and 
designated by LC-130 command authority may fulfill SLACO duties.

DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
107 
expertise is required by unit commands, contact and fund the US Army Corps of Engineers 
Reachback Operations Center (UROC) by email at uroc@usace.army.mil to send soil 
samples for laboratory analysis or to set up the AFSOC-ERDC Soils Training Course (e.g., 
training and equipment for the deliberate soils analysis method or classification of soils 
where freezing temperatures occur). 
A5.1.10.2.  Block 10B.  For semi-prepared and unprepared LZ, enter the controlling soil 
strength profile reading to include thickness and corresponding CBR of layers. Identify the 
controlling layer. Take strength tests to a minimum depth of 24-inches for the C-130 (and 
LTFW) and 36-inches for the C-17. Example: Surface: 7" CBR 14 (controlling layer)/ 
Subbase: 10" CBR 20/ Subgrade: CBR 45. Additionally, in block 14, remarks, enter the 
soil strength profile’s largest supportable type of aircraft (minimum), the corresponding 
allowable load/WBC and allowable passes. Additional aircraft may be entered. Example: 
C-17: 486K & 60 passes / C-130: 175K & 200 passes. When C-17 is the largest suitable 
aircraft enter the C-130 data as well. Use evaluation criteria of 1000 passes and max aircraft 
weight first to evaluate and report allowable load/WBC and allowable passes, (e.g., criteria 
provides the evaluation criteria beyond an initial surge and provides allowable loads to 
sustain aircraft throughout the anticipated operation of the LZ).  If mission requirement 
cannot be met and the requirement is to support an initial surge of mission aircraft then use 
expedient evaluation criteria of 100 passes and max aircraft weight for evaluation of WBC 
& allowable passes, (e.g., allowable loads increase while sustained operational capabilities 
of the LZ reduce).  NOTE: Also within remarks, report any surveyed semi-prepared and 
unprepared taxiway(s) and apron(s) respective data for each feature in the same format as 
runway is reported to include soil strength profile. For paved LZ enter PCN based on a C-
17, at 585K at 50,000 passes using shattered slab failure criteria.  Paved (asphalt or 
concrete) example: PCN 42/R/B/X/T.  Paved concrete shall not be evaluated as semi-
prepared. (T-1).  If it is paved asphalt (e.g., flexible), and the evaluated PCN does not meet 
operational requirement to support aircraft intended for use, it may be evaluated as semi-
prepared based on semi-prepared evaluation criteria to support mission requirements in 
accordance with paragraph 4.3.1.2.3 When asphalt LZ is evaluated as semi-prepared list 
the PCN and semi-prepared strength information together. Paved asphalt evaluated as 
semi-prepared example: PCN 14/F/A/W/T, C-17: 486K & 12,611 passes / C-130: 175K & 
74,366 passes. Also, within remarks, report soil strength profile and any surveyed paved 
taxiway(s) and apron(s) respective data for each feature in the same format as runway is 
reported. When paved concrete (e.g., rigid) PCN results yield unusable PCN or ACN/PCN 
ratio is questionable then evaluate the allowable gross weights and/or allowable pass 
calculation to determine structural suitability. Evaluate the airfield capability based upon 
mission requirements and compute allowable pass levels.  List new evaluation criteria in 
remarks.  Example evaluation criteria:  C-130: 175K & 5000 Passes, C-130: 155K & 1000 
passes, C-130: 135K & 250 Passes.  List resulting allowable load and passes based off 
evaluation criteria in remarks as they need to be correlated with evaluation criteria. 
Surveyors using the evaluation criteria may report all results or just the one result that is 
most usable. Additionally, in block 14, remarks, for rigid paved LZ (i.e., concrete), enter 
the controlling strength profile reading to for rigid pavement the same as semi-prepared, 
but for rigid include thickness and corresponding K-values of layers. Identify the 
controlling layer as the layer with lowest effective K-value. Take strength tests to a 
108 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
minimum depth of 24-inches for the C-130 (and LTFW) and 36-inches for the C-17. 
Example: Concrete:  10” / Base: 12" K 477 / Subgrade:  K 289 (Effective K 330).

listed in 7A for 11A and 11B. 
A5.1.11.1.  Block 11A.  Enter the runway designation and evaluated GSR for a runway 
based on primary approach/departure threshold derived by the most restrictive obstacle to 
air navigation within the controlling region. Enter for both runways, primary first. If 
glideslope is less restrictive than 99:1, list as “unrestricted” and do not report controlling 
obstacle in block 12I. 
A5.1.11.2.  Block 11B.  Enter the percentage of slope for the longitudinal gradient on the 
primary runway. Use “+” for upslope and “-” for downslope. If an effective gradient exists, 
enter in lieu of standard longitudinal gradient. 
A5.1.12.  Block 12  . 
A5.1.12.1.  Blocks 12A – 12H.  For primary runway enter average percentage of slope for 
the cross section gradient areas. List left and right runway values from centerline to each 
edge. Use “+” for upslope and “-” for downslope. For left/right A zones and left/right B 
zones, enter either “Unobstructed” or “Obstructed, See Remarks” if hazards exist within 
either or both (e.g., objects, berms, vegetation). Zones A and B require vertical obstruction 
analysis in accordance with Table 4.2 Gradient chart attachments are not required. (T-1). 
As applicable, when vertical clearance or gradient hazards exist on surveyed taxiway(s) 
and/or apron(s), report within blocks A and E and include “See Remarks.” and include

A6.1.9.  Block 9.*  Enter HLZ surface conditions (e.g., grass asphalt, fine dust, etc.). Exercise 
extreme care to document the possibility of brown or white out conditions, blowing grass, or 
any other flying debris that may restrict visibility or damage aircraft or personnel. Enter other 
hazards and remarks as required. For tactical HLZ, send hazards at a minimum if they exist. 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
117 
Though no inherent restrictions apply, the standard for communicating general vertical hazards 
to HLZ air navigation within remarks is by listing the following in each of four cardinal 
quadrants based on magnetic north; “Quadrant Controlling Obstacle:  GSR 9:1 or less = 
Obstructed/GSR 10:1 or more Unobstructed.” Example remarks and formats can be found in 
Figure A6.1. NOTE: this is not a comprehensive list of examples. Not all required. Examples 
may modified, added or removed to meet requirements. 
A6.1.10.  Block 10.  Provide detailed diagram of the HLZ. Diagram will be to scale and 
annotate HLZ dimensions. (T-2). A computer-generated diagram is desired but not required. 
At a minimum, display all prominent landmarks and man-made or natural features that may 
help identify the HLZ (e.g., roads, rivers, buildings). Indicate the recommended approach axis 
and include an arrow designating true north. Document and describe all hazards both within 
the boundaries of the HLZ (e.g., rocks, tree stumps, holes, depressions, mounds, fences, poles, 
trees, wires, ditches) as well as hazards to the approach (e.g., wires, towers, poles, trees). A 
remark in bold letters must be included if the potential for brown or white out conditions exist. 
(T-2). Unit HLZs used for day-to-day training should include aerial photography and/or 
imagery. Other HLZ surveys should be supplemented with aerial photography and/or imagery 
whenever possible. 
A6.1.11.  Block 11.  Annotate if photography is available. If available, surveyor, quality 
control, or safety of flight reviewer will attach photo product(s) with survey submission (T-3). 
Indicate whether a low level route is associated with the LZ. Individual completing the safety 
of flight review should know this information and will mark accordingly. (T-1). 
A6.2.  Host Nation HLZ Surveys.  For review of a HN HLZ survey in accordance with 
paragraph 5.4.2.5, validate as much source data as possible for the blocks in the AF Form 4303. 
At a minimum, safety of flight must review the following items: items 4B, 6, 7 and 8 and attach a 
copy of the host nation HLZ to the review. (T-1). NOTE: AF Form 4303 and tactical HLZ surveys 
and/or assessments conducted in accordance with this this manual by validated RAAF CCT HLZ 
Surveyors certified in accordance with paragraph 5.4.1.3 may be used for USAF and USSF 
operations.

Limit or report the following, where 
possible, within the exclusion area (T-2): 
The purpose of the exclusion area is to restrict 
development of facilities around the LZ. Only 
features required to operate the LZ or adjacent 
runways, such as operational surfaces (e.g., 
taxiways, aprons), navigational aids, airfield 
lights/signs, aircraft/support equipment and 
cargo loading and unloading areas/equipment, 
are permissible in the exclusion area. Personnel 
formations, encampments, parked vehicles, 
storage areas, buildings, etc. are excluded from 
this area. Roads, fences and trees are 
acceptable. The exclusion area is centered on 
the runway and extends the length of the 
runway plus 500’ beyond thresholds at each 
end. For long-term use LZs, restricting use of 
available land beyond the minimum distances 
listed here is highly recommended. The goal is 
to provide the greatest margin of safety for 
personnel, equipment and facilities. For cases 
where a training LZ may be sited near 
permanently occupied facilities or where new 
facilities may be sited near a LZ, use 305 
meters (1,000') wide exclusion area.

potential LZs that cannot accommodate the dimensions for a generic LTFW category for a specific 
aircraft’s criteria (e.g., C-145A), however this may restrict use by other aircraft types. Paragraph 
A9.2 provides LTFW runway width and lateral obstruction clearance criteria formulas utilized to 
identify minimum requirements for specific LTFW airframes.

Notes: 
1. Surveyors should maximize semi-prepared runway widths to allow LZ 
controllers/pilots to offset landing points and reduce surface rutting on semi-prepared 
surfaces. If vertical obstacles exist near the edge of a paved/prepared surface, reduce the 
published width to place these obstacles outside the A/B zones of the surveyed LZ.  
2. Runway length should be as long as possible to accommodate multiple aircraft types 
and potential need for displaced threshold for various glide slope ratio requirements.  
130 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
A9.2.  LTFW Runway Width and Lateral Obstruction Clearance Formulas.  Minimum 
runway width for LTFW is 200% of wheel track. Specific LTFW airframes may require wider 
runways for routine/normal operations or based on crew qualification. Lateral obstruction 
clearance criteria formula is based A and B zones. Base the size (width) of these zones on aircraft 
wing span and wheel track and determined using the formulas provided in AFSOC Figure A9.1. 
Zone A extends outward from the edge of the surveyed runway width. Zone B extends outward 
from the outside edge of zone A. Figure A9.2 depicts the zone A/B locations. 
Figure A9.1.  Zone A and B Formulas. 
 
Figure A9.2.  Zone A and Zone B Locations. 
 
A9.2.1.  It is acceptable to conduct operations on a LZ whose survey lists a zone B width that 
is less than the aircraft’s stated requirement, provided the zone A width listed on the survey 
exceeds the aircraft’s minimum requirement by an equal or greater distance. For example, a C-
145A may operate on a LZ with a 31' zone A and a 7' zone B. In this case the zone B is 3" less 
than required but the zone A is 5" greater than required. 
A9.2.1.1.  Expand insufficient Zone A and/or Zone B survey distances by reducing runway 
width by an equal amount, down to the minimum runway width requirement. For example, 
a C-146A aircrew desires to land at a LZ with a runway that is 40' wide, with zone As of 
28' and zone Bs of 7'. The LZ zone A is 11" less than the C-146A requirement of 28' and 
11". The crew may land at the LZ by treating only 38' of runway width as useable and 
adding 1' to both zones. The portion of the runway outside this adjusted width will be 
treated as unusable. (T-2). 
A9.2.2.  Surveyors and LZSO shall report detailed information on any/all vertical obstructions 
located within zones A and B (e.g., number and type of obstructions, distance from edge of 
surveyed LZ or runway centerline, height above cross-sectional runway edge elevation, etc.). 
(T-2). 
A9.2.2.1.  Maximum obstacle height for LTFW aircraft. For semi-prepared surface 
taxiways and runways, obstacles will not be higher than values listed below unless the 
aircraft flight manual, pilot operating handbook, or aircraft addendum to this manual is 
more restrictive. (T-2).

Table A9.4.  C-146 Semi-prepared Aggregate Surface Strength Chart. 
 
A9.3.  Semi-Prepared Operations Planning.  Recurring use of a LZ with reduced strength risks 
increased potential for LZ surface distress. Operation planners may base planned operations 
around LZ survey strength to theorize a number of operational cycles before potential surface 
distress levels could negatively impact operations; Use the planned number of aircraft and 
configuration(s) and reported semi-prepared survey strength to identify predicted number of 
cycles. A single aircraft cycle consists of a single aircraft landing, all taxi and single takeoff. 
Aircraft cycles are not required to be reported nor tracked, and the distress level is theorized. 
Therefore, operations planning does not replace the requirement for assessment conducted in 
accordance with paragraph 4.3.3, it is not required in the LZ survey process, and it is not required 
for survey approval. Use surveyed controlling CBR profile and/or WBC/allowable passes to 
directly correlate cycles. Use Figure A9.3 for assistance to conduct evaluations.

A9.4.  LZ Skid Test Procedures.  In the absence of pilot reported RCR/braking action, the goal 
of conducting the skid tests is to accurately characterize the on-site friction supply (or skid 
resistance) of an unpaved airfield. Layout an adequate number of skid tests to be conducted in 
several locations on the airfield that, when averaged, will adequately represent the skid resistance 
of the runway surface. (T-2). Time permitting, and/or as required, eight tests are recommended for 
the typical contingency airfield (4000'x90', Figure A9.4, as an example) which should take 
approximately a half hour:

A9.4.1.  Target speed at braking will always be 20 MPH and ensure enough space for run-up. 
(T-2). At braking locations, push on the brake as hard as possible to lock up all four tires and 
then skid to a complete stop (may require turning off ABS. Use of e-brake in conjunction with 
braking may also highlight effective skid-mark.) For the cycle and ATVs, lock up the BACK 
BRAKES ONLY, as it is unsafe to lock up both the front and back brakes. Use Table A9.13 
to report average.

A9.5.2.  Step 2. Select samples areas to inspect. As a minimum for contingency operations, 
inspect the sections in the touchdown area, in the primary braking area at approximately 1000 
to 1500 feet, at the point of aircraft rotation at approximately 2000 to 2500 feet and at the last 
500 feet of the runway. (The point of rotation may move due to pressure and altitude changes.) 
These sections include the areas most likely to be damaged by landing, braking, stopping, 
acceleration and takeoff for the runway in use. Inspect and monitor additional areas where 
degradation develops. 
A9.5.3.  Step 3. Inspect sample areas and record any identified distresses as in figure A9.6 
Conduct as detailed and accurate an inspection as time and conditions permit. Note all 
distresses and the appropriate severity levels for each, see table A9.15.

Notes: If the pavement section is in relatively good condition with only low-severity distresses scattered 
across the section, which does not require more than routine maintenance to maintain aircraft operations, the 
pavement is considered in Green (good) condition. However, if medium-severity distresses were present in 
addition to the low-severity distresses, or the section requires routine to major repair to maintain operations, 
then rate the section Amber (fair). If high-severity distresses are prevalent, and the pavement requires constant 
maintenance and repairs to maintain operations, then consider the pavement Red (poor). When the condition of 
the airfield approaches Red inspect it before and after each aircraft operation. 
A9.5.4.  Step 4. Assign distress deduct values to each distress type identified, Total the distress 
educt values, and compute sample area SPACI, see Figures A9.6 and Figure A9.7 The deduct 
values for sections located on the runway/taxiway are different than the deduct values for 
sections located on aprons/hammerheads.

A9.5.5.  Step 5. Average sample area SPACI values to determine section SPACI. Example 
figure A9.9. If samples were inspected at the touchdown, maximum braking, turnaround and 
point of rotation areas on the runway and the individual sample area SPACI values were 63, 
67, 55 and 71; the runway SPACI is 64. 
Figure A9.9.  SPACI Curves. 
 
A9.5.6.  Step 6. Average section SPACIs to determine airfield SPACI, if desired. A SPACI of 
76 - 100 is rated “Green”. A SPACI of 26 – 75 is rated “Amber”. A SPACI of 0 - 25 is rated 
“Red”. Maintain training LZs in “Green” condition. Maintain contingency LZs in “Green” or 
“Amber” condition. Regardless of the overall SPACI rating, if any individual distress is rated 
as “Red”, the LZSO will determine the feasibility of each operation.

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE CONCERNING DZS 
A10.1.  MEW Procedures. 
A10.1.1.  Inflate the 10-gram balloon with helium to a circumference of 57 inches for day and 
74 inches for night. Substitute two 60 inch balloons tied together if unable to inflate balloon to 
74 inches. The increase in size at night compensates for the weight of a small marking light 
attached to the balloon. 
A10.1.2.  Two types of marking lights are authorized: One type activates upon immersion in 
water, then affixes to the balloon; the other type is commonly known as a chemical light and 
measures six inches in length. NOTE: Using a chemical light other than the 6-inch size will 
result in inaccurate mean effective wind measurement. (T-2).  
A10.1.3.  Time the balloon ascent from release to the required altitude. The ascension tables 
reflect the ascent times required for the balloon to reach various altitudes. This method is also 
used to estimate the base altitude of cloud layers by determining the ascension time for the 
balloon until obscured by the cloud base. 
A10.1.4.  During ascent, note unusual movement by the balloon; unusual movement indicates 
erratic wind conditions. Include the altitude of these occurrences, if significant, in the MEW 
report to the aircraft. 
A10.1.5.  When the balloon reaches drop altitude, measure the elevation angle using a pocket 
transit, theodolite, clinometer, or any other accurate means available. 
A10.1.6.  Measure the magnetic azimuth to the balloon, and note the reciprocal heading. The 
noted reciprocal heading is the MEW wind direction. 
A10.1.7.  Referring to the scale on the left side of Table A10.1, locate the angle that 
corresponds to the angle measured. Move horizontally across the table to the vertical column 
that corresponds to the drop altitude being used. The value at the intersection of these two lines 
is the MEW wind speed in knots. 
A10.1.8.  When transmitting the MEW, make sure to identify it as the “mean effective wind” 
and include the altitude to which it was taken. Phraseology: “TALON ZERO ONE, MEAN 
EFFECTIVE WIND AT (DROP ALTITUDE AGL), ESTIMATED THREE FIVE ZERO AT 
ONE NINER.” At that time, report any indication(s) of erratic winds or wind shear.

A10.3.  GMRS Marking Considerations. 
A10.3.1.  DZ markings must be clearly visible to the aircrew on approach as early as possible. 
(T-2). If conditions preclude placing the markings at the computed point, the DZC may have 
to adjust the location of the intended PI, ensuring compliance with the requirements in Table 
3.1, Table 3.2, Figure 3.1, Figure 3.3, Figure 3.4 and Figure A10.1 Advise both the aircrew 
and user of the change in PI location. 
156 
DAFMAN13-217  22 APRIL 2021 
A10.3.2.  When conducting operations requiring security, night DZ markings should only be 
visible from the direction of the aircraft’s approach. If using flashlights, equip them with 
simple hoods or shields and aimed toward the approaching aircraft. Screen omni-directional 
lights, fires, or improvised flares on three sides or place in pits with the sides sloping toward 
the direction of approach. 
A10.3.3.  During daylight airdrops, the marker panels may be slanted at a 45-degree angle from 
the surface toward the aircraft approach path to increase the aircrew's ability to see them, 
smoke (other than red) may be displayed at the release point or corner marker to assist in 
aircrew DZ acquisition. 
A10.4.  GMRS: Determining PI Location. 
A10.4.1.  After selecting the DZ, calculate the dispersion distance, as stated below, then select 
a PI that is compatible with the calculated point and the tactical situation. Once the PI has been 
determined, calculate the forward throw distance and wind drift effect to determine the release 
point. 
A10.4.2.  Dispersion distance is the total distance within the impact area where troops or cargo 
will land. (T-1). It is in a direct line with the aircraft’s line of flight and is dependent upon 
aircraft speed and load exit time (the length of time required for the first through the last object 
to clear the aircraft). The formula for calculating dispersion is: ½S x E = L, where S = aircraft 
speed in knots, E = exit time in seconds, and L = length of dispersion in yards. This calculation 
is normally used to assist with placing the PI, rather than determining the release point. 
A10.4.3.  Wind drift is the lateral movement of a parachute through the air caused by the wind. 
The distance of the wind drift is measured on a direct line from the parachute’s fully deployed 
opening point to its actual PI on the ground. Calculate this drift using the formula; D = KAV, 
where D = drift in meters, K = the load drift constant, A = drop altitude in hundreds of feet 
(i.e., 1,000 feet = 10) and V = wind velocity in knots. Table A10.2 depicts the constants for 
different airdrop loads. 
A10.4.4.  Forward throw distance is the distance along the aircraft flight path traveled by a 
parachutist or cargo container after exiting the aircraft, until the parachute fully opens and the 
load is descending vertically. Refer to Table A10.3.

the markers will remain visible to the aircrew. (T-2). 
A10.5.  GMRS: Marking Placement Techniques. 
A10.5.1.  Step 1.  Stand on the PI facing toward the direction from which the aircraft will 
approach (reciprocal of DZ axis). (T-2). 
A10.5.2.  Step 2.  Pace off the distance calculated for forward travel distance. Record the 
position coordinates as a GPS markpoint/waypoint. 
A10.5.3.  Step 3.  Face directly into the wind. Pace off into the direction of the wind the 
distance calculated for wind drift. This is the actual release point. 
A10.5.4.  Step 4.  Face into the direction from which the aircraft will approach (reciprocal of 
DZ axis), turn 90 degrees to the right and pace off 100 meters (110 yards) for the offset. (T-2). 
Place the corner or first panel at this point. 
A10.5.5.  Step 5.  Adjust the release point for wind direction/velocity changes by returning to 
GPS markpoint/waypoint and following steps above. 
A10.5.6.  Step 6.  Establish the ground markings as shown in Figure 3.5.
