Chapter 1 
GENERAL OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Overview.  DSCA support is provided by military forces to prevent, prepare for, protect 
against, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents and other qualifying domestic events.  
DAF DSCA is derived from DAF warfighting capabilities employed in support of (ISO) the federal 
DSCA mission.  This instruction provides higher headquarters staffs, installations and unit 
commanders with guidance, structure, roles, and responsibilities to execute Defense Support of 
Civil Authorities (DSCA) planning, response operations and support to designated agencies when 
requested by civil authorities and other qualifying entities and approved by appropriate 
Department of Defense (DoD) officials, or as directed by the President.  In the event they are 
federalized, Air National Guard (ANG) personnel should be familiar with this publication to have 
a clear understanding of the DAF DSCA response process. 
1.2.  Concept.  DSCA is initiated through the submission of a request for assistance (RFA) to DoD 
from civil authorities or qualifying entities, or as directed by the President or Secretary of Defense 
(SecDef).  DoD federal military forces, civilians, contract personnel, and National Guard (NG) 
personnel (federalized in Title 10, United States Code (USC.) status, or as coordinated with State 
Governors under Title 32 USC. status) are used to support an approved RFA.  The Joint Staff (JS) 
coordinates with the DAF (and other services) to source appropriate resources to fulfill an 
approved RFA.  DAF personnel, equipment, and resources are sourced based on requested 
capabilities, with regard for impact on national security and readiness.  Federal government 
support of civil authorities is executed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
Assistance Act (“The Stafford Act”), 42 USC. § 5121-5207; The Economy Act, 31 USC. § 1535, 
and Immediate Response Authority (IRA) outlined in Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 
3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). 
1.2.1.  The Stafford Act authorizes the federal government to assist state and local governments 
during major disasters or emergencies where those state and local resources have been or will 
be overwhelmed.  The governor or chief executive of the affected state, district, 
commonwealth, territory, or tribal authority requests the declaration of major disaster or 
emergency and demonstrates, as a prerequisite for receiving assistance, that the state’s 
response plans have been activated, and that state and local entities require assistance for an 
effective response.  Once the President issues a federal disaster declaration, the affected area 
becomes eligible for federal assistance under the Stafford Act. 
1.2.2.  DoDD 3025.18, authorizes DoD officials to use IRA when a RFA is made by a civil 
authority under imminently serious conditions and time does not permit approval from higher 
headquarters.  Immediate response is situation-specific and may or may not be associated with 
a declared or undeclared disaster, civil emergency, incident, or attack.  Civil authority oral 
requests for IRA support in an emergency are followed by written request at the earliest 
opportunity, to include an offer(s) to reimburse the DoD. 
1.3.  Overarching DSCA Guidance.  DAF integration into DSCA operations is consistent with 
the NRF and NIMS.  In addition to the NRF, DAF members supporting DSCA operations are 
responsible for familiarization with other national planning frameworks.  These frameworks are 
aligned in five mission areas (prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery). 
DAFI10-801  26 FEBRUARY 2025

1.4.  Overview of DSCA Response Phases.  DSCA is provided in the following DoD/Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) construct: Phase 1: Pre-Incident; (1a) - Normal 
Operations, (1b) - Elevated Threat, (1c) - Credible Threat; Phase 2: Response; (2a) - Initial 
Response, (2b) - Deployment of Resources and Personnel, (2c) - Sustained Response; and Phase 
3: Recovery and Transition.  Aligning DSCA phases with the Lead Federal Agency (LFA) phasing 
construct is beneficial for coordination. 
1.4.1.  Phase 1 (pre-incident).  Actions include interagency coordination, planning, 
identification of gaps, exercises, and public affairs outreach.  These actions set the conditions 
for expanded interoperability and cooperation with interagency partners.  There are three sub-
phases in Phase 1. 
1.4.1.1.  Phase 1a (normal operations).  Local, state, federal, and military authorities (Title 
10 USC. and Title 32 USC.) determine existing logistics and resource capabilities, develop 
plans and procedures, and conduct training and exercises to validate existing plans.  
Actions are focused on awareness and national preparedness goals: prevent, protect, 
mitigate, respond, and recover. 
1.4.1.2.  Phase 1b (elevated threat).  Allows for further coordination and planning, or 
revisions, based on the current situation.  Analyze situation reports ensuring interagency 
partners’ (including defense coordinating officers (DCO) and emergency preparedness 
liaison officers (EPLO)) planning for potential activations and integration into planning 
efforts. 
1.4.1.3.  Phase 1c (credible threat).  Further assessment with plan updates or revisions with 
additional stakeholders.  Consider pre-positioning selected-response forces to facilitate a 
faster response. 
1.4.2.  Phase 2 (response).  Begins when DoD receives, or expects to receive, a RFA from 
LFA.  In place of a RFA, the President or SecDef may direct federal response support for a 
disaster or national emergency ISO state or tribal government(s), or to support another federal 
department or agency for specifically authorized events.  Phase 2 ends when the situation is 
stabilized, and support is no longer required.  There are three sub-phases in Phase 2. 
1.4.2.1.  Phase 2a (initial response).  Begins upon expectation or receipt of a LFA RFA for 
DoD support.  Key activities during Phase 2a are activation of emergency management 
(EM) structures, assessment of the situation, and movement of pre-planned resources.  
Local commanders may also exercise IRA during this phase upon request from an 
appropriate civil authority.  DSCA is based on RFAs, which are made at different times 
and for missions that are completed at different times.  Consequently, forces are likely to 
deploy into and out of the affected area throughout the duration of the civil emergency 
period of rendered support.

DAFI10-801  26 FEBRUARY 2025 
1.4.2.2.  Phase 2b (deployment of resources and personnel).  Begins with the start of 
lifesaving operations in the impacted area and federal resources begin joint reception, 
staging, onward movement, and integration (JRSOI) at intermediate staging bases.  Key 
activities include:  locate the affected population, evacuate, provide life-sustaining support 
services, stabilize communications and channels connecting responders to the public that 
are in-place and operational, and characterize the incident and deploying federal resources.  
Phase 2b success is achieved when forces are deployed with sufficient capability to support 
civil authorities. 
1.4.2.3.  Phase 2c (sustained response).  Begins when survivors, having been evacuated, 
are sustained through mass-care and recovery efforts.  Search and rescue operations have 
transitioned to human remains recovery.  Phase 2c ends when survivors are sheltered or 
cleared to return home, the restoration of critical infrastructure including key resources and 
essential services has been completed, and senior leaders have made preliminary decisions 
about a recovery plan for the impacted area. 
1.4.3.  Phase 3 (recovery and transition).  Begins when lifesaving and life-sustaining activities 
have been stabilized, as determined by civil authorities, and local, state and federal resources 
are sufficient to continue without DoD assistance.  DoD sometimes supports specific aspects 
of recovery.  Transition begins when all operational aspects of mission assignments are 
complete and DoD force redeployment commences.  Phase 3 ends when DoD response forces 
have transitioned all operations back to civil authorities and have redeployed with command 
and control transferred to their respective home station commands. 
1.5.  Overview of Higher Headquarters Organizations.

Chapter 3 
DAF RESPONSE, RESOURCES, REPORTING, AND REIMBURSEMENT IN DSCA 
3.1.  DAF Response in DSCA Operations and RFA Process.  DSCA operations are divided into 
three broad categories: 1) domestic emergencies, 2) designated law enforcement support, and 3) 
other activities.  Civil authority RFAs are provided to the DoD ExecSec and when applicable, 
includes a commitment to reimburse IAW the Stafford Act or the Economy Act.  Civil authority 
RFAs are evaluated by all DAF officials using CARRLL criteria [Cost (including the source of 
funding and the effect on the DAF budget), Appropriateness (whether providing the requested 
support is in the best interest of the DAF), Risk (safety of DAF personnel), Readiness (impact on 
the DAF’s ability to perform its other primary missions), Legality (compliance with laws), and 
Lethality (potential use of lethal force by or against DAF forces)].  See Figure 3.1., Figure 3.2, 
and Figure 3.3.  Commanders or government employees making or authorizing obligations in 
advance of or in excess of an appropriation or apportioned budgetary resources may trigger a 
reportable Anti-Deficiency Act violation. 
3.1.1.  RFA Submission.  DoD support is provided in response to requests from civil authorities 
for DoD capabilities to support their emergency response efforts using a formal RFA process.  
RFA processing depends on several factors (outlined in Figure 3.2.). 
3.1.2.  RFA Validation.  When a DCO is activated, RFAs are routed through the DCO and 
provided to the DSCA GCCs for review/awareness and then submitted to ASD(HD&HA).  
Once the SecDef approves the request, an order is issued to CCMDs, services, or agencies to 
accomplish the mission.  The decision process differs significantly for approving Stafford and 
non-Stafford RFAs (outlined in Figure 3.3.).  Requests are validated at all levels within the 
chain of command and evaluated using CARRLL criteria.  JS/J3 prepares an order and 
coordinates with necessary force providers, legal counsel, and DASD(HDI&DSCA) to ensure 
asset de-confliction and recommendation concurrence. 
3.1.3.  DCO and DCE Actions.  The DCO is supported by DCE with an administrative and 
support staff consisting of nine permanently assigned personnel.  A DCO and DCE assigned 
to the FEMA regional office functions as part of the RRCC or the Joint Field Office (when 
established).  Upon receipt of the RFA, the DCO evaluates the request to determine if it meets 
DoD’s validation criteria using CARRLL. 
3.1.3.1.  The DCO ensures the RFA is readily understandable, and clearly describes the 
requirement and requested support.  If the RFA does request specified capability, the DCO 
with support from the DCE, coordinates with the requesting agency, and recommends 
appropriate edits to the RFA.  If the DCO determines the RFA does not meet the evaluation 
criteria or is unable to support the request, the DCO returns the RFA to the requesting 
agency with an explanation why the RFA cannot be supported.  Once the RFA is complete, 
the DCO validates the request. 
3.1.3.2.  After the DCO validates the RFA, a copy of the RFA is forwarded to the supported 
CCMD headquarters’ operations center along with a recommendation for action if the 
requested support has been previously approved or is forwarded to the JS/J3 and 
ASD(HD&HA) for further validation/assessment and approval/disapproval. 
20 
DAFI10-801  26 FEBRUARY 2025 
3.1.3.3.  The DCO and DCE coordinate with the NG JFHQ-State or JTF-State headquarters 
element and CCMD federal military operational headquarters supporting the response 
effort to determine if non-federalized and federal military forces already deployed are 
capable and available to provide the assistance requested within the scope of the original 
mission statement, as well as cost allocations. 
3.1.3.4.  For WR missions, Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance, All Hurricanes (CARCAH) 
publishes the appropriate tropical cyclone or winter season plan of the day (POD), which 
is the validated and approved RFAs from the requesting agency for WR missions. 
3.1.4.  JS/J3 Actions.  Normally JS/J3, upon receipt of the RFA, coordinates the request with 
the supported CCMD, supporting CCMDs, military departments and applicable combat 
support agencies.  Once coordination is complete, JS/J3 sends the RFA to ASD(HD&HA) for 
final review and, if recommended, the action is coordinated with the NGB to ensure there is 
no duplication of effort between the NG and the Active Component.  The ASD(HD&HA) then 
passes the RFA to the SecDef for decision.  Upon SecDef approval, JS/J3 tasks the services to 
source the capabilities. If forces are available, the Services may be directed to provide the 
requested support immediately. 
3.1.4.1.  Stafford Act requests, in some circumstances, originate from the State EOC, 
FEMA RRCC, or the NRCC and pass directly to the JS/J3 or the DoD ExecSec, rather than 
routing through a DCO.  These RFAs are processed the same as non-Stafford Act requests, 
with JS/J3 and the operational headquarters conducting parallel coordination and providing 
a recommendation to ASD(HD&HA) and the SecDef for decision.  In all cases, the 
supported CCDR and the affected DCO are notified to limit redundant coordination of 
resources. 
3.1.4.2.  The SecDef approved a “standing” CJCS DSCA EXORD, released by JS/J3 that 
designates supported and supporting CCDRs, identifies potential DoD capabilities, and 
tasks force providers to provide the necessary support.  The response measures are taken 
by DoD to fulfill unmet demands of the incident, IAW current laws, Presidential directives, 
executive orders, and DoD policies, directives, and orders. 
3.1.5.  USNORTHCOM or USINDOPACOM, as the operational headquarters for DSCA 
missions, provide a supporting operation order, implementing a concept of operations plan, if 
available, and establish command relationships to provide task, purpose, and coordinating 
instructions to the supporting force.  It is important DAF personnel understand their role in 
DSCA. 
3.1.5.1.  Since DSCA missions may involve lifesaving responses, this process is rapidly 
executed to expedite movement of forces and support.  DoD cannot provide support 
without SecDef approval of an official request from state or federal agency, or direction 
from the President, or unless specifically authorized in existing policy or regulation.  If a 
disaster is of such proportions to generate mass casualties in need of evacuation, DoD 
supports the primary agency for this function under the National Disaster Medical System 
(NDMS) (once the NDMS has been activated and an official request for patient evacuation 
will be submitted by proper State authorities). 
 
 
DAFI10-801  26 FEBRUARY 2025

3.1.5.2.  The 
CCDRs 
responsible 
for 
DSCA 
are 
CDRUSNORTHCOM 
and 
CDRUSINDOPACOM.  Each incorporates plans for DSCA by task organizing their 
commands to accomplish these missions and other assigned missions.  DoD is a signatory 
to numerous response plans and memoranda of understanding or agreement with other 
agencies.

3.2.  Categories of DSCA operations. 
3.2.1.  Domestic Emergencies.  The DAF provides support to a primary agency or LFA in 
response to RFAs resulting from a domestic emergency, including complex catastrophes.  
Domestic emergencies include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, man-made disasters, 
civil disturbances, and CBRN events.  DAF support is provided for domestic emergencies 
under four authorities: 1) Stafford Act, 2) Economy Act, 3) Immediate Response Authority, 
and 4) Search and Rescue (SAR) coordinator authority (exclusive to SAR conducted in a 
DSCA environment). 
3.2.2.  Support under the Stafford Act. 
24 
DAFI10-801  26 FEBRUARY 2025 
3.2.2.1.  DAF units are directed by the President to perform emergency duties on public or 
private lands essential for the preservation of life or property resulting from a major disaster 
IAW 42 USC. § 5170b(c)(1). 
3.2.2.2.  Under this authority, prior to and in anticipation of a Presidential declaration of 
emergency, the DAF carries out response activities for a period not to exceed 10 days, 
absent other authority. 
3.2.3.  Support under the Economy Act.  The Economy Act is a mechanism that authorizes 
reimbursement when DoD provides direct support to other federal agencies.  The Economy 
Act does not authorize the provision of any direct support to state or local entities. 
3.2.4.  Support under Immediate Response Authority.  DoDD 3025.18 authorizes DoD 
officials to use IRA when a RFA is made by civil authority, under imminently serious 
conditions and if time does not permit approval from higher authority.  DoD officials may 
provide an immediate response by temporarily employing the resources under their control, 
subject to any supplemental direction provided by higher headquarters, to save lives, prevent 
human suffering, or mitigate great property damage within the United States.  Immediate 
response is situation-specific and may or may not be associated with a declared or undeclared 
disaster, civil emergency, incident, or attack.  For assistance provided, civil authorities shall 
be informed that oral requests for assistance in an emergency must be followed by a written 
request that includes an offer to reimburse DoD at the earliest available opportunity. 
3.2.4.1.  DAF officials must exercise judgment based on available information and 
resources in determining the maximum allowable distance from the installation or facility 
the immediate response may take place.  DoD officials should consider challenges such as 
sustainment, transportation, communications, mission impact, and increased risk. 
3.2.4.2.  Before responding to a civilian authority’s RFA, DAF officials should, unless 
otherwise directed by a higher authority, prioritize resources to DoD requirements first and 
then to address civilian authority requests. 
3.2.4.3.  The civil authority’s request for immediate response should be directed to the 
installation commander or other appropriate DAF official responsible for the installation, 
with further dissemination as needed. 
3.2.4.4.  The DAF official directing a response under immediate response authority shall 
immediately notify the National Joint Operations and Intelligence Center (NJOIC), through 
the chain of command, of the details of the response. The NJOIC will inform the 
appropriate DoD components, including the geographic CCMD and ASD(HD&HA). 
3.2.4.5.  An immediate response shall end when the necessity giving rise to the response is 
no longer present (e.g., when there are sufficient resources available from State, local, and 
other federal agencies to respond adequately and that agency or department has initiated 
response activities) or when the initiating DAF official or a higher authority directs an end 
to the response. The DAF official directing a response under IRA shall reassess whether 
there remains a necessity for the DoD to respond under this authority as soon as practicable 
but, if immediate response activities have not yet ended, not later than 72 hours after the 
RFA was received. 
DAFI10-801  26 FEBRUARY 2025

3.2.4.6.  Support provided under IRA should be provided on a cost-reimbursable basis, 
where appropriate or legally required, but will not be delayed or denied based on the 
inability or unwillingness of the requester to make a commitment to reimburse the DoD. 
3.2.4.7.  IAW AFMAN 11-501, Attachment 9, O-6 level installation commanders are 
delegated UAS utilization for IRA within airspace delegated by the FAA for DoD use 
provided: 
3.2.4.7.1.  UAS utilized are restricted to UAS Groups 1, 2 and 3, as categorized by JP 
3-30, Joint Air Operations.  (T-0) 
3.2.4.7.2.  Missions under IRA are executed IAW DoDD 3025.18. 
3.2.5.  Civil Disturbance Operations (CDO).  Civil disturbances are acts of violence by groups 
causing disorder prejudicial to public law and order that includes riots, acts of violence, 
insurrections, and unlawful obstructions or assemblages. 
3.2.5.1.  Military forces are not used to quell civil disturbances unless specifically 
authorized by the President or permitted under emergency authority as authorized by 
DoDD 3025.18.  (T-0) Normally, this authorization is through the issuance of an Executive 
Order or other Presidential Directive authorizing and directing the SecDef to provide for 
the restoration of law-and-order IAW 10 USC. §§ 251-255 in a specific state or locality.  
Commanders have emergency authority in extraordinary circumstances where prior 
authorization by the President is impossible and duly constituted local authorities are 
unable to control the situation, to engage temporarily in activities that are necessary to quell 
large-scale, unexpected civil disturbances because: 
3.2.5.1.1.  Such activities are necessary to prevent significant loss of life or wanton 
destruction of property and are necessary to restore governmental function and public 
order; or, 
3.2.5.1.2.  When duly constituted federal, State, or local authorities are unable or 
decline to provide adequate protection for federal property or federal governmental 
functions. Federal action, including the use of federal military forces, is authorized 
when necessary to protect the federal property or functions. 
3.2.5.2.  Responsibility for the management of the federal response to civil disturbances 
rests with the attorney general.  Any employment of forces ISO law enforcement operations 
maintains the primacy of civilian authority.  The attorney general is responsible for 
receiving state requests for federal military assistance, coordinating such requests with the 
SecDef and other appropriate federal officials, and presenting such requests to the 
President, who determines federal action.  Refer to DAFI 31-118, Security Forces 
Standards and Procedures, for guidance concerning the use of deputized State or local law 
enforcement powers by DoD uniformed law enforcement personnel, and DAFI 31-117, 
Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, for guidance on the use of force. 
3.2.5.3.  Military members will not take charge of any function of civil government unless 
absolutely necessary under conditions of extreme emergency in the case of large-scale, 
unexpected civil disturbances.  (T-0)  Any commander who is directed, or undertakes, such 
functions must limit military actions to emergency circumstances and facilitate the 
reestablishment of civil responsibility at the earliest time possible.

3.2.10.  Other Activities. 
3.2.10.1.  DoD personnel support other activities as NSSE (when identified by the 
President or Secretary of Homeland Security), or other lesser significant events as 
designated by the Special Events Working Group with SEAR.  Other activities include, but 
not limited to, Olympics support, World Fairs, the Super Bowl, inaugurations, state 
funerals, and national conventions.  Regardless of the activity, agencies use the RFA 
process.  SEARs have the following designations: 
3.2.10.1.1.  Level 1.  A Level 1 event is of significant national and/or international 
importance that may require extensive federal interagency security and incident 
management preparedness. 
3.2.10.1.2.  Level 2.  A Level 2 event is a significant event with national and/or 
international importance that may require direct national-level federal support and 
situational awareness. 
3.2.10.1.3.  Level 3.  A Level 3 event is an event of national and/or international 
importance that requires only limited direct federal support to augment local 
capabilities.

3.3.  DAF Resources in DSCA Operations. 
3.3.1.  DAF personnel in Title 10 USC. status employed in DSCA operations remain under 
federal military command and control.  This requirement may be satisfied by a designated dual-
status commander who is recognized by both federal and state command lines. 
3.3.2.  In circumstances that do not warrant IRA, base facilities are made available to federal, 
state or local civilian officials to include law enforcement IAW DAFMAN 23-119, 
Government Furnished Property; and AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force 
Real Property. 
3.3.3.  Medical Treatment Facility laboratories that are members of, or participate in, the 
Laboratory Response Network (LRN) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are 
authorized to accept specimens from non-DoD healthcare beneficiaries that are referred IAW 
the procedures and mission of the LRN during actual or potential public health emergencies.  
Laboratory analysis is conducted using LRN protocols and tests within the limits of the 
Secretarial Designee Program. 
3.3.4.  Active component, DoD civilian employees, and personal service contractor healthcare 
professionals are granted license portability and may practice their profession if ordered by a 
commander to do so, at any location in any State, the District of Columbia, or a commonwealth, 
territory, or possession of the United States as long as: 
3.3.4.1.  The healthcare professional is under the jurisdiction of DoD, including NG 
personnel performing training or duty under Title 32 USC. § 502(f), and the work is in 
response to an actual or potential disaster, including activities under IRA. 
3.3.4.2.  All licensure(s), certification(s), and/or registration(s) are current, valid, and 
unrestricted. 
3.3.4.3.  The healthcare provider has current clinical competencies to perform the 
professional duties assigned. 
3.3.4.4.  The military treatment facilities of assignment coordinate with the Licensing 
Board for the State in which the disaster occurs, when practicable. 
3.3.5.  Standing DSCA EXORD.  CJCS publishes a SecDef approved Standing DSCA 
EXORD 
delegating 
limited 
approval 
authority 
to 
CDRUSNORTHCOM 
and 
CDRUSINDOPACOM for DSCA operations to provide a rapid and flexible response by DoD.  
This DSCA EXORD does not govern response to CBRN incidents.  CBRN response is 
governed by a separate SecDef approved CBRN EXORD. 
3.3.6.  Planning and execution are subject to priorities established by the President or the 
SecDef. DSCA planning and execution adheres to the following guidelines: 
3.3.6.1.  A basic premise of the NRF is that incidents are generally handled at the lowest 
jurisdictional level possible.  In most incidents, local resources provide the first line of 
emergency response and incident management support. 
 
 
30 
DAFI10-801  26 FEBRUARY 2025 
3.3.6.1.1.  The NG may be the first military force to respond to support first responders 
when local capabilities are exhausted, and the incident response is elevated to the State 
level.  In this capacity, the NG is in SAD or 32 USC. status.  As an integrated and 
supporting organization of a State’s EM response, the NG supports the incident 
commander IAW the NIMS. 
3.3.6.1.2.  Should the State’s resources become exhausted, the governor of the affected 
(supported) State may request interstate mutual aid through the Emergency 
Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) system.  EMAC is a collaborative 
arrangement among member States that provide a legal framework for requesting 
resources from each other.  Supporting States provide requested resources/assets if 
available.  Resources include the supporting State’s NG assets provided ISO the 
supported State.  State NG assets remain under the control of the supporting State’s 
governor unless otherwise authorized. 
3.3.6.2.  DAF resources are provided pursuant to IRA or when civilian response resources 
have been or will be overwhelmed and tasked because of an approved Stafford Act or 
Economy Act RFA. 
3.3.6.3.  If mobilization of Reserve Component forces is required and authorized, follow 
guidance published in AFI 10-402, Mobilization Planning, AFI 10-403, Deployment 
Planning and Execution, and SPFI 10-401, Space Force Operations Planning and 
Execution. 
3.4.  DAF Reporting in DSCA Operations.  DAF installation commanders responding under 
IRA and DAF service components supporting DSCA operations will comply with reporting 
procedures in AFMAN 10-206, DAFI 36-3802, Force Support Readiness Programs, and DAFI 
36-3002, Casualty Services.  (T-2) 
3.5.  DAF Reimbursement in DSCA Operations. 
3.5.1.  Unless waived by SecDef or ASD(HD&HA) authority in Section 4 of DoDD 5111.13, 
reimbursement is required when equipment or services are provided to agencies outside DoD.   
All requirements for DAF resources, except IRA, are validated by the requesting LFA to be 
reimbursed for DSCA operations IAW the Stafford Act or the Economy Act.  Approved RFAs 
are coordinated with AF/A3, SAF/FM and with the appropriate DSCA GCC’s financial branch 
for the issuance of a project code or establishment of an ESP code for reimbursement.  The 
code should be identified in either an EXORD or FRAGORD.  Reimbursable support includes: 
3.5.1.1.  AF Flying Hour Costs.  DSCA operations flying hour costs include transporting 
personnel, supplies, and equipment to required areas via military airlift.  The flying hours 
used for these missions are centrally managed by AMC, the ANG, and AFRC.  For ANG 
and AFRC flying hours, individual units will provide their respective MAJCOMs the 
number of hours flown.  (T-2) 
3.5.1.2.  DAF Military Pay Costs.  MPA days fund ANG and AFRC personnel responding 
to DSCA operations.  ANG and AFRC units request MPA funding through the Total Force 
Integration Cell annotating the mission assignment number. 
 
 
DAFI10-801  26 FEBRUARY 2025 
31 
3.5.1.3.  DAF Other Costs.  Other costs incurred by units are reimbursed.  DAF units 
request reimbursement for other costs through the Defense Finance and Accounting 
Service. Laboratory support not within the parameters listed in DoDI 6200.03, Public 
Health Emergency Management (PHEM) within the Department of Defense, are conducted 
on a reimbursable basis IAW DoDD 3025.18. 
3.5.1.4.  WR missions conducted by the 53d WR Squadron are conducted on a non-
reimbursable basis when ISO the (1) National Hurricane Operations Plan, or (2) the 
National Winter Seasons Operations Plan. 
3.5.2.  DAF organizations seek reimbursement for DSCA operations provided under the 
Stafford Act or Economy Act.  DSCA operations, under immediate response authority, ISO 
federal agencies are reimbursed IAW the Economy Act and ISO non-federal agencies are 
reimbursed to the United States Treasury IAW Title 31 USC. § 9701. 
3.5.3.  DAF organizations document expenses IAW DAFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and 
Procedures and, IAW DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, and will submit requests for 
reimbursement within 30 calendar days after the month in which performance occurred or as 
directed by higher headquarters guidance.  (T-2)

FORCE PRESENTATION, COMMAND AND CONTROL, AND DUAL STATUS 
COMMANDER IN DSCA 
4.1.  Force Presentation. 
4.1.1.  Presentation of Expeditionary Units for a DSCA event is accomplished through DAF 
Service Components to CCDRs.  These units represent the mechanism for managing and 
scheduling forces for expeditionary use and is presented to the JFC.  Forces presented to the 
COMAFFOR for DSCA operations are provided through the DSCA EXORD or via the 
Request for Forces (RFF) process based on LFA RFA. 
4.1.2.  The USSF utilizes the SPAFORGEN as the force generation model designed for both 
employed-in-place and deployable forces. 
4.2.  Command and Control in DSCA Operations. 
4.2.1.  Joint Task Force (Federal).  Either the SecDef, USNORTHCOM commander, or 
USINDOPACOM commander, subordinate unified command commander, or a designated 
JTF commander is the JTF establishing authority in DSCA operations.  A JTF is established 
when the scope, complexity, or other factors of the contingency require capabilities of Services 
from at least two military departments operating under a single JFC.  The supported CCDR 
designates a JTF to establish the command and control over federal (Title 10, USC.) military 
activities ISO DSCA operations.  With this arrangement, the COMAFFOR exercises the 
appropriate command and control over those forces assigned/attached or ISO the JTF.  Within 
the joint force chain of command these C2 relationships are OPCON, TACON, or Support, 
when so designated by SecDef/CCDRs’ orders.  Within the Service chain of command, the 
commander has ADCON for assigned forces and typically exercises specified elements of 
ADCON over attached DAF Forces.  Specified ADCON is delineated in G-series orders (used 
to describe command relationships) or other Service orders IAW AFI 38-101, Manpower and 
Organization. See Figure 4.1.

(WFF) operations. 
4.2.2.1.  Figure 4.2  reflects the RFA process for obtaining DAF assets specifically utilized 
ISO NIFC WFF operations.  Once forces are approved based on the RFA, up to eight 
MAFFS equipped C-130 aircraft with associated aircrews and support personnel may be 
provided ISO of the NIFC.  See Figure 4.2.

4.2.2.2.  The mission is tasked to the CDRAFNORTH/ JFACC.  When employed in a 32 
USC. status, ANG assets remain under the control and authority of their respective 
governors.  Figure 4.3 illustrates employment of the ANG MAFFS reflecting 32 USC. 
status whereby a coordinating authority relationship is maintained between the ANG 
MAFFS, the deployed commander and CDRAFNORTH/JFACC.  AFRC MAFFS assets 
are under OPCON (via solid purple line) of the CDRAFNORTH/JFACC with delegation 
of TACON (via purple dotted line) to the Air Expeditionary Group Commander.  Figure 
4.4 represents the C2 relationship should ANG assets be placed in a 10 USC. status.

4.2.2.3.  Upon the WFF Incident Commander’s (IC) request for aerial tanker support 
through the firefighting district headquarters, the request is then submitted to the 
Geographical Area Coordination Center (GACC).  The GACC Aviation Branch reviews, 
validates, and sources tanker assets based on tanker resources available from established 
contractor assets.  Should GACC determine that tanker asset shortfalls exist, the GACC 
sends RFA to NIFC to request additional DoD tanker (MAFFS) support.  NIFC sends RFA 
through the DCO for validation who then forwards to USNORTHCOM for further 
validation.  USNORTHCOM forwards the RFA to JS/J3; if no DCO has been activated, 
the RFA goes from NIFC directly to the DoD ExecSec. The DoD ExecSec will provide the 
RFA to JS/J3 who validates after coordinating with the Services, United States 
Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) and its DAF service component (18 AF), 
NGB, and AF/A3O as appropriate. 
DAFI10-801  26 FEBRUARY 2025 
37 
4.2.2.4.  JS/J3 sources the requirement to the force providers (e.g., ANG or AFRC).  ACC 
establishes a standing expeditionary unit (AF group equivalent level), prior to the start of 
the WFF season.  The CJCS DSCA EXORD transfers OPCON/TACON from 
USTRANSCOM to USNORTHCOM who further delegates OPCON/ TACON of 10 USC. 
MAFFS to CDRAFNORTH/JFACC.  Coordinating authority is designated to 
CDRAFNORTH/JFACC and the expeditionary commander for those MAFFS assets in 32 
USC. status. 
4.2.2.5.  MAFFS assets (aircraft/crews/support forces) deploy to designated employment 
locations and are included in the GACC’s tanker resource pool for execution of WFF aerial 
fire suppression operations on a rotational basis as determined by their priority position 
IAW GACC tanker sourcing procedures. 
4.2.3.  Command and Control of Weather Reconnaissance assets in DSCA Operations. 
4.2.3.1.  Upon receipt of a RFA from the LFA, i.e., National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA)/National Hurricane Center (NHC), CARCAH works with the 
requesting LFA to develop the POD. The POD serves as the official RFA from 
NOAA/NHC. 
4.2.3.2.  ADCON elements will be specified in G-series orders when accomplished for WR 
supporting forces.  (T-2)  CDRUSNORTHCOM or CDRUSINDOPACOM, will assume 
OPCON or TACON of forces during DSCA mission execution as outlined in the CJCS 
DSCA EXORD.   (T-1) 
4.3.  State Civil Authority Roles - Governor, and Local Government. 
4.3.1.  Governor or Chief Executive.  A governor/Chief Executive of a State, territory, 
commonwealth, or tribal entity, etc., as chief executive, is responsible for the public safety and 
welfare of their respective residents.  The governor coordinates State resources and provides 
strategic guidance for response to all types of incidents.  This includes supporting local 
governments’ efforts before, during, and after incidents as needed with in-State resources first.  
If or when those resources may be exceeded, the governor may request/coordinate assistance 
with other States under established EMAC agreements.  If those resources are inadequate or 
unavailable, the governor initiates RFAs IAW the Stafford Act to obtain federal government 
agencies’ support.  For certain types of federal assistance, tribal governments work with the 
State, but as sovereign entities, they can elect to deal directly with the federal government for 
other types of assistance.  State officials have the authority to direct a State immediate 
response.  Use of State NG personnel under State C2 for a State response (including personnel 
in a 32 USC. status) are IAW State law under the activation and direction/concurrence of the 
governor. 
4.3.2.  State/Local Emergency Management Agency (EMA) Director and the EOC.  The 
state/local EMA Director has day-to-day responsibility and authority for overseeing state/local 
EM programs and activities.  The EMA Director establishes and directs functions of either the 
state or local EOC.  The EOC is the physical location where multi-agency coordination occurs 
and entails coordinating all aspects of a jurisdiction’s capabilities in preparedness, response, 
and recovery activities/operations.  The EMA Director staffs the EOC to support the incident  
 
 
38 
DAFI10-801  26 FEBRUARY 2025 
command, arranges needed resources, and assesses the availability and readiness of those local 
and State resources most likely required during an incident by identifying and correcting any 
shortfalls.  The chief elected or appointed official provides policy direction and supports the 
IC and emergency manager, as needed, to include unified objectives related to incident 
planning and incident management. 
4.3.3.  The Adjutant General (TAG) – State. TAG advises the governor on military affairs and 
commands the State’s NG forces within that State.  These organizations are likely the first 
military forces utilized in a State’s domestic emergency incident response.  Forces are 
deployed in either a SAD or a 32 USC status; both remain under the control of the governor 
through the State’s TAG.  Advantages associated with employing State guard assets in SAD 
or 32 USC status are, most notably, the ability to assist law enforcement as the Posse Comitatus 
Act does not apply to these forces.  DSCA military response is a coordinated effort between 
State guard forces and those federal (10 USC.) or United States Coast Guard (14 USC.) forces.  
TAGs have a JFHQ-State for pre-incident coordination and planning with federal JTFs or GCC 
staffs.  TAGs may establish a JTF-State to execute the State’s military forces incident 
management response efforts.  Depending on the state or territory the EMA Director or state’s 
homeland security advisor may be the same person as TAG of the State’s guard forces. 
4.3.4.  JTF-State. The Adjutant General (from the Army National Guard or ANG) advises state 
governors and commands the state’s NG forces within that state.  As NG forces are deployed 
in SAD or 32 USC. status, those forces remain under the control of the governor through the 
Adjutant General. Joint Force Headquarters-State provide pre-incident coordination and 
planning with federal JTFs.  Adjutant Generals establish JTF-State to execute command and 
control of State military forces during DSCA. 
4.4.  Dual Status Commander. 
4.4.1.  When federal and state military forces are employed simultaneously ISO civil 
authorities within each state, a Dual Status Commander (DSC) may be established by the 
President (or SecDef) and the state’s governor.  The enacting governor and President (or 
SecDef), with the advice of the supported CCDR, are required to mutually agree that 
establishment of a DSC is necessary and proper. Adjutant Generals, with the approval of their 
governors, submit DSC nominations to the CNGB.  Nominated DSC candidates complete 
required training for each respective theater in coordination with NGB required training 
requirements for certification. 
4.4.2.  A DSC is either an Army NG or ANG officer (federally recognized grade of O-6 or 
General Officer eligible for “authority to command”) who becomes federalized and retains his 
or her state status; or a Regular Army or Regular AF general officer who receives a State Guard 
commission while retaining his or her federal military status.  Deputy Commanders are 
established for each command chain (state/federal) and meet the same DSC training 
requirements.

training facility and principal supporting base for federal relief efforts. The USNORTHCOM or 
USINDOPACOM Commander designates the BSI after receiving concurrence of the owning 
Military Department Secretary.  Once the Service concurrence is provided, ACC notifies the 
affected MAJCOM and wing commander of the BSI approved requirement and enables the CCMD 
DAF component direct liaison authority (DIRLAUTH) with the supporting installation 
commander.  Additionally, once the requested installation is designated as the BSI or ISB, the

Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD)—Transportation-feasible database 
containing all the forces, materiel, and personnel required to execute and support the Commander 
in Chief’s (CINC) concept of operations. The TPFDD can be thought of as an expression of the 
CINC’s concept of operations through the scheduled deployment of the forces and sustainment 
required to execute it. Throughout the planning process, planners have access to several 
applications programs designed to initialize the TPFDD (create the database), add forces, schedule 
support, and enter transportation planning data. 
Weather Reconnaissance (WR)—WR involves collecting and analyzing meteorological data to 
support military operations and civil authorities, crucial in DSCA. It aids in disaster response by 
predicting and responding to natural disasters like hurricanes, winter storms, and floods, 
facilitating evacuation planning and resource allocation. In search and rescue operations, precise 
weather information ensures safety and effectiveness. It also guides the deployment of resources 
by forecasting conditions affecting transportation and operations. Collaboration with agencies like 
FEMA and NOAA ensures weather data is integrated into emergency response plans, enhancing 
efforts to protect lives and property.
