Attachment 
(Changed) 2.2. Concept of Operations. RED HORSE Squadrons are organized into “building 
block” Unit Type Codes to operate in a hub-and-spoke concept. The concept is to deploy the 
squadron(s), including augmentees, to a single area of responsibility. RED HORSE establishes a 
centrally located hub and forward deploys construction teams (spokes) from the hub. The hub 
manages and supports multiple spoke operations. The number of areas of responsibility 
supported, and hubs and spokes opened, are determined by COMAFFOR requirements. A RED 
HORSE capability is generally comprised of 11 personnel and 28 equipment Unit Type Codes. 
All RED HORSE personnel Unit Type Codes are listed in Table A2.1. All RED HORSE 
equipment Unit Type Codes are listed in Table A3.1. 
 
(Changed) 2.3. Response Times. Response times in the unit’s DOC statement are determined 
by the owning MAJCOM A3 but may be developed and maintained in collaboration with 
AFIMSC. Refer to AFI 10-402, Mobilization Planning, for mobilization and timing requirements 
for ANG and AFRC Unit Type Codes. 
 
(Changed) 2.4. Standard Deployment Augmentation. Standard RegAF RED HORSE 
Squadron augmentees are two contingency contracting officers (64PX or 6C071) with 
Acquisition Professional Development Program Level II certification in contracting. ARC units 
are augmented with two contingency contracting officers. MAJCOMs with assigned RED 
HORSE forces will identify sources for deployment augmentation. 
 
(Changed) 2.6. Mission Requirements. All personnel assigned to RED HORSE units, including 
augmentees, must be worldwide medically qualified in accordance with DAFMAN 48-123, 
Medical Examinations and Standards, and weapons qualified in accordance with AFI 31-117, 
Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. (T-1) 
 
(Changed) 2.7.4. Weapons and Ammunition. Weapons authorizations are in Allowance 
Standard 538, Part A. Each Unit Type Code deploys with the ammunition loads specified by the 
Ground Munitions Authorization Table. The dual arming weapons for all RED HORSE 
personnel are the M-4 and M-9 or M-18. All personnel will follow the arming and use of force 
guidance prescribed in AFI 31-117. (T-1) 
 
(Changed) 2.9.1. All deployed squadron commanders (or highest-ranking member if the 
commander is not deployed) must submit an After Action Report no later than 30 days after 
departure from the deployed location. (T-1) Commanders submit their After Action Reports 
through the Air Force-Joint Lessons Learned Information System web-based reporting tool using

HORSE personnel. RED HORSE training requirements are vetted and approved through the CE 
Governance Structure (see paragraph 1.3.2.1.). Qualification consists of initial and recurring 
training to maintain proficiency. Common RED HORSE training terms are train, certify, and 
license. “Train” is considered the act of teaching a member a particular skill or type of behavior 
through practice and instruction over a period.  “Certify” is considered as officially recognizing 
(someone or something) as possessing certain qualifications or meeting certain standards.  
“License” is being granted a license to (someone or something) to permit the use of something or 
to allow an activity to take place. 
 
(Changed) 3.3.1. High density capabilities are inherent to RED HORSE key tasks of heavy 
repair and construction. The minimum requirement is outlined in Table A6.1, but units are

(Changed) 5.4. Force Presentation. Presentation of RED HORSE forces for Combatant 
Commanders uses the Air Force Force Generation model and forces will deploy in a demand 
force team concept as depicted in Figure 5.1. The demand force team concept provides 
predictable combatant command vulnerability periods for RegAF RED HORSE Squadrons at a 
1:3 Deploy to dwell (D2D) tempo and vulnerability periods for AFR and ANG RED HORSE 
Squadrons are on a 1:5 Mobilization to Dwell (M2D). The concept is also designed to outline 
habitual relationships between the RegAF, AFR and ANG squadrons in their vulnerability 
periods through Total Force Integration. These relationships across RED HORSE squadrons may 
provide an opportunity for these units to establish working relationships with specific combatant 
commands when supporting non-request-for-forces requirements.

Note 1:  Training frequency is: 
        RegAF = 24 months (unless otherwise defined by equipment specific requirements). 
        ARC = 48 months (unless otherwise defined by equipment specific requirements). 
Note 2:  Members must receive the initial pilot training and successfully complete a well drilling 
Troop Training Project to meet initial training requirements. Upon completion of the pilot 
training and Troop Training Project completion members may requalify via Troop Training 
Project completion or pilot unit course after completing initial requirements. 
        RegAF = 24 months 
Note 3:  Demolition training is required monthly. An active demolition program conducts live 
explosive proficiency training monthly. Any squadron that cannot satisfy this requirement is 
required to have an inactive demolition program. Inactive teams conduct monthly classroom 
instruction using inert explosives and participate in an annual live explosive training session 
supervised by an active RED HORSE demolition team supervisor. Inactive teams will be 
deemed active when the inactive team is on a joint contingency deployment with an active 
demolition team and receives live explosive training or receives live explosive training in the 
Area of Responsibility from an active team and conducts demolition responsibilities throughout 
the deployment. The 40-hour refresher training course must be conducted by a lead training unit 
instructor between 24-36 months but not to exceed 36 months to provide procedural or 
educational updates. Annual explosives safety must be accomplished by individual squadron 
demolition teams every 12-15 months but not to exceed 15 months with two versions of the 
AFGM2024-01 19 December 2024 
Attachment 
documented explosives safety test. DESR6055.09_AFMAN91-201, Explosive Safety Standards 
directs the RED HORSE Demolition team to work with the installation safety office of the 
respective squadron demolition team approval of the lesson plan. 
Note 4:  Members must complete the pilot course either prior to assignment to a RED HORSE 
unit or within the first 12 months for RegAF or within 24 months of technical school completion 
for ARC units.  Members must exercise material testing during the respective dwell cycle. The 
pilot course is a one-time training requirement; unit commanders should consider sending 
members back to the pilot course if increased proficiency is required. 
Note 5:  A Contingency Airfield Pavement Evaluation (CAPE) certification is valid for 36 
months for both RegAF and ARC personnel upon completion of the CAPE course. AFCEC may 
extend the certification for an additional 36 months if the member routinely conducts 
evaluations during the initial certification period in accordance with Engineer Technical Letter 
02-19. If a certification has expired, the member must re-accomplish the CAPE course to be 
recertified.

Standards, and the AFCEC Mobile Wheel Mounted Hydraulic Crane Certification Package to determine operator 
qualification requirements. 
 
In accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Standards - 29 CRF 1926.1427, 3E2X1 
personnel required to operate mobile hydraulic cranes in the performance of their duties must be both certified and 
qualified through an approved AFCEC sponsored training course. The AFCEC Mobile Crane Certification Course 
will cover all cranes from 0-75 ton capacity. For cranes that fall outside of the 0-75 ton range, contact the 3E2X1 
Force Development Manager (FDM) for additional certification and qualification procedures. 
 
Certification: Certification will be obtained by successfully completing the 80-hour AFCEC Mobile Crane 
Certification course. Those that attend an approved civilian certification venue will also need to attend the 40-hour 
AFCEC Crane Qualification Course to be fully certified. Certification will be valid for a period of 60-months from 
the date of issue at which time the member must re-accomplish the 80-hour AFCEC Crane Certification Course for 
re-certification. 
 
Qualification: Qualification ensures that operators are and remain familiar with the Air Force crane specific 
requirements and operations. Qualification is obtained by successfully completing the 40-hour AFCEC Crane 
Qualification Course. All qualifications are valid for a period of 30-months from the date of issue. By successfully 
completing an approved certification course this will also fulfill the qualification requirement. Once 30-months 
have lapsed from date of issue of certification, members will be required to attend the 40-hour AFCEC Crane 
Qualification Course, which will extend qualification currency until an individual's certification is expired.

Chapter 2 
RED HORSE PROGRAM 
2.1.  RED HORSE Capability.  To support combat air power worldwide, RED HORSE provides 
the Commander of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) a dedicated, flexible, airfield and base heavy 
construction and repair capability. RED HORSE also provides many special capabilities that allow 
the COMAFFOR to move and support missions as the air order of battle dictates. The standard 
RED HORSE capability consists of 404 personnel (engineers and support personnel) with 
approximately 1,000 short-tons of vehicles, heavy construction and support equipment. This 
organic support allows the unit to operate independently for extended periods of time until normal 
supply channels are established. In addition to the standard capability, the RED HORSE special 
capabilities consist of approximately 2,200 short-tons, which can be tailored to meet specific 
construction and repair requirements. When operating in a higher threat, non-permissive 
environment outside a forward operating base or collocated operating base, the RED HORSE 
commander, in coordination with the area commander (i.e. combat arms land force commander), 
determines additional security requirements based on operational risk. Reference JP 3-10, Joint 
Security Operations in Theater, for additional information. 
2.2.  Concept of Operations.  RED HORSE Squadrons are organized into “building block” Unit 
Type Codes to operate in a hub-and-spoke concept. The concept is to deploy the squadron(s), 
including augmentees, to a single area of responsibility. RED HORSE establishes a centrally 
located hub and forward deploys construction teams (spokes) from the hub. The hub manages and 
supports multiple spoke operations. The number of areas of responsibility supported, and hubs and 
spokes opened, are determined by COMAFFOR requirements. A RED HORSE capability is 
generally comprised of 20 personnel and 24 equipment Unit Type Codes. All RED HORSE 
personnel Unit Type Codes are listed in Table A2.1. All RED HORSE equipment Unit Type Codes 
are listed in Table A3.1 
2.2.1.  Deployment Sequencing. RED HORSE Squadrons generally deploy personnel in three 
echelons (Advanced Echelon, Hub, and Construction as depicted in Table A2.1). The three 
echelons ideally deploy in the following sequence: Advanced Echelon teams consisting of Air 
Insert Engineer Repair Team and Site Assessment Teams, followed by the Hub Teams. Finally, 
Construction Teams deploy individually or in any combination of the Horizontal Construction 
Teams or Vertical Construction Teams. Individual RED HORSE Unit Type Codes may be 
tasked to support any contingency in accordance with the War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 
1, CE Supplement. 
2.2.2.  Hub and Spoke Operations. Hub operations are self-sufficient with re-supply of 
consumable items (water, fuel, food rations, construction materials, etc.) but may require 
assistance from local wings to receive/send equipment and supplies. If hub and spoke 
operations are collocated, they are self-sufficient. Spoke operations are not self-sufficient 
unless collocated with a base operating support provider. 
2.2.3.  Unit Type Code Mission Capability. The size and complexity of construction projects 
drive the number and type of equipment Unit Type Codes deployed. Table A3.1 lists 
equipment Unit Type Codes and typical employment capabilities. Personnel and equipment 
Unit Type Code Mission Capability statements have detailed information on their capabilities 
and configuration. 
10 
AFI10-209  11 JUNE 2019 
2.3.  Response Times.  Response times in the unit’s Designed Operational Capability statement 
are determined by the owning MAJCOM A3 but may be developed and maintained in 
collaboration with AFIMSC. Refer to AFI 10-402, Mobilization Planning, for mobilization and 
timing requirements for ANG and AFRC Unit Type Codes. 
2.4.  Standard Deployment Augmentation.  Standard RegAF RED HORSE Squadron 
augmentees are one financial management technician (6F051), one Independent Duty Medical 
Technician (4N0X1C or 42G3), and two contingency contracting officers (64PX or 6C071) with 
Acquisition Professional Development Program Level II certification in contracting. ARC units 
are augmented with two contingency contracting officers. MAJCOMs with assigned RED HORSE 
forces will identify sources for deployment augmentation. 
2.5.  Additional Augmentation.  Upon receiving the warning order, a tasked unit’s subject matter 
expert (SME) determine if additional augmentation is required for mission success, sustainment, 
and/or risk mitigation. SMEs may consider mission, environmental conditions, and threat. Upon 
deployment tasking, the tasked unit coordinates with the force provider to request additional forces 
if required. Possible augmentation includes but is not limited to: Bioenvironmental Engineering, 
additional physicians, Independent Duty Medical Technicians, logistics support, security forces, 
and/or Emergency Management specialists. 
2.6.  Mission Requirements.  All personnel assigned to RED HORSE units, including 
augmentees, must be worldwide medically qualified in accordance with AFI 48-123, Medical 
Examinations and Standards, and weapons qualified in accordance with AFI 31-117, Arming and 
Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. (T-1). 
2.7.  Deployment Requirements.  RED HORSE deploys with personnel, supplies, vehicles, 
construction equipment tools, limited rations, generators, water purification units, weapons, 
communications, and personnel equipment to support weapon system beddown, expedient 
construction, and heavy repair. Units review reporting instructions to identify additional 
deployment requirements. Prior to sending a team on a deployment, a determination is made if 
pre-positioned and/or leased vehicles and equipment are required. 
2.7.1.  Airlift. US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) authorizes airlift, in 
accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation 4500.9-R-Part III, Mobility, for mobility 
aircraft to transport RED HORSE cargo when applicable all the following conditions are met: 
2.7.1.1.  The contingency requires immediate rapid response from RED HORSE within 
Defense Operational Capability statement response time(s) and when the unit’s capabilities 
are being transported via airlift. 
2.7.1.2.  Pre-positioned fuel, water, ammunition, and other consumables are not readily 
available at a deployment destination or contingency area in enough quantity to allow the 
unit to operate independently for extended periods of time until normal supply channels 
are established. 
2.7.1.3.  The given mission requires an increased state of readiness to use ammunition, 
explosives, and other hazardous materials (HAZMAT) such as fuel, immediately after 
being transported to, within, or from objective areas.

Chapter 3 
TRAINING 
3.1.  Purpose.  This chapter outlines the minimum training requirements for RED HORSE 
personnel. RED HORSE training requirements are vetted and approved through the CE 
Governance Structure (see paragraph 1.3.2.1). Qualification consists of initial and recurring 
training to maintain proficiency. 
3.2.  RED HORSE Special Capability and Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) Specific 
Training.  RED HORSE members will receive mandatory training in accordance with 
requirements listed in Attachments 4 through 9. (T-1). The training requirements listed contain 
specific AFSC training and minimum frequency required for mission capability in each Unit Type 
Code. For example, pavements milling requires four trained AFSC 3E2X1 per large horizontal 
team, and for squadrons that posture the three large horizontal team Unit Type Codes, at least 12 
3E2X1s need to be trained. At a minimum, training will be conducted as often as required by this 
instruction. (T-1). Squadrons are highly encouraged to train more often at their discretion to 
maintain required readiness levels. 
3.3.  RED HORSE Special Capability.   RED HORSE units offer unique competencies in heavy 
repair, horizontal, vertical, and support construction. RED HORSE provides these competencies 
through their special capabilities training program. Special capability training is divided into high 
and low density categories. 
3.3.1.  High density capabilities are inherent to RED HORSE key tasks of heavy repair and 
construction. The minimum requirement is outlined in Table A6.1, but units are encouraged 
to exceed the minimum required since these inherent capabilities enable RED HORSE key 
tasks. Training table identifies the required Unit Type Codes and AFSCs that must accomplish 
the training as well as the frequency requirements and sources for training material. Units will 
ensure the required personnel meet the requirements in Table A6.1. (T-1). Training is normally 
accomplished through the unit’s Troop Training Project program. Alternately, it can be 
accomplished by attending courses held at a RED HORSE lead training unit as stated in 
paragraph 3.4. 
3.3.2.  Low density capabilities require specialized training. A limited number of personnel are 
trained in these capabilities. Table A6.1 identifies the required Unit Type Codes and AFSCs 
that must be trained in these capabilities, as well as the frequency requirements and sources for 
training material. This training will be accomplished through lead training units unless 
otherwise noted. (T-1). 
3.3.3.  When RED HORSE personnel perform a high density special capability without 
attending a lead training unit course and still meet the criteria defined in Table A6.1, the unit 
commander may certify those personnel as current. To qualify, the validation resource 
readiness reporting standard must be performed under the full-time supervision and instruction 
of at least one member currently qualified from the lead training unit course. (T-1). The 
currency date for the validation resource readiness reporting standard is the day all required 
tasks have been completed.

AFI10-209  11 JUNE 2019 
 
3.4.  RED HORSE Lead Training Units.   RED HORSE lead training units, depicted in Table 
3.1, will develop training programs, lesson plans, and schedules in conjunction with AFCEC/CXX 
to support all RED HORSE units. (T-1). The lead training unit shall provide a schedule of classes 
to AFCEC/CXX no later than 1 April each year. (T-1). The schedule will be approved by 
AFCEC/CXX and posted on the AFCEC Expeditionary Engineering SharePoint site at 
https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/13072/default.aspx. (T-1). An annual review of all lesson plans will 
be conducted by the lead training unit in conjunction with AFCEC (refer to paragraph 1.3.4.3). 
(T-1). Lesson plans can be found on the Expeditionary Engineering SharePoint site (see link 
above). Lead training units should research and develop new and or improved training standards 
and techniques and present them to AFCEC/CXX for review as necessary.

AFI10-209  11 JUNE 2019 
15 
3.7.  Supplemental and Enhancement Training.  Supplementary AFSC specific training not 
identified in Attachments 4 through 7 should be coordinated and scheduled with the host base to 
ensure all AFSCs (in particular non-CE AFSCs) receive adequate career progression in accordance 
with their respective Career Field Education and Training Plan and remain familiar with their 
primary AFSC skills. Local Memorandums of Agreement or Memorandums of Understanding 
may need to be established to assist in facilitating supplemental AFSC training at the discretion of 
the commander. 
3.8.  Formal Documentation.  RED HORSE Squadrons will document contingency and special 
capabilities training using the Automated Readiness Information System in accordance with AFI 
36-2651, Air Force Training Program. Personnel deploying over 30 days will either hand carry 
AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, or have access to automated training records. 
(T-1). Upon separation or reassignment, the Unit Training Manager must provide a copy of the 
automated training record for the member and archive the record or transfer the record to the 
gaining unit via the Automated Readiness Information System. (T-1). Sign-in rosters used to 
document training must be kept on file in accordance with guidelines established in the records 
disposition schedule. (T-1). Data will be used to periodically verify the currency of information in 
the Automated Readiness Information System. (T-1). 
3.9.  Troop Training Project Program.  Troop Training Projects provide RED HORSE 
Squadrons the primary means for wartime heavy construction and AFSC specific training through 
the execution of real-world construction projects. Troop Training Projects ensure exercise of RED 
HORSE heavy construction and repair capability. Emergency and contingency-type projects 
related to tactical deployments or natural disasters are not included under the terms of this chapter 
as the scope and criteria is determined at the time of emergency or contingency employment. 
3.9.1.  Security cooperation projects also fall under the RED HORSE Troop Training Project 
program, and they include all training construction or repair projects. Additionally, RED 
HORSE troop labor should be used to support Joint Chief of Staff sponsored exercise related 
construction, innovative readiness training, humanitarian civic assistance, state partnership 
program, and MAJCOM or Combatant Commander specific building partnership capacity and 
engagement programs (e.g. engineering civic action engagement programs, deployment for 
training, etc.). RED HORSE units will provide quarterly updates to AFCEC/CXX on Troop 
Training Projects on behalf of their units which directly support Combatant Commands 
specific security cooperation lines of effort such as, but not limited to, building partnership 
capacity, Deployment for Training, and Engineering Civic Action Engagement Programs. (T-
2). All security cooperation engagements shall be coordinated with the respective Combatant 
Commands and MAJCOMs prior to execution in accordance with AFPD 16-1, Security 
Cooperation. (T-1). 
3.9.2.  RegAF RED HORSE units will afford opportunity to enhance AFSC skills of ARC 
personnel through Troop Training Project accomplishment in accordance with the Deployment 
for Training construct presented in Figure 5.1. (T-1). In addition, RegAF RED HORSE units 
will identify requirements for the necessary military personnel appropriation days from their 
respective HQ AFIMSC Detachment Military Personnel Appropriation Day Manager to 
support ARC involvement in Troop Training Project execution. (T-1). Conversely, the ARC  
 
 
16 
AFI10-209  11 JUNE 2019 
units will afford opportunity to RegAF RED HORSE units to participate in Deployment for 
Training program. (T-1). The RED HORSE Troop Training Project program enhances the 
overall management, technical and command skills as well as develop habitual relationships 
for the RED HORSE enterprise in accordance with AFI 90-1001, Planning Total Force 
Associations (TFAs). 
3.9.3.  Troop Training Project Compliance. All RED HORSE Troop Training Projects must be 
performed under the guidance of this instruction and must comply with the limits, terms, and 
authorities set forth in AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming Appropriated Fund 
Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects, or other applicable component programming 
rules. (T-1). 
3.9.4.  Troop Training Project Baseline. The Troop Training Project baseline represents the 
core capabilities to provide the minimum RED HORSE competencies. This baseline can be 
met by projects sourced through the AFCAMP, coordinated with and funded by non-AF 
customers, or completed during training exercises and security cooperation activities. Each 
RED HORSE Squadron Commander must ensure the baseline requirements are exercised 
during a unit’s dwell. (T-1). As depicted in Table 3.2, during a standard dwell cycle, total force 
units paired together with associations will exercise construction capabilities in the following

TOTAL FORCE 
5.1.  Overview.  The AF utilizes its active and reserve components to generate forces and combat 
power for the nation and its joint warfighters. The Total Force consists of the RegAF, ARC, which 
is comprised of the ANG and the AFR. The ARC, consisting of the AFR and ANG, are integrated 
across the spectrum of mission areas, train to the same standards as the RegAF, and are essential 
in planning for and meeting Total Force commitments in Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and 
Global Power. In order to provide efficient and effective combat capability with the resources 
assigned to the Total Force, the components and MAJCOMs rely on demand force teams. Demand 
force teams provide surge and rotational capacity of combat power, enhanced training, and more 
efficient operations. Through the sponsor MAJCOM, RED HORSE units may establish Total 
Force Associations in accordance with Figure 5.1, to improve productivity, retain mission 
capabilities, and achieve synergy in the use of Total Force equipment, manpower and infrastructure 
both in dwell and during contingency operations. The capacity line represents the total number of 
Airmen available in each of the three demand force teams. 
5.2.  Total Force Success.  Successfully managing the Total Force requires effective leadership 
and collaboration from all Airmen. Specifically, RED HORSE commanders are responsible for 
attaining and maintaining mission readiness to ensure the Total Force is best capable of leveraging 
their maximum collaborative effects as they operate together. Total Force Associations are an 
essential element within RED HORSE planning and programming functions and for developing, 
evaluating, resourcing, executing, and managing Total Force Associations in accordance with AFI 
90-1001. 
5.3.  Total Force Integration Management.  Total Force Integration Management is the 
collaborative command-level process of planning, organizing and aligning associated squadrons 
to ensure readiness while respecting force management statutes, policies, guidance, culture and 
expectations, and then meet mission requirements. MAJCOM management of associated 
squadrons includes planning, resourcing, and managing issues related to interoperability, training, 
communication, installation support, personnel support, and professional development. RED 
HORSE commanders will establish working relations within the three Demand Force Teams to 
present a competent capable RED HORSE capability to support each deployment period. (T-2). 
For more specific details on the Total Force governance structure, force mix analyses and 
guidance, and developing Total Force Associations, refer to AFI 90-1001. 
5.4.  Force Presentation.  Presentation of RED HORSE forces for Combatant Commanders uses 
the demand force team concept, as depicted in Figure 5.1. The demand force team concept 
provides predictable combatant command vulnerability periods for RegAF RED HORSE 
Squadrons at a 1:2 Deploy to dwell tempo and vulnerability periods for AFR and ANG RED 
HORSE Squadrons are on a 1:5 Mobilization to Dwell. The concept is also designed to outline 
habitual relationships between the RegAF, AFR and ANG squadrons in their vulnerability periods 
through Total Force Integration. These relationships across RED HORSE squadrons may provide 
an opportunity for these units to establish working relationships with specific combatant 
commands when supporting non-request-for-forces requirements.

Terms 
Bare Base—Provides vital equipment and supplies necessary to beddown and support combat 
forces at bases with limited or no facilities. At a minimum, such a base has a runway and parking 
ramp suitable for aircraft operations, and a source of water, that can be made potable. 
Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists, 
subversives, or military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, contingencies require 
plans, rapid response, and special procedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel, 
installations, and equipment. 
32 
AFI10-209  11 JUNE 2019 
High Density Capabilities—This term is used for Special Capabilities within RH to identify 
construction requirements that are in high demand and require more Airmen to support required 
tasks. 
In-Garrison—This term is used when referring to RED HORSE and bare base equipment while 
in storage (assets are located within the home station compound). 
Logistics Force Packaging System—Logistics Force is a subsystem of the Manpower and 
Equipment Force Packaging system. It provides a detailed listing of equipment and material 
requirements and summarized transportation characteristics for each Unit Type Code. 
Low Density Capabilities—This term is for Special Capabilities within RED HORSE to identify 
construction requirements that are in low demand and require more technical training, but require 
less Airmen to perform required tasks. 
Main Operating Base—A base on which all essential buildings and facilities are erected. Total 
organizational and intermediate maintenance capability exists for assigned weapon systems. The 
intermediate maintenance capability may be expanded to support a specific weapon system 
deployed to the Main Operating Base. 
Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System—A data system designed to support 
contingency and general war planning with predefined and standardized manpower and equipment 
force packages. Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging, which operates in the command and 
control environment, is composed of two subsystems: the MANFOR and the LOGFOR. 
Manpower Force Packaging System—A subsystem of the Manpower and Equipment Forcing 
Packaging system. This system provides the following for each Unit Type Code: (1) Title of the 
unit or force element and its unique JCS Unit Type Code (2) The capability statement that contains 
the definition of unit capability (3) The manpower detail by function, grade (officers only), and 
AFSC required to meet the defined capability. 
Mobilization—The act of assembling and organizing national resources to support national 
objectives in time of war or other emergencies; the process by which the Armed Forces, or part of 
them, is brought to a state of readiness for war or other national emergency. This includes 
activating all or part of the Reserve components, as well as assembling and organizing personnel, 
supplies, and material. 
Operating (Using) Command—The command primarily operating/using a system or item of 
equipment; generally applies to those operational commands or organizations designated by the 
AF to conduct or participate in operations or operational testing. It is interchangeable with the term 
“Using Command" (commands who receive RED HORSE units to execute missions; e.g., US 
Central Command, PACAF, and US Southern Command). 
Parent MAJCOM—A MAJCOM to which a particular unit is assigned in peacetime. 
Program Objective Memorandum—A biannual memorandum submitted to the Secretary of 
Defense (SECDEF) from each military department and defense agency. It proposes total program 
requirements for the next six years. It includes rationale for planned changes from the approved 
future years’ defense program baseline within the fiscal guidance issued by the SECDEF. 
Reconstitution—The actions taken on a bare base package or other assets after return from a 
deployment to return them to their original condition. 
AFI10-209  11 JUNE 2019 
33 
Sustainment—The provision of logistics and personnel services required to maintain and prolong 
operations until successful mission accomplishment. 
Unit Type Code—A five-character, alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each unit type in 
US Armed Forces. 
War and Mobilization Plan—The Air Force supporting plan to the Joint Strategic Capabilities 
Plan. The five volumes of the War and Mobilization Plan extend through the Future Years Defense 
Plan to provide continuity in short- and mid-range war and mobilization planning. It provides 
current planning cycle policies and planning factors for the conduct and support of wartime 
operations. It establishes requirements for development of mobilization and production-planning 
programs to support sustained contingency operations of the programmed forces. The War and 
Mobilization Plan encompasses all functions necessary to match facilities, manpower, and materiel 
with planned wartime activity.

Note 1: Training frequency is: 
        RegAF = 18 months (unless otherwise defined by equipment specific requirements). 
        ARC = 48 months (unless otherwise defined by equipment specific requirements). 
Note 2: Members must receive the initial pilot training and successfully complete a well drilling Troop Training 
Project to meet initial training requirements. Upon completion of the pilot training and Troop Training Project 
completion members may requalify via Troop Training Project completion or pilot unit course after completing 
initial requirements. 
        RegAF = 18 months 
        ARC = 36 months 
Note 3: Demolition training is required monthly. An active demolition program conducts live explosive 
proficiency training monthly. Any squadron that cannot satisfy this requirement is required to have an inactive 
demolition program. Inactive teams conduct monthly classroom instruction using inert explosives and participate 
in an annual live explosive training session supervised by an active RED HORSE demolition team supervisor. 
Inactive teams will be deemed active when the inactive team is on a joint contingency deployment with an active 
demolition team and receives live explosive training, or receives live explosive training in the Area of 
Responsibility from an active team and conducts demolition responsibilities throughout the deployment. The 40-
hour refresher training course must be conducted by a lead training unit instructor between 24-36 months but not to 
40 
AFI10-209  11 JUNE 2019 
exceed 36 months to provide procedural or educational updates. Annual explosives safety must be accomplished 
by individual squadron demolition teams every 12-15 months but not to exceed 15 months with two versions of the 
documented explosives safety test. AFI 91-201 directs the RED HORSE Demolition team to work with the 
installation safety office of the respective squadron demolition team approval of the lesson plan. 
Note 4: Members must complete the pilot course either prior to assignment to a RED HORSE unit or within the 
first 12 months for RegAF or 24 months for ARC units and must exercise material testing during the respective 
dwell cycle. The pilot course is a one-time training requirement; unit commanders should consider sending 
members back to the pilot course if increased proficiency is required. 
Note 5: A Contingency Airfield Pavement Evaluation CAPE) certification is valid for 36 months for both RegAF 
and ARC personnel upon completion of the CAPE course. AFCEC may extend the certification for an additional 
36 months if the member routinely conducts evaluations during the initial certification period in accordance with 
Engineer Technical Letter 02-19. If a certification has expired, the member must re-accomplish the CAPE course 
to be recertified. 
Note 6: Upon completion of the Air Assault course members must participate in an Air Insert exercise (AD 1:18 
months or ARC 1:24 months). Exercise must include the insertion of equipment via air. 
Note 7: Army Sling Load Certification Course Training may count for 2 of the 4 required members may attend the 
Army Sling Load Certification Training Course instead of the Air Assault course in order to satisfy this 
requirement.
