SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This publication has been completely revised and rewritten to reflect the ground command and 
control systems standardization and evaluation (Stan/Eval) program--battle control center 
evaluation criteria of the air defense units.  This publication does not imply any manpower 
growth, and it must be completely reviewed due to numerous operational changes.  Changes 
include the update of each duty position criteria evaluation area, removal of some technician 
duty positions and associated criteria, addition of instructor evaluation criteria, format of the duty 
position areas and administrative changes as necessary.  Waiver authorities have been changed to 
reflect guidance in DAFI 33-360.

knowledge and proficiency are academic testing and observation of job performance.  The 
questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation should be limited to 
items not determined by observation, but related to the scenarios being employed for evaluation. 
1.6.  Evaluation Procedures. 
1.6.1.  Examiners conduct evaluations in accordance with this publication.  Examiners will 
administer positional evaluations only within their weapon system and crew specialty and 
only evaluate those missions and skill sets in which they maintain qualification. (T-2) 
1.6.2.  Examiners may conduct any portion of a mission crew positional evaluation that is 
associated with the position(s) for which they hold qualification (i.e., Air Weapons Officer 
(AWO)/WD, AST/ST, Interface Control Officer (ICO)/Interface Control Technician (ICT)).  
Examiners who hold supervisory mission crew position qualifications (e.g., Senior Director 
(SD), Air Surveillance Officer (ASO), ICO) may evaluate the associated duty positions (i.e., 
SD: AWO/WD, ASO: AST, ICO: ICT). 
1.6.3.  Prior to Evaluation.  The SEE explains the purpose of the evaluation and how it will 
be conducted.  The examinee accomplishes all mission planning appropriate for the type of 
evaluation. 
1.6.4.  During Evaluation.  The SEE evaluate the examinee's performance for each graded 
area and note discrepancies when deviations from prescribed performance criteria occur 
during the evaluation. 
1.6.5.  Post Evaluation.  The SEE compares the examinee's performance with the grading 
criteria and assigns an appropriate grade for each area.  The SEE considers cumulative 
momentary deviations.  The judgment of the SEE is the determining factor in assigning an 
overall grade for the examinee's performance.  The SEE thoroughly critiques all aspects of 
the evaluation.  During this critique, the SEE reviews the examinee's overall rating, specific 
deviations, area grades assigned, and any additional training which the examinee is required 
to complete.  SEE will debrief all initial qualification or initial instructor evaluations 
resulting in Exceptionally Qualified (EQ), Qualified 2 (Q2), or Qualified 3 (Q3) with the 
examinee's squadron CC or operations officer (or designated representative), and flight CC 
(or designated representative). (T-3) 
1.6.6.  Academic Examination.  The academic examination is the master question file (MQF) 
written examination.  The SEE will administer the academic examination in accordance with 
AFI 13-1, Ground Command and Control Systems Standardization/Evaluation Program—
Organization and Administration, Volume 2. (T-3) For initial evaluations, academic 
examinations are completed prior to any positional portions of the evaluation unless waived 
AFMAN13-1 BCCV2  22 OCTOBER 2020 
23 
 
by the unit CC on a case-by-case basis.  For requalification evaluations (RQE) and periodic 
evaluations the written examination is completed at the discretion of the Chief, Stan/Eval. 
1.6.6.1.  The written examination for a QUAL/MSN evaluation will consist of 70 
questions from the MAJCOM MQF, 15 questions from the unit MSN MQF, and 15 
questions from the local procedures master question file (LPMQF). (T-3) 
1.6.6.2.  INIT MSN examinations may be waived by the unit CC if the evaluation was 
combined with the INIT QUAL evaluation. 
1.7.  SEE Objectivity Evaluations.  Guidance on SEE Objectivity Evaluations is provided in 
AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol 2, paragraph 5.2.5.2 after initial selection as a SEE and at the 
discretion and direction of the unit CC thereafter. 
1.8.  Grading Guidance.  Rating guidance for examiners, contained in AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL 
Vol 2, paragraph 5.3., and the evaluation criteria in this publication are for conducting all 
positional evaluations.  Use of these criteria ensures standard and objective evaluations are 
administered to crewmembers.  SEEs and crewmembers will be thoroughly familiar with the 
prescribed grading criteria in this publication. (T-3)  
1.8.1.  A three-level grading system (i.e., Q, Q-, or U) will be used for all areas except those 
designated as CRITICAL, in which case a two-level system (i.e., Q or U) will be used (T-2). 
1.8.2.  An overall rating of “Unqualified” could result from an unqualified rating of a single 
critical or multiple noncritical areas. 
1.8.3.  All area ratings are based on the three-level rating system (i.e., Q, Q-, or U) described 
in paragraph 1.8.1  and the criteria listed in the individual chapters or areas. (T-2) 
1.9.  Required Evaluation Areas.  Required evaluation areas are defined as all areas (and 
associated sub-areas) identified in this document.  The examiner evaluates the examinee's 
performance in all required areas.  When a required area cannot be evaluated during live fly 
operations because of equipment malfunctions, weather conditions, operational requirements, or 
lack of adequate operating airspace, the area may be graded using simulation or a verbal 
evaluation. 
1.9.1.  Examiners make every effort to evaluate all required areas during the live fly portion 
before resorting to this alternative.  If an alternate evaluation method is used, the examiner 
will document the method under the mission description paragraph in the remarks section of 
the AF Form 8, Certification of Aircrew Qualification, in accordance with AFI 13-1 
STAN/EVAL Vol 2 (T-2) 
1.9.2.  Evaluation tasks are shown in the appropriate evaluation area, along with the rating 
scale for each task.  Each area has a three-level (i.e., Q, Q-, or U) grading system with the 
exception of “CRITICAL” areas.  The overall area grade will reflect the majority of the 
ratings assessed for the examinee’s achievement of tasked sub-areas. (T-3) 
1.9.2.1.  Q.  A “Q” is the desired level of performance.  This grade indicates the 
examinee demonstrates a satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performs 
mission duties within the prescribed tolerances, and accomplishes the assigned mission. 
1.9.2.2.  Q-.  A “Q-” indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area 
tasks without supervision, but requires a written debriefed comment or additional training 
24 
AFMAN13-1 BCCV2  22 OCTOBER 2020 
 
unless, in the judgment of the examiner, it would not constructively improve the 
examinee’s performance.  Deviations from established standards must not exceed the 
prescribed “Q-” tolerances or jeopardize flight safety. (T-2) 
1.9.2.3.  U.  Assign a “U” area grade for any performance outside allowable parameters 
and for deviations from prescribed procedures or tolerances that adversely affect mission 
accomplishment or compromise flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area grade of 
“U” requires additional training. 
1.9.2.4.  Critical Areas.  Critical grading areas have been established for evaluations.  
Critical areas are defined as events that require adequate accomplishment by the 
examinee in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives and complete the 
evaluation.  If an examinee receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for 
the evaluation will also be unqualified. (T-3)  Critical areas are identified by 
"(CRITICAL)" following the applicable area title. 
1.10.  Simulation Evaluations.  Simulation may be used to administer any portion of a 
positional evaluation not requiring a specific live scenario.  Unit SEEs will identify existing 
simulation scenarios that include adequate activity to meet the evaluation requirements for the 
required events. (T-3)  If adequate scenarios do not exist, unit Stan/Eval personnel will develop 
scenario outlines for the simulation activity to be conducted to ensure standardization of both the 
level of activity and the difficulty of simulation evaluations. (T-3)  The SEE’s judgment will be 
the determining factor in the effective use of simulation. (T-3)

Chapter 14 
KOREAN THEATER AIR CONTROL SYSTEM MISSION CREW 
COMMANDER/MCC TECHNICIAN QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS 
14.1.  Purpose.  This chapter, in conjunction with AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol 2, gives 621 ACS 
assigned SEE procedures and criteria to use during Korean Theater Air Control System 
MCC/MCCT evaluations.  Adherence to these procedures and criteria ensures an accurate 
assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of crewmembers. 
14.2.  Rating Guidance.  Rating guidance for SEEs is provided in AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol 
2, and in this chapter for conducting all evaluations.  All area ratings are based on a three-level 
rating system (i.e., Q, Q-, or U) described below.  Critical grading area ratings are based on a 
two-level rating system (i.e., Q or U) described below. 
14.2.1.  A Qualified area grade (Q) is the desired level of performance.  The examinee 
demonstrates a satisfactory level of knowledge of all required information, performed duties 
within the prescribed tolerances and accomplishes the assigned mission with no 
discrepancies. 
14.2.2.  A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the 
assigned area tasks, but requires a written debriefed comment or additional training as 
determined by the SEE.  Deviations from established standards must not exceed the 
prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety. (T-3) 
14.2.3.  An Unqualified area grade (U) is given for performance outside allowable 
parameters or deviations 
from 
prescribed procedures 
that jeopardized mission 
accomplishment or compromised flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area grade of “U” 
normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the SEE, additional training 
will not constructively improve examinee performance, it is not required, but the SEE will 
thoroughly debrief the examinee. (T-3) 
14.3.  Evaluation Methods.  The primary method of determining an examinee's level of 
knowledge and proficiency is observation of job performance on live missions.  When conditions 
such as mission availability preclude evaluation of a particular event on a live mission, it may be 
evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., mission simulator, verbally or academic ground 
evaluation scenario) if allowed in the evaluation requirements section of this chapter.  SEEs will 
make every effort to evaluate all required areas on a live mission before resorting to alternatives. 
(T-3)  Document alternate evaluation methods for each area in the Mission Description section 
of the AF Form 8.  The questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation 
should be limited to items not easily determined by observation and related to the scenario being 
employed for the evaluation. 
14.4.  Critical Areas.  Critical grading areas are defined as events that require a degree of 
knowledge and proficiency essential for safety and mission accomplishment.  If an examinee 
receives a “U” grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be 
unqualified. (T-3)  Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” following the applicable area title. 
14.5.  Evaluation Requirements.  Examinee must perform all areas specified in this chapter for 
a complete positional evaluation. (T-3)  Evaluation requirements are outlined in Table 14.1 
AFMAN13-1 BCCV2  22 OCTOBER 2020 
111 
 
14.5.1.  The initial qualification Evaluation (IQE)/RQE positional evaluation will 
demonstrate the examinee’s ability to operate mission systems and apply local theater 
guidance to effectively accomplish the mission. (T-3) 
14.5.1.1.  The examinee will complete a written examination derived from the MAJCOM 
Master Question File and unit derived Local Operating Procedures. (T-3) 
14.5.1.2.  The examinee will perform duties as the MCC/MCCT during live daily flying 
operations to support evaluation objectives. (T-3) The SEE will determine whether the 
extent of live flying activity is sufficient for evaluation purposes. (T-3)  The evaluation 
may continue on a subsequent day to fully meet evaluation requirements.  Area 13, Daily 
Flying Operations, must be accomplished live. (T-3)  Other areas may be accomplished 
by alternate methods. 
14.5.2.  Upon completion of mission qualification training (MQT), Stan/Eval will administer 
a 25-question, written mission qualification evaluation (MQE). (T-3) The passing score is 85 
percent.  Stan/Eval will maintain at least two different tests on file or utilize a computer-
generated testing program. (T-3)  A positional evaluation is not required upon completion of 
MQT. 
14.5.3.  Upon successful completion of the MQE, Stan/Eval will place examinee into CMR 
status. (T-3) 
14.6.  Evaluation Objective.  The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all 
MCC/MCCT duties safely and effectively in accordance with technical orders and operations 
directives. (T-3)  A rating of Q, Q- or U will be given to each area. (T-2)  Critical areas are rated 
Q or U. (T-2)

Chapter 15 
KOREAN THEATER AIR CONTROL SYSTEM WD/AWO/SD QUALIFICATION 
EVALUATIONS 
15.1.  Purpose.  This chapter, in conjunction with AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol 2, gives 621 ACS 
assigned SEE procedures and criteria to use during Korean Theater Air Control System WD, 
AWO, and SD evaluations.  Adherence to these procedures and criteria ensures an accurate 
assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of crewmembers. 
15.2.  Rating Guidance.  Rating guidance for SEEs is provided in AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol 2 
and in this chapter for conducting all evaluations.  All non-critical area ratings are based on a 
three- level rating system (i.e., Q, Q-, or U) described below.  Critical grading area ratings are 
based on a two-level rating system (i.e., Q or U) described below. 
15.2.1.  A Qualified area grade (Q) is the desired level of performance.  The examinee 
demonstrates a satisfactory level of knowledge of all required information, performed duties 
within the prescribed tolerances and accomplishes the assigned mission with no 
discrepancies. 
15.2.2.  A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the 
assigned area tasks, but requires a written debriefed comment or additional training as 
determined by the SEE.  Deviations from established standards must not exceed the 
prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety. (T-3) 
15.2.3.  An Unqualified area grade (U) is given for performance outside allowable 
parameters or deviations 
from 
prescribed procedures 
that jeopardized mission 
accomplishment or compromised flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area grade of “U” 
normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the SEE, additional training 
will not constructively improve examinee performance, it is not required, but the SEE will 
thoroughly debrief the examinee. (T-3) 
15.3.  Evaluation Methods.  The primary method of determining an examinee's level of 
knowledge and proficiency is observation of job performance on live missions.  When conditions 
such as mission availability preclude evaluation of a particular event on a live mission, it may be 
evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., mission simulator, verbally or academic ground 
evaluation scenario) if allowed in the evaluation requirements section of this chapter.  SEEs will 
make every effort to evaluate all required areas on a live mission before resorting to alternatives. 
(T-3)  Document alternate evaluation methods for each area in the Mission Description section 
of the AF Form 8.  The questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation 
should be limited to items not easily determined by observation and related to the scenario being 
employed for the evaluation. 
15.4.  Critical Areas.  Critical grading areas are defined as events that require a degree of 
knowledge and proficiency essential for safety and mission accomplishment.  If an examinee 
receives a “U” grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be 
unqualified. (T-3)  Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” following the applicable area title. 
15.5.  Evaluation Requirements.  All areas specified in this chapter are required for a complete 
positional evaluation. (T-3)  Evaluation requirements are outlined in Table 15.1 
AFMAN13-1 BCCV2  22 OCTOBER 2020 
117 
 
15.5.1.  The IQE/RQE positional evaluation tests an individual’s ability to operate equipment 
and integrate with the crew to accomplish a mission.  An “SD Upgrade IQE” is defined as an 
evaluation given to a 621 ACS CMR AWO or a previously qualified SD from another MDS 
(at the SQ/DOs discretion), who has completed required SD training through the Chief of 
Operations Training.  Positional evaluations for upgrade to SD will include all grading areas 
necessary to perform the supervisory role. (T-3)  The SD evaluation will include weapons 
control supervision, air-to-air, check-in and air-refueling criteria. (T-3) 
15.5.1.1.  The examinee will complete an IQE written examination derived from the 
PACAF MQF and unit derived Local Operating Procedures. (T-3) 
15.5.1.2.  The examinee will perform duties as the WD/AWO or SD during live daily 
flying operations to support evaluation objectives. (T-3)  The SEE will determine 
whether the extent of live flying activity is sufficient for evaluation purposes. (T-3)  The 
evaluation may continue on a subsequent day to fully meet evaluation requirements.  
Area 19, Weapons Control Supervision (Critical) (SD Only), must be accomplished live. 
(T-3) 
15.5.1.3.  Evaluation requirements for the Air-to-Air portion of the qualification are to 
control a 2v2 or greater mission.  This must be a two-scope, two-frequency control event 
and examinee must accomplish this event live. (T-3) 
15.5.1.4.  Evaluation requirements for the Air Refueling portion of the qualification are to 
simultaneously control two flights of receivers and the tanker.  Examinee must 
demonstrate the ability to tactical two flights of receivers and the tanker. (T-3)  Examinee 
must demonstrate the ability to tactically control both tanker and receiver for an effective 
rendezvous. (T-3)  Due to operational constraints, this portion is normally accomplished 
in the simulator. 
15.5.1.5.  Evaluation requirements for the check-in portion of the qualification are to 
control five flights from check-in to check-out.  The examinee must accomplish this as a 
live control event. (T-3) 
15.5.2.  Upon completion of MQT, Stan/Eval will administer a 25-question, written MQE. 
(T-3)  The passing score is 85 percent.  Stan/Eval will maintain at least two different tests on 
file or utilize a computer-generated test program. (T-3)  A positional evaluation is not 
required upon completion of MQT. 
15.5.3.  Upon successful completion of the MQE, Stan/Eval will place examinee into CMR 
status. (T-3) 
15.6.  Evaluation Objective.  The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all 
duties safely and effectively in accordance with technical orders and operations directives. (T-3)  
A rating of Q, Q- or U will be given to each area. (T-2)  Critical areas are rated Q or U. (T-2)

Chapter 16 
KOREAN THEATER AIR CONTROL SYSTEM DATA SYSTEM TECHNICIAN 
QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS 
16.1.  Purpose.  This chapter, in conjunction with AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol 2, gives 621 ACS 
assigned SEE procedures and criteria to use during Korean Theater Air Control System Data 
System Technician (DST) evaluations.  Adherence to these procedures and criteria ensures an 
accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of crewmembers. 
16.2.  Rating Guidance.  Rating guidance for SEEs is provided in AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol 
2, and in this chapter for conducting all evaluations.  All non-critical area ratings are based on a 
three level rating system (i.e., Q, Q-, and U) described below.  Critical grading area ratings are 
based on a two level rating system (i.e., Q or U) described below. 
16.2.1.  A Qualified area grade (Q) is the desired level of performance.  The examinee 
demonstrates a satisfactory level of knowledge of all required information, performed duties 
within the prescribed tolerances and accomplishes the assigned mission with no 
discrepancies. 
16.2.2.  A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the 
assigned area tasks, but requires a written debriefed comment or additional training as 
determined by the SEE.  Deviations from established standards must not exceed the 
prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety. (T-3) 
16.2.3.  An Unqualified area grade (U) is given for performance outside allowable 
parameters or deviations 
from 
prescribed procedures 
that jeopardized mission 
accomplishment or compromised flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area grade of “U” 
normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the SEE, additional training 
will not constructively improve examinee performance, it is not required, but the SEE will 
thoroughly debrief the examinee. (T-3) 
16.3.  Evaluation Methods.  The primary method of determining an examinee's level of 
knowledge and proficiency is observation of job performance on live missions.  When conditions 
such as mission availability preclude evaluation of a particular event on a live mission, it may be 
evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., mission simulator, verbally or academic ground 
evaluation scenario) if allowed in the evaluation requirements section of this chapter.  SEEs will 
make every effort to evaluate all required areas on a live mission before resorting to alternatives. 
(T-3)  Document alternate evaluation methods for each area in the Mission Description section 
of the AF Form 8.  The questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation 
should be limited to items not easily determined by observation and related to the scenario being 
employed for the evaluation. 
16.4.  Critical Areas.  Critical grading areas are defined as events that require a degree of 
knowledge and proficiency essential for safety and mission accomplishment.  If an examinee 
receives a “U” grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be 
unqualified. (T-3)  Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” following the applicable area title. 
16.5.  Evaluation Requirements.  All areas specified in this chapter are required for a complete 
positional evaluation.  Evaluation requirements are outlined in Table 16.1 
AFMAN13-1 BCCV2  22 OCTOBER 2020 
125 
 
16.5.1.  The IQE/RQE positional evaluation demonstrates the examinee’s ability to operate 
mission systems and apply local theater guidance to effectively accomplish the mission. 
16.5.1.1.  The examinee will complete a written examination derived from the MAJCOM 
MQF and unit derived Local Operating Procedures. (T-3) 
16.5.1.2.  The examinee will perform duties as the DST during daily flying operations to 
support evaluation objectives. (T-3)  The SEE determines whether the extent of mission 
activity is sufficient for evaluation purposes.  The evaluation may continue on subsequent 
days to fully meet evaluation requirements. 
16.5.2.  Upon completion of MQT, Stan/Eval will administer a 25-question, written MQE. 
(T- 3) The passing score is 85 percent.  Stan/Eval will maintain at least two different tests on 
file or utilize a computer-generated testing program. (T-3)  A positional evaluation is not 
required upon completion of MQT. 
16.5.3.  Upon successful completion of the MQE, Stan/Eval will place examinee into CMR 
status. (T-3) 
16.6.  Evaluation Objective.  The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all DST 
duties safely and effectively in accordance with technical orders and operations directives (T-3).  
A rating of Q, Q- or U will be given to each area. (T-2)  Critical areas are rated Q or U. (T-2)
