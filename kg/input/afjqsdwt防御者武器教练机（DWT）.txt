1. PURPOSE. As directed by DAFI 36-2654, this AFJQS identifies the minimum training 
requirements to become a Defender Weapons Trainer. This AFJQS must be utilized at all 
installations utilizing the Defender Weapons Trainer program. This AFJQS applies to Security 
Forces NCOs assigned to perform duties as a Defender Weapons Trainer. This AFJQS will 
remain in effect until superseded or rescinded. 
 
2. TASK QUALIFICATION. Personnel will be qualified to the GO/NO GO standard on this AFJQS. 
GO means the individual can perform the task without assistance utilizing appropriate instructions or 
other procedural guidance. If required training listed in Part II of this AFJQS is provided through OJT, 
in-residence, distance learning (DL), or web-based courses, a supervisor/ trainer from that respective 
functional area and/or a supervisor/trainer assigned as the Combat Arms Training and Maintenance 
(CATM) Trainer will complete the trainer’s block to document training completion. Annual and in- 
service training listed in Part II of this AFJQS must be taught by certified CATM Section Chief or 
CATM Trainer. A task qualified supervisor/trainer/certifier from that respective functional area must 
document training and certification for a person to be considered trained and certified on a task. 
3. TRAINING DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINER/CERTIFIER IDENTIFICATION. 
Document training required by this AFJQS in accordance with DAMAN 36-2689, Training 
Program, and any automated learning management system (LMS) procedural guides. 
Military and civilian personnel will both utilize the Air Force approved LMS unless it is 
unavailable. In those instances, military and civilian personnel will utilize a paper copy record 
of this AFJQS and retain it in their On-the-Job training record for military and in the 
Supervisor’s Employee Brief for civilian personnel. Per DAMAN 36-2689, paragraph 5.2.11, 
core tasks in this AFJQS are defined as those tasks requiring third party certification. All tasks 
identified on this AFJQS require third party certification by a certified CATM member for the 
trainee to be considered certified. If a military or civilian trainee is assigned an additional duty 
or task not included in an individual’s CFETP or this AFJQS, the supervisor will add the task(s) 
to the Master Training Plan (MTP) and Individual Training Plan (ITP). 
 
4. ADDITIONAL DUTY or TASK. If a Defender Weapons Trainer is assigned an additional 
duty or task not listed in this AFJQS, the supervisor will develop an AF Form 797, Job 
Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS. The supervisor, trainer, or Program 
Manager will then develop a plan for the member to receive training and certification to become 
duty position or task qualified. 
5. RECERTIFYING. For tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, 
supervisors/trainers/certifiers will employ the evaluate-train-evaluate process to recertify 
personnel on tasks. Recertification is required annually, ensuring members are proficient on all 
AFJQS tasks. 
 
6. This AFJQS has been coordinated with all applicable Career Field Managers (CFM) and 
Major Command Functional Managers (MFM). The overall POC for this AFJQS is 
AFSFC/S3TC afsfc.s3tw.combatarmstraining@us.af.mil.
