Chapter 1 
GENERAL GUIDANCE 
1.1.  Purpose.  The purpose of this Manual is to provide installation commanders the appropriate 
guidance to host the most successful open house for their particular location.  This Manual is 
written to support planning and execution by providing planning staffs relevant interpretations of 
numerous regulations, instructions, organizations, and functions.  This publication applies to the 
Regular Air Force, the Air National Guard (ANG) and the Air Force Reserve (AFR). 
1.2.  Goal.  The Air Force hosts open houses to enhance the public awareness of Air Force 
preparedness, to demonstrate modern weapon systems and capabilities, to promote positive 
community and international relations, to showcase our Airmen and to support Air Force 
recruiting and retention.  Opening Air Force bases to the public provides opportunities for 
education and generates interest in the military and its role in national security.  The term "open 
house" identifies a traditional activity held on military installations and may or may not include 
an airshow.  (The terms “open house” and “airshow” have been used interchangeably in the past; 
this Manual uses open house, consistent with Department of Defense (DoD) policies and 
instructions (DoDD 5410.18 and DoDI 5410.19), as well as the Air Force implementing 
publication AFI 35-105, Community Engagement).  The use of the term open house is not 
intended to specify or dictate any predetermined level of access to military installations.  Inviting 
the general public onto the installation for an open house does not, in and of itself, cause the 
installation to lose its status as “closed” for the purposes of controlling political or ideological 
speech. 
1.3.  Orientation.   An Air Force open house is a community relations activity, which should 
generally highlight the mission, resources and personnel of the host base.  However, military 
equipment and people from other bases and Services may be invited to demonstrate additional 
capabilities.  The primary purpose of an open house is to educate the public, not to raise funds 
for morale, welfare, and recreation, non-Federal entities, or private organizations.  That does not 
prevent the Force Support Squadron from raising funds in excess of those needed for open house 
support or prevent authorized private organizations fundraising (to include authorized unit 
souvenir and/or memorabilia-sale activity) as specifically provided for herein so long as fund-
raising does not become the primary objective of the event.  See paragraph  1.15.1.2., paragraph  
5.3., and paragraph  7.4.4. concerning private organizations fundraising and concession sales. 
1.3.1.  Soliciting commercial sponsorship, in accordance with AFI 34-108, Commercial 
Sponsorship and Sale of Advertising, to help fund Force Support Squadron morale, welfare, 
and recreation elements of the open house, including funding for a family area or “kid zone,” 
is an acceptable practice.  Kid zone activities should be solely for the use of children and 
could include attractions such as jumping castles and small mechanical rides like carousels 
and small trains.  Mechanical rides intended for adults such as large roller coasters and Ferris 
wheels, along with games of chance or skill, are prohibited. 
1.3.2.  Open houses should be no more than three days in length.  A typical format is one or 
two show days in addition to a short rehearsal day. 
 
 
8 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
1.4.  Commander Considerations.  Installation commanders are encouraged to host an open 
house when it’s deemed in the best interest of their installation’s community relations program.  
Commanders should execute each open house with prudent oversight that balances the issues of 
force protection and operations tempo with the expected benefits of opening the base to the 
public. Commanders should evaluate the overall open house plan to ensure the event maintains a 
military orientation. Every step should be taken to avoid open houses taking on the character of 
commercial events, carnivals, fairs, or create an impression of a commercial, carnival or 
fundraising environment. To highlight the base mission and Air Force life, commanders may 
consider opening dining facilities, dormitories, maintenance shops, classrooms, flight simulators, 
and other unclassified facilities for public viewing.  Commanders should ensure an open house is 
properly funded before committing to the event.  An open house is not only an event open to the 
general public, but could also be a day when the commander hosts members of one or more 
community groups.  Consider inviting business leaders, educators, food service workers, medical 
professionals, housing authorities or students to the base for an orientation geared to the 
particular group.  The commander’s ultimate responsibility is to ensure the safe conduct of the 
open house event. 
1.5.  Aerial Demonstrations.  Aerial demonstrations may be conducted by both military and 
civilian fixed-wing and/or rotary-wing aircraft in public events. 
1.5.1.  Military Demonstration Teams.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
regards all the following as DoD/Canadian Department of National Defense sanctioned 
teams: 
1.5.1.1.  The U. S. DOD-sanctioned military teams (i.e. U. S. Navy Blue Angels, the U. 
S. Air Force Thunderbirds, and the U. S. Army Golden Knights); the USAF single-ship 
demonstration teams; the USN single-ship demonstration teams; the USN Leap Frogs; 
the USAF Wings of Blue; the USAF Heritage Flight and the USN Legacy Flight. 
1.5.1.2.  The Canadian Department of National Defense sanctioned military teams are the 
Canadian Forces Snowbirds, the Canadian Forces single-ship demonstration team (e.g., 
CF-18), and the Canadian Forces SkyHawks parachute team. 
1.5.2.  Civilian Aerial Demonstrations.  Civilian performers may be invited to provide aerial 
demonstrations, flyovers, and static displays (see paragraph  6.4.). Acceptance of such 
invitations does not constitute a gift of services to the Air Force regardless of whether the 
services are paid for by a third party or donated by the performer. 
1.6.  Ground Demonstrations/Displays.  Ground demonstrations/displays (including military 
aircraft and equipment, civilian aircraft, and other displays) may be permitted if the installation 
commander determines the displays further the community relations goals of the open house.  
Agreements for non-military displays should address permitted signs and liability (e.g., a hold-
harmless agreement); such displays should be informational in nature.  Limited sales may be 
permitted (see paragraph  1.10.). 
1.7.  Open House Recognition and Signs.  
1.7.1.  Signs should not cause the open house to take on the character of a commercial event, 
carnival or fair.  Avoid large and garish signs that create an unattractive patchwork of 
competing commercial messages.  Signs should not restrict viewing of open house activities. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
9 
1.7.2.  Signs cannot promote, display, or sell commercial products or services unless being 
used for commercial sponsorship or to advertise Force Support Squadron concessions. 
1.8.  Commercial Sponsor Recognition.  Handle signs and recognition for commercial sponsors 
in accordance with AFI 34-108, and paragraph  1.7.1. above.  Commercial sponsorship 
recognition (signs/displays) should be proximate to the morale, welfare, and recreation elements 
of the open house.  However, when sponsoring commercial acts or static displays, commercial 
sponsors may have a sign near the sponsored aircraft.  Civilian aerial acts that voluntarily 
participate in an open house, free of charge to the Air Force, may also have a sign near the 
sponsored aircraft. Installations should coordinate commercial sponsor recognition to maximize 
the benefit to morale, welfare, and recreation (throughout the year), as well as the benefit to 
community relations and to the overall open house.  Refer to DoDI 1015.10, Military Morale, 
Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Programs, Enclosure 2, paragraph 4(g) and paragraph  2.8.1., of 
this instruction for approval of commercial sponsorships. 
1.8.1.  Donor Recognition  .  Apart from the commercial sponsorship program, other entities 
or individuals may offer the Air Force or an Air Force non-appropriated fund 
instrumentality’s gift of goods and services, including aerial demonstrations, for the open 
house.  Air Force policy generally provides that donor/gift recognition for gifts given directly 
to the Air Force may not be made publicly and that special concessions or privileges may not 
be granted to these gift donors.  As such, responses to gifts for the benefit of an open house 
may include a thank you letter to the donor from the commander authorized to accept the 
gift.  A modest sign at the entry to the open house can be used to identify those donors who 
have helped make the event possible (logos should not be used on this sign).  For aerial 
demonstrations/acts, the announcer may note the donor in conjunction with the start of the 
act during the show; public affairs (PA) is responsible for providing guidance to avoid 
impermissible endorsements.  Consistent with public affairs guidance in AFI 35-113, 
Internal Information, a news release should not address gift donors unless mention of the gift 
is incidental to the story.  Some donors seek contributions from other groups or individuals 
and, in turn, combine those contributions to make gifts to the Air Force to support the open 
house; the Air Force does not recognize those contributors in an official manner (i.e. they 
should not be listed on the sign mentioned above or in any public announcements) unless 
they are included as donors in the gift offer.  Donors and/or their contributors may be 
separately entitled to recognition through an agreement entered as part of the commercial 
sponsorship program.  Donors or contributors to donors may announce a gift through a news 
release, publicity, advertising or any other means.  Such announcements should not imply 
that the AF or its personnel endorse the donor or contributor. 
1.9.  Safety.  Safety, both air and ground, is the priority at all times.  Do not execute aerial 
performances or explosives events/pyrotechnic displays that endanger the safety of spectators, 
participants or the surrounding community, or that threaten damage to property.  Official military 
demonstrations will use criteria provided in AF and MAJCOM instructions, and are subject to 
DoD issuances (listed in Attachment 1) and Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
Aeronautics and Space (T-0). 
 
 
10 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
1.10.  Showmanship and Professionalism.  In developing and performing aerial events, 
supervisors and participants should remember the objective is to demonstrate Air Force 
professionalism and competence to the general public.  Strict compliance with show lines, 
procedures, and minimum altitude restrictions reflects both professionalism and good 
showmanship by providing spectators, including those in the rear of the spectator area, an 
unobstructed view of the aerial performance.  Static display crews are required to remain with 
their equipment to greet the public and answer questions.  If only one Airman travels with the 
aircraft, common sense should be used to allow for appropriate breaks for food, restrooms, etc., 
but the goal should be to maximize the time they are available to interact with the crowd.  
Additionally, do not inter-mingle commercial vendors selling memorabilia with the static 
displays.  Ensure the static displays are separated, by a reasonable distance, from the area where 
commercial vendors are conducting sales (see paragraph  6.5.).  The exact distance will be based 
on the area available and is left to the discretion of the installation commander.  Installations may 
only permit private organizations (see paragraph  1.13.6. and paragraph  6.10.) and non-Federal 
entities providing warbirds or other static displays to sell memorabilia near their static displays 
pursuant to a concessionaire contract.  Military personnel may not conduct sales in uniform.  POs 
affiliated with a particular aviation unit (e.g., spouses’ club) may sell unit memorabilia, subject 
to Air Force Trademark/Service Mark controls, and pursuant to an authorized concessionaire 
contract.  Installation commanders may restrict alcohol consumption by personnel in uniform 
during the open house. 
1.11.  Fees.  Installations may not charge for admission, parking, or viewing of any activities nor 
may installations permit donation jars or other suggestions that donations are encouraged for 
Government services provided without charge. Charges for boarding or viewing aircraft or other 
equipment are also prohibited. Photos of attendees donning military clothing or seated in military 
aircraft or equipment may not be offered for sale. Owners and/or operators of aircraft not owned 
by the Federal Government are prohibited from imposing admission charges to view or enter 
their aircraft, however, they may post a sign over a donation receptacle stating that donations are 
accepted. Requests for donations may not imply government endorsement or benefit.  Address 
details of the arrangement in the contract or other agreement for the display. 
1.11.1.  While open house programs with advertising may be sold, a no-cost version of the 
event schedule will be readily available at no charge (see paragraph  5.4. for possible 
restrictions). 
1.11.2.  Installations may not impose unreasonable restrictions on visitors to encourage 
purchase of services.  For example, coolers may not be prohibited to stimulate soft drink 
sales.  However installations may ban coolers or other carry-in packages for security or 
crowd control concerns.  Ensure the installation provides free water and restroom facilities. 
1.11.2.1.  Bottled water may not be purchased with appropriated funds except as 
authorized in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, paragraph 4.58.  
1.11.3.  Fees for viewing, concession and display spaces are addressed in paragraph  1.13. 
1.12.  Overseas Open Houses.  For U.S. military installation events open to the public outside 
the continental United States, Canada and Mexico, event approval rests with the unified 
Combatant Commander in whose geographic area the event occurs.  The commander may 
delegate the responsibility for event approval to the Air Force Component public affairs, and for 
participation approval to the Air Force Component Commander.  Critical aspects of all overseas 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
11 
events should be coordinated with appropriate host nation authorities as early as possible.  Open 
houses conducted overseas utilize resources under the operational control of the theater 
commander or, with concurrence of the owning MAJCOM, those on temporary duty within the 
theater.  The operational control of the participating MAJCOMs over their own aircraft is not 
preempted or diminished. NOTE:  When reading this Manual for guidance on conducting 
overseas open houses, substitute host nation aeronautical agency for Federal Aviation 
Administration. 
1.13.  Reserved Space.  Installations may authorize tent/booth/chalet/display space under the 
permissible arrangements below.  Individuals or non-Federal entities may not have exclusive use 
of any part of the open house premises during an open house unless pursuant to an authorized 
arrangement, as detailed below. 
1.13.1.  Commander’s Hospitality Tent.  The installation may establish a single, 
commander-hosted, distinguished visitor tent, offset from the center of the show and paid for 
by Appropriated Funds; the tent may not have a sponsor or signage.  Invitees are as 
authorized in Official Representation Funds and public affairs guidance (see AFI 65-603, 
Official Representation Funds).  Invitations may not be used to solicit commercial 
sponsorship or donations.  No charges may be imposed for admission to the commander’s 
tent (See paragraph  1.8. and paragraph  6.11. for additional guidance.).  Individuals and non-
Federal entities may offer enhancements to the commander’s hospitality tent as conditional 
gifts to the Air Force, but are not entitled to any preferential treatment (e.g., the right to 
nominate invitees to the Commander’s Hospitality Tent), as an expression of implied 
recognition for such a gift. 
1.13.2.  Open House Operations.   The installation may set aside space necessary for 
management and logistics for the open house.  This category includes space for volunteer 
management and for aerial or ground event performers. 
1.13.3.  Ground Displays.   Exhibitors may use space to provide displays open to the public 
as part of the open house.  This category includes Federal agencies, contractors providing 
ground displays, and other non-Federal entities.  All displays in this category should directly 
contribute to the open house (i.e., highlight the mission and resources of the host base and 
educate the public about the military).  Community organizations and non-Federal entities 
requesting exhibit space in order to distribute other information to attendees may receive 
space as Government support if their participation meets DoD 5500.07-R, Joint Ethics 
Regulation (JER), section 3-211.  Per Joint Ethics Regulation paragraph 3-211, such displays 
must be of interest and benefit to the local civilian community or DoD and must support DoD 
community relations with the immediate community and/or other legitimate DoD public 
affairs interests; commercial marketing is not permitted in this category.  Installations will 
ensure they avoid commercialization of the open house. (T-0) 
1.13.4.  Concessions  .  Force Support Squadron may use space to sell refreshments or 
merchandise, either on their own or through a concession agreement.  Force Support 
Squadron concessionaires may use space to sell concessions (and for associated logistics and 
management) according to the terms of the concessions contract (see paragraph  5.3.). 
 
 
12 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
1.13.5.  Attendees.  The installation may provide space as protection from the weather and 
bleachers or chairs for all attendees or reserved them for attendees who are disabled, elderly, 
pregnant, etc.  Make arrangements for disabled spectators in accordance with applicable 
laws.  Concerns for space, safety, transportation, logistics, and security usually lead to a 
prohibition against attendees bringing personal tents to the event except for unique 
circumstances that require approval by the installation.  Do not restrict personal tents for the 
purpose of increasing the use of tent concessions. 
1.13.6.  Tent and Seating Concessions.  The Force Support Squadron may rent tents, 
bleachers or chairs as a concession, either directly or through a concessionaire.  The 
concession arrangement should not pose an unreasonable restriction on attendees who wish 
to view open house events without purchasing the concession.  Tent/seating space provided 
as a concession may be reserved, as long as the reservation process is open to the public.  
Accommodation space may include provisions for food, beverages, and premium portable 
restrooms as part of the concession if provided through Force Support Squadron.  Tent space 
or seating may not be re-sold or used for other sales not covered by the concession contract 
(see paragraph  5.3.). 
1.13.6.1.  Tents rented to sponsors for use as hospitality tents are not to be used as 
sponsors’ products/services display areas within view of the general public.  No sponsor 
signage is permitted on tent exterior other than uniform sized signs that identify the host.  
These signs are to be provided by the Force Support Squadron.  Interior signage should 
not be visible to the general public. 
1.13.7.  Commercial Sponsor Displays.  Display areas may be provided (at the sponsors’ 
expense) for the use of Force Support Squadron morale, welfare, and recreation commercial 
sponsors for display of sponsor products/services pursuant to sponsor agreements (see AFI 
34-108, Attachment 2, Standard Commercial Sponsorship Agreement).  No selling of 
sponsor products is permitted in conjunction with these displays. 
1.13.8.  Space as Government Consideration Pursuant to a Contract  .  Both appropriated 
funds and non-appropriated funds contracts may include reserved space as part of the 
Government consideration.  The details of such an arrangement should not detract from the 
overall community relations goals of the open house.  For example, Government 
consideration for demonstrations procured via contract with Air Force funds (e.g. a warbird 
demonstration or civilian aerial demonstration) could include tent space for the performers or 
otherwise for the contractor’s use.  If alternative forms of consideration are used in non-
appropriated fund contracts, the contract then stipulates that there is a dollar value associated 
with the exchange and the amount is stated in the payment terms.  Contracting Officers 
determine if the consideration is fair and reasonable and document the file accordingly.  Use 
of Government space during the open house need not relate directly to performance of the 
contract; however, any such tent space may not be used to avoid prohibitions against 
commercial signs, advertising, or display of products or services (see paragraph  8.2.4.). 
 
 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
13 
1.14.  Music Royalties.  Installations must comply with all Federal laws regarding the 
compensation of musicians for the use of their copyrighted music.  Performers are responsible 
for paying their royalties to the appropriate licensing agency.  If the base creates a performance 
that requires copyrighted musical support the installation is responsible for paying the royalties 
associated with their event only.  The International Council of Air Shows has negotiated rates 
with the three major licensing agencies: Broadcast Music, Inc., American Society of Composers, 
Authors and Publishers and Society of European Stage Authors and Composers.  Installations 
can make their own arrangements or take advantage of the International Council of Air Shows 
rates.  Another option is to have a local radio station broadcast from the event.  Music royalties 
may be funded by appropriated funds only for performances otherwise supported by appropriated 
funds. NOTE:  Reference to International Council of Air Shows or their products does not imply 
an endorsement by the Air Force.  Any interaction with this organization is optional. (T-0) 
1.15.  Private Organizations and Non-Federal Entities.  Private organizations and other non-
Federal entities can have a limited role in organizing and funding an open house; however, the 
installation commander and the open house staff retains overall control of the event.  All 
inherently governmental functions are performed by Air Force personnel.  Private organizations 
and non-Federal entities may, for example, raise funds and accept donations from outside 
sources, donate funds and in-kind gifts to the Government, fund expenses not ordinarily borne by 
appropriated funds or non-appropriated fund, provide voluntary services to support the open 
house (see paragraph  7.6. for procedures), and offer publicity separate from the event itself in 
exchange for donations.  AF personnel may not solicit non-Federal entities or private 
organizations to fundraise for the purpose of gifting items/funds raised to the Air Force.  Private 
organizations or non-Federal entities involvement in an open house is pursuant to a specific 
permission or agreement (based on statutory or regulatory authority applicable to the type of 
involvement), such as a contract, gift acceptance, agreement for gratuitous services, commercial 
sponsorship agreement (AFI 34-108, Attachment 2, Standard Commercial Sponsorship 
Agreement). 
1.15.1.  Private organizations are governed by AFI 34-223, Private Organization (PO) 
Program.  Private organizations are base-chartered, self-sustaining special-interest groups, 
set up by people acting exclusively outside the scope of any official capacity as military 
members, employees, or agents of the Federal Government.  Private organizations are not 
Federal entities and are not to be treated as such.  They operate on Air Force installations 
with the written consent of the installation commander. 
1.15.1.1.  While private organizations normally are required to carry insurance coverage, 
private organization members are still personally liable to civil lawsuits in the event of a 
serious accident.  If a private organization decides to contract for aerial acts or other 
activities, members could be exposed to personal liability. 
1.15.1.2.  A private organization composed primarily of Government employees is 
generally unable to enter into appropriated funds contracts because Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) Part 3.601(a) prohibits contracts with a Government employee or a 
business concern or other organization owned or substantially owned or controlled by one 
or more Government employees.  In accordance with FAR 3.602, the agency head, or a 
designee not below the level of the head of the contracting activity, may authorize an 
exception to the policy in FAR 3.601(a) only if there is a most compelling reason to do 
so, such as when the Government’s needs cannot reasonably be otherwise met.  This does 
14 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
not bar private organization operation of a concession pursuant to a Force Support 
Squadron or concessionaire contract (AFI 34-101). 
1.15.2.  As the term “non-Federal” implies, a non-Federal entity is composed of individuals 
acting outside the scope of any official capacity as officers, employees, or agents of the 
Federal government.  Non-Federal entities operating outside the Air Force private 
organization program have fewer constraints than do private organizations.  Examples of 
such non-Federal entities include professional military organizations, local chambers of 
commerce, commercial entities, or organizations of community or business leaders formed 
for the specific purpose of promoting an open house. 
1.15.3.  Avoid giving the public the perception a private organization or non-Federal entity is 
hosting the overall event, or any portion of it, except for commercial sponsorship of 
individual civilian aerial acts with a Commercial Sponsorship Agreement with Force Support 
Squadron or pursuant to an authorized Air Force Outgrant (lease or license) of specified areas 
of the open house.  Air Force, private organizations and non-Federal entity websites and 
other publicly disseminated media should clearly convey to the public the fact the private 
organization or non-Federal entity is only supporting the installation with the open house and 
no Federal endorsement is implied.  Do not incorporate the name of a non-Federal entity in 
the name of the open house.  If a non-Federal entity’s involvement in the planning, 
contracting, funding or execution of an open house does rise to the level of overall substantial 
support, then those aspects of the event for which the entity is responsible for should be 
memorialized in a lease or license (or similar agreement such as a Community Partnership 
Agreement or Community Relations Event Memorandum of Agreement), located (to the 
extent possible) in discernible physical areas of the installation, and the public should be 
placed on notice of such non-Federal entity control (e.g., crowd control measures, quality of 
food/beverages, selection of vendors) through appropriate signage. 
1.15.4.  Non-Federal entities and private organizations should make it clear to all prospective 
donors that they do not represent the Air Force.  They may not extend commercial 
sponsorship or other recognition benefits or advertising privileges on the installation, or 
suggest Air Force endorsement of sponsors or sponsorship arrangements or official 
involvement in obtaining them. 
1.15.5.  A DoD employee who is an active participant in a non-Federal entity (including a 
private organization) or has been an officer of the non-Federal entity (including a private 
organization) within the last year, or who has a financial interest in the non-Federal entity, is 
generally prohibited from engaging in any official activity in which the non-Federal entity or 
private organization is a party or has a financial interest. These rules apply to personnel who 
have official responsibilities in connection with an open house. See paragraph  7.4.5.1. for 
definitions; consult the installation legal office for ethics advice on conflicts of interest. 
1.15.6.  Unless restricted by State or local law, a non-Federal entity may raise funds and 
accept donations.  Fundraising activities on an Air Force installation must comply with the 
requirements of Joint Ethics Regulation Sections 3-210 and 3-211 and AFI 36-3101, 
Fundraising within the Air Force.  A private organization or unofficial activity, as defined in 
AFI 34-223, paragraph 1.1., must also comply with the provisions of that instruction, 
including the limits of on-base solicitation.  DoD employees are subject to further restrictions 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
15 
including soliciting from subordinates or prohibited sources and using DoD position, title or 
authority for non-Federal entity fundraising (T-0). 
1.16.  Joint Bases.  Open houses at joint bases are conducted according to Supporting 
Component regulations, policies, and procedures, except for the operation, safety, and security of 
mission assets, which follow supported component regulations, policies, and procedures. 
1.17.  Contracting.   The installation and Air Force non-appropriated fund instrumentalities may 
accomplish some open house functions via appropriated funds and non-appropriated fund 
contracts.  Overall event management or individual services may be contracted.  Before 
contracting an open house function, consider whether the duties are inherently governmental (per 
existing contracting regulations).  Combined appropriated funds and non-appropriated funds 
contracts should segregate the two categories of funds and corresponding contract 
products/services.  The practice of accepting pre-negotiated contracts from a non-Federal entity 
or Private Organization is disfavored and is limited to those non-mission critical areas of the 
open house permitted to have “Private” funding by the Funding Annex in Attachment 4.  Even 
if permitted, the respective roles, responsibilities and liabilities of the Air Force and the tendering 
party are to be captured in an agreement between the parties that also includes independent 
documentation of the qualifications of the performing contractor and the specifications and 
quality controls of the goods or services provided. The agreement between the parties should 
include a requirement that all such contractors be vetted through the appropriate functional 
installation office.

Chapter 3 
ORGANIZATION 
3.1.  Open House Staff.    The installation commander approves the open house staff.  It acts on 
the commander’s behalf to plan and execute the open house.  Wings may tailor the staff 
organization to fit their needs.  See the General Planning Checklist (Attachment 2, Section 
A2A) for expanded planning factors.  A chart depicting typical organization and key members 
follows (also shown in Figure 3.1): 
3.1.1.  Open House Director.   Leads the planning and execution of the open house.  Should 
be an O-4 or higher and a highly qualified member of the host unit or wing.  At least 90 days 
prior to the event, the director should be available on a full-time basis. 
3.1.2.  Air Operations Officer.  Develops and aids in the execution of the flying operations.  
Coordinates with the Federal Aviation Administration, Airfield Operations (including air 
traffic control and airfield management), transient alert, the air boss and announcer, 
demonstration teams, explosives/pyrotechnics team, explosive ordnance disposal, weather, 
and briefing teams.  At least 60 days prior to the event, the air operations officer should be 
available on a full-time basis.  See the Air Operations Planning Checklist (Attachment 2, 
Table  A2.1) for specific responsibilities. 
3.1.3.  Ground Operations Officer.  Develops and executes the ground operations.  
Coordinates all activities inside the crowd control line for the event.  Determines spectator 
areas and vehicle routes.  This includes static display and performer parking and servicing, 
plus set-up of concessions, displays, sanitation, transportation, communications, and all other 
event support activities.  Coordinates antiterrorism measures with Security Forces, explosive 
ordnance disposal, safety and emergency response personnel.  Coordinates with Public 
Health and Bioenvironmental Engineering to ensure procedures are implemented for safe 
sanitary food and water.  Coordinates with Civil Engineer to utilize their expertise in power, 
water, traffic engineering, etc.  At least 60 days prior to the event, the ground operations

efforts as necessary.  Approves the portion of the open house announcer’s script pertaining to 
recognition of commercial sponsors. 
3.1.8.  Security Forces Coordinator.  Develops plans for base security, and force 
protection, particularly antiterrorism.  Drafts or reviews the antiterrorism/force protection 
plans for the open house in accordance with MAJCOM directives and updates through 
coordination with the installation Antiterrorism Officer, open house director and emergency 
response coordinator.  Ensures there is adequate base and flight line access for both military 
and civilian performers.  Provides announcer clear instructions and written verbiage to 
announce in specific emergencies.  Coordinates with civilian law enforcement agencies for 
additional support as needed.  Ensures legal coordinator is involved in jurisdictional issues 
regarding18 U.S. Code (USC) § 1385, Posse Comitatus Act, concerns (see paragraph 10.3.2.) 
3.1.9.  Emergency Management Coordinator.  Normally, a coordinated effort orchestrated 
and managed by the civil engineer Office of Emergency Management, Fire Chief or most 
logical representative with direct planning and support from representatives from the base 
fire department, Security Forces, bioenvironmental engineering, medical services, installation 
Antiterrorism Officer, explosive ordnance disposal and Civil Engineer readiness to develop

commander and normally filled by the mission support group commander or other senior 
representative.  This person is responsible for all incident management coordinating and 
response support actions during emergency responses.  Provides oversight to support and 
control emergency response supporting actions and activities.  The Emergency Operations 
Center director supports multiple incident commanders simultaneously, while providing 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
23 
senior level command and control for sustained response and recovery operations (see 
paragraph  9.4.8.). 
3.1.11.  Safety Coordinator.   Advises the open house director on safety issues.  Assists 
each member of the open house staff with their preparation of the risk assessments for the 
open house.  Risk assessments include water and food vulnerability assessment performed by 
Bioenvironmental Engineering and Public Health. 
3.1.12.  Legal Coordinator.  Advises the open house director and staff on all legal issues 
associated with the open house.  Reviews open house-related contracts, sponsorship and 
other agreements, and offers of gifts or gratuitous services to ensure they comply with all 
legal guidance and policy directives, including restrictions on conflicts of interest. 
3.1.13.  Air Boss.  The individual who, under operational authority delegated to him or her 
by the responsible person, has primary responsibility for control of air show operations (does 
not include transient/non-participating aircraft) on the active taxiways, runways, the air show 
demonstration area, and for coordination with the jurisdictional air traffic control facility and 
Federal Aviation Administration inspector-in-charge while the certificate of waiver and 
associated Class D Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) or temporary flight restriction (TFR) is in 
effect.  Runs day-of-event flying operations.  Thoroughly briefs performers on air operations 
and performer flight safety.  Directs aircraft on the ground within open house boundaries and 
in waivered airspace (air traffic control may assist, pursuant to local arrangements).  Verifies 
airspace waivered for a non-air traffic control agency to take control.  Receives briefings on 
and signs off on base disaster response plans prior to event.  The air boss can be an 
appropriated fund civilian contractor; however, once the FAA/ICAS Airboss Recognition 
Program is implemented, open houses will be required to comply with the program’s rules 
regarding who can be an air boss at an open house.  If a conditional gift offers payment for 
such services, the donor may not specify or influence the contractor selection through Air 
Force procurement procedures. (T-1) 
3.1.14.  Announcer.  Narrates the open house and keeps the audience aware of ongoing and 
upcoming events, sponsorship recognition, activities, entertainment and concessions.  
Frequently, the announcer is an appropriated fund civilian contractor.  If a conditional gift 
offers payment for such services, the donor may not specify or influence the contractor 
selection through Air Force procurement procedures. The highest priority responsibility for 
the announcer is crowd control during a mishap or emergency.  The announcer should be 
thoroughly familiar with the mishap/emergency response plan, location of emergency exits, 
and able to assist appropriate agencies with crowd control in the event of an emergency. 
3.1.15.  Hospitality Coordinator.   Organizes social events for the open house participants.  
Provides personnel to meet and greet arriving performers and in-process them as necessary.

tent for open house performers and static display participants (see paragraph  1.13.).  
Coordinates with the Force Support Squadron to include Force Support Squadron sponsored 
event publicity to open house participants and to deconflict social events and Force Support 
Squadron programs. 
 
 
24 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
3.1.16.  Protocol Coordinator.  Protocol duties and responsibilities vary and are often 
commander-driven.  They include formulating and executing detailed plans for commander-
hosted official open house functions and distinguished visitor attendance.  Protocol 
coordinators also advise the open house director and staff on protocol policy and procedures.  
It is usual to appoint a separate protocol coordinator to deal with the aerial demonstration 
team. 
3.1.17.  Other functions that might be useful on an open house staff include maintenance, 
transportation, logistics and a chaplain. 
3.2.  Timeline.  The date for the open house should be solidified as early as possible to help 
establish a timeline for the planning process.  Nine to fifteen months is a normal planning cycle 
for an open house.  A suggested planning guide, broken down by task, can be found in 
Attachment 3.  A key deadline is 1 July two years before the show date for requesting the 
Thunderbirds or Blue Angels.    Another key deadline is 1 July of the current year for AETC and 
ACC single ship demonstration teams and Heritage Flight.  More information can be found in 
Chapter 11 (Public Affairs) of this Manual. The International Council of Air Shows ® 
convention is normally held yearly in December allowing open house directors/staff an 
opportunity for face-to-face interaction with the performers (only contracting officers may enter 
into agreements with civilian performers, see paragraph  3.1.5. and Chapter 8) and the annual 
schedules of the DoD demonstration teams are announced to the public.  More information about 
International Council of Air Shows is available at its website, https://www.airshows.aero/ ® 
and the International Council of Air Shows publication, Air Show Manual ®. NOTE: Reference 
to International Council of Air Shows or their products does not imply an endorsement by the 
Air Force.  Any interaction with this organization is optional.  Private organizations and non-
Federal entities involved with the open house should be involved in the early planning stages.

Chapter 4 
OPERATIONS 
4.1.  Operational Criteria.  Safety is the primary consideration at all times.  Do not engage in 
activities that compromise the safety of spectators, participants/performers or that could damage 
or destroy property.  This Manual provides general guidance on open house air operations within 
the current boundaries of Air Force guidance.  Individual performers might have more restrictive 
operating limitations.  It is imperative to match weather and altitude operating limits with the 
performers and the airfield environment. NOTE:  Ensure military jet teams and single-ship 
demonstration teams comply with their specific regulations and instructions (for example Air 
Combat Command Instruction (ACCI) 11-401, Operational Procedures—Thunderbirds, and 
single-ship demonstration team AFI 11-246 series volumes and their supplements), which take 
precedence over this Manual. NOTE:  Air National Guard flight profiles outside the purview of 
AFI 11-246 are published in the ANG supplement to AFI 11-209. 
4.1.1.  Altitude Minimums.  The minimum altitudes published in AFI 11-202 Volume 3, 
General Flight Rules, AFI 11-209 and 14 CFR Part 91 are still applicable.  The Federal 
Aviation Administration may grant a certificate of waiver for an open house authorizing an 
altitude lower than normally authorized.  In certain cases, such as for military or civilian 
demonstration team performances, the Federal Aviation Administration may specifically 
waive the altitude requirements above.  Even if the Federal Aviation Administration 
authorizes a lower altitude, USAF fixed wing aircraft should not be flown lower than 500 
feet Above Ground Level (AGL) in accordance with AFI 11-209, except for military 
demonstration teams as noted above. 
4.1.2.  Rotary Wing Altitudes.  USAF rotary wing aircraft may be waived to operate below 
500’ AGL with MAJCOM and FAA concurrence to demonstrate unique capabilities, 
provided the site has been surveyed for safe operations and clear of both the public and 
obstacles.  Each MAJCOM sets minimum altitudes for the safe operation of their assets.  The 
approved aircraft demonstration profiles should conform to the guidance in the AFI 11-246 
series of instructions and/or MAJCOM instructions. 
4.1.3.  Airspeed Limitations.  Airspeed guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, applies to all 
aerial events.  The minimum airspeed for the operation of any fixed wing AF aircraft 
participating in any open house is stall speed plus 30 percent for the aircraft configuration.  
Airlift aircraft used in demonstrating standard, approved tactical procedures such as assault 
takeoffs or assault landings, may be flown at lower airspeeds, but not at airspeeds lower than 
specified in technical order publications.  The Federal Aviation Administration may grant a 
certificate of waiver for an open house authorizing airspeeds higher than normally 
authorized.  In this case, the maximum airspeed is limited to .90 Mach, or a lower airspeed if 
stipulated in a governing Federal Aviation Administration waiver, for all aerial 
demonstrations except for approved record flights and demonstration teams. 
 
 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
27 
4.1.4.  Weather Minimums  .  Operations weather requirements are Visual Flight Rules 
(VFR) in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3 and applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 3, 
[MDS Specific] Operations Procedures.  Weather minimums are flyover minimum altitude 
plus 500 feet and 3 miles visibility.  The air operations officer may set higher minimums 
based on the nature of the event, local terrain, or other factors.  The AFI 11-246 series 
contains weather minimums for single-ship military demonstration team profiles. 
4.1.4.1.  Flight demonstrations should not be conducted unless the ceiling is at least 1,500 
feet, and the visibility is at least 3 statute miles at the time of the demonstration.  
However, the air operations officer, after coordinating with the Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector-in-charge and the air boss, may adjust the minimum ceiling and 
visibility requirements at his/her discretion, but no less than 1,000 feet and 3 statute miles 
if: 
4.1.4.1.1.  (Except for North American military performers)  Aerobatic maneuvers 
are conducted by Category II and III aircraft (see Table 4.1) only within an 
operations area having a diameter of no more than 2 statute miles; and, 
4.1.4.1.2.  Originally scheduled aerobatic maneuvers are not modified or conducted in 
close proximity to the surface as a result of the reduced weather conditions. 
4.1.4.2.  Both the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and the Canadian Force Snowbirds have “flat” 
shows that require 1,000 feet and 3 miles of visibility.  Civilian performers may have a 
preapproved flat routine.  These should be addressed in advance and minimums 
established prior to execution. 
4.1.4.3.  For operations with ceilings below 1,500’ but above 1,000’, the air operations 
officer and Air Boss ensure FAR 91.155 is waived and the Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector-in-charge concurs with the operation. 
4.1.4.4.  During Open House activities, there are no flying events authorized with ceilings 
less than 1,000’. 
4.1.5.  Time Limitations.   Due to safety concerns and reduced public relations benefit, U.S. 
Air Force aerial events are authorized only between the beginning of morning civil twilight 
and the end of evening civil twilight.  HAF/A3O is the approval authority for waiver requests 
in accordance with AFI 11-209. (T-1). 
4.1.5.1.  The USAF Academy Wings of Blue parachute team is authorized an exception 
to this policy provided a Federal Aviation Administration waiver (FAA Form 7711-2, 
Certificate of Waiver or Authorization Application) is obtained for each night jump in 
accordance with 14 CFR Part 105.21. 
4.1.5.2.  Installation Commander has the approval authority for any civilian acts that 
occur after evening civil twilight. 
4.2.  Aerial Demonstrations.  Aerial demonstrations includes virtually every type of aerial 
participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft at an open house.  Military demonstrations are 
intended to provide the public a demonstration of the aircraft’s unique characteristics, 
capabilities, and mission.  Civilian demonstrations should be an adjunct to military activities and 
are further defined in paragraph  4.2.5. 
28 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
4.2.1.  Aerobatic Flight.  For open house purposes, the definition of aerobatic flight in 14 
CFR, Part 91.303 would normally be restrictive.  Therefore, a waiver to 14 CFR Part 91.303 
should always be requested on the FAA Form 7711-1.  For guidance in determining what 
maneuvers are considered aerobatic, reference FAA Order 8900.1, Vol 3, Chapter 6, Para 3-
143.A.2.  For overseas open houses, check with host nation aeronautic agency. 
4.2.2.  Critical Aircraft/Critical Wingman.   The critical aircraft or critical wingman is that 
aircraft closest to a spectator area. 
4.2.3.  Flyby.   For open houses, the Federal Aviation Administration’s definition of a flyby 
in FAA Order 8900.1 Volume 3, Chapter 6, Section 1, is a non-aerobatic pass or series of 
passes, performed by one or more aircraft.  Refer to AFI 11-209, paragraphs 1.6.4. and 1.6.7. 
for restrictions on airspeeds and minimum distance to spectator areas.  In any case, altitudes 
and distance from spectators will not be less and airspeeds will not be greater than the limits 
imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration Flight Standards District Office in the 
certificate of waiver (T-0). 
4.2.4.  Warbirds.  A warbird is defined as a privately-owned vintage military aircraft (or 
likeness thereof) that has been used in a military conflict or which is of significance in the 
history of military aviation.  Warbirds could be a US military aircraft or that of a foreign 
government.  The narration during the show should clearly note the aircraft’s military 
significance.  Warbirds will be painted in a military paint scheme. A minor sponsor logo is 
permitted keeping in mind the need to avoid commercialization of the event.  See 
Attachment 6 for a list of approved warbirds.  Installations can staff requests to designate 
additional aircraft as warbirds through their MAJCOM/A3 to HAF/A3OO for consideration 
(T-1). 
4.2.5.  Civilian Aerial Demonstrations.  Civilian demonstrations include civilian aircraft 
static displays and/or flying demonstrations.  Aircraft listed in Attachment 6, but not painted 
in a military scheme as referenced in paragraph  4.2.4., are categorized as civilian air 
acts/displays only.  Civilian aerial acts are permitted if they enhance or supplement the 
military activities.  Civilian demonstrations may contribute to the attraction of the overall 
event, which may afford greater military recruiting potential and stimulate interest in national 
defense.  Air races by fixed wing, rotary wing aircraft or hot air balloons are prohibited.  
Refer to paragraph  2.13.6., paragraph  6.4., and Attachment 4 for additional considerations 
and funding requirements. 
4.2.5.1.  Commanders, in consultation with their staffs, should give careful consideration 
to avoid selectively benefiting civilian enterprises when deciding to invite civilian 
demonstration teams to participate in their open house activities.  Even in instances where 
the funding of such acts is paid for by a third party, commanders retain ultimate 
responsibility for the safety of the open house. 
4.2.5.2.  Commanders and other officials responding to requests for transportation not 
specifically authorized by DoDI 4515.13, Air Transportation Eligibility, shall make no 
commitments concerning prospective travelers or cargo until they receive all required 
approvals.  When commercial airlift is unavailable, incapable, or unsuitable, and it is in 
the best interests of the Air Force, military airlift to support civilian aircraft (to include 
their aviation team(s)) may be requested on a case-by-case basis as an exception to DoD 
air transportation policy.  Exception to policy requests, with regard to transporting 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
29 
civilian aircraft and their aviation team(s), are submitted in accordance with DoDI 
4515.13, section 12 and AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement.  Exception to policy requests 
will be submitted by the base hosting the civilian aircraft and their aviation team(s) 
through their MAJCOM to HAF/A3O (info SAF/PAY and HAF/A3OO) for staffing to 
the CSAF and/or Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF) for approval 
consideration.  Exception to policy requests should arrive at HAF no later than 30 days 
prior to the desired date of movement of the civilian aircraft and/or aviation team(s) (T-
1). 
4.2.5.3.  Performer Qualifications.   (Continental United States events only)  The event 
organizer is responsible for determining all performers are qualified and the aircraft are 
airworthy in accordance with FAA order 8900.1 Vol. 3, Chapter 6, Section 1.  The 
Federal Aviation Administration inspector-in-charge verifies the Federal Aviation 
Administration qualification of civilian performers and their aircraft when reviewing the 
application for waiver.  These qualifications include: 
4.2.5.3.1.  Valid pilot certificate. 
4.2.5.3.2.  Valid medical certificate. 
4.2.5.3.3.  For pilots performing aerobatics, a current FAA Form 8710-7, Statement of 
Acrobatic Competency, or Transport Canada Aviation (TCA) Form 26-0307, 
Statement of Aerobatic Competency. 
4.2.5.3.4.  Formation and safety team (FAST) card or formation flights annotated on 
the statement of aerobatic competency if performing formation.  Note:  Non-DoD 
aircraft are required to have a DD Form 2401, Civil Aircraft Landing Permit.  
Obtaining this permit is the responsibility of the host base and aircraft 
owner/operator. See AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits. 
4.2.5.4.  Civilian Aerobatic Formation Flight.   (Continental United States events only)  
Formation aerobatics may be performed only if the team meets the practice and 
proficiency requirements established in FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6.  All 
teams or individuals conducting formation aerobatics must have demonstrated or 
substantiated their skills and have the “formation aerobatics” notation placed on their 
statement of acrobatic competency (T-0). 
4.2.5.5.  Non-Aerobatic Formation Flight.   (Continental United States events only)  
Civilian pilots who wish to conduct non-aerobatic formation flight in waivered airspace 
for an open house must possess a FAST card or a similar valid host nation formation 
training and evaluation credential that is acceptable to the Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector-in-charge (T-0). 
4.2.5.6.  Civil Fly-Ins.  Civil aircraft operators may be invited to fly their aircraft to an 
Air Force airfield for a base open house to foster better relations with the local aviation 
community.  Refer to AFI 10-1001 for civil fly-in procedures.  According to Defense 
Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy policy (DLA Energy-P-6, Authorized Customers and 
Cash Sales), a defense fuel support point may authorize defense working capital fund 
cash fuel sales for aircraft, vehicles, and equipment on display and/or perform at federally 
or installation-sponsored events such as an open house or air show.  Vehicles and 
equipment, other than those actually on display or directly involved in the air show 
30 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
performance, may not purchase defense working capital fund fuel by cash sale.  Defense 
Logistics Agency Energy is the fuel manager for all DoD. 
4.3.  Parachute Demonstrations.  Parachute demonstrations are restricted to appropriate events 
over airports, open bodies of water, or areas of land where adequate crowd control can be 
assured.  Only one parachute team or club from each service may take part in the same public 
event.  This restriction does not apply to static line paratroop drops. 
4.3.1.  DOD-Sanctioned Parachute Team.  DOD has officially sanctioned the U.S. Army 
Golden Knights parachute team, the U.S. Navy Leap Frogs, and SOCOM’s Para 
Commandos.  The Golden Knights team has two units designated as Black Team and Gold 
Team-jumping at two different locations. 
4.3.1.1.  The DOD-sanctioned military team determines site acceptability, effect of wind 
conditions, and location of exiting the aircraft.  This includes the decision to exit over a 
spectator area and the determination of authorized passengers onboard the aircraft during 
performances. 
4.3.1.2.  An application for a certificate of authorization should be submitted to the 
jurisdictional Federal Aviation Administration Flight Standards District Office.  Ensure 
the application for Certificate of Waiver or Authorization contains a statement that the 
military command or service has determined that adequate safety margins exist at the site 
for the scheduled demonstration by the specific team on a specific date. 
4.3.2.  Non-sanctioned DOD Parachute Teams.  Military jump teams not listed in 
paragraph  4.3.1. are not considered DoD-sanctioned by OSD.  They may be allowed to 
perform the same jumps as civilians with a United States Parachute Association (USPA) 
class D license if they meet all the requirements of a civilian team.  To jump over or into a 
congested area the unit is required to meet the same standards as DoD-sanctioned teams and 
hold a USPA class D license. 
4.4.  Foreign Military Teams (Continental United States events only).  The considerations 
and procedures of this chapter also apply to military teams sanctioned by other countries and 
approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.  Only the Federal Aviation Administration 
may issue the letter of approval for foreign military teams.  Foreign military flight demonstration 
teams and individual military pilots planning to perform aerobatic demonstrations in the U.S. 
should submit an application package at least 120 days prior to the first demonstration.  
Generally, Flight Standards personnel desire to observe a private demonstration performance 
before the approval is issued.  Performances at Air Force installations should be at no additional 
cost to the government. 
4.5.  Inspector-in-Charge (IIC).  The Federal Aviation Administration inspector-in-charge is 
the aviation safety inspector who conducts the feasibility study, participates in the preseason 
evaluation meeting, evaluates the application for waiver or authorization, recommends issuance 
or denial, and conducts the surveillance of the aviation event (See FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 6, 
Chapter 10). 
 
 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018

4.6.  Planning Considerations.  
4.6.1.  Crowd Line.    A physical barrier or a line marked on the surface of the ground or 
water that serves as a restraining line for designated spectator areas and provides the 
appropriate safety distances from the aerobatic box and/or show line for an aviation event.  
The crowd line is placed at a specified distance from the show line.  The restraining line and 
any necessary policing prevents spectators or other non-participating people from getting too 
close to the show line.  The ground operations officer with the help of Civil Engineering and 
Airfield Manager are responsible for the establishment of the crowd line including the 
distinguished visitor seating area, primary viewing section and distance needed from the 
show line to meet Federal Aviation Administration standards and Air Force runway standards 
for specific aircraft.  Snow or foreign object debris (FOD) fencing should be use for the 
crowd line barrier to prevent foreign object debris from blowing onto the taxiways.  The 
fencing may be anchored with concrete jersey barriers (see Figure 4.1. below). 
Figure 4.1.  Aerobatic Box. 
 
4.6.1.1.  Safety.  Safety is the primary factor in selecting spectator areas.  Attempt to 
center the spectator area on show center.  The spectator area should be oriented so that it 
offers an unobstructed view of the show line in both directions.  The distinguished visitor 
area should be offset from the center of the show area.  Movable objects, such as vehicles 
or aircraft, which would obstruct spectators’ view of the show line, should be 
repositioned. 
32 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
4.6.1.2.  Primary Spectator Area.   The primary spectator area is the main area 
designated for spectator use.  Safety is the primary factor in selecting spectator areas.  It 
is bounded by the crowd line and has lateral limits (ends) that are well defined.  This is 
the area where the public is generally expected to view the open house.  The primary area 
may be partitioned or divided due to physical constraints associated with the location.  
Aircraft must not fly over the designated spectator area less than 1,000 feet above the 
highest obstacle in that area unless specifically granted a waiver by the Federal Aviation 
Administration and the parent MAJCOM (T-0). 
4.6.1.3.  Secondary Spectator Area.  The secondary spectator area may be any other 
area where people have a natural tendency to gather to observe the event, for example, 
along a road adjacent to base.  The open house staff and the Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector-in-charge should identify secondary spectator areas before the 
aviation event begins and develop a plan to assure they are outside of the aerobatic box.  
These are also areas where it may not be completely possible to control the presence of 
people.  However, Security Forces should make every effort to prohibit secondary 
spectator areas within jurisdiction limitation.  No aircraft is permitted over any secondary 
spectator area less than 1,000 feet above that area unless approved by the Federal 
Aviation Administration (T-0). 
4.6.1.4.  Static Display.  All static display aircraft should be positioned well behind the 
crowd line. 
4.6.2.  Corner Markers.  Corner markers are natural landmarks or identifying panels placed 
500 feet from each end of the primary spectator area along the extended crowd line.  They 
depict the minimum distance performers may approach the crowd.  They should be easily 
identifiable objects starkly contrasting with the environment.  If using panels, they should be 
20 feet by 20 feet and have a vertical component of at least 4 feet. 
4.6.3.  Show Center.  The show center is a visible reference point along the show line 
usually denoting the center of the aerobatic area.  If possible, locate show center in a highly 
visible area such as a taxiway or intersection of a runway.  Show center should also be 
aligned with a building, road, or other feature identifiable from the air (see Figure 4.1). 
4.6.3.1.  The optimum position for show center is directly opposite the seating area and 
centered along the length of the crowd line.  The show center marker should be a large, 
highly visible vehicle or marker; white, blue, or orange, or other color that starkly 
contrasts with the environment. 
4.6.3.2.  Arrange the marker so it faces perpendicular to the show line and faces the 
primary spectator area.  This orientation gives the pilots a readily identifiable set of 
points increasing comfort levels and ensuring the highest degree of safety. 
4.6.3.3.  Large snowplows, buses, and semi-truck trailers all serve well as markers. 
4.6.3.4.  If the edge of the runway is the show line, the vehicles should be placed at least 
100 feet off the runway so as not to interfere with takeoff or landing. 
4.6.3.5.  A Notice to Airmen may be required for placement of the markers if near an 
active runway.  Check with the local airfield manager. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
33 
4.6.3.6.  Show center markers must not be sited earlier than rehearsal day and are 
removed after the last public performance or prior to resumption of normal airfield/flying 
operations.  The location and duration of these markers must be temporarily waived in 
accordance with the provisions of United Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and 
Heliport Planning and Design (T-0). 
4.6.4.  Bomb Burst Cross Point.  Bomb burst cross points are used by demonstration teams.  
The cross point for the bomb burst is located on the show line, at a distance from show center 
specified by the team and should be in compliance with the teams’ support manuals.  Ensure 
the area beneath the bomb burst run-in avoids densely populated areas including areas used 
for parking. 
4.6.4.1.  The bomb burst cross point is also marked with a highly visible object 
(preferably white or orange with high contrast to the surrounding area).  If using vehicles, 
locate the vehicle on and facing parallel to the show line.  If the edge of the runway is the 
show line, place the vehicles a minimum 100 feet off the runway. 
4.6.4.2.  Like show center, the bomb burst cross point should be located in a highly 
visible area. 
4.6.4.3.  Bomb burst cross point markers must not be sited earlier than rehearsal day and 
are removed after the last public performance or prior to resumption of normal 
airfield/flying operations.  The location and duration of these markers must be 
temporarily waived in accordance with the provisions of UFC 3-260-01 (T-0). 
4.6.5.  Control Point.  Control point is the specified location where the air boss, air 
operations officer and Federal Aviation Administration inspector-in-charge manage the 
event.  The appropriate communication system required to control the aviation event should 
also be located at this site.  The staff should position its open house operations center near the 
control point. 
4.6.6.  Show Line.   The show line is a readily visible reference positioned the required 
distance from the spectators and enhances pilot orientation during the performance.  The 
show line also serves as the longitudinal axis for the show.  Small rivers, roads, and runways 
all make excellent natural show lines.  Lines of parked buses, cars, or boats, although less 
desirable, may be the only alternatives when natural show lines are not available.  Special 
attention should be given to delineating show lines properly for high performance jet aircraft.  
Large vehicles should be used to designate show center and the bomb burst cross point to 
ensure they stand out from the terrain.  A surveyor or airborne observer should ensure the 
artificial show line is straight (see Figure 4.1). 
4.6.6.1.  To enhance safety, the show line may be moved toward or away from the 
spectator area to give the performer a more identifiable reference.  However, the show 
line cannot be moved closer to the primary spectator area than the minimum distance 
specified. 
4.6.6.2.  Establish the minimum show line distance from the spectator area for all 
participating aircraft using Table 4.1.  Under the circumstances listed below, the 
minimum distance can be reduced, as follows: 
34 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
4.6.6.2.1.  To 1,000 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the intended 
airdrop impact point, or to the drop zone boundary, whichever is greater, for the 
following: 
4.6.6.2.1.1.  On-base equipment airdrop demonstration. 
4.6.6.2.1.2.  On-base container delivery system demonstration. 
4.6.6.2.1.3.  On-base airdrop demonstration of personnel using round canopies, 
also known as tactical airborne demonstrations or personnel airdrops.  Tactical 
airborne demonstrations are conducted by paratroopers assigned to tactical units 
(e.g., the 82nd Airborne) and employ standard military equipment and procedures. 
4.6.6.2.2.  To 500 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the show line for 
helicopter operational demonstrations, and for fixed-wing assault landing or assault 
takeoff demonstrations. 
4.6.6.2.3.  To 50 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the landing target for 
the airdrop of precision parachute demonstration teams (for example, the Wings of 
Blue) when steerable, square main and reserve canopies are used.  The airdrop may 
include a high altitude low opening (HALO) demonstration. 
4.6.6.2.4.  To 15 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the landing target for 
the airdrop of DoD sanctioned teams (Army Golden Knights or Navy Leap Frogs) or 
precision parachute demonstration team members who hold United States Parachute 
Association PRO-ratings when steerable, square main and reserve canopies are used. 
4.6.6.3.  Mark show lines for events over water in a manner that ensures the lines are 
clearly visible and identifiable by the participating pilot.  Use prominent features such as 
boats, barges, or large buoys for events over water.  Two features do not make a 
definable straight line: a minimum of three features should be used.  It is critical that 
anything used to define the show line is securely anchored and should be monitored 
throughout the event to ensure it is not moving.  If such an item begins moving, stop the 
event until it is re-secured. 
4.6.6.3.1.  Whether using boats or some other markings, ensure they are in the same 
exact location each day.  This can be accomplished by using a global positioning 
system (GPS), buoy markers, etc. 
4.6.6.3.2.  Enlist the assistance of the Coast Guard/Coast Guard Auxiliary and/or 
State and Local Marine Police patrols to ensure other boats do not enter the 
demonstration hazard areas. 
4.6.7.  Show Lines and Spectator Areas.  Pilots performing flight demonstrations maintain 
minimum distances from the primary spectator area. 
4.6.7.1.  For aerobatic and other flight demonstrations, establish show lines at prescribed 
minimum distances from the designated spectator area.  These show lines are used as a 
reference by performing pilots or, in the case of a formation flight, by the formation 
leader.  Do not cross over these show lines toward any spectator area while conducting 
flight demonstrations. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
35 
4.6.7.2.  Flight over the primary spectator area is permitted when at or above 1,000 feet 
above the spectators.  Flight is non-maneuvering and straight and level or wings level in a 
normal climb.  Formation flight is also required to be in one direction only—back to front 
or front to back. 
4.6.7.3.  For formation flight demonstrations, adjust the formation leader’s ground track 
so that the critical wingman remains beyond the appropriate show line. 
4.6.7.4.  Show line categories, speeds, and distances are shown in Table 4.1.  These 
speeds are only for determining assignment to a show line, not maximum performing 
speeds. 
4.6.7.5.  When authorized by AFS-800, military demonstration teams and USAF Heritage 
teams are permitted to fly at a minimum altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstacle 
over the primary spectator area if the flight is non-maneuvering, straight and level or 
wings level in a normal climb, and the direction of flight is in one direction only—back 
to front or front to back. 
4.6.7.6.  Flight by rockets over primary spectator area is prohibited. 
4.6.7.7.  Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations, to include aerial photography, are 
not authorized unless authorized by the FAA Administrator and Secretary of Defense 
(SECDEF). 
4.6.7.8.  The responsible person makes every effort to discourage secondary spectator 
areas.  Secondary spectator areas cannot be under the aerobatic box.  Flight over the 
secondary spectator area is permitted by all civilian and military air show performers 
when the following conditions are met: 
4.6.7.8.1.  Minimum altitude is no lower than 500 feet above the spectators. 
4.6.7.8.2.  Until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 500 feet, it is profile limited to non-
maneuvering and wings level in a normal climb. 
4.6.7.8.3.  For rockets, flight over secondary spectator area is prohibited. 
4.6.7.8.4.  UAS operations, to include aerial photography, are not authorized unless 
authorized by the FAA Administrator and SECDEF (same as primary spectator 
areas). 
4.6.7.8.5.  For night demonstrations, refer to FAA Order 8900.1. 
4.6.8.  Establishment of Show Lines.  As described in Table 4.1, three different show and 
reference lines might be required when all three categories of aircraft are participating at a 
show site. 
4.6.8.1.  Establish the show and reference lines first, preferably using natural markings; 
then set the appropriate crowd lines and designate spectator areas.  It is important for all 
show and reference lines to be well marked. 
 
 
36 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
4.6.8.2.  The optimum situation is when prominent show lines such as runway 
centerlines, tree lines or other geographical features are 500, 1,000, or 1,500 feet from the 
spectators.  These distances from the show and reference lines to the crowd line for each 
category of aircraft are the standard.  Under some conditions the distances may be 
altered.  The best choice is a natural show line that runs along or parallel to and within 
200 feet laterally of a runway or taxiway.  Considerations for moving show lines are as 
follows. 
4.6.8.2.1.  Antennas, windsocks, tree lines and other obstacles that are hazards to the 
performers often necessitate moving a show line; even in these cases, the show line 
may not be moved any closer than the prescribed altered minimums. 
4.6.8.2.2.  The minimum 500-foot show line for Category III aircraft will not be 
waived (T-0). 
4.6.8.2.3.  For North American military jet teams, ensure both the Category I and 
Category III show lines are discernible at least two miles from show center at an 
altitude of 200 feet. 
4.6.8.3.  Category I Show Line.    The optimum show line distance from the spectator 
areas for Category I aircraft is 1,500 feet or greater. Aircraft performing aerobatics may 
not cross the reference line. 
4.6.8.3.1.  If the only well-defined show line is closer than 1,500 feet to a spectator 
area and it is not possible to move the spectator area, the Federal Aviation 
Administration may waive the show line down to a minimum of 1,200 feet (T-0). 
4.6.8.3.2.  When there is a reduction in the distance from the show line to the primary 
spectator area, a similar reduction is not permitted for the secondary spectator area 
side of the show line. 
4.6.8.3.3.  In no case allow less than 2,700 feet between the primary and the 
secondary spectator areas. 
4.6.8.4.  Category II Show Line.  The optimum show line distance from spectator areas 
for Category II aircraft is 1,000 feet or greater.  Aircraft performing aerobatics may not 
cross the reference line. 
4.6.8.4.1.  If the only well-defined show line is closer than 1,000 feet to a spectator 
area and it is not possible to move the spectator area, the Federal Aviation 
Administration may waive the show line to an absolute minimum of 800 feet (T-0). 
4.6.8.4.2.  When there is a reduction in the distance from the show line to the primary 
spectator area, a similar reduction is not permitted for the secondary spectator area 
side of the show line. 
4.6.8.4.3.  In no case allow less than 1,800 feet between the primary and the 
secondary spectator areas. 
4.6.8.4.4.  In no case should any part of the aircraft cross this reference line.  In the 
case of formations, adjust the flight leader’s ground track so that the critical wingman 
is no closer to the spectator area than the Category II show line. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
37 
4.6.8.5.  Category III Show Line.  The show line may not be closer than 500 feet from 
the primary or secondary spectator areas.  Aircraft performing aerobatics may not cross 
the reference line. 
4.6.8.5.1.  The 500-foot show line may also be used for Category I or II aircraft being 
flown non-acrobatically and parallel to the primary and/or secondary spectator area.  
In this case, ensure the show line is clearly delineated for high performance aircraft. 
4.6.8.5.2.  An arc directed away from the crowd, a pass in review maneuver, may be 
flown provided the aircraft remain at least 500 feet from the primary and secondary 
spectator areas. 
4.6.8.5.3.  If there is less than 1,800 feet between the primary and any secondary 
spectator areas, the site cannot be considered for an airshow waiver. 
4.6.8.5.4.  If there is less than 500 feet between the show line and the spectators, it is 
unlikely an airshow waiver will be approved. 
4.6.8.5.5.  In no case should any part of the aircraft cross this reference line, if preforming 
aerobatics.  In the case of formations, ensure the flight leader’s ground track is adjusted so that 
the critical wingman is no closer to the spectator area than the Category III show line.

4.6.9.  Aerobatic Box.  The aerobatic box is the area over which the aerobatic 
demonstrations are approved to be performed.  It is usually centered on the show center; 
however, sometimes an offset show center is required.  The width is determined by aircraft 
category and the length is dependent on the performer.  This is an important planning factor 
and should be considered when determining performer requirements.  Some U.S. jet teams 
require as much as 12,000 feet; consult the team’s support manual.  The Snowbirds and 
civilian teams typically require a shorter box.  The aerobatic box is also known as the 
aerobatic maneuvering area (see Figure 4.1.). 
4.6.9.1.  The Federal Aviation Administration requires that the aerobatic box be void of 
all people not specifically participating in the demonstration.  This includes homes, 
businesses, roads and secondary spectator areas.  The authorization for each person 
forward of the crowd line must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration 
inspector-in-charge and air boss (T-0). 
4.6.9.1.1.  Personnel may be allowed in the box providing they are necessary to the 
operation of the event, are properly briefed, are in communication with the air boss, 
and all participants are aware of them.  These personnel should be kept to a 
minimum. 
4.6.9.1.2.  The safety of spectators is of the utmost importance.  The strict nature of 
this Federal Aviation Administration guidance means that access to this area is 
controlled, and all spectators kept from entering the area.  The aerobatic 
demonstration cannot begin, or may possibly be terminated, if unauthorized personnel 
access the area. 
4.6.9.1.3.  Consideration should be given to those businesses and homes that may lie 
within the aerobatic box.  Bases should consider making special arrangements for the 
affected parties to ensure cooperation and assurance that the box is clear.  This may 
include inviting them to the commander’s distinguished visitor area.  The public 
affairs office can assist in notification and coordination. 
4.6.10.  Orientation Flights.  Guidelines for orientation and public affairs flights on Air 
Force aircraft are contained in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI 35-105.  
MAJCOMs may restrict orientation flights during open houses.  Passengers may not be 
onboard any civilian aerial demonstration aircraft or warbird while flying in an open house 
performance.  Pilots of civilian aerial demonstration aircraft or warbirds who are at the open 
house and wish to conduct orientation flights must originate and terminate the flight at a 
location outside of the military installation. (T-1) EXCEPTION:  personnel identified in the 
Federal Aviation Administration authorization to fly in warbirds performing Heritage Flight 
as dissimilar formation safety and program assurance observers are authorized to fly in 
Heritage Flights warbirds originating from or terminating at the installation. 
4.6.11.  Approved Maneuver.  Aerobatic maneuvers may not direct energy toward any 
spectator area or fly over the designated spectator area(s) below 1,000 feet above ground 
level (AGL) unless approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.  The Federal Aviation 
Administration approves maneuver packages for the US military demonstration teams, and 
Canadian Forces Snowbirds annually.  Civil and/or foreign military teams, flights, or 
individual acts are responsible for submitting sufficient information about a single maneuver 
or series of maneuvers to the Federal Aviation Administration for approval before 
40 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
performing these types of maneuvers.  For a more detailed discussion of approved 
maneuvers, reference FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6.  Certain related maneuvers 
and procedures, however, may be authorized as outlined below (T-0). 
4.6.11.1.  Approved maneuvers that are completed prior to reaching a point where the 
rollout and trajectory of the aircraft or the scatter pattern would not endanger the 
spectators if a catastrophic failure were to occur.  Approved maneuvers are maneuvers 
that have been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration for a specific performer 
and aircraft.  Upon request from the Federal Aviation Administration, performers are 
required to present evidence of the approval. 
4.6.11.2.  For the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, U.S. Navy Blue Angels and the 
Snowbirds, approved maneuvers include level or climbing (normal rate) wings level 
flight over designated primary spectator area generally from front to back or back to front 
at an altitude no less than 500 feet AGL over primary spectator area.  USAF Heritage 
Flight is approved to fly wings level over the designated primary spectator area from 
back to front at an altitude no less than 500 feet AGL.  All other performers are limited to 
at least 1,000 feet AGL over primary spectator areas unless they hold approval for the 
maneuver from the Federal Aviation Administration. 
4.6.11.3.  Maneuvers on an oblique line that passes 500, 1,000, or 1,500 feet to either side 
of a spectator area as appropriate to the category of aircraft being flown during oblique 
aerobatic maneuvers. 
4.6.11.4.  All category aircraft performing non-aerobatic or photo passes may use the 
500-foot show line and the corner markers. 
4.6.12.  Engine Run Areas.  Aircraft engines may not be started and aircraft may not be 
taxied in designated spectator areas or static display areas unless adequate measures are taken 
to protect the spectators.  For safety, personnel, vehicles and towed aircraft shall remain clear 
of taxiing traffic and may not pass within 200 feet behind aircraft with engines running or 
rotors turning, per AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction, or 
as required by local base regulation.  For physical protection, there should be a physical 
barrier to keep spectators away or use wing-walkers, marshallers or crowd control monitors 
who can prevent entry to the area by unauthorized people.  If moving aircraft from the static 
display area during the open house, moveable crowd barriers and crowd control monitors 
provide a flexible means of securing the area (T-1). 
4.6.13.  Aircraft Parking Plans.   Identify parking locations for all attending aircraft and 
ensure pavement classification number of movement surfaces (taxiways, parking aprons, 
etc.) is adequate for planned operations.  Determine if aircraft are towable or should taxi into 
position by type and if they require movement during the shows for performances.  Consider 
crowd control operations, emergency vehicle access, and grouping like protection level assets 
together when determining parking locations.  Also, consider whether aircraft should be 
refueled before or after the event.  Take into account the possibility of an explosion caused 
by fuel vapors in empty tanks versus full fuel tanks.  Installation commanders may grant non-
DoD performers use of available hangar space.  Non-DoD aircraft are not given preference 
over military aircraft. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
41 
4.6.14.  Maintenance Facilities.  For safety of flight maintenance, installation commanders 
may designate work areas to be used by non-DoD personnel for repairing an aircraft, grant 
access to shop facilities, and if requested, permit assistance by qualified Air Force 
maintenance personnel on a strictly voluntary basis.  Federal Aviation Administration 
certified maintenance personnel from either a civilian or warbird organization are required to 
supervise all maintenance personnel.  The Air Force and any of its volunteer maintenance 
personnel are not liable for any maintenance so performed.  Coordinate with the wing legal 
office before any work is accomplished to ensure liability is waived correctly through the use 
of an appropriate written waiver. 
4.6.15.  Temporary Flight Restrictions.  Temporary flight restrictions are a means to 
protect the aerial performers from airspace incursions by non-participating aircraft.  
Temporary flight restrictions are requested in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.145.  Temporary 
flight restrictions should be requested at the same time the application for the Certificate of 
Authorization is made.  Make the request by following the procedures listed on the Federal 
Aviation Administration website, at www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/airshow/tfr/. 
4.6.16.  Communications.  If practical, use discrete frequencies to control aerial 
performances.  The communication plan should also have discrete frequencies for ground 
operations, security/ emergency forces, and supervision.  Coordinate frequency requirements 
with the host base frequency manager.  In addition, attempt to avoid takeoffs or landings 
during any demonstration, as this may result in radio distraction and a safety of flight hazard.  
If takeoffs or landings occur during a demonstration, it should be briefed to the performers 
prior to the performance to minimize distraction.  The use of a common very-high frequency 
(VHF) for air boss is recommended.  Some civilian aircraft are unable to tune certain VHF 
frequencies and should be consulted prior to selecting the frequency. 
4.6.16.1.  Civilian VHF radios do not have access above 136.975 and thus the military 
victor frequencies may not be able to be used as the primary, secondary, or discrete 
frequencies. 
4.6.17.  Special Events and Flights of a Spectacular Nature.   Special events (e.g., car 
versus aircraft race, etc.) or flights not covered in AFI 11-209 or AFI 11-246 MDS specific 
volume require HAF AF/A3O approval, after the MAJCOM has accomplished appropriate 
risk management assessments. 
4.6.18.  Aerial Event Survey.  An aerial event survey is a feasibility survey of the airfield.  
It is the first step in creating the Federal Aviation Administration waiver request and the DD 
Form 2535.  It includes the following: 
4.6.18.1.  Identify the aerobatic box.  The show lines define the width of the box.  The 
performers define the length of the box.  The aerobatic box is usually centered on show 
center.  This area is to remain unpopulated during the performances. 
4.6.18.2.  Identify airspace constraints such as Class B, C, and D airspace, airways, traffic 
patterns, other airports, special use airspace, controlling agencies.  Per FAA Order 
8900.1, Vol 3, Chapter 6, Figure 3-201a, the standard Cat I (>245 knots) Performance 
Area is a radius of 3.5NM from the Airshow Center, from GL – 10,000’ AGL.  Some 
U.S. jet teams require as much as 12,000’ AGL; consult the team’s support manual. 
42 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
4.6.18.3.  Identify local constraints, for example, obstructions (natural or man-made), 
noise sensitive areas, environmentally sensitive areas, roads, secondary spectator areas 
(including parking areas), and ingress/egress routes for demonstration teams. 
4.6.18.4.  Identify local air traffic.  Determine departure and arrival fields and routing. 
4.6.18.5.  Identify other local events on same days -- fairs, races, festivals, etc. 
4.6.18.6.  Identify impact on airfield tenants. 
4.6.18.7.  Create an airfield diagram. 
4.6.19.  Airfield Diagram.  Open house staffs produce a diagram of the airfield/show site.  
Provide a copy to Civil Engineering to create any building/digging permits that might be 
required.  Coordinate changes to the diagram with all functional staff (see Figure 4.1.). C-2 
maps (showing building numbers and ground-relief lines) provided by civil engineering, or 
installation grid maps, are an excellent choice for the basis of the airfield diagram.  Airfield 
master plan charts or aerial photographs may be useful as well. 
4.6.19.1.  As a minimum, the airfield diagram should depict: 
4.6.19.1.1.  The complete aerobatic box. 
4.6.19.1.2.  The primary spectator area and crowd line; the Category I, II, and III 
show lines with distances to the crowd line; corner markers and their distance to the 
end of the crowd line; and any secondary spectator areas. 
4.6.19.1.3.  Show center and bomb burst cross points and latitude-longitude 
coordinates. 
4.6.19.1.4.  Magnetic (MAG) bearing of the runway, depiction of magnetic north, and 
the scale of the diagram. 
4.6.19.1.5.  Active and closed runways, performer parking, taxiways and run-up 
areas. 
4.6.19.1.6.  The location of the aviation event control point, police dispatch, 
ambulance, fire-fighting equipment, first aid locations. 
4.6.19.1.7.  Parachute landing areas. 
4.6.19.1.8.  Explosives events/pyrotechnic areas. 
4.6.19.1.9.  Towers, vertical obstructions and no-fly or restricted zones or airspace. 
4.6.19.2.  Each military demonstration team may include additional requirements for 
items to depict on the diagram. 
4.7.  The Airshow Waiver (Continental United States events only)  .  A waiver to Federal 
Aviation Administration regulations is required to conduct aerial demonstrations and non-
standard operations at open houses.  The waiver is requested using a FAA Form 7711-2, 
available on the Federal Aviation Administration website (http://www.faa.gov/library/forms/).  
See paragraph  4.7.1., Figure 4.2., and Figure 4.2. for examples of how to fill out the form for 
an open house.  The application is due 90 days prior to the event, but 120 days is recommended.  
See FAA Advisory Circular 91-45C and FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6 for assistance.  
Also, the local Federal Aviation Administration Flight Standards District Office may assist in the 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
43 
preparation of FAA Form 7711-2; however, the preparation and submission of FAA Form 7711-
2, as well as all of the necessary supporting documentation, are the responsibility of the open 
house staff.  The Federal Aviation Administration responds with FAA Form 7711-1 and the 
special provisions for the event.  Carefully review the FAA Form 7711-1 to ensure it grants the 
appropriate waivers and that compliance is not an issue.  The air operations officer or the air boss 
ensures the performers have read and understand the special provisions.

4.7.1.  Completing the Application for Certificate of Waiver Authorization.  
4.7.1.1.  Block 1, 2 and 3:    Name, organization and contact for the open house director. 
4.7.1.2.  Block 4 and 5:  Enter “N/A” in these blocks.  Pertains to Banner Towers only. 
4.7.1.3.  Block 6 (Federal Acquisition Regulation  section and number to be waived):  
List all applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation sections and numbers.  The local Flight 
Standard District Office can assist with identifying items that should be listed. 
4.7.1.4.  Block 7 (Detailed description of proposed operations):  State what type of 
performances will be taking place, e.g., “Annual airshow featuring non-aerobatic high 
and low speed flyovers, USAF demonstration teams, parachuting.”  Include a listing of 
all supplemental information attached to the application 
4.7.1.5.  Block 8:  Define the area and altitude of the flight maneuvering airspace, e.g., 
“Five mile radius from LAT/LONG (ABC AFB), surface to 15,000 MSL.” 
4.7.1.5.1.  Include a current, properly marked depiction of the planned area of 
operation with the application.  The site layout depiction demonstrates that the 
airshow acts can be accomplished within the area of operation identified (military 
demonstration teams require 15,000 feet above ground level).  If an airshow 
demonstration or act cannot fit within Federal Aviation Administration distance 
criteria, or if congestion or new development around the proposed site impedes those 
criteria, the site is not appropriate for that demonstration or act.  Site depictions 
should include as much of the information from paragraph  4.6.19. as known at the 
time of submission, with a final version submitted at a later date. 
4.7.1.6.  Block 9 (inclusive event dates/times):  Be sure to include any potential 
alternate dates.  Additionally, be sure to include any rehearsal dates -- i.e. the Friday date 
for a Saturday/Sunday show, if a dry run of the show is scheduled. 
4.7.1.7.  Block 
10:  The 
initial 
application 
does 
not 
need 
to 
list 
specific 
performers/aircraft.  The application may be accepted with a notation in block 8 that “A 
complete list of pilots and parachutists will be provided by …” and specify a date (ensure 
to comply with the deadline once established).  A notation stating the show line CAT 
should be annotated with each make and model aircraft.  Once the list has been supplied, 
the list may be amended by the responsible person and resubmitted to the Federal 
Aviation Administration inspector-in-charge for approval.  Performers added on the day 
of the event provide proof of appropriate qualifications and aircraft is airworthiness, and 
a determination is then made that the performance can be conducted at that show site. 
4.7.1.8.  Block 11 and 12 (Sponsor information):    May be listed as the installation, or 
an air show organization council (if applicable).  For example, “Wings over Hampton 
Roads” in block 11 versus “Langley Air Force Base/1 Fighter Wing” in block 1. 
4.7.1.9.  Block 13 (Policing):   List organizations responsible for providing security 
during the event/security precautions planned for the event.  For example, “Base Security 
Forces will police the event, the local sheriff’s department has traffic responsibility, 
volunteers will conduct bag searches, crowd barriers will be employed and a public 
address system is available for emergency announcements.” 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
47 
4.7.1.10.  Block 14 (Emergency facilities):    Detail emergency facilities and assets 
available, including any provided by off base organizations (i.e., if the local hospital will 
be providing ambulance services, rather than a base agency, still check the “Ambulance” 
box). 
4.7.1.11.  Block 15 (Air Traffic control):  Detail air traffic control measures e.g., who 
has control of airspace; primary and alternate methods of communication with air traffic 
control/terminal radar approach control facilities, tower and center Notice to Airmen; 
temporary flight restrictions, control frequencies, points of contact, etc. 
4.7.1.12.  Block 16 (Schedule of Events):  The initial application does not need to 
include a schedule of events, but if it doesn’t, a note indicating when a final schedule of 
events will be provided is added to this block. 
4.7.1.12.1.  The final schedule should identify the aircraft and expected performers in 
an approximate sequence of appearance.  This may change the day of the event 
because of weather, mechanical problems, or other factors at the discretion of the air 
boss. 
4.7.1.12.2.  Any demonstrations/acts added to the schedule once approved require 
notification to the Federal Aviation Administration and should be submitted at the 
earliest opportunity.  Cancellations do not require advance notice, unless it has a 
significant impact on the event.  For example, the headlining demonstration team 
would require notification, as would the cancellation of the entire event.

Chapter 5 
FORCE SUPPORT SQUADRON 
5.1.  Open Houses.   Open houses are community relations programs designed to educate the 
public about the mission of the Air Force and the base.  Generating revenue is not the primary 
objective of conducting such events.  Force Support Squadron morale, welfare, and recreation 
elements, while not required to do so, may use non-appropriated fund support to provide 
recreational events / activities, and entertainment held in conjunction with the open house.  
However, installation commanders need to ensure the use of non-appropriated funds does not 
negatively affect long-term support for morale, welfare, and recreation programs.  Units refer 
and adhere to the provisions outlined in AFI 34-101.  Force Support Squadron may sponsor 
recreational events and activities held in conjunction with the open house, and may provide full 
or partial non-appropriated fund support for activities like: 
5.1.1.  Non-flying entertainment such as musical bands, fireworks, children’s break areas.  
Consider the appropriateness of non-flying entertainment which may cause the open house to 
take on the character of a commercial event, carnival or fair. Under no circumstances, should 
fireworks be sold or distributed to members to the public. 
5.1.2.  Civilian aerial demonstrations are adjunct to military activities.  Delegation authority 
was provided to SecAF requiring at a minimum SES or GO (HAF/A1S) approval authority to 
expend commercial sponsorship of morale, welfare, and recreation events at open houses in 
accordance with DoDI 1015.10.  Commercial sponsorship of civilian demonstrations may be 
solicited under the same conditions as other commercial sponsorship and may only be funded 
by commercial sponsorships or provided as a gift in-kind. See paragraph  6.4 for funding 
guidance. 
5.1.3.  Bleachers or chairs in support of Force Support Squadron morale, welfare, and 
recreation booths, displays, events, or entertainment performances.  See paragraph 1.1.6. and 
paragraph  5.3. for concessionaire guidance. 
5.1.4.  Public address systems for the Force Support Squadron morale, welfare, and 
recreation elements of the event. 
5.1.5.  Open house reception open to the entire base population. 
5.1.6.  Family area or kid  ’s zone.  Mechanical rides intended for adults such as large roller 
coasters and Ferris wheels, along with games of chance or skill, are prohibited.  Kid zone 
activities are provided or contracted for by the Force Support Squadron non-appropriated 
fund Contracting and should be solely for the use of children.  Activities can include 
attractions such as inflatable jumping castles, small mechanical rides like carousels and small 
trains, face painting, rock climbing walls, etc.  Only the Force Support Squadron may 
contract for these activities / attractions and charge a fee. 
5.1.7.  Inclement weather or rain insurance for the Force Support Squadron morale, welfare, 
and recreation elements of the event.  Refer to AFI 34-208, Nonappropriated Fund Property 
and Liability Program. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
49 
5.1.8.  Food, beverage, souvenir and other concessions, operated directly by Force Support 
Squadron or by concessionaire contract.  Refer to AFI 34-219, Alcoholic Beverage Program, 
for information regarding serving of alcoholic beverages. 
5.1.9.  Payments (including profit-sharing arrangements) to unit unofficial activities (e.g., 
social funds, booster clubs) or installation-recognized Private Organizations for operating 
Force Support Squadron morale, welfare, and recreation concession booths (when included 
in a services or concessionaire contract). 
5.1.10.  Marketing and publicity for Force Support Squadron morale, welfare, and recreation 
programs or events. 
5.1.11.  Souvenir programs for direct sale by Force Support Squadron morale, welfare, and 
recreation activities. 
5.2.  Restrictions.    Force Support Squadron cannot subsidize mission-related elements of the 
open house or provide non-appropriated funds or commercial sponsorship support for elements 
not related to Force Support Squadron morale, welfare, and recreation involvement.  Do not 
provide funds, or allow funds generated from open houses, to be used for: 
5.2.1.  Socials, receptions, seating, or tents for exclusive use by certain groups or individuals 
except as allowed in paragraph  1.13., paragraph  5.3., and paragraph  6.11. 
5.2.2.  Transportation or lodging for military members, individuals not connected with Force 
Support Squadron morale, welfare, and recreation related events, or event attendees. 
5.2.3.  Any cost for which appropriated funds are authorized.  Installations may request 
waiver of this restriction per paragraph  2.9.1.1. 
5.2.4.  Insurance for appropriated funds-funded aerial or other demonstrations. 
5.2.5.  Essential elements of the open house that would exist regardless of Force Support 
Squadron morale, welfare, and recreation participation.  Such elements include basic health, 
sanitation, safety, security, and comfort of the attendees. 
5.3.  Concessionaire Contracts.  
5.3.1.  Force Support Squadrons may enter into one or more concessionaire contracts.  Force 
Support Squadron morale, welfare, and recreation non-appropriated fund concessionaire 
contracts adhere to the provisions of Air Force Non-Appropriated Fund Contracting 
requirements in accordance with AFMAN 64-302, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) 
Contracting Procedures.  Only warranted contracting officers are authorized to negotiate 
with vendors.  Non-appropriated fund concessionaire contracts are competed to the 
maximum extent practical.  Sole source contracts are not allowed unless fully justified in 
writing and approved by the local Staff Judge Advocate and contracting officer.  Proceeds 
from concession contracts go to the non-appropriated fund to support morale, welfare, and 
recreation elements and cannot be converted or diverted to support essential elements to the 
open house.  Installations should consider including in the statement of work a requirement 
for a low-priced meal for children e.g., a sandwich, chips and drink or other discounted meal 
options.  The only mechanism for a private organization to become a concessionaire on a 
military installation is through a non-appropriated fund concessions contract. 
50 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
5.3.2.  When entering into exclusive contracts (i.e., only a single awardee will sell food and / 
or souvenirs), consider including exceptions to allow sale of specific memorabilia near static 
displays and to allow for food provided to performers, volunteers, within the commander’s 
tent or within tents provided as a concession. 
5.3.3.  In addition to products such as food and merchandise, Force Support Squadron may 
use concessionaires to provide chairs, bleachers or tents (see paragraph  1.13.6.). 
5.3.4.  Consider using an existing umbrella contract (i.e., Master Concessionaire) for all 
Force Support Squadron concessions. 
5.3.5.  Automated teller machines are not Force Support Squadron concessions, and are 
obtained pursuant to the rules in DoD 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, 
Vol. 5, Ch. 34. 
5.4.  Souvenir Programs.  Souvenir programs may be produced and sold by Force Support 
Squadron or through a concessionaire contract provided: 
5.4.1.  Appropriated funds are not used for their publication or distribution. 
5.4.2.  The “No Federal endorsement of advertisers/sponsors is intended or implied” 
disclaimer accompanies recognition of advertisers or commercial sponsors. 
5.4.3.  If there is a requirement in the previously negotiated civilian enterprise base 
newspaper contract to print such programs produced by Force Support Squadron or a 
concessionaire contract, then programs cannot be sold.  Note: A program printed by a 
newspaper contractor may be different in form and quality from a souvenir program 
contemplated by a concessionaire.  Installations (Staff Judge Advocate, public affairs and 
Contracting) can determine whether a concessionaire program will in fact conflict with a 
contractual requirement for a newspaper contractor. 
5.5.  Civilian Enterprise.  Commercial sponsorship involves accepting money, goods, or 
services from commercial sponsors in support of an event, in exchange for sponsor recognition 
and advertising privileges.  Commercial sponsorship recognition should be greater than other 
donors.  Commercial sponsorship may be used to pay for only the morale, welfare, and 
recreation elements of an open house.  For example, Force Support Squadron could obtain 
commercial sponsors for a concert or civilian air act in conjunction with an open house.  See AFI 
34-108 for detailed guidance on commercial sponsorship.  Delegation authority was provided to 
SecAF requiring at a minimum SES or GO (HAF/A1S) approval authority to expend commercial 
sponsorship of morale, welfare, and recreation events at open houses in accordance with DoDI 
1015.10. 
5.5.1.  Banks as Commercial Sponsors.  Banks may be commercial sponsors and may 
receive commercial sponsor sign and display benefits.  However, DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 5, 
Ch. 34, 340404, prohibits off-base financial institutions from distributing competitive 
literature or forms on the installation. DoDI 1015.10 limits promotions by off-base financial 
institutions to product lines and services not offered by the applicable on-base bank or credit 
union. 
 
 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
51 
5.5.2.  Agency and Commercial Sponsorship.  A commercial entity may authorize another 
entity to act as its agent in arranging for commercial sponsorship via a power of attorney or 
agency agreement authorizing the agent to negotiate for and commit support to the morale, 
welfare, and recreation elements of the event.  An agency agreement does not prevent Force 
Support Squadron personnel from contacting a potential sponsor directly.  Installations 
services and legal offices should verify the legitimacy of any purported agency agreement, 
and/or terms of specific agreements to ensure the Air Force non-appropriated fund 
instrumentality receives the promised funds, goods or services in exchange for the agreed 
recognition and advertising.  The Force Support Squadron should advertise the event 
sponsorship opportunity locally to ensure all businesses have an equal opportunity to become 
sponsors. 
5.5.3.  Develop a commercial sponsorship plan for the Open House as required by DODI 
1015.10, Enc 2, para 4(g), (see para  2.8.1) using templates provided by Air Force Services 
Activity (AFSVA).  Consider whether commercial sponsorship of events at open houses will 
reduce the level of commercial sponsorship available for other morale, welfare, and 
recreation activities at the installation.  Survey other bases and local events to determine fair 
market value of sponsorship for similar benefits at similar events. Installations are 
responsible for addressing these considerations in any commercial sponsorship proposal.  
Forward the plan through the Air Force Services Activity, Installation Support division (SVI) 
in order to request AF/A1S approval. 
5.5.4.  To limit the financial risks of contracting for an element such as a civilian aerial 
demonstration intended to be paid for with commercial sponsorship, consider arranging for 
the sponsor to contract directly for the element and offer it as an in-kind commercial 
sponsorship.  Appropriate signage may indicate that such aerial acts are provided by a non-
Federal sponsor.

Chapter 6 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
6.1.  General Funding Guidance.  Appropriated funds are available to finance various aspects 
of open houses.  Appropriated funds are authorized for those portions of an open house that exist 
to inform the public about the capabilities, equipment, training and professionalism of the Air 
Force and its people.  While some aspects of an open house are entertaining, the primary purpose 
of the event is not entertainment.  The Force Support Squadron can sponsor, with full or partial 
non-appropriated fund support, recreational events and activities (e.g. food and entertainment) 
held in conjunction with the open house. PEC XX530F-MWR appropriated funds may be used to 
fun MWR requirements as authorized in AFI 65-106 specific to MWR open house requirements. 
Do not use PEC XX530F-MWR to fund non-MWR open house requirements. 
6.2.  Military Aerial Demonstration Teams.  The expenses incurred by installations supporting 
all military crews flying DoD-owned aircraft taking part in aerial demonstration at an open house 
are financed with appropriated funds (operations and maintenance (O&M) funds).  Typical 
expenses include lodging, meals, transportation, pyrotechnics used in the demonstrations and 
other requirements as established in the Thunderbirds, Blue Angels, ACC single-ship 
demonstration team and USAF Heritage Flight support manuals.  The term “meals” does not 
include snacks, refreshments and bottled water consumed during the event.  These are considered 
a personal expense (covered by pay, allowances and per diem) and may not be purchased with 
appropriated funds. 
6.3.  Funding Vintage Military Aircraft (Warbirds) Performances or Displays  .  Warbird 
crews and their aircraft, which belong to non-Federal entities or individuals and which are 
contracted to perform at open house events, may be financed with appropriated funds (O&M 
funds).  Because of their military significance, warbirds may be funded with appropriated funds 
to effect the public affairs and community relations purpose of an open house.  The expenses 
would be those normally associated with a non-personal service contract.  Typical expenses that 
may be funded are lodging, meals, transportation (at the open house location), and any 
explosives events/pyrotechnics used in the demonstration.  Snacks, refreshments and bottled 
water may be provided if required by the contract.  Fuel (aviation gas [AVGAS]/JP-8/Jet A) for 
the flight to and from the open house location, rehearsals and actual performances may be 
provided at Government expense pursuant to the appropriated funds contract.  In lieu of a direct 
monetary conditional gift to the Air Force, a non-Federal entity or individual may sponsor a 
warbird’s appearance at the open house.  The non-Federal entity or individual contracts directly 
with the warbird owner/operator and then donates the performance to the Air Force as a form of 
sponsorship. Use of commercial sponsorship for vintage military aircraft aerial performance or 
display requires HAF/A1S approval (see paragraph  5.5.). Appropriate signage may indicate that 
such aerial acts are provided by a non-Federal sponsor. 
6.4.  Funding Civilian Aerial Performance or Display (Non-warbird).  Appropriated funds 
are not authorized to fund any costs incurred by crews or the aircraft of civilian aerial 
performance individuals or teams.  All costs, including lodging, meals, transportation, may be 
funded with non-Federal / private funds either donated or provided through the non-appropriated 
fund commercial sponsorship program for civilian aerial demonstrations at the open house 
involved.  Use of commercial sponsorship for civilian aerial performance or display requires 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
53 
HAF/A1S approval (see paragraph  5.5.).  Appropriate signage may indicate that such aerial acts 
are provided by a non-Federal sponsor.  In the case of conditional donations to the Air Force to 
fund such aerial acts, process in accordance with AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds 
and accepted by the proper approval authority based on the value of the donation.  Pursuant to a 
non-appropriated fund contract, the Government may provide fuel for the flight to and from the 
open house location, rehearsals and actual performances.  Absent a Government contract, the 
installation may authorize defense working capital fund fuel cash sales for aircraft, vehicles, and 
equipment that are on display and/or perform at an open house pursuant to Defense Logistics 
Agency Energy policy guidance.  Vehicles and equipment other than those actually on display or 
directly involved in the open house performance may not purchase defense working capital fund 
fuel. 
6.5.  Ground Displays.  Ground displays (including military aircraft and equipment, civilian 
aircraft, and other displays) may be permitted in accordance with paragraph  1.6.  Military 
aircraft and other military equipment ground static and mobile displays and warbirds are funded 
with appropriated funds.  Civilian aircraft and other non-military ground displays may be funded 
through non-appropriated funds derived through commercial sponsorship of that particular event, 
or given as gifts to the Air Force.  Displays, other than aircraft or military equipment, may be 
funded through appropriated funds, non-appropriated fund commercial sponsorship program or 
non-Federal sources, depending on the purpose of and authority for the particular display. 
6.6.  Facilities and Accommodations.  Essential elements of expense for open house facilities 
and accommodations are those expenses that would be incurred if there were no Force Support 
Squadron morale, welfare, and recreation participation.  Essential accommodations and facilities 
such as sanitation (trash containers, refuse collection, portable restrooms), health, safety, security 
(phones, radios), power outlets, professional public address systems and announcer, and general 
comfort of the public are funded with appropriated funds only.  Additional sanitation 
requirements necessitated by the sale of concessions may be paid for with non-appropriated 
funds.  Other elements of general expense may be funded by appropriated funds, non-
appropriated funds, or private funds depending on the part of the open house being supported -- 
tents/booths (see paragraph  1.13.), tables/chairs, bleachers, golf carts, portable rest rooms, 
generators, lighting, stage, public address system (other than the main system required for 
general safety and security).  See Attachment 4, Funding Source Guide matrix. 
6.7.  Crowd Control, Security, and Health/Safety.  Expenses incurred to ensure security, 
provide first aid, and facilitate safe movement and control the crowds attending the event are 
funded with appropriated funds.  Typical expenses are for air-to-ground radios, first aid 
materials, lost and found, fences, ropes/stanchions, transportation, barriers, parking/parking 
passes and shuttles (no cost to public), and signs and badges. 
6.8.  Publicity.  Air Force open houses receive extensive local news coverage via print, radio, 
social media platforms, and television throughout the United States.  It is often one of the 
premier attractions in the region and may be well publicized by the Chamber of Commerce in 
many areas.  Consequently, the use of Government-funded advertising, upon review by and 
approval from public affairs, requires substantial justification for using appropriated funds before 
it could be considered a necessary expense.  Evaluate carefully before committing appropriated 
funds to advertising.  Public service announcements (PSAs) should be used to the maximum 
extent before resorting to paid advertising.  Paid advertising may be donated or simply provided 
at the donor’s expense.  Do not incorporate the name of a non-Federal entity into the name of an 
54 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
open house.  Non-appropriated funds may be used for advertising morale, welfare, and recreation 
programs and events.  Installation public affairs offices should monitor non-Air Force 
advertising of open houses for accuracy. 
6.8.1.  Programs.  The installation should provide a free schedule of the day’s events, readily 
available to attendees; costs are funded with appropriated funds.  In addition, the Force 
Support Squadron may develop a souvenir program, to be sold or distributed, that covers all 
elements of the open house (see paragraph  5.4.).  This may be done directly or through a 
concessionaire contract.  It may include commercial sponsor and advertising recognition for 
those who directly or indirectly (contributor recognition is limited to purchased advertising) 
provide funds, goods or services in support of the open house.  Determine whether the base 
newspaper contractor has the rights to such publications and the nature of the program 
contemplated by the newspaper contractor.  If the base newspaper has the rights to a free 
open house program as part of the base newspaper contract and plans to produce a souvenir 
program, the Force Support Squadron may produce a souvenir program for sale only with the 
contractor’s consent (see AFI 34-108, Commercial Sponsorship and Sale of Advertising). 
6.9.  Entertainment.  Events which are intended solely as entertainment are funded either by 
non-appropriated funds or gifts of private funds.  Typical entertainment, which is incidental to 
the primary purpose of the event, may be fireworks, concerts, and / or kids’ play area. 
6.10.  Concessions.  The sale of food, beverages (including alcoholic beverages) and souvenirs 
or other amenities such as chairs or shaded viewing areas is restricted to the Force Support 
Squadron.  Procurement is with non-appropriated funds, including non-appropriated funds 
resulting from commercial sponsorship, and the receipts are accounted for in the non-
appropriated fund system.  Any Non-Federal entities providing static displays, including 
warbirds, may accept donations, but they may only sell souvenirs (that do not compete with Base 
Exchange items) pursuant to a Force Support Squadron concessions contract.  Likewise, 
installation-recognized Private Organizations may set up information booths, but the sale of 
souvenirs should be pursuant to a Force Support Squadron concessions contract.  Only the Force 
Support Squadron or authorized concessionaires may sell commercial products and services.  
The display, promotion, or advertisement of commercial products and services is reviewed by 
base legal and approved by the installation commander. 
6.11.  Commander’s Hospitality Tent.  A commander’s hospitality tent, as well as civic and 
social events occurring at the time of the open house, are considered protocol activities and may 
be supported by Official Representation Funds if they comply with AFI 65-603.  Admission to 
the commander’s hospitality tent as a “reward” to attract or encourage sponsorship or donations 
is prohibited.  The commander’s hospitality tent is not to be sponsored and there are to be no 
sponsor or supporter signs in the area (in accordance with paragraph  1.13.5. and paragraph  
1.13.6.).  Concessionaires may not provide a commander’s hospitality tent (or similar 
appropriated funds related support) in conjunction with receiving a non-appropriated fund 
contract. Donors of conditional gifts (including in-kind gifts) used in support of the 
Commander’s Hospitality Tent will only receive recognition, common to all other donors, per 
paragraphs  1.8.1. and  11.3.3.  While the installation commander and other dignitaries are 
permitted to visit with commercial sponsor representatives, a visit cannot be guaranteed and 
included as a “benefit” in the commercial sponsorship agreement.

Chapter 7 
LEGAL GUIDANCE 
7.1.  Introduction.  This chapter highlights some common legal issues that may arise during 
open houses.  Due to the unique circumstances in planning and conducting an Air Force open 
house, legal coordinators should be involved at all stages of the process.  The information 
presented is not all-inclusive and should not be considered a substitute for proper legal oversight 
by a Judge Advocate staff member. 
7.2.  Command authority during an Open House.  
7.2.1.  Installation commanders have inherent authority to restrict political and dissident 
activity on a military base (DoDD 1325.6, Guidelines for Handling Dissident and Protest 
Activities Among Members of Armed Forces); Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828 (1976); 
OpJAGAF 1993/21, 3 Mar 93).  Holding an open house does not change this fundamental 
concept.  Thus, the notices and warnings posted at an installation’s gates about restrictions on 
conduct, which are applicable to those who enter a Federal installation, apply even when the 
public as a whole is invited onto the premises.  If attendees are bussed onto the installation, 
consider placing similar signs at the point of embarkation to ensure proper notice. 
7.2.2.  Military bases are generally not public forums.  Therefore, commanders should 
prohibit demonstrations inside an installation that could result in interference with or 
prevention of orderly accomplishment of the mission of the installation, or present a clear 
danger to loyalty, discipline, or morale of military forces (see DoDI 1325.6 and AFI 51-903, 
Dissident and Protest Activities, paragraph 6).  If a demonstration or unauthorized activity 
begins to take place during an open house, commanders and Security Forces should be ready 
to respond immediately. 
7.2.3.  Base open houses do not turn a base into a public forum for purposes of First 
Amendment rights.  See “Persons for Free Speech at SAC v. United States Air Force, 675 
F2d 1010 (8th Cir 1982), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1092 (1982)”; see also “Shopco Distribution 
Co. v. Commanding General, Camp Lejeune, 885 F2d 167 (4th Cir 1989).”  However, 
portions of a base which are generally open to the public may be public forums for First 
Amendment purposes.  See “U.S. v. Gourley, 502 F2d 785 (10th Cir 1974).”  The key is 
whether the Air Force ordinarily exercises control over the area.  If non-DoD personnel are 
normally restricted from freely accessing the property in question, an open house does not 
change the commander’s inherent authority limit demonstrations and control civilian 
activities in that area. 
7.2.4.  Installation officials should anticipate that demonstrations, dissident activities, 
political speeches, and other unauthorized or disruptive behavior may occur during the open 
house.  Security Forces should refer to AFMAN 31-201, Vol 4, High Risk Response, for 
further instructions.  Both the legal coordinator and Security Forces coordinator should 
develop an operations plan to respond to and control persons who seek to disrupt the event, 
damage government property, or harm event participants.  Planning involves coordination 
with local law enforcement personnel, as well as with the appropriate United States Attorney 
and district attorney’s office, or foreign equivalent if overseas.

7.3.  Standards of Conduct Considerations.  
7.3.1.  The Office of Government Ethics establishes uniform standards of conduct (ethics) 
rules for the entire Executive Branch of the Federal Government.  The ethics rules are the 
minimum standards of ethical conduct within the U.S. Government and serve as the starting 
point for ethical conduct. 
7.3.2.  DoD 5500.07-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER)  , is the DoD’s regulation on 
standards of conduct.  It incorporates the Office of Government Ethics rules into DoD policy 
and supplements them with rules unique to DoD personnel. 
7.3.2.1.  The Joint Ethics Regulation addresses individual ethical conduct; that is, what 
employees may and may not do as they carry out their official (and sometimes personal) 
activities.  It regulates conduct concerning personal gifts, conflicts of interest, use of 
government resources, use of one’s government position, and other work-related 
activities. 
7.3.2.2.  For agency conduct, all of the DoD and Air Force publications listed in 
Attachment 1 impact Air Force activities in holding an open house.  The publications 
that deal most directly with community relations are DoDD 5410.18, DoDI 5410.19, and 
AFI 35-105. 
7.3.2.3.  It is important to follow agency regulations closely because violations could 
trigger punitive measures.  For example, misusing public office and / or official 
resources, giving preferential treatment, violating fiscal law principles, or not addressing 
conflicts of interest could lead to disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice for military members and personnel regulations for civilian employees. 
7.3.2.4.  The legal coordinator should be involved in all stages of event planning, from 
the first meeting to the after-action report.  Some fiscal and Joint Ethics Regulation issues 
are counterintuitive and often can only be spotted and evaluated with the help of a trained 
attorney. 
7.3.3.  10 USC § 2783(b)  provides that violations of policy for the management and use of 
non-appropriated funds (including those derived from commercial sponsorship) carry the 
same penalties as similar transgressions involving the misuse of appropriated funds.  
Violations by personnel subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice are punishable under 
the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
7.4.  Key Ethics Considerations.  
7.4.1.  Endorsement.  DoD personnel may not officially endorse, or appear to endorse, any 
non-Federal entity, event, product, service or enterprise. 
7.4.2.1.  The term “non-Federal entity” includes: charities; non-profit organizations; 
installation-recognized Private Organizations; professional associations; commercial 
endeavors; foreign governments; contractors; and non-government individuals. 
7.4.2.2.  To “endorse” means to promote or convey the impression of Federal approval of 
a non-Federal entity’s mission, personnel, products or services.  This means personnel 
cannot use their official office, title or position to suggest Air Force support of a private 
entity.  Personnel are also prohibited from personally endorsing any non-Federal entity if 
their actions are connected to their official position in any way. 
58 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
7.4.3.  Preferential Treatment.   DoD personnel shall act impartially and not give 
preferential treatment to any non-Federal entity or individual (T-0). 
7.4.3.1.  Thus, according to the Joint Ethics Regulation, when official support is provided 
to one non-Federal entity, the approving official should be able and willing to provide 
support to comparable non-Federal entities.  If similar support cannot be granted to all 
comparable entities, or an official is unwilling to support a particular comparable entity, 
the most prudent course of action in most cases is to refrain from supporting any entity. 
7.4.3.2.  Many organizations seek affiliation with the Air Force, particularly in 
conjunction with open houses.  It can be difficult to determine whether an individual’s or 
a non-Federal entity’s goals are altruistic, personal or commercial.  Therefore, Air Force 
officials should seek guidance from their staff judge advocate prior to entering into any 
relationship or agreement with, or providing any support to, any non-Federal entity. 
7.4.4.  “Quid Pro Quo” Arrangements.  The term “quid pro quo” means literally 
“something for something,” or the giving of one valuable thing for another valuable thing.  
Except for duly appointed Contracting Officers, AF personnel do not have legal authority to 
bind the Government to any financial obligation. 
7.4.4.1.  While there are certain exceptions to this rule (e.g. the Force Support Squadron 
morale, welfare, and recreation commercial sponsorship program), avoid any 
arrangement that appears to be a quid pro quo arrangement without the advice of a judge 
advocate or contracting officer. 
7.4.4.2.  Be extremely careful not to commit the Air Force to an obligation with an 
outside organization without legal and contracting advice and clear authority to do so. 
7.4.5.  Fundraising.  Private Organizations may only engage in fundraising pursuant to AFI 
34-223 and AFI 36-3101.  When deciding whether to approve a Private Organization 
fundraiser, the installation should consider the fundraising proposal’s relation to the overall 
open house and the impact on non-appropriated fund sales or concessions. While Private 
Organizations may apply for a concessionaire’s license to sell goods at an Air Force Open 
House (and may make a profit from such activities), an Open House should not be viewed as 
a fundraising-intensive event by the installations’ Private Organizations. The installation 
commander may decide that souvenir sales by a Private Organization at an Open House do 
not count against an organization’s limit on occasional fundraising per AFI 34-223. 
7.4.5.1.  Conflicts of Interest.  Air Force employees are prohibited by criminal laws 
from participating personally and substantially in any official matter that may impact 
their financial interests or the financial interests of someone with whom they have a 
covered relationship (such as a close family member, potential employer, or private 
organizations).  Even the appearance of a conflict of interest should be avoided. 
7.4.5.1.1.  Air Force employees should also remain impartial or recuse themselves in 
dealing with official issues that involve a private organization with which they are 
associated in a personal capacity.  Employees are generally prohibited from engaging 
in any official activities in which a private organization is a party or has a financial 
interest if the employee is an active participant in the private organization or has been 
an officer within the last year. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
59 
7.4.5.1.1.1.  The term “active participant” includes service as an official of the 
organization, such as a committee chairperson or organization spokesman.  It also 
includes significant time devoted to promoting specific programs, including 
fundraising efforts.  Thus, an Air Force official who takes an active role in a base-
affiliated private organization cannot make a decision in an official capacity that 
will directly affect the private organization’s financial status.  Acting in both 
capacities (official and personal) violates the conflict of interest rules. 
7.5.  Gifts to the Air Force.  
7.5.1.  10 USC § 2601 authorizes the SECAF to accept and use gifts of personal or real 
property to carry out the Air Force mission.  Gifts may be conditional (with restrictions) or 
unconditional (no restrictions).  The Secretary has delegated the authority to accept gifts to 
designated subordinate officers, down to and including installation commanders. 
7.5.2.  AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force  , establishes the procedures for 
receiving, processing and accepting gifts.  Although most gifts are processed under this 
guidance, other instructions govern different types of gifts.  Limits on the use of appropriated 
funds do not normally limit Air Force authority to accept gifts pursuant to AFI 51-601. 
7.5.2.1.  For gifts offered directly to the specific non-appropriated fund instrumentality, 
rather than the Air Force, see AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs). 
7.5.2.2.  For gifts to religious funds, see AFI 52-101, Planning and Organizing. 
7.5.2.3.  For gifts from foreign governments to individuals, see AFI 51-901, Gifts From 
Foreign Governments. 
7.5.2.4.  For gifts to individuals, see 5 CFR 2635 Subpart B. 
7.5.2.5.  For gifts of travel benefits, see 31 USC § 1353; 41 CFR Part 304-1, Payment of 
Travel Expenses From a Non-Federal Source – Authority. 
7.5.3.  Ordinarily, officials may accept gifts offered to the Air Force unless acceptance would 
not be in the best interest of the Air Force.  The authority to accept a gift depends upon the 
value of the gift.  As a rule of thumb, gifts valued over $50,000 may only be accepted at the 
Secretarial level.  A gift of tangible or intangible personal property of $50,000 or less, that 
does not require more than negligible expenditure for its acceptance and maintenance, may 
be promptly accepted or rejected by a commander at the MAJCOM and field operating 
agencies level.  These commanders may re-delegate their authority to subordinate 
commanders, but not lower than installation commanders.  Notwithstanding any such re-
delegation, commanders of Air Force installations may accept or reject gifts of personal 
property with a value of $5,000 or less.  AFI 51-601 provides detailed guidance for personal 
property gifts and other types of gifts that might be offered to the Air Force.  Where a single 
non-Federal entity gifts multiple items toward an open house, the value of all gifts is 
aggregated when determining the acceptance authority.  In other words if three gifts each 
valued at $20,000 are given by a non-Federal entity, they are to be forwarded for acceptance 
at the Secretarial level. 
7.5.4.  In order to protect both the Air Force and the donor, process all gifts (regardless of 
value) in accordance with AFI 51-601 (or AFI 34-201 for gifts to an AF non-appropriated 
fund instrumentality).  Staff the gift acceptance package according to those instructions 
60 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
(depending on the type and value of the gift) and send a written acceptance or rejection letter 
to the donor.  Where gift acceptance requires staffing to a higher authority, ensure ample 
time is allowed for processing and avoid as much as possible the need for last-minute 
approvals.  Installation legal staffs should be kept up to date on anticipated gifts so that they 
can in turn advise higher-level gift acceptance authorities so that potential issues are 
identified and addressed well in advance. 
7.5.5.  Soliciting Gifts.  DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 12, Ch. 30, 300502 directs that DoD personnel 
shall not solicit, fundraise for, or otherwise request or encourage the offer of a gift to DoD 
and that acceptance authorities shall not accept gifts offered contrary to this policy.  
However, once an offer has been initiated by a non-Federal entity, AF personnel may follow 
up with specific guidance and information, to include installation needs (T-0). 
7.6.  Voluntary and Gratuitous Services.  Voluntary services are accepted by the installation 
commander or designee on behalf of the Air Force, where authorized by law (see 31 USC 1342).  
The Air Force may accept gratuitous services pursuant to an advance written agreement whereby 
the service provider waives all claim for compensation from the government.  A volunteer may 
not be used to fill a vacant, paid civilian position.  OpJAGAF 1991/6, 1986/62. DoDI 1100.21, 
Voluntary Services in the Department of Defense, provides additional guidance for voluntary 
services accepted pursuant to 10 USC § 1588.  While that statute is not the exclusive authority 
for accepting gratuitous services (see OpJAGAF 1987/7), it provides Federal Employees 
Compensation Act and tort liability coverage for volunteers providing services listed in 10 USC 
§ 1588(a).  Some services at an open house may fall into the statutory category of “services to 
members of the armed forces and the families of such members.”  Volunteer services to benefit 
the installation’s MWR Program is one such category.  The DoDI directs use of DD Form 2793, 
Volunteer Agreement for Appropriated Activities or Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities.  
Airman and Family Readiness Centers generally manage volunteers for Air Force units (see AFI 
36-3009, Airman and Family Readiness Centers, paragraph 3.6.). 
7.7.  Relationship 
between 
Gifts 
of 
Services 
and 
Contracts/Commercial 
Sponsorships.  Since the Air Force has no general statutory authority to accept gifts of services, 
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2601(a), many such instances where a non-Federal entity assumes the 
responsibility for payment of specified aspects of the open house are considered, from a legal 
standpoint, to be commercial sponsorships (for MWR elements of the event) or limited types of 
co-sponsorship (for appropriated fund elements).  These latter co-sponsorships must be 
memorialized in an agreement between the parties that establishes mutual roles, responsibilities 
and liabilities.  Depending on the circumstances, such an agreement could be characterized as a 
Community Sponsorship Agreement (pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2679 when offered by a State or 
local government), an Air Force Outgrant (lease or license) (pursuant to AFI 32-9003, Granting 
Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property) when those non-Federal aspects of the air show can 
be collectively located in discernible areas of the installation, or at a minimum, in a 
Memorandum of Agreement Upon the Acceptance of a Gift to the Air Force.  Regardless of the 
specific title of this agreement, appropriate signage should put the public on notice that a non-Air 
Force entity is responsible for the selection and vetting of specified proffered vendors, products 
and services (T-0). 
 
 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
61 
7.8.  Overseas Considerations.  For overseas events careful consideration is to be given to host 
nation laws and regulations that impact open house activities.  Of special concern are tax 
considerations that may restrict sales of items imported tax free for use of the United States 
forces.  As the legal issues vary from country to country, a careful study of individual national 
agreements and requirements is necessary. 
7.9.  Indemnification, Liability and Insurance.  
7.9.1.  Under an indemnification agreement, one party promises, in effect, to cover another 
party’s losses or liability.  Contracts or other agreements for indemnification without limit 
may not be entered into, due to their violating the Antideficiency Act., 31 USC § 1341. 
7.9.2.  Private organizations, contractors and other non-Federal entities are not entitled to 
sovereign immunity defense by the Department of Justice or similar legal protections 
accorded to the Air Force or to non-appropriated fund instrumentalities. 
7.9.3.  The Air Force requires that any civil air performer landing at or taking off from an 
installation airfield provides a hold harmless agreement (DD Form 2402) and a certificate of 
insurance (DD Form 2400) prior to issuing a landing permit (see AFI 10-1001).

AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
Chapter 8 
CONTRACTING 
8.1.  General.  Identification of purchase requirements early in the planning for the open house 
is critical to success.  Assign an experienced contracting officer to the open house staff to 
provide business advice, help with the development of requirements, and ensure compliance with 
acquisition regulations and laws. 
8.2.  Local Purchase Support for Open Houses.  
8.2.1.  Local purchase requests (e.g., staff support, performers, etc.) for open house 
requirements should be coordinated with Contracting and Finance as early in the planning 
process as possible.  It is the responsibility of the Contracting Officer / coordinator to make 
sure all Federal Acquisition Regulations, including all supplements and applicable laws, are 
followed to ensure adequate competition, fair and reasonable pricing, small business 
requirements, etc.  Only Contracting Officers have the authority to enter into contracts on 
behalf of the Government.  The open house director and his staff may not book vendors / 
demonstrators without consulting with the Contracting Officer / coordinator assigned to their 
team.  Improperly entering into an agreement or contract could result in an unauthorized 
commitment and may result in disciplinary action. 
8.2.2.  Vendors / performers should not be paid in advance of services performed, although a 
reasonable deposit may be made to contract performers (refer to FAR 32.2).  The performer 
may have the right to a settlement if an open house is cancelled and a contract to perform is 
terminated. 
8.2.2.1.  The open house director and staff should consult with FM and the Force Support 
Squadron on which requirements should be procured with appropriated funds and which 
with non-appropriated funds, see the Funding Source Guide at Attachment 4.  All 
purchases made with the government purchase card will comply with AFI 64-117, Air 
Force Government-Wide Purchase Card Program and AFI 34-275, Nonappropriated 
Fund Government Purchase Card Program.  Consult with the base government purchase 
card program manager for advice on proper use of the government purchase card (T-1). 
8.2.3.  Both appropriated funds and non-appropriated funds contracts may include 
Government consideration other than money payments; in-kind consideration may result in a 
lower overall cost to the Government.  Examples include arranging for food, fuel, use of on-
base lodging, or use of Government space or equipment.  Such consideration does not need 
to be directly related to the goods or services being provided to the Government.  If 
alternative forms of consideration are used in non-appropriated fund contracts, the contract 
should stipulate that there is a dollar value associated with the exchange.  State the amount in 
the payment terms of the contract and the Contracting Officer determines if the consideration 
is fair and reasonable and documents the file accordingly. 
8.2.3.1.  Use of Government property (including both real property and personal property 
such as a tent) in appropriated funds contracts is covered by FAR Part 45 (non-
appropriated fund contracts are not governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation).  
The contracting officer’s determination concerning the factors in paragraph  8.2.3.2. 
should consider whether providing Government property is the only way to meet 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
63 
Government requirements within the limits of available funding.  Planners should consult 
with JA and FM representatives to ensure compliance with applicable contracting, ethics, 
and fiscal laws and regulations when acquiring goods or services with in-kind contractual 
consideration. 
8.2.3.2.  FAR 45.102(b) allows contracting officers to provide property to contractors 
only when it is clearly demonstrated:  (1) To be in the Government’s best interest; (2) 
That the overall benefit to the acquisition significantly outweighs the increased cost of 
administration, including ultimate property disposal; (3) That providing the property does 
not substantially increase the Government’s assumption of risk; and (4) That Government 
requirements cannot otherwise be met. 
8.2.3.3.  For example, in a non-appropriated fund contract, Government consideration for 
a civilian aerial demonstration could include a reserved tent space for the contractor and 
an exception from an otherwise exclusive food concession to allow the contractor to 
bring catered food into the tent space (see paragraph  1.13.8.).  Any contractor signage in 
tent space is for internal viewing and not visible to the general public.  Display of 
products or services are prohibited. 
8.2.4.  Because a variety of unique aerial demonstrations, ground displays and Force Support 
Squadron entertainment events could be appropriate for an open house, consider making a 
public solicitation via a Request for Proposal to identify a variety of choices. 
8.3.  Base Service/Support Contracts  .  Additional service/support requirements for an open 
house (e.g., transient alert) should be coordinated well in advance of the event with contracting 
and the functional owner of the service (e.g., Maintenance Group).  These requirements may 
require contract modification and additional funding depending on the nature of the requirement 
and structure / scope of the contract. 
8.4.  Key Fiscal Considerations.  
8.4.1.  Congress regulates virtually all Executive Branch programs and activities through the 
Appropriations process.  Congress has enacted fiscal controls, which, if violated, subject the 
offender to serious adverse personnel actions and criminal penalties.  This means all Air 
Force officials should be conscious of funding issues throughout the planning and execution 
stages of open houses. 
8.4.2.  The Antideficiency Act (31 USC § 1341, 1342, and 1517) prohibits any Government 
officer or employee from: 
8.4.2.1.  Making or authorizing an expenditure or obligation in excess of the amount 
available in an appropriation. 
8.4.2.2.  Making or authorizing expenditures or incurring obligations in excess of formal 
subdivisions of funds, or amounts permitted by regulations. 
8.4.2.3.  Incurring an obligation in advance of an appropriation, unless authorized. 
8.4.2.4.  Accepting voluntary services except as specified (see paragraph  7.6.).

AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
Chapter 9 
SAFETY 
9.1.  Introduction.   Safety is a prime consideration at all times during all phases of open house 
planning and execution.  The base safety staff should continually coordinate with the open house 
staff during the planning and execution of the open house to ensure all safety criteria and 
concerns are met and addressed.  The safety staff, alone, cannot identify every safety concern or 
ensure all guidelines are followed.  Risk management facilitators from every functional area help 
identify any hazards, and assist in mitigating unnecessary risks via a risk management 
assessment (see AFPD 90-8, and AFI 90-802, Risk Management). Planners will use the 
deliberative 5-step risk assessment model and document the results for Installation Commander 
approval.  Ensure the open house director and safety staff are notified of any unresolved safety 
issues/questions as well as all mishaps that involve injuries or property damage before, during, 
and after the open house.  Every functional area should assist in compiling the after action‖ report 
to identify lessons learned and any safety concerns. 
9.2.  References.  There are many regulations and publications that address safety considerations 
during open houses.  Table 9.1 provides a general listing of regulations/publications that address 
safety related procedures or safety concerns at open houses.  All applicable regulations should be 
reviewed to ensure the appropriate safety precautions and stipulations are followed.  The 
guidance contained in the listed regulations is not a replacement for common sense; the guidance 
dictates that certain steps or procedures are followed, but it cannot encompass every eventuality.  
Activities or procedures not addressed by published guidance should be reviewed with safety in 
mind, and appropriate caution and sound judgment should be exercised.  See Attachment 2, 
section A2, Planning, Air Show General Safety Requirements, for additional considerations (i.e. 
no helium balloons, small unmanned aerial systems (UAS), etc.). 
9.3.  General Responsibilities for all Involved Agencies.  
9.3.1.  Assist the open house director in managing risks  .  Risk management is the 
effective use of available resources (i.e., time, manpower, and funding) to prioritize and 
complete actions required to reduce risk.  Four principles govern all actions associated with 
the management of risk.  These principles, continuously employed, are applicable before, 
during, and after all tasks and operations. 
9.3.1.1.  Accept no unnecessary risk.  Unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate 
return in terms of real benefits or available opportunities.  All Air Force missions and 
daily routines involve risk.  The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are 
those that meet all mission requirements while exposing personnel and resources to the 
lowest acceptable risk. 
9.3.1.2.  Make risk decisions at the appropriate level.  Making risk decisions at the 
appropriate level establishes clear accountability.  Those accountable for the success or 
failure of the mission should be included in the risk decision process. The Installation 
Commander is the risk acceptance authority for open house events. 
 
 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
65 
9.3.1.3.  Integrate risk management into operations and planning at all levels of the 
open house.  To effectively apply risk management, dedicate time and resources to 
integrate risk management principles into planning and operational processes.  Risk 
assessments of operations are mission supportive when they are done as a normal way of 
conducting a mission, not an add-on process performed by people not otherwise involved.  
To support these principles, the open house director should apply risk management 
during all aspects of preparation (planning, organizing, training, equipping, and 
sustaining) and employment of open house resources. 
9.3.1.4.  Apply the process cyclically and continuously.  RM is a continuous process 
applied across the full spectrum of military training and operations, base operations 
functions, and day-to-day activities and events both on- and off-duty. It is a cyclic 
process that is used to continuously identify and assess hazards, develop and implement 
controls, evaluate outcomes and provide feedback to our Airmen to save lives and 
preserve combat resources. 
9.4.  Occupational Safety Responsibilities.  Occupational Safety coordinates with all functional 
areas during the planning and execution phases of the open house.  Particular coordination is 
required with the following agencies emphasizing the stated areas: 
9.4.1.  Traffic Engineer.  Normally responsible for on and off-base traffic plans, visitor-
parking plan, open house worker parking, crowd control, pedestrian routes, emergency 
vehicle parking and routes, vehicle and golf cart use on aircraft ramp and open house area. 
9.4.1.1.  Ensure planned re-supply routes for vendors are designed to minimize vehicle 
movement through crowds.  Traffic and parking plans should be created in conjunction 
with Security Forces and the installation antiterrorism officer. 
9.4.1.2.  Prohibit hazards such as bicycles, skates, non-service animals, rollerblades, and 
skateboards in the spectator area. 
9.4.2.  Contracting. 
9.4.2.1.  Incorporate applicable safety requirements into work statement in open house 
contracts as well as analogous language in other controlling agreements such as Air Force 
Outgrants, Community Sponsorship Agreements and Memorandum of Agreement 
between the Air Force and tendering non-Federal entities in the case of proffered in-kind 
contracts, in coordination with the base Safety office. 
9.4.2.2.  Incorporate applicable federal, state and local safety requirements, laws, 
regulations, as well as any base requirements into work statements in contracts, in 
coordination with the requiring activity and the base Safety office. 
9.4.2.3.  Incorporate applicable local, state, etc., regulations and ordinances and existing 
sanitation standards into work statements in contract, in consultation with the base Civil 
Engineers.. 
9.4.2.4.  Incorporate federal, state, or host nation inspection requirements into work 
statements in contracts for mechanical rides for kid zones in consultation with the Force 
Support Squadron and the base Safety office. 
 
 
66 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
9.4.3.  Force Support Squadron, non-Federal entities, and private organizations. 
9.4.3.1.  Ensure all booth workers are trained for booth operation, including fire, safety 
and health issues.  Ensure that booths are properly equipped and staffed.  Coordinate on 
the plan for booth location and required equipment.  Ensure cooking booths are located 
away from any aircraft or fuel source per AFIs and Air Force Occupational Safety and 
Health (AFOSH) Standards.  Properly secure both booths and tents to prevent damage 
from high winds, or from damaging nearby aircraft or structures should they become free. 
9.4.3.2.  Bleacher seating should comply with US Consumer Product Safety Commission 
Publication #330, Guidelines for Retrofitting Bleachers, current Uniform Building Codes 
(chapter 4, Section 1008), local laws, and National Fire Protection Agency Life Codes. 
9.4.3.3.  Minimize tent lines / anchors intrusions into the public walkway.  When anchors 
(spikes) intrude into the walkway, anchors and lines should be properly identified/marked 
to alert personnel of their presence. 
9.4.3.4.  If tasked to provide mechanical rides in a kid zone, ensure adequate fall zones 
are provided and that equipment has been properly inspected. 
9.4.3.5.  Pre-mix soft drink dispensing systems that contain a pressurized carbon-dioxide 
(CO2) gas cylinder are prohibited.  Post-mix systems (Bag “N” Box) with CO2 gas 
cylinders are authorized for use. 
9.4.3.6.  Ensure adequate public access to toilets for the size of the estimated number of 
visitors to the open house. 
9.4.4.  Fire Department.  The installation fire chief ensures proper type and location of 
firefighting equipment, emergency response vehicles and routes, fire extinguishers and fire 
safety requirements. 
9.4.4.1.  Preposition emergency vehicles at designated locations prior to flight operations.  
Ensure these locations are not “trapped” behind crowd control lines. 
9.4.4.2.  Provide a fire extinguisher to all booths that require one, and inspect any booths 
that are provided with electrical power. 
9.4.4.3.  Ensure all cooking fuel sources meet safety requirements, designated smoking 
areas are identified and that no smoking or open flames or sparks are allowed near any 
aircraft or fuel source. 
9.4.4.4.  Coordinate 
with 
all 
performers/contractors 
planning 
any 
explosives 
events/pyrotechnic displays and ensure all applicable safety, transportation, storage, and 
employment requirements are met. 
9.4.5.  Bioenvironmental Engineering.  Assist the Open House Director and staff in 
ensuring occupational and environmental requirements are met. 
9.4.5.1.  Adequacy of potable drinking water for the public and for open house workers 
must be considered.  (Water vulnerability assessment is covered in paragraph  3.1.11.)  
Assess risk of heat stress to open house personnel and recommend work/rest and 
hydration requirements as appropriate.

and trained in accordance with the Tri-Service Food Code and AFI 48-116, Food Safety 
Program. 
9.4.7.  Ground Operations Officer.  Safety of all operations and events is of utmost 
importance. 
9.4.7.1.  If public has access to aircraft hangars, remove all equipment such as 
maintenance stands, aerospace ground equipment, and coordinate with base fire chief to 
ensure hangar fire suppression systems are made safe.  Lock and tag out hangar door 
controls as necessary. 
9.4.7.2.  Ensure static display aircraft comply with Technical Order (T.O.) 00-80G-1, 
Make Safe Procedures for Public Static Display, AFI 11-209, Attachment 3, and the 
appropriate aircraft AFI 11-2 series or equipment technical order. 
9.4.7.3.  Identify and coordinate the display/parking plan for aircraft, equipment, and 
vendor areas. 
9.4.7.4.  Ensure all command and local guidance on static displays is implemented.  
Ensure open house planning addresses the need to provide shelter to attendees in the 
event of adverse weather (e.g., lightning within 5 miles), per AFI 91-203. 
9.4.7.5.  Ensure safe plan for re-supply of vendor areas and safe movement of vehicles in 
the open house area.

AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
9.4.9.  Medical.  Adequate medical stations should be set up and manned as necessary to 
handle disaster response and worker and public illness and injuries.  Ensure necessary 
emergency medical transportation is available as needed including ground and air transport.  
Report all injuries to the open house director and the safety staff. 
9.4.10.  Vehicles Operations.   Ensure adequate vehicles are assigned and bus routes are 
identified.  Ensure operators are properly licensed and trained.  Limit or prohibit vehicles in 
crowd areas and along pedestrian routes.  Arrange for safe vehicle refueling or electrical 
recharging.  Seat belts are to be worn at all times if available.  Vehicle occupants may not 
ride in areas of a vehicle without fixed seats.  Commanders may approve personnel to be 
transported in vehicles without fixed seats for duty operations only after completion of a risk 
assessment in accordance with AFI 90-802 and complying with the requirements outlined in 
AFI 91-207, The US Air Force Traffic Safety Program. Transport is limited to military 
installations and for short distances only, provided all installed seat belts are in use.  During 
transport, each passenger is to remain seated wholly within the body of the vehicle.  The 
vehicle cargo area may not have open sides and no person may rest against a gate that opens.  
Only military, civilian employees, approved civilian contractors, and non-appropriated fund 
employees are allowed to operate low speed vehicles e.g., golf carts, during the open house. 
9.4.11.  Fuels.  Ensure proper fuel is available for open house aircraft.  When outside fuels 
are brought on base to support open house aircraft, take steps to ensure fuels are not 
dispensed to the wrong aircraft or commingled.  Ensure purchased AVGAS meets quality 
requirements in accordance with T.O. 42B1-1-22, Quality Control of Aviation Gasoline.  If 
an R-11 or drums are used as the storage / issue point, follow conversion/flushing guidance, 
sampling requirements for different type of receipts, and use limits are met in accordance 
with T.O. 42B-1-1.  Fueling is not allowed in the static display area when the public is 
present (within 100 feet).  Guidance in AFI 91-203, Chapter 36, must be followed.  Ensure 
routes for refueling vehicles are identified (T-1). 
9.4.12.  Engineering.  National Electric Code or host nation electrical requirements should 
be identified for required electrical power in the open house area and booths.  Ensure 
electrical cables are approved for outdoors use and do not present a tripping hazard.  All 
circuit breakers should be closed and secured to prevent unauthorized access. 
9.4.13.  Weather.   Atmospheric and environmental conditions should be addressed for safe 
air and ground operations as well as personnel safety.  Take into consideration factors such 
as: severe weather, heat stress, lightning, and winds. 
9.4.14.  Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).  EOD is responsible for rendering safe 
aircraft explosive hazards, military munitions and terrorist use of improvised explosive 
devices (IED).  Coordinate EOD requirements with air / ground operations officers and 
emergency response coordinators.  Air Force standards should be met when employing 
support; however, EOD capability is comparable regardless of branch of service.  Incorporate 
EOD requirements into response planning and integration into the antiterrorism working 
group is recommended.  Two major response areas to consider are aircraft mishaps and force 
protection requirements.  The number of teams required is based on force protection and risk 
assessments however two teams are recommended to minimize movement through crowds, 
and meet response requirements.  Pre-position emergency response vehicles at designated 
locations prior to flight operations.  Do not multi-task response teams and equipment for 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
69 
demonstrations or static displays.  If explosives events / pyrotechnic displays are conducted 
by any performers, closely coordinate with the performer / contractor and the Weapons 
Safety office to ensure all applicable explosive safety requirements are met. 
9.4.14.1.  Ensure EOD coordinates with Weapons Safety on all explosives 
events/pyrotechnic displays. 
9.4.14.1.1.  If a civilian company is used for the demonstration, EOD teams 
familiarize themselves with the explosives used by the demonstration team the day 
the explosives arrive on the installation.  In the event of an accident / incident, the 
contractor is responsible for commercial explosives they provided and are responsible 
for making every possible effort to remedy the situation. 
9.4.14.1.2.  If the contractor cannot return the area to a safe condition, the EOD team 
provides emergency assistance/response to render safe, handle and / or transport for 
disposal commercial explosives in order to save lives and / or preserve high value 
military resources.  Report property damage and Government response costs to 
Contracting and Legal so that they may assess contractor responsibility for the 
damage or costs. 
9.5.  Flight Safety Responsibilities 
9.5.1.  Much of the existing guidance addressing aerial demonstrations, flyovers, etc. is 
aimed at establishing a safe flying environment for the aircrews, the spectators, and the 
surrounding community.  Ensure the air operations officer and air boss are familiar with 
applicable safety publications.  Regardless of how their services were procured or funded, 
ensure the planned open house activities comply with applicable safety publications.  Most of 
these publications are listed in Table 9.1. The base flight safety office closely coordinates 
with the air operations officer and air boss to help resolve any flight safety issues/challenges 
raised during open house planning/execution.  Each flying day, the air operations officer, air 
boss, announcer, tower chief, wing chief of safety and fire chief should attend the crew 
briefing and review the accident/incident plan. 
9.5.2.  The flight safety office is responsible for the careful review of the local bird 
conditions approaching an open house.  Coordinate with the bird aircraft strike hazard team 
to determine requirements, techniques, and time-frames for abatement based on the open 
house planned activities. 
9.5.3.  Recommended Precautionary Measures.  
9.5.3.1.  Installations should plan and execute a major accident exercise based on an air 
show scenario prior to the installation’s open house.  This may be a tabletop or field 
exercise.  Work with the exercise evaluation team chief in the development of this 
scenario.  This exercise should include any off-base emergency response forces that will 
be participating in the open house. 
9.5.3.1.1.  National Incident Management System.  The inclusion of all response 
personnel from military and civilian agencies will provide a unity of effort in the 
event of an actual incident as outlined in the Department of Homeland Security 
National Incident Management System.  Preparedness requires a unified approach to 
emergency management and incident response activities.  To achieve this, 
70 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
components of National Incident Management System will be integrated within a 
jurisdiction’s or organization’s emergency management and incident response 
structure.  Specifically, preparedness should be integrated into communications and 
information management, resource management, and command and management to 
form an effective system.  Additionally, the unified-approach concept is at the core of 
the Command and Management component, as it is based on chain of command, 
unity of command, unity of effort, and when implemented, Unified Command (T-0). 
9.5.3.2.  Identify the interim safety board members and their planned operating location 
prior to the open house.  They should be on call, preferably on base, during any 
scheduled aerial demonstrations or flyover to facilitate a quick response.  Interim safety 
board members should have distinguishing individual and vehicle badges to allow SF to 
authorize 
their 
movement 
to 
the 
designated 
assembly 
area 
following 
a 
mishap/emergency. 
9.5.4.  Airfield Operations/Manager.  Coordination is required with Airfield Operations 
Flight commander and airfield manager. 
9.5.4.1.  Ensure all activities, structures, etc. conducted or located within the runway 
lateral clearances, clear zones, taxiway and apron criteria and accident potential zones are 
in compliance with airfield design criteria or applicable temporary waivers are approved 
by the installation commander.  These zones may affect planned activities within 3,000 
feet of the runway centerline.  Ensure coordination with the airfield manager for planned 
use of all land around and near the runways.  Planned explosives events / pyrotechnic 
displays are examples of one activity that may be affected by these zones. 
9.5.4.2.  Coordinate a thorough airfield inspection after the open house and ensure all 
foreign object debris, equipment, and temporary facilities are cleared from the airfield 
and it is in compliance with applicable directives covering normal airfield 
criteria/operations. 
9.6.  Weapons Safety Responsibilities. 
9.6.1.  Commanders perform an explosives risk assessment in accordance with AFMAN 91-
201, Explosives Safety Standards, which includes documenting operational risk acceptance 
procedures as identified in AFI 90-802 for all open house operational hazards, including 
explosives safety. 
9.6.2.  Coordinate the requirements of DoD 6055.09-M, DoD Ammunition and Explosives 
Safety Standards, and AFMAN 91-201, with command and base-level safety offices for all 
open house events to ensure that weapons and explosives hazards are properly addressed to 
reduce the risk of injury or property damage to civilian and/or military resources.  Contractor 
supported explosives operations are required to be approved in accordance with these 
regulations. 
9.6.3.  Common areas of review during the commander’s risk assessment include compliance 
with AFMAN 91-201 for the use of explosives associated with static and public displays, 
fireworks displays, aerial demonstrations, etc.  Table 9.1. provides some references for these 
common areas of explosives concerns but should not be used in lieu of the reading of the 
proper regulations. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
71 
9.7.  Explosives Events/Pyrotechnical Displays During Open Houses.  If intentional 
detonations or pyrotechnic events are conducted during the open house, the overriding emphasis 
should be on the safety of all personnel, facilities, or equipment within the area surrounding the 
potential explosion site.  Maintain a minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet or an explosives 
clear zone in accordance with AFMAN 91-201, whichever is greater, from the potential 
explosion site to spectators (the crowd line), the surrounding community, and aircraft or 
personnel who use the airfield after each explosives event is over.  Compliance with AFMAN 
91-201 and National Fire Protection Agency standards is required.  When contradictory guidance 
exists the explosives safety standards in AFMAN 91-201 take precedence.  Ensure explosive 
events used to support military aerial demonstrations is supervised by Air Force personnel.  For 
additional pyrotechnical guidance, including Airborne Demonstrations, reference FAA Order 
8900.1. 
9.7.1.  Risk.  The desire for a crowd-pleasing show should not lead to the acceptance of 
undue risk.  Limit the use of high explosives and pyrotechnics to the minimum required to 
achieve the desired effect, both in number and size of detonations.  The open house safety 
staff should assess the risks inherent to each explosives event and ensure appropriate risk 
management measures are discussed with / implemented by the demonstrator / contractor.  
Primers that address explosive safety in more detail may be used in conjunction with 
AFMAN 91-201, e.g. Pyrotechnics and Special Effects for Air Shows, a publication of the 
International Council of Air Shows. Safety staff should comply with AFMAN 91-201 in 
cases where other publications are less stringent. 
9.7.2.  Considerations.  There are numerous safety considerations that should be considered 
in the planning, employment, and execution of a pyrotechnic demonstration.  The following 
is not an all-encompassing list of potential risks, but merely serves to highlight some areas 
for increased awareness and closer scrutiny: 
9.7.2.1.  Grass fires (pre, during, and post release). 
9.7.2.2.  Unplanned / premature detonation during transportation, set-up, operation, and 
teardown. 
9.7.2.3.  Unauthorized personnel straying into the pyrotechnic area. 
9.7.2.4.  Fragments from detonator pieces, nearby rocks, sticks, wooden stakes etc. 
causing injury / damage to spectators, aircraft, or staff. 
9.7.2.5.  Air blast / pressure wave damage to structures, aircraft, or personnel. 
9.7.2.6.  Foreign object debris to runways/taxiways following the demonstration. 
9.7.2.7.  Exceeding authorized capacity of available storage facilities. 
9.7.3.  Grass Fire Hazard Mitigation vs. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard 
Mitigation.  There is significant potential for an unplanned grass fire when explosives events 
/ pyrotechnics displays are used in conjunction with open house demonstrations.  Several 
methods of mitigation are discussed below.  Ultimately there is no one-size-fits-all solution 
to the pyrotechnic display fire hazard, and all effects (both immediate and delayed) should be 
considered in selecting the appropriate mitigation option(s).  Whatever method(s) are used to 
mitigate the fire hazard, have fire department personnel present during setup to allow for 
72 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
familiarization and standing by at a safe distance near any pyrotechnic demonstration to 
quickly respond to any resulting fire. 
9.7.3.1.  Mowing.  The standard height for grass on airfields is 7-14 inches.  The purpose 
of this standard is to minimize the threat to aircraft from birds and other wildlife.  The 
greatest fire threat during an explosives expenditure is from any dried thatch left over 
from previous mowing.  Plan the mowing schedule for the pyrotechnics area to provide a 
well-maintained length and to limit the accumulation of dried thatch prior to the open 
house.  Local vegetation and environmental conditions dictate the best mowing schedule.  
In every case, any dried thatch should be removed from the pyrotechnic area(s) prior to 
the open house. 
9.7.3.2.  Pre-Burning, 
Pre-Soaking, 
and 
Bird 
Aircraft 
Strike 
Hazard  Considerations.  Many purveyors of pyrotechnic displays advocate pre-burning 
the area to prevent grass fires in the aftermath of the display; however, this decision 
cannot be made in a void.  Any portion of the airfield that is burned, either in preparation 
for, or following the expenditure of the pyrotechnics will serve to attract birds and 
negatively affect the airfield’s bird aircraft strike hazard efforts.  The larger the burned 
area, the greater the negative effect. 
9.7.3.2.1.  From a bird aircraft strike hazard perspective, pre-soaking would be 
preferable to pre-burning, provided it is not over-done resulting in standing water, as 
this would also attract birds.  Field conditions, access in / around the pyrotechnic 
area, as well as contractor access requirements prior to the pyrotechnic expenditure 
may render this option impractical.  Early planning and coordination with affected 
parties is key. 
9.7.3.2.2.  Pre-burning the pyrotechnic area is a viable option in many cases, but 
should only be pursued after careful consideration.  All pre-burning will adversely 
affect the bird aircraft strike hazard threat at the airfield.  The bird hazard greatly 
increases for at least 2 weeks following a burn.  Plan the burn so that the increased 
bird aircraft strike hazard threat will diminish prior to the open house.  Timing of 
prescribed burns is critical to the vegetative cover. 
9.7.3.2.2.1.  Burning during dry seasons can lead to long term damage, thereby 
increasing bird hazards for several successive years.  Burning too early in the year 
when the grass has just gone dormant will leave bare and exposed soil for 
extended periods of time.  Dormancy can begin as early as late summer in some 
locations.  All locations, vegetation, and climates vary, so be sure to consider all 
implications before implementing a pre-burn plan. 
9.7.3.2.2.2.  Coordinate with local agricultural agencies and the base civil 
engineering office on the timing and effective methods for a controlled burn.  The 
base fire chief  approves any decision to burn be consistent with applicable state 
or local government open burn restriction in effect at the time and state open burn 
laws.  Additionally, local laws/regulations may require the procurement of a burn 
permit. 
 
 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
73 
9.7.3.2.3.  If pre-burning is to be pursued, work with the contractor / demonstrator to 
limit the affected area to the smallest area practical.  Being conservative in the size, 
intensity, and footprint of the pyrotechnic display can limit the size of the affected 
area and the intensity of the resultant bird attraction. 
9.8.  Mishaps and Events.  Report and investigate every mishap/event in accordance with AFI 
91-204, Safety Investigations and Hazard Reporting, and the AFMAN 91-22X series.  The 
commander may need to conduct a separate investigation if there may be resulting liability or 
litigation issues.  See AFI 51-503, Aerospace and Ground Accident Investigations.

Chapter 10 
FORCE PROTECTION 
10.1.  Overview.   Installation commanders use the contents of this chapter as a guide for 
planning force protection prior to and during events.  The safety of Air Force personnel and the 
protection of Air Force aircraft and other resources is paramount.  Force protection measures 
should always be taken into consideration, whether participating in flyovers, aerial 
demonstrations, aerial reviews, or conducting static displays.  It is imperative all Air Force 
members at all levels consider the situation and potential threat to Air Force personnel, aircraft, 
and resources when deciding to participate in or host any military or civilian event.  Refer to AFI 
31-101, Integrated Defense (ID), DoDI O-2000.16, Volume 1, AFI 10-245-O Supplement, 
Antiterrorism (AT) Program Implementation, and current installation plans (AT, Integrated 
Defense Plan [IDP], IEMP 10-2 & Medical Contingency Response Plan [MCRP]) for force 
protection considerations prior to planning a base open house. 
10.2.  Force Protection Planning.  The plan should follow current Air Force planning guidance 
and have all necessary annexes.  Proper planning gives the installation commander an accurate 
picture of equipment and personnel requirements to offset vulnerabilities.  Use MAJCOM staffs 
and any other available Air Force assets as necessary to assist in planning.  As a minimum, the 
plan should be for official use only (FOUO) or classified if appropriate.  If multiple day events 
are held, take measures to ensure security plans are not compromised and adequate resources are 
available to support the event. 
10.3.  Assessments.  The installation Defense Force Commander leads a targeted vulnerability 
assessment team prior to an open house.  Planners should refer to vulnerabilities already 
identified in the Enterprise Protection Risk Management Program (EPRM) as the baseline for 
conducting this assessment.  In addition to the Core Vulnerability Assessment Management 
Program, ensure planners continue to evaluate current threat information.  Searches for 
vulnerabilities should be conducted inside and outside the installation.  Use all assets available to 
conduct assessments on and off base to identify vulnerabilities.  Bioenvironmental Engineering 
and Public Health should be consulted to conduct vulnerabilities of water and food sources 
respectively. 
10.3.1.  Intelligence Support to Anti-Terrorism and Force Protection.  Integrate and 
leverage base level intelligence personnel and capability to assess potential foreign based 
threats, terrorist tactics, techniques and procedures, and possible indications/warning of event 
targeting. Intelligence expertise, sources, and methods operating within Intelligence 
Oversight guidance should be appropriately integrated into planning. 
10.3.2.  Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI).  Use local AFOSI resources to 
address and obtain counter-surveillance and counter intelligence operations and information 
as necessary.  In addition, have AFOSI work with local State and Federal agencies to ensure 
counter intelligence and threat information is presented to the antiterrorism working group as 
an updated threat assessment.  Also, AFOSI may work with civil law enforcement agencies 
to provide support for events. 
 
 
76 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
10.3.3.  Civil Authorities.  Cooperation with civil authorities gives the installation a broader 
perspective of the community implications of conducting an open house, as well as providing 
additional resources to ensure a secure event.  The more vantage points used, the better the 
installation can identify vulnerabilities.  Use all assets available to assess on- and off-
installation topography (helicopter views or assessments if possible).  Consider use of off-
base patrols in conjunction with civil authorities to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities and 
cover the surface-to-air missile footprint.  Ensure legal coordinator is involved in 
jurisdictional issues and Posse Comitatus Act concerns.  If an installation has a waterway as a 
boundary, consider establishing an exclusionary zone.  Coordinate exclusionary zones with 
the United States Coast Guard or local marine authorities as necessary. 
10.4.  Integrated Defense.  Integrated defense doctrine and methodology, when properly 
applied, allows installation commanders and Security Forces to harness the entire base 
population and technology to see first, understand first, and act first.  Use the following 
integrated defense mission effect areas during the planning process. 
10.4.1.  Operations Security.  Operations security maximizes options.  Obviously publicity 
(open/close times, aircraft on display, etc.) is necessary, but don’t provide the operational 
plan to the public.  Only share the plan with personnel who have a need to know and provide 
only the amount of information necessary for each organization to perform its particular 
function. 
10.4.2.  Deter.  Make consequences clear and discourage potential threats.  Part of the public 
affairs marketing plan should include advertising planned security measures, such as search 
stations for hand carried items and restrictions of large bags, coolers, prohibited items, etc. to 
facilitate a smoother transition onto the installation.  Ensure all personnel working the event 
are in uniform; encourage military personnel attending the event to wear a uniform. NOTE: 
The wear of uniforms for some Security Forces personnel may detract from their assigned 
protection mission.  The installation’s Defense Force Commander may determine what 
Security Forces personnel will be in civilian attire. 
10.4.3.  Anticipate.  Anticipate what an adversary may do to disrupt operations or create 
mass casualties.  Plans for disruptions and mass casualties should be practiced and rehearsed.  
Antiterrorism Officers should assign specific random antiterrorism measures to all units 24 
hours prior to open house/air show to increase situational awareness and identify any 
shortfalls. 
10.4.4.  Deny.  Consider limiting or prohibiting large hand carried items such as coolers, 
backpacks, handbags to reduce the chance of introduction of unauthorized weapons, 
explosives, etc.  Deny access to off-limits portions of the installation using barriers and 
effective traffic management.  Enforce routing and parking of vehicles an adequate distance 
from critical installation resources and the event site (where spectators are massed) to 
provide adequate standoff distance in the event of the use of a vehicle borne improvised 
explosive device or a vehicle used as a kinetic weapon against a crowd.  This action is crucial 
to limiting mass casualties at the event site. 
 
 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
77 
10.4.5.  Detect.   See all potential threats first.  Purses, diaper bags, etc., will need to be 
brought into the event site area, so inspection stations at event areas are encouraged in order 
to detect any unauthorized items.  If magnetometers are available, use them at the inspection 
stations.  Non-government vehicles that are driven or parked in close proximity to public 
access area, to include delivery vehicles, are to be inspected before entry.  Consider walking 
explosive detection dogs through parking lots.  Ensure all critical facilities are manned with 
unit personnel in order to detect unauthorized access or suspicious activity. 
10.4.6.  Delay.   Layer security to prevent the use of space as a means of adversary attack.  
Distributing forces throughout the base increases detection, response, and continuity of 
forces needed to neutralize potential threats.  Consider the use of barriers or obstacles to 
channel crowds and provide delaying capabilities. 
10.4.7.  Assess.   Analyze the effect of layered defenses and the emergency response plans.  
This leverages intelligence and enables defending forces to influence an adversary’s 
decision-making and course of action cycles. 
10.4.8.  Deploy.  Pre-positioning of disaster response capabilities gives the installation 
instant response.  Maintain the capability to deploy with advantage to any incident.  Ensure 
the emergency operation center and emergency response forces are on base and able to 
deploy to any situation.  Installations with emergency services teams and close precision 
engagement teams should use these capabilities for high-risk incident responses.  If these 
teams are not available, coordinate with local authorities to use their special weapons and 
tactics teams under existing memorandum of agreements.  Consider posting Security Forces 
and close precision engagement teams on rooftops and other key observation points as 
observers.  Emergency services teams should be kept in reserve to rapidly respond to a 
hostile incident.  These teams should be staged close enough to the event site to decrease 
hostile contact closure rates when employment becomes necessary. 
10.4.9.  Neutralize.  Posted Security Forces, close precision engagement, emergency 
services teams, and/or special weapons and tactics teams (if formally trained and certified) 
should be in place and ready to neutralize any threat.  These specialized teams should be able 
to render the enemy ineffective if they should decide to strike during the event.  These forces 
should be capable of neutralizing hostile threats with lethal and nonlethal force, acting on 
criminal activities, and capable of controlling crowds. 
10.4.10.  Mitigate.  Have evacuation plans and notifications in place to allow spectators an 
escape route for any emergency.  Have emergency response (police, fire and medical) 
capabilities available for mass casualty response.  Monitor wind direction during the event 
and provide initial and updated reports as necessary to personnel who will respond to 
chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high yield energy attack or accident.  This 
minimizes the effect of adversary successes and takes the advantage away from those who 
wish to harm others. 
10.5.  Antiterrorism Working Group.   The antiterrorism working group is a multi-discipline 
group designed to work long-term force protection related problems and solutions and make 
timely recommendations to the installation commander on security matters.  The Installation 
Commander relies on the antiterrorism working group to ensure maintenance of a safe and secure 
environment.  Further, the antiterrorism working group should meet regularly and as close as 
possible to the start of an event to provide information and / or make recommendations to the 
78 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
installation commander concerning possible threats, adversary actions, and actions for integrated 
defense.  In addition, the antiterrorism working group is a critical part in security policy 
development prior to and during events. NOTE:  Ensure the air boss is brought into planning 
with the antiterrorism working group and provides names of open house participants for proper 
security screening. 
10.5.1.  Threat Working Group.  Continuous updates from AFOSI, base level intelligence 
personnel, local, state, and Federal law enforcement agencies are necessary for a successful 
event.  The Threat Working Group receives these updates and can provide the antiterrorism 
working group and installation commander with all intelligence data relevant to the 
installation and static display aircraft. 
10.5.2.  AFOSI.  AFOSI should work closely with all local, State, and Federal agencies to 
ensure a current threat assessment is presented to the Threat Working Group.  This action 
gives the installation continuous intelligence updates on the threat. 
10.5.3.  Base Level Intelligence.   Base level intelligence personnel operating within 
Intelligence Oversight guidelines have the capability to assess potential foreign based threats, 
terrorist tactics, techniques and procedures, and possible indications/warning of event 
targeting. Inclusion of installation intelligence personnel can add to the commander’s threat 
picture as a baseline and provide updates as available. 
10.6.  Manpower for Force Protection Requirements.  Ensure enough manpower is available 
to provide a safe and secure environment during the event. Installation commanders should 
consider the event day(s) a normal workday for all military personnel.  Installation personnel can 
be assigned to the integrated base security team and used as part of the force protection 
capability.  Installation commanders should consider activating Security Forces augmentation 
duty program personnel to provide an additional armed presence and enhance response 
capabilities.  The Defense Force Commander ensures personnel know what to look for and what 
the current threat picture is for the installation.  Augmentees should be briefed en mass on what 
to look for, how to report suspicious personnel and activities, and the current local and national 
threat, as appropriate. 
10.6.1.  Regular Air Force (RegAF) Military and Civilian Employees.    All RegAF 
military personnel and appropriately designated civilian employees should be considered part 
of the security and safety team.  These personnel should be directed to work in accordance 
with the installation commander’s directives.  Enough RegAF military personnel should be 
on duty to meet all manpower and contingency requirements.  Civilian employees may be 
used at the installation commander’s discretion (in accordance with applicable regulatory 
guidelines) and only after ensuring they are properly trained for proposed duties.  Premium 
pay (i.e. overtime, comp time, stand-by, and on-call payments) may be required to 
compensate civilian employees working beyond normal duty hours.  Ensure enough 
personnel are available and on-duty to conduct post and meal relief for the duration of the 
event. 
10.6.2.  Other Manning Sources.   Bring personnel assets and specialized support teams 
(explosive ordnance disposal, military working dog, etc.) in on a temporary duty assignment 
if necessary.  Consider manning assistance from sister services, tenant organizations, Air 
National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Civil Air Patrol, and civilian police, fire, and medical 
personnel.  For those installations providing aircraft for static display, coordinate with the 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
79 
respective home station Security Forces unit to provide personnel for aircraft security, if 
possible. 
10.7.  Installation Entry and Circulation Control Procedures.  During events, consider not 
opening the entire installation by creating sterile corridors and ingress/egress points, and ensure 
identification and proofing procedures are accomplished in accordance with AFMAN 31-113, 
Installation Perimeter Access Control (FOUO).  Maintain control of visitors and only allow 
them access to the areas of the installation intended for the event.  Restrict visitor access to 
designated event areas to preclude disruption to normal day-to-day base functions. Consider 
using ink stamps or colored wristbands to readily identify spectators and vendors who have been 
screened.  Channel visitors to secure areas for the event.  This requires base personnel at every 
possible roadway or trail to ensure event visitors stay within the channel area and do not deviate 
from the assigned travel routes.  Chase vehicles may be required at key locations throughout the 
installation.  Public Affairs should advertise all information about parking and entrance 
requirements. NOTE:  Be prepared for visitors and guests who show up early so as not to back-
up installation gates and roadways or allow an unauthorized vehicle access. 
10.7.1.  Parking.  
10.7.1.1.  Spectator Parking.  Base personnel should direct parking.  Vehicles should be 
channeled into the parking area(s) and parked sequentially.  This will ensure all spaces 
are used and allow for more vehicle parking capacity.  Additionally, the event plan 
should provide sufficient spaces for disabled parking and disabled transportation to and 
from the event site. 
10.7.1.1.1.  Consider using off-base parking areas or an isolated area away from the 
event site for visitors.  Off-base or isolated parking minimizes installation exposure to 
possible explosive devices.  If off-base parking is available, use buses to transport 
visitors from the parking area(s) to the event site.  Military personnel should be on 
each bus as a host and to conduct security checks prior to the visitors boarding the 
buses.  These hosts act as a first line of defense for spotting suspicious persons and 
can sound the alarm if necessary.  Ensure weapons (guns, knives, etc.) and (if 
prohibited), coolers, large handbags, backpacks, etc., are not taken to the event site.  
If magnetometers are available, use them to screen visitors prior to allowing them on 
the buses.  Allow spectators to place prohibited items not allowed at the event site in 
their vehicles.  Buses should run from the parking area to the event site continuously 
during the entire event for the convenience of visitors.  If possible, select a single gate 
on the installation for buses transporting visitors to and from the event. 
10.7.1.2.  Base Personnel Parking.  Parking areas on base should be available for 
military and civilian base personnel.  This precludes them having to drive off base for 
mass transit back onto the installation.  Military and civilian base personnel are required 
to follow the same guidelines as visitors and are not allowed to take prohibited items into 
the event site. 
10.7.1.3.  Performer Parking.  Arrangements should be made that allow performers 
unobstructed access to the show site.  Each performer should be given a specific vehicle 
pass and unique identification that will enable access to a designated performer parking 
area as well as their aircraft. 
80 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
10.7.1.4.  Commercial Sponsor Parking.    Authorized morale, welfare, and recreation 
commercial sponsors require access to the installation and event site to set up their 
display on the ramp.  Sponsors should be given a specific vehicle pass and unique 
identification that will enable access to a designated parking area.  See paragraph  10.7.4. 
for vendor security screening requirements. 
10.7.2.  Crowd Control.  AFOSI is a non-uniformed law enforcement agency that could be 
used to monitor the spectators, and report suspicious personnel or activities to Security 
Forces personnel.  In addition, the Defense Force Commander can place Security Forces 
investigators or other trained Security Forces in civilian attire to complement and augment 
this mission.  Although not normally a problem at such events, riot control requirements 
should be considered.  Post observers to monitor the crowd and key points.  Observers should 
utilize binoculars, cameras and recorders to detect and report suspicious personnel and 
activities to the Base Defense Operations Center using available communication systems.  
Consider establishing apprehension teams and detainment areas if apprehensions become 
necessary.  Ensure personnel performing these duties are properly equipped and available to 
respond when necessary. 
10.7.2.1.  Installation officials should anticipate that demonstrations, dissident activities, 
political speeches, and other unauthorized or disruptive behavior may occur during the 
event.  The legal coordinator and Security Forces should develop an operations plan to 
respond to and control persons who seek to disrupt the event, damage government 
property, or harm event participants.  Planning involves coordination with local law 
enforcement personnel, as well as with the appropriate United States Attorney and district 
attorney’s office, or foreign equivalent if overseas.  Any gathering (i.e. political and 
dissident activities, rallies, or other activities involving demonstrations or public 
activism), that are not permitted on the installation when it is closed to the public, should 
be similarly restricted during the open house.  Security Forces should refer to AFMAN 
31-201 Volume 4, for further instructions. 
10.7.2.2.  Security Forces should escort offenders to a pre-established holding area or 
turn them over to civil authorities and bar offenders from the installation.  As a minimum, 
establish a process with local law enforcement agencies to rapidly process offenders in 
accordance with jurisdiction agreements. 
10.7.3.  Traffic Control.  Traffic control sentries may be required at key base intersections 
and roadways leading into areas where visitors are not allowed access.  Ensure this is planned 
for prior to the event and that sentries are posted accordingly.  Consider utilizing military 
personnel other than Security Forces for this duty to allow for more effective use of Security 
Forces manpower. 
10.7.4.  Vendor Access.  Ensure all vendors are identified prior to allowing entry.  
Authorized vendors (e.g., food concessionaires) require access to the installation and event 
site to set up displays.  Ensure procedures are established for vendor screening, thus 
expediting entry to the installation and event site.  Vendor arrival times should be 
coordinated to ensure security personnel are available to conduct security checks and route 
vendor and commercial trucks to one central location for inspections. 
 
 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
81 
10.8.  Aircraft Security.  As soon as the number and type of aircraft that will be on static 
display is determined, identify security requirements for the aircraft attending.  Planners should 
consolidate like-protection level aircraft in one large restricted area until configured for static 
display just prior to the event.  Some aircraft will require armed Security Forces and temporary 
restricted areas.  Establish temporary restricted areas as required by the Protection Level 
designation of the aircraft in accordance with AFI 31-101.  Aircraft commanders are responsible 
for ensuring uniformed aircrew members are present at the aircraft to answer questions and assist 
with security during the event. 
10.9.  Dignitary Support.  Designate a separate area away from other spectators for dignitaries 
to view the event.  Use an entry control point to restrict access to the dignitary viewing area in 
order to detect unauthorized personnel.  Have escorts, evacuation plans, travel routes, and 
notification procedures in place to allow an escape route during emergencies.  A safe-haven 
should be established (on or off base as appropriate) for use if event evacuation becomes 
necessary.  Ensure the security and safety of dignitaries while traveling on the installation. 
NOTE: Protection of High Risk Personnel is the responsibility of AFOSI. 
10.10.  Emergency Response Exercises.  All emergency response actions should be planned 
and rehearsed prior to the event, in accordance with IEMP 10-2.  The rehearsal should be 
conducted during a mass casualty tabletop or field exercise.  Consider conducting this exercise in 
conjunction with local authorities. 
10.11.  Safety Emergency Response.  The Emergency Operation Center, Civil Engineer 
Readiness and Emergency Management, explosive ordnance disposal, Security Forces, medical, 
and fire department personnel should be on base and have a pre-determined rally point to 
respond to any emergency during the event. 
10.12.  Communications.  Communications in time of emergency are essential.  Proper 
communications can ensure a potential threat is neutralized prior to the threat affecting the event.  
Communications should be available and emergency response personnel should be linked to 
ensure proper command and control.  Security Forces, AFOSI, local civil authorities, and 
emergency response elements should be able to talk to each other directly or through a combined 
command communications center.  Communication systems should include all on- and off-base 
agencies supporting the event.  If common radio channels are not available, a communications 
center may be required so all response efforts can be coordinated.  Also, consider the use of cell 
phones if available.  Unsecured radio and cell phone/wireless transmissions can be easily 
monitored and exploited; therefore encrypting security channels to mitigate exploitation of 
communications should be considered.  If public phones are not available, consider establishing 
off-base telephone access at informational and assistance kiosks for attendees. 
10.13.  Recommended Equipment Items.   Following is a list of equipment items that can be 
used to enhance an installation’s ability to ensure force protection during events.  Installations 
should consider purchasing / renting / leasing these items to prevent weapons from being 
introduced into the event site. 
10.13.1.  Light Weight Walk-Through Magnetometers.  There are versions of walk-
through magnetometers that can be used at screening locations. They operate on 115 volts 
alternating current and cost approximately $5K per unit. 
82 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
10.13.2.  Portable X-Ray Screener.  These come in lightweight tabletop configurations and 
can be used for checking hand carried items.  They operate on 115 volts alternating current 
and cost approximately $15K per unit. 
10.13.3.  Hand-Held Metal Detectors  .  Hand-held metal detectors can be used at screening 
locations for checking personnel entering the event site. 
10.13.4.  ION Scanners.  Portable ION scanners operate on batteries.  They may be used to 
check purses, diaper bags, etc. for explosive material prior to allowing entry to the event site.

Chapter 11 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS SUPPORT 
11.1.  Overview.  The Air Force shall conduct comprehensive, active communications programs 
at all levels of command—in garrison and while deployed—to provide Airmen and their 
families, Congress and the American public timely, factual and accurate Department of Defense 
and Air Force information that contributes to awareness and understanding of the Air Force 
mission.  The Air Force hosts open houses to enhance the public awareness of Air Force 
preparedness, to demonstrate modern weapon systems and capabilities, to promote positive 
community and international relations, to showcase our Airmen and to support Air Force 
recruiting and retention.  Opening Air Force bases to the public provides opportunities for 
education and generates interest in the military and its role in national security.  The public 
affairs checklist Attachment 2 A2.4. provides additional guidance on public affairs activities at 
an open house. 
11.2.  Military Demonstration Teams.    Submit requests for the Thunderbirds and the Blue 
Angels prior to the beginning of the 12-15 month open house planning cycle.  It is normally a 
public affairs responsibility to submit the requests.  In order to be eligible for one of the military 
demonstration teams, installations should submit a completed DD Form 2535 to the appropriate 
office before the appropriate submission deadline.  A copy of the DD Form 2535 should be 
submitted to each military service the installation is interested in hosting.  Each branch of the 
military has specific requirements for support, and as such, requests are not automatically shared 
between the branches. NOTE:  When the DD Form 2535 is submitted to the Federal Aviation 
Administration, the flight standards district office requires an aerobatic box diagram to 
accompany the request.  If one has been appointed for an upcoming event, coordinate with open 
house director to obtain the diagram.  If a director hasn’t been appointed, coordinate with the 
previous show’s director, or with the Operations Group if the previous director isn’t available. 
11.2.1.  Request Timelines.    See page 4 of the DD Form 2535 for current submission 
instructions. 
11.2.1.1.  US Air Force.    All requests for Air Force aircraft, including demonstration 
teams, and static displays, are made through the Air Force Aerial Event website at 
www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil.  See the site and the current year’s Aerial Events Message 
for the most up-to-date submission requirements. 
11.2.1.1.1.  Thunderbirds.   Submissions for the Air Force Thunderbirds are 
submitted through the MAJCOM/PA Community Relations section to SAF/PAY no 
later than July 1 two years prior to the requested show year. 
11.2.1.1.2.  USAF 
Heritage 
Flight/ACC 
Single 
Ship 
Demonstration 
Teams.    Submissions for the USAF Heritage Flight/ACC Single Ship 
Demonstration Teams can be submitted (no later than July 1 one year prior to the 
requested 
show 
year) 
through 
the 
Aerial 
Events 
Website 
(https://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil) and should be coordinated directly through 
ACC/A3TA (acc.a3ta@us.af.mil).  Events that received SAF/PA approval in the 
previous year when requesting Thunderbirds support will automatically be considered 
for Single Ship support and do not need to resubmit. 
84 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
11.2.1.1.3.  US Air Force Academy Wings of Blue.  See paragraph  4.3.2.  To be 
considered for Wings of Blue participation, provide the approved Aerial Event 
System request number to the 306th Flying Training Group at USAF Academy at 
least 60 days prior to the open house.  For more information, contact Wings of Blue at 
719-333-1211. 
11.2.1.2.  US Navy.  For more information about requesting USN aerial support, visit 
http://www.outreach.navy.mil/Aviation1/. 
11.2.1.2.1.  Blue Angels.   Submissions for the USN Blue Angels is submitted 
through the MAJCOM/PA Community Relations section to Naval Community 
Outreach no later than July 1 two years prior to the requested show year. Shows that 
had requested Blue Angels support in the previous year will automatically be 
considered and do not need to resubmit their request. 
11.2.1.2.2.  F/A-18 Single Ship Demonstration Team.    Submissions for the Single 
Ship Demonstration team are submitted through the MAJCOM/PA Community 
Relations section to Naval Community Outreach no later than July 1 one year prior to 
the requested show year. 
11.2.1.3.  Royal Canadian Air Forces (RCAF) Snowbirds.    Requests for the Canadian 
Snowbirds is submitted to the team no later than Sept 1 the year prior to the show year 
requested.  Do not submit DD Form 2535s to request the Snowbirds.  Request forms and 
submission instructions can be found on the RCAF Snowbirds website at 
http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/snowbirds/booking.page. 
11.2.2.  Cancellations.  An installation canceling a performance by a demonstration team, 
particularly the Thunderbirds, Blue Angels, or Snowbirds, should immediately send a 
message listing the date the performance was scheduled, place, reason for cancellation, and 
person canceling performance (with phone number and affiliation, if possible, for civilian 
site) to the location dictated by the demonstration team’s support manual.  The cancellation 
notice should be routed through public affairs channels to the appropriate headquarters with 
the following as information addressees: SAF/PAY, HAF/A3O, ACC/PA and ACC/A3. 
11.3.  Community Relations/Community Engagement.  Although an open house is considered 
a community relations event, there are several specific areas of concern that should be addressed 
during the planning process.  These include: providing open house exhibits, coordinator and 
commercial points of contacts with community groups, industry representatives, and other 
MAJCOMs for potential ground displays; in coordination with protocol, ensuring key 
community leaders are invited to distinguished visitor receptions and the event distinguished 
visitor viewing area; developing a plan to reach out to community groups and businesses to aid 
in publicity of the event; and scheduling performers for key recruiting and goodwill visits to 
local schools and hospitals. 
11.3.1.  Distinguished Visitors.  Although protocol usually is the lead agency in planning 
key distinguished visitor receptions and arrangements for the commander’s viewing area 
during the show, however it is important to ensure public affairs remains actively engaged.  
At many locations, the local Chamber of Commerce military affairs committee, or other 
community groups may be interested in sponsoring a reception for key event performers and 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
85 
other invited guests.  When this happens, public affairs should coordinate military support 
and participation in that distinguished visitor event. 
11.3.2.  Rehearsal Show Invitations.  Many open house plans lend themselves to having a 
rehearsal show the day before the base is open to the general public.  This show allows the 
base to invite members of the general public who have special needs and may not be able to 
attend the show in a large crowd.  Open house staffs should consider extending invitations to 
organizations such as special needs schools and senior citizen homes.  Having fewer people 
on the flight line allows these guests to be dropped off within a short distance of the seating 
area.  When inviting people with special needs, be sure to provide disabled accessible seating 
within close proximity to appropriate bathroom facilities, a covered area to escape the 
elements, and access to water.  Groups should be encouraged to bring their own snacks.  
Consider opening a limited number of concession booths for the group’s convenience. 
11.3.3.  Sponsor Appreciation.  Once an open house is over, it’s important to the base 
relationship with the local community to thank any community partners that provided support 
/ donations to help pay for the open house.  Coordinate with the open house director and legal 
to ensure appropriate tokens of appreciation are presented in a timely manner.  Examples 
include a thank you letter from the installation commander, framed open house advertisement 
posters, signed demonstration team posters, etc. 
11.4.  Media Relations/Media Operations.  An open house gives the Air Force an opportunity 
to make a favorable impression on the thousands of people who attend.  Engaging the local 
media, provides an opportunity to extend that reach to a larger audience to learn about the Air 
Force through newspapers, magazines, internet, radio and television.  Public affairs should 
devise a marketing strategy and publicize the event through all available media.  Publicity 
opportunities can also include interaction with the local Chamber of Commerce, tourism board, 
and industry forums in the region. 
11.4.1.  Media Access.    While the open house is open to the public, members of the media 
should be credentialed and provided access badges.  There should also be a centrally located 
media center, media risers / lifts, special parking and / or options for loading / unloading of 
equipment.  Public affairs should also consider securing transportation around the flight line 
or base to facilitate interviews and stories.  Ensure a suitable number of public affairs 
representatives are available to work with the media, facilitate interviews, and answer 
questions. 
11.4.1.1.  Credentialing.  Credentials for media are only required if the media is being 
provided special access.  Public affairs personnel should give great care to ensure that 
only bona fide media representatives, freelance writers, photographers and videographers 
are credentialed.  If the media badges allow access to areas closed to the general public, a 
public affairs representative is to remain with the media at all times when they are in a 
restricted / closed area.  Coordinate media badge procedures and access with Security 
Forces prior to the event. 
11.4.1.2.  Aircraft specific security requirements.   Ensure any aircraft specific 
photography / videography restrictions are followed.  Contact the aircraft’s home station 
and / or speak with the Aircraft Commander to obtain information about what views on 
the aircraft cannot be filmed.  Ensure this information is shared with media escorts and 
military public affairs personnel documenting the open house. 
86 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
11.5.  Command Information.  The base residents and work force should be kept informed of 
open house activities and plans.  Use all available information avenues to include but not limited 
to, the installation’s public Web and social media sites, e-mail, base newspaper, marquees, and 
commander’s access channel to ensure personnel are kept aware of road closures, security 
concerns, schedule changes and other open house information. 
11.5.1.  OPSEC.    Due to the large number of non-organic aircraft usually present at open 
houses, public affairs should take extra steps to ensure sensitive / classified information isn’t 
released.  See paragraph  11.4.1.2. 
11.5.2.  Inserts and Programs.  Public affairs coordinators should review the base 
newspaper contract and/or memorandum of agreements, if applicable prior to the open house 
to determine if the publisher has a contract to produce an event insert prior to the event.  If 
the publisher has a contract for the insert, it is unlikely the base will be able to produce an 
independent souvenir program.  However, if the publisher does not have the insert in the 
contract (preferred), programs may be published in-house, or contracted to an independent 
printer.  The Force Support Squadron may choose to develop a souvenir program to be sold 
that contains all elements of the open house.  See paragraph  5.4. and paragraph  6.8.1. 
11.5.3.  Open House Website.   Incorporate open house information into the installation’s 
public Web site.  Exercise appropriate Government control over Government Web sites 
operated through contracts. 
11.5.3.1.  Commercially produced websites include the statement “No Federal 
endorsement of advertisers / sponsors is intended or implied.” 
11.6.  Recruiting Involvement.  Personnel from the local recruiting squadron should be present 
at the open house to capitalize on the gathering of so many people with positive attitudes towards 
the military.  Recruiting normally has interesting displays, simulators, etc., to inform the public 
about Air Force life. Air Force Recruiting squadrons and displays should always be set up next 
to the Air Force demonstration team displays to capitalize on foot traffic to that area.  Contact 
information for recruiting organizations is in Attachment 5.

Terms 
NOTE —:  To avoid changing traditional terminology used by the Air Force to discuss aviation 
support, the Air Force term aerial event as used in this Manual is synonymous with the DoD term 
aerial demonstration and the Air Force term aerial demonstration is synonymous with the DoD 
term aerial activity. 
Aerial Demonstration—Aerial Demonstration is a generic phrase that includes (except for static 
display, aerial review and flyover) virtually every type of aerial participation in military or public 
events: aerobatics, assault landing / takeoffs, aircraft weapons or tactics demonstrations, USAF 
vintage aircraft programs, single-ship demonstration teams, airdrop demonstrations of personnel 
or equipment, in-flight refueling demonstrations, or aircraft capabilities demonstrations, Air 
Force Parachute Team (AFPT) performances, CSAR demonstrations and helicopter flight 
demonstrations consisting of steep 
Approach —quick-stop landing, hovering, fire suppression, and personnel alternate 
insertion/extraction.  Aerial demonstration is synonymous with the phrases aerial demo, aircraft 
demonstration, aircraft capabilities demonstration, and aircraft capabilities exercise. 
Aerial Demonstration Team—An officially designated DoD demonstration team such as the 
USAF Thunderbirds, US Navy Blue Angels, and US Army Golden Knights, etc.  This term can 
be applied to USAF vintage aircraft (Air Force Heritage Flight Program) and Air Combat 
Command single-ship demonstration teams. 
Aerial Event—Aerial event, synonymous with aviation support, comprises static display, 
flyover, aerial review and aerial demonstration.  Any aerial activity, including static displays and 
Air Force parachute team demonstrations, by Air Force aircraft or personnel taking part in 
military events, public events, or community relations programs. 
Aerial Performance—A generic phrase including virtually every type of aerial participation in 
military or civilian events: Flyover, aerial review, aerial demonstration and aircraft capabilities 
demonstration. 
Aerial Review—A subset of aviation support, is a flyover of more than four aircraft, or of 
multiple types of aircraft, or of aircraft representing more than one military service or nation, 
regardless of horizontal / timing separation of flying elements.  An aerial review may include 
civilian aircraft.  It may have elements in trail formation and does not involve precision 
maneuvers or demonstrations.  The elements of the aerial review may be individual aircraft, 
formations, or a combination of individual aircraft and formations.  A single element flyover 
involving four or fewer aircraft of multiple MDS of the same type from the same military service 
is not considered an aerial review. 
Aerobatic Box—The airspace within the demonstration area and flying display area at an air 
show where participating aircraft are authorized to perform aerobatic maneuvers appropriate to 
their category. 
Aircraft Demonstration—See Aerial Demonstration. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018

aircraft stall speed and on a steeper-than-normal approach path.  After touchdown, maximum 
engine reverse thrust and braking are applied to stop the aircraft. 
Assault (Max Performance) Takeoff Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration 
illustrating a takeoff technique used for departing short runways employing maximum takeoff 
power and climb rate for the aircraft.  Also referred to as “Maximum Performance Takeoff” or 
“Maximum Effort Takeoff.” 
Aviation Support—Aviation support, synonymous with aerial event, comprises static display, 
flyover, aerial review and aerial demonstration.  Aerial demonstration includes a wide variety of 
aerial activities. 
Capabilities Demonstration or Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX)—Normally associated with 
aircraft demonstrating unique characteristics of a weapon system or group of weapon systems.  A 
capabilities demonstration is one that shows the aircraft conducting maneuvers usually 
associated with its employment and is common to the airframe being shown. 
Civilian Aerial Demonstration (or Act)—An aerial demonstration or act not flown to 
demonstrate military capability or history, but with the purpose of showcasing piloting skill or 
primarily to entertain the spectators.

however, they may not include every action to be considered by the open house staff. 
Table A2.1.  General Planning. 
Consideration 
OPR 
Complete 
Long-term planning. 
Determine a date(s) for the event.  Consider events being held in the 
local community, historical significance, and availability of guests.  
Consider backup dates for demonstration team availability. 
Determine whether the event is one day or multiple days. 
Determine start and end times for the event.  Most events start in 
late morning and finish mid-to-late afternoon. 
Determine rehearsal requirements.  Recommend rehearsal day 
on/near same timeline as the event day(s) to ensure as similar an 
environment (daylight, sun position, circadian rhythm, etc.) as 
possible. 
Determine exhibit locations.  Can exhibits be located, both from on 
base and from the community? 
Determine off-limits/restricted areas. 
Determine whether the facility has the capacity for the expected 
crowd. 
Clear the event with Numbered AF, MAJCOM, and HAF as 
required. 
Appoint staff and committees to handle open house functions.  
Ensure committee assignments are explicit and inclusive. 
Plan and execute table-top exercise. 
Ensure recruiters have been brought into the planning. 
Obtain good airfield or site layout diagram. 
Submit DD Form 2535 to MAJCOM PA for submission to 
SAF/PA. (SAF/PA requires the DD Form 2535 by 1 July, two years 
prior to the year of the open house for consideration in the Air Force 
Aerial Demonstration Squadron scheduling.). 
Event Planning 
Coordinate with airfield management and have regular meetings to 
keep them abreast of developments and requirements. 
Arrange for construction and electrical permit if needed. 
Consideration 
OPR 
Complete 
Arrange for necessary barricades, snow fencing, ropes, stanchions 
and other crowd-control devices to be purchased, leased or 
borrowed, delivered and installed in a timely manner. 
Work with appropriate chairmen to determine locations of all static 
displays and provide for necessary security and crowd control. 
96 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
Work with concession chairman to establish a plan for the location 
of concession booths.  Make sure required electrical power is 
available where and when needed. 
Military aircraft, tanks, and other weapons displays often have 
unusual weight requirements.  Coordinate with airfield management 
to use appropriate ramps and access roads. 
Set up and clearly mark parking areas and traffic routes on site. 
Arrange for rental of portable lavatories.  Rental contracts include 
provisions to pump and re-supply with chemicals and toilet paper 
for each day of use. 
Drinking water is essential.  If drinking water is not readily available 
on site, implement a solution for providing drinking water that is 
acceptable to the local health department to pipe or transport 
sufficient quantities of water to the open house site.  If possible, 
arrange for stand-by sprinklers for spectator cool-down in the event 
of extremely hot weather. 
Arrange for conveniently located trashcans for spectators use.  
Ample numbers will greatly lessen post-show clean up.  Prompt and 
thorough cleaning of the site will leave a good impression on the 
public 
Arrange for emptying of trash barrels throughout the day and for 
trash removal from the site at the end of each day of use. 
Create facilities diagram showing staging sites of all emergency 
vehicles and locations of first aid stations/medical units, information 
center, lost & found, food/beverage/souvenir stands, lavatory 
facilities, display areas and crowd lines.  Publish as a separate 
handout to arriving spectators and/or as an insert or published page 
in the program.  Each volunteer should have a copy and copies 
should be posted in all spectator service areas. 
Coordinate with the installation traffic engineer to make sure traffic 
cones, lane dividers, and entrance locations are properly set up. 
Provide personnel to meet and direct early-arriving volunteers, 
concessionaires, static display crews and exhibitors; and provide 
each arrival with a diagram that shows the location of their assigned 
site or reporting station. 
Coordinate with Security Forces to ensure areas that are off limits to 
spectators are properly marked and secured.  Actual marking and 
security of off limits areas is an owner/user responsibility. 
Arrange for a sound system that meets all requirements for the 
event.  Coordinate power requirements, location of speakers and 
cable runs.  Make sure the sound system covers all spectator areas 
including distinguished visitor areas. 
Provide an announcing platform that allows good visibility for the 
open house announcer and assistants. 
Plan entrance and exits for emergency vehicles and emergency 
aircraft. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
97 
Consideration 
OPR 
Complete 
Plan alternate entrances and exits for emergency vehicles in the event 
primary routes are blocked. 
Plan spectator exit in case of an emergency 
Plan a route for performing aircraft to get from overnight hangars to 
the flight line or staging area. 
Locate the commander’s hospitality tent on the flight line, but leave 
room for the public to enjoy clear viewing areas. 
Designate a central headquarters for resolving problems.  Staff with 
a decision maker who has the authority to take action. 
Set aside specific areas for ground demonstrations (K-9 skills, etc.) 
and sponsor displays. 
Work with legal coordinator and Security Forces to establish 
procedures for responding to protestors, vandals, and others who 
may need to be apprehended. 
Coordinate with the wing antiterrorism office to ensure all force 
protection requirements are met throughout event planning and 
execution. 
Identify timelines for communications support and implementation 
at the initial planning meeting. 
Transportation Issues 
If using buses for shuttles or other transportation needs, get cost 
quotations early from charter bus companies, school districts or 
other sources.  Prior to any Government representatives making a 
verbal or written agreement, all information gathered for 
transportation needs to be coordinated with the contracting 
officer/coordinator to ensure compliance in accordance with Federal 
Acquisition Regulations.  Publish routes, schedules and locations of 
stops for distribution to volunteers, drivers and passengers.  Assign 
volunteers as necessary and monitor regularly throughout operation. 
Working with the hospitality coordinator, estimate vehicle 
requirements as early as possible (six months in advance is not too 
early).  Refine requirements as show dates near. 
Determine alternate sources to meet vehicle support requirements 
(GOV or GSA motor pool support or, if Government support is 
unavailable, rentals).  While non-Federal entities/donors may not 
be solicited to provide vehicle support, this need can be a subject 
of discussion once a prospective donor has indicated a desire to 
support the event with a gift after consultation with legal 
coordinator. 
Arrange for any car rentals to be reimbursed by the AF—e.g., cars 
rented by performers or others pursuant to contracts or invitational 
travel orders. 
98 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
Determine early whether dealers will shuttle vehicles to the open 
houses’ distribution point or whether a volunteer pick-up and return 
brigade is necessary.  Organize accordingly, ensuring that volunteer 
drivers meet State licensing law and dealer’s driver age 
requirements; and that shuttle transportation is arranged. 
Establish a central distribution center with trained personnel to issue 
vehicles and brief drivers. 
Prepare vehicle allocation schedule. 
Consideration 
OPR 
Complete 
Arrange and determine funding source (see Attachment 4 Funding 
Matrix) for refueling of rental vehicles.  Explain specific procedures 
to each recipient. 
Brief each driver of his/her responsibility to return the vehicle and 
keys at a specified time to a specified location, and to maintain it in 
good condition.  Verify license and insurance. 
Provide each driver with emergency phone numbers where the 
transportation chairman and/or authorized designee can be reached 
around-the-clock in case of breakdown or emergency. 
Prepare checklist of all cars returned.  Check for damage.  Arrange 
for cleaning and refueling of each vehicle prior to its return.  May 
need to arrange with donor for volunteers to accomplish these tasks 
on cars provided by non-Federal entities via gift. 
It is vital to stage vehicles required by military demonstration teams 
in position upon their arrival.  This is a manual requirement and is 
non-negotiable.  Check the team support manual for exact numbers 
and types of vehicles and staging requirements. 
If helicopters are to be used for distinguished visitor transportation, 
work with the air operations officer, Federal Aviation 
Administration and hotel and airfield/airport managers to arrange 
for safe and efficient operations. 
Review procedures for accommodating disabled visitors. 
CHECKLIST -- Other Ground Displays 
With public affairs, coordinate military recruiting involvement and 
make sure an area is set aside for booths at the event, both inside 
and outside.  Recruiting contact information is in Attachment 5 
Invite base organizations to set up a display in a hangar, or suitable 
location, for the public to learn more about the Air Force and escape 
the heat of the day, if applicable.  Be sure it’s easily accessible by 
the public. 
Consider setting up a stage to highlight other base agencies, e.g., 
military working dog demonstrations, military band and honor 
guard/drill team performances, explosive ordnance disposal 
display, etc. 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
99 
Allow spectators to view displays of field equipment, such as medic 
tents, field kitchens, various items airmen deploy with, and non- 
aviation static displays. 
Consider inviting other MAJCOMs, especially Special Operations, 
to also display at the event.  Provides a ―big-picture‖ look at the Air 
Force. 
Consider also including local civilian and industry exhibits. 
Ensure adequate security is provided for displays. 
Have the announcer make numerous references to the ground display 
location and stage acts. 
Work with Services Marketing and/or non-Federal entities to 
look for some creative children’s exhibits that contribute to 
education about the Air Force and aviation. 
Consider providing a covered area for families with young children 
to rest.

Complete 
CHECKLIST -- Announcer 
Assist in the selection of the open house announcer.  This individual 
could be an employee of the base, or a paid professional contractor. 
Work closely with the open house staff to develop the script for the 
announcer.  Ensure all information has been cleared for release. 
Include key Air Force messages and recruiting items. 
Since one of the primary goals is education, ensure civilian and 
warbird narrations include as much information as possible on their 
military roles or connections. 
If the announcer is contracted, provide enough filler and background 
material to ensure the audience stays engaged. 
Include clear instructions to announce during specific mishaps or 
emergencies. 
Open House Related Events 
Work with public affairs, Protocol and Services to determine what 
events the base wants to plan in conjunction with the open house.  
(e.g., rehearsal event for area special needs individuals, aircrew 
welcome party, base picnic, concerts, distinguished visitor 
reception, distinguished visitor tent on flight line, etc.) 
Determine how base personnel can take part in pre-event programs. 
Sort out responsibilities for each event. 
Public affairs should publicize events and works with Protocol to 
provide a list of community leaders to be invited to the reception 
and open house. 
Determine if transportation is needed for the rehearsal 
event attendees.

Section A2.  Public Affairs. 
Public affairs personnel are involved in many aspects of the open house set-up.  Although the 
public affairs officer is not appointed as the open house director, open houses are community 
relations events.  Public affairs should be involved in most of the decision-making process. 
 
A strong public affairs effort can often provide the most cost-effective tool for ensuring the 
general public knows about and attends the open house. 
 
Strong attendance is key to the success of any open house.  In large measure, attendance will 
depend directly on the effectiveness of marketing efforts. 
 
Prior to the open house, give time and attention to the media, both internal and external, for pre-
event promotion and publicity.  At the open house itself, pay attention to the media’s needs.  
Event coverage brings people from their homes to the event site.  Post-event publicity tells 
people what they missed and encourages future attendance.  Internal media should have same 
access and consideration as external media. 
 
Nearly all open houses produce some type of souvenir program.  Check all contracts for public 
affairs products to determine if any contractor has sole rights to develop an open house 
program.  If not, Services may produce and sell a souvenir program, funded by the sale of 
advertising.  Souvenir programs contain photos and articles about featured military and civilian 
performers and aircraft, and information about and/or diagrams showing the locations of 
important facilities and spectator services (see paragraph 5.1.11., paragraph 5.4., paragraph 
6.8.4., and paragraph 11.5.).  It may contain a schedule of Services activities.  In the event a 
program is to be sold, a free copy of the performance schedule is made available to the general 
public. 
 
Photo coverage of the event is an important aspect of internal and external pre- and post- 
publicity.  It also provides a historical record of the day’s events.

Notes: 
1 
Appropriated funds may be used to cover costs 
for warbird participating in the open house.  
Lodging, meals and transportation may be 
included as part of the contract.  May be 
offered free of charge by the performer or paid 
by non-Federal/private organizations and 
offered as a gift to the Air Force. 
2 
Installation commanders may designate work 
areas to be used by non-DoD personnel for 
repairing an aircraft, grant access to shop 
facilities, and, if requested, permit assistance by 
qualified USAF maintenance personnel on a 
strictly volunteer basis.  Also, hangar space may 
be made available to non-DoD aircraft on a space 
available basis for protection from inclement 
weather. 
3 
Non-appropriated funds are authorized through the 
Commercial Sponsorship Program (must be 
approved by AF/A1S per paragraph 2.8.1.).  May 
be paid by non-Federal/private organizations as a 
sponsored act or offered by the performer as a gift 
to the Air Force or the Services non-appropriated 
fund instrumentality.  (Paying for food for military 
members or appropriated funds employees is not an 
authorized use of commercial sponsorship) (T-1). 
4 
Unless the Government (including an AF non-
appropriated fund instrumentality) has 
contracted to provide fuel, the installation 
may authorize Defense Working Capital Fund 
(DWCF) fuel cash sales for aircraft pursuant 
to DLA Energy policy guidance. 
5 
A non-Federal entity that desires to provide funding 
for this item can only do so through a monetary 
(conditional) gift to the Air Force.  The donor may 
not specify or influence the Contractor to be selected 
or utilized by the Air Force or tender the services of 
the Contractor as an in-kind contract to the Air 
Force.” 
124 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
6 
May be funded with appropriated funds, non-
appropriated funds or private funds depending on 
part of the show being supported.  Essential 
elements (sanitation, health, safety, security, comfort 
of attendees etc.) are paid only with appropriated 
funds.  Essential items are those that would occur 
even if there were no Services morale, welfare, and 
recreation/ non-Federal entity participation.  Items in 
support of Services morale, welfare, and 
recreation/non-Federal entity concessions (including 
additional sanitation measures needed because of 
such concessions) or Services morale, welfare, and 
recreation/non-Federal entity provided entertainment 
can be supported with non-appropriated funds or 
funds raised/donated by a private organization.  
When appropriated funds are proper fund source, 
non-appropriated fund assets may be used as long as
appropriated funds cover all incremental costs 
associated with their use for that purpose 
(maintenance, fuel, wear and tear, etc.).  See 
paragraph 1.12. and paragraph 6.6.  Use non-
appropriated funds to pay for items that directly 
support morale, welfare, and recreation/Services 
business operations such as tent and seating 
concessions. 
7 
Appropriated funds can be used but public affairs 
should maximize the use of free Public Service 
announcements.  Non-appropriated funds may be 
used to advertise morale, welfare, and recreation 
programs and events.  Commercial ads promoting 
the open house can be paid for by sponsors (those 
same sponsors can be listed on the ad itself) and 
off-base establishments that serve as sponsors can 
acknowledge their support in their own 
promotional endeavors prior to the actual event.  
Ensure paid or donated advertising contains the 
disclaimer ―”No Federal Endorsement Intended.” 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
125 
8 
Event guides (i.e., schedule of events) are 
appropriated funds funded.  Non-appropriated 
funds/private funds can be used to print programs 
for Services/ morale, welfare, and recreation events 
occurring at the open house (e.g., concert) or if the 
non-appropriated fund instrumentality determines 
the morale, welfare, and recreation benefit or 
expected increase in non-appropriated fund 
concessions profit justifies the expense.  Open 
house souvenir programs can be non-appropriated 
funds/private funds if the base newspaper contractor 
does not have the rights.  These may contain paid 
advertisements to cover the costs of printing.  Public 
affairs should provide a free schedule of events’ 
when souvenir programs/event guides are provided 
with non-appropriated funds/private funds. 
9 
Appropriated funds supported public base 
website can be used to provide open house 
information (use appropriate disclaimers for 
links to unofficial sites).  An outside organization 
(e.g., non-Federal/private) may establish a 
website to promote the event.  Ensure the site 
clearly states that it is not an official Air Force 
website. 
10 
The impression should be that the event is 
conducted in an orderly manner by the United 
States military.  Inappropriate signage would be 
extremely large or garish signs.  Signs cannot 
block view of activities.  Non-Federal/private 
supporters may be provided name recognition for 
their donations and contributions pursuant to 
paragraph 1.8.1. 
Commercial sponsors of Services morale, welfare, 
and recreation elements of the event may be 
provided the various kinds of recognition 
authorized for commercial sponsors. 
11 
Distinguished visitor functions (e.g., commander’s 
hospitality tent, as well as civic and social events 
occurring at the time of the open house) are a 
protocol activity and may be supported with 
Official Representation Funds if in compliance with 
AFI 65-603 or through a gift to the AF (see 
paragraph 1.13.1.).  Distinguished visitor tent 
should be offset from the center of show area.  The 
distinguished visitor area is not sponsored nor can 
any sponsor signs reside in the area. 
126 
AFMAN10-1004  23 AUGUST 2018 
12 
Gifts/mementos for distinguished visitors and VIPs, 
to include welcome baskets, may be provided to 
qualifying individuals and supported by Official 
Representation Funds if they comply with AFI 65-
603 or Special Morale and Welfare Funds if they 
comply with AFI 34-201, Chapter 12. 
13 
Temporary duty fund sources depend on the 
function being supported.  Temporary duty in 
support of appropriated funds elements of the open 
house should be funded with appropriated funds.  
Temporary duty in support of non-appropriated 
fund elements of the open house should be funded 
with non-appropriated funds. 
14 
Non-appropriated funds can be used for event 
insurance for the Services morale, welfare, and 
recreation elements of the event. 
15 
Ensure liability insurance is in-force for 
entertainment attractions, rides and fireworks 
provided by Services morale, welfare, and 
recreation contractors and non-Federal/private 
entities (either directly or through contractors).  
Ensure all contractors have insurance. 
16 
The Open House may be organized such that all 
concessions are provided by a non-Federal entity 
pursuant to an Outgrant.  The installation morale, 
welfare and recreation program should receive 
equitable compensation for foregoing its right to 
provide concessions.  Appropriate signage should 
inform the public that all servers, food and 
beverages are the responsibility of a non-Air Force 
party. 
17 
Commercial sponsorship can only be used for the 
Services morale, welfare, and recreation elements 
(including civilian aerial acts) of the event. 
18 
Appropriated funds or non-appropriated funds may 
provide food only pursuant to a contract provision 
requiring food as part of the Government’s 
consideration.
