UTAs or more will continue to accomplish training at temporary locations where MQT or CT 
training is available. 
2.3.3.  Training extensions will be granted based on any circumstance other than TDY or 
emergency leave, that a commander determines requires a training extension. As 
circumstances dictate, unit commanders may grant an individual one training extension in 
each phase of training.  Group commanders can grant a second extension. If necessary, 
MAJCOM OPRs may grant a third extension. One training extension equals 30 calendar days 
or 3 UTAs for ANG units.  If training is still not complete, the MAJCOM OPR will 
determine whether or not the individual is to be removed from training. 
2.4.  TACP Training Folder (T-3). 
2.4.1.  The TACP Training Folder is a four-part folder that documents TACP training for 
officer personnel who do not maintain a JTAC Evaluation Folder, and all unit enlisted 
personnel that do not maintain an AF Form 623 or JTAC Evaluation Folder. 
2.4.1.1.  Part 1 is the “Table of Contents.” 
2.4.1.2.  Part 2 is “Training Events.”  This portion includes AF Form 1098s for MQT or 
CT, and any local unit training documentation.  Supervisors will update these forms as 
individuals accomplish the training events.  There is no need to archive hardcopy training 
from previous years.  If AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring 
Training, is not filed in the individual’s TACP Training Folder, a Memorandum for 
Record (MFR) will be inserted stating that training completion information is available 
on TACTICS. 
2.4.1.3.  Part 3 is the AF Form 623a. 
2.4.1.4.  Part 4 is “Formal IQT Certificates.”  This portion has the certificate of training 
from Air Liaison Officer Qualification Course (ALOQC) (PDS:-I3S).  Include the 
ALOQC student training report until the person achieves CMR.  For Intel personnel, the 
Joint Firepower Course (JFC), and Air Support Operations Center Initial Qualification 
Course (ASOC IQC) certificates will be filed.  For all other operational officers, the JFC 
certificates will be filed.

Chapter 5 
COMBAT MISSION READY 
5.1.  General.  All TACP UTC-tasked/SORTS reportable personnel and 57 OG Combat Training 
School officer personnel will attain and maintain CMR status (T-1).  All unit personnel that 
maintain a TACP Training Folder require commander’s CMR certification annotated on the AF 
Form 623a or approved automated product, and filed in Part 3 of the individual’s TACP Training 
Folder (T-3).  For all enlisted personnel that maintain an AF Form 623, the Commander’s CMR 
certification will be annotated on their AF Form 623a (T-3).  Group Commanders are not 
required to be CMR or maintain CMR documentation (T-3). 
5.2.  CMR Requirements. 
5.2.1.  Commanders certify all individuals as CMR after they complete IQT and MQT with 
the exception of 1C431s (T-3). 3-level 1C4 personnel must complete MQT and successfully 
complete a formal comprehensive initial 1C4 CMR task evaluation in accordance with Track 
1 of the USAF Operations Training Course, Tactical Air Control Party Mission Qualification 
Training Syllabus (when published), prior to commander’s certification (T-3).  Task 
evaluations will be accomplished by unit task certifiers (T-3).  The initial 1C4 CMR task 
evaluation will be documented in accordance with the USAF Operations Training Course, 
Tactical Air Control Party Mission Qualification Training Syllabus (when published) and 
filed in the individual’s AF Form 623 (T-3). 
5.2.2.  Once a commander certifies an individual as CMR, the individual maintains CMR 
based on continuation training requirements in Chapter 6 (T-3). 
5.2.3.  Group commanders certify squadron commanders CMR upon completion of training 
(T-3). 
5.3.  Training Task Decertification and Non-Combat Mission Ready Status. 
5.3.1.  Commanders and supervisors may decertify individuals on specific training tasks, 
without loss of CMR status, for failure to meet task measurement standards (see paragraph 
5.2.2) using the following process (T-3): 
5.3.1.1.  Task decertification will be annotated on the TACTICS AF Form 1098 by a unit 
Level 2 User. 
5.3.1.2.  UTMs, through the individual’s supervisor, will notify the unit commander of an 
individual’s task decertification and include a proposed plan to regain certification. 
5.3.1.3.  Commanders determine if the decertified task(s) warrant placing an individual in 
Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR) status.  Document N-CMR status on the AF Form 
623a in Part 3 of the individual’s TACP Training Folder or AF Form 623. 
5.4.  Training Task Recertification and Regaining Combat Mission Ready Status. 
5.4.1.  UTMs will design and accomplish (with supervisor and commander approval) a 
training task recertification plan to return an individual to CMR status.  Recertification is 
complete when the individual has re-accomplished the TACTICS module and task 
evaluation, if applicable and demonstrates sufficient knowledge or skill to perform the 
AFI13-113V1  14 JUNE 2012 
  23  
decertified task to the required standard to a trainer/certifier, and the commander’s 
endorsement is placed on the AF Form 623a, in Part 3 of the individual’s TACP Training 
Folder or annotated on AF Form 623a in the individual’s AF Form 623.  AF Form 623 may 
be maintained in electronic or hardcopy format (T-3). 
5.4.2.  N-CMR individuals must re-qualify on the specific, decertified items and demonstrate 
proficiency based on identified task measurement standards for each duty position task under 
the supervision of a trainer/certifier (T-3).  Trainer/certifier will work with the UTM/UOTM 
and individual’s supervisor to tailor a training plan for each individual.  If the N-CMR 
individual’s training plan requires being re-entered into MQT, a comprehensive duty position 
task evaluation will be accomplished. Commanders recertify CMR status, which will be 
annotated on AF Form 623a in the individual’s AF Form 623 or TACP Training Folder. AF 
Form 623 may be maintained in electronic or hardcopy format (T-3).

Chapter 6 
CONTINUATION TRAINING 
6.1.  General.  This chapter prescribes training standards to maintain CMR personnel qualified 
on mission knowledge, skills, and tasks, as approved by unit commanders. 
6.2.  Annual/ Biennial Training Period.  CT requirements are conducted on either an annual or 
a biennial basis, depending on the training item, using a sliding calendar.  The timing for CT 
completion begins the day that the unit commander certifies the individual CMR. For example, 
an academic/task training item is an annual currency and must be accomplished once every 365 
days (T-3).  From the day a commander certifies an individual CMR, they have 365 days to 
complete their initial CT requirements. Biennial requirement are Academic/ Task and use the 
same process as annual task, but on a 730 day sliding calendar (T-3). 
6.2.1.  Training items that are listed as “Academic” only are biennial requirements and must 
be accomplished once every two years (730 days) (T-3).  Biennial training example; an 
individual who accomplishes a biennial training item on 10 September 2009 must re-
accomplish that event by midnight, 9 September 2011. 
6.2.2.  Training items that are listed as “Academic/Task” are annual requirements and must 
be accomplished once every year (365 days) (T-3).  During the initial CT cycle individuals 
must accomplish both the academic and task portions of these training items (T-3).  For all 
subsequent CT cycles individuals are only required to accomplish the task associated with 
the training item, not the academic portion (T-3).  If an individual is decertified on an 
individual training item, they must re-accomplish both the academic and task portions of the 
event prior to being recertified on the item (T-3).  Annual training example; an individual 
who accomplishes an annual training item on 10 September 2009 must re-accomplish that 
event by midnight, 9 September 2010. 
6.3.  Training Events.  CT requirements will be a combination of unit generated events and 
computer-based training. 
6.3.1.  The UTM/UOTM will create a CT plan using as a minimum, all training items 
annotated with a frequency in Table 6.1 and Table 6.2 UTMs will include any additional CT 
items required by the unit commander or higher headquarters into their unit’s CT plan (T-3).  
The CT plan will be documented in the unit training OI (T-3). 
6.3.2.  TACTICS will be used for academic TACP CT requirements (see Chapter 7) (T-3). 
For those training areas not presently in TACTICS, Wing or Group approved training plans 
will be used until those areas appear in TACTICS (T-3). Each academic training task will 
require successful completion of an examination (80 percent minimum to pass) (T-3). 
6.3.2.1.  Units must use TACTICS when the academic training module is available on the 
system with the exception of those modules that require Intelligence personnel to provide 
instruction (T-3). TACTICS training modules may be taught and tested in a group setting. 
Individuals test results and training will be documented in TACTICS by a unit Level 2 
User (T-3). 
AFI13-113V1  14 JUNE 2012 
  25  
6.3.2.2.  For modules which require Intelligence personnel to provide instruction. 
Intelligence personnel will document completed training in TACTICS as a Level 2 User 
(T-3). 
6.3.3.  Unit commanders will decide if failure to complete all unit commander or higher 
headquarters (Wing/Group) CT requirements warrants the individual to be placed on N-CMR 
status (T-3).  Commanders should base their decision on the number of requirements not 
completed, any training schedule adjustments/extensions done IAW paragraph 2.3, and 
impact on unit mission. Completion of Table 6.1(Ops) or Table 6.2 (Support) is mandated to 
maintain CMR status (T-3). 
6.3.4.  1C4X1 personnel filling JTAC positions are not required to use Table 6.1 as their CT 
table. 1C4X1 JTACs will comply with CT requirements of AFI 13-112, Volume 1, JTAC 
Training Program (T-3). 
6.4.  Regaining CMR Status.  Commanders will recertify individuals IAW paragraph 5.4 (T-3). 
6.5.  Documentation.  Completed training tasks for officer and enlisted, will be annotated on AF 
Form 1098 (T-3).  These documents will be kept in the individual’s TACP Training Folder or AF 
Form 623 (T-3).  AF Form 623 may be maintained in electronic or hardcopy format.  If AF Form 
1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, is not filed in the individual’s TACP 
Training Folder or AF Form 623, a Memorandum for Record (MFR) will be inserted stating that 
training completion information is available on TACTICS (T-3).  TACP personnel will maintain 
their MQT documentation, i.e. AF Form 1098s, until the initial CT requirements are completed 
and documented (T-3).

THEATER AIR CONTROL TRAINING INFORMATION COMPUTER SYSTEM 
8.1.  General.  The Theater Air Control Training Information Computer System (TACTICS) 
standardizes the MQT and CT training of the TACP community.  TACTICS provides members 
with global access to standardized, web-based training, and the ability to track this training.  
TACTICS is on the Internet at http://www.tactics-training.com/. 
8.1.1.  TACTICS provides the user with access to online courseware, and the ability to record 
courses and tests taken offline from the training tables.  Users also have access to the Power 
Point® presentations associated with each course, including full course notes as well as all 
non-restricted references and a glossary of terms. 
8.1.2.  Access into TACTICS is divided into four separate areas:  Level II, Level II (read-
only), Supervisor, and Student.  Level II access is an administrative level for users that 
allows them to enter assigned personnel into the TACTICS system, download TACTICS 
training modules for classroom use, generate module tests, assign students specific modules 
and training tables, update training completion dates, enter test scores, decertify individual 
training items, and track unit/individual progress.  Typically, the Level II users are the Unit 
Training Managers and JTAC-Is, but can include other unit personnel with a need-to-know 
determined by the unit Commander.  Level II (read-only) allows personnel to view all reports 
and records of unit personnel in TACTICS without the ability to edit any records. Supervisor 
allows individuals listed as Supervisors in TACTICS to enroll their personnel into specific 
modules and training tables, enter task evaluation completion dates, and view training 
progress reports, training documents, and CAS Logs of their subordinates. Student is the 
standard user level that allows a member to view modules assigned to them, take tests and 
view their individual progress. 
8.2.  Training in TACTICS.  Training in TACTICS is accomplished through units known as 
modules.  Each module is followed by a mandatory test and/or a criterion checklist, when 
applicable.  Test formats are either true-or-false, or multiple choice, and test questions are 
randomly generated each time.  TACTICS tests are designed to be taken in an open book format.  
Visual cues give the learner immediate indication of which modules they have not attempted, 
attempted and failed, or completed successfully. 
8.2.1.  All user scores are stored and maintained, as well as the individual answers to each 
question, so a user may go back and review those questions they missed.  If the person passes 
the test but has missed one or two questions, they will be allowed to review the correct 
responses and the associated references.  Supervisors are notified via e-mail of a 
subordinate’s progress (pass/fail) through the training modules. 
8.3.  Responsibilities for TACTICS.  The responsibilities for use of TACTICS are as follows: 
8.3.1.  ACC/A3FC will: 
8.3.1.1.  Be responsible for overall control and management of the TACTICS system. 
8.3.1.2.  Grant, upon request, Level II access for TACTICS on a need-to-have basis. 
8.3.1.3.  Provide direction and prioritization of module production.

and educates the supported Corps/Division/Brigade with integrating air component ISR with 
land component operations. This individual will be well -versed in JFACC ISR tasking, and will 
advise the ground commanders with ISR subject matter expertise on how best to plan, allocate 
and execute JFACC ISR assets in support of the ground commander’s objectives. 
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)— Training required to achieve a basic level of 
competence in a unit’s primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR status. 
Non—Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR) — The status CMR individuals are placed in after 
failing to complete academic/proficiency training or currency requirements within the allotted 
training cycle.
