SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This document has been substantially revised and needs to be completely reviewed. This 
instruction reflects updated information based on portions of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3212.02E, Performing Electronic Attack in the United States and Canada 
for Tests, Training, and Exercises; Joint Publication (JP) 3-85, Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum 
Operations, Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-51, Electromagnetic Warfare and Electromagnetic 
Spectrum Operations; and Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 16-101, Security Cooperation (SC) and 
Security Assistance (SA) Management. Major changes include (1) replacing many acronyms with 
correct terms to improve readability, (2) consolidating sections on process, terminology and 
organizational functions to provide a single chapter on EWIR fundamentals, and (3) updating 
office symbols throughout the text, acronym listing and EWIR committee membership matrix. 
Additionally, organizational changes within the Department of the Air Force (DAF) are on-going. 
At the time of publication, the USSF is still developing its headquarters organizational structure 
with associated roles and responsibilities. The USSF will leverage Air Force structure and 
capability until the USSF further defines its organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities. 
The Air Staff will coordinate with equivalents on the Office of the Chief of Space Operations 
(informally Space Staff), as necessary. Upon activation of the 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing, 
EWIR processes with respect to air and space platforms will be defined and revised, as necessary.

Chapter 1 
PURPOSE, PROCESS AND ORGANIZATIONAL FUNCTIONS 
1.1.  Purpose.  The purpose of EWIR is to provide a capability to characterize adversary, friendly, 
and third-party electromagnetic emissions, understand their impact on operations, and to optimize 
friendly system capability. 
1.1.1.  Operations in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) are characterized by friendly, 
neutral, and hostile threat systems that use the EMS. EWIR is an integrated, structured set of 
processes and associated technologies designed to enable friendly forces to attack, maneuver, 
and exploit the EMS to achieve mission success. 
1.1.2.  EWIR optimization includes (but is not limited to) the capability to rapidly detect, 
accurately identify, and respond appropriately. EWIR functions are foundational to successful 
Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations and Electromagnetic Warfare (EW). 
1.2.  EWIR Process.  The EWIR process consists of four processes (See Figure 1.1 below). These 
interconnected processes are: 1) Change Detection Process; 2) Impact Determination Process; 3) 
Reprogramming Process; and 4) Change Delivery Process. The overall combination of processes 
is referred to by the unclassified code name PACER WARE. PACER WARE includes mission 
data changes, missionware changes, operational flight program (OFP) changes, or minor hardware 
changes that comply with the guidance in AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management, 
concerning modifications. These changes are categorized into 3 priority levels: routine, urgent, 
and emergency. These levels are described in paragraph 1.2.1.4.3 Throughout the PACER 
WARE process, requests, information, and direction are provided using a series of messages 
presented starting on paragraph 1.2.1.3. Note: At the time of publication of this document, EWIR 
process roles and responsibilities for USSF organizations such as field commands (FLDCOMs), 
deltas and garrisons have not been fully defined. DAF staffs continue an on-going effort to define 
these roles and responsibilities. As a result, the EWIR process is evolving to incorporate, as 
appropriate, organizational changes and to support the attainment of EMS superiority as presented 
in JP 3-85. 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021

Figure 1.1.  EWIR Process. 
 
1.2.1.  Change Detection Process: 
1.2.1.1.  The US intelligence community collects and evaluates, using multiple sources, a 
wide variety of data on foreign systems and makes these data available in databases 
accessible by the reprogramming centers and other agencies. Functional responsibilities of 
reprogramming centers are provided in paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6 Of the potential sources for 
intelligence, electronic intelligence, imagery intelligence, foreign materiel exploitation, 
and open source intelligence are the most commonly used to identify electromagnetic 
characteristics of enemy systems. Note: This data is referred to as RED (adversary) and 
GRAY (other foreign military) data. Other data sources may include data acquired via 
testing and evaluation of exported (GRAY) systems. Table A3.1 in Attachment 3 provides 
definitions of each color code. Table A3.2 defines US, non-US military, hostile, and non-
hostile users. Table A3.3 consolidates information from the previous two tables into a 
single matrix to explain the characteristics of each color code. 
1.2.1.2.  In the future, the onboard digital recording and processing capabilities will 
provide increasingly robust operational reconnaissance (OPS RECCE) capability. OPS 
RECCE data will supplement traditional sources of data collection supporting change 
detection. 
1.2.1.3.  Along with the RED and GRAY data provided by the intelligence community, 
other types of data are essential to programming electromagnetic warfare (EW) systems to 
correctly identify and respond to detected signals. These other types of data include 
characteristics of US military systems (BLUE data) and commercial systems (WHITE 
data). The purpose of BLUE and WHITE data is similar to that of RED and GRAY data--
to accurately identify systems operating in the electromagnetic environment. BLUE and 
WHITE data are produced, databased, and used in reprogramming updates. All these data 
6 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
types are provided to reprogramming centers via the EWIR database (EWIRDB) and other 
sources, and are used to program EW systems to correctly identify systems by their 
electromagnetic characteristics. See Attachment 3 for more information on data types. 
Signal information on Department of the Air Force (DAF) platforms, and target or 
environment information obtained to support DAF platforms, is shared through the AF 
EWIR process. Note: Electromagnetic spectrum data is shared in accordance with 
Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 8320.05, Electromagnetic Spectrum Data 
Sharing. 
1.2.1.4.  Intelligence and OPS RECCE data is filtered manually or through computer 
flagging models to detect what threats or signals have changed. Periodic data review 
identifies required changes. Refer to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 
(CJCSI) 3320.01D Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (JEMSO), for additional 
guidance. All-source validation assessments by intelligence or service production centers 
and observed signals validation assessments by the National Security Agency (NSA) of 
signal changes are recommended to assist in the determination that actual electromagnetic 
parameter changes have occurred in a given emitter. 
1.2.1.4.1.  Threat Change Validation Request. The threat change validation request is 
a request to the intelligence community to provide validation assessments to the 
reprogramming centers. The assessments contribute to the knowledge base from which 
reprogramming decisions are made. Reprogramming centers have the capability to 
send a threat change validation request using the threat change messaging portal to the 
appropriate service production center and the recognized national signals intelligence 
(SIGINT) authority regarding collected parameters that indicate a change to the 
reprogramming information for a threat system. This message contains information 
concerning the system and parameters in question and a statement of what validation 
assessments are needed. 
1.2.1.4.2.  Threat Change Validation Message. The analysts at the service production 
center or national SIGINT authority assess whether the parameters in question are a 
true capability or mode of the threat system, and also determine whether the threat 
change is valid. Then, using the threat change messaging portal, the analysts send the 
determination via a threat change validation message. Timing of the threat change 
validation assessment will be based upon the priority of the required reprogramming 
action (routine, urgent or emergency) and coordinated with the appropriate 
reprogramming center. Reprogramming centers do not await a validation assessment 
and threat change validation message before beginning a reprogramming action. 
1.2.1.5.  Operational Change Request. In addition to intelligence community activity, 
electromagnetic equipment deficiencies reported by aircrew in post mission reports or a 
joint spectrum interference resolution report may also start the EWIR process. These 
deficiencies may come from: (1) new threats; (2) changed parameters of existing threats; 
(3) aircrew or maintenance personnel interested in improving system operation including 
support equipment or requests for specific mission data updates; (4) changes in operational 
environment, or (5) changes in the intended use of the EW equipment. Organizations and 
individuals performing EWIR must identify EW deficiencies via the operational change 
request message. Operational change request message templates are located in 
EWIR_OPS_PW_MSG_Templates library on the Multi-Service Data Distribution System. 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
7 
1.2.1.5.1.  Distribution. Operational change requests are typically issued by wing or 
group combat systems officer, EW officer or electronic combat pilots to their major 
command (MAJCOM) or EW cell with an informational copy to the appropriate 
operational reprogramming center. The operational reprogramming centers can send an 
operational change request message to their MAJCOM with an informational copy to 
the appropriate wing, or group combat systems officer, EW officer or electronic combat 
pilot. When requesting specific mission data updates, units shall send the operational 
change request message to the operational reprogramming center with a copy to the 
MAJCOM. 
1.2.1.5.2.  Validation. The MAJCOM or EW cell validates the request and tasks the 
appropriate reprogramming center with developing corrective action. Air Combat 
Command (ACC), as the combat air forces lead, validates and prioritizes, as necessary, 
all combat air forces operational change requests [except for Air Force Global Strike 
Command (AFGSC) bomber aircraft or systems]. AFGSC validates and prioritizes, as 
necessary, all AFGSC operational change requests for AFGSC assets. Air Mobility 
Command (AMC), as the mobility air forces lead, validates all mobility air forces 
operational change requests. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), as the 
Air Force special operations lead, validates and prioritizes, as necessary, all Air Force 
special operations operational change requests. 
1.2.1.5.3.  Prioritization. The MAJCOM or EW cell and reprogramming center 
prioritize and evaluate the operational change request and suggest methods for 
implementation. Originators submit an operational change request message with either 
an emergency, urgent, or routine priority. The priority of the operational change request 
message will be included in the text of the message. 
1.2.1.5.3.1.  Reprogramming centers will work on emergency changes, to the 
exclusion of all other activities, on a 24-hour basis until complete. (T-3). 
Originators submit an emergency operational change request message (1) to change 
operational characteristics that might seriously threaten national security; (2) when 
a condition exists preventing an adequate response to a threat, and the situation 
warrants immediate action; (3) to change operational characteristics that might 
result in fatal or serious injury or extensive equipment damage or destruction. 
1.2.1.5.3.2.  An urgent operational change request message shall be submitted with 
a “need” date, and actual timelines and level of effort are determined by negotiation 
between the submitting MAJCOM and the reprogramming center. (T-3). Urgent 
changes shall reach the field within 72 hours, with the goal of having the 
reprogramming center release the required change within 72 hours after a required 
change has been validated. (T-3). These changes normally take precedence over 
any other activity except emergency changes. Originators submit an urgent 
operational change request message (1) to change operational characteristics that 
might seriously threaten mission effectiveness; (2) when a condition exists 
preventing an adequate response to a threat-associated system, and the situation is 
normal but warrants immediate action; (3) to change operational characteristics that 
might result in injury or equipment change. 
 
 
8 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
1.2.1.5.3.3.  Routine operational change requests are normally scheduled and 
included in block cycle updates for the affected EW equipment. Originators submit 
a routine operational change request message when (1) the system has a high 
probability of correctly responding to a threat or can compensate for threat and 
friendly emitter changes, but minor deficiencies exist that may show an error; (2) 
the situation is normal and does not warrant immediate action; (3) the deficiencies 
or errors are not a hazard to personnel or equipment; (4) changes in training mission 
data are desired. 
1.2.1.6.  Software Change Message. The operational reprogramming center must send a 
software change message to the supporting reprogramming center when the operational 
change request affects the operational flight program, EW system hardware, etc. (T-3). 
1.2.1.7.  Additionally, EW software reprogramming updates are consolidated and 
produced to correct deficiencies or to make improvements in system performance. 
Typically, these software changes are handled as routine updates, but in some cases these 
changes become more pressing if the operational situation dictates. Reprogramming 
centers maintain close coordination with affected MAJCOMs and remain flexible to meet 
fielding requirements. 
1.2.2.  Impact Determination Process: 
1.2.2.1.  Reprogramming centers continue the process of assessing the threat change 
impact on an EW system by performing engineering analysis, as well as laboratory tests. 
RC’s also identify areas where they do not possess sufficient data to render a judgement. 
1.2.2.2.  The reprogramming center, in coordination with the affected MAJCOMs or 
commander, Air Force forces (usually the joint or combined force air component 
commander’s EW cell as described in JP 3-85), determines how to respond to the threat 
change. The response will be to: 
1.2.2.2.1.  Take no action. (T-3). 
1.2.2.2.2.  Change existing tactics. (T-3). 
1.2.2.2.3.  Reprogram mission data or operational flight program system software. (T-
3). 
1.2.2.2.4.  Change existing hardware. (T-3). 
1.2.2.2.5.  Acquire new hardware. (T-3). 
1.2.2.3.  System Impact Message. The reprogramming center will report the impact of the 
threat change, the effect on the EW system, an interim course of action, and recommended 
course of action to the affected units, the MAJCOM and joint or combined force air 
component commander in a system impact message. (T-3). The appropriate 
reprogramming center sends the system impact message to the units and MAJCOM or EW 
cell. Critical messages will require verbal contact with the units, MAJCOM or EW cell to 
facilitate “pulling” these system impact messages (and other reprogramming messages) 
from the Multi-Service Data Distribution System. (T-3). This message: 
1.2.2.3.1.  Describes the impact of threat changes on an EW system. 
1.2.2.3.2.  Discusses system deficiencies. 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
9 
1.2.2.3.3.  Recommends interim corrections. Examples of these corrections include 
interim tactics and recommended employment options. 
1.2.2.4.  The receipt of a system impact message may be the first indication a unit receives 
for a threat change. A unit will receive one system impact message followed shortly by the 
reprogramming impact message, maintenance instruction message or time compliance 
technical order, and implementation message for a particular EW system. A unit may also 
receive a number of system impact messages affecting a particular EW system, over a 
period of time, before the reprogramming impact message, maintenance instruction 
message or time compliance technical order, and implementation message for that system 
is received. 
1.2.3.  Reprograming Centers will: 
1.2.3.1.  Notify affected MAJCOM(s) of intent to develop the software or mission data 
change. (T-3). 
1.2.3.2.  Test the change in the laboratory (hardware-in-the-loop, computer simulation, or 
critical analysis). (T-3). 
1.2.3.3.  Determine mission data or system software compatibility with applicable field 
loading equipment, such as: program loader verifiers; memory loader verifiers; Enhanced 
Diagnostic Aide; common aircraft portable reprogramming equipment and applicable O-
level support equipment, such as USM-670, USM- 464, PLM-4, APM-427; or enhanced 
automated special test equipment. (T-3). Tests to determine mission data compatibility will 
be performed prior to fielding routine and urgent changes. (T-3). Operational flight 
program changes will always be tested against support equipment. (T-3). Emergency 
mission data changes will be fielded prior to the tests being performed. (T-3). If the support 
equipment indicates a previously undetected failure with the changed mission data or the 
operational flight program, and the mission data or operational flight program is 
determined to be the cause of the fault, the following actions shall occur: 
1.2.3.3.1.  Describe the failure in the maintenance instruction message or 
reprogramming impact message, as well as the appropriate actions or workarounds that 
shall be taken. For example, ignore--does not indicate a true failure mode. (T-3). 
1.2.3.3.2.  Contact the support reprogramming center and request a change to the 
support equipment software to eliminate the false failure. (T-3). 
1.2.3.4.  Flight test the change, if required. (T-3). EW systems that transmit 
electromagnetic energy for testing, training and exercises in the US and Canada must 
comply with electromagnetic spectrum use policy in accordance with AFI 17-220, 
Spectrum Management, and CJCSM 3212.02E. (T-0). The Air Force Spectrum 
Management Office is the focal point for frequency spectrum management in support of 
EW within the US and US Territories. 
1.2.3.5.  The reprogramming center making software change takes overall lead to 
coordinate with support reprogramming centers and platform program managers. This 
process is critical to facilitate long lead efforts, such as time compliance technical order 
development, validation and verification, scheduling, etc. 
10 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
1.2.3.6.  Program managers take appropriate steps to ensure MAJCOM A3 directed 
timelines and guidance are adhered to during the implementation process. Program 
managers are responsible to identify and ensure all actions necessary are accomplished for 
their mission design series. (T-3). Program managers evaluate all software prior to 
MAJCOM implementation decision and notify the MAJCOM if flight or ground testing is 
required. (T-3). 
1.2.3.7.  Recommend fielding of the software or mission data or missionware change to the 
MAJCOM or the EW cell. If software affects multiple aircraft, such as different mission 
design series with same EW system installed, the reprogramming center will coordinate 
with the program managers prior to making the fielding recommendation to MAJCOM. 
(T-3). Fielding recommendations imply that both the reprogramming center developing the 
software and the program manager responsible for aircraft configuration have completed 
all necessary actions, such as ground, flight or system integration lab testing, or technical 
order documentation prior to recommending to MAJCOM or EW cell the software is ready 
to install. 
1.2.3.8.  The appropriate reprogramming center will send the reprogramming impact 
message to units and MAJCOM or EW cell. (T-3). This message: 
1.2.3.8.1.  Describes in detail how an EWIR change affects an EW system. 
1.2.3.8.2.  States the impact of implementing or not implementing the change. 
1.2.3.8.3.  Helps aircrews and commanders decide when or whether to implement a 
change. 
1.2.3.9.  Maintenance Instruction Message. The appropriate reprogramming center will 
send the maintenance instruction message, which provides maintenance uploading 
instructions, to units along with the changes for an EW system. (T-3). 
1.2.3.10.  The appropriate air logistics complex in most cases, the Air Force Life Cycle 
Management 
Center, 
Electronic 
Warfare/Avionics 
System 
Program 
Office 
(AFLCMC/WNY) sends the time compliance technical order to units.  This message 
includes information on: 
1.2.3.10.1.  New block cycle or operational flight program. 
1.2.3.10.2.  Changes to system handbooks or mission guides. 
1.2.3.10.3.  Changes to mission data. 
1.2.3.10.4.  Implementation instructions. 
1.2.4.  Change Delivery Process: 
 
 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
11 
1.2.4.1.  After coordinating with the MAJCOM or EW cell, the reprogramming centers 
distribute the software changes to operational units and to platform program managers 
electronically through classified organizational PACER WARE SECRET Internet Protocol 
Router Network (SIPRNet) email accounts as well as posting it on the Multi-Service Data 
Distribution System. (T-3). (This system is accessible via the SIPRNet at Detachment 1 
492d Special Operations Wing (Det 1, 492 SOW) homepage http://ecsf.afsoc.af.smil.mil 
or the EW Toolbox-- http://ewtoolbox.eglin.af.smil.mil and via direct secure 
communications equipment connection). Operational unit commanders will implement 
changes based on the guidance in this instruction. (T-3). 
1.2.4.2.  Operational flight program software updates are normally implemented through 
the computer program identification number distribution process. Computer program 
identification number revisions are automatically distributed through technical order 
distribution office accounts. New computer program identification number versions need 
a time compliance technical order to identify the new computer program identification 
number and to inform the technical order distribution officer to establish the identification 
number. Current computer program identification number versions are listed in platform 
manuals for reference by maintenance personnel. The time compliance technical order 
process is temporary and is not be used for long term sustainment of configuration items. 
Program managers will staff time compliance technical orders through appropriate 
MAJCOM A3/A4 offices for approval to release operational flight program software. (T-
3). 
1.2.4.3.  Mission data software is typically implemented by PACER WARE message, upon 
MAJCOM A3 approval. If both mission data and operational flight program software are 
changed, they will be implemented together via time compliance technical order. However, 
when operational flight programs are changed in time critical circumstances (urgent or 
emergency) the program managers must coordinate with the reprogramming centers and 
release the time compliance technical order in conjunction with approved PACER WARE 
messages within MAJCOM directed timelines. (T-3). Upon approval to implement or 
release software for fielding, the software will be distributed to EW maintenance shops via 
the Multi-Service Data Distribution System. Installation instructions for mission data and 
mission data bundled with an operational flight program are typically in the form of a 
maintenance instruction message or embedded in a reprogramming impact message. 
Mission data only changes are not considered an aircraft or system modification as 
described in AFI 63-101/20-101; therefore an AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, is 
not required. If technical orders are impacted by mission data change (occurs if changes 
impact test or walk-around procedures), the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center 
(AFLCMC/WNY) or platform program manager will update the technical data and release 
the update in an interim operational supplement. 
1.2.4.4.  The MAJCOM or EW cell uses the reprogramming impact message, along with 
previous coordination with reprogramming centers, to determine whether to install the new 
software in their units' EW equipment and the priority used to implement the change. If the 
MAJCOM A3 (or designated authority) or EW cell decide to install the software, they 
authorize the installation using an implementation message (see PACER WARE Database 
Users Guide https://wwwmil.53wg.eglin.af.mil/pacerware ) 
12 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
1.2.4.5.  The implementation message is authorization, not direction, to load software. This 
message will also include timing criteria and notification instructions. The implementation 
message is also sent to the reprogramming centers to notify them of the status of the change. 
During emergency or high priority software changes, the unit can expect to receive the 
implementation message at nearly the same time as, or shortly after, the above messages. 
For routine changes, the timing of implementation message release may vary widely. 
MAJCOMs may choose to issue a standing implementation message that authorizes 
loading based on reprogramming impact message, maintenance instruction message or 
time compliance technical order messages. 
1.2.4.6.  After coordination with the joint EW cell command EW officer, joint force air 
component commander EW cell or air mobility division tactics section (for mobility air 
forces), the wing or group EW officer recommends software to load for the commander’s 
decision, as required. The MAJCOM, wing or group EW officer advises the commander 
who makes the final decision on which software to load. When directed by the appropriate 
authority, units load software reprogramming changes to combat coded aircraft. With wing 
commander (or designated representative) approval, units schedule and upload software 
changes on training and test coded aircraft as soon as possible, on a non-interference basis 
with programmed training and testing. 
1.2.4.7.  Unit Loading Message. Once units have installed the software or mission data in 
its EW systems, the unit will report this to its MAJCOM, EW cell, and the appropriate 
reprogramming centers using the unit loading message within 72 hours (3 duty days) of 
completion. (T-3). The unit loading message includes implementation status and issues 
affecting 100% aircraft upload (actual); or when the number of systems has been uploaded 
as instructed by the implementing authority (exercise). Instructions and contact 
information for unit loading message reporting are outlined in previous applicable PACER 
WARE messages. 
1.2.4.8.  Units report the following information to the MAJCOM, EW cell, reprogramming 
centers and other appropriate addressees. (T-3). Note: Actual addressees are normally 
identified by the MAJCOM in their implementation message for each software change; 
classification of unit loading messages is in accordance with individual system or aircraft 
classification guide; addressees for unit loading messages are normally provided by the 
implementation authority in the implementation message(s). Templates are located in 
EWIR_OPS_PW_MSG_Templates library on the Multi-Service Data Distribution System. 
1.2.4.8.1.  A synopsis of reprogramming changes, including start and stop times for 
each reprogramming action. (T-3). 
1.2.4.8.2.  Any problems a unit encountered. (T-3). 
1.2.4.8.3.  Any MAJCOM specific instructions. (T-3). 
1.2.4.9.  Status Message. The status message is sent by the reprogramming centers to the 
units, MAJCOMs, the EW cell, and any other interested parties, during periods of 
heightened activity or exercises. This message provides updates of current reprogramming 
actions, to include estimated time of completion. The reprogramming centers will send the 
status message every 72 hours, or as requested by the lead MAJCOM, throughout the 
period of activity or exercise. (T-3). 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021

1.2.4.10.  EWIR messages and data are normally sent in the order listed above. However, 
many factors can affect when an agency or unit receives these messages and in what order 
they are received. These factors include, but are not limited to, priority of the change(s), 
location of the originator, common-user messaging system traffic congestion, unit 
distribution policies, and whether or not the unit has Multi-Service Data Distribution 
System capability. 
1.3.  Timeliness of Reprogramming Actions.  All reprogramming (PACER WARE) messages 
will include either a “ROUTINE”, “URGENT” or “EMERGENCY” precedence in the subject 
line. (T-3). Recipients (service production centers, reprogramming centers, MAJCOMs and flying 
units) of reprogramming messages perform reprogramming actions, if required, based upon the 
precedence of the message. Note: Precedence may change if a crisis occurs, or ends, in the middle 
of specific reprogramming action. Use the following criteria when performing reprogramming 
actions: 
1.3.1.  EMERGENCY. Emergency changes, initiated during combat operations, will 
necessitate reprogramming centers conduct 24-hour operations, with the goal of having the 
reprogramming center release the required change within 24 hours after a required change has 
been validated, depending on the complexity of the change. (T-3). Flying units will 
immediately perform reprogramming actions as required by the reprogramming message. (T-
3). Flying unit commanders will determine if training or operational missions can or cannot be 
flown without reprogramming actions being performed. (T-3). Note: During all exercises, 
MAJCOM or Inspector General timelines are used to determine the flying unit’s success in 
meeting emergency timeliness. 
1.3.2.  URGENT. Typically accomplished during crisis periods, reprogramming centers and 
flying units will accomplish urgent changes during normal duty hours, but urgent changes will 
take precedence over other activities until complete. (T-3). After a required change has been 
validated, the reprogramming center’s goal is to release the required change and be received 
by flying units within 72 hours. However, acceptable timelines for urgent changes are 
negotiated between the applicable MAJCOM and reprogramming center, depending on the 
complexity of the change. 
1.3.3.  ROUTINE. Considered normal day-to-day operations. Flying units will schedule 
around the daily training or maintenance schedule. (T-3).  Note: A no-later-than date for 
completion will be given by the implementation authority. 
1.4.  Organizational Functions.  The following are those organizations with primary EWIR 
responsibilities within the DAF: 
1.4.1.  53d Electronic Warfare Group (53 EWG), 53d Wing, Eglin AFB, FL. The 53 EWG is

Chapter 4 
INTERNATIONAL EWIR PROGRAM 
4.1.  Purpose.  The International EWIR program supports building EW capacity for partner air 
forces. Its purpose is to foster interoperability for future coalitions and to strengthen partner 
countries’ defensive posture. This program provides acquisition, logistics, technical engineering, 
and system familiarization services to ensure the effectiveness of EW systems sold to partner 
nations. This support program is designed to provide for the standardization and reliability required 
to field effective EW systems. 
4.2.  Scope.  There are three basic areas of the international EWIR program: (1) international 
agreements; (2) foreign military sales cases; and (3) US government support for direct commercial 
sales. 
4.2.1.  International Agreements. Agreements, such as cooperative research or data exchange, 
joint development programs or joint exercises will require foreign military sales EWIR support 
to enhance or maintain their effectiveness between partners. In accordance with AFI 51-403, 
International Agreements, AF personnel must obtain written approval from a competent 
authority before initiating, negotiating, or concluding an international agreement. (T-0). See 
DoDI 5530.03, International Agreements, para 5.2.b.(6), for more information. 
4.2.2.  Foreign Military Sales Cases. The majority of international EWIR programs are 
accomplished using US Government contracts (foreign military sales cases). 
4.2.3.  US Government support to direct commercial sales programs will encompass EW 
management or oversight of EW sales by US industry. (T-3). EWIRDB support for direct 
commercial sales programs must be provided under a foreign military sales case. (T-3). 
4.3.  Approach.  The international EWIR program follows the AF EWIR process except for 
additional foreign disclosure reviews. Procedures and organizational responsibilities outlined in 
Chapter 2, and modified in this chapter form the basis for the international EWIR program. 
Hardware and software support shall mirror the AF support processes where feasible. International 
EWIR program support is developed in accordance with AF policies for security cooperation, 
foreign disclosure and technology transfer as well as specific foreign partner requirements set for 
in the terms of each foreign military sales case. The key administering agencies are the Foreign 
Disclosure Division (SAF/IAPD), the Weapons Division (SAF/IAPW), AF/A5L, ACC Security 
Assistance Branch (ACC/IAS), the Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation Directorate, 
and the Air Force Security Assistance Training Squadron. The foreign military sales EWIR 
implementing agencies are NASIC, AFLCMC/WNYI, and the 53 EWG. 
4.4.  Special Factors.  Transferring capabilities through international EWIR programs involves 
several factors. Program changes requiring supporting documentation, such as memoranda of 
understanding, foreign military sales cases, bilateral or multilateral agreements will require the 
purchaser’s agreement before the program can move forward. (T-0). The purchaser must fund the 
international EWIR program while EWIR activities, such as range testing, will be funded jointly 
through international agreements. (T-0). EWIRDB support requirements for mission data file 
development to support foreign military sales cases must be approved in principle as described in 
paragraph 4.9 before appropriate hardware or software sales are completed through foreign 
military sales or direct commercial sales programs. (T-0). 
42 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
4.5.  International EWIR Program Disclosure.  Transfer of US EW capabilities to international 
customers occur in accordance with applicable AF, DoD and national policies and procedures. EW 
military capabilities can include: deliverable hardware or software, technical orders, operating 
manuals, employment considerations, training, and databases for mission data file development, 
deliverable mission data, and applicable documentation (handbooks or annexes). 
4.6.  EW Systems Support. 
4.6.1.  US Systems: 
4.6.1.1.  Responsibility for mission data file development resides with 53 EWG, AMC/OL-
A, Det 1 492 SOW, and AFLCMC/WNYI. The 53 EWG will develop mission data files 
for fighters, bombers, and Airborne Warning and Control System platforms. (T-3). Det 1 
492 SOW is responsible for mission data file development for special operations forces 
and common EW systems on mobility air forces platforms. (T-3). AMC/OL-A will conduct 
overall software management of the ALR-69A and the KC-46 radio frequency self-defense 
system, the Tactical Situation Awareness System. (T-3). AFLCMC/WNYI will develop 
mission data files in accordance with memoranda of agreement with the 53 EWG or Det 1 
492 SOW. (T-3). Organizations responsible for developing mission data files shall 
coordinate with appropriate agencies for technical order development. (T-3). Under 
emergency or urgent reprogramming conditions, the responsible organization will 
coordinate a concurrent delivery with other applicable organizations. (T-3) Combatant 
commanders and the EW cell will be notified of all emergency reprogramming activities 
accomplished for nations in their respective area of responsibility. (T-3). 
4.6.1.2.  US EW systems installed on non-US platforms or integrated with other non-US 
systems are supported on a case-by-case basis. 
4.6.1.3.  The international EWIR program will support EW systems retired from the AF 
inventory to the maximum extent feasible based on available hardware, software and 
engineering expertise. 
4.6.1.4.  Mission data file development under direct commercial sales programs requires 
proper manpower, reprogramming tools, test support equipment, and database support. 
4.6.2.  Non-US Systems. EW systems of foreign origin are generally not supported. Contact 
SAF/IAPW for guidance on exceptions to this policy. 
4.7.  Functional Responsibilities.  These specific responsibilities are in addition to those found in 
Chapter 2 and cover the International EWIR program.

4.8.  Foreign Military Sales Policy.  SAF/IAPW and AF/A5L recommend policy changes and 
develop guidance and procedures for Secretariat, Air Staff, or Space Staff approval and 
incorporation into DAF instructions for the purpose of advocating and overseeing the export of 
US EW systems and system support. 
4.9.  Database Support for EW Reprogramming.  The EWIRDB support program is designed 
for EW systems sold through DoD Security Cooperation. This program provides appropriate data 
for all EW-related systems requiring intelligence-based information for mission data 
programming. Direct commercial sales programs will obtain this support, if required and approved, 
through a related foreign military sales case. Foreign EW systems are not supported under this 
program. 
4.9.1.  Foreign Military Sales vs. Direct Commercial Sales Support. EW database support is 
only provided through a foreign military sales case. SAF/IAPD and SAF/IAPW can assist 
countries to determine their data requirements, once a letter of offer and acceptance is signed. 
Of note, contractors cannot provide EWIRDB support. (T-0). Direct commercial sales licenses 
shall stipulate that if a country requires intelligence-related products for its EW system, the 
country will work with the SAF/IAR desk officer for guidance in possibly obtaining the 
required support through a foreign military sales case. (T-0). 
4.9.2.  Foreign Military Sales EWIRDB Products. There are two types of foreign military sales 
EWIRDB products. Depending on a country’s requirements and National Disclosure Policy, 
the EWIRDB release will either be direct or indirect. (T-0). SAF/IAPW manages, develops, 
orders production, and requests dissemination of approved components of the EWIRDB for 
DAF foreign military sales. (T-0). 
4.9.2.1.  Direct EWIRDB. The direct EWIRDB is a SECRET (REL XXX) product 
delivered "directly" to an international customer. This product is developed to meet 
requirements of an international customer that maintains an in-country reprogramming 
capability. It is only disseminated to countries approved by the US Government to 
accomplish in-country reprogramming on EW systems sold through foreign military sales 
or direct commercial sales. A direct commercial sales program that requires support for in-
country reprogramming activities must have an associated foreign military sales case to 
obtain the direct EWIRDB. 
4.9.2.2.  Indirect EWIRDB. The indirect EWIRDB is a SECRET NOFORN product 
distributed only to US EW programming facilities (US government and/or US contractor). 
Other releases will be staffed through appropriate government agencies. (T-0). 
4.9.3.  Database Release Authority. The US intelligence community and the military services 
maintain the contents of the EWIRDB and are the release authorities. SAF/IAPW coordinates 
EWIRDB specific customer requirements and obtains required intelligence community or 
military service approval for EWIRDB products. 
4.9.4.  Justification for Database Dissemination to International Customers. SAF/IAPW 
develops the required justification for the release of EWIRDB products based on a clear 
understanding of the purpose for the release of data. Advance notice of pending EW systems 
sales to SAF/IAPW is the most effective way to ensure required foreign military sales data 
products are developed, produced, and distributed to the appropriate EW reprogramming 
centers. 
46 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
4.9.4.1.  Direct Commercial Sales Program Justification. US Government intelligence-
based data products will be used only under a foreign military sales case to support EW 
system sales. (T-0). SAF/IAPW begins the development of a database support program for 
a specific country after a SAF/IA country desk officer develops the appropriate justification 
for such support and a foreign military sales case is established or an existing one is 
adjusted. To ensure support is available on a regular basis, SAF/IAPD is alerted to direct 
commercial sales licenses that offer EW-type systems. 
4.9.4.2.  Special Justification Requirements. Unless by exception, SAF/IAPD or 
SAF/IAPW will require additional information from a theater command staff or country 
team to justify establishing a country-specific database support program. (T-0). This 
special justification could apply to either a foreign military sales case or direct commercial 
sales license. Failure to gain the required justification from a theater command staff and 
country team will result in selective denial of database support for the foreign military sales 
or direct commercial sales program. This could result in a loss of EW system 
reprogramming data. 
4.9.5.  Database Support Development, Release Process for Foreign Military Sales and Direct 
Commercial Sales Programs. A development and release process is maintained to ensure that 
correct database products are developed, produced and disseminated to meet foreign military 
sales or direct commercial sales requirements. (T-0). The process is divided into three phases: 
Phase I – Release in Principle, Phase II – Development of Database Requirements; and Phase 
III – Release in Specific. (T-0). The phases are aligned with standard Letter of Offer and 
Acceptance (LOA) development for foreign military sales cases, but the phases can also be 
used to support Technical Assistance Agreement/DSP-5 for direct commercial sales programs. 
(T-0). 
4.9.5.1.  Phase I – Release in Principle. The Release in Principle is the first phase in 
development, production and dissemination of foreign military sales EW database products 
to meet stated EW system requirements. (T-0). An approved Release in Principle stipulates 
that some degree of support for the country's requirements will be available if and when a 
foreign military sales case is signed. (T-0). 
4.9.5.2.  Phase II – Development of Database Requirements. Upon official signature of the 
foreign military sales case, the second phase begins by accomplishing an analysis of the 
appropriate area of interest and developing a concise list of radar emitters for that area of 
interest. (T-0). This list will be SAF/IAPW's recommendation to country representatives 
during a technical coordination meeting. (T-0). If an adequate list is not developed during 
or shortly after the technical coordination meeting, there may be a delay in delivery of the 
database product to the EW reprogramming center. (T-0). After technical coordination 
meeting completion, the final radar emitter list will be validated against US Government 
disclosure guidelines prior to phase III initiation. (T-0). 
4.9.5.3.  Phase III – Release in Specific. The Release in Specific begins immediately after 
the final radar emitter list is validated. (T-0). This phase establishes a specific release 
authority from appropriate DoD organizations for parametric data on selected radar 
emitters. (T-0). SAF/IAPW directs production of the country-specific database once 
Release in Specific approval is received from appropriate DoD organization. (T-0). 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
47 
4.9.5.4.  Follow-on Data Support. The follow-on database support program complements 
initial database support and ensures regular updates of data for changing area of interest or 
requirements. In all cases, the process used, the funding required and the database provided 
will be the same, as long as guidance and funding is provided in a foreign military sales 
case. The preferred database support program would be defined as initial plus two follow-
on databases with 24-month intervals between the deliveries of the three products. 
4.10.  Communications. 
4.10.1.  Foreign military sales EWIR reprogramming centers will maintain a secure 
communications capability with US government personnel in country or direct to customer 
points of contact. (T-3) These links can provide the necessary connectivity for transmitting 
text and binary data between the reprogramming center and international customers. 
4.10.2.  Security of International Transmissions. DoD ensures the establishment of secure 
transmission channels for the physical transfer of documents, software and data. Electronic 
transmission is the desired method of transfer. US government personnel supporting 
international partners will receive and transmit reprogramming software and messages via the 
SIPRNet or secure communications equipment. 
4.11.  Foreign Military Sales EWIR Training and Exercise Support. 
4.11.1.  Foreign military sales EWIR operational and technical training and logistics support 
is provided from the following organizations: 
4.11.1.1.  SAF/IAPW provides familiarization on the overall foreign military sales EWIR 
process and its components. 
4.11.1.2.  53 EWG will provide mission data familiarization and operational considerations 
for international customer use of AF EW equipment. (T-3). 
4.11.1.3.  Det 1 492 SOW will provide mission data and operations considerations for 
systems similar to special operations forces and mobility air forces-configured EW 
equipment. (T-3). 
4.11.1.4.  AFLCMC/WNY will provide hardware and software familiarization support for 
assigned systems. (T-3). 
4.11.1.5.  ACC mobile training teams are available on request of the foreign government 
(non-interference basis) for in-country instruction on EW subjects, EW systems’ 
operations, and operational considerations. 
4.11.1.6.  SAF/IAPW, in conjunction with NASIC, provides EWIRDB training support. 
4.11.1.7.  DAF security assistance training develops and provides foreign military sales 
training plans.

Terms 
Block Cycle—In this process the reprogramming center receives software change requests from 
the user, and other change requests from organizations, which are associated with the software 
process. The reprogramming center evaluates these requests and identifies potential solutions. 
When the user determines that sufficient changes have been identified to justify the expense of an 
update, the reprogramming center implements the software changes. Changes are scheduled based 
on the criticality of the requirement, with routine updates generally occurring approximately every 
18 months for operational flight programs and mission data. 
BLUE—Term used to describe the platforms, systems or the electromagnetic characteristics of 
systems associated with US military users (see Attachment 3 for complete description). 
Characteristics and Performance Data—Developed from parametric data and detailed analysis 
of all-source intelligence, characteristics and performance data provide descriptive characteristics 
used to define the system, its capabilities, and its behaviors. Examples of characteristics and 
performance data include antenna patterns, radio frequency, electro-optical or infrared signatures, 
electromagnetic protection capabilities, and maximum detection range. 
All—source derived assessments of foreign military system capabilities and physical attributes. 
(DoDD 5250.01) 
 
 
52 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
Community On—Line Intelligence System for End-Users and Managers—The Defense 
Intelligence Agency (DIA) on-line production and requirements management system. It provides 
the mechanism for registering and validating requirements, deconflicting requirements, and 
assigning and scheduling production within production centers under the purview of DIA. It 
provides the ability to track and manage production activities across operational and national 
planners and consumers. Production requirements and requests for information are used in 
Community On-Line Intelligence System for End-Users and Managers to register the intelligence 
product or service requirement and to assign the requirement to the appropriate production 
center(s). 
Electromagnetic Environment—The resulting product of the power and time distribution, in 
various frequency ranges, of the radiated or conducted electromagnetic emission levels 
encountered by a military force, system, or platform when performing its assigned mission in its 
intended operational environment. 
Electromagnetic Warfare (EW)—Any military action involving the use of electromagnetic and 
directed energy (DE) to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy. The three 
major subdivisions within EW are: electromagnetic attack, electromagnetic protection, and 
electromagnetic warfare support. 
Electromagnetic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR)—The process that fully 
integrates operations, intelligence, communications, logistics, and other support functions to 
provide changes to reprogrammable electronic warfare equipment hardware and software, tactics, 
and equipment settings. EWIR gives the Department of the Air Force a clear and comprehensive 
picture of tasks, data, staffing, and the interrelationships between the agencies that reprogram EW 
equipment. This process forms the basis for developing Air Force procedures, organizations, 
facilities, and expertise to ensure responsive EW reprogramming during peacetime, wartime, and 
contingencies. 
Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming Data Base (EWIRDB)—The EWIRDB is a 
database that contains parametric and select characteristics and performance data describing EW 
systems. It is the primary source for mission and reprogramming data. It is the primary DoD 
approved source for technical parametric and performance data on non-communications electronic 
emitters and associated systems. Scientific and technical intelligence and other centers (including 
NASIC, National Ground Intelligence Center, National Maritime Intelligence Center, MSIC, 453 
EWS, 57 IS and NSA) provide the data to NASIC for inclusion in the database. The EWIRDB 
includes threat, neutral military, and friendly and commercial system mission data. 
EWIR Data—All-source derived data describing observed and assessed radio frequency 
parametric data. 
Fit Data—Information about the internal and external equipment associated with a particular 
platform. For example, knowledge of a specific grouping of aircraft avionics hardware and 
software and how the components work together, provides the avionics fit for that platform. 
Knowing the grouping (configuration) of the hardware and software helps to make the fit. 
Similarly, having knowledge of the different possible weapon, launcher or fuel tank load 
combinations on an aircraft contributes to the weapons fit for that platform. 
 
 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
53 
Flagging—The process of identifying emissions whose parameters are outside of prescribed 
limits. There are two methods: parametric-based flagging or model-based flagging. Parametric- 
based flagging consists of comparing observed parametric data to the database of known emitter 
parameters. Model-based flagging consists of using software-based models to analyze an EW 
system’s response to observed parametric data. 453 EWS maintains automated flagging tools for 
both methods. 
GRAY—Term used to describe the platforms, systems or the electromagnetic characteristics of 
systems associated with non-US, non-hostile military users (see Attachment 3 for complete 
description). Examples: 
Countries or coalitions traditionally identified as US allies (UK, CAN, AUS, NATO, 
etc.). Countries or coalitions identified as neutral or unknown in their alliance with 
US. US systems sold to other countries through foreign military sales or similar 
processes. Different organizations may be assigned different parts of GRAY to 
comply with existing laws and DoD, joint or service policies. 
Implementation Message—MAJCOM, joint forces air and space component commander, 
combined forces air and space component commander, or air operations center approval to load a 
change that the reprogramming centers have made to electromagnetic warfare systems and sent to 
the units. 
Intelligence Community—The term "intelligence community" includes the following: 
(A) The Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
(B) The Central Intelligence Agency. 
(C) The National Security Agency. 
(D) The Defense Intelligence Agency. 
(E) The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. 
(F) The National Reconnaissance Office. 
(G) Other offices within the Department of Defense for the collection of specialized national 
intelligence through reconnaissance programs. 
(H) The intelligence elements of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast 
Guard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the 
Department of Energy. 
(I) The Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the Department of State. 
(J) The Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of the Treasury. 
(K) The Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security. 
(L) Such other elements of any department or agency as may be designated by the President, or 
designated jointly by the Director of National Intelligence and the head of the department or 
agency concerned, as an element of the intelligence community. 
International Agreement—As used in this instruction, the term International Agreement has the 
same meaning as defined in Attachment 1 of AFI 51-403. 
 
 
54 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
Mission Data—Elements or files a processor employs to perform signal discrimination, threat 
warning, target a threat, or elicit countermeasure responses, such as jamming or expendables, 
which are selectable, adaptable, or changeable by the using command with the exception being 
foreign military sales customers. Mission data is also called emitter identification data, mission 
data file, pre-flight message, code form message, or other related names that vary in function 
according to the system using them. 
Missionware—A combination of software applications and tailored mission data intended to 
generate effects within a given mission or series of missions. Missionware possesses properties of 
both traditional mission data and OFPs.  For example, Mission data supporting MW may be written 
in various languages and consist of diverse data sets. Some data sets may be specific to a given 
application and some may be shared across different applications. It may be applied across multiple 
hardware sets and is not tightly tied to any one particular hardware system at the pre-mission 
planning level although it may require manipulation at some point to account and correct for 
unique RF chain configurations and sensitivities. 
Multi-Service Data Distribution System—The Multi-Service Data Distribution System is a 
means of transmitting digital data and EWIR message traffic to operational locations. Normally, 
data and messages are available on the Multi-Service Data Distribution System almost 
simultaneously with their transmission over SIPRNet. The Multi-Service Data Distribution System 
uses secure communications equipment to transmit digital data, via commercial or Defense Switch 
Network voice lines, or SIPRNet, from reprogramming centers directly to operational locations 
which possess like equipment and appropriate communications software. Since the Multi-Service 
Data Distribution System is a "pull" system, units must be notified by message or telephone that 
new mission data software has been loaded on the Multi-Service Data Distribution System. (T-3). 
The Multi-Service Data Distribution System provides a backup for the transmission of 
reprogramming data and EWIR message traffic. 
National SIGINT Requirements Process—An integrated system of policies, priorities, 
procedures and technology used by the intelligence community to manage requests for national 
level SIGINT products and services. SIGINT collectors satisfy tactical through national level 
consumer information needs based on national SIGINT requirements process guidance. 
Information need statements are used in the national SIGINT requirements process to relay 
collection requirements to SIGINT collectors. 
Operational Change Request—A formal request to the appropriate major command and support 
command facilities that identifies the inability of an electromagnetic warfare system to meet 
operational requirements. In emergencies, an operational change request identifies the inability to 
discriminate or respond to a threat and then requests mission data or operational flight program 
changes to correct the problem. 
Operational Flight Program—The executable program resident in computer-controlled 
electromagnetic warfare systems that contains the algorithms that receive, identify, process, and 
do jamming tasks. This program does not contain any threat-specific data, and operational 
commands cannot change the program. The reprogramming centers send a software change 
message to Air Force Materiel Command to get an operational flight program modified.

Operational Reconnaissance (OPS RECCE)—A tactic to deliberately leverage sensor 
capabilities on primarily strike aircraft to increase battlespace awareness and lethality beyond 
those for which the sensors were originally intended. Source: Annex 2-0, Global Integrated 
Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance Operations, Appendix C Multi-Role Aircraft with an 
ISR Mission, 29 Jan 2015. 
 
PACER WARE—The term for actual electromagnetic warfare system changes issued during 
peacetime, contingencies, or wartime operations. PACER WARE actions can be at the routine, 
urgent, or emergency level as required. 
PACER WARE Database—53 EWG, working with Det 1 492 SOW Reprogramming Center, 
developed a secure unclassified website to manage and distribute AF PACER WARE 
information. This common access card-enabled database acts as a focal point for all AF EWIR 
unit account information and message release data. Accessible 24/7 by users worldwide, the 
PACER WARE Database provides a backup to other EWIR communication channels. This 
system ensures units receive critical updates when SIPRNet channels are unavailable. The 
database may be accessed at: Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. 
PACER WARE Messages—PACER WARE messages templates and procedures (operational 
change request, system impact message, reprogramming impact message, maintenance 
instruction message, time compliance technical order, implementation message, system change 
message, and unit loading message) are located on the classified Multi-Service Data Distribution 
System (EWIR_OPS_PW_MSG_Templates library) and unclassified PACER WARE database at 
Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.  
Parametric Data—Directly measurable factors, such as frequency, pulse width, or polarization 
that help to define a system or waveform and determine its behavior. They are data elements that 
describe specific properties and timing. Some parametric data are expressed as a mean value, or 
range of values. 
Rapid Reprogramming—The term used to describe the method to reprogram EW systems in a 
time sensitive manner. 
RED— Term used to describe the platforms, systems or the electromagnetic characteristics of 
systems associated with hostile (non-US) users (see Attachment 3 for complete description).

DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
Reprogramming—Changes made to EW system software, such as mission data file or 
operational flight program changes which alter programmed look-up tables, threat libraries, or 
signal-sorting routines; hardware, such as long-term system modifications; or tactics, such as 
procedures, equipment settings, or EW mission planning data changes.  These changes are made 
to enable an operational commander to respond to changes in enemy threat systems, tailor 
equipment to meet unique theater requirements, and to adjust to changing mission requirements. 
Reprogramming Center—A term used to refer to centers which plan, design, test, and field 
updates to mission data and operational flight programs. Operational reprogramming centers are 
responsible for mission data while Support reprogramming centers are responsible for 
operational flight programs. 
Security Assistance Program—A program designed to provide assistance, such as training, 
weapons, or hardware to a foreign government for furthering the US national security strategy. 
SERENE BYTE—The nomenclature for exercising Air Force electromagnetic warfare system 
changes. 
Service Production Center—Organizations responsible for updating and maintaining assigned 
emitters in EWIRDB. Emitter assignments are based primarily on areas of expertise. Service 
production centers provide system-specific technical information to theater intelligence centers 
and reprogramming centers. The following are the service production centers: National Ground 
Intelligence Center; Office of Naval Intelligence; Marine Corps Intelligence Activity; National 
Air and Space Intelligence Center; and 57th Intelligence Squadron. 
Signature—A distinctive characteristic or set of characteristics that consistently recurs and 
identifies a piece of equipment, material, activity, individual, or event, such as a radio 
frequency or acoustic characteristics. 
Software Validation—Integration, testing, and evaluation performed at the system or 
subsystem level to ensure the final program satisfies system specifications and user or 
supporting command requirements. 
Specific Emitter Identification—A method to unambiguously identify a particular emitter or 
class of emitters by exploiting unintentional or unique features of the emitter signal. 
Threat Change Messaging Portal—A SIPRNet-based software portal used for the purpose of 
facilitating the threat change validation process. This portal permits threat change validation 
request submittal from reprogramming centers of all military services and threat change 
validation message replies from participating service production centers, scientific and 
technical intelligence centers, information warfare centers, service components, and observed 
signal centers. When operational, the portal is the preferred messaging system for threat change 
validation request or other message traffic. When non-operational, legacy threat change 
validation request or other message traffic system and methods apply. The EWIRDB Program 
Management Office at DIA MSIC maintains this portal. The threat change messaging portal is 
located at http://www.msic.dia.smil.mil/tcmp. 
Threat Change Validation—An EWIR intelligence community process for providing 
validation assessments on suspected EW threat changes to the reprogramming centers so that a 
valid reprogramming decision can be made.

Verification—Process of comparing two levels of an information system specification for 
proper correspondence, such as a security policy model with top-secret specification, a top-level 
specification with source code, or source code with object code. 
WHITE— Term used to describe the platforms, systems or the electromagnetic characteristics 
of systems associated with non-military, non-hostile users (see Attachment 3 for complete 
description).

EWIR DATA TYPES 
A3.1.  Data Types.  An effective EWIR process requires accurate signal and system information, 
not all of which can be actively collected or processed by a single organization. Over many years 
US laws, policies, and DoD, joint and service guidance have created divisions of authority and 
responsibility, leading to the development of several data types, or colors (RED, GRAY, BLUE, 
WHITE), with different communities (operations, acquisition, intelligence) responsible for 
different colors. To ensure that the DAF EWIR process obtains and disseminates all required 
information, Table A3.1 defines the different data colors.  NOTE:  The type and color terms are 
for planning, development and resource allocation purposes only--what is WHITE today may 
become RED if hostile forces employ a commercially available system. Systems may have more 
than one color. For example, if a currently fielded BLUE military system is sold to a GRAY 
country but then political circumstances change and that country employs that system in a hostile 
manner, that system is now both BLUE and RED. Differences in configuration will likely still 
exist between the BLUE and RED version even though they are the same basic system. Also, the 
US military may use the same commercial (WHITE) system a hostile user (RED) employs. If the 
US military is a user, those systems are BLUE, the hostile used systems are RED and if there are 
commercial users those systems are WHITE.

Table A3.1.  EWIR Color Codes. 
 
TERM 
DEFINITION 
Color 
Code User 
Code 
Indicates the general user category of a related set of entities or objects. 
Can apply to a set of platoons, a set of platforms, or a set of sensor 
systems.  The current codes are RED, BLUE, GRAY, and WHITE. 
RED 
Associated with hostile (non-US) users. 
BLUE 
Associated with US military users. 
GRAY 
Associated with non-US, non-hostile military users. Examples: 
Countries or coalitions traditionally identified as US allies (UK, 
CAN, AUS, NATO, etc.). 
Countries or coalitions identified as “neutral” or “unknown” in 
their alliance with US. 
US systems sold to other countries through foreign military sales or 
similar processes. 
Literally, a “gray” area, where rules, responsibilities, and collection 
authorities require significant attention to law and policy detail. 
Different organizations may be assigned different parts of GRAY to 
comply with existing laws and DoD, joint or service policies. 
WHITE 
Associated with non-military, non-hostile users. 
Note: US Government systems that do not fall under the US Military, such as Drug 
Enforcement Agency systems are considered as WHITE. 
Note: Can be divided into US-WHITE and NON-US-WHITE if needed. 
Table A3.2.  EWIR User Codes. 
TERM (User Code) DEFINITION 
US Military 
US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, US Space Force, US Marine 
Corps, and US Coast Guard. 
Non-US Military 
Any military service that is not organized under the US Government. 
Hostile Users 
Non-US users treated as threatening to US sovereignty or US people. 
Note: No US users are treated as hostile. 
Non-hostile Users 
US or Non-US users treated as non-threatening to US sovereignty 
or people.

Table A3.3.  EWIR Data Types and Colors. 
 
A3.2.  Data Color Example.  Assume the XYZ system is used by US and Country X military 
forces. Country X is non-US + non-hostile. Overall, the XYZ system can be described as 
BLUE+GRAY.  That is, there are BLUE XYZ systems and GRAY XYZ systems, which may not 
be identical. The EWIR organization(s) responsible for BLUE data would be responsible for the 
BLUE version of XYZ; the EWIR organization(s) responsible for GRAY data would be 
responsible for the GRAY version of XYZ. To the maximum extent possible, the BLUE and 
GRAY organizations would collaborate to share or compare data across the versions of the XYZ 
system. Each organization would ensure that each data set is updated over time as the system(s) 
are changed or upgraded. 
A3.3.  Data Color Designation and Assignment.  Much of the information required for the DAF 
EWIR process is based on the work of the intelligence community, which has established lanes in 
the road for assigning (primarily RED) systems to various production centers. For other systems 
not explicitly assigned within the intelligence community (primarily BLUE, GRAY or WHITE), 
AF/A5L will coordinate with AF/A2/6, NSA, DIA, 57 IS, NASIC, and other organizations to 
ensure all required systems are assigned a data OPR consistent with current guidance and 
organization missions. In general: 
A3.3.1.  RED systems are assigned to appropriate production centers for collection and 
analysis, with refinement or validation of data made by other supporting EWIR organizations. 
A3.3.2.  BLUE system, aircraft signature and antenna pattern data are generated and updated 
by operations, program offices (in association with the system vendors), and the 57 IS for 
addition to US Electromagnetic Systems and Blue Airborne Target Signatures databases, as 
applicable. BLUE data can then be merged into EWIRDB. 
A3.3.3.  GRAY systems and data issues must be handled on a case-by-case basis. (T-3). 
Options include: 
A3.3.3.1.  Countries or coalitions traditionally identified as US allies may voluntarily 
provide information to support the EWIR process. Information can then be added directly 
into EWIRDB, or merged from other EWIR-related databases. 
A3.3.3.2.  Countries or coalitions identified as “neutral” or “unknown” in their alliance 
with the US may be assigned to appropriate production centers for collection and analysis, 
with refinement or validation of data made by other supporting EWIR organizations. 
 
 
DAFMAN10-703  2 JUNE 2021 
63 
A3.3.3.3.  GRAY data for US systems being sold to other countries (through foreign 
military sales or similar processes) are generated by the program office (in association with 
the system vendor) and provided to 57 IS before the system leaves US control. Once the 
foreign military sales system is outside of US control, system data and update 
responsibilities may be transferred to a production center, as applicable. 
A3.3.4.  WHITE data must also be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. (T-3). Information may 
be provided by or purchased from the commercial vendor(s), or system may be assigned to 
appropriate production centers for collection and analysis, with refinement or validation of 
data made by other supporting EWIR organizations in accordance with intelligence oversight 
guidance. Information can then be added directly into EWIRDB, or merged from other EWIR-
related databases.
