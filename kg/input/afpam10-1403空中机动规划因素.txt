This pamphlet provides broad air mobility planning factors for peacetime and wartime 
operations. It is designed to help service, joint, and combined planners make gross estimates 
about mobility requirements in the early stages of the planning process.  It covers strategic airlift, 
deployment and employment air refueling, and aeromedical evacuation.  The use of detailed 
computer simulation models is encouraged for extensive calculations.  For greater detail, or in-
depth mobility analysis, contact Headquarters Air Mobility Command (AMC)/A9 at DSN 770-
7769/5165 or 18 AF/A5 at DSN 779-7842.  Refer recommended changes and questions about 
this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility via Air Force Form 847, 
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route Air Force Forms 847 from the field through 
the appropriate functional’s chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
 
Air mobility planning data contained within the tables of this document, including but not 
limited to aeromedical evacuation data, aircraft payload, ground times, primary mission aircraft 
inventory, airfield throughput, fuel burn rates, and new Maximum [aircraft] On Ground (MOG) 
terms, has been substantially revised and should be completely reviewed for impacts on existing 
plans.  Commercial, Contract and Civil Reserve Air Fleet aircraft data are no longer in this 
pamphlet.  The following tables are added, Table 12, “KC-46 Tanker Aircraft Required;” Table 
16, “Planning Sortie and Hour Limits for a typical KC-10 Unit;” and Table 17, “Planning Sortie 
and Hour Limits for a typical KC-135 Unit.”

Section A - Mobility Planning 
 
1.0.  How To Use This Pamphlet 
 
There are four basic parts to this pamphlet:  formulas (airlift/air refueling/aeromedical 
evacuation), examples, tables, and terms and definitions.  Although each of these parts can be 
used individually, we recommend you review the entire contents to get a full understanding of 
the planning process.  All references contained herein are to provide high-level airlift planning 
estimates over large air mobility operations.  Due to the number of variables involved, they are 
not universally applicable, especially to actual individual operational missions.  For guidance on 
current operational planning to include aircraft Allowable Cabin Load's and ground times, please 
contact the 618th AOC (TACC).  This pamphlet addresses only objective planning computations.  
It does not provide guidance concerning other factors, such as environmental and tactical 
considerations, that can impact the mobility operation.

Note:  For major wartime operations, recommend planners use the wartime objective surge 
utilization rate published in Table 6.  For non-mobilized contingencies, recommend the 
contingency utilization rate published in Table 6.  Utilization rate computations are extensive and 
not necessary for initial gross planning estimates.

Note:  This formula is preferred for contingency planning, because it accurately relates the 
variables affecting the deployment of requirements.

1,000,000
  
Note:  Although planners do not commonly use this formula, occasionally the conversion of 
short ton figures into Million Ton-Miles per Day is required.  AMC force structure programmers 
use Million Ton-Miles per Day when funding out-year aircraft purchases and many civilian 
agencies are accustomed to visualizing AMC fleet capability in terms of Million Ton-Miles per 
Day.  Fleet Capacity is generally more optimistic than actual Fleet Capability for a particular 
contingency.

Section C—Air Refueling Formulas 
 
1.0.  Air Refueling Overview 
Refer to Table 16 and Table 17 for determining employment factors including estimated fleet 
size and capacity.  Tankers can support air refueling as well as airlift requirements, depending on 
resources available and mission considerations.  Tanker planning tables are constructed using 
average/historical data and calculations from the example formulas.  Tables provide gross 
estimate of tanker fleet required to support operations.  If actual mission specifics and data are

known, such as aircraft model, configuration, air refueling altitude, airspeed, tanker basing, etc., 
using the formulas below will provide more accurate planning estimates.  However, these 
formulas should be adjusted for specific mission considerations for each aircraft type from each 
operating location.  When feasible, planning should be done by tanker planning experts, using 
vetted flight planning tools and procedures.

operations.  Specific aircraft gross weights, atmospheric conditions, and flight profiles will 
impact these planning calculations.  These numbers serve as initial estimates for planning, and 
need to be vetted by unit-level planning.

Refer to AFI 11-2AE Volume 3, Addenda A, Aeromedical Evacuation Operations 
Configuration/Mission Planning for detailed aircraft specific configuration and mission 
planning.  Use the following formulas and data in Table 15 to determine the aeromedical 
evacuation force and capabilities.  In the near term, aeromedical evacuation will be primarily 
accomplished using, C-17, C-130, KC-46, or KC-135 aircraft.  Opportune airlift may be used, 
keeping the best interest of the patient and crew in mind.

Section E—Examples 
 
1.0.  Airlift Example.  As an example of how to use the formulas and planning factors in this 
pamphlet, assume the following scenario.  The 10th Mountain Division out of Ft. Drum, NY, is 
to deploy to Kathmandu, Nepal, at the foot of the Himalayas, to assist in earthquake relief.  The 
requirement is to move 800 short tons of cargo via C-17s. 
Note:  Civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s 
fleet.  Planners should reference AMC/A3B, Civil Reserve Air Fleet Capability link, on the Air 
Force Portal for the latest commercial, contract, and Civil Reserve Air Fleet aircraft capabilities.  
A common access card is required to access the Air Force Portal.  Planners can also reference 
Air Mobility Command Instruction 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet and Air Mobility Command 
Pamphlet 24-2, Volume 1, Civil Reserve Air Fleet Load Planning, for civilian aircraft 
capabilities.  The following examples use International Civil Aviation Organization codes, which 
are four-character alphanumeric codes designating each airport around the world and commonly 
used in flight planning. 
1.1.  Suitable Airfield. 
Referring to the Aircraft Airfield Restrictions (Table 1), we see that the C-17 requires a 
minimum of 3,500 feet of runway for landing. 
Since the airfield at Ft. Drum, Wheeler-Sack AAF, has a runway length of 10,000 feet, it meets 
the C-17 requirements (this assumes adequate runway width). 
Note:  Refer to the Headquarters AMC Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report or the airfield 
detail assessment in AMC‘s Global Decision Support System to determine suitability for 
8 
  AFPAM10-1403  24 OCTOBER 2018 
 
mobility aircraft (C-5, C-17, C-20, C-21, C-32, C-37, C-40, C-130, KC-10, KC-46, and KC-
135).  If the airfield does not appear in the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report/airfield 
detail, contact AMC/A3AS and request the airfield be evaluated and added to the database 
(Airfield.Helpdesk@us.af.mil).  AMC/A3AS will provide prompt feedback and include 
suitability information in future editions of the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report and 
GDSS airfield detail. 
Looking in the Kathmandu area, we find Tribhuvan International Airport (VNKT) in Kathmandu 
to have 10,121 feet of runway which, along with the associated taxiways and ramp, is stressed 
for C-17 aircraft.  Therefore, make initial plans based on using Wheeler Sack AAF (KGTB) as 
the onload and Tribhuvan International as the offload. 
1.2.  Missions Required.  The example will address only the cargo requirement, however 
passenger movement would be handled in a similar manner.  For all examples to follow, assume 
15 C-17s apportioned for use and crew staging will be utilized where necessary.

1.3.  Time to Arrival.  The time required for cargo/ passengers to arrive at the offload location 
including all en route ground times.  For this example, the C-17s will depart McGuire (KWRI), 
fly to Wheeler Sack AAF for onload, then en route stop at Rota (LERT), Dhahran (OEDR), 
Delhi (VIDP), and then offload at Tribhuvan. Refer to definitions and tables as needed.

Note:  First leg from McGuire to Wheeler Sack is inactive as it‘s a positioning leg.  Block speeds 
were interpolated from Table 4. 
 
(Referring to Table 5) 
𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑒 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 = 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒1 + 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 2 + 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒3 + ⋯  
= 2.25 + 2.25 + 2.25 = 6.75 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠  
Time to Arrival = 19.8 + 6.75 = 26.55 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠 
1.4.  Cycle Time.  For this example, round trip flying time and round trip ground time were 
calculated using reverse routing except the last leg will be from Rota (LERT) to McGuire.  Refer 
to definitions for Round Trip Flying Time and Round Trip Ground Time. 
Cycle Time = round trip flying time + round trip ground time

   = 
(45) 𝑥 (15) 𝑥 (12.5)
(40.4)
  =  208.8 Short Tons/day 
 
2.0.  Airfield Throughput Capability.  It is necessary to look at the throughput capability of all 
airfields associated with a deployment to determine whether any one airfield limits a planned 
operation.  However, for initial planning, the en route locations may be assumed to have a higher 
throughput capability than the onload and offload locations.  Note:  Throughput is based on 
capability, but this doesn’t constitute a guarantee.  Also, airfields have competing interests based 
on their other customers.  MOG should be expressed in two exclusive numbers, wide-body (C-17 
equivalent) MOG and narrow-body (C-130 equivalent) MOG. 
2.1.  For this example, Tribhuvan International has a working MOG of one wide body aircraft. 
Airfield Throughput Capability (e.g., Tribhuvan) 
   =
[(𝑤𝑀𝑂𝐺) 𝑜𝑟  (𝑝𝑀𝑂𝐺) 𝑜𝑟 (𝑓𝑀𝑂𝐺)] 𝑥 (𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑) 𝑥 (𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠)
(𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒)
 𝑋 (85% 𝑄𝑢𝑒𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦) 
   = 
(1)(45 𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝑇𝑜𝑛𝑠)(24)
3.25
 𝑋 (85% 𝑄𝑢𝑒𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦) = 282.5 Short Tons/day (Refer to Table 8) 
Note:  Since the arrival airfield can handle the estimated fleet capability that will be delivered, 
this calculation is complete.  If the fleet capability had exceeded the airfield‘s throughput, either 
the flow would need to be slowed to compensate or the airfield’s resources increased to handle 
the airflow. 
 
3.0.  Air Refueling Example.  For this example, assume 6 F-15C’s need to deploy from Langley 
(KLFI) to Spangdahlem (ETAD). How much fuel and how many tankers (KC-135R) are 
required?  Note:  For this example average/historical figures were used.  Actual numbers would 
vary according to aircraft model, configuration, altitude, airspeed, etc. 
3.1.  Onload Required (per receiver) 
= [(
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒
𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝐴𝑖𝑟 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑)  𝑥 (𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤)] − (𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙) + (𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠)  
Note:  Use true airspeed in Table 4 for mobility aircraft or applicable flight manual airspeeds for 
other aircraft. 
3.2.  Destination Reserves = required fuel reserves at destination 
= (3500/480 x 10,822) − 23,000 +  7500 
=  63,410 lbs (per receiver) x 6 =  380,462 lbs 
3.3.  Offload Available (per tanker) 
 = (𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙) − [(𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒/𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝐴𝑖𝑟 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑)  𝑥 (𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤)] − (𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠)  =
(180,000) − [(3500/480)  𝑥 (10,718)] − (30,000)

NOTES: 
1.  Refer to Department of Defense Flight Information Handbook for an airfield’s specific 
Pavement Classification Number and subgrade as well as additional aircraft Aircraft 
Classification Number.  
Table 1 reflects values for the aircraft’s empty weight and the aircraft’s maximum take-off/taxi 
weight.  Note:  Pavement Subgrades in Global Decision Support System airfield detail are not 
classified as high, med, low, or ultra-low and come in an alpha/numeric format to be decoded.  
The AMC Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report provides specific guidance and is an 
available source for decoding that format.  Calculations using the Aircraft Classification 
Number/Pavement Classification Number website https://transportation.wes.army.mil/acnpcn/ 
are not considered official for AMC, but rather values listed in Global Decision Support 
System Airfield Detail (Giant Report) are to be used for mission planning. 
2.  AMC mission planners will refer to the weight bearing information in the Airfield Suitability 
and Restrictions Report or Global Decision Support System airfield detail for specific 
runway Pavement Classification Number values (if available).  The Global Decision Support 
System also provides weight bearing capacity information when pavement strength is reported in 
terms other than Aircraft Classification Number or Pavement Classification Number, and 
translates raw weight bearing capacity into aircraft gross weight limits.  Planners can contact the 
AMC Airfield Help Desk (Airfield.Helpdesk@us.af.mil) for assistance regarding weight bearing 
capacity information in the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report or Global Decision 
Support System/airfield detail. Mobility aircraft planners will use only the weight bearing 
information figures published in the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report and Global 
Decision Support System/airfield detail. 
3.  For the latest commercial, contract, and  Civil Reserve Air Fleet aircraft data go to the Air 
Force Portal, select AMC/A3B, and click on the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Capability link.  
Common Access Card and Air Force Portal access required. 
4.  Headquarters AMC/A3 retains runway criteria waiver authority for AMC organic aircraft. 
5.  See aircraft manuals for required tire pressure under specific conditions.

1.  Wingtip clearance: 10 feet on each side with wing walker, 25 feet each side without wing walker.  
2.  Refer to Department of Defense Flight Information Publication (En route Supplement) for an 
airfield‘s maximum runway load bearing capability expressed as a maximum aircraft weight for a 
particular landing gear type.  Additionally, the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report and 
Global Decision Support System/airfield detail provide maximum runway/taxiway/parking apron 
load bearing capability information for AMC aircraft by landing gear type. 
3.  Width required is for landing gear only and does not include the wingspan footprint required for a 
180° turn. 
4.  C-17 parking spot equivalent calculation = (aircraft length x aircraft width)/(C-17 length x C-17 
width). 
5.  The C-17 minimum width for a star-turn is 90 feet (can be done in 80 feet, but 90 feet is the 
minimum runway width for landing).

NOTES: 
1.  The maximum allowable cabin load can be used for planning with concurrence of 618 AOC (TACC) 
Mission Planners, Flight Managers, or Combatant Commander's Air Operations Center/Air Mobility 
Division in conjunction with detailed mission information (critical mission leg, winds, weather, terrain 
clearance, runway limitations, and diplomatic clearance).  For cargo load planning, verify size and 
dimensions and input data into Integrated Computerized Deployment System for an accurate load plan. 
2.  Key Assumptions: Standard day, no wind, sea level, dry runway, zero obstacles, sufficient runway 
length 
3.  Weight expressed in Short Tons.

NOTES: 
1.  Times are estimated based on average cargo/fuel loads.  Where possible, planners should deviate from 
these times to account for known factors such as amount and/or complexity of cargo, amount of fuel upload, 
and/or airfield capability limitations. 
2.  Times are based on minimum post-flight duties.  Planners must account for additional ground time to 
account for cargo operations performed upon arrival, if necessary. 
3.  Onload or offload operations only. Does not include refuel or reconfiguration operations. 
4.  Times assume an 80% commit rate for sustained operations. 
5.  KC-135 times apply to roller-equipped aircraft. 
6.  Add 2 hours for KC-135 configuration changes. 
7.  When cargo is required add 1+15 to minimum crew rest time.

NOTES:  
1.  Productivity Factors published above reflect average values for broad planning applications.  The 
values above assume average non-productive positioning legs (home station to onload, and offload to 
recovery) of 250nm for tactical missions and 500nm for strategic missions. 
2.  A more accurate scenario specific productivity factor can be approximated with the equation:  
Productivity = (onload to offload distance)/(round trip cycle distance).

NOTES: 
1.  Standard Atmospheric Conditions with winds 270/50. 
2.  Cruise altitude and temperature at cruise will impact fuel burn rates, and will reduce available offload. 
3.  All KC-10, KC-46, and a limited number of KC-135 aircraft are air refuelable, providing increased 
range, off-load, and loiter capabilities. 
4.  Takeoff fuel will vary by runway available and atmospheric conditions. 
5.  Cargo carried will reduce fuel load on a 1:1 basis. 
6.  Offload data based on 1-hour orbit time at 440T (315C). 
7.  Orbit times greater than 1 hour may be required to complete offload of all available fuel.

Terms 
Active route flying time—The flying time from onload to the offload location including all 
intermediate locations en route.  This does not include ground time. 
Active route ground time—The cumulative ground time of all intermediate stops from the 
onload location to the offload location.  This does not include flying time. 
Aeromedical Evacuation Patients— 
Litter = Patient may require a litter to be enplaned or deplaned.   
Ambulatory = Patient does not require assistance to be enplaned or deplaned. 
Air cargo—Stores, equipment or vehicles, which do not form part of the aircraft, and are part 
or all of its payload.  Note:  There are different classifications of military cargo, categorized as 
follows: 
 
Bulk air cargo, including the 463L pallet itself, which is within the usable dimensions of 
a 463L pallet (104” x 84” x 96”) and within the height and width requirements established by 
the cargo envelope of the particular model of aircraft. 
 
Oversize cargo exceeding the usable dimensions of a 463L pallet loaded to the design 
height of 96” but is equal to or less than 1,090” in length, 117” in width, and 105” in height. 
This cargo is transportable on the C-5, C-17, C-130, and to a limited extent the KC-10. 
 
Outsize cargo which exceeds the dimension of oversize (1,090” x 117” x 105”) and 
requires use of a C-5 or C-17.  Rolling Stock Equipment that can be driven or rolled directly 
into the cargo compartment. 
 
Special Items cargo requiring specialized preparation and handling procedures, such as 
space satellites or nuclear weapons. 
Aircraft block speed—True airspeed in knots under zero wind conditions adjusted in relation 
to length of sortie to compensate for takeoff, climb out, descent, instrument approach, and 
landing. 
Aircraft Mission Capability Rate—The average percentage of a fleet that is either Partially 
Mission Capable or Fully Mission Capable over the expected plan period.  This represents the 
maintenance reliability for the entire fleet, and does not directly correlate to task rates. 
Aircraft parking size—The ramp space a particular aircraft occupies, usually expressed in C- 
17 equivalents (See Table 2). 
Aircraft Task Rate—The rate at which a specific fleet is tasked, after rounding is applied.  
Task Rates should normally stay below Mission Capability Rates for sustained operations.  
Sustained operations are typically tasked at lower rates than short-duration contingency support 
rates and surge operations. 
Aircrew Commitment Rate—This is the average rate crews can be committed to missions for 
planning purposes.  This commitment rate takes factors such as aircrew Duties Not Including 
Flying rate, circadian rhythm, and mission sequencing into account.  A typical historical 
commitment rate for aircrew is 90%.   
 
  AFPAM10-1403  24 OCTOBER 2018 
27 
 
Aircrew Hours (100%)—This is the average number of hours each crew is expected to accrue 
over the course of a 30-day flying period.  The examples below assume down-time and alert 
periods are shared equally across the crew force.  Actual aircrew hours must be monitored by 
the individual flying units and communicated to the Operational planners when issues arise. 
Aircrew Monthly Hour Restriction—This is the total number of flight hours an aircrew can 
fly in a given 30-day period.  This restriction may be waived to a higher number by the 
appropriate command authority.  Typical flight hour limit for deployed aircrew is 150 hours per 
30 days. 
Airfield detail assessment—Contained in GDSS establishes suitability and restrictions for 
AMC and AMC-gained C-5, KC-10, C-17, C-20, C-21, C-32, C-37, C-40, KC-46, C-130, and 
KC-135 aircraft operations. 
Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report—AMC/A3 periodic publication available on 
line that contains AMC policy and guidance regarding airfield suitability and a synopsis of 
suitability for airfields AMC operates at globally. 
Airfield throughput capability—The amount of passengers or cargo that can be moved 
through the airfield per day via strategic airlift based on the limitations of the airfield (such as 
parking spots).  
Airframe Hours (per plan period)—This is an estimated average number of hours each 
airframe will accrue in a given time period, normally 30 days.  It is more conservative to plan 
for all Alert lines to launch when calculating this number.   
Air refueling control point—The planned geographic point over which the receiver(s) arrive 
in the observation/pre-contact position with respect to the assigned tanker. 
Air refueling control time—The planned time that the receiver and tanker will arrive over the 
air refueling control point Air Refueling Control Point. 
Air refueling exit point—The designated geographic point at which the refueling track 
terminates.  In a refueling anchor, it is a designated point where the tanker and receiver may 
depart the anchor area after refueling is completed. 
Air refueling initiation point—A point located upstream from the Air Refueling Control Point 
at which the receiver aircraft initiates a rendezvous with the tanker. 
Air refueling track—A track designated for air refueling reserved by the receiver unit/planner.   
If possible, the track from the Air Refueling Initiation Point to the Air Refueling Control Point 
should be along a Tactical Air Navigation/Very High Frequency Omni directional Range and 
Tactical Air Navigation  radial and within 100 NM of the station. 
Allowable cabin load—The maximum payload that can be carried on a mission.  Note: The 
allowable cabin load may be limited by the maximum takeoff gross weight, maximum landing 
gross weight, or by the maximum zero fuel weight. 
Anchor point—A designated geographical point on the downstream end of the inbound course 
of the Anchor Refueling Pattern. 
Anchor refueling—Air refueling performed as the tankers maintain a prescribed pattern which 
is anchored to a geographical point or fix.

Anchor rendezvous—The procedures normally employed by radar (Control and Reporting 
Center/Ground Control Intercept/ Airborne Warning and Control System) to vector the 
tanker(s) and receiver(s) for a visual join-up for refueling.  Note:  North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization uses the term Rendezvous Alpha. 
Available Offload—Fuel available for offload from a single tanker, including loiter time in an 
air refueling airspace. 
Average Deliverable Offload—The average fuel expected to be offloaded from each tanker in 
a large fleet air refueling plan.  When tankers do not have sufficient fuel remaining to account 
for loiter and requested offload, any remaining fuel cannot be offloaded effectively. 
Average Ground Time—This is an estimate of the average time each aircraft will be on the 
ground between missions, averaged across the total fleet of aircraft.  For aircraft that turn to a 
second mission on a single Air Tasking Order day, actual ground time may be as low as the 
minimum ground time between individual events.  Over the course of a typical 30 day plan 
period, these numbers reflect the actual amount of time aircraft are on the ground and available 
for maintenance operations. 
Average Sortie Duration—The average flight time, from takeoff until landing, for a single 
type aircraft from a single operating location.  This time applies to both aircraft and aircrew. 
Base air refueling altitude—A reference altitude at which lead aircraft of a tanker formation 
(or single aircraft for individual air refueling) will fly at initial contact. 
Base Offload (by plan factor)—This is an estimate of the overall fleet deliverable capacity by 
a single type aircraft at a single location.  Offload Plan Efficiency is accounted for in this 
planning factor.  Ground alert aircraft are counted against the fleet for sortie generation (more 
conservative), and fuel from the alert aircraft is not considered in total fuel deliverable (also 
more conservative). 
 
80% Base Capacity = 80% of available aircraft, excluding alert aircraft, maximum 
utilization rate.  Note:  This does not take operating restrictions or mission flow into account. 
 
80/40 Daily Contract = examples include 85% Plan Efficiency factor, excluding Alert 
 
70/40 Daily Contract = examples include 85% Plan Efficiency factor, excluding Alert 
 
Burdened Cost of Fuel—This is the ratio of fuel delivered to fuel consumed to accomplish the 
delivery.  Burdened Fuel includes fuel delivered as well as fuel consumed by the tanker.  
Efficient tanker plans drive towards the minimum Burdened Cost of Fuel to meet the offload 
required.  This is a true measure of tanker fleet optimization. 
Burn Rate—The average burn rate, across the flight duration, used for approximating fuel 
consumption. 
Civil Reserve Air Fleet—A program in which the Department of Defense uses FAA Part 121-
certificated, United States-flagged aircraft.  These aircraft are allocated by the Department of 
Transportation to augment the military airlift capability of the Department of Defense.  These 
aircraft are allocated, in accordance with Department of Defense requirements, to segments, 
according to their capabilities such as International and Domestic segments, as may be 
mutually agreed upon by the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation.  
The Civil Reserve Air Fleet can be incrementally activated by the Department of Defense in 
 
  AFPAM10-1403  24 OCTOBER 2018

three stages in response to defense-oriented situations, up to and including a declared national 
emergency or war, to satisfy Department of Defense airlift requirements.  Note:  The 
international segment is further divided into long-range and short-range sections; and the 
domestic segment is further divided into National and Alaskan sections. 
Closure—In transportation, the process of a unit arriving at a specified location.  It begins 
when the first element arrives at a designated location, e.g. port of entry/port of departure, 
intermediate stops, or final destination, and ends when the last element does likewise.  For the 
purposes of studies and command post exercises, a unit is considered closed after 95 percent of 
its movement requirements for personnel and equipment are completed. 
Contingency—Non-Mobilized Utilization Rate = Sustained rate of flying hour activity based 
upon full active duty participation and 25% reserve volunteerism.  
Crew Rest—The minimum amount of time from landing until the next subsequent takeoff for a 
single crew to fly a second mission after completion of a previous mission.  This time accounts 
for post-flight, mission planning, and pre-flight duties.  The standard Crew Rest time for tanker 
aircrew is 17 hours. 
Critical Care Air Transport Teams—Provide critical care augmentation to aeromedically 
evacuated injured, ill and/or burn patients requiring advanced care during transportation.  They 
are available to assist the aeromedical evacuation crews if a patient‘s condition dictates. A 
Critical Care Air Transport Team is comprised of three personnel: a physician who may be an 
intensivist (cardiopulmonary), a critical care nurse, and a respiratory technician. 
Cycle time—Total elapsed time for an aircraft to depart home station, fly a complete mission 
and be back to start a second time. 
Destination Reserves—Required fuel at destination.  Reserve requirements will vary along the 
route for fighter-type aircraft depending on divert requirements and actual weather conditions. 
Distance—Total distance between departure location and arrival location.  Linear distance 
between locations does not account for route of flight or wind factors.  When available, actual 
flight plans from vetted flight planning systems should be used to determine actual distance and 
time of flight. 
Dual Role Mission—A mission where both air refueling and airlift are provided to the user.  
The primary mission role is normally air refueling.  Missions where cargo movement is 
primary require a dedicated funded special assignment airlift mission. 
Duties Not Including Flying Rate—This is the percentage of crews unable to fly missions due 
to medical restrictions.  This rate will vary by crew force and local conditions, but is typically 
below 10%.  Scheduling flexibility and aircrew management must take actual Duties Not 
Including Flying rates into account when determining minimum crew force requirements for 
crisis response and sustained operations. 
En Route Rendezvous—A rendezvous procedure whereby the tanker and receiver arrive at a 
common rendezvous point at the same time with 1,000 feet altitude separation.  Note:  North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization uses the term Rendezvous Golf. 
Expected Plan Efficiency—The percentage of “Available Offload” that can be delivered 
effectively to receiver aircraft by a combined refueling fleet.  This factor is used as an average 
fleet planning factor when determining tanker sortie requirements.  Actual offload rates will 
30 
 
  AFPAM10-1403  24 OCTOBER 2018 
 
vary from sortie to sortie, depending on mission timing and receiver flow.  This factor is may 
be as high as 85-95% for operations with steady receiver flows.  Historical data (Operation 
Iraqi Freedom) shows this rate may drop as low as 45% due to receiver mission profiles.  As a 
general rule, higher Plan Efficiency numbers reflect less flexibility for mission execution. 
Fleet Capability—The amount of cargo or passengers that can be moved into or out of a 
location or theater expressed in short tons or passengers per day.  Limitations include the 
number of aircraft in the operation, their utilization rate, and the distance between onload and 
offload locations. 
Flight Time—Time from takeoff until landing, including the planned departure and arrival 
procedures.  This time includes planned loiter over the intended operating location.   
Front Lines—The expected number of sorties that can be launched, beginning at the start of 
the plan time period.  This number is determined by the size of the total fleet, the mission 
commitment rate, and the number of ground alert aircraft. 
Fuel Flow—Average burn rate in pounds/hour. 
Global Decision Support System—AMC’s force level command and control system 
supporting 618 AOC (TACC) execution authority for effective airlift mission management.  It 
provides AMC accurate, near real-time data required for making decisions concerning the 
deployment and employment of AMC resources.  New accounts may be obtained by contacting 
one’s Unit Program Account Manager at their home unit. An individual can find out who their 
Unit Program Account Manager is by calling the GDSS Help Desk at DSN 576-4949, Option 
2, Option 2. 
Ground Time—The planned ground time for the type of aircraft used. 
Ground Alert—The number of aircraft and crews assigned to ALFA Alert status.  Alert 
aircraft are cut from the pool of available aircraft for mission taskings.  Ground Alerts are 
normally planned in 24-hour increments, and may launch at any time during the plan period. 
Integrated Computerized Deployment System—A fully integrated information system that 
provides multi-modal load planning capabilities to Department of Defense agencies and 
services.  The combined functionality of ship, air, truck, rail, and yard planning services 
provides commanders, planners, and operators with a single platform capable of producing and 
evaluating load plans and alternative actions for various sized units, employing various modes 
of transportation, in support of peacetime or wartime operations.  The Integrated Computerized 
Deployment System consumes cargo and passenger information from a variety of Department of 
Defense manifesting systems and, in return, provides load planning, report generation, and 
forecasting services to USTRANSCOM and its component commands, Department of Defense 
customers, and other authorized users. 
Maximum Aircraft Sorties (percentage)—This is the maximum number of sorties a given 
fleet of aircraft can fly at a given commitment rate, accounting for all aircraft not tasked with 
Alert lines.  This does not take operating conditions into account, and is used only as a starting 
point.  A 100% commitment rate requires perfect scheduling. 
Minimum Required Ground Time—The amount of planned time required from one landing 
until the next subsequent takeoff per aircraft for a single type aircraft from a single operating 
location.  This time includes post-flight, refueling, and pre-flight duties for any subsequent 
 
  AFPAM10-1403  24 OCTOBER 2018 
31 
 
sorties.  This time assumes the aircraft is either flying another mission during the same plan 
period, or at the early part of the next plan period.  Mission profiles and operating unit/location 
restrictions may preclude short turn times.  Evaluate planning factors with each operating unit 
to determine actual mission capacity. 
Missions required—The number of strategic airlift missions (by aircraft type) required to 
move a requirement from the onload to the offload location. 
Noncombatant Evacuation Operation—Operations conducted to relocate threatened 
noncombatants from locations in a foreign country.  These operations normally involve US 
citizens whose lives are in danger, and may also include selected foreign nationals.  Note:  
Noncombatant Evacuation Operation planning factors (refer to Table 3) should be used when 
planning Noncombatant Evacuation Operation operations.   Emergency Noncombatant 
Evacuation Operation capabilities represent the most extreme of circumstances. 
Number of aircraft—The specific number of aircraft apportioned to any peacetime operation, 
contingency, or exercise, or the number of aircraft apportioned in the Joint Strategic 
Capabilities Plan Enclosure 11, for tasked Operational Plans.  
Offload (by plan factor)—This is the available offload for a single tanker at the planned 
average sortie duration.  This factor considers a static ramp fuel load for each Air Tasking 
Order day, average burn rates, and returning to the departure airfield with required reserves. 
Offload Efficiency—Percentage of planned offload compared to the amount of fuel available 
for offload on a single sortie.  This is useful to track, but does not accurately reflect optimum 
asset employment.  Planned Offload Efficiency and actual sortie offloads should be regularly 
compared to improve planning and employment models. 
Pavement/Aircraft classification system—The International Civil Aviation Organization 
standard method of reporting pavement strengths.  The Pavement Classification Number is 
established by an engineering assessment of the runway.  The Pavement Classification Number is 
for use in conjunction with an Aircraft Classification Number.  Aircraft Classification Number 
values (provided in Table 1) relate aircraft characteristics to a runway‘s load bearing capability, 
expressed as a Pavement Classification Number.  An aircraft with an Aircraft Classification Number 
equal or less than the reported Pavement Classification Number can operate on the pavement 
subject to any limitations on the tire pressure.  Refer to Department of Defense Flight 
Information Publication (En route Supplement) for an airfield‘s specific Pavement Classification 
Number. 
Payload—The sum of the weight of passengers and cargo that an aircraft can carry.  Note:  
Cargo weight is normally expressed in short tons. 
Plan Period—The time span used for sortie generation capacity.  This is typically a single 24 
hour Air Tasking Order cycle. 
Planning payload—The payload (expressed in short tons of cargo or number of passengers) 
expected on a fleet-wide basis, and used by planners to make initial gross planning estimates.   
The size, shape, and density of most payloads, as well as passenger constraints (i.e., oxygen or 
life preservers available), rarely permit loading to 100 percent capacity.  Planning payload data, 
not maximum payload data, should be used for operations/transportation planning.

  AFPAM10-1403  24 OCTOBER 2018 
 
Play Gas—Fuel available on a single tanker that can be burned, offloaded, or dumped.  This 
fuel is based on zero time on station, and does not account for time required to accomplish an 
offload or additional loiter time. 
Point Parallel Rendezvous—A rendezvous  accomplished with the tanker maintaining an 
appropriate offset, the receiver flying the Air Refueling Initiation Point to Air Refueling 
Control Point track, and the tanker turning in front of the receiver at a computed range.  Note:  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization uses the term Rendezvous Delta. 
Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory—Aircraft authorized to a unit for performance of its 
operational mission.  The Primary authorization forms the basis for the allocation of operating 
resources to include manpower, support equipment, and flying hours funds per Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 4410.01G, Standardized Terminology for Aircraft Inventory 
Management.   
Productivity Factor—Gross measure of an aircraft’s expected useful ability to move cargo 
and passengers to a user, expressed as a percentage.  Positioning, depositioning, and other non- 
productive legs all diminish the overall productivity.  For example, on a strategic airlift mission 
involving an outbound and a return leg, the return leg is normally considered nonproductive.  
The productivity factor, in this case would be 50 percent.  However, this assumes cargo has 
already been positioned at the aircraft’s departure point.  In most situations, airlift aircraft must 
fly one or more positioning legs to an onload location.  Since productive cargo is usually not 
moved at this time, these positioning legs reduce the overall productivity factor to a value less 
than 50 percent.  For planning purposes use the productivity factors found in Table 7, or 
calculate your own by dividing productive leg distance (onload to offload) by round trip cycle 
distance. 
Queuing Efficiency—A factor used by planners and applied in formulas (i.e., throughput 
capability) to account for the physical impossibility of using limited airfield facilities with 
perfect efficiency.  For example, when a parking spot is vacated, it is never instantly re-
occupied.  Historically, planners have applied a queuing efficiency of 85 percent. 
Requirement—  
Airlift - The force to be moved in number of passengers or short tons of cargo.  
Tanker - The number and type of receivers, fuel desired, time to loiter, and air refueling 
track. 
Round Trip Flying Time—The accumulated flying time from the aircraft‘s starting point, to 
the onload location, through the en route structure, to the offload location, back through the en 
route system, to starting point of origin or other final destination. 
Round Trip Ground Time—The accumulated ground time from the aircraft‘s starting point, 
to the onload location, through the en route structure, to the offload location, back to the final 
destination. 
Short Ton—2,000 pounds. 
Sortie Contract—This is an expected sortie generation plan agreed upon between operations 
and maintenance for the total number of sorties that a specific unit can plan for in a given time 
period.  Planners will typically task sorties within this contract, provided all plan sorties fall 
 
  AFPAM10-1403  24 OCTOBER 2018 
33 
 
within the given plan period, accounting for planned ground times.  Note:  total sorties planned 
under a contract must be equal to or lower than the lowest of:  
- 
Maximum Aircraft Sorties 
- 
Maximum Aircrew Sorties 
- 
Aircrew Hour Limited Sorties 
Sortie Generation Rate (for tankers, this is commonly referred to as utilization rate)—The 
number of sorties a single aircraft or aircrew can generate in a given plan time period.  Aircraft 
utilization rates are typically higher than aircrew utilization rates.  Utilization rates typically 
generate maximum employment numbers, which may be reduced by various mission factors.  
As an example, operations may be limited by the following list of factors as well as multiple 
additional considerations: 
- 
Receiver demand/mission profiles 
- 
Airfield operating hours 
- 
Fuel re-supply and fuel delivery capacity 
- 
Weather conditions 
- 
Airfield infrastructure 
Tanker Sortie Generation—For theater refueling support, tanker aircraft typically recover to 
the same airfield they departed from.  Air refueling capacity is determined by the amount of 
fuel available from each tanker, and how many sorties each aircraft can generate in a given time 
period.  Sustained sortie generation rates will be lower than surge rates or contingency support 
rates.  Sustained sortie generation rates in a combat theater will be higher than home-station 
sustained mission generation rates.  As a rule, rounding off numbers will make calculations 
either more or less conservative, depending on the formula.  Tanker planners typically round 
requirements up, and capacity down, producing a more conservative number.  Either approach 
is acceptable, as long as planners understand all assumptions applied to planning calculations. 
Tanker Sorties Required—This is the estimated total number of sorties required to meet 
receiver requirements.  Tanker sorties required may be estimated by taking total requested 
offload divided by the Average Deliverable Offload per tanker.  This accounts for the Expected 
Plan Efficiency.  This model is based on meeting or exceeding receiver requirements to provide 
mission effective refueling.  Excess airborne fuel provides additional flexibility during 
execution. 
True Air Speed—Average true airspeed of receiver leg (Aircraft Block Speeds or applicable 
flight manual airspeeds for other aircraft.) 
Task Rate—This is the ratio of the flying contract to the maximum number of sorties that can 
be generated at 100%, using average sortie duration and average ground time.  Task rates 
higher than Mission Capability may result in mission cancellations.  Task rates significantly 
below Mission Capability Rate indicate excess capacity and low mission effectiveness of the 
overall fleet. 
Time to arrival—The time required for cargo/passengers to arrive at the offload location 
including all en route ground times. 
Total Fuel—Total fuel on board an individual aircraft at takeoff.  This accounts for fuel in 
external tanks for appropriately configured aircraft. 
34 
 
  AFPAM10-1403  24 OCTOBER 2018 
 
Transit Time—Total time either between takeoff and landing airfields, or from the departure 
airfield to a holding location and back.  This must be based on actual route-of-flight distance, 
and not direct linear distance between locations.  Airspace restrictions and Air Traffic Control 
routing will impact this number. 
Turn Lines—The number of missions that planners expect to launch, recover, and fly a second 
sortie within the given plan period.  This number should be at or below the number of Front 
Lines.  Turn line percentages are intended to balance mission capacity with maintenance 
reliability.  Not all operating units and operating locations can support Turn Lines.  For 
example, locations with daylight only operations would most likely only be able to fly one 
mission per aircraft per day.  In addition, receiver requirements may not be structured to 
facilitate turn sorties.  Receiver demand must be considered when determining whether or not 
to plan for Turn Lines as part of a unit contract. 
Use-Rate—The capability of a subset of Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory aircraft to 
generate flying hours expressed in average flying hours per aircraft per day.  Use-rate is 
computed only for those aircraft applied to a specific mission.  For example, consider an 
operation using 2 C-17 aircraft.  If one aircraft flies 10 hours while the other is in maintenance, 
then one aircraft has 10 hours of use-rate and the other has 0 hours of use-rate.  Collectively, 
these two aircraft generate 5.0 hrs/day of use-rate. 
Utilization Rate—The capability of a fleet of aircraft to generate flying hours in a day, 
expressed in terms of per Primary Authorized Inventory.  Applies only to long-term, large scale 
operations such as Operational Plans.  For small operations involving less than the entire fleet, 
utilization rate is not normally a factor. 
Wartime Objective “Surge” utilization rate—A command established flying hour goal for 
planning and programming to meet JCS directed wartime objectives in the first 45 days of the 
most demanding wartime operations.  AMC sets this rate as a target for planning and 
programming aircrews, maintenance, and aerial port manpower, active and reserve force mixes, 
and spare parts.  This early 45-day surge period assumes the deferral of scheduled maintenance, 
support people working overtime, and the full mobilization of both active and reserve forces 
with fully funded and fully stocked spares in supply. 
Wartime Objective “Sustained” utilization rate—Sustained utilization rate represent another 
command goal for planning purposes.  After a 45-day surge operation in wartime, the 
immediate demand for airlift decreases somewhat and a greater percentage of needed 
equipment arrives by sealift/surface.  AMC plans to fly at a lower operational tempo known as 
a sustained utilization rate.  This reduced rate is based upon normal duty days, 100% active and 
reserve participation, and the accomplishment of maintenance activities deferred in the surge 
period. 
Working Maximum on Ground—The maximum number of aircraft at a given location that 
can be simultaneously quick-turned within the standards published here in AFPAM10-1403.  
wMOG is the most restrictive of  apMOG, fMOG, mxMOG, opMOG, and pMOG. 
 
apMOG – The most restrictive of Passenger MOG, Fleet Service MOG, and Cargo MOG. 
 
 
paxMOG – The number of high-reach/wide-body aircraft that can be serviced 
simultaneously with Passenger Service based upon complete download and upload 
 
  AFPAM10-1403  24 OCTOBER 2018

requirements.  The figure is based on 24-hour sustained capability, high-reach/wide-body 
quick-turn ground times. 
 
 
fsMOG – The number of aircraft that can be serviced simultaneously with Fleet 
Service.  The figure is based on 24-hour sustained capability. 
 
 
cMOG – The number of high-reach/wide-body aircraft that can be serviced 
simultaneously with Cargo Loading Operations based upon complete cargo download and 
upload requirements.  The figure is based on 24-hour sustained capability, high-reach/wide-
body quick-turn ground times. 
 
fMOG – The number of aircraft that can be simultaneously refueled given use of fuel 
hydrants, and/or fuel trucks, manpower to operate them and capacity of the system. 
 
mxMOG – The number of aircraft that can be simultaneously ground handled for 
standard maintenance items during a Quick Turn/Remain Over Night).  Standard maintenance 
items include:  launch/recovery, servicing, inspections, debrief, minor maintenance and forms 
management (requires 3 qualified aircraft maintenance personnel per transient aircraft). 
 
opMOG – The maximum number of aircraft operating under or supporting US missions 
permitted at a location by host nation restrictions, restricted by dip clearances, Aircraft Rescue 
and Fire Fighting, slot times, Air Traffic Control restrictions, or other items not directly related 
to the airfield infrastructure or aircraft servicing capability. 
 
pMOG – The physical parking spaces available for Department of Defense airlift aircraft 
and/or contract carriers.  It should not exceed the number of spots identified on the most current 
parking plan and may be limited by factors such as Host Nation Agreement, Hazardous Parking 
spots available or other infrastructure limitations.  It should be expressed in two exclusive 
numbers—wide-body (C-17 equivalent) MOG and narrow-body (C-130 equivalent) MOG.  
Airfield managers may identify a “contingency” pMOG (number of aircraft that could be 
parked on the airfield in the event of contingency operations).  A contingency pMOG will 
always equal or exceed the standard pMOG.
