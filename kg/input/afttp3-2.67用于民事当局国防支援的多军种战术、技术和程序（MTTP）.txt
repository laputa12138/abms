PREFACE
1. Purpose
This multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) publication for Defense 
Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) is a single source, reference guide for tactical-level
units. It assists military planners, commanders, and individual Department of Defense 
(DOD) components employing military resources and integrating with National Guard 
forces while responding to domestic emergencies, in accordance with United States 
(US) law.
2. Scope
This MTTP publication supports planners and warfighters by establishing tactics, 
techniques, and procedures (TTP) for actions taken by DOD components when directed
to support local, territorial, state, tribal, or federal authorities responding to domestic 
emergencies. Support can be: expertise, equipment, personnel, plans, organizations,
communication, training, or other resources.
3. Applicability
This publication establishes MTTP applicable to DOD components tasked with 
supporting domestic incident responses. These include: natural or manmade disaster 
response operations, national special security events, or support to law enforcement. 
This MTTP enables DOD organizations to integrate their capabilities into response 
operations with civil authorities. The focus of this MTTP is on DOD forces serving in a 
Title 10, United States Code (10 USC) status. National Guard Domestic Operations in 
either a Title 32, United States Code (32 USC) or state active duty status are discussed, 
but are not limited by the discussion within this MTTP.
Working under Title 14, United States Code (14 USC) and Title 10 simultaneously, the 
United States Coast Guard also provides military support of civil authorities in 
coordination with DOD DSCA operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
DSCA
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (MTTP) for Defense Support of Civil 
Authorities (DSCA) describes Title 10, United States Code (10 USC), military 
involvement as the Services operate unilaterally or along with state National Guard 
(NG) forces in DSCA environments. For effective DSCA operations, active, reserve, and 
NG personnel operating under differing military authorities should understand the 
integration of capabilities, duties, and legal limitations as they support state and federal 
civilian agencies. Domestic emergencies or incidents (including all hazard disaster 
response operations) present unique challenges for tactical-level commanders who 
operate under differing legal authorities and chains of command when coordinating and 
working with local, territorial, state, tribal, or federal authorities. This publication 
enhances military understanding as Title 10, and Title 32, Department of Defense 
(DOD) forces work side by side within the typical DSCA command and control 
architecture and outlines some of the challenges impacting DOD support operations. 
Working under Title 14 and Title 10, simultaneously, the United States Coast Guard 
also provides support for DSCA operations. 
Chapter I Defense Support of Civil Authorities Operational Framework 
Chapter I emphasizes the unity of effort through coordination frameworks in support of 
civil authorities. 
Chapter II Legal and Policy Considerations 
Chapter II highlights the unique legal and policy considerations associated with DSCA
operations. It discusses approval authorities, immediate response authority, disaster 
response under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act or
the Economy Act. It also addresses rules for using force, intelligence oversight, the 
Posse Comitatus Act, and using DOD imagery support. 
Chapter III Commander and Staff Defense Support of Civil Authorities Mission 
Considerations 
Chapter III discusses the operational environment, lays out the operational phasing 
construct, and provides DSCA planning and execution considerations for military forces. 
It describes and compares the overall responsibility of each key billet and its
coordination with civilian counterparts. Additionally, it provides a breakdown of
anticipated requirements of a tactical-level staff in a typical operation across general 
operational phases. 
Chapter IV Domestic Incidents and Special Events 
Chapter IV provides an overview of the environment, impacts, and likely military 
missions for specific DSCA incidents. These include: wildland firefighting; wind storms 
(tropical cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes); earthquakes; floods; and 
winter storms. Also included are: civil search and rescue; chemical, biological, 
radiological, and nuclear events; national special security events; and cyber-attacks.

DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES (DSCA) OPERATIONAL 
FRAMEWORK
1. Overview
a. There are critical differences among homeland defense operations, DSCA, and
operations conducted outside the United States (US). Principally, these differences
are the roles of civilian organizations; the relationship of military forces to local,
territorial, state, tribal, or federal authorities; and the legal authorities under which
military forces operate. For DSCA, US military personnel must understand the roles
of civil authorities and their relationships to supporting military capabilities.
b. The US exercises sovereignty of its land areas plus twelve nautical miles out to
sea. It applies this sovereignty to the continental US, Alaska and Hawaii, the District
of Columbia, the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the
Northern Mariana Islands. Additionally, the US has internationally recognized
responsibilities extending 200 nautical miles from the coast of the US and its
territories. Military forces may support civil authorities anywhere within this area, with
the proper execution authorities and permissions.
c. Homeland security and homeland defense are complementary components of the
National Security Strategy. Homeland defense is the protection of US sovereignty,
territory, domestic population, and critical defense infrastructure against external
threats and aggression, or other threats as directed by the President (joint
publication (JP) 3-27, Homeland Defense). The Department of Defense (DOD)
executes homeland defense by detecting, deterring, preventing, and defeating
threats from actors of concern as far forward from the homeland as possible. The
homeland defense operational framework includes the plans and actions taken to
detect, deter, prevent, shape, and defeat threats and aggression against the
homeland. DOD leads homeland defense and is supported by other federal
agencies. In turn, the DOD supports the nation's homeland security efforts, which
are led by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Homeland security is the
concerted national effort to: prevent terrorist attacks within the US; reduce America's
vulnerability to terrorism, major disasters, and other emergencies; and minimize
damage and expedite recovery from attacks, major disasters, and other
emergencies described in JP 3-28, Defense Support of Civil Authorities. A review of
the relationship among homeland defense, homeland security, and DSCA is located
in JP 3-28.
d. DSCA operations are vital aspects of the military’s service to the nation. As
described in JP 3-28, DSCA is support provided by DOD military forces, civilians,
contractors, and component assets in response to requests for assistance (RFA)
from civil authorities. DSCA includes support to prepare for, prevent, protect,
respond to, and recover from domestic incidents.

)HEUXDU\ 
Note: For brevity, this publication refers to specific laws or United States Code (USC)
titles without USC.
e. Each states’ National Guard (NG) provides support while in state active duty
(SAD) status or Title 32 duty status under the authority of the governor, for domestic
emergencies and designated law enforcement and other activities. Figure 1 provides
a comparison of NG SAD/Title 32 (state response) versus Title 10 (federal) DSCA
response.
Note: Laws and statutes determine whether NG forces are conducting domestic 
operations (DOMOPS), DSCA, or both. NG authorities are under Title 32 or Title 10. 
These authorities as well as duty status (e.g., SAD) determine the restrictions under 
which NG forces operate and are discussed further in chapter II.
Figure 1.
NG SAD/Title32 (State Response or Domestic Operations) and Title 10 
(DSCA)
f. When in support of civilian authorities, all military forces remain under the
operational control (OPCON) and administrative control (ADCON) of their federal or
Service departments. Federal military forces always remain under the command of
the President of the United States (POTUS) through the Secretary of Defense
(SecDef) and the supported combatant commander (CCDR). State military forces
remain under command of the governor.
g. United States Coast Guard (USCG) forces integrate into the federal response
under Title 10 and Title 14 authorities, simultaneously, remaining under the OPCON
and ADCON of their USCG chain of command, unless otherwise directed by
POTUS.

2. Authorities Governing DSCA
a. The authorities for provision of DSCA are found in US law, DOD policy, Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) orders, and CCDR orders. The authorities for
DOD components to conduct DSCA operations are found in DOD Directive (DODD)
3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA), and standing CJCS, United
States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), and United States Indo-Pacific
Command (USINDOPACOM) DSCA execute orders (EXORDs). JP 3-28 and
Service-specific implementation listed in the references section of this publication
provide additional guidance. Chapter II and appendix A discuss approval authority in
more detail.
b. Each state has laws specifying NG authority for providing DSCA. Agreements
among states for mutual aid under the emergency management assistance compact
(EMAC) and memoranda of agreement also fall under state laws. DODD 5105.77,
National Guard Bureau, outlines the responsibilities of the National Guard Bureau
(NGB) established in federal law. EMAC is a congressionally ratified, mutual aid
agreement between all states and territories of the US, which provides form and
structure to interstate mutual aid. Through EMAC, a disaster-impacted state can
request and receive assistance from other member states quickly and efficiently,
resolving two key issues up front: liability and reimbursement.

Operations conducted by the US military in the homeland and US territories are very 
different from operations conducted overseas. Homeland operations are conducted 
under the authority and within the limitations of federal, state, and local laws. During 
these operations, Title 10, Title 14, and Title 32 forces support civil authorities as part of 
federal or state-led responses. DSCA operations provide a unique legal landscape not 
typical of the usual range of military operations trained for and conducted by the DOD. 
Chapter II provides additional information regarding legal and policy considerations that 
form restraints and constraints for conducting DSCA operations at US federal, tribal, 
state, and local levels, as directed.
4. Overview of the National Response Framework (NRF), National Incident
Management System (NIMS), and Incident Command System (ICS)
a. The NRF presents the guiding principles for preparing all response partners for
an unified national response to domestic disasters and emergencies. It establishes a
comprehensive, national, all-hazards approach to a domestic incident response. The
NRF describes the principles, roles, and coordinating structures used for delivering
the core capabilities required to respond to an incident. Furthermore, it describes
how response efforts integrate with those of the other mission areas. The NRF
describes the doctrine under which the nation responds to incidents.
b. The Federal Government, and many states, use emergency support functions
(ESFs) to group capabilities into an organizational structure to provide the support,
resources, program implementation, and services most likely to be needed to:
(1) Save lives.
4  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
)HEUXDU\ 
(2) Protect property and the environment.
(3) Restore essential services and critical infrastructure.
(4) Help victims and communities return to normal.
c. Under the NRF, ESFs organize into 14 functions. Additionally, the NRF names
each function’s coordinating agency. Appendix C lists the federally recognized
ESFs. Many states choose to have more than 14 ESFs.
d. The NIMS provides terminology and organizational processes establishing a
template for incident management. This system enables unity of effort among local,
tribal, state, and federal governments, as well as private sector and
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in disaster response operations. Three
major components make up this system’s approach: resource management,
command and coordination, and communications and information management.
e. The ICS is a management system enabling effective, efficient, and flexible
incident management. The ICS addresses incident command in terms of single
incident, area and unified command. Command and general staffs support the
incident commander (IC) with functions depicted in figure 2.
Note: ICS forms are part of the NIMS.
Figure 2.
ICS
Note: The ICS concept of “command” is different from the military’s use of this term. 
Military forces in a DSCA environment will remain under the OPCON and ADCON of the 
military chain of command. DOD components are not directly under the command of the 
IC, but instead, work in a supporting role by providing a capability or resource.
5. Overview of the DHS
a. DHS is a presidential, cabinet-level organization with the responsibility of security
of the homeland. This includes responding to national disasters at the federal level.
DHS operational and supporting components are the:
(1) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 5
(2) USCG.
(3) US Customs and Border Protection.
(4) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
(5) US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
(6) US Secret Service.
(7) Transportation Security Administration.
(8) Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.
(9) Office of Intelligence and Analysis.
(10) Office of Operations Coordination.
b. FEMA is organized into ten regions, shown in figure 3. Each region serves as the
focal point for organizing and coordinating state and federal emergency
management for incidents within the region.
Figure 3.
FEMA Regions
6. Response Overview
a. The responsibility for responding to domestic disasters and emergencies rests
with the lowest level of government able to manage the response. If local and state
capabilities prove insufficient, state authorities may ask for assistance from other
states under existing agreements and compacts. States exhaust their resources and
execute existing mutual aid agreements and EMAC before requesting federal
assistance.
6  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
)HEUXDU\ 
b. The scope of a disaster response may overwhelm resources and capabilities,
almost simultaneously, at all response levels. NG forces may receive an alert order
through state channels at the same time federal military forces receive their alert and
prepare-to-deploy orders through DOD channels.
7. State and NG Responses
a. The NG is the first military response to most state, local, or territorial disasters.
When a governor mobilizes the NG, the forces are in SAD or Title 32 under
command and control (C2) of the governor. SAD forces conduct all missions in
support of state requirements and within state guidelines and statutes.
b. The Chief, National Guard Bureau (CNGB) is the principal advisor to the SecDef,
through the CJCS, on matters relating to the NG. The CNGB is also the principal
adviser to the Secretaries and Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Air Force on all NG
issues. The CNGB serves as the DOD’s official channel of communication with the
governors and adjutants general of the 54 NGS (50 states and territories of Puerto
Rico, US Virgin Islands, Guam, and the District of Columbia). Integrating NG support
in domestic incidents, the CNGB facilitates and coordinates among states and the
DOD.
c. Each state has a joint force headquarters-state (JFHQ-State) providing C2 for all
Army and Air NG forces. The JFHQ-State serves as the focal point for all NG
domestic operations within each state. JFHQ-States can serve as operational
headquarters when NG forces conduct domestic operations support in a Title 32 or
SAD status.
d. Each JFHQ-State may stand up one or more state joint task forces (JTFs)
supporting internal and external missions. JFHQ-State acts as the tactical
headquarters for all in-state NG domestic operations missions.
e. State defense forces are state entities and are not part of DOD. State defense
force members wear the military uniform assigned by The Adjutant General (TAG) of
the state (i.e., militia, California State Military Reserve).
8. Federal DOD DSCA Response
a. The defense coordinating officer (DCO) is the DOD single point of contact for
domestic incidents. The DCO will evaluate requirements for military support, process
RFA, validate and forward mission assignments to the appropriate DOD channels for
SecDef approval and Joint Staff sourcing, and coordinate military liaisons with
activated ESFs. The DCO has a defense coordinating element (DCE) consisting of
staff and military liaison officers coordinating and supporting activated ESFs. See
figure 4 for a sample of an augmented DCE structure.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 7
Figure 4.
Sample of a DCE Structure
b. Emergency preparedness liaison officers (EPLO) are senior reserve officers who
represent their Service at a joint field office by conducting planning and coordination
in support of civil authorities. The USCG maintains EPLOs similar to DOD EPLOs
but coordinates directly with the FEMA regions and the Coast Guard operational
commander.
c. Military units in a Title 10 status are under federal authority and under the
OPCON of USNORTHCOM or USINDOPACOM. In the EXORD or operation order
(OPORD), the CCDR will grant direct liaison authorized to designated military unit
commanders. As such, they should contact the joint force commander (JFC) or DCO
as soon as possible after receipt of DSCA deployment orders to obtain mission
specifics and process requests for information and facilitate mission planning.
9. RFA and Mission Assignment Process
FEMA coordinates the federal response to a disaster. The agency evaluates a RFA 
within the joint field office (JFO) and issues a mission assignment (MA) to other federal 
agencies. For more information on these processes, see JP 3-28.
10. JFO
a. The JFO is a temporary, multiagency coordination center at or near the incident
site, established to provide a central location for coordination of governmental,
nongovernmental, and private-sector organizations. These organizations have
primary responsibility for incident oversight, direction, or assistance to coordinate
protection, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery actions. See figure 5
for a sample of the JFO structure.
8  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
)HEUXDU\ 
b. Incidents are managed at the lowest level possible. The governor appoints a
state coordinating officer (SCO) to oversee state response and recovery efforts.
Federal support is provided in response to requests from state or local officials
through the SCO to the federal coordinating officer (FCO).
Figure 5.
Sample JFO Structure
c. The DCO reviews DOD suitability to perform a particular RFA or mission
assignment through coordination with FEMA, the state emergency manager, NG, for
DSCA combatant command (CCMD) support.
11. Parallel Federal and State Military Command Structures
In many DSCA operations, federal and state military forces operate in overlapping areas 
but under separate chains of command. Federal and state military leaders retain 
separate C2 of their assigned forces as they provide their individual support to the civil 
authority.
12. Dual-Status Commander (DSC) Structure
a. To unify the military response, federal law permits the establishment of a DSC to
command federal military personnel in Title 10 status and NG personnel in Title 32
status or on SAD. Simultaneously, the DSC holds state and federal commissions.
The commander commands both forces to coordinate the military response and
provide unity of effort.
b. In accordance with (IAW) Section 325 (a)(2), Title 32, United States Code (32
USC 325(a)(2)), a NG DSC requires the approval of the POTUS (or a delegated
authority i.e., SecDef) and the consent of the officer’s governor to serve in both duty
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
9
statuses. For an active duty, commissioned officer, pursuant to Section 315, Title 32 
United States Code (32 USC 315), the Secretaries of the Army or Air Force may 
detail regular officers to duty with the NG, with the permission of the POTUS and 
delegated to the SecDef. The detailed officer may accept a commission in the NG 
without vacating his or her regular appointment. The state or territory will 
commission the officer in its NG to command its NG forces serving under state 
authority. State law will dictate the requirements and procedures for the appointment 
and require the governor’s consent.
c. A DSC operates two chains of command simultaneously. The DSC exercises
command on behalf of, and receives separate orders from, a federal chain of
command and exercises command on behalf of, and receives separate orders from,
a state chain of command. As such, DSCs establish their own subordinate federal
and state chains of command, having Title 10, Title 32, or SAD staffs. The
subordinate officers and military forces operate in only one status, either state or
federal. See figure 6 for an augmented DSC chain of command structure.
d. Command relationships may vary for Title 10 forces supporting a DSCA
operation during different phases of an operation. Specific command relationships
(i.e., OPCON, tactical control (TACON) or support) for supporting forces will be
dictated by the SecDef/CCDR and promulgated through orders. The CCDR’s
Service component commanders exercise OPCON of their Service forces with the
CCDR's supported operational component commander being delegated TACON of
those forces (i.e., Title 10 enablers and force multipliers) within the joint operations
area (JOA). For example, tactical forces postured in the JOA may start under the
TACON of the supported component commander until they are tasked to execute a
mission assignment, at which point TACON of that force will be transferred to the
DSC. Ultimately, the operational concept is to provide all capabilities to the DSC to
maximize unity of effort between Title 10 and Title 32 forces. Refer to JP-1, Doctrine
for the Armed Forces of the United States.

LEGAL AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Overview
a. This chapter focuses on authority-based (law, policy, or regulation)
considerations for DSCA operations. DSCA operations temporarily support US
civilian agencies for domestic emergencies, law enforcement support, and other
domestic activities. DODD 3025.18 provides policy guidance for executing and
overseeing DSCA. Each Service and the NGB augmented DODD 3025.18 with its
own regulations, instructions, and doctrine.
b. It is understood that state, territory, tribal, and local officials are responsible for
preparing for, and coordinating assistance to, their populace for domestic
emergencies. Governors have authority to deploy and employ forces under their
control in response to domestic incidents. This includes requesting assistance from
other states, via the EMAC process, with inherent regional or multistate coordination.
c. DSCA operations involve unique legal and policy issues and approval authorities.
In scope and duration, federal law defines and limits the federal military’s role in
DSCA operations. Commanders and their staffs, especially planners and judge
advocates, work together closely to plan, monitor, and control DSCA operations to
comply with federal and state laws and DOD policies. Additionally, based upon the
limitations on the federal military’s role, military members (Title 10, Title 14, Title 32,
and SAD) should be aware of the legal considerations and the legal authority under
which they are operating.
d. Capability does not equal authority. Approval authorities vary depending on the
mission and assets. Planners must carefully navigate and apply the appropriate
guidance to ensure mission accomplishment, consistent with the law. For further
details on unmanned aircraft systems approval authorities, see appendix A.
e. Operational constraints include the Posse Comitatus Act (PCA), privacy and civil
liberties protections, and intelligence oversight. There are detailed restrictions for
operations involving intelligence community capabilities (ICC). Intelligence oversight
provides requirements and governs the collection, dissemination, and timelines for
data retention.
f. A Stafford Act RFA moves from the state emergency operations center (EOC)
through the DCO to the SecDef for a decision. At each level, cost, appropriateness,
readiness, risk, legality, and lethality (CARRLL) factors determine if the DOD can,
and should, provide the requested support.
(1) Cost. Who will pay or reimburse DOD for the requested assistance? How
much will the assistance cost? How will it impact the installation’s budget?
(2) Appropriateness. Who provides, and is best suited to satisfy, the requested
assistance? Is it in DOD’s and the local community’s interest to provide the
12  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
assistance? Is it in DOD’s interest to provide the support? Have other options, 
such as local businesses, been considered to meet the need?
(3) Readiness. Is there an adverse impact on the DOD’s ability to perform its
primary mission? Can a carefully-tailored response provide the needed
assistance and maintain unit readiness at the same time?
(4) Risk. What are the potential health and safety hazards to federal military
forces? Are there ways to mitigate these hazards? Are there public relations or
political risks?
(5) Legality. Does the request comply with the law? Do any legal provisions
prohibit or restrict the DOD from providing the requested assistance? If
prohibited, are there any exceptions? Can an appropriate authority waive the
restriction?
(6) Lethality. Is there a potential for lethal force by or against federal forces?
2. Approval Authorities
a. The SecDef, with limited exceptions or unless otherwise delegated, is the
approval authority for all types of DSCA requests submitted by a lead federal agency
(LFA). Local commanders have immediate response authority and emergency
authority as follows.
(1) Immediate Response Authority (IRA). In response to a request for assistance
from a civil authority, under imminently serious conditions and if time does not
permit approval from higher authority, local federal commanders may provide an
immediate response by temporarily employing the resources under their control.
This is subject to any supplemental direction provided by higher headquarters, to
save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property damage within the
US.
(2) Emergency Authority. Federal military commanders have the authority, in
extraordinary emergency circumstances where prior authorization by the POTUS
is impossible and duly constituted local authorities are unable to control the
situation, to engage temporarily in activities that are necessary to quell large-
scale, unexpected civil disturbances because:
(a) Such activities are necessary to prevent significant loss of life or wanton
destruction of property and are necessary to restore governmental function
and public order.
(b) Duly constituted federal, state, or local authorities are unable or decline to
provide adequate protection for federal property or federal governmental
functions. Federal action, including the use of federal military forces is
authorized when necessary to protect the federal property or functions.
b. The SecDef has designated the Commander, United States Northern Command
(CDRUSNORTHCOM) and Commander, United States Indo-Pacific Command
(CDRUSINDOPACOM), as supported commanders for conducting DSCA
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
13
operations. As such, they are principle planning agents for DSCA. SecDef-approved 
RFAs are tasked to the appropriate commander for execution. An incident 
awareness and assessment (IAA), when requested and approved, may be used for:
(1) Situational awareness (SA).
(2) Damage assessment.
(3) Evacuation monitoring.
(4) Search and Rescue (SAR).
(5) Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) survey following
hazard prediction.
(6) Hydrographic survey.
(7) Dynamic ground coordination.
Appendix B contains an IAA support request example. 
Note: The CJCS DSCA EXORD 052100ZJUN18, permits USNORTHCOM and 
USINDOPACOM to request traditional ICC resources to conduct DSCA missions. 
SecDef approval authorizes using IAA capabilities for nonintelligence purposes. These 
missions must be conducted IAW federal intelligence oversight requirements, including 
DOD 5240.1-R, Procedures Governing the Activities of DOD Intelligence Components 
that Affect United States Persons.
c. DODD 3025.18 codifies the DOD policy for providing disaster assistance IAW the
Stafford Act, Chapter 68, Section 5121, Title 42, United States Code, (42 USC
5121), the primary statutory authorities for federal disaster assistance within the US
and its territories. The Stafford Act authorizes the POTUS to issue emergency or
major disaster declarations concerning catastrophes that overwhelm state
governments. Once a declaration is made, DOD and other federal assistance may
be provided. The Stafford Act is not an exception to the PCA. Federal military forces
may only provide indirect law enforcement assistance following a disaster or
emergency declaration.
Note: The Economy Act of 1932 (31 USC, 1535) permits federal agencies to provide 
resources and services to other federal agencies on a reimbursable basis. The 
Economy Act is also the basis for the general rule that the DOD will not compete with 
commercial businesses.
d. Presidential declarations of emergencies are situations in which federal
assistance is required to save lives, protect health and property, or mitigate or avert
a disaster. The POTUS may not declare an emergency, unless requested by the
affected governor, except when the incident primarily concerns federal functions,
property, or personnel. In terms of scope and time, emergency assistance is not as
extensive as major disaster declaration assistance.
e. Major disasters are natural catastrophes (e.g., hurricanes, tornados,
earthquakes, or snowstorms) or, regardless of cause, fires, floods, or explosions of
14  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
sufficient severity. Under the Stafford Act, the governor requesting disaster 
assistance from the Federal Government must demonstrate the state’s lack of 
capacity or resources to mount an effective response. Under the designation of a 
major disaster, the type of assistance may include:
(1) Sharing information indicating the existence of a threat to life or property or
the violation of law incidentally collected during the normal course of military
training or operations. Specifically, this does not permit tasking units or personnel
to collect intelligence within the US.
(2) Using military equipment, spare parts, supplies, and facilities.
(3) Providing personnel for equipment maintenance and operation.
(4) Providing CBRN incident support.
(5) Distributing medicine, food, and consumables.
(6) Removing debris and clearing roads determined by the POTUS as
emergency work essential for the preservation of life and property and for a
period not to exceed 10 days.
(7) Providing emergency medical care.
(8) Transporting supplies and persons.
(9) Restoring essential public services.
(10) Constructing temporary bridges, shelters, and other necessary structures.
(11) Demolishing unsafe structures.
(12) Disseminating public information on health and safety measures.
(13) Providing technical and advisory assistance to state and local officials.
(14) Conducting precautionary evacuations and recovery.
(15) Conducting SAR.
(16) Providing IAA.
3. IRA
a. Upon receiving a civilian authority’s request, when time does not permit approval
from higher authority, and under imminent conditions, local commanders may
exercise IRA to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property
damage within the US. Federal military commanders, heads of DOD components,
and responsible DOD civilian officials (hereafter referred to collectively as “DOD
officials”) have IRA as described in DODD 3025.18.This authority excludes using
UASs or ICC except as noted in appendix A, table 1 on page 77. IRA is not an
exception to the PCA. Local commanders do not have complete discretion to
support civil authorities under IRA; CARRLL provisions must be met. Support
provided under IRA will not be delayed or denied based on the inability or
unwillingness of the requester to make a commitment to reimburse the DOD.
b. IRA is applicable during POTUS-declared emergencies, major disaster
declarations, and undeclared incidents. Commanders may act under IRA
independently and higher authority is not necessary to approve continuation of
assistance after 72 hours. The commander who authorized IRA also may authorize
continuation of IRA after 72 hours, and needs to notify the National Joint Operations
and Intelligence Center (NJOIC) of the continuation, while considering the following.
(1) DOD officials must exercise judgment based on available information and
resources in determining the maximum allowable distance from the installation or
facility the immediate response may take place. DOD officials should consider
challenges such as sustainment, transportation, communications, mission impact,
and risk.
(2) Before responding to a civilian authority’s request for assistance, DOD
officials should, unless otherwise directed by a higher authority, prioritize
resources to DOD requirements first and then to address civilian authority
requests.
(3) The civil authority’s request for immediate response should be directed to the
installation commander or other DOD official responsible for the installation, with
further dissemination as needed.
c. The DOD official directing a response under immediate response authority shall
immediately notify (within 2 hours) the NJOIC, of the details of the response, through
the DOD organization’s headquarters and chain of command. The NJOIC will inform
the appropriate DOD components, including the geographic combatant command
and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and
Global Security. Per DODD 3025.18, Section 4, paragraph I (4): NG forces in Title
32 status must report IRA activities to the NGB as soon as practicable, IAW CNGB
Notice 1401.
d. An immediate response shall end when the necessity giving rise to the response
is no longer present or when the initiating commander or a higher authority directs
an end to the response. The commander directing a response under IRA shall
reassess whether there remains a necessity for the DOD to respond, under this
authority, not later than 72 hours after the RFA was received.
e. Support provided under immediate response authority should be provided on a
cost-reimbursable basis, where appropriate or legally required, but will not be
delayed or denied based on the inability or unwillingness of the requester to make a
commitment to reimburse the DOD.
4. Emergency Authority
When permitted under emergency authority, IAW DODD 3025.18, federal military
commanders have the authority to engage, temporarily, in activities that are necessary 
to quell large-scale, unexpected civil disturbances. (This is in extraordinary emergency 
circumstances where prior authorization by the POTUS is impossible and duly 
constituted local authorities are unable to control the situation.) Emergency authority is
given because:  
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
16  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
a. Such activities are necessary to prevent significant loss of life or wanton
destruction of property and are necessary to restore governmental function and
public order.
b. Duly constituted federal, state, or local authorities are unable or decline to
provide adequate protection for federal property or federal governmental functions.
federal action, including the use of federal military forces, is authorized when
necessary to protect federal property or functions.
5. DOD Support to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) and Civil Disturbance
Operations
a. To avoid military encroachment on civil authority and domestic governance, the
PCA Title 10 §§ 271-284, and DOD policy limit support to LEA. Department of
Defense instruction (DODI) 3025.21, Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement
Agencies, provides guidance on DOD support to LEA. Appendix A lists approval
authorities and guidance for employing UASs and ICC for DSCA missions.
b. US domestic civil disturbances include riots, acts of violence, insurrections,
unlawful obstructions and assemblages, and disorders prejudicial to public law and
order. The primary responsibility for protecting life and property and maintaining law
and order in the civilian community is vested in the state and local governments.
Involvement of military forces will only be appropriate in extraordinary
circumstances. The authority for civil disturbance operations primarily derives from
the Insurrection Act of 1807 (10 USC, 251-255), which vests decision-making
authority in the POTUS. The Insurrection Act permits the POTUS to use armed
forces under a limited set of specific circumstances. Responsibility for managing the
federal response rests with the Attorney General of the US. Although the Attorney
General will have primary responsibility for responses to civil disturbances, military
forces shall remain under DOD C2 at all times. Use of the military to conduct law
enforcement activities under the Insurrection Act is an exception to PCA.
c. DODI 3025.21, Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies,
addresses DOD policy on civil disturbance operations. It states, “the employment of
federal military forces to control civil disturbances shall only occur in a specified civil
jurisdiction under specific circumstances as authorized by the [POTUS], through
issuance of an [EXORD] or other presidential directive authorizing and directing the
SecDef to provide for the restoration of law and order in a specific state or locality”.
The supported CCDR may issue guidance on the carrying and use of nonlethal
weapons.
6. Rules for the Use of Force (RUF)
a. In any situation, the standing rules for the use of force (SRUF) assist federal
military personnel in determining the application of the appropriate level of force.
SRUF are restrictive measures intended to allow only the minimum force necessary
to accomplish the mission. US constitutional and domestic laws are the bases for
SRUF and provide guidance to DOD forces for using force against civilians within
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
17
US territory. See Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff instruction (CJCSI) 3121.01B, 
Standing Rules for the Use of Force for US Forces, for additional guidance.
b. CJCSI 3121.01B, Standing Rules for the Use of Force for US Forces, contain the
SRUF for US forces. These RUF do not apply to NG forces while on SAD or Title 32
USC status. NG forces operate under the state’s RUF.
c. The SRUF apply during all DSCA and routine military department functions
occurring within US territories and territorial seas. Additionally, the SRUF applies to
land defense missions occurring within US territories and to DOD forces, civilians,
and contractors performing law enforcement duties at all DOD installations within or
outside US territories.
d. A commander’s authority to modify the SRUF is limited to making the rules more,
not less, restrictive. Appendix C contains a commander’s responsibilities under the
SRUF and a SRUF template. These templates are general and provided as
examples. In coordination with the operational chain of command, commanders and
judge advocates must review the SRUF.
e. The SRUF and RUF may differ for each state’s NG forces. State laws govern the
RUF of the NG serving in a Title 32 or SAD status. Additionally, the NG’s authority to
perform law enforcement, law enforcement support, or security operations varies in
the laws of the various states. Depending on the language of the state statutes
involved, grants of, or limitations on, the NG’s authority to act as police officers may
apply to NG personnel in a Title 32, SAD status, or both. Some states grant NG
members (in a Title 32, SAD status, or both) the authority of police officers, while
others only authorize those powers enjoyed by the population at large, such as
citizen’s arrest. Consequently, each of the states, territories, and the District of
Columbia promulgate separate RUF. While coordinating with state legal authorities,
it is the duty of the NG judge advocate to tailor the RUF to the particular mission and
policies of the state. The template in appendix C provides a planning aid for
deploying forces. Prior to the assumption of a DSCA or DOMOPS mission,
commanders in Title 32 or SAD status must ensure all personnel are briefed on the
applicable state RUF.
Note: The content of appendix C will differ based on individual state laws.
7. Operational Constraints and Exceptions to the PCA
In addition to varying levels of approval authorities for DSCA, certain laws and policies
constrain the type of support DOD can provide. This section discusses the impact of the 
PCA and intelligence oversight policies on DSCA operations.
a. The PCA remains the primary federal statute restricting federal military support to
civilian LEAs. The PCA prohibits Title 10 forces from engaging in any direct law
enforcement activities unless constitutional guidance or an Act of Congress
exception applies (e.g., the Insurrection Act). Evidence of criminal activity obtained
by DOD personnel in violation of the PCA may be inadmissible in a criminal trial
18  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
thereby preventing a successful prosecution. Personnel who violate the PCA also 
may be subject to criminal and civil penalties.
(1) Through federal law and applicable DODDs, the PCA applies to all members
of the federal military forces, as well as each of their reserve components serving
in a federal status. The USCG is not subject to the PCA. IAW Title 14 United
States Code (14 USC), USCG personnel are authorized to conduct law
enforcement activities as part of the USCG mission.
(2) Whether the PCA applies to Army or Air NG personnel depends upon the
legal authority under which the guardsmen are serving. It is imperative personnel
know the various legal restrictions associated with these authorities when
engaged in a DSCA operation. One of the following three statutory frameworks
order NG personnel to duty. (See figure 7.)
(a) SAD NG personnel are state funded and under state control. This is the
authority in which NG personnel perform duties when a governor mobilizes
the NG to respond to state emergencies, civil disturbances, or disasters, or to
perform other duties authorized by state law. NG personnel on SAD authority
do not fall under PCA restrictions and may perform law enforcement duties
authorized by state law.
(b) Title 32 USC NG personnel are federally funded, but remain under the
control of the state. Because they fall under state control, they do not fall
under PCA restrictions and may perform law enforcement duties authorized
by state law.
(c) Title 10 NG personnel are federally funded and under federal control;
consequently, they are subject to the PCA.
b. National Emergency Declaration. The POTUS has authority, under Articles II and
IV of the Constitution, to declare a national emergency. Furthermore, the National
Emergency Act of 1976 (50 USC. 1601-1651) permits the POTUS to declare an
emergency to preserve order and ensure public health and safety during time of war,
insurrection, or national crisis. If the POTUS declares a national emergency, the
POTUS could issue an EXORD waiving PCA restrictions and permitting federalized
military forces to perform law enforcement functions to protect federal facilities,
property, and personnel.
c. Insurrection Act. The POTUS must issue a disperse and retire peaceably
proclamation ordering a cessation of unlawful behavior. If the unlawful behavior
continues, the Insurrection Act permits the POTUS to use the Armed Forces,
including the NG, in federal service (Title 10) to perform law enforcement functions,
within a state, to restore law and order.
d. Emergency Situations Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Upon the
request of the US Attorney General, the SecDef may authorize DOD personnel to
arrest, search, seize, and conduct any other law enforcement activity to protect
persons and property from WMD.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1

Figure 7.
Statutory Framework
e. USCG. The USCG is the nation’s lead maritime law enforcement agency and has
broad, multifaceted jurisdictional authority. The statutory basis for the Coast Guard’s
law enforcement mission is found in Title 14 USC. Under the Maritime Drug Law (46
USC, Chapter 705) Enforcement Act, approximately 180 USCG personnel serve on
law enforcement detachments (LEDETs) aboard US Navy ships and are authorized
to perform maritime drug interdictions. When engaged in a maritime drug
interdiction, USCG LEDET personnel may perform maritime law enforcement
functions to include making inquiries, examinations, inspections, searches, seizures,
and arrests. Navy personnel working with the LEDETs are bound by the PCA.
Therefore, Navy personnel may not perform active, direct law enforcement functions
and have a limited supporting role. Indirectly, Navy personnel may assist a LEDET
by:
(1) Providing force protection for a LEDET boarding party.
(2) Transporting a LEDET boarding party to a target vessel.
(3) Acting as interpreters.
20  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
(4) Supplying welding and cutting equipment assistance aboard the target
vessel.
(5) Recording the LEDET’s activities while aboard the target vessel.
(6) Recovering contraband jettisoned from the target vessel.
(7) Effecting damage control to keep the target vessel afloat.
(8) Billeting and maintaining persons apprehended from the target vessel.
f. Authorized and Restricted Activities in Support of LEAs. DODI 3025.21 and
Section 271, Title 10, United States Code (10 USC 271) authorize sharing
information collected during military operations, using military equipment and
facilities, training with LEAs, and funding and reporting mechanisms for such
support. They authorize SAR, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), domestic terrorist
incident, and civil disturbance operations support. DODI 3025.21 addresses training
with LEAs in detail. DOD directives prohibit interdicting vehicles, searches and
seizures, arrest, and similar activities (e.g., apprehension, stop, and frisk). Engaging
in questioning potential witnesses; using force or threats to do so, except in self-
defense or defense of others; collecting evidence; forensic testing; and surveillance
or pursuit of individuals or vehicles is prohibited.
g. Military Courtesy Patrol. A military courtesy patrol conducted in the local
community is not considered a PCA violation. To avoid violating the PCA, the
military courtesy patrols prescribed duties must fall short of law enforcement. Military
courtesy patrols are intended to preserve good order and discipline and serve as
liaisons with local law enforcement personnel, not to actually enforce the law.
8. Intelligence Oversight
a. DOD and NG intelligence personnel performing intelligence duties must adhere
to federal and DOD intelligence oversight rules. These include Executive Order
12333, United States Intelligence Activities; DODD 5240.01, DOD Intelligence
Activities; and DOD 5240.1-R. In addition, each Service and the NGB has
regulations and policy guidance. Intelligence oversight rules ensure intelligence
personnel protect US persons’ constitutional rights and privacy, collect essential,
authorized information by the least intrusive means, and disseminate information
only for lawful government purposes. Information may be collected only if it is
necessary for conducting a function assigned to the collecting component and if it
falls within certain criteria. These criteria include consensual, openly available
information; foreign intelligence; counterintelligence; international terrorist activities;
international narcotics activities; threats to safety; and overhead and airborne
reconnaissance.
b. DOD and NG intelligence personnel operating in a Title 10 or Title 32 status must
comply with all federal and DOD intelligence oversight rules, regulations, and
directions regarding requirements for authorized activities. Army NG personnel in
SAD status are prohibited from using DOD intelligence resources (i.e., sensors,
systems, equipment, or information) because they are not considered to be
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
21
operating in a DOD capacity. Thus, Army NG military intelligence personnel (in SAD 
status) are not authorized to perform any intelligence activities as part of the 
intelligence community. Military intelligence personnel in SAD status may use state-
owned equipment to perform any missions assigned by a governor, within the 
guidelines of state laws.
c. Contractors or nonintelligence personnel assisting in the performance of
intelligence or counterintelligence work on behalf of DOD or NG intelligence have
the same intelligence oversight responsibilities and training requirements as US
Government civilian and military intelligence personnel.
d. Within the context of IAA support to DSCA operations, the DSCA EXORD
authorizes the following IAA tasks:
(1) SA.
(2) Damage assessment.
(3) Evacuation monitoring.
(4) SAR.
(5) CBRN assessment.
(6) Hydrological survey.
(7) Dynamic ground coordination.
e. The DSCA EXORD may authorize traditional intelligence capabilities to conduct
DSCA missions for nonintelligence purposes. Use of assets designated to provide
IAA for other than the seven IAA missions requires SecDef approval on a case-by-
case basis. The DSCA EXORD states CCDRs are authorized to use manned aerial
imagery assets within their area of responsibility (AOR) to obtain imagery of
geography (not to observe people or human activity).
Note: Refer questions on whether DOD intelligence capabilities may be used in a DSCA 
operation to the command judge advocate if the authorities, permissible parameters, 
and limitations are unclear.
f. Perform all data collection, retention, and dissemination IAW standing DOD
intelligence oversight guidance, including any requirement to obtain a proper use
memorandum (PUM). Compliance with intelligence oversight policies will require
training personnel and issuing a PUM for manned and unmanned IAA platforms.
g. A PUM defines an organization’s request for a domestic imagery requirement and
its intended use. It is issued for a one-time event or on an annual basis. A PUM
acknowledges awareness of the legal and policy restrictions regarding domestic
imagery collection, retention, dissemination, and use. Depending on content, PUMs
can be classified or unclassified. The certifying official verifies and signs the PUM
and remains accountable for the accuracy of the domestic imagery request. A legal
advisor must conduct a legal sufficiency review of the PUM. The PUM provides an
22  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
auditable trail of authority and responsibility up to the appropriate levels, while 
ensuring the protection of the rights of US citizens and organizations.
9. Civil SAR
The US has established its civil SAR system to provide SAR services as part of the 
global SAR system. SAR services ensure the US meets national and international 
humanitarian and legal obligations. The US is obligated to provide SAR services as a 
party to the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, the Convention 
on International Civil Aviation, the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, and other treaties or 
agreements. See chapter IV, section 7 for detailed information on civil SAR.

COMMANDER AND STAFF SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES 
MISSION CONSIDERATIONS
1. Overview
This chapter identifies aspects of the operational environment impacting tactical
execution of the DSCA mission. Additionally, it will describe the DOD and FEMA
phasing construct for a DSCA operation highlighting specific considerations by phase, 
for a tactical level unit.
2. Operational Environment
a. Developing SA.
(1) Media reports, local DOD activities, and government agencies may provide
easy access to photographs and news reports. This may enable a hasty analysis
of the situation, enabling direct support by responding forces. Official websites
(e.g., FEMA) contain policies, reference materials, and information about
organizations involved in the area and contacts. Representative Service EPLOs
can assist in developing SA for their Service units and facilitate coordination with
the Service component headquarters. Additionally, EPLOs have a community-
wide chat capability to leverage for exchanging information.
(2) The commander’s estimate of the situation develops SA critical to providing
support for civilian authorities. Areas of particular emphasis should include:
(a) Identifying factors affecting area access, including supplying and re-
supplying materiel.
(b) Identifying environmental conditions (e.g., geography, meteorology, and
other factors) affecting force employment.
(c) Identifying environmental hazards and mitigation measures for such
dangers as hazardous material spills, gas leaks, or contaminated flood
waters.
(d) Determining communications capabilities and connectivity within the area
of operations.
(e) Identifying capabilities and limitations of federal, state, and other
participants regarding national policy, public affairs guidance, and legal
restrictions.
(f) Identifying cultural and local language factors affecting the common
understanding of the situation.
(g) Determining the health status of the population and the remaining
healthcare infrastructure and capability.
(h) Determining the safety of navigation for maritime access.
(i) Obtaining an infrastructure assessment.
24  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
(3) Understanding the perception of the DOD’s actions and the Federal
Government’s response by the local government and population is a key element
in developing SA. Commanders must receive public affairs guidance from higher
headquarters to ensure strategic communications are aligned with federal and
state leadership to develop, promote, and sustain unity of effort and public trust.
b. Facilities (Bases, Airports, Seaports, or Sea Basing).
(1) DOD Facilities used to enable a DOD Response. DOD installations may be
required to support DOD capabilities supporting a DSCA response. In this case,
DOD facilities are referred to as base support installations (BSIs). The supported
CCDR and the Service Secretaries coordinate BSI use IAW the CJCS DSCA
EXORD.
(2) DOD Facilities used to Support a Civilian Response. DOD installations may
also be used to support civilian requirements for staging and operations. In this
case, DOD facilities are referred to incident support bases or federal staging
areas, and the supported CCDR for a DSCA operation may approve an RFA with
concurrence from the appropriate Military Service Secretary IAW the CJCS
DSCA EXORD.
(3) DOD Capabilities used to Support Civilian Facilities. After conducting
immediate lifesaving activities, restoring civilian air and sea ports is one of the
most essential tasks and a critical response capability of the DOD. Functioning
aerial ports of debarkation (APODs) and seaports of debarkation (SPODs) enable
the flow of response forces and specialized equipment to the affected area. DOD
capabilities may be required to conduct surveys and assessments; restore
airfields or harbors to an operational status; and augment civilian personnel to
conduct operations. See appendix C for an example airfield and port surveys.
(4) Seabasing. Naval forces provide a unique capability to support operations
when land-based military and civilian installations are inoperable. Depending on
the location of the incident and force positioning (e.g., already at sea awaiting
hurricane landfall), naval forces can arrive quickly with critical materials,
commence response support, and sustain operations indefinitely. Damaged or
destroyed shore infrastructure does not deter naval forces from providing C2, lift,
and reconnaissance. Sea lines of communication provide an important bridges
until other DOD, government, or civilian agencies can organize and establish
operations. Further details on maritime capabilities for use in DSCA is provided in
appendix E.
c. Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration (RSOI). The operational-
level commander will establish RSOI, as soon as practical, in the affected area to
receive tactical forces supporting a DSCA operation. RSOI should provide tactical
units additional guidance and briefings to include legal guidance on the constraints
of the domestic environment, associated RUF, commander’s communication
strategy for potential contact with media, and safety briefs. Safety considerations
include hazard identification and individual protective equipment (IPE) and personal
protective equipment (PPE) requirements based on specifics of the incident.
Deconflict DOD RSOI with state EMAC RSOI.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
25
d. Communications. Communications support is critical for successful disaster
assistance operations. Disasters may disable or destroy local communications
systems, including cellular capabilities. Expect military organizations to extend
communication capabilities to non-DOD disaster response task force partners.
OPORDs and special instructions provide frequency plans to support participants
ensuring maximum interoperability. The airspace control plan assigns frequencies.
(1) As an overarching goal, data communications planning should emphasize
ease of operability and availability of information to all participants. The goal of
information management for DSCA operations is the timely flow of critical
information to enhance a DSCA force commander’s SA. These information
networks must be interoperable with NG forces executing DSCA.
(2) C2 architecture planning considerations identify:
(a) Required reports and reporting frequency.
(b) Classification levels.
(c) Communications requirements (e.g., SECRET Internet Protocol Router
Network (SIPRNET), Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network
(NIPRNET), or commercial Internet, handheld radios, and cellular phones).
(d) Public communications capabilities.
(e) Special joint information center and JFC public affairs officer (PAO)
requirements.
(f) Strategic communications plans.
(g) Unique challenges communications units have in the DSCA environment.
(3) SAR communications planning integrates all participating agencies, including
aircraft, maritime, and ground assets. Large-scale SAR operations may require
additional forward operating bases. State EOC and JFO monitor SAR and
damage assessment operations integration.
(4) Upon deployment, establish communications with the primary
communications agency. C2 systems should support immediate information
exchange for:
(a) Coordinating communications.
(b) Coordinating the local law enforcement response.
(c) Coordinating medical support.
(d) Disseminating higher headquarters’ directives.
(e) Disseminating primary agency or JFC phone numbers and frequencies.
(f) Coordinating reports.
3. Operational Phasing Construct
a. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident). Actions in this phase include interagency coordination,
planning, identification of gaps, exercises, and public affairs outreach. This phase
26  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
sets the conditions for expanded interoperability and cooperation with interagency 
partners. There are three subphases in Phase 1. These subphases consist of the 
following activities.
(1) Phase 1a (Normal Operations). Local, state, federal and military authorities
determine existing logistics, resource capabilities, develop plans, identify
procedures, and conduct training and exercises to validate existing plans. Actions
in this phase are focused on awareness and national preparedness with goals to:
prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from an incident.
(2) Phase 1b (Elevated Threat). This is a notice event that allows for further
coordination and planning or revisions based on the current situation. Analyze
situation reports (SITREPs) ensuring interagency partners plan for potential
activation and integration into planning efforts.
(3) Phase 1c (Credible Threat). This is a notice event requiring further
assessment with plan updates/revisions with additional stakeholders. Consider
pre-positioning selected response forces for a quicker response.
b. Phase 2 (Response). This phase begins when the DOD receives, or expects to
receive, an RFA from an LFA for DOD support. Also, it may happen when the
POTUS or SecDef directs support with a federal response to a disaster or
emergency in support of a state or tribal government or to support another US
Government department or agency for specifically authorized events. Phase 2 ends
when the situation is stabilized to the point where DOD support is no longer
required. Phase 2 subphases follow.
(1) Phase 2a (Initial Response). This phase begins upon expectation or receipt
of an LFA’s RFA for DOD support. Key activities are: activation of emergency
management structures, assessment of the situation, and the movement of
preplanned DOD resources.
(2) Phase 2b (Deployment of Resources and Personnel). This phase begins with
lifesaving operations in the impacted area and federal resource RSOI. Key
activities are to locate, evacuate, and provide life-sustaining support services to
the affected population. More key activities are stabilizing and ensuring
communications and channels connecting responders and the public are
operational; characterizing incident/federal resources deployment; and initiating
individual/public assistance programs. Phase 2b is successful when forces are
deployed with sufficient capabilities to support civil authorities.
(3) Phase 2c (Sustained Response). This phase begins when survivors have
been evacuated and are sustained via mass care/recovery efforts and SAR
operations have transitioned to human remains recovery. Phase 2c ends when
survivors are sheltered or return home; wherever possible, restoration of critical
infrastructure, key resources and essential services has been completed; and
senior leaders have made preliminary decisions about the initial recovery plan for
the impacted area.
c. Phase 3 (Recovery and Transition). This phase begins when the life-saving/life-
sustaining activities have been stabilized, as determined by civil authorities and
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
27
local, state, and federal resources are sufficient to continue without a DOD
response. Although the DOD does not support recovery, it may support specific 
aspects of recovery. Transition begins when all operational aspects of mission 
assignments (MAs) are complete and DOD force redeployment commences. Phase 
3 ends when all DOD forces have transitioned all operations to civil authorities and 
are redeployed with C2 transferred to their home station commands.
4. Tactical-Level Leadership
a. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident) Considerations.
(1) Upon receipt of a mission, Title 10 forces must coordinate, immediately, with
the operational chain of command.
(2) Request the staff judge advocate (SJA) provides a detailed briefing on
specific DSCA legal constraints and how they will affect unit operations.
(3) Ensure personnel receive SRUF cards.
(4) Identify and contact civilian counterparts.
(5) Determine C2 relationships.
(6) Determine weapons, ammunition, and modified table of organizational
equipment requirements and limitations.
(7) Coordinate and review disclosure and distribution policies of IAA products
with civil and interagency partners.
(8) Establish communication protocols. Use military assets for internal
communications and develop specific plans for each unique civilian
communications situation.
(9) Establish a battle rhythm while considering higher command and interagency
timelines.
(10) Begin tracking daily costs, MAs, and mission assignment task orders
(MATO).
(11) Determine force protection requirements and establish force protection
condition (FPCON) levels.
(12) Plan for media interactions, and coordinate media releases and products
through joint information center and collaborating agencies.
(13) Coordinate liaison officer (LNO) requirements (e.g., with the DCO, JTF, or
joint force headquarters (JFHQ)).
Note: LNOs are different from EPLOs. LNOs represent their command. EPLOs are 
Service and other DOD personnel who coordinate military assistance to other federal 
agencies and state governments.
(14) Ensure appropriate personnel are familiar with ICS processes and NIMS.
(15) Achieve and maintain 100% personnel accountability.

b. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2a and 2b) Considerations. (Review
examples of each subparagraph within appendix C.)
(1) Identify hazardous material (HAZMAT) requirements.
(2) Identify RSOI procedures.
(3) Determine information requirements. This helps commanders and staffs
understand the adversary; operational environment; and status of agencies,
units, and installations. Appendix C, table 7 on page 90, provides examples of
information requirements.
(4) Identify from which BSI the unit will operate.
Note: Do not assume private or public property is available for military purposes.
c. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2b and 2c) Considerations,
(1) Receive MATO.
(2) Coordinate task execution with the operational headquarters and civilian
authority.
(3) Execute reporting requirements.
d. Phase 3 (Recovery and Transition) Considerations.
(1) Develop a closeout and redeployment plan with the operational
headquarters.
(2) Compile all data from support operations, as directed. Anticipate reporting
total man hours, amount and type of equipment, and fuel used; maintenance
performed; and equipment lost, damaged, or destroyed. Also, anticipate reporting
the specific MA or MATO resources expended to provide support.
(3) Title 10 forces need to coordinate with the DCO or DCE and IC or FCO upon
mission completion and before departing the area of operations. Transition the
mission and inform the IC or FCO who assumes mission support.
(4) Develop a plan to leave a clean footprint. Do not leave HAZMAT. Document
the condition of properties upon arrival at the home station.
(5) Prepare an after action report (AAR) and document lessons learned. Submit
lessons learned to the Joint Lessons Learned Information System at
https://www.jllis.mil.
5. Personnel and Administration
a. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident) Considerations.
(1) Identify personnel status report requirements.
(2) Coordinate with medical services for identified civilian and military treatment
facilities.
(3) Identify casualty reporting and tracking procedures to address unique
challenges of operating in a DSCA environment.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1

(4) Coordinate casualty pay procedures and military pay problems with the BSI
or the nearest military installation with a pay office.
(5) Develop procedures for emergency leave.
(6) Establish mail operations.
(7) Coordinate to establish an administrative and logistics operations center.
b. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2a and 2b) Considerations.
(1) Prepare an advanced party representative.
(2) Prepare an RSOI briefing.
(3) Establish reporting procedures for subordinate units and coordinate with
higher headquarters for any specific policies. Integrate and account for DOD
civilians and contractors augmenting the unit.
(4) Ensure all military personnel update their information in one of the following
systems:
(a) Army Disaster Personnel Accountability and Assessment System.
(b) Marine Corps Total Force System or Marine Online.
(c) Navy Family Accountability and Assessment System.
(d) Air Force Personnel Accountability and Assessment System.
c. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2b and 2c) Considerations.
(1) Coordinate sheltering support and determine availability of other support
services (e.g., commissary, exchange, and daycare) for personnel living in the
affected area.
(2) Identify and use ICS reporting forms for submission to the DCO, JTF-State,
or JFHQ-State. ICS reporting forms may be found at
https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/icsresource/.
(3) Establish procedures for family members to contact military personnel.
(4) Coordinate with PAO and joint information center (JIC) for media interactions.
(5) Prepare personnel to support visitor operations.
d. Phase 3 (Recovery and Transition) Considerations.
(1) Track units as they depart the operating area.
(2) Out-process personnel through reverse RSOI.
(3) Respond to approved requests for personnel information on unit members
(e.g., unit accountability of injured personnel and medical claims reimbursement).
(4) If required, ensure all assigned military and DOD civilian personnel complete
a Department of Defense (DD) Form 2796 (Post Deployment Health Assessment
(PDHA)) prior to leaving the operating area. If the situation does not allow for
completing the health screening prior to departure, the individual’s unit
30  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
commander will ensure the completion and submission of the health assessment. 
The assessment must be submitted to the local medical treatment facility (MTF) 
commander within 30 days of the individual’s return.
(5) If required, ensure all assigned military and DOD civilian personnel complete
a DD Form 2900 (Post Deployment Health Re-assessment (PDHRA)) 90 to 180
days after redeployment to home station.
(6) Prepare an AAR and document lessons learned.
(7) Consider personal awards to key contributors as well as the Humanitarian
Service Medals (HSMs) for presidential disaster declarations (determination for
HSM resides with the Service Chief for each branch).
6. Intelligence
Note: Refer to chapter 2, paragraph 5, for legal and policy guidance for using DOD 
intelligence capabilities for a DSCA operation.
a. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident) Considerations.
Note: In a DSCA environment, do not use the terms intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance or intelligence preparation of the battlespace. The appropriate 
terminology is IAA, at the tactical level; and operational environment assessment, at the 
operational level.
(1) Gathering information on weather, roads, and environmental factors, and the
incident is legal and necessary. However, IAW DOD 5240.1-R, DOD and NG
intelligence personnel may only collect and retain information pertaining to a US
person when there is a specific mission and authority to do so. It is important that
DOD personnel know to report all information regarding illegal activities to the
appropriate civilian law enforcement agency (CLEA).
(2) The DSCA EXORD authorizes using most IAA resources to support first
responders and decision makers in the following missions.
(a) SA.
(b) Damage assessment.
(c) Evacuation monitoring.
(d) SAR.
(e) CBRN assessment.
(f) Hydrographic survey.
(g) Dynamic ground coordination.
(3) The following information concerns IAA requests.
(a) All requests for imagery or other intelligence support for areas within the
US are subject to federal and DOD intelligence oversight regulations
including, Executive Order 12333, DODD 5240.01, and DOD 5420.1-R. As a
rule, do not use DOD intelligence capabilities, resources, and personnel for
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
31
activities other than foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, unless 
specifically approved by the SecDef. For SA, planning purposes, or upon 
receipt of a validated mission assignment, use NG intelligence community 
personnel and nonintelligence equipment in a Title 32 USC or SAD status to 
fulfill TAG requirements. Due to potential violations of the PCA through direct 
DOD support to CLEAs, closely review and separately process requests for 
military support to CLEAs for approval. Process support requests according to 
DODI 3025.21, and DOD 5240.1-R, Procedure 12.
(b) File an approved PUM with the approval authority before tasking airborne
platforms to collect domestic imagery. In the event of an emergency where
USNORTHCOM is the designated lead DOD operational authority, comply
with proper use provisions by coordinating related requests for domestic
imagery from airborne platforms with USNORTHCOM. Refer to appendix B
for further guidance on IAA requests.
(c) When NG forces are in Title 32 USC status, the JFHQ-J2 will work with
the remote sensing community, including local, state, and federal agencies, to
identify IAA requirements and available IAA assets to ensure unity of effort.
Coordinate unsatisfied requirements between the JFHQ-J2 and NG-J2 via a
J2 coordination cell. NG-J2 can identify the availability of additional Title 32
force assets or interagency operations to cover unmet IAA needs.
b. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2a and 2b) Considerations.
(1) Prepare an advanced-party representative.
(2) Establish information-gathering methodologies.
(3) Contact IAA counterparts.
(4) Develop an IAA campaign plan.
(5) Request additional IAA mission support.
c. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2b and 2c) Considerations.

(2) Safeguard and transfer sensitive information and imagery collected during
the operation, according to DSCA guidance.
(3) Prepare an AAR and document lessons learned.
7. Plans and Operations
a. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident) Considerations.
(1) Military units support the civilian authorities. The supported commands are
the local authorities at the, city, county, and state levels. The principal arbiter
between the federal military (i.e., Title 10) and other federal and state entities is
the DCO who transmits specified tasks to the JFC or Title 10 forces. The DCO or
DCE and EPLOs will use the DOD DSCA Automated Support System (DDASS).
The DDASS provides the only automated means to validate MAs and allow for all
orders, requests for forces and FEMA MA forms to be associated with specific
missions and provides multiple commands SA to view and respond to mission-
critical actions. The JFC translates civil authority assignments into clear and
supportable tasks and coordinating instructions via fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs)
to supporting tactical commanders. The JFC manages the force into and out of
mission assignment operations and during self-support operations.
(2) Review disaster response plans.
(3) Establish communications with the DCO, DCE, and planning sections.
Additionally, communicate with JFHQ-State, and the DOD state EPLO located at
the state EOC.
(4) Determine LNO requirements, nominations, and support relationships.
(5) Determine the Title 10 military, federal response, and state NG chains of
command, and the state civilian command organization.
(6) Write a tactical-level DSCA order, as applicable.
(7) Coordinate mission tasking with the DCO or DCE.
(8) Coordinate RUF with the SJA.
(9) Prepare a deployment OPORD.
(10) Develop information sharing protocols (e.g., SharePoint portals, webpages,
e-mail lists, chat locations, WebEOC, and shared drives).
(11) If authorized, determine weapons storage requirements. Determining status
of weapons and arming will occur above the JFC level. Weapons RUF may
require separation of weapons from primary users.
(12) Plan for unclassified communications, documentation, and automation.
(13) Capture all costs for DOD/Federal Government reimbursement.
(14) Prepare for immediate SAR support. The urgency of the mission may adjust
the deployment, base establishment, and RSOI sequence.
b. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2a and 2b) Considerations.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1

(12) Determine the status of lines of communication (e.g., major roads, railroads,
waterways, seaports, and airports).
(13) Coordinate public affairs with the JFO public information officer (PIO) or JIC.
(14) Plan to terminate operations or transfer them to follow-on forces or civilian
counterparts. Considerations include the following.
(a) Did the joint forces accomplish their mission?
(b) What is the new mission?
(c) What joint forces, equipment, supplies, or other resources will remain?
(d) Are new RUF required?
(e) Will operations be discontinued, interrupted, or transferred?
(f) What will be the command relationship to forces left behind?
(g) Will the incoming force or organization use the same headquarters facility
or BSI?
(h) Is sufficient security available? Who will provide it?
(i) How will the turnover be accomplished?
(j) Who will handle media engagement during the transition?
(k) Has USNORTHCOM, USINDOPACOM, or United States Transportation
Command (USTRANSCOM) approved redeployment airlift, sealift, or ground
transportation (i.e., has time-phased force and deployment data been
developed/submitted/approved)?
(l) Are task force commanders aware of requirements and expectations?
(15) Coordinate required OPORD and FRAGORDs.
(16)
Develop, coordinate, synchronize, and integrate plans with designated
supported headquarters and federal agencies (e.g., FEMA).
Note: If local businesses and contractors can perform missions and tasks assigned to 
DOD, continued employment of military personnel may be unnecessary or illegal. The 
incident commander will determine when disengagement criteria has been met and 
when to withdraw military units. 
d. Phase 3 (Recovery and Transition) Considerations.
(1) According to DCO or TAG directives, set endstate conditions as soon as
possible.
(2) Notify authorities of the demobilization timeline.
36  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
(3) Coordinate with DCE to compile all data from support operations (e.g., total
man-hours, fuel, and number and type of equipment used; maintenance
performed; and equipment lost, damaged or destroyed).

all facilities.
(5) According to Service guidance, consolidate all journals, reports, records,
notes, and supporting documents for input into the AAR to document lessons
learned.
8. Logistics and Resource Management
a. Phase 1 (Pre-incident) Considerations.
(1) Conduct a contract support analysis of the operational environment.
(2) Assess BSI contracting capabilities and the ability to accommodate additional
contracting personnel assets.
(3) Assess local businesses’ ability to provide contracted support to humanitarian
and disaster relief and Title 10 force requirements.
(4) Coordinate with local, state, territory, tribal, federal and NGO support
partners to ensure all entities are not competing for like supply, service, and
construction requirements.
(5) Identify existing contract vehicles to support Title 10 force requirements.
(6) Establish an operational contract support section lead at the component or
JTF level to assist in contract support planning and coordination.
(7) Identify logistics plans of the civil authorities and establish a strong working
relationship with logistics liaisons. The closest Title 10 installation provides
logistics functions. Designate this installation as the BSI. Title 10 forces will base
and receive support from the BSI for operations in the response area.
Logisticians must integrate logistics requirements into the BSI requirements to
prevent shortages of equipment and repair capabilities.
(8) Establish procedures to address the challenges of mortuary affairs, including
religious support. Military mortuary affairs within the US differ from combat-
related and civilian mortuary affairs. Additionally, specific legal regulations
outlining what Service members can and cannot do regarding mortuary affairs
and recovery of human remains vary by state and locality.
(9) Track all costs, expenditures, and mission assignments prior to deployment
and retain documentation and receipts.
(10) Determine options for suppliers, their locations, and transportation
requirements.
(11) Prepare for disaster-related outages or interruptions in services or utilities
(e.g., electricity, water, sewage, and fuel).
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
37
(12) Estimate how reduced infrastructure availability will impact supply
distribution and standard consumption rates.
(13) Determine sources for petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL).
(14) Estimate logistics support requirements for each class of supply.
(15) Expect resupply from the BSI. Staff supply requests through
USNORTHCOM, USINDOPACOM, and Service components. However, the BSI’s
capabilities determine the level of supply support.
(16) Order common logistics items, such as Class I (food and water) and Class
III (bulk fuel), using the BSI support document numbers, through military standard
requisitioning and issue procedures (MILSTRIPs) based on input from the
operational headquarters. Authorized units will request and draw commodity
support from the BSI supply support activity.
(17) Do not anticipate Class IV (engineer material) support. Report exceptions to
the designated operational headquarters as part of the requirements forecasts.
(18) Draw Class V (ammunition) by exception.

manager or through the theater lead agent for medical materiel.
(21) Request Class IX (repair and replacement parts) items.
(22) Track and report all costs incurred by the BSI.
(23) Remember, DOD components are responsible for their Service-unique
logistics for deployed units. Expect units to reach back to their home station for
Service-unique support. When Service-unique support is not available from home
stations, Title 10 units should contact USNORTHCOM or USINDOPACOM
Service components for assistance. Commercial or military convoys can move
the requested assets.
(24) Coordinate APOD or SPOD operations and movement support with the J4
from the operational headquarters.
(25) Plan for, and coordinate, military sustainment requirements with the logistics
section chief.

9. Communications
a. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident) Considerations.
(1) Perform internal military communications according to unit standard operating
procedures.
Note: Do not assume military communications equipment is compatible with civilian 
equipment. Do not assume the receiving organization will provide communication 
capabilities.
(2) Plan to adapt to civilian equipment. The National Interagency Incident
Communications Division (NIICD), located at the National Interagency Fire
Center (NIFC), provides portable emergency communications, technical training,
and remote-sensing imagery by aircraft. For information regarding the operation
and maintenance of commercial communications equipment, go to
http://www.nifc.gov/NIICD/index.html.
(3) Ensure all LNOs deploy with the necessary equipment to communicate with
higher headquarters. LNOs must have computer systems and a wireless or
satellite capability to perform their duties effectively.
(4) Coordinate with military, local, state, territorial, tribal, and federal agencies
and organizations; NGOs; and volunteers to determine the most feasible
solutions for effective communication. Sources of information from the JFO
include ICS Form 205 (Incident Radio Communications Plan).

d. Phase 3 (Recovery and Transition) Considerations.
(1) Ensure accountability for all communications equipment.
(2) Prepare an AAR and document lessons learned.
10. Civil Authority Information Support
a. During DSCA operations, psychological operations (forces) (PSYOP) can be
employed to conduct civil authority information support element (CAISE) activities to
provide public information and disaster relief messaging to affected populations.
CAISE activities are executed only under the direction and authority of a designated
lead federal agency or civil authority. When executing CAISE operations, PSYOP
are restricted by policy and SecDef guidance to only broadcasting and disseminating
public information provided by the lead federal agency. The lead federal agency
PIO, incident PIO, or the JIC (as part of the ESF-15, Standard Operating
Procedures, office) will coordinate and disseminate message content. When
authorized, PSYOP use their media development, production, and dissemination
capabilities to create and deliver lead-federal-agency-approved messages.
b. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident) Considerations.
(1) Establish SA by reviewing all pertinent documents for CAISE guidance (e.g.,
deployment order, contingency plan, National Response Framework JIC Model,
ESF-15 Pubic Information Plan and EXORD).
(2) Monitor news reporting to maintain SA of environmental conditions and the
status of the affected population.
(3) Identify potential gaps in information dissemination capabilities, in the
affected area, to anticipate support requests.
(4) Identify equipment and personnel requirements to support the CAISE
mission.
(5) Deploy a CAISE planner in advance of CAISE assets to help civil authorities
understand and, effectively, use CAISE capabilities.
(6) Refer to CJCSI 3110.05F, Military Information Support Operations
Supplement to the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan; JP 3-13.2, Military
Information Support Operations; and field manual (FM) 3-53, Military Information
Support Operations, for further guidance.
c. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2a and 2b) Considerations.
(1) Establish contact with the JIC and ESF-15 external affairs officer or PIO.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1

(2) Brief CAISE capabilities, at the earliest opportunity, to ESF-15 external affairs
officer to increase understanding of CAISE capabilities.
(3) Brief CAISE capabilities to and advise the task force commander on how best
to employ CAISE capabilities to support civil authorities.
(4) Identify the information themes to stress, such as public health and security
considerations. Any themes not approved and promulgated by civil authorities will
not be used or disseminated by CAISE for DSCA operations.
d. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2b and 2c) Considerations.
(1) Coordinate with other military media teams (e.g., combat camera and public
affairs) for video and still imagery support.
(2) Refer media queries concerning CAISE mission and capabilities to the
appropriate PIO.
(3) Establish a civil authority approval process for information products prior to
dissemination.
e. Phase 3 (Recovery and Transition) Considerations.
(1) Establish a continuity file for relief by the follow-on CAISE.
(2) Develop a historical record of approved information products (e.g., print,
visual, and audiovisual) developed and disseminated during the incident.
(3) Prepare an AAR and document lessons learned.
11. PAO and PIO
a. It is the responsibility of local and state officials to provide information and
directions to the public (e.g., evacuation procedures). Each state determines who
has the authority to provide directions to the public (i.e., the sheriff, mayor, or judge).
Note: DOD agencies may assist the authorities with disseminating properly attributed 
information (e.g., “The mayor has directed a mandatory evacuation for the city.”).
b. General information to the public about the event will come from the incident
PAO, press, PIO, or the JIC. Supporting agencies may assist in disseminating this
information, but are limited to providing specific information only about actions of
their agency. For DOD, this means limiting public affairs activities to supporting the
primary agency or focusing on the actions of DOD to support the incident. DOD
public affairs activities will not place DOD in the forefront. DOD is a partner and
participant in the incident response.
c. The PAO is responsible for ensuring military personnel are properly prepared to
speak to the media, when authorized. Encourage PAOs to complete online training
related to ESF-15 at the FEMA website.
d. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident) Considerations.
(1) Develop a communication strategy for the commander, aligned with higher
headquarters and FEMA guidance, including talking points, questions and
answers, themes and messages, and training for supporting military personnel.
44  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
(2) Establish contact with the JFC, JFHQ PAO, component PAO, or CCMD PAO
for public affairs guidance.
(3) Coordinate with the state and FEMA press information officers to obtain a
consistent message and talking points.
(4) Monitor news and social media outlets.
(5) Provide military units current public affairs guidance and talking points and
media and public engagement training prior to entry into the affected area. If
public affairs guidance does not exist, draft proposed guidance and submit it to
higher headquarters.
(6) Develop media smart cards on public affairs guidance for all military
personnel.
Note: Remember, for the press, nothing is off the record; and the camera is always 
rolling. It is important to stress to Service members how a single Soldier, Sailor, Airman, 
or Marine can make a positive or negative strategic impact.
(7) Develop plans for organization and equipment necessary for a public affairs
team.
e. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2a and 2b) Considerations.
(1) Establish contact with the appropriate ESF-15 office, external affairs officer,
primary agency PAO or PIO, and NG PAO.
(2) Designate one or two representatives to the JIC.
(3) Brief deploying personnel on media and public engagement policies. Media
train deploying personnel and distribute media smart cards.
(4) Issue guidance on personal photography, blogs, and e-mails.
(5) Select and train media escorts.
f. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2b and 2c) Considerations.
(1) Brief task force and unit commanders on their roles, responsibilities, and
authorities concerning public information requests.
(2) Prepare the commander and other key staff members for media interviews.
(3) Prepare media releases.
(4) Refer media queries, outside the scope of release authority, to appropriate
agencies or higher headquarters.
(5) Provide video and still imagery of military support to higher headquarters in a
timely manner.
(6) If experienced and trained camera crews are available (e.g., combat camera
teams) consider requesting them to provide imagery support to the PAO.
g. Phase 3 (Recovery and Transition) Considerations.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1

(1) Implement a public affairs strategy for departure of military forces, placing
civil responders in the forefront.
(2) Develop a historical record of media resources (e.g., video, photo, and
transcripts) gathered during the incident.
(3) Prepare an AAR and document lessons learned.
12. SJA
a. The laws and regulations regarding operations on US soil differ from those for
combat operations. Commanders and all DOD personnel involved need to be aware
of these differences. It is essential the SJA educate the commander and staff about
the legal uniqueness of DSCA operations. SJAs will work with commanders to
handle all legal issues.
b. Phase 1 (Pre-incident) Considerations.
(1) Review all documents (e.g., deployment order, EXORD, and RFA).
(2) References may include:
(a) DODD 3025.18.
(b) DODI 3025.21.
(c) DODI 3003.1, DOD Support to Civil Search and Rescue (SAR).

(i) DODD 5210.56, Arming and the Use of Force.
(3) Have copies of the SRUF in CJCSI 3121.01B available for the commander to
review. Brief personnel and issue an SRUF card prior to deployment from the
home station.
(4) The SJA should have a copy of DODD 5200.27, Acquisition of Information
Concerning Persons and Organizations not Affiliated with the Department of
Defense, available. The SJA should understand the restrictions on acquiring
information about non-DOD affiliated persons. Additionally, the SJA should
understand the limitations of the intelligence community’s ability to collect
information concerning US persons under DOD 5240.1-R.
(5) NG personnel working in Title 32 or SAD status follow state RUF. SJAs
should brief the differences between the state and military RUFs.
(6) Review funding, demobilization, and entrance and exit strategies, according
to component and duty status.

c. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2a and 2b) Considerations.
(1) Contact the state SJA at the JFHQ to coordinate legal aspects of the
deployment.
(2) Maintain SA of mission execution and ensure unit activities comply with the
law.
(3) Prepare to deploy required personnel with the advance party.
(4) Ensure all military personnel know their legal authorities (Title 10, Title 32, or
SAD) and limitations.
(5) Provide status reports to higher headquarters including:
(a) Criminal incidents.
(b) Disciplinary, administrative, and prosecutorial actions.
(c) Claims against the US Government.

rules and restrictions. Assist personnel in preparing PUMs.
e. Phase 3 (Recovery and Transition) Considerations.
(1) Complete all legal actions before redeployment.
(2) If possible, close all civil and military actions prior to redeployment.
(3) Prepare an AAR and document lessons learned.
13. Religious Support
a. Military religious ministry personnel provide religious support as part of a religious
support team (RST). Primarily, the RST deploys to provide religious support to
authorized DOD personnel, including military members, their families, and
authorized DOD civilians (assigned and contracted).
b. Currently, DOD interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution and
DOD legal guidance prohibit chaplains from providing religious support to the
general civilian population. However, large-scale disasters may overwhelm local and
state capabilities. In these situations RSTs may serve as liaisons to NGOs and faith-
based organizations when authorized by the DCO, DSC, IC, SCO, or FCO.
c. RSTs may provide incidental support to persons not affiliated with the Armed
Forces during the execution of an authorized mission when all the following criteria
are met:
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
47
(1) An individual requests support in an emergency situation where the need is
immediate, unusual, and unplanned.
(2) The need is short in duration and prone to rapid deterioration requiring
immediate care (e.g., providing Last Rites).
(3) The clergy unaffiliated with the Armed Forces are incapable of providing
support.
(4) Time, distance, and the state of communications may require on-the-spot
determination by the DCO, DSC, IC, SCO, or FCO with input from the chaplain.
(5) The support is incidental, incurring no incremental monetary cost and does
not detract from the primary role of the RST.
d. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident) Considerations.
(1) Deploy liturgical supplies.
(2) Coordinate requests for a chaplain with a medical officer, civilian care
providers, NGOs, and other civilian agencies.
(3) Identify Service and civilian chaplains and clergy requirements.
e. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2a and 2b) Considerations.
(1) Identify, mobilize, and deploy religious support personnel.
(2) Maintain SA of, and report, stress levels of assigned DOD personnel, first
responders, and affected civilians.
(3) Act to provide care and mitigate stress.
f. Phase 2 (Response) (Includes Phases 2b and 2c) Considerations.
(1) Conduct crisis intervention or critical incident stress management training
coordinated with healthcare providers.
(2) Coordinate with staff agencies to ensure subordinate chaplains and enlisted
religious support personnel receive support and professional guidance.
(3) Provide religious support to authorized DOD personnel and focus on
mitigating the impact of traumatic events.
g. Phase 3 (Recovery and Transition) Considerations.

stress management requirements.
(2) Advise the command on the community’s capabilities to resume normal
functions without military support.
(3) Prepare an AAR and document lessons learned.
14. Medical Officer, Surgeon, and Medical Teams
a. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident) Considerations.
48  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
(1) Augment federal, state, territory, tribal, or local medical assets to save lives
and minimize human suffering. Military medical forces remain under C2 of US
military commanders but support the Department of Health and Human Services.
(2) Prepare to use military and civilian resources, process military and civilian
casualties, and complete proper documentation.
(3) When a JTF is activated, designate a command surgeon from one of the
component Services who reports directly to the JFC or joint force land component
commander. The command surgeon will assess the health service support and
force health protection requirements and capabilities.
Note: Refer to JP 4-02, Joint Health Services, for a description of the JTF surgeon's 
responsibilities.
(4) Due to the numerous categories of patients requiring treatment, medical
providers should understand medical eligibility guidelines to ensure patients have
proper access to care. The medical eligibility for care criteria defines when a
military medical provider may treat civilian patients and when civilian providers
may treat military personnel. A determination of eligibility is made at the highest
level possible with SJA support.
Note: Title 32 USC forces differ from Title 10 with regard to medical paperwork, records, 
and tracking.
(5) The Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946 and the Medical Malpractice Immunity
Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-464) provide protection for DOD health care
providers. Claimants must seek compensation from the US Government. Health
care providers are immune to liability for care given while acting within the scope
of their medical duties, including incidents occurring off-post while treating civilian
victims during a declared national emergency or disaster.
(6) An EMAC between states or territories covers tort liability and immunity for
NG medical personnel.
(7) Disasters produce strong emotional and physical responses from victims and
rescuers. Behavioral health personnel play a vital role in advising leaders on
preventive measures and addressing operational stress reactions and other
behavioral health issues. Examples of basic preventive measures include:
(a) Providing an environment to field concerns and allow victims to
decompress.
(b) Keeping families together.
(c) Providing frequent, clear, and updated information to victims.
(d) Helping maintain connections with friends and family.
(e) Maintaining awareness of others’ stress levels.
(f) Insisting on proper sleep, nutrition, and exercise among responders.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
49
(8) Examine and understand potential environmental health risks to DOD
personnel.
(9) Health risks will arise due to:
(a) Lack of waste disposal.
(b) Contaminated food and water.
(c) Inadequate hygiene.
(d) Exposure to heat, cold, or water.
(10) Plan and advise the commander on proper protective measures to prevent
exposure to airborne particulates and dust created by burning or collapsed
debris. The debris in a collapsed building may include asbestos and lead paint.
Airborne particulates may pose a significant health risk to DOD personnel
supporting recovery and reconstruction efforts.
(11) Emphasize comprehensive medical, occupational, and environmental health
surveillance activities; preventive medicine measures; and field hygiene. To
minimize exposure to occupational and environmental health hazards, military
personnel should:
(a) Inspect facilities prior to entry.
(b) Identify, report, and avoid ruptured natural gas lines.
(c) Test and ventilate spaces exposed to carbon monoxide producing
devices.
(d) Use appropriate IPE and PPE (e.g., face masks) to avoid inhaling
airborne debris.
(e) Dispose of waste properly.
(f) Consume food, water, and ice from approved sources.
(g) Provide proper hand-washing facilities near all latrines and dining facilities
and enforce their use.
(h) Avoid animal contact.
(i) Report all animal bites and scratches to medical personnel.
(j) Avoid skin contact with contaminated soil and surface water (e.g., rivers,
lakes, irrigated fields, or puddles).
(k) Take tuberculin skin tests before and after deployment.
(l) Maintain at least 72 square feet per person in sleeping quarters and sleep
head-to-toe.
(m) Use insect repellant containing Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) on all
exposed skin.
(n) Use bed nets in field conditions.
(o) Take malaria prevention medicine, as directed.

Note: Malaria and dengue are serious diseases spread by bites from infected 
mosquitoes. For up to one year following exposure, personnel who become ill with a 
fever and shaking chills should seek immediate medical attention.
(12) Validate credentials.
(13) Provide a medical doctor, nurse practitioner, physician’s assistant, nurse
corps officer, and one medic for deployment with the advance party.

facility or installation medical supply activity.
(24) Estimate medical logistics requirements and plan Class VIII (medical)
resupply sets and preconfigured push-packages to support initial sustainment
operations until replenishment by line-item requisition is established. During
DSCA operations, US Army Medical Command is the designated theater lead
agent for medical materiel (TLAMM) to USNORTHCOM. The
CDRUSNORTHCOM may designate one of the Service components to serve as
the single integrated medical logistics manager (SIMLM). The TLAMM and
SIMLM work together to develop the medical logistics support plan, synchronizing
medical requirements and Class VIII distribution to the JTF. Refer to JP 4-02 and
ATP 4-02.1, Army Medical Logistics, for additional information.
(25) Prepare the force health protection plan.

(2) Contact and coordinate with the Civil Air Patrol (CAP). The CAP, also known
as the Air Force Auxiliary, can be employed in lieu of, or as a supplement to,
active and reserve aviation forces supporting DSCA. The CAP provides aircraft to
assist with searches, visual observations, photography, and light transportation.
US Air Force Numbered Air Forces (NAF), IAW the DSCA EXORD, coordinate
with the CAP National Operations Center for CAP participation in DSCA.
(3) Provide validated, strategic lift capabilities (e.g., mass casualty evacuation,
personnel transportation, or cargo transport). All Services are capable of
providing tactical, rotary-wing lift support.
(4) Identify the airspace control authority (ACA), area air defense commander
(AADC), and collection operations management. These duties are assigned to
the Commander, 1st Air Force, who functions as USNORTHCOM’s Air Force
Service Component Commander and the theater Joint Force Air Component
Commander (JFACC), or Commander, Pacific Air Forces. This person is
USINDOPACOM’s Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR), and theater
JFACC, and the ACA, AADC, and collection operations management authority.
(5) Establish one or more joint air component coordination element (JACCE) to
coordinate air operations with the supported headquarters. When established, the
JACCE acts as the JFACC’s primary representative to the commanders and
facilitates interaction among the associated staffs. Additionally, an aviation C2
cell composed of staff planners from an attached aviation capability may provide
support. Plan to task, coordinate, and vet aerial transport, patient evacuation, and
SAR through an air tasking order.
(6) In the absence of positive Federal Aviation Administration airspace control,
provide procedural airspace management and coordination procedures of military
and civilian aircraft. Coordinate with the JACCE and other aviation units for
aviation-specific planning factors, frequency issues, landing zones (LZs), pickup
zones (PZs), helipads, heliports, airfields, and airports.

16. EOD
a. DOD EOD provides DSCA, under IRA, to assist local, state, and federal
authorities in saving lives and preventing damage to critical infrastructure and key
resources. EOD assists in mitigating, rendering safe, and disposing suspected or
detected unexploded ordnance, damaged or deteriorated explosives, explosive
ordnance or munitions, or an improvised explosive device. Additionally, EOD aid
manages other potentially explosive material or harmful military munitions creating
an imminent threat to public safety. EOD can provide assistance through mutual aid
agreements.
b. An immediate response shall end when the necessity giving rise to the response
in no longer present or when the initiating DOD official or a higher authority directs
an end to the response. Should the response exceed 72 hours (e.g., a sustained
bombing campaign response), appropriate authorities should submit an official RFA.
The initial EOD response may evolve into a larger and more complex event after
assessing the situation. EOD teams responding under IRA are self-sufficient for
short periods of time. Long-duration operations may increase support and logistics
requirements from the incident command.
c. US Navy EOD has specific requirements when conducting underwater operations
and is the only Service EOD that performs underwater render-safe procedures and
EOD dive operations. In addition to any potential HAZMAT requirements associated
with diving equipment and gases, dive operations have unique logistics, personnel,
and mobility support requirements. Establish contact as soon as possible to
ascertain specific EOD requirements.
d. Phase 1 (Pre-incident) Considerations.
(1) Review applicable EOD mutual aid agreements with local or state law
enforcement.
(2) Review DOD policy and guidance for explosives safety and physical security
of arms, ammunition, explosives, classified materials, and communications
equipment.

(d) Classified EOD documents and materials.
(e) Secure communications equipment and materials.
(f) SIPRNET and NIPRNET connectivity.
(6) Prepare EOD liaisons to interface with appropriate levels of the incident
command and CLEAs. DOD EOD supports ESF-13, Public Safety and Security
Annex, and public safety and security functions through the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) Bomb Management Center (BMC). The FBI uses the BMC to
coordinate all bomb squad and EOD operations supporting the senior federal law
enforcement official.
(7) Coordinate collocation with civilian law enforcement or public safety bomb
squad entities.
e. Phase 2 (Response) Considerations.
(1) Identify and report impacts for federal, state, and local law enforcement and
first responders already waiting onscene and holding a secure, safe evacuation
perimeter.
(2) Identify and report impacts on the local populace, communities, and
governments.
(3) Resolve the incident as quickly as possible, allowing the incident command to
return the affected area to normalcy.
(4) Identify and report environmental and explosive safety concerns.
(5) Coordinate mobility requirements (e.g., land, air, or water).
(6) Coordinate security requirements (e.g., personnel and classified materials).
f. For further information, see JP 3-28 and DODD 6055.09E, Explosives Safety
Management (ESM).
17. Military Working Dogs (MWDs)
a. Phase 1 (Pre-Incident) Considerations.
(1) Coordinate transportation. MWD response time depends upon the availability
of transportation for the MWD team and sustainment equipment (approximately
500 pounds).

DOMESTIC INCIDENTS AND SPECIAL EVENTS
1. Overview
Military units tasked to support the civil authority during domestic disasters provide 
effective disaster response capabilities to limit loss of life, mitigate suffering, and curtail 
significant property damage. This chapter will address support for a range of activities in 
response to natural or manmade disasters, support to law enforcement, and other 
activities that leverage DOD resources.
2. Wildland Firefighting
a. A wildland fire is a nonstructure fire occurring in an area with little development,
except for roads, railroads, power lines, and transportation facilities.
b. Authorities governing wildland fire responses include: IRA, mutual aid
agreements, presidential directives, and SecDef-approved RFA from a primary
agency.
c. The state will use all its assets and execute an MOU and EMAC with other states
before requesting any federal military assistance.
d. The following relate to the federal response.
(1) The NIFC is the nation’s support center for wildland firefighting on behalf of
the land management agencies comprising the National Multi-Agency
Coordination group.
(2) DOD provides military resources (ground and air support) for wildland
firefighting efforts. The Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard
operate C-130 aircraft equipped with US Forest Service-owned modular airborne
firefighting systems for aerial fire suppression, upon SecDef approved NIFC RFA.
(3) The NIFC may request DOD personnel to act as Type II ground firefighting
hand crews when a wildland fire exceeds local, state, and NIFC capabilities. The
NIFC will provide advisors that travel to and provide training and equipment for
the supporting DOD elements and resources assigned to the ground firefighting
mission IAW current National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards.
e. For additional information, contact the military liaison officer at the National
Interagency Coordination Center, located at NIFC, in Boise, Idaho, at (208)-387-
5050.
3. Wind Storms (Tropical Cyclones, Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Tornadoes)
a. The main hazards associated with hurricanes are storm surges, high winds,
heavy rain, flooding, and tornadoes. The intensity of a hurricane, indicated by the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, predicts its damage potential.
b. A strong tornado can destroy buildings and create a damage path as much as a
mile wide. Wind speeds can top 300 miles per hour.
58  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
c. Storm surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above
the predicted astronomical tides. Storm surge is produced by water being pushed
toward the shore by the force of the winds moving cyclonically around the storm.
The low pressure associated with intense storms has a minimal impact on storm
surge in comparison to the water being forced toward the shore by the wind. See
figure 8.
Figure 8.
Wind and Pressure Components of a Hurricane Storm Surge
d. Hurricane winds damage structures and the barrage of debris they carry can be
dangerous. Damaging winds begin well before the hurricane eye makes landfall.
e. Some secondary effects of wind and water destruction are electrical power
outages, disruption of utilities, water supply contamination, dam failure, fires, and
chemical spills. Flood waters may contain hazardous waste.
f. A major hurricane or tornado could cause residents to relocate and require
shelter, food, and water. Implement evacuation plans in advance of hurricane
landfall.
g. The IC may issue mission assignments to provide the following resources:
(1) Debris clearance.
(2) Transportation of first responders, evacuees and injured, medically fragile, or
special-needs populations.
(3) Health care providers.
(4) Air assets for SAR and personnel transport and recovery.

(5) Logistical support (e.g., bedding, food, water, generators, or medical
supplies).
(6) Temporary shelter and staging base.
(7) Key infrastructure assessment by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE).
(8) Heavy equipment and operators.
(9) Shoring and structural reinforcement.
(10) Fatality search and recovery teams supporting disaster mortuary operational
response teams.
(11) Supporting law enforcement according to the PCA.
h. Information Resources.

Administration (NOAA), National Hurricane Operations Plan is found on the
Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting
Research website at www.ofcm.gov.
(2) The FEMA website has general information on natural disasters, including
hurricanes and tornadoes, their formation, resulting damage, and preparedness
activities.
(3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website provides
information on hurricanes and other natural disasters.
(4) The NOAA website provides information on weather forecasts and
emergency weather alerts.
i. National Hurricane Center (NHC) Products. NOAA’s NHC issues tropical cyclone
advisory products at least every 6 hours (at 5 am, 11 am, 5 pm, and 11 pm Eastern
Daylight Time) or whenever a tropical cyclone (a tropical depression, tropical storm,
or hurricane) or a subtropical storm has formed in the Atlantic or eastern North
Pacific.
(1) Outlooks. The Tropical Weather Outlook is a discussion of significant areas
of disturbed weather and their potential for development during the next 5 days.
The outlook includes a categorical forecast of the probability of tropical cyclone
formation during the first 48 hours and during the entire 5-day forecast period.
Find graphic versions of the 2-day and 5-day outlooks at www.hurricanes.gov
and www.weather.gov/cphc.
(2) Advisory. The Tropical Cyclone Public Advisory contains a list of all current
coastal watches and warnings associated with an ongoing or potential tropical
cyclone, a post-tropical cyclone, or a subtropical cyclone. It also provides the
cyclone position, maximum sustained winds, current motion, and a description of
the hazards associated with the storm.

(3) Watches.
(a) Tropical Storm Watch. Tropical storm conditions (sustained winds of 39 to
73 miles per hour (mph)) are possible within the specified area within 48
hours.
(b) Hurricane Watch. Hurricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 mph or
greater) are possible within the area. The NHC issues hurricane watches 48
hours before it anticipates tropical storm-force winds because it may not be
safe to prepare for a hurricane once winds reach tropical storm force.
(c) Storm Surge Watch. There is a possibility of life-threatening inundation
from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the
specified area, generally within 48 hours.
(4) Warnings.
(a) Tropical Storm Warning. Tropical storm conditions (sustained winds of 39
to 73 mph) are expected within the area within 36 hours.
(b) Hurricane Warning. Hurricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 mph or
greater) are expected somewhere within the specified area. NHC issues a
hurricane warning 36 hours in advance of tropical storm-force winds to allow
for adequate preparations. All preparations should be complete. Evacuate
immediately, if ordered.
(c) Storm Surge Warning. There is a danger of life-threatening inundation
from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the
specified area within 36 hours. Individuals under a storm surge warning
should check for evacuation orders from local officials.
4. Earthquakes
a. An earthquake is movement, sudden and along a geologic fault, resulting in
release of accumulated strain within or along the edge of one or more of the earth’s
tectonic plates. Earthquakes have potential to cause massive damage and extensive
casualties.
b. Aftershocks follow large earthquakes. Aftershocks can be quite large and cause
weakened structures to collapse or suffer further damage.
c. A tsunami is a sea wave caused by an underwater earthquake, landslide, or
volcanic eruption. Earthquake induced tsunamis advance onshore at great speeds,
resulting in drowning deaths and severe damage to, or destruction of, inundated
structures. See paragraph 5 in this chapter for additional information.
d. Secondary hazards of earthquakes include:
(1) Fires.
(2) Transportation infrastructure and utility impact.
(3) Water contamination and service disruption.
(4) Electrical power interruptions.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
61
(5) Gas leaks and service interruptions.
(6) Communications systems interruption and overload.
(7) Building collapse.
(8) Dam and reservoir failure.
(9) Hazardous materials spills.
e. Regardless of preparation by the local government, a major earthquake will
overwhelm its ability to respond. A supporting commander may receive requests for:
(1) Transporting first responders, evacuees, displaced personnel, and injured,
medically fragile, or special needs populations.
(2) Health care providers.
(3) Air assets for SAR, personnel transport and recovery, patient evacuation,
logistics transport, aerial structural damage assessment, or mobile nuclear air
sampling radioactive particulate collection.
(4) Logistical support (e.g., bedding, food, water, generators, and medical
supplies).
(5) Temporary shelter and staging base.
(6) Key infrastructure assessment by the USACE.
(7) Heavy equipment and operators.
(8) Shoring and debris clearing.
(9) Fatality search and recovery personnel supporting disaster mortuary
operational response teams.
f. The following are earthquake mission considerations.
(1) Do not allow untrained personnel to enter a collapsed structure without
trained and certified personnel leading the effort. Failure to do so may lead to
injury or death.
(2) Prepare to provide key infrastructure assessment support for bridge and
overpass inspections, and replace critical infrastructure.
(3) Provide building inspection and USACE damage survey report assistance.
(4) Plan for limited treatment capabilities due to major structural damage to
hospitals and shortages of medical transport vehicles, trained medical personnel,
and medical and blood supplies.

5. Floods
a. Floods are grouped into the following types: riverine flooding, urban drainage,
ground failures, fluctuating lake levels, coastal flooding and erosion, surface runoff,
62  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
overbank flooding of rivers, flash flooding, dam and levee failure, and ice jam 
flooding.
b. All floods are unique. Some floods develop slowly. Flash floods develop quickly,
sometimes in just a few minutes and without any visible signs of rain in the
immediate area.
c. The following is flood terminology.
(1) A flood watch advises when high flow or overflow of water from a river is
possible within a given time period. It can apply to heavy runoff or drainage of
water into low-lying areas. These watches are issued for flooding expected to
occur at least 6 hours after heavy rains end.
(2) A flood warning advises when flooding occurs or is imminent in the warning
area.
(3) A flash flood watch advises when flash flooding is possible in, or close to, the
watch area. Flood watches are issued for expected flooding within 6 hours after
heavy rains end.
(4) A flash flood warning advises when a flash flood occurs or is imminent in the
warning area resulting from torrential rains, dam failure, or ice jam.
(5) A coastal flood watch advises when the possibility exists for the inundation of
land areas along the coast within the next 12 to 36 hours.
(6) A coastal flood warning advises when land areas along the coast expect to
become, or have become, inundated by sea water above the typical tide action.
d. Effects of flooding on the civilian population may include displacement and
casualties.
e. Flood missions may require military-specific skills and equipment, including:
(1) Assessing damage to roads, bridges, structures, and utilities.
(2) Supporting SAR operations with personnel and equipment.
(3) Conducting geospatial surveys for the extent of flood damage.
(4) Overlaying maps to depict damage, water levels, key facilities, and SAR
activities.
(5) Opening roadways for emergency and medical traffic.
(6) Constructing temporary bridges.
(7) Clearing debris and mud.
(8) Restoring critical facilities, services, and utilities.
(9) Demolishing unsafe structures.
(10) Providing emergency power and restoring power to critical facilities.
(11) Providing expedient repair of critical distribution systems.
(12) Supporting law enforcement according to the PCA.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
63
(13) Supporting evacuation of seriously ill or injured patients to hospitals or
medical care facilities.
(14) Moving animal carcasses for burning or burial.
(15) Assisting with transporting equipment, response personnel, and affected
animals.
(16) Disposing diseased animals based upon US Department of Agriculture
guidance.
(17) Cleaning and disinfecting vehicles, equipment, and facilities.
(18) Setting up temporary staging and storage areas.
(19) Constructing temporary shelters for disaster responders, civilians, and
emergency services personnel.
(20) Constructing temporary sites for medical support, communications,
electrical power generation, and logistical support operations.
f. The following are flood hazards and safety considerations.
(1) Flood waters pose an extreme electrocution hazard. Do not enter flooded
areas without assessing the risk due to downed power lines and submerged
electrical components. Additionally, water and electricity may combine to produce
an elevated risk of structure fires.
(2) Floodwaters obscure ground conditions, causing loss of footing and falls.
(3) Unless authorities declare them safe, assume floodwaters are not safe.
(a) Before entering floodwaters, put on plastic or rubber gloves, boots, and
other protective clothing.
(b) Double gloving with a waterproof glove under a heavy work glove is the
best way to protect the hands from cuts, scrapes, and floodwater exposure.
Use boots and rain gear to prevent lower body skin exposure.
(c) Avoid working alone and wear a USCG-approved life jacket or buoyant
work vest when entering or working over or near flood waters.
(4) Use insect repellent.
(5) Do not handle displaced animals. Wild and domesticated animals will seek
shelter in unusual places to avoid cold, wet, or windy weather. Contact animal
control specialists for help.
(6) In the event of discovering deceased persons, leave the remains in place and
notify a medical examiner or the chain of command.
6. Winter Storms
a. Snow, sleet, freezing rain, and ice are the elements that constitute hazardous
winter storms.
b. Related effects of winter storms include flooding, downed power lines, and
disrupted services. Additionally, freezing conditions may cause broken or burst water
64  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
lines, burst or ruptured pipelines and tanks containing HAZMAT, debris from fallen 
trees and limbs, and restricted mobility.
c. The following are winter storm hazards and safety considerations.
(1) Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas causing sudden illness and
death, if inhaled. During power outages, using wood and fossil fuels for heating
can cause carbon monoxide to build up in a home, garage, or camper.
(a) One of the most dangerous wintertime sources of carbon monoxide is car
exhaust fumes. If keeping the engine on to operate the heater, ensure the
vehicle is in a well ventilated area.
(b) Signs of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, mental confusion,
and extreme tiredness. Move victims into fresh air and provide immediate
medical attention.
(2) Snow or ice accumulation on utility poles, power lines, and trees can cause
live electrical lines to fall. Once lines are down, wet snow can transfer electricity,
creating a large danger area. Always assume power lines are live.
(3) Winter storms can lead to the collapse of buildings, trees, and utility poles.
Moving debris can cause cuts, scrapes, bruises, and sprains, especially to the
hands, back, knees, and shoulders.
(4) Winter storms can damage walkways, parking lots, roads, and buildings.
Collapsing roofs are some of the biggest dangers. Leave at once if shifting or
noise signals an imminent collapse.
d. Winter storms may require military support with specific skills and equipment,
including:
(1) Transporting stranded civilians or essential personnel using military vehicles.
(2) Assessing damage to roads, bridges, structures, and utilities.
(3) Supporting SAR operations.
(4) Overlaying maps to depict damage, key facilities, or SAR activities.
(5) Removing snow and debris from roadways.
(6) Providing emergency power and restoring power to critical facilities.
(7) Supporting law enforcement according to the PCA.
(8) Supporting evacuation of seriously ill or injured patients to hospitals or
medical care facilities.
(9) Distributing food, water, and medical supplies.
(10) Assisting in feeding snowbound livestock.
(11) Identifying civilians who need rescue or supplies. Pay particular attention to
the elderly or people without power or heat. Transport people to relief areas.
(12) Assisting local officials in inspecting buildings for structural integrity, snow
and ice mitigation, and completing damage survey reports.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1

(2) CDC winter storm website.
(3) NOAA website.
(4) ARC website; search for “winter storms”.
f. The following are National Weather Service (NWS) products. Winter weather-
related warnings, watches, and advisories are issued by the local NWS office. Each
office knows the local area and will issue these products based on local criteria.
(1) Advisories.
(a) Winter Weather Advisories. Issued when snow, blowing snow, ice, sleet,
or a combination of these wintry elements is expected but conditions should
not be hazardous enough to meet warning criteria. Be prepared for winter
driving conditions and possible travel difficulties. Use caution when driving.
(b) Freezing Rain Advisories. Issued when light ice accumulation (freezing
rain and freezing drizzle) is expected but will not reach warning criteria.
Expect a glaze on roads resulting in hazardous travel. Slow down and use
caution while driving because even trace amounts of ice on roads can be
dangerous.
(c) Wind Chill Advisories. Issued when low wind chill temperatures are
expected but will not reach local warning criteria. Extremely cold air and
strong winds will combine to generate low wind chill readings. Guard against
frostbite and hypothermia if venturing outdoors. See the NWS Wind Chill
Chart.
(d) Lake Effect Snow Advisory. Issued for widespread or localized lake effect
snowfall accumulation (and blowing snow) remaining below warning criteria.
The local NWS expects lake effect snow showers and assumes travel will be
difficult in some areas. Some localized snow bands will be intense enough to
produce several inches in a few areas with sudden restrictions in visibility.
(2) Watches.
(a) Blizzard Watches. Issued when there is a potential for falling and blowing
snow with strong winds and extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to
whiteout conditions and make travel very dangerous.
(b) Winter Storm Watches. Issued when conditions are favorable for a
significant winter storm event (heavy sleet, heavy snow, ice storm, heavy and
blowing snow, or a combination of events).
(c) Wind Chill Watches. Issued when there is the potential for a combination
of extremely cold air and strong winds to create dangerously low wind chill
values. See Figure 9 on page 66, Wind Chill Chart.
66  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
(d) Lake Effect Snow Watches. Issued when conditions are favorable for a
lake effect snow event. A potential exists for heavy accumulation of lake
effect snow. Travel and commerce may be significantly affected.
Figure 9.
Wind Chill Chart
(3) Warnings.
(a) Blizzard Warnings. Issued for frequent gusts greater than, or equal to, 35
mph accompanied by falling and blowing snow, frequently reducing visibility
to less than 1/4 mile for three hours or more. A blizzard warning means
severe winter weather conditions are expected or occurring. Falling and
blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely, leading to
whiteout conditions, making travel extremely difficult. Do not travel. Those
who must travel should possess a winter survival kit and, if stranded, should
stay inside the vehicle and wait for help to arrive.
(b) Winter Storm Warnings. Issued for a significant winter weather event
including snow, ice, sleet or blowing snow or a combination of these hazards.
Travel will become difficult or impossible in some situations. Individuals
should delay travel plans until conditions improve.
(c) Ice Storm Warnings. Issued for ice accumulation of around 1/4 inch or
more. This amount of ice accumulation will make travel dangerous or
impossible and likely lead to snapped power lines and falling tree branches.
Travel is strongly discouraged.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
67
(d) Wind Chill Warnings. Issued for a combination of very cold air and strong
winds that will create dangerously low wind chill values. This level of wind chill
will result in frostbite and lead to hypothermia if precautions are not taken.
Avoid going outdoors and wear warm protective clothing when venturing
outside. See figure 9.
(e) Lake Effect Snow Warnings. Issued when widespread or localized lake-
induced snow squalls or heavy showers are expected to produce significant
snowfall accumulation. Lake effect snow usually develops in narrow bands
and impacts a limited area. These bands can produce very heavy snow with
sudden restrictions in visibility. Driving conditions may become hazardous at
times.
7. Civil SAR
a. The International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (1979) requires
the establishment of maritime Search and Rescue Regions (SRRs). Every SRR
must have a rescue coordination center (RCC), an operations center responsible for
promoting efficient organization of SAR services and for coordinating the conduct of
SAR operations within a SRR. As required by the Convention on International Civil
Aviation (1944), Annex 12 (Search and Rescue) and the US National Search and
Rescue Plan (NSP) (2016), two DOD RCCs are established by the US Air Force,
which provides funding, manpower, and personnel services to operate them as US
aeronautical SRRs within the USNORTHCOM AOR.
b. CDRUSNORTHCOM is the federal SAR Coordinator for Continental US and
Alaska aeronautical SRRs. The Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC), at
Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, covers the 48 contiguous states known as the
“Langley SRR”. The Commander, Air Forces Northern is designated SAR
Operations Coordinator for the Langley SRR and executes SAR coordinator
authority through the AFRCC. The Alaska Rescue Coordination Center (AKRCC) at
Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, covers the inland areas of Alaska and is
known as the “Elmendorf SRR”. The Commander, Alaska Command is designated
SAR Operations Coordinator for the Elmendorf SRR executing SAR coordinator
authority through the AKRCC.
c. Per the NSP, the USCG is the federal SAR coordinator for all other aeronautical
and maritime SAR. This includes the state of Hawaii as well as waters over which
the US had jurisdiction, such as navigable waters of the US. USCG SRRs are
regional and each has a corresponding USCG district office, SAR coordinator and
RCC. (See figures 10 on page 68 and 11 on page 69)

Figure 11. Pacific Ocean Aeronautical SRR
d. Within the US, local, state, territorial, and tribal authorities are responsible for
planning and conducting SAR activities within their land borders, thereby assuming
the search and rescue mission coordinator (SMC) position. When other SAR
authorities require assistance, they can contact federal RCCs for federal SAR
support. The federal RCC may retain a SMC when it involves scheduled
commercial, interstate, or DOD aviation or other mission of national significance. In
the maritime domain, the USCG’s federal RCC maintains SMC planning and
conducting SAR activities for maritime and aeronautical SAR missions. It is DOD
policy to support domestic civil authorities providing civil SAR to the fullest extent
practicable on a noninterference basis with military duties. Specifically, the
authorities in the NSP encourage DOD personnel to provide domestic SAR support.
DOD is a signatory and participant in the NSP, which is the signed policy of eight
federal agencies for the US for coordinating SAR services to meet domestic needs
and international commitments. The NSP is always in effect and the responsibilities
are never delegated or transferred.
70  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
(1) Approval authorities for SAR will depend on the asset used. At a minimum,
DODI 3003.01, DOD Support to Civil Search and Rescue (SAR); DODD 3025.18;
and the DSCA EXORD apply. DODI 3003.01 designates USNORTHCOM and
USINDOPACOM Commanders to serve as DOD leads in their AORs for matters
pertaining to planning and operation of ESF-9, Search and Rescue Annex,
consistent with the DHS’ NRF state EMACs or local mutual aid documents or
MOUs/agreements may be executed to obtain DOD SAR services. For example,
AFRCC maintains, and continuously reviews, SAR MOUs/agreements with all 48
contiguous states for routine/mass rescue operation SAR responses.
(2) Civil SAR is defined in DODI 3003.01 as SAR operations in the air, on land,
and on water to assist persons and protect life in a permissive environment. Civil
SAR standards, terminology, and procedures will be used throughout DOD
support of civil SAR planning and operations. Military forces supporting civil SAR
should be aware that significant terminology and procedural differences exist
between DOD and the civil SAR system. For example, “civil SAR” is NOT
referred to by the acronym “CSAR” which specifically denotes “combat search
and rescue”. Civil SAR and CSAR are different activities bound by different
policies, guidance, and laws. During a potential or actual distress situation
requiring DOD civil SAR support, one of the following avenues may be used in
requesting DOD SAR responses. The following three terms denote a SAR
response based on the size/scale of the event and number of persons in actual,
or potential, distress.
(a) Routine SAR is the term used to address day-to-day civil SAR operations
and includes aeronautical SAR, beacon activations, and RFAs from local or
state civil authorities to search for downed aircraft or civil SAR assistance in
the vicinity of airports. Routine SAR examples are searches for lost hunters,
rescue of a fallen mountain climber, or searches for lost boaters. The process
is:
x A local/state civil authority may make a RFA to a DOD RCC for routine
SAR support.
x A DOD RCC, either AFRCC or AKRCC, requests Service rescue units
to provide the SAR assistance. Neither entity can task the unit.
x AFRCC and AKRCC do not approve SAR missions; they coordinate
them.
x DOD forces will fund their own activities without allowing cost
reimbursement to delay response to any person in danger or distress.
Reporting and C2 are retained through service channels.
(b) Mass rescue operation (MRO) is the term to identify the need for DOD
SAR services characterized by large numbers of persons in distress and
resources and capabilities (i.e., local/state/federal) available to SAR
authorities are either inadequate or unavailable. SAR coordination
architecture remains in effect. MRO examples are when:
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
71
x Requests from local/state authorities to search for a lost family or group
in the wood/mountains.
x A cruise ship is in distress, where the USCG requests additional DOD
resources to effect MROs. The process is the same as for a routine SAR.
(c) Catastrophic incident search and rescue (CISAR) is used for operations
carried out as part of a response to any natural or manmade incident,
including terrorism. These result in extraordinary levels of mass casualties,
damage, or disruption severely affecting the population, infrastructure,
environment, economy, national morale, and government functions. Unlike
Routine SAR/MROs, CISAR operations are characterized by an emergency
or disaster declared by the POTUS and executed under the provisions of the
NRF, including the ESF-9, Search and Rescue Annex. CISAR is considered a
DSCA event in which funding and support fall under different rules than
routine SAR/MRO. Figure 12 depicts the civil SAR umbrella:
Figure 12. Civil SAR Umbrella
e. USNORTHCOM is the DOD lead for CISAR support to federal ESF-9 and an
ESF-9 primary agency supporting states, tribes, and US territories/insular areas
within the USNORTHCOM AOR. USNORTHCOM has designated AFNORTH as the
lead component for DOD CISAR support to ESF-9 in the 48 contiguous states, tribes
and US territories. USNORTHCOM’s Alaska Command (ALCOM) is the lead
command for DOD CISAR support to ESF-9 in the state and tribes of Alaska. CISAR
support includes planning, provisioning of resources, and coordinating and tracking
SAR services provided to incident commanders. AFNORTH and ALCOM are
responsible to develop a scalable, flexible and responsive element of subject matter
experts to coordinate all-domain DOD Title 10 CISAR actions with other ESF-9
primary agencies in support of the lead federal agency (LFA) and impacted states.
This element is referred to as a search and rescue-operations coordination element
72  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
(SAR-OCE). The SAR-OCE is intended to be an all-domain CISAR coordination 
function with representation from all components, not a C2 node. For a no-notice 
disaster, it is likely a CISAR response will be initiated by a DOD RCC (AFRCC or 
AKRCC) and coordination responsibilities turned over to SAR-OCE when it becomes 
fully functional. RCCs will support SAR-OCE while maintaining their routine 
SAR/MRO” response, as appropriate.
(1) Due to the urgent nature of CISAR response, all legal authorities should be
used to employ DOD SAR capability in an expeditious and coordinated manner.
All DOD Title 10 employment authorities are executed at the request of, and in
support of, an appropriate civil authority and include an approved ESF-9 mission
assignment, federal SAR coordinator authority, and IRA. These authorities exist
simultaneously and should be employed in coordination and mutual support.
DOD service authority may be used to deploy SAR forces to an impacted region
to posture for future employment. The SAR-OCE, RCC and Service components
must actively coordinate with each other to gain SA of the forces and authorities
in use during the initial CISAR response.
(2) The SAR-OCE will remain under the OPCON of AFNORTH but will operate in
support of an overall lead joint functional component command, or be assigned
TACON to a JTF, if established. The SAR-OCE is the DOD focal point for
coordination with key SAR nodes at the FEMA region and state levels, identifying
SAR resource needs, tracking operational activity, and coordinating with
components on SAR asset resourcing and provisioning for employment. Service
components will retain OPCON of their SAR forces but release TACON of them
for employment (i.e., to a DSC) and report SAR activity to the SAR-OCE. The
goal is to provide SAR capability, efficiently, in direct support of a civil IC who can
employ that capability.
f. DOD resources are provided only when response or recovery requirements are
beyond the capabilities of local, state, and federal civil authorities, or when they are
requested by a federal agency with lead responsibility and approved by SecDef. An
exception to this is IRA. (Refer to chapter II for additional information.)
8. CBRN Incidents
a. A CBRN incident results from using CBRN weapons and devices, the emergence
of hazards arising from friendly actions, or the release of toxic industrial materials or
biological organisms and substances into the environment. CBRN threats and
hazards include CBRN elements that could create adverse effects due to an
accidental or deliberate hazard release and dissemination.
b. CBRN incidents may require military forces with specialized training to augment
civilian resources, including:
(1) Providing forces capable of conducting a CBRN response.
(2) Conducting CBRN sample management (i.e., collect, package, transport,
store, transfer, analyze, track, and dispose samples).
(3) Conducting CBRN-related monitoring and survey operations.
)HEUXDU\ ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 
73
(4) Detecting and identifying CBRN contamination.
(5) Marking CBRN contaminated areas, equipment, supplies, and facilities with
standard marking signs.
(6) Conducting SAR.
(7) Supporting mass casualty decontamination operations.
(8) Providing medical triage to CBRN casualties.
(9) Supporting and maintaining CBRN equipment.
c. The following are CBRN hazards and safety considerations.
(1) Unstable Structures. A CBRN event can damage walkways, parking lots,
roads, and buildings. Personnel should not work around any damaged structure
until certified safe by an engineer.
(2) Downed Power Lines. Only trained electricians and utility workers should
approach or handle electrical lines. All other response workers should avoid
going near downed lines.
(3) Handling Contaminated Human Remains. Leave remains in place and notify
a medical examiner or the chain of command.
(4) Limiting the Spread of Contamination or Contagion. CBRN passive defense
is a combination of contamination control, mitigation, and decontamination.
d. For more information on CBRN responder training, zone controls, and response
operations, see JP 3-41, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Response;
DODD 3150.08, DOD Response to Nuclear and Radiological Incidents; and Army

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) 3-11.24; Air Force TTP 3-2.37; Multi-
Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
and Nuclear Consequence Management Operations.
9. National Special Security Events (NSSEs)
a. NSSEs represent the highest levels of events requiring short-duration military
support. NSSEs include presidential inaugurations, major sporting events,
presidential debates, state of the union addresses, national political conventions,
and international gatherings (e.g., G-8 summit). Non-NSSEs or events of lesser
significance are rated by the Special Events Working Group with a special events
assessment rating. These events may require DOD support similar to NSSEs.
Regardless of the event, the RFA process is used to request DOD assets and
capacities to support a primary agency.
b. Special event missions require military-specific capabilities, including:
(1) Security forces.
(2) Ground forces.
(3) Airlift support, airspace management, and air defense.

(4) Maritime forces.
(5) Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear response forces.
(6) Route survey.
(7) Logistics.
(8) Transportation.

10. Cyberspace-Related Incident
a. A cyberspace-related incident of national significance may take many forms,
including an organized cyber-attack, an uncontrolled exploit (e.g., virus or worm), a
natural disaster, or anything capable of causing extensive damage to critical
infrastructure or key assets.
b. Large-scale cyber incidents may overwhelm government and private-sector
resources by disrupting the Internet and taxing critical infrastructure information
systems. Complications from disruptions of this magnitude may threaten lives,
property, the economy, and national security. Rapid identification, information
exchange, investigation, and coordinated response will mitigate the damage.
c. During DSCA operations, state and local networks operating in a disrupted or
degraded environment may require DOD assistance. Services support the
remediation, restoration, and protection of critical emergency telecommunication
networks and infrastructure. Cyberspace technical assistance may be provided in
response to a request from a lead federal agency.

2. Commander’s Rules for the Use of Force (RUF) Example for Title 10 United
States Code Forces
Table 4 is an example of a commander’s RUF (Title 10 Forces).
An Example of a Commander’s RUF (Title 10 Forces)
Teach and Train. A commander must train personnel in the standing rules for the use of force 
(SRUF) and implement them, when necessary. SRUF trainers must ensure the training does not 
introduce procedures that restrict the SRUF or introduce tactically dangerous or unsound practices.
Unit Self-Defense. A commander retains the inherent right and obligation of unit self-defense and 
defense of other Department of Defense (DOD) forces in the vicinity, in response to a hostile act or 
demonstrated hostile intent.
Individual Self-Defense. A commander may impose rules of proportionality on individual self-
defense. Use force only as a last resort and use the minimum necessary. Ensure it is reasonable in 
intensity, duration, and magnitude to counter the threat, based on the totality of the circumstances. 
Use lethal force only when all lesser means have failed or cannot be reasonably employed. 
Coordinate SRUF. A commander will coordinate the SRUF with civilian law enforcement agencies 
(CLEAs) or security forces, when operating with them, to ensure a common understanding. Any rules 
for the use of force (RUF) issues, which cannot be resolved, will be forwarded to the Secretary of 
Defense (SecDef) through the chain of command and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Imminent Threat. A commander will determine if a threat of death or serious bodily harm by an 
individual or motor vehicle is imminent based on an assessment of all of the circumstances. If the 
commander determines such a threat is imminent, lethal force is authorized to stop the threat.
Inherently Dangerous Property. A commander may designate DOD property, or property having a 
DOD nexus, as inherently dangerous. This includes weapons, ammunition, explosives, portable 
missiles, rockets, chemical agents, and special nuclear materials.
Pursue and Recover. A commander may not authorize forces to pursue and recover a stolen asset 
vital to national security or inherently dangerous property unless delegated this authority by the 
Commander, United States Northern Command (CDRUSNORTHCOM) and CLEAs, or when security 
forces are not reasonably available. Any pursuit must be immediate and uninterrupted.
Changes to SRUF. A commander may augment the SRUF, as necessary, by submitting requests for 
mission-specific RUF to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for approval by the SecDef.
Violations. A commander will immediately report any suspected violation of, or noncompliance with,
the SRUF through the chain of command to CDRUSNORTHCOM.

3. RUF Card Template Example for Title 10 Forces
Table 5 is an example of a RUF card template (Title 10 Forces).
An Example of a RUF Card Template (Title 10 Forces)
Unit Self-Defense. Commanders always retain the inherent right and obligation to exercise unit self-
defense in response to a hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent. This includes the defense of other 
Department of Defense (DOD) forces in the vicinity.
Note: Defense support of civil authorities geographic combatant commander will provide standing 
rules for the use of force (SRUF) guidance noting SRUF in accordance with Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3121.01B, Standing Rules of Engagement/Standing Rules for the Use of 
Force for US Forces.
Individual Self-Defense. Service members may exercise individual self-defense in response to a 
hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent. A commander may impose rules of proportionality on 
individual self-defense. Use force only as a last resort and use the minimum necessary. Ensure it is
reasonable in intensity, duration, and magnitude to counter the threat, based on the totality of the 
circumstances. Use lethal force only when all lesser means have failed or cannot be reasonably 
employed. SRUF training must introduce procedures that restrict tactically dangerous or unsound 
practices.
De-escalation. When time and circumstances permit, Service members will give individuals a 
warning and an opportunity to withdraw or stop the threatening actions before using force. Avoid 
confrontation with individuals who pose no threat to the unit, non-DOD persons in the vicinity, or 
property secured by DOD forces. If a confrontation appears likely, civilians are acting in a suspicious 
manner, or it is immediately after a confrontation, notify civilian law enforcement agencies or security 
agency personnel as soon as practical.
Limitations on the Use of Force. Service members will use force, of any kind, only as a last resort. 
If used, the force should be the minimum necessary to accomplish the mission. Force must be 
reasonable in intensity, duration, and magnitude to counter the threat based on all the circumstances. 
Exercise due regard for the safety of bystanders when using force. Warning shots are not authorized.
Use of Nonlethal Force. Service members may use nonlethal force to stop a threat, when it is 
reasonable to:
x
Control a situation and accomplish the mission.
x
Provide protection for self and other DOD personnel.
x
Defend non-DOD persons in the vicinity, if directly related to the assigned mission.
x
Defend designated, protected property.
Lethal Force in Self-Defense, Defense of Others, and Defense of Property. Service members 
may use lethal force to stop a threat only when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be 
employed, and it appears necessary to: 
x
Protect DOD forces when a commander believes a person poses an imminent threat of death
or serious bodily harm.
x
Protect non-DOD persons in the vicinity from the imminent threat of death or serious bodily
harm, if directly related to the assigned mission.
x
Prevent the theft or sabotage of assets vital to national security, national critical infrastructure,
or inherently dangerous property.
Lethal Force is Not Authorized. Lethal force is not authorized to disperse a crowd, stop looting, 
enforce a curfew, or protect nondesignated property.

Table 5  An Example of a RUF Card Template (Title 10 Forces) (cont’d)
Lethal Force Against a Serious Offense. Service members may use lethal force, if it is directly 
related to the assigned mission and appears necessary to:
x
Prevent a serious crime against any person, which involves imminent threat of death or
serious bodily harm.
x
Prevent the escape of a prisoner where probable cause indicates the prisoner committed or
attempted to commit a serious offense and would pose an imminent threat of death or serious
bodily harm to DOD forces or others in the vicinity.
x
Arrest or apprehend a person who, there is probable cause to believe, has committed a
serious offense that involved an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm or sabotage
of designated protected property.
Lethal Force Against a Vehicular Threat. Service members may fire their weapons at a moving 
land or water vehicle when they believe the vehicle poses an imminent threat of death or serious 
bodily harm to DOD forces or to non-DOD persons in the vicinity, if doing so is related to the assigned 
mission.
Inspection of Personnel Entering and Exiting an Area. Per command security guidance, Service 
members may inspect individuals and property prior to granting persons or property entry inside a 
DOD perimeter or secured area and upon leaving such an area. An individual or item of property, 
which does not meet the command security requirements for entry, may be denied access inside a 
DOD perimeter or secured area.
Temporary Detention of Threatening Personnel. Service members may detain an individual 
temporarily, if the individual:
x
Gains unauthorized access inside DOD perimeters or other secured areas and refuses to
depart such an area after being denied further access.
x
Threatens the safety and security of DOD forces, property secured by DOD forces, or non-
DOD persons in the vicinity, if related to the assigned mission.
Detained Individuals. Detained individuals, vehicles, and property may be searched as a protection 
measure. Detained individuals and any secured property will be released to a civilian law 
enforcement agency (CLEA) at the earliest opportunity, consistent with mission accomplishment.
Pursuit and Recovery of Stolen Property. Forces are not authorized to pursue and recover a 
stolen asset vital to national security or inherently dangerous property, unless delegated this authority 
by the Commander, United States Northern Command and CLEA or security forces are not 
reasonably available. Any pursuit must be immediate, continuous, and uninterrupted.
Report Violations of the SRUF. Immediately, Service members will report any violation of or 
noncompliance with the SRUF (concerning who, what, when, where, and why) to the chain of 
command, inspector general, judge advocate, or any commissioned officer.

4. RUF Card Template Example for Title 32 and State Active Duty (SAD) National
Guard (NG) Forces
Table 6 is an example RUF card template (Title 32 and SAD NG Forces).
An Example of a RUF Card Template (Title 32 and SAD NG Forces) 
Minimum Force: Military personnel will use the minimum force required to accomplish the mission.
Self-Defense. Nothing in these rules for the use of force (RUF) shall limit a commander’s inherent 
duty to safeguard the force or an individual‘s inherent right of self-defense. Proportional to the threat,
an individual is always authorized, and expected, to use necessary force in self-defense. A 
commander may impose rules of proportionality on individual self-defense.
Note: Title 32 and state active duty National Guard forces, defense support of civil authorities
geographic combatant commanders would ensure standing rules for the use of force guidance; any 
federal preemption would also require compliance with Section 32. Title 18, United States Code (18 
USC 32) under state authorities.
Lethal Force. Lethal force refers to physical force, which could result in death, whether or not death 
is the intent. In all cases, discharging a firearm is considered lethal force. Before resorting to lethal 
force, all of the following conditions must be met.
x
All other means have been exhausted, are not appropriate, or are not reasonably available
(including restraining, detaining, and subduing).
x
Using lethal force does not increase the risk of death or serious bodily harm to innocent
bystanders.
Lethal force may be used for one or more of the following circumstances.
x
Use self-defense to avoid death or serious bodily harm. Threat of harm is not restricted to
firearms. It may include assault with large rocks, bricks, pipes, or other heavy missiles,
incendiary and explosive devices, or any other material, which could be expected to cause
death or serious bodily harm.
x
Use lethal force to prevent crime involving a substantial risk of death or very serious bodily
harm, including defending others.
x
Use it for detention or prevention of the escape of a person, who during detention, or in the act
of escape, threatens to kill or cause serious bodily harm to others. Attempt to escape does not
justify using lethal force. Using lethal force is justified only when it is immediately necessary to
protect against death or serious bodily harm.
x
Use lethal force to stop immediate threats, not to warn them. Warning shots and blanks are
not authorized.

Arming Order. Local commanders determine the arming order based on mission requirements. 
Local commanders may modify the arming order depending on mission, terrain, troop availability, and 
time availability. Arming order considerations include the following.
x
Deploying troops without weapons, in appropriate circumstances.
x
Considering, arming orders are not necessarily sequential. Select the most appropriate
posture for the potential threat and observe the minimum necessary force principle.
When forces are fired upon, consider Arming Order-4 and Arming Order-5 and return aimed fire with 
selected sharpshooters.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) 
RESPONSE ENTERPRISE (CRE) 
1. Overview
a. The CRE is a national, multi-component, military organization designed to save
lives and minimize human suffering in the aftermath of a CBRN incident. It is
geographically dispersed, incorporating National Guard (NG) capabilities in every
state, to enable the most rapid state directed, initial response.
b. The CRE, composed of organizations ranging from platoon sized through two-
star commands, responds in a building approach from state to regional to federal
response based on the size of the CBRN incident. The response is orchestrated
through a combination of state authorities, multistate agreements, and federal
authorities. Domestic disasters and emergencies are managed at the lowest level
possible.
c. Civil authorities may have insufficient capabilities to respond adequately to
significant or catastrophic CBRN incidents. Civil authorities may request a CBRN
response and other DSCA capabilities to support their response to an incident.
Requests for CRE forces may originate at local, state, territory, and national
governances.
d. The Department of Defense (DOD) has allotted military forces (through
assignment, allocation, or apportionment), primarily, for the homeland CBRN
response mission. These forces are collectively referred to as the “CRE”. Under
state control, these NG forces consist of a weapons of mass destruction-civil support
team (CST), homeland response forces (HRF), and chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear enhanced response force package (CERFP). Under federal
control, these forces consist of the defense chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear response force with joint task force-civil support as its core command and
control, and two command and control CBRN response elements.
2. Force Allocation
All CRE forces are allocated to either U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) or U.S. 
Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM). In the event of a domestic CBRN incident, each
CRE element must be able to operate as a single force at one or more designated sites
(see figure 13).

MARITIME DSCA RESPONSE 
1. Overview
Note: For brevity, this publication refers to specific laws or United States Code (USC) 
titles without USC.
a. A maritime response represents a costly option for leveraging Department of
Defense Title 10, United States Code (10 USC) forces. However, in cases where
significant infrastructure damage occurs, or for states outside the continental United
States (US) and territories, a sea based response offers:
(1) Employment flexibility.
(2) Reduced demands on an already stressed infrastructure.
(3) Access to remote or isolated communities.
b. This appendix addresses the capabilities of organizations operating within a
maritime environment. The United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine
Corps (USMC) have forces that are useful for defense support of civil authorities
(DSCA) operations. Overseas combat contingencies are their primary missions, but
they can serve as dual-use forces for DSCA missions. Table 8 illustrates potential
USN and USMC dual-use capabilities. United States (US) Army watercraft and water
terminal forces may be leveraged as well. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is
one of the US Armed Forces, as prescribed in Title 14, Section 1. The USCG
executes a variety of missions, including search and rescue (SAR), maritime law
enforcement, and defense readiness. The USCG may have support teams assisting
the federal response during DSCA incidents. Figure 14 shows the USCG districts.
2. USN
a. Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC). NECC serves as the single
functional command and force provider for the USN’s expeditionary forces.
b. Coastal Riverine Forces. While primarily tasked with combat theater operations,
these small-boat units are useful for shallow-water DSCA operations.
c. Mobile Diving and Salvage Units. Mobile diving and salvage units can survey and
clear harbors of navigational hazards, conduct underwater search and recovery, and
perform limited underwater repairs.
d. Naval Construction Force. USN engineer units include USN mobile construction
battalions, construction battalion maintenance units, and underwater construction
teams. Engineer units offer substantial capabilities for route opening, collapsed
structure SAR, and expedient infrastructure repair.
3. USMC
a. Commander, Marine Forces Northern Command and Commander, Marine
Forces Pacific (as subordinate Service components) conduct coordination, planning,
and operations in support of DSCA; including maritime DSCA operations.
96  ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/CGTTP 3-57.1 )HEUXDU\ 
b. Naval response to a combatant commander identified or anticipated requirement
will drive identification of available capabilities, planning, and execution timelines;
including marshaling, movement, and embarkation.
c. To support DSCA operations, USMC units are organized into Marine air-ground
task forces scaled and tailored in accordance with mission requirements.
d. Table 8 depicts dual-use capabilities resident with USN and USMC forces.
USMC and USN Maritime Capabilities
Under certain circumstances, maritime forces provide combatant commanders a broad 
spectrum of capabilities from the sea. The dual-use capabilities United States Marine Corps 
(USMC) and United States Navy (USN) align with requirements identified in emergency 
support functions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Italicized text represents capabilities in both Services 
that may differ in specifics and capacity.

4. USCG
a. The USCG executes a variety of missions and activities including:
(1) SAR (including post-incident maritime evacuation).
(2) Ports, waterways and coastal security.
(3) Maritime law enforcement under the Enforcement of Laws and Treaties
program.
(4)
Defense readiness.
(5) Responsibilities under the National Response Framework (NRF).
b. The USCG may provide assets and deployable specialized forces to support the
federal response to natural or manmade disasters. Figure 14 shows USCG districts.
Figure 14. USCG Districts
c. USCG command and control capabilities span the US, and a major disaster
response likely will involve the USCG. The USCG does not require a declaration of
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to engage in
emergency response activities that impact the US maritime domain. The authorities
inherent in Title 14, federal laws, and Department of Homeland Security policies
cover USCG activities. When the USCG participates in the NRF operations outside
established statutory missions, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will
provide the USCG mission assignments for the appropriate emergency support
function. USCG forces that may be involved in a federal response include:

(1) Area, district, and sector commands.
(2) Marine safety units and detachments.
(3) Small boat stations.
(4) Air stations.
(5) Cutters.
(6) Deployable specialized forces.
d. USCG sector commanders have the following authorities and responsibilities
within their area of responsibility:
(1) Captain of the port (COTP).
(2) Federal on-scene commander.
(3) SAR mission coordinator.
(4) Officer in charge of marine inspections.
(5) Federal maritime security coordinator.
e. For more information on USCG support of DSCA operations, refer to the
Commandant Instruction (COMDTINST) M3010.24 (series), Contingency Planning
Preparedness Manual, Vol 4: Incident Management and Crisis Response.
f. Aids-to-navigation units provide emergency harbor surveys, coordinated with
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to ensure ports and waterways
are navigable.
g. Marine transportation system recovery units and incident management
assistance teams are specialized teams that augment local commanders,
reestablish port operations, and run large-scale incident responses.
5. US Army
a. US Army watercraft and water terminal forces provide support for DCSA
operations. Their primary mission is bolstering overseas combat contingencies, but
they serve as dual-use forces for DSCA missions, with USN, USMC, and USCG
maritime forces.
b. US Army Forces Command serves as the single, force provider for Army forces
supporting DSCA operations. US Army forces can provide lodging support, power
generation, medical support, and general engineering/construction support.
c. The Army employs watercraft capable of moving supplies, equipment, and
personnel in shallow coastal waters, inland waterways, and rivers. Army watercraft
support logistics operations at sea ports and small terminals and in environments
where shore-based facilities have been damaged or do not exist.
d. Army terminal units conduct cargo operations in sea ports, water terminals, and
environments where shore-based facilities have been damaged or do not exist.
Army terminal forces include mobile communications systems and ocean-going and
